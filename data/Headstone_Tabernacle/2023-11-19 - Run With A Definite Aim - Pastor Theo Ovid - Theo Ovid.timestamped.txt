[58:53] this message this morning
[58:56] would
[58:58] would challenge you to come out what I
[59:01] call a false sense of
[59:03] security that is prevalent in this end
[59:06] time message a
[59:09] false sense of
[59:12] security you know have something called
[59:14] DIY do it yourself do it yourself to
[59:17] make a chair to make a couch to make a
[59:19] well Minister seems to have a shortcut
[59:21] for adoption do it yourself adoption
[59:24] just say adopted and you're adopted you
[59:25] say this and you say that come like a
[59:27] man p a dress and say he's a woman does
[59:29] that make that
[59:31] so but God have a
[59:33] program right so I believe there are no
[59:37] shortcuts there are no shortcuts they
[59:39] have no free Bible and Kentucky fight
[59:42] chicken after service come to church it
[59:43] don't have that it have you are
[59:46] disciples except your forsake mother
[59:48] father brother and follow me you're not
[59:50] worthy of me that's what Jesus preached
[59:53] take up your cross daily and follow me
[59:56] that's what Jesus preached not come join
[59:58] come die Oh Glory to God come and die
[1:00:02] that's why he said Ser we would see
[1:00:04] Jesus and if you haven't listened to
[1:00:05] Wednesday night message listen to it
[1:00:07] it's a junction message is an important
[1:00:09] message getting to Jesus glory to God
[1:00:12] because a lot of people not get into
[1:00:13] Jesus they get into church but not Jesus
[1:00:15] they get into a man not Jesus they get
[1:00:17] into a pastor but not Jesus they getting
[1:00:19] message books and T but not Jesus they
[1:00:21] don't know Jesus they ask the Greek say
[1:00:24] ser we would see Jesus and those
[1:00:26] disciples didn't Co carry them in a
[1:00:27] corner and explain anything to them and
[1:00:30] guess what you cannot introduce somebody
[1:00:33] that you don't
[1:00:35] know so I don't know but a punch and say
[1:00:37] sir I want to see but the punch and I
[1:00:39] don't know who but the punch is well
[1:00:40] tell them well you know punch is a tall
[1:00:42] guy I don't know
[1:00:44] him so you cannot introduce who you
[1:00:47] don't know so you have to know Christ to
[1:00:49] introduce Christ oh give the Lord I
[1:00:51] shout in the house do you see where
[1:00:54] together to
[1:00:55] now God I don't know what I say this
[1:00:57] morning in the early years I was telling
[1:01:00] my son Isa last night in the early years
[1:01:03] when the message first had to come to
[1:01:04] Trinidad get books and stuff anybody who
[1:01:07] read two books have more information
[1:01:08] than everybody else and boy is that
[1:01:11] instant preachers you know two books and
[1:01:13] a man want to share things talk and talk
[1:01:16] what kind of homosexual what kind of
[1:01:17] filthy people all them all them walk
[1:01:19] away right now you can't see the shadow
[1:01:21] but they pumping they pumping two books
[1:01:23] three books
[1:01:25] that finish with
[1:01:26] now it's trying thing
[1:01:29] you man who was never even called not
[1:01:32] called to the pulpit not called to the
[1:01:34] ministry some of them still a
[1:01:36] called but because they have you know
[1:01:38] they say the one ey mind is King in the
[1:01:40] land of the
[1:01:42] blind let me say it again they say one
[1:01:44] ey man is King in the land of the blind
[1:01:47] blind leading the
[1:01:49] blind my
[1:01:51] God so whatever man say doesn't make it
[1:01:54] so
[1:01:55] I am the Holy Ghost is that
[1:01:57] right that's that's crazy people just
[1:02:00] saying things and people believe in what
[1:02:02] they say but I'm going to find it I'm
[1:02:04] going to read it they say when a church
[1:02:06] get off the word they'll believe
[1:02:08] anything when they go off the word
[1:02:10] because it is Satan in
[1:02:14] deception you know what they say in the
[1:02:16] Bible they found they say they are Jews
[1:02:17] and found them to be
[1:02:19] liars and was Believers exposing them
[1:02:21] you know these So-Cal died apostles who
[1:02:23] say they are and for to be Liars because
[1:02:26] it wasn't saying what Paul say it wasn't
[1:02:28] saying what the tape say because the
[1:02:30] spirit the prophet and the bride saying
[1:02:32] the same thing now this is not a
[1:02:35] Sprint this is not a swift race this is
[1:02:37] a long different race a long distance
[1:02:40] race so you had to run and pace yourself
[1:02:44] now I used to run Sprint I used to run
[1:02:45] 100 and
[1:02:47] 200 and there's a certain way to run you
[1:02:49] 200 there's a certain way to to run you
[1:02:51] 100 but when you see long distance you
[1:02:53] have to pace yourself
[1:02:55] because if you run too
[1:02:56] fast you burn out and then you fall on
[1:02:59] on the side you have to get in the
[1:03:01] Rhythm to run and to peace yourself and
[1:03:04] Philippians it says not as though I
[1:03:07] already attained either have already
[1:03:08] been perfect but I follow after if I may
[1:03:12] apprehend for that which also I'm
[1:03:14] apprehended in Christ Jesus this is what
[1:03:16] Paul said in Philippians Brethren I
[1:03:18] count not myself to have apprehended but
[1:03:21] this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:03:23] things which behind and I reach forth to
[1:03:26] those things which are before and that's
[1:03:28] is why I rebuking all this grandfather
[1:03:30] and grandmother and who tell you tell 20
[1:03:32] years ago Liars don't come here with
[1:03:34] that forgetting the things that have
[1:03:36] passed get yourself together oh give the

[1:06:03] you God love you that's why God call you
[1:06:05] oh give the Lord a
[1:06:09] shout glory to God your mother say it
[1:06:12] was a
[1:06:14] mishap she never wanted you she was
[1:06:16] pregnant she didn't want to be pregnant
[1:06:18] that's a lie she had to bring you

[1:06:26] name on the book oh give the Lord a
[1:06:28] shout who s i now oh glory to God they
[1:06:32] give you flesh and eyes and all kind of
[1:06:35] physical description but that Gene in
[1:06:37] your soul is what God put inside of you
[1:06:40] and he put it there before the
[1:06:41] foundation of the world you have
[1:06:43] something to shout about glory to God I
[1:06:45] took care of your father is a drunkard
[1:06:47] and your mother was a prostitute that
[1:06:49] has nothing to do with your future Oh
[1:06:51] Glory to God are you care what the past
[1:06:53] is let the past be the
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:07:02] past and the Amplified is said I do not
[1:07:04] consider Brethren that have captured and
[1:07:06] made it my own
[1:07:08] yet watch so what we preaching here has
[1:07:12] to be captured by you and made your own
[1:07:16] some of you haven't done that yet you
[1:07:18] com to church you're hearing the gospel
[1:07:20] It's s and good it's not yours yet until
[1:07:22] you cap it yes and when you capture it
[1:07:25] it becomes yours then you can fight
[1:07:28] because it's yours and yeah know devil
[1:07:30] take it back I remember opposite Cinema
[1:07:33] some vagrant person my wife was going to
[1:07:34] buy something in the bakery opposite and
[1:07:36] he snatch her bag and she snatch it
[1:07:37] right back I say oh God that's my wife
[1:07:40] she stand up and freeze some vagrant
[1:07:42] snatch her back and she snatch it right
[1:07:43] back that's what you have to begin to do
[1:07:45] the devil take it from you take it right
[1:07:47] back don't just stand up and freeze take
[1:07:49] it back you have to fight for what you
[1:07:52] know is your own oh give the Lord some
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:08:03] Praises so Paul is saying here I do not
[1:08:05] consider Brethren that I've captured and
[1:08:08] made it my own yet but one thing I do it
[1:08:12] is my one aspiration forgetting what
[1:08:14] lies behind and straining forward to
[1:08:18] what lies
[1:08:19] ahead not sitting down on your
[1:08:21] expecting you for to drop on your
[1:08:27] I hope this rock this
[1:08:30] entitlement some Mur is a killer thing
[1:08:32] you
[1:08:33] know children have it people have it
[1:08:36] church members have it what they
[1:08:38] entitled to what yeah and they figure
[1:08:42] you know the parents labor what children
[1:08:43] want everything they labor they just
[1:08:46] they come like the prod son say Daddy
[1:08:48] Minds what mind you work
[1:08:51] fit but because he's his son he's here
[1:08:54] he say you know yeah give me now don't
[1:08:57] wait for your dead to give me give me
[1:08:58] now and he blow it away all right so I
[1:09:01] press towards the goal to win the
[1:09:05] Supreme Heavenly prize to which God in
[1:09:07] Christ Jesus is going us upward all
[1:09:09] right so we have to have
[1:09:11] targets we have to have goals you have
[1:09:14] to have what you're aiming at because if
[1:09:16] you have no Target no goal you'll get
[1:09:17] there very fast you don't know when you
[1:09:19] reach because you have no target to goal
[1:09:21] yes you reaching when you see have a
[1:09:24] Target and goal you have to press you
[1:09:27] have to get there and you know you know
[1:09:29] you will know when you get there so the
[1:09:32] ministry has to have a Target and go
[1:09:34] also it's not just we and this thing
[1:09:36] together in that way but the ministry
[1:09:38] have to Target and the church have to
[1:09:41] Target individuals have have a Target

[1:24:56] is not trying something now in other
[1:24:58] words you know proph say you cannot live
[1:25:00] higher than your pastor right that means
[1:25:02] he has to enter first he has to die out
[1:25:05] first he has to go aead he can't say go
[1:25:08] forward Brethren go no he has to go
[1:25:11] first so now how are you going to pray
[1:25:14] for him
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:17] now now that I'm showing this to you how
[1:25:21] are you going to pray for that man of
[1:25:23] God had have to stand behind here to
[1:25:24] bring the word to
[1:25:29] you it's not a game it's not a play
[1:25:33] thing it's not be trying a thing it's
[1:25:34] not
[1:25:38] thatall 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse1
[1:25:42] says if you want to can find it 2
[1:25:44] Corinthians 4:1 says
[1:25:46] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:25:49] as we have received Mercy we faint not
[1:25:52] but have renounced the hidden things of
[1:25:54] dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor
[1:25:58] handling the word of God deceitfully but
[1:26:00] by manifestation of the truth commending
[1:26:03] ourselves to Every Man's conscience in
[1:26:06] the sight of God and if our gospel be
[1:26:08] here is H them that are lost in whom the
[1:26:10] God of this world had blinded the minds
[1:26:13] of them which believe not lead the light
[1:26:15] of their glorious gospel of Christ who
[1:26:17] is in the image of God to shine up unto
[1:26:19] them for we preach not ourselves this is
[1:26:22] Paul speaking here but Christ Jesus the
[1:26:24] Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:26:28] Jesus sake for God who commanded the
[1:26:31] light the shine of Darkness had shine in
[1:26:33] our hearts to give the light of the
[1:26:35] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:26:38] face of Jesus Christ and we have this
[1:26:40] Earth as when we have this treasure in
[1:26:43] Earth vessels that the Excellency of the
[1:26:46] power maybe of God and not of us we are
[1:26:48] troubled on every side yet not
[1:26:50] distressed we are perplexed but not and
[1:26:52] despar persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:26:55] down but not destroyed always B about in
[1:26:58] the body the dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:01] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:27:03] manifest in our body for we which live
[1:27:06] are always delivered unto death for
[1:27:07] Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus
[1:27:10] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:27:12] flesh look at verse 12 here now so then
[1:27:15] death worketh in us but life in you am
[1:27:20] do you see what Paul said here now yes
[1:27:23] oh God hallelujah praise God and this in
[1:27:25] he Amplified I'll do skip it down Paul
[1:27:29] says here now he said we are pursued
[1:27:31] okay all so verse eight in the ampli
[1:27:33] says we are hedged in pressed on every
[1:27:35] side troubled and oppressed in every way
[1:27:37] but not cramped or crushed we suffer
[1:27:41] embarrassment and are perplexed unable
[1:27:43] to find a way out but not driven to
[1:27:45] despair who said the minister have to
[1:27:47] have all the answers I don't and I don't
[1:27:50] try to have all the answers I don't have
[1:27:52] all the answers God hold all the answers
[1:27:55] I will answer what I could I will see
[1:27:57] how I could help but in reality God hold
[1:27:59] the answers we're not preaching
[1:28:01] ourselves and trying to have all the
[1:28:02] answers and the key to your life that's
[1:28:04] foolishness I'm a tkey I have the key to
[1:28:06] your life God have the key to your life
[1:28:08] oh give the Lord some Praises come on
[1:28:11] now we are perplexed and unable to find
[1:28:14] our way out but not driven to
[1:28:16] dispar you can't find a way out don't
[1:28:18] give up don't backslide as God brother
[1:28:22] talk about job he said he couldn't hear
[1:28:24] from God but the devil could move
[1:28:26] him we are pursued persecuted and hard
[1:28:29] driven but not deserted to stand alone
[1:28:32] we are struck down to the ground but
[1:28:34] never struck out and destroyed all right
[1:28:37] verse 11 in the Amplified for we who are
[1:28:39] live are constantly experiencing being
[1:28:41] handed over for debt for jesus' sake
[1:28:43] that the Resurrection Life of Jesus may
[1:28:45] also be evidence to our flesh which is
[1:28:48] liable to death thus Deb is actively at
[1:28:51] work in us but it is in order that our
[1:28:54] life may be actively at work in you oh
[1:28:57] blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm
[1:28:59] going to find out that part of in his
[1:29:01] tou a perfect man you talking about
[1:29:03] build me up into this oh Lord let Christ
[1:29:05] be my head upon my Foundation of faith
[1:29:07] and let his virtue pour out that flow
[1:29:10] out that I may able to teach those so he
[1:29:13] is showing that the virtues these Seven
[1:29:15] Virtues these Virtues Of Christ must be
[1:29:17] in the manner of God that it could flow
[1:29:19] out to the Believers and that is how you
[1:29:22] connected in the reality because when
[1:29:24] Peter went to the house of Cornelius and
[1:29:26] was preaching the word while Peter yet

[1:34:39] know when I'm preaching the word is God
[1:34:41] being
[1:34:43] preached Sometimes some couple years ago
[1:34:45] I was in the Congo and Pastor was
[1:34:47] telling me look at them some of them
[1:34:49] have the other gods
[1:34:52] the
[1:34:55] idol you dealing with
[1:34:57] that the culture have the gods and the
[1:35:01] witch doctor and what kind of thing they
[1:35:02] have their gods they have little Idol
[1:35:04] and thing and they have they still come
[1:35:05] to church Hallelujah Glory Jesus you see
[1:35:07] what happened to them Jesus is another
[1:35:09] one of
[1:35:10] that did you hear what I just said to
[1:35:13] them Jesus is another one where they
[1:35:15] have there if they Jesus in Idol form
[1:35:17] they take Jesus and put
[1:35:20] through yes so that is why when you come
[1:35:23] you have to learn of him because you
[1:35:26] don't know him God is a good God all the
[1:35:28] time don't talk that kind of talk
[1:35:29] somebody make that kind of talk god is
[1:35:31] the word because that good God all the
[1:35:33] time tell Adam the day you eat there's a
[1:35:35] son Father and Son talking you know he
[1:35:37] said of the Tre eat all but the day you
[1:35:39] eat thereof that day you shall surely
[1:35:42] die hey so God does keep his word he
[1:35:46] doesn't play word games he doesn't play
[1:35:48] gymnastics with words he just keep his
[1:35:50] word his yeah is yeah his n is near his
[1:35:53] Blessing is blessing his curse is
[1:35:56] curses do I shou in the house do I hear
[1:36:00] the Christians here saying
[1:36:01] [Applause]
[1:36:13] amen you know people don't believe in
[1:36:16] demons in this day but the thing to do
[1:36:18] is to my opinion is to know your enemy
[1:36:21] and train for the contest that you're
[1:36:24] going to have when you meet
[1:36:26] him because are you ready yes you're
[1:36:29] going to meet
[1:36:31] him see amen going
[1:36:36] soon not Santa Claus you're going to
[1:36:38] meet
[1:36:41] him every Christmas time you can meet
[1:36:43] him he the man is wear little hat little
[1:36:47] put some size and different kind of
[1:36:49] things red and white you can could meet
[1:36:51] him any Christmas time
[1:36:53] yes with the white beard but this
[1:36:57] devil guarantee to meet him so get ready
[1:37:02] get your act together because you have
[1:37:04] to meet
[1:37:07] him that has nothing do with me you know
[1:37:10] I see people have problems husband
[1:37:12] problem wife problem children problem
[1:37:13] what and I ask myself the question if
[1:37:15] you get rid of your husband that g in
[1:37:16] trouble does that solve your a problem
[1:37:19] the answer is no husband this husband
[1:37:21] that he this he this he he this he
[1:37:24] this and you are not that but you know
[1:37:27] is this and that to makeup
[1:37:30] better but poting fer
[1:37:34] this what
[1:37:38] about if I tell you some many counseling
[1:37:41] I have done and some many cons I run
[1:37:43] straight out of and never to go back
[1:37:45] again you w believe
[1:37:50] it woo
[1:37:52] so you have to train for the contests
[1:37:53] that you're going to have when you meet
[1:37:55] him because you're going to meet him and
[1:37:58] know him know what his strength is and
[1:38:01] then train for this contest when you're
[1:38:03] going to meet him for it's one thing
[1:38:05] sure you're going to meet him so train
[1:38:07] for the contest you'll be foolish if you
[1:38:11] ignore this word to train for this
[1:38:14] battle you'll be foolish because things
[1:38:16] are looking shiny right now for you the
[1:38:19] sun is in your back and things are
[1:38:20] working out and everything else and you
[1:38:22] think that will be full
[1:38:25] forever that's why B Brandon says black
[1:38:27] skies are not signs of God
[1:38:31] disapproval nor bright Skies signs of
[1:38:34] God's approval his approval is in Christ
[1:38:38] The
[1:38:38] Beloved whether you have bright Skies or
[1:38:41] Dark
[1:38:42] Skies Oh Glory to God when job was
[1:38:45] seeing his Nightmare Child he was
[1:38:48] approved by God that's why he got it you
[1:38:51] had to pull Satan from running to and
[1:38:53] from deceiving people to say look at my
[1:38:55] servant here there is none like him in
[1:38:57] Trinidad there is none like him in all
[1:38:58] the Earth whatever country there is none
[1:39:00] like him and he could pull the Satan and
[1:39:02] look at the bride there is none like her
[1:39:04] you can't deceive her you can't get her
[1:39:06] she going to stand anyhow she going to
[1:39:08] stand fortified she is not only just
[1:39:10] going to be behind the word she will
[1:39:12] become the word
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:17] itself
[1:39:19] glory glory to God hallelujah hallelujah

[1:39:24] message no part of this Earth no part of
[1:39:26] this world I've been all over that
[1:39:28] anybody after service come and say what

[1:39:34] see never have to ex what you mean by
[1:39:37] what you say are saying what the word
[1:39:38] say Amen so I had to mean nothing
[1:39:41] because men put in the interpretation
[1:39:43] and you have to ask questions and you
[1:39:44] get confus in their mind no confusion
[1:39:47] the word supposed to be coming clearer
[1:39:49] and clearer and clearer to you and I
[1:39:51] it's supposed to becomeing more simpler

[1:39:55] fool heard in daring not not even a fool
[1:39:58] could H with this Clarity of the vision
[1:40:01] the prophetic Vision that the prophet
[1:40:03] released he said write the vision make

[1:45:30] fatherhood as such I had to get it from
[1:45:31] the scriptures that's why I connect with
[1:45:33] Proverbs I was joined from how God is
[1:45:35] the father how I was taking the word
[1:45:37] husband love your wife I was taking the
[1:45:39] word to provide for your family I was
[1:45:41] committed to what God Said and I had the

[1:46:09] Hallelujah
[1:46:10] Glory Hallelujah
[1:46:14] Hallelujah so you have to train have to
[1:46:17] fight smart so the first decision God
[1:46:19] give his people in the garden of
[1:46:21] to combat the enemy was his word they
[1:46:23] were fortified with his word now the
[1:46:25] enemy is going to study our strategy
[1:46:27] with the word Satan studied that so
[1:46:29] perfectly that when he come to Eve he
[1:46:31] had the best strategy he could use upon
[1:46:34] her that was to reason with the word you
[1:46:37] know I used to think intellectual spirit
[1:46:38] is people who had no education car read
[1:46:40] car right I used to think so in the
[1:46:41] early times but I recognize
[1:46:43] intellectualism is a spirit somebody
[1:46:46] could can't read and car write and they
[1:46:47] still intellectual it have to do with
[1:46:49] reasoning
[1:46:51] that's what indect have to do reasoning
[1:46:53] so when he asked what did God says
[1:46:56] serpent the Eve was saying back what her
[1:46:58] husband told her go Eve was not dear
[1:47:01] when God spoke to Adam that mean Adam
[1:47:03] taught Eve and shared with Eve the
[1:47:05] revelation of what the tree to eat and
[1:47:09] Eve said the same thing what the tape
[1:47:11] say she said the same thing what Adam
[1:47:13] said and Satan said You shall not he
[1:47:16] shall have a iner insertion you shall
[1:47:18] not surely die
[1:47:21] and she believed that not and then she
[1:47:24] was
[1:47:25] not she lost her life then Adam lost his

[1:47:31] are here right now and the deed of the
[1:47:33] Earth was lost and that's what went up
[1:47:35] in the hands of the original owner and
[1:47:37] that is where the Bible in Book of
[1:47:38] Revelation says who is worthy to take
[1:47:39] the book because we need that book to
[1:47:42] get back rights on the
[1:47:44] earth 10 say I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:47:46] come down from heaven clo with a cloud
[1:47:49] and a rainbow around his head and he had
[1:47:52] a book open and he come down with that
[1:47:54] book and your name was in that book

[1:48:01] dead but your name is on the book that
[1:48:03] is why you believe this enti message

[1:48:29] genealogy and all of a sudden and this
[1:48:32] is from 1 cortical chapter 4 he
[1:48:34] interrupted this with this word and C
[1:48:38] begat anab and zohab and the families of
[1:48:41] AEL and the son of Haram and then verse
[1:48:45] 9 that's verse 8 all of a sudden and
[1:48:47] jabz was more honorable than his
[1:48:49] brethren he interrupt genology to put a
[1:48:53] title or a tag on this man called jabz

[1:55:55] thought for what is honest and proper
[1:55:57] and Noble and so
[1:55:58] on that's enough and Jesus said
[1:56:01] recommend uh Romans 12:17 says
[1:56:04] recommends no man evil for evil provide
[1:56:06] things honest in the sight of all men
[1:56:08] but on that good Ground Luke 8:15 are
[1:56:11] they which in an honest and good heart
[1:56:13] having heard the word keep it and bring
[1:56:15] forth fruit with patience so that's the
[1:56:17] heart condition nothing wrong with the
[1:56:18] word nothing wrong with the seed is what
[1:56:20] is the heart's condition that you would
[1:56:22] bless me that he knew God was the source
[1:56:24] of his Blessing do you know who's the
[1:56:26] source of your blessing you think it's
[1:56:27] your boss and your P suppose they fire
[1:56:29] from your work now then your blessing
[1:56:31] fall it's blessing done but if you know
[1:56:34] God is the source of your blessing then
[1:56:36] you could know who you're going through
[1:56:37] to bless you when God bless you you know
[1:56:39] it's God that blessed you he say enlarge
[1:56:42] my territory and he said that your hand
[1:56:45] be upon me you want God's guidance when
[1:56:48] you're relishing your own self this is
[1:56:50] what I do and I do and you get you
[1:56:52] that's you that's not God guidance but
[1:56:54] this man was praying for God guidance
[1:56:56] and then an important one Keep Me From
[1:56:58] Evil and harm protection Oh Glory to God
[1:57:02] so you could see he was a humble person
[1:57:04] he had Faith despite of his name and I
[1:57:07] have this here he did not allow the
[1:57:09] conditions around him and his name of
[1:57:12] Sorrow Define him and you must not let
[1:57:15] your past Define who you are you cannot
[1:57:17] let your failure Define Who You Are you
[1:57:19] must let the word Define who you are
[1:57:22] believe what the word say about you
[1:57:25] believe he has forgiven you believe
[1:57:27] he'll restore you believe you'll come
[1:57:29] out your backsliding believe you would
[1:57:31] be the head and not the tail oh give the
[1:57:33] Lord some Praises glory to God so jabz
[1:57:37] went against the Green this is going
[1:57:39] against all ODS when nothing is going
[1:57:41] well for you oh praise God and I read
[1:57:43] this but I'm say he said God want you to
[1:57:45] ask for big things he said God want have
[1:57:47] blessings isn't that right and Jesus
[1:57:49] Jesus said lead us not into temptation
[1:57:50] but Deliver Us from Evil for that is the
[1:57:52] kingdom and power and the glory so you
[1:57:54] want you to be conscious evil is a wrong
[1:57:57] and you have to ask for God protection
[1:57:58] you have to be sensitive enough that
[1:58:00] there's a devil that want to tra trap
[1:58:02] you and pull you in amen all right turn
[1:58:04] your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:58:06] 10 we take some time to get here this is
[1:58:10] just above what we had read about Paul
[1:58:13] identifying like a as a as a as a a race
[1:58:16] to run praise God
[1:58:22] all right so we just read in in in the
[1:58:24] scriptures every man that striveth for
[1:58:26] the Mastery is temperate all things and
[1:58:28] Paul said I run I therefore so run not
[1:58:31] uncertainly not as one beat of the air
[1:58:33] but I bring my body in subjection and
[1:58:36] then the next chapter begin to detail
[1:58:38] these things here now 1 Corinthians
[1:58:40] chapter 10 moreover
[1:58:44] Brethren and I want you to understand
[1:58:47] that we're talking to about the false s
[1:58:49] sense of security look at what God is
[1:58:52] saying here moreover Brethren 1
[1:58:54] Corinthians chap 10:1 I would not that
[1:58:56] you be ignorant how that all our fathers
[1:58:58] were under the cloud and all passed
[1:59:00] through the sea all was in the message
[1:59:02] all baptized into Moses in the cloud and
[1:59:05] the Sea all eat the same spiritual meat
[1:59:07] had the same books and tapes all drink
[1:59:09] the same spiritual drink this Drank of
[1:59:11] the spiritual rocks that follow them
[1:59:12] which was Christ and with many of them
[1:59:14] God was not well pleased for they were
[1:59:17] overthrown in the wilderness
[1:59:19] this the journey yeah this not the
[1:59:22] promised land yet this the journey they
[1:59:23] got overthrown all right now these
[1:59:27] things were our
[1:59:29] examples to the intent we should not
[1:59:33] lust after evil things as they also
[1:59:35] lusted neither be idolators as some of
[1:59:38] them as is written the people sat down
[1:59:40] to eat and drink and Rose up to play now
[1:59:43] they're playing
[1:59:44] games on the
[1:59:46] computer Idol they're not praying
[1:59:48] they're playing
[1:59:50] games neither verse 8 let us commit
[1:59:54] fornication as some of them committed
[1:59:56] and fell in one day three and 20,000
[1:59:58] neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[2:00:00] them also tempted and were destroy of
[2:00:02] serpents neither M ye Mur ye as some of
[2:00:05] them murmured and were destroyed of the
[2:00:07] Destroyer now all these things happen
[2:00:09] unto them for examples that they are
[2:00:12] written for our admonition upon whom the
[2:00:15] ends of the world are come now look he's
[2:00:17] drilling down further wherefore let him
[2:00:20] that think that he standed take heed L
[2:00:23] he

[2:00:28] temptation taking you but such as come
[2:00:31] unto man but God is faithful amen who
[2:00:34] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[2:00:36] and be able but will with the Temptation
[2:00:39] also make a way of Escape that you may
[2:00:42] be able to Bear it oh praise God you
[2:00:45] made me amen so I will um just want to
[2:00:48] highlight something here in the
[2:00:49] Amplified it gives more flesh to this
[2:00:51] whole thing it says do not be
[2:00:52] worshippers verse 7 in Amplified of
[2:00:54] false gods as some of them were as

[2:21:07] wherein have you robbed me in ties and
[2:21:08] offering ye are cursed with a curse for
[2:21:12] you have robbed me even this whole
[2:21:14] nation bring ye all the tights into the
[2:21:16] storehouse
[2:21:18] that there may be meat in my house and
[2:21:20] prove me now here with sayth the Lord of
[2:21:22] hosts if I will not open you the windows
[2:21:27] of heaven and pour you out a blessing
[2:21:30] that there shall not be enough room
[2:21:33] enough to receive it Proverbs 3:9-10
[2:21:36] honor thy Lord with thy substance and
[2:21:39] with the first fruits of thy increase so
[2:21:41] shall thy bands be filled with plenty
[2:21:43] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[2:21:45] wine question
[2:21:47] but brandham don't you feel that

[2:22:06] and I will not open the windows of
[2:22:08] heaven and pour out a blessing there be
[2:22:10] enough enough room enough to receive
[2:22:12] that's a challenge to any individual If

[2:22:35] have never seen in my life that any man
[2:22:39] or woman that if you only make $1 a week
[2:22:42] will bring the 10 cents of that money
[2:22:45] and put it into the storehouse your
[2:22:47] church where you come if God don't bless
[2:22:49] that call me a hypocrite that's a
[2:22:52] challenge to anybody and every question
[2:22:55] and every Christian every Christian
[2:22:58] should pay ties question should a person
[2:23:00] pay tis to an individual or should a
[2:23:02] Christian work he's the one man that
[2:23:04] will work as a Christian so he's showing
[2:23:07] that a Christian is not a lazy person a
[2:23:09] re Christian is not a lazy person a re
[2:23:11] Christian will work amen pay tax to an
[2:23:15] individual depends on who an individual
[2:23:16] is he said in Hebrews the 7th chapter
[2:23:18] when Abraham returned from the slaugh of
[2:23:20] the king he paid him tits that was mezc
[2:23:23] the king of selem he said but really
[2:23:25] here this go where you owe Titans is
[2:23:29] where you get your food where you feed
[2:23:31] from so if you're feeding here here is
[2:23:33] where you're supposed to contribute and
[2:23:35] support that's how you become a support
[2:23:36] here because this is where you're
[2:23:38] feeding from right is where you ow
[2:23:41] Titans where you get your food you're
[2:23:42] bringing all your tit in my Storehouse
[2:23:44] that's right and prove me sayth the Lord
[2:23:46] pra praise God but said I believe in
[2:23:49] pain tights is one of God's blessings
[2:23:52] that's proven to be a
[2:23:54] blessing he said I remember a time I was
[2:23:57] sick and once I was a boy I came out to
[2:23:59] the hospital owing $2,000 I used to be
[2:24:02] in a drugstore here Mr swaniger I owed
[2:24:03] him $
[2:24:04] 3400 a medic medicine Bill he didn't
[2:24:07] even know me and I went to him I didn't
[2:24:09] know him he just sent it to me and I
[2:24:11] never refused to send it I said I owe
[2:24:13] you he said Mr Bon down Court Avenue and
[2:24:16] spring I said I owe for you I'm just
[2:24:18] awfully weak but I'm trying to go to
[2:24:20] work now I can't pay you now I I just
[2:24:24] become a Christian I said to him the
[2:24:26] first thing Mr Mason as my duty to God I
[2:24:28] owe him my tights I want to pay my tit
[2:24:30] and first then my next duty is pay my
[2:24:33] debts I said my father is sickly and
[2:24:36] there's 10 of us children in the family
[2:24:37] and if I can't pay you no more than 25
[2:24:39] cents on that bill and each PD and
[2:24:41] that's how we organize it all right so I
[2:24:43] just want to share that with you because
[2:24:45] I know some of you don't know and I will
[2:24:46] share sh that you would know but here
[2:24:48] the part I want to get to chosen before
[2:24:51] the foundation of the world does that
[2:24:53] mean that you have no fight what are you
[2:24:57] entitled to in this message he says in
[2:25:00] Ephesians 1:4 according as he chosen in
[2:25:04] him before the foundation of the world
[2:25:06] that we should wholly Without Blame
[2:25:08] before in love having predestinated us
[2:25:11] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[2:25:13] Christ himself Accord his good pleasure
[2:25:14] of his will no fight where four second
[2:25:17] Peter 1:10 the rer Brethren give
[2:25:19] diligence to make your calling and
[2:25:22] election sure for if you do these things
[2:25:24] you will never fall what am I saying
[2:25:27] don't take nothing for granted don't be
[2:25:30] in this secure position where you figure
[2:25:34] because you believe it will just work
[2:25:36] out it takes a little more than that you
[2:25:39] have to act upon what is promise you
[2:25:41] have to act upon what your word declares
[2:25:44] praise God don't forsake the assembly
[2:25:47] yourself together why you missing
[2:25:48] Services be here because you don't know
[2:25:51] what God will speak and how God will
[2:25:53] minister to you at your the point of
[2:25:55] your need you don't know you have to
[2:25:57] make it more serious people committed to
[2:25:59] all kind of things you have to be
[2:26:00] committed to come to church and they
[2:26:01] committ commit to commit early to to
[2:26:03] pray up the service Oh Glory to God all
[2:26:07] right so I'm going to
[2:26:10] close this was something else that I was
[2:26:13] listening to from the SMA age which is
[2:26:15] the second age
[2:26:17] a irus virtue he was talking about smna
[2:26:21] means bitter and he said organization
[2:26:24] was growing a pace and the augmented
[2:26:27] debt of membership for Holy Ghost
[2:26:28] leadership was deposed and the Word was
[2:26:30] replaced by Crees and dogmas and when
[2:26:34] that Satan centered group was formed
[2:26:36] this is church people it begin to hate
[2:26:40] and to fight the True Believers
[2:26:42] insisting that they the aliens were the
[2:26:44] church of god notice how organization
[2:26:48] breathes hatred heang it destroys
[2:26:52] Fellowship it makes
[2:26:54] bitterness that's the organiz spirit
[2:26:57] that have in the message oh glory to God
[2:26:59] this is what SM means this is what SM
[2:27:02] was full of bitterness a root of
[2:27:04] bitterness defiles many that's why
[2:27:07] regardless of what somebody do you don't
[2:27:08] ever get bitter pray for them don't ever
[2:27:11] get bitter always pray for them don't
[2:27:15] get bitter at all because will drive the
[2:27:17] Holy Spirit from you you will lose the
[2:27:19] anointing the church too watch become a
[2:27:24] hybrid it wasn't so in the beginning
[2:27:26] instead of the straight word of God
[2:27:27] instead of spirit fill men in the church
[2:27:29] who were led by spirit-given Revelation
[2:27:32] there was now Creeds and bylaws educated
[2:27:36] guesses of educated men learning has
[2:27:39] taken the place of Revelation reason has
[2:27:41] replaced Faith program has replaced
[2:27:44] spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost
[2:27:47] and when the church gets away from the
[2:27:49] word it will believe anything and
[2:27:52] brother George we talk about that we
[2:27:54] lift to see that people believe in all
[2:27:56] kind of things all kind of things I
[2:27:59] wouldn't go into that because I I go to
[2:28:01] the negative too much of me I can't go
[2:28:03] there you know if I start with with bad
[2:28:05] dollars and bad counter feet money and
[2:28:07] thing we wouldn't finish we wouldn't
[2:28:09] close but I don't go in there at all we
[2:28:10] want to stick with the real dollar isn't
[2:28:11] that right now watch but brandham says
[2:28:14] here now oh boy
[2:28:17] churches set themselves up as Fountains
[2:28:20] of truth but the truth is not in them
[2:28:24] yet the begotten children swear by them
[2:28:27] and will even kill to uphold their error
[2:28:30] if you think that is exaggeration read 2
[2:28:33] Timothy chapter 3 I charged you
[2:28:35] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[2:28:37] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[2:28:38] dead as his appearent and his kingdom
[2:28:41] preach the word be instant in season out
[2:28:44] of season reprove rebuke exalt with all
[2:28:47] long suffering and Doctrine here we go
[2:28:49] for the time will come when they will
[2:28:52] not end your song Doctrine in this
[2:28:54] message but after their own loss in this
[2:28:56] message shall they keep to themselves
[2:28:58] teachers having itching ears and shall
[2:29:01] turn away their ears from the truth and
[2:29:04] turn into fables but watch th in all
[2:29:07] things andure afflictions do the work of
[2:29:09] evangelists make fruit proof of the
[2:29:12] ministry watch when the church almost
[2:29:15] done allow herself to move from the
[2:29:18] original like Adam and Eve Death
[2:29:21] setting still have people still have
[2:29:23] deacons still have Elders still have
[2:29:25] ushers still have the congregation but
[2:29:28] de listen to the effect there was no
[2:29:30] strength in her she has become a
[2:29:32] monstrosity the minute the church moved
[2:29:34] towards form and ceremony and towards
[2:29:36] priesthood by organizing the ministers
[2:29:38] into a group that decides the leadership
[2:29:41] apart from the Holy Spirit and his word
[2:29:43] the very moment death entered she got
[2:29:45] sick here we go brother George she
[2:29:48] changed to a powerless group of people
[2:29:50] whose only weapon was
[2:29:55] argument black man only weapon argument
[2:30:00] she could produce nothing in the spirit
[2:30:02] for our hopes were built on program and
[2:30:05] not fate in this word he said I know I
[2:30:09] know your pain I know your suffering he
[2:30:11] does but does he know hold back the
[2:30:13] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[2:30:17] no he does not he simply says I know
[2:30:20] your tribulation right with me we almost
[2:30:22] done I am not at all un mindful of your
[2:30:26] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[2:30:28] to so many people like Israel they
[2:30:31] wonder if God really loves them how can
[2:30:34] God be just and loving if he stands by
[2:30:37] and watches people suffer that is what
[2:30:40] they ask in Malachi 1 1:3 the burden of
[2:30:43] the word of the Lord to Israel by
[2:30:44] Malachi I have loved you say the the
[2:30:46] Lord yet we say wherein have thou love
[2:30:48] us was not Esau Jacob's brother yet the
[2:30:50] Lord said I love Jacob you see they
[2:30:53] could not figure out God's love here we
[2:30:55] go they thought yeah church that love
[2:30:59] meant no suffering they thought that
[2:31:02] love meant baby with parental care but
[2:31:04] God said his love was elective the proof
[2:31:08] of his love is election Hallelujah no
[2:31:10] matter what happened his love was proven
[2:31:13] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[2:31:14] under salvation because God has chosen
[2:31:17] you to Salvation through sanctification
[2:31:19] of the spirit and belief of the truth he
[2:31:21] may commit you to death like he did Paul
[2:31:23] he may commit you to suffering like he
[2:31:24] did job that is his prerogative he is
[2:31:27] suffereing but with all there's a
[2:31:29] purpose if he didn't have a purpose then
[2:31:31] he would be the author frustration and
[2:31:33] not peace his purpose is that after we
[2:31:36] have suffered a while we would be made
[2:31:39] perfect Oh Glory to God we not running
[2:31:41] in vain we not running and beaten in the
[2:31:43] air we have a purpose we have a aim we
[2:31:46] have a Target Oh Glory to God here's why
[2:31:49] here's why here's why he put strength in
[2:31:51] US you see Jes he himself Jesus
[2:31:55] suffered Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[2:31:57] hallelujah you want this car you buy it
[2:31:59] you want this house you buy it you want
[2:32:01] this airplane you buy you want this you
[2:32:03] get it yeah you suffing nothing you
[2:32:06] cool you
[2:32:07] spoiled but God wouldn't allow that
[2:32:09] though because God will have no spoiled
[2:32:12] children watch here now you see he
[2:32:15] himself suffered he learned obedience by
[2:32:17] the things which he suffered he was
[2:32:19] actually made perfect by the things that
[2:32:22] he suffered then he quoted Hebrews 58
[2:32:24] and9 though he were a son son yet
[2:32:27] learning obedience by the thing which he
[2:32:28] suffered and being made perfect he
[2:32:31] became author of Eternal salvation unto
[2:32:33] all them that obey him in plain language
[2:32:36] the very character of Jesus was
[2:32:38] perfected by
[2:32:42] suffering 10 people say amen in the
[2:32:44] whole church w my Lord my Lord my Lord
[2:32:47] you can hold back now know we almost
[2:32:48] done watch and according to Paul he left
[2:32:52] his church a measure of suffering that
[2:32:54] they too by their faith in God while
[2:32:56] suffering for him would come to a place
[2:32:59] of
[2:33:00] perfection Hallelujah question why would
[2:33:03] he want this James 1:2 my brethren count
[2:33:06] it all joy when you fall into D
[2:33:08] Temptations knowing this the trying of
[2:33:10] your faith worketh patience but let
[2:33:13] patience have a perfect work that you
[2:33:15] may be perfect an entire wanting nothing
[2:33:19] This is Gospel this is thing to shout
[2:33:22] about Oh Glory of God begin to play
[2:33:26] something why does he stand by the
[2:33:29] reason is Romans 8:17 to18 hear the
[2:33:32] scripture as we Clos if children then
[2:33:35] ears ears of God and Joint ISS with
[2:33:38] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[2:33:43] that we may be also glorified together
[2:33:46] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[2:33:48] present time are not worthy to be
[2:33:52] compared with the glory that shall be
[2:33:54] revealed in US unless we suffer with him
[2:33:57] we cannot reign with him you have to
[2:34:00] suffer to rain the reason for this is
[2:34:03] character simply is never made without
[2:34:06] suffering character is a victory not a
[2:34:09] gift a man without character can Reign
[2:34:12] because power apart from character is
[2:34:14] satanic but Power with character is fit
[2:34:17] to rule and since he wants us to share
[2:34:20] his throne on the same basis that he
[2:34:23] overcame and is sat down his father's
[2:34:25] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[2:34:27] with him and the little temporary
[2:34:30] suffering we go through now is not
[2:34:32] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[2:34:35] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[2:34:38] he comes what Treasures are laid up for
[2:34:40] those who are willing to enter into his
[2:34:42] kingdom through much tribulation may the
[2:34:44] Lord bless you could be stand
[2:34:46] and give God some praises and some

[2:34:51] you we thank you for your love we thank

[2:34:54] your spirit we don't want to run without
[2:34:56] a aim a definite aim where we going to
[2:34:59] Lord to Perfection that's why we go to
[2:35:02] trials and testings and tribulation give
[2:35:04] us the joy to conduct ourselves with joy
