[11:50] for this time of fellowship around your
[11:52] word and we pray you give us
[11:54] spiritual insight wisdom understanding
[11:56] and knowledge
[11:57] how to behave ourselves and conduct
[11:59] ourselves in this present time you're
[12:01] living in
[12:02] knowing that adoption and pleasing is
[12:04] based upon behavior
[12:05] granted lord and jesus may ask it email
[12:08] him and god bless you
[12:09] and welcome to our bible study tonight
[12:12] we are so appreciative
[12:13] of all of you being here tonight and i
[12:16] want to share testimony with you
[12:18] this is from our brother kelly salt from
[12:20] the usa he said dear brother
[12:23] i would like to report that the lord has
[12:25] graciously healed me
[12:26] of a long time affliction since about
[12:29] 2009
[12:31] i've had in my upper right jaw what felt
[12:33] like a sharp to take
[12:35] i've had to stay on pain relievers all
[12:37] day in order to work efficiently
[12:40] otherwise the pain would eventually
[12:42] bring tears to my eyes
[12:44] if i failed to take the pain relievers
[12:46] at night
[12:48] the pain would wake me up i had a root
[12:50] canal
[12:51] surgery two extractions second root
[12:54] canal
[12:55] in an effort to find relief from the
[12:57] pain all to no avail
[12:59] i do not recall exactly when the pain
[13:02] stopped
[13:03] but about two weeks ago or so i have
[13:05] forgotten to take my usual dose
[13:08] of pain relievers when i suddenly
[13:10] realized the pain was not there
[13:12] despite not having taken any medicine
[13:16] nor has it come back since i read this
[13:19] morning in the bible
[13:21] where the disciples had asked the lord
[13:23] jesus if a certain man was blind because
[13:25] of his or her
[13:27] his parents sin the lord answered that
[13:29] it was not
[13:30] because of his or his parents sin
[13:34] but at the works of god should we mean
[13:36] manifesting him
[13:37] i have to believe that my pain has
[13:40] existed these 10 years or so
[13:42] for the same reason that the works of
[13:45] god
[13:46] would be made manifest may god wish to
[13:48] bless you but i can't
[13:50] you certainly appreciate that testimony
[13:51] give god some praises
[13:53] god is a healer and uh it have what you
[13:56] call
[13:56] time of span miracles uh they have
[13:58] instant miracles
[14:00] but then you have the miracles that god
[14:02] works out in time
[14:04] and um it reminds me of the lepers
[14:07] uh when jesus said said go and show
[14:09] yourself to the priests
[14:10] and he didn't pray for them you just
[14:13] squander his life to the priest
[14:15] and along the way they will find
[14:17] themselves healed
[14:18] and this testimony here is very
[14:20] encouraging because it tells you
[14:22] never give up half feet in god trust the
[14:24] lord and god will work all things out
[14:26] for his honor
[14:27] and face glory you love him tonight or
[14:29] praise the lord
[14:30] so tonight that forced my lord to share
[14:33] something with you tonight and i
[14:35] i want to ephesians is still building on
[14:38] me
[14:40] uh ephesians to me is the target is the
[14:43] goal is where you want to get to
[14:45] so i want to title this get into
[14:47] ephesians
[14:48] get in to ephesians and we want to get
[14:52] to ephesians through corinthians
[14:55] hebrews galatians
[14:58] romans philippians colossians
[15:02] and then ephesians i choose these
[15:05] different
[15:06] churches if i could use that word
[15:09] reflecting different
[15:10] behaviors and attitudes different stages
[15:14] of your even your christian walk and you
[15:17] could see
[15:18] how god aim is perfection
[15:22] and the bible says
[15:25] when that which is perfect is come then
[15:28] that which is in part is done with it
[15:31] you know the people that was called by
[15:33] god
[15:34] the grouping that was called was the
[15:36] jews hebrews the jews
[15:39] and they were called by god and because
[15:42] the price wasn't paid yet or the
[15:44] sacrifice was
[15:45] made yet for sin the law
[15:49] was like a temporary uh
[15:52] place marko markow placeholder until
[15:56] the perfect sacrifice came and the price
[15:58] was paid at calvary
[16:00] so when israel came out of egypt
[16:03] and go tell them bring them to my
[16:06] mountain
[16:07] is because they had no clue what this
[16:10] god is about
[16:12] so god brought the law as a school
[16:14] master as a school teacher to keep them
[16:17] and the law exposed their sin and ways
[16:19] and misbehaving ways and everything else
[16:22] but christ was to come to pay the price
[16:26] and then their rejection of jesus
[16:28] brought an opening for us gentiles
[16:30] that is why we're here tonight because
[16:33] their rejection of christ
[16:34] open up a door that the gospel could go
[16:38] to the gentiles and here we are now we
[16:41] know there are seven churches i'm not
[16:42] trying to
[16:43] uh pluck this as seven churches as such
[16:46] i'm just trying to take a journey that
[16:49] the target
[16:50] and the goal is perfection
[16:54] now because we have come to christianity
[16:57] which is like luther and wesley and and
[17:00] pentecostals and different denominations
[17:03] it is sometimes so difficult
[17:06] to get people away from seeing
[17:09] church and see the prophetic vision
[17:13] that god has released by the open of the
[17:16] seven seals to see that vision of
[17:17] perfection
[17:19] and it is not a group it is not a
[17:22] building it is not a certain type of
[17:25] people then
[17:26] but is really coming back to the faith
[17:28] that was once delivered to these things
[17:30] because when god called abraham the the
[17:33] seed
[17:34] of abraham the real seed of abraham was
[17:36] his faith seed
[17:38] so this thing called faith is what
[17:41] started in
[17:42] genesis with that man called abraham
[17:45] because that same fate is what
[17:48] man fell from that sixth sense of faith
[17:51] and if you notice that is the the the
[17:54] current
[17:55] that flows through the scriptures is
[17:57] this fate of god
[17:59] now you might hear me of time uh
[18:01] preaching sermons and stuff and says
[18:02] that
[18:03] fate is god's currency if you go to
[18:05] mexico it's pesos
[18:07] if you go to america's u.s dollar you go
[18:09] to a french
[18:10] france french franc you cannot take your
[18:14] money
[18:15] and and spend it across in these
[18:16] countries you have to convert it
[18:19] and in the in the country of heaven or
[18:21] in the kingdom of god
[18:23] the currency's fate is not how long
[18:26] you're going to church
[18:28] it's not how old you are in the lord
[18:31] it's the currency of feet it's not uh
[18:34] somebody backslidden and how god blessed
[18:36] them like that
[18:37] his feet and if you notice jesus
[18:40] wasn't in the religious beat that so
[18:42] many people are in
[18:43] jesus never asks how long somebody in
[18:46] sin how long a backslide or this and
[18:48] that
[18:48] has really been made perfect will you be
[18:50] made whole uh do you want to be healed
[18:52] and so on and he just healing is sick
[18:54] anybody who are fit to believe the woman
[18:56] with the blood issue
[18:57] was not baptized believer was not a
[18:59] church-going person
[19:00] but the point about did she believe that
[19:02] she told herself if i could just touch
[19:04] him of his garment
[19:05] i'll be made whole so i want you to take
[19:07] and understand
[19:08] that regardless of what you're going
[19:09] through whether suffering pain
[19:11] uh better sickness challenges whatever
[19:13] you're going through
[19:14] faith still is the currency
[19:17] that that that get things from god
[19:21] this currency of faith and faith come by
[19:23] here in the world so as we share the
[19:24] word tonight i trust that your faith
[19:26] anger in your word
[19:27] because this is what the prophet came to
[19:29] reveal the very word of god so if you
[19:30] have your bibles
[19:31] i'd like to turn to first corinthians
[19:34] and chapter two
[19:36] i want to read from verse one first
[19:37] corinthians chapter two to get your
[19:39] bible
[19:39] we invite right tonight see how the lord
[19:42] will do what the lord will do
[19:43] uh with this get into ephesians
[19:46] and paul was saying he came not with
[19:49] excellency of speech
[19:50] because these were some tough churches
[19:52] it was a rough church this was a carnal
[19:54] church a natural church
[19:55] and you notice that in some of these
[19:58] epistles that paul wrote
[20:00] at the beginning he keep identifying his
[20:02] authority he's calling
[20:04] he's meeting the law pillar of fire and
[20:06] so on
[20:07] because these people not easy to deal
[20:09] with it wasn't just receiving you just
[20:10] like that
[20:11] and paul was explaining here how
[20:14] his approach was how he came to them not
[20:17] with accidental speech of wisdom
[20:19] he claimed the testimony of god by
[20:21] determined
[20:22] not to know anything among you save
[20:24] jesus christ and him crucified
[20:26] was three and i was with you in weakness
[20:30] and in fear and in much trembling
[20:33] this is something you don't see much of
[20:34] you see people without fear
[20:36] you see people arrogant you see people i
[20:38] don't want ministers no pastors
[20:40] uh so on carrying on but paul was saying
[20:44] that he was with you in weakness in fear
[20:46] and trembling
[20:47] and my speech and my preaching was not
[20:50] with enticing words of man's wisdom
[20:52] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[20:55] power
[20:56] and the purpose of that was that your
[20:58] fate
[20:59] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[21:01] but in the power of god
[21:03] so paul was saying this demonstration of
[21:06] the spirit
[21:07] this demonstration of power would
[21:09] activate people's faith in god that is
[21:11] the object of the gospel
[21:13] not faith in a man but faith
[21:16] in god now hope and i'll skip down you
[21:18] know
[21:19] now verse 11 he said for what man know
[21:22] the things of a man
[21:24] receive the spirit of a man which is in
[21:25] him even so the things of god knew it no
[21:28] man
[21:29] but the spirit of god for we have
[21:31] received
[21:32] not the spirit of the world but the
[21:35] spirit which is of god
[21:36] and we might that we might know the
[21:38] things that are freely given to us of
[21:40] god
[21:41] which things also we speak not in the
[21:44] words which man's wisdom teach it
[21:46] but which the holy ghost teach it
[21:48] comparing spiritual
[21:50] things with spiritual but the natural
[21:52] man
[21:53] receive it not the things of the spirit
[21:55] of god for their
[21:56] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[21:59] them
[22:00] because they are spiritually deserved
[22:02] but he has a spiritual
[22:04] judge at all things yet he himself is
[22:06] judge of no man
[22:08] for who had known the mind of the lord
[22:10] that we may struck him but we have the
[22:11] man of christ so paul
[22:13] was shown here that it take the spirit
[22:15] of god
[22:16] to reveal and to share and to show the
[22:18] things of god
[22:19] because these things are spiritually
[22:21] deserved but remember
[22:23] you're not a one-fold being you're three
[22:25] four being you have a body you have a
[22:26] spiritual soul
[22:28] that spirit in you is feeding on
[22:30] something you come in this room tonight
[22:33] because there is something in you
[22:35] calling for vitamins
[22:36] for strength for gospels as we call it
[22:39] for the word
[22:40] and and as you get the word now you get
[22:42] strengthened in your inner man
[22:44] just as you need natural food you need
[22:46] your breakfast your lunch and dinner
[22:48] to strengthen your natural man you need
[22:50] spiritual food to strengthen your inner
[22:52] man
[22:52] so then this is not just uh
[22:55] philosophizing or philosophy or vain
[22:57] philosophy
[22:58] but this is the word of life the word of
[23:00] truth but the devil's job
[23:02] is to make people feel that this world
[23:05] doesn't have power
[23:07] that we're just talking and just it's
[23:08] just but this is the will of the lord
[23:11] this is actually the word of the lord so
[23:13] let's go to chapter three
[23:15] of the same thing and he said i brethren
[23:18] could not speak unto you as unto
[23:19] spiritual
[23:20] but as something he was under bids
[23:24] in christ i have fed you with milk
[23:27] and not with meat hitter two you were
[23:30] not able to bear it
[23:32] neither yet no i evil so this bunch
[23:36] this group this church this corinthian
[23:39] church
[23:40] was a spiritual base so paul
[23:43] couldn't bring meat to them call paul
[23:46] couldn't bring
[23:47] mysteries to them he couldn't bring
[23:49] solid stuff to them
[23:50] and it tells you as where we start from
[23:53] we start as babes
[23:54] we start struggling we start you know
[23:57] but you can't stay babe
[23:59] you have to go when somebody have a baby
[24:01] the baby doesn't stay baby all the time
[24:04] baby drinking milk but the baby have to
[24:06] grow
[24:07] and what it tells you that you have to
[24:09] grow
[24:10] and i hope that tonight in reading and
[24:14] sharing
[24:15] that you will be able to look at your
[24:16] own life and ask yourself where are you
[24:18] at
[24:19] what church are you in are you in a
[24:20] corinthians church a roman church
[24:23] a galatians church a hebrew church what
[24:26] church are you in
[24:27] what church you want to belong to i'm
[24:29] not talking about a physical building
[24:31] i'm not talking about a physical group
[24:33] i'm talking about in spirit
[24:35] they said well you are colonel and
[24:37] foreigners there is among you
[24:39] yeah yeah yeah what is your kind of
[24:41] envying
[24:42] and strife and divisions are are not
[24:45] carnal
[24:46] and work as men for while one say it
[24:49] i am of paul another i'm of apollos
[24:54] so then you see what was happening here
[24:57] the believers the people
[24:58] was picking and choosing like it was a a
[25:01] handsome contest or a good-looking
[25:03] contest or a better preaching contest
[25:05] or whatever it is and they were saying i
[25:07] am our paul
[25:09] that's when i'm apollos everybody
[25:10] picking who they like
[25:12] he said who then is poor
[25:15] who is apollos but ministers
[25:19] by whom you believe even as the lord
[25:22] give to every man
[25:24] i have planted apollos water but
[25:28] god give it to increase give the
[25:31] increase
[25:31] so there is neither he that planted
[25:32] anything neither he that
[25:34] water it but is god that give it the
[25:37] increase
[25:38] now he had planted and he had watered a
[25:39] one and every man shall receive his own
[25:41] reward
[25:42] according to his labor so paul was
[25:45] presenting himself
[25:47] as a servant of christ in a particular
[25:50] position
[25:52] of a saw one that saw and won that water
[25:56] a polish water he was showing that his
[25:59] office didn't need any high rank or
[26:02] position to say
[26:03] i am of a paul and our apollos no
[26:06] he was showing the calling of god and
[26:09] how it works in harmony
[26:10] one soul one water what is god
[26:13] that give it the increase so he was not
[26:16] pointing people to himself
[26:18] he explained that before his preaching
[26:20] is to point them
[26:21] to the power of god that they can have
[26:23] more faith in god
[26:25] because you see when you begin to see
[26:26] god operating in your life
[26:29] or around your life your faith begins to
[26:32] grow
[26:32] because faith doesn't only come by
[26:34] hearing the word faith also come by
[26:36] experience
[26:37] so when you begin to experience the
[26:39] operation of god
[26:40] around you and in your life your faith
[26:44] in god begins to grow and it becomes
[26:47] stronger
[26:48] and you become a stronger christian
[26:50] because you get an
[26:51] anchor that he is alive he is not dead
[26:54] he is active in your life in your
[26:57] natural life
[26:58] he has protect you he has kept you he
[27:00] opened doors for you he make a way for
[27:02] you when you're not looking for this
[27:04] you open that to you and you're blessed
[27:07] and when you begin to see that
[27:09] you wake up next morning with a
[27:10] confidence that god has
[27:12] with you yesterday he's the god today
[27:14] and he's be god for you tomorrow
[27:16] so even though things crash today your
[27:19] expectation and faith is in him
[27:21] that will be there for you the next day
[27:23] so i want you to share with you
[27:25] verse chapter five you think of the time
[27:27] five verse one
[27:28] this is paul this is church now paul
[27:32] chapter five verse one you see it is
[27:33] reported commonly that is fornication
[27:35] among you
[27:36] such fornication as is not even named
[27:39] among the gentiles so israel's slackness
[27:41] that one should have his father's wife
[27:43] and ye are puffed up
[27:45] i have not rather moaned and he that had
[27:47] done this deed might be taken away from
[27:49] among you
[27:50] for i verily i'm absent in body but
[27:53] present in spirit
[27:54] have judged already as do i were present
[27:56] concerning him
[27:58] that has sowed on this deed in the name
[28:00] of our lord jesus christ
[28:02] when you are gathered together by my
[28:04] spirit with the power of our lord jesus
[28:05] christ
[28:06] you deliver such a war unto satan for
[28:08] the destruction of the flesh
[28:10] that the spirit might be saved in the
[28:12] day of the lord jesus
[28:14] your glory is not good know ye not
[28:17] at a little level level of the whole
[28:19] lamp so the church
[28:20] the corinthian church had worked on a
[28:22] sexual sins
[28:23] organized things of the flesh and paul
[28:26] harris to deal with that
[28:28] so i start off with this church on
[28:31] our way to ephesians because this church
[28:34] represents the bottom of the barrel
[28:36] where church behavior and life is
[28:39] concerned
[28:40] first corinthians chapter 6 if you have
[28:41] a bible flip to chapter 6 and listen
[28:44] to verse 9 and we're going to read on
[28:46] 1911
[28:47] of chapter 6 he says know ye not that
[28:51] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[28:53] kingdom of god
[28:54] be not deceive neither fornicators nor
[28:56] either letters no adulterers no
[28:58] effeminate which is homosexuals
[29:01] no abusers of themselves with mankind
[29:04] no thieves no covetous no drunkards
[29:08] no revilers no extortions shall inherit
[29:11] the kingdom of god
[29:13] but such will some of you
[29:16] were some of you but he are washed
[29:21] and he are sanctified but he had
[29:23] justified
[29:24] in the name of the lord jesus by the
[29:26] spirit of our god
[29:28] and we go to chapter 10 now so he was
[29:31] telling them and identifying
[29:32] all this behavior that can't inherit no
[29:35] kingdom of god
[29:36] that not going into kingdom of god that
[29:38] is what how you was
[29:39] you don't want to be like that now you
[29:41] want to see a change or change
[29:43] life a change talk change world and this
[29:45] particular chapter is one that always
[29:47] moved me
[29:48] this chapter 10. moreover brethren i
[29:52] would not have you ignorant
[29:53] this one or that our fathers were under
[29:55] the cloud and
[29:56] all pass through the sea verse two all
[29:59] baptized into the moses in the clouds
[30:01] and see
[30:01] first three all eat of the same spirit
[30:04] in me
[30:04] who is four all drink of the same
[30:06] spiritual drink first five
[30:08] and with many of them god was not well
[30:11] pleased
[30:12] for they were overthrown in the
[30:13] wilderness now these things
[30:16] were our examples to the intent we
[30:19] should not lost after evil things as
[30:21] they also lusted
[30:22] neither be idolaters as some of them as
[30:24] is written the people sat down to eat
[30:26] and drink and lose up the plane
[30:28] they then let us commit fornication as
[30:30] somebody committed and fell in one day
[30:31] three and twenty thousand
[30:33] neither let us tempt christ as some of
[30:35] them also tempted
[30:36] and would destroy of siblings neither
[30:38] mummy
[30:39] as some of them also remembered i were
[30:41] destroyed of a destroyer
[30:42] now all these things here we go happen
[30:44] unto them for examples
[30:46] and they are written for our admonisher
[30:49] they are written for what
[30:50] our admonition upon whom
[30:53] the ends of the world are come wherefore
[30:56] that him
[30:56] the thinkity standard take heed less e4
[31:00] so i'll share my wife you know and we
[31:03] always talk about it
[31:04] how people live in this world with a
[31:07] sense of permanence
[31:08] and deceived permanence like if they're
[31:11] here forever
[31:12] like they will always will be here and
[31:16] you know it is so troubling to
[31:18] especially christians to see christians
[31:20] in arrogance and in pride and like they
[31:24] want to cut this one off and treat this
[31:26] one this way and that way
[31:27] and they don't hold time in their hands
[31:30] you don't hold time he hold you in his
[31:33] hands
[31:35] you are kept by him holding you
[31:39] not you holding yourself he holding you
[31:42] if he pulls his hands off we fall
[31:45] so to me it it is something
[31:48] when you begin to weigh your own life
[31:51] then
[31:52] and you walk in a way where
[31:55] you know you're grateful and you are
[31:58] thankful
[32:00] every day lord i thank you i thank you
[32:03] for your love i thank you
[32:04] for your grace your mercy it's just the
[32:06] grace of god it's the
[32:07] mercies of god so you have to study all
[32:10] these things happen
[32:11] for example we have been admonished
[32:14] to take heed because man is still money
[32:17] from genesis monster lustin man is the
[32:20] lion
[32:21] man still doing evil that man is not
[32:24] unless god
[32:25] the holy spirit change a man's heart is
[32:27] he saying man
[32:29] the man walking in longer man walking on
[32:32] on camel and whatever he say man
[32:35] he's just driving a car now he's just
[32:38] flying planes now
[32:40] he's just wearing jacket and taino but
[32:42] it is his sea man
[32:44] okay let's go to hebrews chapter five
[32:48] so we just jump in we
[32:52] leave from corinthians we're going to
[32:53] hebrews and
[32:55] we want to read verse 8 of hebrews after
[32:57] fact
[32:58] speaking about jesus do he was a son
[33:01] so sonship doesn't mean you're immune
[33:03] from stuff
[33:05] you can't claim like um how a lot of
[33:08] people do
[33:08] when they figure out how to say it
[33:12] is their right uh like if you know they
[33:15] they they they're being owed something
[33:18] they say right
[33:19] he said though he were a son yet
[33:22] learning obedience by the things that he
[33:25] suffered
[33:25] this year it could be a whole message on
[33:27] this scripture this line here
[33:29] though he was son he learned he
[33:32] obedience by the thing we suffer
[33:34] that means we are not born obedient
[33:37] we're not obedient because of the name
[33:39] that we carry or the height color
[33:40] complexion
[33:41] or where we live we learn obedience
[33:46] obedience is something is how much of us
[33:49] are me included get burned by not
[33:52] following the instructions and the
[33:55] guidance that god gave
[33:56] and sometimes god put something in your
[33:58] spirit and you know god wants you to
[33:59] move a certain way but
[34:00] you are you are you too you have your
[34:02] own will and you you let down your god
[34:05] and you move by your own thinking and
[34:06] thoughts and it just not work out
[34:08] it ended up a big flop all because you
[34:11] didn't walk in that obedience to god's
[34:13] will
[34:13] but jesus learned obedience by thinking
[34:15] he suffered verse nine
[34:16] and being made perfect he became the
[34:19] author of eternal salvation unto all
[34:21] them that obey him
[34:23] call of god and high priests after the
[34:25] order of melchizedek
[34:27] of whom we have many things to say and
[34:30] how to be uttered
[34:31] seeing you at dull of hearing for when
[34:34] there's a part i want to get to this is
[34:36] paul addressing the hebrew church
[34:39] for when for the time you ought to be
[34:42] teachers
[34:43] you have need that one teach you again
[34:46] which be the first principles of the
[34:49] oracles of god
[34:51] and i become such as have need of milk
[34:53] and not of strong meat
[34:55] for everyone that uses milk is
[34:57] unskillful
[34:58] in the word of righteousness for he's a
[35:01] babe
[35:02] so paul is continuing on like a line
[35:05] from the corinthians to the hebrews
[35:08] and he said for everyone that used that
[35:10] milk is unskillful
[35:12] in the word of righteousness for he's a
[35:15] versus 14 but strong meat belonging to
[35:18] them that of
[35:19] foliage even those who by reason of use
[35:23] have their senses exercised to discern
[35:27] both good and evil this ties into
[35:30] proverbs though
[35:31] to have discernment to have discretion
[35:35] that ties into the book of proverbs
[35:37] advertiser was speaking about
[35:40] strong meat out of them that of a full
[35:43] age
[35:43] so what he's talking to is coming into
[35:45] maturity
[35:48] milk is for babies strong meat
[35:52] is for those that are mature we
[35:55] are not born mature we grow
[35:58] into maturity amen we are not
[36:01] born mature we grow in god
[36:05] okay so therefore the church
[36:08] the church folks who want to remain
[36:11] dependent
[36:13] simple ignorant but have no growth
[36:17] he's like a stunted person it's like a
[36:20] spiritual then
[36:21] when you expect somebody to be five feet
[36:23] something and growing taller there's
[36:26] somewhere only three feet line
[36:28] that's how there was 20 years ago and
[36:29] now they are now
[36:31] that can't be your story you have to
[36:33] grow
[36:35] you have to grow one you have to press
[36:37] amen
[36:38] and chapter six we continue
[36:41] the same uh it says here therefore
[36:45] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[36:48] of christ
[36:49] let us go on to perfection not lean
[36:53] again the foundation of repentance from
[36:55] dead works and of faith towards god
[36:58] of the doctrine of baptism and laying on
[37:00] the hands and resurrection of the dead
[37:01] of eternal judgment and this we will do
[37:04] if god commit
[37:05] so hebrews here always saying listen man
[37:08] you all supposed to be teachers
[37:11] you're supposed to be sharing instead of
[37:14] being
[37:14] babes taking milk looking for
[37:16] encouragement
[37:18] you're supposed to be encouraging others
[37:20] what is this telling you
[37:22] that god wants us to go like hold in
[37:24] john it says
[37:25] i write unto you children i write unto
[37:27] you
[37:28] young men i write unto you fathers
[37:31] that is the objective of god to get you
[37:35] into a position to be father to be
[37:38] mature
[37:39] to be ready to be right to be a son
[37:41] pleased
[37:42] to be adopted so let's go on now the
[37:45] galatians
[37:46] galatians i'm going to go to galatians
[37:49] chapter one
[37:52] wow and paul speaking here
[37:56] paul an apostle not of men neither by
[37:58] man
[38:00] but by jesus christ he keep identifying
[38:04] his position there's four he said who
[38:07] gave himself our sins the home of jesus
[38:09] and that he might deliver us
[38:10] from this present evil world according
[38:12] to the will of god and our father
[38:15] to whom be glory forever and ever amen
[38:17] so paul is glorifying god and then paul
[38:19] says this year
[38:20] i marvel yeah so soon removed from him
[38:24] that called you
[38:25] into the grace of christ onto another
[38:27] god i hope paul
[38:29] jammed the galatian church in chapter 1
[38:32] verse 6. now the amplified of that says
[38:37] i am surprised and astonished that you
[38:39] are so quickly turning
[38:40] renegade and deserting him who invited
[38:44] and called you
[38:45] by the grace unmerited favor of christ
[38:47] the messiah
[38:48] and that you are transferring your
[38:50] allegiance to a different
[38:52] even opposition gospel no
[38:55] which is not another but there be some
[38:57] that trouble you
[38:58] that would pervert the gospel of christ
[39:00] it's a verse 7
[39:02] and the amplified it says not that there
[39:04] is or could be any other genuine gospel
[39:07] but there are obviously some who are
[39:10] troubling and disturbing and bewildering
[39:14] you
[39:15] with a different kind of a teaching
[39:17] which they offer as a gospel
[39:20] i want to pervert and distort the gospel
[39:23] of christ the messiah
[39:25] into something which is absolutely not
[39:27] now remember
[39:28] the gospels passed out with the jews
[39:31] it's styled with jews these people was
[39:33] was
[39:33] following the torah was following moses
[39:35] following the law they were killed in
[39:37] lamb they had rituals they was
[39:39] eaten bred they was doing certain things
[39:42] this was their law
[39:43] so therefore when the gentiles
[39:47] began to come in some of these jews were
[39:50] trying to influence
[39:51] these gentiles to come and line up
[39:54] with these things of the law this is
[39:57] what this was all about so the church
[39:59] was in group mode here the church was in
[40:01] stages here
[40:02] step by step and we go to our own legal
[40:05] thing our own
[40:06] legal period or legal time and so on
[40:08] like that
[40:09] let's continue here but verse 8 but paul
[40:12] but do we which include himself
[40:16] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[40:19] gospel unto you
[40:21] than that which we have preached unto
[40:22] you let him be a curse
[40:24] as we said before so said i know again
[40:28] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[40:31] you
[40:31] than that you have received let them be
[40:33] a curse
[40:34] verse 11 for i certify you brethren this
[40:38] is paul
[40:39] that the gospel which was preached of me
[40:40] is not of man after man
[40:43] for i received it of of a man
[40:46] i neither receive it of a man neither
[40:47] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[40:49] jesus christ
[40:50] but paul was saying clearly this
[40:52] revelation i'm bringing to you is from
[40:53] heaven
[40:54] it's on god it's from jesus christ this
[40:56] is the word
[40:57] amen so chapter 2 let's go on
[41:01] then 14 years after i went up to
[41:03] jerusalem with barnabas
[41:04] took titus with me and i went up by
[41:07] revelation
[41:08] and communicated unto them that gospel
[41:11] which i preach among the gentiles
[41:13] but privately to them which were of
[41:14] reputation at least by any means i
[41:16] should run
[41:17] or run in vain and he said but neither
[41:21] titus was with me being a greek
[41:23] was compelled to be circumcised he
[41:25] didn't force titus to be circumcised
[41:26] titus was greek
[41:27] was four and that because of
[41:31] false brethren brought in
[41:34] who came in privily to spy out our
[41:37] liberty
[41:38] which we have in christ jesus that they
[41:40] might bring us into bondage
[41:42] listen to that verse 4 in the amplified
[41:45] my precaution was
[41:47] because of false brethren who had been
[41:50] secretly smuggled into the christian
[41:53] brotherhood
[41:54] they had slipped in to spy on our
[41:57] liberty
[41:58] and the freedom which we have in christ
[42:00] jesus that they might again
[42:02] bring us into bondage under the law of
[42:05] moses
[42:06] and there are people who love the law
[42:09] i'm not talking about moses law and that
[42:12] is why they are attracted to legalistic
[42:14] pastors and ministers and prophets and
[42:16] preachers
[42:17] because they have no internal discipline
[42:20] they like
[42:20] people externally to discipline them so
[42:23] the more
[42:24] rough the man is the more they like him
[42:26] the more he blasts
[42:28] the more they love them because they
[42:30] want somebody to
[42:32] beat them into shape they don't want and
[42:34] you see
[42:35] this is what the lord does externally
[42:37] though don't shut that door
[42:39] a law a law just the law but what god
[42:42] wants
[42:43] is this thing written in your heart that
[42:46] you have an internal law
[42:47] an internal governance an internal
[42:50] operation of the spirit
[42:52] where you are not con you know i guys
[42:54] tell young people
[42:55] if if um you know if if um if you don't
[42:58] get discipline in your house
[42:59] life will cut your tail life will put
[43:02] blows on you
[43:03] your mother beats you your father meet
[43:05] you you get spared you escape a
[43:07] certainty
[43:08] of your own way but eventually it will
[43:11] pick up at you
[43:12] because life is about discipline and
[43:14] order god is about discipline and order
[43:17] we must come into discipline amen
[43:20] so he says so so so um
[43:23] so paul was saying in verse 5 to whom we
[43:26] give place by subjection
[43:27] no not for our that the truth of the
[43:29] gospel might continue in you
[43:31] so there were people who came in that
[43:34] wanted to bring them back into the law
[43:36] into bondage again verse 11
[43:38] but when peter was come to antioch i
[43:40] would stood him to the face
[43:41] because he was to be blamed for before
[43:44] certain
[43:45] and he talked about peter and his
[43:46] behavior and so on and then he rebuked
[43:48] peter
[43:48] when i saw that they walked not
[43:50] uprightly according to the truth of the
[43:52] gospel verse 14
[43:53] i said unto peter before them all if
[43:56] thou being a jew
[43:57] live us after the man of the gentiles
[43:59] and not as do the jews
[44:00] why compel us though the gentiles
[44:02] delivered through the jews
[44:04] we who are jews by nature are not
[44:06] sinners of the gentiles
[44:07] and then paul went down deep in the word
[44:10] they say
[44:10] know in verse 16 that a man is not
[44:13] justified by the works of the law
[44:14] in other words being circumcised doing
[44:17] all them rituals you know all them drama
[44:18] and so on
[44:19] that doesn't justify him he said but by
[44:22] faith of
[44:22] christ jesus jesus christ even we have
[44:25] believed in jesus christ
[44:26] are we i'd be justified by the faith of
[44:28] christ and not by the books of the law
[44:30] for by the works of the law shall no
[44:32] flesh be justified
[44:34] but if we're 17 while we seek to be
[44:37] justified by christ
[44:38] we ourselves are from sinners is
[44:40] therefore christ a minister of sin god
[44:42] forbid
[44:43] so you can't claim to be justified even
[44:45] living in sin that makes no sense
[44:47] the justification means that you have
[44:49] been released from guilt
[44:51] released from your past release on your
[44:53] sins you're free to live your life
[44:55] but you are justified but if i build
[44:57] again the things which i destroy
[44:59] i make myself a transgression for i true
[45:02] the law i'm dead to the law that i may
[45:04] live unto god then paul said this
[45:06] marvelous word here and this is
[45:07] something that you should repeat
[45:09] and and and remember and store in your
[45:12] heart and mind
[45:13] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[45:15] i live
[45:16] yet not i but christ live it in me
[45:19] and the life which i now live in the
[45:21] flesh i live by
[45:23] the fate of the son of god who love me
[45:26] and give himself for me i do not
[45:29] frustrate the grace of god
[45:31] for if righteousness come by the law
[45:33] then christ is dead
[45:35] then chapter three let's continue
[45:38] verse one o foolish
[45:41] galatians now i want you to see the
[45:43] magnitude of this being a church
[45:45] being believers and see how it could be
[45:48] foolish believers foolish christians
[45:51] all foolish quick the galatians who
[45:54] would be with you
[45:56] that you should not will be the truth
[45:58] before whose
[45:59] eyes jesus christ has been evidently set
[46:02] forth crucified among you
[46:05] this only would i learn of you receiving
[46:07] the spirit
[46:08] by the law of the works of the law or by
[46:10] hearing of it now these are people
[46:12] that actually had experience of the
[46:14] spirit of god
[46:15] and he's asking them the spirit you
[46:17] receive how you get it
[46:19] was it by the works of the law or by
[46:21] hearing your feet
[46:22] are you so foolish having begun in the
[46:26] spirit
[46:27] are you know made perfect by the flesh
[46:31] now this is real this is people who are
[46:34] going backwards they start in the spirit
[46:37] and instead of staying in the spirit and
[46:38] sitting on the grace and going in
[46:40] revelation
[46:40] they start to go backwards they start to
[46:42] go backwards towards the works of the
[46:44] flesh
[46:45] he said have you suffered so many things
[46:47] in vain if yet to be in vain
[46:49] he therefore that ministered to you the
[46:51] spirit and look at miracles among you do
[46:54] it he
[46:54] by the works of the law or by hearing of
[46:56] faith even as abraham believed god
[46:59] and was a conqueror to him for
[47:01] righteousness we are getting to
[47:03] ephesians let's go to romans book of
[47:04] romans
[47:05] let's continue
[47:10] so the book of romans we want to look at
[47:11] chapter 3
[47:13] and we want to work look at verse 9
[47:15] we'll start from verse 9
[47:16] of the book of romans chapter 3
[47:20] verse 9 what then are they better than
[47:22] thee are we better than thee
[47:24] he's talking about jews are we jews
[47:26] better than these gentiles are we better
[47:29] no in no wise for we have before proof
[47:31] both jews and gentiles
[47:33] that they are all under sin so it's not
[47:36] as if
[47:37] the jews could claim we are the
[47:38] righteous people we are god's people we
[47:41] are fine no they were not they were
[47:43] sinners
[47:44] and the law exposes him for behavior
[47:46] that's why the law was saying those are
[47:48] not
[47:49] adultery or shall not lost to make a
[47:51] wise labor's goods
[47:53] though shall not steal those shall not
[47:54] kill because
[47:56] they were sinners diverting law
[47:59] addressed
[48:00] their sin and we as gentiles of course
[48:02] we were unbelievers
[48:03] sinners right now he said verse 10
[48:07] of of this roman street as it is written
[48:09] there is none righteous no not one
[48:11] there is none that understand it there
[48:13] is none that secret after god
[48:15] they are all gone out of the way they
[48:18] are all together and
[48:19] become unprofitable there is none that
[48:21] do it good no not one
[48:22] their truth is the open sea falcon their
[48:24] tongues they have used the seat
[48:26] the poison of aspects under their lips
[48:28] whose mouth is full of crystal and
[48:30] bitterness
[48:30] their feet are swift as shed blood
[48:33] destruction and misery and their ways
[48:35] the way of peace have they not known
[48:37] there is no fear of god
[48:39] before their eyes now we know that what
[48:42] things so ever the law said it saith
[48:45] them who are
[48:46] under the law that every mouth be
[48:48] stopped
[48:49] and all the world may become guilty
[48:51] before god
[48:53] so this thing about god's chosen people
[48:55] and whatnot
[48:57] this gospel here brought everyone guilty
[49:00] before god
[49:01] verse 20 therefore by the deeds of the
[49:04] law
[49:05] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[49:07] sight
[49:08] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[49:11] but
[49:11] no the righteousness of god without the
[49:15] law
[49:15] is manifested being witnessed by the law
[49:18] and the prophets
[49:19] even the righteousness of god which is
[49:21] up by fate
[49:22] of christ jesus upon all unto all
[49:25] are upon them that believe there's no
[49:27] difference who is 23 for all have sinned
[49:30] and come short of the glory of god so he
[49:32] was showing clearly
[49:34] that this thing and see that is why god
[49:36] could take a man like
[49:37] saul and bring him to become poor
[49:40] that could that's why god could take you
[49:42] and i rank
[49:44] sinners and whatnot and change our lives
[49:47] and there's no way we could explain how
[49:50] that is even possible
[49:51] i remember my early christian work i
[49:52] said lord why you call me how you call
[49:54] me what on
[49:55] earth did you see in me because i wasn't
[49:57] serious than me whatever god was seeing
[49:59] i just wasn't seeing
[50:00] because i was a troublemaker before i'm
[50:02] saying that
[50:03] so so when you see that you could see
[50:06] how god could
[50:07] justify people and if god justifies
[50:09] someone who are we to condemn what you
[50:12] think about
[50:13] that's why regardless how boxing your
[50:16] family is
[50:18] you can't write them off you can't say
[50:20] they've gone too far
[50:21] you can't say they can't bounce back you
[50:23] are not in charge of that
[50:25] okay verse 24 being justified hallelujah
[50:29] freely by his grace through the
[50:31] redemption that is in christ jesus
[50:34] whom god has set forth to be a
[50:36] propagation
[50:38] to faith in his blood to declare the
[50:40] righteousness all this righteousness is
[50:41] not your words
[50:43] this righteousness is right standing
[50:46] with god and only god could declare that
[50:48] on your life
[50:49] let me say it again this righteousness
[50:51] is not you
[50:52] one in a mountain wearing a white robe
[50:55] and you're seeing no sinner
[50:56] and you're in some cave praying and
[50:57] fasting somewhere die not righteousness
[51:01] that is some other thing the
[51:03] righteousness is of faith in christ
[51:04] jesus
[51:05] through his blood i was shared for you
[51:07] and you accept that blood
[51:09] as your redemption as your deliverance
[51:11] as your breakthrough
[51:12] as your cleansing from sin to watch
[51:17] verse 28 therefore we conclude that a
[51:20] man
[51:21] is justified by fate without the deeds
[51:24] of the law
[51:25] is he the god of the jews only is he not
[51:28] also the god of the gentiles ye of the
[51:30] gentiles also
[51:31] seems as one god which shall justify
[51:34] the circumcision by faith and the
[51:36] uncircumcision through faith
[51:39] do we need void the law to faith god
[51:41] forbid
[51:42] we establish the law and then in chapter
[51:44] four we go on right there
[51:45] what shall we then say that abram or
[51:48] father pertinent to the flesh had found
[51:50] for if abraham would justify by works he
[51:53] yet were off to glory but not before god
[51:55] what saith the scripture abram believed
[51:58] god
[51:59] and it was counted unto him for
[52:01] righteousness now this tonight don't
[52:03] just think we read the scriptures alone
[52:06] take it to heart this is very important
[52:08] what we're about to read here right now
[52:10] what saith the scripture abraham
[52:13] believed god
[52:14] and it was counted unto him for
[52:16] righteousness
[52:18] and to him that worketh is the reward
[52:20] not reckon of grace but of debt
[52:22] so if you could work for it then god owe
[52:24] you and you're looking for god to give
[52:26] you
[52:27] a reward well watch this but to him
[52:30] that worketh not but believe it on him
[52:35] that justified the ungodly yes we read
[52:38] right tonight
[52:40] believe it on him that justified the
[52:43] ungodly
[52:44] his fate is counted for righteousness
[52:48] so god count abraham
[52:52] faith currency as righteousness
[52:56] and declare abraham as righteous so when
[52:59] even even lie concerning his wife to be
[53:02] king
[53:03] god stop every woman in that house and
[53:06] say we store until that
[53:08] prophet his wife the king said oh god
[53:11] the man tell me
[53:11] my sister he said he tell you that
[53:14] but i tell you go and restore to that
[53:17] man his wife i'll let him pray for you
[53:19] too
[53:20] that's what we're talking about because
[53:23] god had justified iran
[53:25] by his fate let's continue
[53:28] even verse 6 as david also described the
[53:31] blessings of the man
[53:32] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[53:35] without works
[53:36] saying blessed a day whose iniquities
[53:38] are forgiven
[53:40] whose sins are covered blessed is the
[53:42] man to whom
[53:43] the lord will not impute sin come at
[53:45] this precedence then upon the
[53:47] circumcision only
[53:48] or upon the uncircumcision also for we
[53:51] say
[53:51] that the fate was reckoned to amen for
[53:54] righteousness
[53:55] or was it reckon when he was in
[53:57] circumcision or in uncircumcision
[53:59] not in circumcision but in
[54:00] uncircumcision so he's showing you
[54:02] that this faith that abraham had was
[54:04] confirmed before he was circumcised
[54:07] hallelujah oh glory to god before he get
[54:09] the holy ghost
[54:10] hallelujah you have to have faith oh
[54:13] glory to god that faith is already new
[54:15] you know let me see it in high
[54:16] that faith is immune that is why you
[54:18] receive the word
[54:20] do you understand that tonight do you
[54:22] get that tonight
[54:23] god is not now trying to organize that
[54:26] faith in you you know he prepared you
[54:27] before the foundation of the world to
[54:29] receive this word but this word that
[54:31] what you're possessed
[54:32] the seed already listen you take a mango
[54:35] seed the mangoside mangoes and nature
[54:38] you can't see it yet you only see that
[54:41] mango seed
[54:42] you bury that seed and turn your back
[54:44] and walk away
[54:46] come back five years later and you seen
[54:48] a big tree in front of you with mangoes
[54:49] on it
[54:50] but when you had it on the table the
[54:52] mango tree was in there
[54:54] the mangoes was inside of there it had
[54:57] not yet
[54:57] unfolded so the devil is confused
[55:01] because here see the sons of god
[55:02] unfolded
[55:04] he only sees cinnamon but when the lamb
[55:06] dropped the book
[55:07] the lamb took the book to bring us
[55:09] completely into a justified condition
[55:12] that we could be restored sons i want
[55:14] you to see we on our way to ephesians
[55:16] hallelujah oh glory to god this is what
[55:19] it's all about
[55:20] this is the journey we're talking about
[55:22] this is the journey from
[55:23] egypt to the promised land this is a
[55:25] journey from corinthians to
[55:27] ephesians this is a journey from carnal
[55:30] church
[55:30] natural church legalistic church baby
[55:33] church
[55:34] hebrews church to ephesians is a journey
[55:36] beyond
[55:37] you have to want to go you have to want
[55:40] to get to there
[55:41] if you want to stay where you are you
[55:42] can stay where you are well you know
[55:45] but you have to understand the
[55:46] destination is ephesians
[55:48] that's the church you want to get so
[55:50] okay so he received a sign of
[55:52] circumcision
[55:53] it is a seal glory of the righteousness
[55:58] of the faith which he had yet been
[56:01] uncircumcised
[56:02] oh glory to god so if the circumcision
[56:05] types the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:07] abram had a faith and the circumcision
[56:10] called as a seal
[56:12] of the righteousness of faith that he
[56:14] had before he was circumcised
[56:16] that is why but iran says because you
[56:18] are son
[56:19] you are sinned by the holy ghost the
[56:21] holy ghost doesn't make you a son
[56:23] you because you are son you can be
[56:25] reborn or give the lord a shout in the
[56:27] house let me say it again
[56:29] be because you are son you could
[56:32] be reborn because you are son you can be
[56:35] refilled
[56:35] because you are son you can be filled
[56:38] because your son you can be sealed
[56:40] because he's not now calling you he
[56:42] chose you at know that
[56:43] in ephesians it chose you before the
[56:45] foundation of the world according to his
[56:47] good pleasure
[56:48] that is where we heard him down dumpty
[56:50] ephesians
[56:51] all right now watch he received the sign
[56:54] of circumcision the sign design
[56:56] a seal of the righteousness of the faith
[56:58] verse 11
[57:00] which he had yet been uncircumcised that
[57:02] he might be the father of all them that
[57:04] believe
[57:05] though they be not circumcised that
[57:07] righteousness
[57:08] might be imputed unto them also verse 12
[57:12] and the father of circumcision to them
[57:14] who are not of the sacred civil only
[57:17] but who also walk in the steps of that
[57:18] fate or father abraham
[57:20] which he had being yet uncircumcised for
[57:23] the promise here we go
[57:25] that he should be heir of the world was
[57:27] not to
[57:28] abram or to his seed through the law
[57:31] but through the righteousness of faith
[57:33] but that is how we become ears
[57:36] because his seed was the royal season
[57:38] which was christ and through christ
[57:40] we become heirs of the ut we become
[57:42] heirs we
[57:43] we have an inheritance just think about
[57:45] it now we were lost
[57:47] we were gentiles we were finished and
[57:48] cut off all of a sudden
[57:50] because of the cross we find ourselves
[57:52] having an inheritance
[57:54] oh hallelujah glory hallelujah think
[57:56] about it now
[57:58] think about it you have an inheritance
[58:01] oh my for if they which are of the law
[58:04] of verse 14
[58:05] be heirs faith is made void you don't
[58:07] need faith just follow the law
[58:09] and the promise made of non-effect
[58:11] because verse 15 the law will get right
[58:13] but where no law is there's no
[58:14] transgression therefore
[58:16] here we go it is of faith that it might
[58:19] be by grace
[58:21] to the end the promise might be sure to
[58:23] all the seed
[58:24] so what's something they won't want to
[58:25] be well all right jesus saying means
[58:28] pastor samaria
[58:29] is sending away these cyprus to get
[58:31] bread you have to meet this woman this
[58:32] woman too less this woman
[58:33] have no idea what her life is about to
[58:36] change
[58:37] that very day she doesn't know because
[58:40] she's not a virgin
[58:41] she come at different time from when he
[58:43] virgin just go so she come in normal
[58:45] time
[58:46] jesus said nothing well he have no
[58:47] bucket he's waiting on her her
[58:50] name is on the book he has the book
[58:53] he is the book he knows her name she
[58:56] doesn't have a clue
[58:57] she's canal she's natural she's in the
[59:00] flesh
[59:01] she's totally clueless she comes to the
[59:05] world
[59:05] you say woman give me someone a drink
[59:08] she said we're supposed to have a
[59:09] conversation
[59:10] he said woman if you know talking to you
[59:11] you laugh before water to drink
[59:13] we we know what happened all of a sudden
[59:16] when he said i need to speak unto you
[59:18] and he and you know what he did he said
[59:19] go call your husband she said i have
[59:20] none she said the one you're living with
[59:23] you have five and the one you're living
[59:24] with is not yours she said
[59:27] perceive that with a profit so she now
[59:29] gets in that channel
[59:31] and we know any messiah coming through
[59:34] these things
[59:35] and she's not religious talk with him he
[59:36] said how many hours come and know it
[59:38] with the true worshipers the freaking
[59:39] damn pharisees and the muslims where the
[59:41] true worshipers
[59:41] worship the father and spirit of the
[59:43] truth they know not what they worship
[59:45] they know worship they vain do they
[59:46] worship me so he said
[59:48] she's a woman this this time coming
[59:51] where there are mechanics and dynamics
[59:52] where all the world will come back
[59:53] together but the sons of god could be
[59:55] able to worship correctly
[59:57] in spirit and truth and mechanical
[59:58] dynamics when jesus finished with that
[1:00:01] woman she started wrong
[1:00:02] she run straight whole glory to god she
[1:00:04] was freed
[1:00:05] she was so free that she could testify
[1:00:08] about come see a man that told me all
[1:00:09] this
[1:00:10] that woman name on the book
[1:00:14] life outside looking dark and bleak
[1:00:16] because of a life of what man should
[1:00:18] live with this that and that all that
[1:00:20] negative
[1:00:20] all of a sudden grace justification
[1:00:23] calling
[1:00:24] predestination all that throw into gear
[1:00:26] one time
[1:00:27] it's like every buttons are the best
[1:00:28] predestination grace
[1:00:30] blood deliverance a destination
[1:00:33] upper room for all he goes everything
[1:00:37] the package sealed and you know what she
[1:00:40] was in your peru
[1:00:41] where was judas he didn't make the upper
[1:00:43] room
[1:00:44] he hung himself he makes it clean but
[1:00:47] that was a seed of god
[1:00:48] who are you tonight a seed of god what's
[1:00:51] your past to hell
[1:00:52] they passed you all kind of stuff but
[1:00:54] guess what you're gonna make it
[1:00:56] because why your name is on the book do
[1:00:58] you believe that you have to believe
[1:00:59] that
[1:00:59] if you don't believe that you're in real
[1:01:01] trouble because all that dwell in the uh
[1:01:03] worship
[1:01:04] the peace except this whole name so you
[1:01:07] have to believe your name is written
[1:01:08] and these seven seals the open book come
[1:01:11] to reveal your name
[1:01:12] your name for this hour is placed in a
[1:01:14] certain position
[1:01:16] and that position is in ephesians where
[1:01:17] every gift of the fight is placed
[1:01:19] your position in the corinthians because
[1:01:21] gordon coined for corinthians church
[1:01:23] that church
[1:01:24] another perfect church he comes a church
[1:01:26] a school of affection
[1:01:27] that perfection treats the divisions
[1:01:29] that is why we have to go back another
[1:01:30] episode
[1:01:31] that way that is why we have to go back
[1:01:33] to the faith of the fathers i don't like
[1:01:34] a preacher tonight
[1:01:35] we want to preach let me skip that verse
[1:01:37] 20 of the same chapter
[1:01:38] he staggered not that the promise of god
[1:01:40] true on belief but was strong in faith
[1:01:42] giving glory to god
[1:01:43] this year is a whole big message right
[1:01:45] here because people don't want to talk
[1:01:46] about it coming
[1:01:48] they find it too futuristic but here we
[1:01:50] talking future future future future you
[1:01:52] see it here no
[1:01:53] no no is that here no at all if i had it
[1:01:55] he was gonna know it
[1:01:56] i am saying this is the promise of god
[1:01:58] and i'm not staggering
[1:01:59] nobody can miss taga nobody make it i
[1:02:02] have it already
[1:02:03] i have it i have it potentially i don't
[1:02:05] know potential i want your relative i
[1:02:06] don't know seeds i want to pick mango
[1:02:08] from mango tree i don't want to say god
[1:02:10] everything inside you see
[1:02:10] no i want to see the seed bury die out
[1:02:13] grow out
[1:02:14] until i could pick mango eat mango eat
[1:02:16] mango and so on make mango juice
[1:02:27] have i given to you this is what we want
[1:02:29] this is the scripture and listen voice
[1:02:31] to anyone i'm being fully persuaded
[1:02:32] that's all we are tonight
[1:02:34] that what he promised he was able to
[1:02:36] perform and i believe in all my heart
[1:02:38] if brother branham was the wave chief
[1:02:40] and god waved him
[1:02:42] and put him as a sign you have other
[1:02:44] sons coming the devil is a liar he
[1:02:46] cannot cancel any other son
[1:02:48] other sons committed maturity other sons
[1:02:51] coming the journey from corinthians
[1:02:52] straight to ephesians
[1:02:53] oh hallelujah praise god to go bypass
[1:02:56] all the mother churches
[1:02:57] and come straight to ephesians but that
[1:02:59] is the destination being
[1:03:01] fully persuaded that what he promised he
[1:03:03] was able to form
[1:03:04] and therefore it was imputed him for
[1:03:06] righteousness oh
[1:03:08] my chapter five one was done here
[1:03:11] of this chapter here therefore being
[1:03:13] justified by faith
[1:03:14] we have peace with god to our lord jesus
[1:03:17] christ before you get in peace
[1:03:18] in justified by faith you have
[1:03:22] peace let me say it again or your peace
[1:03:24] being justified by faith
[1:03:26] that means you are credited to be
[1:03:28] righteous
[1:03:29] by your faith in christ jesus oh
[1:03:32] hallelujah
[1:03:33] oh not by the law but by the
[1:03:35] righteousness wishes of faith
[1:03:37] my god by whom also
[1:03:40] we have access by faith into this grace
[1:03:43] where we stand
[1:03:44] and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[1:03:47] oh hallelujah you see
[1:03:48] this truth this same faith you have
[1:03:50] access to grace
[1:03:51] that's why you should never stop praying
[1:03:53] for your loved ones you should never
[1:03:55] stop praying for your family
[1:03:56] you should always believe god will
[1:03:58] deliver them so that completes
[1:04:00] uh romans let's go to philippians right
[1:04:02] now chapter two oh my
[1:04:04] so philippians i love the book of
[1:04:06] philippians two books i love a lot
[1:04:08] in the book of philippians and book of
[1:04:09] russians they like sisters or cousins to
[1:04:12] the book of ephesians and that's why i
[1:04:14] placed them there our philippians and
[1:04:15] then we go to colossians
[1:04:17] and then we're going to strike ephesians
[1:04:19] oh praise the lord so trust tonight
[1:04:21] that this help you in some way and
[1:04:22] identify somebody but chapter two
[1:04:24] uh paul was talking about behavior
[1:04:28] and attitude in chapter two if there be
[1:04:30] any translation in christ
[1:04:32] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[1:04:35] of the spirit
[1:04:36] if any borrowers of mercy fulfilling my
[1:04:38] joy that you'll be like-minded
[1:04:40] having the same love being of one accord
[1:04:43] and one mind
[1:04:44] so this is not baccanal now this is not
[1:04:45] canaratino this is getting into the
[1:04:48] greater the matter of christian behavior
[1:04:50] life and behavior and so like that
[1:04:52] let nothing be done to strife of
[1:04:54] vainglory
[1:04:55] but in loneliness of mind let each
[1:04:58] esteem other better than themselves
[1:05:00] can you do that can you esteem somebody
[1:05:02] hard on you
[1:05:03] or you must be the center of everything
[1:05:06] you gotta look at that
[1:05:08] you have to look at it there are some
[1:05:09] people who are so self-centered that
[1:05:10] they
[1:05:11] have to be immune they have to be in
[1:05:13] front they have to be ahead they have to
[1:05:15] be
[1:05:15] uh do it first you just have to be the
[1:05:18] center of attraction the
[1:05:19] life of the party however they want to
[1:05:21] see it but here
[1:05:22] is paul singing don't do anything for
[1:05:25] strife of vainglory
[1:05:27] you're looking for a fight some people
[1:05:28] like fight just looking for a quarry
[1:05:31] looking for argument i'll call this
[1:05:34] brother because we don't get along so
[1:05:35] good
[1:05:36] hey and you're looking for a fight no
[1:05:39] that cannot be the beat because you're
[1:05:41] heading for ephesians
[1:05:43] that had to be filtered out so let
[1:05:45] nothing be done to strife
[1:05:47] or be in glory but in loneliness of mine
[1:05:50] that each esteem be automated by
[1:05:52] themselves
[1:05:54] watch look not every man on his own
[1:05:56] things but
[1:05:57] every man also on the things of others
[1:05:59] and and reading the scripture i remember
[1:06:01] paul
[1:06:02] i think in one of the epistles he was
[1:06:04] talking about if i die
[1:06:06] you know you know i am i'm fine but i
[1:06:09] stay here
[1:06:10] for your glory to help you so so
[1:06:13] is christianity he knew if he died he go
[1:06:16] on to be with the lord
[1:06:17] but it's better he'd be wrong to help
[1:06:20] the church grow
[1:06:21] every church mature his life had a
[1:06:24] greater sense of purpose here on earth
[1:06:26] than being taken into glory so don't try
[1:06:29] to escape and you want to go
[1:06:30] oh hallelujah i'm not with the glory you
[1:06:32] want to go glory we're doing on earth
[1:06:34] oh jesus come for me coming what you do
[1:06:37] say boy ain't doing nothing
[1:06:38] you better stay on it and get something
[1:06:40] done because you see a car do anything
[1:06:42] up there for down here
[1:06:44] here is where you have to make the
[1:06:45] record here's where you have to testify
[1:06:48] here's where you have the wind souls
[1:06:49] here is where you have to witness
[1:06:51] here's where i encourage people this is
[1:06:53] the place to do it this is design now
[1:06:55] all right let's continue now verse 4
[1:06:59] look not every man on his own things but
[1:07:01] every man also
[1:07:02] thinks of others now this is a tall
[1:07:04] order here but this is christianity and
[1:07:05] it's work
[1:07:06] christianity is lyrics for others you're
[1:07:08] looking after your brother
[1:07:10] you're looking out for his sister
[1:07:11] because in the depth of the word
[1:07:14] to love god really is to love his people
[1:07:17] because
[1:07:17] how you could love god you can't see and
[1:07:19] the people in front of your face you
[1:07:20] have fight with them problems
[1:07:22] and they're making the images like this
[1:07:23] of god so god say you love me
[1:07:26] love my people jesus went and washed
[1:07:28] your feet how many fingers say
[1:07:30] you see what i do here do it to one
[1:07:32] another
[1:07:33] the first piece i didn't want but he
[1:07:35] said this is what i want to show you
[1:07:37] the gentiles they have this power
[1:07:40] crazy stuff and authority over others
[1:07:43] and so on
[1:07:43] he said i don't want you like that let
[1:07:45] him
[1:07:46] that is greatest among you let him serve
[1:07:50] that word sir as a problematic word
[1:07:54] that's why you hear me see that the
[1:07:56] gospel
[1:07:57] is not for ministers to be on some some
[1:08:00] throne somewhere
[1:08:01] the idea to serve they are there to
[1:08:04] serve
[1:08:04] for the for the work of the ministry for
[1:08:07] the edifying of the bodies the spirit
[1:08:09] it's an attitude
[1:08:10] it's something that god put there um for
[1:08:13] the building up of the body
[1:08:14] of christ and if you look closely you
[1:08:17] would see
[1:08:18] that the burden of god has always been
[1:08:19] about his people that's why he sent
[1:08:21] prophets
[1:08:21] that's why he said apostles is all about
[1:08:24] god's people
[1:08:25] if they reject this one he's in another
[1:08:26] one he's in another one
[1:08:28] he said no no it's not the money and you
[1:08:30] know the channel
[1:08:31] is to get the word for the people so
[1:08:34] let's see
[1:08:35] okay so this was one of the great uh
[1:08:38] uh uh chapters here in this book of
[1:08:41] philippians
[1:08:42] who paul really expressed
[1:08:45] uh uh god in this form of becoming man
[1:08:49] in such a beautiful way
[1:08:50] he said look not and every man was four
[1:08:52] on on his own things
[1:08:54] but every man also names of others let
[1:08:56] this mind be in you
[1:08:58] which was also in christ jesus and here
[1:09:00] we go who
[1:09:01] who being the form of god taught it not
[1:09:04] robbery to be equal with god
[1:09:06] one made himself no reputation two
[1:09:10] took upon him the former servant tree
[1:09:12] was made in the likeness of man
[1:09:14] and being found in the fashion of man he
[1:09:16] humbled himself
[1:09:18] so this is god almighty this is
[1:09:20] greatness truly expressed in humility
[1:09:23] let me say that again this scripture
[1:09:25] here being found
[1:09:27] in fashion as a man this is god has
[1:09:28] guided himself now he humbled himself
[1:09:31] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:09:34] death of the cross
[1:09:35] so jesus didn't take the approach i am
[1:09:37] god and i will do this and i grew that
[1:09:40] don't touch me no no i wasn't approached
[1:09:43] he was like a dumb he went down he said
[1:09:46] nothing
[1:09:47] they led him to the cross he died he was
[1:09:49] finished
[1:09:50] and as far as jesus concerned drama
[1:09:53] knows that
[1:09:54] because when he died at calvary he
[1:09:56] released the anointing
[1:09:57] that we could have this meeting tonight
[1:10:00] that is what that was about
[1:10:01] you released the anointing that in your
[1:10:04] sinful
[1:10:04] week on just that he wanted to well you
[1:10:07] have no clue your name on the book you
[1:10:08] have no clue
[1:10:09] your god predestinated you to be a
[1:10:10] christian and to receive the lord
[1:10:13] and here it is your heart has been
[1:10:15] turned think about it
[1:10:17] for you to be here tonight your heart
[1:10:18] had to be turned turn to god
[1:10:21] oh hallelujah turn in your heart because
[1:10:23] my heart wicked them
[1:10:25] desperately with them goddaddy and you
[1:10:28] are
[1:10:28] i had to watch him a new spirit and god
[1:10:31] had to release a spirit upon you
[1:10:33] and before he could give you the holy
[1:10:35] spirit he just sent anointing upon you
[1:10:36] to anoint you
[1:10:37] to get you to feel what the holy spirit
[1:10:39] is like and he said
[1:10:41] he with you but he's going to be in you
[1:10:43] amen being fonder is that the fashion is
[1:10:45] a man
[1:10:46] he humble himself you can be into debt
[1:10:48] get to the cross
[1:10:49] wherefore god has highly exalted him and
[1:10:51] give him a name
[1:10:53] which is above every name that at the
[1:10:55] name of jesus every knee shall bow
[1:10:58] heaven and eat and so every time can
[1:10:59] confess amen
[1:11:01] he said wherefore my beloved verse 12 as
[1:11:04] he have always obeyed
[1:11:05] not as in my presence only but now much
[1:11:08] more in my absence
[1:11:09] work out your own salvation with your
[1:11:11] trip let me read the scripture again
[1:11:13] way for my beloved as you have always
[1:11:15] obeyed
[1:11:16] not as in my presence only you know some
[1:11:18] people only be their self and somebody
[1:11:20] else are wrong
[1:11:21] some else are wrong something around
[1:11:22] they pass around they behave nice and so
[1:11:24] on
[1:11:24] when that apple's not there they just go
[1:11:26] their own way paul is saying he know
[1:11:28] they obey
[1:11:28] not only his presence but now much more
[1:11:31] in my absence
[1:11:32] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:11:35] and troubling
[1:11:36] for it is god which worketh in you
[1:11:40] both to will and to do his good pleasure
[1:11:44] do all things without murmurings and
[1:11:47] disputes let me read that again
[1:11:50] do all things without murmurings and
[1:11:52] disputants why was 15
[1:11:54] that you may be blameless and harmless
[1:11:58] the sons of god without rebuke in the
[1:12:00] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[1:12:03] among whom we shine as lights in the
[1:12:05] world
[1:12:06] verse 16 holding forth the word of life
[1:12:10] that i may rejoice in the day of christ
[1:12:12] that i have not run in vain
[1:12:13] neither labor in vain ye if i be offered
[1:12:16] upon the sacrifice or service of your
[1:12:17] faith
[1:12:18] i joy and rejoice with you all let's go
[1:12:20] to chapter 3 verse 12
[1:12:22] of the same philippians this is paul
[1:12:25] there's one the favorites the one we
[1:12:27] know not as though
[1:12:29] i had already attained either were
[1:12:31] already perfect suppose
[1:12:33] not that i'm perfect but i follow after
[1:12:35] if i might apprehend
[1:12:37] for which also i'm apprehended of christ
[1:12:39] jesus
[1:12:40] brethren was the thing i can't not
[1:12:43] myself to have apprehended
[1:12:44] but this one thing i do for getting
[1:12:47] those things which are behind
[1:12:49] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:12:50] which are before
[1:12:52] i press towards the mark of the price
[1:12:56] of the high calling of god in christ in
[1:12:58] christ jesus
[1:12:59] remember you heard me say before that
[1:13:02] the chord is at the bottom
[1:13:04] there's room for you at the top if you
[1:13:06] are prepared to press
[1:13:08] the noisemakers at the bottom
[1:13:09] troublemakers and the person crucify him
[1:13:11] is at the bottom
[1:13:12] liars fornicators backsliders and people
[1:13:15] carrying on without all kind of they
[1:13:16] have the
[1:13:18] it's crowded down there and
[1:13:21] but it's actually something to me is
[1:13:22] very interesting he said you know
[1:13:23] sometimes
[1:13:24] mediocre mediocre is so normal
[1:13:27] it doesn't even take much to get above
[1:13:31] the noise of the crowd because
[1:13:34] mediocrity
[1:13:35] is is so normal that when somebody
[1:13:38] excel is oh look at that but i'm saying
[1:13:41] we are not called to be mediocre we are
[1:13:44] not called to be ordinary we are called
[1:13:46] to recognize
[1:13:47] that we are have a high calling this
[1:13:50] calling my friends is in ephesians
[1:13:52] this calling is right then ephesians a
[1:13:54] high calling
[1:13:55] and there's a mark to present what is
[1:13:58] troubling sometimes is that people
[1:14:01] uh don't have a mark you know like it is
[1:14:04] said
[1:14:04] if you don't have a date with a goal
[1:14:08] that goal is like you're not serious
[1:14:11] about your goals
[1:14:12] if you have a goal you'll have a date i
[1:14:15] want to achieve this by this time
[1:14:17] the date gives a timeline with by which
[1:14:20] to accomplish that
[1:14:22] and you have to be able to plot how
[1:14:24] you're going to get
[1:14:25] from where you are to where you want to
[1:14:27] be in that timeline
[1:14:29] we also have a timeline it's an
[1:14:32] invisible timeline the time that god
[1:14:34] gives us
[1:14:34] like about time they're born a time to
[1:14:36] die there's a timeline
[1:14:37] and in that timeline we have things to
[1:14:39] accomplish we have things to do
[1:14:40] some of us do it some of us don't but we
[1:14:43] also have that
[1:14:44] invisible timeline we don't know when
[1:14:46] that time is going to be
[1:14:47] when that time is finished see but i'm
[1:14:50] saying
[1:14:50] there's room at the top paul said i
[1:14:53] press they don't know group president
[1:14:55] there's nothing we press towards the map
[1:14:57] it doesn't have that
[1:14:58] i press is the individual out of all of
[1:15:01] this
[1:15:02] we still hone in on the individual that
[1:15:04] would make a decision
[1:15:05] to press when paul talked about the
[1:15:08] fruits of these spiritual joy love peace
[1:15:10] that is and put away the old man that is
[1:15:12] deliberating
[1:15:13] it's not automatically or automatically
[1:15:15] the fruits automatically
[1:15:17] no no no there is something that you
[1:15:20] have to do to say you know what i don't
[1:15:21] want that i want this
[1:15:23] it is intentional it is you determining
[1:15:26] to walk a certain way
[1:15:27] one time he said put you on the lord
[1:15:29] jesus christ
[1:15:30] and put away the old man put it away
[1:15:35] and like the bible said when i was a
[1:15:36] child i speak as a child i understood
[1:15:38] like a child
[1:15:39] and so on but when i became a man i put
[1:15:42] away childish things no
[1:15:43] angel coming with a big hoes who's not
[1:15:45] really challenging what you shh
[1:15:47] two angel coming to do it for you you
[1:15:50] have to put that away
[1:15:51] same as the land was given to them but
[1:15:54] they had to fight and cut down that land
[1:15:56] my lord my lord okay let's go to chapter
[1:15:58] four
[1:16:00] of that same oh i'll slam down here
[1:16:04] and paul give this exaltation here
[1:16:07] rejoice in the lord always
[1:16:08] and i say rejoice let your moderation be
[1:16:12] known unto all men
[1:16:13] the lord is at hand be careful for
[1:16:15] nothing
[1:16:16] but in everything by prayer through sex
[1:16:18] and supplication with thanksgiving
[1:16:20] let your request be known under god and
[1:16:23] here we go the peace of god which passes
[1:16:26] all understanding
[1:16:27] shall keep your hearts and mind to
[1:16:30] christ jesus
[1:16:31] he didn't say frustration depression fed
[1:16:34] up i can't take it no more
[1:16:35] this is my last time no and the peace of
[1:16:39] god
[1:16:39] which passeth all understanding shall
[1:16:42] keep your hearts
[1:16:43] and minds to christ jesus then the
[1:16:46] blessing come finally brethren
[1:16:48] whatsoever things are true not lies
[1:16:52] whatever things are true whatsoever
[1:16:55] things are honest
[1:16:57] whatever things are just whatever things
[1:16:59] are pure
[1:17:01] whatever things are lovely whatever
[1:17:03] things of a good report
[1:17:05] if there be any virtue if there be any
[1:17:08] praise think on
[1:17:09] these things he didn't say baccanal he
[1:17:12] didn't say lies
[1:17:13] he didn't say bad report he didn't say
[1:17:16] negative
[1:17:17] look this was disclosing and verse nine
[1:17:21] those things which you have both learned
[1:17:24] and received
[1:17:25] and heard and seen in me
[1:17:29] do and the court of peace shall be in
[1:17:31] you
[1:17:32] now we go to colossians we're almost
[1:17:34] there we're heading down to ephesians
[1:17:37] book of colossians chapter 1
[1:17:41] and paul are praying in verse nine of
[1:17:44] chapter one he said for this course
[1:17:45] colossians we also since the day we
[1:17:48] heard it
[1:17:49] do not cease to pray for you and to
[1:17:52] desire that you might be filled with the
[1:17:53] knowledge of his will
[1:17:55] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:17:57] understanding
[1:17:58] so now you see that colossians is solid
[1:18:01] stuff that paul is presenting to this
[1:18:03] christian policy
[1:18:05] he said verse 10 that you might walk
[1:18:08] worthy of the lord
[1:18:10] unto all pleasing being fruitful in
[1:18:13] every good work
[1:18:14] and increasing in the knowledge of god
[1:18:17] eleven strengthen with all might
[1:18:19] according to his glorious power under
[1:18:21] all patience and long suffering
[1:18:23] and joyfulness giving thanks unto the
[1:18:26] father which had made us meet
[1:18:28] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:18:30] the sins and light
[1:18:31] who had delivered us hallelujah from the
[1:18:34] power of darkness and has translated us
[1:18:36] you see the level he's talking here in
[1:18:37] this church this is a higher level again
[1:18:39] has translated us into the kingdom of
[1:18:41] his dear son in whom
[1:18:42] we have redemption through his blood
[1:18:45] even the forgiveness of sins
[1:18:47] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:18:49] he's just glorifying jesus
[1:18:51] glorifying god who is the image of the
[1:18:53] invisible god the first born of every
[1:18:55] creature
[1:18:55] for by him were all things created that
[1:18:58] in heaven
[1:18:58] that are in earth visible and invisible
[1:19:01] whether there be thrones or dominions or
[1:19:03] principalities or powers
[1:19:05] all things were created by him and for
[1:19:07] him with 17
[1:19:09] and he is before all things and by him
[1:19:11] all things consists
[1:19:13] and he is the head of the body the
[1:19:14] church who is the beginning
[1:19:17] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:19:20] things he might have the preeminence
[1:19:22] for it please the father that in him
[1:19:25] should all fullness dwell and having
[1:19:27] made peace
[1:19:28] through the blood of his cross by him he
[1:19:31] reconciled
[1:19:32] all things unto himself by him i see
[1:19:34] whether there be things in
[1:19:35] it things in heaven and you that were
[1:19:38] sometimes
[1:19:39] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[1:19:42] wicked works yet know how to reconcile
[1:19:45] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:19:47] to present you holy
[1:19:49] and unblameable and unreportable in
[1:19:52] sight
[1:19:53] so solid people getting if verse 23
[1:19:56] you continue in the fate grounded
[1:20:00] and settled and peanut move away from
[1:20:03] the hope of the gospel
[1:20:04] which you have heard and which was
[1:20:06] preached to every creature which is
[1:20:08] under heaven
[1:20:09] wherever i paul i made a minister who
[1:20:11] now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[1:20:13] and fill up that which is behind of the
[1:20:16] afflictions of christ in
[1:20:17] my flesh for his body's sake and way of
[1:20:21] i am made a minister according to the
[1:20:23] dispensation of god which is given to me
[1:20:25] for you to fulfill the word of god even
[1:20:28] the mystery
[1:20:29] which had been hit from ages and from
[1:20:31] generations but now is made manifest to
[1:20:33] his saints
[1:20:34] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:20:37] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:20:39] among the gentiles which is christ in
[1:20:42] you
[1:20:43] hope of glory whom we preach warning
[1:20:45] every man
[1:20:46] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:20:49] that we mean
[1:20:50] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:20:53] christ
[1:20:53] jesus wherefore i also leave as private
[1:20:57] according to his working
[1:20:58] which worked in me mightily and
[1:21:01] let's go on to chapter two and he said
[1:21:04] you know
[1:21:05] for i would that he knew that great
[1:21:08] conflict i have for you
[1:21:09] and for them at laodicea and for many i
[1:21:12] have not seen my flesh facing
[1:21:13] facing the flesh that their hearts might
[1:21:16] be comforted
[1:21:17] being knit together in love into all
[1:21:19] riches of his full assurance of
[1:21:21] understanding to the acknowledgement
[1:21:23] of the mystery of god so he's going
[1:21:24] deeper in whom
[1:21:26] the street are hidden all the treasures
[1:21:30] of wisdom and knowledge now let's
[1:21:32] compare that
[1:21:33] to the corinthians church where he said
[1:21:36] like bates hebrews like babes they can't
[1:21:39] they can't take meat give them milk is
[1:21:41] talking about treasures
[1:21:43] knowledge wisdom and this was for
[1:21:46] at least any man should be guide you
[1:21:48] with enticing words
[1:21:50] for do i be absent in the flesh yet i am
[1:21:52] with you in the spirit
[1:21:54] joy in behold in your order
[1:21:57] so this is a quality church colossians
[1:22:00] as you have received christ jesus the
[1:22:02] lord
[1:22:03] to walk in him rooted and
[1:22:06] built up in him established in defeat as
[1:22:09] you have been
[1:22:10] taught abounding their own returns given
[1:22:13] beware caution beware at least any man
[1:22:16] spoil you
[1:22:18] through philosophy and vein deceit after
[1:22:21] the tradition of
[1:22:22] men after the rudiments of the world not
[1:22:25] after christ for him
[1:22:27] dwelleth the fullness of the godhead
[1:22:29] bodily
[1:22:30] and you are completing him which is a
[1:22:32] head of all principality and power
[1:22:34] in whom also you are circumcised with
[1:22:37] the circumcision
[1:22:38] made without hands so this is paul
[1:22:41] fleshing it out now
[1:22:42] concerning the realm of the spirit
[1:22:44] circumcision
[1:22:46] made without hands in putting off the
[1:22:48] body of the sins of the flesh
[1:22:50] by the circumcision of christ buried
[1:22:53] with him in baptism
[1:22:54] wherein you are risen with him through
[1:22:56] the fate
[1:22:57] of the operation of god what raised him
[1:23:00] from the dead
[1:23:01] and you being dead in your sins and this
[1:23:04] uncircumcision of your flesh had he
[1:23:05] quickened
[1:23:06] together with him having forgiven you
[1:23:08] all trespasses
[1:23:10] blurting out the unwriting of ordinances
[1:23:12] that was against us
[1:23:13] which was contrary to us and took it out
[1:23:15] of the way
[1:23:16] nailing to the cross and having spoiled
[1:23:19] principalities and powers
[1:23:21] he made sure of them openly transferring
[1:23:23] over them
[1:23:24] verse 16 let no man therefore judge you
[1:23:28] in meat
[1:23:29] or in drink or inspect in holiday
[1:23:32] or new moon or sabbaties which are
[1:23:35] shadow of things to come but the body is
[1:23:38] of christ
[1:23:39] let no man so paul wasn't just exhorting
[1:23:42] them on the word
[1:23:43] and exalting them in mysteries or
[1:23:44] revelations and so on he was giving them
[1:23:47] warnings that no man
[1:23:49] the value of reward and voluntary
[1:23:51] humility
[1:23:52] worshipping of angels intruding into
[1:23:54] those things which he had not seen
[1:23:56] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
[1:24:00] and not holding the head verse 19 from
[1:24:02] which all the body by joints
[1:24:04] and bands of nourishment ministered
[1:24:07] and knit together increase it with the
[1:24:09] increase of god
[1:24:10] she's comparing christ's body as a
[1:24:13] physical body
[1:24:14] that have to be lit together therefore
[1:24:16] wherefore if you be dead with christ
[1:24:18] from the rudiments of the world why as
[1:24:20] though living in this world are you
[1:24:22] subject to ordinances
[1:24:23] touch not taste not handle it which we
[1:24:26] all perish with using
[1:24:28] after the commandments of doctrines of
[1:24:29] men which things have indeed a show of
[1:24:32] wisdom
[1:24:33] in will worship and humility and
[1:24:34] neglecting of the body
[1:24:36] not an honor into the size fan of the
[1:24:37] flesh but chapter three
[1:24:39] this we're going to wrap up here if you
[1:24:42] be risen with christ
[1:24:44] seek those things which are above so you
[1:24:46] sing a different
[1:24:47] action word not you're in christ and
[1:24:50] you're a christian
[1:24:51] and they go to church you don't have to
[1:24:52] seek nothing you believe the message you
[1:24:54] believe a prophet no
[1:24:55] if you be risen with christ seek
[1:24:59] those things which above where christ
[1:25:01] sitted on the writing of god
[1:25:03] verse 2 set your affections on things
[1:25:06] above not on things that the earth
[1:25:08] the car will perish the roof will rotten
[1:25:10] your wish will get rusty
[1:25:11] this will happen this will break down
[1:25:12] you gotta fix your bathroom you gotta
[1:25:14] fix this you have to fix that
[1:25:16] things will always go that way set your
[1:25:18] affections and things above
[1:25:19] do what you have to do but you want to
[1:25:21] set your affections
[1:25:22] on things above okay for you are dead
[1:25:26] and your life is hidden in christ which
[1:25:28] is in god
[1:25:29] then he said you know watch verse 8.

[1:25:38] anger

[1:25:51] in knowledge
[1:25:52] after the image of him that created him
[1:25:54] verse 11
[1:25:55] and there is neither jew greek nor jew
[1:25:57] circumcision or uncircumcision
[1:25:59] barbarian skinny and bundle free but
[1:26:01] christ is all and
[1:26:02] all put on there for verse 12 as the

[1:29:07] doesn't give you
[1:29:09] forgive me tonight who have blessed us
[1:29:11] with all spiritual blessings
[1:29:13] in heavenly places in christ according
[1:29:16] as he has chosen us
[1:29:17] in him before the foundation of the
[1:29:19] world that we should be
[1:29:21] holy without blame before him in love
[1:29:23] having predestinated us
[1:29:25] onto the adoption of children by jesus
[1:29:27] christ himself
[1:29:28] according to the good players he
[1:29:30] couldn't share this with the corinthians
[1:29:32] church
[1:29:32] he could even start and approach this
[1:29:34] with the hebrew church relationships
[1:29:36] forget it
[1:29:36] then still fight number the law you
[1:29:38] understand what i'm saying but here it
[1:29:40] is
[1:29:40] but this church you could tell that you
[1:29:42] are predestinated
[1:29:44] to the abduction of children by jesus
[1:29:45] christ to the praise of his glory of his
[1:29:47] grace
[1:29:47] wherein he has beat us accepted and
[1:29:49] beloved in whom we have redemption to
[1:29:51] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[1:29:54] wherein according to the graces of his
[1:29:56] grace
[1:29:57] this hate wherein he are abundant
[1:29:59] towards us in all wisdom and prudence
[1:30:01] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:30:03] israel
[1:30:04] according to the good pleasure which had
[1:30:06] purpose in himself
[1:30:08] what is this that in the dispensation of
[1:30:10] the fullest of times
[1:30:11] one he might guard it together in one
[1:30:14] all things in christ both which are in
[1:30:17] heaven
[1:30:17] which are on earth even in him in whom
[1:30:20] glory
[1:30:21] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:30:23] being predestinated
[1:30:25] according to the purpose of him
[1:30:29] who look at all things after the concept
[1:30:31] of his own will
[1:30:32] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:30:34] glory who was trusted in christ
[1:30:36] in whom he also trusted after he heard
[1:30:39] the word of truth
[1:30:40] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:30:43] after he believed
[1:30:44] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:30:47] promise
[1:30:48] which is the illness of our inheritance
[1:30:50] until the redemption of the precious
[1:30:52] possession
[1:30:53] unto the praise of his glory so this
[1:30:54] holy spirit is a down payment
[1:30:56] of all inheritance that's what that is
[1:30:59] about
