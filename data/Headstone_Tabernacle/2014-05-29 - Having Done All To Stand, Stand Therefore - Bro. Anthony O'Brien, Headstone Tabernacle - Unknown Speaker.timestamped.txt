[43:07] years 400 years
[43:09] maybe they didn't see a sign of it but
[43:11] that word was circling in the air that
[43:14] word was circling in the atmosphere a
[43:17] virgin shall conceive a virgin shark and
[43:19] thief
[43:20] she was from before the foundation of
[43:21] the world
[43:23] but she had to come forth in a certain
[43:24] hour at a certain day at a certain
[43:28] certain time that name had to be
[43:30] manifested
[43:32] whoever that mary was she had to be
[43:34] manifested in her time
[43:36] and nobody else could respond to that
[43:38] name in the word when it was called out
[43:43] hallelujah
[43:44] there was only one blessed mary
[43:47] there was only one highly favored mary
[43:49] the angel couldn't say that to just
[43:51] anybody
[43:52] the angel can proclaim that to just any
[43:54] woman
[43:56] the angel was looking for a specific
[43:58] name on the book
