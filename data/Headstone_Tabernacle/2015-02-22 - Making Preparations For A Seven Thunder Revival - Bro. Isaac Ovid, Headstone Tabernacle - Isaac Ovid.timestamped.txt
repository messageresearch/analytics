[14:35] terrible experience the results was a
[14:37] bit confusing to to the doctor who
[14:39] concluded it could be a minor stroke but
[14:41] needed a second opinion from his senior
[14:44] after hearing of the readings Thursday
[14:47] 18th I had an appointment at the clinic
[14:49] it was also verified by the senior
[14:51] doctor that it could have been a minor
[14:53] stroke and with questionings my
[14:55] performance after exercise was given and
[14:57] my immediate recovery had been

[27:14] does when God speaks to a man he give
[27:16] him ambition amen when God speaks to a
[27:19] man he gives him Faith to do it to
[27:23] accomplish to achieve what his purpose
[27:26] in life is what God called him to do and
[27:30] he called us to be the Church of
[27:34] godallah the Church of God not a
[27:38] Trinidad Church of God that's why you
[27:41] hear me say I don't represent Trinidad I
[27:43] represent the kingdom of the most high
[27:45] God there's only one kingdom yes sir and
[27:48] only one Lord and there's only one faiu
[27:52] and there's only one baptism and there's
[27:54] only one true message that God send by a
[27:57] messenger yes isn't that right so he
[28:00] said let us make it a purpose in our
[28:01] life to see that we are the church yes

[28:07] church or part of the church you have to

[28:29] you want to empower it you want to
[28:31] strengthen it you want to support it
[28:33] because it's your church isn't that
[28:35] right okay so he said now watch let's
[28:40] let's have ambition not sit around and
[28:43] says uh because the Jon just want it
[28:46] what do we care about it if they don't
[28:47] do it let's do it anyhow Amen in other
[28:50] words if somebody don't want to sweep

[44:43] completely to you that you would take
[44:45] over this service Lord for however long
[44:47] it's supposed to be father we are under
[44:50] expectation for the delivering power of
[44:52] God to drop into the church this morning
[44:54] Lord I'm not here to preach this morning
[44:56] Lord but oh God just to be an instrument
[44:59] that you could speak to your people
[45:01] father Lord may this be one of those
[45:03] five minute Services where the Holy
[45:04] Ghost will just pour out Lord Lord
[45:06] that's my expectation father we have
[45:09] lived under the ministry of the word for
[45:11] all these years Lord Lord let the
[45:13] ministry of the spirit drop down here
[45:15] this morning and bring life to the word
[45:17] of God this morning granted now in the
[45:20] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[45:22] church
[45:23] s amen you may be seated this
[45:26] morning
[45:29] Hallelujah so my title this morning
[45:32] making
[45:33] preparations for seven Thunder Revival
[45:37] amen making making preparations for a
[45:41] seven Thunder Revival and my subject the
[45:44] spirit of Revival and my inspiration dig
[45:48] a valley full of
[45:51] ditches making preparations for seven
[45:55] Thunder Revival
[45:57] so now we are under expectation for a
[46:00] seven Thunder Revival yes sir we are
[46:03] under expectation for a seven T Revival
[46:06] just like Simeon was under expectation
[46:08] to see the Christ and the Bible said
[46:11] that Simeon was just and devout the only
[46:13] way you can get the Holy Ghost is to be
[46:15] just and devout the 3,000 after the day
[46:18] of Pentecost were just and devout and
[46:20] the Holy Ghost Came Upon them Cornelius
[46:23] was just and devout and he prayed all
[46:25] the time a memorial when went up to
[46:27] heaven for his prayers so I ask you a
[46:30] question this morning are you looking
[46:31] for the seven Thunders are you looking
[46:33] for your promise are you looking for
[46:35] your prophecy because July 3rd July 4th
[46:39] July 5th we are looking for a seven on
[46:41] the Revival to break out in this island
[46:44] to move around the world so we are under
[46:47] expectation I don't know about you but
[46:49] I'm under expectation and when you are
[46:51] under expectation you got to make
[46:53] preparation for it that's why I'm saying
[46:56] this
[47:01] [Applause]
[47:25] [Applause]
[47:37] [Applause]
[47:40] [Music]
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:57] of what you are supposed to receive and
[47:59] you catch that Revelation and begin to
[48:02] make preparation for it something is
[48:04] going to happen to you in the message
[48:06] expectation butam said talking about
[48:08] Noah so he was expecting it to rain so
[48:11] he made preparations for the rain oh I
[48:13] like that oh make preparation as long as
[48:16] you hear God's word then make
[48:18] preparation for it's going to happen and
[48:21] you wait under expectations but the Bram
[48:23] said oh that makes me start feeling
[48:25] religious
[48:27] it makes me feel religious to think now
[48:30] if God has promised a
[48:32] Revival are you with me this morning if
[48:34] God has promised a Revival we are going
[48:37] to have
[48:38] it we are going to have a Revival I'm
[48:42] not asking you this morning this is not
[48:44] a discussion this morning this is not a
[48:46] negotiation this morning if God said
[48:48] we're going to have a Revival you better
[48:50] be S we're going to have a Revival but
[48:53] the bandam said let's make ready for it
[48:55] I feel like making ready this morning
[48:57] for a 7 T
[49:02] Revival brother brandom said you may be
[49:04] seated move out everything get ready we
[49:07] are right in time he said it'll seem
[49:10] foolish now you might say well how is
[49:13] going to happen in a day like this and
[49:15] when all this I don't care what anything
[49:17] contrary is to that is wrong we can't
[49:20] see it I see no hope of it look like but
[49:23] if God said so let's do it anyhow
[49:25] because God said so and I see this
[49:28] morning Noah had to make preparations
[49:31] because the rain was coming Esther had
[49:33] to make preparations because she was
[49:35] going to see the king when God was ready
[49:38] to deliver the children of Israel he had
[49:40] to make preparations so he raised up
[49:42] Moses when God was ready to anoint a
[49:45] king he had to make preparations so
[49:47] Samuel had to go find David when God was
[49:50] ready to announce that he was going to
[49:52] come he had to make preparation so he
[49:54] say Isaiah let everybody know a virgin
[49:57] is going to conceive uh when God was
[49:59] ready to establish the faith he raised
[50:02] up Jesus Christ when God was ready to
[50:05] restore the faith he raised up William
[50:07] Barian branam and when God is ready to
[50:10] give the devil the final knockout punch
[50:12] he is preparing a
[50:15] [Applause]
[50:21] people
[50:23] hallelujah hallelujah and listen you may
[50:27] be seated in order for us to give the
[50:30] devil the knockout punch in order for us
[50:33] to finish this battle once and for all
[50:35] we have got to pass through a certain
[50:38] road to this destination and that road
[50:40] is a 7even ton Revival no Revival no
[50:43] Victory no Revival no Deliverance no
[50:47] Revival no restoration so we are here in
[50:50] Trinidad to declare Lord send the
[50:52] Revival send the Revival send the
[50:55] Revival we need a
[50:59] Revival
[51:04] hallelujah
[51:05] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the
[51:09] father of the prodigal son he was under
[51:12] expectation for his son to come home so
[51:15] he made preparation for it he knew his
[51:17] son was going to come back at some point
[51:19] it doesn't matter how far you run once
[51:21] your genetic makeup is connected to your
[51:23] father you know it's only one place you
[51:26] could go back you don't belong to the
[51:27] devil so you might run around the
[51:29] devil's Kingdom for a long time but
[51:32] after a while there's an eagle to Eagle
[51:34] call and you sat to rate a minute the
[51:37] Bible says he came to his senses and I
[51:40] believe this morning some sons are
[51:41] coming to their senses to realize who
[51:44] God is to realize who they are to
[51:46] realize who the devil is and they are
[51:48] coming home and that prodigal son he
[51:51] made
[51:52] preparations you may be
[51:54] seated you may be seated he put a calf
[51:57] in a room but Anthony he said give that
[52:00] calf extra
[52:02] food give that calf extra food but we
[52:05] normally feed calves only two portions
[52:07] you say no give it a double portion I
[52:09] want that half
[52:11] overweight I want that calf extra fat
[52:14] why I don't I don't need to tell you why
[52:17] I do what I do just prepare it just
[52:20] prepare it and I can imagine when that
[52:22] father saw the son coming home he said
[52:24] now bring her the fatted calf start the
[52:27] oven cooking we're going to have roast
[52:29] calf we're going to have stew calf we're
[52:32] going to have calf on the grill we're
[52:34] going to have kyab calf but my son has
[52:36] come home and God is making preparations
[52:39] because some sons are coming home and we
[52:41] are making preparations for a seven
[52:43] toner

[56:47] there are three kinds of believers they
[56:49] are unbelievers they are make Believers
[56:52] and they are True Believers this morning
[56:54] I'm not preaching to the unbelievers we
[56:56] have some in the house today I'm not
[56:58] preaching to the make Believers we have
[57:00] some of those too but I know there are
[57:02] some True Believers I know there's some
[57:04] true believers who have been holding on
[57:06] for a long time saying Lord where is the
[57:10] Lord God of Elijah where is the Lord God
[57:13] of Malachi 4 where is the manifestation
[57:16] of seven live voices where is the same
[57:19] God the same signs the same wonders the
[57:22] same power the same
[57:25] miracles
[57:30] you may be seated you may be seated the
[57:33] devil is trembling this morning because
[57:35] the devil don't mind you come to church
[57:37] and sit dead but you know when you may
[57:39] be seated you know when somebody gets a
[57:41] coma or they get a heart attack sometime
[57:43] they Flatline and you have to rub the
[57:45] charges together and and the body jumps
[57:49] up the devil don't mind you come the
[57:50] church and sit still but if we

[58:19] Hallelujah by the time this service is
[58:21] over I want to see everybody on their

[58:28] is a Revival that leads to the
[58:30] restoration of your youth all of you
[58:32] starting to lose hair like me if you're
[58:35] like me and you're losing your hair this

[59:02] you may be
[59:04] seated brother brandham said a Revival
[59:07] will cause five things it'll bring souls
[59:10] to Christ it will bring church back the
[59:13] church back to the original spiritual
[59:15] condition it will bring back close
[59:17] communion with God it will bring
[59:19] Fellowship among the churches and he
[59:21] will bring back praying for the
[59:24] sick anyway way outside of a Revival is
[59:30] politics but when the Revival does this
[59:33] it brings True Fellowship it will bring
[59:35] souls to Christ it will bring back the
[59:37] church to the church an alpha
[59:42] condition
[59:45] Hallelujah everybody feeling
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:52] fine I almost was I I I almost said
[59:56] you didn't expect this this morning but
[59:58] I'll be wrong because of your
[1:00:00] expectation is why we having this this
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:11] morning in the message making a valley
[1:00:13] full of ditches brother the random said
[1:00:15] that's what we need today or
[1:00:17] tonight is a good old fashion
[1:00:21] Backwoods sin killing sky blue religion
[1:00:24] yes sir by the time the Serv is over
[1:00:26] everybody all week all week this week
[1:00:29] when you meet people I want to challenge
[1:00:30] you
[1:00:32] oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost Revival that's the anthem for this
[1:00:40] week what are you looking for
[1:00:42] oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy
[1:00:46] Ghost Revival but the brand said you
[1:00:48] long to see a church where sin cannot
[1:00:50] stay in the church and I believe we're
[1:00:52] coming back to that old fashion sky blue
[1:00:56] sin killing Holy Ghost
[1:00:58] Revival GL hallu so we have established
[1:01:02] two
[1:01:02] things we need to make
[1:01:05] preparations for what you
[1:01:08] expect and we are under expectation for
[1:01:12] a Revival yes sir so we're making
[1:01:14] preparations amen for the Revival
[1:01:16] Hallelujah and I was sharing this with
[1:01:18] someone just yesterday I said you are
[1:01:21] always preparing for something your
[1:01:25] action or your inaction is preparing you
[1:01:28] for something if you have an exam to
[1:01:30] write your action should be to study for
[1:01:33] the exam so you can pass the exam if you
[1:01:36] do not study you are preparing for
[1:01:40] failure so no matter what you doing you
[1:01:43] are preparing for something when you are
[1:01:45] praying and you are just and devout you
[1:01:48] are preparing for the Holy Ghost when
[1:01:50] you don't pray when you are not just
[1:01:53] when you are not devout you are
[1:01:54] preparing for the tribulation
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:58] am amen before the Lord brought this
[1:02:02] message to me like this I really wanted
[1:02:03] to speak on preparing for the
[1:02:06] tribulation but I T about over it I'm
[1:02:08] not sure how that's going to go
[1:02:11] over because a lot of people are
[1:02:14] preparing for the
[1:02:17] tribulation and I was in a conversation
[1:02:20] couple weeks ago about if you are not
[1:02:23] looking for the Holy Ghost you might as
[1:02:24] well have a very good tribulation
[1:02:26] survival
[1:02:29] plan if you are not
[1:02:32] desperate for the Holy Ghost to be all
[1:02:35] inside of you Hallelujah you better have
[1:02:37] a good plan to survive the
[1:02:39] tribulation Hallelujah because people
[1:02:42] take it for granted that just coming to
[1:02:43] church will prepare you for the
[1:02:46] Rapture up to yesterday somebody was s
[1:02:48] saying to me they just read the Bible
[1:02:50] and they say their prayer and in their
[1:02:52] mind that's all
[1:02:54] right that's all right if you want to go
[1:02:56] to the
[1:02:57] tribulation that's preparation for the
[1:03:00] tribulation but if you are in the bride
[1:03:02] and you are prepared for the rapture we
[1:03:04] require a bit more than
[1:03:09] that if you come to church when you want
[1:03:12] go home when you want you are actually
[1:03:15] preparing for the
[1:03:18] tribulation when a wife is not
[1:03:20] reverencing her husband I don't care how
[1:03:22] many quotes you read how many hours you
[1:03:25] pray you are preparing for the
[1:03:27] tribulation
[1:03:29] amen if you hold one or you hold one
[1:03:32] Grudge you are preparing for the
[1:03:35] tribulation and I challenge you if you
[1:03:37] want to prepare for the tribulation make
[1:03:39] sure you have a good
[1:03:41] plan three and a half years can't buy or
[1:03:45] sell without the
[1:03:48] mark hunted persecuted especially if
[1:03:50] you're a Remnant you in the church the
[1:03:53] enemy coming to get you because the
[1:03:54] bride already slipped out amen amen
[1:03:59] amen some people never thought about
[1:04:04] that it's meant to be
[1:04:07] thought-provoking you know you're in
[1:04:09] trouble when you come to church and you
[1:04:10] don't see certain people in church one
[1:04:12] day you might have just missed
[1:04:15] it that's hard to preach a brother
[1:04:17] called me some time ago when I preach a
[1:04:19] message rapturing condition and uh he
[1:04:21] called me he said but Isaac I had a
[1:04:23] problem with what you said in the
[1:04:24] service I said really
[1:04:26] he said you told the church that
[1:04:28] everybody's not going to the Rapture I
[1:04:29] said the prophet said
[1:04:32] that he said it's butam said only a few
[1:04:35] people going to make it he said it's so
[1:04:37] few they're not even going to notice the
[1:04:38] Rapture took place so should I tell
[1:04:40] everybody you all go into the Rapture
[1:04:42] when you come to church when you want
[1:04:44] you you want to cut your hair you want
[1:04:45] to wear what you want you want to play
[1:04:47] games you want to flirt with the world
[1:04:49] should I tell you you go into the
[1:04:50] Rapture no that's that our pray is that
[1:04:53] everybody gets prepared but your action
[1:04:56] determines your
[1:04:58] destination brother Bram said I don't
[1:05:00] care what you say it's what you
[1:05:04] live your life is a
[1:05:06] testimony husband love your wife you
[1:05:09] could read quotes from this morning to
[1:05:11] this evening study it exer the scripture
[1:05:14] read it in the Amplified if you don't
[1:05:15] love your wife you are preparing for the
[1:05:18] tribulation am because the Bible said
[1:05:21] full obedience to the word will entitle
[1:05:23] you to the token yes so it means the
[1:05:27] expectation of what we are supposed to
[1:05:29] do is different from the Pentecostal
[1:05:31] church it's different from the Methodist
[1:05:33] Church it's different from the Baptist
[1:05:35] Church but we are preparing for the
[1:05:37] rapture we are preparing for the
[1:05:40] resurrection and we are preparing for 7
[1:05:42] T
[1:05:49] Revival let me get out of
[1:05:52] there from the message the third seed
[1:05:54] but bam said no that's the reason today
[1:05:57] the Revival that we're supposed to have
[1:05:59] we have denominational revivals we
[1:06:01] haven't had a real stirring no no no no
[1:06:02] no no no no no no no no don't think we
[1:06:04] got revivals we haven't oh we got
[1:06:07] millions and millions and millions of
[1:06:08] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[1:06:11] but the B said the bride hasn't had a
[1:06:13] Revival
[1:06:14] yet see there's been no Revival there no
[1:06:17] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:06:20] we are looking for it it'll take those
[1:06:22] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[1:06:25] wake her up again he will send it he
[1:06:28] promised it can the church say
[1:06:31] Amen you may be seated so what are you
[1:06:34] saying brother Isaac I'm saying that
[1:06:37] everyone in the message who rejected the
[1:06:40] seventh Thunders because that is what
[1:06:41] br's message he said the bride hasn't
[1:06:44] had a Revival yet it will take the seven
[1:06:46] Thunders yes sir so if it will take the
[1:06:48] seven Thunders and you don't preach the
[1:06:50] seven tunders you are not looking for
[1:06:52] any kind of a
[1:06:54] Revival
[1:06:56] the seven Thunder Revival is the prize
[1:06:58] Revival if there's no seventh Thunder
[1:07:00] Revival there will be no Rapture if
[1:07:02] there's no seven th Revival there will
[1:07:04] be no Resurrection because seven tunners
[1:07:06] will gather the bride seven tunners will
[1:07:08] give the bride Faith seven tunders will
[1:07:11] show the bride how to go and the
[1:07:14] manifestation of God the still the bride
[1:07:17] will be a manifestation of those seven
[1:07:21] Thunders Let the Church Say
[1:07:24] Amen
[1:07:27] it's always been about the seven
[1:07:29] Thunders way back before the foundation
[1:07:31] of the world that's why the sons of God
[1:07:33] was shouted for Joy they were in a seven
[1:07:36] T
[1:07:41] Revival amen that's why the devil knows
[1:07:44] he's finished this morning because the
[1:07:46] whole creation is groaning travailing
[1:07:49] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:07:52] in in other words the whole creation is
[1:07:54] grown in feeling for a seventh and a
[1:07:57] Revival the trees are looking for the
[1:07:59] Revival the birds are looking for the
[1:08:01] Revival the animals are looking for the
[1:08:03] Revival call me oldfashioned but I know
[1:08:06] what I want I want the oldfashioned sky
[1:08:09] blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival you
[1:08:13] may be
[1:08:14] seated in the message influence but BR
[1:08:17] said what we've seen happen but Isaac
[1:08:20] why are you doing this this morning I am
[1:08:22] doing this because we are preparing for
[1:08:24] a 700 re B yes sir I cannot speak for
[1:08:28] any other church for any other group but
[1:08:30] as a minister in this Sovereign local
[1:08:33] church headstone Tabernacle it is my
[1:08:35] duty to God to get ready for a seven
[1:08:37] toner Revival

[1:08:42] going to help me who's going to help me
[1:08:44] this morning who's going to help me
[1:08:47] because brother Bram said you may be
[1:08:48] seated what we've seen happen should put
[1:08:52] every soul into action it should make a
[1:08:55] church
[1:08:56] that would make a Revival here in
[1:08:59] Trinidad I claim it by faith here in
[1:09:01] Trinidad that people would fly in from
[1:09:03] Europe is that what's going to happen
[1:09:06] in in a few months flying from Europe to
[1:09:09] see what taking place they say there's a
[1:09:12] place in sangri
[1:09:14] Grandy called headstone Tabernacle a
[1:09:17] city called I'm reading a
[1:09:19] quote sangry Grandy there's something
[1:09:22] broke out there until the seven thunders
[1:09:24] of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote
[1:09:27] in the Bible is being manifested I'm not
[1:09:30] afraid to say it I'm not afraid to
[1:09:33] declare it we are under expectation for
[1:09:37] it Amen brother

[1:10:28] sure I have my ticket to board a raptor
[1:10:31] Express and I'm not packing any bags

[1:10:54] seventh and the Revival

[1:12:26] right down wait till them seven Thunders
[1:12:28] utter their voices to that group who can
[1:12:31] really take the word of God and hand it
[1:12:34] there it'll slice and cut and it can
[1:12:36] close the heavens they can shut this or
[1:12:38] do that whatever they want to is that
[1:12:40] what we're looking for is that what
[1:12:43] you're on expectation
[1:12:45] for you may be seated Hallelujah I'm
[1:12:48] about to wrap with this part and just
[1:12:49] hit my text and we're going to leave
[1:12:51] with a
[1:12:52] shout a Revival is to revive the seed
[1:12:56] that's planted in
[1:12:58] you that's why we can't waste time when
[1:13:01] we come to the
[1:13:05] pulpit this is not entertainment this is
[1:13:09] preparation we don't have time to waste
[1:13:12] nor do we have services to waste that's
[1:13:14] why you can't afford to miss church
[1:13:16] Hallelujah because you're getting ready
[1:13:18] for a destination so a Revival is to
[1:13:21] revive the seeds that's planted in you
[1:13:24] so seeds had to be planted
[1:13:26] under the ministry of the word we were
[1:13:29] planting seeds for a sth and the Revival
[1:13:32] Now understand this the devil
[1:13:35] understands this
[1:13:36] principle so his only move you know when
[1:13:39] you're playing chess you have certain
[1:13:41] moves his only move was to try to plant
[1:13:45] seeds of
[1:13:48] error because when the rain falls it
[1:13:51] will only bring up seeds so the rain
[1:13:54] that's why but brandham said Revival
[1:13:55] always produces
[1:13:58] twins because the rainfall on the just
[1:14:00] and the unjust it's the seeds that in
[1:14:03] you will determine the outcome the
[1:14:05] problem is this when the rain falls it's
[1:14:08] too late to
[1:14:10] plant that's why but brandham said I am
[1:14:12] very zealous of the kind of seed I'm
[1:14:16] planting because the real rain is coming
[1:14:19] so that's why this morning we are
[1:14:21] bringing back these courts to receive
[1:14:23] the people in case you forgot about
[1:14:25] about it in casee you have not been
[1:14:26] focused on it to remind you that we have
[1:14:29] to be under expectation for our
[1:14:32] promise the rest of the message World
[1:14:35] they don't need this but you need it
[1:14:37] because we're going to the
[1:14:40] Rapture oh you you didn't hear me this
[1:14:43] morning you may be
[1:14:45] seated on this island there are 40
[1:14:48] message
[1:14:48] churches sometime ago I heard a tape a
[1:14:51] brother spent his entire service
[1:14:52] preaching about ser and Seed the entire
[1:14:55] message on serpent seed serpent seed is
[1:14:58] not my
[1:15:00] promise serpent seed is not my
[1:15:02] inheritance you spend two and a half
[1:15:04] hours talking about serpent
[1:15:07] seed that's information that's not
[1:15:10] Revelation you can read that and come
[1:15:11] and that's why I always say anybody
[1:15:13] could preach you
[1:15:14] know take some CH some scriptures put it
[1:15:17] together but rightly dividing the word
[1:15:19] to prepare people for the Rapture that's
[1:15:21] a different
[1:15:22] Ministry that's a different Ministry but
[1:15:25] the bride cannot be deceived that's why
[1:15:28] when a word comes to you there's
[1:15:29] something that wait wait wait this food
[1:15:31] you know they say you have to eat for
[1:15:32] your blood type anybody ever heard
[1:15:36] that eat right for your blood type so if
[1:15:38] your blood type is AO certain food just
[1:15:41] work with you when you're eating food
[1:15:42] for somebody would be positive it don't
[1:15:43] feel right you never knew why you were
[1:15:45] sick for the last 20 years and you was
[1:15:47] eating whole wheat bread and really your
[1:15:49] blood don't handle whole whe bread well
[1:15:52] your blood type is not AO is not
[1:15:55] positive it's it's Jesus
[1:15:58] blood and this blood can only take
[1:16:00] certain good food so we are here to eat
[1:16:03] right for our blood
[1:16:14] type you may be seated so whenever you
[1:16:17] listen to a tape or you read some you
[1:16:19] hear somebody say something and and it
[1:16:21] don't digest you're not digesting you
[1:16:23] don't you you you eat chicken feel good
[1:16:25] you eat fish you feel good you eat beef
[1:16:27] you why you feeling something something
[1:16:30] wrong your blood type can't take
[1:16:34] it because your genetics your genes come
[1:16:36] from God and God love you so much he
[1:16:40] keeps his word wrapped up for you so
[1:16:42] when you cut a slice of this cake and
[1:16:43] slice of this thing it's like man when I
[1:16:45] eat this I don't have to worry when I
[1:16:47] eat this I don't gain weight I don't
[1:16:49] lose
[1:16:54] weight
[1:17:00] are we having a time this
[1:17:01] morning so God had to wait all these
[1:17:05] years but bam in condemnation by
[1:17:08] representation in 1960 he said no wonder
[1:17:11] God can send the Revival he's got
[1:17:14] nothing to build it on but then he goes
[1:17:17] on and say then speaking about the
[1:17:20] future he'll take individuals and build
[1:17:23] it on them individuals and declare them
[1:17:26] before the world conditional listen who
[1:17:30] stay with the
[1:17:34] word the court doesn't say then he will
[1:17:38] take this group and build it on that
[1:17:40] group then he'll take this church and
[1:17:42] build it on that church he said then
[1:17:45] he'll take
[1:17:46] individuals and build it on them
[1:17:48] individuals and declare them they don't
[1:17:51] have to declare themselves he will
[1:17:53] declare them to the world who stay with
[1:17:56] the
[1:17:57] word so situations had to come to see if
[1:18:01] there would be individuals who would
[1:18:04] stay with the
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:08] word you know and it's so interesting
[1:18:10] about staying with the word you know a
[1:18:13] lot of
[1:18:14] people it's it's it's really a tragedy
[1:18:17] how people take brother branham's
[1:18:19] message and twist it to their
[1:18:22] convenience so brother brandham said
[1:18:24] stay with your pastor
[1:18:25] he'll see you
[1:18:27] through
[1:18:29] amen but brother bam say if the man
[1:18:31] leaves the word leave the
[1:18:32] man run for your life so you have to
[1:18:36] know how to write the Divide of script
[1:18:37] your pastor taking it down teaching all
[1:18:39] kind of false Doctrine sometime ago we
[1:18:41] got an email from a brother in another
[1:18:43] country in the message preaching how you
[1:18:45] could have more than one
[1:18:47] wife stay with your pastor he will take
[1:18:49] it
[1:18:50] through are you kidding me what is the
[1:18:53] fastest shoe Nike has to to run
[1:19:00] with and some ministers use it to beat
[1:19:03] with fear stay with your pastor he see
[1:19:04] you true stay with your pastor he see
[1:19:05] you true and you're teaching the wrong
[1:19:06] thing stay with what that's why Paul
[1:19:09] gave the Supreme example he said follow
[1:19:11] me as I follow Christ in other words I'm
[1:19:15] giving you permission to mark my
[1:19:18] papers because if I stop following
[1:19:20] Christ please stop following me give us
[1:19:23] some more preachers who would teach the
[1:19:25] church follow me as I follow Christ
[1:19:28] because the moment I stop following
[1:19:30] Christ run for your
[1:19:38] life you may be seated I said it to the
[1:19:42] church before if brother oid preaches
[1:19:45] something off the word brother brandham
[1:19:46] told us how to deal with it go into the
[1:19:49] office bring the scriptures bring the
[1:19:51] quotes talk about it and if he is still
[1:19:55] persuaded and it's off the word brother
[1:19:57] I'm the first person I'm going straight
[1:20:00] to R
[1:20:01] clo hike through
[1:20:04] Tamina stay with your pastor you take it
[1:20:07] take me through what I'm trying to go to
[1:20:08] the Rapture I am following my pastor as
[1:20:11] he follows
[1:20:15] Christ that is correct teaching you may
[1:20:18] be SE
[1:20:20] it some pastors going to be shaken with
[1:20:22] this
[1:20:23] tape
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:32] oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy
[1:20:36] Ghost
[1:20:38] Revival but the random love to see the
[1:20:41] church on the word and that's why you
[1:20:42] have to have a revelation and we going
[1:20:44] to touch it a bit later on you have to
[1:20:45] have a revelation you have to pray to be
[1:20:47] in this
[1:20:50] church you should not be in this church
[1:20:52] if you're not sure you're in this church
[1:20:54] that's right
[1:20:56] because we have never forced anybody to
[1:20:58] come to this
[1:20:59] church I'm not trying to drag come to
[1:21:02] church now come to no no no no you pray
[1:21:04] to God and ask him if this should be
[1:21:06] your home church and Bram said if you
[1:21:09] are in a church you identified with that
[1:21:14] church why Alla didn't put this in the
[1:21:16] bathroom why all you who is all are you
[1:21:18] in the church you're not in the church
[1:21:20] all right all right come on why nobody
[1:21:23] clean it why nobody clean is this your
[1:21:25] church or is not your
[1:21:27] church who's supposed to do this who
[1:21:30] suppos are you in this church or you're
[1:21:31] not in the
[1:21:32] church whose responsibility
[1:21:35] responsibility it is if you are in this
[1:21:40] church
[1:21:42] oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy
[1:21:47] Ghost
[1:21:47] Revival but the Bram said he longed to
[1:21:50] walk into a church and everything is in
[1:21:53] order in other words the culture of the
[1:21:57] church has to change to a
[1:22:00] oldfashioned sky blue in other words in
[1:22:03] other words you are Vigilant sir to
[1:22:06] fight to protect the word in the church
[1:22:09] and the Order of the church nobody
[1:22:11] should come into this church and upset
[1:22:15] things your sword is always drawn to
[1:22:18] protect the
[1:22:22] wood to protect the
[1:22:28] word and we have to encourage one
[1:22:30] another to stay with the word why
[1:22:32] because we want to have a
[1:22:35] Revival you may be seated in other words
[1:22:39] there's going to come an end to us
[1:22:40] standing up and speaking like this you
[1:22:42] know when the day of Pentecost come and
[1:22:45] the fire fell there was no more
[1:22:46] preaching and teaching Jesus already did
[1:22:48] that in his resurrection Ministry it was
[1:22:50] just time for fire Peter didn't have to
[1:22:52] preach To The Man by the gate called
[1:22:53] Beautiful it was just one statement
[1:22:55] silver and gold I don't have but such as
[1:22:58] I have I give it unto you that's it rise
[1:23:00] up and walk
[1:23:02] fire that's what we're talking about he
[1:23:06] was in his Revival come on now oh I
[1:23:09] don't know how I got over
[1:23:11] there I was reading this quote he'll
[1:23:15] take individuals and build it on them
[1:23:17] individuals and declare them before the
[1:23:20] world who stay with the
[1:23:22] word situations had to to come to see if
[1:23:25] there would be individuals who would
[1:23:27] stay with the word
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:32] that's can we take some more this
[1:23:34] morning so we have established we are
[1:23:36] making preparations for our seventh and
[1:23:39] Revival so we spoke a bit about making
[1:23:42] preparations we spoke a bit about
[1:23:44] Revival now brother brandham said in
[1:23:46] that message making the valley full of
[1:23:49] ditches he said you can't have a b a
[1:23:51] ball game unless you get in the spirit
[1:23:54] of the ball game you have got to get in
[1:23:58] the spirit of it yes sir and we can
[1:24:00] never have a Revival in sheveport or
[1:24:02] anywhere else until the church gets in
[1:24:06] the spirit of
[1:24:07] Revival God can come and perform
[1:24:10] Miracles he can show wonders he can
[1:24:12] stretch forth his hand to heal the sick
[1:24:14] and The Afflicted the preacher can
[1:24:16] preach a gospel as hard as he can but
[1:24:18] they'll never be a Revival until the
[1:24:20] church gets in the spirit of
[1:24:23] Revival and that's why I want to sow
[1:24:26] these seeds in the church about the
[1:24:27] spirit of Revival because in a few
[1:24:29] months we looking for manifestation of
[1:24:31] that
[1:24:32] revival can the church say
[1:24:35] Amen let me get ready to wind down
[1:24:40] now but joy said it take my
[1:24:44] time so we're going to do a little bible
[1:24:47] study now from the book of second Kings
[1:24:50] chapter 3 and as I was studying it and I
[1:24:52] want to really encourage the church
[1:24:54] brother R him in the same message make a
[1:24:56] value full of dishes he was saying that
[1:24:57] a real Christian loves to read the
[1:25:00] Bible and a lot of people in the message
[1:25:02] they may know quot but they don't know
[1:25:04] the Bible all right all right and a lot
[1:25:06] of people who believe I'll use the word
[1:25:10] believe they were in the seventh under
[1:25:11] inspiration don't know brother bram's
[1:25:13] quotes they know phrases they know
[1:25:16] statements but they don't really
[1:25:17] understand what the entire picture is
[1:25:20] about and you have to be vigilant to
[1:25:23] stay on point I could pick five young
[1:25:26] people and ask them certain things and
[1:25:28] they can tell me the name of Jay-Z and
[1:25:31] Beyonce's baby but they can't tell me
[1:25:33] the name of Jeff Ty
[1:25:38] son and they might say well why I need
[1:25:40] to know
[1:25:41] that but if you are making preparations
[1:25:44] for the Rapture aren't you supposed to
[1:25:46] be interested in making sure you know
[1:25:48] what you need to
[1:25:49] know so we're going to do a little bible
[1:25:51] study this morning if that's all right
[1:25:52] so we in 2 Kings chapter 3 you can find
[1:25:54] if you want to follow with me or it's
[1:25:56] entirely up to
[1:25:57] you but for a background the year is
[1:26:00] around 850 BC 850 BC prior to this
[1:26:07] Israel had just gone through their
[1:26:08] transition God never wanted Israel to
[1:26:10] have any Kings it was always God leading
[1:26:13] his people and Israel came up with the
[1:26:16] brilliant idea we need a king like the
[1:26:18] amalekites like the Hittites like the
[1:26:20] jebusites like the Philistines and they
[1:26:22] picked the best looking guy the tallest
[1:26:24] guy broad his shoulders push-up situps
[1:26:27] everything dep pick Saul and while Saul
[1:26:30] is ruling God say I found a better
[1:26:33] man and God raises up King
[1:26:37] David so you have Saul then you have
[1:26:40] David then you had Solomon and these
[1:26:43] three kings had kept Israel
[1:26:46] United a lot of people don't realize
[1:26:48] that Israel actually had a major split
[1:26:52] in the Church of Israel as it was among
[1:26:54] the 12 tribes of Israel because when
[1:26:56] Solomon's son rabom was supposed to be
[1:26:59] king there was a split in Israel and
[1:27:03] Judah walked
[1:27:04] away Judah was the only tribe who
[1:27:07] resisted the reign of
[1:27:09] rabom that's why you have the lion of
[1:27:12] the tribe of Judah because after Judah
[1:27:14] split all the kings of Israel which
[1:27:18] would have been 10 tribes because
[1:27:19] Benjamin eventually joined Judah those
[1:27:22] 10 tribes almost every King was a
[1:27:24] disaster
[1:27:25] only in the tribe of Judah were they
[1:27:27] faithful to the House of
[1:27:32] David by this time King Ahab was king of
[1:27:38] Israel not of
[1:27:39] Judah King Ahab was king of Israel Judah
[1:27:42] was on their own at this point in time
[1:27:45] and the prophet at the day was Elijah
[1:27:48] and Elijah was the one we know Mount
[1:27:50] carel we know all about Elijah and go to
[1:27:52] Elijah pick a man to follow you and he
[1:27:56] drops the mantle on
[1:27:58] Elisha and Elisha became Prophet after
[1:28:02] Elijah is taken off the scene everybody
[1:28:05] with me a little bit Biblical history
[1:28:08] amen we could do more of that some of
[1:28:11] the time but take quite some time to get
[1:28:13] into that 2 Kings
[1:28:16] 3:1 now jehoram the son of Ahab began to
[1:28:21] Reign Over Israel in Samaria the 18th
[1:28:24] year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and
[1:28:26] reigned 12
[1:28:27] years so Ahab who we know was married to
[1:28:31] Jezebel Jezebel brother brandom calls
[1:28:33] her dog
[1:28:35] meat is the word cuz she painted her
[1:28:38] face painted face Jezebel she L makeup
[1:28:40] so all of you who love makeup brother
[1:28:41] bam call you dog
[1:28:43] meat because she brought a pagan Spirit
[1:28:46] into
[1:28:48] Israel and Jezebel and Jezebel's Union
[1:28:51] with Ahab produced jehoram yes
[1:28:55] jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign
[1:28:57] in Israel in Samaria Samaria was the
[1:29:00] capital of Israel and Jerusalem was the
[1:29:02] capital of Judah so jehoram takes over
[1:29:06] from Ahab to Reign Over Israel in
[1:29:10] Samaria while Jehoshaphat is reigning in
[1:29:14] Judah the seat of it being
[1:29:17] Jerusalem and jehoram the Bible said he
[1:29:19] wrote evil in the sight of the Lord but
[1:29:22] not like his father and like his mother
[1:29:24] what a
[1:29:26] testimony he was bad but not as bad as
[1:29:29] Ahab and
[1:29:31] Jezebel basically it was almost
[1:29:33] impossible the Bible said to be as bad
[1:29:35] as Ahab and
[1:29:37] Jezebel so jehoram takes over the
[1:29:40] kingship after Ahab and the Bible said
[1:29:43] for he put away the image of ba that his
[1:29:45] father had made so King Ahab was so
[1:29:50] backslidden was so messed up after all
[1:29:53] that God did all the years he builds an
[1:29:55] image of ba and tell Israel let's
[1:29:57] worship the image no wonder God was
[1:30:00] upset amen no wonder there had to be a
[1:30:02] mount carel
[1:30:04] shown we're in the Bible
[1:30:07] right jehoram takes over after Ahab is
[1:30:11] dead and destroys the image of B
[1:30:14] nevertheless the Bible said in verse
[1:30:16] three he cleaved unto the sins of Jobo
[1:30:20] the son of nebat which made Israel to
[1:30:22] sin he departed not there from in other
[1:30:25] words he gave up the idol worship but
[1:30:27] there were certain Pagan rituals he
[1:30:29] didn't want to give
[1:30:32] up there are number of ways to look at
[1:30:35] that because some people the moment you
[1:30:38] give up certain things from the world
[1:30:40] the enemy begins to push against you and
[1:30:43] so it was with him but butam said in
[1:30:46] making a valley full of ditches and when
[1:30:48] they went to select they got jehoram his
[1:30:51] son and her son you talk about Ahab and
[1:30:53] Jezebel now listen brother Bram now you
[1:30:55] wouldn't expect very much to come out of
[1:30:57] a marriage like that
[1:31:00] Lord so then we found that jeam had
[1:31:03] ascended to the throne he was a
[1:31:04] borderline believer just a halfway
[1:31:08] lukewarm
[1:31:10] believer so many in the world tonight
[1:31:12] jaram would just set his sail anywhere
[1:31:15] the wind blow that's the where jaram
[1:31:17] would go and that's what's the matter
[1:31:19] with the church today they set their
[1:31:21] sail to every form of Doctrine tossed
[1:31:24] about from Pillar To Post not knowing
[1:31:27] where to stand or what to do when the
[1:31:29] little Trials come up the little
[1:31:31] afflictions or away they go this way
[1:31:33] they are Methodist today Baptist
[1:31:35] tomorrow a Pentecostal next day a
[1:31:37] Lutheran the next day 7 Day Adventist
[1:31:39] Jehovah Witness in the message in the
[1:31:42] tunders Seven Seals six seals not sure
[1:31:45] fivefold no
[1:31:48] fivefold they don't know where to stand
[1:31:50] toss about borderline packing your
[1:31:52] church letter from one place another
[1:31:55] what good does it do
[1:31:58] anyhow so King jehoram listen don't get
[1:32:00] me wrong he's
[1:32:02] trying to correct what his father had
[1:32:05] done he's trying to be a Christian he's
[1:32:08] a good type of the make
[1:32:10] believer he is making an effort but he
[1:32:12] doesn't want to give up all of the
[1:32:15] sin but the fact that he's cutting ties
[1:32:19] with the Enemy and making the Right
[1:32:21] Moves the Bible said the moabites
[1:32:23] rebelled
[1:32:24] yes against
[1:32:26] Israel and Mesa king of Moab was a sheep
[1:32:29] master and rendered unto the king of
[1:32:31] Israel 100,000 lambs and 100,000 Rams
[1:32:34] with the wool but it came to pass when
[1:32:36] Ahab was dead that the king of Moab
[1:32:38] rebelled against the king of Israel and
[1:32:41] King jehoram went out of Samaria at the
[1:32:43] same time and numbered all of Israel in
[1:32:47] other words after jaram makes an effort
[1:32:50] to clean up his act the enemy wages war
[1:32:53] against
[1:32:55] because the way Ahab did things jehoram
[1:32:58] started to upset it and the moabites
[1:33:01] rebelled and jaram went out goes outside
[1:33:03] and numbers Israel counts and realize
[1:33:05] you know what he cannot go to war with
[1:33:07] the moabites he doesn't have enough men
[1:33:09] and he forms what I call an Unholy
[1:33:13] Alliance an alliance that was not of God
[1:33:16] the Bible says he went to call
[1:33:18] Jehoshaphat who was the king of Judah
[1:33:21] and said Jehoshaphat the king of Moab
[1:33:23] has rebelled against me will you go up
[1:33:26] with me and fight the moabites and but
[1:33:29] Bram called Jehoshaphat a righteous man
[1:33:32] but I want you to listen carefully but
[1:33:33] the Brom said I want you to notice how
[1:33:35] easy it is sometimes on a little
[1:33:38] persuasion for a Christian to get in the
[1:33:40] wrong company trying to be pity well I
[1:33:44] tell you I will just go down to the pool
[1:33:46] room listen carefully young people I
[1:33:47] won't play any pool but I'll go down
[1:33:49] there I'll go to the dance with Susie
[1:33:51] because she's a good girl and I maybe
[1:33:53] I'll win
[1:34:54] s on
[1:34:55] something so but Bram brought this type
[1:34:57] with Jehoshaphat and said here's what
[1:34:59] Jehoshaphat who was a righteous man what
[1:35:02] he was supposed to do was say jehoram
[1:35:04] let me pray about
[1:35:06] it and see if we should go to war but
[1:35:10] when jehoram calls Jehoshaphat
[1:35:11] Jehoshaphat says all right I'm coming my
[1:35:14] horses are your horses my men are your
[1:35:17] men let us go to fight the
[1:35:19] moabites and they asked how are we going
[1:35:21] to go they said we're going to go
[1:35:23] through Edom go through Edom and the
[1:35:26] Bible says so the king of Israel went
[1:35:30] and the king of Judah and the king of
[1:35:32] Edom now you know there's a problem with
[1:35:33] the king of Edom because we know it's
[1:35:36] jehoram king of Israel Jehoshaphat king
[1:35:39] of Judah and we have no name for the
[1:35:41] king of
[1:35:46] Edom and the Bible said they fetch a
[1:35:48] compass of seven days journey and there
[1:35:50] was no water for the host and for the
[1:35:52] cattle that followed them in other words
[1:35:54] they go walk to the moabites these three
[1:35:56] men and after seven days they ran out of
[1:36:00] water they're on foreign ground out of
[1:36:03] the will of God wow and that's how some
[1:36:06] of us find
[1:36:08] ourselves out of the will of God
[1:36:11] hallelujah Edom the king of Edom is like
[1:36:14] you know there's this guy in the group
[1:36:15] and you're not sure why he's
[1:36:19] there one of these things just don't
[1:36:21] belong here one of these things
[1:36:25] you have jaram Jehoshaphat and the king
[1:36:27] of
[1:36:30] Edom Genesis 25:30 and Esau said to
[1:36:35] Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same
[1:36:37] red pottage for I am faint therefore his
[1:36:40] name was called
[1:36:43] Edom and Jacob sent Messengers before
[1:36:46] him to Esau his brother unto the land of
[1:36:48] Sir the country of
[1:36:50] Edom now these are the generations of
[1:36:52] Esau who is Edom
[1:36:54] Genesis 36 thus dwelt Esau in Mount s
[1:36:57] Esau is Edom Genesis 369 and these are
[1:37:01] the generation of Esau the father of the
[1:37:03] in Mount
[1:37:05] s the relationship between Israel and
[1:37:08] Edom numbers 20 and Moses sent
[1:37:11] Messengers from Kadesh unto the king of
[1:37:13] Edom thus say thy brother Israel I want
[1:37:16] you to see the picture of this Unholy
[1:37:18] Alliance you have Judah who has a
[1:37:20] problem with Israel because they split
[1:37:22] since Solomon's son so they really not
[1:37:23] getting
[1:37:24] so they come together to fight the
[1:37:26] moabites and then on the way to Edom
[1:37:27] they pick up an unbeliever so you have
[1:37:29] Jehoshaphat a True Believer jaram a make
[1:37:32] believer and he pick up a unbeliever
[1:37:36] yes the had serious problem
[1:37:39] with both Israel and Judah numbers 20
[1:37:42] and Moses sent Messengers from Kadesh
[1:37:44] unto the king of Edom do say thy brother
[1:37:47] Israel now remember Israel Jacob and
[1:37:49] Esau were brothers thus say thy brother
[1:37:52] Israel thou knowest all the travail that
[1:37:55] had befallen us and Edam said unto him
[1:37:57] in 18 Thou shalt not pass by me L I come
[1:38:00] out against thee with the
[1:38:03] sword so Esau's children were holding
[1:38:07] The Grudge that they had with Jacob when
[1:38:10] Jacob wrestled with the angel and end up
[1:38:12] with the Birch right all Esau children
[1:38:14] have this
[1:38:15] Grudge so you are going to war with
[1:38:19] Judah Israel and somebody who don't even
[1:38:22] like
[1:38:22] you
[1:38:29] numbers 2020 and he said thou shall go
[1:38:31] through and Edom came out against him
[1:38:33] with much people and with a strong hand
[1:38:36] so here it is you come together a group
[1:38:37] of people who were always fighting one
[1:38:40] another numbers 20:21 does Edom refuse
[1:38:44] to give Israel Passage through his
[1:38:46] border wherefore Israel turn away from
[1:38:49] him good relationship
[1:38:52] right by the time he read a book of
[1:38:54] Judges then Israel sent Messengers unto
[1:38:57] the king of Edom saying let me I pray
[1:38:59] thee pass through thy land but the king
[1:39:01] of Edom would not hearken and in like
[1:39:03] manner is sent unto the king of Moab but
[1:39:06] he would not consent and Israel in
[1:39:09] Kadesh by the time Saul is king So Saul
[1:39:12] took the kingdom over Israel and fought
[1:39:15] against all his enemies on every side
[1:39:17] against Moab who they go and fight now
[1:39:19] against the children of Ammon we'll deal
[1:39:21] with them at a later service and against
[1:39:23] Edom yes same Edom and the kings of
[1:39:26] zobah next service and against the
[1:39:28] Philistine and the Bible said whereever
[1:39:31] he turn himself he vexed them so Saul
[1:39:33] pick a fight with everybody including
[1:39:37] Edom jehoram called Jehoshaphat
[1:39:41] Jehoshaphat say where are we passing
[1:39:43] passing through Edom Edom coming with
[1:39:45] them so I want you to understand how the
[1:39:49] story is being
[1:39:50] built and the king of Israel back make
[1:39:54] believer said alas the Lord had called
[1:39:56] these three things together to deliver
[1:39:58] them into the hand of
[1:40:03] Moab make believer say well we come here
[1:40:06] we claiming this ground you we just
[1:40:08] claim ground see God are claiming his
[1:40:09] ground and no water water means Life
[1:40:13] Church dead no movement nothing going on
[1:40:16] the only spiritual Bunch the only
[1:40:18] spiritual one in the bunch Jehoshaphat
[1:40:20] says is there not a prophet of the Lord
[1:40:24] yeah that we may inquire of the Lord by
[1:40:27] him
[1:40:28] Hallelujah is there not somebody with
[1:40:31] the spirit of
[1:40:33] Prophecy the testimony of Jesus because
[1:40:35] we have found ourselves in a problem the
[1:40:38] king of Edom has no clue I don't know
[1:40:41] what God he
[1:40:43] worships Israel just took down Bal and
[1:40:45] they still have some bad practices so
[1:40:47] Jehoshaphat is the only one saying is
[1:40:49] there not a prophet in the land
[1:40:52] on Hallelujah
[1:40:54] and somebody in Israel say
[1:40:56] um here is
[1:40:58] Elisha the son of shaffat which poured
[1:41:02] water on the hands of Elijah and I love
[1:41:05] this because one chapter before Elisha
[1:41:08] gets the mantle and we know that Elijah
[1:41:11] told Elisha if you see me go you'll get
[1:41:13] what you ask for but this scripture
[1:41:16] defines a relationship between Elisha
[1:41:19] and Elijah because when we would
[1:41:21] normally preach if you see me go we
[1:41:23] would think the relationship of Elisha
[1:41:24] following Elijah but this puts it into
[1:41:27] perspective Elisha is pouring water on
[1:41:30] Elijah's hands but the Bram said that's
[1:41:33] a good Association am in other words
[1:41:35] Elisha just wasn't following Elijah
[1:41:38] Elisha was right up on the elyra you
[1:41:40] need water look you need coffee look he
[1:41:42] was right
[1:41:44] there so when Jehoshaphat say is there
[1:41:46] not a prophet in the land somebody with
[1:41:49] the testimony of Jesus they say we have
[1:41:52] somebody he says what the tape
[1:41:55] say he was right with Elijah he so wash
[1:41:59] Elijah's hands he was he was this close
[1:42:02] to Elijah he will only do what Elijah
[1:42:05] did because he was he was right there
[1:42:06] with
[1:42:09] Elijah and I asked a question this
[1:42:11] morning is there not somebody in the
[1:42:13] land with the testimony of Jesus who
[1:42:15] could bring a true report of how we can
[1:42:18] have a seven tunder
[1:42:22] Revival
[1:42:24] you may be
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:31] seated Hallelujah and Jehoshaphat said
[1:42:34] in verse 12 the word of the Lord is with
[1:42:35] him to the king of Israel and
[1:42:38] Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom still
[1:42:40] with no name went down to
[1:42:43] him and Elisha says to the king of
[1:42:46] Israel what I have to do with thee
[1:42:49] what brother brandham said his righteous
[1:42:52] indignation got stirred up they say they
[1:42:55] got Elisha so upset he was out the
[1:43:00] spirit listen brother brother brandom
[1:43:03] said a man with double portion of what
[1:43:06] Elijah had got so upset he told Israel
[1:43:08] why they go to your God or your father
[1:43:10] or your
[1:43:11] mother and ask them to help you why you
[1:43:14] why you involving me in
[1:43:17] this Ela look you see a make believer
[1:43:20] unbeliever and True Believer he say if
[1:43:22] it wasn't for Jehoshaphat I don't even
[1:43:23] talk to all you he say I don't even look
[1:43:26] and I wouldn't even see you if it wasn't
[1:43:27] because of
[1:43:28] him I thank God for some True
[1:43:37] Believers because if it wasn't for the
[1:43:39] True Believers we wasn't getting out of
[1:43:41] this
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:52] hole
[1:43:55] praise God
[1:43:56] hallelujah verse 13 and Elisha said unto
[1:43:59] the king of Israel hallelujah what I
[1:44:01] have to do with thee get thee to the
[1:44:03] prophets of thy father and to the
[1:44:05] prophets of thy
[1:44:10] mother and Elisha said in verse 14 as
[1:44:13] the Lord of host liveth in other words
[1:44:15] as the Lord of God is before whom I
[1:44:17] stand surely if it were not I regard the
[1:44:19] presence of Jehoshaphat the king of
[1:44:21] Judah I would not look to thee nor see
[1:44:25] thee in other words I can look at you
[1:44:26] and even seeing you that's
[1:44:30] right can the church say
[1:44:37] amen huj hallelujah Give the Lord a hand
[1:44:39] of
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:52] praise
[1:45:06] Hallelujah with the bandom said that
[1:45:09] they got elishah so upset he was out the
[1:45:13] spirit and that's why brother Adam said
[1:45:15] you have to be in the spirit of Revival
[1:45:17] to see God moving
[1:45:19] him and in 2 Kings 3:15 and he says but
[1:45:22] now this is Elisha bring me a Minstrel
[1:45:25] amen bring me a musician and it came to
[1:45:28] pass that when the minstrel played that
[1:45:31] the hand of the Lord came upon
[1:45:34] Him Hallelujah in other words I said let
[1:45:36] me get in the spirit because if I in the
[1:45:38] spirit then I could talk to the Lord for
[1:45:41] you this mixed up group this mixed up
[1:45:43] Bunch you you guys going be upset but if
[1:45:45] I get in the spirit I will Overlook that
[1:45:47] and because of jehoshaphat's being just
[1:45:50] and devout I I will seek the Lord on
[1:45:52] your behalf somebody say
[1:45:54] amen you can't hear from God unless
[1:45:57] you're in the spirit
[1:45:59] amen and as the musician played the
[1:46:02] Bible says the hand of the Lord came
[1:46:04] upon him and Elijah said thus sayth the
[1:46:06] Lord th say the Lord make this Valley
[1:46:09] full of
[1:46:11] ditches for thus say the Lord he shall
[1:46:14] not see wind neither shall he see rain
[1:46:18] yet that Valley shall be filled with
[1:46:20] water that he may drink both and your
[1:46:23] cattle and your Beast yes sir and know
[1:46:26] you're only one water but this is what a
[1:46:29] light thing in the sight of the Lord he
[1:46:31] will deliver the moabites also into your
[1:46:33] hands and ye shall Smite every fence

[1:47:09] the Lord and when the atmosphere was
[1:47:12] right and when everything was in place

[1:51:18] in other words I don't want Moab to know
[1:51:20] you getting water I don't want the enemy
[1:51:22] need to know because if the enemy only
[1:51:25] knows he could do great damage but not
[1:51:28] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[1:51:32] all you got to do is dig the ditch all
[1:51:34] you got to do is dig your ditch not by
[1:51:36] might nor by power but by my

[1:51:48] seated Hallelujah you may be seated it's
[1:51:52] not going to be easy digging the ground
[1:51:54] is dry it's always easier to dig when
[1:51:56] the ground is wet you can move mud you
[1:51:58] can but the ground is dry it's a drought
[1:52:01] in the land it's a famine in the land
[1:52:03] not for books and tapes but for hearing
[1:52:05] the true word of God the ground is dry
[1:52:08] it's going to be hard digging but the
[1:52:09] more you dig the more you can receive
[1:52:12] the more you dig the more you worship
[1:52:14] the more you fight the more you press
[1:52:17] the more
[1:52:20] you did you bring your shovels this
[1:52:22] morning
[1:52:23] did you bring your shovels this morning

[1:53:22] was no water for seven days there was no
[1:53:25] water this is not one day this is not
[1:53:27] two days this is seven days I would like
[1:53:29] to think that throughout all the
[1:53:30] scripture but the brandom said no
[1:53:32] scripture contradicts itself it's all
[1:53:34] one Revelation it's one great mystery
[1:53:36] but the Bram said if you read the Bible
[1:53:38] and don't see Jesus in every scripture
[1:53:41] in every verse you need to read it again
[1:53:43] and I wonder God could have done it in 5
[1:53:46] days he could have done eight days he
[1:53:48] could have done three days but he said
[1:53:49] for seven days they have no water for
[1:53:52] seven Church
[1:53:53] [Music]
