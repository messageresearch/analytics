[39:06] verse 8 and the voice which I heard from
[39:08] Heaven speaking unto me again and said
[39:10] go and take the little book which is
[39:11] open in the hand of the Angel which
[39:13] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[39:16] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[39:18] him give me the little book and he said
[39:22] unto me take it eat it up it shall make
[39:25] thy belly bitter but it shall be in my
[39:26] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[39:29] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[39:31] ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as
[39:32] honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[39:35] was bitter and he said unto me thou must

[40:44] angel which was Malachi 4 here that's

[40:48] things and when John tried to worship
[40:51] the prophet said no no no no see thou do
[40:54] it not I am of thy fellow servant and of
[40:57] Brethren that have the testimony of
[40:59] Jesus worship God for the testimony of

[41:06] blessed be the name of the Lord so we re
[41:07] see what the Lord will do tonight oh
[41:10] blessed be the name of the Lord now we
[41:12] find out that he said here
[41:15] now that God promised he said be careful
[41:18] God has promised Malachi for for this
[41:20] last day and he said at that time
[41:22] Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but
[41:24] it must be fulfilled for it is the gerti
[41:28] word of God spoken by Malachi the
[41:30] prophet Jesus referred to it it is to be
[41:33] just before the coming of Christ the
[41:34] second time listen close all scripture
[41:38] that has not been fulfilled must be
[41:40] before that time here we go are you
[41:43] ready the Bible is to be finished the
[41:46] Gentile dispensation is to be finished
[41:48] with the church age when this anointed
[41:51] messenger Ares of course he will plant
[41:54] the seed of the entire Bible
[41:57] Plumb from the serpent to the messenger
[41:59] in the form of rain I want you to get
[42:01] that he going to plant what the seed of
[42:04] the entire Bible so the message of the
[42:07] hour that come to us is the seed of the
[42:09] entire Bible and if God put that seed
[42:12] then that seed have to come to life oh
[42:14] praise the name of the Lord isn't that
[42:15] right all right so what he said now he
[42:18] will be rejected by theal people as his
[42:21] forefathers John and Elijah as was
[42:23] spoken by the Lord all right let's go
[42:25] now
[42:26] the first thing we want to draw your
[42:28] attention to is the infallibility of
[42:30] God's word God keeps his word to the
[42:33] letter and tonight we want to fasten our
[42:37] thoughts on that that God keeps his word
[42:39] we can rest assure of anything that God
[42:41] has said in his word to be the truth and
[42:44] Faith does not rest upon the shifting
[42:46] sounds of man ideas or man's theology
[42:49] but it has its final rest in place on
[42:51] the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal Word
[42:54] if God said it that is forever the truth
[42:57] he can never take it back and say I did
[43:00] not mean it I can say things and you can
[43:03] say things and we are PR to have to take
[43:05] it back because we said it with the best
[43:07] of our knowledge with the best of our
[43:09] ability but then God is so much
[43:11] different from us he is infinite
[43:14] therefore he does not say one thing
[43:16] unless it is absolutely perfect he never
[43:20] has to take it back he never has to
[43:22] apologize for what he has said it always
[43:26] stand as the truth even for Jesus in
[43:29] this great day when God really slay his
[43:32] son for sins of the world was perhaps
[43:34] thousands of years before even the
[43:35] foundation was ever laid God spoke the
[43:37] word and it's a finished product in
[43:39] heaven when God speaks it it's already
[43:42] finished that's the part I want to get
[43:43] tonight when God speaks it it's
[43:47] finished so in God's world speaking it
[43:51] it's good as if it's done it have no
[43:54] future it have no no past it is never
[43:57] present so when he speaks it it's good
[44:00] as done in other words it's finished
[44:03] once it come out of his mouth so he can
[44:05] say my word shall not return unto me
[44:08] void but it shall accomplish the purpose
[44:11] and the design what I set it up to do is
[44:14] going to bring it to pass Oh Glory to
[44:17] God so shall my word be oh Hallelujah
[44:20] Give the Lord some Praises tonight he
[44:22] said your thoughts are not my
[44:24] thoughts Hallelujah your ways are not my
[44:27] ways he already said that so you don't
[44:29] have the thoughts of God we have to
[44:30] catch the thoughts of God oh praise God
[44:33] Amen Hallelujah I love that tonight all
[44:35] right so watch what so watch so even God
[44:39] spoke the word it's a finished product
[44:41] in heaven when God speaks it it's
[44:42] already finished oh if we could only
[44:45] grasp what that means what different
[44:47] people we would be to see in his books
[44:51] the judgments that is placed in here for
[44:53] the disobedient it would make a man
[44:56] examine himself hour by hour it would
[44:58] make the righteous Rejoice hour by hour
[45:01] to read the blessings that God has
[45:03] promised to the faithful and we can rest
[45:05] assured that every word will be
[45:07] fulfilled just anchor our soul on it it
[45:09] always been that way the
[45:12] prophet only looking off and seeing
[45:16] something he is talking about what he's
[45:18] looking at he ain't thinking about here
[45:22] what you look like now he is looking
[45:25] what it's going to
[45:27] be and when he speaks that if it is in
[45:30] the word of God is already been spoke
[45:33] and there is nothing in the world can
[45:35] stop it you see that's right only God
[45:38] himself he speaks his vision the prophet
[45:41] does now sometimes he speak good things
[45:44] he speaks of your healing all right you
[45:46] might think it just can't happen I I
[45:48] haven't got any better then what does
[45:50] that do that just brings the judgments
[45:52] of God upon you that's right see Jesus
[45:55] Pro promise to save you if you believe
[45:57] it if you don't believe it it won't
[45:59] happen to you you've got to accept it
[46:00] you've got to believe it see you got to
[46:02] know where it's coming from and that
[46:04] gives your faith in God or your Prophet
[46:07] you got to believe it now we find out
[46:09] here that when these prophets spoke they
[46:13] spoke and what they said come to pass if
[46:16] the wrath of God is pour upon the people
[46:18] there's only one thing if that Prophet
[46:20] said something another going to happen
[46:21] there's only one thing that will stay
[46:24] the hand of God that is
[46:27] repentance that's the only

[52:13] a way to redeem woman that woman and he
[52:17] promised her that sometime in the future
[52:21] the true word would come to her again
[52:24] the true word will be made known to her
[52:27] remember because he promised Christ
[52:29] through the woman and Christ is the word
[52:31] s John 1 in the beginning was the word
[52:34] the word was with God and the Word was
[52:37] God and the word became flesh and dwell
[52:40] among us he was the word here we go
[52:44] before a word it's a
[52:47] thought and a thought has to be
[52:51] created so God thoughts become
[52:57] creation when it was spoke by a
[53:03] word that is when he presented to you as
[53:06] a
[53:07] thought his thoughts is revealed to you
[53:12] then it is still a thought until you
[53:14] speak
[53:16] it sir so let's see if we could break
[53:18] down down
[53:20] tonight before a word is a thought
[53:24] before you express it in word form
[53:26] verbal it's a thinking thing and he say
[53:29] a thought has to be created so God
[53:32] thoughts become creation when it is
[53:35] spoke by a word so let's go back to
[53:37] Genesis in the beginning God
[53:40] said let there be light the thought a
[53:44] creation of God the expression by his
[53:47] mouth the word and there was light oh
[53:50] give the Lord some Praises so God's
[53:53] Channel and ability for fulfillment has
[53:57] been to the channel of thought word
[54:01] expression oh give the Lord a shout in
[54:03] the house and God is not changing from
[54:06] that so for this thing to happen
[54:09] according to Revelation 10 Hallelujah
[54:12] the bride must prophesy again oh give
[54:15] the Lord a shout glory to God there must
[54:18] be a fresh Prophecy of the prophecy okay
[54:21] the Lord you got to speak it if it's
[54:24] revealed to you you got to express it
[54:26] there is going to be Revival in Trinidad
[54:28] Oh Glory to God we speak it a seven ton
[54:31] Revival it have a name he said let there
[54:33] be light have a name he called the light

[55:07] studying the word if you're not reading
[55:10] the word if try to get into the spirit
[55:12] of the word how you catch the thoughts
[55:14] created to speak the word amen even
[55:18] prophesy your own deliverance and your
[55:20] own breakthrough and your own Victory
[55:21] and over your own family how you going
[55:22] to do that because you have to have
[55:24] faith like God to do that you know he
[55:26] said my word shall not return me void he
[55:28] don't have to look for a manifestation
[55:29] he just get his word out out yeah he
[55:31] just have to get it out of his mouth hey
[55:34] glory to God did you get that tonight he
[55:36] not worried it just have to come from
[55:38] thought to word and out his mouth and he
[55:40] could just walk away oh give the Lord
[55:42] some Praises knowing his word can't be
[55:45] turned void knowing it can't come back
[55:47] empty knowing it's got to be fulfilled
[55:50] hey glory to God his word is a prophecy
[55:53] Oh Glory to God and tonight I am
[55:56] claiming I am believing we have the
[55:57] testimony of Jesus which is the spirit
[56:00] of Prophecy that has been anointing us
[56:02] all these years Oh Glory to God we have
[56:04] been working with the testimony of Jesus
[56:07] which is the spirit of Prophecy and one
[56:09] of these days we will say like Peter

[56:25] hallelujah
[56:26] hallelujah let's go one more time before
[56:30] a word it's a thought and a thought has
[56:34] to be created so God
[56:37] taught become creation when it's spoke
[56:41] by a word so that's why we have the word
[56:44] expressed and becomes a word seed before
[56:48] it's a real seed because when God speak
[56:51] the word let there be light that was a
[56:53] seed that that word itself was a seed it
[56:56] could take a millon years for light to
[56:57] come that's the real manifestation of
[57:00] the word seed but it's a word seed so

[59:41] do you understand where we going tonight
[59:44] it will be God thoughts dropping down
[59:46] upon your heart when you speak is not
[59:48] your thoughts Oh Glory to God when you
[59:51] speak is God's Own word hey
[59:57] amen
[59:59] hallelujah do you see it tonight all
[1:00:02] right hear this he said now that's the
[1:00:05] reason Moses went out to pray that
[1:00:08] Pillar of Fire around him he said go
[1:00:11] hold your stick towards the east and say
[1:00:13] call for
[1:00:15] fly Moses that to call for fly if he
[1:00:18] call for fly but have fight
[1:00:20] coming there's no flies I'm reading but
[1:00:23] he went held the stick there and said
[1:00:26] let there be
[1:00:27] flies no flies at all yet went on back
[1:00:32] but the word God's thought has already
[1:00:36] been spoken it's a word now it's got to
[1:00:41] happen now don't you see where Jesus
[1:00:43] said if you say to this mountain not if
[1:00:45] I say but if you say to the mountain be
[1:00:48] moved and the first thing I guess in
[1:00:50] Moses time a big old green fly begin to
[1:00:53] buzz and afterwards there was 5 pounds
[1:00:56] per
[1:00:58] yard from one fly to five pounds every
[1:01:02] yard is 5 pounds of
[1:01:05] fly where did they come from God created
[1:01:08] them don't you see oh my Hallelujah so
[1:01:12] we can't get our own thoughts doing CXC
[1:01:15] and GC then God thoughts we can't get
[1:01:17] God thoughts doing GC and C exceeded you
[1:01:19] could study algebra and biology and what
[1:01:21] they not go
[1:01:23] thoughts subjects
[1:01:24] you I'm saying then God toses from his
[1:01:27] word so you have to be in the word to
[1:01:29] catch God thoughts Jesus said it this
[1:01:32] way the Holy Ghost will bring back
[1:01:33] things to your remembrance what I spoke
[1:01:35] to you you are human oh give the Lord
[1:01:38] some Praises you can't catch everything
[1:01:40] in one
[1:01:42] shot god account for your stage of
[1:01:45] growth in your Christian walk to give
[1:01:48] you dispense to you
[1:01:52] Revelation so as you grow you get more
[1:01:54] as he mature you get more he want to
[1:01:56] come from child to young man to Father
[1:01:59] praise God to know him from the
[1:02:01] beginning Oh Glory to God I call you
[1:02:03] young man because you're strong and
[1:02:04] overcome him praise God I call you
[1:02:07] fathers because you know him from the
[1:02:08] beginning there's a higher Revelation
[1:02:10] the father's get into a god
[1:02:12] Consciousness he talking about coming
[1:02:14] into full realization perfect
[1:02:16] realization to know where you come from
[1:02:17] who you are where you're going praise
[1:02:19] God oh glory to God a higher level to
[1:02:22] know just only not only what God has
[1:02:23] done but why he did it oh give the Lord
[1:02:26] some Praises glory to God all of that is

[1:02:31] God God pulling up his sons higher and

[1:02:41] his word and when you catch it is his
[1:02:44] thoughts coming to you then it becomes
[1:02:45] your thought because he reveal it to you
[1:02:48] and then when you speak it it's your

[1:04:22] think I believe she wanted have a baby
[1:04:24] or something so and and Bam spoke and
[1:04:27] the Lord spoke through him about you're
[1:04:28] going to have you're going to be healed
[1:04:30] or have a baby or something like that
[1:04:31] and she said she got among some doters
[1:04:33] and some friends and what he said who
[1:04:36] spoke and he said if God said it it
[1:04:38] doesn't matter who you get among it
[1:04:40] going come to pass because when when D
[1:04:43] say the Lord come is th say the Lord you
[1:04:46] you not nobody stopping that you know oh
[1:04:48] praise the name of the Lord all right
[1:04:50] let's
[1:04:50] go wait the prophet now he said this
[1:04:54] angel of Light to the Lan Church age
[1:04:57] that rejected Christ and his word right
[1:04:59] and he stood at the door knocking trying
[1:05:01] to get in the church age had rejected
[1:05:03] the Christ and Christ is the word had
[1:05:05] rejected it he was in the outside the
[1:05:07] only church age we have Christ on the
[1:05:09] outside knocking trying to get in now
[1:05:11] watch here we say now this is where you
[1:05:15] really need a man of God to put the word
[1:05:17] together to see the picture because B
[1:05:19] Bram put a prophetic Vision on that give
[1:05:21] us the panoramic it's like is like a
[1:05:25] puzzle if you have puzzle pieces and you
[1:05:27] never see the picture of the puzzle box
[1:05:29] how you making that now you can build it
[1:05:31] you know but boy that will take some
[1:05:34] time because you don't have a vision of
[1:05:36] what the pieces is about so the
[1:05:38] prophetic Vision gives you a panoramic
[1:05:41] yes sir of the cover of the puzzle box
[1:05:44] so there's a house here a cow here a
[1:05:45] coat here a door here whatever it is
[1:05:47] here then you have the pieces here now
[1:05:49] so as you start of fitting pieces you
[1:05:51] look at the box and you're fitting here
[1:05:53] you know this one this color is supposed
[1:05:55] to go here this supposed to go here and
[1:05:57] this is the beauty of this prophetic
[1:05:59] Vision you know where the pieces are
[1:06:02] fitting so when somebody preaching
[1:06:04] something out of timing you know it out
[1:06:05] of Tim because not supposed to be there
[1:06:08] the C what you doing on top the thing
[1:06:10] now the part may fit you know but the
[1:06:12] picture is not
[1:06:14] correct your fit people fitting things
[1:06:17] you know fitting belong there but they
[1:06:19] fit in it to connecting I said boys some
[1:06:23] connecting the water electrical line
[1:06:25] look trouble you know how how you pull
[1:06:27] that wire down
[1:06:29] there they fitting things but not
[1:06:33] according to the prophetic Vision that
[1:06:35] was released by seven sees and seven
[1:06:37] Thunders they not fit in it according to
[1:06:38] that Vision Hallelujah right division
[1:06:41] that's what God said that's what brother
[1:06:43] bam did and a five4 Ministry were
[1:06:45] supposed to come and make it plain not
[1:06:47] make it
[1:06:48] complicated Hallelujah and I have more
[1:06:50] relation than you make it plain that you
[1:06:53] who read it could run run with it give
[1:06:56] the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah
[1:06:59] hallelujah not you who read it get
[1:07:01] stunned no you may read it may run stand
[1:07:05] and run is two different thing some
[1:07:06] people say stand they can't move they
[1:07:08] get baptized in the brains with head
[1:07:11] knowledge all right so here we go watch
[1:07:14] brother BR the only church age that we
[1:07:17] have Christ on the outside knocking
[1:07:20] trying to get in and this Angel's
[1:07:23] message
[1:07:24] messeng that come from God was echoing
[1:07:27] his message on the earth to come out of
[1:07:29] Babylon come out of organizations this
[1:07:32] is what he said here now the Holy Spirit
[1:07:35] today the
[1:07:37] manifestation of the holy
[1:07:40] spirit is that
[1:07:44] angel trying to get the people back to
[1:07:48] the word because the holy spirit will
[1:07:52] only vindicate the word word it can't
[1:07:56] vindicate dogmas there's no life in them
[1:07:59] so the manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:08:02] is that angel go to the angel which
[1:08:04] angel angel in Trinidad angel in some
[1:08:06] church he P up in some church he pick he
[1:08:08] renting a room in a church somebody said
[1:08:10] this chch of the angel that you the
[1:08:11] angel that you the angel which Angel you
[1:08:13] talking
[1:08:14] about the manifestation of the holy
[1:08:16] spirit is that angel hallu trying to get
[1:08:20] the people back to what the word not
[1:08:22] their thoughts not their interpret not
[1:08:24] their dreams not their ideas the word
[1:08:26] because you can only vindicate what the
[1:08:28] word God will vindicate his word oh
[1:08:32] glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:08:35] because only the word have life it can't
[1:08:38] vindicate a Dogma there's no life in
[1:08:39] them and the church has built so many
[1:08:41] systems around the world until he shook
[1:08:44] them a rocker when he come so God has
[1:08:46] sent prophets to shake people off of the
[1:08:48] systems she had bird pains what was it
[1:08:52] back to the word word back to the life
[1:08:56] systems doesn't have a life it is only
[1:08:59] God's word that has life do you believe
[1:09:03] that it and and what the systems is
[1:09:06] built around it where does not and it
[1:09:09] does not have life it is the word that
[1:09:11] gives life so people come in this
[1:09:13] message and build systems around your
[1:09:17] message so the talking message talk but
[1:09:19] there's a system around it but only the
[1:09:21] word of life oh praise God hallelujah it
[1:09:25] is the word that gives you life all
[1:09:28] right Revelation 181 to4 says after
[1:09:30] these things I saw another Angel come
[1:09:31] down from heaven having great power and
[1:09:33] the Earth was lighted with his glory and
[1:09:35] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:09:37] saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is
[1:09:39] Fallen is become the habitation of
[1:09:41] devils the hole of every fou Spirit and
[1:09:43] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:09:44] bird and All Nations have drunk the wine
[1:09:47] of the wrath of a fornication and the
[1:09:49] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:09:50] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:09:52] of the Earth are wax rich through the
[1:09:54] abundance of her Delicacies verse four
[1:09:56] and I heard a another voice from Heaven
[1:09:58] saying come out of her my people that
[1:10:01] you be not partakers of our sins that
[1:10:03] you receive not our plagues now listen
[1:10:05] to how the prophet interpret that verse
[1:10:07] four now this Angel is the last
[1:10:09] messenger before the coming of Christ in
[1:10:11] the 19th Chapter of Revelation so this
[1:10:13] is Revelation chapter 18 the messenger
[1:10:16] voice if you notice when he gave his
[1:10:18] voice on the earth there was a voice
[1:10:20] echoed again in heaven fourth verse if
[1:10:22] you want to read it all right the fourth
[1:10:24] verse 199th chapter this Messenger on
[1:10:27] the Earth was so inclined with God until
[1:10:32] when he spoke it on Earth God echoed the
[1:10:34] same thing out of Heaven oh Hallelujah
[1:10:38] so when the prophet spoke on Earth Echo
[1:10:40] from Heaven that mean you could hear
[1:10:42] from heaven and you would hear the same
[1:10:44] voice that was spoken Oh Glory to God
[1:10:47] give the Lord a shout in the house now
[1:10:49] catch this here you are hearing the word
[1:10:53] you hearing what has been taught what
[1:10:54] has been shared what's been spoken what
[1:10:56] has been played what been echoed but the
[1:10:58] Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the
[1:11:01] revelation of Jesus Christ so hearing it
[1:11:03] is not the revelation of it the Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost have to take what you're hearing
[1:11:06] and reveal it to you then that become
[1:11:08] yours oh give the Lord some pray I want
[1:11:10] you to see it tonight when it's revealed
[1:11:13] to you it's absolutely yours the Devil
[1:11:15] Himself got take it out of you oh
[1:11:17] because God has revealed it un you okay
[1:11:19] we could go back in the word who do men
[1:11:21] say I the son of man am they say
[1:11:22] something you this that the other then
[1:11:24] Peter said th about the Christ he said
[1:11:25] Flesh and Blood ha not revealed this
[1:11:27] unto you he saying you heard from
[1:11:30] heaven and Upon This Rock I will build
[1:11:33] my church and the case of hell can
[1:11:35] Prevail against it so right away Peter
[1:11:37] knew he had a rock inside of there he
[1:11:39] had a key inside of there he had a
[1:11:40] foundation inside of here because faith
[1:11:42] is the foundation of the Christian
[1:11:44] experience and that rock Revelation is
[1:11:46] faith upon that rock you going pervert
[1:11:48] you and knowledge and Temperance and
[1:11:50] patience and godliness and brotherly
[1:11:51] kindness but it have to have a rock
[1:11:53] inside there oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:11:56] the house
[1:11:58] Glory
[1:11:59] Hallelujah do you see it now watch God
[1:12:03] echoed the S of Heaven what is the
[1:12:05] fourth ver translation what does it mean
[1:12:08] God's voice speaking to his
[1:12:12] predestinated people seeing come out of
[1:12:14] her just exactly what the voice was he's
[1:12:17] got people out there all through Babylon
[1:12:20] what is Babylon
[1:12:22] confusion so God's voice will come down
[1:12:25] in Trinidad and say come out of
[1:12:27] confusion come out of Babylon not
[1:12:30] talking about Roman thing you know that
[1:12:31] is outside we talking about inside a lot
[1:12:34] of confusion people confused come out
[1:12:37] get out you have to get it clean and
[1:12:39] clear you have to get clarity of vision
[1:12:42] and purpose to accomplish your mission
[1:12:44] because when God put somebody on Earth
[1:12:46] he G them a mission to accomplish and
[1:12:47] the vision of the mission had to be
[1:12:49] clean and clear Oh Glory to God take
[1:12:51] down the Philistines take down the Grove
[1:12:53] take down the altars Oh Glory to God
[1:12:55] take down Jero it had to be clean and
[1:12:57] clear you got be confused when you start
[1:12:59] to fight here oh God am I supposed to go
[1:13:00] here what I'm doing here what I'm doing
[1:13:02] here you're
[1:13:03] confused the vision has to be made plain
[1:13:08] oh praise God praise God hallelujah
[1:13:11] praise God let's continue Joel 2:28 says
[1:13:15] it shall come to pass
[1:13:16] afterwards that I will pour out my
[1:13:19] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:13:22] your daughters shall prophesy yes your
[1:13:23] old men shall dream dreams your young
[1:13:26] men shall see Visions so there's a
[1:13:28] direct scripture according to Joel that
[1:13:30] the spirit of Prophecy going to be here
[1:13:33] in the last days by your por of his
[1:13:36] Spirit now here the prophet now now the
[1:13:39] Bible said your sons and daughters shall
[1:13:41] prophesy now what does the word prophesy
[1:13:44] mean look it up it is to tell something
[1:13:47] under inspiration or forell something
[1:13:51] it's a compound word just just like
[1:13:53] sanctify means to be clean and set aside
[1:13:56] for service Joel said I will pour my
[1:14:00] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:14:02] your daughters shall prophesy now the
[1:14:05] word prophesy does not mean to
[1:14:08] teach so thou must prophesy again to
[1:14:11] many nations doesn't mean we going with
[1:14:12] a Teaching Ministry around the world to
[1:14:14] teach the prophecy is something
[1:14:17] different he specifically said the word
[1:14:20] prophesy does not mean
[1:14:23] teach the word prophesy means to tell an
[1:14:27] experience under inspiration to forell
[1:14:31] something that is fixing to take place
[1:14:34] oh give the Lord some Praises so this
[1:14:36] bride must prophesy again it's not this
[1:14:38] bride must teach again oh give the Lord
[1:14:39] some Praises I feel excited tonight I
[1:14:42] feel inspired tonight I feel it's
[1:14:45] getting clear tonight is not the bride
[1:14:47] going around the world teaching teaching
[1:14:49] teaching explaining interpretating no no
[1:14:53] no no I know other word interpretating
[1:14:54] just sound
[1:14:56] good just sound good
[1:14:59] interpretating so the bride not going
[1:15:01] wrong interpreting stuff the bride has
[1:15:04] to be a genuine echo of what the prophet
[1:15:08] said and my contention is this if a man
[1:15:10] truly eat the book from the angel he can
[1:15:13] only prophesy from the book Oh Glory to
[1:15:16] God because the book is the entire word
[1:15:19] oh Hallelujah let me say it again so
[1:15:22] watch now the word prophecy does not
[1:15:24] mean to teach the prophecy means to
[1:15:27] either tell an experience under
[1:15:30] inspiration as I say that I
[1:15:31] remember when the brotherly kindness and
[1:15:34] the anointing fell in 1981 some
[1:15:37] prophetic utterance was spoken and I
[1:15:39] remember the Lord saying the holy spirit
[1:15:42] is wanting to seal the whole thing that
[1:15:43] wasn't for kwell church you know that
[1:15:45] was for the bride body you know the holy
[1:15:48] spirit is trying to see the whole thing
[1:15:49] remember brother Kangle but where is the
[1:15:51] brotherly kindness he said and was just
[1:15:53] speaking the holy spirit is wanting to
[1:15:55] seal the whole thing but where is the
[1:15:57] brotherly kindness where is the spirit
[1:15:59] of
[1:16:01] forgiveness and at that time we didn't
[1:16:03] even have pyramid I don't think we had a
[1:16:04] pyramid in in the church in the building
[1:16:05] there we didn't even have that and right
[1:16:07] on top have the Holy Spirit my
[1:16:10] Lord hallelujah the Holy Spirit want to
[1:16:13] see the where's the brotherly kindness
[1:16:15] only a confusion and sword fighting and
[1:16:18] bitterness and anger and and no
[1:16:20] fellowship and and all kind of ducks
[1:16:23] they building instead of building the
[1:16:24] house of God they're building
[1:16:26] walls and every year they adding bricks
[1:16:28] and adding The Grudge and renewing the
[1:16:30] grud like renewing
[1:16:32] LIC they renewing The Grudge and
[1:16:34] renewing the ocean they continue the
[1:16:35] fight and they pass into the
[1:16:36] congregation the congregation have
[1:16:38] attitude to so do fight that's why I
[1:16:41] never want to be in that foolishness
[1:16:42] never Hallelujah M of nonsense going on
[1:16:45] I just say nothing El keep my mouth
[1:16:47] sealed cuz I don't want nobody try to

[1:17:20] verse 8 says and the voice that I heard
[1:17:21] from Heaven speak to me again saying go

[1:18:55] on the day of Pentecost these people are
[1:18:57] not drunk as you suppose but this is
[1:18:59] that who told Peter to say that he was
[1:19:01] anointed he was inspired he could go

[1:31:42] years the ups and downs that he had so
[1:31:45] Abraham life was a life of Prophecy he
[1:31:46] com in he com in all man sit down
[1:31:48] doctors come say Fed Up don't come back
[1:31:50] I check you ready you cannot get any son
[1:31:53] a check say already your wom dead long
[1:31:55] time stop it stop it old man he's still

[1:32:03] mean praise God praise God like the day
[1:32:05] after the weather gone bad see a big

[1:32:45] come walking and say I will return to
[1:32:47] thee according to the time of life and
[1:32:49] then the prophet prophesy he said you
[1:32:50] are beholding that se long enough the

[1:33:22] the very manifestation of living God

[1:33:26] watch the first son spoken seed son give
[1:33:28] him a bride to produce himself and the
[1:33:30] bride was given to produce himself again
[1:33:32] another Son of God but he fell right
[1:33:34] hyban did that now let's close it to us
[1:33:37] now from a little group of the true SE
[1:33:39] of the word not everybody will read the
[1:33:41] the message and you have to understand
[1:33:44] why Paul said all Israel is not Israel
[1:33:47] and but brah said he said that to show
[1:33:48] that not all the people that believe is
[1:33:49] in the bride
[1:33:53] because the message called three
[1:33:55] kinds including the foolish virgin and
[1:33:57] the wise but the wise make it into bride
[1:34:01] okay now watch it is bad now from the
[1:34:04] little group of the true seed of the

[1:34:21] if there see is planted the water will
[1:34:22] raise up again now I have got a big
[1:34:25] Hallelujah here's the secret the word is
[1:34:26] in the bride that's one part that's one
[1:34:29] part and the next part is and the mind
[1:34:30] of Christ which is the thoughts of God
[1:34:34] oh glory to God the word is in and then
[1:34:36] the thoughts of God coming down now
[1:34:37] which is the intelligence Hallelujah
[1:34:39] that's if only faculty pass the eyes the
[1:34:41] only thing could go beyond the prophet
[1:34:43] is the intelligence because the prophet
[1:34:44] brought the vision the entire Vision but
[1:34:46] the bride connect with with intelligence
[1:34:48] to know what he wants done who he Christ
[1:34:51] what he wants done with the word oh give
[1:34:53] the Lord I feel I feel the fire in the
[1:34:55] camp tonight hallelujah praise God the
[1:34:57] intelligence dropping down upon you
[1:34:59] glory to God giving you instructions
[1:35:01] what he wants done with the word Oh
[1:35:03] Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:06] here's the secret the word is in the
[1:35:08] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:35:10] what he wants done with the word and she
[1:35:12] does it in his name she has the say the
[1:35:16] Lord not the church she has oh give the
[1:35:19] Lord a shout that means her Can't Fail
[1:35:22] that means she is the final voice that
[1:35:25] means she will pack the voice of God in
[1:35:27] the last days oh give the Lord a shout
[1:35:30] God pack it in a prophet God going to
[1:35:32] pack it in a bride and no man could stop
[1:35:35] it I feel good tonight oh give the Lord
[1:35:37] some Praises oh I feel the angels flying
[1:35:40] back and forth in here tonight
[1:35:42] hallelujah praise God let's he as thus
[1:35:45] sayth the Lord it is gerti so the Holy
[1:35:48] Spirit Waters it until it's grown and
[1:35:50] serve its purpose they only do his will
[1:35:54] no one can persuade them different they
[1:35:57] have dust say the Lord or they keep
[1:35:58] still or they shut the mouth Hallelujah
[1:36:02] but when they open the mouth I will open
[1:36:04] thy mouth woo and put words in it oh
[1:36:07] give the Lord a shout prophesy to the
[1:36:10] Nations hallelujah praise God oh my let
[1:36:15] be
[1:36:16] seated remember Moses born for work here
[1:36:19] we go had to wait on God for the extra
[1:36:22] gift for the
[1:36:25] job he was born for it but he had to
[1:36:29] wait for something extra to fulfill it
[1:36:33] so he had to go back and wait for the
[1:36:35] time appointed by God a certain Pharaoh
[1:36:38] had to be on the throne so Moses can't
[1:36:40] move out of timing and the bride can't
[1:36:42] move out of timing glory to God we can't
[1:36:45] shut ourselves down they have to shut us
[1:36:47] down oh give the Lord some Praises glory
[1:36:50] to God hallelujah
[1:36:52] God never play Signs ahead of his word
[1:36:54] that's a scure God never play Signs
[1:36:56] ahead of his word they were added for
[1:36:58] proof of the word but the word is first
[1:37:01] pick me a cake first the true prophet of
[1:37:04] God will proclaim the word in the last
[1:37:05] days denomination will hit him but he
[1:37:07] will not pull any punches remember
[1:37:10] friends now
[1:37:13] watch Jesus said in the last days it
[1:37:15] will be in L's time his preaching will
[1:37:17] be like the spirit straight line of
[1:37:18] God's word because so much has been
[1:37:20] called God's truth many will
[1:37:21] misunderstand this true Messenger I
[1:37:23] wrote here prophecy because so much has
[1:37:26] been called God's truth by fakers many
[1:37:28] true ministers will misunderstand that
[1:37:31] messenger now remember Christian friends
[1:37:33] I'm a man I can make mistakes but God
[1:37:36] being God cannot make a mistake all the
[1:37:39] words written must be fulfilled praise
[1:37:43] God praise God praise God and let's wrap
[1:37:46] up here right now when the spirit Falls
[1:37:50] and there Comes A Move among the people
[1:37:52] them denomination Will Spring together
[1:37:54] as certain I'm standing in the pulpit
[1:37:56] and the Church of God will be outad and
[1:37:58] they'll make such a racket until they'll
[1:37:59] Confederate it put a boycot on anybody
[1:38:02] who do belong to them Rome will rule the
[1:38:04] world for one hour she will rule for a
[1:38:06] little peace not communism romanism will
[1:38:08] rule the world with the cooperation of
[1:38:10] protestantism in the nominal form of
[1:38:13] church which God has rejected oh my
[1:38:16] Hallelujah I'm closing I think after
[1:38:19] this revival swept the world in his last
[1:38:21] years I think the saints of God ought to
[1:38:22] be in the heavenlies everywhere and the
[1:38:25] power of God going into hospitals and
[1:38:28] everywhere else and great signs and
[1:38:30] wonders and miracles taking place but he
[1:38:33] can't get the people to stand still long
[1:38:35] enough if we saw theal seeds we will
[1:38:37] reap the Nal Harvest that's what we have
[1:38:40] done if you notice that word in Hebrew
[1:38:42] former and latter rain former means
[1:38:44] sewing rain and when the spirit Falls
[1:38:46] that if when the spirit Falls it falls
[1:38:49] on the just and the unjust so every
[1:38:52] seed's baiting for rain just and unjust
[1:38:55] Oh Glory to God give the Lord some
[1:38:57] Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:01] he said watch the Baptist took a million
[1:39:02] more and whatnot he said what have we
[1:39:04] done this is the
[1:39:06] closing he said we have added members
[1:39:08] got better churches bigger membership
[1:39:11] what we need is quality not quantity
[1:39:14] that's the trouble he's hunting for the
[1:39:16] pride today Elia had a awful time
[1:39:19] finding quality and then to get her
[1:39:22] ready to go to the next thing after he
[1:39:25] found it so you to find quality first
[1:39:28] and then get quality ready woo that is
[1:39:31] Trouble boy Pastor have it
[1:39:33] hard cuz all kind of characters is land
[1:39:36] in the
[1:39:37] church my
[1:39:39] Lord oh praise
[1:39:42] God I'm closing could be to play
[1:39:44] something I want to go back to the very
[1:39:47] first thing that I I hit on before a
[1:39:50] word it's a thought and a thought has to
[1:39:54] be created all right so God thoughts
[1:39:58] become creation when it is spoke by a
[1:40:00] word that is when he presents to you as
[1:40:03] a thought his thoughts is is revealed to
[1:40:06] you it's still a thought until you speak
[1:40:08] it so you understand why Jesus said
[1:40:11] Lazarus come
[1:40:12] forth he knew by vision lus would raise
[1:40:17] he didn't just walk and stand up and and
[1:40:18] stop all right I'm waiting for him to
[1:40:20] come for
[1:40:22] he knew he told his disciples I gowake
[1:40:24] him he sleeping he tell him he's dead he
[1:40:29] knew in advance he said I'm glad I'm not
[1:40:32] there now for your sakes I knew he knew
[1:40:35] and when he got there everything if Lord
[1:40:39] if you have not been here my brother had
[1:40:40] not died but even now Hallelujah he that
[1:40:43] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:40:45] Char live and where have you laid him
[1:40:48] you already show it brother George it's
[1:40:50] already done done but look at the motion
[1:40:52] to get it done where have you laid
[1:40:55] him Ru away the stone Lazarus come forth
[1:41:01] and they come forth the vision is now
[1:41:03] complete but Jesus see it finished way
[1:41:07] back days before that so friends this
[1:41:10] raptor is finished the Millennium
