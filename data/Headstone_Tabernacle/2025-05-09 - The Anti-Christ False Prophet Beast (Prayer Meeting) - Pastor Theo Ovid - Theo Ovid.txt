May they be set free by your word in Jesus I ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you and welcome tonight. And it's a bless blessing and a privilege to be back home and um I was on another mission and um you hear about it but God has been good and God is is moving and um you know I know by now all of you would have heard by now that I've elected a pope out of America as brother Brandon prophesied and I was thinking 1977 I came to the message 1975 and I was 17 years old. 17 years old. In 1977 there was a a December meeting I think it was and October convention and different ministers were preaching and showing and they were all talking about um the millennium. They all talking about going home and the rapture and whatnot. And I that time would be about 19 years old. And having read a ton of messages, all that I could have found at that time and seen all the prophecies, I sat there watching these uh ministers say their stuff about leaving and going and rapture. And I'm thinking to myself, what about all these prophecies? What about all these things in the word? And somehow I just couldn't swallow their talk, their millennium talk, whatever they was peding at that time. It just wasn't cutting it because I saw so much valid prophecies that was outstanding that had to be fulfilled. This here the port of America was one of them. And on that and and at that time the prophecies was astonishing like how could it be possible? There were many things the prophet said and you wonder how could it be. But as the years roll by, you begin to see more and more how it is unfolding. And I want to say tonight that this is a demonstration that God is not operating by our feelings, by our emotions, by any man's thought and ideas as how it's supposed to be and when it's supposed to be. But God have a clock. God have a timing he's working with. Tonight I want to share some things with you. I may take more time than usual, but I feel that I' I'd like to do this and trust that it will edify and help you in your Christian walk. We're living in treacherous times and we have to be guided by the word. That is our guide. That is the light. Not feelings, not dreams, not emotions, but by the word. So tonight, if you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to Revelation chapter 13. We want to read the whole chapter. Revelation 13 verse one and it reads, "And I stood upon the sun of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads, 10 horns upon his horns, 10 crowns upon his heads, the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw like a leopard, his feet was the feet of a bear, his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority." Note who gave him this power, the dragon. Verse three, and I saw one of the heads as it were wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshiped the dragon, which give power unto the beast? And they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? And it was given unto him a mouth speaking greetings and blasphemies. And power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blasphe his name, his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. It was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Note that it says what going to happen. They shall worship him and a little sliver except those whose names uh whose names are not written in the book of life will be sound from the world. So everybody else whose name I've written will worship that beast. Verse nine, if any man had an ear, let him hear. He that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity. He that killth with a sword must be killed with a sword. Here is the patience of the and the fate of the saints. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb and he spake like as a dragon. And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him, and caused the earth, and them that dwelt therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly womb was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire cometh from heaven on the earth, and the sight of men. And he deceiveth them to dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by the sword and did live. And he had power, here we go, to give life unto the image of the beast, and that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he caused all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bound, to receive a mark in their right hand. That is what you do about it. And in your foreheads, the revelation. Verse 17. That no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that had understanding come the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man and his number is 600 three score six. You know it's 666. So I wrote this here. I want you to understand that God is not operating by men's ideas, thoughts, or feelings. Whatever you think or feel does not affect what God promised to do or the fulfillment of his word. Prophecies are in motion tonight. So get your feelings and emotions out of it and hear the word of the Lord. So I've got a title of what I want to share with you tonight. title is the antichrist false prophet beast. That's the title. The antichrist false prophet beast. And I'll read the quote of the prophecy, brother Brandham. And this strange that this prophecy is locked up in a message called the acts of the holy spirit preached in 19th of December 1954. And he said, "I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of Churches goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over deer according to prophecy, then they will form an image like unto the beast." And I tell you, the true church of God will be drove together. And he's detailing what he calling the true church, the real true believers out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Nazarine, holiness. That was his reference point at this time. At this time we talking about interpretation and other message tabernacles and churches and whatever whatever thing they are in cuz they have come to this now where they are they own Baptist and Presbyterian their own spirit and stuff. He said they will go together and be cemented by the love of God that will make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. So he is clearly not talking about church or tabernacles or whatever. He is clearly talking about by one spirit we are baptized into this body. This is an international body the body of the lord Jesus Christ all the believers. Then he said and the agnostics and shallow minded shall be cast to one side. They will go right on in the confessional churches. So friends, I think that this is a a marker point, a junction point, a specific point in prophecy. And we know we have a genuine 20th century Malachi 4 prophet that God spoke through this man, this brother, this prophet William Marian Brown. In the seed of the Antichrist, he said these words. The first thing you know, the time will come when God will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out the kingdom. So what you're seeing here now has nothing to do again with church, the tabernacles, who's the pastor and all and all the drama behind the church scene. This have to do with the kingdom. Then in the 10th version, he said this. He said, "Notice now there are two spirits working almost right down here. One is the denomination and the other one is the Holy Ghost." And denomination is where the people are anchored to the church. They're not anchored by revelation or inspiration. They anchor to their church or to their tabernacle. The loyal faithful. These are the words that come out. They have nothing to do with the leading of the Holy Spirit. So hear what he's saying. No, there are two spirits working down here. One is the nomination, the other one is the Holy Ghost. And Jesus said they will be so close that they will deceive the very elected if it was possible. These two spirits are marking their people for future judgment. I want you to get that. The spirits are marking their people for future judgment. In other words, tonight you could be marked by the word to be sealed or marked to be judged by the judgments of God. Now, the same God that spoke about taking the pope out of America spoke this in the mark of the beast. There's that red dragon, the devil. Where's his seat at? Not in Russia. in Rome. The devil give him his seat and his authority, not Russia. He says, "Remember, I say this as God's prophet. The Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican city and destroy it in one hour. Thus sayeth the Lord." I want to read it again. the Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican city and destroy it in one hour. Thus sayeth the Lord. Now remember before it come back to Russia it was the Soviet Union to get to Russia. what the prophecy is identifying the Soviet Union itself had to be broken up the way it was that it could become back to this Russia because Russia is where the prophecy is at and the Bible said that God took them cruelhearted men and put them in his hands and they were instrument in his hands to fulfill his will and to bring her back to exactly what she come to that's the word exactly So listen, talking about the pillar of fire, the pillar of fire is to lead us to the millennium where he will return to his people. And listen from the third exodus, the pillar of fire and he return to his people in that great millennium after this exodus. We are in a exodus and leaving and turning the tapes off in a moment. Oh my friends, my brothers, both present that will hear the tapes as your brother and citizen of the kingdom of God, come out in this Exodus, for all that is left behind will bear the mark of the beast. Come out of Babylon. Come out of this confusion. Come out of these systems. He said now the pillar of fire in the same form he was back there bringing the first exodus bringing the second exodus he is with the third exodus the first exodus what did he do he brought them from a natural land to a natural land from Egypt to Palestine the second exodus he brought them from a spir from from a from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost and now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the etal eternal land of the millennium and the great hereafter. The same pillar of fire, by the same anointed system, the same God doing the same things by the same word. Come out. Come out of this chaos. Come to the living God. Come to the word. And the word was made flesh and dwell among us. Come out and serve the living God. Question. What is the mark of the beast? Abraham said you can't sit neutral. be someoneish of unity. The Bible said in the last day, every man that wasn't sealed with the Holy Ghost would have the mark of the beast. Note, it is specific. It is to the individual. It doesn't say this church is right and this church is wrong. That is foolishness. That is what ministers have pedled for years. More right and more revelation. When the tire hits the road, this is what it is about. He says this here, you can't sit neutral. The Bible said in this day, every man that wasn't sealed with the Holy Ghost would have the mark of the beast. What is the mark of the beast? Unbelief. And just uh recently, Brother Clarence and I were fellowshipping, talking, and he was talking about he's now beginning to see people really don't believe the message. They're in the message. And I was telling him that when the prophet talk about three kind of believers, the unbeliever one blew my mind because he wasn't talking about it like unbelievers outside. He was talking about unbelievers on the inside. And I begin to tell Clarence that I have seen where I recognize ministers, people don't believe what the prophet said. They claim to believe the message. They believe some past. They're doing like if it's Buffy style, you pick what you want, you eat back what you don't want and so on. But the reality is it come like if you talk to a Pentecostal and they say 4 they don't want that but that's in the Bible behind Elijah the prophet they don't want that part today you could show people things in the word and they don't want that part they want what they want you see so the mark of the beast is what unbelief shai the prophet says grieving of the holy spirit whereby you are sealed unto their redemption how many knows that God word sayeth seal field of God is the Holy Ghost. Now what is the mark of the beast is to reject the Holy Ghost. Mark of apostasy. So when people looking for mark in the head like a tattoo or mark on their hand, here it is divine revelation. The mark of the beast is to reject the Holy Ghost from 10 virgins. Oh, I love him, don't you? What is the seal of God? Holy Ghost. What is the mark of the beast? Reject it. And they going to come a message that going to seal people in or seal them out. Mark of the beast. Brother says in says here shall be light in the evening time. That's right. While the evening lights are shining, why don't you come to it? Don't set dead. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be sealed into the kingdom. What is the mark of the beast? to reject the Holy Ghost, the borderline. Now, this is where he went deeper. And then he said these words after he once come to the knowledge of the truth. For it is impossible for those which were once enlightened. See, coming up to the knowledge of the truth and seeing they see the truth, they see the knowledge of it. Have the knowledge of the truth and then turn away. There remainth no more sacrifice for sin. If this doesn't identify what in the message don't know what it is but this is where saints it's not a matter of you say you are believer and you believe you have to receive. Okay let's go. All right so let me hear a bit expression. No but is talking about the antichrist spirit and John said little children the spirit of the antichrist is already working in the children of the disobedience. Now remember where the church fell from. That is why I have a real strong attitude and spirit against this nicolatan thing against message pope, archbishops, men who want to control ministers, men who want to control churches, men who hates or despise the sub biblical church. I come against that very very strong because the early church, this original church where God sent a messenger to turn us back to the faith of the fathers. These guys were guided by the Holy Ghost. The acts of the apostles or the book of acts was really the acts of the holy ghost through these men. There were no leader. There was no archbishop. Peter led to go so by calling his house. Andrew going this way, the deacon going this way. They were led by the spirit of God and God was glorified in that early church. That church was the foundation. That church was the original. And there came a falling away where men are finding it's too noisy. It's too rowdy. It's too holy ghosty and afterwards now things started creeping rich people started coming in and then the worship and the atmosphere cool down and then afterwards now very slow spirit move and then they start to put the anointing on the man the man be in the pulpit the preacher man and they leave and take the glory from the people put it on a man and of course that man became a bishop then archbishop then right onto pope so then they end up with a holy man instead of the holy god amongst the people Now what God really wants, God want to be among his people. The five for ministry is not there to be glorified and be lift up on some pedestal. What the file for ministry is for is what the Bible said it's for for the perfection of the saints. In other words, God so love you his people that he sending ministries to help, to edify, to strengthen, to build you up and so on like that until you get the measure. When you come into the measure which is your measure of the perfect man, there's no need for that ministry anymore. In that sense, the ministry have a purpose. The ministry have a time on it. The ministry have an objective and a purpose behind it because God gives gifts to men and every gift have its attributes and what it's supposed to do in honing us in preparing us. So then he says this here now. So therefore all of this is what the church fell from from the glory among the people from the Holy Ghost and then now end up on a man right a pope and that is where the old fall from white horse red horse black horse all right so watch he says now watch then it become a scene in the next church age next church age was a doctrine and the next church age was crown now he was called what the antichrist spirit why because he's against the word so anything against The word is a spirit and it's antichrist spirit. It's against the word. He promised in the last days. All right, let me see here that he going to re bring the the fate of the children back to the faith of fathers. That's what he's going to restore. Now, first is the antichrist spirit only in spirit. Then he becomes an antichrist. And that spirit took a man and taught the same thing that the antichrist spirit was doing. Then he becomes a false prophet to the antichrist spirit. Finally, he becomes a beast. Now watch. Satan, Antichrist, spirit, spirit, incarnate, false prophet. Then come the beast. Now I know some will be repetit I'll be repeating it, but bear with us tonight. Now watch. Now when not a demon was in that antichrist but when Satan himself is kicked out he comes down and takes over the place where the demon was. Then the devil is incarnate in a man and Christ was the incarnate God. God incarnate in flesh and Judas was the son of predition as Jesus was the son of God incarnate. Judas was the incarnate devil. Now Satan is going to incarnate himself from antichrist to false prophet and in the last days of the Jew is the antichrist spirit in the early church. The dark ages he becomes false prophet for and see with a cup of iniquity. But in the age after the church goes home. So he's specifying that the church going to leave the bride going to be raptured the church going to go home. He becomes a beast. It becomes the devil incarnate the red dragon himself. Can't you see what I mean? He is incarnate in his people then. So Satan have his people and God have his people. Now watch. He talking about Satan has got his people bound by his power. The false prophet, this is how powerful this is. The false prophet has prophesied them right into it. Give them over to a strong delusion to believe a lie. and be damned by it. Denying the word with a form of godliness. This is church member. This is second Timothy. This is it right here. And denying the word with a form of godliness. They believe this part and that part by denying the power thereof. God works his place in trinity, justification, sanification, and then incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There's no way we could get away from it. You there's no way we could talk about Mary be it done unto me according to your word. No justification, sanctification, and the baptism of Holy Ghost. As I told some brother, the same Mary that say be it done unto me according to thy word have to go up in the upper room. So take that Mary and send her straight into the upper room to get the Holy Ghost. So the devil is just type after Christ. So when Jesus here we go incarnates himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in this person. So these virtues which is the virtue of Jesus Christ not human temperance not human patience not natural godliness and natural this and natural that no the patience of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ all of Jesus Christ that will be in the bride. The Holy Ghost that wrote the word said, "If a man has my spirit in him, he will do my works. The same works I do shall do also." Are we going? So then watch. He sanctifies and cleans him so he could stand before God. When Satan become incarnate into his church if there be a devil and they are the ones that are murdering and killing because Satan is a killer in the first place and a liar. Okay, we almost found a stretch here. Now remember the antichrist and beast is the self-same spirit self spirit. There's a trinity. Three stages of the devil power. First stage antichrist. Second stage false prophet. Third stage beast. Notice nicolatan the antichrist teaching started Paul against the word. Then the pope was the prophet to the false word. That made him a false prophet. The third stage is a beast, a man. Here we go. Listen carefully. That is crowned in the last days with every power that pagan Rome ever had because the sevenheaded beast dragon that was cast out of heaven comes incarnate in the false prophet. Here he is. He had seven crowns. He was cast out and thrown in the earth. And I know you're thinking about cast out battle war in heaven, but you will see where the prophet is drawing this from. What are we saying? I'm continuing. Who is this rider? This horse rider jump from white horse to black horse to red horse, black horse, pale horse. Who is this rider? This horse rider. You know what it is? It is Satan's Superman. Notice this rider is nothing but Satan's Superman, a incarnate devil. He's a educated genius. The whole world wanted a Superman. They're going to get it. Just wait till the literature goes up and Satan cast out. He'll be incarnate. That's right. They want somebody who can really do the job. He will do it. This is Satan Superman with education, with wisdom, with church theology, of his own word, of his own making. And he rises white the nominational horse to deceive the people. And he will conquer every religion of the world because they are all going into the confederation of churches and the whole confession of churches who already got their buildings built, everything right in line. There ain't one thing left. Every denomination stuck right into it. the confederation of churches. The white horse rider has been in the land all the time. He will change from antichrist to become a false prophet. And then later when the devil is cast out, he is incarnate then with the devil. Three stages. He's a devil to begin with. The spirit of the devil then becomes a false prophet teacher, false doctrine. Next thing he comes, the very devil incarnate himself. And at the same time that this devil falls out of heaven and becomes incarnate in a man, the Holy Spirit goes up and comes down incarnate. Amen. Amen. Oh my, is it something? We find out this mystery here in the church and state, the fourth stage of his ministry. He's called the beast. Revelation 12:13, Satan being kicked out from heaven. And this is what he said here. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was made flesh. Christ dwell among us. Now he is against the word. So he be antichrist but a spirit cannot be crowned and that's the reason he didn't have a crown. So now so you see you see a spirit cannot be crowned. So therefore it needs a body. So the antichrist spirit becomes incarnate into a man and that man changes from one thing to another from an antichrist spirit to a false prophet and then the beast comes into him just exactly like the church grows. The church grows. So the church comes through justification, sanctification and the baptis of the Holy Ghost as Christ being in the people. this false prophet, this antichrist, this beast. He is Satan's representative on the earth. He is now head of the kingdoms of the world. The very same kingdoms that he offered to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4. Satan now becomes full king. And this happened, he's a false prophet now. He will become a beast after a while when he breaks his covenant with the Jews. Notice now these things are very important is detailed. He will be given a heart of a beast at that time. Satan will incarnate himself because the church is going up. Satan is cast out. And then this is the bomb here. He done all his accusing is done. But we give the Lord some praises. Satan is the accused of the brethren. And because he's taken up his case to God about the saints on the earth, he accusing them day and night before God. So right now he is in a realm pointing he did this, he did this, he did this. And our lawyer Jesus Christ is saying not guilty, not guilty. I died for them. I drop their charges. My blood. My blood. My blood. That's what going on Saturday. But some point in time when the bride is taken up, he has no more accusition to bring. So then he comes down on the earth because he have no place else to go. Really, he comes down on the earth. He have his superman ready to step into. God having a people ready to step into. Note that the image unto the beast have to get life. What did Bam reveal? The image, the statue of a perfect man, that image, that word is now in a bride. That image have to come to life. The prophet said they were in the upper room, dry seeds, seizes out life, and all of a sudden the water break, the Holy Ghost poured out and then the seeds begin to stretch and grow. This is what the devil is fighting that the Holy Ghost is not as real. They want to make the Holy Ghost everything different than what they had in their Pentecost. But I am saying tonight the same Holy Ghost that they receive on Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost we have to receive. Not a new Holy Ghost, not a modern Holy Ghost, no other kind of ghost, the same Holy Ghost. Because this is the message to turn our hearts back to what they had, which is the faith of the father. Because when they come out of that upper room, they had upon them the anointing of the land Shabba Judah. This pope, you notice the name he take, Pope Leo. That imposter impersonator. That Leo is the lion that is impersonating the coming of the Lord as Jesus Christ. He take on a certain name. And this Leo guy, I checked it out. Very strong in doctrine, very courageous, very disciplined. He's a certain type of mind. These guys doesn't take up names by chance. It's not by chance he take up the name Leo because the lion coming back. that land anointing will be upon a bride. Oh my, there'll be one more, right? Don't you h bless God tonight for his word and for sending us a prophet with the true teachings of the word. So let me just finish wrap up here now. Oh, praise God. So that that is what it is about friends. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So I want to share with you. You cannot in your human mind try to figure out God's plan and program. We have to line up. We can't expect God to feel sorry for us. We have to try to meet up with God's requirement. We have who he call the fact that you are called you know he for you. Well okay who he call you justified. There's a empty slot there and that starts the sanctified part. The cleaning up part the work part the labor part. The part that we do tonight in crying out and talking to the Lord and waiting upon God. There's a lethargy and a sluggish and a lazy spirit that's sweeping over the message over the years that people getting, you know, and that is where the fights coming now. The law delay is coming and this man fighting this one, this church fighting this one, this group fighting this one. I was telling them in a couple of services that the devil is in the church as the devil in the church. There's no press to come down because the devil sit back, relax, rock in his rocking chair. Let him fight it out. He is in the church. If we get the devil kicked out by forgiveness, by brotherly kindness, by the honey, if we get him out, then he have no choice but to send forces from outside to squeeze us. But as long as their internal foolishness, the devil will just sit down and laugh. And that is why the prophet is shame that things are going to happen to drive the true believers together. Things are going to happen. And this is what you see in here. When they take the pope out of America, certain things will start to happen. People will begin to realize it's not their church. It's not their tabernacle and they love the pastor so much and all that drama is whether or not you are sealed into the kingdom. And that is where the prayer is tonight to get into the church triumphant to get in the savior's bride. We have been pulled too long by this man and that man this teaching and that teaching and who are revelation and this is the word for the bride and all kind of drama and whatnot. The question is is are you in the church triumphant? Are you in the savior's bride? Come and be baptized into the body and forever more alive. This is what is about bringing each individual to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Each one of us have to be confronted with this baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's an experience. It's not an imagination reading a book. It easier to read a book than to seek the Holy Ghost. It easier to read a book or listen to a tape and to seek God. We are called to seek God. There's none that seeketh after him. But we are called to seek after God. What going to happen in the last days? The heart of many will wax cold. What will happen in the last days? Prophecies. Your love will only be among the elect. These are things going to happen in the last days. Men will be uh falling away, falling away in the church, a fallen away in spirit. People know it's right and they have like no power. But God help us tonight. Right now we in the midst of prophecy. And friends, if this prophecy we from 1977 to now is about 48 years, 48 years. Well, Kangly will know it. All the older ones, my parents, all the way back people will know these prophecies from way back then. It take 48 years to come to this truth. This guy 69 years old. He's quite young. He could run the next 20 years. Normal, normal, normal. All right. But what I'm saying is this. We are at the door. We are at the door and it's not like we have to look outside for signs. We have to look to what God is doing among us. What God doing with you, what God doing in your life and your heart. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight for the truth of your word that you did send this evening messenger Lord to shine light into our path. And what make this Bible such a glorious book is not a just a book about behavior and attitude and life and godliness. It's a book of prophecy. And Lord, it's really thrilling to see these words come alive. To know 1954 by your spirit you spoke that they will take a pope out of America and what will happen behind that. And here we are living in those days. As I often time share with the church according to Revelation 10, oh God 11, thou must prophesy again. And the only reason we could prophesy is because it's not yet fulfilled. But we could say today that this prophecy, this day, the scripture is fulfilled. This prophecy is fulfilled. Father, what about a prophecy for the bride? Father, what about a prophecy for this bride's revival? You said it will take those seven thunders. You said he will send it. You said he would because he promised it. You said if the people will forget their creeds and dogmas and plead the promises, it will become effective to them. Father, tonight we come to plea your promises. Send that revival. Send a revival that will stir our hearts and turn our hearts. Lord, your prophet taught us. Don't let that enthusiasm die. Don't let it go down. Don't get dry up. Lord, your prophet taught us that we should be like skins, new skins, skins with oil in it. That we could become flexible. When the oil leave the skin, the believer get hard, dry, nothing moving, no revelation, no inspiration, no oil. Oh God, tonight bring that oil back. brain. Give me oil in my lamp to keep me burning. Oh God, set us on fire and dip us in oil. That that oil, that fire will flow. That oil can flow and keep us burning. Lord, burning to it coming, Lord. We see things are being positioned. Russia right now is celebrating. Oh, have their big celebration there. Maybe celebration of the world war. Father, and and there are kings that are dear, oh God. Things are setting. The battle is still ongoing in Ukraine. Lord, India and Pakistan, they have start up some thing going there is the world is going in a certain gear. Help us as a church. Help us as a people. Help us as individuals. Oh God, my friend and brother in Tamu, India. Father, you tell me that the oh God, the drone, they come so close to his home and to pray for him. Father, pray for them in Tamu. Lord Jesus, that your Holy Spirit will keep and preserve him, Father, and touch his life, his family, and keep them and preserve them in the name of Jesus. And all those believers who might be under fire or close to where this this drama is taking place. May you be with them in a special way in the name of Jesus Christ. Father God, look over your people tonight. Look over the elders, the ministers, look over your look over each heart here tonight. those that are sick, those that are struggling, those that are under depression, frustration, those that don't understand, those that are just far away and and and weak, Lord God, weak in faith. Lord, you promise a third pull to help those that are weak in that way. Father God, give us great faith tonight as we call upon your name. Oh God, may the word be inspiring to us. May we see that brotherly kind is not a light thing. It's not a light thing. It's a serious thing that we could drop ours and forgive and let go. There are people have a tough time letting go. What about the gossipers? Lord, the people that gossip and run their mouths. Oh Jesus, I won't you just shut their mouths. Would they would they come and get rid of that gossiping spirit that they will think twice who they talk to and tell them what. Father God, you said if you want to have the spirit around you say something nice, say something good, say something loyal, say something true, not negative, not bad, not trying to bring somebody down or make other people see them negatively. Oh God, that's just plain wrong. Trying to pull down someone, trying to point others in a way that will see them in a negative light. Father, that's not what we are called to do. We are called to see through the blood. We are called to see an opportunity that God could change and reform and transform a person. Oh God, help us tonight that instead of talking about that we could pray about someone instead of pulling down someone, we could pray that God bless them and help them and lift them up. Oh God, we see people struggling with their laziness, with their slothfulness, with their unbelief. But Father, I pray for a mighty deliverance. As a pastor, I've preached over the years, seen all kind of conditions in the church. But Lord, I still believe for them. I still believe that you will do a work for them. Oh, God, won't you start that work tonight? Would you do it tonight? Revive the church. Revive individuals. Revive hearts and lives. May they understand this message is real. This message is alive. You have not forsaken us. You have not give up on us, but you still believe that we will come true. Father, that is why you let the prophet prophesy. I believe the bride is called. I believe the bride is sealed into the kingdom. She has got the mechanics written in the dynamics. And the dynamics is the Holy Ghost. Oh God, send out that Holy Ghost. Men try to mistrify it. Men try to teach it. Men try to say all kind of thing about it and and push it to the side like that cornerstone that was once rejected, but the stone the build refused that became the headstone of the corner. Father, won't you come and cap the pyramid of our lives? Lord, when the prophet talked about that, nobody talk knew what he was talking about. But now we know that our lives have to be capped. Cat by love, even divine love. That is why you took him into the restaurant. That is why you took him from condemning a woman to showing him that the same blood for him was from that woman he was condemning and she was restored. Oh God, help us. Help us to come out of that. Help us to come out all this legalistic nonsense. Help us to come out all this condemn and condemning and who is this and who is that. Help us to come completely out of that and to see your blood. Oh God, the world is in darkness. It's gross darkness over the earth and over the people, over this message. All kind of foolishness being preached and being taught. All kind of contrary, delusional lies being pedled by spirits. But God, you promise when the enemy come like a flood, the spirit of God raise a standard. Oh God, tonight raise a standard. Raise a standard in the hearts and minds of your children. Raise a standard in their homes. Lord, shake the brothers. Shake the fathers. Shake, oh God, them. Shake them back into order, oh God, the order of spirit. Bring back the homes back in order. Grant it Lord. Bless the sisters. Bless the wives. Bless the mothers. Be with them, Father. And be with a time that we have in this time of prayer. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you as you only get on in prayer. I trust them that this would have be some help to you in some way that the Holy Spirit will be with us. Amen. So, God bless you. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's worship. Just give God some praises before we start in prayer. Just give God some praise right where you are. Oh, thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Praise be to Jesus. Praise his name. Praise his wonderful name. Thank you Lord. Let we get up in prayer. Thank you Lord.

May the anointing, oh God, rock the church. May the power of God come among your people, Father. May they be inspired, Lord. May it be inspired from you. Oh, the church need revelation. How we need revelation and revelation is prevailing power. Revelation is a hearing from heaven. Oh God, may we hear from heaven, father. May we hear your spirit voice. The spirit speak it expressly. May we hear a spirit voice. He have ear. Let him hear what the spirit is saying. Oh God, speak to us and draw us nearer to you, Father. Oh God, we want a revival. I want a revival. Oh God, I want a quickening. I want awakening, Father. I want to be drawn closer to you, Father. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for your people. Thank you for your children, your sons and your daughters. Father, may they know, may they get by revelation that they are justified. May they get by revelation that your blood speak on their behalf. Father, in their weakness, your blood speaks, oh God, in their weakness, in their struggles, your blood still speak, oh God, the accuser is accusing, but your blood speaks. Let your blood speak tonight, Father, and quicken us to your word. May or may we receive your spirit, Lord. Your blood word that becomes spirit, Father. Grant it, God. as we look away to you, Father. I commit this service this coming Sunday into your hands. All will be done maybe for your honor and glory. I ask in Jesus name. Amen. God bless the saints. Thanks again for being here tonight. Uh the presence of God is here and and we believe that God is merciful to us. Just remember the scripture we read Revelation 13 to America. So here it is. You have an American pope. The beast system is in effect. And here it is the image of the beast where I'm talking about the devil coming down under the opices of the United Nations to enforce laws. So everything is set. The drama is now set for the bride. She has to get her position in the word. So may God bless you. Have a great evening and see you on Sunday. God be with you. Bye.
