the Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you touch it feels good to be in the house of the Lord tonight requests that will reach the scripture then thereafter we'll take the comfort of our seats we'll get acquainted and go into the message so when we read the scripture together my accent my tour nation will be clear will be understood by those who are strange to me so let's just read our Bibles god bless you you are welcome tonight if you have your Bibles please stand with me to the book of John we're going to read from few places if you don't mind we'll start from the book of John chapter 12 John since John chapter 12 I would like to read from the 28 verse down to 24 John 12 22 24 then we shall also read from the book of Matthew chapter 27 to 28 somewhere there if you are there say hey man and there we are certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philippi which was of Bethsaida of Galilee and desired him saying sir we will see Jesus Philip common tantalate and row and again hundra and Philip tell Jesus to come that is son of man should be I set a corn of wheat fall into the ground and but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit the wake on of weed econ can ever multiply itself it's by dying I will come back to that god bless you Matthew chapter 27 this might be a very hot text now in Matthew 27 for the kind of the theme of our program but you bear with me as we see we are it matches Matthew 27 I'd like to take from the 60 second verse 62 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days our eyes again I'm sure you know they are referring to command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples came by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last arrow shall be worse than the first Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch I will continue to 28 the first six verses in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and such upon it he didn't just roll it away is such his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers who were meant to be on guard with the seal with all the cameras did shake and became as me to come to Trinidad to be of service trusting to God that song we along the line we can be of a blessing and I very much appreciate the support of my dear friend and brother Isaac it did all he could to get me down here without frustration so maybe not bless you sir and in absentia I want to appreciate past Oulu Emoto ample for only support for me to be done here he hasn't come yet boy in this great brother-in-law van kindness it was about it's underway so I pretty low blessing very much and I appreciate all the servants of the Lord pastors both doors that will speak and those that were supports the speakers I appreciate every one of you for your grace for your humility for your support for your kindness and for your generosity to come up a part of these meetings I pray the Lord bless every one of you appreciate the entire church for coming like I've always said when a preacher comes to town it is not our intention to come and preach to chairs and benches the gospel is not meant for them the gospel is meant for human beings so it's always a blessing and an encouragement to a preacher when the Lord give us people to speak to so we will never take your kindness that gesture for granted so we trust to the Lord that somewhere somehow we'll be of a blessing to you so thank you for coming tonight thank you for coming in the morning I'm taking an advance for how the community we do throughout these meetings may God bless you I bring greetings from Nigeria all the saints the pastors and everyone and my own past oh and all the Brethren knew of my comment told me to give you a very kind regards to all the sins here and my wife and children also requested that I greet every one of you everyone is doing fine and I'm sure they will be glad to know that the believers are doing where he made a lot less young [Applause] and I sincerely know that all of you appreciated the service this morning the yield increased to show to us that lessons and not being protected there was something and when Pastor crimp read in the morning it said we are unprotected here protected and I find our protection to be that perfect law if we can be yielding and yielding and yielding it will be taking us from glory to glory but that was something to my heart this morning and I pretty low bless you sir bless the family the ministry and the flock of God Park and England amen god bless you all if I do not if I do not greet anyone I shall have greeted forgive me it is not out of rudeness it's just because this is so much I can do right now god bless you so if the Lord will be our help tonight which I trust a will I want to speak on the subjects that I called in this season of the harvest like pastor Chandler said this morning that the harvest time is a very broad subject and it can be approached from several many angles because there are a lot of things that go into the harvest what I'm trusting to God that you know the scripture says the body of Christ is compacted together by what every joint supply so if the two of us tonight are not able to give adequate supply don't worry there are still five more supplies coming and I'm sure they will be able to fill in you wouldn't miss anything you watch to receive through these meetings so be less the short of that may I start even this other subject by saying that all your efforts to come and everything that you put in to come is like seed sowing that's what the Prophet said brother Brahma wants to preach in a place in Canada very remote many years ago and there was telling the church before he went is a see those brethren they and their remote parts and they do not have much so for them to make it to the meetings because of the value they attach to those meetings some of them will have to sell their asses there are cut rules and so forth some of them will have to each eye some of them will have to combine transportation with element of walking in order to get to the meetings and the prophet tour discharge is that you see that is how to get much out of it because what they do goes with one form of sacrifice or the other those that sow in tears most certainly reap in joy so it's that they are putting in so much because of the value they attach to that program and is that that is the reason they usually get so so much so I want to tell you for all the sacrifices you have made you will get so so much the harvest will begin with you your comfort shall be full by the time that meetings are over you will count your blessings and it will surprise you what the Lord has done just open your hearts to receive the blessings of God if you have a spiritual niche the law will may teach you say why because you have son you've got to read if you have a physical needs the law will meet it car valley takes care both way brother brown said if you can save your soul it can also heal your body it can meet your needs it can fight your battles so let loose in his presence and I'm sure there'll be a lot of [Applause] you love him tonight I was thinking of the men that brother Bram called John cherish just bear with me this is how I feel like going and when the Prophet met this man it was such a poor man it wasn't only poor life was so unfair to him it was married but he had no child so everything to the negative was the portion of this brother but brother Bram meets some a statement that was very remarkably by John cherish is that when this man eats the word it believed everything and the power of the fridge in the world began to propel him John Charlie was no longer himself then you know it was living like in the true room house that he has used all his entire life savings and walking to acquire but then because of the value attached to the gospel a man of God came into the town to settle down and spread the gospel a fairlead of the Lord this will sound unusual to many of us it will sound like a man out of his mind people take out of what they have but John chariot was gonna take out of nothing she was gonna be like that with a woman she dropped all our two minds that's all she had and Jesus said she went for much more wattage than those who brought millions it's because there are millions came out of their billions is that what this one came out of nothing it is 2-2 it left her with zero but because of the value she attached beauty of open things a channel Oh glory to God John carats left his house and brother Branson is got a very godly wife who made life easy for him they left the house completely not as a loan or as a range they ended it completely as a gift to the men of God without a plan for where they we pass the night the man of God struggle to refuse it but John said the Lord told me to do this so John stood right there and he had to I by net squatted somewhere for the night and when a woman who never knew God she wasn't a Christian when she saw them it said I was going on here it said it was happy to declare testimony the Lord told me to do this and I've done so what is left for you John it said nothing it said okay you know what I will give you my garage to stay if you will pay the wages of dressing my cutting so it's going to cultivate dress and make the garden okay but the payment it will receive for dressing the garden will be the garage is given to leave John gladly accepted it and the John will dress the garden and in the evening you know and after doing that it will go and look for something to do in the evening it will sit somewhere by the compound of the house and start reading his Bible then this woman begins to pay attention to John what was in that book that makes this man so loved and so interested every time without John Charlie's saying one word his life began to preach and the woman you know peeped to see what book he was reading and it turned out to be a Bible and the woman went to the shop to buy a save a Bible and start reading also I want to know what was John's interest what was attracting John in that book and she started reading Bible and by the time she started reading Bible the lot began to minister to her and that opened up a channel for this woman to hear from God and the same God who spoke to John spoke to her and and is that God give John $10,000 and this woman who has never been to church never hesitated she rots the tech and came to John is a God who told you to leave your house told me to give you two alone you $10,000 John said tour to watch is that I don't know you go ask him and John went and asked the Lord because he hasn't seen such a money before together and the Lord said to him okay you start a building business a property selling business go look for a property you sell in a urinal vetted salad and like that and this brothers started that and the breath of God began to come upon it and the breath of God began to come upon it and the orphan started expanding started expanding and it has it expanded so much until when the Prophet was telling the story of this brother is a right now John chariot as 1500 actors not a cash actors and is employing more than 15,000 Mexicans to work on their farm and hardly a paid four million dollars to the cost of the gospel and is that right now right now brother John has God's home a lot of children until is beginning to has got to slow down is that as I'm talking to you now the reason John couldn't be in this mission is because the wife has just put to bed [Music] that was a woman who was bearish and brother brand middleman he said see what 15 years see what difference 15 years a in the life of that man he said because that man switched to the Lord and is ripping bunch of alarbus so whatever you are dream for the Lord don't slack don't be discouraged I'm declaring harvest because there shall be an harvest amen nobody plant one seed and reap just one seat a first time is always an interesting time plans to be sure harvest [Music] [Applause] you love him tonight okay [Applause] I just thought I should sense that maybe it's going to help somebody maybe it's going to encourage somebody okay let's make that our background and look at the great husband man himself the Lord Jesus of the Gentiles maybe complexes of thinking about this pasta or dis man called Jesus but anyhow the things that we are saying was too attractive for them to ignore Jesus so they decided to take a trip anyhow whether they understood the program or not when I understood what he preached or not whether they understood his instruction or not it doesn't matter they wanted a taste and the Bible says they devised a plan to approach Jesus and they went through some of the Apostles as an excuse me sir can you oppose book an appointment and the man said to to passer Jesus who are you we are Greeks I would love to tell my fellow colleague and unrelated to another person and the two of them came and said pastor the Greeks are interested in seeing you amen now when you see the Prophet preach saga will see Jesus is not preaching just seeing him as a person they want to see the working of Jesus [Applause] that is a meaning of sass we will see Jesus and you know Jesus when asked that request is said now it's my time for purification you won't understand - it won't be glorified until he dies if the Gentiles are beginning to have an awakening that they need me they want to enjoy my walking they want to see my power they want to be a my effect then something has gotta take place now then Jesus give them a parable he said except a corn of wheat dies if we abide a law that one con will remain one con and if it says long that one can we be hedging and it should be depreciated but if that one con will produce ma is got to be ready to die so God believes in harvest heaven it's absurd as such this one con dies it will abide alone by itself the disciples may not understand what he has passed a message then gradually the one con began to talk about his death and like you add in the morning Peter will say over my dead body will you die you got a lot of zeroes people in the church it's fine it will get better with them as they keep growing in the Lord Peter taught was doing crazy fever but I didn't realize that by that it was trying to stop God's program anyhow the divine program couldn't be stopped it came to that particular day our Lord went down the reason it went down is to be able to multiply so God knew that if you plant one seed of corn you are going to get up he's a cop even though two curves and on a curb you have many seeds of car are you catchin it now I'm preaching this because this is the kind of advice God preached this is the kind of others Jesus our Lord preached this is the kind of average brother Brahm preached FS is not the rapture FS is something that would take place before the rapture it might sound strange to you but that is the truth okay let's go on alright so when he died settin knowing that if this man get off there's gonna be a problem is it I don't know when Christ was alive his life was a problem when he died it was a problem when a rose brother it was also a problem but is there a problem to you it's just aside you belong now these people watch him while alive now he has given up the ghost yielded up the ghost they confirmed it's themselves they were the one who wondered about the body to be buried and when it was buried they came back to Pilate excuse me Pilate excuses governor you see this deceiver then we are actually afraid because they know that everything he had ever spoken nothing has ever failed and while he was alive he told him I have the power to lay down my life nobody ever talked like that because nobody lived by himself nobody exist by himself there only one qualified to be hello him is the one who come in the body called Christ I have once before hey bruh he rejoiced to see my day before Abraham was I have the new everything he had spoken had come to pass and you watch the politics watch something he said that deceiver while he was alive since that it will raise on the tenth day and we know that wisdom to have an idea that it will not happen hmm but so we want you to let I am more amore and security and seal the place so that nobody will come and tell your story now these people are bad politicians and they are very wicked do you know when you tell the truth you will be consistent but because with these people we align they couldn't be consistent I will show you the align now one of the reasons they killed Jesus Christ was to say that he said if we destroy our temple and on the touch day it will Reza talked they pretended then as if they did not understand what Jesus said so this the opposition is against their better judgment then knew that wasn't what Jesus Christ said Jesus wasn't talking of destroying physica temple he was talking of the temple of himself but when it was convenient they came to use it as an exhibit in order to get him crucified then why did they change the story of the crucifixion percenter this man said on the third day we rise oh he didn't say it twice is that it at the same place that them is controlled the only thing that can make you constant is if you tell the truth so it's just that these people we are liars these people were deceived they understood better what Jesus said but because of the needs to gather false accusation against him the sanitary would destroy a temple now they are no more talking about the temple they are now talking about himself [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes brother we are sporting the devil and the governor said I don't understand you people again when this man was alive it was your problem now is dead is your headache excuse me you have the Lord you have the enforcement agenda police and everything and the soldiers go on attend to it as much as you wanted you know what was happening the devil was using those guys to disturb the arrest the ones that planted seeds to die and rotten and never bring forth life but there is nothing that can stop God's program the law of God is does the soul in tears must reap in joy nothing can stop it nothing absolutely can stop his resurrection it has done be spoken it must come to pass [Applause] so excuse me so what happened they went to the grave they put several Roman seals that is one other time let's leave that one but they put to those hills and they I had my mercenaries and soldiers yes looking guy with sophisticated weapons to do what to block the office because they know if Jesus have a rise up according to his principles of John chapter 12 there is going to be problem Satan was contending with just one man but is now have to is not going to face many members body of the same one can you catch that that is God's harvests so they put everything in there but I like it when the scripture said on the Ted T the angel of the Lord Kingdom [Music] where were these guys they didn't sleep that we are wide awake God kept them wide awake to see everything that happened in the oven wide awake that we are shaken that we are shaken and this angel came he broke the seal and erode away the stone and is such upon it tryna challenge try me if you can we tell your weapons with all your palms we tell you artilleries try me if you can and the surgeons couldn't they couldn't do it then they can do it nothing will stop this arrest nothing will stop your body change nothing will stop your resurrection nothing will stop your abduction because it has been spoken it must come to pass having an actual pass away God's Word can never pass away there is not enough demons in hell thou canst repeat they can stop your display they can stop your demonstration we have a promise a quick short walk will take place in here we have a promise there will be another outpouring brother Bram said in our spiritual race listen to me is that the vehicle of the bride at our transit of the Antichrist in the message looking away to Jesus is that what we are doing now is to slow down and waiting for them to catch up inside when they catch up watch the tote pool then what you see temporarily manifested will come in its fullness the total is in existence right now but it will not come in a great measure until that time something will provoke it the Antichrist will provoke it and we are waiting for them nothing will stop our demonstration let me remind you your touch this is not the edge of horse so no sacrificial animal here this is the edge of eagle when the enemy comes like a float we have a promise the Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard when Eston that is risen it goes above the floor come on friends a wonderful time is ahead don't worry don't worry brother Brahm said this quiz will be here fellowship in like these will become fond memories he said is gonna put a pressure on us until we are almost pressed out he said what you've got nothing to be afraid of because at that hour oh there's gonna be a revival of the jaws that's gonna be another foreign it's a promise it will never fail only believe all things are possible this is the office we are talking about [Applause] sure the hinges sat on each and it was watching what the soldiers will do instead of the soldiers are talking they were so scared until when death environment settle down they took to their heels they run for their dear lives and I watch where did they go - they went to other people their principals who engage their services and when I got there that didn't mince words as a massage except we shall deceive our sir we saw him who did you see that's a man the man you call the deceiver we saw him you watch out everybody ought to know who our Lord he's evil Satan we testified we saw in usage Jesus yes sir it came out so what did you do what can we do the glory was too much the power was too much the presence was too great for any man to face - [Music] [Applause] yes I problem now there quickly someone becomes you it's all is it or getting a church members when they want to do bad things they don't they need only short notice you see them gather gossip as don't need long notices together but bite has done it locked it's it's so easy these guys quickly gather what must we do now watch conspiracies are started from the church against their own conscience these guys are going to bypass their conscience dangerous fellows too old unto a lie and make the a chemistry believe it is the truth bribery started from the church the piper sighs okay okay okay okay we have I don't don't say it again don't say it again don't say it again so what must we say we are going to keep we're going to organize a press conference and we are going to give you a prepared written script and you are going to read it out whether you feel it correct or not just bypass your conscience and say what we tell you and if you can accept that the deal is two million dollars yes that now you are talking you are talking organize the press conference they organize the press conference Nebraska news here and BBC all kind of ordered to give a wide international coverage and they told them you see friends we did our job but somehow along the line they know their lies won't sell and they know that it was going to embarrass the Iraqi of the harming so they told them in advance you go ahead with the press conference if the governor is annoyed will be secure emotion this is the church talking this is not business this is not politicians this is they charge come on friends charge talking and they organized a conference and they told the ally this man did not resolve it was stolen and they have done it so well that they were no Ally a reporter to interview them to interrogate them so one reporter got up to say what were you doing when it was - how can you be sleeping say we won't entertain questions because it's actually shameful for a soldier to be sleeping at such a critical time so they they had it all arranged and the Bible said the news that it was stolen started traveling father than the news that it resurrected and you say you would have expected Jesus to do something about that look at that you would have expected him to come out and organize a counter press conference some of us that is what we will do but that is not what Christ will do adoption material amen Ted something from here it was allowed the news to be going in you have nobody can blight his name and it didn't even make it easy at least appear to some few public people let them testify even if they will call it apparition if they will call it illusion let them call it what appear to somebody the Bible says Jesus never did that he appeared only to those who share connection I guess the snooze you are going around do you know what he chose to do silently it began to empower an army because now what the devil was pushing him to do will have broken the scripture the seed of corn has died it has rotten and it has come back alive it's coming back alive is to reproduce himself in plentiful so it is not longer it is no longer the Ministry of Christ to defend himself it did all that be proved is point before it dies after is dead and resurrection it is less for his body to stop giving the proof that it is not that this was why Jesus refused him it's not that empowering is before it started empowering the disciples and see what they are saying is a don't worry we shall apply them we shall apply them you catch this you catch this you catch this and it was fortifying them when they finish their fortification is that the ceiling of your fortification is the apparel you can stay there when that power comes you will be my witnesses those lies they are talking it will never take you one week to change the story I am giving you what it takes to change the story so don't mind what they are saying that ever cannot make me obey Him he wants to push me to take over your own ministry Christ is not gonna take over years he has done is it is enough for you to take it over from there this was why he refused to reply he refused to all the press conference there on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fair the Holy Ghost fell with the falling of the Holy Ghost came the understanding of the wedge because by - Pizza understood what Matthew 28 was he knew it wasn't in titles it has got to be in a name so the first salmon was a salmon with revelation in the name of Jesus Christ and they keep in ansan the church and the people began to look at them very differently then one day Peter James and John the satyr walking the want to go to the temple and one man who has always been there everybody knew him the critics know him the believers know him the unbelievers know him so if something happened to him it cannot be said it's a lie because everybody knew him and this man began to look at this region to many as if to get something from them he wanted a little TT dollars to service problem temporarily but inside this earthen vessel was a deposit of permanent solution was a deposit of eternal life my goodness inside this earthen vessels is a deposit of eternal life to give life to give healing to give deliverance for even give salvation [Music] so Peter said look on Hoss TT dollars u.s. dollars British pounds we don't have as old as you people are well-dressed into me you don't have sometimes it's like that we don't have [Applause] but such as we have this is the obvious now this is the harvest now such as we have will give unto you they did not even bring they only spoke this what as Christ's such as we have will give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the Bible signs the man the man the man is status now what began to work upon him and it began to gather strange and it's not gotten up and it begins to walk and to limp enter praise the Lord what in lipping present the Lord walking limping pressing [Applause] as such is a stitch that's what the ovens in any one has discharged no one that enhance York when the people shot these people is a little forget it this guy's a christ-like in harder watch disciplines Ian of Christ as we produce many Christ this is the harvest [Applause] oh and guess what up on top the news of this Reviva went everywhere they haven't seen anything like blush and be some guys who were critics it gots to them so we do with distance going but we supply we put so much millions for the press to suppress these news and yet this news is traveling Jesus is wiser it doesn't only talk he hawks the gospel is not just in watch there must be a demonstration oh [Applause] he doesn't only talk he hacks then they called the disciples what do we have fridge to hear that we hear it now watch in Acts chapter three said by what power and what name did you do it Peter yes an opportunity I wanted I wanted my lord to organize a press conference long time ago he didn't do it now you people have organized a press conference and I will take advantage okay all of you listen now listen now you see the same Jesus whom you crucified hallelujah you crucified Him but God blessed him it aside we saw him with touch him we felt him we impressive and we know that in resurrected not sin Jesus fetch in his name heal this man you can challenge such a press conference so Jesus was defending his integrity in his many member bodies that is the Amish [Applause] that is why brother Brown says the first office was Pentecost is a quotation ecetera is that the first of s was Pentecost if there was an harvest of Pentecost that means there was a seed suing to bring about our harvest then is that after Pentecost when she cost itself by the Apostles became another seed swing [Music] because it started the beginning of many members body we are as it was always one person it has now become the body of that one person with many members are you catching the Church of the Living God then it became the new deposits for another of s brother Brahm said this new deposit which is not the deposit this soil of the bridegroom now but of his bride was buried Magnusson canceled so the truth was held until the edges of the charge went into the dark era that's what he's saying and it looks like that is the end to each but bring the principle of John chapter 12 a game for NEC to multiply itself which the multiplication is the harvest there must be a planting first God wasn't satisfied with the number he gathered in Pentecost he wanted more pasta pizza with no one less man with one warm that's inspiration from God so you know what it is what was buried all of a sudden in luta started giving a shoot so this one is not actually dead and gone it was all God's program those thoughts are not a mighty Reeve i'ma [Applause] now look I didn't carry the entire pitch of the siege don't take it off when the seed is buried to the ground if you are taking it off you are gonna kill me completely just leave it if you have a moment it looks like nothing is happening or will ever happen for you just leave it as long as it is an original seat The Sun will be just right for it then what I will be just right for it God is never a loser is the best farmer I ever knew you know again in that dark in that period again the devil went on a rampage and he started accusing God the silence God God did not respond as usual God allow him to be making his noise then in luta he gave a shoot which is a sign that in life that was buried under a started his journey of physical manifestation now that life which was a stalk moved from the stalk into tassel amen brother Bronson Luther was like a former in then Wesley became its lottery then from that I sell it moved into the shock Tasha was Wesley now all these stages stages of the potential siege but it is not deceit yet the Prophet said if I need a hook tree and you give me a seat of oak potentially I have my hope tree now the husband man must be patient to plant a seed and to do the work of cultivation and in due season they will get the hook tree it is only impatience - we process life arise so it moves gradually the life left the stalk it came into the tussle and from the tassel it moved into the shop now the shock it's always looking like the real thing but it is not the real thing hey what the shot is necessary to certain times I'm sure you enjoy the blessings of the morning and that is why in this age God allowed this year the first move of God in loud this young age was a Pentecostal move we're bringing it home to us now this age started as a Pentecostal age that was the period of the shock love day she has got two phases for the believer underline the word for the believer for non-believer is just got one fish but for the seed of God in this hour there are two phases the Pentecostal experience is very important it is your shock experience to prepare you for the real thing that's what the Prophet stars Marissa brother Bram said for you to get the wish you must pull the shock away or that grain must abandon the shock that was what we have been told in the morning and it was simplified to even our personal lives you catch on it why must the grain leave the shock because the Sharks protection will not facilitate ripening it's a good protection to keep this grain till certain stage but in the hour of a vest for there to be harvest some timers a punch to the shop are you catchin it and this is why if you look at certain stories of redemption you will realize that the journey of redemption always starts with two categories let's go to the Bible do you know the roof was brought into the economy of redemption in Israel in the season of badly events aha the Prophet said we bring my understanding from the scripture is to do types and shadows we are not geologists so we can do tessaro's and all kind of this but we'll bring the pattern from the scriptures are you following now Ruth spoke of you and her it's a perfect time because Ruth was a Gentile who was brought to enjoy the blessings who was brought by kinsman-redeemer she into the economy and the blessings that used to be the preserve of Israel and it was important for roots to come ah the design for roots to be in the picture was necessary to give you a perfect shadow otherwise you will not be able to relate with your Redemption now roots coming into the economy of Israel wasn't an accident brother brown preach why it had to be Bethlehem and it told us in that message that before the foundation of the world God has designed and arranges program and part of that program is to include the Gentiles in the salvation plan as a matter of fact the true women that bill to the a century of Jesus were Gentile women [Applause] you're talking about rare and you talk about Ruth come on friends I feel so good I'm a 10 time and look how beautiful disease God took people who look worthless Moab was almost an abomination to Israelites you know their backgrounds they came out of instance she was living oh my and whatever rap that woman was so much in prostitution until a lot became a sunny gray up the a lot do you ever notice ernamaria a lot was a surname but Messi rewrote their lives it is not impair wheelage not in the runners or managers God as you are messing the race is not for the Swift's not a batch of artists wrong hallelujah Ruth can aim in the season of others and when she started a journey to come she didn't stutter alone she didn't start alone she started with another lady who looked like ah they were both called daughters-in-law one was Appa one was Ruth and they both decided hallelujah I'm pretty pastor they both decided to come with Nami in the season of Ava's hey I'm gonna touch someone's now for you to know that whatever is happening along the message today shouldn't discourage you or these are things that are to be if the picture will be perfect you have some people who are pretty messy for 40 years and today they are talking the same message they never typed it in 1965 they never attacked it in 1962 what they are talking it now because it is the season of the office [Applause] and the picture must become perfect I've got enough apologies for such nonsense whether I believe this I know Dutch design I don't care somebody once told me United States you say you could be shot for that as a just one bullet if God allows you while you cannot suppress me from saying the truth I am a witness of the resurrection and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ I must add press conference all the time [Music] it is a season of the harvest and up as most sure hope it wasn't easy to get up out of the journey she traveled very far Alleluia until now me preach a message of hopelessness because it is all about what they can get out of it if they can no longer catch anything then nothing is longer the truth they told women not to wear trousers but the moment they denied a message their wives thought that we are in pants what has been the 'value for 40 years nonsense [Applause] Naaman looks at the two of them is the excuse me ladies maybe you don't understand what is happening I'm saying that I'm an old woman I'm saying that there's no more child in my womb let's even say God allowed me to have a child and then it becomes a son or two boys or twins now you people are maybe I don't know that you're twenty late twenties and before this boy can marry you you will have become 50 and you will become will you wait for them till that long opposite that makes sense that lets that made sense so many nonsenses are making sense toward you a pass of this hour today it wasn't there when when Wendy Wendy Wendy Ringo of cloud appeared that make sense he wasn't there it's not a news who was the first person who told you it wasn't there it was brother Branham because you don't read your message correctly girlie the message three kinds of believers it's a distant upon it at two days before I got there or two days after I went there it was brother Bram who said we didn't plant it in the tips from day one that was his first public commentary so it is not news for you to come and tell us that we have discovered this lie he never lies but what you cannot deny is the fact that that happened because witnesses a bunch today only prophet told to take cover why the angels came down if you think it was after it got there brother Branson it was the Angels departing after their message if you say it was before it was after it was before I got there it was the angels lowering down to give the message it already said that so you are not telling us something new but what the Hoppus of this hour it makes sense it will look so real to you but you know us certain things are written in other to Teke of APPA ah in the message of villain of god brother Brahms that we have to say things deliberately sometimes and he said it is intentionally said it will cause some to ponder it will cause some to sit down and say lord have mercy upon me it will cause him to stumble out and they will stain the compound wondering whether to come back or - square way and if you make some to go completely away but the Prophet said that is done intentionally because every seed line must be taken care of come on friends the dynamics of the true church and the first charge is in the end of one man brother Brahma the Messenger of God will speak for God to put the true church and the false charge but it is actually a messenger to the true church but since God does not have to mouth he's gonna use only one mouthpiece that one mouthpiece we bring the light for the hour and every plantation vegetation whether good or bad they need sunlight sunlight is not going to change your seat what is going to transform that seat through different stages to come to its maturity and achieve its purpose so Judas Iscariot beampath of Christ disciple was not accidental Jesus chose him listen to me he chose him and from day one he knew who he was several times II told him who he was somebody will deceive me and somebody will deny me somebody will betray me he's always here Mighty One a Mighty One when it comes to Judas it douse it in another day he said that man who is dependant with me now but do you know what it couldn't do that betrayer until his time was right then he waited for his Dynamics who gave him his inspiration the Lord Jesus Christ himself Jesus look at him one day and said that which thou do it too quickly it was a first charge but it was inspired by Jesus come on friends to his own work there are not too light in this hour whether they accept or deny the message of the hour is God's light for today and whatever see you ha where the tears are which you must interact with the message this is what there is no problem in the message brother branham said many will come within the range of the message the range is defense of the message in support only few people with a special hearing ability which is otherwise called revelation will come inside you love him tonight amen so Obama's always be here and Ruth will be here they were priests they were preached the same message nama didn't isolate Ruth to preach one message and isolated Appa just as God never isolated Cain and Abel all the seed line started from Janice's brother Brahma the plenty was from Genesis and throughout the ages we have seen the seed line that we come to final others in this last hour Jesus God told Cain and Abel offer me something cocaine it was fruit he never brought something bad it brought the best what Aladin revelation of the blood to FL it was the blood that is what we think I know it was there I know it was it's annoying boss a message different reactions you already hacked by your seats type send message to hapa and to route it makes sense I gotta go back now and now mister what's going on Ruth your colleague had come back what are you doing excuse me mama from today don't talk about it we make it what a revelation in treatment not stroke forsake you because you are wasting your time doesn't that look like John chapter 6 except you eat my flesh and you drink my blood tsunami was preaching the tour pool there except you hit my flesh and you drink my blood no life it makes sense we cannot be cannibals pasta the last time you visited my house what did I give you you give me a stick and the steak I want you to define a properly what part of steak it was annoying does their finger like the Lord thank you very much I taught you was I give you the fingers of a human being you have just caught those cannibals now who intended for us to eat your flesh and to drink your blood when we are not vampires and they are left they took offence unto Christ you guys are still remain iuc want you also good reason why are you talking like this the hope shall we go to 90s that you are the one who has the words of eternal life whether we understand or not Peter and the rest of this cuts to Revelation Jesus can never be wrong and this is a revelation that is keeping you on high it is not how much we understand it is how much we can believe be it unto me [Applause] and friends in the season of the others Ruth came into the economy of Israel she came to spies she came without a right welcome bosses truths there something told her that's a blessing ahead just give angular just him standing just people even friends there are blessings ahead keep believing keep holding are you have the court read for you in the morning they are betrayers there are be temptations there are the prosecution's there'll be challenges but for the believer toward em who are called according to his purpose all things work together for good there is one bounds of the devil's activity that can send them to hell they are bound to arrive [Applause] she entered the contradiction and she started walking the professor nama never needed to tell her go get something she knows she must water this message she must support this message she must take care of this message she must never allow any evil flies to pitch on each she must keep this endtime consecration which are purity and she was doing our best then one day the lord of the harvest boys was passing by and said who is this young lady who is this young lady The ministers are you here you go to introduces young ladies to the Lord ha ha ha the young man said that is the lady we've been telling you about the one that came with your kinsmen now me get our swar pious that was so good that was so hard walking that was so faithful that was so loving that was so caring taking care of my relative oh my is a blessed out my daughter and I say blessings be on to you tonight it's a bless down my daughter Ruth was so shocked as you take notice of me is that it has been reported to me Ruth is going for adoption it's been reported to me Alleluia the Holy Ghost has been given reports of our you are fearing of your hair pods of your labor of your activities of your faithfulness in the season of others it was reported oh is this why you take knowledge of me let me tell you he's taking knowledge of you to learn do not be weary in well-doing keep holding on keep serving him keep trusting him keeping faithful it's taking notes oh [Applause] you know what watch out this he said okay you know what I'm gonna do for you you took the right decision to come with my reality and us serving behind your decision you've got to get some rest then it told the young man said listen to me none of you must touch this girl the husband man the great famine never said within the recess of his art he was interested amen but anyhow I started becoming protective he started telling our boundary lines don't go beyond there I don't want anybody messing around you you just keep here and inside I watch it is that whatever she does pay our wages but every once in a while beyond a level beyond the effort giver and full on purpose give up on us this brother Branson so the roots can know that our Christ is still in a mission and we are enjoying the and fullness brother prams that purple is in existence but it will not come in greater measure amen because it's been thoroughly identified when God started it it in pocket oh I left it here that is why once in awhile we break through the channels and we say things your friends need rain a cigarette given even right now with our prayer there unfold on purposes I've seen without hands hands that are meant for oppression I've cinders and stretch in house we just work there and Fulham by the word of the Lord absent women received their babies without one Brea handful on Papa's [Music] brother brems have what we have watched in this mum there's the presence of each did we only come to fullness in the Desolator head don't touch their wine don't touch the spirit don't take it away from god's people that topple is here and full of bubbles give us she's coming to fullness or it's God's program you don't bother your self and Ruth was enjoying it and she will package and go home and go and give now me not merely say which side did you walk today I just wanna go and just one day you can withdraw this and fool on this is why sometimes go just look at you it was same some blessings and you are wondering why how did you come about this and full of purpose sometimes you do things beyond your monthly salary and yet you didn't still and you are wondering how it came about and full on purpose sometimes you end the house of the laws you went into the cloud of God's glory when you came back you don't know how you I even feeling you've just seen many things disappeared in your life and food on purpose because you are the roof of this hour Oh glory to God and now Miss Earth in the season of the service is that as a Ruth I want to give you permanent rest I want to unite you with your head I want the picture to be perfected Alleluia so you don't just look like him you become we think is not possible it is the rising of the Sun is that this price will be worth of his watch power of his power life of his life in fact she will be in so whatever scripture I applied to him applies to her come on friends that's redemption story does the harvest of this hour under is that the husband man tonight is gonna celebrate a service Oh Ruth will you do just one more thing for me it might look simple but you got to do this because if you miss this decision of others hey don't miss it French it's the season of others redemption must be complete you've got to be totally married you've gotta be united with your hands hallelujah to bring a glory that will even bring resurrection of those who had gun that's what the word says ma this is the system roots are whatever you say I will do so you know what you're gonna do for me go Mac we electrolyzed you just Mac really and don't go too easy just a defeat that man is a righteous noble man when he sees that in those what to do and when Ruth did that boy said instead of calling Ruth a prostitute or somebody was making an unusual advance it said that even my was now video Bible in that you did not take a decision to go with all this young man hallelujah no young man died for you [Music] didn't catch that now no young man can redeem you know pastor died for you not Minister died for you that was brother promise type of the young man don't carry the image of the holy man come to the Savior make no delay it is your kinsman redeemer you have to be united with price desire them follow the young man you don't carry the image of the holy man you are subject to the truth you wanted to be whole wash all - I would do the right thing I will do what I need to do he went to a kinsman who seemed to be nearer the kinsman said I cannot do it is that no problem because for him to do it is gotta take it now me he said I don't want that he said okay we don't wonder how we do it and they called for the elders and right before he held us he said this day everything now me had i redeemed hallelujah and for my bonus I got you ruthless my bride and all the women catalog and semi couple as the woman they were blessing the price you were receiving blessings to be fruitful to multiply to be prosperous inside may God bless that woman that is coming to your house may God make her like Mia may God make her like a chair the two women that beauteous of Israel do that what me in Bethlehem and I said hey man I'm

head she brought forth Christ for that house hey she reproduce in the game and they come together from there to give birth to a child God obey and from a bad care Jesse and from Jessica and David and from David Camm the Lord Jesus Christ roots generation are you here in the season of the Havas now let me close with this Robitaille the 12 spies in the first Exodus a man realized when the TEDx arose when the TEDx Allah the first Exodus the second Exodus and this is the third one I must not fail to say this so bear with me all right in the first Exodus God was taking a nation out of a nation the second was taking a charge out of religion and this last one is taking the bride out of the church is taking the bride out of the shock because they with cannot mature in the Pentecostal age of love this year okay this then these twelve spies I'm gonna close on this and I would trust the Lord to walk in the spirit through the rest of the men of God this 12 spies they were sent out for spying in a vest season this other season is something you were really inspired me for root it was ballet events this one it was the arrest of grips yeah and as you can watch again the two lines we are obviously by the time they were coming back ten we on one side which it will report so much it will report along the message to them but that's fine the shadow says it the reality was showing but no matter how bad it is there will be the two again who will say we are modern able not just that we can make it we are mortal they will never be negative they will remain positive the Giants don't matter collapses the a bread for us I wish I eat them [Applause] the challenges don't matter they are bred for us and we shall hit them this quiz will not matter it is bread for us because we know that ten elders are warming up in the Pentecostal age of the church to unleash terror to this bright economy but we are waiting for them they are bred for us and we shall eat them for watch this watch this when they came back the gospel of we cannot make it made more sense to majority much more than the minority think about our forty minutes men die but the spirits that propel them don't die this spirit is still with us today that is why you are seen so many fallen away after all Jesus and Daddy of the Lord shall not come true Peter on CD as a falling away first it runs through the time people will become something else even our Lord said accepted Debbie shortened no flesh shall be saved but yes we are winding it down when they we are preaching the gospel the older people felt the new better said preach fun the younger people I want to be a young fellow right now this is not our kind of gospel then when Joshua and Caleb took over and say man I'm brother you have only had one side please listen to the other side but you know how much an influence that gospel of we cannot make hat in the life of this people but Isaac it was so impacting it made so much sense until these folks we're willing to travel back two years into Egypt and they started looking for instead of going two weeks forward into opinon you go look at the map brother brems and it's five days from Kadesh into Canaan let's put plus or minus let's make it robust to its maximum people we're willing to good two years backward instead of two weeks forward in the season of the harvest because of a strange goes well think about your life tonight said let us make captain who is going to be our captain they started shopping for captain does not misfortune first of all let us make up using a lot of people have evil in their heart they are only looking for out for a model said let us make captain who we take us back to Egypt and just one collapse and Lord this can be you have only heard one side have you forgotten the power of God in Egypt have you forgotten the power of God in the Red Sea have you forgotten I will wear hungry and he gave us mana we are thirsty give us water we have a last one bathroom or Mysore bless a large I'm forget not his benefit have you forgotten all those things never mix with faith India [Music] when Josh run killebrew's up to 70 situation they were so influenced by the gospel of we cannot make it until they pick up stones and we're ready to kill Joshua and Caleb and the glory of God descended friends at that moment it was too late one of these days is gonna be too late brother Brahm said the Spirit of the Lord would be withdrawn he that is only will be holy still he that is filthy will be filled this year he told us of a time that church will be here for a while even it's
