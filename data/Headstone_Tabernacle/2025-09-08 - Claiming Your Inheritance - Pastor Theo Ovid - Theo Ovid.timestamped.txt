[27:48] Amen.
[27:51] Um,
[27:54] and I want to commit the day into the
[27:57] Lord in prayer.
[27:59] Psalm chapter
[28:01] 130
[28:03] says, "Out of the depth have I cried
[28:06] unto thee, O Lord,
[28:09] Lord, hear my voice?
[28:12] Let thine ears be attentive to the voice
[28:15] of my supplications.
[28:17] If thou shouldest mark iniquities,
[28:20] oh Lord, who shall stand? But there is
[28:24] forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest
[28:27] be feared. I wait for the Lord. My soul
[28:31] doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My
[28:37] soul waiteth for the Lord more than they
[28:40] that watch for the morning. I say more
[28:43] than they that watch for the morning.
[28:46] Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with
[28:49] the Lord there is mercy, and with him is
[28:53] plenteous redemption.
[28:55] He shall redeem Israel from all his
[28:59] iniquities. May God add blessing to the
[29:01] reading of his word this morning. Let's
[29:04] just lift our hands and uh pray as we
[29:06] pray together and ask God's blessing
[29:09] upon the service this morning. Amen.
[29:12] Almighty God, we are thankful this
[29:14] morning. We are grateful this morning,
[29:16] Lord, that you you see us, Lord, through
[29:20] eyes of love. Lord, you've forgiven us
[29:23] of all our sins. You have healed our
[29:26] land. We thank you this morning for your
[29:29] goodness towards us. Lord, we open our
[29:32] our eyes to see the sunshine. Lord, we
[29:35] thank you for another day, Lord. This
[29:38] day that you have made, we shall rejoice
[29:41] and be glad in it this morning. out of
[29:44] the depths. We are crying this morning
[29:46] unto you, dear God, now that you would
[29:47] come into this place, Lord, and bless
[29:51] the hearts of your people as we wait to
[29:54] hear from you this morning, Lord. As we
[29:55] wait, standing on your promised word,
[29:58] Lord, knowing that you are able to
[30:00] fulfill it, Lord, we pray that you're
[30:02] blessed, Lord. Pray that you pour your
[30:04] spirit in a mighty way this morning. May
[30:07] your anointed people, anoint the word of
[30:09] God, anoint your speaker, Lord, as he
[30:12] prepares to get ready to preach the word
[30:15] this morning. Lord, we pray that you
[30:17] would just, Lord, clothe every fiber of
[30:20] his being in the fire of the living God.
[30:23] Lord, may anoint him to speak the word
[30:24] of God this morning. Give him strength
[30:26] physically, Lord. Give him strength
[30:28] mentally and in every other way. Father,
[30:31] may I just ignite his spirit this
[30:33] morning and make him a flame of fire to
[30:36] be a tool for the harvest today. For the
[30:39] fields are white to harvest, but the
[30:42] laborers are few. Lord, may you send
[30:44] laborers into harvest, oh God. Lord,
[30:46] that we'll reap a rapture this morning
[30:49] of souls waiting to be caught up
[30:51] together with you, dear God, in the
[30:52] clouds. For this is the great promise
[30:54] you give to the church in the last day.
[30:56] Father, make us ready, dear God. make us
[30:59] fit servants by your word and by the
[31:01] release of your spirit this morning to
[31:04] minister to us and get us into shape
[31:07] this morning. Granted, almighty God we

[54:54] name I ask it. Amen. God bless you. If
[54:56] you have your Bibles I like you take to
[54:57] two portion of scripture. Deuteronomy
[55:00] chapter 11 want to read verse 10 to 25
[55:02] and Joshua chapter 14 want to read the
[55:06] first verse and then from 6 to13 reading
[55:09] from Deuteronomy chapter 11 reading
[55:12] verse 10. God speaks for the land
[55:15] whether thou goest in to possess it. It
[55:17] is not as the land of Egypt from whence
[55:20] he came out. Where thou seest thy seed
[55:23] and water it is with thy foot as a
[55:26] garden of herbs, but the land whether ye
[55:29] go to possess. So God is telling them
[55:31] where they're heading to. He's telling
[55:33] them where they're going. Is a land of
[55:35] hills and valleys and drinkketh water of
[55:37] the rain of heaven. A land which the
[55:40] Lord thy God carth for. The eyes of the
[55:43] Lord thy God are always upon it,
[55:45] &gt;&gt; from the beginning of the year, even to
[55:47] the end of the year. It shall come to
[55:49] pass, if he shall hearken diligently
[55:51] unto my commandments, which I command
[55:53] you this day, to love the Lord your God,
[55:55] and to serve him with all your heart and
[55:57] with all your soul, that I will give you
[55:59] the reign of your land in his due
[56:02] season, the first rain and the latter
[56:04] rain, that thou mayest gather in thy
[56:07] corn and thy wine and thine oil. and I
[56:10] will send grass in thy field for thy
[56:12] cattle that thou mayest eat and be full.
[56:16] Take heed to yourselves that your heart
[56:18] be not deceived, and he turn aside and
[56:20] serve other gods and worship them. And
[56:23] then the Lord wrath be kindled against
[56:25] you. And he shut up the heaven that
[56:27] there be no rain. And did the land yield
[56:29] not of fruit, unless he perish quickly
[56:32] from off the ground good land which the
[56:34] Lord giveth you. Therefore shall he lay
[56:36] up these my words in your heart and in
[56:39] your soul and bind them for a sign upon
[56:42] your hand that they may be as frontlets
[56:44] between your eyes that he shall teach
[56:47] them your children speaking of them when
[56:50] thou sitest in thine house when thou
[56:52] walst in the by the way when thou liest
[56:54] down and when thou riseth up and thou
[56:56] shalt write them upon the doorpost of
[56:58] thine house and upon thy gates that your
[57:01] days may be multiplied and the days of
[57:04] your children in the land which the Lord
[57:06] swear unto your fathers to give them as
[57:09] the days of heaven upon the earth. For
[57:11] if he shall diligently keep all these
[57:13] commandments which I command you to do
[57:15] them, to love the Lord your God, to walk
[57:17] in all his ways, and to cleave unto him,
[57:20] then will the Lord drive out these
[57:22] nations from before you, and he shall
[57:24] possess greater nations and mightier
[57:26] than yourselves. Every place whereon the
[57:29] souls of your feet shall tread shall be
[57:31] yours. From the wilderness and Lebanon,
[57:33] from the river and the river Euphrates,
[57:35] even unto the uttermost sea shall be
[57:37] your coast be. There shall no man be
[57:40] able to stand before thee. For the Lord
[57:42] your God shall lay the fear of you, and
[57:45] the dread of you upon all the land that
[57:48] he shall tread upon as he had said unto
[57:50] you.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; So you can understand now where God gave
[57:53] Joshua these instructions is from right
[57:55] here. And let's turn to Joshua chapter
[57:57] 14 and see what the Lord says here in
[57:59] verse one.
[58:02] And then we go down to verse 6. And
[58:03] these are the countries which the
[58:05] children of Israel inherited in the land
[58:08] of Canaan which Elazar the priests and
[58:10] the Joshua the son of Nun and the heads
[58:12] of the fathers of the tribes of the
[58:14] children of Israel distributed for
[58:16] inheritance to them. Go down to verse
[58:18] six. Then the children of Judah came to
[58:21] Joshua in Gal.
[58:24] Caleb the son of Jeffon the Kezonite
[58:26] said unto him, "Thou knowest the thing
[58:28] that the Lord said unto Moses, the man
[58:30] of God concerning me, and thee in Kenesh
[58:33] Bania, 40 years old was I, when the
[58:36] Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me
[58:38] from Kenishbania to espou the land, and
[58:40] I brought him word again as it was in my
[58:43] heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that
[58:45] went up with me made the heart of the
[58:48] people melt, but I wholly followed the
[58:50] Lord my God." And Moses swway on that
[58:53] day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy
[58:55] feet have trotten shall be thine
[58:57] inheritance, that thy children forever,
[58:59] because thou has holy followed the Lord
[59:02] my God. And now behold, the Lord had
[59:04] kept me alive, as he said these 40 and 5
[59:07] years, even since the Lord spake this
[59:09] word unto Moses, while the children of
[59:12] Israel wandered in the wilderness. And
[59:14] now, lo, I am this day four score and 5
[59:16] years old. And yet I am strong this day
[59:19] as I was in the day that Moses sent me.
[59:22] As my strength was then, even so is my
[59:24] strength now for war both to go out and
[59:27] to come in. Now therefore give me this
[59:29] mountain whereof the Lord God spake in
[59:32] that day. For thou heardest in that day
[59:34] how the anarchims were there that the
[59:36] cities were great and fenced. If so be
[59:38] the Lord be with me, then I shall be
[59:40] able to drive them out as the Lord said.
[59:44] And Joshua blessed him and gave unto
[59:46] Caleb the son of Jeff Hebron for an
[59:48] inheritance. May God bless his word. You
[59:50] may be seated. Just give him a shout as
[59:52] you sat sit down. Oh, praise the name of
[59:54] the Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be the
[59:56] name of the Lord.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So you know where I'm
[59:59] going this morning.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be
[1:00:02] the name of the Lord. The title this
[1:00:04] morning is claiming your inheritance.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have a subject. Give me
[1:00:08] this mountain.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I have an inspiration. It's
[1:00:12] the truth. Yeah,
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; I claim it.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I own it.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's my inspiration. It's the truth.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; I claim it.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; I own it.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; It is mine.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Praise
[1:00:27] God. So, we in we getting into warfare
[1:00:29] this morning.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; We get into battle this morning. I don't
[1:00:32] care what condition you're in. God said
[1:00:34] certain things about you.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here in the church.
[1:00:37] That's why you hear the word of God. God
[1:00:39] actually spoke certain things in your
[1:00:41] life. The devil that is troubling you,
[1:00:43] he got kicked out of heaven. He don't
[1:00:44] even belong here. Praise God. He is just
[1:00:47] a temporary resident on this earth. But
[1:00:49] we shall reign on the earth. We coming
[1:00:51] back. This earth belong to the sons and
[1:00:54] daughters of God. I'm not talking about
[1:00:56] church now. I'm talking about the earth.
[1:00:58] We are promised dominion over the earth.
[1:01:00] When God called Adam, he he called Adam
[1:01:02] to have dominion over. Power over.
[1:01:06] Hallelujah. And God want you to have
[1:01:07] power over your circumstance, your
[1:01:09] condition, your situation. It must not
[1:01:12] power over you. Praise God. The devil
[1:01:14] want to afflict you with depression,
[1:01:16] frustration, sickness, tiredness,
[1:01:18] weariness, but you have an authority
[1:01:20] this morning. Praise God. To raise up
[1:01:22] and say, "My God is able. My God is
[1:01:24] real. He is still a way maker. He is
[1:01:27] still a miracle worker. He still opened
[1:01:29] doors. He opened Red Sea. Praise God.
[1:01:31] When the door shut, he can still open
[1:01:33] those doors." Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:01:36] Are you with me this morning? So you can
[1:01:38] say clearly sickness is not mine.
[1:01:41] Depression that's not mine. Frustration
[1:01:43] that is don't belong to me. Hallelujah.
[1:01:46] Joy is mine. Uhhuh. Peace is mine.
[1:01:48] That's my inheritance. You have a right
[1:01:51] to have joy. Praise God. Jesus said this
[1:01:53] joy that you get, no man give it to you.
[1:01:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. God don't let no man
[1:01:58] steal your joy.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; May be seated. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:02:03] Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Let me just put a curtain behind a
[1:02:09] message.
[1:02:11] Brother,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; someone said, "How can you stand and let
[1:02:16] anybody call you such bad names?"
[1:02:19] Answer. You don't live for yourself.
[1:02:23] You live for others
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; that you might redeem that man.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; You become sons. The trouble of it is
[1:02:31] the church has forgot they are sons.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; You are sons. You are taking Christ's
[1:02:36] place. You are sons. So don't live for
[1:02:39] yourself. Live for others.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I can live for
[1:02:43] this brother because he's sure a nice
[1:02:45] man. That's not it. Live for the man who
[1:02:50] hates you.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Live for that person who will kill you
[1:02:59] if they could.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's what they done to him. Jesus.
[1:03:03] They killed him. He died that he might
[1:03:05] save them. That's eternal life.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; When you get that in your bosom, you are
[1:03:11] facing heaven then.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; But you sacrifice your own things, give
[1:03:15] them up like sheep gives wool and you
[1:03:18] look towards Calvary.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; So if we ourselves then in our ministry,
[1:03:24] in our thoughts, in our life, if we
[1:03:26] abide as we are, we can do no good. We
[1:03:29] have got to also die at the altar
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; or we will live alone. We would live
[1:03:35] here we go to some denomination
[1:03:38] of some creed.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; You see that's why some people love the
[1:03:41] church so much and love the pastor so
[1:03:42] much in the way that they're not loving
[1:03:44] the word of God to apply to their hearts
[1:03:47] that it could be effective to them.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Do you get that?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; They love the church. They love the
[1:03:52] teaching. They love the and that. But
[1:03:54] they have to love God.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord with all your heart. Not
[1:03:58] so much church, but God.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Because when you love God, the word is
[1:04:02] personal.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Because it's the truth.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; I claim it.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; So if your sister don't want to live it,
[1:04:13] that's that's her. That's not you.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; If your father don't want it, that's
[1:04:16] him. That's not you.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; If your mother don't want to walk by it,
[1:04:19] that's her. That's not you.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; You want it.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. stand
[1:04:26] alone
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; because that's what Caleb did.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; When time come for inheritance, he stood
[1:04:31] alone. He wasn't looking for the
[1:04:32] brethren to be with him. He wasn't
[1:04:34] looking for the crowd to be with him. He
[1:04:36] stepped forward.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; So watch, we lift to some denomination
[1:04:41] or some creed. We lift to some
[1:04:43] organization. But if we die to
[1:04:45] ourselves, then the Holy Spirit will be
[1:04:48] spread forth everywhere by our lips. We
[1:04:52] have got to die. Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. How we need in this journey that
[1:04:57] we're in now to find a place of rest and
[1:05:00] feast on the word of God so that it will
[1:05:03] give us strength. So he was talking here
[1:05:06] because he knew it will be a long
[1:05:07] journey. He was going he was going to
[1:05:10] die 965 but he knew that the the in
[1:05:14] other words the vision is true but the
[1:05:17] time is long. So he knew that we will
[1:05:19] have a time where we have to feast on
[1:05:21] the word to get the strength to go
[1:05:23] through this journey.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Many of us were very young when we
[1:05:27] received this message. I received it
[1:05:28] when I was 17 years old. But now I'm way
[1:05:31] double past that right now. I want to
[1:05:34] stop counting.
[1:05:36] So he said now now we what we need uh we
[1:05:39] are now to find a place of rest to feast
[1:05:41] on the word of God. So it will give us
[1:05:43] strength. Night after night go to the
[1:05:46] room and rest. Come back the next
[1:05:47] morning fresh. Eat more for there's
[1:05:49] great journey and a great battle ahead
[1:05:52] for the church
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; and we reached that yet.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Punch only 5% say amen. They feel in a
[1:05:58] real battle. The church get no battle
[1:05:59] yet or no.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; When they come to close us down fight
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; a great battle for the church. I believe
[1:06:07] that we have been children long enough.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; God is going to turn his church into
[1:06:13] manhood now.
[1:06:18] We have what? We have played and
[1:06:20] frolicked as children. But now we are
[1:06:22] going to have to put away childish
[1:06:24] things
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and take on manhood
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; or maturity.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Now we preach already under tutors and
[1:06:31] governors. Though a son and an heir, if
[1:06:34] he's a child, he no longer from a
[1:06:37] servant
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; because he's a child.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; So God objective is to bring the church
[1:06:41] into maturity.
[1:06:44] God objective is to bring you that you
[1:06:46] could stand on your own.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Solid as a rock.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Place it anywhere, anytime, any place,
[1:06:52] you will still stand.
[1:06:57] If we have no church, you will still
[1:06:58] stand. If you can't shake somebody hand,
[1:07:01] you will stand. If nobody is encouraging
[1:07:05] in your house, in the school, on the
[1:07:07] job, you will still stand.
[1:07:13] That's manhood.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; If you say manhood, he's talking about
[1:07:17] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:07:19] father and mother,
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; not a boy leave
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; a man.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; So the objective parenting is to bring
[1:07:25] them to manhood,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; not to own them and have a helicopter
[1:07:28] hoing over them.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And you be a helicopter parent, you only
[1:07:32] child, my child, my child, cut that crap
[1:07:34] out.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; It's not your child. It's a son. It's a
[1:07:38] daughter. That little baby is a man in
[1:07:41] baby form. When I was a child, I spake
[1:07:44] as a child. I understood as a child. But
[1:07:47] when I become a man,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; God, could you come and take away
[1:07:52] childish things? No. He said, "No, you
[1:07:53] put that away." God know angel are
[1:07:55] coming to put away that for you. You
[1:07:57] know what you're doing. You know your
[1:07:58] childish foolishness. You have to put it
[1:08:00] away yourself and get some sense inside
[1:08:03] your head. Get some wisdom, man. You can
[1:08:06] ask God for wisdom. Oh, don't get me
[1:08:08] rocking this morning. Oh, glory to God.
[1:08:10] We got to get inheritance. We got to get
[1:08:12] abortion. If your mother fail you, don't
[1:08:14] fail your children. If your father fail
[1:08:16] you, don't fail your sons. Oh, give the
[1:08:18] Lord a shout in the house. No excuses.
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:31] For every excuse you make and somebody
[1:08:33] who succeed under worse condition than
[1:08:34] you.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; For every excuse you make the man who
[1:08:38] complain he have no shoes
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; but then he stop complain when he saw
[1:08:42] somebody with no feet.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; At least he have foot you could walk.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; So a lot of things are viewpoints
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; how you choose to see how you want to
[1:08:52] see.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; We have to put away child things see.
[1:08:55] Amen. Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us be
[1:08:59] glad and rejoice and give honor to him."
[1:09:02] Am I too rough?
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; I hope not.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Don't think I don't talk to my children
[1:09:11] like this. You forgive me. Isaac is
[1:09:13] quite different. Okay. So, let us be
[1:09:16] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:09:19] for the Let me pause a little bit. The
[1:09:22] reason why I speak like this many times
[1:09:24] is because I challenge your trinat
[1:09:27] spirit.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; I told the ministers in ministers
[1:09:29] meeting I said you cannot even get to
[1:09:31] the Holy Ghost if they can't get to
[1:09:32] train that spirit.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; German have spirit, American have
[1:09:35] spirit, France has spirit's a spirit.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; The country have a spirit in it and that
[1:09:39] is not the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of the country.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You have to bust that. You have to get
[1:09:44] out of that crab and caroo gospel. Stand
[1:09:47] by ba by the side gospel. You have to
[1:09:50] get out of that.
[1:09:51] All you want is the word. Give me the
[1:09:54] word because the word is God and the
[1:09:56] word is what will transform you.
[1:10:00] [Applause]
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear no excuse father in
[1:10:03] a day for me. Oh, God is your father.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; I was 17 years old when I was reading
[1:10:07] Proverbs. A young man, watch your life.
[1:10:10] Watch them women out there. Watch this.
[1:10:11] Watch that. That was my father. My
[1:10:13] father was God the word. My father died
[1:10:16] and gone already. But my father was God
[1:10:18] the word. Praise God. Let the word be a
[1:10:20] lamp unto your feet and a light unto a
[1:10:23] path. How can a young man cleanse his
[1:10:25] way but taketh heed according to the
[1:10:27] word? Give the Lord a shout.
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about my life in my early
[1:10:43] years going to ministry education
[1:10:45] working there. The first thing when I go
[1:10:47] on a job or department tell I'm a
[1:10:48] Christian.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; First thing
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; you make an impact I'm a Christian. You
[1:10:53] know why I said that? Because I wanted
[1:10:55] them to know what side I'm on.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; And I wanted to be accountable to all
[1:10:59] who are around me.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; So I ain't playing no shady games
[1:11:02] because they see me smoking. But he
[1:11:04] Christian.
[1:11:09] I used to tell him my friend
[1:11:14] time one of the girls in work push move
[1:11:16] I show him my ring
[1:11:19] this time I die nothing
[1:11:24] I said call my wife precious
[1:11:28] I say I have precious home
[1:11:31] I have a Mercedes Ben's home they come
[1:11:34] with the old car like I have a Ben's
[1:11:39] I wanted them to know where I stood.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; You have to be able to do that.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; So, put me in the desert. Put me in a
[1:11:49] mountain. Put me in snow. It doesn't
[1:11:52] matter. I'm a son of God. You are
[1:11:55] daughter of God. You have to be able to
[1:11:58] stand. Friend or no friend, wife or no
[1:12:03] wife, boyfriend or no boyfriend,
[1:12:06] girlfriend or no girlfriend, church or
[1:12:09] no church, you have to be able to stand.
[1:12:13] It's not man you're serving, it's God
[1:12:15] you're serving.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I had a girlfriend when I came to the
[1:12:23] Lord. You know, I wasn't working on
[1:12:25] myself. I found a good friend and when
[1:12:27] the gospel come to me I rested down very
[1:12:29] gently
[1:12:32] because I couldn't handle the minuscule
[1:12:34] the lipstick my taste change
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I didn't do like Terry he had a
[1:12:42] girlfriend too when he come to the Lord
[1:12:45] when she come she say she Satan I'm not
[1:12:50] there
[1:12:53] outright Yes,
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; at least I did it differently.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; But when you give your heart to God
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; and you want to truly serve the Lord,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; it's a whole different thing all
[1:13:06] together
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; because I recognize there's something
[1:13:10] supernatural
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; that is looking over my life. There is
[1:13:14] super something supernatural that is
[1:13:16] influencing and guiding me. Why should I
[1:13:18] give up that? Why should I let that go?
[1:13:21] God told them the land that they're
[1:13:24] going through is not like Egypt. The
[1:13:26] land that is going through it have
[1:13:27] hills, it have valleys, it have rain.
[1:13:30] You have to plant your seed. Oh, and I
[1:13:32] will send you rain. If you listen to
[1:13:34] what I tell you, God going to bless you
[1:13:36] abundantly. He'll bless you in the
[1:13:38] north. He'll bless you in your south. He
[1:13:41] bless you when you're going out. He'll
[1:13:42] bless you when you're coming in. Give
[1:13:44] the Lord a shout. You shall be like a
[1:13:46] tree planted by the rivers of water.
[1:13:52] God said so.
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Revelation 19:7. Let us be glad and
[1:14:06] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:14:09] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[1:14:10] wife had made herself ready.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And that we know that there's going to
[1:14:14] be a bride. There's going to be a
[1:14:15] wedding supper serve in disguise. that's
[1:14:17] just as sure to be as God is because it
[1:14:20] is his word. And we know that those that
[1:14:23] are going to make up that bride is going
[1:14:25] to be in his church and they are going
[1:14:27] to appear before him without spot or
[1:14:29] wrinkle. Now hear the bomb. And they
[1:14:33] have the material on earth now to make
[1:14:37] themselves ready.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; If you notice it said she has made
[1:14:43] herself ready.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; That come like a student. All the
[1:14:46] students have books, textbooks.
[1:14:49] They have teachers that's teaching them.
[1:14:53] But all that teaching is down to an exam
[1:14:55] room.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; It's not to say going to school or
[1:14:57] passing through the system. All the
[1:14:59] teaching is to get you to exam room.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Same thing with if you're learning to be
[1:15:03] a doctor or a lawyer. You have teaching.
[1:15:05] It's a thing to learn.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; You don't walk up and say give me a
[1:15:08] sticker and put lawyer on your chest.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; That make you a lawyer because have a
[1:15:11] sticker. You have a mouth saying that
[1:15:13] you a lawyer. No, you had to go through
[1:15:14] the process.
[1:15:18] to do what? Get yourself ready for the
[1:15:20] exam.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; But your books are there.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; The text is there.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody had the same books.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; The same list to go and buy.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Some children would apply, some children
[1:15:34] won't. I remember a prayer in moment. A
[1:15:37] man was praying. He said, "Lord God,
[1:15:38] bring back to remembrance what the
[1:15:40] students study. And those who have not
[1:15:41] studied, have mercy. Help them Lord.
[1:15:46] God can't bring back what you have not
[1:15:48] studied.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus said the Holy Ghost will bring
[1:15:51] back to remembrance
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; what I said unto you.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; So if you don't get into the word, what
[1:15:56] will God bring back to you? If you don't
[1:15:59] speak the word to your children, what
[1:16:00] will God bring back to them? The word
[1:16:02] have to come to your mouth. The word is
[1:16:04] 90 even in thy mouth. You have to speak
[1:16:06] it even to yourself. I am going to be
[1:16:09] healed. I'm going to be delivered. You
[1:16:10] have to speak it. You have to claim it.
[1:16:12] You have to exercise that mouth and get
[1:16:14] out that dumb condition where you're
[1:16:17] groping and you're moping and you're
[1:16:19] saying nothing and you're griping and
[1:16:21] you're under pressure and you're not
[1:16:22] going to open your mouth as I claim it.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; It's mine. Don't give the Lord a shout
[1:16:27] in the house. You have to claim what God
[1:16:30] say is yours.
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; I read this many times. I'm going to
[1:16:41] read here now.
[1:16:42] But I hope it come across different to
[1:16:43] you this morning.
[1:16:45] So many say if the Lord will take this
[1:16:48] evil spirit from me from drinking or
[1:16:51] from gambling or from lying or stealing,
[1:16:55] I will serve him. But that's up to you.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; See, you have got to do something, too.
[1:17:01] They that overcome shall inherit all
[1:17:03] things. They that overcome, you have
[1:17:05] power to do it, but you must be willing
[1:17:08] to lay it down. She has made herself
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; ready.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Friends, there is always a better way.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; But I realize there are people who don't
[1:17:20] live what I call examined lives.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; They don't look back to see the path
[1:17:24] they have taken, the choices they have
[1:17:27] made, the words that came out their lips
[1:17:29] and therefore they they live with
[1:17:31] consequences.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; You guys preached many of times.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; They are called secondary consequences.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Decisions are made. So Lot pitch his
[1:17:38] tense up about Sodom. He could have
[1:17:40] handled Sodom. Not his wife,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; not his children,
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; not his family,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; there are things you could deal with,
[1:17:47] but that doesn't mean others in your
[1:17:49] family could deal with that.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And that way many pastors don't
[1:17:53] understand. They lose the lips of the
[1:17:54] congregation. Tell them all kind of
[1:17:56] things. But there are people that cannot
[1:17:58] handle it.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And these people become dangerous
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; with their mouths
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; and their disrespects.
[1:18:09] Hallelujah.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; You see, God could not push us through a
[1:18:14] little pipe and pull us out the other
[1:18:17] end and say, "Blessed is he that
[1:18:19] overcome it."
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; You had nothing to overcome.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; He just pushed you through. But you have
[1:18:25] got to make decisions for yourself.
[1:18:28] Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; There's a ministry here that God place
[1:18:31] here
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; that give you an opportunity to access
[1:18:36] divine communication and inspiration and
[1:18:38] guidance and prayer.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't want me in your
[1:18:40] business, that's okay. But at least they
[1:18:42] could solicit prayer
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; for the business instead of you failing
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; because you powering yourself.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; I hope that means something to you
[1:18:53] sitting here.
[1:18:55] I have nothing to do with I I I I don't
[1:18:57] want to disturb the pastor. You know, he
[1:19:00] busy.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; That is none of your business if you
[1:19:02] busy. Your business is to disturb him.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; If you are fellowshipping here and a
[1:19:06] believer here, your business is to get
[1:19:08] help.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Your business is to get intervention.
[1:19:11] When when when when Morai tell Queen
[1:19:14] Esther, if you think because you're
[1:19:16] queen and you're behind that desk there
[1:19:18] or on that throne there, you wouldn't
[1:19:20] get affected. You're wrong.
[1:19:22] How do you not know for such a time as
[1:19:24] this you were raised up? When she
[1:19:26] recognized the gravity of the hour that
[1:19:28] her people was about to be destroyed,
[1:19:30] she said, "Fast, fast. I am going to
[1:19:32] fast. My maids are going to fast. You
[1:19:34] fast for me because I'm going into the
[1:19:36] presence of the king and if I perish, I
[1:19:38] perish." She was prepared to push
[1:19:40] further. She was a prayer to step out
[1:19:43] against her own hurt to get deliverance
[1:19:46] for her people. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:19:48] shout in the house. What would you do to
[1:19:50] see a family breakthrough? What would
[1:19:52] you do? What are you prepared to do?
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; There was fasting and praying.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; But she was under instructions and
[1:20:08] guidance of Morai.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; She had a tutor. She had a governor.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; She had somebody. And we have the Holy
[1:20:12] Spirit here. Not just the Holy Spirit
[1:20:14] for you personal, but there's a ministry
[1:20:16] here.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; To help you.
[1:20:18] and to become a blessing to you.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; If you are willing to hear, listen, and
[1:20:23] obey. But some people don't want to
[1:20:25] bring nothing because they want to do
[1:20:26] their own thing.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You are afraid different thing
[1:20:29] altogether.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; All right. So, Abraham was a promised
[1:20:36] child, but here we go. But he must
[1:20:39] maintain this promise for 25 years. The
[1:20:42] ups and downs that he had, the
[1:20:43] temptations in those 25 years, but he
[1:20:45] held on to the promise. And Israel was
[1:20:48] promised a promised land.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; But they had to fight every inch of it.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; What if God had tell Abraham, Abraham,
[1:20:54] you have a child, you know, but it's
[1:20:54] like 25 years.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Then Abraham hitting all the bars in the
[1:20:58] country and all the feds.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And in 24 years, Abraham 24 years, he
[1:21:02] dripping in the church. Hallelujah.
[1:21:03] Glory, glory, glory.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible couldn't talk about Abram
[1:21:07] stacking at the promise of God.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; But God never tell him how long.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Believe this thing." And for
[1:21:13] 25 years, he held on. So therefore,
[1:21:16] Israel was promised a promised land.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; God promised that.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; They didn't ask God for that. God say,
[1:21:22] "I have a land for you."
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; As an inheritance,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; you don't buy an inheritance.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; You don't work for inheritance. You are
[1:21:32] given inheritance. That is what I want
[1:21:34] to get to you this morning. If your
[1:21:36] uncle leave it, your grandfather leave
[1:21:38] it, it is still an inheritance was left
[1:21:41] for you. I don't care if you're drunk,
[1:21:43] you're half crazy. It is still yours.
[1:21:46] Oh, give the Lord a shout. It have
[1:21:47] nothing to do with your worthy. It have
[1:21:49] nothing to do with your sin or fail. It
[1:21:51] is inheritance.
[1:21:53] Preach back to me, somebody. If your
[1:21:55] uncle, father, whoever leave something
[1:21:58] for you. It has nothing to do with who
[1:22:00] you are. Is what has been left for you
[1:22:02] and what is your right to possess. God
[1:22:05] left healing for me, joy, peace,
[1:22:07] longsuffering. But give the Lord a shout
[1:22:09] in this house.
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:20] [Applause]
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:27] Like a years ago, I hear about a man
[1:22:29] drunk but he belong to me back drunk and
[1:22:31] somebody tell her brother's a false
[1:22:34] prophet. He said I might be drunk but I
[1:22:35] ain't stupid.
[1:22:39] I may be back to the man not stupid. God
[1:22:42] send a prophet
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; he knows that
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; all kind of people can be prophets now.
[1:22:48] Prophet this prophet and lying prophets
[1:22:50] you know not one thing they say come to
[1:22:52] pass. You know
[1:22:55] you have a social media prophet now
[1:22:58] he calling your name and tell all about
[1:22:59] you because going now he say believe in
[1:23:01] social media. Who's your brother or
[1:23:02] sister? Oh yes so and so
[1:23:05] and man have tablet there. So your name
[1:23:08] and who's your uncle and who's your
[1:23:09] thing and people think he's doing med
[1:23:12] Facebook prophetic all that.
[1:23:17] Okay. So Israel was given a promised
[1:23:19] land but they had to fight for every
[1:23:21] inch of it. Wherever the souls of your
[1:23:25] foot shall tread upon have I given you.
[1:23:27] You know there's a song on Jordan stormy
[1:23:30] banks I stand and cast a wishful eye to
[1:23:34] Kane and fear. That's when you're using
[1:23:35] losing binoculars and they snapping pine
[1:23:40] on Jordan banks. Yeah. Crossing Jordan
[1:23:43] spoo my go. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But there's something called
[1:23:49] subtext.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Anytime God gives something. Look at the
[1:23:52] fine print.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; God said the land is yours. His promise
[1:23:58] is yours. But there's a subtext.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; There's a fine print. Say every place
[1:24:06] You put
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; your foot
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; is yours.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; If I don't put it, it's not yours.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Do I hear a shout in the house?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Do I hear somebody say amen?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Every place you put your foot is yours.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; It's mine. I claim it.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I own it. It is mine. Put your foot on
[1:24:32] something this morning. Okay. The Lord I
[1:24:35] shout. Where there's healing, whether
[1:24:37] it's breakthrough, whether it's
[1:24:39] deliverance, whether it's revival, where
[1:24:41] is to clear your mind from the trash
[1:24:42] that's inside of you.
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; God said to Joshua, it was all there.
[1:24:55] The land was there. God gave it to them.
[1:24:57] But they must fight for it. The same way
[1:24:58] is about divine healing. God has the
[1:25:00] power to heal you. If you got courage to
[1:25:02] accept it, but you will fight every inch
[1:25:04] of it. God has got amazing grace to save
[1:25:06] you. But he will do it. But you have to
[1:25:08] fight every inch of it that way. I've
[1:25:10] been behind the pulpit for over 31
[1:25:12] years. Every inch has been a fight
[1:25:14] constantly. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; We must lay aside ourselves. Praise God.
[1:25:20] We can't say God come lay them aside for
[1:25:24] us.
[1:25:25] I said that before inspiration here. We
[1:25:28] have got to do that ourselves. That's
[1:25:30] right.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Hear this.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; If Wesley hadn't stepped out on the word
[1:25:36] and got a bad name behind him, called a
[1:25:39] crazy man and everything else, he would
[1:25:41] have never been able to achieve. But
[1:25:44] Wesley was one of God's great
[1:25:45] scientists.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Luther was one of God's great
[1:25:48] scientists. They didn't care what the
[1:25:49] churches said, organizations said.
[1:25:51] Luther didn't care what the Catholics
[1:25:52] said. He just believed that Joshua lived
[1:25:54] by faith. He took God chemicals of the
[1:25:57] word, put it together, and the church
[1:25:58] moved by faith.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Wesley put it together by the blood.
[1:26:01] Prove it was the blood. The Pentecostal
[1:26:03] believe that the bapt Holy Ghost, that's
[1:26:05] the promises to you and to your
[1:26:06] children, and they put the chemicals
[1:26:08] together in the word, and they move into
[1:26:09] the air.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; They moved out because they were able to
[1:26:13] accomplish such.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Now, why did these men do this? Why did
[1:26:18] Luther find it? Why did Wesley find it?
[1:26:21] Why these others? Because the material
[1:26:24] was laying there on earth that could
[1:26:26] make a T- Model Ford.
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He had this bomb.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; There was the electricity that could
[1:26:35] make a car to run.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe he's talking about electric car
[1:26:38] there. This is Bram. There was
[1:26:41] electricity that could make a car to
[1:26:42] run. There was gasoline in the earth.
[1:26:45] There was pistons and so forth. All the
[1:26:46] mechanics. So plane was here when Adam
[1:26:49] was here. Car was here when Adam was
[1:26:51] here. They just didn't discover it yet.
[1:26:54] But all the materials to make car and
[1:26:57] plane and and astronaut was already
[1:26:59] here.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; So the word to prepare us, to change us,
[1:27:03] to transform us, to make us wise virgin,
[1:27:06] it's already here.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:27:10] Hallelujah.
[1:27:12] Nobody have to go up to heaven to bring
[1:27:13] it down because Revelation 10 said, "I
[1:27:15] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:27:18] heaven." But the book no longer closed,
[1:27:20] but the book is now open. We have an
[1:27:23] open book. Praise God. We have an open
[1:27:26] deed. We have an inheritance. It has
[1:27:28] come down on the earth. Glory to God.
[1:27:30] Vindicated by said in Malachi 4, the
[1:27:33] first mature son, the first mature seed,
[1:27:36] but other sons are coming. Oh, give the
[1:27:38] Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah.
[1:27:41] Hallelujah. The inheritance will be
[1:27:44] divided.
[1:27:48] Do I shout on that one?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Don't prove sanctification because the
[1:28:05] material is laying there. Did you notice
[1:28:07] those scientific achievements? one
[1:28:09] higher than the other. The automobile
[1:28:11] was higher than the horse
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; and the airplane was higher than the
[1:28:14] transportation of the automobile.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Horse power. If that's horsepower, what
[1:28:18] about God's power? What about Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] power? The Holy Ghost power that can
[1:28:22] justify you. The same Holy Ghost that
[1:28:23] can sanctify you is the same Holy Ghost
[1:28:24] that can sanctify you can fill you with
[1:28:26] his presence up and up and up. The same
[1:28:29] Holy Ghost that justify the Lutherans,
[1:28:31] that sanctify the Wesleyians, that
[1:28:33] baptize the Pentecostals, is now setting
[1:28:35] in order. The coming of the Lord, that
[1:28:38] same Holy Ghost, not a different Holy
[1:28:40] Ghost, the same Holy Ghost working in
[1:28:42] unfolding power right now. The Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost is unfolding by his word to you
[1:28:46] right now, this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:28:48] Hallelujah.
[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; What's your objective this morning in
[1:28:55] preaching what you're preaching this
[1:28:56] morning? By the way, I'll tell you. My
[1:28:58] objective this morning is that each one
[1:29:01] of you will come to the place where with
[1:29:04] your mouth you can say give me
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; this mountain
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; or my mountain.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You see if you're back in a condition
[1:29:14] you can't say that. You would have the
[1:29:15] faith to do that. You take faith to do
[1:29:16] that. You know
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; listen Joshua Caleb didn't wait for the
[1:29:20] crowd of believers and people all around
[1:29:22] and look at who saying it first are shy.
[1:29:25] All that foolishness have to go out of
[1:29:26] your system. You have to know because
[1:29:29] you only can have faith for what's
[1:29:30] revealed to you as your own. That is
[1:29:32] what revelation is about. When God
[1:29:34] reveals to you this is yours, you say,
[1:29:36] "Wait, wait a minute. It is me." God
[1:29:38] talking to somebody else. He is speaking
[1:29:40] to you.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Someone listen to me.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; So when it's revealed to you, it's
[1:29:48] yours.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; I remember doing the government exams
[1:29:53] and failing, failing, failing. How about
[1:29:55] for clap one and something like that.
[1:29:58] and people studying hard and thing like
[1:30:00] that. One of the days I get re I go and
[1:30:01] pass that you know and I went I had
[1:30:04] faith I had confidence and I pass the
[1:30:06] thing
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; and guess what I didn't study half of
[1:30:08] what study but guess what what I study
[1:30:10] come
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; figure that one out
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; just what I study is what come
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; you can't explain those things people
[1:30:16] for all kind of thing to study
[1:30:18] everything that I study come by the
[1:30:20] revelation I'm going to pass that thing
[1:30:22] praise God I'm telling you red sea in
[1:30:24] front of you mountains on both sides
[1:30:26] pharaoh behind you we going to pass this
[1:30:28] thing okay the Lord A shout in the
[1:30:30] house.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; He has done it before. He could do it
[1:30:36] again.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Let me say it good. He has done it
[1:30:41] before, he could do it again. What he
[1:30:44] have done for others, he could do for
[1:30:46] you. Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:30:49] What he has done for others, he can do
[1:30:51] for you.
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:03] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses, so I be with you.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Although if I'm trying and I fail, God
[1:31:12] won't leave me.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; If I'm trying and I fail, God won't
[1:31:20] leave me. I don't have much confidence
[1:31:23] in anybody who's afraid to do anything.
[1:31:26] I rather be from a failure than too lazy
[1:31:28] to try.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; I want to read this script from Hebrews
[1:31:31] 3 verse 7. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost
[1:31:34] said, today if you hear his voice, had
[1:31:36] not your hearts as in the provocation in
[1:31:39] the day of temptation of the wilderness
[1:31:40] when your fathers tempted me and proved
[1:31:42] me and so my works 40 years. This is God
[1:31:44] speaking. Wherefore I was grieved with
[1:31:47] that generation and said they do always
[1:31:50] error in their heart for they have not
[1:31:52] known my ways. How much time I keep
[1:31:54] telling you that when they came out of
[1:31:55] Egypt, they came out of Egypt based upon
[1:31:57] the power that Moses had to demonstrate
[1:32:00] God to the to Pharaoh. They didn't know
[1:32:03] who that God was. So he was calling them
[1:32:05] out of Egypt to bring them to the
[1:32:07] mountain that God could share with them
[1:32:09] his ways,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; his words. Because you can't please God
[1:32:13] if you don't know what pleases God. If
[1:32:16] you don't know what pleases me, you
[1:32:17] can't do and do you don't know. So it
[1:32:19] has to be revealed. So the revelation of
[1:32:21] God didn't come to them yet. He said
[1:32:23] bring them to this mountain. When Moses
[1:32:25] went to get revelation them having
[1:32:27] connival man and they carrying on with
[1:32:28] the foolishness making golden calf and
[1:32:31] all kind of thing like that. When Moses
[1:32:32] come down because them dancing and
[1:32:33] partying and whatnot go to kill half of
[1:32:35] them.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; This is human beings now.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; This still happening now. You know,
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; people still have the golden calf. You
[1:32:43] know,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; it might be a car, might be a wife,
[1:32:44] might be a house, might be their job,
[1:32:46] might be their money. Whatever it is,
[1:32:47] same calf.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You didn't think about that one.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Same calf.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; The pride could be a calf. Big. Oh,
[1:32:56] that's a big one. That's a inside calf.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Ego.
[1:33:01] Lovers of their own self. Anybody have
[1:33:03] that?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; They high on the self.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; They don't even eat marijuana. They
[1:33:09] smoking their own self. The inside
[1:33:10] inside the smoking up inside of there.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Lovers of their own when they look in
[1:33:15] the mirror. So the hand something the
[1:33:17] most beautiful thing I seen for the for
[1:33:19] for the morning.
[1:33:21] Lovers of own self.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; That why they want selfies you know
[1:33:25] clicks clicks.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Some people Facebook things only
[1:33:28] selfies. All kind of nobody else but
[1:33:30] them.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; All right we not here for that.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; When your fathers tempted me and proved
[1:33:37] me and saw my works 40 years. Wherefore
[1:33:39] I was grieved with that generation and I
[1:33:41] that they do always earn their heart.
[1:33:43] They have not always known my ways. So I
[1:33:45] swear in my wrath they shall not enter
[1:33:46] in my rest. They get God so angry God
[1:33:49] say no rest for them
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; which is the land.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; What
[1:33:54] take heed brethren warning least there
[1:33:58] be any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; in departing from the living God. But
[1:34:05] exhort one another daily while it is
[1:34:08] called today, lest any of you be
[1:34:10] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:34:12] sin, that you may be made partakers of
[1:34:14] Christ, if ye hold the beginning of your
[1:34:16] confidence steadfast unto the end. While
[1:34:18] it is said today, if you will hear his
[1:34:20] voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
[1:34:22] provocation. For some, here we go, when
[1:34:24] they had heard, did provoke. How be it
[1:34:27] not all that came out of Egypt by Moses,
[1:34:29] but with whom he was grief 40 years? Was
[1:34:32] it not them that had sinned, whose
[1:34:34] carcasses fell in the wilderness, and to
[1:34:36] whom he swore he would not enter into
[1:34:39] his rest, but to them that believe not?
[1:34:41] So we see, here we go, that they could
[1:34:44] not enter in because of unbelief.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Their own unbelief.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; God didn't put a barrication and say
[1:34:51] don't enter.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; God didn't say a no entry sign for them.
[1:34:54] Their unbelief kept them out.
[1:34:58] Next scripture, the word heard by all of
[1:35:00] them wasn't mixed with faith.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; They perish
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; because they come in the church and
[1:35:05] going back home with no change, with no
[1:35:07] transformation, with no application.
[1:35:09] Church was just a outing. Church was
[1:35:10] just a place to take a time out on a
[1:35:12] Sunday morning for them. Oh, glory to
[1:35:14] God. But they were Joshua and Caleb.
[1:35:16] They were a little different from the
[1:35:18] rest of guys. Oh, glory to God.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When they came
[1:35:22] back, they say, "We are more than able
[1:35:24] to take that man." But the people was
[1:35:26] already under anointing of unbelief,
[1:35:28] under anointing of no praise, under
[1:35:30] anointing of no worship because the
[1:35:32] ministers couldn't handle worship. They
[1:35:34] couldn't handle the shouts. They thought
[1:35:36] we wild and we carried on. But they
[1:35:38] don't understand the praises is what
[1:35:40] brought the blessing. And the praises is
[1:35:42] watering the word. And Abraham staggered
[1:35:45] at the promise of God through unbelief.
[1:35:47] It was strong giving praise to God. And
[1:35:49] there must be a worship of God.
[1:35:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There must be a
[1:35:53] praises going up to him. But they
[1:35:55] rejected that. Oh, glory to God. They
[1:35:57] rejected the worship of King Lamb. Oh,
[1:35:59] give the Lord a shout in the house. They
[1:36:01] rejected the revival to get out your
[1:36:03] stinking flesh and spirit. Oh, give the
[1:36:06] Lord a shout. Oh, glory to God. But
[1:36:10] Psalms 118 says, "The voice of rejoicing
[1:36:13] is in the tablet of the righteous, not
[1:36:15] the voice of no dead dumb saints." Oh,
[1:36:17] give the Lord a shout in the house. The
[1:36:20] voice of rejoicing is in the tablock of
[1:36:22] the righteous. This is the day that the
[1:36:25] Lord hath made. We will rejoice
[1:36:29] and be glad in it. Give the Lord a shout
[1:36:31] in the house.
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:47] There's not another message on the earth
[1:36:49] like this message.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; So when man fell, the original title
[1:36:58] deed went back in the hands of original
[1:37:00] owner. God himself. Adam had the deed to
[1:37:03] the earth. Adam had speaking power,
[1:37:06] dominion power, power to create other
[1:37:08] sons. He had to wait until a further
[1:37:10] revelation. That is where Eve got
[1:37:12] deceived by serpent bringing an
[1:37:14] interpretation. That's how Cain come on
[1:37:17] the scene. But Adam supposed to wait to
[1:37:20] speak from his mouth out of sons. Let
[1:37:22] there be. Let there be. Let there be. He
[1:37:24] was a son under God to speak like God.
[1:37:27] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Adam was have
[1:37:30] a spoken word son. He was a spoken word
[1:37:32] son. Let us make man in our image and
[1:37:35] likeness. Let that man of dominion. So
[1:37:37] God spoke a man into existence by
[1:37:40] spirit. Give the Lord a shout. Then God
[1:37:43] took the dust of the earth and create a
[1:37:45] physical man and put the first man in
[1:37:47] the second man and man became a living
[1:37:50] soul. That's what you're seeing here
[1:37:51] this morning. Oh, praise God. Praise
[1:37:53] God. Praise God. But the book that Adam
[1:37:56] had was lost.
[1:38:00] [Applause]
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Watch.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. God gave and the boots
[1:38:13] out of Eden
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; because he told that son the day you eat
[1:38:17] thereof that day you shall surely die.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he put guards
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; around the tree of life.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; So Adam can partake of eternal life in
[1:38:25] that condition.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; So God protected the tree of life from
[1:38:31] this fallen man
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; and give him the boots and kick him out.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; God will kick you out, you know. Yes.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of grace extended to us
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; that give us this opportunity to serve
[1:38:49] God.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care if your mother is the
[1:38:53] poorest thing inside of here. The father
[1:38:55] is the drunkest thing inside of here.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; The fact that you are here,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; it's a privilege to have them as
[1:38:59] parents.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; However you come, you come. You land.
[1:39:08] But God didn't give up on you.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; God didn't give up on you.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; God looking over your life.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You must think God protect you from.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you're still grumpy and
[1:39:20] hardfaced.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; You know how much think God hedge you
[1:39:22] from.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Things that seen and unseen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; You know devil try to pull you down to
[1:39:27] his pit
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; and angels fighting for you.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God, don't
[1:39:31] get me started this morning.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you know your life is
[1:39:35] interrupted by angels?
[1:39:38] [Applause]
[1:39:42] Glory.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; So when time for redemption
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; angel crying
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; who is worthy said take the book
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; John weeping
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; John crying holy ghost felt man weeping
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; because no man was found worthy looking
[1:39:59] for man
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; under the earth above the earth all them
[1:40:01] angel was worthy but no man had to be a
[1:40:03] man.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No man was found worthy.
[1:40:06] People don't understand Jesus died not
[1:40:08] to save us.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Not just to save us. He died to get the
[1:40:10] book
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; because this book t this book tied to
[1:40:16] Genesis. This book tied to the original
[1:40:19] man
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; that God made in the garden of Eden. And
[1:40:22] if God had to bring us back before the
[1:40:24] fall, to bring us back to have the
[1:40:25] Adamic nature, what Adam had before the
[1:40:28] fall, he has to bring back the book. And
[1:40:31] the book was sealed in heaven. Somebody
[1:40:33] had to bring it down. Before they bring
[1:40:35] it down, somebody to take it. No man was
[1:40:39] worthy. So when Jesus died, he was the
[1:40:41] worthy lamb. He went and took the book.
[1:40:44] He didn't ask for it. He took the book.
[1:40:47] Well, give the Lord a shout. He didn't
[1:40:50] ask for the book. He took the book. Oh,
[1:40:53] glory to God. And he said, "I claim
[1:40:55] them. I claim them. I claim them in
[1:40:58] Trinidad. I claim you. He claim your
[1:41:02] soul. He claim your spirit. He claim
[1:41:05] your body.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:13] [Applause]
[1:41:15] Ah,
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; that's why Job by inspiration
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; and by revelation he could say this do
[1:41:28] the skinw worms
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; destroy my body.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; This the skinworms have a legitimate
[1:41:33] right. to work in your body.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Though the skin worms destroy
[1:41:38] my body yet in my flesh." What is Job
[1:41:41] saying there? Job is saying, "I'll be
[1:41:42] transformed. I'll be resurrected."
[1:41:45] Nothing can stop that. Though the skin
[1:41:47] worm destroy my body, yet in my flesh, I
[1:41:51] shall see God for myself.
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:42:04] Woo! Help me Jesus.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Now watch. The title deed of redemption
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; of all creation
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; is in his hand.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; He come to claim it back for the human
[1:42:16] race.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Not claim it back to angels. Claim it
[1:42:20] back to the human
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; which it was given for
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; to make sons and daughters again.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; So this book
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; is what going to make sons. That is why
[1:42:33] when Jesus came the first gospel he
[1:42:35] preached you must be born again
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; of the word
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; and of the spirit.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; A man ask shall we enter back in the
[1:42:43] mother's womb? He said that flesh thing
[1:42:45] we not talking about that you have no
[1:42:47] revelation. I am talking about the word
[1:42:49] coming into you and the spirit coming
[1:42:51] into the word in you and turn into power
[1:42:54] and you are born back again a spirit man
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; image of God
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; in seed form.
[1:43:02] Oh, the Lord I shout in the house.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Come on now. This this is the message,
[1:43:08] you know.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; This is the message of Yahweh. And to
[1:43:12] that seed of faith, you add virtue, you
[1:43:15] add knowledge, you add temperance, you
[1:43:18] add patience, you add godliness, you add
[1:43:20] brotherly kindness, and the love of God
[1:43:22] will come down the bond of perfectness,
[1:43:25] and you're back to Eden again.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Okay, the Lord, I shout in the house.
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:38] The bull test coming.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; The bull test is coming.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; You remember the bull.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Bull, I'm sorry to disturb
[1:43:49] you. Go back and lie down."
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; He couldn't tell the bull about seals
[1:43:56] and vials and woes and the mystery of
[1:43:58] Russia and Ukraine. and who the
[1:44:01] president Mr. tariff is in America
[1:44:04] there.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; He couldn't tell the bull that you know
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; the bull only understand one language,
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; language of love.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And he had to have it to give it.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; He said he forgot his gun at the gate.
[1:44:17] If he had remembered the gun, he was to
[1:44:19] take the gun and shoot the bull and pay
[1:44:21] for the bull.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; That's easy.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; But God didn't want this to be the
[1:44:25] normal routine thing where you bust
[1:44:27] bullet and pay.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; God make sure the gun is not there. to
[1:44:32] make sure he's helpless.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; To make sure he's defenseless,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; to make sure he have to rest and punch
[1:44:38] something, something come over him.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; He said he can't explain it. He felt a
[1:44:43] love for the animal.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; He couldn't explain it.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; That is a bull. You know,
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; it had to get me close to that dog bull.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; He said he felt no fear.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; What does the word say?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Perfect love.
[1:45:02] cast it out
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; all fear.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; He felt no fear.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Love was there
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; and love stopped the bull in his tracks.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Make the bull turn around. That was back
[1:45:14] in the garden of Eden. Bull go and lie
[1:45:17] down. Lie and hush him out. Roar later
[1:45:20] this evening. I don't want to hear no
[1:45:23] morning raw. Give me a evening raw. Go
[1:45:25] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:45:34] Don't tell me this message don't have
[1:45:36] power.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me this word don't have
[1:45:38] power.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; This have plenty power inside of it. The
[1:45:41] devil want to make you think it have no
[1:45:43] power. But it have power to change you.
[1:45:45] It power to transform your walk and your
[1:45:48] talk and your attitude. This is what
[1:45:50] this is about. To change your thinking,
[1:45:53] to make you stretch a little bit, to
[1:45:55] push a little bit, to press a little
[1:45:57] bit. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; You have to push yourself.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; That's what we talk about on Wednesday
[1:46:08] tonight meeting.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; If you don't push, you wouldn't get
[1:46:12] anywhere.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You don't push to pray, you'll just say
[1:46:21] morning Lord, evening Lord in Jesus
[1:46:22] name. Amen.
[1:46:25] Guys, more than the time you taking to
[1:46:27] watch your Facebook or WhatsApp or some
[1:46:29] Tik Tok nonsense that they send for you
[1:46:30] to look and kill your time with that.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; They say all these short videos and
[1:46:36] whatn not making people have short
[1:46:37] attention span.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Now sure find things so boring.
[1:46:41] Everything is push whoo whoo whoo whoo
[1:46:43] whoosh whoosh. And God will have no
[1:46:45] instant food, instant faith, instant
[1:46:47] patience, instant heat. Not any instant
[1:46:49] business, instant coffee, instant tea,
[1:46:50] instant this. Just some people want
[1:46:52] something instant just a packing and
[1:46:54] then they go make food.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You want getting lazier and lazier you
[1:47:02] know
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; because man making things make it easy.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Why you think people getting problem for
[1:47:10] exercise now? They're not walking enough
[1:47:12] in front of the house.
[1:47:16] All park this distance you know if I
[1:47:19] said people chance they park straight
[1:47:21] into inside price they drive straight
[1:47:22] inside
[1:47:26] people to get the nearest park
[1:47:28] foolishness just to walk is that 5
[1:47:31] minutes walk 2 minutes walk
[1:47:35] human being all right so watch so this
[1:47:40] word is to actually make sons and
[1:47:41] daughters again so we cannot say get
[1:47:44] away from the word itself here What the
[1:47:46] Bible says, as many as receive him,
[1:47:49] who's him? The word to them give you
[1:47:51] power,
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; to become,
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; not instant sons.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Power to become sons.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; So God give you power to start you
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; into sunship.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Now this power to become means that
[1:48:04] you're under tutors and governors to be
[1:48:06] trained
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; to be disciplined to be guided.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Discipline is a word young people now
[1:48:11] don't like to hear, but it's still part
[1:48:12] of God's package. Hallelujah.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Because the young man who said, "Father,
[1:48:15] give me all my money. I want to go now.
[1:48:17] I wait till you're dead to get
[1:48:18] inheritance. Give it now."
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; He thought he was mature
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; to manage what he had to get.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; The father he give him.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; He know he's not ready.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; But he give him anyhow.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; He buy fancy car, red car, he have
[1:48:32] friends, all the pizza, all the Chinese
[1:48:34] food and all the fast food and whatnot.
[1:48:36] He want to country the car text call
[1:48:38] him. He making sure there's no
[1:48:40] accountability to his behavior. So he's
[1:48:42] away from church eyes,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; deacon eyes, elders eyes, everybody
[1:48:45] eyes, pastor eyes. He's away and he
[1:48:48] doing his own thing.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Until his money run out. When the money
[1:48:51] out, his friends run out. He didn't know
[1:48:53] he had only had money friends, food
[1:48:56] friends,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; pleasure friends.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And then as I say already, they thought
[1:49:02] he was living in the white house in
[1:49:03] front. He live in the band behind the
[1:49:04] house. But the entrance was through the
[1:49:06] white house. So they could hallelujah.
[1:49:08] Glory.
[1:49:10] They may see when he spinning around
[1:49:11] when the back of the band there
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; and for a while he didn't pick food. He
[1:49:16] ain't say nothing. You know what I mean?
[1:49:17] I'm going through hard times. I want to
[1:49:19] confess. I want to tell anybody through
[1:49:20] hard times. So when he recognize he
[1:49:23] sharing food with the pig, he say, "Oh
[1:49:26] God, oh God, oh God." His mind said a
[1:49:28] thing back in his father's house. He
[1:49:30] said, "Oh God, oh God, oh God." Every
[1:49:31] day he Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.
[1:49:33] Oh god.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; He ain't ready yet. He said to pray yet
[1:49:36] now. Listen, you have one day that food
[1:49:38] was tasting so terrible. You say, "Oh,
[1:49:39] God. Oh God, this last time I'll arise.
[1:49:42] I go to my father. I say, I've sinned
[1:49:43] against thee. Let me be a servant." Yes.
[1:49:45] I go wash the dishes. I I sweep the
[1:49:48] yard. I
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I'll clean the fountain pen, the pig
[1:49:51] pen. I'll clean any pen you have down
[1:49:52] there.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; I tell the last time his friends see
[1:49:56] him, last time they see him behind the
[1:49:57] house. He's had a truck home, no car, no
[1:50:01] walk. And every evening his father
[1:50:03] looking out for him
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; because the father knew that behavior
[1:50:07] had to come back in him.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; He man ready yet.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; So every day looking out for his son
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; and one day but Anthony he see that walk
[1:50:15] in there.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; He said he coming back in a distance
[1:50:18] there he coming back. He said kill the
[1:50:19] fatted calf.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Get the robe.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Get some relief you have
[1:50:23] outside there. Get some herbs. Get some
[1:50:26] seasoning. Start to prepare that thing
[1:50:28] there man. Get some music. We can't just
[1:50:30] have this dead thing come here. Dead,
[1:50:31] dead, dead. All these churches dead,
[1:50:33] dead, dead, dead, dead. All you have is
[1:50:34] special, special. The people can
[1:50:35] worship. Don't sing and clap like it's a
[1:50:37] concert. Praise God. We don't want that.
[1:50:38] We want you to worship. Every man in
[1:50:40] here supposed to worship. Everybody
[1:50:42] supposed to open their mouth. Give the
[1:50:43] Lord a shout in the house.
[1:50:46] Make some Holy Ghost noise.
[1:50:49] Let them think we are crazy.
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:50:57] Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] Hallelujah.
[1:51:00] You think I care about what anybody else
[1:51:02] think in the message? Not a bit of it.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I care about producing a
[1:51:10] revival. He said what we see should make
[1:51:12] a church that should make a revival that
[1:51:15] people will find from everywhere that
[1:51:17] will say the seven thunders that are not
[1:51:19] written is manifested.
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:23] That's the burden I have on me. Oh give
[1:51:26] the Lord a shout. The Lord had chasened
[1:51:29] me sore, but he hath not or given me
[1:51:31] over unto death. Open to me the gates of
[1:51:34] righteousness, and I shall enter in. The
[1:51:37] stone that the pillars refused has
[1:51:40] become the headstone of the corner. The
[1:51:42] Bible said, "This is the Lord's doing."
[1:51:44] And it's marvelous in our eyes. This is
[1:51:47] the day that the Lord had made.
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:50] [Applause]
[1:51:57] be seated.
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Let me let me tell you one time. You
[1:52:03] will shout before the walls of Jericho
[1:52:06] fall down.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; If you think you're watching the walls
[1:52:10] to fall down and then you're going to
[1:52:11] shout, God will make you wait.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Wars around your life, the walls around
[1:52:15] your family life.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Joshua, tell them when I bid you to
[1:52:20] shout,
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; then shout. Seven days silence, not a
[1:52:25] noise.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Don't feel led to shout nothing. Wait
[1:52:29] till they tell you to shout.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Follow instructions, not your emotions.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; They walk on Jericho once, twice, twice.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; The last day, seven times.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Jero inside know something chang
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; the first time they say you're going
[1:52:44] back home. Then next round you can't say
[1:52:47] you're tired.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Yeah. Amen.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; On that day, that last day,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; your first rounds,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; second rounds, you never to deliverance,
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; you never to break through, you never to
[1:52:59] inheritance. God tell them, "Take
[1:53:01] Jericho." Not only that, God tell them,
[1:53:03] "I have already given you Jericho."
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; You just have to take it now.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; It's already given into your hands.
[1:53:11] Healing is given to you. Deliverance
[1:53:14] given to you. Hallelujah. Joy given to
[1:53:17] you. Anointing given to you. the
[1:53:19] blessings released to you. Let's take it
[1:53:21] this morning.
[1:53:24] Hallelujah.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; When they shout the walls, I don't know
[1:53:31] what in the shout
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; the Lord himself said with a shout.
[1:53:34] There's something there something about
[1:53:35] a shout. You know,
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; a loud noise and the walls came tumbling
[1:53:40] down.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; They were trembling before the walls
[1:53:42] come down
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; because they heard the report
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; of what God did
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; with Israel. And the Bible script, the
[1:53:48] story read, God shall send the fear of
[1:53:50] you
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; to all the nations,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; all your enemies. They're going to hear
[1:53:55] about what God is doing in your life.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; This is who he think the devil believe
[1:54:00] you about to say anything. No. The devil
[1:54:02] didn't even know who Jesus was. If thou
[1:54:04] be, if thou be, if thou be, you too
[1:54:07] small, you too this, you too that, you
[1:54:09] so sidden, you so backsitten, you this,
[1:54:11] whatever, whatever you want to say,
[1:54:12] that's his business.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; He has no inheritance to get. He has no
[1:54:16] access to the book. When he try to
[1:54:18] access it, it mark access denied. He
[1:54:21] can't access this open book. This book
[1:54:23] is for the bride. He said, "Go to the
[1:54:25] angel and say give me don't give me."
[1:54:30] And we took the book. He said, "I took
[1:54:32] the book and I prophesy." And if you
[1:54:35] took the book, if you take the book,
[1:54:37] you're going to prophesy of your
[1:54:38] healing. You're going to prophesy of
[1:54:40] deliverance. You're going to prophesy of
[1:54:41] your breakthrough. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:54:43] shout. Before you curse yourself or neg
[1:54:45] yourself, prophesy before you blame
[1:54:48] yourself, prophesy. Oh, give the Lord
[1:54:50] some praises.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Look at the power of love and the power
[1:54:57] of grace. That son who spend all his
[1:55:00] money, who live a want life, fooling
[1:55:02] around with with whatever he fooling
[1:55:03] around with, when he's coming home, his
[1:55:06] father already make preparation from
[1:55:07] him.
[1:55:08] He repent to his father and his father
[1:55:10] say, "Son, love." Lov give him a good
[1:55:13] hug and welcome him inside.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; He's feeling embarrassed and shamed, but
[1:55:17] he know he's loved.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; The father didn't accuse him. As far as
[1:55:22] the father concerned, he was lost.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Now he's found.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; His older brother who never spent a bad
[1:55:28] scent, have all the money lo.
[1:55:35] Come and hear music. He say, "Where is
[1:55:36] that?" He said, "Brother, come home
[1:55:37] now." And guess what? They killed the
[1:55:39] fatted calf. He said, "Nah,
[1:55:41] how much grass he been for that fatty
[1:55:42] calf?" The Bible described as a fatted
[1:55:45] calf. There was no normal calf
[1:55:46] scrunching and and skinny and what you
[1:55:49] know. This calf is sized up, beefed up
[1:55:52] like you went to the gym. Then
[1:55:56] there's a fullbodied calf.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the son
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; that outside that that older brother he
[1:56:04] upset
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; because his brother who come back get
[1:56:07] some beef
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; cook
[1:56:13] have him he said not I'm not coming
[1:56:15] inside the father say son
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; watch this all that I have is yours
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; watch this
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; the inheritance belong to him
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; that son is firstborn
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; that was his younger was playing the
[1:56:30] fool.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; All that have is yours and he blind like
[1:56:33] a bat.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; He has no revelation, brother Steven,
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; that all that is his own.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; If he had revelation, he was going to
[1:56:40] rejoice
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; that his younger brother come back.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; But he was in his human spirit. Blind as
[1:56:45] a bat. No revelation that the book is
[1:56:48] open and inheritance belong to him. Oh,
[1:56:51] give the Lord a shout. That mean people
[1:56:53] could be in the message blind like a
[1:56:55] bat. Mother kangali no revelation that
[1:56:58] revival belongs to them. Holy Ghost is
[1:57:01] mine. Power is mine. Deliverance that's
[1:57:04] mine too. Oh, glory to God. You got to
[1:57:07] get a revelation.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; So I guess when the father tell him all
[1:57:17] of that if he comforted it come inside.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; But expose his spirit.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go.
[1:57:26] We going good. Our 14 pages which is
[1:57:29] which is nothing much. Normally on
[1:57:30] Wednesday night is about hour preaching
[1:57:31] at 12. This is 14 pages but so my preach
[1:57:33] page five. So it might look like we
[1:57:35] might be 5:00 this evening but we only
[1:57:38] having one service this morning. We
[1:57:39] didn't tell you if you're joining up to
[1:57:40] the evening service. We only have one
[1:57:42] service.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; All right. What a brother.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Someone paid a price that I couldn't
[1:57:48] pay.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; He did it for me. Now, I want you to
[1:57:52] take it personal.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying here now,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to take it to your heart.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Someone paid a price I couldn't pay.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; He did it for me, Charlie. He did it for
[1:58:01] you. He did it for the whole human race.
[1:58:03] And now he comes forth to claim his
[1:58:06] redemptive rights.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Imagine Jesus had to claim.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Claim it for who? Not for himself. For
[1:58:15] us.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He is one of us.
[1:58:18] He was He's our kins folk.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; He's my brother.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; He's my savior.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; He's my God.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; He's my kingsman redeemer.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; He's all what I was I without him. What
[1:58:31] could I be without him?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; So he is standing there.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; The promise is yours. But you'll have to
[1:58:36] fight for every inch you claim.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; The devil will see to that.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; He certainly will.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; What are you doing, Lord?
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; What do they do in Canaan? They were
[1:58:48] possessing their rights.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Glory."
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; They were possessing their rights and
[1:58:54] they could not possess their rights till
[1:58:57] they get into Canaan.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; So the journey is not your land.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; The wilderness is not your land.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; You can't claim desert.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; The journey have no deed in it.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; And people falling out in the journey.
[1:59:15] The journey was from Egypt to Canaan
[1:59:17] land.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; In Canaan land was the land of promise.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; From Egypt to Canaan is the journey.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you in the journey,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; but you're on your way to Canaan land.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Canaan land is the land of the Holy
[1:59:31] Ghost.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Canaan land is a land of promise.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; They own nothing in the wilderness. When
[1:59:40] they come into Canaan, they had rights.
[1:59:43] And we have got rights.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, you're
[1:59:46] in Kenan.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; You have to fight for it. Every inch of
[1:59:49] ground, you have to fight for it.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That's the reason people say, "Baby
[1:59:52] Brandham, you pray for me." Get over in
[1:59:53] Canaan at once, brother, and you'll
[1:59:55] realize where you belong.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Watch prayer start things over yonder.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look here, Satan, this is
[1:59:59] mine."
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; This is where the language begin to
[2:00:02] change.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Changing from you being a believer, I
[2:00:06] believe the message, but you're making
[2:00:08] no claims
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; because you don't feel is yours. you
[2:00:11] don't see is your right and you are
[2:00:14] coward.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Not a amen on that. That not to insult
[2:00:20] you. That's not to make you feel bad.
[2:00:23] But I'm saying it challenges of what we
[2:00:27] really believe.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Or if it's subconscious unbelief
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; that is affecting us from stepping
[2:00:33] forward to claim what God promised in
[2:00:36] his word.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Understand this. He want us to claim it.
[2:00:44] You know he's the high priest of our
[2:00:46] confession.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Do you know you have to confess it first
[2:00:50] before he intercede on behalf of it?
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; He wanted to say by his stripe, I was
[2:00:55] healed
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; before you are healed.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Abraham could lay hold on it. Yet poor
[2:01:08] is starving. Lot took the best ground.
[2:01:11] His water was short. Hot days. His men
[2:01:13] have been in trouble. Everything looked
[2:01:14] like wrong for Abraham. Yet he owned the
[2:01:16] whole thing. He owned the whole thing.
[2:01:18] And today the true believer is cast out
[2:01:20] among the people called fanatic.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Holy ruler. You can't call them people
[2:01:24] in churches hand so fanatic.
[2:01:27] Unless he's called them what call formal
[2:01:29] fanatic.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Formal fanatics. Guys have the message
[2:01:34] right now. Formal fanatic. It's is over
[2:01:36] 30 or 40 years they say now. So amen.
[2:01:39] Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:01:43] And the prophet taught us that wine,
[2:01:46] which is revelation,
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; comes with stimulation.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; So if the people not saying amen and
[2:01:51] praising God and worshiping, it's
[2:01:52] certainly not wine.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; They gain water.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Put Jesus in water into wine.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; So unless they get Jesus,
[2:02:00] but unless Jesus come and turn that
[2:02:02] water into wine,
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; they only sipping water, you know.
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:08] They can't lick their lips with you. No,
[2:02:09] you never see nobody lick their lips
[2:02:10] with water.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody lick their lips with water. But
[2:02:16] they will lick their lips with wine. Ah,
[2:02:18] they smelling good.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Don't go and drink wine now. We talking
[2:02:21] about this wine. See, people start to
[2:02:22] think about wine. We not talking about
[2:02:23] that kind of wine out there, you know.
[2:02:25] We talking about the stimulation of
[2:02:26] revelation, you know. That has get you
[2:02:27] tight. That's get you high. That's get
[2:02:29] you staggering. That's get the preacher
[2:02:31] gypsy a little bit. Praise God. You
[2:02:33] can't be drinking wine and you're just
[2:02:34] dull and you're just dull dull. No, no,
[2:02:36] no. But when them people drinking and
[2:02:38] they talk plenty, you know,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; you see pap said that that's right. But
[2:02:43] know we're talking about
[2:02:45] drinking.
[2:02:47] They always talking, they're smiley,
[2:02:48] they're happy and everything else. That
[2:02:50] is what the gospel supposed to do.
[2:02:52] You're smiley, you're happy, you're glad
[2:02:54] you're Christian, you're glad you're in
[2:02:55] the Christian walk. You're smoking,
[2:02:57] you're saving on cigarette, you're
[2:02:59] saving on licking booze. You're running
[2:03:01] a woman to minor, outside woman, outside
[2:03:03] child. Praise God. And so like that.
[2:03:05] You're living right. You're living good.
[2:03:06] The angels happy. The church happy. You
[2:03:09] happy. Family happy. You're rejoicing in
[2:03:11] God. All things are possible. Not some
[2:03:14] things. All things are possible with
[2:03:16] God. Nothing is impossible. Oh, glory.
[2:03:18] Give the Lord a shout. Nothing is
[2:03:20] impossible with God. But all things are
[2:03:22] possible. He can heal you on the spot.
[2:03:24] He can deliver you on the spot. He can
[2:03:25] fill you on the spot because all things
[2:03:27] are possible to them that believe. Oh,
[2:03:30] give the Lord a shout in the house. What
[2:03:32] do you believe this morning? Do you
[2:03:34] believe he can deliver your son, deliver
[2:03:36] your daughter, deliver your family,
[2:03:37] deliver your wife, your husband, your
[2:03:39] children?
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; You have to work and toil and sweat for
[2:03:54] a few dollars to make honest living to
[2:03:56] put shoes on your children's feet to
[2:03:57] feed a hungry mouth. And yet, you are
[2:03:59] heir to everything.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham could possess the land. What was
[2:04:03] on it, God give it to him. What was a
[2:04:05] part of that land so Abraham had a right
[2:04:07] to it, he could call and lay hold on it.
[2:04:09] Now God, you made me a promise. This
[2:04:10] this is the attitude.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; God, you made me a promise.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Now you have to leave here thinking God
[2:04:16] made me a promise.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And that's was this land all his minds.
[2:04:22] You made a promise. Now my kinsman has
[2:04:24] been taken and all he's got is gone. He
[2:04:26] said, now watch. In other words, if I
[2:04:28] apply that today as your church could
[2:04:30] say, you saying it in modern terms, Lord
[2:04:32] God, here is my brother. He's laying
[2:04:34] here stricken with cancer. He's stricken
[2:04:36] with tuberculosis. He's got so and so. I
[2:04:39] lay hold of the promise. He's telling
[2:04:41] you what you have to say. I lay hold of
[2:04:43] the promise. It is my possession. You
[2:04:47] told me so.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; And then he went after the enemy.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Remember, Abram wasn't a
[2:04:53] fighter man. He didn't train in the gym.
[2:04:55] He just went with what he got and beat
[2:04:56] them
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; and take lot pack out. Go give the Lord
[2:04:59] some praises. You ought to be no fighter
[2:05:01] woman and fighter man, you know. But
[2:05:02] you're coming with faith to believe that
[2:05:04] God will make a way for you. Yet Abraham
[2:05:07] watch had a right to the promise. The
[2:05:09] promise was his. You had to fight to
[2:05:11] possess it. The believer today we are
[2:05:13] heir to all things. We are heir to every
[2:05:16] spiritual blessing.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; That's a good one, right? Hear this one.
[2:05:19] Heir to every physical blessing.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Thhouse, land, money, you name it. We
[2:05:24] are as of physical
[2:05:26] and spiritual. Don't just talk about
[2:05:29] spiritual alone. Physical too. I know we
[2:05:32] don't talk about that. But God could
[2:05:34] bless you till your cup run over until
[2:05:36] your enemy take notice. Hey,
[2:05:41] David said it this way. He prepareest a
[2:05:44] table for me in the presence of my
[2:05:46] enemies. My cup run it over.
[2:05:49] [Applause]
[2:05:56] Oh hallelujah. Feeling good this
[2:05:57] morning. Then David added that surely
[2:06:00] goodness and mercy shall follow me in
[2:06:03] the millennium. No shall follow me all
[2:06:07] the days of my life. I am walking and
[2:06:10] goodness and mercy.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Goodness and mercy. Look it behind me.
[2:06:16] Wherever I go following, look back and
[2:06:19] see goodness. Look back and see mercy.
[2:06:21] Look back and see blessings.
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:26] Everybody inside of here have something
[2:06:29] to praise God about. God, you passed
[2:06:32] through hell, but you're still alive.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. You passed
[2:06:37] through sickness, but you're still
[2:06:38] alive.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; You passed through stress,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; but you're still alive.
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:52] Let's go. We're here at every spiritual
[2:06:54] blessing, every physical blessing, every
[2:06:57] blessing the Bible promises. Yet you
[2:06:59] have to fight every inch of it. That is
[2:07:01] the way God got it set up.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; That why the people like priests
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and they want a message priest
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; and they have them
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; because the people remember they love
[2:07:12] this preacher thing.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; God hate it though. Because God don't
[2:07:17] want no man between him and his people.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; It sounds good for them. They like that
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; the fight for ministry and permanent,
[2:07:26] you know, is till we all come, you know.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; This ministry thing is temporary.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; When we all come.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; So once my sons and they were babies,
[2:07:40] little babies, I shaking them, rocking
[2:07:41] them, burping them, changing them.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; I did that to you know.
[2:07:46] and me train me.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; But the point is this, they didn't stay
[2:07:52] babies all along.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Now they big and they having not babies.
[2:07:58] I ain't going to
[2:08:02] have men that going to be teens just
[2:08:04] now.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is this. The object
[2:08:07] of God is to bring you to maturity.
[2:08:11] That's it.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; When you're mature, you could handle
[2:08:16] stuff.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible teaches this way in
[2:08:20] principle. The subtext, he that is
[2:08:22] faithful in little
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; will be faithful in much.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; God can't drop much in you. He even tell
[2:08:28] them little by little you will take the
[2:08:30] land.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; If you take it in a big way, the thing
[2:08:32] will overtake you.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; You cut, you plant, you grow, you cut,
[2:08:36] you plant, you grow, you cut. You
[2:08:38] cutting, you're cutting. Your big
[2:08:39] tractor going there cutting. when you
[2:08:40] reach down say it's because the devil
[2:08:41] take you the other side that grass and
[2:08:43] go back they in trouble.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; He said little by little.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; So God has give you $100 to see how you
[2:08:51] manage it.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; And never get that the snow cone and
[2:08:54] just wipe you out 10 snow cones.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; You saved none.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; God know if he put more in you is more
[2:09:03] snow cone you buy cuz you love you can't
[2:09:06] see the ice and them colors and thing
[2:09:08] coming out.
[2:09:11] You understand? So he give you little
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; to see how you manage it.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; The Jews teach their children how to
[2:09:16] manage money.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; One set tithes for good for God. One set
[2:09:21] for investment. One said they teach them
[2:09:24] small.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; So they know money principle for small.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Other people say not a sent for them.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Afterwards they taking their own sense
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; because you haven't taught them. But
[2:09:36] these things could be taught. A lot of
[2:09:39] things you don't know.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; And some of you need to learn and
[2:09:45] recognize you don't know.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; I know I don't know everything. So, I'm
[2:09:49] willing to learn. I'm still learning
[2:09:51] because I'm still growing. I am this
[2:09:53] age, but I'm still learning. I'm still
[2:09:54] growing. I want to learn. I want to grow
[2:09:57] because I want to do better.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; And if there's a better way, I want to
[2:10:00] know that way.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All right. Let's see.
[2:10:04] Come on church. You have to fight to
[2:10:07] possess what you know is your own. Here
[2:10:10] in lies the problem. Do you know what
[2:10:12] belongs to you?
[2:10:14] If you're not reading the word, if
[2:10:16] you're not in the word, how would you
[2:10:17] know exactly what is belongs
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; to you?
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; That you could apply it to your life.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; The promise is yours. If you ever get
[2:10:26] it, you ain't going to get it easy. I'm
[2:10:28] going to tell you that you're going to
[2:10:30] have to take it away from Satan. Satan
[2:10:33] captures your health. You have a right
[2:10:34] to go to Satan and say, "Give it back.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hand it over.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; I come in the name of the Lord,
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; the possessor of heaven and earth. You
[2:10:42] took my child. You got a mix up with the
[2:10:44] wrong boy. You took my boy. Mix up with
[2:10:46] the wrong girl. I claim them."
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; This here,
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; is when I see a sign of maturity in you
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; when you begin to make claims.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about saying prayers.
[2:11:02] Lord bless them in Jesus name. Bless my
[2:11:04] son. Bless not talking about the kind of
[2:11:06] praise. I'm talking about warrior
[2:11:08] prayer.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; If you don't see your children tied up,
[2:11:16] you can't pray that prayer.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; You will say they're going through a
[2:11:20] stage or a phase. The devil telling you
[2:11:22] that
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; it's not stage and phase. You know, the
[2:11:28] devil have them captive. One time
[2:11:30] brother Ram saw some young men in
[2:11:32] prison. You know what the God tell them?
[2:11:34] That's the house of hell.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; He said go and free them.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; God tell him go and free them.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; And he look at himself. Look at the
[2:11:43] bars. He said can't break that. He said
[2:11:45] he had no strength to break that. Then
[2:11:47] he say house of hell
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; give way
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; to the name of Jesus Christ. He had to
[2:11:54] speak to the house of hell
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; to loose them guys from inside of there.
[2:11:59] Who's going to speak? Who's going to say
[2:12:02] it? Or you want to play dumb? You're
[2:12:04] only speaking for who you like and who
[2:12:06] you love. Somebody got to say it.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody got to claim it. The lamb claim
[2:12:11] it for you.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; He's depend upon you to make some
[2:12:14] claims.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Now I mean this, you know, because they
[2:12:19] what he felt led to bring.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; If you notice from the quite couple of
[2:12:23] series and services, we talking about
[2:12:25] inheritance, being a heir, adoption, all
[2:12:27] these different things. You know, he's
[2:12:28] getting to something. All right, let's
[2:12:30] see if we can wrap up here.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; I'm heir to all things is given to me.
[2:12:37] I'm air. I can claim everything that God
[2:12:42] promised me. Notice I know I keep
[2:12:44] skipping and jumping. Notice when Samson
[2:12:47] prayed, he didn't say, "Oh God, sorry
[2:12:50] Elila. Oh Jesus." If Samson go down in
[2:12:53] that mode
[2:12:55] talking about his past sins and the li
[2:12:57] and he fall I don't know I meet their
[2:12:59] brother who falls so much of years and
[2:13:01] 20 years you meet him 20 years later he
[2:13:02] still talk about he fall a keep falling
[2:13:05] he just he in the ground
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; because they teach that they want to
[2:13:10] batter you this is what ministers do and
[2:13:11] pastors do they batter the people in
[2:13:13] subjection and keep them under the foot
[2:13:15] under the tongue
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; if you fall fail fail you repent is
[2:13:20] either God forgive you or go there
[2:13:21] forgive Amen.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; If God forgive you, you could move on.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; If God ever forgive you, go to him for
[2:13:28] forgiveness
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; and get his forgiveness and come back
[2:13:30] and praise and shout and rejoice and
[2:13:32] worship God.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; But nobody is to keep you down because
[2:13:36] this happened to you and that happened
[2:13:37] to you. Get back up.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Get out of that pit.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; You're not feeling good down there.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; You don't belong down there. You are
[2:13:47] sheep in the big mud because you fall
[2:13:50] inside of there. Well, your sheep, the
[2:13:53] pig, forget it. When he get that mud, he
[2:13:55] want to move. He's in love with that
[2:13:58] mud.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; But the sheep is very uncomfortable
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; because that mud messing up your wool.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; You're not a pig.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; So, watch this. It is mine. Satan cannot
[2:14:12] watch. Satan cannot hold it if you go to
[2:14:14] him in the scriptural authoritative word
[2:14:18] with faith to say it is mine
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; and lay it down. Now a child can't do
[2:14:23] that
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; but a mature son can
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; a mature daughter can.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; This is mine.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; God give me this help. God give me the
[2:14:31] body. So Samson could have said watch
[2:14:33] might not even backside and fell but you
[2:14:35] have no right to take out my eyes.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; So Samson tell God avenge me of my eyes.
[2:14:42] They had no right because they they
[2:14:44] didn't give it.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; They shouldn't take it away.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; They had no right to take it.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; God, you give me those eyes. They had no
[2:14:51] right to take those eyes. Oh, give the
[2:14:53] Lord a shout. Satan have no right taking
[2:14:55] up my son, taking up my daughter. So, I
[2:14:58] send in a word after them.
[2:15:01] Whether they like it or not, whether
[2:15:02] they want it or not, it doesn't matter
[2:15:04] with me.
[2:15:08] Give the Lord some praises.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; As I say, if they don't want you, pray
[2:15:13] for them when they eye open, pray for
[2:15:15] them when they eye closed.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; When they lying down, go right by them
[2:15:18] and say in Jesus name.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; He said, I like that. Satan, you lay it
[2:15:30] down. You took it from me. You give it
[2:15:32] back because I'm serving notice on you.
[2:15:34] Oh, praise him. So you understand now
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; I want to hope I didn't pass one. When a
[2:15:40] sinner can see you don't have to sin. A
[2:15:42] lot of people they sin because they have
[2:15:44] to sin. That's a pitiful shape when
[2:15:46] you're in you say you have to sin. But
[2:15:48] when you realize you don't have to sin
[2:15:51] anymore. There are people stand up and
[2:15:53] curse and laugh in your face and call
[2:15:54] you an idiot. Everything else they're
[2:15:56] willful sinners. There's no hope for
[2:15:57] them. But that man who does something
[2:15:59] constantly they don't want to do it. He
[2:16:01] steals he don't want to. He lies he
[2:16:02] doesn't want to. He does things he
[2:16:04] doesn't want to. He don't want to be a
[2:16:07] sinner. There's hope for him. If you can
[2:16:09] let me see see what truth is. Come up to
[2:16:11] God's promise. Lay hold of faith on
[2:16:14] that. Walk out here to the enemy and
[2:16:16] simply say, "I can't hold it any longer.
[2:16:18] That's all because it's yours." Tell
[2:16:19] Satan, "Give it back. Give it back. It's
[2:16:21] mine. Don't let him bluff you. Stand
[2:16:23] right there in the line and say, "Give
[2:16:24] it back." Praise God. So Abraham wasn't
[2:16:27] a soldier. He wasn't a fighter. He was a
[2:16:29] farmer. And Abraham could not do
[2:16:30] anything. He was a soldier. He wasn't a
[2:16:32] soldier. And he took that promise and of
[2:16:34] course he got that deliverance. Oh,
[2:16:36] praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Give
[2:16:41] the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; I want to see if I missed something
[2:16:52] here. All right. Maybe slow down. I have
[2:16:56] to get to it. All right.
[2:17:04] I'm air to divine healing. I'm heir to
[2:17:06] joy. I've got a right to be happy. I'm
[2:17:08] heir to peace. Take this person out.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; I did this. I did that. No. Take what
[2:17:14] God say. I'm an air to peace. I'm an air
[2:17:17] to eternal life. I'm an heir to the Holy
[2:17:19] Spirit. I'm an air to every evidence
[2:17:21] it's got. I'm a heir. Hear this. To the
[2:17:23] authority of God. Who made you that? Not
[2:17:25] me. He did.
[2:17:27] And every one of you is an heir of the
[2:17:29] same thing. I'm a heir to the throne. He
[2:17:31] that overcometh with me shall be on my
[2:17:33] throne. Isn't that right?
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Are you a heir to bham tabernacle? No.
[2:17:36] I'm an heir to all things both seen,
[2:17:39] present, future, to everything. I'm an
[2:17:42] heir to it. And every sin and wickedness
[2:17:45] has been put under my feet by the grace
[2:17:47] of Jesus Christ. He rose on Easter
[2:17:49] morning, triumph over death, hell, and
[2:17:50] the grave. and his anointed
[2:17:52] authoritative servant said, "The promise
[2:17:54] is unto you and to your children, to
[2:17:56] them that are far off, even as many as
[2:17:58] the Lord our God shall call. I am an
[2:18:00] heir." Amen. I'm a sinner, brother
[2:18:03] Brandham. You don't have to be. You are
[2:18:04] a sinner because you desire to be. You
[2:18:06] don't have to be. The debt is already
[2:18:08] paid. Brother Brandham, I wish I had
[2:18:10] joy. You can have it. You are just
[2:18:12] letting Satan rub you from the privilege
[2:18:14] that Jesus died for. I'm an heir to it.
[2:18:16] It's all mine. Everything he died for
[2:18:18] belong to me. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:18:20] praises. God don't send you to hell. You
[2:18:23] send yourself to hell. You break every
[2:18:25] barricade. You'd run every stoplight
[2:18:28] trying to make yourself go to hell and
[2:18:29] then say God is good and won't send you
[2:18:31] to hell. You are sending yourselves to
[2:18:34] hell. God sends nobody to hell. It was
[2:18:36] created for the devil and his angels,
[2:18:38] not for you. Give the Lord some praises.
[2:18:41] The Bible said hell was created for the
[2:18:43] devil and his angels.
[2:18:45] Amen and amen and amen. Let's go. Almost
[2:18:49] there. To restore means to return to the
[2:18:51] former condition. So when God say I will
[2:18:53] restore. He want to restore your health,
[2:18:55] your strength, your zeal, your
[2:18:57] enthusiasm, the passion to know the
[2:18:59] word, the to get in the spirit, the
[2:19:01] fervent desire to please God. He want to
[2:19:02] restore all of that. Give the Lord some
[2:19:05] praises to bring back to the former
[2:19:07] owner to bring back to the former state
[2:19:09] of condition. If a claim is made on
[2:19:12] something to make a restoration, you can
[2:19:15] enforce it. Glory to God. So when Jesus
[2:19:19] died because only when the testator died
[2:19:21] the will is effective. The death of the
[2:19:24] testator only when your father dead your
[2:19:26] grandfather dead he the will could be
[2:19:28] effective. So when Jesus died the will
[2:19:30] was in effect. And God sent the Holy
[2:19:33] Ghost as the enforcer.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let's go. Right with me. I
[2:19:39] almost listen. Your father and father
[2:19:41] leave some land for you
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; and there on the land. You don't know
[2:19:45] that that land is yours until some
[2:19:47] lawyers come and say well listen we have
[2:19:49] this for you you know when you have of
[2:19:50] age you reach 21 now this land is yours
[2:19:52] when you go and spy the land squatters
[2:19:53] there how long is sp 5 years 2 years
[2:19:55] four years and you come and tell them
[2:19:57] I'm the owner you know all that to leave
[2:19:58] you know they say we not leaving
[2:20:03] but they just walking out so they say
[2:20:05] they're not leaving then you go to the
[2:20:07] court and they get now the enforcer that
[2:20:09] when they come with tractor and
[2:20:11] bulldozer and all kind of thing like
[2:20:12] that then say 5 days and you're gone
[2:20:14] 5 days, we break it and everything and
[2:20:16] the enforcer is there to enforce it.
[2:20:18] Well, just as in the natural, the Holy
[2:20:21] Ghost,
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; he is God's enforcer.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; But you have to make claims.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; You can't watch somebody land say that
[2:20:27] my land. You're coming for it. You're
[2:20:28] mad. You own that land.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; You watch somebody land say that it's my
[2:20:32] land.
[2:20:35] Could you imagine that mad people?
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's crazy.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; You can't watch somebody land and say,
[2:20:41] "I claim it in Jesus." That's not yours.
[2:20:44] It has to be yours.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Your grandfather, some family have to
[2:20:47] leave that for you.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Then you have a deed.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; The deed is evidence of purchase.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; The deed is document.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; That it is actually yours.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; This is what this book is about.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; That Adam had it.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; The the the original owner held it.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus brought it down.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Give it to William Brham. William Brham
[2:21:07] gave it to the bride. and to give a
[2:21:09] five-fold ministry to re-echo to echo
[2:21:13] the very same promises to you.
[2:21:20] And the Holy Ghost is the enforcer to
[2:21:22] enforce your healing, to enforce your
[2:21:25] peace, to enforce your joy, to make you
[2:21:28] get a good night's rest. Oh, give the
[2:21:30] Lord a shout. He giveth his beloved
[2:21:33] sleep.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Good rest.
[2:21:36] [Applause]
[2:21:41] [Music]
[2:21:43] Are you ready?
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; We have the privilege
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; to enforce upon Satan
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; the claims that God gave us.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; For God has a law and his word is a law.
[2:21:56] And God in his word made certain claims
[2:21:58] to the church. Therefore, we have a
[2:22:00] right to force these claims upon Satan
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; and say, "Give it back.
[2:22:07] There's a song they say, "The Lord save
[2:22:09] me. Why should I be B?
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; The Lord save me. Why should I be B?
[2:22:15] I've been baptized in Jesus name. Why
[2:22:17] should I be B?" Amen. Amen. Amen. That's
[2:22:20] what we talking about. The Lord save me.
[2:22:23] Why should I be born? Oh, glory. The
[2:22:25] Lord save me. Why should I be born? The
[2:22:29] Lord save me. Why should I be bound?
[2:22:32] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:35] Hallelujah.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go. The law of the spirit of God,
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; the law of it,
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; is to force Satan
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; to give up that which he has
[2:22:46] unrightfully and deceitfully taken from
[2:22:49] God. Souls of men he took from God.
[2:22:52] Souls of women, children, sicknesses of
[2:22:55] the body, he placed upon people where
[2:22:57] God made them in his image to be like
[2:22:59] him. And the church has been given the
[2:23:02] rightful legal rights by the Bible to
[2:23:06] take the Holy Spirit
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; and enforce this upon them.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; God promises are true.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; This is where I get the scription from.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop them.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. They are God's promises.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; He give us the promise of just like he
[2:23:21] did the children of Israel.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal church has come to
[2:23:25] Kenesh Bania. Are we able? Can we do it?
[2:23:28] Jesus Christ. yesterday and forever. Can
[2:23:30] we walk up there and take a hold of God
[2:23:32] promise
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; and say, "It's the truth.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; I claim it.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I own it. It is mine.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; God, give it to me."
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Do you see
[2:23:42] it?
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; You have to say, "It's the truth.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; What's the truth?" The word coming to
[2:23:47] me, that's the truth. That joy is mine.
[2:23:49] Peace is mine.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I claim it.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; I own it.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; It is mine.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; God give it to me.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Forgiveness.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness is the truth.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; I claim it.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I own it.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; It is mine.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; God, give it to me.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So
[2:24:13] you don't have to do like, "Oh, God, I
[2:24:14] paid for his sins." You can't make your
[2:24:16] claims.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Skip.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Skip that.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Notice in the the what disciples, they
[2:24:25] had mechanics. They were sitting there
[2:24:27] saying, "Oh, I'm afraid of them.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to make a claim."
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Call them great bishops and things out
[2:24:32] there. I'm afraid to what the other
[2:24:34] message world would think about what we
[2:24:36] doing. Don't make no claim of Holy Ghost
[2:24:38] revival. 7 revival. We going too far.
[2:24:41] Nobody else is talking about that. They
[2:24:42] don't want to talk about that. That's
[2:24:43] the that's the business. They have
[2:24:44] plenty messages to preach. But we want
[2:24:46] what God promised
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; for the bride. This is exclusive promise
[2:24:49] to the bride.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; The rest could get anything they want.
[2:24:52] But the seven toners got us the bride.
[2:24:54] Seven tenants give the bride faith.
[2:24:55] Seven thunder show about how to be pier
[2:24:57] seven bride revival seven voices to that
[2:25:00] group that's seven sing that seven of
[2:25:02] business this is our business that's my
[2:25:04] father's business that's the business I
[2:25:06] was sent to see about okay the lord a
[2:25:09] shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah
[2:25:12] these disciple were cowards afraid to
[2:25:14] make a claim because the bishops and
[2:25:17] them all of a sudden dynamics come what
[2:25:20] did it do it not only filled their
[2:25:22] spirit inside but it quickened their
[2:25:24] mechanic
[2:25:25] And they went out to the people. Whereas
[2:25:27] before the dynamics come, they were just
[2:25:29] mechanics. But when the dynamics hit
[2:25:31] them, these people are not afraid. Isn't
[2:25:33] that right?
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. They are not drunk as you
[2:25:35] suppose. I'm one of them. Oh, praise
[2:25:37] God.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Musicians, come
[2:25:39] please.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Watch. Hallelujah.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; If you got the baptism of the Holy
[2:25:44] Ghost, that is the token
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; that you have. Every redemptive blessing
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; that Jesus died for
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; belongs to you.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; It's in your hand. Are you afraid to
[2:25:54] claim it? Move out the worldly trash.
[2:25:56] He's showing you what you have to do
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; out of your house.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Get ready for it.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Burn up your shorts.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; You don't have your shorts in your back
[2:26:07] just in case they want to rock back on
[2:26:08] it. You burn the shorts. You burn the
[2:26:11] mini dress. You burn them with a long
[2:26:13] slit. You burn them,
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; not hide them,
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; not put them in a deeper drawer.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Come like when you're fighting them
[2:26:21] days, you bloody bridge behind you. No
[2:26:22] turning back.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Burn up your shorts.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Throw your card tables away. Get rid of
[2:26:28] your cigarettes. Dump your unbelief,
[2:26:31] your church papers in the trash can
[2:26:32] where they belong. Then you're getting
[2:26:34] ready
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; to do what? To apply the token in prayer
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; with real evidence, real faith. Apply it
[2:26:41] with confidence.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close.
[2:26:51] We're going to play something.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with a prayer from
[2:26:55] brother Brennham.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh God, our heavenly father,
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; we just thank thee, Lord, for all that
[2:27:03] you have done for us.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Your great being is near and you are
[2:27:07] here to make every one of the people
[2:27:10] well.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; I pray thee, heavenly father, that right
[2:27:14] at this moment, you will take every
[2:27:16] person here into your divine arms.
[2:27:20] May the fire of God begin to fall.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; May the power reach down and pick up the
[2:27:24] people. Shake them, Lord. And let them
[2:27:28] realize that this is the day of their
[2:27:29] visitation.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; This is the time the Lord has set. This
[2:27:34] is the time of their healing.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; God is spreading forth his arms over
[2:27:37] this audience tonight showing his signs
[2:27:39] and wonders.
[2:27:40] I pray that you would take all unbelief
[2:27:42] and skeptics, drive out every demon of
[2:27:45] unbelief and all formal ungodly
[2:27:49] indifference
[2:27:50] and take this people and heal every one
[2:27:52] of them. Lord have mercy. Now as your
[2:27:55] servant, I ask every unclean spirit that
[2:27:58] is in this room as God's prophet. I ask
[2:28:01] every devil to be cast away from the
[2:28:04] people
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; that they might go from here free. Amen.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; created of heaven and earth, author of
[2:28:10] everlasting life, hear the prayer of
[2:28:12] your servant
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; and grant this tonight in Jesus name.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Now with your head bowed, set closed,
[2:28:17] believe all your heart, every man and
[2:28:20] woman, now sit tight in God. Now this is
[2:28:22] the part I want to get to. I want you to
[2:28:25] repeat this prayer that I tell you.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Now you repeat it.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it and you just pray
[2:28:31] it. I'm going to say it. Surely God, I
[2:28:35] know what it takes to defeat Satan. If
[2:28:38] God so confirm it here tonight to prove
[2:28:40] it's the truth. I've told you the truth
[2:28:43] and God testifies the truth. And while
[2:28:45] we are just a little bitty group of
[2:28:47] people sitting here together, you said,
[2:28:49] "Why not let this whole group be healed
[2:28:51] tonight, you repeat this prayer after me
[2:28:53] everywhere? Almighty God, God, creator
[2:28:57] of heaven and earth,
[2:28:59] author of everlasting life, everlasting
[2:29:01] life, send thy blessing upon thy
[2:29:03] servant.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; For I am desperately in need.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; I have seen.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; I have heard the gospel.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; And I believe now.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, help thou my unbelief.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; And now for a long time,
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; for a long time,
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Satan has bound me.
[2:29:24] But I realize tonight
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; he has no legal rights to hold me.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; I am a Christian.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; I am a Christian.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; And I claim
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; my God-given privileges.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; And from right now on
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; I accept my healing.
