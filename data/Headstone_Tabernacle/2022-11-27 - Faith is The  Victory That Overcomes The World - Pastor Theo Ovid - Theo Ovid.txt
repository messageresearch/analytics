put it deep in Abraham's heart to seek a city who's making Builder is God Amen the Lord you put a taste in our souls to be like you father Enoch had a testimony before he left and we also will have to have a testimony that we please you God come this morning take me out of the way and come into your word so to us we need to hear from you it is coming Beyond a similar now it is coming to a genuine life a word life Spirit life Holy Ghost life amen make us true channels Lord that you could speak to your people live to air make us through child's Lord that the spirit can flow freely and you can be magnified and glorified Lord in Jesus amen God bless you welcome it's good to be here let's go into the word amen we have three portions of scripture this morning one from first John chapter 5. you want to read from verse 4 to 8. oh we also want to look at first John chapter 2 15 to 17. and also Hebrews 11 was five and six reading first John chapter 5 verse 4. for whosoever is born of God overcome it the world and this is a victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcoming the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that buried Witness because the spirit is truth for they are treated bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and they are treated by a witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and D Street agree in one I want to go to First John chapter two wanna read from verse 15. it reads love not the world neither things that are in the world If any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of this flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he's a do it the will of God provided forever allow scriptures of Hebrews 11 and it's from verse 5. and it reads by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see that and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God and without faith is impossible to please him for he that coming to God must believe that he is that he's a rewarder of them that brilliantly seek him let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word and Lord you know all the chopped up words and things here and you just you could put it together father take me out of the way and lay your spirit flew upon your world and quickly to your people in Jason may ask it email name and you may be seated praise God thanks for coming this morning you wouldn't want to come to church and preach the empty benches so you make the effort to come and I pray that God richly reward you and bless you for coming out this morning uh I want to read that first John 2 15 to 17 and the Amplified before we continue it says here do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh craving for sensual gratification the lust of the eyes greedy longings of the Mind and the pride of life Assurance in one owns resources or in the stability of Earthly things these do not come from the father but of the world itself and the world passes away and disappears and with it the Forbidden Cravings the passionate desires the lust of it and he who does the will of God and carries out his purpose in life abides and remains forever it isn't that something title this morning faith is the victory that overcomes the world as the title this morning faith is the victory that overcomes the world I have a subject of Being Born Again by The Incorruptible seed of the word of God I have a little team it's the truth because God said so once God said it it's the truth and this scripture this are being born again of the incorporable receipt of the will of God that came from First Peter chapter one verse 22 State senior prefab your souls in obeying the truth see truth is not just to hear but truth has to be obeyed obeyed obeying the truth through the spirit under unfake love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart vividly being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abide it forever and then Peter give this reference for all fleshes as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass what happens after a while the grass wither it the flower falleth away but the word of the Lord endured forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you so just as grass just fade away on the floor fall off so the glory of man and all the lust there are gonna feel they're gonna fall off one day isn't that right all right was there and they're telling the Believers that your prayer even stands Beyond debt if somebody die doesn't stop their prayer that's a powerful taught him Hallelujah just think about it now so I was saying you don't know some grandmother might have prayed for you another grandmother or grandfather might even be around right now but their prayer was held before God they die and gone on but that person before God waiting for you to God for answer that prayer on your behalf before you can't stop praying for your children your family your loved one you can't stop that because your prayers are living before God your prayer is being born in a Bible God could see your prayer he could hear your prayer your prayer going to be answered don't stop praying because when I feel this and you're not seeing me no Beauty it is dry whether it's scratchy whether you don't see you you're like no keep on praying glory to God I will say remember that when Isaac put the blessing upon Jacob and Jacob thought was Esau and the blessing went upon uh um Jacob and when Esau came he said Esau the father said but I put the blessing on that other son already watch this he couldn't take it back he couldn't cancel it he couldn't undo it oh Hallelujah he had to take what we mean because it already called his mouth that's how powerful it is hallelujah and one more one more when Abraham told abimelech that Sarah was a sister which was a lie and which was kind of thrown away but but it wasn't the truth God frees every woman in that house foreign foreign it is let's get over into the world this morning question and answers question you said a person could live so close to God that he could not sin while he on Earth then explain first John 1 8 to 10. so but I'm going to read first John 1 8 to 10 and the Bible says if we see we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and say cleanses from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sins we make him a liar and the wisdom in us well now with my with my dear brother just turn right over to the two chapter the ninth verse you write on the same page in my Bible eight verse to begin with and then but I'm gonna read he that committed sins of the devil for the devil's Sin from the beginning for the purpose the Son of God was made manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil just what I've been talking about God predestinated knowing you whosoever are these other scripture whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed will ruin it in him and he cannot sin because he is being born of God that's just that's just what the word says now if you watch here if we say we have not seen we make him a liar and the word is not in us now some people say well no here's just a good little girl or a good little boy you never seem to begin with you are born in sin you are shared iniquity you come into the real speaking light so when you are born in this world you are a liar you are a thief you're everything there is just all this sin not a thief because you have been stolen that's right you are not a liar because right but the spirit is in you when you are born because you are in the world and that's the reason you can't have Reformation you've got to die and be born you can't you have birth without crucifixion underlying that you cannot have but without crucifixion you can't have a resurrection you must be crucified to the things of the world in order to be resurrected in Christ so if you're going to depend upon your intellectual conception you'll never be born of the spirit of God you got to forget that all you ever knowed I know nothing except Christ Jesus and be born on you see it's a bit that makes you a new creation the very Greek word here it says it means creation you are a new creation there's a warrior creature is the word creation you are New Creation not of the world but in Christ Jesus he was in the world you know fancy things fine clothes Pretty Brown Eyes to a girl will be here for the ball you know and something another to attract attention or lustful or drinking the Bible said if you love The World and Achieve the world the love of God's not even you so in order to get that out of you you have to die you have to be crucified buried and resurrected a new creation in Christ Jesus now this is the truth because God said so this is the word say Amen somebody Hallelujah so therefore you will receive the Holy Ghost before you receive the Holy Ghost you are believing unto eternal life but you do not have eternal life until you receive the Holy Ghost because it is eternal life the Holy Ghost is God it is God's life in you then you got eternal life do you understand it now you are believing unto it there's a good thing you woman excuse me for this if it sounds too flat but still a baby isn't born if you treat that baby right and follow the rules of nature that baby will be born normal but if you don't apply everything to the Rules of Nature and get a hard bruise or hit is going to ruin you it's killed the day before it's born well that's the matter the bruises come from Satan and Satan takes the poison that's of hell and try to boost the church that's intervened with a baby before it's ever born they kill it but if you just take the Bible and nurture it give the baby food the mother taking vitamins and this is the best vitamins I know of it builds you up now the church ought to be taking spiritual vitamins and the vitamins is right here A whole book full of them praise God and that little father oh he's got life and the little cells are moving King and moving but he isn't born here that means the baby is in the womb but the baby hasn't been born as yet is that life it's kicking but it's not born here let's continue but as soon as he's brought into the world the doctor holds him up give him a spanking and wow there he goes he starts breathing and just as soon as he breathes the bread of life then he becomes a living soul and that's the thing sometimes you receive you are ready to receive the Holy Ghost you are in travail you are wanting to be delivered how many in here in that shape right now wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost really want to know what it is and you want to get into it who wants the bathroom Holy Ghost raise your hands he said you are in travailable you are wanting to be delivered could imagine wanting to be delivered because you are pregnant with a child you are pregnant with God Hallelujah glory to God amen and what you need is a little gospel spark sometime when you scream or Glory I know you think I'm crazy but we have the mind of Christ which is craziness to the world Hallelujah let's continue brother Branham if possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if he rejects the light of the word even though he has a genuine experience of justification and fanfiction yes sir that's exactly right when you use the expression that if we do not believe the word we will be eternally separated from Christ do you mean the foolish version of living eternally but they will be separated from New Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with the bride here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not the spiritual birth requires all three stages of grace before a person is truly Born Again absolutely he said absolutely the three stages are required now we get into something just bear with me and I explained this morning on the same thing you've got to have all stages you are begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the womb of a mother but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you are born then you are not converted you are in the possession of being converted until that time and then he went under some deep stuff that's the reason all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the AHS passed us by depending on eight why it wasn't time they will be gotten oh hallelujah praise God so that meant the Pentecostal was still in the womb so God didn't bring Mysteries to them because they were still inside the womb but brother Branham came to introduce the person of Jesus Christ which is the fullness of the word and you're gonna be born by that word the incorrupt Of The World God take his way and pack it up and wrap it up as a seed to be preached and that is what being preached to you and then the secret comes now the word is in the bride hallelujah oh God mystery wrapped up in a seed and he slipped that seed inside of you and the devil can't do anything about it Oh Glory to God because the secret is out your room is already closed you can get pregnant for somebody else call your room is sealed up Let the word of God oh Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord he said it couldn't come before now hallelujah praise God so this person of the Holy Ghost is what balram came to introduce us to Hallelujah the person of God which is the word of God isn't that right bless the beaten of the Lord let's continue now watch it will come to a head in the last days that it will be this the seed of God and the mark of the beast two spiritual Powers working together and anyone knows that the Sea of God is the boot right the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 30. see see it's the United States in a statement you know you have a scripture to back up what he is saying so you know it's a scriptural voice that is speaking to you Ephesians 14 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed till the day of your Redemption when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the new birth we know that you are begotten of the spirit I'll admit that but until you are born there is a baby is begotten in the mother's womb that's got a kind of a life it's a life little cells in the body twisting and kicking and jumping but when it is born it has a squeal and it become a living Soul so he's saying the womb rights and the outside light is two different line foreign [Applause] [Applause] effect [Applause] somewhere [Applause] Oh Glory to God could I wash something else and Jesus asks a question who do you say I am and please remember you but my father my father when you are texting me on Whatsapp nobody will call you and tell you my father really hurt and upon this walk I will pay my church and the Peace of Heaven look you and the pastor no one God no everyone God is that from you and Elder and God knows you and God and what you are in this church knows you are God okay the Lord not you and this group if you are God amen this is shaking you know Poncho disciples following Jesus and they don't know who he is just now but don't mess with the revelation you know it wasn't built upon Peter you know it was built upon the rock that go inside of Peter okay the Lord I shout somebody's gonna fall but they didn't change because here the keys to unlock the kingdom oh God help me this morning [Applause] foreign that's why God pleased to identify the book of the generation of the of Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] and all these people all these cinnamon and sinner woman and all that people see them as that God didn't see them his names on the book you know they watch what are wrong let me know what what inside of them fool you know don't let them mess around their life mess you up don't do that that same Peter said this is that that the Prophet Joseph said [Applause] with that [Applause] let me see them and when that man begin to walk and jump up everybody started looking Peter keep yourself [Applause] contributing guys off eating Peter said you think by my Holiness this management he said don't mix up you know he said his feet in Jesus name don't get tired [Applause] oh give the Lord I want to tell you it's in you you can't feel it I mean you can't feel it it's not to feel it's to believe [Applause] thank you [Applause] I remember presenting me our time since I was coming to church he's a sister no when she's a community unbelievable mood before she get baptized and stuff I see some words I posted a comment at all you see when you're washing people's eyes person will see him and they will respond such a blank face I don't need to listening listeners and there's a CDL but you judge that by your sight you get well tired you know all these brothers by sight you get tired you know Samson wasn't a big muscular man you know Brahm said that was the insulting to God even see Mr Hall come with big muscles oh God you're strong man you could play something because something wasn't pumping energy even expect something you expect that kind of thing when the spirit come upon him he lift them up beat them up anything yet [Applause] my God my God you watching me out the season you're watching me overtime him they come for fruit and it's winter time show me dry I look him dead but you wait till my season come you wait to spend time come you're welcome Resurrection come you will tell my anointing come Hallelujah [Applause] it's not Homer until it's over oh God help me this morning this battle is not over when Samson foreign all right you out of the picture it's a word or your life that's in the picture [Applause] let me see that the Jailer was a seed who going to ask the jail and give a testimony [Music] that he could speak to the Jailer who is the seed [Applause] so you got caucus because you can lock up and this happened that happened you have to understand there's a purpose behind that papers there's a purpose behind your life there's a purpose between you behind all what you're going through God set it up that way stop fighting it stop fighting it stop fighting it right with the vision right with the predestination why would the prophecy over their life Hallelujah [Applause] all things work together for good but you can all things work together for good pretend that loved God to them who would be called be called he called and somebody decode Oh Glory to God Jacob I love [Applause] is so I hate what God love about Jacob my God he's a group of artist he's a specialist he again if he's family or friend rip off is the name of the gift help it that's the man artist and he's a Son of God hiding behind con artists he's a con specialist oh God but God say I love that man because when you let God right Jacob said I want that I am playing with that I will talk about book I could go aboard a ship for the Republican pandas he didn't care about them thing but check out my love amen amen [Applause] the purpose of God according to election sounds so good the purpose of God according to the election it's so plain Jesus said he needs Patrick send the disciples to take some errands and give them a break because he don't even want to see this mystery that's about to unfold this is critical it's like an alarm in heaven a name have to be called as a woman that's society I'm messing with and church people I am testifying with because someone is not good big flashing light like what Isaac said about rehab and Salman General Salman and I better questions at least you're interested in you shouldn't go in unadvisly you know but advice and give me whole whole story but God put in his heart to love rehab [Applause] everybody has stories about rehab but this salmon everybody with their stories because he take rehab for wife because God knows Obed and foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] it's not my power by my spirit do I hear I shot in the house do I hear somebody breaking or breaking through Oh Glory to God [Applause] my hair could Hallelujah somebody shout him oh glory to God I like when God dropped we're called Shock bombs you may be seated bombs Gideon Mighty murderer I like how God do that goodness again you're coming on the excellent corridium stage one stage two he dropped the whole hog on himself is me me talking to I thought my brothers won so because you walk on the Bible straight up in here but you see I ain't seen that and he I see here Bible I see you talking he talked but I see something inside of you that you're not even my way because he wanted well she didn't know what was she had her depression her frustration I'm fed up she fed up too you know but there's nothing she could do she wasn't a brain she didn't feel good about herself she didn't feel good about what she said when she didn't feel good [Music] she couldn't dance and jump and jump like the sayings about she couldn't do that cross eye you didn't hear his members were in the longest I'm watching the only Red Cross side but when Jesus finished with her she she walk him she ran that's that free let me give you share watching and see what kind of dress you have one you know did you see anyone chat on me like before but she was free in her spirit in my heart you see when the son of man set you free you are free from your past you are free from yourself you are free from your fears if you are free from what people think about you what people talk about you or buried oh God hallelujah [Applause] let me drop a bomb on you your freedom complexes [Applause] our complex yeah yeah every year for this freedom is bigger than the complexes this will compare complexes set free it's free indeed free to run free to jump free the praise God oh glory to God free free free free free free at last my God I feel we were going to free this morning God must set you free o glory of God Amen you may be seated [Applause] you see when you talk about your complex and talk about you go through you're keeping in the comfort zone you trying to justify your behavior yeah you're trying to find some solution to your off-key and perverted and messed up thinking on approach but if you look at the word and say it's true because God said so you put your feelings to rest you reject your income taxes you so what did God say Hallelujah when God said Jesus said it's not fair to take a change button to dogs the woman say Amen dog with the explanation of looking like a dog [Music] because God said so and because she accepted but the word said she could see what the dog see you have to accept it to see what you're supposed to see if they don't accept it they will never see it okay [Applause] accepted accept it for what it is accept what God said if God say you're born free you're going free foreign [Applause] [Music] again begotten in the mother's womb being born and then switch now to say about our bodies now We Are One Wheaton just assure as the natural body was coming forth there's a spiritual body to receive it when it drops from its mother when it drops on the mother earth which is in the womb we are groaning now groaning laboring getting old and sickness everything will be sitting it and the spirit on the inside of it looks for a land beyond the river it is growing twisting jumping because there's a life in Deer that lives forever it's in my body has got to die and just as a mother dropped the natural baby there's a spiritual body so outside the baby's room outside the mother's womb as a spirit waiting to catch the baby and when the baby is born the spirit slips up into the baby and the baby gave it a big noise well just like that your spirit outside of your spirit there's a body waiting to catch your spirit that's why cautious how deep is your steam because I understand the revelation of this thing this thing is there's a body outside waiting for when I die or pouring of God to step into it Give the Lord a shock it is already there [Applause] let me be seated yourself in this glorious body we shall be changed in a moment in the figure when I Oh Glory of them on the ground they're coming up we are alive and remain not going to hinder them all be caught up meet them this is becoming Memorial this is what we are living for this is what we are preaching for [Applause] so what just as the mother dropped the natural baby the spiritual body got it the Earth will drop and the body of the natural will drop and the physical body or the celestial body will grab it Yonder if this early time might be dissolve we have one waiting that's the reason you forget the things of the world they are dead to you oh glory to God hallelujah he said the Holy Ghost is the new birth we know that oh praise the name of the Lord It's been born again of the spirit of God you're fighting to live in an eleven to die fighting to live get a piece of paper to get this and get that and afterwards again and you know what you can't pay for health you can't pay for peace you gotta pay for Joy you can't pay for relationship people Crush others get into the power of riches they step on their friend they step on the family they step on the head at this one and that one they cut off this one and do what kind of thing at the end of the day they're all alone on top of money that can't get them life that Target them Joy they don't hear my peace Hallelujah they're going down and they're worried because they ain't know where they're going they're just going down Hallelujah they are the best doctors they paying for but their body's still going down because the prophet tell us there's only four years of light and one going out in their twenties another one in your 30s another one in your 40s and one more remaining and regards to what food they eat is that one more light remaining Oh Glory to God hallelujah but I am saying that this is not the only world there's another world and we have a bunch of Heroes and saints that gone on before and they are dependent upon us because they without us not made perfect so this church has got to come to perfection oh glory Lord God Hallelujah in other words this church has got to come to charity because charity is that Perfection so to get the charity and they started with faith and faith is the victory that overcomes the world so you have to come to Victory God don't want to bring you to victory you must come to Victory somehow somehow you've got to come to Victory if you're not Victorious now you will be but there is no Escape in it no problem with the life of Faith Abraham lived by it just I live by it Samson live by it Moses in my head you are gonna live by it the church shall live by faith thank you it's not a one-time Act is alive thank you Lord Jesus God [Music] remember when somebody falling don't make him anyways and people in Pride and probably because he falled understanding like if they controlling their standing he said don't make it worse help him help him up try to get him back to Brotherhood again the Brotherhood of God that my Christian friends has been my vision of what the world needs today is back to God and I'm doing my very best and I intend to keep on doing all that I know how to bring a man back to God and to bring a Brotherhood and a feeling of Christ among the people that is why a minister shouldn't tell the people everything but Abraham said that when you tell the people all kind of thing now the people fight that's why I never give it to you about UEFA fight preacher no church nothing that foolishness I never been unified oh God they're doing me and the same me I will deal with them for myself [Applause] oh you want to fight with me I have the gift to tell people I can just do their face washing them in their eyeball I don't have to talk behind nobody's back I have a gift not to talk behind somebody's back I could tell it to your face if I say it I say direct to your face I do have to process me don't say me I don't have that you know it's me [Applause] no God put that inside of me I am built that way sorry I've never encountered a man that has intimidated me yet maybe he's a wrong I don't know I am meeting me but I built this way Hallelujah glory to God you have to rebate a stand glory to God whether rain Sun stand with children no wonder still stand your husband can't take it stand on your own this time over the Lord you love the Lord more than your wife you love the Lord more than your husband you love the Lord If any man waiting forsake mother father brother husband and foreign [Applause] tell me you're off and then run forgive the Lord I shall don't say this say Amen you know I'm not playing with words you know this is the truth [Music] be the work understand favor let me continue thank you you know you would like to know what I think is the greatest need of the church today where I think is lacking is no soul travail the people are not broke up enough there's no burden seemingly you give me somebody to talk about lost souls they cry they want to revive us so bad they can hardly eat if you read the history of the world a religious history you'll find out it always taking that kind of a spirit to bring a Revival so what is the prophecy on the fourth seal he said the bride hasn't had our Revival yet there have been no manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it it will take those seven Thunders to wake up the bride again he said if the churches will forget their Creeds and plead the promises it will become effective to them so they are promises we have to plea holy say Lord you promise it he had to harass God for it God wants to see who's the best knockers not just not ones who knock it so when you're knocking on God says he again yes it's here again there's me again tomorrow you hear me in the morning I'm knocking in the evening I want the door open I reckon I didn't even open it

of message people who sat down for 40 plus years here and here and here and to get activated with a crying despair how do you trans how do you get that transfer then because they're custom here and they want to hear a message they come to hear words they come to connect with dots to take off what must I do what must I be active in doing to bring a result because that's what you need to know they're not coming to hear for information you're coming to get inspiration to know what you're going to do about this thing [Applause] stand your prayers that way so they're dropping power you're losing your prayer then you will recognize the impact the important part you play in when you when you fleeing your prayer for the service on Sunday and you'll show your prayer for Wednesday and

but comment and liking the weight you make me call to preach but you can prayers I control to testify but you could give God some Glory and create an atmosphere you can make a socialize the praise even though you had a messed up week you don't have a messed up note [Applause] it's my job is to preach your job is to praise not just to watch me with a tight clip take that somewhere else Oh Glory to God Hallelujah atmosphere [Applause] I will never stop preaching unless I'm not going to intellectualize this and John says no he kept on his Dimensions Oh Glory that goddess Praises praises dimension [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when that woman says even a dog take crumbs and one of the master's table those words went past the dimension where they were at it went straight up to heaven and they enjoyed this pattern dropped that devil straight over daughter boom a bomb got dropped off the door that never thought was to go right away because Faith spoke the right thing and the Heart of a fruit of what faith spoke don't have to respond to Faith God never back down on faith said that's pretty much see the storm on the sin faith that speak the things that are not [Applause] Oh Glory that God faith is a living reality devil was fighting fighting for us to get to number six trying to keep you number five all the time five senses feelings your emotions senses your tastes and see and touch and everything else and God wants you to come back to this sick sense of Faith or you're actually live by that you talk that way you'll live by faith you talk by faith there's no unbelief inside of you only speaking what God said because you know God is speaking the truth if God say Almighty man you're a mighty man you have to feel like a mighty man God said that by the truth [Applause] you have to feel nothing you don't have to see anything at all it's what you believe I believe that this message have a special purpose behind it I believe it's for you I think what I'm preaching is it's not going to return void it okay with God this message is going to you because faith is the victory especially going to overcome the world all that's in the world rest of the eyes left of the flesh the pride of life you must overcome [Applause] the Rapture cannot be a Deliverance for you never said that before Rapture Canada before you leave here before you leave you have to be victorious you have to put your foot on the devil's neck I am not wearing you this morning the devil's not dying you the devil that busted you the devil that can knock you up all these years before you leave here God damn it will be under your feet I'm not asking you I am telling you that it's pretty sure fit here's the victory that overcomes the world let's continue [Music] to shout yes speaking tongues yes dancing Spirit yes I want everyone of them too but I would rather have a church that had such a burden on the heart for prayer that is still at the altar and with dear day and night and everything else and the house was constantly in prayer and humble trying to get people to come to God I'm making calls for the hospital you see this part about getting rid of the Lord it does something for your own testimony when you tell people with Christ and encourage them to come to service and call him to the Lord it does something to you it all envisions sick people and praying for them it opens the ball of compassion it puts you in a channel you see when you're all you're done doing it you're talking about you you're on your own you you are new and some people it's just this circle there are three friends they lost 25 years they get three and a half now the buildings are small and small could be expand your world I get one Amen on that I say it again expand your small world and that's why sometimes I you're way too small for me I don't want to live in your world Jesus Jesus tell them go and preach to Samaria Judea and to the utmost part of the earth send me gospel who should have to stay home foreign entertainment you right man heard him oh Hallelujah do right manhood him and David that's a simple question you know who is that uncircumcised Philistine defiling the army people were shocking actually David went in shopping see David saw the armies of the Living God it's not just armies armies of living God so if you have a living God the Army you know I mean the Army is supposed to be on point they are not supposed to be undefeated they are supposed to be invisible because of the armies of what did that God they're not their God across there them are dead God and God they made a stone and wood and think we understand that but this is the army of the Living God so they want to know how come those people back down hold on 40 days how long are you doing this now 40 days you say well the apostle or the bishop keep missing in action since Goliath got me take a vacation so they're waiting for further instructions and Goliath said send me a man and because Goliath no they have no man like him because he oversized and and there's nobody like that he could just go in the morning send me a man going back so that day when he come back again the Mickey dog send me a man Who David said who is you like desperation desperation this wasn't a show we send somebody a castle yes and somebody you know what I mean if you sacrifice one life you know I mean at least we could take away a bit of Shame nobody ain't going at all because you offer wife your other daughter you offer money nobody then Brothers backing down I mean so I'll have a pretty daughter yeah and plus you have reaches something too so his brothers to produce yourself you go foreign [Music] thank you you want to be Goliath he was so confident of the God that he served he gave testimony of the god that living on the beer and the lion is able to Defenders Goliath because God had qualified him by the bay and the lion that deal with Goliath who is not my book so understanding is inspiration and experience on the backside of that God have to give him some backside is that experiences so all them cell phone signs and all them with young friends and all them Brethren things you have to come out of that forgot to give you a willingness thing where you overcome on the back side of the desert and when you overcome the backside walk up and you're on the front side Give the Lord a shout get the Lord I shout now the divided anything we're going to treat the devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition s that Jesus the reason he told the devil is written because you know that in this people have not we will have no gifts looking for power so he showed that you can overcome by the written word you don't need a gift to cast out devil so overcome you don't need to give up power and you're speaking you don't need all that happen just tell them it is with me it is true because God said so even that settles it I'm gonna be free this morning I'm going to deliver this morning oh God the world is prophesying over me I'm gonna accept it I'm not gonna leave it the same way I came Hallelujah [Applause] so you'd rather have people in prayer humble trying to get people to come to God making calls in the hospital visiting the sick trying to get people to come to church I'm doing right I'd rather have that done all their things put together will take place if you've got hungry from you see some indifferent coming something is wrong another Spirit at work [Music] when a righteous man a good man gets into revealed travel God must hear an answer that's why the Bible didn't talk about he's not coming to God Must Believe God you know either coming to God and believe he is he'll reward of them that diligently seek him he speaks about the way to seek him Hallelujah with Agony with with a desperation Oh Glory to God hallelujah what is the purpose of God's Son and the Holy Spirit what is for is such a great thing why did God send it to amen and who praise the name of the Lord he said what and the bride of Christ is hungering and tasting she is in travail to give birth to the children of God if you never heard that you're hearing it today the bride will be in trouble for Sons to be born not join church we have a bunch of church jumping from church to church going over the message we're not talking about that talk about you born son when you are son you are son devil can't tell you some second seed or you belong to somebody oh God you're a child of the king Hallelujah then you don't look back at your messed up life that was once messed up he take you out to the mess [Applause] Toby continue are we are you enjoying the world all right let's drop a bomb on you now we know that this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from a world of sin into a life of service Center service not self-righteous men from sin to sinners from adulterior to service from foreign [Music] that's the object of taking you to bring you into service his service [Applause] and in the prayer that God has part of the spirit of my eye great signs and wonders out to accompany the ministry for this day former and later women are falling together we know they're supposed to be good silence and wonders but the Bible said we can overcome the world let me say it again because I get 10 cleaning on that are you fighting for them emails not for me because I know when you anchor them emails and says so be it they start to do something for you so this is the truth because God said so that overcomes the world Hallelujah and when Daniel was taken to Babylon though he was going away from his home he was going to have to be a slave to another nation of people but Daniel papers in his heart no matter what it is to him he wasn't going to defile himself with the Babylonian sin oh if we had more Gallant men like that that would purpose in your heart if I'm a Christian I'm going to find out every divine blessing that belongs to me I'm killing it I want to read that again if I'm a Christian I will find out every divine blessing that belongs to me and claim it so now you're talking about it as mines not them and that church no it is mines I claim it so you come here to make claims you come here to get the promises preached so people said by these promises because only when you've heard a promise you can make a claim you don't know what God promised you it's God take a prophet to reveal the sins to bring all the promises for you [Applause] [Applause] but when you see the freedom and the Liberty you're supposed to have you said that is nice that

back give me bring it back bring it back bring it back oh God may God give you back that Joy this morning Joy to Servant try to pray try to read the Bible try to get back in the world as you want to know your promise if you want to know what God Said for you [Applause] you talk about Bolly Robinson he wanted the Holy Ghost in one day he was in the middle of the cornrow he said God if you don't give me the battle Holy Ghost when you come back and you can find my balls laying right here he said that is really getting on the business when they get that kind of purpose in their heart God is going to open up the windows of Heaven something has got to take place you you've got to get the business with God and have some purpose and some gratitude for him saving you is your praises and Thanksgiving your gratefulness you're born in church you raise up in church you're feeling symbolism and your fear entitled to get this effects and you're angry because you feel you're Untitled like the pig when it happens foreign prison he is not only in the god of the mountains either [Applause] this morning he's not only the corner of the mountains he's the god of the valley also foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign that preacher said if I must fight that I might reign increase my courage Lord and he dropped some hand at that man and beat him up good the manga saved that very night but if he was a social Christian and you playing holy holding them down Mighty and religious you see so I'll pray for you you know I mean you find next people Revival not that Soldier that's real man you know as godly man as man of the publics like the challenge you gave me to beat you is licks again from God did that fight you know if you have to fight his licks don't tell me your name is lips don't challenge me to fight I'll beat you I feel the same way and I'll beat you too literally oh how I feel I could do it glory to God if I feel I can do it I could do it so don't challenge me on that or give the Lord a shot because foreign [Applause] what does it do konkan Victory is the same to conquer it means to be done to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin that must rule you you will not know on that let me use that game because maybe they didn't hear good maybe he's talking too fast what is the conquer a conqueror conquering which is the same the conquer means to be done yeah to override to handcuff to turn prison I said stop it now your uniform behave yourself and you are your handcuffs something in your pocket wherever it is the training they have is that you think that man put your hand in bed back and put the handcuffment and lock up and charge him if you're begging me oh gosh how are you moving so that's not going to talk to police man you did your father policeman that's not the training we're living in they need more manners and better Behavior you don't understand it's a demon on that man the force just to protect Christians the police has to protect the Believers so that fell as a terrorist right now so he's getting a good buying handcuff but the same way you had to handcuff conquer big dog overcome fight back Hallelujah I don't see no way I said give him [Music] [Applause] no negotiations this is non-negotiable it means that the sin that once ruled you you ruin it now it means you have overcome it you ripped it you are created and it is he said I feel religious right now which was for a sinner or savior a savior for savior is my performance sin which is first hero of sickness it couldn't be a Healer less because he is over the sickness it's a Healer can conquer sickness and faith victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil is the victory faith and what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not feeling some man but faith in Jesus Christ [Applause] you say my arm is still crippled the faith is a victory I I still feel sick but faith is a victory it overcomes the world and when you can claim into God by prayer until you see this and conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you have overcome you have 50 miles of Elbow Room oh boy we don't have to take a run on that one when you can put him in prayer and Conquer in the spirit realm oh nothing could stop you then you have 50 miles glory to God hallelujah all those boxes of affiliate boxes the daughters just jump in the woman and run on this fight made us prepare yourself mentally that's somebody win whether the way to see the weight before they go in the ring and the rain remains opposition while it waiting one talking about I'll knock out and fought wrong makes myself now what are they doing there is mine they're trying to bring fear trying to intimidate a person but if that man intimidated I want to beat you up I beat the other one already licked like fire looks like these if if you if you don't have a rebutter if you can see nothing at all it's lips again you don't defeat it in your mind already this man reckon recognize already he don't have over you because your mind weak so Jesus and The Garden of Gethsemane when this whole big crucial decision was before him and he's battling the humanistic realm of it it's possible that his cup passed he overcome in the spirit Realm I've had victory days when you lying on the track but true that had prevailed the addictionless means he had Victory and prayer so when they say weep he weeping for him he said A week for me he already conquered in his Spirit he was gonna boil my God while there forsaken me but he already conquered in spirit but he conquered in spirit everywhere you conquer before your God you have to conquer you have to feel like a conqueror you know your conqueror faith is the victory that could not conquer this world by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there's nothing can hurt you then you overcome you've got 50 miles of every room you're still in Freedom you who have been a drunkard and slave to Whiskey you will be a master over him then that's what we're talking about is the truth because God said so this is God speaking here God said he will be a master over what has been of you conquered by you will Master it everything that conquered you you're gonna conquer it God said so that the truth Lord truth Lord let's continue that old demo of alcohol that made you drink he's your master now but then when you get fit I don't mean make believe it real Faith he's yourself and them oh hallelujah what is faith faith is someone's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet is a revelation of the way of God oh Hallelujah so it's not ready it's not right to you an experience but in the spirit you have a revelation so Abraham didn't experience Isaiah the revelation of Isaac is that didn't come yet it took 25 years to see the fruit of that faith it took 25 years for Isaac to materialize but he had a fate he had a revelation he has something in his soul you don't have the experience of Isaac yet but inside the spirit is finished because God said so and that's the truth and then God said it is the truth to always can't lie it's got to come to pass Oh Glory of God I gotta continue to take over the runway they can't stop now Hallelujah I had to get to the speed and then pull back the stick I want to share testimony with you a little woman you can't lead them tobacco human and men when they come to a place where you can get to that spot to where you have to overcome my faith you master them are you a woman that's in present now she has been this she has been at this alter Time After Time After Time a good woman she started smoking a long time ago she just couldn't overcome it she had come up and I would pray with her seemed like she just couldn't overcome it the first thing you know I told her here I said there'll be danger down the road she said brother I've cried I have a bag you see that's just emotional he said just fight in the air that won't do any good so I get done pray with her lay hands on her she'll go back in a few days I'll meet her again just knock you down with cigarette smoke and still Brown and one night she went to the doctor began to get sick and withered away a little spiny thing doctor looked into her and said cancer smoking cigarettes Jesse was laying there today then she got onto business you see a drunken man will reach for a straw as long as you walk over to the church tonight no you can go to join a Methodist or Baptist as long as you can sit in here and say I'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me you you can't do nothing with you that's right but when you see your sins as God sees them in the light of his Bible when you see you repent or perish something will take place you'll get the business so she walked out here and someone around your heart doctor's back there raise up he said it's a heart attack you'll get the business now when she had got to get the business a woman sit and looking at me right now so the one was in church this was in church but the robber says back there Mr word sitting back there I believe in the truck and the Holy Spirit seemed to move us to go away to the knobs where she was at and when I got there she had a dream and when the Holy Spirit came into the room she got down to a real business she never smoked a cigarette from then on she had gained many pounds of weight and they can't find a trace of cancer what is it listen listen what is it it's feet that overcomes I want to get something out to you this is the prophet that pray for the woman not once over and over this is him constant her telling her and talking to her nothing happened hear what happened it's faith that overcomes Why didn't it overcome when I was praying for her there why answer she was just floating around but when the doctor says you got cancer you're going to die she got to business that's the way it has to get when you get the business why wait that long why not get down to business no put your faith in God what if the woman had had a faith in me imagine that she says this is big he said it would feel because I'm a man but when she changed her faith not in Ghana Tabernacle or in William Branham or anybody else but Prince of faith in Jesus Christ then she got faith [Applause] Church I can punches in some man at the point of Jesus Christ because that is the faith we are going to give it to Victory to overcome the world to begin the loss and praises foreign [Applause] [Music] this is Bible teaching this is the word of God Hold Us continue what if the woman had a faith in me it will fail because I'm a man when you change your faith not in downtown William Branham or anybody else but peace of faith in Jesus Christ then she got feet she raised up above all the fears and doubts and God healed her she overcome faith is the victory that overcomes real Faith knows no defeat I hear the bomb it cannot be defeated death itself can't defeat it [Applause] listen child's no defeat but Faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated it's the only way you can please God faith is impossible to please him oh Hallelujah so when Mata say even now Lord as they even know Hallelujah and he bought Lazarus Comfort the faith in Jesus Jesus he never thought that talk before

enjoy myself and pour it out in Eden God is the Perfection of perfection he knew all things before there ever was and therefore the infinite God could have looked forward and see the end from the beginning and he knew that he would have children on this Earth because you are a father a parent watch and tonight and the children does helpless through fellows who can't take care of themselves don't you struggle and work and do everything else to provide for your children because you are father or parent I will say the trueness and the thought of the empty parent and Parenthood originated in God because he was the first parent don't you think the god seen that Satan would be and what Satan would do he give to his children and provide it for them the best thing that could be validated for them knowing the enemy attack would be God fortified his children all right so you know whatever was coming and God in the beginning and gave his children the atomic weapon because he infinite God seeing there was going to be a conflict and it was going to be a battlefield God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of attack the right kind of everything they need

Lord this thing eating nice and my brother and greater will say and eaten nice Hallelujah I'm gonna find a place to close off here oh my God I want to skip something here param says that um someone asked a question who is this great Jehovah where did he begin he had no beginning he'll favor God and Eternity is one complete sickler has no end no there's a real true Spirit of love there's a real true Spirit of loyalty there's a very true Spirit of honesty and and and but that is God the very Fountain he said let us close our eyes to all imaginations for a few moments and go back before there was anything the great function of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy Spirit of honesty spirit of trueness in disperfection then out of the existence of the father when the logos which was the son which was a theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God when fought in a Celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and there the theophany which was God made into word then that he offer me was made flesh in the person of Christ Jesus then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in Him Father Son holy spirit all that and that's the very way we go Plumb back to the original beginning of God dear we are born again not of Flesh born again not of blood but Born Again by the spirit and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us then when we die from this life we go into the body which is every time that we deserve we have a team orphany into one a Celestial body then at the coming of the Lord Jesus this body is picked up from the Earth again and made into a glorified state to live in his presence forever then all provision all the things that was in provision goes out of existence flesh goes into punishment hell open up a mountain swallows it all the evil and provision and God and his beloved Church his bride takes their stand for the eternities to roll on there is the great hope of the Christian Church David said oh thy loving kindness is better than life no life everybody wants to think of life life the way life has appropriated expected it because that even life itself have a privated aspect many times people refer to life as having a big time drinking and going out this is life and the other day just this weekend four people died a crash and then the thing fell on them and put up the car and I was wondering first thing when I heard the news I say I wonder what time it was and where they're coming from when I looked they were coming with some fat or some kind of party whatever it is young people what a way to go no time to repent I wonder if they got time to repent oh and they've got time to make things right they shall be in church there shall be not serious see oh my so look at him this man that came to Abraham and vanished in his sight great patriarch Abraham thought face to face with God the same God get it not three people in the beginning was the same he was the great spirit I want to wrap up fountain with all trueness everything that was pure was in this Fountain and it became to form into a body the kind of body that we go to not a glorified body but an Angelic body that has shape and form and every time I see a tree the tree is the negative there's a positive somewhere or if I see a man listen I see a lovely Little Couple man and his wife music please walking down the street sweethearts together what does it reflect there is one in heaven that will never perish foreign Hallelujah let's continue this way of light that went forth was a way of love that's the main one the next color was blue and blue is trueness next was other colors to the seven perfect colors which is seven spirits of God that went from that great fountain that great Fountain and Diamond Jesus spoke about had become into a theophany Hallelujah so the fake function of Love projectile rainbow the rainbow becomes that he offered me and made it the image of a man he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh he was a theophany and Moses said I would like to see you and God hid him in the Rock and when he passed by Moses said it looked like the back part of a man that will come to pass and one day when Abraham was sitting in his tent God came to him in a body of Flesh will you find him here meet an Abraham before that in the order of Melchizedek a body of Flesh which was God he was God In the Flesh then brother Branham why would he have to come back and be born he wasn't born then he was just created a body that he dwelled in Melchizedek the king of Salem which is the king of Jerusalem which is the king of peace or end of life Jesus had good father and mother begin with days and end of life but he was made after the order of Manchester himself was Jehovah God the same one that met Abraham years later let's see why the Civil love walked up with Abraham and he says Abraham I'll tell you what I'm on my way to do we'll pick it up tonight don't you and Sarah and all what he's gonna do and as soon as he blessed Abraham he went back into space again a man that stood there had dust on his clothes a man not only that but he eat the Flesh of a calf that Abraham killed drink the milk from the cow eat some cakes and butt on it and turn talking to theophany again what was it why do we take a damn he had never been born like you and I but he had to be born in the flesh so he could throw that you're casting anything so the word became flesh to deal with Mr dead so when Jesus take that he free us from that so Paul could come after said that where is this thing because Jesus Took the sting out the debt whom we have believed he had me born a freshly could hold a stinger that was a created body that was a body just pulled the cash calcium and potassium to the Earth and that's the same thing melchester was he stepped into him in her body and walked from Beyond the Veil oh my hallelujah praise God I'm going to skip my Lord my Lord my Lord I'm going to skip something was praise let's pray now each one in your own way thanking God for what he's done I'll skip all the notes and come to the end he said oh Lord please Lord in the
