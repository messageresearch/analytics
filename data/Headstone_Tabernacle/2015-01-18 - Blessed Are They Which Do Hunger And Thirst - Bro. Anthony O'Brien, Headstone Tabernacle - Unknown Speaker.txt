element oh hallelujah there's something that we need there's something i require oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh say amen somebody isn't that right oh hallelujah like the witch young ruler isn't that right oh hallelujah he came before god he needed something he had a question he wanted an answer but nobody was able to answer maybe he went to the high priest maybe he went to the pharisees maybe he went to the sadducees but nobody could answer this question when he asked what shall i do to inherit eternal life they say pay your tithes this will do good things that's all that the pharisees could produce so that's all the answer that they could tell him hallelujah he went to this church he went to that church still couldn't find nobody he went to this group he went to that group he talked to this brother talked to this sister still couldn't find the answer that he was looking for and when he ran all the answers when he ran out of people to talk to when he ran out of social media to blog on oh here you come to jesus here he come to jesus he was the one who had the answer he was looking for shame and somebody and jesus is the one that has the answer we are looking for this morning oh only jesus has the answer i don't have the answer so don't look for me this morning but if you're looking unto him the ought and finish of your faith he has the answer for you this morning i am under his command just speak the words of life to you when you pull from the pill of fire and you watch god minister to you directly this is that season praise god hey man amen hallelujah oh my praise god isn't that right so here's a rich young ruler and he come before god jesus isn't that right calling him good master and jesus said why call me good hallelujah hallelujah oh he denounced himself for that title he humbled himself praise god that's the ministry of jesus christ they humble themselves before god hallelujah hallelujah is the father that worketh in me he is the one that do it the work jesus always talked that way he was the example seed son that we are to follow so when you see people being puffed up and high and mighty that's not jesus spirit oh hallelujah he was a humble one he is a meek one he is the lonely one oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is caught in simplicity yay man isn't that right it was a humble jesus praise go amen he said why call me good there's none righteous it's not right he said what yeah what do you have son what what what question they have for me praise god he said well i want to know how to interact eternal life amen amen he said well you know do it pay your tithes and do good things and so forth but somehow when when the rich young ruler looked at himself in the mirror it still didn't add up something was it wasn't clicking right something was lacking in a sip spirit isn't that right something was lacking in his system something was lacking in his soul oh hallelujah the word keep checking him he keep checking him he keep checking him even though he had all he was a rich young ruler isn't that right i don't know what business he owned and so forth but he was well off he had all his needs met but still something in his soul was not satisfied he wasn't satisfied with just coming to church he wasn't satisfied with having all that he had there was still something in his soul that he wanted that he wanted more than anything he was twisting for it he was hungering for it and nobody had the answer hallelujah and when he had received when god jesus finished talking to him isn't that right richard said all these i have obtained from my youth all these i've kept but what lack i yet and when he asked that question here come the love of god here come the holy spirit rushing down to meet his need hallelujah and now holy spirit went past his body spirit went past his flesh went past his mind hallelujah and saw that ache inside there hallelujah and saw that money spirit inside there it saw the thing that he was worshiping all the time he said go and sell all that you have hallelujah pick up your cross and follow me hallelujah but he couldn't do it he couldn't do it he couldn't come to the fountain such a sad thing many are called but but few are chosen oh thank god to be chosen this morning you are chosen of his this morning you come this far you can't turn back now no no no no don't let your heart overthrow you in this season praise god you get right with god you get next to god hallelujah hallelujah and if you know there's something in your soul that you need this morning

the world beyond this world what do you think happened they use science and sometimes the devil perverted isn't that right amen that natural things that god put inside of you amen and fill it with

praise god i was going to keep them from service they come and praise god why because there's a thirst inside your soul for more of god hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah and the prophet identified he said that the word first is a painful desire isn't that right let me read it here he said then i was looking i was thinking about that word this said so i looked it up in a dictionary to see what it means and here's what it what webster says says it's a painful desire a painful he said it's when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you oh hallelujah it's actually a mechanism that your body has in it to let you know that you need something to let you know that you want something is that right if you didn't have that mechanism in you you would die think about it if you didn't hunger if you didn't know what first was you would perish your body would wilt away slowly wilt away into bones hallelujah because you're not needing of anything you're not recognizing your need and so many people walking around not recognizing what they need not listening to that voice of hunger not listening to that painful cry of thirst that is burning in their soul isn't that right but it's satisfied with all kind of other things hallelujah and sometimes it just don't satisfy enough sometimes it'll only do only so much and no more hallelujah because god put that in there isn't that right isn't that right to hunger and thirst after a after him isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so he talks about natural tests isn't that right he says um he says now it's not an unnatural thing to tease he said this is a natural thing it's just simply something that god has given us that we could have a desire for something sometimes god also has given you he said a control tower something that sets inside of you that controls these different desires and this this control tower is what sits in man's heart is something that god give him to warn him of the desires that's needful for him isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah and if your control tower this morning it's controlled by a human spur by emotions oh daniel want this you want that grabbing for things hallelujah listen after the world your thirst tells what's inside of you controlling you isn't that right and if you have the holy ghost inside of you as a control tower you would want these things here you would want virtue you would want knowledge you would want temperance hallelujah hallelujah why because the holy spirit could only recognize the word isn't that right same man somebody that's the thing that is pulsating in you hallelujah then you'll draw positive things into you isn't that right hallelujah that love will come out of you peace will come out of you joy will come out of you why hallelujah because there's something inside of you this thing for more of god and producing those things isn't that right amen wonderful praise god so we're building up here this morning amen amen we're building up here this morning amen isn't that right my so he said now there's two different kinds of this he said there's a this physically and there is a thirst also spiritually isn't that right physical tools that's that mechanism we were talking about amen that's what that's what it's in the human body naturally hallelujah and you need that in order to survive otherwise you wouldn't know what you want hallelujah you wouldn't know what your body is needing or desiring at that time hardly a pain pain is a mechanism pain is needful if you don't feel pain you wouldn't know that something is wrong with you it's a mechanism that god put in you to feel pain isn't that right to let you know that something is wrong it's an alert system isn't that right signals going up and down your body letting you know that something is wrong hallelujah and your soul is sending out signals this morning it needs something it wants something it wants to go back before there was a moon before there was a star it wants to go back there there's something in your soul that is bursting forth bursting forth crying out crying out oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh it's that driving force it's what keeps you coming it what keeps you praying it will keep checking up on you i let you no no no no i can't go on like this i can't continue like this i need something i want something hallelujah i recognize what i lack i recognize what i have need of this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen amen hallelujah and god loves that god loves his children to cry that's god's provided way hallelujah when you recognize that first you cry out to the living god and say god i need you god i love you oh allah you are the only thing that can satisfy you oh hallelujah prophet said it yeah he said i'd like to read this said what david said again he said my soul fills for god for the living god oh the living god not a people god but the living god to see god living in you living moving breathing and an action in you caught in you healing the sick come on now go then you raise in the tear god and you loving the unlovable shame and somebody god and you forgiven praise god somebody you think you can't forgive but then god comes in there and he loves that person and you know it's not you that's god working his way out same and somebody glory to god hallelujah oh my hallelujah oh my praise god that's what we need in this hour that's what we need in this message we've seen too much spirit of man moving on the spirit of god the same spirit that dwells in a man called jesus he talked to the prostitutes he talked to the downtrodden he talked to the weary he ministered to them that were lost hallelujah he set them free we want that same jesus back on the scene again we want that jesus in the ministry we want that jesus in our brothers we want that jesus and our sisters lord let that jesus live in me is that your prayer this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah david wanted a living god i said before you can't get worn by a painted fire it has to be a real fire you have to feel the warmth nowadays they have this plasma screen television and i've seen it sometimes people turn on a dvd or i don't know what it is but it's a picture of a fire and they sit on they watch the fire and they eat tv dinner and i was like what is this so weird where technology is reached isn't that right they sit there looking at the fire to give them some kind of ambiance i don't know the turn of the lights but that's not really doing the trick if you need warmth you need a real fire to do it you need a fire right now you don't need yesterday's fire you don't need tomorrow's fire you need a fire right now say amen somebody there's a holy ghost not yesterday not tomorrow but right now right now right now that's what we need the holy ghost right now praise god in the church hallelujah every day

right now for my family right now praise god oh hallelujah holiday same and somebody shame and somebody oh my god praise god ye man hallelujah not some historical or something that happened some years ago or some tale that someone told he said but for the living god a god that's ever present and his soul fisted for that god not some historical something oh hallelujah we need a god right now hallelujah we need to be like peter that cake called beautiful that was god on the scene at that time at that moment hallelujah peter tasted in his soul he knew what he wanted but he just didn't know how holly he keeps struggling making mistakes falling get him back up follow christ for three and a half years i went back fishing but god knew the thirst that was in his soul he said peter i pray for you i pray for you that your faith fail not hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen and jesus prayed for you in saint john 17 that your faith would fail not he said i pray not for the world but for them which thou has sent me for they are mine and all mine are tired and i will be glorified in them there's a promise going out to you this morning read it believe it praise god oh hallelujah jesus already prayed for you praise god you are going to receive the holy ghost make no mistake in the matter you are not a mistake you are not an accident you are god's elect this morning oh hallelujah

days said receive you the holy scopes isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right breathe our promise upon them now peter had just enough fate isn't that right but that just enough fate to go up into the upper room but the brown said they were dry seeds but they hauled themselves up there waiting on the promise of god waiting on the holy spirit waiting on a pill of fire waiting on something that they know that they needed they were hungering they were thirsting but they were there tarrying they were there praying they were there seeking and then all of a sudden down come the holy spirit and fulfill the need in their heart jesus said after you converted strengthening prejudice here come peter's conversion in the form of the holy spirit the baptism of the holy ghost to do a work among the people to strengthen the bridge and hallelujah here come the spirit to confirm the word that god had pronounced over peter now right hallelujah now peter's filling the spirit he stood up on that day he was bold enough to say it he was bold enough to speak it because there was a fire in his soul what he was looking for what he was longing for god satisfied that indeed and peter stood up and said men in prison hallelujah these people are not drunk are you supposed but this is that that the prophet joel spoke about i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh praise god amen in other words that word that was spoken for so much hundreds of years this day this scripture is fulfilled hallelujah the same jesus was feeling peter saying the same thing doing the same works preaching to the people such as would be saved hey many many many many man isn't that right hallelujah and here was the same peter come walking down the gate called beautiful isn't that right they're still the lame man but here was living gospel he was a living god walking on two feet hallelujah what seemed like a sinner weeks ago but now the holy ghost the holy ghost took a hold of his heart and something got a hole of him he looked at the man he looked at the man and i'm sure he passed by that gate a long time before but this day was different this time was different this time it wasn't a painted fire it was a real fire and that real fire came alive in peter's soul and it was just a natural thing it was just so natural for peter he said i don't have silver and gold i don't have money but i have something i have a real living fire i have a living faith a living preacher living knowledge a living temperance a living god is a living he said get up and walk hallelujah he command the devil to run out he didn't ask no question he went forth and healed the sick praise god isn't that right the bible said his ankle bones receive strength oh hallelujah if you can't worship god this morning i pray your ankle bones receive strength by the living god that is in this place tonight glory to god hallelujah praise god amen amen amen get another shadow pray glory to god that living god is here this morning hallelujah with a living fire a living fire we don't want the call hallelujah we only want god of yesterday that's all fine we thank god for yesterday we thank god for what he has done but it ought to give us faith for what he is about to do now isn't that right hallelujah many many men hallelujah that god gives the control tower to you to give you to give to you the things that you need now the control tower is in you is what directs you and this thirst runs in on this uh control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking the control tower in the body and then the soul also there's a control tower in the body isn't that right he's explained it now he said that tells you the need that's needed in your body isn't that right and it's brought to you by thirst amen isn't that right he said also there's a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of isn't that right something in your spirit and you by this can tell what kind of life is controlling him isn't that right he honestly he said when you can see what your desires are then you can tell by that what kind of something that's in you that's creating that desire that you have see said there's a certain thing that you thirst for and it can tell you in your soul what a desire is by the nature of the cease that you have he said oh i hope he could understand that he said there's a control tower of the soul one for the body and each tower is warning uh is a warning caller for the needs of the other each one tells to the need of what the other is calling calling for it sends out a wave of warning isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah is that still small voice inside praise god hallelujah i tell you you need more of god isn't that right hallelujah honey it speaks to you praise god in the stillness in the quiet praise god already meditating on god when you begin to check up on his word and and watch yourself in the mirror of god's wound if you're going to recognize what it is you have need of that's something that control tower in your soul begins a call for god god put that control tower in there before the beginning before there was a moon before there was a star god put something inside of you to call for the spiritual things praise god down here on earth isn't that right he put it inside of you to hunger to thirst and he knew hallelujah hallelujah they would call for certain things that the world could never satisfy that's why you could never be satisfied with the things of the world that's why the things of the earth could never satisfy you money can't satisfy a house can't satisfy car can't satisfy praise god hallelujah because god put that thirst in there for god and god alone hallelujah in the throne room of your heart he wants to sit in there he wants to take up residence in there he wants to operate you isn't that right just like he did the first man in the beginning isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right adam in the beginning had need of nothing he had everything that he wanted he had a full garden full of fruits and vegetables and things and animals and everyone looked up to him my he was the king of his domain isn't that right everything that he had need of there was no sickness there there was no disease there just think about it a world with everything perfectly running smoothly amen god's son was in charge and he was a father of it all and god went to a rest isn't that right on the seventh day he rested isn't that right because everything was according to his control how everything was according to to how he wanted it amen isn't that right everything running smoothly and satan didn't like that picture at all hallelujah he got mad hallelujah hallelujah only decided to corrupt the thing he decided to deform hallelujah is that right god's perfect picture he decided to pervert it he decided to corrupt it so he slipped in a little interpretation isn't that right we all know the story here's adam going out to till the soil regular day ordinary day and eve is out in the garden doing things and so on and here come the sip and talking to eve and say what did the lord speak to you and so on hallelujah because god's not talking to me so i guess he told you something so let me hear what god said so i can twist it isn't that right that's what he did see she told him she said uh you shall eat have any other tree but not the tree of god uh tree of knowledge of good and evil he's and we should we should surely die he said no you shall not surely that holy right there he slipped in an interpretation maybe god wasn't right right here somewhere maybe it wasn't supposed to be this way what if god what if this what if that started asking little questions hallelujah hallelujah i started teasing out her intellect isn't that right honey on a human mind got to race in hallelujah until she forgot god's word entirely holy i was led down the wrong path oh hallelujah isn't that right an enticing spirit and in this season is how we have enticing spirits trying to tease at the bride trying to pick at you eve hallelujah trying to pick at your intellect maybe god wasn't right here somewhere maybe this didn't happen and maybe god does this and maybe this was that hallelujah trying to twist the word and spin ball it here try to spin it here or try to make some kind of praise god interpretation of god's word isn't that right hallelujah but you stay with the word holy and you shall not fall hallelujah hallelujah prophet said if a man stays with that word it's impossible to him to fall but what happened she didn't stay with the world she went with the devil's interpretation and lost the entire human race right there adam and the whole rest of it isn't that right an old man being in a comfort state of comfort state of luxury all that he wanted all that he needed they were so such in a blissful state they didn't even know that they were naked isn't that right such a presence such a love such a joy such a peace was surrounding them every day every hour every minute when they sleep live when they fell asleep it was there when they woke up in the morning it was there praise god what a condition oh and to think we're going back to that condition oh hallelujah a place with no bills to pay come on now place with no mortgage praise god hallelujah hallelujah a place where there's peace peace wonderful peace of god hallelujah hallelujah praise god you lay your head down you get up that piece is always there the holy ghost is always there oh you can have it right now oh hallelujah the holy ghost come down hallelujah praise god to put that peace in your soul the same peace that adam felt in the garden of eden he can put that peace in you this morning that peace hallelujah that love that goes on a little beyond understanding hey man isn't that right but all of a sudden this peace this love this joy that man felt every day day and day out one day it was all gone one day it was just disappeared from him the soft bear that god had created for him called eden was pulled out from under them and left nothing uncovered but rocks and stones wilderness deserts scorpions man destitute and afflicted man tormented isn't that right hallelujah because he was no longer satisfied hallelujah is driven already god is not right hallelujah but god swore by himself that he would restore hallelujah man back to his original condition because he would not have man to be dwelling like that all the time but god holla but the man went out of the garden is that right and for a long time he felt satisfied all of a sudden nothing satisfied he tilled the garden and tried to make a little produce here and plant some potatoes but still nothing satisfied he was in a falling condition and i believe he talked to adam and cain and abel adam would talk to them and so forth his two sons that would came come from eve isn't that right bible says so isn't that right and we're gonna talk to them and tell them what the garden of eden and tell them how he used to feel when he was there the blissful content oh hallelujah the canopy of rest oh the presence of life that was there oh words fail adam to describe to cain and evil what he felt in that garden hallelujah and they both loved it they both wanted it they both enjoyed the sermons they both enjoyed the testimonies they both shouted they both jumped they both praised god hallelujah but one had revelation and one did not isn't that right isn't that right hallelujah and here come cain and ava they've offered their sacrifice before god they had heard enough testimonies from adam now it is time to see hallelujah what you have to bring before god hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and here come cain with the fruits of the land here come cain with his good works here come cain with his good thinking here come gain with his intellect thinking that would appease god thinking that that would satisfy god and god turn it away and say no no no that cannot appease my anger that cannot appease my wrath i want something i need something more than that and here come evil with this sacrifice here come evil with a rugged sacrifice took a rugged rock praise god is not right cut that lamb open hear the blood come out oh hallelujah hallelujah on down come the blessings of god hey man god accepted that sacrifice isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right cain was right hallelujah god said look cain if you do what your brother do i bless you if you do what your brother do i love you still i'll bless your stir hallelujah you just have to do what your brother did you don't even have to understand it just do it and i'll bless you for it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh honey maybe you don't understand this morning but just do it full obedience will entitle you to the token hallelujah hallelujah you are promised to understand hallelujah hallelujah but just obey this morning oh hallelujah it's not right you watch god bless you you watch god fill you you watch god fill your way with love hallelujah but sometimes people just want to do what they want to do and cain just wanted to do what he wanted to do cain was angry can't kill his brother hallelujah isn't that right because he had a better interpretation in him what a spirit you know that's a spirit that's upon people today you think you love signs and wonders and that will be wonderful and great no no no they'll persecute you they'll call you bld just like they did jesus that's right they'll turn against you isn't that right hallelujah that's the spirit of king upon them to persecute the bride in this hour hallelujah but the bride will not be deceived holy the only love that will be found will be in that bride hallelujah hallelujah should be the only one to forgive she'll be the only one praise god with love and mercy going out it'll be mercy going out of her praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right but man was always unsatisfied unsatisfied with his works he wanted to do more you wanted to build more you wanted to get greater more powerful and the more he do is a is the more he wants and the more he wants is the more he do because he's not satisfied hallelujah there's a first in his soul and he don't know what it is and satan saw his opportunity at the fall of man to perfect the things that wasn't man with all kind of grieving images isn't that right with idols hallelujah having the people worshiping satan indirectly by grieving images and idols and so forth amen the hidden region and so forth isn't that right what was the devil doing amen replacing the gods things that god put in man with other things perverted things hallelujah things of the world hallelujah with the music and the fashion and the styles it's been so for years and years and years it's just gotten worse over the decades it's just gotten worse over the eons and centuries hallelujah but man always has a desire in his soul man is born of that desire he can't help it hallelujah he knows that there is something out there somewhere he knows that it's or something some of them can't put their finger on it but blessed are you this morning that to hunger and thirst after righteousness hallelujah there's a deep inside of your soul calling to a deep out there and there must be a deep to respond brother branham said for every question that you have in your heart there is an answer out there somewhere for it and if you want the holy ghost this morning there is a holy ghost out there somewhere in the atmosphere for you to receive or say man somebody or don't you bdc this morning go hallelujah there's that still small voice oh hallelujah burning in your soul burning in your heart putting in your spirit if you know you want more of god that's god calling you to his altar that's god calling you praise god god put that in there hallelujah and only god can satisfy it isn't that right isn't that right but ages and ages and centuries and kingdoms poor kingdoms rise man always had a desire man wanted love man wanted joy man wanted peace he wanted healing for his body he wanted healing for his soul this went on for years prophet come and prophet go king come and king go is that right in the days of israel and so many of them were not buried in the kings of the two in the tomb of the kings because they had fallen from the amen from from grace isn't that right many of them start off great and they end up contrary many of them start all powerful and rich and they end up contrary read the bible they're many kings hallelujah that they will not buried in the tomb of the kings holy the bible says so isn't that right holy they just couldn't come to it hardly a man couldn't keep the law all the lord did was expose the faults that were in man the cracks that were in man hallelujah but the law of grace was yet to come forth on the scene the law of grace a higher law a higher kingdom a higher power was yet to come forth hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah man knew what he wanted you wanted joy you wanted peace you wanted something in his soul he wanted something to abide you wanted something to keep him he wanted something to hallelujah praise god surround him hallelujah nothing could comfort nothing could satisfy isn't that right hallelujah even david cried out for it hallelujah all the patriots of all they cried out for this living god hallelujah hallelujah but only when jesus come hallelujah in the form of a babe oh hallelujah here was god it was all the mystery of god they're all the mystery of the father the mystery of his righteousness the mystery of his power the mystery of his love the joy that man was looking for the peace that man was looking for the holy ghost that man was looking for was now locked up in a little baby was now locked up in a name hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right god was mysterious there was no face to him there was no hand that we could hold there was no heart hallelujah there was nothing that we could pinpoint hallelujah there's nothing we could look to holly but they knew that this mysterious god he spoke to the pill of fire he spoke to a mystery and true cloud to fire and true wind hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but this god all the power that was in god was now veiling a man called christ hallelujah and all the joy that man was looking for all the peace that man was looking for all the rest that man was looking for

to go there no he needed to go there he had to be there he had an appointment to keep whatever business he was on this took up a section of his time because this was written in the books from before

by the whale for a little woman that was thirsty she was thirsty for something she didn't know what it was she had five men and the one that she was living up was not her own she even told jesus that she was honest but she had a thirst she had a hunger she had a need in a soul the pharisees called her prostitutes but they didn't understand the thirst that was in that woman but jesus do the this and she was only trying to satisfy it with natural desires but god so we pass the spirits way past the flesh and when inside that soul he saw something he saw a fist that was crying out crying out

he said god wants you to thirst for him isn't that right he said as the heart planted for the water bro my sword passed our thirst after thee oh god see he said now if that day was panting for the water brook he said what if somebody come along and say another buddy there very day talking to a friend a friend of the day would come along and say i'll tell you what i could do i know where there is a mud hole down there well the day i wouldn't want that see he wouldn't want he wouldn't do it wouldn't do any good and there's nothing that can satisfy that toast that is in the human being until god comes in he must have it or die and no person has a right listen to this to hush or satisfy that holy thirst that is in him by the things of the world no sir it's unguarded to do so and if you thirst for god don't shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book he said if you are thirsting for god in here this morning listen to this he said if you are thirsting for god he said there is only one thing to satisfy it he said and that's to meet god hallelujah so you didn't come to meet me this morning you come to me car because he's the only one that can satisfy that person inside of you oh hallelujah i can do it but he can do it this morning he can satisfy praise god the longing in the heart the longing in the soul isn't that right he said that meet god he said if you're thirsting for god that's the only way you can meet him is to do that he said take that blessed holy spirit that god placed a thirst in your soul to call for and you're satisfied with the nightclub somewhere he goes on and so forth he says uh how can you receive anything but that but eternal separation from the presence of almighty god when you made when he made you to this after him and david surrendered himself saying my soul is thirsting like i was in a dry and thirsty land uh where no water you see i first forgot the video god there you are david said i seen thee in my sanctuary and i sold my soul fills for that power oh hallelujah the living god the power of god in the sanctuary david was thirsting for it holly on heart what we to be fishing for it in this hour

be in the end oh hallelujah many shall run to and fro knowledge shall increase but this gospel must be preached until the end shall come how is the gospel preached not in word only but in signs wonders and miracles hallelujah so there must be a mighty display of dynamics to vindicate the message that we have received from malachi 4. there must be there must be a mighty visitation a mighty

heart for him oh same and somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh i'm almost finished praise god hallelujah you said you can begin to come forward amen oh stay in the spirit friends hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah look at the prodigal son look at the particle son he was living a good life in his father's house and everything was going good all of a sudden he craved power he wanted money he wanted to do what he wanted to do he said daddy give me what give me give me what i want give me what's coming to me i want my inheritance i don't want it now the father knew that he wasn't ready for it but he gave it to him anyway he got power without character give me give him a little short run say you go ahead i'll meet you in the morning hallelujah hallelujah give him his inheritance and the son went out running and he started off real good he started off real well hallelujah he was investing his money and doing good things but all of a sudden he got into the good life he got into the fast lane began to see the bright lights oh hallelujah i began to get distracted oh isn't that right and slowly and slowly little by little it didn't happen right away but it started to break him down break him down he started to compromise here he started to break down a little bit there played something softly he started to wane away a bit his feet began to wander away he was accustomed to eating nice food and all of a sudden he went down to a kind of mediocre life and it slowly began to dwindle until he ended up in positive poverty he ended up in destitution he ended up in affliction he ended up in a place where he was not supposed to be at because that's not what he was accustomed to but slowly the run took a toll on him oh honey until he ended up eating pig food isn't that right got a job in one of those farmer places decided to start eating pig food because that was all he could get to eat and then all of a sudden i could imagine that prodigal son was sitting in that condition poverty stricken broken messed up tattered and torn all dirty and muddied up he started to look like a pig he started to smell like the pigs he began to eat what the pigs was eating or what a condition and he sat there and i could believe that he began to think about the life he used to have and the blessings that he used to have in in his father's house and i could imagine man oh hallelujah when we think about what adam had when you think about what glory is that lies beyond this riven veil oh what god wants to do hallelujah what god wants to restore us to friends oh hallelujah i believe that that son we're gonna sit there and we're gonna think about it he said wait a minute he said this don't make sense somehow the pig food doesn't satisfy me somehow what i'm eating what i'm partaking of right now it does not satisfy me i'm not accustomed to this this isn't the life that god wants for me that son got an epiphany he got a sudden moment of realization he rose up he said i will go to my father's house i'm gonna go back to the place where i was at the beginning i feel like starting all over again i don't mind being a servant i don't mind being a doormat but i'd rather be a doormat in the house of my god than a king in a tent of the wicked and that sun rose up one day you could begin to stand up right now on your feet that son rose up and that son went to walking that son walked past oh many hills many valleys but you know the great thing about this story is that the father never stopped looking the day that that son left he built a special chair and he sat out on the front porch i'm pretty sure every hour every day looking out for his son and all of a sudden all of a sudden what seemed like years only in a moment the sun broke the corner started walking up home he was all tattered he was torn he was broken he was in need but guess what he was still a son he was still the father son even though he had run out in here even though he had failed even though he had fallen short but there was a thirst in his soul he knew what he wanted he knew that the world can satisfy no more he wanted to go back to the place oh friend do you want to go back to the place this morning that the father has for you do you want to go back to that place this morning where god's virtue where god's power is reaching out to you where's healing virtue is flowing bound by that river hallelujah where healing waters flow where you could meet every knee oh hallelujah we could wade over your soul where the holy spirit could wash over you oh
