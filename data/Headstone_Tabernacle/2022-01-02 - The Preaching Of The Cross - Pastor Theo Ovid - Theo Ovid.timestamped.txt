[35:30] least the cross of christ should be made
[35:32] of non-effect for the preaching of the
[35:35] cross is to them that perish foolishness
[35:38] but unto us which are saved it is the
[35:40] power of god for it is written i will
[35:42] destroy the wisdom of the wise and will
[35:45] bring to understanding nothing
[35:47] understanding i will bring to
[35:49] understanding
[35:50] i i will bring to nothing the
[35:53] understanding of the prudent where is
[35:55] the wise where is the sky where is the
[35:57] disputer of this world had not god made
[36:00] foolish the wisdom of this world for
[36:03] after that in the wisdom of god the
[36:05] world by wisdom knew not god it pleased
[36:07] god by the foolishness of preaching to
[36:10] save them that believe
[36:12] for the jews require a sign in the greek
[36:14] seeker after wisdom but we preach christ
[36:17] christ is crucified unto the jews a
[36:19] stumbling block unto the greeks
[36:21] foolishness but under them which are
[36:24] called and both jews and greeks christ
[36:27] the power of god
[36:29] and the wisdom of god because the
[36:31] foolishness of god is wiser than men
[36:33] the weakness of god is stronger than men
[36:36] for you see your calling
[36:38] brethren how that not many wise men
[36:42] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[36:45] noble are called but god had chosen the
[36:48] foolishness of the world to confront the
[36:50] wise god had chosen the weak things of
[36:52] the world to confront the things which
[36:54] are mighty the bastions of the world and
[36:56] the things which are despised had god
[36:59] chosen ye and things which are not
[37:02] to bring to naught
[37:04] things that are
[37:05] that no
[37:07] flesh should glory
[37:09] in his presence
[37:11] hallelujah that no flesh should glory in
[37:14] his presence i don't want to turn to
[37:16] luke chapter 9
[37:20] and you want to read verse 23
[37:26] jesus and he said unto them all
[37:29] if any man will come after me
[37:32] let him deny himself
[37:34] and take up his cross daily
[37:37] and follow me let's pray one more time
[37:38] father we thank you for your scriptures
[37:40] and your word and i pray that this be an
[37:43] anchor point for this year
[37:45] this service lord may be a turning point
[37:47] in lives of many here and those who
[37:49] connected to us in jesus and we ask it
[37:52] amen our name and god bless you may be
[37:54] seated
[37:54] we thank god for it being 20 22.
[37:58] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[38:01] so today i have a title the preaching of
[38:05] the cross
[38:06] that's the title i have the preaching
[38:08] of the cross
[38:10] i have an inspiration
[38:12] wearing his garment of sacrifice and
[38:14] debt
[38:15] to the things of the of this world
[38:18] that's the inspiration wearing his
[38:20] garment of sacrifice and debt
[38:23] to the things
[38:24] of this world
[38:27] with this virus affecting and infecting
[38:30] individuals around the world
[38:33] we can see that everything is being
[38:35] shaped
[38:37] reshaped
[38:38] or being fixed for the coming of the
[38:40] lord
[38:42] it's like the whole world system is
[38:43] being
[38:44] recalibrated for the coming of the lord
[38:47] and the prophet said the angel of the
[38:49] lord is on it now
[38:51] fixing things around
[38:53] for the coming of the lord
[38:56] is as if everything is being
[38:57] recalibrated
[38:59] a recalibration is to correct
[39:02] or to adjust the gradations or settings
[39:05] on a measuring instrument
[39:08] or sensor or other pieces of precision
[39:12] equipment
[39:14] recalibrate means to re-examine one's
[39:16] thinking
[39:18] a plan
[39:19] a system of values
[39:21] and correct it in accordance to new
[39:24] understanding or purpose
[39:26] this is amen so this is what
[39:29] recalibration is
[39:31] and you know the bible says except god
[39:33] cut the day short
[39:34] no flesh shall be saved
[39:36] so he has to cut the day short
[39:39] for the electic
[39:41] the discussion for who the elect
[39:45] so this world
[39:47] is being recalibrated
[39:49] for armageddon
[39:51] for the third world war
[39:53] for the great tribulation
[39:55] for the great earthquake
[39:57] and the rapture
[39:58] oh glory to god and only the holy
[40:01] ghost-filled bride
[40:02] goes in the rapture
[40:04] the rest have to contend with
[40:06] the great tribulation the great
[40:08] earthquake the third world war
[40:11] armageddon that's what the rest have to
[40:13] contend with but only the holy ghost
[40:16] phil bride
[40:17] goes in the rapture
[40:19] so press on brethren
[40:21] to receive the holy ghost
[40:23] the holy ghost itself
[40:24] what god expects what god require the
[40:28] measuring line that god alone could set
[40:31] and he has said that oh blessed be the
[40:34] name of the lord
[40:36] now the preaching of the cross as we
[40:38] titled it
[40:39] is very unique and distinctive
[40:42] to the apostle paul
[40:43] he of all persons
[40:45] keep hitting this thing called the cross
[40:48] and we don't hear much about it now but
[40:50] it's still there in the world isn't that
[40:52] right
[40:53] this was the gospel he preached that
[40:56] christ died for our sins and rose from
[40:59] the dead
[41:00] from all for our salvation
[41:02] and even when jesus peter on the day of
[41:04] pentecost they're going to preach they
[41:05] say what shall we do to be saved after
[41:08] jesus peter was explaining to them this
[41:10] man jesus
[41:11] that they have crucified with wicked
[41:13] hands god had raised from the dead
[41:15] so this gospel of the cross is a very
[41:18] powerful thing
[41:19] that we have to understand why this
[41:21] thing called the cross
[41:23] and you know people like to talk about
[41:25] how the prophet said there they
[41:26] crucified him the effect of the word and
[41:28] if guys this cross we're talking about
[41:30] is a distant foreign it is not
[41:33] this cross is why we are here today
[41:36] because the cross answered the sin
[41:39] question
[41:40] and that is still the question today
[41:42] the sin question i'm not talking about
[41:44] sin is doing bad things i'm talking
[41:46] about sin and unbelief
[41:49] and what god have said
[41:51] so you are challenged to come out of sin
[41:54] or come out of unbelief to believe
[41:56] exactly what god have said there's going
[41:58] to be a rapture god said so there's
[42:00] going to be revival god said so you are
[42:02] gonna be delivered god said so you're
[42:04] gonna be filled with the holy ghost god
[42:06] said so you're gonna be healed god said
[42:08] so you have to believe what god said not
[42:10] your feelings not your emotions not what
[42:12] somebody tell you you have to believe
[42:14] what god said oh glory to god hallelujah
[42:18] praise god blessed be the name of the
[42:19] lord
[42:21] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise
[42:25] god like somebody said something to me i
[42:26] think i said it before you have a legal
[42:28] issue you go to a lawyer you believe
[42:30] what a lawyer said isn't that right
[42:32] hallelujah you want to build a house you
[42:33] go to architect is that the expert in it
[42:35] no when you're when you know about
[42:37] sickness and disease they're not going
[42:38] to the doctor they go to the internet
[42:41] seek another advice but if you want to
[42:43] know what has happened in the world
[42:44] today you go to the word
[42:46] you don't go to no praise god because
[42:48] this gospel is foolishness to them that
[42:51] perish
[42:52] the preaching of the cross is
[42:54] foolishness to them that perish so don't
[42:57] let no perishing person advise you oh
[42:59] give the lord i shall hear what i said
[43:02] don't let no perishing person advise you
[43:06] glory to god but to us who believe it's
[43:10] the power of god all glory is the word
[43:12] of god it's god himself
[43:15] hallelujah praise god praise god
[43:22] first corinthians 15
[43:24] hear our apostle paul
[43:28] like that our apostle paul
[43:30] who's age messenger
[43:33] moreover brethren i declare unto you the
[43:35] gospel which i preach unto you which
[43:37] also you have received and wherein you
[43:40] stand by which also you are saved if you
[43:43] keep in memory what i preach unto you
[43:46] unless you are believed in vain for i
[43:49] delivered unto you first of all that
[43:51] which i also receive that christ died
[43:54] for our sins according to the scripture
[43:56] and that he was buried that he rose
[43:58] again on the third day according to the
[44:00] scripture so this was paul gospel so
[44:03] when you're here i preach what paul

[44:17] will cling to that old rugged cross oh
[44:20] glory to god i would stay at the cross
[44:22] at the cross at the cross where i first
[44:25] saw the light and the burdens of my
[44:27] heart roll away it was there by faith i

[44:46] they are sinners just like all of us
[44:49] believing for god for god's mercy and
[44:51] grace in his very hour as we say the
[44:53] same god that put man in power to stick
[44:55] man out of power
[44:56] same god
[44:58] the same god promised to bring them over
[44:59] the mighty and the same god judge them
[45:01] and they perish in the wilderness same
[45:02] god
[45:03] not a different god just a god we serve
[45:05] he's a god to keep his word whatever he
[45:07] says
[45:10] he's a god that keeps his word he must
[45:12] keep his word to you or do you believe
[45:14] that today
[45:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[45:21] let's go back again the scripture we
[45:22] read first corinthians 1 21 said for
[45:24] christ
[45:26] sent me not to baptize
[45:28] but to preach the gospel
[45:30] how how
[45:32] not with the wisdom of words please
[45:35] the cross of christ should be made of
[45:37] non-effect
[45:39] hallelujah and is he amplified and we're
[45:41] going to read an amplified here for
[45:42] christ the messiah set me up not to
[45:45] baptize but to evangelize by preaching
[45:48] the glad tizen the gospel and that not
[45:51] with verbal eloquence at least the cross
[45:54] of christ shall be deprived of force and
[45:57] emptied of its power and rendered vein
[46:00] fruitless void of value and of no effect
[46:03] oh glory to god this cross have to have
[46:05] an effect in your life before you
[46:07] condemn somebody look at the cross
[46:09] before you accuse somebody look at that
[46:11] cross before you hold your arse and
[46:12] grudge you look at that cross he
[46:14] pardoning you why you can't pardon
[46:16] others he forgives you why you can't
[46:18] forgive others he'd drop your hearts and
[46:20] drop your charges against you while you
[46:21] can't drop it against others come on now
[46:23] pump with me right right this morning we
[46:25] in the gospel there's the gospel that
[46:27] paul preached a gospel of repentance of
[46:30] gospel of making things right you can't

[46:34] the devil with your husband you're mean
[46:36] like the devil with your wife you're
[46:37] mean like the devil with your brothers
[46:39] and sisters and you can't make things

[46:46] truth is not in us but if we confess our
[46:48] sins come on now peace back to me he is

[47:24] let's continue verse 18 number five for
[47:26] the story and message of the cross is
[47:28] sheer absurdity and folly to those who
[47:32] are perishing and on their way to

[47:54] you'd have no paradise you know as in
[47:56] the catholic church you had a good day
[47:57] to get that

[51:39] learning that's why peter was ignorant

[54:58] oh glory to god hallelujah
[55:01] but jesus knew where he was going
[55:03] he know where the three wise men bought
[55:05] gold frankincense and myrrh it was
[55:07] gordon's service to die you know his
[55:09] destination you know his purpose he knew
[55:11] his purpose i knew he was heading along
[55:13] to calvary along the way he fed the five
[55:15] thousand along the way he took five
[55:17] loads and two fishes and multiplied
[55:19] along the way he turned water into wine
[55:21] along the way he raised the dead along
[55:23] the way he cast out devils along the way
[55:26] healed the sick but he had a destination
[55:28] to get to the cross because the cross
[55:31] will do something for you and the cross
[55:32] must do something for him look at the
[55:34] lord and shout now we're getting excited
[55:36] you didn't think about that right
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:41] the cross
[55:43] wasn't only to do something for you
[55:46] and us
[55:47] and sin
[55:49] the cross was to do something for jesus
[55:52] it was to give jesus
[55:54] access
[55:56] to the book of names
[55:58] that was sealed
[55:59] since it slipped out the hands of adam
[56:02] all the names
[56:03] of the sons of god
[56:05] that was sealed in that book
[56:07] and the mighty angel said who is where
[56:09] they're to take the book and to loose
[56:12] the seals thereof and the only way it
[56:14] could be done no glory to god the only
[56:17] way
[56:18] it could be done is by the cross
[56:21] through the cross at calvary that is
[56:25] where you pay the price to access the
[56:27] book to call your name and if you never
[56:31] shouted before this ought to give you a
[56:34] shout in your soul
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:39] [Music]
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:45] [Music]
[56:47] where is the investigator
[56:49] the logic under the data
[56:51] of this person time
[56:53] and age has not god shown up the
[56:55] nonsense
[56:56] and the folly of this world's wisdom
[56:59] for when the world with all his earthly
[57:00] wisdom failed to perceive and recognize
[57:03] and know god by means of his own
[57:05] philosophy god in his wisdom
[57:07] was pleased
[57:08] through the foolishness of preaching
[57:11] salvation procured by christ
[57:13] and to be had through him to save those
[57:16] who believe who clung and who trusted
[57:18] him we lied to him
[57:20] for the jews they manually asked for
[57:22] signs and miracles
[57:23] and the greek pursue philosophy and
[57:25] wisdom
[57:26] but we preach christ
[57:28] the messiah crucified
[57:30] preaching which to the jews is a scandal
[57:33] an offensive stumbling block that
[57:34] springs a snail trap
[57:36] unto the gentiles it is absurd and
[57:38] utterly unfair on philosophical nonsense
[57:42] but to those who are called
[57:44] whether jew and gent or gentile
[57:47] christ is the power of god
[57:49] and the wisdom of god
[57:51] oh glory to god this is because the
[57:54] foolish thing that has its source in god
[57:57] is wiser than men
[57:59] and the weak things that springs from
[58:01] god is stronger than men
[58:03] for simply consider your own call
[58:05] brethren that many of you were
[58:07] considered to be wise
[58:09] according to human estimates and
[58:11] standards not many influential and
[58:13] powerful not many of high noble birth no
[58:16] for god selected deliberately choose
[58:19] what in the world is foolish to put the
[58:22] wise to shame and what the world calls
[58:24] weak to put the strong to shame and god
[58:27] also selected deliberately chose what in
[58:30] the world is low-born and insignificant
[58:32] and branded and treated with contempt
[58:34] even the things that are nothing that he
[58:36] might be posed and bring to nothing the
[58:38] things that are
[58:39] so that no mortal man should have
[58:41] pretense for glory and boast in the
[58:44] presence of god
[58:46] oh but it is from him that you have your
[58:48] life in christ jesus whom god had made
[58:51] our wisdom from god revealed to us as
[58:54] knowledge and so on like that as is
[58:55] written let him who boasts
[58:58] oh glory god and proudly rejoice rejoice
[59:01] and glory boasts in the glory in the
[59:02] lord so our bow is supposed to be in the
[59:05] cross
[59:07] not how the church is and not how this
[59:08] is and we have the best pastor and we
[59:10] have the best church and best this no no
[59:12] that's not my foolishness god doing
[59:13] condemn things
[59:14] your books have to be in the cross
[59:20] who appointed the individual to the
[59:22] cross who's the first person that did
[59:23] that
[59:25] the first
[59:26] person that did that
[59:28] saint john 12
[59:30] speaking but the greeks came to jesus
[59:33] and
[59:34] he said and there were greeks among them
[59:35] i came to worship at the feast the same
[59:37] came to philip which is of bethesda
[59:40] fellow commentary andrew
[59:42] and again andrew and philip tell jesus
[59:44] and jesus answered so them say they come
[59:46] to this disciple and say so so we will
[59:48] see jesus we want to get into we want to
[59:49] talk to him we want to see him
[59:51] and jesus answered them saying they
[59:53] always come
[59:55] that the son of man should be glorified
[59:57] jesus already informed that them two
[59:58] guys already want to see him right
[1:00:00] this is jesus response
[1:00:03] verily verily i said to you
[1:00:04] except the corner will fall into the
[1:00:06] ground and die to abide alone but if it
[1:00:08] dies bring it forth much fruit amen do
[1:00:11] you know what jesus did right
[1:00:12] he is the one that pointed them to the
[1:00:14] cross
[1:00:15] he is yeah he can say i am jesus look me
[1:00:17] here where do you want to know hello
[1:00:18] brethren god bless you god bless you no
[1:00:20] you say you want to see me
[1:00:22] go to calvary
[1:00:23] you want to see me die
[1:00:26] you want to see me go to the cross that
[1:00:27] is what he did there
[1:00:29] a true disciple would take you
[1:00:32] into his presence
[1:00:33] those disciples didn't call him assad
[1:00:34] and said let me show you my revelation
[1:00:36] you know i dreamed last night no he did
[1:00:37] this happens then go there when he they
[1:00:39] asked to see jesus they brought him
[1:00:41] straight into christ's
[1:00:43] presence
[1:00:44] all right now listen to this now you see
[1:00:46] he pointed them here to his presence
[1:00:48] christ pointed them to the truth he said
[1:00:51] how to see him was to go to the cross
[1:00:53] there is ways at the cross except
[1:00:55] economic falls that dies and buys alone
[1:00:57] and it will bring forth abundance if it
[1:00:59] falls into the ground first it has to be
[1:01:01] a germanized green you take a wheat how
[1:01:03] could one grain or wheat here what
[1:01:04] happens one grain falls in bring forth
[1:01:06] 100 greens 100 grain falls in bring
[1:01:08] forth a thousand green a thousand green
[1:01:10] falls in bring forth a million greens
[1:01:12] what he meant is this if i live my life
[1:01:15] alone
[1:01:15] and die this way
[1:01:17] i just live my life alone well there'll
[1:01:19] be no fruit after me but if i fall into
[1:01:22] the ground this is christ now under the
[1:01:24] will of god i'll bring forth a new birth
[1:01:27] and in that new birth it will bring
[1:01:29] forth another new birth
[1:01:31] and another new birth until the whole
[1:01:33] world will be missionary
[1:01:35] the gospel preached this gospel will be
[1:01:37] preached in all the will for witness and
[1:01:39] then the end shall come
[1:01:40] so this cross and this debt and this
[1:01:42] going on to the ground was actually to
[1:01:44] produce the new birth
[1:01:46] because that is what it's about the
[1:01:48] evidence that christ has risen it's good
[1:01:50] to say he died and he rose again but
[1:01:52] where's the evidence the evidence has to
[1:01:54] be a new bit
[1:01:56] or a new life
[1:01:57] not your natural birth
[1:01:59] not what your five cents is feeding on t
[1:02:02] and t smell touch and whatnot that is
[1:02:03] the contact here the faith that god put
[1:02:06] in your soul in your heart is the
[1:02:08] contact above
[1:02:09] oh glory to god so god wants to baptize
[1:02:12] you into that faith
[1:02:13] into that power into that presence that
[1:02:16] give you a dual position then you're
[1:02:18] accessing natural and accessing the
[1:02:21] spirit source
[1:02:22] accessing god
[1:02:24] hallelujah amen
[1:02:26] so that if we know ourselves in our
[1:02:28] ministry in our thoughts and in our life
[1:02:30] if we are biters we are we can do no
[1:02:33] good we have got to die at the altar now
[1:02:36] you see what i preach in here and when
[1:02:38] you say amen and punctuate everything we
[1:02:39] say here once is the word come and say
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:42] hallelujah when you say die say amen to
[1:02:45] that because you have to unless you
[1:02:47] prepare for the armageddon tribulation
[1:02:50] great earthquake
[1:02:51] hallelujah
[1:02:53] if you want to prepare for that you know
[1:02:54] what i say amen you could keep
[1:02:55] continuously but if you want to make it
[1:02:57] a rapture you have to say amen to this
[1:02:59] because this is the process to get to
[1:03:01] there oh glory to god amen do you
[1:03:03] believe that
[1:03:05] now if we
[1:03:06] if we are bad as we are we can do no
[1:03:08] good
[1:03:09] we have got to die at the altar or we
[1:03:11] will live alone
[1:03:12] we will lift to some denomination or
[1:03:13] some creed we lifted some organization
[1:03:15] there's a lot of people tied to the
[1:03:16] church tied to the group they can't go
[1:03:18] nowhere else
[1:03:20] some of them pin them home they can't go
[1:03:22] to another church because they see down
[1:03:24] that whatever church they're going to he
[1:03:25] dies heaven
[1:03:28] so if they have to go back they gotta go
[1:03:29] right back to him
[1:03:31] and that's a life on a picture head
[1:03:32] direct from hell
[1:03:33] someone believed in marriage to the
[1:03:34] pastor could you imagine that
[1:03:37] and i'll tell you all the time i have
[1:03:38] one wife her name is admiral i could

[1:05:35] if you approach things the same way all
[1:05:36] the time you can get the same results
[1:05:38] you know to get different results like

[1:05:56] inside of that
[1:05:58] at least do something different
[1:06:00] and this is what i'm here to challenge
[1:06:02] you
[1:06:03] to think differently to approach life
[1:06:05] differently let 21 die with your phrase
[1:06:08] your faults your failures your mistakes
[1:06:11] your horrible behavior let it die
[1:06:14] say satan you ain't catching me this
[1:06:15] year oh glory to god

[1:06:21] i got my own revival
[1:06:23] oh give the lord a shout my god
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:28] listen if we ourselves in our ministry
[1:06:30] in our thoughts in our life if we are
[1:06:32] bad as we are we can do no good we have
[1:06:34] got to also die at the also who is
[1:06:36] talking about ministry ourselves church
[1:06:39] everybody
[1:06:40] so so ministers not uh exempt from this
[1:06:43] word ministers rather die that means the
[1:06:45] biggest the death penalty big out for
[1:06:47] the man
[1:06:48] that means they want to die first
[1:06:52] some minister don't they didn't know
[1:06:54] what that channel didn't know what you
[1:06:54] only got over them people taught in the
[1:06:56] bible call them as man of god
[1:07:02] they're trying to re-establish the
[1:07:03] priesthood
[1:07:06] avid on my nose here he said when when
[1:07:08] in our mind they're dying nothing up
[1:07:09] there
[1:07:10] they're just dead sometimes the dead
[1:07:12] people know that they're
[1:07:16] when christ died something happened you
[1:07:17] know
[1:07:18] he's the only man that happened to him
[1:07:20] the sun refused to shine veil every
[1:07:23] temperament from the top to the bottom
[1:07:25] all kinds of things had to happen in our
[1:07:26] graves had a shake
[1:07:28] god this man died
[1:07:30] oh glory to god when that veil ran from
[1:07:32] the top of the bottom god exposed the
[1:07:34] whole priesthood thing god killed that
[1:07:37] god did that right there and give direct
[1:07:39] access to whosoever will oh oh god help
[1:07:42] me this morning you hear that
[1:07:46] so when them watching christ listen
[1:07:48] christ
[1:07:48] monk on the mountain mon calvary the
[1:07:51] cross is there
[1:07:53] the solar said truly this is the son of
[1:07:54] god and thunders and lightning and
[1:07:58] darkness and so on like that but in the
[1:08:00] temple nice far from there you know veil
[1:08:03] rent
[1:08:04] nobody knows system come from the god
[1:08:06] make sure it come from the top to the
[1:08:07] bottom they know it wasn't man do that
[1:08:10] so god doing something symbolic
[1:08:13] that veil represent most holy place that
[1:08:16] they'll represent holy priests high
[1:08:18] priest going in once a year that they'll
[1:08:20] represent where god was dwelling behind
[1:08:23] in patchaka skin for hundreds of years
[1:08:26] that veil is where the cornerstone of
[1:08:28] their religion was at and god rip it
[1:08:30] down because he was no longer dear lord
[1:08:33] give the lord a shout his spirit was
[1:08:36] about to be released at calvary at the
[1:08:39] cross oh that's why paul could preach
[1:08:41] the cross the way he did because the
[1:08:43] spirit was going to be released
[1:08:46] all glory to god and giving access to
[1:08:48] jew or gentiles
[1:08:50] [Applause]
[1:08:52] listen listen guys when peter went to
[1:08:54] columbia's house and because god sent a
[1:08:56] vision to peter to go to cornelia's
[1:08:58] house and while peterson respected where
[1:09:00] the holy ghost fell that shock peter god
[1:09:02] didn't tell peter what he was gonna do
[1:09:04] but the holy ghost fell he said wait a
[1:09:06] minute this is not a jew thing no no
[1:09:08] it's not a shooting it's jew and gentile
[1:09:10] the holy ghost fell on pete on cornelius
[1:09:13] be it done unto me oh glory to god while
[1:09:16] period speak these words
[1:09:18] that gentile heart was ready and he had
[1:09:20] baptized yet that gentile heart was
[1:09:22] ready he was a forgiving person he was a
[1:09:25] person giving thanks given praise he was
[1:09:28] a worshiper he was a prayer warrior he
[1:09:30] had a sincere heart and he had come to
[1:09:32] church once yet but he was ready when
[1:09:35] the word began to go forth the spirit of
[1:09:37] god pick up the word out of the mouth of
[1:09:40] peter oh who was an angel of god who
[1:09:43] glory to god and the spirit baptized
[1:09:46] cornelius and he's the same yesterday
[1:09:48] and forever oh glory to god there'll be
[1:09:50] one more ride there'll be one more ride
[1:09:53] out of the mouth of men holy coast go
[1:09:56] glory to god
[1:09:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:00] hallelujah so if you want to see him
[1:10:03] listen
[1:10:04] we must realize
[1:10:06] that we have got to die
[1:10:08] in order to bring forth new life
[1:10:10] so he said much in this if you want to
[1:10:11] see me you must die die to yourself
[1:10:14] and you bring forth new life and if you
[1:10:16] want to see him if you ever expect to
[1:10:18] see him you will never see him by
[1:10:20] joining a church or some book of laws
[1:10:23] that you keep or some creed that you
[1:10:24] serve you will see him when you die
[1:10:27] why it is that the ministers are lying
[1:10:29] to the people when you believe what they
[1:10:31] teach
[1:10:32] that you're going to live
[1:10:34] that's the new boot
[1:10:35] that's why paul said have you received
[1:10:38] since you believe
[1:10:40] paul asked a question
[1:10:41] that's part of what paul preached have
[1:10:43] you received the holy ghost and you
[1:10:44] believe because the spirit was not yet
[1:10:46] given when christ did not die has that
[1:10:49] had not yet died they had to wait for
[1:10:51] the titular dying for the spirit to be
[1:10:53] released christ told them if i don't go
[1:10:55] the comforter will not come so he knew
[1:10:57] he was with them but his spirits have to
[1:10:59] come in them so having him
[1:11:02] with them as a comforter oh god jesus
[1:11:04] look at jesus that can work that way
[1:11:06] tell peter get behind me satan that
[1:11:08] can't work because he was with them for
[1:11:10] a purpose he was with them to introduce
[1:11:12] them to promises as he was on his way to
[1:11:14] the cross to pay the price and make this

[1:12:13] and are crucified to yourself
[1:12:15] then you will see jesus

[1:15:50] church here we go
[1:15:52] not in a building not in a creed not in
[1:15:56] good works but in the cross
[1:15:58] where you are crucified with him that is
[1:16:00] where you find christ you refine him by
[1:16:03] doing better by turning a new page
[1:16:05] starting a new life you don't find
[1:16:06] christ you find christ only in debt
[1:16:09] not in a manger not in a confession not
[1:16:12] to believe a certain creed and fable you
[1:16:15] don't find christ there
[1:16:17] that's why all the people that believe
[1:16:18] all what they believe over the years
[1:16:20] they find itself still lacking christ
[1:16:22] still lacking forgiveness and grace and
[1:16:24] love and forgiveness and balls of
[1:16:26] compassion and mercy is still empty the
[1:16:28] head full but the heart empty

[1:18:43] hallelujah
[1:18:50] you see
[1:18:51] you see um
[1:18:53] he said well you see but abram we learn
[1:18:55] it through the art of the bible no we
[1:18:57] don't if we learn it to the art of the
[1:18:59] bible then why didn't the pharisees have
[1:19:01] it it isn't linked to the art of the
[1:19:04] bible because we have got too much we
[1:19:06] have got too many artists trying to
[1:19:07] paint it
[1:19:10] the bible is right but god is the artist
[1:19:12] the artist painted and said that jesus
[1:19:14] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:19:16] forever
[1:19:17] oh my
[1:19:18] so what does depression of the cross
[1:19:19] bring what does the preaching because
[1:19:21] listen to what barack said here the
[1:19:23] preaching of the cross brings
[1:19:24] observation
[1:19:26] it brings troubles
[1:19:28] it brings stills up
[1:19:29] and we can't expect to be immune from
[1:19:32] all those things
[1:19:34] oh my
[1:19:35] where would you find true fellowship
[1:19:38] under the blood you say if we walk in
[1:19:40] the light as he is in the light we have
[1:19:43] fellowship one with another and the
[1:19:45] blood of jesus christ his son cleanses
[1:19:48] us from all sin
[1:19:49] why we don't have fellowship
[1:19:52] because of sin
[1:19:56] you mean in the message yes
[1:19:58] you can't get finished with that brother
[1:20:00] with that church and think because in
[1:20:02] sin
[1:20:03] because if we say we have no sin we
[1:20:05] deceive ourselves but if we confess our
[1:20:07] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:20:10] us of our sins and then the blood of
[1:20:12] jesus cleanses us
[1:20:14] us
[1:20:15] us
[1:20:16] all of us is the same blood is one blood
[1:20:21] the blood for you is the blood for me it
[1:20:23] cleanse us and if it cleanses us we can
[1:20:26] have fellowship
[1:20:27] one with another
[1:20:29] only if we come
[1:20:30] under the blood
[1:20:32] or give the lord a shout
[1:20:34] and under the blood is where you find
[1:20:36] the spirit
[1:20:37] when i see the blood i'm going to pass
[1:20:39] over you because the blood stood as a
[1:20:41] token but now is the spirit as the token
[1:20:44] so you find the spirit under the blood
[1:20:47] you feel the spirit this morning in the
[1:20:49] church because we preach in blood
[1:20:52] oh give the lord a shout and where the
[1:20:55] spirit is you must know there is liberto
[1:20:58] there is liberty oh give the lord a

[1:26:58] the preaching of the cross
[1:27:00] although as it
[1:27:02] despised as it is is god's
[1:27:06] provided way for sinners to come
[1:27:09] and fellowship with god
[1:27:11] or with each other
[1:27:14] we talk about sinners in this message
[1:27:18] what is being crucified with christ
[1:27:19] galatians says paul says but god forbid
[1:27:22] that i should glory saving the cross of
[1:27:24] our lord jesus christ by whom the world
[1:27:26] is crucified unto me this paul
[1:27:28] and i unto the world
[1:27:30] galatians 2 20 paul said i am crucified
[1:27:32] with christ nevertheless i live yet not
[1:27:34] i but christ liveth in me and the life
[1:27:37] which i now live in the flesh i live by
[1:27:40] the fate
[1:27:41] of the son of god so god didn't allow
[1:27:42] any boasting
[1:27:44] in the flesh boasting in ministry
[1:27:46] boasting in money boasting in wealth
[1:27:48] and car boasting in house god
[1:27:50] didn't allow that
[1:27:52] he was glory in it in the cross isn't
[1:27:53] that right
[1:27:55] so this what is crucified with christ by
[1:27:57] the brown
[1:27:59] to be crucified with christ
[1:28:02] are you ready
[1:28:03] is to live for others
[1:28:07] then he qualified what kind of others
[1:28:11] those who hate you
[1:28:15] those who wouldn't like you
[1:28:16] somebody make a sweet bread for you and
[1:28:18] you you'll like them back and make us
[1:28:19] feel bad for them
[1:28:24] die
[1:28:26] i mean that's give each other sweet
[1:28:27] bread
[1:28:30] that's a sweet bread competition
[1:28:33] this crucifixion
[1:28:36] is when you could love somebody or treat
[1:28:39] somebody nice and right to hate you
[1:28:43] not this idea
[1:28:45] this life and hate is not the same thing
[1:28:49] hate is bad you know
[1:28:54] who
[1:29:03] all right
[1:29:04] those who wouldn't like you
[1:29:06] those who will make fun of you
[1:29:08] live for them
[1:29:10] be with them
[1:29:12] love them
[1:29:13] pray for those who despisefully use you
[1:29:17] and say all man of evil falsely for my
[1:29:19] name's sake
[1:29:22] i thought this brother branham the
[1:29:24] message would probably help the church
[1:29:26] this morning
[1:29:28] that you would see that we need a
[1:29:30] calvary
[1:29:31] we need a crucifixion
[1:29:33] no crucifixion no resurrection you want
[1:29:36] a resurrection but you have a good
[1:29:37] crucifixion
[1:29:38] isn't that right
[1:29:40] hallelujah
[1:29:41] philippians 3 18
[1:29:44] for many walk of whom i have told you
[1:29:45] often and i'll tell you even weeping
[1:29:48] that they are the enemies of the cross
[1:29:51] of christ
[1:29:52] so paul was the man that's rocking this
[1:29:55] whole cross gospel
[1:29:58] he saw people who was the enemies of the
[1:30:00] cross
[1:30:01] because the cross
[1:30:02] takes away legalism
[1:30:04] the cross takes away what you can do
[1:30:07] and you see what christ has done
[1:30:09] and you accept the provision that christ
[1:30:12] did at calvary
[1:30:14] and then you are redeemed
[1:30:15] and then you are free and then you are
[1:30:17] forgiven and then you are cleansed
[1:30:18] because you accept his partner in grace
[1:30:21] oh my hallelujah
[1:30:24] first corinthians 1 23 but we
[1:30:26] but we preached christ crucified unto
[1:30:28] the jews of stumbling block
[1:30:30] unto greece the greeks foolishes how
[1:30:32] many homesteads
[1:30:35] the preaching of the cross is about
[1:30:37] sacrifice
[1:30:40] sacrifice of blood
[1:30:42] or blood and sacrifice
[1:30:44] the old testament was about the same
[1:30:47] the death of an innocent lamb
[1:30:49] it was the same in the garden of eden
[1:30:51] abel offered unto god a better sacrifice
[1:30:54] so this word sacrifice
[1:30:56] has always been dear
[1:30:58] even from the very beginning
[1:31:01] when god asked those two boys king and
[1:31:03] abel to bring an offering one brought
[1:31:05] fruits and flowers and whatever and i
[1:31:08] brought what a lamb that was killed
[1:31:10] and that blood
[1:31:12] was evidence the lamb died
[1:31:14] it was a sacrifice
[1:31:16] the blood price
[1:31:19] this currency of blood was to pay for
[1:31:21] sin
[1:31:23] to deal with the sin issue because this
[1:31:25] is our issue
[1:31:27] it's still an issue
[1:31:29] because that is how we were born in sin
[1:31:31] and see it in iniquity he wasn't born
[1:31:34] holy he wasn't born righteous he wasn't
[1:31:35] born a christian you were born in sin
[1:31:38] and the bible said there is none
[1:31:39] righteous no not one so a price had to
[1:31:41] be paid to address that issue
[1:31:44] oh glory and cancel that issue
[1:31:47] of sin isn't that right amen so paul
[1:31:50] himself
[1:31:51] reveal a mystery how the jews and
[1:31:54] gentiles will get together by the cross
[1:31:55] through the blood
[1:31:57] ephesians 2 12
[1:31:59] he said here and that he might reconcile
[1:32:02] both unto god watch it and he is our
[1:32:05] peace verse 14 who had made both one and
[1:32:08] had broken down the middle wall a
[1:32:10] petition between us having abolished in
[1:32:13] his flesh
[1:32:14] jesus having abolished where
[1:32:16] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:32:18] the commandments continually ordinance
[1:32:21] contained in ordinances for to make in
[1:32:24] himself a
[1:32:25] one new man
[1:32:27] so making peace
[1:32:29] and that he might reconcile brought unto
[1:32:31] god in one body
[1:32:32] so this was the mystery
[1:32:35] what paul was revealing here
[1:32:37] how true the one body of christ both jew
[1:32:40] and gentile going to be reconciled
[1:32:43] watch
[1:32:44] watch and that he might be reconciled
[1:32:46] brought unto god in one body
[1:32:49] by the cross
[1:32:51] having slain the enmity nearby oh
[1:32:54] blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:32:56] through him we both have access by one
[1:32:59] spirit unto the father and therefore you
[1:33:02] are no more strangers and foreigners so
[1:33:04] in other words all the time you talk
[1:33:06] about jews and gentiles he's now talking
[1:33:08] and preaching you are no longer
[1:33:09] strangers or foreigners praise god but
[1:33:13] fellow citizens with the saints and the
[1:33:15] household of god that are built upon the
[1:33:17] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:33:19] jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:33:21] cornerstone
[1:33:22] in galatians 3 he said it this way
[1:33:24] that there is neither jew nor greek
[1:33:26] there is neither born or free there is
[1:33:28] neither male nor female for you are all
[1:33:31] one in christ jesus
[1:33:36] according to the promise oh glory to god
[1:33:40] hallelujah and to give an anchor to this
[1:33:43] revelation that was given not to peter
[1:33:46] not to john not them to give him to paul
[1:33:48] paul in ephesians 3 said for this cause
[1:33:50] i paul a prisoner of jesus christ for
[1:33:52] you gentiles if you have heard of the
[1:33:55] dispensation of the grace of god which
[1:33:57] is given to me you would that you by
[1:33:59] that by revelation he has made known
[1:34:01] unto me the mystery whereby ye read that
[1:34:05] you may understand my knowledge in the
[1:34:07] mystery of christ which is in other ages
[1:34:09] was not made known unto the sons of men
[1:34:11] as is not revealed on these holy
[1:34:13] apostles and prophets by the spirit that
[1:34:15] the gentiles should be fellow heirs and
[1:34:18] of the same body and partakers of his
[1:34:20] promise in christ by the gospel whereas
[1:34:23] i was made a minister according to the
[1:34:25] gift of the grace of god that's unto me
[1:34:28] oh glory to god so poor with
[1:34:30] establishing that this was a revelation
[1:34:32] given to him by god oh hallelujah praise
[1:34:35] god that unto me who are the least of
[1:34:38] the saints is this grace given that i
[1:34:40] should preach among the gentiles the
[1:34:42] unseasonable riches of christ and to
[1:34:44] make all men see what is the fellowship
[1:34:47] of the mystery oh glory to god
[1:34:49] hallelujah praise god thank you jesus so
[1:34:53] when the veil in the temple was rent no
[1:34:55] more special priesthood it's for
[1:34:57] whosoever will today they want a new
[1:34:59] priesthood they want man so-called
[1:35:01] fivefold i call it so-called title in
[1:35:04] apostrophes hallelujah to run after them
[1:35:06] this renting of the veil of the temple
[1:35:09] the veil of the temple was rent to
[1:35:10] cancel all and any intermediary if
[1:35:13] there's any goddamn mary god i know
[1:35:15] secretary god i know somebody between
[1:35:17] you and him oh god give the lord i shout
[1:35:19] on that one let me say it god got a hand
[1:35:21] on mary gloria no secretary god i have
[1:35:24] nobody to renew on him when that veil
[1:35:26] was busted from the top to the bottom he
[1:35:28] gave you direct access isn't that right
[1:35:31] the preaching of the cross is the
[1:35:33] preaching also of the blood oh glory to
[1:35:35] god for first corinthians 2 2 4 i am
[1:35:38] determined not to know anything among
[1:35:40] you save jesus christ and him crucified
[1:35:43] oh gloria this is the gospel that paul
[1:35:45] preached have you received the holy
[1:35:47] ghost since you believe do you believe
[1:35:50] have you received because if you believe
[1:35:52] you shall receive have you received sins
[1:35:54] you believe oh glory to god we're almost
[1:35:56] done
[1:35:57] hallelujah it was the day of pentecost
[1:35:59] when 150 jews were in an upper room with
[1:36:02] the doors closed waiting for the promise
[1:36:05] cowardly afraid to testify the door shut
[1:36:08] because of the threat of the jews it was
[1:36:10] after the resurrected christ had come
[1:36:12] into the form of the holy spirit and
[1:36:15] given them an experience and licking
[1:36:17] tongues of fire set upon them it was
[1:36:19] then that they could run out into the
[1:36:21] streets not before when that fire hit
[1:36:24] them so is then they could go out and be
[1:36:26] a witness of the gospel oh glory to god
[1:36:29] hallelujah and peter could say ye men of
[1:36:31] israel and you that dwell in judea let
[1:36:34] this be known unto you and hack into my
[1:36:36] words it was after he had the experience
[1:36:39] of receiving the holy spirit so there is
[1:36:42] an experience or give the lord a shout
[1:36:44] of receiving the holy spirit we're not
[1:36:46] talking about joy in our church we're
[1:36:48] not talking about that we're talking
[1:36:50] about your father setting fire upon your
[1:36:53] life after he had the experience of
[1:36:56] receiving the holy spirit he could
[1:36:58] testify fearless and seal his testimony
[1:37:01] with his own blood
[1:37:03] oh my
[1:37:04] hallelujah oh glory to god and this is
[1:37:08] where i get the inspiration from oh
[1:37:09] glory to god the parable the man came in
[1:37:12] and with all the garment because when
[1:37:14] you get the wedding invitation then
[1:37:15] you'll get your wedding garment at the
[1:37:17] door and the wedding garment is the
[1:37:19] baptist of the holy ghost
[1:37:20] so when the man of the house came i am
[1:37:22] he saw a man there with all the
[1:37:23] government he's a friend he knew him
[1:37:24] friend oh you got inside of here like
[1:37:26] everybody they don't have the same
[1:37:27] garment because when you get that
[1:37:29] diamond everybody look alike you know
[1:37:30] who rich who poor who have who don't
[1:37:32] have everybody's sim garment no watches
[1:37:35] he said should he come some other way he
[1:37:37] come in the window he come in our back
[1:37:38] way but not through the door
[1:37:40] not through the door the way that jesus
[1:37:42] came to
[1:37:43] watch the way that jesus came through
[1:37:45] self-sacrifice
[1:37:48] then he dropped this here
[1:37:49] given your all to god
[1:37:52] and walk in the country
[1:37:54] and be crucified with him
[1:37:57] and rise again here we go to wear his
[1:38:00] garment of sacrifice and debt
[1:38:03] to the things of the world amen you know
[1:38:06] what the churches are today you live
[1:38:07] anyhow you want and go to church
[1:38:09] so god become like a ritual that would
[1:38:11] go there i hate the moon i hit a new
[1:38:13] feast at your new moon i hate it i hate
[1:38:15] it i have no sincerity in it
[1:38:18] but what we are called to do is to wear
[1:38:20] this garment of sacrifice you could do
[1:38:22] things but you prove you choose not to
[1:38:25] you could go certain places but you
[1:38:27] choose
[1:38:28] not to you could say say certain things
[1:38:31] but you choose
[1:38:32] not to
[1:38:34] to sacrifice
[1:38:35] even with what your mouth is a sacrifice
[1:38:38] hallelujah many quarrels don't have to
[1:38:40] go further
[1:38:42] but nobody want to give up and make a
[1:38:43] sacrifice to keep us still tongue
[1:38:47] so then you come a verbal war
[1:38:50] hallelujah
[1:38:51] oh my
[1:38:53] god
[1:38:54] jesus knew the cost
[1:38:55] of the cross
[1:38:57] jesus knew what the cross entailed
[1:39:00] because in matthew 24 39 he went a
[1:39:02] little further fell on his face and
[1:39:04] prayed saying father every possibility
[1:39:06] is compassion me nevertheless not my
[1:39:08] will but as thou wilt
[1:39:10] if he didn't know he never prayed that
[1:39:12] prayer
[1:39:13] he knew the suffering
[1:39:15] he knew the pain he knew the anguish but
[1:39:18] he was prepared
[1:39:20] to go all the way
[1:39:22] he asked perhaps he could be bypassing
[1:39:24] philippians to eat
[1:39:25] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:39:28] humbled himself
[1:39:29] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:39:31] death
[1:39:33] of the cross
[1:39:34] mission camera please
[1:39:36] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:39:38] inclusion and i'm closing
[1:39:42] what obama's saying this
[1:39:44] not long ago there was a great american
[1:39:46] musician young fellow
[1:39:48] outstanding character
[1:39:49] and he could play that music
[1:39:52] and the man was so great everywhere
[1:39:53] until finally he went to europe to play
[1:39:56] before the great lovers of that kind of
[1:39:57] music and one night
[1:39:59] after he had played his music the
[1:40:00] audience was so excited until they stood
[1:40:02] on your feet and screamed and clapped
[1:40:04] their hands together
[1:40:06] and they expected the young man to walk
[1:40:08] out
[1:40:08] and bow to appreciate the applauding
[1:40:11] and they noticed he didn't say a word
[1:40:14] and they stopped to see
[1:40:16] what was the matter
[1:40:18] and they noticed the young man
[1:40:20] wasn't
[1:40:21] even noticing his audience
[1:40:24] he was looking up in the balcony
[1:40:26] way up high
[1:40:27] and they all turned to see what the
[1:40:29] young man was facing
[1:40:31] and up in the balcony set the old master
[1:40:33] teacher
[1:40:35] he the young man wasn't noticing what
[1:40:37] his audience was saying
[1:40:40] he wanted to get a bow head from the old
[1:40:42] master teacher
[1:40:44] and i think
[1:40:45] that is it today
[1:40:47] this old-fashioned preaching of the
[1:40:48] cross the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:52] signs and wonders are miracles
[1:40:54] in their true state
[1:40:55] isn't very attractive today
[1:40:58] people call you crazy
[1:41:00] lots of them think if your polishes up a
[1:41:02] little bit get a little order here a
[1:41:03] little bit there thousand time thousands
[1:41:05] will come and listen to some orator
[1:41:08] someone who is polishing grammar and
[1:41:10] they will applaud it
[1:41:12] but church today
[1:41:14] let's not listen to the applauding
[1:41:16] of the world
[1:41:18] let's keep our minds on the teacher
[1:41:21] the holy spirit you can play jesus keep
[1:41:23] me on the cross
[1:41:26] let's not listen to the applauding of
[1:41:28] the world
[1:41:29] let's keep our minds and the teacher the
[1:41:31] holy spirit see what he is bowing to
[1:41:34] will he sanction this
[1:41:36] is he giving a sanction to our preaching
[1:41:39] is these signs that he said would follow
[1:41:41] are they following our ministry
[1:41:43] here's what he said
[1:41:47] these signs shall follow believe mark
[1:41:49] the 16th chapter
[1:41:50] he said go into all the world and preach
[1:41:52] the gospel
[1:41:54] and he that believeth as baptized shall
[1:41:55] be saved
[1:41:56] either believe it not shall be condemned
[1:41:58] and these things shall follow them that
[1:41:59] believe
[1:42:00] don't stop just at the first quotation
[1:42:03] and you add that's all no
[1:42:05] he said and they shall cast our devils
[1:42:08] they shall speak with your tongues
[1:42:10] if they should take up serpents or
[1:42:12] drinking everything it shall not harm
[1:42:13] them
[1:42:14] if they lay hand in the sick they shall
[1:42:16] recover
[1:42:17] then they begin to pray
[1:42:22] it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:42:25] for man to shake hands with another and
[1:42:26] call himself a christian upon them basis
[1:42:30] it wasn't so hard to begin to join a
[1:42:31] church and to see a certain creed and
[1:42:32] call his of a christian
[1:42:34] it wasn't so very beginning and if
[1:42:36] that's all that you have did my dear
[1:42:38] friend
[1:42:39] you are standing here today and maybe
[1:42:41] not even done this
[1:42:42] i speak also to the hour has come that
[1:42:45] god must speak
[1:42:47] the enemy is coming like a flood
[1:42:49] the bible teaches that the spirit of god
[1:42:51] will raise a standard against it
[1:42:53] if you would like to be included in this
[1:42:55] prayer saying god
[1:42:58] take me back to an experience
[1:43:00] like they had on the day of pentecost
[1:43:02] would you raise your hands
[1:43:04] you in this visible audience the lord
[1:43:06] blessed you
[1:43:07] and you all then raise your land and we
[1:43:09] will see in connected land
[1:43:11] if you would like to be included in this
[1:43:13] prayer
[1:43:14] will you raise your hands out in radio
[1:43:16] land and let god give you
[1:43:18] an experience
[1:43:19] like it was under pentecost
[1:43:22] let us stand to our feet
[1:43:25] lord
[1:43:27] these few broken up words are committing
[1:43:30] to your hands
[1:43:32] when you were here on earth you found
[1:43:33] things going on that wasn't according to
[1:43:35] the scriptures
[1:43:37] and you strictly told them that it
[1:43:39] wasn't so from the beginning lord god
[1:43:40] grant today that every man woman boy or
[1:43:43] girl that's standing with them hands
[1:43:44] lifted just now
[1:43:46] to thee with
[1:43:48] a heart desire to have an experience
[1:43:50] like they have had in the beginning with
[1:43:51] the holy spirit come like a russian
[1:43:53] mighty wind
[1:43:54] and fill every crevice of the heart
