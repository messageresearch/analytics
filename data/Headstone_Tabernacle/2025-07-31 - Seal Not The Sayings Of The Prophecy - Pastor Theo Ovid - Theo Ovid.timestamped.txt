[16:05] Let's give him worship. Father, we thank
[16:07] you. We praise you. Oh, you are the

[16:13] all the earth. Hallowed be thy name.

[16:28] in his presence.
[16:30] We thank God for his goodness.
[16:34] Amen. Well, God bless you. Let's turn to
[16:36] our Bibles. Would you like to turn to
[16:38] Psalms Psalms chapter 126 for a
[16:41] scripture reading as we
[16:45] as we
[16:47] want to read the word of God and pray
[16:51] commit the service into the hands of the
[16:52] Lord.
[16:54] Psalm chapter 126,
[16:57] it says, "When the Lord turned again the
[16:59] captivity of Zion, we were like them
[17:02] that dreamed. Then was our mouth filled
[17:05] with laughter and our tongue with
[17:07] singing. Then said they among the
[17:09] heathen, "The Lord had done great things
[17:12] for them. The Lord had done great things
[17:16] for us, whereof we are glad. Turn again
[17:20] our captivity, O Lord, as the streams of
[17:24] the south. They that sew in tears shall
[17:28] reap in joy. He that goeth forth and
[17:31] weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
[17:34] doubtless come again with rejoicing,
[17:37] bringing his sheav with him. May God add
[17:40] blessing to the reading of his word. Let
[17:43] us pray together.
[17:45] Almighty God, we thank you, Father, to
[17:47] be in your presence tonight, Lord. We
[17:50] thank you for your your word, Lord. We
[17:52] thank you for your Holy Spirit, Lord.
[17:54] Father, that is here amongst your
[17:56] people, oh God, anointing us and
[17:58] inspiring us, Lord, to the time and
[18:01] season that we are living in. Lord, we
[18:03] pray, oh God, that your spirit would
[18:06] come again tonight. Lord, we we welcome
[18:09] you in this place tonight. Lord, we we
[18:12] we want to have nothing of ourselves,
[18:14] Lord, Father, to bring only into your
[18:17] precious arms. We cling tonight to the
[18:19] cross and to your word and your
[18:21] presence, Lord, that you would pour out
[18:23] your spirit upon your people and do a
[18:25] work amongst us in in our lives, oh God.
[18:28] Father, that would be unmistakably God.
[18:31] Father, we yield ourselves to you
[18:33] tonight, Lord. May you pour your spirit
[18:34] upon your people. Bless the songs as we
[18:37] would sing and worship and create an
[18:39] atmosphere tonight, Lord. We pray that
[18:42] your word would come to us tonight,
[18:44] Father, and speak to our hearts, Lord,
[18:46] and shake us, Lord, Father, and stir us
[18:48] up, Lord. Inspire us and ignite us,
[18:51] Lord, Father, in a way that, Lord, only
[18:54] the spirit can do tonight. We just yield
[18:56] ourselves to you, Lord, and the work of
[18:58] your mighty hands. We pray that you
[19:00] you'll bless this service tonight to our
[19:02] hearts and bless those that were hooked
[19:04] in tonight, Lord, those that will be
[19:06] listening in even afterwards. Lord, we
[19:09] pray that your presence would just be
[19:11] with us, Lord, and do the great work
[19:13] tonight. We just commit these things in
[19:16] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[19:18] Amen and amen. Do you love him tonight?
[19:22] Amen.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Do you love your brother?

[19:26] your sister. Tell him God bless you.

[34:40] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we
[34:43] thank you for your presence, Lord. In
[34:45] the Old Test where the Old Testament was
[34:47] dead to go in, now it's dead to be
[34:49] outside of your presence. And we thank
[34:51] you that in your presence of life, in
[34:53] the presence of deliverance, in the
[34:55] presence of breakthrough, I pray you
[34:57] release more of your presence here
[34:58] tonight. Speak to us by your word and
[35:00] confirm your word with signs, wonders,
[35:02] and miracles. I ask in Jesus name.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Before you
[35:07] take your seats, I'd like you to go to
[35:09] Bibles to
[35:10] Revelation chapter 10 want to reverse
[35:13] from read from verse 8 to 111.
[35:17] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[35:18] speak unto me again and said go and take
[35:21] the little book which is open in the
[35:23] hand of the angel.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[35:27] earth. And I went unto the angel and
[35:29] said unto him, give me the little book.
[35:32] And he said unto me, take it, eat it up.
[35:34] It shall make thy belly bitter. It shall
[35:36] be thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took
[35:39] the little book out of the angel's hand
[35:41] and ate it up. And it was my mouth sweet
[35:44] as honey. As soon as I had eaten it, my
[35:47] belly was bitter. He said unto me, "Thou
[35:50] must prophesy again before many peoples
[35:53] and nations and tongues and kings." May
[35:55] God bless his word. You may be seated.
[35:57] Praise God.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; I have something to share with you
[35:59] tonight. I have a special tape, short
[36:01] tape I like to play with you, play for
[36:02] you tonight that I know that will bless
[36:05] and help. But tonight I want to strike
[36:09] this word, go and take the little book
[36:13] which is open in the hand of the angel.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; And we know who the angel is.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it here. The Holy
[36:21] Spirit today, the manifestation of the
[36:24] Holy Spirit is that angel
[36:27] &gt;&gt; trying to get the people back to the
[36:29] word.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz the Holy Spirit will only vindicate
[36:32] the word.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now if the mighty angel that
[36:36] came with the book open, the way the
[36:38] angel he saw the angel with the stretch
[36:40] back wings with the seven thunders
[36:41] throwing the voices out. If that book is
[36:43] open and a voice come and said go and
[36:46] take that book
[36:48] &gt;&gt; and eat that book.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; And then what going to happen
[36:50] afterwards? It going to be sweet in the
[36:53] mouth.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; But it going to be bit in the belly.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; That's when we have to live it.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; That's when we have to die out. that we
[36:59] have to stand and testify that this
[37:01] thing is real and true.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; It have truth. It's nice. It is sweet in
[37:06] the mouth. It is sweet to say it back.
[37:08] It is sweet as revelation. But as life
[37:11] as living something that's something
[37:13] different.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; It's bitter when we begin to digest it
[37:16] and recognize it have a cost that goes
[37:18] with this book.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; There's a price that goes with this
[37:21] book.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; It's an effect of this book. It's not
[37:24] only sweet in the mouth, but it going to
[37:26] be bitter in the belly. Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; But the effect of digesting this book is
[37:30] prophecy coming out.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; And we have the testimony of Jesus by
[37:34] having the spirit of prophecy.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; So tonight we have mechanics and
[37:37] dynamics. And the dynamics is here in
[37:40] the form of the spirit of prophecy
[37:42] because dynamics is always spirit.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; When the time is not yet, the anointing
[37:46] of prophecy has to come.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Now God in the beginning, he has to
[37:50] speak his own word. Let there be light.
[37:53] Let there be this. Let there be that. It
[37:55] have to come out his mouth. You have to
[37:56] prophesy for it to come to pass.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; And that same God
[38:00] &gt;&gt; who spoke his word in the beginning.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; He put a word here. Go to the angel and
[38:05] don't beg for the book. But take the
[38:07] book and eat the book, digest the book.
[38:11] And any man that take that book could
[38:13] only speak what is in the book.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He can't add to the book. He
[38:17] can't take away from the book. That's
[38:19] why he said the spirit, the prophet, and
[38:21] the bride say the same thing. And what
[38:24] they say will already be said in the
[38:25] word. So a man cannot take this book and
[38:28] come up with his own revelation. He
[38:30] cannot take the book and come with his
[38:32] own inspiration. He have to prophesy the
[38:34] same thing. I am not a prophet but the
[38:37] lion have roar. Who can but fear? The
[38:39] Lord God has spoken. Who can but
[38:42] prophesy? I am not a prophet but the
[38:44] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[38:46] prophecy. And God has called us to
[38:49] prophesy. Prophesy your healing.
[38:51] Prophesy your deliverance. Prophesy your
[38:53] breakthrough. Prophesy your victory.
[38:55] Prophesy your overcoming. Prophesy your
[38:57] adoption. You have to prophesy. You have
[39:00] to speak it. Oh, give the Lord some
[39:02] praises tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:06] So shall my word be. It shall not return
[39:09] to be void,
[39:10] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish the purpose.
[39:12] Hallelujah.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; I said it for listen now.
[39:17] But God bless you. I want to tell you
[39:19] something. One thing. I know I'm holding
[39:21] long. I just want this one thing. I
[39:24] know. I want you to remember there's
[39:26] something fixing to happen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Remember, I told you that
[39:30] &gt;&gt; there is a step up
[39:32] &gt;&gt; coming in the church now.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; These things that you're now seeing are
[39:36] going to be just little things after a
[39:38] while.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Something is moving.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; I say this by the power of the
[39:43] revelation of Jesus Christ. Everyone in
[39:46] our doctrine and our baptism we have
[39:48] come to a place but there is some key
[39:51] &gt;&gt; that will unlock something here
[39:53] &gt;&gt; now he saw the book seal on seven seals
[39:56] and Daniel saw the same and when the
[39:58] seven thunders uttered the voices he
[40:00] don't write and that was in the
[40:02] scripture but it revealed in the last
[40:04] days
[40:05] &gt;&gt; we are at this time
[40:06] &gt;&gt; we are kinish now here a few nights ago
[40:09] I went to brother Vivitz over in
[40:11] Kentucky crossing to Evansville and
[40:13] brother Boswell was with me and I said
[40:16] that day it kept burdening on my heart.
[40:18] I know that something God has promised
[40:20] on the opening up of the power
[40:25] &gt;&gt; yet I'm waiting now for him.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; And when he was preaching the thunders
[40:30] he said is this the mystery
[40:32] &gt;&gt; of the thunders that will bring back a
[40:34] power into the church.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; A key to unlock
[40:38] &gt;&gt; the power of God to come among the
[40:39] people. This key had to have a hand
[40:41] behind it
[40:42] &gt;&gt; and the hand have to have faith in it
[40:44] &gt;&gt; to turn that key to unlock the power.
[40:46] But the power has to come into the
[40:48] church
[40:49] &gt;&gt; because national force will put the
[40:50] church in the work of the churches but
[40:52] the power of God will put the people in
[40:54] the bride.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that tonight?
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; We on the verge of something brother.
[41:01] Somebody come from Canaan. The grapes
[41:03] are good. It's our land. God give it to
[41:05] us. We can take it. God said so. Didn't
[41:09] God said we is ours. We are living in
[41:11] the last days. In the last days, I will
[41:13] send out the rain in abundance like
[41:16] that. Both former and latter rain will
[41:18] fall in this day.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; What they had back there, plus
[41:21] &gt;&gt; what God will give us right now is at
[41:23] hand.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. What they had back
[41:26] there, plus
[41:27] &gt;&gt; we have what they had there back there,
[41:29] plus.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; We cannot get what they have. what we
[41:31] have plus no going back there because it
[41:34] t our lives back to the faith of the
[41:36] fathers to pick up what they had back
[41:37] there. We have to pick up what Peter
[41:39] had, what Paul had, what the disciples
[41:42] had. Nothing short of that. We have to
[41:44] go back and pick that up. Plus, we give
[41:46] the Lord some praises.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Now, you're talking about the I'm I'm
[41:55] going to wrap up here now.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the the the miniac.
[42:00] the maniac of Gadara, man with a
[42:03] thousand devils and so on. How the devil
[42:04] make him so strong and people can hold
[42:06] back the man. And he was talking about
[42:07] the same. Then he said said this, when a
[42:10] person is crippled,
[42:11] &gt;&gt; yes,
[42:12] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit gets a hold of them.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; If the devil got that much power
[42:18] &gt;&gt; to make a man three or four times his
[42:20] human strength,
[42:21] &gt;&gt; that's why when you see them under the
[42:23] demon power, you can hold them. So take
[42:24] four or five people to hold on somebody.
[42:26] The demons acting up, right? He said,
[42:28] "If the devil got that much power to
[42:31] make a man three or four times his human
[42:33] strength, how much power
[42:35] &gt;&gt; can God put in a man?"
[42:37] &gt;&gt; And that is what comes upon him to make
[42:40] him walk.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; That's how a man can walk
[42:44] &gt;&gt; because a super strength.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; It's God himself coming down.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Just as the devil empowers somebody to
[42:50] be four times the strength, God empowers
[42:53] somebody. Two little piece of foot
[42:56] could run
[43:00] &gt;&gt; because of the strength of God. Do you
[43:01] believe that tonight?
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; That's what come upon him to make him
[43:07] walk in the strength of God. They have
[43:09] been crippled for years. His bones come
[43:12] out straight. His hands go straight. He
[43:15] walks like a young new man because the
[43:17] power of the Holy Spirit is on him.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Almost done. And these were so evil they
[43:25] wrapped the man in chains and he would
[43:26] break them.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Then he plucked them aunder. There was
[43:29] nothing could bind him. He was really a
[43:31] bad case because he had a legion of
[43:33] demons in him.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus crossed over from Gada and he was
[43:37] so evil. Not the man. The man was all
[43:40] right.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Let's go. It's not the man. When you see
[43:44] a person like that, don't never think
[43:46] that it's the man.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; It's the devil that's in the man. Now in
[43:50] that man was some of these spirits that
[43:52] was cast out of the swine gadara. Some
[43:55] of those poor people are out in the
[43:57] inant institution beating their heads
[43:59] against padded bars. Remember devils
[44:01] never die. Devils always live. There
[44:03] will always be a time when devils will
[44:05] have to die. They will be completely
[44:07] totally anniated. But now they are alive
[44:10] and they work from generation to
[44:12] generation upon human beings. Some of
[44:15] them in the form of cancer. Some of them
[44:17] in the form of epilepsy. Some of them in
[44:19] the form of tuberculosis. They get into
[44:21] the flesh but seemingly they are
[44:23] powerless until they can get into a
[44:26] person.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; They have to operate through a person
[44:29] which brings to another thought that the
[44:32] Holy Spirit
[44:33] &gt;&gt; covers the earth and is almost helpless
[44:36] until it gets into you and me.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; God is dependent on you and I.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the earth is full of
[44:44] the spirit of God, but it's poured out.
[44:46] It cannot operate until it comes into
[44:49] us. We human beings to operate. Give the
[44:52] Lord some praises.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Final quote. The Holy Ghost ought to be
[44:59] more important to you than everything
[45:01] else there is in the world.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Your prestige, your life, your job, your
[45:05] anything there is. You should not cease
[45:08] until you have it.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; You must receive it. If the most I am
[45:12] afraid, they will of my work. I'm afraid
[45:14] of my husband. Don't be afraid. Let that
[45:16] be first place. Let everything else go.
[45:19] Let that be first. Oh, blessed be the
[45:22] name of the Lord. Well, I expect it one
[45:24] of these days, brother. Not one of these
[45:26] days. This is the time. Let it be first
[45:28] before I go and do anything else. Let me
[45:31] have it now. Desperate. Oh, give the
[45:33] Lord some praises.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Could we all stand as we want to go
[45:36] straight into this little tape I want to
[45:38] bless you with tonight. Praise the Lord.
[45:39] The message is um praise God. Seal not
[45:42] the scenes of the prophecy for the
[45:44] shame. Praise the Lord. Give the Lord
[45:45] some praise.
[45:48] Somebody say
[45:56] yes Lord Jesus
[45:59] may. Hallelujah.
[46:02] Oh yes Lord Jesus like me.

[48:33] that word image, Lord. And I pray come

[48:37] special communion service and speak to
[48:39] our hearts and change our lives. Father,
[48:41] be more like you. Grant it, Father. In
[48:44] Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God
[48:47] bless you and welcome. We want to turn
[48:48] our Bibles to Revelation chapter 22 and
[48:51] Revelation chapter 19. Two scriptures
[48:53] this evening.
[48:56] Revelation 22 7-12. And we read
[49:00] Revelation 19:9-10.
[49:04] Revelation 22:7.
[49:06] Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he
[49:08] that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy
[49:10] of this book. And I, John, saw these
[49:13] things, and heard them. When I heard
[49:14] them, and seen, I fell unto worship
[49:17] before the feet of the angel, which
[49:19] showed me these things. And he said unto
[49:22] me, "See thou do it not, for I am a thy
[49:23] solo servant, and of thy brethren, the
[49:26] prophets, and of them which keep the
[49:28] scenes of this book, worship God." And
[49:31] he said unto me, "Seal not the scenes of
[49:34] the prophecy of this book, for the time
[49:36] is at hand. He that is unjust, let him
[49:38] be unjust still. He which is filthy, let
[49:41] him be filthy still. He that is
[49:43] righteous, let him be righteous still.
[49:45] And he that is holy, let him be holy
[49:47] still. And behold, I come quickly. My
[49:49] reward is with me to give every man
[49:52] according as his work shall be.
[49:54] Revelation 19:9-10 it said he said unto
[49:57] me write blessed are they which are
[49:59] called unto the marriage supper of the
[50:01] lamb and he said unto me these are the
[50:03] true saints of God and I fell at his
[50:06] feet to worship him. He said unto me see
[50:08] it not I am thy fellow servant and of
[50:11] thy brethren that have the testimony of
[50:13] Jesus. Worship God for the testimony of
[50:16] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. May God
[50:18] bless his word. You may be seated. Just
[50:20] a little thought this evening. Seal not
[50:22] the sayings of the prophecy. And I have
[50:25] an inspiration. The time is at hand. Oh,
[50:30] praise the name of the Lord. We read a
[50:31] quote this morning. As Daniel heard the
[50:33] seven thunders and was forbidden to
[50:35] write, John heard the voices and his
[50:37] book was sealed. The mystery of God
[50:39] would be finished. In other words, God
[50:40] would be known to his church not in
[50:42] three people but as one person. The
[50:45] mystery of God will be revealed. I hear
[50:47] the part now. And when that was
[50:49] completely revealed, then the seven
[50:53] mysteries would open to the church. He's
[50:55] talking about the seven thunders. Uh
[50:57] because in the church prophecy would be
[51:01] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[51:04] Spirit, him moving in and out and
[51:07] showing his signs of being alive and
[51:10] among us. Living among us, we are then
[51:12] worshiping the living Christ that among
[51:15] us. So friends, your faith itself must
[51:17] be anointed.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; This currency of purchase, which is this
[51:22] faith must be anointed.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; There has to have an applied faith, an
[51:25] attitude of faith. Uh God, brother
[51:27] Brandham uh was told the people uh God
[51:30] told him, if you could get the people to
[51:31] believe that even cancer will stand in
[51:33] your way. So we have something, but I
[51:36] don't think we understand the value of
[51:38] what we have. That faith is a purchasing
[51:40] power.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Shout out purchasing power.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Purchasing power.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; It's like you have a currency. It's like
[51:45] you have money. It's like you could you
[51:47] you need the bread. You can't eat the
[51:49] money. You need to get the bread. The
[51:51] money is the purchasing power of the
[51:53] bread.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; If you could get to the bakery, you're
[51:55] going to get the bread.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, you have the
[51:58] purchasing power.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; You could rejoice. You could praise God.
[52:01] You could worship. You're hungry. Yes.
[52:03] But you could be grateful because you
[52:05] have the purchasing power. You have
[52:07] faith as a believer. You have the
[52:09] purchasing power for your deliverance,
[52:11] for your breakthrough to get out of
[52:13] whatever you're in. You have the
[52:14] purchasing power. All that you are, all
[52:17] that you ever will be be is based upon
[52:19] faith in his word. You have to have
[52:21] faith to believe that God going to break
[52:23] you out. That God going to bust you out
[52:25] of what you're in. You have to have
[52:27] faith to believe that you're going to be
[52:28] healed. You have to have faith to
[52:30] believe that you're going to get a
[52:31] breakthrough that God will lift you off
[52:33] that depression and that frustration.
[52:35] You have to have faith to believe that.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Not that crying and tears. Faith to
[52:39] believe. Amen.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Does thou believe? Can thou only
[52:43] believe?
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; So, do you believe that it's promised
[52:48] that he'll be moving in and out among
[52:49] us?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Can we worshiping the living Christ?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John was worshiping the
[52:54] angel. The angel said, "Don't worship
[52:55] me."
[52:57] &gt;&gt; One of your prophets. Amen. Don't
[52:58] worship me.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hallelujah. They have
[53:01] Christ to worship.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; So, we have no man to worship.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; We come to worship Jesus Christ.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; When we begin to see Christ, we come to
[53:07] worship Jesus Christ.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So your faith has to
[53:11] be anointed
[53:12] &gt;&gt; to activate dynamics. Not just a dry
[53:14] faith. It's a resurrection faith.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Praise God. Amen. Do
[53:19] you believe that?
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So God, Praise God. Now listen to this.
[53:23] We read this on Thursday. I'm reading
[53:24] back again. I've tried I've been
[53:27] studying I told before the congregation.
[53:30] I've been studying the early church and
[53:31] I watched the way those anointed men
[53:33] prepare the house of the Lord and the
[53:35] order of the Lord's worship in the
[53:37] house. And it struck me real good and I
[53:40] preached about it sometime ago the
[53:41] subject I will restore. And I begin to
[53:44] study on what these men did and the way
[53:47] they take care of the church that God
[53:49] have left them to overseer. Now we're
[53:51] going to start off with the early church
[53:53] and just bring it about 5 minutes to see
[53:56] what they did and then I can show you
[53:58] listen the vision that I have for the
[54:01] future. Now at the beginning the church
[54:04] was inaugurated at Pentecost and there
[54:06] the Holy Spirit fell upon them where
[54:08] Jesus had chosen 12 and one of them had
[54:11] fallen and they had to choose Matias
[54:15] &gt;&gt; to take his place. Now here's the point.
[54:18] Here's the point now. And the Holy
[54:20] Spirit waited until all this was in
[54:24] order before it come.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Understand this. Judas was not off.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; He hung himself.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; All right. So it was 11. They had to
[54:33] have 12 for it to happen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Now Paul was ready the 12th man
[54:37] &gt;&gt; that God was going to find.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; But for dynamics to strike, they had to
[54:42] have 12.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; So they had to pick somebody.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; It have no book of Matias. It has
[54:47] nothing about Matias. They choose
[54:48] Matias.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And Matias make up the number 12. And
[54:51] then it was ready.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; It was set.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Fire could fall now because everything
[54:55] is in order.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Give the Lord a shout
[54:58] on that one.
[55:00] Hallelujah.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Now these are not my words. Now this is
[55:02] a prophet's word. God waited
[55:05] &gt;&gt; until they get matas in position
[55:07] &gt;&gt; for the fire to fall.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Now this is border man. Now he said the
[55:11] Holy Spirit waited until all this was in
[55:13] order before it can come. They had to
[55:16] choose the bishop prick of Judas that
[55:18] fell by transgression to fulfill
[55:19] scripture. And I believe here we go that
[55:23] all these things has a time of
[55:26] lingering.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. waiting but it is waiting for the
[55:31] time for the scripture to be fulfilled
[55:34] till everything gets right everything is
[55:36] in order waiting
[55:38] &gt;&gt; many times like a child we get impatient
[55:40] we have great anticipation and jump way
[55:43] ahead and that hinders the work until
[55:45] the work get caught up we must move
[55:47] reverently have a purpose in heart to
[55:50] say if the Lord's will and so forth like
[55:52] that if he desires to use us in such and
[55:54] such a way but wait until he makes an
[55:57] opening David had to hear the rustling
[55:59] of malberry tree. He had to know God is
[56:01] going in front of him. Isn't that right?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; So the dynamics is here today.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Dynamics is here already
[56:08] &gt;&gt; in the form of the spirit of prophecy
[56:11] &gt;&gt; which is the testimony of Jesus
[56:13] &gt;&gt; and we have that today.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[56:20] prophecy that give us the authority to
[56:22] know every devil have to go on the run.
[56:24] to give us the authority to say the
[56:26] sick, you're going to be healed.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blind going to see,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; the deaf going to heal, your family will
[56:33] be delivered
[56:34] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of prophecy.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; That can't return void. We take
[56:39] authority by the word to prophesy from
[56:42] the book.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; The book is already open. We have the
[56:45] authority to go into the book and
[56:47] prophesy. Devil, time up.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; We serve your notice.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Get out our property. Get off of my
[56:55] land. Give me my mountain. Oh, give the
[56:58] Lord some praises, people.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Do you see it?
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; So, you have to go forward now to pick
[57:06] up the authority you have in God.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; To claim your mountain
[57:10] &gt;&gt; and to claim your inheritance and stop
[57:12] accepting the estate to where you're at
[57:14] right now.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. So we can only prophesy
[57:20] according to the vision loosed by the
[57:22] spirit of prophecy. Oh my. So Abraham
[57:26] received the word and anything was
[57:29] contrary to the word he called it. It
[57:31] wasn't. In other words, everything was a
[57:33] lying symptom.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Sarah age, Sarah state, Sarah body was
[57:36] lying to him. As far as he concerned, he
[57:38] not even counting. The Bible said he's
[57:40] staggering at the promise of God through
[57:41] unbelief.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, he had frustrations. He had
[57:44] upsets ups and down like everybody else,
[57:45] like what you would have, but not at the
[57:47] promise.
[57:48] because he was convinced.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was fully persuaded,
[57:52] &gt;&gt; fully persuaded that God was able to
[57:55] perform
[57:56] &gt;&gt; what he promised.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Tonight, you got to be fully persuaded.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Got to be convinced.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; If your body don't feel it, that's not
[58:07] having to do with it.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; I give your foot not feeling it, your
[58:09] eye not feeling it, your heart not
[58:11] you're not feeling it, it's not feelless
[58:13] down this, it's believe this. My God.
[58:16] And believing is a substance that create
[58:18] the faith.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; I want to say that believing is a
[58:21] substance that create the faith.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Oh glory.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. So Jesus. So
[58:31] brother s back the faith. He introduced
[58:33] the Messiah and revealed all the
[58:36] mysteries of God. And I want to bring
[58:38] back this one. The appearing and coming
[58:40] is another quote different from the one
[58:41] I say this morning. It's two different
[58:43] things. The appearing of the Lord is now
[58:45] the appeal appearing among his people.
[58:46] We see him in his same works, the
[58:48] appearing his holy spirit. But his
[58:50] coming, here we go, will be his physical
[58:52] being
[58:53] &gt;&gt; to catch the church up.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; That's the trump of God. His coming, his
[58:57] actual coming. Isn't that right?
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Won't
[59:00] be long with you. So there are five
[59:02] spiritual offices in the church to set
[59:04] the church in order.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Apostles, prophets, teachers,
[59:08] evangelists, pastors, those are called
[59:10] offices by God. Then in the local
[59:13] congregation there are nine spiritual
[59:15] gifts that work among the people
[59:17] &gt;&gt; which include prophecy, tongues,
[59:19] interpretations, wisdom, knowledge,
[59:21] gifts of faith, gifts of healing, all of
[59:23] that.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Now in these offices and places in the
[59:26] offices you hear from the apostle his
[59:28] ministry. You hear from the prophet his
[59:31] ministry, from the evangelist, from the
[59:33] teacher, from the pastor. Each has a
[59:35] separate ministry.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; So no man packing all five. either here
[59:39] claim a man claim to have all five liars
[59:42] &gt;&gt; because that's not the scripture it's a
[59:44] separate ministry and that is why God
[59:46] divide the land everybody can have all
[59:48] the land God here Judah here Ephraim
[59:51] here the land is divided
[59:53] &gt;&gt; the land got to be divided
[59:55] &gt;&gt; pastor here prophet here teacher here
[59:58] evangelist here apostle here land
[1:00:00] divided
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; to do what set the church in order from
[1:00:03] the pastor you hear from the apostle you
[1:00:05] hear from the prophet you hear from each
[1:00:07] ministry Because he's ministry of a work
[1:00:09] to bring you to that perfection.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It's not a ministry
[1:00:13] for ministry. It's a ministry for work.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; What work? For the perfecting of the
[1:00:17] saints. For the work of the ministry,
[1:00:19] for the edifying of the body till we all
[1:00:21] come into unity of the faith.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Isn't that right?
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; So then in these offices and places, you
[1:00:29] hear from the apostle and so forth. Each
[1:00:31] has a separate ministry and their
[1:00:33] ministries of God. God had set them in a
[1:00:36] church for this purpose. Then God comes
[1:00:39] down in the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:42] among his congregation to speak with
[1:00:44] tongues. Another one interpret tells a
[1:00:47] certain thing to do and so forth. Then
[1:00:49] there are gifts of wisdom, knowledge,
[1:00:50] interpretations. All kind of gifts go in
[1:00:52] the church. But the first way it has got
[1:00:54] to come first by the word.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So when you see the message, nothing has
[1:01:02] mattered.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You don't need a next interpretation, a
[1:01:06] next idea. You see the core thing
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; that you have to be formed into the word
[1:01:10] image. You have to get the word inside
[1:01:12] of you. You're not a lesser son and
[1:01:13] somebody's a higher son. It's sons and
[1:01:15] daughters.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Placed in different positions.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You getting God in you is
[1:01:20] the same God in this one and that one.
[1:01:22] The same God. But say you have enough
[1:01:23] God in you, you can speak the next world
[1:01:25] into existence.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; God who have little parts and strong
[1:01:27] parts and weak parts. God is God.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; You have a small light, big light, is
[1:01:31] the same light.
[1:01:33] Hallelujah.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; If you get a content of the ocean in a
[1:01:36] little bottle is just as much material
[1:01:38] as what in the entire ocean.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; If you go and get a little bottle of
[1:01:44] ocean water, everything in that little
[1:01:47] bottle is what the ocean have in it.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; What you have there is a measure. And
[1:01:53] you have to come into the measure of the
[1:01:55] stature of a perfect man.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But everything is inside of here. All
[1:02:00] the power is inside of there. All the
[1:02:03] glory is inside of there. Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] All the power is inside of there in your
[1:02:09] measure.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see you have everything that the
[1:02:19] ocean has?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see you getting your measure?
[1:02:22] [Applause]
[1:02:27] That's why Elisha had the faith to ask
[1:02:30] Elijah, "Give me a double portion."
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't I better what I ask him for. I
[1:02:37] better ask small.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; He said double.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And then you ask a hard thing.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy thing.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, this young man call
[1:02:48] about double.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; See a big man crossing over. He want to
[1:02:50] leave. He said I want a double what you
[1:02:52] have.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It's double trouble I have to deal with.
[1:02:54] So let me take the double one time. It's
[1:02:56] double trials. It's double testing. I
[1:02:59] must get some double for my trouble.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Say amen somebody. Don't
[1:03:03] ask for nothing less than your double.
[1:03:05] That's why I say your cup must run over.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; You're not asking enough.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; You must trouble God.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Say it's me again.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. The Lord a shout.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Don't get tired.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible say he's not weary. He can't
[1:03:20] get tired.
[1:03:23] [Applause]
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; You may be see sometime people call the
[1:03:29] pastor didn't mean to disturb you. But
[1:03:30] that's what he's there for to be
[1:03:31] disturbed.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And sometime you think that thing to
[1:03:34] God. You don't want to disturb God. So
[1:03:35] you got some time. Time for what? He not
[1:03:37] in time.

[1:09:19] had to stick back that man ear and say
[1:09:21] brethren don't move like
[1:09:23] If you live by the sword,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; you will die by the sword.

[1:09:29] to use is the word.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Don't bring I am business and so on.
[1:09:32] That man was healed

[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; When it fell on those seeds, he chose
[1:09:44] them, right?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; They were predestined seed. They hold
[1:09:50] themselves up in the upper room. All
[1:09:52] right.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; These seeds, are you ready?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; The word was laying on deer without life
[1:10:00] in it.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; What's the secret?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; The word in a bride.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; So listen to this, Gideon. They went up
[1:10:08] in the upper room.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Without life in the seed.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Seed is there.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Word is there.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; They're dry.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Dry seeds.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Waiting for water. Yeah,
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; water is spirit.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Try seas waiting for water.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; If the devil could disconnect the sea
[1:10:26] from the water, nothing happen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; But once water hit that sea, there's
[1:10:32] trouble
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; because it mean life have to manifest
[1:10:36] itself. Life can't help it. It's an
[1:10:39] automatic law.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; It's the law of God. Once this water hit
[1:10:44] the seed, it has to it must it is
[1:10:48] necessary. It is compulsory for that
[1:10:51] seed to produce itself because the law
[1:10:55] in Genesis say every seed must bring
[1:10:59] forth after its kind.
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:03] [Applause]
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you you are different
[1:11:10] kind.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're different kind of species.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; They have serpent seed on the earth.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; They're looking like humans,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; but there's not.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; They are vipers. The family of snake and
[1:11:20] serpent and evil and whatnot. They can't
[1:11:22] help it. They automatic with it. And if
[1:11:25] God put the law in the fish and the fish
[1:11:27] don't run down and say, you know what, I
[1:11:28] feeling let to fly this evening. The the
[1:11:31] fish will die
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; because God put no law in fish to fly
[1:11:35] and the birds are going straight down
[1:11:36] and diving and taking a a deep dive, the
[1:11:39] bird will die. The law in the bird is to
[1:11:42] fly. The law in the fish is to swim. The
[1:11:44] law is a law in a Christian. What you
[1:11:46] think that law is there for?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. There's a law inside
[1:11:50] of you. The the law in the fish, it's
[1:11:53] not outside. The fish don't take out a
[1:11:55] fish mantle and say he put on fins.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; He go and put on fins to go and take a
[1:11:59] swim. The fish doesn't wear spins. He
[1:12:02] have that built in. The birds go say and
[1:12:05] buy some wings. You're going to check
[1:12:07] out BWIA to find how the planers fly.
[1:12:10] The bird not in that. The bird have the
[1:12:12] winds built in. And the Christian, you
[1:12:15] the believer have said Mark 16 that
[1:12:18] built in these signs shall follow them
[1:12:22] that believe. This is built in. When you
[1:12:24] leave here and you go back to your home,
[1:12:27] you're going to speak them demons
[1:12:29] completely out of your home. This is
[1:12:31] built in. This is warfare. This is
[1:12:33] taking back what the devil took from
[1:12:35] you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This
[1:12:37] is taking back. This is taking the
[1:12:39] authority in my name. They shall cast
[1:12:42] out devils in my name. They're going to
[1:12:46] speak with new tongues.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I say that time is at hand for Mark 16
[1:12:56] to be in action.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Time for miracles, time for signs,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; time for wonders. Oh, glory to God.
[1:13:04] Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; So, they were there. My God, just have
[1:13:07] about a few more minutes.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; They were there dry seats
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; in the upper room and all of a sudden,
[1:13:13] he said, "Watch." All of a sudden, as
[1:13:15] the waters begin to begin to gush down,
[1:13:18] it actually filled the house where they
[1:13:21] were sitting and the seeds begin to
[1:13:23] grow.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; It begin to manifest itself.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; So, friends, you have not seen me
[1:13:28] manifested yet. All you've seen is
[1:13:31] prophecy. All hearing is prophecy. What
[1:13:33] we have had all these years has been the
[1:13:35] testimony of Jesus. What we had all
[1:13:37] these years because we went and take the
[1:13:39] book from the angel's hand. He said thou
[1:13:41] must prophesy again. And we are
[1:13:43] prophesying again of a revival of a
[1:13:46] breakthrough of the appointment of the
[1:13:47] Holy Ghost of the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:49] Ghost and fire. We are prophesying
[1:13:51] again. In this time of lingering, we are
[1:13:54] being tested. But we're not waiting for
[1:13:56] this clouds to prophesy rain. When there
[1:13:58] is no clouds, we say it's going to rain
[1:14:00] anyhow. The problem is not the rain. The
[1:14:03] problem is the seed. Because rain coming
[1:14:05] anyhow. Nobody going to stop this rain.
[1:14:08] Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:18] Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Remember
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Genesis said, "Every seed will have to
[1:14:26] bring after it kind."
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Remember the earth is full of seeds and
[1:14:31] the rain makes it bring forth after its
[1:14:34] kind.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; So God throw out the seeds. You don't
[1:14:37] know who is who but the rain coming
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; to prove no matter
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; and when the rain come is no longer to
[1:14:43] prophesy. There's no need to prophesy.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; All the time they prophesy Messiah
[1:14:47] coming, Messiah coming, Messiah coming.
[1:14:49] But when John said, "Behold the lamb of
[1:14:50] God." Prophecy finished.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; It finished. Now it went from John the
[1:14:55] prophet prophet to the prophecy the
[1:14:56] fulfilled.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; So Christ was the fulfillment of the Old
[1:15:00] Testament. He cap off the Old Testament.
[1:15:02] Become the cornerstone of the New
[1:15:04] Testament where he built his church that
[1:15:06] was going to add seven ages. And during
[1:15:08] them ages, we fell down into the ground.
[1:15:10] Up come Luther, he's bringing up
[1:15:12] something. Up come Wesley, he's bringing
[1:15:14] up something. Up come the Pentecost.
[1:15:16] They're bringing up something. Here
[1:15:18] come. Hallelujah. With the entire
[1:15:20] mystery of God, the full word, the open
[1:15:23] book to bring back sons back upon the
[1:15:26] face of the earth. The devil in a ride.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Not this time. Not this time. This bride
[1:15:33] is not like evil. She going to be the
[1:15:36] word. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:15:38] house. I feel the anointing of God. Oh,
[1:15:42] hallelujah.
[1:15:44] Hallelujah.
[1:16:02] My God.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:16:06] leave all the chemicals in different
[1:16:08] books and tapes.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Men just playing. This is oxygen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; This is nitrogen. They playing a tape
[1:16:13] with nitrogen.
[1:16:15] They bring a tape with oxygen in it,
[1:16:17] sulfur in it, sodium in it. But God will
[1:16:20] have some spiritual scientists that
[1:16:22] they're going to take from here, add
[1:16:24] here, take from here, add here, shake it
[1:16:28] here, pour it here. My God, God,
[1:16:32] spiritual scientist. And you will hear
[1:16:34] an explosion. You're going to create a
[1:16:36] revival. He said, "What we see should
[1:16:39] make a church." Praise God. Should make
[1:16:41] a what we see. We're supposed to do
[1:16:44] something. Make a church where a revival
[1:16:46] break out. And we're going to say the
[1:16:48] seven thunders that's not being written
[1:16:50] is being made manifested because God has
[1:16:53] spiritual scientists in this last day of
[1:16:56] the mind of God to know how to put the
[1:16:58] word together for the fire to fall. Your
[1:17:01] faith this evening is being anointed.
[1:17:03] You're going to pull on the fire. You're
[1:17:05] going to pull on the Holy Ghost. You're
[1:17:07] going to pull on the power of God. We're
[1:17:08] going to have a revival.
[1:17:11] Listen
[1:17:28] to this. The seed must have seed water
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; before it could grow.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; It must have water to fall before the
[1:17:38] seed has planted to grow. Now remember
[1:17:40] the word mor u r e h morin's teaching
[1:17:43] for marine morin's teaching and it have
[1:17:46] l rain
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; have teaching rain

[1:17:54] mysteries when that is over

[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; where is the Lord God of Elijah
[1:18:09] with one thing left rain.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's the prophecy. We unsealing it
[1:18:14] this evening. Seal not the sayings of
[1:18:17] the prophecy of this book.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; My God, I got over no other church, but
[1:18:23] fire going to fall in this place. Rain
[1:18:25] going to fall in this place. My God has
[1:18:28] already started. We are anointed. You
[1:18:31] are anointed. The anointing is upon you.
[1:18:34] When you go home, open your mouth. When
[1:18:37] you open a door, speak it. Say, "The
[1:18:40] anointing is upon me." Walk in with the
[1:18:43] anointing. Believe the anointing is upon
[1:18:45] you. Whatever you touch going to be
[1:18:47] anointed. Oh, glory to God. It was in
[1:18:51] their hands. It was in their feet. It
[1:18:53] was in their tongue. It was all over
[1:18:56] them. Oh, it going to be all over you.
[1:18:58] Fire was upon them. Fire of the Holy
[1:19:01] Ghost. Oh, give the Lord some praise
[1:19:03] this people. How many of you inspired
[1:19:05] this evening? How many feel anointed
[1:19:07] this evening?

[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You will be seated.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Almost true.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Prophecy.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; The latter rain
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; is fixing to fall.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He was talking about God telling
[1:19:25] Abraham, Sarah, I'm going to visit you
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; according to the time of life.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to have that baby you
[1:19:30] waited on.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; The latter rain is fixing to fall. You
[1:19:35] held that seed in there
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; long enough.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Believe him.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; You're looking for a coming son and he
[1:19:42] is coming.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You're pregnant with
[1:19:47] God.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you didn't hear me this evening.
[1:19:50] You didn't hear me this evening. You are
[1:19:52] pregnant with God. You have the seed of
[1:19:56] God inside of you. You're going to
[1:19:58] produce Messiah. Messiah going to live.
[1:20:01] Messiah going to walk in Trinidad. You
[1:20:03] know what the Messiah is? Anointed word.
[1:20:06] When the word is anointed, it produces
[1:20:09] Messiah. The word is a seed. You are
[1:20:13] that seed. The anointing will come upon
[1:20:16] you.
[1:20:20] Sit down a minute. Sit down a minute.
[1:20:23] What did Jesus say when he went to the
[1:20:26] temple? He found Isaiah 61. What was
[1:20:29] Jesus words? The spirit is upon me. Oh,
[1:20:33] hallelujah. Did you get that? He was the
[1:20:36] full seed and he had to come and say,
[1:20:38] "The spirit is upon me for he had
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; anointed me." That's what we talking
[1:20:45] about. You have to be anointed. You will
[1:20:48] say what Jesus said. The spirit is upon
[1:20:51] me for he hath the Lord himself. He hath
[1:20:56] anointed me. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:20:58] praises, people. You are coming into
[1:21:00] your anointing. You are coming into your
[1:21:02] inheritance. You are coming into your
[1:21:04] authority. You're coming into the
[1:21:06] witness of the spirit.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; You say, "You see why I've been so
[1:21:13] zealous of the kind of seed that he
[1:21:16] planted for the body.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; The rain is going to fall pretty soon.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; The real rain.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; But it has to have seed to fall on. If
[1:21:25] the rain fall and there's no seed, you
[1:21:27] got landside,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; you get floods,
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; but God have to put in a seed.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Is the seed inside of you this evening?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, what is that
[1:21:40] gospel light? What does it do? The Holy
[1:21:42] Spirit, what does it do? It ripens the
[1:21:43] crop. And in the last days, the Holy
[1:21:45] Spirit will pour out in time in the last
[1:21:47] days to bring in the latter rain,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; the real rain.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; My God. First you have to have the rain
[1:21:54] where we still planting the knowledge
[1:21:55] seed and bring forth unbelief and so on.
[1:21:57] But then why every seed but after his
[1:22:00] kind. God made man in his image and of
[1:22:02] his kind and his to be his word on the
[1:22:04] earth. He expressed it in Jesus Christ.
[1:22:06] What was it? God was in Christ. That's a
[1:22:09] man after his kind. God made man in his
[1:22:12] own image after his kind. His kind is
[1:22:14] what the word.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Then watch.
[1:22:20] What are we to be sons of God with the
[1:22:23] express word in the church carrying on?
[1:22:25] That's the mystical body of Christ
[1:22:28] carrying on the same works. God is
[1:22:29] longing when we could carry on the same
[1:22:32] works. Sitting in a pew is not carrying
[1:22:33] our works. Thousands of church people
[1:22:35] sit and go in churches and so on. That's
[1:22:37] that his works is his life flowing
[1:22:40] through us.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; When we become a pipe, dead, emptied
[1:22:43] out, turned upside down and there's no
[1:22:45] hindrance to the flow of the spirit. And
[1:22:47] God must say, "There is my spirit
[1:22:50] flowing freely." Friends, I'm closing.
[1:22:52] Musician, come on, please. I believe in
[1:22:53] my heart that we have turned a corner. I
[1:22:56] believe that something is about to break
[1:22:58] forth.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; I believe the time is at hand.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't only believe that. You have
[1:23:02] got to believe it also.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And if you believe it, then you must act
[1:23:06] on it. You must act upon what you
[1:23:08] believe. If you believe the anointing
[1:23:09] upon you, don't be afraid to pray. If
[1:23:11] you're throwing the word prayer with the
[1:23:12] eye open, pray for them when the eye
[1:23:13] closed.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; But pray. Pray over them. Pray around
[1:23:16] them. Pray in the home. Pray in the
[1:23:18] kitchen. Pray in the drawing room. Pray
[1:23:19] on the street. Praying when you're
[1:23:20] traveling. Do like you're talking on
[1:23:22] your phone and and you're talking like
[1:23:24] you're talking to nobody. But praise
[1:23:25] God. But you're praying. You're talking
[1:23:26] to God. What you doing? You're keeping
[1:23:28] the atmosphere. The devil want to break
[1:23:30] the atmosphere. That's why you want to
[1:23:32] have confusion between husband and wife,
[1:23:33] mother and daughter, father and son. You
[1:23:35] want to create disturbances to get you
[1:23:37] out of the atmosphere because once
[1:23:39] you're out in the atmosphere, the
[1:23:40] channel is cut, the pipe is cut. It's
[1:23:42] broken. But we just ste the atmosphere.
[1:23:44] They want to carry on to throw you off
[1:23:45] and you're holding your peace. Better
[1:23:47] keep a tongue. Keep your tongue still.
[1:23:48] Don't say nothing. Hold your peace. Keep
[1:23:50] the atmosphere and watch that snake.
[1:23:53] Once you keep quiet enough, you're going
[1:23:54] to see the snake moving. And once you
[1:23:56] could see when he moving, don't don't wh
[1:23:58] him. Just time him
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and then cut the head off.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Take that head off. Don't wh that snake
[1:24:04] now. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you wh him,
[1:24:06] he might run and hide somewhere else.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let him walk. Let him walk like in
[1:24:09] the ceiling. You're watching him.
[1:24:12] You're watching him.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Just have the cut lash ready.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And when you when you see him in a good
[1:24:16] spot, take his head off.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Cash that serpent. Stamp on his head.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God bless
[1:24:27] you. Seal up the sins of the prophecy of
[1:24:31] this book.
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise. Hallelujah. Give
[1:24:39] him praise this evening. Glory to God.
[1:24:41] Hallelujah. Oh, give him a shout. Give
[1:24:44] him a worship. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:47] Hallelujah.
[1:24:48] What a message tonight.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Anointing
[1:25:03] will fall on me.
[1:25:07] Oh, anointing.
[1:25:12] Oh, let it fall on me.
