We thank you for your promises tonight. We thank you for your grace because your grace is sufficient to us, Lord. Father, you come to this service tonight. May you have the preeminence in this service. May you bless those that are here in the sanctuary. Bless those that are connected online. Father, may you have your perfect will as we approach your sacred scriptures. May you speak directly to us. May you open our understanding to the word as it goes forth, Father. May you break chains and break shackles, Father. Lord, we commit this service over to you tonight in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church says, &gt;&gt; amen and amen. I greet you tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And if you have your Bibles, would you turn with me to one portion of scripture, reading second Peter uh one and reading from verse one tonight. Second Peter 1 verse one. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, ye shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly unto the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them and be established in the present truth. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. And it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord tonight and to have time and fellowship uh in the middle of the week when you have a choice of what to do, but you have chosen to dedicate this time to serve the Lord. Whether it's here in the sanctuary or connected at home, wherever you might be, we are so happy to be connected under the power of the Lord. And we're looking for God to do great things among us. &gt;&gt; For a title tonight, partakers of the divine nature by these exceeding great and precious promises. &gt;&gt; Partakers of the divine nature by these exceeding great and precious promises. From that scripture we read, the Bible says in verse four, whereby are given unto us as exceeding great and precious promises that by these so there's a connection between the divine nature and the promises of God. &gt;&gt; So the the promises of God, these exceeding great and precious promises is the pathway or what gives us access into the divine nature. Can the church say amen? And we are promised to have access to that divine nature because our nature is no good to begin with. Can the church say amen? So we are looking for God to do something powerful in us. Everything has a nature. This the the the environment. There's a nature in a school. There's a nature in a church. There's a nature in a home. There's a nature in a country. There's a nature in a man. Everybody has their own nature. When people come together, it's a mix of different kinds of nature. When you talk about the nature of something, it's the characteristic of the thing. Some people their nature is they are sad. Some people their nature is they are happy. Some people their nature is they are positive. When you meet them you're happy to meet them because they're positive. &gt;&gt; There's a statement everyone lights up a room. Some people light up the room when you walk into the room. Some people light up the room when they walk out the room &gt;&gt; but everybody lights up the room. Somebody when they walk in the room you're happy to see them. Some people when they leave the room you're happy they gone. And it has to do with their nature, their disposition, the way they approach life. This is why brother Brandon would say we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth because our nature is supposed to be a happy nature. If you are called and your name is on the book then depression should not be part of your nature. Frustration shouldn't be part of your nature. Not that there won't be situations come that could get you into a feeling or a mood because Elijah end up on a in a in a kind of depressed state but something came to him that told him you are more than that kind of church. It reminded him of his nature. Hallelujah. And this is why when the prophet would preach about spiritual amnesia, it's to remind us of our nature. Our true nature, who you really are. You are not the house you live in. You are not the family you grew up in. You are not the product of your circumstance. You are not the product of your school. You are not the product of your family line. There is an eternal nature called a divine nature. And we are supposed to have part we supposed to partake of that divine nature which is God's own nature. Because when Adam was formed there in the garden of Eden in the book of Genesis, he was made in the image and likeness of God. Two things, image and likeness. But man fell from that and God had to create a way for us to get back into image and likeness. Hallelujah. Look like him, but walk like him. Talk like him. Live like him. Believe like him. Have faith like him. image and likeness. The divine nature of God. And when the Holy Ghost comes upon your life, it changes your nature. It changes your attitude. It changes your expectation. It changes your hope. It puts you into a state of mind that all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In that same scripture he read, he said, "For God had given us all things pertaining to life and godliness." Hallelujah. Peter is exalting them. The same Peter who denied Christ. The same Peter who made mistakes could come and root the church. He say I would not be negligent. But I want to remind you of who you really are. You have a divine nature. You have a theophony. You have a destination. Your past does not define you. Your mistakes do not define you. How you fail doesn't define you. The divine nature speaks for you tonight. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what the devil doesn't like. He doesn't like your divine nature because he cannot get that kind of nature. He's not made that way. &gt;&gt; When you meet somebody, they say, "This is how I'm made up." &gt;&gt; This is my personality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes our experiences affect us in a certain kind of a way. So when you see a person at a certain age behaving in a certain way, they are the product of their history. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are the product of the neighborhood they grew up in. &gt;&gt; And if we live in that state all the time, then we will be forever a product of your environment. &gt;&gt; Psychologists and these people trying to understand the difference between nurture and nature. &gt;&gt; What your DNA and your your genetic makeup is versus your environment. &gt;&gt; They say you take anybody and put them in the wrong environment, they manifest the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can the church say amen? But your DNA, the way you made up, your your disposition. Hallelujah. It is a reflection of your home and your environment is both. &gt;&gt; Now the scripture can make sense. Where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth? What environment were you in? What state were you in? What is your genealogy? This why the prophet could say, I am not the son of child and Ella Branham. I am not who my parents say I am. My bloodline goes deeper than the house I was born into. Hallelujah. I know where my roots are really buried. And we are here in the house of God to be in the environment. Hallelujah. For God to do something upon us. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; A change of nature, a change of attitude, a change of disposition, a change of behavior, something is going to come over to you to remind you. That's why the prophet would say the moment the bride gets to know who she is, then the rapture is going to go. The rapture is not waiting on Russia. The rapture is not waiting on the pope. The rapture is waiting on the bride to come to know who she is. Then the rapture is going to go. It means the bride has to connect to who she really is. Because many of us, we have lost our identity. Because when you see your name, when you see your identity, when you see who you are, the divine mystery of who you are, you can't help but worship. You could be in your office, but you worship. You could be at home, but you worship. You create an atmosphere because you're built to do that. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet speaks about God is identified by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; So you know who is a believer by their characteristics. &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask them if you're a Christian. Their behavior tells you. &gt;&gt; Their actions tells you. Their characteristics tell you. The way they dress tell you. what they're interested in tells you who they are. Where they spend their time tells you because if your nature is an artist, you'll be attracted to art galleries. &gt;&gt; You'll be attracted to see what other artists doing. You'll spend your time in the business of art. If you're a musician, you want to hear good music. You want to play good music. Anybody with me? If you're a singer, you like to hear good singing. You want to practice. You go to to singing practice because your nature, you just find yourself liking that kind of a thing. But if you're a Christian, then you want to be in church. You want to be in the presence of God. You want to find a scripture to speak to you because that's your identity. It is not work to you. You don't have to work up something because your nature thirst for something. This is why this is not for everybody. We would love for this to be for everybody, but it's my nature. That's why I'm in the house of God. I can't help myself. Yes, we make mistakes. Yes, we struggle. But my nature brings me back to the house of God. Oh, you don't hear me tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My nature picks me up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something in me. That's why the prophecy say you are not even the believer, &gt;&gt; but the word in you, &gt;&gt; that's the believer. That's who you really are. That's your spiritual identity. It's more important than your job. It's more important than your family. It's more important than your troubles. It's more important that the trials because the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us because our nature is crying for something there. There's a deep calling to a deep there's got to be a deep to respond. I cannot put a desire in you. But if there's a desire in you, there's a seed in there and that seed must bring forth after its kind. It's the nature of the seed to produce itself. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not trying to make you seed. Because you are seed, you could be reborn. Because you are seed, you could get the Holy Ghost. Because you are seed, you shall be perfected. Because you are seed. You are going to be adopted. The preaching of the word is not to produce seeds. It's to pour water upon the seeds. It's to create the environment among the seeds. Can the church say amen? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why when you invite someone to the house of God, it's not to make them a seed. You can't make anybody a seed. &gt;&gt; But when you invite them and the word goes forth, it doesn't matter what it is. The seed in them gets quickened. &gt;&gt; They could come into one service and something gets sparked in their soul. They can't explain it. They don't know too much about it, but they say, "What you're talking about, that's me. &gt;&gt; I know I'm not from this world. I know there's something greater than me. I can't put it into words, but I always knew from the moment I was born, there was something that was pulling me in a certain direction. I tried a Methodist church. I tried a Baptist church. I tried drugs. I tried this. I tried that. But when I heard this prophet's cry and the prophet scream, "That's my name." It was the eagle to eagle call. Can the church say amen? [Applause] to think &gt;&gt; that almighty God &gt;&gt; called us to partake of his nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a call that you could partake of his nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know the God I serve as a nature. &gt;&gt; His nature is forgiveness. His nature is love. His nature is mercy. His nature is grace. His nature is to avenge the brokenhearted. His nature is to lift up the weary. His nature is to comfort them that mourn. Uh his nature is to preach to the lost. Uh his neighbor is to break the yolks and chains and the bondage. His nature is to see the sick heal. That's his nature. He can't help himself. His nature is to do that which is perfect. He is perfect. He cannot be perfected. He is already perfect. And we are being called to partake of his divine nature. It's a perfect nature. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray this encourages you tonight. Here in the house, here in your home, where you might be, you are predestinated to reflect his nature. When Adam was there on the earth, he was a perfect reflection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Image &gt;&gt; and likeness. &gt;&gt; God was pleased. God said it was good. He said it looks good. He walking like me. He talking like me. He has the power to name. He has the power to speak. He has the power to do what I do. Hallelujah. Image and likeness. He was in the divine nature. Nothing was out of order. And if God had left it like that, nothing would ever ever gone wrong. &gt;&gt; But there's a deeper mystery in there because God's nature also wanted fellowship. Yes, &gt;&gt; God knew what it was like when he was L l Elohim and he was the self-existent one. He didn't like the feeling when he was alone. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? God doesn't like to be alone. So, we know God created the angels and and the angels worship him and he was now changed from llo Elohim to God himself, the object of worship. And that was not enough for him &gt;&gt; because the angels could only have a certain kind of worship with him. He wanted a deeper, more intimate kind of relationship. Hallelujah. Not just a worship relationship, but he wanted to touch and feel and lift up and encourage. Hallelujah. And he couldn't encourage the angels because they didn't need to be encouraged. He didn't have to lift up the angels because they never Oh, come on now. Somebody preach back to me. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I want us to remember church, the lamb was slain before &gt;&gt; the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Which means that when God put Adam in the Garden of Eden, lamb was already slain. &gt;&gt; Provision already made for redemption. &gt;&gt; Provision already made for restoration. Provision already made for healing. provision already made to pay the price. Before Adam was there, Adam didn't know the mystery of it. But before Adam was there, blood was already Oh, come on now. Somebody preach back to me. &gt;&gt; The divine nature of God put a backup plan in place. Put a system in place. Put a way to catch man whenever he falls. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; So the God in his wisdom, &gt;&gt; he looked at man in his perfect condition. And I want us to catch this. &gt;&gt; God could have left Adam, brother Punch, in that perfect condition, &gt;&gt; untouched. Because there was no room for the devil to move in because God spoke directly to Adam. &gt;&gt; Adam was so clear on his purpose, his mission, his mandate, his objective that the devil couldn't come near him. &gt;&gt; And God could have left it like that. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; But God looked at him &gt;&gt; and in the whole work of creation with a clearance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every day he said, "It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good." And when you look at man, he said, "It's not good &gt;&gt; for man to be alone." Amen. &gt;&gt; And God did what we call the divine setup. &gt;&gt; Because God put Eve there knowing full well what was about to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, God is not surprised when you make a mistake. &gt;&gt; God is not surprised with what your children do. There's nothing could surprise God. God knew blood was already put there in place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But friends, if you never fall or get in trouble, you will never understand mercy. &gt;&gt; Many times we talk about God wanted to express his attributes. &gt;&gt; That's one part of it. &gt;&gt; But Adam himself could not appreciate grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's one thing to speak about God wanting to be a father and wanting to be a healer and wanting to be a redeemer. And by the progress of what unfolding, he could also display these attributes. But man himself, Adam, could not tell you about grace. &gt;&gt; He couldn't share what mercy feels like. He couldn't testify of how it feels when you think you could never come back and mercy holds you and holds your hand and say, "Yes, there's a way for you to come back. Put it under the blood." &gt;&gt; Adam couldn't testify about the sea of forgetfulness. You know how much I thank God for the sea of forgetfulness? Oh, you don't hear me tonight. Oh, somebody preach back to me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Adam in his fallen condition had more revelation than he did in his perfect condition &gt;&gt; because he could speak differently through his experiences. &gt;&gt; God allowed him through a journey that he could know what it was like to be in the Garden of Eden be told you have to step out and know that there has to be better way back or you have to get back to Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? And God in his mercy put things in place including now promises &gt;&gt; that the Bible call exceeding great and precious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Talk about the descriptive nature of God. &gt;&gt; Exceeding great and precious. &gt;&gt; The word exceeding alone is a big word. &gt;&gt; Because to exceed already means beyond. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you really see what God is unfolding, it makes you excited of them. So God say exceeding great and precious. &gt;&gt; So you see now if the promises are not identified, if the promises are not preached, if you don't speak about the promises in your home, if you don't begin to speak against the negativity in your life by the promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because many of us we talk about my arthritis and my high blood pressure and my back pain. What's the promise? That's exceeding and great &gt;&gt; and precious because by his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; If you don't plead the promise &gt;&gt; because the promise is a mechanism brother George to get you into the divine nature. You know &gt;&gt; because we are supposed to be an expression of the divine nature. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; There are many people will never read a book but you are the book &gt;&gt; that they will read &gt;&gt; the expression of the divine nature of God. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I trust in some way this is an encouragement to you tonight &gt;&gt; that you are reminded that there's a higher nature for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; A thing is by nature its essential characteristics. And this is why when we speak about nature, you take a pig. I talk about you take a pig and put cologne on the pig. You put perfume on the pig. You put cream, you take it into a manicure, a pedicure, whatever kind of cure, &gt;&gt; put a bow tie on the pig. &gt;&gt; You lock the pig in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That pig will behave if he's locked in the house for as long as you keep him locked in the house. &gt;&gt; That pig, if you keep the pig locked in church, he will never live like he outside of church because there's no room for him to get out of the church. &gt;&gt; He will come to church for years and behave like a saint, smelling like a saint, dress like a saint. Once the door is locked, &gt;&gt; you will only see sane behavior. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me tonight? But the day the deacon forget to lock the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The day the pig see the door crack open by a &gt;&gt; that pig heading straight out. And it don't matter how long the perfume was applied, how long he was dressed in the suit and tie, how long once the door get open, he heading straight for the mud &gt;&gt; and doing a backflip, doing the doggy paddle, doing everything he could do because it's his nature. &gt;&gt; This is why the prophet would say falling in the mud is not the problem. You know, &gt;&gt; cuz you see when the lamb fall into the mud, it bleachs, it cries. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But when the pig fall, he wallow. &gt;&gt; The problem with it, George has done murder him. &gt;&gt; Because both will fall into the mud. &gt;&gt; We born in sin, shaped iniquity. You'll make mistakes. The problem is if you're wallowing &gt;&gt; or you're crying &gt;&gt; because the wallow or the cry is what speaks to what is your true nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Some people the moment they get a break to go out and this is why I say when people backslide you see them backslide and they went this and they doing that and doing that it's not they change the nature was always there. &gt;&gt; People have brought their behavior into a certain level of subjection but the nature is only changed by the &gt;&gt; new birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost come upon you and now burn out the snake &gt;&gt; and the snake gone, &gt;&gt; you say a new heart I'll give you, a new spirit I'll give you. I'll put my spirit in there. &gt;&gt; You can't find yourself in the mud wallowing. If you slip your cry, say Lord, help me. Deliver me. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be in this position. I don't belong here. I know I don't belong here. [Music] And that's why I encourage the church, encourage the young people, don't ever lose the desire to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you want to know if you're called, if there's a desire in there, God plays a desire in there. Even when you ask the question, I don't know if I'm going to make it. I don't know if I'm called. The fact that they're asking the question speaks of a desire inside of your soul for more of God that's speaking for something greater. &gt;&gt; So don't be discouraged by your mistakes. Don't be discouraged by how many times you fall. Be encouraged and get back up. &gt;&gt; There's not one character in scripture who didn't have a mistake. It didn't fall. Didn't make a mistake. And that's what the blood and redemption is for. But we are striving to perfection. We are striving for divine love. We are striving to produce a living faith, a living virtue, a living knowledge, a living temperance, a living patience, a living godliness, a living brotherly kindness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we come into this world with our nature. Some people their nature is impatient. Some people have too much patience. &gt;&gt; Is your nature because this is not the spirit now. This is just you. &gt;&gt; You have so much patience. Your life falling apart and then you're doing nothing. You're just patient. Because we all have excuses to align with our nature. So some people their personality some are go-getter some go-getter nothing is their nature &gt;&gt; some people is a product of their country their background whatever it might be their nature propels them to do something &gt;&gt; but God has a divine nature &gt;&gt; and that's what we want to look to that's what we want to understand that's the spirit that we want to begin to drive us &gt;&gt; because the men of God reached a point where they said nothing unless God wanted them to speak it was no longer a feeling Let I feel in it. No. What God wants you to do, you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And we have a promise to be partakers of his divine nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses was a partaker of the divine nature. &gt;&gt; Joshua was a partaker of the divine nature. Brother Brham was a partaker of the divine nature. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they that worship him must worship him in spirit &gt;&gt; and in truth &gt;&gt; and in truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From the message oneness. &gt;&gt; Brother said that's God's purpose. &gt;&gt; And his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family, earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they become all one. Isn't that a beautiful picture? &gt;&gt; God in his family, father over all, supreme. No death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing, just joy unspeakable. Never to be sick, never to have a heartache, just one with God. What a picture. Because the very nature of God was in these people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And therefore what they did, they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From the message perseverant, brother Brandham said that's the reason that it wasn't the apostles. Jesus chose them all. Practically every one of them without even enough education to sign their name. He didn't choose priests. He didn't choose theologians. He chose fishermen and herdsmen, the ignorant and unlearned, so that he would take in his hand and take nothing and make something out of it. That's his nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So he doesn't take train schools and train scholars. He takes something that realizes it's nothing. &gt;&gt; He gets into it and makes something out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; In the message, he identified Christ of all ages. Just putting some quotes in here to encourage you. You see, all these things just portrayed Christ. He was a part of it. God doesn't change. His nature doesn't change. His character doesn't change. He is still the word. See, and Malachi 3:6 proves that he just changes his form for each age. Each age he has allotted part of word which has been prophesied would happen in certain days. Well, as that age comes along, God just moves in another form. See, it's God all the time. The word, the word made flesh and dwelt among us. The very nature of God. And brother Brandham said, if he healed in this way, at this time, and the same conditions are met, he'll have to do it again. If he filled with the Holy Ghost this time, in this way, he'll have to do it again. Because the nature is God is he cannot change. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. There's no problem that could exist in 2025 that God cannot deal with. He's the same God who could heal. He's the same God who could deliver. He could fix marriages. He could fix homes. He could break the bands of wickedness. I don't care what it is tonight, he is more than able. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; The nature of God. Hallelujah. So many have gotten so comfortable in the message to accept things as they are. God like to shake up the routine. He loves to break to us. God is an oddball and he wants us to be oddballs. He's not an ordinary God. He's an extraordinary God. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother Bam said, "Let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of revelation of Jesus Christ in the church." He knows this is Satan knows. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; you you catch this. &gt;&gt; And this is why people say, "I believe the message. I believe in the Lord and thing." Satan knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today. So Satan had to have a certain level of faith. No, I want us to appreciate because there are people who come to church don't realize he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he probably saying, "Satan knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever, and he changes not." &gt;&gt; But Brandham goes on, he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, Satan is coming in with a clear picture that God is still a healer. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows that that's not changing. The only power Satan has is on your mind to tell you you are going to remain sick. &gt;&gt; And that is the only weapon he has because he can't stop the healing. &gt;&gt; He can't stop the power. He knows what it was like to go against Jesus when Jesus was being tested in the wilderness. He knows that. But the B said it was like electric volts hit him. &gt;&gt; He knows what the power of God is. He knows what faith in action will produce. [Applause] anytime, any place under any condition. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologian. &gt;&gt; He knows that since God, speaking about his nature, is immutable in his nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he is just as immutable in his ways. Thus Satan, we talking about Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God, Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own, all else is false. It has to be. &gt;&gt; So if Satan knows that that church sin Mark 16 in action is a true church, then all hell is against St. Mark 16 in action. All hell is against signs, wonders, and miracles. All hell is against these signs shall follow them that believe. All hell is against they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. All hell is against as brother Brandham said one day we won't even lay hands on the sick. We will speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In another place where the say God hates a powerless church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we need bigger faith. &gt;&gt; We need more faith. We need bold faith. feet with heel on its chest. I shall be healed. My son is going to be delivered. Hallelujah. I'm going to be strong again. I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord. The right hand of the Lord do it valiantly. The right hand. Oh, come on now. Somebody help me tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let your faith rise to realize who you are. That you shall have the divine nature of God. Those gray hair going to get back black again. You have another body waiting for you if you drop this one because this 16 element pest house is not who you are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We are passing through. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is waiting on us. Moses is waiting on us. Joshua is waiting on us. Elijah waiting on us &gt;&gt; for us to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection. Somebody's got to do it. Why not you? &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to do it. Why not you? Yes, &gt;&gt; it's got to happen at some point. Why not now? It's going to happen somewhere. Why not here? We have faith to believe what we see. Hallelujah. Should put our souls into action to make a church, to make a revival. We believe that promise. And by these exceeding great and precious promises, we are becoming partakers. We are partaken tonight by the promise. The promise of revival, the promise of a seventh tender revival, the promise of a manifestation of the sons of God, the promise of a restoration of a super church as we near the headstone. And I believe tonight we are nearer the headstone than last Sunday. Oh, glory to God. We are nearer the headstone than last month. We are nearer the headstone than last year. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are stepping into our divine nature. Not about pride and about showcasing but more humble. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus nature is humble. &gt;&gt; Humility. &gt;&gt; Jesus was coming in the church normal. Normal and &gt;&gt; he slipped in there. &gt;&gt; He was in the temple as was his custom. &gt;&gt; Humble God power. But the public could imagine all of God. He pull it to Christ and Christ walking into the temple every Sunday and they don't even know who he was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The very nature of God. &gt;&gt; He don't make anybody feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The woman caught in the very act of adultery when they're about to stone her. &gt;&gt; He looked at her. He looked at the men. He say, "All right, I know what the book say, &gt;&gt; but you without sin &gt;&gt; cast the first stone." Watch the nature of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He turn away because he don't listen them fellas in the wrong you don't want to embarrass them. So you let them leave gracefully. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The nature of God. Brother George don't embarrass people in &gt;&gt; he is defending the woman because her name is on the book because the only reason he's there is because her name is on the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't take it out on the men who after her. &gt;&gt; He turns his back and say whoever don't have sin cast the first stone. and he let them leave with their dignity. &gt;&gt; The nature of God. &gt;&gt; So when you see people embarrassing people and and that is not God &gt;&gt; God is mercy. He's a gentleman. He's a God of judgment. Don't make no mistake about it. &gt;&gt; He's a God of judgment. &gt;&gt; But he's a gentleman. He's gracefully jud he's a graceful judge. &gt;&gt; He's a way he operates. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Righteous indignation, righteous anger, all that is fine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The nature of God, how you handle situations. &gt;&gt; Glor &gt;&gt; to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was sharing with brother sometime to say the way the prophet lived is such a rebuke to many of us today who in the message because the behavior because brother Abbrham had a display when they say he couldn't tell his enemies from his friend. That was a nature that was they didn't even know what Judas was going to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people now talk about giving people side eye. &gt;&gt; Jesus gave Judas no side eye. &gt;&gt; He look at Judah's funny. He said, "Whatever you do, do quickly." They told you going to do something that he was missing. He had to pick up some surprise thing for our G. They had no idea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At no point in time would they have ever suspected. And this is Jesus knowing the character of the man who was with him. My &gt;&gt; with the prophet they would say he couldn't tell his enemies from his friends &gt;&gt; us or forget it. &gt;&gt; We know your enemy. We know your friend. We know who you fall out with. Who you don't talk to? &gt;&gt; What is worse? You want to get other people to join the bandwagon. &gt;&gt; Don't talk to that one then because they fall out with me. &gt;&gt; You're going beyond you to include people in your conspiracy. &gt;&gt; That's that's the nature. But God is sending the word to us to change our nature to &gt;&gt; to make us reook our ways. &gt;&gt; The Bible say consider your ways. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot for those of you who are still desiring the Holy Ghost. There's a still a lot that you could do without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The promise of the Holy Ghost is yours, but there's no excuse for your bad behavior. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even without the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because forgiveness is a choice &gt;&gt; you can still drop your odds without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost as the very nature of God is God in you. But what is your excuse &gt;&gt; because you still have a choice? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you stand praying forgive &gt;&gt; that could stand independent of the Holy Ghost, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the brand of money when he preach what the holy ghost is given for. He speak but the Holy Ghost give you power to pray and power to do these things but you could pray without the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost come and give you power to do more. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So people relax sometimes and say well I contending and this is me and this is me and this is me. &gt;&gt; Are you looking at the word and trying to match up and to reflect the word because there's a nature. The nature is the template. The divine nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I trust this helps us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look here. I I I I was speaking about it and I have the quote here in why it had to be shepherd. Now you take a pig and you say to this pig, I'm really the prophet. I'm going to make you a lamb and you wash him and you paint his toenails and so forth and give him food like a sheep. This is the prophet. Give him some kind of a diet. Put him out on the floor out where the sheep herd in the alpha alpha field or something. If there's a mud hole anywhere, if you make a mistake and a mud hole anywhere, that hog will go just as straight to that mud hole as he can go. Why? Because his nature is still a hog. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason the church members today indulge in the things of the world. See, it's because their nature hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; They'll eat any kind of ecclesiastical theolog theological slop, but the word of God, they can't stand it. Can we take a little more &gt;&gt; in the message broken systems? Brother said you cannot make a man see the word of God till his nature has been changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this reframes our approach to from what you see is what you get to this is who I am to I want people to know me to I already looking to change my nature. The person who I came in here tonight as and the person I'm leaving tonight as need to be I need to see some kind of change. &gt;&gt; There must be a difference. &gt;&gt; The word comes to tell us, hey, you need to fix this. You need to change this. You cannot make a man see the word of God till his nature has been changed. And when his nature is changed from what he is to a son of God and the Holy Spirit comes into him, can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, God has a provided lamb. &gt;&gt; And now, how will he be known? How will we know him by his nature? What he does, his works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I'm just putting these quotes in there because these are the promises. You know, &gt;&gt; these are the promises that by these exceeding great and precious promises, we become partakers. Because if we leave here just with some concept or we feeling good and we don't understand that there's something higher &gt;&gt; because it's very easy to paint a picture of just keep coming to church and keep doing it and it'll be all right. But you must be clear on what you're looking for. &gt;&gt; You must have an expectation. You must have a desire to know I'm measuring up to the standard of the word. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Brother Brandham, in the message, you must be born again. He said, "What kind of nature have you got then, brother Brandham?" His nature. If I had my father's nature, then I do the things my father did. &gt;&gt; Now that I'm born again, it depends on who my father was. &gt;&gt; If you're just born in the church, you've got a church father &gt;&gt; and you can call him father if you want to. Is he prophet? &gt;&gt; You call him anything you want to because he's your father. But if your father is God, you see, but I'm making a distinction here. &gt;&gt; People are real church father. They they born in church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They have a concept of this thing. This is how we do things here. And he's saying your father is supposed to be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if your father is God and you're born in the family of God, you seek those things that pertain to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Then you are God's child. Your nature is God's nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother brings it back to church context. Oh, our church believes that the days of miracle is passed. How could you believe the day of miracle is passed when the very nature of God is in you? when he is alltogether miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this quote from the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want to because listen and and the little grace God has given for me to travel and see a few things. There are people in the message who don't believe in miracles. You know, &gt;&gt; word, word, word and no miracles in them. &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandham. How could you believe the days of miracle is passed when the very nature of God is in you? When he is alltogether miracle, &gt;&gt; his nature is miracle. His habits miracle, his whole being is miracle. How can you be anything else but miracle? &gt;&gt; Your new birth is miracle. Your new life is miracle. Even your nature is a miracle. &gt;&gt; That's the prophet. &gt;&gt; They want to push miracle to the Pentecostal. The Pentecostals and &gt;&gt; but there has to be miracles in the church. There must be signs and warnings in the church. There must be notes of praises of the power of Satan being broken, of the sick being healed, of deliverance to the captives, of the blind eyes popping open, of demons being cast out. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; That's what we see happen to put our church into action to make a church that will make a revival. There'll be miracles in the church, signs in the church, wonders in the church, not Pentecostal because the fullness of the word restores the fullness of the spirit to see real miracles of God, even the miracle of eternal life being imparted in the name of Jesus. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, we're not coming to church. And this is where when Gideon when the angel came to Gideon, he said, "If you if God is God, then where are all the miracles?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If this thing is real, then where are all the miracles? Hallelujah. There must be healing. There must be deliverance. There must be the power of Satan being broken. Satan must be under your feet. The Egyptians you see today, you will see them no more forever. I don't care what the bondage is, financial bondage, marital bondage, bondage in your family, whatever it might be, there has to be a miracle in your life. He's a miracle working God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you know about my God, he's a miracle working God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's not word only, the letter killer, but his spirit brings life. There must be a manifestation in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The days of miracles are now. You got to begin to claim it. I don't I can't speak for any other church, any other group. But as for me and my house, I'm in my office tonight. As for me and my house, as for this group that's part of the mandate of God for us, we will have a church with miracles. We will have a church with healing because the requirement is faith. And we can have perfect faith on a perfect message that's perfectly dovetailed with scripture. It's a vindicated message. And the promise still stands. These signs shall follow them that believe. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You have to believe for it. Thank you, brother Anthony. You have to believe for it. I don't care where your son is tonight. Believe for it. I don't care where your daughter is tonight. Believe for it. I don't care where your brother is tonight. Believe for it. I don't care what demon is holding up tonight. Believe for it. &gt;&gt; Satan, the blood of Jesus is against you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The divine nature of God is to do the impossible. &gt;&gt; He specializes in the impossible. If it was ordinary, we don't need him. [Applause] He specializes when the doctor can't do anything else. Oh God, help me tonight. &gt;&gt; But Brandham said God heals through music. He heals through medicines. He can heal through all these things. But when the doctor don't know what to do, &gt;&gt; that's when you need a miracle working God. I don't need a book. I don't need a tape just to have a tape and a book. I want the God of the book and the God of the tape to make himself known as a miracle working God. The rapture will be a miracle. The body change will be a miracle. Transformation of these elements will be a miracle. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Musician can get ready. I'm about to close out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is our promise. &gt;&gt; These are our promises. Your family has got to be delivered. &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad it looks. I don't care what they're wearing, what they're doing tonight, where they might be tonight. There's a miracle coming your way. &gt;&gt; Claim it. His divine nature will produce it. His divine nature will bring it to pass. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Give him praise. &gt;&gt; Give him worship. Give him glory. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hallelujah. Something is moving. Something is moving. Walk in it. Claim it. Leave with it. Take it where you're going. He's a miracle working God. May the Lord bless you. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
