[14:40] of your presence and we thank you for
[14:43] your word the word of Truth the lamp
[14:45] onto our feet the light onto our path
[14:47] father bless this session tonight may
[14:49] you get Glory and Honor in the name of
[14:52] Jesus we ask it amen and amen may God
[14:55] bless you and Welcome to our uh Bible to
[14:59] study tonight and we want to go straight
[15:01] into the word I pray and trust that
[15:04] you'll be inspired and be blessed so
[15:10] tonight I have a little title I'd like
[15:12] to share with you the action of
[15:17] preparation the
[15:19] action of
[15:21] preparation you feel to
[15:23] prepare then you prepare to
[15:26] feel true revelation
[15:29] brings you under
[15:31] expectation by preparation for
[15:37] manifestation true Revelation brings you
[15:40] on expectation why because true
[15:44] Revelation is Fai and Fai is what you
[15:47] are hoping for evidence of things not
[15:50] seen you are under expectation Faith or
[15:53] Revelation brings you dear and the
[15:56] evidence or proof or a view of true
[16:01] Revelation is how you prepare because
[16:04] your preparation is for a manifestation
[16:08] like Abraham the Revelation that God
[16:10] gave him not to Sarah to him Abraham he
[16:14] prepared booty he prepared crib he
[16:17] prepared himself because he knew Isaac
[16:19] was
[16:20] coming now God's idea of
[16:24] planning and
[16:26] prioritization is reflected in his
[16:29] operations in Genesis
[16:30] 1 through the darkness he spoke light
[16:34] day and night came into being the first
[16:37] day the second day and so forth now
[16:40] Genesis
[16:43] 1:26 we read this is our first scripture
[16:46] for tonight and God
[16:48] said let us make man in our image after
[16:52] our likeness let them have dominion over
[16:54] the fish of the sea over the fall of the
[16:57] air and over the cattle and over all the
[17:00] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[17:04] creep it upon the Earth so God created
[17:07] man in his own image and the image of
[17:11] God created he him male and female
[17:13] created he
[17:15] them this image let's call it the back
[17:19] part of
[17:20] man the part you can't
[17:24] see
[17:25] image spirit
[17:32] likeness
[17:34] then when man so then man then these are
[17:39] things that I I wrote on was God's seal
[17:42] of life on the Earth but
[17:45] hidden man then was the Capstone of
[17:49] God's
[17:50] creation the whales
[17:53] fouls Birds fishes creatures were all de
[17:58] in substance
[18:00] but man in Genesis 1 was there in spirit
[18:05] and Genesis 1 closed with these words in
[18:09] verse 31 and God saw everything that he
[18:12] had made and behold it was good and the
[18:16] evening and the morning were the sixth
[18:19] day so at
[18:21] 6 everything was completed so now we go
[18:25] to Genesis
[18:26] 2 and this is how it begins thus the
[18:30] heavens and the Earth were finished and
[18:32] all the hosts of them and on the seventh
[18:35] day God ended his work which he had made
[18:40] and he rested on the seventh day from
[18:44] all his work which he had made so note
[18:48] the planning and the intent of how God
[18:51] set creation up in the beginning in
[18:55] Genesis right on to where he say it's
[18:58] finish
[18:59] it is good it is so good that he could
[19:03] rest so everything is now sealed
[19:07] completed finish including the back part
[19:11] of man the spirit
[19:14] part now from the actual
[19:18] creation he's going to bring forth let's
[19:20] call it the front part of man the part
[19:23] that you can see this is Genesis 2 and
[19:27] the Lord God formed my Man Out of the
[19:30] Dust of the ground and breathed into his
[19:33] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[19:36] became a living
[19:38] soul and the Lord God planted a garden
[19:43] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[19:47] man whom he had for so we see here
[19:51] before he placed this physical man he
[19:55] planted a garden in a particular place
[19:59] and this shows how God prepares and give
[20:04] first order priority the things so God
[20:09] didn't just drop man on the earth no he
[20:12] prepared a place he prepared a garden he
[20:16] have a location for it and then he
[20:19] placed man
[20:20] dear so let's look at this now the order
[20:25] Darkness
[20:27] light day
[20:29] Sun Moon Waters moving creatures F
[20:37] whales creeping things
[20:40] Beast then
[20:42] man not as the others but as an image
[20:47] spirit being not yet visible or
[20:51] expressed a man that was instructed to
[20:55] have
[20:55] dominion over all others that were cre
[20:58] created before
[21:00] him went on to say there was no man to
[21:05] tell the
[21:06] ground man formed by dust of dust by
[21:11] dust was what God put on the earth to
[21:14] express this spirit being so God's
[21:18] objective was to get to Earth and then
[21:22] from Earth he gets to a man now God is
[21:27] going down deeper Genesis
[21:29] 25-1 17 and the Lord God took the man
[21:35] and put him into the Garden of Eden to
[21:37] dress it and to keep it so this man job
[21:42] assignment was given to him to dress and
[21:45] to keep along with Divine instructions
[21:48] because God spoke to this man now in a
[21:51] direct way about and the Lord commanded
[21:55] the man saying of every tree of the
[21:57] garden thou May has free eat but of the
[22:00] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou
[22:02] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[22:05] thou eatest thereof thou shall surely
[22:09] die watch the order of the Earth from
[22:12] the earth the man now from the
[22:16] man a woman another man one with a womb
[22:21] she was woman Genesis 2 this is God now
[22:25] so you could see he is not
[22:29] just doing
[22:30] things there's an
[22:32] order there's a priority there's a
[22:36] system he is using to get to where he
[22:39] wants to go so now man is finished
[22:42] Genesis one everything is done but
[22:44] you're not seen him Genesis 2 God took
[22:49] some dust for man and become a living
[22:52] Soul you could see him now that's a man
[22:54] that can tell the soil that's a man that
[22:57] can tend the garden that's a man who
[23:00] expressed in these senses could connect
[23:02] to the earth and the faith sent in his
[23:05] soul could connect to God this man in
[23:08] his
[23:09] Purity this man still have a hidden
[23:11] Mystery locked up inside of him and God
[23:15] is about to bring it out before he
[23:18] brings out the woman he gives the man
[23:21] instructions that he could eat of all
[23:23] the trees but that tree of the knowledge
[23:26] of Good and Evil don't eat it don't
[23:28] touch it the day you eat it you shall
[23:30] surely die so from this
[23:34] man woman came forward Genesis 2:21 and
[23:38] the Lord G cause a deep sleep to fall
[23:40] upon
[23:41] Adam and he slipped he took one of his
[23:45] ribs and close up the flesh instead
[23:47] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[23:50] had taken from man made he woman brought
[23:53] her unto the man Adam said this is now
[23:55] bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she
[23:58] shall be called woman because she was
[24:00] taken out of man so from
[24:03] Genesis you can see the mind of God and
[24:08] how it
[24:10] unfolds we
[24:12] must make
[24:14] preparation and we must understand how
[24:16] we have to priorize things and we have
[24:19] to take this
[24:21] seriously first things first so your
[24:26] preparation brings flesh to the
[24:28] expectation brought on by Revelation so
[24:31] so if somebody's not getting ready you
[24:33] be know something not
[24:35] clicking something not striken it you
[24:38] want to pass your exams your preparation
[24:41] will reflect in your studies you want to
[24:44] go and get a job your preparation will
[24:47] reflect in how you prepare for the job
[24:51] interview whatever field of endeavor
[24:54] whether it's business
[24:56] school house whatever it is your
[25:00] preparation brings evidence of what you
[25:03] are expecting let's
[25:06] continue so it's
[25:09] interesting that you know I think
[25:12] brother Bram said aane was here when
[25:14] Noah was here and car was here when Noah
[25:15] was here because the material that man
[25:18] uses is of the Earth all this So-Cal
[25:21] technology and silicon and and all this
[25:24] uh uh thing that they have is things
[25:26] that was always here
[25:28] but as man's mind grow and mind man
[25:32] learn and he gets inspiration he develop
[25:36] he transform from horse and buggy to
[25:38] motor car to airplane to astronaut to
[25:42] rocket science and everything else and
[25:44] this is how life is man was given to
[25:46] conquer to rule to Reign but he is using
[25:50] what is already here it's not a new
[25:53] material they're creating it's not a new
[25:56] something they're making it's what is
[25:57] already here here is transforming human
[26:00] life and God did something similar he he
[26:03] had the Earth he had man's Spirit form
[26:06] he take dust and whip up and Man became
[26:09] a living Soul this is what we have now
[26:14] here preparation is not a thought you
[26:17] know I'm thinking about it you know no
[26:20] preparation is an
[26:22] action so when you drill down into
[26:27] preparation you you begin to see how you
[26:30] ought to
[26:31] priorize to get into the position to get
[26:35] the results of your
[26:38] expectation so preparation is just let's
[26:41] say the top level of it but when you
[26:45] drill down there will be priorities in
[26:48] how you
[26:49] prepare this is the dictionary
[26:52] expression of
[26:54] preparation preparation the action or
[26:57] process
[26:59] of making something ready for use or
[27:02] service or getting ready for some
[27:05] occasion test or
[27:08] Duty
[27:10] preparation a state of being
[27:13] prepared preparation a preparatory act
[27:17] or measure so I like
[27:20] this preparation the action or process
[27:25] of making something ready for for use or
[27:30] service or getting ready for some
[27:33] occasion test or
[27:35] Duty that's the statement that we said
[27:38] in the beginning you fail to prepare
[27:42] then you prepare to fail so even if you
[27:46] are not going to succeed still in that
[27:49] way you it still be the best thing to be
[27:52] prepared because they say when
[27:54] preparation meets opportunity they call
[27:56] it a luck so an opportunity come your
[27:59] way and you're not ready you're not
[28:01] prepared you're not skilled you're not
[28:03] you don't have the qualification you
[28:05] don't it can't work but here Revelation
[28:09] 19:7 let us rejoice and be glad and give
[28:12] honor to him for the marriage of the
[28:15] Lamb is come and his wife had me fr the
[28:20] Amplified let us rejoice and Shout for
[28:23] Joy let us celebrate and ascribe to him
[28:26] glory and honor for the marriage of the
[28:27] land is at last has come his bride has
[28:31] prepared
[28:33] herself brother Bram talk about it
[28:36] overcoming it cannot be God pull you
[28:39] through the pipe and say to him that
[28:40] overcome it there are things that we
[28:42] have to do their ways their attitudes
[28:47] their behaviors the quality of spirit
[28:50] and so on that is what God expect of us
[28:54] Revelation 16:15 said behold I come a
[28:58] teeth blessed is he that watch and
[29:01] keepeth his garments Le he walk naked
[29:05] and see his
[29:06] shame so clearly this is showing we
[29:11] should not be caught off God but we
[29:13] should live in a continual
[29:16] preparedness now if the person know the
[29:18] thief is coming they'll wait by the door
[29:20] they will call the police they will have
[29:21] the police in front their house They
[29:23] Know Thee is coming te don't come when
[29:25] you expecting them they for opportune
[29:29] moments so when Jesus made this
[29:31] reference behold I come as a thief it
[29:34] means that he comes at an awe when
[29:37] people don't
[29:38] expect that means that we have to be
[29:41] ready so this being made ready is a
[29:45] state of spiritual
[29:48] Readiness amen it's a space of spiritual
[29:52] preparedness where we are prepared
[29:54] spiritually where we are being made
[29:56] ready ready F to fulfill
[29:58] God purpose for your life so before any
[30:01] tremendous thing happen preparation must
[30:04] be made I want you remember that tonight
[30:07] before anything great happened before
[30:10] anything powerful happened preparation
[30:13] must be made if you look back in uh
[30:16] Christian history even the ausa street
[30:19] and the Pentecostal and so like that
[30:21] great preparation was made and what God
[30:24] did Luther brought Faith where brought
[30:27] the
[30:28] part and then the Pentecostal brought
[30:31] the spirit part that activated the
[30:35] spirit Open Door season that made a
[30:39] platform for William Mari and brown to
[30:41] step on to present this message this
[30:44] entire message now just like John the
[30:46] Baptist he was sent to forun Jesus
[30:49] coming just as John the Baptist was sent
[30:53] to make a way for messiah messiah
[30:56] doesn't come without a way me Messiah
[30:58] doesn't come without a place being
[31:00] prepared so for the Capstone for the
[31:03] Dynamics for the spirit itself for
[31:06] charity itself for the person of the
[31:07] Holy Ghost there must be a way made
[31:10] there must be a preparation so before
[31:14] any tremendous thing happen preparation
[31:17] must be made we not going to just jump
[31:19] in and jump out John the Baptist was
[31:21] sent to prepare the way his message was
[31:24] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[31:28] part straet what was John's message
[31:30] calling for repentance and alignment
[31:33] with God's will that was John's message
[31:35] repentance repent the same thing apply
[31:38] to us now God calling us to repent God
[31:41] calling us to get it right God to shoot
[31:44] at the Target because he wants a heart
[31:47] ready for his coming look how God spoke
[31:50] to Joshua to get the people ready Joshua
[31:53] 3:5 it says and Joshua said unto people
[31:57] than ify yourselves for tomorrow the
[32:01] Lord will do wonders among you it was a
[32:05] process of getting ready to inherit the
[32:08] promised land Joshua had was to instruct
[32:12] the people do not come on your wives and
[32:15] so on get yourself cleaned up wash your
[32:18] clothes it was a
[32:20] mindset set that points to God's
[32:24] holiness reverence and respect and this
[32:27] is where comeing to service coming to
[32:29] church we have to be
[32:31] aware and when you think about it you're
[32:33] not coming by the mayor or the prime
[32:35] minister or president you're coming to
[32:38] meet God so you want the reverence you
[32:42] want the respect you want an attitude
[32:45] not to impress another brother or
[32:47] another sister or the pastor or Elders
[32:49] or ministers but you have a
[32:51] Consciousness that the lord of the earth
[32:54] is looking down the lord of the Earth is
[32:58] sifting the hearts of men right now and
[33:02] with that Consciousness it gives you a
[33:05] certain mindset a mindset that God is he
[33:08] is present and there's an eye watching
[33:12] you do you love him tonight praise the
[33:14] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord oh
[33:17] let's continue here now see what's
[33:20] happening okay
[33:23] so so God told Joshua tell the people
[33:27] let the people know that they're not
[33:30] going to come from Egypt they're not
[33:32] going to live a natural caral life and
[33:35] just cross Jordan andh the promise you
[33:38] know like you know just flat and
[33:41] ordinary no let them know and be aware
[33:45] that they have to sanctify themselves
[33:48] now if God say sanctify
[33:51] yourself what are you to
[33:54] do I want to think about that tonight
[33:57] if God says that means to get yourself
[34:01] apart and as side sanctify yourself you
[34:05] have to look to see what is around you
[34:08] what is in your heart and on a personal
[34:10] note Psalms 51:10 David Cried Out create
[34:13] in me a clean heart oh God and renew a
[34:17] right Spirit within me so this is David
[34:21] this is David under repentance this is
[34:23] David under blows because of his sins
[34:27] because of his behavior and he's crying
[34:29] to God Crea me a clean heart this is a
[34:32] son now this is not a a nons son this is
[34:34] a son his name on his book this is a man
[34:36] after God's Own Heart and he's asking
[34:38] God creating me a clean heart and you
[34:42] know Paul said I Die
[34:45] daily we are under attack daily the
[34:47] devil is not working on us monthly
[34:49] yearly half yearly it's daily we are
[34:52] battling devils and fighting daily and
[34:55] we have to consecrate daily we have to
[34:57] commit
[34:58] daily we have to surrender daily create
[35:01] in me a clean heart and renew a right
[35:05] Spirit within
[35:06] me along in the scriptures God releases
[35:11] keys keys that are empowering keys that
[35:16] are there might look simple but they
[35:18] still Keys what did God tell Joshua to
[35:21] his
[35:23] success Joshua 18 this book of the law
[35:26] shall not depart out of thy mouth that
[35:30] means talk that speak that what that
[35:35] don't talk your fears don't talk your
[35:37] doubts don't glorify your depression and
[35:40] your frustration and you know my
[35:42] pressure and my this and my that no
[35:46] talk the word you can't speak what you
[35:49] don't know you can't express what you
[35:51] never soak
[35:53] in this book of the law the Bible the
[35:57] word message the scriptures shall not
[36:00] depart out of thy mouth what the Bible
[36:03] said the word is NY is even thy mouth it
[36:06] has to be in your heart for the
[36:08] abundance of the heart the mou speaks so
[36:10] if this word is in your heart what is it
[36:12] secret the word is in the bright if this
[36:14] word is in your heart it will come out
[36:15] your mouth we wouldn't hear crap coming
[36:18] out your mouth foolishness come out of
[36:19] your doish come your uh how they say
[36:22] unruly and all kind of crazy stuff
[36:25] coming out that mouth
[36:28] this book of the Lord shall not of thy
[36:29] mouth but thou shall meditate there day
[36:32] and night meditate yeah but Isa said
[36:35] over and over is not to
[36:37] read meditate and sometimes like tonight
[36:42] we're so strange I got it thought about
[36:45] the action of
[36:47] preparation and I'm just thinking about
[36:49] it I'm just thinking about it and I'm
[36:53] begin to see how God planned out Genesis
[36:57] I begin to see how he T of man and where
[37:01] to place man I begin to think about how
[37:05] the waters came forth and they have to
[37:08] have waters before you put fish before
[37:09] you get fish the waters have to be there
[37:11] it can't be a
[37:12] oops I made fish and look oh gosh I
[37:15] forget to create the water no water is
[37:18] fish fish is after the air is first the
[37:22] birds come after the Bible specify FS
[37:24] that fly PS of the air so so God thinks
[37:29] ahead God
[37:31] prizes okay this book of the law shall
[37:34] not depart out of thy mouth but thou
[37:36] shall meditate during day and night that
[37:39] thou May observe to do according to all
[37:44] that is written therein he's not talking
[37:46] about you doing your own thing he's
[37:48] talking about if you meditate you take a
[37:50] whole a grasp of what the scriptures
[37:53] declare then you could get a a real
[37:56] burden a word and you could accomplish
[38:00] and do what God say in the book for then
[38:03] Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[38:06] then thou shall have good success so God
[38:09] give Joshua this key
[38:12] meditate day and night let's bring it to
[38:15] us now this
[38:18] is this word and if we could get
[38:21] committed to it to study the word on a
[38:24] daily basis to reflect over what is
[38:26] preached or what is presented on a daily
[38:29] basis but you to have some way whether
[38:32] an audio in a car I like to do that I
[38:34] like to download things in audio form
[38:36] that I could listen while I'm driving so
[38:38] while I'm driving I'm hearing things I
[38:40] don't have to see it but I need to hear
[38:42] it so I convert a lot of messages I some
[38:44] convert to audio so while I'm driving
[38:47] I'm hearing and something might strike
[38:49] me and something might see a fresh so
[38:51] your mind is saturated you're not just
[38:53] idle you want this word to s State your
[38:58] being look at 1 Thessalonians 5:6 let us
[39:01] therefore not sleep Readiness I have
[39:04] here by being watchful therefore let us
[39:08] not sleep as do others but let us watch
[39:12] and be sober so therefore preparation is
[39:16] not a
[39:17] destination no it's a continuous process
[39:19] I was sharing with somebody that you
[39:21] know along long life you people
[39:23] complaining complaining and they're
[39:24] looking at happiness and joy as a
[39:26] destination and I said they miss
[39:29] enjoying the process they miss enjoying
[39:32] the journey life is a journey and we
[39:35] have to enjoy and be blessed and be
[39:38] happy a long life Journey you cannot say
[39:41] when you get here when you get dear you
[39:44] have to be grateful to God now you have
[39:46] to be thankful for God now you may not
[39:48] have everything that you want but you
[39:51] are grateful you are thankful you still
[39:54] have health you still have strength you
[39:56] still have activity in your limbs you
[39:57] still have the ability to raise your
[39:59] hands and praise God you still have M
[40:01] that could thank God and bless God yes
[40:03] you have bills you have challenges and
[40:05] so on but that does not cancel who God
[40:08] is and his grace and his Mercy towards
[40:11] you and I because all what we have here
[40:14] is temporary everything that has a
[40:16] beginning has an ending whether it's
[40:17] your house car money whatever it is we
[40:21] all here on a on a temporary basis we
[40:25] all here on a basis of
[40:27] uh
[40:29] alotment God gave a time to born a time
[40:31] to die we here for a space of time we
[40:34] don't own time time runs whether we like
[40:36] it or not whether we curse it or not
[40:38] whether we against it or not or for it
[40:40] doesn't matter time have nothing to do
[40:42] with you time just rules on and I saw in
[40:46] Genesis when God threw up the Earth
[40:48] threw up the moon and and the stars and
[40:50] the Sun and the bless light and greater
[40:52] light it set into motion this thing
[40:54] called day this thing called time this
[40:57] thing called uh hours and Sunset and
[41:00] everything else he set the thing in
[41:01] motion because he want to get man here
[41:04] okay so therefore let us not sleep as do
[41:10] others let us watch and be sober amen
[41:14] praise the
[41:15] Lord so how do
[41:18] we stand how do we supposed to see
[41:21] ourselves as you are you building up
[41:24] yourself are you being strengthened or
[41:26] you just come chur going back home Comm
[41:28] chch and going back home because
[41:31] strength and building is
[41:34] measurable you cannot I what it's saying
[41:37] but you know what you can't measure how
[41:38] you going to judge it how you can't
[41:40] measure it you say you know I have a
[41:42] goal but you don't State what the goal
[41:44] is and the time period of the goal so if
[41:47] you have a goal to let's say buy a car
[41:50] you say you want to buy a car in three
[41:51] years you want to save $500 a month you
[41:53] know what happened after 12 months is
[41:56] 125 66,000 000 after three years is
[41:58] $18,000 whatever it is and you have a
[42:00] goal you have a time period after a year
[42:02] and a half you could see whether or not
[42:04] you were faithful to save that amount of
[42:06] money or not you could see how closer
[42:08] you are to your goal if you say I want
[42:11] to buy a car I want to buy a car want
[42:13] buy a car and you pel $5 here pel $2
[42:16] here you want to buy a bicycle tube you
[42:20] don't want to buy a car you want to buy
[42:21] something other than that you want to
[42:23] buy peanuts you want to buy ice cream
[42:26] right so if you are serious then you
[42:29] have to get the commitment then you have
[42:31] to get the preparation then you have to
[42:34] get the will then you have to get what
[42:36] are you prioritizing in order to get
[42:39] what you see as a as something that is
[42:42] beneficial to you and and in in the
[42:45] spirit realm it's the same we have to
[42:47] get it right and I want to challenge you
[42:50] because these things are measurable if
[42:52] somebody's lifting things in a gym and
[42:54] they only lifting up the easy ways easy
[42:56] ways they have Noone musles to get they
[42:58] not build they just killing time they
[42:59] just wasting time as you lift and
[43:02] stretch and get pain in your hand and
[43:04] everything else you are required to lift
[43:07] heavier weights heavier weights you burn
[43:09] off more fat you gain more muscles and
[43:12] you see big h spunking on and Di well
[43:14] buffed and and punk and shoulders and
[43:17] whatnot you see evidence people say wow
[43:19] you're working out right because they
[43:21] evidence of God you are applying and
[43:23] you're getting the results and this is
[43:26] what Jesus said in Matthew 7
[43:28] 24 4 25 24 24 and 25
[43:33] therefore whosoever Hearth these says of
[43:37] mine and doeth
[43:39] them I would lighten him unto a wise man
[43:43] which built his house upon a rock and
[43:46] the rain
[43:47] descended and the floods came and the
[43:50] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[43:54] it fell not for it was founded
[43:58] upon now I don't have to tell you what
[44:01] happened to the other guy who at take
[44:04] Jesus words when the rains and the
[44:06] floods hit him lost
[44:09] everything so what we draw from that is
[44:15] by connecting to the word in the truest
[44:17] sense where that becomes your Source
[44:20] your source of strength your source of
[44:23] power your source of inspiration your
[44:26] source then you know trials coming
[44:30] testing coming you know these things
[44:34] that are coming listen carefully ought
[44:37] not to take you
[44:39] unawares you cannot act stupid and
[44:42] foolish and ignorant as if you don't
[44:46] know this going to
[44:48] happen you cannot act as if what you
[44:52] have packaged in your mind as to your
[44:55] expectation as to your desire as to what
[44:59] you want supposed to work out as you
[45:01] want God have no spoil children some of
[45:04] us are
[45:06] SPO some of our children are spoed and
[45:09] because they always get what they want
[45:11] they think life is supposed to be like
[45:12] that life dishes out whatever they
[45:15] desire whatever they want and life my
[45:17] friend is not like that the Bible have a
[45:20] scripture talk about that is the race is
[45:22] not for the Swift and different things
[45:24] but time and chance happen to all men
[45:27] is not for the learned it's not because
[45:30] you are skillful and learned and you're
[45:32] educated or you have this and that this
[45:34] going to work out for you it doesn't go
[45:36] like that and Andrew talk share sometime
[45:39] about the signs of favor somebody could
[45:42] be uneducated and favor favors them and
[45:47] when favor favors you nothing could
[45:48] cancel it nothing could change that when
[45:52] God favors you nothing could change that
[45:56] and the Bible said Jesus from favor with
[45:59] God and
[46:00] man favor God's favor when God see David
[46:06] man after my own heart when God see
[46:08] David when Samuel was sing and carrying
[46:12] on God say why you crying for that man
[46:14] S I find a better
[46:16] man God happy God is pleased to find
[46:21] better man do you want to be a better
[46:23] man
[46:24] tonight do you want to be a better woman
[46:26] tonight
[46:27] do you want to be a better Christian
[46:29] tonight who are you what are you what
[46:33] have you become you need message so long
[46:36] you the message and you're hearing the
[46:38] word and everything else but what are
[46:39] you I'm not talking about what people
[46:42] think you are I'm not talking about your
[46:45] reputation what others think about you
[46:47] I'm talking about your character when
[46:49] nobody else is around who are
[46:53] you who are you when nobody is looking
[46:57] who are you when nobody is seeing who
[46:59] are you and you're all
[47:01] alone who are
[47:04] you and this is
[47:06] where I read it but I'm talking about
[47:09] and I was sharing this with brother
[47:11] Clarence I believe some I didn't work oh
[47:13] but a punch I said is unbelief people
[47:18] say they believe but baram said it this
[47:20] way he said when I ask people do you
[47:21] believe God will heal you they say yes
[47:24] but then he said that just at the
[47:25] conscious level
[47:28] but at the subconscious level there are
[47:31] doubts if God will heal let's put out to
[47:35] any matter if God going to deliver is
[47:38] God going to baptize if God going to
[47:40] fill with the Holy Ghost if God going to
[47:41] do whatever anything you think about he
[47:44] said the subconscious have to line up
[47:46] with the conscious to get it
[47:49] right and because we have this intellect
[47:51] this front part but the back part is the
[47:54] real part
[47:58] oh I just love him tonight I like that
[48:00] front part and back part back part was
[48:02] sealed front part was written but the
[48:05] backside was sealed with Seven Seals and
[48:08] God put the Thunders on the back of the
[48:09] bo isn't that something so the back part
[48:14] is the key part the subconscious part
[48:17] most important part that is the real you
[48:20] part if a man thinks in his heart as a
[48:23] man thinks in his heart as a man thinks
[48:26] in his subconscious so is he because
[48:28] that's the real you the real man blessed
[48:32] be the name of the Lord so I trust
[48:33] tonight that you are being edified
[48:35] because I want you to be under great
[48:36] expectation now this
[48:39] scripture the rain the flood came the
[48:43] winds blow beat upon a rock it fell it
[48:47] fell not because it was founded upon a
[48:49] rock so don't ever look at a neighbor or
[48:52] a brother or a sister who going through
[48:55] trials or going through tribulation
[48:57] stuff and you feel that yours is not
[49:00] coming no don't think that 1 Peter 4:12
[49:05] says beloved think it not strange
[49:08] concerning what the fiery trial which is
[49:12] to try you so who you
[49:16] blaming as though some strange thing
[49:19] happened unto you but Rejoice which is a
[49:22] contrary quality amidst this F Tri but
[49:25] rejoice in as much as he are partakers
[49:28] of Christ's suffering that when his
[49:31] glory shall be revealed he shall be glad
[49:34] also with exceeding Joy is that
[49:38] something so this rock this building
[49:42] upon a rock the reason that you have to
[49:44] build on a rock is because what is
[49:48] coming is to test what you build test
[49:51] what we build each individual and St
[49:54] John 16:33
[49:56] spoken these things I have spoken unto
[49:58] you Jesus speaks that ye that in me you
[50:03] might have peace in the world you shall
[50:07] have
[50:08] tribulation but be of good share I have
[50:11] overcome the world this is a real
[50:12] comforting scripture from it you facing
[50:16] stuff that others don't understand don't
[50:18] get and you facing your own tribulation
[50:21] be in health be in family be in
[50:23] financially be whatever we business
[50:25] whatever but here what Jesus said be of
[50:28] good share I have overcome the
[50:31] world I discover an interesting
[50:35] scripture and I wish that I I could have
[50:40] gone deeper into it I'll just read it
[50:42] this is Proverbs
[50:45] 24:27 and it says prepare thy work
[50:48] without and make it fit for thyself in
[50:51] the
[50:52] field and
[50:53] afterwards build thy house
[50:57] this year sets up an order this year
[51:02] sets up what to do before you build your
[51:06] house and I think it's something to look
[51:09] at meditate on and think about prepare
[51:13] thy work
[51:14] without make it fit for thyself in the
[51:17] field and
[51:19] afterwards build house so it doesn't say
[51:23] build your house first and then do this
[51:24] no no no it says say one 2 three oh
[51:29] blessed be the name of the Lord so
[51:33] God because heaven is perfect heaven is
[51:37] not contrary Heaven do have the
[51:40] crazies and the Misfits and so on like
[51:43] that God had to make a way to bring us
[51:48] back to Perfection you had to make a way
[51:51] somehow we know the story he came
[51:53] himself and made that way and this is
[51:55] what the prophet says
[51:57] they started out really with grace to
[51:59] begin with before they had law they had
[52:02] Grace while they were in Egypt they some
[52:05] parents no one was down there was just
[52:07] priests and so forth they didn't have
[52:10] any laws the law had not yet been given
[52:14] Grace provided them a prophet also Grace
[52:17] provided them an atonement the
[52:19] sacrificial lamb we're getting to that
[52:22] this week the sacrifice the blood he
[52:25] says the atonement have be provided
[52:27] before there was any law Grace was
[52:29] before law so there was Joshua
[52:33] representing Grace right along with the
[52:35] law but could not be enforced as long as
[52:38] law was in its proper place so has the
[52:41] church World in this last day it's come
[52:44] along it's played its part but there was
[52:46] coming a time that it must cease it must
[52:49] do it there has got to be an Ephesians
[52:52] to this journey as there was to other
[52:54] Journey whereing the law could have
[52:57] never saved a sinner as I pointed out it
[53:00] could not therefore the promised land
[53:02] represented a day of Grace it could not
[53:04] take them into that Journey now you
[53:07] notice listen in that Journey there are
[53:10] three stages of that Journey first was
[53:12] the preparation by Fai down in Egypt
[53:14] under the sacrificial lamb so before The
[53:17] Exodus the sacrificial lamb was the
[53:21] preparation to get
[53:23] out then they crossed the Red Sea into
[53:26] the Wilderness a separation which
[53:28] represent the another SE of the journey
[53:31] C here we go under the
[53:34] preparation when they all got ready when
[53:37] they come to the Red Sea there was
[53:39] failure again the people did not believe
[53:41] after seeing many things that God has
[53:43] did they did not believe and God opened
[53:45] up the Red Sea took them forth and were
[53:48] taught that all people were baptized
[53:50] into Moses under the cloud and in the
[53:52] sea and we know the story they fail they
[53:56] feel and brother Brandon said and we
[53:59] know the scripture declares that the the
[54:03] authorization to apply the blood was by
[54:05] faith upon the tool inel the door post
[54:08] and something like that that was a fi
[54:12] act you can't sit back and say well I'm
[54:14] a Israelite I'm a Hebrew Glory
[54:17] Hallelujah I nothing apply the blood
[54:20] tonight night you died you died with
[54:24] your Hebrew self you died with your
[54:26] Israelite self you die with your message
[54:29] self I'm saying it good don't miss it
[54:31] now you die I 20 years I listen to that
[54:35] I hear that apply that this Tabernacle
[54:39] and this Tabernacle you could be
[54:40] whatever Tabernacle you could be a tabac
[54:42] you put a a cross on top of your head
[54:45] you die because the instruction world
[54:49] the blood not only the blood but how to
[54:53] apply it and where to apply it so you
[54:56] can't run with a message the blood the
[54:58] blood the blood and man just having pots
[55:00] of Bloods he just throwing up blood the
[55:03] blood Prevail and every house every
[55:05] shelf have blood all every room have
[55:08] blood but none in the door Post in L you
[55:12] the angel wasn't looking inside the
[55:14] bedroom or the kitchen or the drawing
[55:16] room no is when I see the blood I will
[55:19] pass over you your house so this is
[55:22] where the tire hits the road this is
[55:25] where we have to be be accurate in
[55:28] connecting with what God Said
[55:31] specifically if you notice God goes on
[55:33] in specifics he not no general you know
[55:36] as you feel led no very specific take
[55:39] the blood it must be of a certain lamb
[55:43] it must held 14 days take it apply it on
[55:47] the doorpost very specific you can say
[55:51] boy you know I feel that blood look good
[55:54] my window you go wait on your
[55:58] window you see if God wanted window we
[56:01] was going to say window but God wanted
[56:04] that on the door that's the opening
[56:08] that's the entrance that's the covering
[56:11] the door he wanted that blood there so
[56:14] tonight we want to know that we are
[56:18] connected to the intelligence of God or
[56:21] the mind of God as to what he wants done
[56:24] with his word preparation is not a
[56:28] thought preparation is an
[56:31] action are you getting
[56:34] prepared are you getting yourself
[56:36] already or are you just going through
[56:39] life and going through the motion and
[56:41] becoming a nice church
[56:44] member praise the Lord let's
[56:48] continue all right so I forget to pinate
[56:52] this what I have here so I don't even
[56:54] know what page I'm on we just
[56:57] so let's
[56:59] continue the token what he say a Jew
[57:02] could plainly show by a circumcision
[57:05] that he's a Believer there's many man
[57:07] fundamental man can take this Bible and
[57:10] say I'm a Believer and Jesus said by
[57:12] faith are we are we saved and I am
[57:15] believer but that baptism of the Holy
[57:18] Ghost is
[57:20] nonsense I'm reading then the token
[57:23] isn't applied no much how much he it's
[57:27] a just like the circumcision of the Jew
[57:29] he said I'm a Jew why do I have to go
[57:33] out there and act like that other bunch
[57:35] of
[57:37] Fanatics Moses standing up and down the
[57:39] street saying the even message is here
[57:42] it shall come to pass at the end of 14
[57:44] days You Shall Gather the congregation
[57:46] together kill the lamb the whole
[57:48] Congregation of Israel shall kill it
[57:50] putting their hands upon it identifying
[57:52] themselves with it and the blood shall
[57:54] be struck upon the post upon the dle of
[57:57] the door when I see the blood I will
[57:59] pass over you for it's a token that you
[58:02] have accepted the debt of the Lamb that
[58:04] I have provided for you the blood was
[58:07] the token now the spirit is the
[58:12] token you shall be filled with the Holy
[58:14] Ghost not many days hence so there's a
[58:18] prophecy hanging over us tonight there's
[58:21] a prophecy hanging over you tonight you
[58:23] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not
[58:26] many days hence and when the blood was
[58:29] shed the token was sent down on the day
[58:33] of Pentecost like a Russian Mighty win
[58:37] let's back up a bit Jesus
[58:41] came with a three and a half year
[58:43] Ministry to the world Known World at
[58:46] that time and to his
[58:49] disciples he demonstrated God's power
[58:52] and Presence by acts by things that no
[58:56] man has ever done before climax with the
[58:59] raising of the Dead
[59:00] Lazaro after that drama unfold to set it
[59:04] up that he be crucified we know the
[59:07] story he was crucified he rose from the
[59:10] dead and he did not appear in public he
[59:14] didn't appear to the world anymore as
[59:16] far as the world was concerned there's a
[59:19] rumor somebody take the body hide it
[59:21] somewhere else the rumor was just going
[59:24] to remain just like that a rumor
[59:27] two the disciples that he appeared to
[59:30] this was something completely different
[59:32] this was a private Resurrection Ministry
[59:36] to his elect of that day and in this
[59:40] Resurrection Ministry Jesus did three
[59:44] things he opened the
[59:47] word he opened the understanding and he
[59:52] breathed upon
[59:54] them receiving the Holy Ghost
[59:57] I want to repeat
[59:59] that Jesus did three things he didn't
[1:00:03] get them stuck on Mysteries stuck on the
[1:00:06] Old Testament stuck on Revelation
[1:00:10] no what sense does it make if the word
[1:00:13] is open but your understanding don't
[1:00:15] open not open you're clueless so there's
[1:00:18] a open book but you can't read there's
[1:00:21] an open book but you don't understand
[1:00:23] you can't comprehend it so you had to
[1:00:24] unlock the understanding
[1:00:26] open the word which would be the Old
[1:00:29] Testament that
[1:00:31] reveal that with stammering lips that
[1:00:33] there another tongues they shall enter
[1:00:35] into the refreshing he was pointing them
[1:00:38] to Prophecies of what was going to take
[1:00:43] place as I told a brother years ago is
[1:00:46] not to look at Jesus in it's to look at
[1:00:49] the prophecy because somebody could
[1:00:51] claim Jesus stagger Jus act like a drunk
[1:00:53] man and what I staggering I act no drunk
[1:00:56] man I speak no Tong well you are
[1:00:58] finished because the prophecy say he
[1:01:00] will stagger the prophecy said he will
[1:01:02] speak with your Tong the prophecy said
[1:01:04] you're going to act like a drunk man he
[1:01:06] said these people are not drunk as he
[1:01:08] supposed but he said this is that said
[1:01:10] Peter that the prophet Jo speaker so
[1:01:14] clearly the connection we want to
[1:01:16] connect with is the prophet's prophecy
[1:01:19] but a bram's prophecy concerning the end
[1:01:22] time bride how we are to be what we are
[1:01:26] to do how we ought to act how we ought
[1:01:29] to behave and tonight I'm trying to get
[1:01:31] to you there's a great need to prepare
[1:01:34] yourself and I'm not talking from a
[1:01:36] general perspective I'm talking about
[1:01:38] prepare yourself whether it's Zoom
[1:01:39] meeting whether it's prayer meeting
[1:01:41] whether it's service you prep don't just
[1:01:44] drag yourself don't just pull yourself
[1:01:46] prepare yourself I like to do it PR pray
[1:01:50] that you will have a certain expectation
[1:01:51] for service and to see God fulfill your
[1:01:53] expectation when you don't have an
[1:01:55] expectation whever come you take you
[1:01:58] have no testimony because you have no
[1:02:00] expect but if you pray and you are in
[1:02:03] the spirit and you're getting Revelation
[1:02:05] that Revelation supposed to shoot up
[1:02:07] your expectation so when you come you
[1:02:11] come expecting God to do something
[1:02:12] special for you for the church for the
[1:02:16] group for your family for your life you
[1:02:19] are expecting that when you have no
[1:02:21] expectation you come sick you go back
[1:02:23] sick you come dull you go back dull you
[1:02:25] come depressed you go back depressed you
[1:02:26] come frustrated you frustrated because
[1:02:29] you going to church people go to church
[1:02:31] that's a religious Behavior that's not
[1:02:34] spirituality the woman with the blood
[1:02:36] issue didn't come everybody coming oh he
[1:02:38] preaching I want listen he's saying no
[1:02:40] she came because she had a need she came
[1:02:42] because she wanted to touch she came
[1:02:44] because she was desperate she came
[1:02:46] because she had in her heart if I could
[1:02:47] just touch the H of His Garment I know
[1:02:50] my breakthrough I know I'll be healed
[1:02:52] and she was healed she got what she
[1:02:55] expected those guys those nice guy with
[1:02:58] their friend who was kind of crippled
[1:03:00] and they couldn't come in the house to
[1:03:02] the door and they rip up the roof and
[1:03:04] let their friend down that is
[1:03:07] expectation that is preparation they
[1:03:10] wasn't torting that man and then toting
[1:03:11] him back home because next day and you
[1:03:13] know with the crowd and the people boy I
[1:03:16] would think like I come too late I
[1:03:18] should come early they have nothing to
[1:03:20] do with that I how much people they I
[1:03:21] know what Fai they have or they have Fai
[1:03:23] at all so they their attitude was this
[1:03:26] how are we going to take this land we
[1:03:28] can't go from the front door we can't go
[1:03:30] to the back door the window crowded the
[1:03:32] only place we have is on
[1:03:34] top now it hard to tot a man in a in
[1:03:39] that condition up but they did
[1:03:42] it rip off the roof rip off the top and
[1:03:47] lower the man
[1:03:49] down no that is
[1:03:52] fate and with Fai you have to prepared
[1:03:55] to do things that you've never done
[1:03:56] before Oh God help me tonight Hallelujah
[1:03:59] this is where the rubber hits the wheel
[1:04:02] faith is an action and so is preparation
[1:04:05] I want you to get preparation not is a
[1:04:07] thought of preparation discussing
[1:04:09] preparation fellowship and around
[1:04:10] preparation forget that get
[1:04:12] prepared prepared to expand or prepared
[1:04:15] to contract even if you don't prepared
[1:04:18] to expand you you'll
[1:04:20] contract if you don't prepare to succeed
[1:04:22] you will fail what are you preparing for
[1:04:26] what is your
[1:04:27] expectation I could wait till we get
[1:04:29] here
[1:04:32] tonight I was under on a great
[1:04:35] expectation to to share this with you
[1:04:37] tonight that this I was an expectation
[1:04:40] because I believe this is something that
[1:04:42] you supposed to know that you supposed
[1:04:43] to get that you supposed to grasp and
[1:04:45] catch all let's see if you get continue
[1:04:47] here by the grace of God praise the
[1:04:50] Lord all right so but Ram say this here
[1:04:52] now the spirit is a token you shall be
[1:04:56] filled with the Holy Ghost not many days
[1:04:58] H and when the blood was shed the token
[1:05:00] was sent down under de Pentecost Like A
[1:05:02] rushan Mighty Wind that was the team of
[1:05:04] every apostle that was have you received
[1:05:07] the Holy Ghost since you believe repent
[1:05:10] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:05:12] name of Jesus Christ for remission of
[1:05:13] the sins and you shall receive this gift
[1:05:16] of the Holy Ghost it's a token amen your
[1:05:19] pass from Death un life there you are
[1:05:21] Jewish churchs fil it out Gentiles take
[1:05:23] it over and that and that version like
[1:05:26] that now she has come out to get a
[1:05:28] remnant of the Gentile for his name's
[1:05:30] sake the bride you see what I
[1:05:32] mean see what the scripture is speaking
[1:05:35] of here if the token was not displayed
[1:05:38] then the Covenant was not effective see
[1:05:40] it must be because if you say you
[1:05:42] believe and you don't follow the
[1:05:44] instructions of the word then you don't
[1:05:46] believe aha here it is here it is right
[1:05:49] here if you say you believe and you
[1:05:53] don't follow the instruction instuctions
[1:05:56] of the word then you don't believe do
[1:05:59] you be circumcised do you join do you be
[1:06:02] baptized you have done all these like
[1:06:04] that that's still in the token the Holy
[1:06:07] Ghost so if you have your Bibles I like
[1:06:09] you to
[1:06:11] turn is 12 verses we have here of Amos
[1:06:13] chapter 4 scripture we never read but I
[1:06:17] want to read this out to you I want you
[1:06:19] to see how God could be
[1:06:21] sarcastic in addressing things God could
[1:06:24] also mock
[1:06:26] I want you to look at this c as we close
[1:06:30] we're in home right now Amos chapter 4
[1:06:34] reading from verse
[1:06:35] one God
[1:06:37] speaks hear this word ye kind of
[1:06:41] Bashan that are in the mountain of
[1:06:43] Samaria which oppressed the poor which
[1:06:47] crushed the needy which say to their
[1:06:49] masters bring let us
[1:06:52] drink verse two the Lord God had sworn
[1:06:55] by his Holiness that L the day shall
[1:06:58] come upon you that he will take you away
[1:07:01] with hooks and your posterity with fish
[1:07:05] ones and he shall grow out at the
[1:07:07] breaches every cow at that which is
[1:07:10] before her he shall cast him into the
[1:07:13] palace sayeth the Lord come to Bethel
[1:07:15] and
[1:07:16] transgress and gigal multiply
[1:07:20] transgression bring your sacrifices
[1:07:23] every morning so God
[1:07:25] and your ties after three years offer a
[1:07:29] sacrifice of Thanksgiving with
[1:07:31] Le Proclaim and publish the free
[1:07:33] offerings for this liketh you o CH of
[1:07:36] Israel sayth the Lord and I
[1:07:39] also have given you cleanness of teeth
[1:07:43] in all your cities and want of bread in
[1:07:47] all your places yet have you not return
[1:07:50] unto me say the Lord they teeth clean
[1:07:53] but they have no bread to eat verse 7
[1:07:57] behold I have withholden the rain from
[1:08:00] you when there were yet three months to
[1:08:02] harvest and I cause it to rain upon one
[1:08:05] city and caus it not to rain upon
[1:08:08] another city one piece was rained upon
[1:08:11] and the peace where upon it rained not
[1:08:14] withered and two or three cities
[1:08:17] wandered unto one city to drink water
[1:08:20] but they were not satisfied yet have
[1:08:23] they not returned unto me said the Lord
[1:08:25] so you see what God did there he one
[1:08:27] city they Prosper the others come to
[1:08:29] they can't get enough but what he's
[1:08:31] looking for for the people to return to
[1:08:34] him so God sending calamities disasters
[1:08:37] issues challenges for you to get right
[1:08:40] for you to repent for you to come back
[1:08:42] to him verse N I have smitten you with
[1:08:45] blasting and mil you when your Gardens

[1:09:18] God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and ye
[1:09:20] were as fire brand fcked out of the
[1:09:22] burning yet you have not returned unto
[1:09:25] me

[1:10:29] being that you wouldn't hear the message
[1:10:31] and so forth he said prepare and if
[1:10:33] there ever was a time that the world

[1:11:55] rians 4:1 he said come up hither and
[1:11:59] that scripture was a sign of the Rapture
[1:12:01] The Mystery of the Rapture I'm going to
[1:12:03] close with this I'm going to
[1:12:06] close coning the flesh the ways of the
[1:12:09] world the things of the world second
[1:12:11] Timothy 221 says if any man therefore
[1:12:14] Purge himself from these he shall be a
[1:12:17] vessel unto
[1:12:19] honor Sanctified and meet but the
[1:12:23] Masters used and prepared for every good
[1:12:26] word it's not
[1:12:28] automatic gifts and calling are without
[1:12:31] repentance there are so many people rely
[1:12:33] on the gift and they don't understand
[1:12:36] the real way for the gift to come forth
[1:12:40] is backed by
[1:12:42] character backed by the quality of the
[1:12:45] spirit the gift come like the front
[1:12:48] part the character or life is coming at
[1:12:52] the back path so when you see people
[1:12:55] gifted with no life it just does not
[1:12:59] register you see people with gift to
[1:13:01] sing they start in church singing for
[1:13:03] the lord they're singing for the world
[1:13:05] now same gift God doesn't take away the
[1:13:08] gift the gift is there but who are they
[1:13:10] yielding to who are they surrendering to
[1:13:14] friends as I
[1:13:16] close preparation is an action I call it
[1:13:20] tonight the action of preparation get
[1:13:23] into action Church

[1:13:55] heavenly father I thank you Lord for
[1:13:57] your love your presence Simeon might
[1:14:01] have been retired Simeon might be given
[1:14:04] a rock and chair to St on Rock but he
[1:14:06] knew that the Revelation that spoke to
[1:14:09] him you shall not see death till you see
[1:14:11] the Lord's Christ drove him to the
[1:14:13] temple every time every time he got to
[1:14:17] the temple he was under the expectation
[1:14:19] he knew death couldn't touch him until
[1:14:21] this was fulfilled one day as he sat in
[1:14:24] the temple
[1:14:25] the spirit move upon you because Mary
[1:14:28] just passed there were so many women
[1:14:30] there that he couldn't know what who but
[1:14:33] the same God that give him the
[1:14:36] Revelation produced the leading and The
[1:14:38] Guiding to guide him straight to Mary
[1:14:41] with that little swand CL hold him the

[1:15:03] is how Faith Works faith is not static
[1:15:06] faith is not laidback faith is not lazy
[1:15:10] faith is active just as the word is
[1:15:12] active oh God and just as in the
[1:15:15] beginning you created man in spirit
[1:15:20] therefore the spirit was always supposed
[1:15:23] to have dominion over the flesh because
[1:15:26] the spirit is the
[1:15:28] original and Paul said if that same
[1:15:31] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:15:34] dwell in us is going to Quicken our
[1:15:35] mortal body we are coming back to that
[1:15:38] Lord where the spirit will have dominion
[1:15:40] over the flesh Bless the people may this
[1:15:43] little exhortation sharing with them may
