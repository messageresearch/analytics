[28:44] back on that man the bible said
[28:46] he believed god that's the difference

[37:57] earth to prepare people to get the extra
[38:00] oil
[38:01] to get ready to be as the wise virgins
[38:05] do you believe that now there can be no
[38:08] real faith
[38:09] without manifestation because works
[38:13] is faith expressed so when we speak
[38:16] about
[38:16] restoration of the faith it cannot be
[38:19] without
[38:20] manifestation because works is
[38:23] evidence of faith if you have faith you
[38:26] will have a manifestation
[38:28] to express the faith that you see that
[38:31] you have
[38:32] isn't that right and the prophet said
[38:34] there have been no manifestation of god
[38:37] to stir the bride so what he is saying
[38:40] is that
[38:40] fate has to come forward to produce a
[38:43] manifestation of god
[38:44] and that manifestation is what will
[38:47] awake
[38:48] stir excite inside
[38:51] the bride in our words it can't be
[38:54] revelation only teaching only
[38:58] it's got to be power and demonstration
[39:02] of the spirit so when we talk about the
[39:05] restoration of the faith
[39:07] we are speaking about the restoration of
[39:09] power with signs wonders and
[39:12] miracles that is what we are talking
[39:14] about
[39:15] could we give the lord a shout of praise
[39:18] and there have been an
[39:19] absence in this message of that power
[39:22] but joel said i am gonna restore
[39:26] i'm not telling you tonight all the
[39:29] years
[39:30] that it was absent all the years
[39:34] you didn't see it and taste it and
[39:36] experience it
[39:38] i am going to restore and my people
[39:42] shall be satisfied my people
[39:46] they're gonna praise me my people
[39:49] shall not be ashamed
[39:55] oh hallelujah are you with me tonight
[39:58] what is he saying you're redeemed
[40:02] from your sin from your past
[40:05] from your failures from your mistakes
[40:08] you'll be justified always feeling
[40:11] condemned
[40:12] god promised to apply blood
[40:15] upon your life god promised
[40:18] to look at you as if you never did it
[40:22] never did it god promised
[40:25] to justify you not just forgive you
[40:30] come on help me somebody help me
[40:32] somebody
[40:33] i'm getting excited now i'm not talking
[40:36] about forgiveness
[40:38] i am talking about justification
[40:41] as if you never did it
[40:44] you can't sit there and believe that you
[40:47] gotta shout
[40:48] you gotta rejoice
[41:00] my people my people
[41:03] he separated from other people he said
[41:05] my people
[41:06] my very own people the call by my name
[41:11] my people mrs jesus come on
[41:14] oh glory give the lord a shout my people
[41:18] you know who you are when you hear my
[41:21] people
[41:22] you better say hey man you better
[41:25] shout like how john shout
[41:40] i like how goddess talk i call you by
[41:42] name
[41:43] before your mother conceive you before
[41:46] your mother had you
[41:47] i ordain you to be a prophet into the
[41:50] nation
[41:51] before she even knows you're pregnant
[41:53] ordering the seed
[41:55] to come forth nothing will stop
[41:59] the mystery of who you are from
[42:01] unfolding
[42:09] so therefore what about him said there
[42:12] will be no manifestation of god
[42:14] to steal the bride it will take those
[42:17] seven thunders
[42:19] to produce it to produce what
[42:23] to produce a manifestation not
[42:26] revelation only but a manifestation
[42:30] of god to stir the bride
[42:34] because you are not really bright yet
[42:37] until you come into an experience
[42:41] with your mate your husband with charity
[42:44] with the holy ghost
[42:45] is only then you get connected
[42:49] with your husband his wife had made
[42:52] herself ready
[42:53] so god want to contact you god want to
[42:57] touch
[42:57] you god want to connect with you
[43:01] oh hallelujah oh glory do you believe
[43:04] that
[43:05] so you must have an experience with the
[43:08] person of the holy ghost
[43:10] isn't that right the person of christ
[43:13] so the calling out time which we have
[43:16] had
[43:17] for 50 plus years of teaching
[43:20] and revelation is about to change
[43:24] the season is going to change right
[43:27] before your eyes the time of the
[43:30] ministry of the spirit
[43:32] the supernatural and omnipotent speaking
[43:36] even sin being called out it will be
[43:40] changed right in front of your eye
[43:43] power is coming to block out the spirit
[43:46] of
[43:47] man you see when peter james and john
[43:50] saw jesus with that glory around him
[43:53] they said let us make three tabernacles
[43:55] and the power shut them up the power
[43:58] said
[43:58] shut up hear him
[44:02] don't come with the humanistic tort
[44:04] don't try to build no tabernacle
[44:06] to make no man no glory at the end of it
[44:10] christ only christ only
[44:13] jesus only not even fightful
[44:19] not pastor and and prophet no jesus
[44:24] only when they looked there was only
[44:25] jesus no moses no elijah no jesus
[44:29] only have to come back to jesus only
[44:32] got to come back to jesus only
[44:35] hallelujah he's the same yesterday
[44:37] today and forever it's a power
[44:41] i believe that the time has come for the
[44:43] power of god
[44:45] to follow the word the power is going to
[44:48] change you there's got to come a
[44:50] resurrection power
[44:52] among the bride isn't that right
[44:55] and the first thing that power going to
[44:57] lead you to is to the cross
[44:59] where you are crucified with christ or
[45:01] give the lord some praises
[45:03] oh hallelujah hallelujah not
[45:07] not power to show off not power to say i
[45:10] am right you are wrong
[45:12] no power to die oh glory to god
[45:16] because that is where jesus conquered
[45:19] jesus didn't conquer caste no devil
[45:21] he didn't conquer racism healing the
[45:22] sick that was the easy part
[45:25] the path that he conquered is when it
[45:27] looked like nothing happened
[45:29] when he's on the cross when he says
[45:32] finish
[45:33] [Applause]
[45:38] oh hallelujah it didn't look dramatic
[45:42] it was painful but it was there he
[45:44] conquered
[45:46] in suffering and crucifixion
[45:49] in price being paid friends this gospel
[45:52] has to become
[45:53] real if christ suffered so much we
[45:57] if he went through we got to go through
[45:58] also you
[46:00] you just have to bless god to escape the
[46:03] terrible day of the lord
[46:05] but before that terrible they come a day
[46:07] of darkness grooviness
[46:08] a day of blackness a day that you
[46:10] wouldn't even want to think about
[46:12] before that they come he promised to
[46:13] send elijah
[46:15] the prophet and he had a job to do
[46:18] he is going to turn not the head of the
[46:21] people
[46:22] back to the faith of the fathers no not
[46:24] not the head
[46:25] he gonna turn the heart somebody's in
[46:28] heart
[46:29] yes i want heart god wants heart
[46:32] turn your heart that's the real you your
[46:34] heart
[46:35] from the abundance of the heart the
[46:37] mother speak when your heart
[46:39] and back you can only speak where your
[46:41] heart is at
[46:45] oh you have some powerful things to say
[46:47] tonight
[46:49] i said i serve him to you the holy ghost
[46:51] cannot behave in one man
[46:53] and misbehave in another because god
[46:57] behavior is his person
[46:59] so when god says he turn your heart back
[47:01] to the faith that's just what he means
[47:03] your heart not not you had to go to some
[47:05] church your heart
[47:07] you see the devil is fighting watch the
[47:10] rock
[47:10] of revelation to the individual
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:16] so what the devil introduced the people
[47:18] to to church
[47:21] and group so the people end up with
[47:23] group inc
[47:25] [Applause]
[47:27] but once you catch that the father in
[47:30] heaven
[47:32] he alone is the revealer then that frees
[47:35] you
[47:36] from church group
[47:39] think group revelation group
[47:42] interpretation men's ideas
[47:50] then you would realize
[47:53] god will have young sons older sons
[47:57] and different kind of sons no it's his
[47:59] sons
[48:01] in other words a son of god serving god
[48:03] for the last 30 years
[48:05] is same as a son just came in five
[48:06] minutes ago
[48:11] somebody drunk just gave the heart to
[48:14] the lord three minutes ago
[48:15] they are just as much sun as somebody
[48:19] 40 years coming to church
[48:31] you see the problem is your humanistic
[48:33] realm
[48:34] where you see in whom spiritual who more
[48:37] holy
[48:38] whom are righteous but when god brings
[48:40] binoculars he said all have sinned
[48:43] [Applause]
[48:46] and if you are sin you're born in it
[48:52] in other words you're born in it you do
[48:54] it
[48:55] so stop playing righteous we will expose
[48:58] you tonight
[49:00] because there is none righteous
[49:05] no not one
[49:08] shake somebody on and tell them there
[49:10] has been righteous
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:21] oh you're gonna give the lord a shout no
[49:30] watch
[49:30] i was a catholic but my name was in the
[49:33] book
[49:34] i would leave my acolyte
[49:37] there's a little servant catholic
[49:43] but god called me
[49:47] the whole family stayed but god called
[49:49] me
[49:50] and i made a choice to give up my sins
[49:53] and repent and get baptized in jesus
[49:55] [Applause]
[49:56] name
[49:58] next year gonna be 40 years since i made
[50:00] that choice
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:04] and i'm feeling a feeling
[50:07] just as strong as when i first started
[50:11] out
[50:12] don't let the gray hair bother you
[50:15] because it's not bothering me
[50:18] i just so strong my soul on fire
[50:21] i'm on the expectation i am looking to
[50:24] dino
[50:26] are looking to start to live because
[50:29] jesus said
[50:30] i come that you might have life
[50:34] and have it more abundantly i want the
[50:37] abundant life
[50:39] i want god's joy amidst trying
[50:43] [Applause]
[50:52] circumstances so all of you
[50:54] [Applause]
[50:56] who want to express your dose of
[50:57] tiredness
[50:59] because you're waiting long cut it out
[51:02] because he come now according to first
[51:05] thessalonians 4
[51:07] the lord himself already come down
[51:10] i have news for you shocking news
[51:14] oh shocking news yes you see brother
[51:16] branham says
[51:17] the seven angels come from eternity to
[51:20] gather up the scattered word
[51:22] to tie it back into the word to bring
[51:25] down
[51:26] the holy ghost so they brought down the
[51:29] holy ghost
[51:30] but we wasn't ready yet for the holy
[51:32] ghost
[51:33] in that measure so the holy ghost
[51:37] came down as the word because jesus said
[51:40] the words that i speak they are spirit
[51:45] and they are life so god take his spirit
[51:48] and hide it as the word which is the
[51:51] revelation
[51:53] of the son of man the sower of the seed
[51:58] so we adore us to live under the
[52:00] anointing
[52:01] of the ministry of the world to be
[52:04] seated
[52:04] on because the holy ghost have to fall
[52:09] in such a way upon planted
[52:12] word that it will restore
[52:15] god will be the restoration
[52:19] of the faith
[52:25] watch this how could the fair be
[52:28] restored
[52:29] and we can't do what peter did
[52:33] [Music]
[52:35] peter didn't have seven seals seven
[52:38] church ages
[52:40] all the mysteries but he had defeat
[52:45] you see the faith is christ
[52:49] the holy ghost in you
[52:53] the person
[52:57] not just the baptism but the added life
[53:05] so that is why peter could say silver
[53:07] and gold have lying on
[53:09] i have something and i could release it
[53:12] i have it i could give it he actually
[53:16] had
[53:17] the germ of god
[53:19] [Applause]
[53:22] resident in him and because the germ
[53:26] was in him he could speak for other sons
[53:30] [Applause]
[53:32] and bring them into manifestation
[53:36] what adam was supposed to do
[53:42] adam was to bring
[53:45] representatives like him
[53:48] but when man fell it went into the sex
[53:50] way instead of spoken word
[53:52] which was word and spirit so when jesus
[53:55] came
[53:56] his first message was you must be born
[53:58] again of
[53:59] word and spirit amen
[54:02] so it had to bring back word in order
[54:05] for you to get back to spirit
[54:08] but the word was lost so causing a
[54:11] prophet
[54:12] to restore the word
[54:15] that was lost so we could come back
[54:19] to word and spirit
[54:29] so before the appointed time comes he
[54:32] had was to have the call in all time
[54:34] which you're in right now so even though
[54:37] people want to cut people off and top
[54:38] people off
[54:39] god's still calling whosoever will come
[54:41] come quickly
[54:42] spirit in the right say come come come
[54:44] take the word come
[54:45] hold the ticket come on
[54:49] the ticket is the token the ticket is
[54:52] the word
[54:53] when you buy a bus ticket the doc the
[54:55] conductor don't want to see your money
[54:58] he want to see the ticket if you don't
[55:00] have a ticket he said go on by
[55:05] go and get some oil and then come back
[55:07] [Applause]
[55:09] the bus is ready to go everybody's in
[55:12] line have a ticket
[55:13] you have your money you can have a
[55:14] million dollars he is authorized only to
[55:17] take the ticket
[55:19] you said conduct a whole hundred dollar
[55:20] bill he said no ticket
[55:23] where do you get it you have to go to
[55:24] the county and buy it and why they went
[55:26] to buy the bus takeoff
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:31] don't be caught like that you want your
[55:34] ticket
[55:35] your ticket is evidence you pay a price
[55:37] [Music]
[55:39] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you
[55:43] so when you see a man with the power of
[55:47] god
[55:48] you know that man paid a price
[55:52] [Applause]
[55:57] are you with me amen
[56:00] remember christ in the true church is a
[56:04] continuation of the book of acts
[56:06] the book of revelation shows how the
[56:08] antichrist spirit
[56:09] would come into the church and
[56:12] defile it that's prophecy
[56:16] what preacher are you going to be giving
[56:17] me the church yes that's where satan
[56:20] visit him
[56:21] he's not visiting the paniade and the
[56:23] al-qaeda tends no
[56:25] he fills in the church to defile it why
[56:28] because he understand that if we get
[56:31] things in order
[56:32] the power of god going to be here to
[56:34] destroy
[56:35] his works his imps and his demons
[56:39] so he want to affect and inflict
[56:43] and mess up the church to affect the
[56:45] power
[56:46] from flowing freely in other words
[56:48] nobody's supposed to walk in here sick
[56:51] and stay sick i want to declare that
[56:54] tonight
[56:55] i want to say a certain way tonight
[56:58] nobody should walk in this building sick
[57:01] and walk back out sick
[57:05] tonight we rejected that
[57:12] we are saying these signs
[57:16] shall follow damn god
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:24] believe
[57:27] you really expecting miracles tonight
[57:29] yes
[57:31] you expecting the supernatural tonight
[57:33] yes you're expecting the holy ghost fire
[57:36] to fall tonight
[57:38] yes
[57:42] why why because joel said
[57:45] it shall come to pass afterwards that i
[57:49] without asking the bishop permission i
[57:52] without consulting the minister's
[57:54] association
[57:56] i will pour out my
[58:00] spirit come on now come on now
[58:05] come on now
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:20] let me challenge your face a little bit
[58:22] when saul was messing up
[58:24] saul was king so it started off nice
[58:27] he's anointed
[58:28] he's inspired prophesying he's speaking
[58:30] as king and so he started to screw up
[58:32] and mess up
[58:33] god said enough of that go and anoint
[58:36] one of jesse's sounds king over israel
[58:41] that son called david he didn't ask for
[58:43] anointing
[58:44] he wasn't praying lord anoint me king
[58:47] lord i feel kingish lord could you make
[58:51] me a king
[58:53] david was only seen about sheep when god
[58:56] said anoint him
[58:57] that's god's business that's god's
[59:00] choice
[59:01] that i'm not if james was smoking tampi
[59:03] that i'm going to do with it
[59:05] [Music]
[59:07] do you understand what we're talking
[59:09] about god said anoint that man
[59:12] king
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:15] whether he is ready or not that i'm
[59:17] gonna do with it whether he's small
[59:19] then i'm gonna live with it whether he
[59:21] is short that hasn't been with it
[59:23] whether he is young that i'm not new
[59:24] with it it's the desire of god
[59:33] so when god is about to release your
[59:36] family
[59:39] you didn't hear me tonight when god
[59:43] is about to release you from the bondage
[59:46] of your sickness

[1:00:17] hannah baron
[1:00:19] hannah baron woman mocking her
[1:00:23] making mockery of her because she can't
[1:00:25] produce a child
[1:00:26] and she's in the temple grumbling
[1:00:28] groaning
[1:00:30] travailing she had a choice to be
[1:00:32] hateful
[1:00:33] she had a choice to be angry she had a
[1:00:35] choice to give them back good
[1:00:37] and make a good argument but she choose
[1:00:40] to bring a problem to god she chose
[1:00:44] to weep before god and god
[1:00:48] saw the groaning god saw the travailing
[1:00:52] and god said i'm not gonna just bless
[1:00:53] you i'm gonna bless you with a prophet
[1:00:57] i'm going to bless you with the man of
[1:00:59] god
[1:01:03] i've heard the groanings and the cries
[1:01:07] of my people you see god have to move up
[1:01:09] on your heart
[1:01:11] to break you out this shoe when you
[1:01:12] stick around the devil makes sure

[1:02:11] that is why our sinners impress god and
[1:02:14] they set righteous he does embarrass
[1:02:15] them
[1:02:16] and humiliate them at one time jesus

[1:03:26] neither here nor dear
[1:03:27] or you're going to poke a poke
[1:03:32] a man building a house and one nail

[1:03:36] what what are you really building
[1:03:37] there's a bit of chair for you and he
[1:03:39] pointed wiki wiki
[1:03:41] forget and find him you want somebody
[1:03:44] with
[1:03:45] with zeal with passion with
[1:03:48] with fire that's the only way we could
[1:03:51] get things done
[1:03:52] you see fire have a certain point where
[1:03:54] there's breakout
[1:03:56] it has something called combustion to
[1:03:58] start the fire
[1:03:59] and i learned that if i have an ignition
[1:04:01] point a point is when they're gonna
[1:04:03] break out
[1:04:04] so when i see you smoke it's a fire yet
[1:04:06] it's only smoke
[1:04:07] you can smoke all the time you're smoky
[1:04:10] you're smoky
[1:04:11] we don't want smokey we need a wind to
[1:04:14] bring a breeze
[1:04:16] to blow to get you on fire
[1:04:20] we need you to be in oil one part in
[1:04:23] oil and the other part on fire
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:34] get that people out of your business
[1:04:36] hallelujah you're going one two one two
[1:04:38] one two and somebody going one two
[1:04:40] one two one two it can't be like that
[1:04:44] holy god one man on fire that's why you
[1:04:46] can't handle lukewarm is either hot
[1:04:48] or you're cold why god say that because
[1:04:50] if you're tall you're dead
[1:04:53] if you look if you're on fire you're on
[1:04:54] fire but lukewarm you need to call not
[1:04:56] dead
[1:04:57] that's a kind of sickening thing make
[1:04:59] yourself upset
[1:05:00] lukewarm god don't want to lukewarm
[1:05:02] praise it's better to praise god at all
[1:05:04] then we know you're dead then we can
[1:05:06] pray to raise the dead becoming the dead
[1:05:08] rays of the dead don't steer dead
[1:05:10] the dead have to move that the dead have
[1:05:12] to move
[1:05:13] the dead have to move you you can't be
[1:05:16] dead
[1:05:21] if you're not moving we know you're dead
[1:05:23] that's fine
[1:05:25] it have reason of the day too but when
[1:05:28] the dead raised you can't just stay like
[1:05:29] that
[1:05:30] no that creation of the dead get off
[1:05:33] your grave clothes
[1:05:34] you know be tied up with grave clothes
[1:05:36] get off your grave clothes
[1:05:38] all the old ways of the past
[1:05:43] when lazarus come forth lose him lose
[1:05:46] him lose him
[1:05:47] lose him and let him go loosen lose him
[1:05:50] i want the devil look at you and say
[1:05:52] pack up shot well empty mine says leave
[1:05:53] that woman alone
[1:05:55] lose him lose her loose you loose
[1:05:58] loose woman go out loose loose
[1:06:01] loose three three free free to praise
[1:06:04] god
[1:06:05] free to worship free to claim your
[1:06:08] healing
[1:06:09] free to be inspired lose them
[1:06:20] hallelujah you see the thing about it is
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:24] as humans we feel sorry assuming we want
[1:06:27] to extend ourselves and care
[1:06:29] in a certain way but god doesn't operate
[1:06:32] as a human does his eyes
[1:06:36] see it different and we have to go with
[1:06:38] the eyes of god
[1:06:40] that's why jesus always looking for the
[1:06:41] seeds looking for the sun
[1:06:44] look at his sons of zebedee with a
[1:06:45] fishing net and a business and he watch
[1:06:47] him always follow me
[1:06:49] how you will interpret that business
[1:06:51] knows at a boom
[1:06:53] you need your boys and this man
[1:06:56] with beard come and say follow me and
[1:06:59] the bible said they dropped their nets
[1:07:03] to follow a nomad
[1:07:06] a man who had no place no hotel
[1:07:10] no business
[1:07:14] no salary check the right door for them
[1:07:16] he said follow me
[1:07:18] and i will make you
[1:07:21] features of men and that's what the
[1:07:24] gospel is about
[1:07:26] fishing for men to understand
[1:07:30] that they are going to be sons
[1:07:35] so an ignorant man fisherman can't write
[1:07:39] his name can't read called by god
[1:07:42] to follow jesus jesus only mankind
[1:07:46] but jesus dropping promises upon him
[1:07:49] same works i do shall you do also
[1:07:52] if ye shall say to this monkey move on
[1:07:54] don't doubt you could have what you say
[1:07:56] jesus dropping promises by spoken word
[1:08:02] into their spirits into their soul
[1:08:06] and one time he released anointing upon
[1:08:07] them he said behold i give you power
[1:08:10] and my god is that a castle devil they
[1:08:12] come back rejoice and say lord
[1:08:14] that will have rejoiced rejoice our
[1:08:17] devils are
[1:08:18] subjecting ourselves to us he said don't
[1:08:20] rejoice for that
[1:08:21] rejoice because your names is written
[1:08:24] because he knew
[1:08:24] they don't have character yet he knew
[1:08:27] it's a taste of power
[1:08:29] to show them what is possible
[1:08:33] i want you to say a big evening on that
[1:08:35] because many preachers have a taste of
[1:08:37] power
[1:08:38] that god only show what is possible but
[1:08:40] he must
[1:08:41] have character and character is not a
[1:08:44] gift
[1:08:44] character is a victory you have to go
[1:08:47] through stuff
[1:08:48] you have to go through something
[1:08:54] so stop looking down i know because you
[1:08:56] failed and you're falling whatever
[1:08:57] forget that
[1:08:58] it's a good thing you fall you know how
[1:09:01] you fall
[1:09:02] and you don't have to fall again because
[1:09:04] god could empower you tonight
[1:09:07] the power of his word and upon that the
[1:09:10] power of his spirit
[1:09:11] don't tell me it can't happen because
[1:09:13] samson didn't have the holy ghost
[1:09:15] but the spirit came upon him i'm not
[1:09:17] hearing you
[1:09:19] and he did something when the spirit
[1:09:21] came upon him
[1:09:22] peter didn't have the holy ghost but he
[1:09:24] walked on water
[1:09:26] i'm not hearing you i'm not here with
[1:09:28] you i'm not hearing you
[1:09:31] even without the holy ghost he was in
[1:09:33] the supernatural
[1:09:35] jesus he said jesus if that is you beat
[1:09:38] me to come
[1:09:39] and jesus said come one word come
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:44] what would make a normal man walk out a
[1:09:47] boat
[1:09:48] to walk like jesus i'm not hearing you
[1:09:52] jesus was walking on the water and jesus
[1:09:54] said if he says that you beat me to come
[1:09:56] just say come i ain't coming if you
[1:09:58] don't say come on
[1:10:00] if you say come are coming because i
[1:10:02] know you are the boss
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:06] that is when they could really trust god
[1:10:08] that's when they could really have faith
[1:10:10] in god
[1:10:10] and peter started to walk as he was
[1:10:12] watching jesus
[1:10:14] of course the devil gave fight because
[1:10:15] they've never seen potential
[1:10:17] and anytime the devastated potentially
[1:10:18] want to kill it so you whip up some
[1:10:20] waves
[1:10:21] and peter took his eyes off of jesus and
[1:10:24] looked on the waves
[1:10:25] and he began to sink in but you know
[1:10:26] what i love about him he say
[1:10:28] try to make backstroke confronts show
[1:10:29] that he's a small man and he wanted how
[1:10:31] he can look
[1:10:32] among the brethren he said lord i'm
[1:10:34] saying
[1:10:37] and i kind of like that no peter could
[1:10:39] swim he's a fisherman
[1:10:40] all fishermen could swim but peter
[1:10:43] wasn't taking no risk
[1:10:45] why take risks and jesus is there
[1:10:53] yeah yeah you could swim but jesus he
[1:10:56] could pull you up
[1:10:57] pull you out oh glory to god so we're
[1:11:01] talking about restoring the faith right
[1:11:03] one time she was in the boat he labored
[1:11:06] he preached
[1:11:07] and brown said rail or preaching
[1:11:09] services like two days hard labor
[1:11:11] jill was so tired he was in deep
[1:11:14] sleep storm rocking never seen
[1:11:18] opportunity sinking
[1:11:20] no you think the devil wouldn't sink you
[1:11:21] if you get a chance
[1:11:24] i'll give you something to shout about
[1:11:25] you know my angels fighting for you
[1:11:34] some of you some of you are stranded to
[1:11:36] say amen on that
[1:11:37] you know we're gonna need spirit round
[1:11:40] the angel out and camp around those that
[1:11:43] [Applause]
[1:11:46] you know what accidents the lord protect
[1:11:47] you from you know
[1:11:49] situations god breaks you from you have
[1:11:52] nothing to do with that
[1:12:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:04] understand this is forces from above and
[1:12:07] faster than below
[1:12:08] and you are in between and the god has
[1:12:12] to fight for you
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:17] when you think it's bad it could have
[1:12:18] been worse
[1:12:22] jesus in the boat he's tired devil
[1:12:25] kicked with a storm
[1:12:26] the boat is rocking after a while the
[1:12:28] disciples recognized they cannot handle
[1:12:30] it on their own
[1:12:31] let's wake jesus wake him he's sleeping
[1:12:34] he's not dead he's only sleeping
[1:12:36] he's only in the silence he's not dead
[1:12:38] he's only sleeping
[1:12:40] there with jesus jesus got up rebuke the
[1:12:43] storm
[1:12:44] and say oh ye of little
[1:12:47] fate what is he saying brother general
[1:12:50] if you had faith you were going to speak
[1:12:53] to that storm
[1:12:54] so you got to know something you got to
[1:12:57] know who god is
[1:12:58] you got to know who you are and you got
[1:13:00] to know who the devil is
[1:13:02] who god is is god is in me right here

[1:13:09] to know who you are
[1:13:10] that you are a son just like me i am the
[1:13:13] first born among many brethren
[1:13:15] so i want you to know that you have the
[1:13:17] potential
[1:13:18] to do what i did so he could tell them
[1:13:22] oh ye
[1:13:22] of little faith and then you've got to
[1:13:24] know who kicking up that storm

[1:13:40] sometime the winds just blow contrary
[1:13:42] but he's the god of the contrary rim he

[1:17:08] what branham said remember seated when
[1:17:10] the church
[1:17:12] know what she is what she stands for
[1:17:15] and then she's that she can do the
[1:17:17] greater works
[1:17:18] how are we moving to that time now where
[1:17:21] we have the confidence
[1:17:23] our sons and our heart don't condemn us
[1:17:28] and we believe that the allah has come
[1:17:30] that god could trust us
[1:17:32] with something more you see it's not a
[1:17:34] matter of the church
[1:17:36] it's a matter of god trusting you to
[1:17:39] give you something more
[1:17:41] because when god see the kind of man you
[1:17:43] are he could call you aside
[1:17:45] and give you something that the world
[1:17:49] will know god is with you that's what
[1:17:52] the prophet said this is the age where
[1:17:54] god calling man aside
[1:17:56] understand this we are out of the church
[1:17:58] ages

[1:18:44] creation

[1:26:09] anointing
[1:26:10] it's going to overflow
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:17] my jesus my

[1:26:54] and the presence of your enemies
[1:26:56] your enemy have to see it god will bring
[1:26:58] them out
[1:26:59] just in time to see it they have to see
[1:27:02] it
[1:27:03] because you are the son of god you are
[1:27:06] the daughter of god
[1:27:07] they have to see it
[1:27:13] give them a chance to laugh you may be
[1:27:16] seated
[1:27:17] give them a chance to laugh at your
[1:27:19] crippled condition
[1:27:20] at your sick condition blind by team i
[1:27:23] see
[1:27:23] you know the story he was begging every
[1:27:26] day
[1:27:27] and that day nobody on the street he
[1:27:28] wonder what what's happening i'm getting
[1:27:30] nobody to support me
[1:27:32] and then somebody said jesus is on the
[1:27:33] next street lord have mercy upon me
[1:27:36] he began to cry out not sick out
[1:27:40] not depress out not sad out
[1:27:43] because jesus is not there near him he
[1:27:46] began to cry out
[1:27:48] hearts cry out watch that crying out was
[1:27:51] a symbolism
[1:27:52] of the faith inside of him because jesus
[1:27:55] couldn't hear his cry
[1:27:57] literally but that faith in his soul hit
[1:28:00] heaven
[1:28:01] and heaven touched jesus and jesus
[1:28:04] couldn't help it
[1:28:05] he has to walk wherever fate is wherever
[1:28:08] faith is
[1:28:10] power is coming and seven thunders
[1:28:13] give fate and fate would lead us to
[1:28:16] power
[1:28:17] and power will take us to the promise
[1:28:20] to manifest the promise and the bible is
[1:28:23] the road map
[1:28:24] of god's power and faith
[1:28:28] must lead
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:32] how many consulting that one
[1:28:34] [Applause]
[1:28:40] say it again over but iran said that the
[1:28:42] road map you may be seated
[1:28:44] is the bible and faith leads you to
[1:28:47] power
[1:28:48] and power lead you to the promise you
[1:28:51] see we're born in sin shape iniquity so
[1:28:53] we're born defeated
[1:28:55] so we have nothing to boast about our
[1:28:57] portion is in the blood
[1:28:59] our boast is in the cross because jesus
[1:29:02] come to die
[1:29:03] to redeem us and the word to redeem is
[1:29:05] to bring us back
[1:29:07] so he didn't come to do a halfway job i
[1:29:09] come to redeem them but
[1:29:10] i can't make no because things hot boy
[1:29:13] things really pressure
[1:29:14] no he released the redemption by
[1:29:17] releasing the book
[1:29:19] it was a book of redemption like if the
[1:29:21] book is sealed you don't know for sure
[1:29:23] you're there
[1:29:24] because your name is sealed up but once
[1:29:26] that book is unsealed
[1:29:28] you have the opportunity to connect
[1:29:30] listen
[1:29:31] to who you really are
[1:29:36] you taught it was a sinner you thought
[1:29:39] you was a baptist a methodist jew
[1:29:40] witness catholic you taught that
[1:29:42] but when the book opened
[1:29:46] then you recognize that you are son and
[1:29:48] daughter of god
[1:29:50] not of your mother and father
[1:29:57] your mother only father only gave you
[1:29:58] physical characteristics
[1:30:00] but you are the physical
[1:30:03] manifestation of the attribute that you
[1:30:06] are in god
[1:30:08] so god put a german you in the dust
[1:30:12] in your dust the devil can't see that
[1:30:16] germ
[1:30:17] because you don't have discernment of
[1:30:20] them of god
[1:30:26] i understand the bible said the word
[1:30:28] alone is the designer of the thoughts
[1:30:33] are the intents of the heart so the
[1:30:35] heart is
[1:30:36] uh no trespasses please for the devil
[1:30:40] and no trespass sign over your heart so
[1:30:43] the devil can come and trespass
[1:30:45] what god have as a hidden mystery inside
[1:30:48] of you
[1:30:49] which is the germ now because it's
[1:30:51] inside of you
[1:30:52] jesus could plainly say all that the
[1:30:56] father
[1:30:57] had given me will come
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:05] jesus is not in pain tonight oh god
[1:31:08] you surely will come no no no he is not
[1:31:10] in that
[1:31:11] all the father not no given me
[1:31:16] a heart given me past tense
[1:31:19] do not know see
[1:31:20] [Applause]
[1:31:25] you're getting a revelation of the blood
[1:31:29] that brought you but god put your
[1:31:32] germ in the book and when we preach the
[1:31:36] word
[1:31:37] we are preaching your name
[1:31:45] that is why you could shout at the world
[1:31:48] that is why you can get excited because
[1:31:51] when you hear the word
[1:31:52] yes you have your struggle in your flesh
[1:31:54] yes you have battles in your mind
[1:31:56] you're supposed to have the battle
[1:32:00] if you have no back for something wrong
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:05] so god allow the loose and spirit spirit
[1:32:09] to guide up the loose ends the spirit
[1:32:12] people that loose in their life you see
[1:32:13] because the foolish virgins
[1:32:14] are really free tinkers
[1:32:19] you know some people don't like
[1:32:20] discipline right don't like correction
[1:32:21] they want to do their own thing
[1:32:22] if they talk to them and correct them
[1:32:24] they get vex they don't like you say you
[1:32:25] like how you say it
[1:32:26] you like what you say they don't like
[1:32:28] this freethinkers
[1:32:30] but god have a pattern a same stress
[1:32:33] work with a pattern
[1:32:35] i simply can't just watch you and say
[1:32:36] okay you're looking like size 18.
[1:32:38] give me the clothes give my scissors
[1:32:42] let me go
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:45] you know don't go back there that is
[1:32:47] trouble
[1:32:49] somebody said okay just give me the
[1:32:50] clothes okay
[1:32:54] no measurement no pattern no nothing
[1:32:56] that's dangerous
[1:32:57] she could give you a sack and you're the
[1:32:58] entire rope wrong so
[1:33:00] so so you just don't do that well god
[1:33:03] have a pattern
[1:33:05] there it is
[1:33:12] so when god scissors come out god can
[1:33:14] say oh ho
[1:33:15] you don't like it so how do you like it
[1:33:21] god himself can't do that because i will
[1:33:24] make him not god
[1:33:26] he said i am god and i change not my
[1:33:28] pattern change
[1:33:29] not his faith first virtue
[1:33:33] second knowledge gain temperance
[1:33:37] gain patience then you know coming to
[1:33:40] godliness
[1:33:41] then you have to have forgiveness
[1:33:43] because faith is based on
[1:33:50] [Applause]
[1:33:59] no watch the devil know fate is based
[1:34:02] upon forgiveness because that's what
[1:34:04] being preached
[1:34:05] so his job is to make sure it have some
[1:34:09] solid odds and some concrete
[1:34:12] grudge long standing
[1:34:16] for years family feud for years
[1:34:20] and the devil tell them go to church but
[1:34:23] do not forgive at
[1:34:24] all same and say amen hallelujah
[1:34:29] say glory glory glory raise your hand
[1:34:31] raise your weight
[1:34:32] wait wait wait but when you go home
[1:34:35] don't
[1:34:35] forgive me
[1:34:39] because if you only forgive me god will
[1:34:42] come down
[1:34:47] i can't afford that
[1:34:48] [Applause]
[1:34:52] so you have church wars this past
[1:34:55] against that pastor
[1:34:56] disbeliever against a believer husband
[1:34:58] fighting with wife
[1:35:00] why fighting with children dog fighting
[1:35:02] with cat
[1:35:04] everybody fighting
[1:35:08] no forgiveness because once
[1:35:12] forgiveness start to be effective
[1:35:16] you put yourself in a position to be
[1:35:19] like god
[1:35:21] because he smiles on the just
[1:35:24] and on the unjust and the rain just
[1:35:27] falls
[1:35:29] on the tomato tree and the marijuana
[1:35:40] tree
[1:35:43] righteous today i am
[1:35:46] falling on no marijuana no ganja crop
[1:35:49] only corn tomatoes and melon
[1:35:52] and watermelon what the farmers like
[1:35:56] i could move that way the rain don't
[1:35:58] talk that way
[1:35:59] the ruins just fall and every seed
[1:36:03] brings forth after its kind and if
[1:36:07] there is a son of god's seed sown
[1:36:10] in your heart and that rainfall
[1:36:13] it's got to bring forth after it's came
[1:36:17] a god king a godly king a kind of holy
[1:36:21] king
[1:36:22] a righteous kind every seed bring forth
[1:36:30] so let the devil do his do we got to do
[1:36:33] our do
[1:36:34] oh hallelujah i'm telling you maybe see
[1:36:37] that
[1:36:37] let me drop this on you it will come to
[1:36:39] a spot you can't help it

[1:36:47] have walk by the spirit
