[1:12:04] another year and for allowing us to be
[1:12:08] in the house of the Lord to meet a new
[1:12:10] year so I have two portions of scripture
[1:12:14] we'll read one of
[1:12:15] them uh then we'll pray take our seats
[1:12:18] and we'll read the other reading a very
[1:12:21] familiar portion of scripture Hebrew
[1:12:26] 13 and verse
[1:12:29] 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:12:34] today and forever may the Lord add a
[1:12:37] blessing to the reading of his word can
[1:12:39] we bow our heads for a word of prayer
[1:12:41] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[1:12:43] you for your love for your grace for
[1:12:45] your mercy Lord for taking us through
[1:12:49] 2024 and for allowing us to see another
[1:12:52] day to see this month to see this
[1:12:55] service Lord and to be on the brink of
[1:12:57] 2025 and what you have in store for us
[1:13:00] Lord we could look back over the year
[1:13:02] and we can say it has been you father it
[1:13:05] has not been our strength it has not
[1:13:07] been our ability but we could see you
[1:13:09] have taken us through and we are
[1:13:11] trusting you to take us forward so
[1:13:13] father may you take complete control of
[1:13:16] every situation take complete control of
[1:13:18] Our Lives take complete control of this
[1:13:20] service may you walk out the pages of
[1:13:23] the Bible may you anoint the read
[1:13:25] reading of the word may you bless the
[1:13:26] hearing of it may you speak lip to ear
[1:13:29] to your children may you take me out of
[1:13:30] the way and may you Lord have your
[1:13:33] perfect will in the service tonight in
[1:13:34] the precious name of Jesus Christ and
[1:13:36] the church says amen and amen you may be
[1:13:39] seated certainly a great privilege to
[1:13:42] see one and all and old days night
[1:13:44] service is always a special service you
[1:13:46] know for some people it's way beyond
[1:13:48] their bed time for some people this is
[1:13:50] their time you know there are those who
[1:13:52] are morning people there are those who
[1:13:54] are evening people and uh but it's
[1:13:56] always a great significant point when
[1:13:59] you switch from one year to the next
[1:14:02] many people trying to figure out how
[1:14:03] they're going to enter the new year and
[1:14:05] we thank God that he has given us the
[1:14:07] grace to find ourselves appreciating the
[1:14:09] New Year in the house of God because we
[1:14:12] are dependent upon him for the source of
[1:14:14] our supply we are dependent on him to
[1:14:16] take us through we are dependent on him
[1:14:18] to keep us can the church say amen amen
[1:14:21] so I want to also read from uh the book
[1:14:24] of John 12 a couple verses in there so
[1:14:28] that's why I ask you to take your seat
[1:14:29] but I want to kind of get a context for
[1:14:32] this thought to take us into 2025 John
[1:14:35] 12 and from verse
[1:14:37] one then Jesus 6 days before the
[1:14:40] Passover came to
[1:14:42] Bethany so this is we are we are on the
[1:14:45] horizon or on the border of a transition
[1:14:48] a change in Jesus's Ministry he's facing
[1:14:51] the crucifixion he is facing uh the
[1:14:54] Passover is that that moment there you
[1:14:56] know just before he's crucified in Jesus
[1:14:58] 6 days before the Passover came to
[1:15:00] Bethany where
[1:15:02] Lazarus was which had been dead whom he
[1:15:05] raised from the dead so Jesus is is at a
[1:15:08] place now and is is a special time
[1:15:11] because everybody knows that Lazarus was
[1:15:14] dead but now there's a gathering around
[1:15:16] Jesus and Lazarus who was dead is there
[1:15:20] verse two he's alive there they made him
[1:15:22] a supper and Martha served but Lazarus
[1:15:25] was one of them that sat at the table
[1:15:27] with him could you imagine the picture
[1:15:29] there's Jesus he's sitting down he's
[1:15:31] about to eat some food and there are
[1:15:33] people peeking in because it's not just
[1:15:35] about Jesus sitting on eating food
[1:15:38] Lazarus who had been dead is also on the
[1:15:40] table could you imagine you come to
[1:15:42] church and you see somebody who is dead
[1:15:44] sitting down at the table
[1:15:46] eating what a what a dinner what a
[1:15:48] service Hallelujah then took Mary a
[1:15:52] point of a pound of ointment of ND
[1:15:55] very costly and anointed the feet of
[1:15:57] Jesus I'm painting a picture and wiped
[1:15:59] his feet with her hair and the house was
[1:16:01] filled with the order of the ointment so
[1:16:04] it was so strong that a couple of things
[1:16:06] are happening Jesus is sitting down he
[1:16:08] himself is an
[1:16:09] attraction the fact that Jesus is in the
[1:16:11] house is worthy of acknowledgement
[1:16:13] worthy of of greeting worthy of a
[1:16:15] conversation on top of that you have
[1:16:17] Lazarus who everybody know was dead he
[1:16:20] wasn't in service last week because he
[1:16:21] was dead but here he is sitting down in
[1:16:23] the room can the church say amen and now
[1:16:26] Mary takes an expensive
[1:16:29] ointment and fills the whole room you
[1:16:31] can't miss it you can't wonder if
[1:16:33] there's a scent over there no the whole
[1:16:35] room is filled with the scent of this
[1:16:36] ointment that's what I'm reading the
[1:16:38] scripture the house was filled with the
[1:16:40] order of the ointment then sayth one of
[1:16:42] his disciples Judas Iscariot Simon's son
[1:16:45] which should betray him so so he's in
[1:16:47] the room so it's a it's a mixed audience
[1:16:49] in the room maybe there's a mixed
[1:16:51] audience here tonight as we approach
[1:16:54] this change of season because Jesus is
[1:16:56] about to go to a change of season and
[1:16:58] the way God changes Seasons a number of
[1:17:00] things have to happen and line up for
[1:17:02] these changes that take place can the
[1:17:03] church say amen and many times we look
[1:17:06] at situations in our life I heard
[1:17:08] somebody say recently stop saying why
[1:17:10] did this happen to me and I ask a
[1:17:13] question why did it happen for me
[1:17:15] because when God is about to do
[1:17:16] something you got to have the right
[1:17:18] picture of what's about to take place
[1:17:20] and you can look back through 2024 and
[1:17:22] there are many reasons to say why did
[1:17:24] this go wrong and why did this happen to
[1:17:26] me but if you ask a question why did it
[1:17:28] happen for me and you begin to see Jesus
[1:17:32] in every month you begin to see Jesus in
[1:17:35] every week you begin to see Jesus in
[1:17:37] every trial you begin to see Jesus in
[1:17:40] every situation in fact brother brandom
[1:17:42] said if you read the Bible and don't see
[1:17:43] Jesus in every verse you need to go read
[1:17:45] it again oh somebody helped me this
[1:17:48] evening and for a title just so you know
[1:17:51] where I'm going we need to see Jesus
[1:17:53] that's the title we need need to see
[1:17:55] Jesus I'm one preacher who's tired of
[1:17:58] church I want to see Jesus it's good to
[1:18:01] see ministers but I want to see Jesus
[1:18:03] it's good to see ERS but I want to see
[1:18:06] Jesus it's it's good to see you but I
[1:18:08] want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus in
[1:18:11] you I want to see Jesus on you I want to
[1:18:13] see him around you I want to walk into
[1:18:15] your house and know that he's living
[1:18:17] there can the church say
[1:18:21] Amen so in verse four then said one of
[1:18:24] his disciples Jud es cariot Simon son
[1:18:26] which should betray him why was not this
[1:18:28] ointment sold for 300 p and given to the
[1:18:32] poor this he said not that he cared for
[1:18:35] the poor right but because he was a
[1:18:38] thief and had the bag and bear what was
[1:18:40] put therein so he has suggestions about
[1:18:44] how to do things but the motive for his
[1:18:46] suggestion is the desire of his
[1:18:48] heart then Jesus said let her alone
[1:18:51] against the day of my burying had she
[1:18:53] kept this in other words there's a
[1:18:55] purpose for this sacrifice God sees the
[1:18:58] sacrifice he honors the sacrifice in
[1:19:00] fact a sacrifice was a sacrifice based
[1:19:02] on Revelation because she somehow knew
[1:19:04] that Messiah had to
[1:19:06] die she couldn't explain it but
[1:19:08] something came over her that drove her
[1:19:10] to do that can the church say amen and
[1:19:13] Jesus said for the poor always ye have
[1:19:15] with you but me he have not
[1:19:17] always much of the Jews therefore knew
[1:19:20] that he was there oh what is it to know
[1:19:23] that Jesus is there can the church say
[1:19:25] amen and they came not for Jesus sake
[1:19:28] only but that they might see Lazarus
[1:19:31] also whom he had raised from the dead
[1:19:33] and I got some news for you some of the
[1:19:35] trials and the situation that you've
[1:19:37] been in through and you have been going
[1:19:38] through God has kept it for a reason
[1:19:41] because even though Jesus was in the
[1:19:43] building and he this was six days before
[1:19:45] the Passover all the records of the
[1:19:48] healing and the blind seeing all of that
[1:19:50] was there but the fact that Lazarus who
[1:19:52] was dead was now alive that was an
[1:19:55] attraction and God is going to bring to
[1:19:57] life some Sons and Daughters who have
[1:19:59] been dead to prove that he's the same
[1:20:01] yesterday he's the same today he's the
[1:20:03] same forever so don't look at your
[1:20:05] situation as if everything is out of
[1:20:07] control no God is in control Lazarus was
[1:20:11] dead for a purpose oh God could have
[1:20:13] intervened if he wanted but Lazarus had
[1:20:15] to be dead so that God could prove
[1:20:17] himself alive he could prove himself a
[1:20:19] deliverer he could prove himself a
[1:20:21] resurrector he could prove himself can
[1:20:23] the Church Say Amen so don't worry about
[1:20:25] your son don't worry about your daughter
[1:20:28] don't worry about your situation don't
[1:20:30] worry about your health don't worry
[1:20:31] about your finances don't worry about
[1:20:33] your family it might look messed up it
[1:20:35] might look dead but there's a testimony
[1:20:38] in there you don't hear me this evening
[1:20:41] there's a testimony in 2024 it's been
[1:20:44] rough it's been tough but there's a
[1:20:45] testimony in there can you see Jesus in
[1:20:50] there Hallelujah Lazarus didn't pick his
[1:20:53] problem he didn't pick his trial he
[1:20:55] didn't pick what he went through but
[1:20:57] here was Lazarus sitting at the table he
[1:21:00] doesn't know even what happened to him
[1:21:02] Hallelujah one minute he was there next
[1:21:05] minute he was dead next minute he's back
[1:21:07] alive I wish I could shake his hand and
[1:21:08] say brother how did it feel he say I
[1:21:10] can't explain all of it but oh I once
[1:21:12] was dead but now I'm alive I once was
[1:21:15] blind but now I could
[1:21:18] see and I believe as we go to 2025 God
[1:21:21] is going to have some individuals who
[1:21:23] have been through some stuff here can't
[1:21:24] explain the doctors cannot explain your
[1:21:27] family cannot explain your neighbors
[1:21:30] can't explain your co-workers cannot
[1:21:32] explain your husband cannot explain your
[1:21:35] wife cannot explain and you could just
[1:21:37] say it was the Lord it was the Lord it
[1:21:39] was the Lord it was the Lord if it had
[1:21:42] not been for the
[1:21:46] Lord can the church say
[1:21:49] Amen oh Hallelujah I love this many of
[1:21:53] the Jews knew he was there there will be
[1:21:55] many people who will know because
[1:21:57] brother brandom said God is looking for
[1:21:58] a church that he could walk in a church
[1:22:01] at sin count stay in there a church
[1:22:03] without spot or wrinkle but there will
[1:22:04] be people who will come because they see
[1:22:06] you oh come on now just like they came
[1:22:10] because they saw Lazarus so if you are
[1:22:12] Lazarus this evening and you came in

[1:22:51] move between now and midnight I heard

[1:23:16] raise you into a new Strength a new
[1:23:18] anointing a new level a new Faith a new
[1:23:22] Zeal you could walk in here one way and

[1:25:29] page leave it on the last page there's a
[1:25:32] few minutes left to close out this page
[1:25:34] to close out this chapter Hallelujah God
[1:25:37] is not going to choose for you you have
[1:25:38] to choose can the church say
[1:25:40] Amen let's finish read the scripture you
[1:25:42] see why I couldn't read it with
[1:25:43] everybody standing
[1:25:46] up verse n much people of the Jews
[1:25:50] therefore knew that he was there and
[1:25:52] they came not for Jesus sake only but
[1:25:55] that the mighty Lazarus also people want
[1:25:58] to shake by the Lazarus
[1:26:00] hand whom he had raised from the dead
[1:26:03] but I want to see the picture imagine
[1:26:04] people are there to Rejoice brother Mike
[1:26:06] they just happy that Lazarus is there
[1:26:08] but verse 10 but the chief priests
[1:26:11] consulted that they might put Lazarus to
[1:26:15] death they want to kill him again they
[1:26:18] don't like the fact that he was dead and
[1:26:19] now alive they don't like the fact that
[1:26:22] that that he had a rough 2024 look like
[1:26:24] they're signs alive oh come on now
[1:26:26] somebody help me so the enemy is there
[1:26:29] trying to consult to put him back to
[1:26:34] death because Listen by reason of him
[1:26:37] many of the Jews went and believed on
[1:26:40] Jesus can the church say Amen there are
[1:26:42] many in here this evening you are here
[1:26:45] because somebody testified of the
[1:26:47] goodness of Jesus you saw somebody's
[1:26:49] life change and say I want to be like
[1:26:51] that Lazarus transformation was such a
[1:26:54] testimony they still we need to kill him
[1:26:56] and you do you understand why the devil
[1:26:59] is out to get you because whenever you
[1:27:01] lift your head up and the devil think
[1:27:04] but why he not D why he not sad why he
[1:27:06] didn't stay home why he didn't live in
[1:27:08] depression but every time the devil push
[1:27:10] you down something in you get back up
[1:27:13] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:27:15] he that's in the
[1:27:17] world you not built to give up giving up
[1:27:21] not part of who you are you might have
[1:27:23] rough moments but giving up is not who
[1:27:25] you are backslide is not no oh come on
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:37] now verse 12 on the next day much people
[1:27:42] that would come to the feast when they
[1:27:44] heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
[1:27:47] took branches of palm trees and went
[1:27:49] forth to meet him and cried hosana
[1:27:52] blessed is the king of Israel that
[1:27:54] cometh in the name of the Lord and Jesus
[1:27:57] when he had found a young ass sat there
[1:27:59] on as it is written fear not Daughter of
[1:28:01] Zion behold I King comeet sitting on an
[1:28:03] ass's cult these things understood not
[1:28:06] his disciples at the
[1:28:08] first so this is happening and the
[1:28:10] disciples don't understand what's
[1:28:13] happening but when Jesus was glorified
[1:28:15] then remembered they that these things
[1:28:18] were written of him that they had done
[1:28:21] these things unto him the people
[1:28:23] therefore that was with him when he
[1:28:25] called Lazarus out of his grave and
[1:28:27] raised him from the dead bear
[1:28:29] record for this cause the people also
[1:28:32] met him for that they heard that he had
[1:28:34] done this miracle the Pharisees
[1:28:37] therefore said among themselves perceive
[1:28:40] ye how you Prevail nothing in other
[1:28:41] words you see how our ministry not doing
[1:28:44] anything behold the world is going after
[1:28:48] him this is where I want to get to and
[1:28:51] there were certain Greeks among them
[1:28:53] that came up to worship at the
[1:28:56] feast they came to do
[1:29:00] what they came to do
[1:29:04] what the same came therefore to Philip
[1:29:07] so these are not Jews now these are
[1:29:08] Gentiles and they came to
[1:29:10] worship and the same came Dev to Philip
[1:29:13] which was of Bethesda of Galilee and
[1:29:14] desire him saying sir we would see Jesus
[1:29:18] so in other words these Greeks who had
[1:29:20] come to worship were not satisfied to
[1:29:23] just come to worship
[1:29:26] ship they wanted to see Jesus hallelujah
[1:29:30] it's it's one thing to come to church to
[1:29:31] worship but it's something different
[1:29:34] when you want to see
[1:29:36] Jesus this is where I got the title it's
[1:29:39] evening we need to see Jesus we have
[1:29:42] come to worship many a service but oh
[1:29:45] God help me tonight I want to see Jesus
[1:29:48] I need to see Jesus because if I just
[1:29:51] get to Jesus then everything is going to
[1:29:53] be all right if I could just Touch the
[1:29:55] Hem of His Garment if he could give a
[1:29:57] word in my situation if he could speak
[1:30:00] into my
[1:30:04] situation Hallelujah philli cometh and
[1:30:06] tell it Andrew and again Andrew and
[1:30:08] Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered
[1:30:10] them saying the hour is come so he is
[1:30:13] responding to the question about seeing
[1:30:15] Jesus he said the hour has come that a
[1:30:17] son of man should be glorified this is
[1:30:19] the first time he is speaking this way
[1:30:23] verily verily I say unto you except a
[1:30:24] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[1:30:26] die it abided alone but if it die it
[1:30:29] bringeth forth much fruit and as we
[1:30:32] close out this year and enter into a new
[1:30:33] year he that loveth his life shall lose
[1:30:36] it and he that hated his life in this
[1:30:39] world shall keep it un life eternal If
[1:30:42] any man serve me and I preach on this a
[1:30:46] while back about serving God what does
[1:30:48] that actually mean you serve god with
[1:30:50] your time your substance your effort
[1:30:52] serving
[1:30:54] you know what someone is serving because
[1:30:56] what you serve is what you
[1:31:00] reflect so Jesus is saying if any man
[1:31:03] serve me let him follow me and where I
[1:31:06] am there all there shall also my servant
[1:31:10] be if any man serve me him will my
[1:31:13] father
[1:31:15] honor are we serving the lord are we
[1:31:18] servants to the Lord is our
[1:31:21] time in service to the Lord Lord is our
[1:31:25] our words in service to the Lord our
[1:31:27] resources in service to the Lord verse
[1:31:30] 27 we wrapping up here now now is my
[1:31:32] soul trouble and what shall I say father
[1:31:34] save me from this hour but for this
[1:31:36] cause came I into this hour father
[1:31:39] glorify thy
[1:31:41] name then came there a voice from Heaven
[1:31:44] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:31:46] glorify it again the people therefore
[1:31:49] that stood by heard it said that it
[1:31:52] hundered others said an angel spoke to
[1:31:55] him so the people who were there were
[1:31:56] hearing Thunders and hearing
[1:31:58] voices Jesus answered and said this
[1:32:01] voice came not because of me but for
[1:32:03] your sakes now is the Judgment of this
[1:32:06] world now shall the prince of this world
[1:32:08] be cast out and I if I be lifted up from
[1:32:10] the earth will draw all men unto me this
[1:32:13] he said signifying what death he shall
[1:32:16] die may the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:32:18] reading of his word can we give the Lord
[1:32:20] a hand of praise
[1:32:24] just a few more minutes to close of this
[1:32:25] year everybody feeling

[1:33:01] we to be today resting upon that
[1:33:03] beautiful revelation of the word of the
[1:33:06] Living God that there is no neither
[1:33:08] things present nor things that can come
[1:33:11] there's no sickness no sorrow no death
[1:33:13] no perils no nothing can separate us
[1:33:16] from the purpose of the Living God what
[1:33:19] God has imagined in his mind what God
[1:33:22] has purposed in his heart to bring to
[1:33:24] pass there is no demon there is no power

[1:36:56] could do it for that sister if and he's
[1:36:58] the same yesterday he's the same today
[1:37:00] he's the same forever this great gospel
[1:37:02] we're preaching about is not for us to
[1:37:04] have church services no it's for us to
[1:37:06] bring Jesus under
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:12] scene listen friends not just it's easy
[1:37:15] to say the Holy Spirit and the presence
[1:37:18] of God but that's not what God's
[1:37:20] objective is it was God above them it
[1:37:23] was God god with them and his whole
[1:37:24] design was to be God in
[1:37:31] them and friends when God is in you you
[1:37:35] live different you talk different you
[1:37:38] laugh different you eat different you
[1:37:41] look at the world different can the
[1:37:42] church say
[1:37:48] Amen so to catch this you have to
[1:37:50] recognize your day and your message
[1:37:53] we are not regular church folk we are
[1:37:55] not here for church we are not in the
[1:37:58] message because we want to be in the
[1:37:59] message this message is not even about
[1:38:00] the prophet you know the prophet's
[1:38:02] message is about Christ can I say that
[1:38:04] one more time brother bram's message is
[1:38:07] to point us to Christ tie up the Loose
[1:38:10] Ends reveal every mystery so you could
[1:38:13] understand what it is like to be in that
[1:38:14] statue of a perfect man so that when the
[1:38:17] you look into the mirror of the word you
[1:38:19] see Jesus looking back at you can the
[1:38:20] church say Amen we're not trying to look

[1:41:53] pastor but they don't know Jesus they
[1:41:56] know conventions but they don't know
[1:41:57] Jesus they know rules and regulations

[1:42:07] him to move freely tonight can the
[1:42:10] Church Say Amen
[1:42:23] hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory
[1:42:27] Glory Glory
[1:42:29] Glory brother brandham said in that day
[1:42:32] they couldn't recognize him they
[1:42:35] couldn't see
[1:42:37] him are you with me why couldn't they
[1:42:40] see
[1:42:44] him even when Lazarus was raised from
[1:42:46] the dead they couldn't see
[1:42:51] him you know the Bible said that God
[1:42:53] blinded
[1:42:54] them because had he not blinded them we
[1:42:57] wouldn't stand a
[1:43:01] chance so you imagine how God feels when
[1:43:04] his own he came unto his own and his own
[1:43:06] receive him
[1:43:08] not because in his mind he is thinking
[1:43:11] about
[1:43:14] somebody and he has to Blind and the
[1:43:16] prophet said they were blind for our
[1:43:17] sake they were made
[1:43:21] blind but the BAM said that's the reason
[1:43:23] he cried for forgiveness forgive them
[1:43:26] for they know not what they're
[1:43:28] doing that they know not what they doing
[1:43:31] was a mystery that the prophet opened up
[1:43:34] that said it was because they were blind
[1:43:35] and they didn't even know that it was
[1:43:37] Grace to the Gentiles that God has
[1:43:39] blinding them so when they rejected him
[1:43:41] they had no idea what they were doing
[1:43:43] because they were blinded because you
[1:43:45] had to be grafted in you had to be found
[1:43:48] Royal seeds of Abraham Royal priests
[1:43:51] Gentile dispens
[1:43:53] a group of people who never had a chance
[1:43:55] to begin with the Bible said in time
[1:43:57] past we never a people but now there are
[1:43:59] a people with Divine access to the power
[1:44:01] of God what a reason to celebrate what a
[1:44:04] reason to
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:10] shout so but random says in the sixfold
[1:44:13] purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel so
[1:44:15] when you see people say I don't believe
[1:44:16] in Divine Healing I can't see
[1:44:19] it I can't see this baptism of the Holy
[1:44:22] Ghost don't be angry with them they are
[1:44:25] blind they say I can see this message of
[1:44:28] him coming friends there will be people
[1:44:29] you will meet you will never see this
[1:44:31] message they think you're crazy they
[1:44:33] think you're following a man you can't
[1:44:35] they can't help themselves they have not
[1:44:37] been given the eyes to see this blessed
[1:44:41] are your eyes blessed are your ears
[1:44:44] Hallelujah and you have heard by the
[1:44:45] hearing of the air for all of these
[1:44:47] years under the ministry of the voice
[1:44:49] but now is the time as job said for my
[1:44:51] eyes to see
[1:44:54] s we would see
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:44:59] Jesus can the church say Amen am in the
[1:45:02] message he identified Christ of all
[1:45:07] ages no one has ever heard of him but
[1:45:10] longed but what longed to see him in
[1:45:12] other words when they hear about Jesus
[1:45:13] something stirs in your heart and if
[1:45:15] something not stirring in your heart you
[1:45:16] need to check your heart real
[1:45:18] fast but say cuz when you hear about it
[1:45:20] he say I'm sure that if I get acent how
[1:45:23] many of you would like to see Jesus

[1:45:30] everybody up in can't
[1:45:34] show me ask you how many would love to

[1:45:43] every hand would go
[1:45:44] up he said there's not a person that
[1:45:46] ever heard of him that they don't want
[1:45:48] to see him there's something about even
[1:45:51] his name but the B said it just enchants

[1:46:35] different we could bring people who

[1:46:39] where you have no other word to say but
[1:46:40] just one word the name of
[1:46:43] Jesus you have no time to pray you have
[1:46:45] no time to no you say Lord

[1:46:55] there's something about even his name it
[1:46:57] just enchants us there's something about
[1:47:00] that trills our heart just to hear that
[1:47:02] name Jesus because in that name we have
[1:47:05] forgiveness of sin I don't know what you
[1:47:07] came in here tonight with whatever sin
[1:47:10] condemnation but the name of Jesus in
[1:47:12] that name there's forgiveness of sin
[1:47:15] what sin you ever came whatever sin you
[1:47:17] ever committed in that name there's
[1:47:20] power over your sin power over your

[1:47:32] God taken his human name to be placed
[1:47:35] upon himself when he was manifested in
[1:47:37] the flesh what a wonderful
[1:47:42] name we need to see Jesus can the church
[1:47:46] say Amen brother brandham said I think
[1:47:49] job is considered one of the oldest
[1:47:50] books of the Bible and job in their
[1:47:52] cried out one time if I could only see
[1:47:54] him if I know where I could go to his
[1:47:57] house oh Hallelujah job say could you
[1:48:00] tell me his address if you could just
[1:48:02] tell me his address I want to go see him
[1:48:04] for myself oh where does Jesus live if I
[1:48:06] could just knock on his door and say
[1:48:08] would you come and see me I want to see
[1:48:10] you can the church say
[1:48:15] Amen brother said we all know that we
[1:48:17] come from somewhere there's something in
[1:48:20] US reaches out for something that we
[1:48:22] know we come from somewhere we cannot be
[1:48:25] just like we are without being something
[1:48:27] behind us to make us in other words but
[1:48:30] saying we are too complicated we are too
[1:48:33] welld designed we are too well
[1:48:36] constructed we there's too much work and
[1:48:38] effort has gone into you being here for
[1:48:40] there for for there to not to exist
[1:48:42] something more powerful than
[1:48:45] us but every said when you look at the
[1:48:47] achievements of man and what man could
[1:48:49] achieve if Man by Design could achieve
[1:48:52] that there has to be something greater
[1:48:54] than man for man to be able to achieve
[1:48:56] what man oh you don't hear me this
[1:48:59] evening I'm getting to the court brother
[1:49:02] Anthony but Anthony is preaching my
[1:49:04] course before I reach
[1:49:06] it he said there's something in us he
[1:49:09] said we cannot be like we are without
[1:49:11] being something behind us to make us my
[1:49:14] watch could not just have happened so BR
[1:49:17] I'm saying the watch on your hand a make
[1:49:20] itself somebody make the watch anyone
[1:49:23] with their right mind would know that
[1:49:25] watch jewels and timing and Regulation
[1:49:27] and springs and hands I'm reading the
[1:49:29] prophet it just could not have happened
[1:49:32] it's impossible for it to
[1:49:34] happen look at the rest of the creation
[1:49:37] how it's set together we know it could
[1:49:40] not have just happened how much greater
[1:49:42] is a man than a watch the man designed
[1:49:45] the watch and timed it and put it
[1:49:47] together so if it's impossible for that
[1:49:49] watch to just happen how much greater is
[1:49:52] it that you and I just happen to be here
[1:49:55] there has got to be a Creator behind us
[1:49:58] if we watch his great creation how it
[1:50:00] moves and how he lives in it lives in
[1:50:05] it we notice the leaf how a leaf hangs
[1:50:08] on a tree and around the middle of
[1:50:10] August without Frost or anything the
[1:50:12] leaf leaves it the life leaves it and it
[1:50:14] goes down into the root the leaf drops
[1:50:16] off and goes right down on top of the
[1:50:18] ground now what's the matter there is
[1:50:20] some intelligence that speaks to it
[1:50:23] too so but said there's an intelligent
[1:50:25] that speaks to the leaf oh you don't
[1:50:28] there's an intelligent that speaks to
[1:50:29] the bird when a storm is coming and if a
[1:50:31] bird could recognize the intelligence
[1:50:33] and if a leaf could recognize the
[1:50:35] intelligence what's up with man can man
[1:50:38] recognize the intelligent oh come on now
[1:50:41] do you hear his voice tonight do you
[1:50:43] hear his intelligence saying come to me
[1:50:45] worship me praise me break out the
[1:50:47] humanistic realm lift up your head for
[1:50:49] Redemption Jo it night Hallelujah
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:59] the tree has no intelligence of his own
[1:51:00] so the life goes down to the root of the
[1:51:02] tree to hide it from the cold weather if
[1:51:05] it stayed up there it would die but
[1:51:06] winter would kill it so what does the
[1:51:08] leaf do it lays in the ground and ruts
[1:51:10] what does the life do while it's in the
[1:51:11] root it sucks back the substance from
[1:51:13] that dead leaf the calcium and whatever
[1:51:15] goes into it and Rises up again in the
[1:51:17] spring and comes right back to his place
[1:51:20] again bringing another Leaf it's a test
[1:51:22] Money death burial and Resurrection
[1:51:25] that's right can the church say Amen the
[1:51:27] sun rises in the morning like a little
[1:51:29] baby born 8 or 9:00 it's in school 10:00
[1:51:34] it's out of school 12:00 it's in the
[1:51:36] middle age and then it starts dying dies
[1:51:38] again and sinks in the west is that all
[1:51:40] of it rises up the next morning to
[1:51:42] testify Life Death burial Resurrection
[1:51:45] everything all God lives in his creation
[1:51:48] he does that and has done it Through the
[1:51:50] Ages can the Church Say Amen
[1:51:54] amen
[1:51:55] woo but the M said now if we're not
[1:51:57] serving him then let's get away from the
[1:51:59] thing we're doing and go serve him
[1:52:01] because after all what good is our
[1:52:03] profession if there's nothing to it and
[1:52:05] our sincerity can the church say Amen
[1:52:08] can we give the Lord a hand of
[1:52:13] Praise
[1:52:16] Glory my my my my
[1:52:22] Glory Glory
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:28] Glory we see things happening when the
[1:52:30] message looked butam said to the world
[1:52:32] it's just as blind to them as it was in
[1:52:33] the days of Noah but to we who look for
[1:52:36] Christ the second time it's an end sign
[1:52:38] that he is soon coming we see something
[1:52:41] fixing to happen and depends on what
[1:52:42] you're looking at now no one knew by the
[1:52:45] word of God that there was coming a
[1:52:46] flood by faith he saw it he knew that
[1:52:48] was going to be because God's word
[1:52:50] promised it now Noah himself by faith
[1:52:53] saw what God's word said but the world
[1:52:55] could not see it because it could not
[1:52:57] scientifically prove that there was
[1:52:58] water up in the sky but no one knew it
[1:53:00] was there because God said so and that's
[1:53:03] the church the bride call out today
[1:53:05] knows that the coming of the Lord is at
[1:53:07] hand regardless of how much we've been
[1:53:09] able to go in progress and so forth and
[1:53:11] succeed in splitting an actum and
[1:53:13] sending a radar message to the Moon that
[1:53:15] means nothing to they believe only a
[1:53:17] sign that the coming of the Lord is at
[1:53:19] hand we see Nations breaking and the
[1:53:21] Nations coming falling apart the world
[1:53:23] coming apart the church move coming
[1:53:25] apart and we are taught that we receive
[1:53:27] a kingdom which cannot be moved can the
[1:53:30] church say
[1:53:32] Amen
[1:53:34] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:53:41] Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory
[1:53:45] Glory so as we getting ready to close
[1:53:47] out this year Church the Bible said that
[1:53:50] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:53:52] this the spirit would raise a standard
[1:53:54] how does he raise a standard by taking
[1:53:55] the same word and making it more
[1:53:58] positive the same message we have had
[1:54:00] all these years by making it more
[1:54:02] positive Hallelujah and the enemy for
[1:54:04] many people that's coming like a flood
[1:54:06] has swept into home swept into lives and
[1:54:09] there's a there's a terrible thing about
[1:54:11] a
[1:54:12] flood because when a flood happens it it
[1:54:15] takes you a long time to recover you
[1:54:17] lose appliances rain falls for a
[1:54:20] prolonged period of time sweep into home
[1:54:22] it destroys livestock property
[1:54:25] Hallelujah you can't even fight a flood
[1:54:27] it's hard to fight a
[1:54:29] flood you could build a house to
[1:54:31] withstand earthquake and stuff but flood
[1:54:33] is different because water finds a way
[1:54:35] to
[1:54:36] move a earthquake could last for a few
[1:54:38] seconds and then it has done the damage
[1:54:40] is done but a flood is different because
[1:54:43] a flood affects the water supply it
[1:54:45] affects food crop it affects agriculture

[1:54:50] perishable items they go to don't go to
[1:54:52] the market the next day after a flood
[1:54:54] because you don't know where these
[1:54:55] vegetables
[1:54:57] were and the say when the enemy comes in
[1:54:59] like a
[1:55:00] flood the spirit has to raise a
[1:55:03] standard a flood could last for months
[1:55:06] you
[1:55:07] know and the impact of a flood can last
[1:55:09] for
[1:55:10] months Hallelujah but when the enemy
[1:55:13] comes in like a flood the spirit of
[1:55:15] raise a standard by taking the same word
[1:55:18] and making it more positive and the
[1:55:21] standard that is being raised in the

[1:59:04] lot of that but I mean manifestations of
[1:59:06] sons of God when God manifests himself

[1:59:11] and what he says is truth what he does
[1:59:13] is truth what he does he manifests
[1:59:15] Christ can the church say Amen oh
[1:59:19] Hallelujah can we give the Lord a shout
[1:59:21] of praise
[1:59:23] the devil thought he had you but you're
[1:59:24] still standing the devil thought you're
[1:59:26] finished but you're still standing
[1:59:28] you're supposed to be back sitting but
[1:59:30] here you are you should have given up a
[1:59:32] long time ago but here you are you're
[1:59:34] supposed to be sad but you're still
[1:59:35] standed and because of that the devil is
[1:59:38] shaken you're supposed to be dead and
[1:59:40] because of that the devil is shaken can
[1:59:42] the church say Amen s we would see Jesus
[1:59:46] Jesus Is Our Hope Jesus is our Banner
[1:59:49] Jesus is our strength Jesus is the
[1:59:51] possibility of a bride's Revival and
[1:59:53] like Samson we see a possibility can the
[1:59:56] church say Amen that we're going to have
[1:59:58] a Revival oh
[2:00:01] Hallelujah when you look what do you see
[2:00:04] we're getting ready to close out in a
[2:00:05] few minutes but brandom said listen in
[2:00:08] once more listen close now at this
[2:00:11] remark brother said he knew that his
[2:00:13] present backslid condition could never
[2:00:15] meet the challenge of the hour yet he
[2:00:18] was just as much man as he ever was in
[2:00:20] his
[2:00:20] muscles do you know when Moses was in
[2:00:25] Egypt he was the same man that was going
[2:00:27] to deliver the children of Israel God
[2:00:29] didn't not to add height to him God have
[2:00:31] to add Samson was the same Samson when
[2:00:34] the spirit was upon him and the spirit
[2:00:35] was it was the same man and the
[2:00:36] different was the spirit you
[2:00:38] know all of Samson's potential was
[2:00:41] always there you know all Joseph
[2:00:43] potential was always there God not put
[2:00:44] any potential now so all of the
[2:00:46] potential of who you are is already
[2:00:48] locked up in there you know God is not
[2:00:50] now choosing you he's not now
[2:00:52] predestinate in you everything that you
[2:00:54] have to be was already in seed form
[2:00:56] inside of
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:58] you that's why but the branam can say
[2:01:00] you are not even the believer but the
[2:01:02] word in you is a Believer there's a seed
[2:01:04] in you that believes more than you
[2:01:05] believe and that seed is what brought
[2:01:07] you here tonight and that seed is
[2:01:09] waiting for the rain to fall because the
[2:01:11] moment the rain falls upon that seed
[2:01:12] that seed has to come to life and
[2:01:14] there's nothing we read at the beginning
[2:01:15] of the service that could stop the
[2:01:17] purpose of God not your job not your
[2:01:19] family not sickness not the doctor not
[2:01:22] even death could stop the powers of God
[2:01:24] because if you put down this body
[2:01:26] there's another body waiting for you
[2:01:28] because your seed is who you are that is
[2:01:30] who you are the real you can the church
[2:01:32] say Amen Give the Lord a shout of
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:37] Praise And when you see that you start
[2:01:39] to look at their trials different and
[2:01:41] they start to see Jesus and he has
[2:01:43] changed like I said at the beginning not
[2:01:45] why is it happened to me and P me no why
[2:01:47] is it happen for me what is god pushing
[2:01:49] me away from what is god pushing me to
[2:01:51] why did God allow this to happen because
[2:01:53] if you can't forgive if you can't love
[2:01:55] if you can't have if you can't if you
[2:01:56] can't do these things you can't go over
[2:01:57] there because only perfect love will get
[2:01:59] you there and only people close to you
[2:02:01] could hurt
[2:02:03] you anybody with me this evening s we
[2:02:06] would see
[2:02:08] Jesus friends it's not just a phrase you
[2:02:10] know situations have to come to you so
[2:02:14] that we can see Jesus in
[2:02:15] you can I say that one more time
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:22] we read that scripture with with uh
[2:02:24] Judas was there talking about the
[2:02:27] ointment but je but Judas was all the
[2:02:29] way to the whole Ministry and you
[2:02:31] couldn't tell that Jesus was treating
[2:02:34] Judas any
[2:02:38] different in so much and Judas was so
[2:02:41] well hidden that when Jesus asked the
[2:02:43] question or when Jesus told them one of
[2:02:45] you will will will betray me everybody
[2:02:48] they say Lord is it
[2:02:50] I it's not as if they say I feel I know
[2:02:53] who it is you
[2:02:55] know they could even
[2:02:58] say somebody I know his brother so and
[2:03:01] so been acting funny you
[2:03:03] know when Jesus said one of you will
[2:03:06] betray me everybody said look at your
[2:03:08] lord is there something in me that I
[2:03:09] don't he said Lord is it I and when you
[2:03:12] ever get into that proximity with Jesus
[2:03:15] you stop looking at the person next to
[2:03:16] you you know he said Lord is it
[2:03:20] meall is it me have to fix something is
[2:03:23] there something because pressure does
[2:03:25] make people do things so you always know
[2:03:28] when somebody really meet Jesus you know
[2:03:30] because when you really meet he can
[2:03:32] never look at the person next to you
[2:03:34] because just like Isaiah when he come to
[2:03:36] the presence of God what he say who is
[2:03:38] me not his who is
[2:03:42] him so I given you a key for your own
[2:03:46] walk with God and when people going
[2:03:48] around with the pointing finger thing
[2:03:50] they say Jesus
[2:03:57] find me one place where Jesus publicly
[2:04:00] embarrass
[2:04:04] somebody and make them feel
[2:04:07] bad because of their
[2:04:10] sin s we would see
[2:04:14] Jesus that woman who was caught in the
[2:04:16] very Act of
[2:04:18] adultery and they say well look Jesus we
[2:04:21] about to Stone he said no problem no
[2:04:23] problem which of you without sin go
[2:04:25] ahead and cast
[2:04:26] it and Jesus look away from them so that
[2:04:29] they and all I feel
[2:04:31] bad and by the time he turned back
[2:04:33] around brother M they gone he look at
[2:04:37] her now and say where are your
[2:04:39] accusers notice he say how much times
[2:04:43] you do the
[2:04:45] ACT how long you in this
[2:04:49] situation he said where are you accuser
[2:04:51] neither do I condemn
[2:04:53] thee go and sin no more s we would see
[2:05:02] Jesus you know what situations we have
[2:05:05] faced with in this year
[2:05:07] 2024 that if Jesus was in the room
[2:05:10] overseeing the administration of the
[2:05:12] situation it would be
[2:05:15] different we need to see
[2:05:18] Jesus how many times we have spoken to
[2:05:21] our ch children a certain way and if
[2:05:24] Jesus who is the father treat his
[2:05:26] children a certain way what if we see
[2:05:29] some more of
[2:05:32] Jesus I always talk about the way but
[2:05:34] Branham lived because but Branham knew
[2:05:37] Brothers in the church who couldn't
[2:05:38] handle ministers
[2:05:40] Oran and ministers who are WR the
[2:05:43] prophet who knew it say how brother
[2:05:44] Billy how you could treat him so you say
[2:05:46] hoping one
[2:05:49] day because Jesus was V
[2:05:52] Ed in that short brother from
[2:05:55] Kentucky say we would see
[2:05:59] Jesus how different we would deal with
[2:06:02] situations and family conflict and
[2:06:05] issues if Jesus was allowed permission
[2:06:08] to guide your
[2:06:13] words because that's still small voice
[2:06:16] is very much active you know but we tune
[2:06:17] it
[2:06:19] out but the brandham taught us your
[2:06:21] conscience and these things are designed
[2:06:23] to protect you but after a while for
[2:06:26] somebody to end up in your world brother
[2:06:27] mam said God doesn't send anybody to
[2:06:30] hell he said you run every red light to
[2:06:33] get
[2:06:35] there because God is trying to prevent
[2:06:37] you for making wrong decisions and every
[2:06:39] time you see and there's a red light he
[2:06:42] say you're making a choice to run the
[2:06:43] red
[2:06:45] light
[2:06:47] s we would see Jesus anybody with me
[2:06:51] tonight
[2:06:53] and I'll share this and I've Shar this
[2:06:54] before I know I supposed to be wrapping
[2:06:56] up but could we take a a more the
[2:06:59] prophet of God and I Shar it with young
[2:07:01] people a lot the prophet of God hung a
[2:07:04] cross in his
[2:07:06] car he left in
[2:07:09] 1965 we're going into
[2:07:13] 2025 and back then he hung across in his
[2:07:16] car so when he see the woman walking in
[2:07:18] the street
[2:07:21] and if you compare a picture of the
[2:07:23] woman in
[2:07:26] 1965 to
[2:07:29] 2025 the cross we need to put carit in
[2:07:32] the
[2:07:38] car the cross will be going out the left
[2:07:41] side door the right window that make a
[2:07:44] hole in the back of the car your car is
[2:07:46] a
[2:07:48] cross because times have changed
[2:07:52] but he is the same yesterday today and
[2:07:55] forever so there has to be something
[2:07:57] bigger than your intellect and your idea
[2:08:00] there has to be a change on the inside
[2:08:02] so that how you deal with life is
[2:08:06] Jesus in the driver's seat of your
[2:08:10] car not a quot or an understanding of
[2:08:13] the message but Jesus in full control
[2:08:17] you look in the mirror and Jesus looking
[2:08:19] back at you and something says I can't
[2:08:20] wear this this way
[2:08:23] because you know when people looking for
[2:08:25] you they ready need to see
[2:08:29] Jesus can the church say Amen am oh
[2:08:33] Hallelujah can we give the Lord a shout
[2:08:35] of Praise I'm trying to wrap up here you
[2:08:37] love the
[2:08:40] [Applause]
[2:08:42] Lord Brother brandham said here about
[2:08:44] something he knew his back seting
[2:08:46] condition could not be the challenge of
[2:08:47] the the music could get ready to come up
[2:08:49] so does the church know now we can do it
[2:08:51] under this this condition Hallelujah
[2:08:54] glory to God but there's a possibility
[2:08:57] Samson said he saw a possibility and I
[2:09:00] want to see Jesus as your possibility if
[2:09:03] you have not tried Jesus fully try him
[2:09:05] this time if you have not dedicated your
[2:09:07] entire year to him before there have
[2:09:09] been many all years night services but
[2:09:11] let this one be different Hallelujah we
[2:09:15] are in
[2:09:16] 2025 Happy New Year may the Lord bless
[2:09:18] you may he Prosper you may his faith
[2:09:21] shine upon you may he fill you with the
[2:09:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire may
[2:09:25] your cup run over in so much that those
[2:09:29] around you get blessed may it be for you
[2:09:31] and your house may he Grant every desire
[2:09:34] of your heart Hallelujah may you prosper
[2:09:38] may you conquer every gate that comes
[2:09:40] your way can the church say
[2:09:44] Amen oh Hallelujah brother Bram said
[2:09:48] Samson saw a possibility and may you see
[2:09:51] Jesus as your possibility for 2025 he
[2:09:54] said a he saw possibility that God will
[2:09:56] hear me friends what if God answers your
[2:09:59] prayer tonight what is your prayer and
[2:10:02] if God answers your prayer tonight what
[2:10:03] is that prayer tonight he saw a
[2:10:05] possibility that God will hear me he he
[2:10:07] said while he thought the Philistines
[2:10:09] had not noticed him while this little
[2:10:11] boy had untied his hands he walked say
[2:10:13] lay my hands upon the post there is a
[2:10:16] possibility I wish the church could see
