[13:41] norbs
[13:42] mr knights
[13:44] mr norbert bretonites
[13:46] known to many loved and respected by all
[13:50] today as we bid farewell to dad in the
[13:53] natural here on earth
[13:55] we celebrate with the angels his going
[13:57] home to the heavens
[13:59] there is so much to be said that can be
[14:02] said for someone like daddy who has
[14:04] lived for a lifetime
[14:06] three score and ten years
[14:10] it's hard to find words to describe or
[14:12] even summarize his life
[14:14] but i'll try
[14:17] born in 1950 to harold and carolyn
[14:19] knights he was the third child of four
[14:22] dads spent all his youth in belmont with
[14:24] his parents and younger brother nigel
[14:27] one night while attending a baptist
[14:30] service with bernanton
[14:32] daddy spotted an attractive young lady
[14:34] yvette
[14:35] he introduced himself and a friendship
[14:38] soon blossomed
[14:39] she would later become his first wife
[14:42] and the two became a family of six
[14:45] my eldest siblings stephanie nathaniel
[14:47] and i spent our early years on the hills
[14:49] of saint barb's belmont
[14:51] however
[14:52] shortly before my younger sister karen
[14:55] was born he would move the family to
[14:57] bonnie where he lived the rest of his
[14:59] life
[15:00] dad took his role as a provider very
[15:03] seriously and worked hard to take care
[15:05] of his family our memories of daddy
[15:08] leaving home in his long sleeve crisp
[15:10] white shirt navy blue pants black tie
[15:13] and black officer hat with a gold trim
[15:15] and yours to this day
[15:18] dad was a licensing officer but not just
[15:21] any licensing officer
[15:23] he was officer knight
[15:25] mr knight
[15:27] feared by many but respected by all
[15:30] on the road mr knights would make many a
[15:32] maximum scamper especially on the
[15:35] priority bus route anybody can testify
[15:38] to this
[15:40] i believe all his children had similar
[15:43] experiences being picked up from school
[15:45] and on the way home having to make many
[15:48] details and stops as a result of him
[15:50] chasing some law breaker upper side
[15:53] street or stopping every five minutes to
[15:55] pull a maxi or taxi driver over for
[15:57] overloading
[15:59] excessive loud music or dark tint
[16:01] i used to hide in the backseat because i
[16:03] didn't want them to mark my face
[16:06] nathaniel remembers being stared at by
[16:09] drivers as if they wanted to beat him
[16:11] because daddy emptied a maxi for
[16:12] overloading with school children
[16:15] karen and stephanie had similar
[16:16] experiences
[16:18] being pulled over by daddy all righty
[16:20] had to do is just step out of the car
[16:22] and all taxis on the stand got in line
[16:25] at the office he took no bribes a no
[16:28] nonsense person a stickler for rules a
[16:31] man of integrity that didn't look
[16:34] that didn't back down or given to anyone
[16:36] when it came to doing the right thing
[16:39] mr knight however he didn't spend all
[16:42] his work life at licensing he moved the
[16:45] traffic management branch as a traffic
[16:46] safety officer and was involved in road
[16:49] safety programs school lectures and
[16:51] defensive driving training until he
[16:53] retired
[16:54] at home
[16:59] at home
[17:13] mr knight's uncle nobody
[17:15] daddy was just as strict everyone in the
[17:18] neighborhood respected him and some were
[17:20] even afraid of his seeming severity
[17:23] you could not come in his yard to lime
[17:25] or waste time
[17:26] daddy ran a tight ship
[17:28] he pushed us and supported us in our
[17:30] academics he cheered us on in our
[17:33] endeavors
[17:34] he kept a tight grip on his daughters
[17:37] whenever we went out even though he knew
[17:39] where and with whom he still called even
[17:42] if it was with the young people from
[17:44] church he wanted to know exactly what
[17:46] time and who would drop us home
[17:49] all through adulthood as well
[17:51] nathaniel did not always fare so well
[17:54] many a night he would reach home after
[17:55] suit an hour and meet the front door
[17:58] locked thank god for mommy
[18:03] despite that strict approach we knew he
[18:05] loved us
[18:07] daddy also loved his barbadian family
[18:10] uncle nobod for those that didn't know
[18:12] was beijon by dissent his daily calls to
[18:15] his nieces sometimes several times a day
[18:18] were an important part of his routine
[18:21] and whenever he could he would travel
[18:23] there to spend time and catch up with
[18:25] family and friends
[18:27] that was not just our father but a
[18:29] father figure and mentor to others
[18:31] he had adopted two sons that he took
[18:34] under his wings lorne greene and
[18:35] christopher jackson and helped nurture
[18:38] and guide them to be who they are today
[18:41] liesel and kalisha were also adopted
[18:43] into the family and they called him pops
[18:46] young men like calvin nigel and
[18:49] ahab and just to name a few looked up to
[18:52] him and often sought his counsel
[18:55] after mummy passed away dad would meet
[18:57] and marry sister greece and they spent
[18:59] the last 13 years together
[19:01] our family now expanded and he embraced
[19:04] her two children alicia ann salvon
[19:06] dad and auntie grace had 11
[19:08] grandchildren among them despite his
[19:10] ailments which is the grace by his side
[19:13] in his later days he always looked
[19:15] forward to family gatherings with her
[19:17] soul
[19:18] a real family man and devoted christian
[19:21] brother knights was a true servant of
[19:23] god
[19:24] always giving up himself and his time
[19:26] whenever and wherever he could in
[19:28] service
[19:29] but a knight served that headstone
[19:31] tabernacle in many capacities a humble
[19:34] man
[19:34] never hesitated to work for the lord and
[19:37] he did it to perfection down to the very
[19:39] last detail
[19:41] whenever the church held international
[19:43] conventions dad showed up for duty
[19:45] welcoming and greeting the brethren and
[19:47] ministers both local and foreign with
[19:50] his signature smile
[19:52] making sure they had everything they
[19:54] needed making sure they felt at home and
[19:56] coordinating their transport for smooth
[19:58] transitions
[20:00] as a true organizer he spearheaded the
[20:02] church library managing recordings and
[20:04] books keeping it running like a
[20:06] well-oiled machine then training other
[20:08] members to do same
[20:10] but the knights was a reliable
[20:12] dependable gentleman he never stopped
[20:15] praying
[20:16] he had some rough moments but held onto
[20:18] god's promises he constantly prayed for
[20:21] his family and brethren even to the end
[20:24] i'm very sure
[20:27] daddy
[20:28] grandpa
[20:29] uncle

[20:32] missed we are all saddened by such a
[20:35] great loss of a husband

[20:48] words of wisdom
[20:50] hugs
[20:51] arguments disagreements

[21:34] amen at this time we'll have special
[21:36] tributes and uh we'd like to call upon
[21:38] uh lika
[21:39] zalika and kiara i hope i got that right
[21:42] yeah uh to do a poem
[21:45] okay so if they just come
[21:47] and do so amen
[21:49] that would be fine
[22:08] if tomorrow starts without me
[22:11] if tomorrow stanford told me and i'm not
[22:14] there to see
[22:15] if the sun should rise and find your
[22:17] eyes filled with tears
[22:19] with tears for me
[22:22] i wish so much you didn't cry the way
[22:25] you did today
[22:26] while thinking of the many things we
[22:29] didn't get to see
[22:31] i know how much you all love me as much
[22:35] as i love you
[22:37] and each time that you think of me
[22:39] i know you'll miss me too
[22:42] but when tomorrow starts without me
[22:45] please try and understand
[22:47] that an angel came and called my name
[22:50] and took me by my hand
[22:52] and said my place was already in heaven
[22:55] far above and that i'd have to leave
[22:58] behind all those ideally love
[23:01] but as i turned to walk away
[23:04] a tear fell from my eye
[23:06] for all my life i didn't always thought
[23:09] i didn't want to die
[23:12] i had so much to live for so much left
[23:15] yet to do
[23:17] it seems almost impossible that i'm
[23:20] leaving you
[23:22] i thought
[23:23] of all the yesterdays the good ones and
[23:26] bad
[23:27] i thought of all the love we shared and
[23:29] all the fun we had
[23:32] if i could live yesterday jeff even for
[23:35] a while
[23:36] i'd say goodbye and kiss you
[23:40] and maybe see you smile
[23:45] but then i fully realized that this
[23:47] could never be for emptiness and
[23:49] memories would take the place of me
[23:51] and when i thought of wilderness things
[23:53] i might miss come tomorrow
[23:55] i thought of you and when i did my heart
[23:58] was filled with sorrow
[23:59] but when i walked through heaven's gate
[24:01] i felt so much at home
[24:03] when god looked down and smiled at me
[24:05] from his golden throne
[24:13] he said
[24:14] this is eternity and all i have promised
[24:17] today
[24:19] your life on it is past but there is
[24:21] life start anew
[24:23] i promise not tomorrow but today will
[24:25] always last and since each day the same
[24:28] there is no longing for the past
[24:31] you have been so faithful so trusting
[24:33] and so true
[24:34] though there were times you didn't you
[24:36] did some things you shouldn't have done
[24:39] but you have been forgiven and now at
[24:42] last you're free
[24:43] so won't you come and take my hand and
[24:45] share my life with me
[24:47] so when tomorrow starts without me don't
[24:50] think we are far apart for every time
[24:52] you think of me i'm writing your heart
[25:02] wonderful do you appreciate that today
[25:05] amen
[25:06] and amen
[25:07] now uh one more item we'd like to have
[25:09] um
[25:10] we like to call on the brother of the
[25:12] deceased brother nigel knight
[25:14] as you begin to come forward and say a
[25:16] few words
[25:18] to us this evening amen
[25:24] good afternoon
[25:28] was my eldest brother
[25:29] we grew up in belmont together
[25:32] we went to school in primary school
[25:34] together and he went to college i did i
[25:36] didn't go to that
[25:38] but
[25:39] after
[25:40] his
[25:41] maturity
[25:42] and getting married and moving to borneo
[25:45] we had a very close bond
[25:49] i would visit him he would visit me
[25:51] but when you come by me you know he's
[25:53] home because there's another house
[25:55] and we had a good thing going even when
[25:58] he was married even
[26:00] we would have a little get together and
[26:03] things like that but the main thing is
[26:05] that he was always a serious fellow
[26:10] commented his scripture in the bible and
[26:12] family
[26:14] that is his role but the thing is even
[26:16] when we
[26:17] had that closeness
[26:19] and we separated we were never a part
[26:22] and that we would call one another more
[26:23] than once a day
[26:25] and i can remember
[26:27] times when any problem i have
[26:30] i would call him
[26:31] and he would be my
[26:32] backup

[30:21] mr robert knights have a silently closer
[30:24] dog life and
[30:26] departed from us
[30:29] my history with this dear friend began
[30:32] in 2003
[30:34] when as an engineer i joined traffic
[30:37] management branch
[30:39] mr nyx he was one of two traffic safety
[30:43] officers
[30:44] assigned to the branch
[30:47] working out of the head office in port
[30:49] of spain
[30:51] from day one
[30:55] we had a jovial and cooperative
[30:58] relationship
[30:59] we shared experience both
[31:02] professional and personal
[31:05] on the professional level
[31:07] he was considered by oil to be an expert
[31:10] in the area of road safety
[31:13] his knowledge and wisdom was sought by
[31:16] all of us
[31:18] juniors
[31:21] we were
[31:22] in comparison to him
[31:25] it was a great benefit
[31:28] that made our roads safe with his
[31:32] guidance
[31:34] as time went on he arrived at the point
[31:37] he arrived at the point of retirement
[31:39] from the ministry
[31:42] he consented to continue
[31:45] on a contract position as a traffic
[31:48] management inspector
[31:50] and that allows us the opportunity
[31:53] to experience more of his advice
[31:57] for a bit longer
[31:59] eventually
[32:00] he did go into
[32:01] retirement in a way he continued to do
[32:05] road safety
[32:06] with other agencies
[32:10] and
[32:12] that is
[32:13] that is the most special thing that
[32:15] somebody after all at this time
[32:17] incentives going home and
[32:20] doing gardening or anything like that he
[32:22] keep his mind on the fact that our roads
[32:25] need to be safe
[32:28] i can with all prejudices say that he
[32:31] give more than he received
[32:33] he give give give
[32:36] such was
[32:38] the value
[32:40] of mr nova knights
[32:44] in retirement
[32:48] in his retirement
[32:51] we
[32:52] at traffic management branch continued
[32:55] on as best as we could
[32:58] leaning heavily on the knowledge and the
[33:00] advice
[33:02] he left
[33:03] for us
[33:05] it was greatest sadness
[33:08] we now face this person
[33:10] i will have to face a future without
[33:12] being able to just alter the blue reach
[33:15] out to him
[33:18] family
[33:19] colleagues friends
[33:21] hearts and prayers are with you
[33:24] we'll all miss him
[33:28] good night mr nyx traffic
[33:32] safety officer supreme

[33:38] wouldn't say much on a personal side
[33:40] with his interaction with me

[34:20] ronald mountain amen as you would be

[34:24] few words about our precious brother
[34:25] norwood knights amen this afternoon so
[34:28] go bless you as he comes amen
[34:37] praise god
[34:39] well greetings to all
[34:42] all souls
[34:43] everybody here to support
[34:46] our fresher soul precious brother who
[34:48] has gone unto the lord
[34:50] i have known
[34:53] for the night as a dear friend
[34:56] even before we became
[34:59] president of brothers in christ together
[35:04] and i was teaching at the glacial
[35:06] argentine school
[35:09] in vermont there
[35:11] and i met for a night's day i believe it
[35:14] was 1969
[35:16] he used to come to the school
[35:19] because he had one or two
[35:22] teachers in the school who is friends
[35:26] and i'll say a little more about that
[35:28] because knights has always sung well i'm
[35:30] seeing it now
[35:31] where nights one of the qualities of
[35:33] other knights
[35:35] was always somebody who was always
[35:37] trying to
[35:40] improve himself i should see
[35:44] improve his knowledge grease
[35:47] of life
[35:49] and
[35:51] or life in general
[35:53] and brandeis would always attach himself
[35:56] to persons whom he felt
[35:59] could help him
[36:01] on life's journey
[36:03] and that's a great quality that i have
[36:05] observed in veronites and he brought
[36:07] that quality over
[36:09] into his
[36:11] christian
[36:12] walk with the lord
[36:14] and his devotion to the word of god
[36:17] and he has always been had a great
[36:20] capacity
[36:22] and a great thirst within him
[36:24] for
[36:26] the word of god and to improve and serve
[36:28] their why
[36:30] um
[36:32] renaissance when i when we became
[36:34] friends at gloucester i discovered very
[36:37] early that we were we had the same birth
[36:39] date
[36:41] so
[36:42] 10th of october 1950 was his
[36:45] 10th of october 1946 was mine
[36:49] i landed here four years
[36:52] before him
[36:55] and
[36:56] but the thing is
[36:58] he has entered where i landed on earth
[37:00] four years before him
[37:03] and he has entered the portals of glory
[37:06] before me
[37:09] so we always had this kind of twin
[37:12] relationship
[37:13] we used to describe ourselves as twins
[37:17] spiritually speaking
[37:20] because of that same buddhist and we are
[37:22] also baptized
[37:25] on the same day
[37:27] um
[37:28] i think
[37:30] as the root referred to that
[37:33] and absolute i didn't know that he had
[37:36] met
[37:37] his first wife on that day
[37:40] this was quite a revelation to me
[37:44] but
[37:47] there's a little story around the
[37:48] baptism
[37:50] but knight is the one who introduced me
[37:52] to this message
[37:53] that we follow
[37:56] and um
[37:57] actually by introducing me mainly to
[37:59] brother phipps
[38:01] who was an evangelist at the time
[38:04] and um
[38:05] [Music]
[38:06] brazil was the one who really you know
[38:08] gave
[38:10] put me into the depths of the message
[38:11] but the nights when i were
[38:13] in the baptist feasts together
[38:17] and he met with the phipps
[38:20] at some point in time and he used to
[38:22] tell me about this brother and this
[38:24] message and so on
[38:26] and i wasn't
[38:28] too impressed at first
[38:30] but then after the night's wedding to so
[38:32] when he was getting ready to eat that
[38:36] um i met with the hips
[38:38] and when the fifth was there
[38:40] um telling me asking me because i was a
[38:43] preacher baptist church and where the
[38:46] night is there and where the sisters
[38:48] they are asking me
[38:50] if i know what church age we're living
[38:53] in
[38:54] well i hadn't a clue as to what he was
[38:56] talking about i didn't even know there
[38:57] was such a thing as church ages
[38:59] far less of the action of your churches
[39:02] you know you're living in so i tell you
[39:04] well you tell me
[39:05] so you said laodicea
[39:08] and um
[39:10] he said you are a preacher and you don't
[39:11] know what your church you're living in
[39:13] you know well
[39:15] i don't know how you expected me to know
[39:18] but i
[39:19] i soon found out
[39:21] because i went home
[39:24] and um
[39:25] between sleep and week i heard a voice
[39:27] say loudly sail
[39:30] and that kind of shook me
[39:33] and brother sims was introducing me to
[39:36] baptism in jesus name but the night was
[39:38] already convinced of it
[39:40] and um i was kind of like oh that's
[39:43] cutting splitting hairs you know
[39:45] but then i i became convinced
[39:49] so the day of the night's baptism he
[39:51] decided to get baptized
[39:54] um in jesus name
[39:56] because you know people look at
[39:57] baptizing father son and holy ghost
[40:00] uh i was baptized that way but jesus
[40:03] name you know
[40:05] so he and he invited me of course to the
[40:07] baptist and of course i'd be here for
[40:08] the night's baptism
[40:11] not knowing and i suspect
[40:13] this was a little
[40:15] arrangement routine for the knights and
[40:17] would have hits
[40:19] because it's actually when i was at the
[40:21] baptism at karanas
[40:23] i said um
[40:25] he said to me
[40:28] uh branton would you like to get rough
[40:29] times
[40:30] i said i didn't bring any clothes
[40:33] you know i was convinced already
[40:37] and um he said well i brought clothes
[40:40] so he had a plants and everything and he
[40:42] wrote a toil and everything
[40:45] so i couldn't refuse because i was
[40:47] already convinced and the clothes were
[40:48] there
[40:51] and um we got baptized together
[40:53] and god is an eyewitness
[40:55] after our president reinvoke him right
[40:58] down on the sea
[40:59] as he came out of the water
[41:02] so that was my
[41:03] great moment with my dear friend
[41:07] were knights
[41:09] and
[41:10] one of the things this is a bit of humor
[41:12] here
[41:13] we um
[41:15] i used to
[41:17] in order to supplement my
[41:18] salary i used to get eggs wholesale from
[41:22] a farm in santa cruz i lived
[41:25] and i would go house to house and sell
[41:28] do home deliveries
[41:31] and when knights got into it after a
[41:34] while as well
[41:35] doing home deliveries now he told me
[41:38] and as the
[41:39] officer said just now you're the safety
[41:42] officer
[41:43] so you find that they would invite these
[41:45] safety officers to schools
[41:49] to um
[41:50] talk to the children about road safety
[41:54] so when i went to one of these schools
[41:56] to talk about roar
[42:01] just now where nice gave me this joker
[42:03] so it's not me telling the joke on him
[42:05] she told
[42:08] so he's there
[42:10] question his
[42:12] officers clothes and everything and
[42:14] safety officer real you know serious
[42:17] and he's telling holloway safety you
[42:18] know a little boy at the class
[42:21] shouted out
[42:23] he used the eggman
[42:28] [Laughter]
[42:39] you know a time we had quite a time in
[42:41] our lives he was full of humor nights as
[42:44] you know
[42:46] and he was very personable as the
[42:48] officer testified as well
[42:50] and he's very friendly
[42:52] and he would make friends very easily
[42:54] with people
[42:56] and he was very strict really and i
[42:59] could believe some of these stories he
[43:01] told um
[43:03] esther root
[43:04] um but he was very strict and he brought
[43:07] that strictness over into his work
[43:10] and made him very professional
[43:12] and nothing wrong with me in being
[43:14] strict you know
[43:16] but he had that personality so i loved
[43:19] him dearly as a friend
[43:21] i was in touch with him during his
[43:22] ailment
[43:24] and um we still you know when we're
[43:27] talking on the phone during his ailment
[43:30] and he's cracking jokes and i said well
[43:32] you still have this
[43:34] sense of humor and so on and we would
[43:36] laugh and talk and so on it was
[43:39] used to hear that he had passed
[43:42] on the very morning i think that he had
[43:44] passed the night before

[47:29] it amen god bless you just want to read
[47:31] two portions of scripture
[47:33] uh revelation 20 reading from verse 11
[47:36] to 15
[47:37] and the other scripture i want to read
[47:38] from science 90 and that's times 90 his
[47:41] description of the night shared with me
[47:43] many many years ago
[47:45] and i
[47:45] [Music]
[47:46] i um it just stuck with me and i said
[47:50] that if it's one script i'm going to
[47:51] read is that one that he shared from
[47:53] sam's 90.
[47:54] but i want to read from revelation 20
[47:56] reading from verse 11
[47:58] is i saw a great white throne
[48:00] on him that sat on it
[48:02] from whose face the earth and the heaven
[48:04] fled away
[48:05] and there was found no place for them
[48:08] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[48:10] before god
[48:12] and the books were opened another book
[48:14] was open
[48:15] which is the book of life
[48:17] and the dead would judge out of those
[48:19] things which are written in the books
[48:21] according to their works
[48:23] and the sea give up the dead which were
[48:26] in it
[48:27] and death and hell
[48:29] delivered of the dead which are in them
[48:32] and they would judge
[48:34] every man
[48:35] according to their works
[48:38] so this is not when you're dead you're
[48:39] done
[48:40] all the dead good evil bad ugly whatever
[48:44] they have to come up
[48:45] and listen
[48:47] and death and hell
[48:48] were cast into the lake of fire
[48:51] this is the second death
[48:53] or there's a second death yes there is
[48:56] verse 15 and whosoever was not found
[48:58] written in the book of life was cast
[49:01] into the lake of fire
[49:03] under some psalms 90
[49:05] the prayer of moses is the man of god
[49:07] lord that was been our dwelling place in
[49:09] all generations before the mountains
[49:11] were brought forth forever that was
[49:13] formed the earth and the world even from
[49:16] everlasting to everlasting though at god
[49:19] the alternates man to destruction and
[49:21] serious return the children of men
[49:24] for a thousand years in thy sight
[49:26] about us yesterday
[49:28] when it is passed
[49:30] and as a watch in the night
[49:31] though carries them away as with a flood
[49:34] they are us asleep
[49:36] in the morning they're like grass which
[49:38] grow it up in the morning it flourish it
[49:41] and grow it up
[49:42] in the evening it is cut down and wither
[49:45] it
[49:46] for we are consumed by the anger
[49:48] and by rat we are are we troubled
[49:51] that was set our iniquities before thee
[49:54] our secret sins inside light of thy
[49:57] countenance
[49:58] for all our days are passed away in thy
[50:01] wrath
[50:02] and this is a
[50:03] part i want to emphasize we spend our
[50:06] years
[50:07] as a tale that is told
[50:09] the days of our years are three score
[50:11] years and ten
[50:13] and if by reason of strength may be four
[50:15] score years yet is their strength
[50:18] labor and sorrow
[50:19] for it is soon cut off
[50:21] and we fly away who know at the paul
[50:23] then anger even according to thy fear
[50:26] so is irat so teach us
[50:29] to number our days
[50:30] that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
[50:32] may god bless this word you may be
[50:34] seated but i want to thank you for
[50:36] coming out and um to give
[50:39] your respects uh
[50:41] to
[50:42] our brother knights
[50:44] as you all know he was an active member
[50:46] of this assembly and
[50:48] he held his but isaac said almost every
[50:50] office usher deacon trustee elder
[50:54] and he was
[50:56] a friend of mine
[50:58] i remember years ago when he had some
[51:00] problems and challenges and troubles he
[51:02] called me
[51:03] he said well to you i don't want to
[51:04] speak to a pastor i want to speak to a
[51:06] friend say here am i
[51:08] we have been friends since
[51:10] and if there's one person
[51:12] understood the vision that we presented
[51:15] was brother knights
[51:16] and um i shared with him comes in the
[51:19] library and he
[51:21] caught it to have that support system
[51:24] that the people could go and have food
[51:26] in the storehouse
[51:28] and he really run with it and i
[51:29] certainly appreciate
[51:31] all that he has done
[51:32] and he really gives service to the
[51:34] saints of god many things you don't know
[51:37] behind the scenes what he'd be working
[51:38] on working with and how you have been
[51:40] such a tremendous assistance
[51:42] to the ministry
[51:43] he was a close right-hand person to us
[51:46] we will surely
[51:47] miss him
[51:49] but then to our texts
[51:51] it is a text that he
[51:54] he spoke to me about it in a certain way
[51:57] and i just just i couldn't leave it and
[51:59] you know it's kind of odd
[52:01] i haven't visited any home really since
[52:03] the pandemic
[52:05] and um it so happened the friday before
[52:07] he passed
[52:09] our sister marie asked if we could go
[52:10] for a drive
[52:12] we had two of our of our grandchildren
[52:14] she said let's go down by brown knights
[52:17] and went on there
[52:19] went to his home
[52:21] speak a little bit to him
[52:23] and
[52:24] little did i know that was the last time
[52:26] i was seeing him
[52:27] last time i remember the last few words
[52:29] i shared with him why is car
[52:31] and he gave me that nice smile i call it
[52:34] yeah that night smile
[52:36] and i said god knows all things uh
[52:40] you know and
[52:42] it it
[52:44] it speaks to us things like this because
[52:46] this is not what we expect this morning
[52:48] to learn mary i didn't expect to have as
[52:51] part of um
[52:52] the the um what i say
[52:55] we had a funeral on november 9th this is
[52:59] not what i expect to have
[53:00] written here but
[53:02] it is what it is and we just be grateful
[53:04] to god
[53:05] that we have this opportunity to
[53:06] [Music]
[53:08] pass each other's in
[53:10] in in a way where we could meet each
[53:11] other
[53:12] and be a blessing to god's people
[53:15] he had a picture of the kingdom and this
[53:17] is what we share
[53:19] but you're not serving a church you're
[53:21] serving
[53:22] the kingdom of god
[53:24] we don't belong to this building or this
[53:27] group we really and sincerely belong
[53:29] to god's kingdom
[53:31] and we get this opportunity
[53:33] you know to serve him with all our
[53:35] hearts
[53:36] we spend our years
[53:40] it's it's powerful how the bible say our
[53:43] years
[53:44] as if you own it
[53:46] but we
[53:47] have years
[53:48] as a loan
[53:50] not as if we own
[53:52] but is loaned to us just as our children
[53:56] alone to us
[53:57] many people don't catch that
[54:00] even your children is on loan to you
[54:04] we spend our years our years because
[54:06] it's a loan to us your
[54:08] years our years
[54:11] and god has fit time
[54:14] into years
[54:15] into years he fit months
[54:18] into months he fit weeks into weeks if
[54:21] it days
[54:22] in the days he fit hours into hours
[54:25] he fit minutes into minutes he fits
[54:27] seconds
[54:29] as you waste and spend your seconds you
[54:31] spend your minutes
[54:33] you spend your
[54:35] days your weeks your months your years
[54:38] and you end up right there
[54:40] in that box
[54:42] we spend
[54:44] our years
[54:46] as a tale that is stored
[54:50] many times we take time for granted
[54:53] time
[54:54] in itself
[54:56] now time has a beginning
[54:58] and anything that has a beginning has an
[55:00] end
[55:02] you know you stink sometimes age bring
[55:05] wisdom
[55:06] that's not all together true
[55:08] sometimes aids just bring people older
[55:12] not wise
[55:13] because people could be set in their
[55:16] ways
[55:17] so that is why we exhorted to
[55:20] help us lord to
[55:22] teach us to number our days
[55:25] that we may apply our hearts
[55:28] to wisdom
[55:30] wisdom is not knowledge
[55:32] knowledge is information
[55:34] wisdom is how you're going to apply
[55:37] that knowledge to your life
[55:39] i remember ten years before when a night
[55:42] retired
[55:43] speaking with him
[55:45] i said brother knights
[55:47] say 10 years from now you'll be retired
[55:49] what's the plan
[55:50] and he watched me as as if
[55:53] in amazement
[55:55] what are you talking about
[55:57] and of course i'm younger than him
[56:00] but i like to see
[56:02] a vowel
[56:04] i like to see
[56:06] a vision
[56:07] that
[56:08] your steps could be measured to where
[56:10] you know you have to go well
[56:13] those 10 years past so swiftly
[56:17] that he told someone you know but i
[56:19] overtold him ten years ago about he's
[56:21] going to retire he never took it on and
[56:24] when he went to work declare his desk in
[56:26] other words they once said get out
[56:27] quickly that's how the system is they
[56:29] have no time with you somebody doesn't
[56:30] want to sit in your seat
[56:33] and i said this to say this to you
[56:36] without a vision
[56:39] without you being introspective of your
[56:42] life
[56:43] to say where am i going
[56:45] you will continue along the same
[56:47] trajectory
[56:49] you need to pull back and take a pause
[56:52] and say wait a minute
[56:53] talk to yourself
[56:55] go in the mirror
[56:56] where i am going
[56:58] how am i going how am i doing many
[57:01] people don't take inventory they live
[57:03] day by day
[57:05] and some people think they own the days
[57:08] but you don't
[57:09] that is why you have to consider god for
[57:12] your mercy and grace i thank you
[57:14] because you give me this day that i
[57:16] could breed that i could live that i
[57:18] could have friends and so on like that
[57:20] the days or years be three scores and
[57:23] ten seventy if my reason of strength to
[57:25] be four score years yet in their
[57:27] strength labor and sorrow
[57:29] it is soon cut off and we fly away
[57:33] and i was thinking something in thinking
[57:35] about preparing something to share with
[57:36] you
[57:38] about aging
[57:40] and about becoming vulnerable
[57:43] jesus told peter you're young you do
[57:44] your own thing but someday when you get
[57:46] older you will be led
[57:48] where you don't want to go
[57:51] and many times we feel because we have
[57:53] strength and amount and we have money or
[57:55] we have a car we have this or we have
[57:57] that we could stay and do whatever we
[57:59] want
[58:00] but we all heading down this
[58:02] this bridge this road
[58:05] this road of
[58:06] accountability this road that we must
[58:09] give an account
[58:10] and that's why i read this scripture all
[58:12] the dead from the sea they're coming up
[58:14] they have to be judged
[58:16] and then there's a second dead
[58:18] we have an opportunity to
[58:21] make this bridge this turn and every
[58:23] time somebody slip over a sin going on
[58:25] because we have no we have many people
[58:27] that have gone on to be with the lord
[58:29] it's like a mystery
[58:31] what are they doing
[58:32] who are they meeting just a couple of
[58:34] months but amanda has left us
[58:37] i mean no better nights i'm having a
[58:38] good fellowship among us we we we know
[58:40] that
[58:41] but yet it's a mystery
[58:43] and i
[58:45] uh preaching on the funeral or i don't
[58:47] like to talk too much about the
[58:48] resurrection to your phone and your wood
[58:49] body and things that you know i mean i
[58:51] don't really like to go too much deer
[58:53] because it's good it's the word and
[58:55] everything else but
[58:56] i want to
[58:58] not give him a good send off give you a
[58:59] good send off
[59:01] because we're not here to send him off
[59:03] he's off already
[59:06] it's how you're going to spend
[59:07] the rest of your years
[59:10] and what will be the tale toll of you
[59:13] you know i understand somebody came to
[59:14] the funeral one time and when they
[59:15] started talk about the person somebody
[59:17] get up to look in the box see the right
[59:19] funeral
[59:21] because what they were saying and the
[59:23] person in the box is two different
[59:24] things
[59:26] this is not the case here
[59:28] what they are saying and the person in
[59:30] the box is what you heard about
[59:33] we spent our years
[59:34] as a tale
[59:36] that is told
[59:41] today
[59:43] you hear the word change a lot new
[59:46] normal
[59:47] things changing
[59:49] and everything else
[59:51] but there are things that happen in our
[59:53] lives
[59:54] that change us forever
[59:56] this is one of them
[59:59] and debt have a way of
[1:00:02] sobering drunk men
[1:00:05] that have a way of reminding you your
[1:00:07] money care
[1:00:09] hold that you know i mean don't call me
[1:00:11] number yet
[1:00:13] you can't do that
[1:00:15] you can't bribe
[1:00:16] you can't say not yet
[1:00:18] would have said boundaries we
[1:00:20] cannot cross
[1:00:22] the loss of a loved one nobody could
[1:00:24] explain away
[1:00:26] already explain how someone feels
[1:00:29] it's a loss
[1:00:30] if you've never had a debt in your life
[1:00:32] you don't know what it is for somebody
[1:00:33] to grieve i've lost a husband a wife a
[1:00:36] son a daughter you don't know
[1:00:39] but we sorrow but not as them who have
[1:00:42] no hope
[1:00:43] we sorrow
[1:00:45] we're not going to smile like if it's a
[1:00:46] party or dance we sorrow we feel it but
[1:00:49] not of them who have no hope
[1:00:52] hallelujah
[1:00:53] praise the name of the lord
[1:00:56] and with this in mind how much it will
[1:00:59] take
[1:01:00] how much time it will take
[1:01:03] to say i'm sorry
[1:01:06] forgive me
[1:01:07] i didn't mean to hurt you i
[1:01:11] i am wrong
[1:01:12] how much time it will take to make
[1:01:14] things right
[1:01:16] we spend our years
[1:01:18] as a tale
[1:01:20] that is told
[1:01:22] all within the context of three score
[1:01:24] and 10.
[1:01:26] bible called 40 as a generation when i
[1:01:28] was blessed to read 70
[1:01:30] and after you pass 70 you know you're
[1:01:32] only overdrive over time you're getting
[1:01:34] extra blessed
[1:01:35] you have no guarantee
[1:01:37] so if you over 70 you better ball
[1:01:39] hallelujah hallelujah which we're gonna
[1:01:40] live in right through
[1:01:42] i'm telling you
[1:01:44] it's scary you know quite heading down
[1:01:46] there
[1:01:48] and i wish i could hold back the clock
[1:01:51] what time of a way of just ticking
[1:01:52] thicken thicken your vex is still taken
[1:01:57] you get angry it's still ticking you're
[1:01:59] upset it thickens still
[1:02:01] i ain't talking to you it's still taken
[1:02:04] time going time going time going
[1:02:06] that's how it is
[1:02:09] job 14 5
[1:02:11] seeing his days are determined
[1:02:15] the number of his months are with thee
[1:02:18] that was a point in his bongs that he
[1:02:21] cannot pass
[1:02:23] since a man days are already determined
[1:02:26] and the number of his months is holding
[1:02:29] your control and he cannot pass the
[1:02:31] bounds of his allotted time
[1:02:33] we are trapped in the time under the law
[1:02:37] of ezekiel
[1:02:39] 3 2 a time to be born
[1:02:41] in a time to die heard a woman give a
[1:02:43] story one time of death coming from
[1:02:44] somebody
[1:02:46] and every time people running scared but
[1:02:47] this person is had a treat that nice
[1:02:50] that knock on the door big hook sticks
[1:02:52] story

[1:02:58] and he feels that comfort you know but
[1:02:59] it's
[1:03:00] nice see if we could keep off that
[1:03:03] so he went upstairs and see and he
[1:03:05] cooked stick
[1:03:07] name on the top
[1:03:09] while that was sleeping that's how go
[1:03:10] and take a rest
[1:03:12] and he take and he raised his name from
[1:03:13] on top and put at the bottom
[1:03:16] and when that wake up they'd say oh gosh
[1:03:18] you're treating me so nice i already
[1:03:19] come for you you know
[1:03:21] but i went started at the top poke start
[1:03:22] at the bottom
[1:03:27] the boundaries are said that you
[1:03:30] cannot
[1:03:31] pass to everything
[1:03:33] there's a season of time to every
[1:03:35] purpose of him

[1:03:44] my culture stand up the great prince
[1:03:46] which standed for the churn of thy
[1:03:48] people and there shall be a time of
[1:03:49] trouble such as never was since there
[1:03:51] was nation even at that same time at
[1:03:53] that time that people shall be delivered
[1:03:55] oh everyone that shall be found
[1:03:57] written in
[1:03:59] the book
[1:04:00] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[1:04:02] the earth shall awake
[1:04:04] some to everlasting life
[1:04:06] some to shame everlasting contempt and
[1:04:09] they that be wise shall shine as the
[1:04:11] brightness of the filament and leader to
[1:04:13] maintain righteousness as the stars
[1:04:15] forever and ever but dull down you'll
[1:04:17] shut up the words seal the book even to
[1:04:19] the time of the end though many shall
[1:04:21] run to and through knowledge shall be
[1:04:23] increased
[1:04:24] names written in this book teach us a
[1:04:27] number of days teach us the number of
[1:04:29] days
[1:04:30] that we apply
[1:04:32] our hearts to wisdom wisdom because
[1:04:34] right now you are caught on it
[1:04:36] in time
[1:04:37] between heaven and hell angels
[1:04:41] and demons
[1:04:43] caught between a pull from above and are
[1:04:45] pulled from below
[1:04:46] an earth caught
[1:04:48] above a tree four dimension firstly of
[1:04:50] saved souls
[1:04:51] secondly of angels and turd of god
[1:04:53] himself
[1:04:54] on earth you're caught
[1:04:56] below a threefold dimension of lost
[1:04:59] souls
[1:05:00] than demons than satan himself
[1:05:03] and you are given the opportunity for a
[1:05:05] changed life
[1:05:06] an opportunity to repent
[1:05:08] to repentance to change to turn to feel
[1:05:11] or express sincere regret remorse for
[1:05:13] one's wrongdoing or sin
[1:05:16] a couple of weeks before he passed
[1:05:19] but the clients
[1:05:21] drop across some equipment for me
[1:05:23] he used to turn the vhs the dvd and
[1:05:26] stuff
[1:05:27] and he told me by the night
[1:05:29] you know all the things he loved and i
[1:05:31] know he he loves his gadgets
[1:05:33] if it's one thing i can't separate him
[1:05:34] from his gadget his things
[1:05:36] he said but you say all the desire for
[1:05:39] those things are gone
[1:05:41] you see brother nice was
[1:05:43] emptiness backpack
[1:05:46] yeah
[1:05:47] yeah we we have a lot of things on our
[1:05:49] back
[1:05:51] are we packing up more things
[1:05:53] we're loading up
[1:05:54] where you're going with that
[1:05:56] you can carry that with you
[1:05:58] so you tell me he lost
[1:06:00] the desire
[1:06:01] for all those things
[1:06:04] and it struck me it's not age sometimes
[1:06:06] change people know
[1:06:08] but it's pain
[1:06:10] and suffering
[1:06:12] let me say that again
[1:06:14] not age
[1:06:16] but pain and suffering you see all them
[1:06:18] catch phrases too blessed to be stressed
[1:06:20] take that out
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:22] jesus the bible said learn obedience by
[1:06:25] the things that he suffered
[1:06:26] nobody wants to suffer
[1:06:29] i was
[1:06:30] really
[1:06:31] believing god for him to be delivered
[1:06:33] out of
[1:06:34] his suffering because he was suffering
[1:06:37] i am glad for him because he is in a
[1:06:39] better place
[1:06:40] he's in a region of the blessed
[1:06:42] he's no longer in suffering and pain he
[1:06:44] no longer have gray hair and gray beard
[1:06:47] hallelujah he's back young again
[1:06:49] oh glory to god he's going on with the
[1:06:51] saints we've gone on before
[1:06:53] hallelujah is not wonderful
[1:06:56] this is our hope as christians
[1:06:58] not to establish down here but but in
[1:07:01] time and understanding that time is a
[1:07:04] kink in eternity
[1:07:06] oh glory to god and one day that king
[1:07:08] could be
[1:07:09] ironed out
[1:07:10] and it will be one day eternity oh glory
[1:07:13] to god this king called time that split
[1:07:16] up at years and months and weeks and
[1:07:18] days and hours and minutes and seconds
[1:07:20] it will be all over the angel already
[1:07:22] said time shall be no more time myself
[1:07:24] have to run out oh glory to god we are
[1:07:27] destined to a better place oh glory to
[1:07:30] god we're getting old for nothing we are
[1:07:32] dying for nothing his debt is not in
[1:07:34] vain there is going to be a resurrection
[1:07:36] because that is what jesus died for
[1:07:39] that's the hope of the gospel we shall
[1:07:41] no longer sleep but we shall be changed
[1:07:44] in a moment not thinking about this is
[1:07:46] my hope not for the pulpit but for our
[1:07:48] resurrection there is going to be a
[1:07:50] voice come down there
[1:07:52] glory to god hallelujah
[1:07:55] thank you lord jesus
[1:07:56] that is why in acts 2 it said therefore
[1:07:59] let all the house of israel know
[1:08:00] assuredly that god had made that same
[1:08:02] jesus whom you have crucified but lord
[1:08:04] and christ the devil taught together
[1:08:06] kill them and keep them down and they
[1:08:07] kill him and oh god if they never only
[1:08:09] knew what was going to happen he let
[1:08:11] jesus or die of old age but when he shed
[1:08:14] his blood in calvary the spirit life of
[1:08:17] that blood was loosed and that it was
[1:08:19] caught for the night the spirit life
[1:08:21] from that blood oh glory to god when
[1:08:24] that spirit life is loose no demon could
[1:08:26] stop you nothing present nothing to come
[1:08:28] no sickness nothing going to stop you
[1:08:30] from rising again all glory to god is
[1:08:32] easy to go along on the ground but
[1:08:34] there's something else to come back up
[1:08:36] it will take a power it will take a
[1:08:37] presence it will take a born again
[1:08:39] baptism of the holy ghost to put fire
[1:08:41] into your soul to raise you up in spirit
[1:08:44] and faith we have something to live for
[1:08:47] all you young people you have something
[1:08:48] to live for grandchildren of the night
[1:08:50] you have something to live for live for
[1:08:52] jesus
[1:08:53] hallelujah or when peter was preaching
[1:08:55] when they were pricked in their heart
[1:08:57] and said unto peter unto the rest of the
[1:08:59] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[1:09:00] do then peter said to them repent and be
[1:09:03] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:09:05] jesus christ for the remission of your
[1:09:07] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:09:09] the holy ghost for the promises unto you
[1:09:11] and your children them that are found

[1:09:27] no we do
[1:09:28] we do but we have a hope
[1:09:31] we have a confidence
[1:09:32] hallelujah don't feel abraham didn't
[1:09:35] have rough spots something you know the
[1:09:36] bible said he staggered not on the
[1:09:38] promise that's when god writing
[1:09:40] man to see this and see that when ghosts
[1:09:42] are the righteous right different you
[1:09:43] know
[1:09:44] yeah man here false he had mistakes had
[1:09:47] this and that and that but when god
[1:09:48] writes is something else you know
[1:09:50] i want god to write i don't want man to
[1:09:52] write when god writes in the waiver he
[1:09:54] says staggered not at the prophet

[1:10:00] upset because the food didn't taste good
[1:10:01] but the bible said sarah abraham
[1:10:03] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:10:06] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:10:08] giving glory to god and he was fully
[1:10:11] persuaded that what he promised and i am
[1:10:13] fully persuaded this is the hour that
[1:10:15] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:10:17] there's going to be a rapture there's
[1:10:18] going to be a millennium and this gray
[1:10:20] hair will go back black

[1:10:45] house he was living in oh but he gone to
[1:10:48] a better place that's the place we are
[1:10:50] going to

[1:11:23] but change of heart change of life i'm
[1:11:27] gonna close
[1:11:29] when you die
[1:11:31] that does not change your spirit
[1:11:34] it only changes your dwelling place this
[1:11:35] is scary
[1:11:37] this is
[1:11:38] scary that doesn't change you
[1:11:42] it just changed where you are
[1:11:45] when you think about that if you're a
[1:11:47] liar here
[1:11:50] if you're crook here
[1:11:52] that will make you
[1:11:56] you're dying to get straight no you know
[1:11:59] this is the only place you'll be mortal

[1:12:08] things right
[1:12:09] here's the only place you could be
[1:12:10] change transformed straighten out humble

[1:12:18] crossover it's too late
[1:12:20] you're set
[1:12:21] and judge according to your works
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] hallelujah you can't give god your good
[1:12:27] works you know because the good words
[1:12:28] qualified she's not to die
[1:12:30] you have to have his life
[1:12:32] turned even inside of you
[1:12:34] so when you die it only changes houses
[1:12:37] for you if you die in your sins you go
[1:12:39] to a worse habitation of what you're
[1:12:41] living in now if you die in christ you
[1:12:43] shall be with christ for he is the way
[1:12:46] death does not change a man it changes
[1:12:48] your dwelling place when you leave this
[1:12:50] world your nature doesn't change if
[1:12:53] you're lying now you'll be a liar there
[1:12:54] if you're hotter than here you'll be hot
[1:12:55] every day if your daughter here you'll
[1:12:57] be adopted dear men and women it's time
[1:12:59] to shake yourself examine yourself see
[1:13:02] where we are standing for death does not
[1:13:04] change it that doesn't do nothing to a
[1:13:06] man but change is dwell in place it
[1:13:09] doesn't change your fate it doesn't
[1:13:11] change nothing in you but your dwelling
[1:13:14] place so whatever way your nature is
[1:13:16] today if you're a doubt of god's word
[1:13:18] you'll be doubt over there i don't care
[1:13:20] who you are how you live how good you
[1:13:21] live it wouldn't change you one bit to
[1:13:23] die just your dwelling place and if you
[1:13:26] can't accept the whole word of god the
[1:13:28] way it's written you wouldn't be there
[1:13:30] you wouldn't do it dear so don't worry
[1:13:31] you won't be there oh my let me wrap up
[1:13:34] here now
[1:13:36] sin will not go unpunished
[1:13:39] this is a result of sin
[1:13:41] the wages of sin is still dead the
[1:13:43] reason we're getting gray and old and
[1:13:45] sick and dying is because
[1:13:48] one man fell and sinned
[1:13:50] that is why when adam fell he
[1:13:53] represented all of us you say oh gosh
[1:13:56] why god could use this one man
[1:13:58] yes but when christ came he represented
[1:14:00] all of us too
[1:14:01] one man fell and we got messed up that
[1:14:04] is why we are funeral services one man
[1:14:07] came and now we could get back to where
[1:14:09] we fell from
[1:14:10] this is what the gospel is all about the
[1:14:12] gospel is not joining church
[1:14:14] the gospel is getting you back to eden
[1:14:17] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:14:20] so watch
[1:14:21] sin must be dealt with on the basis of
[1:14:24] judgment
[1:14:25] whether it's a nation
[1:14:26] a church a home an individual there is
[1:14:31] no other way it can be attorned you say
[1:14:33] i've done wrong now i will do good that
[1:14:35] won't work you cannot make
[1:14:37] reconciliation yourself because
[1:14:39] reconciliation has already been made
[1:14:41] it's a confession that you're wrong and
[1:14:43] then come and straighten up so sin must
[1:14:46] be dealt with and god always deal with
[1:14:48] sin by judgment
[1:14:50] that's his law
[1:14:51] so when he recognized man fell he say he
[1:14:53] cast an angel to do it he came himself
[1:14:56] because judgment is what he had was to
[1:14:59] take up so calvary was the judgment he
[1:15:02] judgment of god
[1:15:03] so he accepted all judgment
[1:15:06] at calvary that we could be the escaped
[1:15:08] ones that we could go free oh colleen
[1:15:10] will you believe that
[1:15:12] praise god so what that's why our lord
[1:15:14] died the death that he didn't calvary is
[1:15:16] because that sin was such a horrible
[1:15:18] thing begin to pay some things
[1:15:20] the judgment of sin was placed on him
[1:15:22] that those who desire might go free to
[1:15:24] believing on him and accepting him as
[1:15:26] their sin bearer
[1:15:28] not how good we can be
[1:15:29] but how we believe and accept him
[1:15:32] and when we accept him
[1:15:34] he comes into our hearts
[1:15:36] oh my god made a man to tooth because he
[1:15:40] wanted to taste after him but the devil
[1:15:42] perverted it he's trying to make you
[1:15:44] think something different trying to
[1:15:46] quench that holy taste
[1:15:48] oh man finish
[1:15:49] adam and eve fell by breaking the word
[1:15:52] the day you eat there of
[1:15:54] that day you surely die you know people
[1:15:55] ever say god is a good god all the time
