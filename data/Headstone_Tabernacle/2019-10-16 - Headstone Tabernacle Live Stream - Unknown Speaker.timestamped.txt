[20:26] inspiration tonight praise God we know
[20:29] that it's a sad situation when we go
[20:31] back in the Bible and we see what Samson
[20:34] went through amen and how he was
[20:37] deceived a man how he had given his
[20:39] heart to a woman a man he gave his
[20:41] strength to God but he gave his heart to
[20:43] a woman and he fell by that way is not
[20:45] right and he had to go through
[20:47] persecution and trial and he had to go
[20:50] through a lot of stuff he even lost his
[20:52] two eyes
[20:53] isn't that right praise God hallelujah
[20:56] but when the Bible wrote Samson's
[20:59] account it said by faith Samson overcame
[21:02] the Philistine
[21:03] praise God hallelujah even in his in his
[21:06] trial court still got the victory even

[21:19] praise God he might be going to a trial
[21:21] might be going through a test might be
[21:24] going to a shadow time holiday but
[21:26] that's courts finest hour that's when he
[21:29] shows himself alive by many infallible
[21:31] proofs and he is caught Almighty but he
[21:35] will not give up on his promise Oh

[32:25] the Bible said in that parody all

[32:33] thinking it's eternal but when that
[32:36] thought comes into expression you can't
[32:38] go back to being a fault anymore it's
[32:41] already come out then something's got to
[32:43] take place when that expression becomes
[32:46] a word when it is spoken the miraculous
[32:49] has got to take place because it's
[32:51] already spoken it's already been
[32:54] released God cannot take it back every
[32:58] word that he has spoken shall come to
[33:02] pass

[34:20] behind the scenes the enemy was using
[34:22] her to try to capture Samson that's a
[34:26] problem many things we find nice and
[34:28] look good and all that glitters is not
[34:30] gold because the devil sometimes uses
