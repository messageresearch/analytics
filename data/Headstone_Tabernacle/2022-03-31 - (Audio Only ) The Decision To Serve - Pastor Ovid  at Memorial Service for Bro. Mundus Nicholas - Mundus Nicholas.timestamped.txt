[9:47] in regards to this memorial service of
[9:50] brother mundus nicholas
[9:53] one that
[9:54] i'll walk among us
[9:56] and he's no longer there that our eyes
[9:58] can see
[10:00] but we know he lived
[10:02] and just as he was among us
[10:04] and he laughed and shared himself and
[10:07] talked and through and everything else
[10:09] and he's gone
[10:10] the same way that jesus was among us
[10:14] and he died
[10:15] but the difference is he rules from the
[10:16] dead and releases spirit
[10:20] that can have an effect upon our lives
[10:22] tonight is a special night i'm happy to
[10:24] be here i'm glad to be here i'm glad to
[10:26] see all of you out here tonight
[10:29] to honor such a precious soul and um
[10:32] tonight i have something
[10:34] that i believe that i i feel god put up
[10:36] on my heart to share with you tonight
[10:40] and
[10:40] the title i have tonight here is the
[10:42] decision to serve
[10:45] the decision to serve
[10:47] so i want to read a scripture
[10:49] from matthew chapter 25
[10:52] and reading from verse
[10:53] 14
[10:54] to 40. i'll let you sit down for this
[10:57] picture i want to read the whole thing
[10:59] jesus speaking
[11:01] he said for the kingdom of heaven is as
[11:03] a man
[11:04] traveling into a far country
[11:07] who called his own servants and
[11:08] delivered unto them his goods
[11:11] onto one he gave five talents
[11:13] to another two
[11:15] to another one
[11:16] to every man according to his several
[11:18] ability and straightway took his journey
[11:22] then
[11:23] he that received the five talents went
[11:25] and traded with the same
[11:26] and made them another five times
[11:29] likewise he had received two he also
[11:32] gained another two
[11:33] but he that received one
[11:35] went and in the earth and hid his
[11:37] lord's money
[11:39] after a long time
[11:41] note after a long time
[11:43] the lord of those servants commit
[11:46] and reckon it with them
[11:48] so all the talents and gifts that we
[11:50] have
[11:51] all the talents and gifts that god has
[11:53] given us
[11:54] there will come a day of recording
[11:57] of what we do with those gifts
[11:59] and talents
[12:01] and so when he had received okay
[12:04] and and so he that received five talents
[12:07] came and brought the other five times
[12:08] and said lord
[12:09] don't deliver us unto me five talents
[12:11] behold i've gained besides them five
[12:14] times more his lord said unto him
[12:17] well done thou good and faithful servant
[12:20] though i've been faithful over a few
[12:21] times
[12:22] i will make the ruler over many things
[12:25] enter into the joy
[12:27] of the lord
[12:29] he also that received two talents came
[12:31] and said lord
[12:32] don't deliver us unto me two talents
[12:34] behold i've gained two other talents
[12:37] beside them
[12:38] his lord said unto him well done good
[12:40] and faithful servant god's been faithful
[12:42] over a few things i will make you ruler
[12:45] over many things
[12:46] enter into the joy
[12:48] of the lord note
[12:50] here how god weighs and considers
[12:53] faithfulness
[12:54] not faithful to much yet
[12:57] but faithful to little
[12:59] so the little god gives to you and i
[13:02] he looks to see
[13:03] how he manages it if you can't manage
[13:06] ten dollars how do you manage i thought
[13:09] the camera is a thousand dollars every
[13:10] month a hundred thousand dollars
[13:12] if you can't manage that particular
[13:13] marriage ten million dollars
[13:15] so god looks to see
[13:17] the measure
[13:19] of faithfulness
[13:21] and the other day when i spoke about
[13:22] about putting away idols and um dog
[13:25] shall have another gods before me
[13:27] that is like floating
[13:29] calling god your lover calling god your
[13:31] husband and your fool along with other
[13:33] gods
[13:34] and he hates that because he i'm a
[13:36] jealous god even hell would i put you
[13:39] here i give you eyes mouth hands i give
[13:41] you life and you want to worship some
[13:43] other god
[13:44] even the god of your own imagination
[13:46] your own thoughts
[13:48] so then he that received the one talent
[13:51] came and said lord i i know thee that
[13:53] taught a hard man reaping veda has not
[13:55] sown
[13:56] gathering where thou has not straw
[13:58] and i was afraid and went and did i
[14:01] talented the earth look dear dog has
[14:04] that is nine so you know will this man
[14:06] get one i said lord look i have where
[14:08] you give me i i'll come and bring it
[14:10] back for you
[14:11] we're gonna make one look look one yes i
[14:13] keep it behind it i bury it i know your
[14:16] heart and look i'll bring that one
[14:18] listen to the lord's response his lord
[14:20] answered and said to him though wicked
[14:22] and full servant
[14:24] the newest i replay i should not and god
[14:27] that way i have been struggled the
[14:29] author is therefore to have put my money
[14:31] to the exchanges and then at my coming i
[14:33] should have received my own with usury
[14:36] which is like interest
[14:38] take therefore the talent from him so
[14:40] this man have won
[14:42] he presented to the lord one
[14:44] and god said what he has take it from
[14:47] him
[14:49] the one that he has
[14:50] says oh god poor one
[14:54] look at paul no ain't poor one you know
[14:55] god said take
[14:57] that one from him
[14:59] watch
[15:00] and give it unto him which are ten
[15:02] talents
[15:03] and then listen to this statement for
[15:05] everyone that had
[15:08] that
[15:09] for every one that had shall be given
[15:12] and he shall have an abundance
[15:14] from him that hath not shall be taken
[15:16] away even the that which he had
[15:19] and cassie the unprofitable servant into
[15:22] outer darkness there shall be weapon
[15:25] of teeth
[15:26] when the son of man here we go
[15:29] shall come in his glory
[15:31] and all the holy angels with him
[15:34] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[15:36] glory and before him shall be guarded
[15:38] all nations
[15:39] and he shall separate them one from
[15:41] another as a shepherd divided his sheep
[15:43] from the goats and he shall set the
[15:45] sheep on his right hand the goats on his
[15:47] left then shall the king see unto them
[15:51] on the right hand listen to these words
[15:53] ye blessed of my father
[15:55] inherit the kingdom
[15:58] prepared for you
[16:00] from the foundation of the world amen
[16:02] for i was hungry
[16:04] and you gave me meat
[16:06] i was thirsty and you gave me drink i
[16:09] was a stranger and you took me in
[16:12] naked and you closed me i was sick and
[16:16] he visited me i was in prison and you
[16:18] came unto me
[16:20] then shall the righteous answer and say
[16:22] no what
[16:24] when so we the hungered
[16:26] and fed or toasty or give the drink when
[16:29] so we a stranger and took me in or naked
[16:33] and clothed
[16:34] or when so we be sick and imprisoned
[16:37] came unto thee
[16:39] and the king shall answer and said unto
[16:41] them
[16:42] verily
[16:43] i say unto you
[16:45] in as much as you have done it unto one
[16:48] of the least of these my brethren
[16:50] you have done it unto me amen then shall
[16:53] you say unto them that on the left hand
[16:55] depart from me he cursed into
[16:58] everlasting fire
[17:00] prepare for the devil and his angels
[17:02] for i was hungered you gave me no meat
[17:04] i was thirsty you gave me no drink i was
[17:07] a stranger you took me not in naked you
[17:10] clothed me not sick and in prison you
[17:12] visited me now
[17:14] then shall they also answer him say
[17:17] when saw we thee a hunger than the
[17:20] thirst or stranger or naked or sick or
[17:22] in prison and did not minister to thee
[17:25] then shall we answer them saying verily
[17:27] unto you inasmuch as you have did it not
[17:30] to one of the least of these you did it
[17:33] not to me
[17:34] and these shall go away in the
[17:37] everlasting punishment
[17:39] and the righteous and the life
[17:41] eternal
[17:42] you can stand for this other scripture
[17:43] here you say stan this is some
[17:46] revelation chapter 20 dr finance i'll
[17:48] read it verse 11 to 15
[17:50] and i saw a great white throne
[17:52] and him that saturn it from whose face
[17:55] the earth and the heaven fled away and
[17:57] there was no place
[17:59] there was fungal please for them
[18:01] i saw the dead
[18:03] small and great stand before god
[18:06] so when you're dead you're done say hey
[18:08] no
[18:09] it has something called the second death
[18:11] every man evil man wicked man murderer
[18:14] man drug lord man that the police are
[18:16] holding catch
[18:17] and they're dead
[18:19] they still had a reason
[18:21] i saw the dead
[18:22] small
[18:23] and great stand before god
[18:26] and the books were open and another book
[18:28] was open which is the book of life
[18:31] and the dead were judged out of those
[18:33] things which were written in the books
[18:34] listen according to their words
[18:39] not even from the book
[18:41] but according to their works
[18:44] and you see give up the death which were
[18:46] in it
[18:48] and death and hell delivered up the dead
[18:50] which were in them
[18:53] you have dead people in debt and in hell
[18:56] and they had to come up to
[18:57] to face this judgment
[18:59] so people who think they escaped they
[19:01] still have to meet this god
[19:03] appreciation about tonight
[19:05] it's not a game
[19:06] it's not a show
[19:08] this is for real
[19:10] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[19:12] in it and death and hell delivered of
[19:14] the dead which were in them and they
[19:15] would judge every man according to their
[19:17] works again
[19:18] and death and hell were cast in the lake
[19:20] of fire this is the second death
[19:23] and whosoever was not found
[19:25] written in the book of life was cast
[19:28] into the lake of fact let's bow here
[19:29] toward the prayer heavenly father we so
[19:32] grateful to be here tonight we pray your
[19:34] blessing upon us among us and our family
[19:36] whole household and bless the garden of
[19:38] the believers here tonight and given
[19:40] honor and respect to our brother who has
[19:42] wanted to be with you jesus and lord i
[19:45] could see you say enter into the joys of
[19:47] the lord for he truly did serve and i
[19:49] pray tonight that the few words would
[19:51] still the people's heart that they would
[19:53] look at themselves as a mirror of the
[19:56] word and see where they stand in this
[19:58] fate granted lord in jesus might ask
[20:01] amen you may be seated thanks again for
[20:03] coming we certainly appreciate
[20:05] all of you being here
[20:07] tonight
[20:09] so the title as i told you is
[20:12] the decision to serve
[20:14] another few comments here uh
[20:20] decision to serve
[20:22] it's a choice
[20:24] you have to choose
[20:26] there are only two masters god
[20:29] or the devil
[20:31] it is up to you
[20:33] whom you would serve
[20:35] but among us nicholas
[20:37] was a servant
[20:40] and i have a question to ask tonight
[20:43] do you think
[20:45] that you can serve god
[20:47] without serving others
[20:50] i want your way that taught tonight
[20:53] do you think
[20:55] you could serve god
[20:58] without serving others
[21:00] you see many people are religious
[21:03] not spiritual
[21:05] religious could make you feel
[21:08] you could bring me accountable you could
[21:10] do whatever you want to do and you're
[21:11] serving the lord and you're not serving
[21:12] anybody
[21:14] but jesus said
[21:17] i was sick and you visited me
[21:19] i hungered and you fed me
[21:22] he said these things
[21:24] so to me it is impossible
[21:27] to claim to serve god
[21:29] and you don't have a channel that you
[21:32] could serve
[21:33] but amanda's served
[21:35] and he served well
[21:37] he didn't sell for money
[21:39] he didn't save for pay for fame he
[21:41] didn't save for photographs on instagram
[21:44] he didn't serve to please anybody
[21:47] he's still because he loved god
[21:49] he served god people whether people
[21:51] painted or not he will paint
[21:52] i remember when we were plants in the
[21:54] building before we could even finish
[21:55] complete plaster a brush coming from
[22:07] and i challenge you tonight that is
[22:09] impossible for you to claim to be
[22:11] serving god and you can't serve others
[22:13] because perfect eternal life is living
[22:16] for others
[22:17] hallelujah
[22:18] that is what this is about
[22:20] and the servants because that's what we
[22:22] are here for
[22:23] not to be lord over anybody
[22:25] but the silver
[22:27] oh you think about that as soon as
[22:29] somebody get too carpet two days two
[22:30] days two days they'll talk somebody then
[22:32] support the car and you see something
[22:34] kind of thing like that then they up
[22:36] someday and you watch them show up and
[22:37] you're waiting till they'll come down
[22:39] because it's coming after a while
[22:41] i watch it over the years see people
[22:44] climb into power
[22:45] take power assume power pretend they are
[22:48] power and all
[22:50] and afterwards see them come down from
[22:51] the stairs hitting the up and same one
[22:53] by one they're coming down
[22:57] and you ask yourself the question
[22:59] was it worth it
[23:02] i remember i work in schools and so on
[23:04] and i heard a young boy sing i want
[23:07] a young student he said i want to be a
[23:09] drug lord
[23:10] i would say
[23:12] really
[23:12] i overheard the conversation i said why
[23:14] what that is it doesn't have plenty
[23:15] money i see the dead young you know
[23:20] i see you never saw this young guy i was
[23:22] there young i watch my soul
[23:24] so he sees what people looking at
[23:27] but jesus gave the answer here
[23:29] i was sick and he visited me the other
[23:31] so he said get away he said he said
[23:34] when it is that he was sick when we
[23:36] didn't bring it he said but you didn't
[23:37] do it to none of them
[23:39] because they've done it until the little
[23:41] ones you've done it until
[23:43] so you cannot really serve god without
[23:47] serving others
[23:48] i want to bring the thought of being a
[23:51] silver
[23:53] because the servants there is a welcome
[23:56] enter into the joys of the lord
[24:00] you know people let's do like every
[24:01] funeral service everybody going down you
[24:04] know
[24:05] that's not true you know
[24:06] that is a lie
[24:08] let me say it again
[24:09] every service whether it's baptist
[24:11] catholic methodist joe witness hindu
[24:14] muslim any everybody think that people
[24:16] dead once a day going to heaven
[24:18] the bible
[24:22] adam
[24:23] without smoke cigarette woman money
[24:26] liquor whiskey
[24:28] he died
[24:30] because god said did they you eat
[24:32] thereof that did you die
[24:34] i wish we could take god just what he
[24:36] said
[24:37] because god has kept his word we just
[24:39] talk this kind of thought because he's a
[24:40] good god every time we're doing the
[24:42] wrong thing and we've got every time
[24:43] you're judging
[24:45] he killed two million people in
[24:47] the after he brought them out to them
[24:49] you got what i said
[24:51] 400 years then bondage he bring them
[24:53] without killing them
[24:55] they perished you know when they're on
[24:56] after their children
[24:58] the proof is kind of lying
[25:00] because you say your people your people
[25:02] in other words when your fathers fail
[25:04] you let the next generation get a chance
[25:06] so god has no time to waste you know
[25:08] moses myself and he's dead joshua take
[25:09] over what happened
[25:16] joshua take over if these people don't
[25:18] want to take my word i'm going to raise
[25:20] up another generation
[25:23] hallelujah
[25:24] that is what god does never see a fake
[25:30] you know what i said

[28:10] jesus
[28:11] demonstrated my feet washing
[28:14] listen
[28:15] the way
[28:17] we ought to serve one another
[28:19] jesus christ come you take a clot and he
[28:22] started to wash the feet peter you see
[28:24] peter yeah
[28:26] yeah
[28:27] jesus you know he said
[28:32] he want more than watch people
[28:34] and then jesus demonstrated them
[28:37] how to serve
[28:39] how to wash down their feet now
[28:41] understand this we do feed washington
[28:42] church but you know that is people with
[28:45] feet that have socks in it and the day
[28:48] before they come to church we assume
[28:49] that they had a good bath and they wash
[28:51] their feet and so on like that and you
[28:53] wash clean feet but when you really
[28:55] think about it in jesus time it didn't
[28:58] have maxi taxi and didn't have socks i
[29:00] don't think jesus wears socks maybe he
[29:02] didn't invent socks that time so was
[29:05] sanders a lot of cow dung on the road
[29:06] and donkey yeah maxi so when you're
[29:09] walking is a set of mess and dust and in
[29:11] africa i uh was a hotel one time and hey
[29:15] i said what is that when i open the
[29:17] window is because them fellas have some
[29:19] two sick ones
[29:20] and you know what that was
[29:22] all the sideways is moderates so when
[29:24] you come out you gotta change your shoes
[29:25] and then your shoes muddy and your
[29:27] tucked up and then clean your shoes so
[29:28] then there's shoe shining boys out there
[29:31] and there's a whole business out there
[29:32] so jesus disciples walk in the street
[29:36] foot dusty and everything else and when
[29:38] you come and wash feet because that is
[29:39] what you do when you have a function
[29:41] that's almighty wash your feet before
[29:43] coming in amen yeah come here with the
[29:45] nasty feet of the defeat yeah they get
[29:47] washed there in front of jesus show that
[29:50] that was the lowest job
[29:52] a feet washing flunky and jesus took up
[29:55] that roll to wash their feet and say
[29:58] what 100 feet
[29:59] and by this and all men know that you
[30:01] are my disciples so you can have private
[30:04] christianity you have i am exhibit
[30:06] nobody no i love the lord your love no
[30:08] lord if you love the lord it will obey
[30:10] what god said
[30:12] to save the lord you have to save others
[30:15] to save the lord you have to love others
[30:17] to save the lord you have to treat your
[30:19] enemy right treat your family right
[30:22] treat the people around your right
[30:23] because they can't live with them here
[30:25] trouble will be up there and haven't
[30:27] even had that trouble so you'll go to
[30:29] the other side and have sheep they have
[30:31] goats you have to examine which one you
[30:33] belong to or give the lord some praises
[30:36] tonight
[30:37] it was placed upon me to share this with
[30:39] you because brother mundus was a genuine
[30:42] servant
[30:43] you didn't beg him to save he'll have
[30:45] your corpse in the serve he had to call
[30:47] him to cut grass or paint or do anything
[30:49] they'll never wonder of course come now
[30:52] come now never he coming in front of you
[30:55] he coming ahead of you when you say so
[30:57] much that time he confronted you because
[30:59] that was in his heart
[31:01] hallelujah that is what we need to see
[31:03] genuine servants and when you cross over
[31:06] yonder the lord can say enter into the
[31:08] joys of the lord god good and faithful
[31:11] savage
[31:12] who are you servant today there are only
[31:14] two masters is either the lord or the
[31:16] devil
[31:19] let's continue
[31:21] mark 10
[31:23] 42-45
[31:25] and jesus called them to him
[31:27] and say it unto them
[31:29] this is jesus
[31:31] speaking to his disciples listen to
[31:33] these words
[31:34] he said you know that they which are
[31:36] accounted to rule over the gentiles
[31:39] exercise lordship over them
[31:42] and their great ones exercise authority
[31:45] upon them
[31:46] and so shall it not be among you
[31:49] but whosoever will be great among you
[31:52] shall be your minister
[31:54] and whosoever of you will be the chief
[31:58] shall be servant of all
[32:01] wow
[32:04] you mean
[32:05] not not somebody opening your cargo
[32:06] because you are a celebrity no no no he
[32:09] that is the chieftain of the servant of
[32:11] all for even
[32:13] here's how he's comparing now even the
[32:16] son of man
[32:17] came not to be ministered unto
[32:20] but to minister
[32:21] and to give his life a ransom for men
[32:24] so he's saying that i came to serve yes
[32:26] amen
[32:37] jesus called them to him and said to
[32:38] them you know
[32:40] that those who are recognized as
[32:42] governing and are supposed to rule the
[32:44] gentiles and nations lord it over them
[32:47] ruling with absolute power
[32:50] holding them in subjection
[32:52] and their great men exercise authority
[32:54] and dominion over them but this is not
[32:57] to be so among you
[33:00] instead whosoever desires to be great
[33:02] among you must be your servant amen
[33:07] you want water
[33:10] see what is the tree in them
[33:13] you want chicken or your one
[33:16] fish
[33:18] you want some more juice
[33:21] [Music]
[33:23] who doing that the great ones
[33:28] let's continue
[33:31] this is not to be so among you instead
[33:34] whosoever desires to be great among you
[33:36] must be your servant and whosoever
[33:39] wishes to be most important first in
[33:42] rank among you must be slave to all
[33:45] for even the summer man came
[33:47] not to have service remember to him but
[33:50] to save and to give his life
[33:54] as a ransom
[33:56] for many
[33:57] my thought tonight is the decision to
[34:00] serve
[34:01] maybe you never thought of it
[34:03] maybe you never asked me the question
[34:05] how can i serve
[34:06] in god's kingdom
[34:10] do you know
[34:11] sometimes when you ask for help or
[34:13] volunteer or something like that you
[34:15] know who will raise their hands
[34:17] these are people who automatically you
[34:19] know what's inside their hand
[34:22] but you could write down the name who
[34:23] will be there
[34:26] and there are some
[34:28] who one may be frozen
[34:31] or their hands
[34:33] i don't know
[34:35] but
[34:36] they don't have
[34:38] the inclination to have an interest
[34:41] can i help is there anything i could
[34:43] help
[34:45] is there anything i can help with
[34:46] tonight
[34:48] i come here
[34:50] to serve me me myself when i saw this
[34:53] when i when it came to me i mean i
[34:55] wasn't thinking i i was wondering what
[34:58] to say and always sort of try to look to
[35:00] the lord as to what to share with his
[35:01] people and this being such a special
[35:03] night in honoring and looking at the
[35:06] life of brother nicholas mundus monastic
[35:08] and there's thinking about it then it
[35:10] came to me about the decision to serve
[35:12] then i began to see him as a servant how
[35:15] we save god's people and and didn't say
[35:17] that you know some of yourself grumpy
[35:26] they want me to do it
[35:28] and
[35:31] he wasn't like that
[35:32] he had a joy
[35:34] sometime when i come down for this
[35:35] preaching he you don't know what to say
[35:38] he just watched them they smile i just
[35:40] laugh no words come with his mouth he is
[35:43] so enjoying the lord enjoying the word
[35:46] it was something else to behold you know
[35:48] him on the smile
[35:49] hallelujah just demon
[35:52] you don't know what to say
[35:54] you haven't just shake is it you don't
[35:55] know what to say
[35:56] but the joy was dead to save the lord
[35:59] and this is how god wants you to silver
[36:02] with joy the bible says rejoice ever
[36:04] more of course we have pressure who
[36:06] doesn't have pressure who doesn't have
[36:08] issues and challenges of course but the
[36:10] joy of the lord is your strength
[36:13] this is what you're living for you're
[36:15] not living for
[36:16] you
[36:17] here not living for new things because
[36:20] afterwards you're here might drop off
[36:22] you pom poms may not go on it
[36:24] praise god you're living for god you're
[36:26] looking for jesus you're not living
[36:28] because you're young because it will get
[36:29] all through and the greatest thing on
[36:32] this head will come on yours sometime in
[36:34] the future
[36:35] oh glory to god hallelujah so some point
[36:38] in time it had to hit that your life is
[36:40] on purpose and if god put you here the
[36:43] best thing you could do is to serve him
[36:45] with all your mind with all your heart
[36:47] with all your soul with all your
[36:49] strength
[36:51] glory to god
[36:52] and love your neighbor as you love
[36:54] yourself could we give you some praises
[36:56] tonight
[36:57] what the holy spirit is here tonight
[36:59] thanks for coming hallelujah praise god
[37:02] amen
[37:03] hallelujah
[37:05] listen to this one galatians 5 13 to 14
[37:08] for brethren you have been called under
[37:10] liberty only use not liberty for an
[37:13] occasion of the flesh but by love save
[37:15] one another for all the law is fulfilled
[37:18] in one word even this thou shall love
[37:21] thy neighbor
[37:23] as thyself
[37:24] so this is good for the adventists who
[37:26] love the law and so on summarizing one
[37:28] word thou shall love
[37:31] thy neighbor as thyself listen to the
[37:33] amplified of this for you brethren we're
[37:35] indeed called to freedom only do not let
[37:38] your freedom be an incentive to your
[37:40] flesh and an opportunity or excuse for
[37:43] selfishness
[37:44] you see because the opposite of servant
[37:46] is selfish
[37:47] you thinking about you only about you
[37:51] you always talk about
[37:52] you know venturing small they love one
[37:54] another
[37:55] and whatnot
[37:56] when please please
[38:13] and all of a sudden all the sibling love
[38:16] just disappeared because things come
[38:18] into view
[38:20] oh my but jesus said here watch
[38:23] what he said don't that excuse for
[38:26] selfishness but true love you should
[38:28] save one another for the whole law
[38:30] concerning human relationships is
[38:32] complied with this one precept you
[38:35] should love
[38:36] your neighbor as you do yourself amen
[38:40] if you don't love yourself you have
[38:41] problems
[38:42] yeah yeah issues to love your neighbor
[38:44] because you have excuse issues
[38:45] we're dealing with you
[38:47] are nice we had to leave with us
[38:50] to deal with that that you have to feel
[38:52] a healthy way about yourself that you
[38:54] could appreciate and value others
[38:56] and instead of saying i love your dress
[38:59] i appreciate you you know what and call
[39:00] your mother you're looking at your
[39:02] dresses
[39:05] that will look better on me yeah you'll
[39:07] get away from all of that because what
[39:09] you love you're trying to encourage you
[39:11] want the support you want to lift up you
[39:13] see somebody in a hole you want to bring
[39:15] them up you know it's aha looks down
[39:17] there or looking down there no pull them
[39:20] up encourage them and i feel if
[39:22] are wrong keep want you
[39:24] all as the family to encourage one
[39:26] another support one another somebody in
[39:28] the hall bring them all they don't want
[39:30] to talk talk to them don't say i ain't
[39:32] talking to him because you're talking to
[39:34] me no
[39:36] can you do that
[39:37] i'm in my muscles nobody just fall
[39:40] does nobody call you i said do you call
[39:42] anybody she said no
[39:47] you want something but you're not going
[39:50] to give anything
[39:53] philippians 2 3 8 says let nothing be
[39:56] done to strife
[39:57] or vainglory but in loneliness of mind
[40:00] seize the attitude let each esteem other
[40:02] better than themselves could you do that
[40:05] to see somebody better than you or do
[40:07] you have to be the best
[40:09] look in the mirror and say am i not
[40:10] beautiful
[40:11] think again
[40:14] think again
[40:16] look not every man on his own things but
[40:18] every man also the things of others
[40:21] you're looking out for your brother
[40:22] you're looking out for your sister you
[40:24] know water and come for three four days
[40:26] and your neighbor getting problems with
[40:27] water you have an extra kettle though
[40:29] give them
[40:31] share with them oh that would hurt
[40:33] some the long time people are saying
[40:35] good morning normal no no people not
[40:36] even saying good morning
[40:40] good morning
[40:42] that give me that pain you don't lose
[40:44] money if it's a good morning
[40:45] you lose your inheritance if you say
[40:47] good morning
[40:48] sometimes you light up somebody with a
[40:49] smile
[40:50] you can see her instead of walking
[40:52] around with a hard face you don't nobody
[40:53] tell you anything but smile on them
[40:56] that's my idea
[40:58] you make somebody feel good
[41:00] somebody's smiling
[41:02] you don't know what hole in what
[41:04] depression in and they see somebody
[41:06] getting a good spam come on we can do
[41:08] better than that
[41:09] or give the lord some praises
[41:12] hallelujah let not every man on his own
[41:14] things but every man also receives of
[41:16] others let this other say that there's a
[41:19] man in england my wife brought some
[41:20] attention that green pumpkins
[41:22] and he win a lot of pumpkin awards
[41:26] and um
[41:27] you know how they do it gigantic black
[41:29] guys and weighing so much and so on and
[41:31] he wins and so on you know what he did
[41:33] he
[41:34] ended up
[41:35] giving
[41:36] the neighbors a wrong all who planted
[41:38] the farmers the pumpkin seeds he had
[41:41] because he don't want them
[41:44] coco pumpkin
[41:48] come and
[41:50] pollinate with his pumpkin
[41:52] and and and lower the level of standard
[41:54] of his pumpkin
[41:55] so what he did he said yeah what i have
[41:57] great pumpkin look
[41:59] look you know some people say i know the
[42:01] formula don't don't go
[42:03] don't make your burger like my burger
[42:05] don't look at my sandwich i'm not gonna
[42:06] tell you the secret of my sandwich no
[42:08] this man shared his stuff
[42:10] and when he shared it everybody could
[42:12] grow and whatnot they could compete but
[42:14] he know he has other secret stuff that
[42:17] maybe he put in inside the ground i
[42:18] don't know but he makes sure he share
[42:22] you know what he does he's trying to
[42:23] keep his standard
[42:25] and that's what we have to do
[42:27] praise god if you don't share you don't
[42:29] come like them businessmen all the time
[42:31] they're making all their money and
[42:32] they're keeping salaries low and whatnot

[43:18] not robbie to be equal with god but made
[43:20] himself of no reputation
[43:22] but
[43:23] and took upon him the form of a servant
[43:26] and made of the likeness of men and
[43:28] being found in the fashion as a man he
[43:31] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[43:33] death even the death of the cross

[44:51] to run over
[44:53] god wants you to have an abundance
[44:55] in so much that you could bless others
[44:58] come and say a bigger amen than that
[45:01] [Applause]
[45:15] god wants to lift you up
[45:17] now listen if you don't believe that it
[45:18] wouldn't happen to you you know
[45:20] you have to believe that god wants to
[45:22] set you up as a light on a hill lord
[45:25] want this home here to be like a light
[45:28] in marawi
[45:30] and god want the individuals in this
[45:32] house to be like lights in maraval
[45:35] when ma is that they must say you know
[45:37] what what like go down by diana and them
[45:40] they have light down there they have
[45:42] christians down there it happens leave
[45:44] us down there we got people that believe
[45:46] god down there okay the lord some
[45:48] praises god wants your lies to be alive
[45:51] if it didn't know that tonight no you
[45:53] know that stop hiding stop talking stop
[45:56] popping and weaving god wants your life
[45:58] to be alike
[46:00] why that they could see your good works
[46:03] not bad was good words hallelujah and
[46:05] glorify god in heaven
[46:07] oh my
[46:08] god look at that
[46:10] final scripture
[46:12] mach 9
[46:15] verse 33
[46:17] and he came to capernaum and being in
[46:19] the house he asked them
[46:21] so what happened jesus saw this is
[46:23] grumbling among themselves
[46:24] and he wants to know what's going on
[46:26] with them said isn't it he said what was
[46:28] it that you disputed among yourselves by
[46:30] the way they're always arguing about
[46:33] but they have their peace for by the way
[46:36] they are disputed among themselves who
[46:37] should be degraded
[46:39] that was the argument
[46:41] that position
[46:43] do you agree
[46:45] jesus shake my hand longer than yours
[46:49] you reckon jesus called me often
[46:54] did jesus
[47:02] and he sat down
[47:04] and
[47:06] called the twelve and sent to them is
[47:08] any man
[47:10] desires to be first
[47:12] i know that wrong is that you know
[47:14] that's fine one of these words
[47:17] if any man denied the first the same
[47:19] shall be last of all
[47:22] and servant of allah
[47:25] amen
[47:26] hallelujah
[47:27] so jesus cancelled the whole argument
[47:29] you know what
[47:30] no wrong problem only first of all but
[47:32] in my program in my kingdom the first
[47:35] question to save
[47:37] so stop you know the bible talk about
[47:39] when you're invited to a place
[47:41] don't go and take the first cheated seat
[47:43] you see a secret gold lining on it and
[47:45] different things the one sitting on it
[47:47] and you think that your seat they say
[47:49] because there's somebody more honorable
[47:51] than you come you have to take you from
[47:53] this excuse me um could you move a
[47:55] little
[47:56] lower down because you know who come in
[47:58] here the prime minister or some or
[48:00] somebody coming the first man coming or
[48:01] the first lady coming to sit there so
[48:04] you say here what to do take the lowest
[48:05] seat first
[48:06] and then let them take you and say come
[48:08] here this is cetera take the lowest seat
[48:12] so don't hide the biggest sandwich
[48:16] don't do that
[48:17] and figure that what you're supposed to
[48:19] get
[48:20] don't do that
[48:22] so jesus he's teaching these principles
[48:24] of servanthood
[48:26] servitude
[48:27] how do we serve to me it's a decision
[48:32] you have to want to sing
[48:34] not for reward you should be scratching
[48:36] my back i will scratch yours somebody
[48:38] starts scratching your back because i
[48:38] know i mean my back is crashed
[48:41] so you have a business silver you
[48:43] serving under business deals
[48:45] see but that's all jesus wanted so i
[48:48] trust tonight these few words
[48:50] would resonate with you
[48:52] how much god wants us to be as silvers
[48:56] you can't be wrong seven i will close
[48:59] with this
[49:00] god call lord abraham
[49:02] and abraham out of his own country and
[49:05] so on again his family came along a lot
[49:08] abraham got blessed his cup ran over and
[49:11] it fell on a lot and his flocks and
[49:13] animals and everything else
[49:15] the husband unlocked with men and iran
[49:18] women started having disputes and
[49:19] arguments and so fight another clean
[49:21] thing
[49:22] so abraham called up aside and said look
[49:24] here what we are brethren you know let's
[49:27] not have any fights
[49:28] you go left i go right you go not i go
[49:30] south where you choose wherever you
[49:32] wanna go go
[49:33] when not look around so you look in his
[49:34] eyes now
[49:36] look towards sodom
[49:37] because some of them have water
[49:39] and planes and everything else and it's
[49:42] like going down one way that's fine i go
[49:43] anywhere
[49:44] desert wilderness
[49:46] and when abraham stepped away from allah
[49:48] god tells abraham look east best
[49:50] movements of all his others
[49:53] so see what is yours nobody could think
[49:56] what is yours is reserved for you
[49:59] but you have to believe what is yours
[50:02] and what is yours is what god has
[50:04] revealed to you as yours
[50:06] so you need to get in contact with god
[50:07] to reveal what is yours so when you see
[50:10] what is yours you didn't jealous anybody
[50:12] envy anybody want what somebody else
[50:15] have because you know assuredly he will
[50:18] give you what is yours
[50:20] praise the name of the lord let's bow
[50:22] our heads tonight
[50:25] heavenly father i thank you to be here
[50:27] and i pray god that your presence would
[50:29] saturate
[50:30] the lives of
[50:32] these people here
[50:35] we honor
[50:36] the memory of what amanda's as a servant
[50:39] of yours
[50:40] who serve the saints
[50:42] who supports people
[50:44] who serve his family he's always doing
[50:47] something
[50:48] always have a vision to do this
[50:50] and to do that never lazy
[50:52] never slept never thoughtful
[50:55] just being business-like
[50:57] we could look and see where he added
[50:59] lord he didn't take that one talent and
[51:01] buried it
[51:02] no
[51:04] he multiplied it
[51:05] and now we have a productive family
[51:08] that is blessed by you
[51:10] father we pray you're under your word
[51:11] amongst them
[51:12] when any in sick healing
[51:15] and he's dying and all lift them up are
[51:17] you struggling raise them up sitting
[51:18] restore them do something special for
[51:21] them and most of all may your hand of
[51:23] protection be upon them in this evil day
[51:26] bless these precious believers and
[51:27] saints and guests that are here
[51:29] may you honor their fate
[51:32] in receiving what was spoken because one
[51:34] day we all will have a recognition with
[51:37] the talents and gifts that you have
[51:38] given to us
[51:39] and what we have done with them father
[51:41] may this be a special night
[51:43] in the hearts and minds of the children
[51:45] granted lord
[51:46] in jesus name
[51:47] amen
[51:49] but anthony come and sing a few songs
[51:50] when i called brother isaac i'm going to
[51:52] share a few words he was a
[51:55] real partner to bala mundus i've got
[51:58] laughs and everything else but i suppose
[51:59] definitely have something to say
[52:02] amen you appreciate the pastor this
[52:04] evening
[52:06] and then
[52:08] and it's a great privilege to be here
[52:10] once again this is
[52:11] familiar ground many many years we had
[52:14] many wonderful services
[52:16] in this very spot and um over the years
[52:20] but amanda's had a unique way about him
[52:22] whenever
[52:23] situations you know got a certain way he
[52:26] said
[52:26] could we have a service
[52:28] his default response was
[52:32] you know so
[52:33] um once again we are gathered and um
[52:37] it's such a fitting tribute
[52:39] to be able to come together and have
[52:41] another service
[52:42] uh in a special way to salute his life
[52:45] his family his testimony and
[52:47] i remember i spoke here
[52:49] just about last year or so
[52:51] and the title i would have taken was
[52:53] remember me
[52:54] and it was based on remembering
[52:57] what he stood for what he longed to see
[53:00] the desires of his heart
[53:02] and that passion still burns with what
[53:05] he represented to us and in particular
[53:07] over the last you know year and beyond
[53:10] as we were in this whole pandemic and we
[53:12] had so many of the tapes from before you
[53:15] know where the mothers had a certain
[53:16] seat in church
[53:18] so whenever you see the service play
[53:20] you're seeing there for a split second
[53:22] you almost forget that you go on because
[53:25] you're seeing him there on the video
[53:26] every sunday every wednesday and he had
[53:29] one approach it was a worshipper whether
[53:31] he was feeling tired he was a worshipper
[53:33] i remember by the wonders full of
[53:35] sleeping church and his wake up response
[53:36] was glory
[53:38] he was a worshiper it didn't matter what
[53:41] the situation was he was a worshiper
[53:43] amber of it so beautifully described him
[53:45] as a silver and then just for two three
[53:47] minutes before brother anthony comes i
[53:49] just want to
[53:50] speak about the fact that brother
[53:52] mundo's had a genuine connection with
[53:54] god
[53:55] and it's that connection with god is
[53:57] what led him to live his life a certain
[53:59] way that is the reason it was not sure
[54:01] it was not performance he wasn't doing
[54:03] it for credit it wasn't if he was the
[54:05] only person by the tabernacle he was the
[54:06] only person by the tabernacle if nobody
[54:08] else was there he was there and it
[54:09] wasn't because of anybody else it was
[54:11] because of his connection with god
[54:13] and one thing that he was he was in his
[54:15] heart is for his family
[54:18] so for the next few minutes this little
[54:21] encouragement is dedicated to his family
[54:24] his immediate family he the extended
[54:27] family and the wider family of god that
[54:30] are connected so i just want to read
[54:32] one scripture you don't have to stand
[54:34] for it but in john
[54:36] 15 and reading from verse 5
[54:38] and the vine he are the branches
[54:41] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[54:43] same bring it fought much fruit for
[54:45] without me you can do nothing
[54:48] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[54:51] forth as a branch and is withered so if
[54:53] you are living in god you are cast
[54:56] and withered and withering is a process
[54:59] it's not immediate it means the longer
[55:01] you stay away from the presence of god
[55:03] is the more you wither and when you come
[55:06] back into the presence of god the
[55:07] situation begins to change and we see
[55:09] the historical evidence in the old
[55:12] testament when aaron forgot his rod and
[55:14] the holy of holies that rod was dead but
[55:16] in the presence of god overnight it came
[55:18] back to life so it had nothing to do
[55:20] with how long it was out of fellowship
[55:22] or how long it was out of presence or
[55:24] how long it was dead the moment it came
[55:26] back into contact with presence
[55:28] life started to show once more now what
[55:30] i encourage you tonight it doesn't
[55:32] matter how long you've been in church or
[55:33] what's going on or whatever it is if you
[55:36] get back into presence i'm not talking
[55:37] about church i'm talking about presence
[55:39] of god then something has to happen in
[55:41] your life
[55:43] and
[55:44] and verse 7 if you abide in me and my
[55:46] words abide in you you shall ask what he
[55:48] will and it shall be done unto you
[55:50] hearing inside of this that's what
[55:52] hearing is is my father glorified that
[55:54] he bear much fruit
[55:56] so shall he be my disciples as the
[55:58] father had loved me so have i loved you
[56:00] continue in my love
[56:02] if you keep my commandments you shall
[56:04] abide in my love even as i have kept my
[56:07] father's commandment and abide in his
[56:09] love these things have i spoken unto you
[56:11] that my joy might remain in you so
[56:14] there's a desire for all of this that
[56:16] his joy remains in you and that your joy
[56:19] might be full where is your joy tonight
[56:21] is your joyful is it joy three quarter
[56:23] way is it halfway god's desire is that
[56:25] your joy is full this is my commandment
[56:28] that you love one another as i have
[56:30] loved you greater love have no man than
[56:33] this and a man lay down his life for his
[56:35] friends if you are my friends if you ye
[56:38] are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[56:40] command you
[56:42] a skip of one verse one last verse you
[56:44] have not chosen me but i have chosen you
[56:46] and ordain you that you should go and
[56:48] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[56:49] shall remain that whatsoever you shall
[56:51] ask of the father in my name he may give
[56:53] it to you
[56:55] i want to ask one question tonight what
[56:57] are you connected to
[57:00] that's the question
[57:01] but among us was connected to something
[57:03] bigger than himself
[57:05] he was connected to a source
[57:07] that when money was low he had a better
[57:09] source
[57:10] he was connected to a reality that when
[57:12] the world looked glim and this doomy and
[57:15] he should be depressed and frustrated he
[57:16] was connected to something else and the
[57:19] reality is we are here tonight because
[57:21] of a connection it's greater than what
[57:23] we can do ourselves but it is a
[57:24] connection that has kept us through this
[57:26] pandemic through this time it is a
[57:28] connection but i want to challenge you
[57:30] tonight what are you connected to we
[57:32] live in a connected world technology has
[57:34] connected us emails phone technology all
[57:37] these things all exist to keep us
[57:39] connected had it not been for technology
[57:41] when we were on lockdown we wouldn't
[57:43] have no kind of church but technology
[57:45] allowed us to have bible studies and
[57:47] allowed us to have live streaming
[57:49] services it's important to have
[57:51] connections and the ability to be
[57:53] connected we are connected by geography
[57:56] if it wasn't for the fact that this was
[57:57] an island and we all on the same island
[57:59] but the clarence you would never know me
[58:01] and i would never know you but we are
[58:02] connected by the fact that we are on
[58:04] this particular ground we are connected
[58:06] tonight because we are in this room this
[58:08] space this is space something has
[58:10] brought us together and whether you
[58:11] accept it or not we are connected and
[58:14] physics says whenever two particles come
[58:16] into contact with other it with another
[58:18] it's called entanglement it can never be
[58:19] separated
[58:21] that's physics
[58:23] so the connection tonight whether you
[58:25] understand it or not will forever change
[58:28] your life
[58:29] they are connections in nature they are
[58:31] connections in science they are
[58:33] connections in the spiritual
[58:35] god always longed for connection he
[58:38] existed by himself before there was a
[58:40] moon before there was a star before
[58:41] there was man on the earth he longed for
[58:44] a connection and when god said let there
[58:46] be light that was not enough of a
[58:48] connection for him because he couldn't
[58:50] fellowship with the light
[58:52] oh when he created the moon and the
[58:53] stars he was longing for a deeper
[58:55] connection but the connection he didn't
[58:58] have it with the moon and the stars and
[58:59] the mountains and the valleys and the
[59:01] rivers and the animals but when he put
[59:03] man on the earth for the first time god
[59:05] said ah this is the connection that i'm
[59:07] looking for this is the connection that
[59:09] with a mundus found it was that great
[59:12] connection with his creator do you know
[59:14] that you didn't make yourself you didn't
[59:16] choose to be here it's your creator put
[59:18] you here for one reason and one reason
[59:20] only to have a connection with you
[59:23] what a horrible life to live without
[59:26] ever meeting your creator the man who
[59:28] puts you here what life of
[59:30] purposelessness
[59:32] you experience if you don't even know
[59:34] the reason you are born the only reason
[59:36] you can come to know why you are born is
[59:38] to get connected to your creator
[59:42] you meet any young man or young woman
[59:44] who don't know their parents maybe they
[59:46] adopted or whatever it is there's a
[59:47] desire in them i want to know who my
[59:49] father is
[59:50] i want to know who my mother is do you
[59:52] know do you know
[59:54] and and young children as they grow
[59:56] older when they realize this is not
[59:58] their home and maybe they've been
[59:59] adopted you could never beat out of them
[1:00:02] the desire to figure out who their
[1:00:04] natural parents are
[1:00:06] so deep is a desire for connection with
[1:00:08] where you come from
[1:00:10] and we live in this world a world of
[1:00:12] connections that are distractions it is
[1:00:15] the tv it is the internet it's all the
[1:00:17] news and it's really distraction because
[1:00:19] if it catches your eyes enough to keep
[1:00:22] you away from your purpose then you live
[1:00:24] like a robot
[1:00:25] you get them in the morning is your news
[1:00:26] they get up here in facebook you see
[1:00:28] what happens and if you can live in that
[1:00:30] glaze that day that exists you will
[1:00:32] never come to your full potential but
[1:00:34] thank god for services like these that
[1:00:37] remind us that we are not robots that we
[1:00:40] are not part of the technology that we
[1:00:42] are not drones walking around without
[1:00:44] purpose but we are called a higher
[1:00:46] purpose that can only be known when the
[1:00:49] connection is
[1:00:51] re-established
[1:00:54] god had a connection with adam you were
[1:00:55] coming in the cool of the evening just
[1:00:57] like this evening and have just a
[1:00:59] fellowship how was your day
[1:01:01] how did you feel what did you what did
[1:01:03] you do was it a productive day what
[1:01:05] animal did you name what did you change
[1:01:08] etc etc until man fell and broke
[1:01:12] the connection
[1:01:14] and from that time to now we have been
[1:01:16] fighting to re-establish
[1:01:19] the connection
[1:01:21] come back
[1:01:22] back into
[1:01:23] so no wonder when jesus came he said i
[1:01:25] am the vine and you are the panties you
[1:01:28] are supposed to be connected to me if
[1:01:31] you're not connected to me you have no
[1:01:33] purpose you have no life you have no
[1:01:35] destiny i thank god but among us found
[1:01:38] his connection because we could rejoice
[1:01:40] knowing he is with his father
[1:01:43] what are you connected to
[1:01:46] tonight i'm about to close
[1:01:48] there's a connection between labor and
[1:01:51] reward
[1:01:52] people want to achieve things without
[1:01:54] working for it but there's a connection
[1:01:56] between effort between studying for an
[1:01:58] exam and successfully passing the exam
[1:02:02] there's a connection between actions and
[1:02:04] consequences and they are consequences
[1:02:07] for all actions good actions bad actions
[1:02:11] in action that's also an action you know
[1:02:16] connection between study and results
[1:02:18] connection between what you eat and how
[1:02:20] you feel a connection between your rest
[1:02:23] and your ability to be productive a
[1:02:25] connection between your joy and your
[1:02:27] strength the bible tells us the joy of
[1:02:29] the lord is your strength anybody with
[1:02:30] anybody with me tonight a connection
[1:02:33] between your prayer life and a revival a
[1:02:36] connection between the alpha church and
[1:02:38] the omega church a connection between
[1:02:41] being in the presence of the lord and
[1:02:43] living your life a certain way a
[1:02:44] connection between the friends of your
[1:02:46] job in your school in the neighborhood
[1:02:48] and your heavenly host and one day you
[1:02:51] have to fellowship with them
[1:02:53] a connection between the world and the
[1:02:55] spirit the connection between sowing and
[1:02:57] reaping there's a connection between the
[1:03:00] prophet and his prophecy a connection
[1:03:02] between worship and your breakthrough a
[1:03:05] connection between the seed in your soul
[1:03:07] and the god who put that seed in there
[1:03:09] that the devil wishes he could destroy
[1:03:11] but no demon no weapon no principality
[1:03:15] no power nothing present nothing faster
[1:03:17] to become could break that connection
[1:03:21] that god has
[1:03:22] you belong to god and nobody contains
[1:03:25] that let the devil put it in his pipe
[1:03:27] and smoke it you belong to god and the
[1:03:30] devil cannot change it your mistakes
[1:03:33] cannot change your connection your
[1:03:35] failures cannot change your connection
[1:03:38] your past on this earth cannot change
[1:03:41] your connection because your connection
[1:03:43] is not of this world your connection is
[1:03:45] subject to the eternal bonds that were
[1:03:48] there before there was a moon before
[1:03:50] there was a staff before there was a
[1:03:51] problem before there was rent before
[1:03:53] there was a mortgage before they were
[1:03:55] sickness and before they were doctors
[1:03:57] anybody with me
[1:03:59] i'm closing
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:02] david
[1:04:04] lost
[1:04:05] his connection
[1:04:07] and he penned the song he said restore
[1:04:10] unto me
[1:04:12] the joy
[1:04:14] of my salvation
[1:04:15] he didn't lose his salvation but there
[1:04:17] was a joy that was missing
[1:04:20] he was connected but not as connected as
[1:04:23] before he said restore unto me
[1:04:26] the joy
[1:04:27] of my salvation
[1:04:29] i don't know what commission you came
[1:04:30] here tonight you could begin to play
[1:04:31] something softly i'm finished i don't
[1:04:33] know what you came here tonight but i

[1:04:46] service
[1:04:47] without getting reconnected to god
[1:04:50] he is waiting for you
[1:04:53] because he made you and all god loans
[1:04:55] for is to have a relationship with you
[1:04:58] to have a connection with you and him
[1:05:01] this is not you and the church you and
[1:05:02] your husband you and your wife you and
[1:05:04] your family this is just you and god
[1:05:06] alone
[1:05:07] that if nothing else would exist in the
[1:05:08] world yes you and god have such a
[1:05:10] connection that nothing could break the
