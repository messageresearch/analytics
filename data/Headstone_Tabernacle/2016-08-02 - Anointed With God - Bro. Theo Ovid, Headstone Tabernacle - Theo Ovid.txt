welcome lonard Murray Jeremiah Elijah odika Welcome to The Headstone Tabernacle God bless you invited by Brother Terry Davis God bless you uh just want to announce to remember us in prayer uh we have some meetings in Germany this coming week brother Isaac Anthony and myself we have an appointment in Germany and we be there so service continue as usual everything going to be right on the button and you're going to be blessed amen so we just want to remember us in prayer and uh how many appreciate the service last [Applause] Sunday no more excuses everything is and all you have to do is accept the invite and the King already prepared everything just accept the invite and people turn it down and you know what was impressive he said and yet there is room amen he invite people to come and yet there was room and you know what he said go call the Hal lame blind go go call all types amen and that is what going to happen the kingdom of God will be made up of God's people amen hallelujah amen and and it might be pretty people nice people long dressed people no no no it' be all types but God will take them and clean them up God will take them from their very condition God don't have to take religious Behavior God have to take that seed that's inside your soul God is not waiting for people to get cleaned up to save them and deliver them he take you up just as you are and that's how we have to express God to others by loving them just as they are Hallelujah do I hear Amen in the house could be Love Like Jesus could we forgive like Jesus could we act like Jesus every day we are challenged you know because we on our way to be like Jesus that's the objective but Brandon said I didn't come to build another denomination I came to build individuals into the statue of a perfect man oh blessed be the name of the Lord you love him this morning praise be to Jesus hallelujah thank you Lamb of God well I am happy to be here it's always a privilege to be in the house of God a privilege where God could speak to your heart and you could wait upon him blessed be the name of the Lord isn't he wonderful this morning Hallelujah okay I wanted to read something here hope I could get it from Brother zigma convention in Germany if I could get it I'll share it with you but I think it was a real blessing about brother BR talking about his objective and motive is to point people to Christ not to himself not a group but to point people to Christ I said you could pick it up for me I want to get that part that quotation the objective of the convention I want to read it for you I know it be a blessing to you you see the objective and motive must be right for it to happen just as you have to run the race right for you to correctly get the gold medal amen because if you don't run the race right you'll be disqualified yes sir at the end of the race amen so this is where it come down to the purity of heart sir and Mind and Spirit you get a word just now I'm still waiting I'm still waiting but brandom says I rather be right in my spirit yes and wrong in my Doctrine than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my spirit that that would qu in again amen I rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my doctrine that than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my spirit you see if you have the right Spirit you can get connected to the right Doctrine but if you have the wrong Spirit you're in trouble big time this is the inspiration for this International summer convention August 7th to 14th the convention is dedicated time of prayer consecration worship speaking receiving the truth in love and being filled and refilled and sealed by the spirit of God l in God promises since many eyewitnesses of the ministry of brother William Branham went on to be with the Lord this zigma the host Pastor I have in my heart to invite still living eyewitnesses of God's Prophet to come and give witness personally of the presence of God and a confirmation of his word and the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in this man of God and the things they personally have seen and heard it our it is our heart's desire to experience the very same presence of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ in our midst as it was Vindicated in brother branham's meeting there will be holy ghost filled ministers and the body of Christ to minister under the holy spirit let us pray that the bright promises will be preached in such a way that the Holy Spirit may give to the hungry Hearts such instructions such an experience that they will know perfectly how to submit and take a hold of God's promises and how to let the word promise then flow through the Born Again sinless nature to defeat the enemy we therefore in defeat the enemy God said I will restore the faith again in the last days God is sending the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted wordu that it will restore therefore Co invite you to this convention and please give the invitations to your brothers and sisters especially to our young people in the church May the following quotes Express the attitude and vision for this convention and this is what I want to read this is Brother brand not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied the one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I've given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart this is Brother brand I'm speaking for the church ages Hallelujah we need a conference a universal pray meeting for the Church of the Living God to be called together and this is the last quote I believe it's coming to a time till when the saints will get together like this and just a l spirit will sweep over the audience and every person in dear all that is wrong will be taken out it will be such a presence of the Holy Spirit and I believe it's coming a Time see all this is prophecy I believe it's coming a time when God's church is going to be called out like that that's he use that's the word he Ed called out like that where the Saints will set together and the Holy Spirit will just come in and just woo just like it was on the day of Pentecost and just heal the people and raise up the people and great things I begin to see it happen it's the love of God we'll be standing preaching like this talking and just love will settle over the building this is from God keeps his word hallelujah that why it's very important for you to understand and hear God's promises amen because God is God if you didn't understand that God said a rain was going to flood was coming and Noah's day you was going to miss the ark you have to hear what God promised amen not what you feel and what you think because you could feel certain things about certain scriptures but it may not apply to your age or your time or your season suppose you feel led to apply blood right now and kill a goat kill a lamb and and put the blood you feeling led by the spirit that is a different spirit because that was for Moses time God's word for you now is not to take blood literal blood and apply it on the door poost so you have to find out what is your word and there's a word for your life so God bless you and thank you again we want to be praying for those meetings for brother zigma in uh Germany that God will bless and we expecting God to do great things amen so how many going to pray for the meetings pray for us oh Hallelujah Glory you see this bride buddy this is wife of Jesus Christ now see this a mix getting mix up with church this is not church this is Christ wife the Bible said his wife had me your ready so this is not one one person no no no it's a universal bright body people that call to love God people that have a deep in their soul remember you didn't call yourself we were wretched miserable naked poor blind something higher than you something more powerful than you therefore you can't play self-righteous and look down on [Applause] nobody Hallelujah because he raised you up he is the one that rais you up he's the one that give you eyes that you might see he did it that's why when the headone come it going to come with shoutings of Grace Grace not not works works going to be the grace of God and if the power is to come among the people it going to be the grace of God so let's thank God and relish in his grace and thank God for his grace and thank God for his Mercy oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so God call out a people to walk with God alone alone isn't that right not being governed by a bishop or being govern but being governed by Christ in his Messiah Kingdom that we live in where Christ is the king amen an antichrist Spirit tries to get called the people from organization to organization to organization organize them together which was never the will of God people have fuss with me because I struck so hard at organization it isn't the people in there I'm striking at it's that dominating spirit that makes people think we are the people and you are not that's what it does it brings I am better than you I am higher than you I have more Revelation than you I'm more powerful than you and that's foolishness in theide of God because when you put the equal sign we are Sons and Daughters of God and God had to find you wherever you are I don't care if you're a prostitute in a drunker I don't care you're a drug addict I don't care what condition you're in that God have to find you wherever you are glory to God who he follow call and God are calling you because you're here along God a calling you because you dressed long what they calling you because you never smoke and you never drink and you never do that that's not how God calling you he follow he called [Applause] Hallelujah you may be see that that that's why they couldn't handle Jesus Jesus John wasn't mixing with nobody when Jesus come and the see Jesus with this one and that one and all kind of Sinners and Jesus and Jesus to bust them he said listen all you're well he said I I come for the sick because the well have no need of physician I come to heal the sick I come to get the D trodden I come to raise the dead I come to cast out Devils I come to free people from their prison that's what I come to do praise God I ain't come to say you better than you praise God you better than you woman go and sin no more go I come to release you from your condition I come to set you and break you out from what you wi I come to lift limitations off of your life Hallelujah then he said powerful word he said who the son of man some sometime ago the some prisoners break out they were free yes temporarily temporar you see the the Lord didn't free them they break out that's not what Jesus talking about when the son of man set you free they can't look for you and try to bring devil is a liar this most devil can't come after you and say you're supposed to go back inside that prison not when God break you out that's when un free you he came to open up the prison bar be seated I see no reason why anybody should leave your bong today I believe everybody could leave your free in heart free in mind free in spirit I feel you could take the p and put it behind you and walk on it stand up on it till the pass [Music] move I'm going to preach as now let me see it if if Moses was studying his past he never went back to Egypt because he was wanted but when he get anointed when Moses get anointed with God amen that that that's a whole different thing all together amen so the last quote I want to bring back to you oh praise the name of the Lord the Church of the Living God can never be any certain group on it cannot be an organization it has to be a mystical body the holy spirit amen friends Isaiah 60 say arise Shine the Light is come and then he says gross Darkness cover the Earth gross Darkness cover the people it's amazing how God will put the light first and put the positive first and put the negative after this is where we are right now gross darkness is like a thick Blackness people are blind religious and blind they walking in darkness walking without any protection walking in in hell and walking through hell and God promised light will come and God sent an E Light message to shine light that you could see where to put your foot you don't see the whole thing it's not like a big black light no no no it's it's little lights that you could walk one step two step just seven steps you have to get three steps have seven steps to Faith and virtue and knowledge Temperance enough steps to know you're going I know you have patience but that is your own we talking about the patience of Jesus Christ I know you have Temperance but that's is your own we not talking about that one that one will run out we want the temperance of Jesus Christ the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ I know you can be long but you want of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so you want Jesus to inject you with his life infect you want to infection from Jesus kind of virus infecting people you want to be infected by Jesus infected by the power of God infected by the blood of God you want a blood transfusion you want to be in Hospital table this morning that your blood go out and Jesus blood comes in then you have the life of Jesus you live like Jesus you act like Jesus you talk like Jesus you'll be AOS just like Jesus could wee stand and give God some Praises right now as you want to go into the word hallelujah hallelujah going to go to Matthew chapter 3 two verses there verse 16 and 17 John chap 20 to verses there 21 and 22 and Mark 16 verse 14- 20 Matthew 3 verse 16 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open upon him and he saw the spirit of God descended like a dove and lighten upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased or pleased to dwell in St John chapter 20 reading verse 21 and 22 and then then said Jesus to them peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and say unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost last scripture of Mark on reading from Mark chapter 6 16 and you want to read from verse 14 afterward he appeared unto 11 as they sat at meat and up braided or rebuked them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpant and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right on of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word which signs following amen let's bow our heads for word of prayer father we thank you for your presence and your power that we feel is Among Us right now and you promis where the tws and trees are gathered together you've been in our midst God you know the needs of their people minister to their needs and help them help us the bride budes the sick body and Earth we pray virtue will go out of families to marriages to homes to the children to each represented here those that are connected to us on the internet may you bless them also and may the spirit be released upon their lives in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God I have a title this morning Anointed with God hallelujah of a subject fully surrendered to God have an inspiration ambassadors of the throne amen ambassadors of the throne Wonder an individual Christian note my words Christian not church member Christian represent the kingdom of God Amen you listen carefully as a Christian amen represent God's kingdom amen amen amen hallelujah not your family not your [Music] kind the kingdom because what Jesus come to preach was the kingdom amen he never tried to establish a church Jesus church in no no he come to establish a kingdom he told him my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my men would fight for me Hallelujah so he he was trying to bring them to a higher Kingdom to a higher life to a higher thinking alog together he say I've heard in all past eye for eye and tooth for tooth but I say unto you amen amen amen don't go down to that Barbarian Level Hallelujah don't go down to that H I do and you let your nature be loosed I want to take it to another level because that nature is a Higher One Hallelujah that life is a higher life the law is for the Lawless but I call you to hire by the power of Grace to release you to get back to where you were before which is Back to Eden which is back to your sunship which is back to your godship which is back to your inheritance Glory so the mind is the gateway to the soul that's why before you you do something it has to come true to your mind and by time it get your heart you're caught because of what somebody have in their heart their mouth could go this way but it's what they have in their heart so he said your mind open up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affection so if your mind could shut shut down that you could say I don't you know you don't feel to praise God this morning you shut that down that's right so you don't even bother with your feelings you raise your hands anyhow you're feeling so good you're feeling sick you reject that and you put your feeling one side Hallelujah you put your feeling outside a feeling upset you you changed that Hallelujah you're feeling right set Hallelujah and when you start that kind of way you put the devil he upside down he he don't know what to think about you after what he start handle you you see you want to come like Moses when when when when Moses was finished with Pharaoh Moses Pharaoh said take your flocks take your people take all take it and [Applause] go Hallelujah glory to God Amen how many want to deal with the issues oh give the Lord a shout I'm not hearing that shout you have to deal with it I say it and say it again and again until until it stick you can't defeat what you're not prepared to confront let me say it again you can't defeat what you're not to prepare to confront you have to confront yourself look in the mirror and deal with you deal with your anger your temper your attitude your hastiness your impatience your lost deal with it oh come on now P you the disrespect deal with it your lose Tong deal with it don't try to cover it over deal with it take the head of that dog off oh give the Lord a shout of Praise you're going to put your foot on the devil's neck you're going to put your foot on those Philistines every Power that binding You Hinder you upset you you're going to overcome you were raised up for that you were called for such a time as this don't let the devil tell you otherwise oh you may be seated praise God my God I feel I'm getting started the devil cannot get stronger all years is the same old devil but we can come on now come on now the Lord I shout in the [Applause] H all right [Applause] Jesus so the battle rageed since the Garden of Eden yes in the human mind that's right it's not even your battle because this battle started in heaven people want to die and go to heaven amen and and there was and there was war and there was war in heaven amen Michael fought and the dragon fought battle in heaven you know and then they kick them demons out and it fell on the Earth and the Battle of angels became the Battle of men oh hallelujah hallelujah and now here you tonight you are in between hell is below demons coming up Heaven is on top Angels coming down and you are in between what is influencing you this morning Oh Glory you may be seated and from every section releasing an anointing anointing From Below anointed from above but today we talking about being Anointed with [Applause] God Hallelujah Jesus use the words the spirit is upon me amen amen for he had anointed anointed me all right and the Battleground that was chosen was the human mind that's right because the human mind is where decisions are made that's friends you to forgive me but I love decisions I love to choose I love to know I am responsible for my choice I hate excuses I don't like excuses no more excuses we put the fire on the excuses it's because I she it's because I he and them say and this one no no no no excuses ex you choose to love you choose to forgive you choose to repent you choose to hang in there I ask the song leader to sing hold to God's unchanging hand I choose that song this morning oh cover not this world's inres that soon rapidly Decay seek again the Heavenly Treasures they will never pass away hold to God's unchange I choose that may be seated I didn't choose that because I old now when you see them grir in my head since I 17 years old I made that choice to serve God and put him first above money popularity and woman God first above family God first before this one and that God first above ministers preachers ministers Association and all who think about what I have nothing to do with the thoughts of man man didn't call me man can't save me man they don't have a heaven they don't have a hell but God call you God save you glory to God hallelujah and God going to justify you God is one to justify God is the one that justify it don't look for no man to justify you is there a shout in the house listen you may be seated you can be nice like Joseph you will still be hated Without a Cause there all people that don't like you so don't play nice iy for everybody somebody going hate you they don't know why they hate you they have anointing upon them because you anointed of God Joseph was a special man with a special son and so are you that's why God called you to hell and high water you're going to make it because God going to drop that anointing upon you oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to [Applause] God may be seated Samson is presented as a man with big muscles and being like if he J pump a gym but the truth was Samson was a small little fell with some girly looking curls said seven of them you wouldn't believe what that man have in him until the anointing come upon him oh when the spirit of the Lord comes upon my [Applause] heart oh you getting started you getting [Applause] started seated one time Samson walk into a field a thousand Philistines the man have a weapon the man have no protection the man have no backups a thousand Philistine with the armor and they spare and the shield and the spirit of God come upon Samson and Samson took a jaw bone a old him and Donkey Jawbone and THS take that Jawbone but the anointing upon him the anointing upon it it has to be upon him and upon it because if the anointing is not upon you and upon it you would have the faith to take it to deal with them but when the anointing comes upon you whenever you touch whenever you put your foot PR God whatever you do going to prosper because the anointing is upon you you are anointed with [Applause] God right now your depression leaving right now your frustration right now your sicknesses we curse every sickness in this building this morning come on we set you free we come against demon powers we the devil come out let my people go [Applause] [Applause] do I have Hallelujah in the [Applause] house let be seated Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you see what you feel is what Samson feel Samson It Came Upon him he had no books he had no church he had no song leader he had nobody exalting him he was one man that God called and God spoke to and put a covenant with seven lcks Oh Glory to God as long as you keep that Covenant I'm going to be with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you even in you come on now we're looking for a church that going to be anointed of God [Applause] SE am a man amen amen cannot sin until he first cast aside God's word amen amen amen until first he gets rid of the word of God the presence of God he cannot sin that why David said the Lord is at my right hand I shall not be moved let me say it again he said the Lord is on my right right hand I shall not be moved in other words David used to be practicing the presence of God that the Lord is with him amen cuz when people feel the Lord not there they want to do this they want to do that they want to do that they want to do that because the Lord he's not he's not seeing but David said the Lord is not mine right hand I Shall Not Be Be Moved oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why the Bible says in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established so you can't just take a report about someone and there's no evidence or Witnesses you'll be receiving an evil report isn't that right that's why if somebody offend you or something don't go and tell somebody go to that person Amen suppos to misinterpret them amen like I give a reference one time you can see somebody come out a bar with some water or something some bottle and next the report come he was in the B drinking you didn't see him drinking that's right man that's but that's the report but the person car May broken down and they went to get some water to put the radiator but because it was seen that way and instead of verifying information somebody run with that and next minute he was drinking he was drinking and see him coming out

preachers going to do that you know they said these signs come on now shall follow them say them say them say them say them them that believe are you a Believer okay the Lord I shou in the [Applause] house and there's more to that the Bible said the Lord himself went everywhere in the kitchen D tongue in the bus wherever you go you have escorts the angel the Lord and Camp around them that fail him don't be afraid I want to get the faar out your system praise God too much of [Applause] fear listen you could be fear in your wrong group amen and you're looking for the right group but I read for you there is no right group in the sense then that God has set no church up there's no certain organization or group could say we have it the rest of them doesn't have it that's Spirit you know yeah that's the superior okay Hallelujah Glory if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another 5 minutes hallelujah praise God there would be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you can get that certain thing fixed Hallelujah if I could change your mind I could change your behavior if the word could change your mind you could change your life am amen but you have to want that change be transformed by the renewing of your mind your mind has to change before your heart could change that's why God start wri a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll put my spirit inside your spirit what it is changing your mind changing your thoughts changing your desires amen as we said God invading your very life amen hallelujah all right when Jesus came on the scene God always vindicates the truth that's the reason today we can't have faith faith is not based upon man's theology faith is based upon the solid rock of God's Eternal Word before I continue I want to say back something we talk about right spirit and wrong Doctrine better than right Doctrine and wrong Spirit that's true but God did s a prophit for us to have right spirit and wrong Doctrine amen he s a prophet that we can have the right spirit and right Doctrine I want to nail that down so I'm not advocating this right Spirit right Spirit no no no no no God s a prophet with thus sayth the Lord and that Prophet said the spirit the bride and the prophet will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word it you can't take away from it it's th say the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah so watch so Jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when he came to the Earth here he was known of the day that John baptized him God Vindicated him God spoke from the heavens John saw him coming down in the form of a dove and said this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell the right translation here is in whom I am pleased to dwell in Jesus immediately Anointed with God amen amen amen amen he was just a man till that time but now he becomes a God man right so the anointing of God brings you to become God a God man amen hallelujah you see God is a spirit and Christ means the anointed one a man Anointed with god oh give the Lord some praise His people and just as a man could be Anointed with God a man could be Anointed with the devil listen to this Jesus was God he had a big job he went over to theic in gadara who has been a wild man for years a young fellow we were told had lost his human reasoning lived in tombs with an evil spirit what a place for man to live in a graveyard is very fitting for the devil to be among dead things so he lived out there and was so terribly Afflicted with these demons he broke chains his strength was here we go a super strength did you ever see a man that had been stricken by the evil spirit like that he is several times his strength yes I have noticed them in the meetings when groups of police couldn't even hold them they would tear them police to pieces and carry on on because here why he is fully surrendered to the evil one that's right it took possession of him and had not his own understanding he only did what the evil spirit put in him to do then I taught with complete surrender to the devil a man can be five times his strength what could complete surrender to God doe to to a man what would it do to that's weak in the body that can't walk if we could completely yield to the Holy Ghost God will give us a super strength to rise in the name of Jesus greater is he that's in you that he's in the world the strength of God that's in you is greater than any Affliction that can come upon you there is nothing can overtake you but you're going to supersede it because you are full of superpower and that superpower is the holy spirit that dominates your life if you are a Christian oh Hallelujah that mean everybody in here could be healed every sick person here can get a touch from Heaven you could shake it off [Applause] yes you may be seated oh Hallelujah my and Jesus he was not part God he was all God he created the winds the waves if other things had to obey him he was the creator notice let us remember he also created our bodies he create winds he create waves he create Seas he create fishes and he created our bodies let man come from the dust of the earth and God formed man first was a spirit man Genesis 1 then a dust man Genesis 2 and God put the spirit man in the dust man that's you and I here this morning Hallelujah so he created our bodies just as he create fish and moon and stars and everything else hear the spot won't our bodies have to obey him yes come on now come on now help me somebody oh Hallelujah so now he's coming on to power over self that's why when the spirit hit Jesus he was he went into the willingness to overcome the lust of the eyes overcome the lust of the flesh overcome the pride of life because before God empowers a man with full power he has to be able to overcome himself no excuses oh give the Lord a shout that's nothing but that's gospel that's nothing but the truth people looking for power and have no character no power for them Hallelujah why you think God holding back power not because God stingy and God P hard to get hard to give he's holding back power like you know you seen characters now without power what they behave how they behaving much if they get power on top of that they behave worse oh Hallelujah that prime minister as president all time in opposition the one way so as they come in power they change a different cap fit the head Hallelujah that's man all about the poor the struggling the scrun and some blessing come around them they on top the world if rainfall they drun the nose up in [Music] a and God looking for somebody the more God blesses the more humble they become the more you could bow my God because God was so great he humbled himself and came to us and God want you to live that out praise God do you believe that so what he created our bodies won't our bodies obey him you surrender your thoughts to him you surrender your life to him you surrender your faith to him and watch that body obey what he says if you a drunker and you can't quit drinking surrender the life to him and what you will drink no more if you are habitual smoker and try to give it up and can't do it Just Surrender that to him and Watch What Happens he will make that body come in subjection to the word oh Hallelujah but you have got to surrender it to him but people worship the spirit upon them praise God sometime people don't even want prayer because they want to continue what they're doing so they don't really want no Deliverance they really don't want no breakthrough they know it's right they know Church nice to go to and they will come and get blessed but they don't really want that breakthrough yet because they have the things to do they have the friends to keep up they have the places they want to go and this cost for a price he say If any man follow me let him deny himself self take up his [Applause] cross Oh Glory to God do I hear a shout in the [Applause] house Jesus said If any man come after me are waiting on the Lord waiting the Lord wait Lord he say If any man come you want him you go after him seek after him he said those who seek my face God I want you I want a reality I had enough I hear

like in the Garden of Eden I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is but here the fine print of that statement the fine print a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent oh give the Lord some Praises that's my subject a [Applause] man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent and when omnipotent speaks the miraculous takes place Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout on that one when my omnipotent speak Lazarus come forth I don't care if the man dead how many days how he's [Applause] roted brother bam said one time I want to challenge your faith that's a great statement for a person to make and I want to give you in this manner you think of yourself now your Methodist Baptist Pentecostal or whatever you are if we had to contend for that faith and we believe that Jesus rose from the dead this same man that makes the challenge that time I said you can't prove one thing that there is a God outside the supernatural for when omnipotent speak the miraculous take place omnipotence can't speak without being miraculous amen so how can a man claim to be fully surrender to God and there is no Miracle come on Amen almost sound like he's lying or he's not talking the full truth a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent so when Jesus was going and need looking for fig from the Fi Tree cursed the tree and next day the

they hear this wait till The Voice come and hear it and know that it's God is dust of the Lord if it isn't Dusty the Lord then it's your impression it's what somebody else thinks people request people say this for me do this for me how can you do it if you're not if you're honest with God until God first tells you how can I tell you do here Jack Mo and Jack Mo hasn't said nothing to me it has to to come first from God not impressed it's got to be God then it will happen for it is thus sayth the Lord woman came to brother brandham and she couldn't get have couldn't have a child and so on she couldn't get pregnant and so on and baram thus say the Lord you'll have a baby and L she get among other wom and they talking talking she doubt and what not and whatnot sometime later on she came back to brother brandham and she said B you know I went among other woman and a doubt and I a believe having a child he said what did he say you said he said dust say the Lord he say whether you believe it or don't believe it you still dust say the Lord now when it's dust say the Lord it a even resting upon the woman you know not even resting upon our faith you know is what God has declared and that's the same as as I will restore God ask if you going to restore anything or you want now he said I will restore to you all the yes I Hall [Applause] [Applause] hallu and the Holy Spirit if a man is Anointed of God will direct you to follow the Holy Spirit and the Bible amen for he is the one who dos these things Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit oh my hallelujah praise God so from resuming the church agents he said thus say the Lord Joel 238 says be glad J of Zan rejoice in the Lord for given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the for mon L rain in the first month and the flow shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I'll restore to you the years the LC has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar pmer my great Army you shall eat in plenty and my people shall never be ashamed now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age didn't restore the church it started the Reformation isn't that right what now this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much if it possible receive the very elect and who is it that they attempt to deceive the very elect the spirit of the Antichrist in the false anointed one in the last days these false one have already come in Jesus name claiming that they have been anointing of God for this last day they are false Messiah anointed ones they claim they are prophets but they are one with the word never they have added or taken from it no no one denies that spirit of God manifesting his gifts upon them but like bam they all have their programs make their appe for money exercise gifts but deny the word and bypass it for fear that the controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God like Judas with a Ministry impacted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have the wrong Spirit motivating them watch this part I want to get to they outshine the elect in effort and zeal but it is ludian not of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs startling signs among them they preach a second coming and so forth but deny the Advent of a prophet messenger though in power and signs and true Revelation eclipsing them all yes here this part this false spirit in the last days is so close to the real can be distinguished here we go only by its deviation from the word amen amen not by anointing not by shouts not by jumping not by singing not by specials not by worship but by deviating from the word from the word that's why we say the prophet and the bride and the spirit says the same thing and what they say will be already in the word are you with me watch they can distinguish only by it division from the word and whenever it is caught in being anti- word it falls back on one argument we already are shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God God because we get results oh my oh my are you with me watch watch God had called Moses he didn't want to go those prophets had things it was hard thing to do they didn't want to be going out and be scorn that they want to have fellowship and go to the rest of them I don't want to do this but God has spoken and I must deliver it whether it like it whether they crucified him whether they stoned him whatever it is God has spoke to his heart obedience is better than sacrifice watch it was in his heart he must do it it was his life he couldn't hold it there was something here we go a pulsation that pushed them they couldn't bless or curse it God had so much complete control of them till he was their voice their action these prophets so look at Elijah Elijah said not even rain or DW will fall till I call Fair amen he shut the heavens could you imagine a man doing that amen shut the heavens not even due or rain will fall till I call for it these guys were so Anointed with God that their Word was God hallelujah then B prophesy give me a church that so completely Anointed with god Till there every action and move is dust say the Lord walk in that CH kind of Glory I will show you a messiah anointed one of God standing upon on the Earth today oh hallelujah oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theology fail to do in 2,000 years you wait till the annointing of the church strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant after the doors of the Gentile is closed God will anoint his church then he is filthy be filthy still who rightous rightous still oh my what a time oh my oh my oh my hallelujah amen hallelujah so praise God so Joseph was giving a quote of of Many Colors and the Brethren hated him he came to bring them peace but they misunderstood him they hated him without a cause they didn't try to stop to see what he was trying to achieve they just judge him because listen he didn't agree with them amen say do agree with them they judge you He makes himself so and so and so and so look at Moses he couldn't help TR himself there he didn't do it hypocritically when God tell Moses get away there I'm going to destroy the people Moses put himself in the Gap and said Lord before I destroy them for me amen mes wasn't play acting you know Moses was looking for photo shoot you know he was genuine Spirit of Christ in him said before you take them people take me first it was the spirit of Christ in Moses oh Hallelujah are you with me he never did it for self Glory watch if they would have looked to the word they would have seen his purpose he will always do that to glorify the father neither will any servant of God take Glory neither would any servant take the gift of God and try to glorify himself I want to read that again a servant of God will not take Glory neither would any servant of God take a gift of God and try to glorify himself the spirit of God working in men make men act like God no wonder Jesus said is not it written here gods that is small G not Big G and if they are called God to whom the spirit of God came to how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God they were Gods come on G because here what here here why here why here why because they had completely surrendered themselves to the spirit of God and they were working for the glory of God David said you come with me in shield and spear but I come to you in the name of the Lord hallelujah he had the right objective he had the right motive isn't that right so when a man is Anointed with the spirit now let us go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man are you ready everybody alive amen everybody up when a man is so Anointed with the spirit when a man is Anointed of the spirit of God his habits his actions and everything is moving in him sometime he's misjudged look at David David say my God my God why forsaken me that was the spirit of Christ in David and when you read in Psalm how could David say that it was the spirit saying my God my God somebody said listen that hypocrite up there who hands is pierced who feet is pierced that's the intellectual but one what discernment of spirit would know that was the spirit of God in him crying out when a man is Anointed Here We Go Again of the spirit of God he has got the action of God hallelujah are you ready and the action of God is never to break us up amen the action of God is to draw us together for We Are One in Christ Jesus Jesus God's purpose is to bring us together to love one another do you get that the action of God is not to break up break up husband and wife break up families break up churches break up this break up that they not the action of God the action of God is to bring together Hallelujah he is making a bride he is Hing the chips now chopping off the world watch he's cutting you down now cutting you down to his word only cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the son another Masterpiece part of the word how could you become bride you have to cut shave shape you to be his bride you can't come up with your old your own self he wants to cut the church out just like he cut the Sun out like he did the bride and groom to be his bride you must be part of him you must leave the world you amen praise God hallelujah butam he wants a masterpiece today are you willing are you ready my Christian friend are you really sure that your life is so reflecting of for Christ no matter what the world say you have lost your mind you're going crazy you went and joined the church of Holy Rollers don't pay attention to that if you're not truly saved in that body and the word of God in you and reflecting itself and the life of Christ reflecting out of you brother sister don't take that chance and don't care what you are what an experience you have let that will reflect through you each day because God in this last day is taking a bride for his son Jesus Christ not a church for his son a bride for his son and that bride is made up of members who are part of him who is part of that word so you could never get fight with the word because you are going to be the word itself so when the word hit you you can only say Amen that word is you you are part of that word isn't that right so therefore he give birth to the tree on the day of Pentecost isn't that right Luke 24:49 and do it power from on high and there he give birth to the tree the Holy Ghost Pentecost justification sanctification the Bap Holy Ghost and then Christ come to dwell in it to bring forth the fruits fruits justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost then the person of the Holy Ghost comes in that to bring forth the fruits oh my so All Through the Ages all these organizational vines or branches rather and what God keep doing cutting them off they produce a Branch Methodist Branch Pentecostal Branch he keep cutting it off because that's not the original Branch God didn't make no Pentecostal church Baptist Church Methodist Church Catholic Church he didn't make those things men set up those things so as the vines and branches push out because Baptist after his kind Catholic after his kind Methodist after his kind everybody after his kind but God of a kind to Hallelujah will we give the Lord a shout hallelujah every seed have to bring forth after is kind God have a kind too hallelujah oh Hallelujah so watch they are dead and and won't come in the presence won't come in the first resurrection with Divine fruit of organization watch they will go into organizational group and they won't come with the fruit of the vine so we cannot point you to this church or point you to an organization or pointed to a system you have to be pointed to Jesus Christ because he's the vine and you are the branch and he expect to bring forth fruit out to you a man get a wife is to produce children is to produce fruit well a Vine having branches is to produce fruit he want to pump his life through him through you to produce the fruit come on you are the woman you are the Bride come on now you are the womb hallah Oh Glory to God you are the man with the womb you're the woman Hallelujah to produce child for Christ Hallelujah Messiah will be on the earth oh my God are the sons of God going to come forth oh Hallelujah we going to make Adam proud my God Adam going to be happy Adam didn't make it Hallelujah as a son placed positionally he fell and God said I'm going to reboot reflip the whole thing and put you true process Adam a place son adult son mature son as it was place in the G fall down Bo God say I want to bring them two children now let them go to the growth process and listen God himself didn't bypass it because Christ was born of a virgin so he went through the process also Christ is a teenager Christ is a young man Christ is a carpenter had to wait his time to be anointed of God he saying I waitting for anointing I a to work now I Ain working no shop I am I am I am Jesus Hallelujah so how you be a lazy Jesus I'm not working Jesus Jesus worked Jesus walked Jesus Liv a normal life so he could understand that you will have no excuses he suffer things he was tried he was tested he was in the word he waited for his anointing amen 13 to 30 he was in the scriptures waiting for the anointing of God hallelujah waiting for John to come out he go before time you can raise your FL I'm Jesus I already know I'm going forth with my feet with with no anointing of God can't do that Jesus Oh My hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord huah Hallelujah so any home stretch here can we take a little more this is a personal experience with god brother brandham and I felt L to bring this back to you the story of the building some lesson inside of there we're going to see and I believe that Jesus said this the things that I do shall you do also and I believe these things was to accompany the resurrection of Jesus Christ's Ministry watch I um okay okay loveing him we have faith we have love but but if we have love we have faith perfect love castes out fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect amen when fear is gone Fai is perfect when fear is gone fate is perfect your fear going to lose your job your fear will not get a job your fear you would this will happen that will happen faith is not made perfect with fear you throw that fear out and you put Faith in God and God holds tomorrow so everything going to be just right as God ordained it to be then you move in the faith of God believ in God isn't that right so but brandham was passing through a field that had a killer Bull and that killer bull is just a title for bull M killer but his name is not killer because he killed before so he have reputation and brother Brown forget that killer was in that field and he leave his gun back and so on he's walking through the field let's continue I turned first I fell for the gun it wasn't there I'm glad it wasn't I'll probably killed the bull and paid for it I felt for the gun it wasn't there I looked at the fence it was too far for me there was no trees around for me to get to there was nothing but to face death I said Lord if the time has come for me to die I want to face it like a man so I showed my shoulders down I said if this is it if I must die by this bull then I must die and something happened amen amenallah am I know this sound like a child but it's the truth somehow instead of despising that Beast I had a love for it and I thought that poor thing laying out in the field I come in on his territory I disturb him he don't know no more than to protect himself he threw his horns up dug the dirt up fell into his knees you know what they do before they charge and I told that animal I feel so sorry sorry I disturb you I said you going to talk to animal now now remember what God tell Adam right have power over animals and the Beast of the field and everything else this is God talk Adam that this is Genesis and this is a man the 20th century in a field with a bull and this is what is happening and I said I'm sorry to disturb you I don't want to kill you I'm a servant of God I'm on my way to pray for sick people I forget about the signs I was talking just like them now and there was something another had happened something has happened now so going up now I wasn't scared of him I was no more afraid of that bull than I would my brother aha so first something happened he's had to love the B and then something happened again no fear you ever see a little child with a dog or any animals no fear when a big man will front from a big dog the child will walk straight up to that dog no fear good when the Bull made his charge to come to me he come within 10 ft and he stopped threw his feet out he looked so depleted he looked this way that way he turned went right back around and laid down and I walk oh no no sorry sorry um Hallelujah that is where the church is you're always scared it's not going to happen that's the reason it don't happen when fear love cast out fear when you got love fear is gone but as long here we go there's a bumb as long as you got fear love cannot operate Hallelujah as long as you are fear love cannot operate so B had spoke to the bull and tell the bll go back and sit down and so on right and the Bull made his charge look depleted and he turned and went right back around laid down there where he got up at I walk across the field went out the pasture he laid there look at me it was love that took the faar away and God seen me through now H the next part after I got out the pastor and that left me I was shook like a leaf Hallelujah W did you hear that amen that that whatever come over him when he come out of that he was shaken like a leaf amen while I was in the presence of him that fear had left what was it the anointing of God when I come upon him he's a different man what is he a God man a man just like Adam amen let's continue oh my so B says here watch you are man outside you is one man inside of you is another man inside of you is Supernatural outside is physical God angel is the very same word you can't separate God messenger or God angel which has the greater Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit which has it the angel at the pulpit if an angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel to you that that which I have already preached let him be a curse so the angel Anointed with the holy spirit with the word stand next to God watch my God he said watch all powers of Heaven is is given into my hand oh if the great holy church Jesus say all PA Heaven is given into my hand go I'll be with you always whatever you bind on Earth I'll B bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth I loose in heaven if the great holy church only realized its power to do these things but there is so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright but when here we go every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and the church has the power and they have everything that heaven owns behind them amen they are ambassadors of the throne oh hallelujah praise God do you see that now all fear gone then you become an ambassador of the throne when the government set up sent out an ambassador it represent the country it represent all the countes behind you all the authori is behind you and when you become ambassador of the Throne of God the whole Heaven is behind you all the authorities behind you you're not representing yourself you're not representing your own kingdom you're not representing your own family you represented the kingdom of the most high you ambassador of the Throne of God and from that Throne proceed lightning Thunders and voices Oh Glory to God and when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God oh hallelujah praise God do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you believe that so when fire came into Peter's heart and bumed the demons out of Peter and God put a throne and sit down on Earth and now of firea came into the church lying and Peter said you're not lying to a man you're lying to the Holy Ghost what happened that fire was on a throne around the Throne of lightning and voices and rainbows and so on the rainbows in Peter's heart oh Hallelujah the brother Brown said it going to happen again oh little all you little rot you God firebomb your heart and put himself inside of there same old outside man same old face same old hands whatever but God failed those prophets wasn't much to look at they had long beard and wrinkled face but they had D sh of the Lord hallelujah glory to God amen glory to God are you with me Moses 40

that Ambassador and we read the scripture he said as my father send me so send I you you're not getting a ticket from somebody overseas or some commission from somebody Jesus give the commission he said go to all the world we under commission we are anointed and commission oh give the Lord a shout oh I am anointed and commission to do what I'm doing H Hallelujah going into all the world you my Witnesses after the hly come upon you what is a witness it's an ambassador it's to come and witness something the whole power of Heaven is right in your hands why do we set and the church is Barren and we set dormant is because we don't recognize these things if the United States sent me to Russia as an ambassador to nation of Russia if they have officially sent me to Russia all the power of the United States has is behind me my word is just as the same as the United States if I have been recognized as an ambassador Oh Glory to God so when when when Elijah said not even green or Jew will fall till I call for it go to back that up because the whole of Heaven that's omnipotent speaking that's a man surrender to God then but said wait till them seven Thunders after the voices of that group they're going to slice and cut they could shut the heavens they could do whatever they want to do [Applause] it's the Thunders going to be H his voices this is the [Applause] message then we will be seated if God has sent us to be his ambassadors all the powers in heaven all that God is all the angels all his powers stand behind our words if we are correctly ordained sent Messengers to the people God has to honor his word oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm almost done hallelujah went in a farm and he saw a tree so what kind of tree is that he saw five different kind of fruits on it this say is an orange tree I see Grapefruit Tangerine tangelo lemon all kind of fruits he said oh yes they're grafted he said now what anything with Citrus life we live in it that's very good I stopped I looked again I said brother John I see I want to ask you something next year all those sit fruits like lemon and tangerine and grapefruit that that that will drop off it will bear oranges he said no no no no no no no it will bear its kind the one that get a lemon Branch will produce lemons the one that have the Tangerine will produce tangerine and I thought you said it was an orange tree yes but did it quit bearing oranges no when the original tree puts out an original Vine it will be orange oh Hallelujah another original branch is coming forth a lot the interpretation will be grafted in grafted in crafted in crafted in crafted in but if that orange tree put for another original Branch it will produce the original Fruit are you ready when that tree puts forth another original Branch there will be a book of Acts wrote behind it not a book of talk sit down a minute the Bible called the book of Acts not a book of talk is the acts of the Holy Ghost and the apostles and if that Branch put forth another tree it's it's is another book of ACT written behind it what you're talking about Silver and Gold Have I None such as have I given un to you Peter had some something he was CED but he denied Christ he he denied Christ three times and whatnot but when that power hit him he was anointed with God he could tell a man I have something I have something I have something man didn't give it and man can't take it away oh give the Lord and shout if the church give it to you they can take it back if the association give it to you they can take it back if some Minister give it to you they can take it back but when God give it to you [Applause] now watch now watch watch I am the vine okay I'll skip that watch now how do we get into that body by one Spirit 1 Corinthians 12 and by one Spirit we all baptized into one body and the spirit is the Life of Christ is that right the Life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life amen and if that life is laying in the seed the seed is the word and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it bongs to bring that seed to life hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my Hallelujah so the seven angels message is who up the Seven Seals calling the 11th Hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay the first hour receive the even time message restore back that same thing again if that tree put for another Branch it will bear the original Fruit and there's got to be a restoration of all these things at the end of the vine so what this is a branch this is a plant here this is a stem and I have all kind of branches but right to the top our original Branch going to pick up and that's is where you're going to get oranges at watch there has got to come forth a restoration an evening light to light up and make it right it will come out of the vine not a denomination that grafted into it but the original production of the word and it comes for in the evening time and watch no matter how much you preach here we go whatever you do amen it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be Vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world so there has got to comfort a power here we go the Holy Spirit himself to Ren or vindicate or prove to make manifest what he predicted would happen amen so right now we in talk mode prophesying again from Revelation 108 to1 amen until God come to manifest his word so I can't prove nothing up to anybody or say I'm better than this one no I'm waiting because power going to come Luther has it power Wesley got his power the Pentecost got the power we going to get ours and we are waiting upon that and the power is not the thing really it's the seed is the main thing because if power come and the seed is not right what going to happen amen amen amen amen the close come on so many says if the Lord will take evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him amen but that's up to you that's right that's right amen you've got something to do the that overcome shall inherit all things see how quiet it get when it's up to you Hallelujah Jos could sit down and say Lord all is mine Lord send aass and and clean clean for me that kind you praying God for your house to get clean house get clean with a broom and you pick up the paper and you sweep in here and you clean in here that's how your get clean God can give you strength to clean your house but if you expect an angel to come down to assist you with your sweeping keep on waiting Hallelujah all right you you you you you'll be keeping on praying it's just that that prayer will not be answered in other words you're wasting time get cracking and get it clean up don't mean to rebuke anybody that's up to you it's something you got to do they that overcome will inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready you see God could not push you through a pipe and pull you out on the other side and say blessed he that overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just push you through but you have got to make decisions for yourself I had to make decisions for my myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to God oh hallelujah praise God but God is the creator living in you giving you all the power and you are in possession of anything that he had so it is in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shun evil to flee to righteousness to walk away from temptation all malice hatred Strife envy and so forth come away from it for it takes him from your heart oh Halle dear brother sister if you haven't got the Bap of Holy Ghost this morning run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can oh hallelujah hallelujah the disciples had power but didn't have faith to move the power and that's what the matter with the church today the people today is not a lack of power no it's a lack of faith to move the power what is it you have got to get the word and watch you have got to get with the word and get yourself killed out I am persuaded that many of us friends here we go have received the Holy Ghost but we receive enough Holy Ghost ghost to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill a bit of you so if you watching movies movies movies what chance God have to put anything in your mind because you caught up in that movie world you caught up in that magazine world you call it in that Noel world and God have no place to inject himself but as you die out and all the no had move this way the movie start to move out where and God start to move in movies move out his
