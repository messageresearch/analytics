[11:05] grateful to God for all things and I
[11:07] pray that God would be with you in a
[11:09] special way amen so I trust them that uh
[11:14] just one
[11:15] second praise the
[11:27] Lord yes so tonight I want to read a
[11:30] scripture from St John
[11:33] 15 Luke 5:116 and St John 15 we want to
[11:38] read two scriptures tonight Luke 5:116
[11:41] one verse there and it says speaking
[11:44] about Jesus and he withdrew himself into
[11:48] the Wilderness and
[11:50] prayed I repeat and he withdrew himself
[11:55] into the Wilderness and prayed in John
[11:59] 15 15 Read from verse one I am the True
[12:02] Vine and my father is a husband man have
[12:05] a branch in me that beareth not fruit he
[12:07] take it away and every branch that bear
[12:09] fruit he pth it that it may bring forth
[12:12] more fruit now you are clean through the
[12:15] word which have spoken unto you abide in
[12:19] me and I in you as the branch can bear
[12:22] fruit of
[12:23] itself except it abide in the vine no
[12:27] more can ye except you abide in me
[12:29] I am the vine you are the
[12:31] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[12:34] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[12:37] for without me you can do nothing if a
[12:41] man abide not in me he is cast forth as
[12:44] a branch and a withered and Men gather
[12:47] them and cast them into the fire and
[12:50] they be
[12:51] burned if he abide in me and my words
[12:55] abide in you you shall ask what he will
[12:59] and it shall be done unto you here is my
[13:02] father glorified that you bear much
[13:04] fruit so shall you be my disciples may
[13:07] God bless his word and I pray that this
[13:11] word tonight will be a blessing to
[13:13] you brother
[13:15] BR if Jesus was slain before the
[13:18] foundation of the world it taken four
[13:21] years before it actually
[13:23] happen but when God spoke it back
[13:27] here every word of God is
[13:29] steadfast it's
[13:32] immutable it cannot fail and when God
[13:36] slay a son before the foundation of the
[13:39] world he was just as much slain then as
[13:43] he was at Calvary it's a finished
[13:45] product When God says so but remember
[13:50] when the lamb was slain your salvation
[13:53] was included in the sacrifice because
[13:56] the Bible says that your name was
[13:59] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[14:01] before the foundation of of the
[14:04] world what about
[14:06] that that then what are we going to do
[14:10] it is
[14:11] God that showeth Mercy it is God that
[14:17] called you note he's not talking about
[14:19] your faults your fears your failures
[14:20] your family background he's talking
[14:22] about God it is God that showeth Mercy
[14:26] it is God that called you it's God that
[14:30] chose you in Christ before the
[14:33] foundation of the world Jesus said you
[14:36] never chose me I chose you and I knew
[14:41] you before the foundation of the world
[14:43] there you are so see that takes the
[14:47] scare out of you so he said this
[14:50] revelation will take the scare out of
[14:52] you let's continue Hebrews 6 reading
[14:56] from verse
[14:57] 13 Paul
[14:59] speaks for when God made promise to
[15:02] Abraham because he could swear by no
[15:05] greater he swear by
[15:08] himself
[15:10] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[15:13] and multiplying I will multiply the and
[15:16] so after he had listen patiently
[15:21] endured he obtained the
[15:23] promise for men verely swear by the
[15:26] greater and oath for confirmation is to
[15:30] them an end of all
[15:32] Strife wherein God willing more
[15:36] abundantly to show unto the ears of
[15:38] Promise the immutability of his counsel
[15:42] confirm it by an
[15:44] oath this is the bom here that by two
[15:48] immutable things in which it was
[15:50] impossible for God to lie we might have
[15:54] a strong consolation who have fled for
[15:57] Refuge to lay a hold upon the Hope set
[16:00] before us which hope we have as an
[16:02] anchor of the Soul both sure and
[16:06] steadfast which enter it into within the
[16:09] veil so there two things when God speaks
[16:13] his word it is good as done so we have
[16:17] the confidence tonight that God can't
[16:20] lie he will keep his word to you and I
[16:24] now let's continue here now today we see
[16:28] the same holy spirit that was Upon Jesus
[16:30] working in the church confirming
[16:33] everything that God said what a
[16:34] marvelous hope it builds up in us to
[16:38] think that we are his children and
[16:41] blessed of his presence and now he is
[16:43] here with us as in infallible proofs and
[16:46] brother read the scripture we read about
[16:49] that the immutable thing which is
[16:51] impossible to go to line he said what a
[16:53] marvelous promise two immutable things
[16:57] God can't like and be gone if God has
[17:00] made a promise in his Bible here we
[17:03] believe the Bible to be the infallible
[17:05] word of God and if God has made a
[17:07] promise in this Bible we have the
[17:09] consolation to know it is impossible for
[17:12] God to lie therefore when we see he
[17:15] promis it in the Bible We Believe It
[17:17] soul body and spirit because it is
[17:21] impossible for him to lie now if there's
[17:25] any fault it's not is in us not in God
[17:28] for God is obl ated to his word so just
[17:32] think just think for a
[17:33] moment whenever God
[17:36] speaks he established his law which is
[17:39] his word and he himself can't break it
[17:43] if he is quiet if nothing's been said
[17:45] nothing being spoken he's just there as
[17:47] Elohim with his thoughts but once his
[17:50] thoughts become expressed it's
[17:54] infallible so but was saying here it is
[17:56] impossible an impossibility
[17:59] is practically the same word as can't
[18:02] change it has to stay the same it is two
[18:06] immutable things we have two things
[18:08] first is his word said he would do it
[18:11] then second is sworn oath what type of
[18:14] people should we be why should we be
[18:17] tossed about and run about and taken the
[18:20] things of the world praise God listen to
[18:23] this part now he said we want to be the
[18:26] oldfashioned type that would take God at
[18:28] his word and call those things which
[18:30] were not as though they were if God said
[18:33] so that settles it now here it is
[18:36] healing of the body doesn't become a
[18:38] fiction it becomes a reality the baptism
[18:41] of the Holy Spirit doesn't become an
[18:43] emotional workup substance it becomes a
[18:47] reality of the indwelling presence of
[18:49] the Lord Jesus Christ to change the
[18:53] life now I ask some questions here that
[18:56] I wrote down here does prayer affect
[19:00] God that's prayer influence
[19:03] God that's prayer move
[19:06] God why do we have to
[19:09] pray why would Jesus pray all
[19:12] night why would Jesus pull himself aside
[19:16] in the wilderness in a desert place to
[19:21] pray and I have here when God speaks his
[19:25] word it becomes his law a law that that
[19:28] cannot
[19:30] change he
[19:32] himself limits himself to his own word
[19:37] and that is why the word is
[19:40] God he cannot break his own word he
[19:44] cannot violate what he has established
[19:47] he is not a man that would lie you can
[19:50] trust you can rest you can stand on his
[19:54] word and he will not fail you brother
[19:57] Gideon spoke on Wednesday night and the
[19:59] power of one and what a
[20:02] powerful inspiration Revelation the
[20:05] power of one and it brought me to my
[20:08] mind as a young Christian when I found
[20:11] this quote about your majority in God I
[20:14] remember praying I said Lord I'm a
[20:15] majority that was that was quite
[20:17] something it felt special to me it felt
[20:21] that I didn't need a whole bunch of
[20:22] people around me to be a Christian and
[20:24] to stand I as an individual am a
[20:27] majority in God and brother B said this
[20:31] I say this with all my heart as a
[20:33] Christian minister tonight if every soul
[20:36] that's in the United States would turn
[20:38] to God with all their heart with all
[20:39] their soul and believe him I will say
[20:42] that the cancer are trouble everything
[20:44] in America the problems would be settled
[20:47] right there that's right but when you
[20:49] have got so much mixup just think what a
[20:52] little teen1 40 at 1% of 100 would be
[20:55] the people who really believe in Divine
[20:57] Healing just just think of the battle
[20:59] you have to you got in the opposition
[21:02] and people think it's fake you got
[21:04] people who think it's some crazy
[21:06] something and all these other things you
[21:09] got to come back with so you see we are
[21:11] on the small side as far as the eyes is
[21:14] concerned or mental conception here we
[21:17] go but in the eyes of God we are in the
[21:21] majority because one is the majority
[21:25] with God so just think tonight your one
[21:29] prayer don't see us p and SMY and have
[21:33] no effect no you tonight a majority in
[21:37] God so B was talking about Abraham right
[21:41] and Abraham got strength and he's
[21:44] talking about uh sking down his Spirit
[21:47] into the church and give the church a
[21:48] baptism holy ghost that brings strength
[21:49] into the church Martin Luther John
[21:52] Wesley the Pentecostal move that's being
[21:55] you see and watch God cannot defile his
[21:58] own laws he has to keep his own law so
[22:02] God cannot disobey his own laws he
[22:05] cannot anull his own law and then in
[22:08] order to be God so we see God coming
[22:12] down to become a man to die God could
[22:14] not die as a spirit because he would not
[22:16] die he could not die he's Eternal he
[22:19] could not die but God could not could
[22:22] make himself in such a way that he could
[22:24] feel pain he could feel and suffer God
[22:28] could not suffer as the eternal spirit
[22:30] but when he became man he could suffer
[22:33] feel the pain and The Temptations that
[22:36] man went through like Adam Eve in the
[22:38] garden everyone else since so he had to
[22:42] become that in order to fulfill his own
[22:46] law to take upon himself his own law so
[22:49] I want you to understand where prayer
[22:50] fits into this whole order of God God is
[22:53] God he's omnipotent he's all powerful he
[22:56] could intervene he could do whatever he
[22:57] want to do but he put a law in prayer to
[23:01] work something to accomplish something
[23:04] that it cannot be accomplished outside
[23:07] of prayer 1 Thessalonians 5:17 said pray
[23:10] without ceasing through
[23:12] prayer through prayer God can bring a
[23:15] revelation of his will for our lives and
[23:17] that Jesus pray thy will be done on
[23:19] Earth as it is heaven we don't know
[23:22] God's will automatically we wasn't born
[23:24] with a with a revelation of the will we
[23:25] had to seek that prayer invites God to
[23:30] intervene in Earthly
[23:32] Affairs Philippians 4:6 the scripture we
[23:35] have read several times be careful for
[23:37] nothing but but in everything not
[23:41] something in everything in Natural
[23:44] Things home things economic things
[23:47] Financial things emotional things
[23:49] grocery things work things in everything
[23:53] by prayer and supplication with
[23:56] Thanksgiving so prayer pray supplication
[23:59] pleading begging asking with
[24:02] Thanksgiving don't just do like if go to
[24:04] Santa Claus with Thanksgiving you got to
[24:07] be grateful you got to be thankful you
[24:08] got to be appreciative of where you are
[24:11] what God has blessed you with and you're
[24:12] making your request known let your
[24:14] request be known un God I'll read the
[24:15] whole scripture again be careful for
[24:17] nothing this is Philippians 4:6 but in
[24:19] everything by prayer and supplication
[24:22] with Thanksgiving let your request be
[24:24] known unto God that's an order prayer
[24:27] brings help in a time of need Hebrews
[24:31] 4:16 Bible say let us therefore come
[24:33] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[24:34] may obtain mercy and find Grace to help
[24:37] in time of need he Amplified for that
[24:39] say let us then fearlessly and
[24:40] confidently and boldly draw near to the
[24:43] throne of grace the Throne of God's UNM
[24:46] merited favor to us sinners that we may
[24:48] receive Mercy for our failures and find
[24:50] Grace to help in good time for every
[24:52] need appropriate help and well time help
[24:55] coming just when we need it so God
[24:59] placed prayer as a means to access his
[25:02] presence and power God put prayer as a
[25:05] means of fellowship with him so God
[25:08] wants his people to pray familiar quote
[25:10] and when Israel got so taxed in such a
[25:12] condition that they got no further their
[25:14] time was fulfilled and their burdens lay
[25:16] further than they thought then they
[25:18] begin to pray and when they begin to
[25:19] pray God begin to hear it was time for
[25:23] God's word to be fulfilled so AMR and
[25:25] Joseph saw that it was time for the word
[25:28] to fulfilled they went to pray to God
[25:31] let me read it again when AMR and Jose
[25:35] saw that it was time for the word to be
[25:37] fulfilled they went to prayer to God you
[25:42] know when I came in this message 1975
[25:43] next going be 50 years from me and I saw
[25:46] certain prophecy that was prophesied at
[25:49] that time as a 17 18 year old boy I
[25:52] found some of those things almost so out
[25:56] uh outlandish to believe that this will
[25:59] come to pass here it is we are in
[26:03] 2024 and a woman standing as going up to
[26:07] be president of America of a vision that
[26:10] P prophesied since
[26:12] 1933 here we are so seeing the Visions
[26:16] coming to pass seven Visions which you
[26:18] say must come to pass before Jesus comes
[26:21] again and we are closing in on that last
[26:24] Vision if you could see it that way when
[26:26] are we going to begin to pray
[26:28] because we can't change what is to
[26:31] happen we can't change that all that
[26:34] dwell on the earth we cannot change the
[26:37] Los Angeles going to sink and the
[26:39] earthquakes and the hurricanes and all
[26:42] the disasters that is lined up and pile
[26:44] up the bums to fall we cannot change
[26:48] those things but we can get line up with
[26:51] this word so when amam and yuset saw
[26:54] that it was time for the world to be
[26:56] fulfilled they went to prayer to God and
[26:59] it is usually here we go those who pray
[27:03] is the one who got the burden the one
[27:06] who gets something it is those who pray
[27:09] that's ordain of God to do so you cannot
[27:11] measure Yourself by another church
[27:13] member that could be just that a church
[27:15] member if you are part of this bride
[27:17] body you have to line up in the word one
[27:19] is a majority in God James 5:16 almost
[27:23] done James 5:16 confess your fors one to
[27:26] another and pray one for another that
[27:28] you may be healed the effectual fervent
[27:32] prayer of a righteous man of you that
[27:34] much your prayer tonight is not in
[27:37] vain this this in the Amplified confess
[27:40] your faults confess to one another
[27:42] Therefore your faults your slips your
[27:44] false steps your offenses your sins and
[27:47] pray also for one another that you may
[27:50] be healed and restored to a spiritual
[27:53] tone of mind and heart the earnest there
[27:56] we go heartfelt
[27:58] continued prayer of a righteous man
[28:01] makes tremendous power available dynamic
[28:05] in his working and then I close let me
[28:07] share this
[28:09] here Jesus
[28:12] understood the placing of the branches
[28:16] in God's
[28:17] economy and that is why Jesus said I am
[28:20] Divine he understood his place as Divine
[28:25] he knew that through the branches
[28:28] fruit will come forth according to God's
[28:31] original intent for man because God
[28:34] placed man to have you often hear about
[28:37] Isaac said jurisdiction of this Earth we
[28:40] wouldn't we wouldn't give jurisdiction
[28:42] in heaven we were given jurisdiction in
[28:44] Earth so the laws of the earth is what
[28:48] God subject himself to which is that the
[28:51] kinsman redeemer and become man and a
[28:54] Kinsman the laws of the earth so the
[28:57] laws of the Earth requires that true
[29:00] here we go the branch on the earth
[29:03] produces the
[29:05] fruit and Jesus is saying my father he's
[29:08] a man that's trim and cut he's the
[29:10] husband man I am the vine you are the
[29:13] branch you have to connect to me to
[29:16] bring fruit and without me you are
[29:18] nothing and if you don't want to connect
[29:21] to me you will be dealt with you'll be
[29:24] burnt all right so without me you can't
[29:27] do anything
[29:29] prayer makes us Vine
[29:31] dependent submissive to his word and
[29:35] will and I have this written here prayer
[29:39] affects and
[29:41] changes the one who prays so friends I
[29:44] want to challenge you
[29:46] tonight to talk to the
[29:48] Lord to see yourself as being a majority
[29:52] in God
[29:53] to you're not looking for the whole
[29:55] church to be behind you you are a
[29:59] majority in God you have access to him
[30:04] if you fail him and you fall short you
[30:07] have access to repentance and submission
[30:10] to him submitting to his will because
[30:14] you we have to see the fruit of God In
[30:16] Our Lives why would Jus say if you aband
[30:19] in me and I would aband in you you shall
[30:22] ask what you will now if we take it from
[30:26] the standpoint God knows all things he
[30:29] he knows I don't have to ask him because
[30:30] he know what I have need of no he said
[30:33] ask it shall be given he said seek he
[30:36] shall find he said knock and the door
[30:38] shall be open asking seeking knocking it
[30:41] shows you dependent it come like a
[30:43] little child and you promise the child
[30:45] something you bring sweet or sweets or
[30:48] or biscuit or cake and the child is so
[30:50] excited when you come home in the
[30:52] evening that child is expectant that
[30:54] child is happy that child is looking for
[30:57] what you have promised and this is what
[30:59] God expect from us he promised the Holy
[31:01] Ghost he promised Revival he promised
[31:03] breakthrough and deliverance there are
[31:05] some people who would Loaf and we just
[31:07] hanging there doing nothing they're
[31:09] waiting for the for the for the for the
[31:11] whole uh Chariot to get moving and then
[31:13] jump on they are they are putting no
[31:16] effort no labor no no but Jesus pull
[31:19] himself aside have you pulled yourself
[31:22] aside when are you going to pull
[31:24] yourself aside we caught up and and this
[31:26] is the age of of faith Facebook and
[31:28] WhatsApp and everything to to to take
