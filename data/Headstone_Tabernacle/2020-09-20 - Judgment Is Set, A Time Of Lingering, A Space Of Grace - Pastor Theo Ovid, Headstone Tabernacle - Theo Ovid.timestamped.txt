[36:07] praise god that's just the word
[36:09] oh god faith that is not tested cannot
[36:11] truly be trusted
[36:13] so god have to be able to test our fate
[36:15] to have their proof the question was
[36:17] asked when the son of man commit not
[36:19] shall be fined deacons elders churches
[36:21] steeples and message churches he said
[36:23] when one son of man cometh
[36:26] on the earth and this is after the son
[36:27] of man had revealed himself
[36:30] and to the angel of the shish of
[36:31] laodicea he said buy of me gold tried in
[36:34] the fire that you may be rich
[36:37] he said now these people have plenty of
[36:39] gold
[36:40] but it was the wrong kind of a goal
[36:42] that brought men lives and destroyed
[36:45] them it was the goal that wiped and
[36:47] twisted human character for its love was
[36:50] the root of all evil
[36:52] the love of it root of all evil but
[36:54] there is a goal first peter 1 7 that the
[36:56] child of your faith being much more
[36:59] precious than golden parachute the goal
[37:01] of god is a christ-like character
[37:04] produced in the fiery furnace
[37:07] of affliction
[37:08] that is the right kind of a goal and
[37:10] praise somebody's another quote brom
[37:12] says when a man is half the holy ghost
[37:14] he'll be christ-like in his trial he
[37:16] will christ like his wife his family
[37:18] everywhere he go be christ-like i don't
[37:20] care what takes place he'll be
[37:22] christ-like because it's christ in the
[37:23] man isn't that right so you say you
[37:25] better come before it's too late
[37:28] and buy amigo try on the fire and then
[37:30] you will truly be rich are we getting it
[37:32] listen to me naked physically we came
[37:35] into the world but naked spiritually we
[37:38] will not
[37:39] leave it we are going to take something
[37:41] with us what that something is all we
[37:45] can take with us nothing less nothing
[37:46] more so we have better be real careful
[37:49] now to see that we take something that
[37:52] will make us right before god what will
[37:54] we take with us we will take our
[37:56] character brother that is what we will
[37:58] take with us now what kind of character
[38:01] will you take with you will it be his
[38:03] whose character was molded by suffering
[38:06] in the fiery furnace of affliction or
[38:08] will it be the softness of this
[38:10] characterless laureation people it's up
[38:13] to each of us for in that day every man
[38:16] shall bear his own burden
[38:18] i want to repeat that one in that day
[38:20] every man shall bear his own burden oh
[38:24] praise the name of the lord wherefore
[38:26] coming from among them and be separate
[38:28] see at the lord and touch not the
[38:30] unclean thing and i will receive you i
[38:32] will be a father unto you and you shall
[38:34] be my sons and daughters here the lord
[38:36] almighty there is a price to pay for
[38:39] those garments and that and that is the
[38:41] price of separation and repeat that one
[38:44] there's a price to pay for those
[38:47] garments and that is the price of
[38:49] separation oh glory to god and anoint
[38:52] thy side with thyself that don't mind
[38:54] the sea he does not say that you have to
[38:56] buy this ice out oh no there is no price
[38:59] tag on the holy spirit receiving the
[39:01] spirit by the works of the law or by
[39:03] hearing of faith galatians 3 2. here we
[39:06] here we go now
[39:07] of the word
[39:11] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:14] you can never have your eyes open
[39:18] to a true revelation of the word a man
[39:20] without the spirit is blind to god and
[39:23] his truth how we thank god for his
[39:25] presence this morning
[39:27] hallelujah and i want to read the
[39:28] scripture and there's some revelation
[39:30] chapter four
[39:31] uh verse one and as i and this after
[39:34] this i looked and behold a door was up
[39:36] in heaven and the first voice which i
[39:38] heard was a trumpet talking with me
[39:41] which said come up hither i will show
[39:43] thee which must be a rafter and you know
[39:44] the prophet typed this as the bride the
[39:46] rapture and immediately i was in the
[39:48] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[39:50] heaven and one sat on the throne he was
[39:52] sat and was looked upon like a jasper
[39:55] and a sad iron stone and there was a
[39:57] rainbow wrong about a throne in the
[39:58] sight like unto an emerald i run about a
[40:00] throne were 420 seats upon the seats i
[40:03] saw 420 elders sitting clothed in white
[40:06] rain meant and they had on their heads
[40:08] crowns of gold and out of the throne
[40:10] proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
[40:12] voices and there were seven lamps of
[40:14] fire burning before the throne which are
[40:16] the seven spirits of god and this is the
[40:19] verse you want to get to now and before
[40:20] the throne there was a sea of glass like
[40:23] onto a crystal and in the midst of the
[40:25] throne wronged above the throne there
[40:27] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[40:30] behind and here's the prophet now
[40:32] interpreting this sea of glass where the
[40:35] sacrifice is washed that's what that sea
[40:37] of glass represent that we are washed
[40:39] don't forget that he said wash by the
[40:42] water of the word then you have got to
[40:44] hear the word before you can enter there
[40:47] because only one way you can approach it
[40:50] and that's by faith and faith come by
[40:53] hearing the word so hearing the word is
[40:55] more than just hearing the word hearing
[40:57] the word is to produce a fate that you
[40:59] could go further oh praise god all
[41:01] things of god is of faith isn't that
[41:03] right washing your conscience not to
[41:06] meet a man not to meet father not to
[41:08] meet mother not to meet a baby he said
[41:10] no watch but the first thing we got to
[41:12] come is god's avenue of approach will be
[41:15] washed when we hear the word of god so
[41:18] every service you hear in the world
[41:19] you're being washed your mind being
[41:21] washed hallelujah you get mixed up with
[41:24] all kind of things out there but you get
[41:26] the word this morning and it washes you
[41:28] it cleans you cleanse your conscience
[41:30] your heart your mind isn't that right by
[41:32] faith we are walking grace god what god
[41:35] did for you that's right you believe god
[41:37] you believe on god as soon as you are
[41:39] sorry you already forgive him oh glory
[41:41] to god soon as you're sorry for what you
[41:43] do you're already forgiven isn't that
[41:45] right as i was speaking to a brother
[41:46] yesterday kind of get a little mixed up
[41:48] on it i said look brother if you said
[41:50] something to hurt your wife's feelings
[41:52] immediately you feel sorry for her
[41:55] you're sorry you did it you already
[41:57] repented in your heart that's right but
[41:59] you've got to go and tell her about it
[42:01] you've got to go and say honey i'm sorry
[42:03] i said that
[42:04] then you have totally repented now
[42:07] that's the way it is with god a man that
[42:09] go and say i hurt your feelings don't
[42:11] make any difference i tell i'm sorry but
[42:13] i'm not you're a hypocrite see that's
[42:15] right you will never be received by god
[42:17] you have got to thoroughly
[42:19] be sorry for your sins
[42:22] then when you know that you're sorry for
[42:24] your sins then repentance and baptism
[42:27] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[42:28] remission of your sins you shall receive
[42:30] forgiveness and receive the holy ghost
[42:32] it is that simple god make it simple
[42:35] notice here this sea of glass is like
[42:38] unto crystal and the sea of glass is
[42:40] symbolized by the brassy this is a
[42:43] glassy and mo in heaven and moses
[42:45] brought made a brazen altar because god
[42:49] told moses what you see in heaven make a
[42:50] reflection on the earth and revelation
[42:53] the book of symbols so all these symbols
[42:55] in the book of revelation is a
[42:57] reflection of god's plan intent and
[42:59] purpose he hides it in symbols isn't
[43:00] that right he said you know what brah
[43:02] speaks of judgment he made a brass
[43:04] serpent a serpent means sin already
[43:07] judged isn't that right no we are the
[43:10] lava and you notice this lava was empty
[43:12] and was clear as christian why because
[43:14] the church has already been redeemed
[43:17] now we learn later on that's the
[43:20] scripture we read which is revelation 15
[43:23] that he called him the tribulation
[43:25] saints in the 15th chapter and any quote
[43:28] in the scripture we read i saw another
[43:30] angel i saw another sign in heaven great
[43:32] and marvelous seven inches having the
[43:34] seven last plagues for in them is filled
[43:37] the wrath of god and i saw a sea of
[43:39] glass mingled with fire now watch they
[43:43] have gotten the victory over the beast
[43:45] over his image over the map over the
[43:47] number of his name and stood on the sea
[43:49] of glass having the harps of god he said
[43:52] notice tribulation period so these are
[43:54] the saints tribulation saints they
[43:56] overcome the beast they overcome his
[43:58] name they overcome this number but
[44:00] they're still in the tribulation oh
[44:02] glory to god they should overcome self
[44:04] they can overcome and get the holy ghost
[44:06] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[44:09] you say watch we have got to come this
[44:11] gentile church into this word
[44:13] sea of glass
[44:15] water water of the word and recognize
[44:18] the word the way it is written then the
[44:22] sacrifice is received and filled with
[44:24] the holy ghost from the inside shining
[44:27] through the light of that age from here
[44:30] it goes out to the holy place into the
[44:31] star you get it now notice at the end of
[44:34] the age when he saw the sea of brass
[44:36] clay of crystal
[44:38] that's revelation chapter four it was
[44:40] clear as crystal the word had been taken
[44:43] from the earth raptured it was clear as
[44:46] crystal that's it what's the
[44:48] representation the rapture clears
[44:50] crystal no more blood the churches was
[44:52] over now in revelation 15. here we go
[44:56] the remnant of the woman's seed that's
[44:58] the foolish villages now
[45:00] that's the church people in this message
[45:02] that is those who don't receive the
[45:04] atonement in his fullness that is those
[45:06] who reject the cat path the head path of
[45:09] the capstone oh glory to god the head
[45:11] part of this message reject it
[45:14] hallelujah that is where all them but
[45:16] i'm talking about the holy spirit said
[45:17] many true ministers shall misunderstand
[45:19] that prophet that's all that inside of
[45:21] there too oh glory to god god has sent a
[45:24] prophet for us to misunderstand him but
[45:26] he has sent a prophet for us to get
[45:27] clarity of vision and purpose that we
[45:30] could hit the target oh glory to god
[45:32] hallelujah and in revelation 15 the
[45:35] remnant of the woman's seed which was
[45:37] the tribulation saints
[45:40] that went through the tribulation was
[45:43] found standing on the sea it was filled
[45:46] with fire blood red blazing licking
[45:49] forth the fire of god they have gotten
[45:51] the victory over the beast's room over
[45:53] his number over the letter of his name
[45:56] over his image the confederation of
[45:57] churches but had come out and through
[45:59] the preaching of moses and elijah those
[46:01] two prophets that will appear to israel
[46:03] to pull out their group then the
[46:04] tribulation since back then that time
[46:06] was brought in the church is done
[46:08] raptured now but remember the wife is on
[46:11] the throne the tribulation period now
[46:15] these tribulations spirit saints that
[46:18] come up that went through great
[46:20] tribulations the church will not go to
[46:22] the tribulation don't they already in
[46:24] glory
[46:25] here is the tribulation saints the
[46:27] sanctified one
[46:30] and then he said
[46:31] it being mine and your fault that they
[46:33] never heard the word they never heard it
[46:35] and rejected it if they rejected it they
[46:37] went on to hell they was cast into outer
[46:40] darkness because they rejected the word
[46:42] but if they never heard it god the
[46:44] tribulation period comes to them so
[46:46] there are people that i hear the word
[46:47] people that will be saved give me
[46:49] eternal life right your own judgment but
[46:50] tribulation
[46:52] hallelujah there are those who know they
[46:53] have to get the holy ghost they know
[46:55] they have to press on to god and they
[46:57] just ignore it they prefer to listen and
[46:59] read and understand and they'll seek the
[47:01] lord as what's required of us to ask god
[47:03] to fill with the holy ghost he get the
[47:05] holy ghost to them that ask him isn't
[47:06] that right notice now these saints
[47:08] washed by the same word because it's the
[47:11] same altar it's the same sea of glass
[47:14] it's the same word you know those remind
[47:16] me of all israel heard moses heard the
[47:19] message but they didn't mix the word
[47:21] with fate so it did not profit them they
[47:24] have books they have tapes but it's not
[47:26] inspired and that's why you have to come
[47:29] and get in the spirit even if you're
[47:30] sitting at home you can't say it's not
[47:32] full you have to sit in a way and you're
[47:34] hearing in a way that god could speak to
[47:36] you that you could receive from your
[47:38] father isn't that right now we
[47:40] we never took the word to them that's a
[47:42] reason we never took the word to them we
[47:44] are going to be held responsible so we
[47:46] we will not be able to catch all the
[47:48] peoples the church that's got the truth
[47:50] because they've got to go through the
[47:52] tribulation they're not the same that
[47:53] died back down there in the church ages
[47:55] they come up
[47:56] out of the great tribulation but the
[47:58] great tribulation is yet future after
[48:01] the church goes home
[48:03] so friends it's not just coming to
[48:05] church i'm going back home right
[48:07] there's a great tribulation that is
[48:08] coming for the escape and then they are
[48:11] the elected they are going to be the
[48:13] escape ones oh hallelujah so it's not
[48:15] good to say having victory over the
[48:17] beast over rome over the mark over the
[48:19] confederation of churches and they will
[48:21] press us out and we are standing for
[48:23] them or we are taking them back and have
[48:25] no power to go to rapture waste them
[48:26] time you'll be end up at tribulation
[48:28] saints you understand i'm saying because
[48:29] these tribulation saints had the victory
[48:32] over the beast had the victory over his
[48:34] mark the victory over his name is not
[48:36] right over the confederation of churches
[48:38] but they still make it to the rapture or
[48:40] give the lord a shout in the house oh
[48:42] here we go now
[48:44] and there's some 10 versions there's
[48:45] something beautiful doing these two
[48:47] changes there are two
[48:49] spirits working almost alike right down
[48:52] through here one is the nomination the
[48:56] other one is the holy ghost and jesus
[48:58] said these two spirits were deceived
[49:01] would be so close that they see the very
[49:03] elective possible these two spirits
[49:06] here we go
[49:07] american their people
[49:11] for future judgment
[49:14] let me say that again there are two
[49:16] spirits at work
[49:18] one is the holy ghost and i ain't
[49:20] talking about pentecostal and
[49:21] denomination i talk about people in the
[49:22] message one is the holy ghost and one is
[49:25] denominational spirits in the message
[49:27] that binding the people from the holy
[49:29] ghost just two
[49:31] because the message supposed to be a
[49:33] channel of the holy ghost because the
[49:36] seven angels come from eternity to
[49:38] gather the scattered word and tie it
[49:40] back in the word to bring down the holy
[49:42] ghost and holies couldn't couldn't flow
[49:44] just like that because they were going
[49:45] to bring us back to pentecostalism
[49:48] so the holy ghost disguise itself as the
[49:50] word on books and tapes
[49:52] to break a platform that the secret
[49:55] could be the word is in the pride and
[49:57] then that word turn to spirit and power
[49:59] and produces the kingdom is within you
[50:02] then you by revelation no it's not to go
[50:04] here have it and here have it and this
[50:06] minister have it and this one don't have
[50:08] it and you know this for sure this might
[50:09] just have it that's all that is nonsense
[50:12] then you gonna recognize that the word
[50:14] the secret is under the nose of the
[50:16] devil the word is in the bride
[50:18] hallelujah you have to have that first
[50:20] before you see any miracle you have to
[50:22] have faith in that first before you see
[50:24] the rainfall you have to believe that
[50:27] word is in you you have to receive that
[50:28] word the fullness of the atonement every
[50:31] promise god could drop on you you could
[50:33] receive it thunder's new name seven
[50:35] seals anything that got adoption
[50:37] character trials testing perfect faith
[50:40] hallelujah any promise god jump on you
[50:42] you could take a hold of it it is minds
[50:44] it is minds it is minds this happens it
[50:46] is still minds oh glory that happened it
[50:48] is still yours oh holly do you believe
[50:50] that so the two spirits are mocking
[50:53] their people for future judgment
[50:56] mark it now
[50:57] and i see this morning the judgment is
[50:59] set
[51:00] oh hallelujah god can't cancel it
[51:03] he can't reverse it
[51:05] oh god your name is not being written
[51:08] god is not feeling inspired this morning
[51:10] to put your name down in the book he put
[51:12] your name before the foundational world
[51:14] that before they get married before you
[51:16] had children before your sin before he
[51:17] was even born your name was in the
[51:19] lamb's book of life and you have to find
[51:21] you wherever you are in whatever
[51:23] condition you win to bring you out not
[51:26] to stay where you are but to bring you
[51:28] or do you believe that these two spirits
[51:31] are marking their people for future
[51:34] judgment put them mark upon them that
[51:36] sigh and cry hallelujah they will be
[51:39] sealed put them back upon those that
[51:41] reject it they will be they will be
[51:43] judged oh hallelujah so marking going on
[51:46] right now
[51:47] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[51:50] seal that faith in your soul seal that
[51:53] revelation that god put inside of you
[51:55] isn't that right thank you lord jesus
[51:57] now watch
[51:59] he says
[52:00] he said uh

[52:05] that
[52:06] we just might as well admit it this
[52:09] anglo-saxon people
[52:13] let me read it again

[52:18] you know that we might as just well
[52:20] admit it
[52:21] that this anglo-saxon people it is

[1:04:39] silence jesus was on earth they wanted
[1:04:43] to know when he would come he said even

[1:05:32] on the mountain he said this being when
[1:05:34] it's completed is the servant of god in
[1:05:37] the church of god that's going in the
[1:05:39] rapture not this sermon the man preached
[1:05:41] this being oh glory to god what being
[1:05:44] fate
[1:05:45] virtue
[1:05:46] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:05:48] bradley kindness charity that
[1:05:50] formed in you is what go in oh
[1:05:53] hallelujah
[1:05:54] not your body is what inside of you god
[1:05:56] putting that magnetism inside of you
[1:05:58] does he make this isn't he coming for oh
[1:05:59] glory to god he's okay what kind of skin
[1:06:01] is wrong with it could be chinese skin
[1:06:02] red skin white skin black skin it
[1:06:04] doesn't matter what skin beyond that
[1:06:06] covering it is the treasure is it
[1:06:08] earthen vessels the
[1:06:10] the vessels is not important the color
[1:06:12] of the hair not important the color
[1:06:14] texture or race or country that's not
[1:06:16] important is what's in there are the
[1:06:19] treasure have to be in earthen vessels
[1:06:20] goddess and a prophet to america he said
[1:06:22] behold i sent him to the world elijah
[1:06:25] the prophet and he shall turn the hearts
[1:06:27] he has done it your glory to god he put
[1:06:29] it in books and tapes that way he can
[1:06:30] see it is leading the messages
[1:06:32] hallelujah because every prophecy has to
[1:06:34] come from that prophet who gave the lord
[1:06:37] a shout
[1:06:39] so a man can't claim to take the book
[1:06:41] and eat the book and say something
[1:06:42] different what the prophecy he's a liar
[1:06:45] he's a false prophet
[1:06:46] he's a false messenger he's a false
[1:06:48] minister if you eat the book you could
[1:06:50] only speak the words from the book
[1:06:52] that's why he said the spirit the
[1:06:53] prophet and the bride will say the same
[1:06:55] thing i challenge any man the same
[1:06:57] different from what the book say i don't
[1:06:59] want no explanation give me a revelation
[1:07:01] what has already been said identified
[1:07:03] back in the scripture you see all the
[1:07:05] international preachers out there they
[1:07:06] don't push by them
[1:07:08] it's motivation teaching all kind of
[1:07:10] crazy stuff what kind of weird nonsense
[1:07:13] vision false prophecy all meeting in
[1:07:15] general meeting this all kind of
[1:07:16] foolishness we can come here this last
[1:07:18] day and have that nonsense and go by
[1:07:20] your imagination you had a dream last
[1:07:21] night why are you with your dream last
[1:07:23] night bring it to the word
[1:07:24] bring your dream to the word bring your
[1:07:26] revelation to the word bring your diss
[1:07:28] and your ex bring it to the word let's
[1:07:29] let's see and check it out by the word
[1:07:32] oh there's a word bride you know
[1:07:33] oh hallelujah have to be in the word has
[1:07:36] to be in the scripture oh glory to god
[1:07:38] thank you jesus
[1:07:40] hallelujah hallelujah so god has this
[1:07:43] all to himself it's a secret and that's
[1:07:47] the reason there was silence in heaven
[1:07:49] for a space of half an hour and seven
[1:07:52] thunders uttered their voices and john
[1:07:53] was forbidden to write it the coming of
[1:07:55] the lord that is one thing he hasn't
[1:07:57] revealed yet how he will come
[1:07:59] and when he will come
[1:08:01] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:08:03] what abraham
[1:08:04] you are shown to revive it in every type
[1:08:06] in the bible therefore the entire bible
[1:08:09] is the revelation of god's mystery
[1:08:11] in christ one goal he wanted to achieve
[1:08:13] on the bible the believers in the bible
[1:08:15] has been in tight expressing what god
[1:08:18] great goal is
[1:08:19] and now in the last days he has revealed
[1:08:21] it and he shows it now remember this
[1:08:24] this
[1:08:25] seven seal
[1:08:27] seventh seal
[1:08:29] is the end of time
[1:08:30] of all things
[1:08:32] the things written in the seven seals
[1:08:34] books sealed up
[1:08:35] of the plan of redemption before the
[1:08:37] foundation of the world it every it
[1:08:39] every bit ends
[1:08:41] it is
[1:08:42] the end
[1:08:44] so once the seven seal breaks
[1:08:47] the end is loosed
[1:08:50] how many sees that this morning
[1:08:53] don't study that this is 1963 now
[1:08:57] don't study that
[1:08:58] a thousand years is one day
[1:09:03] a thousand years is as one day
[1:09:06] with the lord
[1:09:09] half a day is 500 years
[1:09:11] i wouldn't go wrong there in that
[1:09:12] mathematics
[1:09:14] but what i mean to say 50 60 years is a
[1:09:17] short time
[1:09:18] so when god about to do his thing he
[1:09:20] break it and walk away
[1:09:22] it started to unfold now
[1:09:24] nothing could stop it the kingdom is
[1:09:26] about to be restored satan is about to
[1:09:28] be repo the
[1:09:30] deposed
[1:09:32] he about to be kicked out laker fire
[1:09:35] that's his destination
[1:09:36] the saints already on their way to the
[1:09:38] rapture it was so convinced in his eyes
[1:09:40] i believe the bride is called she is
[1:09:42] sealed into the kingdom of god
[1:09:45] oh glory he already see you sealed into
[1:09:48] the kingdom
[1:09:49] nobody can pull you out of that kingdom
[1:09:51] when god sealed you into the kingdom
[1:09:54] no man could put you there no book could
[1:09:56] put you there it takes god himself to do
[1:09:58] that
[1:09:59] so the seventh seal is the end
[1:10:01] watch
[1:10:03] is the end
[1:10:04] is the end of the struggling world
[1:10:07] is the end of struggle in nature
[1:10:09] is the end of everything
[1:10:11] is the end of the trumpets
[1:10:13] is the end of the vials is the end of
[1:10:15] the earth it even ends time
[1:10:19] because the angel said time shall be no
[1:10:22] more
[1:10:23] time itself runs out with this seventh
[1:10:26] seal
[1:10:27] so we are kicking
[1:10:28] and we are moving on something so
[1:10:30] temporary time is running out
[1:10:33] time is runs on you
[1:10:34] to do what god called you to do
[1:10:37] do you know what god called you to do or
[1:10:39] you're wasting time
[1:10:41] oh hallelujah he said everything runs
[1:10:43] out in this time the at the end of this
[1:10:47] seventh seal it is the end of the
[1:10:49] trumpets it's the end of the vials it
[1:10:51] even the ends it evens the austrian of
[1:10:53] the millennium that's on the seventh
[1:10:54] seal and then you compare what it is
[1:10:56] it's like firing a rocket into the air
[1:11:00] and that rocket explodes here it goes up
[1:11:03] and explodes again they put on five
[1:11:04] stars and one of those stars explode and
[1:11:07] blow the fiesta from it and then this
[1:11:08] one of them explodes another five stars
[1:11:11] so each one just exploding exploding and
[1:11:14] then keep going exploding exploding you
[1:11:16] can't stop it
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] that's
[1:11:21] what's the seventh seal it just ends the
[1:11:24] time for the world it's in the time for
[1:11:26] this the time for that isn't the time
[1:11:28] for this it ends it ends the time
[1:11:30] everything just ended up in that seventh

[1:11:52] rest

[1:27:53] he brought a prophetic vision for the
[1:27:55] bride
[1:27:56] the vision is what puts it right yes
[1:28:02] that's why a man could have money and no
[1:28:04] vision he go nowhere with his money
[1:28:06] a man could have vision and no money and
[1:28:08] the vision produces money to fulfill the
[1:28:10] vision because the vision is a big
[1:28:11] vision
[1:28:14] vision is more important than you think
[1:28:17] the bible says without a vision
[1:28:19] my people perish

[1:28:48] because you're reaching but you know
[1:28:49] where you're heading
[1:28:51] you have a vision
[1:28:52] sometimes the vision is sealed
[1:28:54] it's sealed in you
[1:28:56] because you don't want anybody to mess
[1:28:58] up your vision
[1:28:59] you tell your vision to the wrong people
[1:29:01] there's messier
[1:29:02] sometimes you have to keep them all shut
[1:29:04] and keep silent
[1:29:06] until the vision begin to unfold

[1:41:09] earrings which were in the ears and
[1:41:11] brought them to aaron and they received
[1:41:13] them at the hand and fashioned it with a
[1:41:15] graven tool
[1:41:16] after he had made a molten calf and said
[1:41:19] these be thy gods or israel which
[1:41:22] brought thee out of the land of egypt
[1:41:25] you know how almighty god will feel
[1:41:27] about that
[1:41:28] after they saw power
[1:41:30] after they saw the display of moses a
[1:41:33] man of god
[1:41:34] moses
[1:41:36] lingering
[1:41:37] a delay a time and the bible talked
[1:41:40] about the time will come when ben will
[1:41:42] say the lord delay is coming
[1:41:45] and they're gonna be chopping one at up
[1:41:46] this minister fighting that one that one

[1:42:07] oh glory to god
[1:42:09] so you see what
[1:42:11] time does do
[1:42:12] that's why my rams talk about
[1:42:15] how
[1:42:16] he didn't want them to see the shortcut
[1:42:18] to the promised land so you get them a
[1:42:20] long way
[1:42:21] to give them a time
[1:42:24] of lingering to see what's in their
[1:42:25] heart because only time does unfold
[1:42:28] what's in people's heart

[1:45:07] jesus hallelujah
[1:45:10] praise god and the prophet said in the
[1:45:12] second coming when that time comes when
[1:45:14] the church finds his brotherly love when
[1:45:16] they find his whole decency when they
[1:45:17] should find his place in christ he will
[1:45:19] call to the other members of the body
[1:45:21] come and rejoice with us
[1:45:22] god want the church
[1:45:24] to love him
[1:45:25] i'm on the home stretch here now
[1:45:28] and i believe but abandoned now
[1:45:30] that all these things
[1:45:32] and they will get the inspiration from
[1:45:34] the text from
[1:45:35] the title from
[1:45:37] has a time of lingering
[1:45:40] waiting
[1:45:42] so it's not just i guess that up i just
[1:45:44] imagine that
[1:45:46] this is what he said you know i believe
[1:45:49] that all these things has a time of
[1:45:50] lingering waiting
[1:45:52] and it's waiting for a time
[1:45:55] for the scripture to be fulfilled
[1:45:58] everything gets right
[1:46:00] everything in order waiting and many
[1:46:02] times we get impatient like a child
[1:46:04] create anticipations and many times jump
[1:46:07] way ahead and that hinders the work
[1:46:10] until the work gets caught up we must
[1:46:12] move hear how reverently
[1:46:15] have a purpose in the heart
[1:46:17] that god if he's with desire to use us
[1:46:19] in such such but wait till he makes the
[1:46:22] opening
[1:46:23] for he has to go ahead of us
[1:46:27] you see that's the matter with the
[1:46:28] pentecostal today they have to
[1:46:29] manufacture something they can't wait
[1:46:31] they just can't wait
[1:46:34] oh my they want to wait for christ would
[1:46:36] have to come to his church he promised
[1:46:37] to do it god promised to multiply them
[1:46:40] but they had to wait until god's time
[1:46:42] and that's the matter today they don't
[1:46:45] want to wait till god's time
[1:46:48] i want to say this now don't feel are
[1:46:50] you ready
[1:46:51] you say when christ comes to his bride
[1:46:53] who glory
[1:46:55] when christ come they're not texts
[1:46:58] there's no word there's that message
[1:47:00] when christ comes to his bride she will
[1:47:03] be a virgin like mary was
[1:47:05] for god
[1:47:06] will not bring christ through the womb
[1:47:08] of a
[1:47:10] and neither will he bring a bride he
[1:47:12] can't bring his word through the whole
[1:47:15] of his word
[1:47:16] so what is he talking about here now
[1:47:18] when christ come to the bride that's
[1:47:20] your husband that is the spirit
[1:47:23] when the spirit comes to the bride
[1:47:25] hallelujah she will be a virgin he is
[1:47:28] not going to bring the bride
[1:47:31] god will not bring christ to the womb of
[1:47:33] a prostitute
[1:47:34] a he's not going to do that so you
[1:47:37] have to be a virgin to the word but
[1:47:39] christ has to come to you
[1:47:41] to manifest who you are oh hallelujah
[1:47:44] moses was not vindicated or activated
[1:47:47] until he met the pillar of fire when he
[1:47:50] met the pillar of fire it brought the
[1:47:52] seed in him to life
[1:47:54] and then he was activated as anointed
[1:47:57] prophet to deliver the people out of the
[1:47:59] hands of egypt
[1:48:01] could you imagine he went along there
[1:48:02] with older anointed
[1:48:13] because you see them have a power and
[1:48:15] you can't have they have power and you
[1:48:16] don't have they will finish you with
[1:48:18] their power you have to have the power
[1:48:20] to challenge their power oh glory to god
[1:48:22] you have to have the power of god so
[1:48:24] that is why when they show down mistakes
[1:48:25] moses gets excited and run away he stand
[1:48:28] up right there because he know that
[1:48:29] power he has his greater his snake eat
[1:48:31] up his their own two words oh glory to
[1:48:33] god are you with me now remember it's
[1:48:35] not intellectual that fellows have you
[1:48:37] know janice and jambres is not
[1:48:38] intellectual people you know them not
[1:48:40] reading texts you know them dealing with
[1:48:42] spirits
[1:48:43] and lucy lucifer behind them so moses
[1:48:46] have to have god behind him because the
[1:48:48] battle continues
[1:48:52] the battle that begins in heaven
[1:48:54] continues on it
[1:48:56] oh every force every war is battles
[1:48:58] spirit the watch
[1:49:02] he said no the pentecostal he said no
[1:49:04] right now
[1:49:05] he said
[1:49:06] uh i warned right at this time now it
[1:49:09] just happened
[1:49:10] so it could identify its presence talk
[1:49:12] about people
[1:49:14] it just happened
[1:49:15] it just happened
[1:49:17] it just happened so it could identify
[1:49:19] its presence among you
[1:49:22] but will not be used in a great way
[1:49:26] until
[1:49:27] this console begins to tighten up
[1:49:30] and when it does
[1:49:32] he said the pentecostal could
[1:49:33] impersonate anything that can be done
[1:49:34] but when that time comes
[1:49:36] when the squeeze come down
[1:49:38] then you will see what you are seeing
[1:49:40] temporarily will be manifested
[1:49:43] in the fullness of its power see i must
[1:49:46] continue evangelism as i was
[1:49:48] commissioned i must continue on
[1:49:49] evangelism and friends of mine keep
[1:49:51] still just keep moving on for the awe is
[1:49:54] approaching swiftly when something is
[1:49:57] going to be done
[1:49:59] so don't worry
[1:50:01] don't try to bring the pressure on
[1:50:02] yourself
[1:50:03] no no don't try to do crazy stuff to
[1:50:05] bring attention
[1:50:06] and boil the press to the precipice the
[1:50:08] press say come here
[1:50:09] hallelujah the press coming to you to
[1:50:11] you to die yeah like the press coming
[1:50:13] the pressure coming on your personal
[1:50:15] life for you to have a revival in your
[1:50:16] own home in your own heart
[1:50:19] let's continue here
[1:50:20] now watch
[1:50:22] sin is a transgression of god's law
[1:50:24] by breaking one word
[1:50:26] tonight my brethren
[1:50:28] your soul is overheld on a chain
[1:50:33] and that chain
[1:50:34] is
[1:50:35] not some theological seminary teaching
[1:50:37] that chain is not some denomination or
[1:50:39] some creed that you're living by that
[1:50:41] chain is god's word and jesus gave the
[1:50:43] human race his word to live by and eve
[1:50:45] only broke one little link of it a chain
[1:50:48] is no stronger than his weakest link
[1:50:50] when you take one word out that was
[1:50:51] first in the book jesus came in the
[1:50:53] middle of the book he said man shall not
[1:50:54] live by bread alone but by every word i
[1:50:56] proceeded of the word of god that was in
[1:50:58] the middle of the book the last of the
[1:51:00] book said whosoever shall take one word
[1:51:03] mistranslate one word take one word out
[1:51:06] of here i will take his part from the
[1:51:08] book of life you are passing over hell
[1:51:12] hanging on the word of god
[1:51:14] hear this word here now
[1:51:15] if you go get anything else get this
[1:51:17] don't you let somebody
[1:51:20] squeeze something into you that is not
[1:51:22] dusty at the lord
[1:51:25] so i must gamble with a minister
[1:51:27] and a prophet
[1:51:29] apostle a pastor evangelist
[1:51:32] i don't care how much faithfulness they
[1:51:34] are how much anointing they say they are
[1:51:36] if it's not the same lord go with it
[1:51:39] paul says if an angel comes from heaven
[1:51:40] preaching any other gospel let him be a
[1:51:42] curse
[1:51:43] oh my hallelujah
[1:51:45] thank you lord jesus
[1:51:47] oh glory to god hallelujah he said if
[1:51:51] you can just keep quiet
[1:51:52] remember if he call you for this there's
[1:51:55] nothing can keep you from happening
[1:51:57] there's not enough devils in torment but
[1:51:59] what god's word will make manifest you
[1:52:01] are born for a purpose and nobody could
[1:52:03] take your place you might have
[1:52:04] impersonators everything else but they
[1:52:06] could never take your place god's word
[1:52:08] will triumph it cannot fail there is
[1:52:10] very christian understand knowing that
[1:52:12] and trials will come and seems
[1:52:14] everywhere to you but remember god has a
[1:52:16] purpose it will work out right
[1:52:19] as that woman that should have my woman
[1:52:20] said all is well it will be well o
[1:52:23] praise the name of the lord
[1:52:25] thank you lord jesus they want to take a
[1:52:27] shortcut to heaven as much as the world
[1:52:29] as they can take you can't take any of
[1:52:31] it there are no shortcuts you come the
[1:52:33] way of calvary you come the way of the
[1:52:35] brass altar you come the way of the
[1:52:37] brazen serpent you die you actually die
[1:52:40] you say oh god why can't i see it right
[1:52:43] you die
[1:52:44] literally die to yourself die to the
[1:52:46] things of the world and are born on you
[1:52:48] there are no shortcuts this woman she's
[1:52:51] part of the word the bride she's
[1:52:53] watching for her life to manifest the
[1:52:54] word he said can't you see brethren i
[1:52:56] hope that didn't go over you the body is
[1:52:59] waiting for which is the word is waiting
[1:53:01] for the life which is the spirit to
[1:53:03] confirm it or make it alive that is what
[1:53:06] you're waiting for
[1:53:07] then he says
[1:53:08] 1914 the world went to war there had
[1:53:11] never been a peace since
[1:53:12] wow
[1:53:14] he said holding back what holding the
[1:53:17] greeting i saw in a vision the whole
[1:53:18] thing become to destruction holding the
[1:53:20] atomic holding the war so that they
[1:53:22] don't destroy themselves until the thing
[1:53:24] come to destroy it until israel returns
[1:53:26] back and gets itself together and then a
[1:53:27] message will go to israel and she will
[1:53:29] be sealed with that seed of the holy
[1:53:31] ghost
[1:53:33] not just mysteries revealed to israel
[1:53:34] you know
[1:53:35] but sealed
[1:53:37] with the holy ghost
[1:53:39] and if the israelites have to be sealed
[1:53:40] what about the bride
[1:53:42] how are we going without being sealed
[1:53:44] and if that man with the ink on right
[1:53:45] about the holy ghost
[1:53:47] why so is this same angel coming down
[1:53:49] with the holy ghost the seed of the
[1:53:50] living god then he quote ephesians 4 30
[1:53:52] grievous the holy spirit whereby you are
[1:53:54] sealed until the redemption
[1:53:56] he said we crack jokes
[1:53:58] but god will give and a kong for every
[1:53:59] idol what you speak
[1:54:01] because brother you are letting the
[1:54:02] devil come in and put it over your eyes
[1:54:04] the first thing you know here we go
[1:54:06] almost done the time will come
[1:54:10] when god will give a message
[1:54:12] and you'll be sealed in or out of the
[1:54:14] kingdom
[1:54:16] oh my god
[1:54:18] what does that have to do with joining a
[1:54:19] group
[1:54:20] or join a church or saying my past is
[1:54:22] your husband which is which which is not
[1:54:24] not even balanced

[1:57:57] make many here tonight who seek god to
[1:57:59] find him in this hour we asked it in
[1:58:01] jesus name and while we have our heads
[1:58:03] bowed i wonder now if you would want to
[1:58:06] make another step towards that
[1:58:09] if you would like to stand up and say
[1:58:11] i'm not ashamed
[1:58:12] though i belong to church i'm methodist
[1:58:14] baptist or pentecostal or whatever you
[1:58:16] may be i'm not ashamed
[1:58:18] i realize that i have trusted a whole
[1:58:20] lot what i know
[1:58:22] but never have i got to a place where i
[1:58:24] could fully believe the full gospel and
[1:58:27] to make it work in my life
[1:58:29] i've seen things i believe their
[1:58:31] promises i want to believe it but he
[1:58:34] told me if i did believe it this would
[1:58:37] work so there's something wrong with me
[1:58:38] it don't work
[1:58:40] i've tried to make it work but i don't
[1:58:42] do it
[1:58:43] and i'm ashamed of it and i want the
[1:58:45] world to know i want the people here to
[1:58:47] know that i'm sincere and i want it in
[1:58:49] my life i want to be a true witness for
[1:58:52] christ with the full gospel manifesting
[1:58:54] self running my life will you stand to
[1:58:56] your feet and say i want to be a witness
[1:58:58] i'm seeking god god bless you that's
[1:59:00] right jesus said if you're ashamed of me
[1:59:03] before man i'll be ashamed of you before
[1:59:05] the father
[1:59:06] now as these people it's pentecostal or
[1:59:08] methodist or baptist
[1:59:09] has these true things have you crossed
[1:59:11] that chasm until you know positive that
[1:59:14] you're standing in the presence of god a
[1:59:16] redeemed son and daughter of god and the
[1:59:19] signs and wonders not to make belief but
[1:59:21] the genuine
[1:59:23] article of god the holy spirit burns
[1:59:25] within you
[1:59:26] and what you say to this mountain it
[1:59:28] moves
[1:59:30] you believe that if it doesn't now's
[1:59:32] your time
[1:59:34] how do you know this my you said well
[1:59:35] i've stood before
[1:59:37] but if you're really hungry for god
[1:59:38] you'll keep on standing until it comes
[1:59:41] there's no end to it you're persistent
[1:59:44] like this year if you open woman she
[1:59:46] couldn't take no
[1:59:47] she wanted it really
[1:59:49] are you ready to stand anymore before we
[1:59:51] pray
[1:59:53] that beautiful song he was nailed to the
[1:59:55] cross for me
[1:59:58] on the cross crucified
[2:00:01] there he died for me i wanted brother
[2:00:03] branham i wanted god i really wanted my
[2:00:06] life i want to change
[2:00:08] i've lived a guest so i've lived i hope
[2:00:10] so and i want something i wanted
[2:00:14] if those apostles could hit that zero
[2:00:16] mark every time so can i
[2:00:18] that's what i say if it worked for the
[2:00:21] apostles
[2:00:22] it works now
[2:00:23] if it wants to happen it happens again
[2:00:26] if he is ever god he's still god
[2:00:28] he's the same yesterday and forever
[2:00:30] that's my campaign theme
[2:00:33] if your denomination don't believe in it
[2:00:35] let your denomination believe what they
[2:00:36] want to you believe the bible
[2:00:38] you believe it will you stand
[2:00:40] about eight or ten more stood up to him
[2:00:44] god bless you god bless you
[2:00:46] more standing more standing ah really
[2:00:49] sincere brother branham i want it
[2:00:53] something happened the other day you
[2:00:54] read the i heard the tape the seven
[2:00:56] thunders what time is it sir
[2:00:59] they it happened the other day
[2:01:02] you know these things
[2:01:04] the time is at hand church the time is
[2:01:07] at hand don't don't wait any longer
[2:01:10] see how do you know the rapture is not
[2:01:11] going on all the time first thing you
[2:01:13] know it'll be past one disappearing here
[2:01:15] and there it'll be gone the first thing
[2:01:17] you know and your judgment will strike
[2:01:18] the world you say well i thought this
[2:01:21] was too late now you remember they
[2:01:23] didn't know it until the day they
[2:01:25] entered into the ark and then it was too
[2:01:27] late the foolish virgin didn't know
[2:01:29] until she come back and found the wise
[2:01:32] virgin gone and she was left for the
[2:01:34] tribulation period
[2:01:35] no good teacher believes that the church
[2:01:37] the bride the church goes through the
[2:01:39] tribulation but not the bride
[2:01:41] the church goes through for purification
[2:01:43] sure on the sixth seal right israel does
[2:01:45] the same thing for the 144 thousand but
[2:01:48] not the bride
[2:01:49] there's the bride's forgiven she goes
[2:01:51] straight to glory in the rapture ryan
[2:01:54] she's my opinion the last member will be
[2:01:57] caught up one of these days
[2:01:58] it might come and you would know nothing
[2:02:00] about him remember it's a secret secret
[2:02:02] catching away you know come an hour that
[2:02:04] you think now you won't know anything
[2:02:06] about it she'll be gone be too late man
[2:02:09] you said i wished i would have stood if
[2:02:11] you ever intended to make a stand let
[2:02:13] this meeting in albuquerque let this be
[2:02:15] the time that you made the stand
[2:02:18] now if you really feel secured by christ
[2:02:21] you feel that you have got the holy
[2:02:23] spirit and the blood of jesus christ all
[2:02:25] the signs and promises is at your
[2:02:28] command
[2:02:29] and you see them manifested and working
[2:02:30] in your life and you know their truth
[2:02:33] if you sit there like that and you
[2:02:34] believe it i'll take your word for it
[2:02:36] that's up to you if you don't you should
[2:02:38] be on your feet
[2:02:39] but if you believe that and know that
[2:02:41] those signs and wonders that jesus said
[2:02:44] vindication of the messiah speaks to him
[2:02:47] if it isn't then you should be on your
[2:02:49] feet
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:53] god bless you
[2:03:00] i'm a stranger to many of you
[2:03:03] many of you has regarded me to be a seer
[2:03:06] i've said nothing about that you know
[2:03:08] that
[2:03:09] i've kept that's not the hour yet
[2:03:12] but you believe me now you believe me as
[2:03:15] god's servant
[2:03:17] have i ever told you anything in the
[2:03:20] name of the lord but what comes to pass
[2:03:22] if it's so say amen
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:25] it's never failed by the thousands of
[2:03:27] things
[2:03:28] never one time by what it's been true
[2:03:32] you know that the world around though
[2:03:34] you disagree with me
[2:03:36] many in theology i'm not a theologian
[2:03:40] i only speak what i hear and then when i
[2:03:42] hear it i look at the bible if it ain't
[2:03:44] recording the bible i wouldn't receive
[2:03:45] it but not one time has it ever been
[2:03:48] contrary to the word but with the word
[2:03:50] that's reason it's confirmed
[2:03:52] god vindicates
[2:03:54] now
[2:03:55] you hear me then if you believe
[2:03:57] me to be a messenger sent from christ to
[2:04:00] you you believe me if you're not in the
[2:04:02] kingdom of god you better press right
[2:04:05] quick
[2:04:07] it will not get better
[2:04:10] it will grow worse all the time
[2:04:13] i just mark that down
[2:04:16] just remember see whether that's right
[2:04:17] or wrong
[2:04:18] you see if it's going to be right or
[2:04:20] wrong it's not going to get better it's
[2:04:22] going to get worse it's going to get
[2:04:23] harder all the time the revival is gone
[2:04:27] you're only gleaning in the fields
[2:04:29] she's over
[2:04:31] how you say i disagree with that fine
[2:04:33] it's okay if you do that's all right
[2:04:35] that's my conviction that's my hearing
[2:04:37] from heaven
[2:04:38] i believe the lady of seeing age is the
[2:04:40] pentecostal age where she comes to the
[2:04:42] place of lukewarm
[2:04:44] and god spews her from his mouth that's
[2:04:46] where she's come right now the
[2:04:47] pentecostal movement has come to that
[2:04:49] place
[2:04:50] lukewarm
[2:04:51] not red hot
[2:04:53] not ice cold you're not cold in farming
[2:04:56] near they are you're high you're in the
[2:04:57] spewing stage and you're going
[2:05:01] jesus the only age he stood on the
[2:05:03] outside of the church
[2:05:04] their dogmas that put him out
[2:05:06] knocking trying to get back in the door
[2:05:08] lol i stand at the door and knock if any
[2:05:10] man will hear my voice
[2:05:11] i'm glad you've heard tonight now i can
[2:05:14] only ask you to stand he's looking at
[2:05:15] you jesus said that wherever two or
[2:05:18] three are assembling my name there i am
[2:05:20] in the midst of them if that isn't so
[2:05:22] there's no god there's no bible there's
[2:05:25] no sunrise there's no sunset there's no
[2:05:27] flowers there's no tree you're really
[2:05:29] not here
[2:05:30] you're in a dream life is not real
[2:05:32] you're not a human being so it's
[2:05:34] impossible for that to be so it's
[2:05:36] impossible for him not to be here
[2:05:39] and if you'll ask anything in my name
[2:05:41] faith believing he'll grant it to you
[2:05:43] now that's you now you stood for a
[2:05:45] witness that you wanted now in your own
[2:05:48] way the way that you pray the way that
[2:05:50] you want to i want you to say lord god
[2:05:52] in your heart now don't pay attention
[2:05:54] the the the campaign here will give you
[2:05:56] plenty time for this
[2:05:57] all the time you want now in your own
[2:06:00] way in your own way
[2:06:03] i know it's customary that one man
[2:06:05] stands there and stands the other kneels
[2:06:07] down this way but whatever way you want
[2:06:09] to i don't care what it is don't say
[2:06:11] lord let me do this let me do that and
[2:06:13] say lord fill me
[2:06:15] fill me with the holy spirit i'm sincere
[2:06:17] in this i mean it
[2:06:19] now if you do mean it it's got to come
[2:06:25] it's impossible for not
[2:06:27] he promised him and he's trying to press
[2:06:29] into your heart the only thing you just
[2:06:31] opened a little bit and say come on the
[2:06:33] inside and stand here but don't go
[2:06:35] around fool my private life
[2:06:37] see
[2:06:39] he wants you
[2:06:41] he wants all you are
[2:06:42] he won't ever compartment your heart he
[2:06:45] wants your private life he wants all
[2:06:46] your life
[2:06:48] he wants to be your lord lord's
[2:06:49] ownership he wants to own you so he can
[2:06:52] guide you
[2:06:53] directly
[2:06:54] take you use you are you willing to do
[2:06:57] that if you are he's wanting to come in
[2:07:00] or you wouldn't be standing there
[2:07:02] see
[2:07:03] so now is the hour for you to receive it
[2:07:05] now it's up to you now if you believe
[2:07:08] with all your heart it'll be settled
[2:07:10] from right now this will be a memorial
[2:07:12] night they probably will close these
[2:07:14] doors tonight you'll stay all night in
[2:07:16] here but if you do like this say lord
[2:07:19] i'm standing on my feet until you feel
[2:07:22] me according to your promise i'll never
[2:07:24] move from where i'm standing
[2:07:26] you mean business with god he'll get to
[2:07:28] business with you but until you do
[2:07:31] you're hammering lord will you give me
[2:07:33] the holy ghost night i don't feel
[2:07:34] nothing well maybe i'll try tomorrow
[2:07:36] night you're not going to get anything
[2:07:38] from god like that you've got to come
[2:07:41] desperate die
[2:07:43] then you get it
[2:07:44] right he promised it if it isn't what do
[2:07:47] you use your time for
[2:07:49] if that promise is not true
[2:07:51] that's how these things happen
[2:07:53] that's why i can stand and say to the
[2:07:55] world has the word ever failed god
[2:07:57] promised me in fact there's a kid
[2:08:00] that's the reason you say aren't you
[2:08:01] afraid of failing i'm never i'm always a
[2:08:03] failure he never does i don't speak my
[2:08:05] words i speak his that's reason always
[2:08:08] right
[2:08:09] that's the reason i asked the world show
[2:08:11] me one time it didn't come to pass
[2:08:14] show me one time of the thousands of
[2:08:15] things that he said not one time did it
[2:08:18] fail
[2:08:20] then it never will because it's god not
[2:08:23] man
[2:08:25] so god
[2:08:27] is here now
[2:08:28] christ is in our midst he's willing to
[2:08:31] give you the holy ghost if you're
[2:08:32] willing to accept it
[2:08:34] not pay the price the price is already
[2:08:36] paid the price was prayed this paid this
[2:08:38] afternoon 1900 years ago if you're
[2:08:40] willing to accept it if you are let your
[2:08:43] heart go now open up take out all fear
[2:08:45] all down raise up your hands to god and
[2:08:48] say lord god here i am i stand here i
[2:08:51] stand in the name of jesus christ i'm
[2:08:53] going to pray for you you pray too

[2:09:03] their feet
[2:09:05] i offer to you because they have stood
[2:09:07] and respond to the call
[2:09:09] they're seeking deeper things
[2:09:12] they're seeking more life
[2:09:15] after hearing that the blood of jesus so
[2:09:17] thoroughly cleanses
[2:09:19] that there's no more nothing that the
[2:09:21] complete word of god rests within them
[2:09:25] that the very command of their own voice
[2:09:28] is creating power because in them is the
[2:09:31] holy ghost
[2:09:32] and this holy ghost
[2:09:34] is a creator he makes things comes to
[2:09:37] pass because he speaks the word and the
[2:09:40] word spoken becomes god in action and

[2:09:45] ghost upon every one of them just now
[2:09:47] and deliver unto them lord in the power
[2:09:50] of the resurrection of christ the things

[2:26:13] ghost
[2:26:15] now you know that
[2:26:16] that's right
[2:26:17] jesus told peter the night of the

[2:26:23] brother
[2:26:25] trying
[2:26:26] well sure you accepted christ as your
[2:26:28] savior but when you're converted it's
[2:26:30] when you're really changed that's right
[2:26:32] and he wasn't changed yet he cursed
[2:26:33] before the lord and denied him and
[2:26:35] everything but after his conversion
[2:26:37] after thou art converting strengthen
[2:26:39] your brother that's right
[2:26:41] is that right that's what the scripture
[2:26:43] says anyhow
[2:26:44] that makes it right
[2:26:46] jesus told peter that had followed him
[2:26:48] he cast out devils and done miracles and
[2:26:50] everything said you're not converted yet
[2:26:52] but if you're converted then strengthen
[2:26:53] your brethren
[2:26:56] it's true now
[2:26:57] why don't you
[2:26:59] how could you turn down such a an
