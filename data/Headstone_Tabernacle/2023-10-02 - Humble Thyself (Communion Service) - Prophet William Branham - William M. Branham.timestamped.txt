[12:44] this evening
[12:57] amen
[15:27] e
[15:57] e
[16:27] e
[16:57] e
[17:27] e
[17:57] e
[18:27] e
[18:57] e
[19:27] e
[19:57] e
[20:27] e
[20:57] e
[21:27] e
[21:54] 8 or 8:30 and uh we'll give them a pray
[21:58] prayer card as they come in the door
[21:59] however they do it and um then we'll
[22:02] have a prayer line and pray for the sick
[22:04] and you see what the holy spirit will do
[22:06] I believe he'll do wonders if we'll just
[22:08] believe him am but we got to believe him
[22:10] for that now with all of our heart and I
[22:13] think that the great hour has arrived
[22:17] that when God in so much as we speaking
[22:20] this morning has showed us so much and
[22:23] brought us to a certain just up to a
[22:25] spot just to push over that little
[22:27] healing that's all you need and then
[22:28] away it goes uh going just like it was
[22:31] the same thing with the discernment same
[22:34] thing by the prophetic to watch I stand
[22:37] in Calgary I beg your
[22:40] pardon uh it was the Queen City down in
[22:44] Regina Regina and er bter was standing
[22:47] there and a bunch of us and the Lord had
[22:49] told me right there the platform that'll
[22:51] come to pass you know the very secret of
[22:53] their heart and that's righty and I
[22:55] never thought of that in that manner I
[22:57] walked up the platform that night with
[22:59] ER and started praying for the sick and
[23:01] you're coming man along just laid out
[23:04] his entire
[23:05] life first time it ever happened just
[23:07] like that in a moment in a healing
[23:09] service and then I looked out over the
[23:11] audience and hear it begin to come down
[23:13] over the audience and think oh when we
[23:15] reach the other side the half has never
[23:17] yet been told of the things to watch out
[23:19] and see things in people's life I don't
[23:21] say anything about it just let it alone
[23:23] see unless I'm really compelled to say
[23:26] something and I I look for this next to
[23:28] start like that see God in his own way
[23:31] his own Sovereign time to begin it and
[23:34] it'll it'll be another things that will
[23:36] be be Way Beyond any of these other team
[23:40] amen and I'm looking for that to happen
[23:42] and maybe I thought if I had a little
[23:45] healing service maybe next Sunday and
[23:46] then the following Sunday I'll probably
[23:48] be away with the kids and them because
[23:49] they got to go back and go to school and
[23:51] then the next Sunday of course I'm up in
[23:53] Chicago at the meeting up there and then
[23:56] um come back to the following Monday to
[23:59] leave on Tuesday for for Arizona where
[24:01] the kids get back to school well what'd
[24:04] you find
[24:05] [Music]

[24:27] porn now and all those little Brethren
[24:30] who are struggling
[24:32] hard and they feel like that we are

[24:56] doesn't know him they're both me
[24:57] Methodist ministers and um it's seen uh
[25:01] truth of word which the the organization

[25:18] waiting to see that light flash over
[25:20] their path you just keep flashing the
[25:23] light in humility sweetness that's all
[25:27] grow close to God by humbling ourselves
[25:30] yes don't forget this Tabernacle will
[25:32] lose its strength remember that this is
[25:35] a target where Satan's got every gun in
[25:38] Hell trained on he'll cause one person
[25:41] to do something it's contrary to watch
[25:42] the other things he's doing that he's up
[25:45] to it that's his business if he can get
[25:48] somebody to say something somebody to
[25:49] talk about another say well listen did

[26:08] down for that a sister and this talk and
[26:11] be real sweet and the first thing you

[26:14] service against because after all we're
[26:17] headed towards the setting of the Sun
[26:19] the Lord Jesus will be coming one of
[26:21] these days and you I think you'll be so
[26:24] s and so so sweet so uh there'll be 100
[26:30] 100 of 100% of the whole world will
[26:33] never know when that Rapture take
[26:35] place it'll just go so quietly that
[26:40] nobody know nothing about see and it'll
[26:42] be of course the little groups will say
[26:44] oh no so and so all they say it's
[26:47] fanatic mnch over there said a group
[26:48] left from over there and they that's not
[26:51] so they just gone out somewhere we've
[26:52] had that fanaticism see um while they
[26:55] say that little Tabernacle in a place
[26:56] called Jeffersonville there was so many
[26:58] of them members that's missing see they
[27:00] just play that up they say oh there's
[27:02] nothing to that to see like that it'll
[27:04] be passed and they won't know it across
[27:08] the nation will come those who are dead
[27:10] in Christ will rise first the Rapture
[27:12] will take place the church will be taken
[27:14] home and then the tribulation will set
[27:17] in and oh my we don't want to be here
[27:20] during that time I don't want to be here
[27:23] in the tribulation you know God forbid
[27:27] that any of us can ever be here during
[27:28] that time because he that's filthy is
[27:31] filthy still he that's holy is Holy
[27:33] still he that's righteous is righteous
[27:36] still there's no the lamb has come forth
[27:39] with his book of redemption and the
[27:41] bride has been taken out those who
[27:43] turned it down has to go through a
[27:45] tribulation period both Jew and Gentile
[27:48] what a time of tribulation I don't want
[27:50] that Lord sanctify me now that's good
[27:54] nazarine Doctrine in amen and and it's
[27:57] truth too it's truth that's
[28:01] right amen fill me now with your Holy
[28:04] Spirit Lord take all the world out of me
[28:07] now Lord don't is the old color brother
[28:10] said so I got my ticket in my hand it's
[28:13] already punched and when I come down the
[28:15] river that morning I don't want no
[28:17] trouble so that's about right I I don't
[28:20] want no trouble hold your ticket in your
[28:21] hand because we're going over just think
[28:24] of it the great time of redemption is at
[28:28] hand amen and now another thing
[28:32] brother uh what's his name up here at UD
[28:36] I think brother grim and another brother
[28:39] there that's pastoring there
[28:41] brother what Shanks or something like
[28:44] that brother s a pastor all together
[28:47] brother Snelling a pastor up at UD now I
[28:49] think their prayer meeting is on
[28:51] Thursday night Thursday night how you
[28:53] know it would be real night if we would
[28:56] slip up there on Thursday night and show
[28:59] those fellas a little Fellowship see and
[29:01] then when brother Jackson the times that
[29:03] he has his if we just do a little grbs
[29:06] together and go just keep praying keep
[29:08] digging don't stop just like when Elijah
[29:12] told him said dig ditches out there when
[29:14] you get down you hit an old Tim can and
[29:16] say I'm too tired throw it out the way
[29:18] and keep digging let's keep digging cuz
[29:21] we got to dig we just got the Dig that's
[29:23] all because if you if you expect to miss
[29:27] the tribulation you better start diing
[29:29] and now for myself I'm preaching to
[29:32] myself there I'm going to start digging
[29:35] deeper than I ever go because I feel
[29:39] like that in the nation and around the
[29:42] world that this ministry will again as
[29:46] it's known now about everywhere over the
[29:49] world I I must go again wife said to me
[29:53] other morning I said I w't you to go
[29:55] with me when I leave I'm going to leave
[29:56] around January PR the Lord Willl I want
[29:58] to take a complete World Tour all the
[30:01] way around amen come back and maybe have
[30:04] services in United States sometime next
[30:08] summer and she said I'm too old to go
[30:11] well I said I went when I about my last
[30:14] trip overseas is about 8 years ago and I
[30:17] feel like I'm in better shape now it was
[30:19] 8 years
[30:20] ago I know more about it now then we got
[30:23] on the subject if the Lord said I'm
[30:25] going to lot you 25 years you're not
[30:27] going to get feeble you be able to go
[30:29] and I'm going L you 25 years on Earth
[30:31] would you take from from birth to 25 or
[30:35] from 25 to 50 50 to 75 or 75 to 100 now
[30:39] any man is lot at any time on Earth will
[30:41] certainly do a most racial thing if you
[30:44] don't spend that time in service of God
[30:46] I don't care what he does if you're
[30:48] going to be a heartbreak for the women
[30:50] or so for you better take that young age
[30:53] that first 25 if you're going to be a
[30:55] carpenter a mechanic or something you
[30:57] better take the second 25 see but I was
[31:00] thinking about what about me what would
[31:02] I take I'd take from 75 to 100 I'd be
[31:06] smarter wiser i' be more settled I know
[31:09] more about what I'm doing I'm 10 eight
[31:12] or 10 years old than the last time I was
[31:14] overseas I won't jump in like I'm
[31:16] killing snakes I know more about it I
[31:18] know how is it like a dog fighting
[31:21] Theon see you know about how to take a
[31:23] hold of you don't jump in there scratch
[31:24] you up see know his tricks and watching
[31:27] what he does and we learn more about the
[31:30] enemy so we've got to find out all his
[31:32] techniqus and how he approaches and what
[31:34] he does learn these punches then you're
[31:37] trained to going on you see so I believe
[31:39] now I told wife I believe I'm better
[31:41] shape now once when it's 40 years old
[31:43] one over I'm 54 now I believe if I live
[31:46] and can still get around as good as can
[31:48] I I'm 100 if I Jesus would carry that
[31:51] long I'd be in better shape than I am
[31:53] now to go because you know more about it
[31:56] you know more about what to do and how
[31:57] to handle it how to handle the situation
[32:00] amen take a lot of people out if you're
[32:01] going to get operated on say say a new
[32:03] doctor just graduated the other day just

[32:07] an operation yet let him do it oh no you

[32:15] yet I don't want him putting on KNE on
[32:18] me I better to go down here and get so
[32:20] and so I know he's had a lot of
[32:22] operations he knows how to do it that's
[32:26] that's you think think about this but
[32:27] what about that soul I want somebody who

[33:17] over there in conjunction with the
[33:19] meeting at Middletown yes and I said I
[33:22] esteem the Servants of God and uh one of
[33:26] us I said whoever preaches it always
[33:29] does the other one good because the
[33:31] ministry is all inspired by the same
[33:33] spirit amen and uh there isn't any any
[33:36] selfishness or ambitiousness in me and I
[33:40] Delight to welcome the Ministers of God
[33:43] especially who are cooperating together
[33:46] with this and in it together with us I
[33:49] Delight to hear from them amen so I
[33:52] asked Dr Lee Bale I said would you
[33:54] Minister if brother brandham doesn't
[33:57] brother Brandon didn't he might have
[33:58] known this didn't say anything
[34:02] about so I asked brother Vale tonight if
[34:06] he would Minister for us in case that
[34:08] brother brandham didn't because he
[34:10] associated with him in the meetings and
[34:13] he knows about the way this way and
[34:16] we're glad to have brother veale I
[34:18] appreciate him and respect him as well
[34:20] as to do any of the other ministers and
[34:22] like I do all the others and so if he
[34:24] will come tonight and speak for us I'd
[34:27] be delighted to have him to do it God
[34:29] bless and let's pray for brother Vil
[34:32] some of you have never heard him and I
[34:34] trust that you pray for
[34:39] him I apologize to the audience I didn't
[34:42] know sit there did this is fixed up God
[34:44] bless you brother D it wasn't fixed up
[34:45] he said
[34:48] come good that's fine I'll get he myself
[34:51] brother B spoke of Any Time ahead of in
[34:53] the meetings and and so forth he managed
[34:55] the meetings for a long time and was
[34:57] fine Brother done a swell job and I'm
[34:59] sure this audience is always glad to
[35:01] hear Brother B when he speak Lord bless
[35:06] [Music]
[35:09] brother so much was said uh I couldn't
[35:13] say nothing to make it any better and I
[35:16] truly believe that it was the Lord that
[35:19] worked us out for brother Veil to bring
[35:22] this man amen after this morning yes so
[35:25] do I you see it has to work that way we
[35:28] we accept that from God yes well there's
[35:31] so many things he was saying I I I have
[35:33] 20 sermons go down here off what he said
[35:36] I was thinking here of one little
[35:38] illustration to back up what he said now
[35:42] we look at this watch to find out what
[35:44] time it is unless that every instrument
[35:47] in that watch is coordinating one with
[35:49] the other will never know the correct
[35:51] time amen is that right and that takes
[35:54] all of us all together if we want to see
[35:57] the third pool really do something for
[35:59] God it's coordination with every one of
[36:01] us together to Humble ourselves before
[36:04] God and confess our wrongs and pray and
[36:08] believe God for these things I truly
[36:11] believe that what brother B said is the
[36:13] truth that God will never put his spirit
[36:17] in Unholy unrighteous disobedient
[36:20] Temple it's got to come in the The Way
[36:24] of the cleansing of our heart from all G
[36:27] and iniquity that we might be pure
[36:30] before God that he might work his pure
[36:32] Holy Spirit through us to bring these
[36:35] things to pass I I think that when you
[36:38] go home tonight if you would read that
[36:40] little book of Jude you just learn a
[36:41] whole lot now of what brother Bale has
[36:43] said and he said and I earnestly contend
[36:47] for the faith that was once delivered to
[36:50] the Saints they got away from it how a
[36:52] man of corrupt mind and so forth had
[36:54] come in and beguile him away from the
[36:57] from the real things of God and God can
[37:00] only operate as we let him operate and
[37:05] so many wonderful things about saying
[37:07] you know people want power and really
[37:11] they don't know what power is amen they
[37:14] don't really know what what what goes
[37:16] with it the the Way Up Is Down always
[37:20] you if you want Power see how humble you
[37:23] can get just get away from all your
[37:26] worri thinking and humble yourself
[37:28] before God and then you got more power
[37:31] than the man that runs all over the
[37:32] building and makes a big lot of
[37:34] noise because you have been able to
[37:37] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[37:40] Christ to humble yourself before him
[37:43] that's really powerful you show me a
[37:46] church that's humble real humble not a a
[37:51] irant a church just a sweet Humble
[37:53] Church I'll show you a church that has a
[37:56] favor and power of God Amen that's the
[37:59] thing it takes hum humility humbling
[38:02] ourselves before God letting God just
[38:04] work to us you don't have to make a lot
[38:06] of
[38:07] noise uh sometimes as the farmer said he
[38:11] went out to the field with his wagon and
[38:13] every time he hit a bump it just rattled
[38:15] and went on but when he come back he hit
[38:17] the same bump didn't make no noise at
[38:18] all because it loaded with good things
[38:21] so I think that's about right that we
[38:24] get filled up with the good things of
[38:26] God that the fruit of the spirit might
[38:28] be known through us as he referred so
[38:30] much to First Corinthians 13 there how
[38:33] that though I give my body be burnt and
[38:35] have all these things and have not
[38:36] charity it's nothing prophets mean
[38:39] nothing you see we want to do that above
[38:42] all things it's our individual Souls
[38:44] that we're responsible before God see
[38:48] it's it's you going to heaven it isn't
[38:50] whether I go or he goes It's You Going
[38:52] see it you first and you've got to look
[38:55] this out and come sweet before the Lord
[38:57] and I've always found out that the man
[39:00] that humbles himself is the man that God
[39:02] exalts when you take a person with his
[39:05] chest out knows everything and you can't
[39:07] tell him nothing and he's arrogant and
[39:10] well that that's a person that never
[39:11] gets anywhere but you take that person
[39:13] that humbles themselves and walks
[39:15] sweetly I was talking to a man dur a DAT
[39:18] it's just organizing a church up at the
[39:21] uh uh pulled out of an organization that
[39:23] had been what brother Bose and then
[39:26] Church where they they had that great
[39:28] church there for so long and the Lord is
[39:30] Blessing and the people got to a place
[39:32] that they want to polish up like the
[39:34] rest them and want to throw it into an
[39:36] organization and when they did it just
[39:38] those humble Christians in there did not
[39:41] want that all their life have been
[39:42] taught against it so they walked away
[39:44] from it now they've got a group and the
[39:46] Lord has blessed them until they're
[39:48] coming in up into a big place now again
[39:51] bought a church now that puts up about 4
[39:53] 5,000 people and they're starting over
[39:56] and they come to me and said brother
[39:58] brand sitting right there in in the
[40:00] office of the church office the other
[40:02] day and he said one of the leaders
[40:04] brother the CL them said what must we do
[40:06] I said find a man to be the Shepherd
[40:10] that has no reputation all denomination
[40:13] just a real good janeline sweet humble
[40:16] brother that lives a life God will take
[40:18] care of the rest of him I said a good
[40:21] pastor that feed the sheep and be humble
[40:23] and than God will do the rest if you not
[40:26] some big know it all is coming he's
[40:28] going to put this in order and this has
[40:30] to be this way cutting things around I
[40:32] said it'll never work you just got
[40:33] through it that's it every piece in the
[40:36] church must work together and you must
[40:38] keep up your part of it so we can see
[40:41] what time we're living in we may be
[40:43] closer than we think we are now we
[40:45] appreciate by the veil don't we the Lord
[40:47] bless you by the veil thank you and we
[40:49] thank the Lord for bringing this great
[40:51] message to us tonight and got a note a
[40:54] few minutes ago one of the sisters had
[40:56] had something she wanted to tell in a
[40:58] dream if you just write it out tell me
[41:00] sister they give her some dreams that
[41:03] has been absolutely true we don't accept
[41:05] all dreams no no but when they're of God
[41:08] we want to know it it's God talking to
[41:09] it like everything speaks the tongues we
[41:11] don't believe it but when there's an
[41:12] interpretation comes that tells us
[41:14] something that's going to happen we see
[41:16] it happen and we thank the Lord for it
[41:18] see we want to keep it running smoothly
[41:19] sweetly and in order uh of the Lord so
[41:22] just remember that your part may be the
[41:24] main spring of it may be the little uh
[41:28] some little hand or some little part of
[41:30] the winding stem whatever it may be or
[41:32] it may be the hands on the face the
[41:34] clock it tells the time but whatever it
[41:36] is it takes us all working together in
[41:38] harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[41:41] to bring this to P just think if gifts
[41:44] is so great what we call power and Paul
[41:47] said though I have faith that I can move
[41:50] them and have not charity I am nothing
[41:55] amen amen think that and though you say
[41:58] well though I understand I wish TR know
[42:01] the Bible though I understand all the
[42:04] mysteries of God see and still go on
[42:08] good do it and have not charity I I'm
[42:11] know see I haven't got no wor yet see
[42:13] the main thing is love God and humble
[42:16] yourself with it I surely uh after all
[42:20] these years on the field and around the
[42:22] world and seeing different people I Al
[42:25] know a little bit about the gate to
[42:27] enter in at and if you want to get
[42:29] somewhere with God never let a irran
[42:32] spirit ever come around don't let No
[42:36] Malice come in no matter what anybody's
[42:38] done if they are wrong don't you never
[42:41] build up a complex against that person
[42:43] you'd be sweet and kind remember God
[42:46] loved you when you were in sin and if
[42:48] the spirit of God's in you you love the
[42:50] other person when he's in love just pray
[42:53] for them and love one another above
[42:55] everything love God and love one another
[42:57] and be humble with God and around one
[43:00] another and God will bless us and hard
[43:02] down what he will do usually when Church
[43:05] begins to get numbers and get to getting
[43:06] a little bigger or something like that
[43:08] then they get away from that real thing
[43:10] the real thing you know what brought
[43:12] these things to pass when I first
[43:14] started the Lord appeared to me down the
[43:16] river and told me that brother B saw
[43:18] that I believe in the paper in Canada
[43:19] many years ago where that angel of the
[43:21] Lord appeared on the river down there is
[43:22] on Associated Press Mystic light over a
[43:25] local Minister wild bapti and and you
[43:29] know what I did that when we had the
[43:31] tent meeting just across the street a
[43:33] tent that seated about or 2 200 people
[43:36] ministers come from Able work said
[43:38] brother come here minute not just a boy
[43:41] but or just a kid and he said how do you
[43:45] keep those people in one Accord they
[43:47] love one another till they I never seen
[43:49] people love one another That's the Law
[43:52] that's what this church was established
[43:54] upon on that Godly brotherly love for
[43:57] one another I've SE them even shake
[44:00] hands to one another leave in the place
[44:01] and cry like babies to leave one another
[44:04] they love one another that well and I
[44:07] could go to their house to Vis them and
[44:09] times the Bible was laying open and
[44:11] stain with tears coming at night time
[44:13] where fathers and mothers was gathered
[44:15] together and there little children
[44:17] around on the floor kneeling around and
[44:19] fathers and mothers on their knees
[44:22] crying and praying and I'd stand at the
[44:23] door and wait and wait and wait and they
[44:25] did stop praying I just sat down on my
[44:27] steps and start praying myself wait for
[44:29] see and that that was what and they love
[44:32] one another they love one another we
[44:35] used to stand and sing that old song
[44:36] blessed be the ti that binds our hearts
[44:38] in Christian love a fellowship of
[44:40] kindered mind is like to that above when
[44:43] we areer part it gives us inward pain
[44:46] but we shall still be jwn in heart and
[44:49] hope to meet again I say this with great
[44:52] joy in my heart to Christ many of them
[44:54] are sleeping around in these Graves mark
[44:55] and I waiting for that great
[44:57] Resurrection where we'll meet together
[44:59] again let not that Spirit ever depart
[45:02] from this place if it ever does then I
[45:04] don't care how eloquent your pastor
[45:06] might be how well he might bring the
[45:08] word of God the spirit of God is grieved
[45:11] away and we can have all things and
[45:13] fellowship in common love one another
[45:16] then God will work with us and we're
[45:18] keeping time that the people come by and
[45:20] say if you want to see a church that's
[45:22] really humble a church that really loves
[45:24] God droping up at that Tabernacle one
[45:27] time and watch them look at the care
[45:29] they have for one another the respect
[45:31] when the gospel is being preached how
[45:33] reverence how everything just in order
[45:36] that's then they can look and see what
[45:37] time we're living you'll see the spirit
[45:39] of God moving among you great signs and
[45:41] wonders and things will be taking place
[45:43] if the things working together it's
[45:45] telling the time but if it isn't working
[45:48] then time is stopped it won't tell the
[45:51] time no more so if we want to know what
[45:53] time we're living just start everybody
[45:55] working together in the gospel loving

[51:00] 23 for I've received of the Lord that
[51:03] which also I delivered unto you that the
[51:05] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[51:07] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[51:10] given thanks he break it and said take
[51:12] eat this is my budy which is broken for
[51:14] you this do in remembrance of me and
[51:17] after the same manner also he took the
[51:18] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[51:21] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[51:24] ye as offer he drink it in remembrance
[51:26] of me for as often as he eat this bread
[51:29] and drink this cup you do show the
[51:31] Lord's dead till he come wherefore
[51:34] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[51:36] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[51:38] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[51:41] but let a man examine himself and so let
[51:43] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[51:46] cup for he that eat it and drink it
[51:48] unworthily eat it and drink a damnation
[51:50] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[51:52] body for this cause many are weak and
[51:54] sickly among you
[51:55] and many sleep for if we would judge
[51:58] ourselves we should not be judged but
[52:00] when we are judged we are chastened of
[52:03] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[52:07] with the world let's bow our heads
