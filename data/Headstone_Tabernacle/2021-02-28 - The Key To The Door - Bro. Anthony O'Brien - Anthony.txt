philippa he asked his disciples saying whom the whom do men say i that i the son of and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye than i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen and amen revelation chapter 10 and verse uh verse 8 to 11 yeah that's what we had here please go so we know that another my team shall come down and all that amen in uh [Music] the earlier part of this chapter here is that right but uh we just want to pull out 8011 here for scripture reading this morning it says on the voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings we got our blessing there and also now second peter lastly second peter 1 4 8 amen praise god amen these are the precious promises this morning amen second peter 1 and verse 4 says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises

written praise god so we could anoint this promises to ourselves in the last day praise god because we believe with all our hearts that our rapture is coming amen might sound old-fashioned it might sound like something you heard before but we want to anoint that promise today praise god this world is not our home praise we are just passing through here praise god but we come from god and we go back to god amen and amen so for our title this morning i have a title and it's the key to the door that's my title this morning taking some context out of matthew 16 what we read amen isn't that right i have a subject the seven thunders gives us faith to unlock the power of god amen amen so the key to the door amen that's our title this morning and seven thunders gives us faith to unlock the power of god amen and amen and amen so we know the world is coming into its maturity isn't that right science technology bring things are progressing rapidly praise god isn't that right and that is playing all into god's hands because there's something he's going to achieve that omits all of this development amidst all of that satan is trying to do and build and create hallelujah he's going to have a pride on the earth praise god i will manifest these seven living voices praise god amen isn't that right satan's even coming into maturity everything is coming to its place everything into its position for the fulfillment of prophecy and this morning so too is the pride oh how you are coming to your place for the fulfillment of prophecy glory to god hallelujah amen isaiah 66 arise and shine for thy light is come amen and in the silence god has been continuing his work through his believing children using who he can wherever he can to fulfill his work amen that's right god uses penny sometimes oh how he used what he had to use to get to you because your name was on the book and lord the devil tried to strip you he tried to kill you he tried to take your promise from you but today the enforcer is here the god almighty the lord jesus christ he took the book himself and he come down himself to make sure that you make it into this glorious rapture oh do you believe it this morning do you have faith this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory amen how to fulfill his work hebrews 11 we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come thatcher's impact will be done away with oh so all he is has been part this part that here a little there a little but we coming into perfection we're coming on to something we coming on to that vision that the prophet saw of the bride walking in step walking in perfection walking in holiness without spots without wrinkle wash in the blood of the lamb there shall be hallelujah omnipotence has already spoken and the miraculous is about to take place miraculous yes in this evil age it will be miraculous to have a spotless sinless pride step out of the pages of the bible a bible pride on the earth echoing hallelujah thundering out in sweetness and in humility amen the perfect life of christ glory to god hallelujah amen so we know beyond the shadow of our doubt that god truly did send us elijah prophetic ministry before the great and terrible day of the lord isn't that right and we know that elijah was sent to do two things to reveal the hidden mystery of the seven seals even the seven thunder mysteries the things that have been hid from generation to generation that are now being revealed to us the saints which is christ in you the hope of glory pray that is the message that you receive oh and that is the thing that will get you ready for the rapture not your hopes not your dreams but christ in you the hope of glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory not your thoughts not your ideas not your opinions that won't make it what we need is a pitch to take us into a rapture because what we got now we can't make it but god will send it he promises that those seven unknown thunders will utter themselves to a bride who is on the earth now waiting for her master waiting for that spirit oh to come into her oh hallelujah she knows it out there she feels it out there it's got to be no matter how much doubt no matter how many devils 200 million devils cannot stop the seed of predestination in your soul god unspoken so shall it be you shall

[Music] all right okay let me take my time here christ a new hope for glory right reveal these mysteries under seven seals and then that these same divinely revealed mystery truths is what will literally turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers oh hallelujah when manifested turns our hearts back amen isn't that right these seven thunders seven unknown thunders will wake her up again it will cause a revival or something the prophet said hallelujah hallelujah a great stirring there's been no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet but it'll take these seven unknown thunders banging one two three four five six seven what is it hallelujah only the crowd will be christ in you the hope of glory the secret is the word is in the bride and the anointing the spirit of god get ready to fall upon the word seed in your soul and bring to life the seed of perfection that we have received all these years to god said i will restore hallelujah all the years that the cankerworm

spirits bring back hallelujah another ephesians bring back one lord one faith one baptism into one mystical body of the lord jesus christ hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah all right ephesians 1 15 says wherefore i also have heard of your faith in the lord jesus christ he has false freaking he's praying for us he says and love to all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers isn't that right and here's his prayers he said that the lord the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him oh hallelujah let me know him by wisdom and revelation of the spirit oh hallelujah ties back to brother isaac last week do you see it to know him praise god you're going to know him you're going to understand it all when that time comes amen that's right the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that he may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of the is his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us exceeding greatness of his power yes proud to fill you power to save your family power to save your backslidden son or daughter if sister had your right sons could not help but answer to the voice of the oh hallelujah of the prophet when he spoke sister i give you a two voice isn't that right what will the voice of the archangel fail in our pride too oh hallelujah praise god amen she'll be standing on the earth displaying power isn't it exceeding greatness of his power these are his promises to us what who believe oh do you believe this morning you wouldn't have been here if you didn't believe trust me there's a million reasons for you to give up this morning but i believe that's the one reason i could find to put on my clothes to brush my teeth to get up this morning and to go into the house of god that's the one reason i could find because i believe this work hallelujah hallelujah do you believe this morning amen i believe you believe this morning amen praise god according to the working of his mighty power which you wrote in christ when he raised him from the dead resurrection power isn't that right and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principalities and powers and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come he is still christ he's the lord over there isn't that right and i put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him uh that filth all in all amen isn't that right praise god praise god do you believe this morning all right so let's get to it now the key to the door amen this message came to me by the will of the holy ghost it says the key to the door here prophet said now a key he said i noticed here as we read he was reading from revelation uh 20 i think 20 verse one said when that angel come down from heaven having the key in his hand to the bottomless pit and so on he said i believe uh revelation 13 or 19 we find again another angel coming down with a key he said on a key the purpose of a key is to unlock something he said something that's been locked up or something that should be locked up oh can you follow me this morning a key hallelujah is something that is is something to open or unlock something that's been locked up or something that should be locked up isn't that right but a key is given for that purpose so now there are many different kinds of keys the prophet said because we have many uses of keys and there is keys to the storehouses he says there's key to your own house so he's talking about natural keys all right there's a key to your automobile amen a key to your car if you didn't have it you couldn't get in you'd have access to your car if you don't have your keys when you lost your keys you have to get a hanger and bend it or sit anyway i put it inside the driver's side window and try to fish out the lock because you don't have the key but if you have to keep you open it pray so easy that's what a key is for isn't that right hallelujah he said we call them keys and they are keys and they can be duplicated many times he said on a key cannot unlock a door watch until it is used by a hand he said it's got to have something to use the key and he said the key in itself cannot use itself it's got to have something to yield the key amen and he draws a reference he says it's like this microphone that i'm speaking through this microphone is a mute this microphone unless there's something to speak through it it cannot speak to itself it's got to have something to speak to it oh hallelujah isn't that right something uses a microphone so he said so it's not the microphone it's the voice or rather the noise behind the microphone that transmit the airwaves to your air oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right amen amen amen hallelujah you are not the holy ghost but the holy ghost comes into you and uses you uses your hands your body your feet oh hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah that's what it is amen we become a vessel that god could use once you are yielded enough once you are surrendered enough then god drops down and uses that vessel a vessel fit for the master's use oh same man somebody hallelujah said no that's the way it is in preaching the gospel it is not we ourselves hallelujah he created us not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture oh hallelujah you were created by god for god's purpose and no devil could stop it i don't care how many doubts how many failures how many shortcomings what god put inside your heart cannot fall to the ground or my words shall not return unto me boy but it shall accomplish the purpose i sent forth with the accomplish oh hallelujah what are you saying brother anthony you could not help but be a believer it is not you it is a word in you that's the believer that's the thing that's crying out for life that's crying out for second peter 1 4 through 7. the word in you is what cannot fail do we fail of course we fail every day but that word cannot fail and if that word is manifest in you and if these things be in you on a pound then make you that you shall be neither preparing not unfruitful oh hallelujah hallelujah but here the lack of these things is blind and cannot see you far off hallelujah hallelujah coming to laodicea states praise god if you refuse these things but if these things be in you then you're in rapturing condition then you're in rapture in condition then you're in apostolic condition oh then the rapture could take place any time brother because i'm sealing i'm sealed away oh away to glory oh wait to the rapture say man somebody [Applause] now i need you to ride with me this morning because there's a point we're gonna try to make we're gonna have to strike it so i needed to ride the anointing this morning and just build with me hallelujah because we go up we're going to get greater hell yeah there's going to be more anointing more blessings more power so leave this world behind leave your thoughts behind don't worry don't worry about the stove go to take care of it don't worry all the bills go to take care of it hallelujah praise god you just lock in this morning i'll zero in we're gonna zoom in and zoom out so you can get the whole picture as we build as we climb hallelujah now watch prophet said now not we ourselves are ministers we are not the gospel we are only transmitters that transmit the voice of god through our agency of men to the hero amen is now so god uses man amen the fightful ministry will be his dress he dresses himself in his commanding officers and uses each gift as he has need of it holly i'll use the apostle use a minister use a pastor use it this one that one praise god to get to you the whole point is to get you to perfection that's the whole point praise god is just a temporary thing church is a temporary thing until you get into perfection because you are the trophies of his grace he died for you he paid the price for you his blood gushed out for you he made a way for you to come into his presence and to be filled with his presence and to go up to meet him that's the purpose he died for oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so as ministers leaders or whatever it's just a temporary job sometimes we drop it off and someone else take it up take out a mental responsibility of past or whatever whatever in part in part until we come to perfection hallelujah praise god is not a permanent thing people treat us as a permanent thing like you will always be the boss or you always be in charge holy god said servant grumps my moses my servant is dead now therefore joshua take the people over moses black finish joshua take the people over i don't have no time to wish hallelujah praise god i've got a purpose to fulfill oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody's saying man this morning all right he said now a key is the same thing pardon me said the key is the only way to to be held in a hand that unlocks the door i follow it this morning he said now see it's got to be a hand now and then the key that i'm speaking about tonight it's only one hand that can hold this key he said it's a hand of faith he says the only thing that can hold his key and hands hold other keys he said it takes a hand of faith for that he said now uh uh paragraph 41 he said now we take like the key to knowledge so he brings out different keys now i love it watch how he breaks this down he said now a man has two if he's trying to accumulate knowledge see there's a key to that there's a key to knowledge to learning amen isn't that right there's a way to this man he said there's a way that this man has to open up has to be has to get his books and his learning he said he cannot listen to this he said no one can learn him he said they might teach him but he has to learn and the only way that it can be done is that he has to catch that key that's something in there that unfolds or reveals to him the knowledge that he is seeking oh hallelujah praise god so you've got to catch that key and once you catch that key you could unlock it no matter how much a teacher try to teach until they're blue in the face unless the student is open up and ready to learn you cannot receive anything he that received me receiving him that sent me oh hallelujah praise god isn't that right and there are people like would try to play a piano see talk about the key of knowledge now he's talking about the key of music he said trying to play a piano and music and so on he said they just don't know how to do it but they could go there to a teacher might take a lesson after a lesson they would never learn it just can't hold that key to that mystery how the rhythm and the sounds and tuning and everything report rings out he said it takes a key isn't that right now listen you set a key usually when it turns a lock you find a key it's got to be some treasure now listen to this a key usually when it turns the lock and when you find a key there's got to be some treasure something that's worthwhile isn't that right something that's hidden or you wouldn't even lock it up if it ain't worth locking up then just let it go there's no value in it do it make sense opening it but if there's a value behind there you'll be interested to know if you got some inheritance behind it if you got some wealth behind there holla you would be interested to know isn't that right but it take a key to get in there isn't that right come like you have a mansion for a big house and you have a flat screen in there you have our nine seats so friendly you have a jacuzzi in there you have a hot tub in there you have a water cooler and whatever and whatever and you stand up on the pavement telling everybody about what you have in your house and you're professing and you're testifying that was real nice boy and it take real long to build but we finally built it praise god but if you don't have a key to get in there and enjoy the pleasures that are inside of the house what scenes that make you have a nice door a pretty door a doorway video surveillance system hallelujah but if you can't get in there it don't make sense i better tell you when they get a key come back and find me and then show me the house because they're talking about something but i can't see it we have to unlock it in order to see it we have to open the door in order to see what's inside and i believe god has given us keys to open the door to his blessing to his power to his glory to his omnipotence oh come on now come on now behind the doors of the holy ghost behind the door is your holy ghost baptism behind the door is your anointing behind the door is your presence behind the door hallelujah is everything god promised everything he has for you but what you need this morning is a key to open that door come on somebody oh hallelujah so a key usually is the note to something or the way to enter something that's worthwhile the key and that's what it's for now it'll unlock something that's worthwhile now we read in st john 10 uh oh wow praise god now we're in saint john 10 10 chapter jesus said i am the door to the sheepfold so here he identifies who what the door is you want to know what the door is here it is he said i am the door to the sheep full i am the door so jesus is the door he's not a door

doctrines and we say no interpretation praise god no man's idea no nonsense that is not the door hallel only to jesus name he said and that is the key now watch how he brings us in he said now no wonder peter could use one of them on the day of pentecost he said they wanted to know how to get into that door and broadband said he used the key he said and there's only one key because there's only one door and peter had the key to it and he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins the door and you shall receive the treasures of god oh the key to the door he said and there's a key to the door and jesus is the door he said there's only one door to healing and jesus is that door do you need a healing this morning do you need a

oh he's going to make a way for you oh brother branham preached that door oh he introduced that door he showed us that door book after book tape after tape it was a torpy and preached it was a torpedo minister to us an entrance being ministered to us abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord jesus christ hallelujah praise god amen oh we know whoever you see we have received we have not believed commonly divine fables no we're not lying to you this door is real it is here right now he is here to take you up out and away of this ungodly world oh hallelujah don't you worry all creation grown-itch and travail for the sons of god manifested oh it's going to come it's going to come nature knows it's going to happen it's only a matter of time oh how are we just waiting for those seven unknown thunders to wake up again by manifestation the word has gone forward for all these years but what are we looking for a manifestation praise god hallelujah now watch he's the key to the door there's no the door no other way but true jesus christ he's the door the door is christ isn't that right okay wonderful oh my the holy spirit's got me right yes so now that jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key here it is he identifies it faith is the key that unlocks the door so the door is christ and what is key the key is faith and the faith is the key that unlocks the door which is jesus christ oh hallelujah so once you get the key in the door praise god you can have your promise once you've got to get the key in the door you can have your victory you can have your salvation you can have whatever you ask for all you got to do this morning is put the key in the door and that key is in you this morning behold look not for the kingdom here there but the kingdom of god is you oh praise god hallelujah oh hallelujah what is it the key to the door now watch follow me now he said now jesus is the door to all these promises of god faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure that there is inside the kingdom of god oh another ephesians yes the key to the door unlocks under the ephesians oh hallelujah another powerful church another super race another trooper church oh hallelujah now watch see if the key is faint faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of faith does that faith in his finished work if these keys that we're speaking on now watch in hebrews 11 chapter got a great string of them here the prophet said wrote down of these heroes of faith he said it was the key to the door that stopped the mouth of lions it was a key of hate that quenched the violence of fire it was a key to the door that escaped the edge of the sword that brought the dead back to life again what was it the key to the tour when moses found that key he might have stumbled he might have been flusterated but when he found that key he went up to the house of pharaoh and said pharaoh let my people go oh i have the key to the door he spoke flies he spoke frogs he spoke it into existence because he held something in his hand that the devil could not take away and when you find that key this morning the devil will not prevail against you because you'll have the key that unlocks the door of god somebody shout oh my hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god the key to the door wow it was fate the key of faith in a living god the hand of that man that woman who can take the key of faith they can unlock every promise of god made but if you haven't got that key you're just pragging you'll never unlock it you'll beat against it because this key he said any correct key that made that has levels on the inside of the lock and it takes a certain form a certain shape of them keys to turn those levers loose and just one little lever out of the way will mess the whole thing up now here the prophet says therefore i believe in the full gospel every word of god and that is what turns the power of god loose it cannot be 99 and nine-tenths it has to be the full word of god hallelujah to unlock the door hallelujah in this last day hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah isn't that right that's why we say the seventh seal is open because we can't preach a closed book to you if it was six seals the book would still be closed because there were straps holding that scrolling position but when the seventh seal was broke the contents of the scroll was open and your inheritance your promise your name on the book your children your family being delivered was in that scroll and he opened the scroll and he revealed every mystery and he'll open every promise to the bride to you this morning how can i help but praise him how can i help but shout when i understand that that book is an open book [Applause] hallelujah without the vision the people perish so malachi 4 come down with an open vision here it is here it is hallelujah come down with open vision reveal it through his prophet so that you could see it because if you see it you can have it oh hallelujah if you see it for yourself only you can run and not be reary you can walk or not pinch because you've got a key that goes the distance even when your human spirit fails even when trials come when testings come it doesn't matter the key inside you as you fearless and reckless and change you don't care what tomorrow holds you hold hallelujah a key in your hand and you know who holds tomorrow oh i got a key that says so i got a key that says my family is coming i got a key that says i'm gonna be filled with the holy ghost on fire i got a key that says i'm gonna make it i got a key that says there's no coronavirus that can stop the omnipotence of god i got a key that says the devil is a liar i got a key that says i have a right to worship god in the temple of my god i didn't come here to warm a church bench i came here to worship god i came here to worship my god because i have a key that says so somebody say man [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] all right so i believe the full gospel the word of god because that is what turns the power of god loose and turns his blessings to the people it's the key to the door that unlocks it all those great heroes those prophets men of greater the bible they had that key that's the reason they can stop the mount of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword bring the dead back to life again oh do you believe that do you believe when this key is open to you you could do the same thing we're gonna leap over walls holland is that right we're gonna stop the demons hallelujah we're gonna arrest the devils followed by a spoken word when joshua helike says son stand still we have more battle to fight we have more enemy to fight there is yet more land to be possessed i ain't gonna let the sun stop me because i have a key that says otherwise so son stand still oh hallelujah hallelujah and the sun stayed there and the moon stayed there and they overcame the battle and you overcome your battle god's gonna give you power power over the elements power over every living every creeping thing that creeped upon the earth everything that tried to stop you every time i tried to hinder you everything i try to hold you back try to hold back your prayer life you're gonna take possession you're gonna destroy it you're gonna cut their heads off you're gonna pile that carcasses and burn them or unconquer your land [Applause] somebody say hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah amen oh hallelujah all those great heroes my they had that key the prophet said that's the reason isn't that right because i held our key all right so we got that amen said prophet said so now if i'm programming with a creed key he said i won't know what to do if i'm proclaimed with some other interpretation key it can't work it might jimmy look but it won't go in because it's not shaped to fit that word it'd shape a different way it have a different pattern on the inside so it can go in it might go in 99 or non-tense but a key is only activated when it goes all the way in they calibrate peace out so i'm trying to open a door no no no no you'll break a key and plenty of people are going to break their key upon christ's door in this hour because he ain't made for that but your key is a divine revelation from god hallelujah a supernatural experience which gives you faith a perfect faith to open that door [Applause] oh hallelujah somebody praise him this morning oh man all right whenever your long time is going mercy i don't know press on all right here it is okay so the bible teaches it he said i hold a key fit in my hand or my heart that says that's god's word he said that will quench the violence of fire he said let's unlock the healing for the sick it'll unlock salvation to the loss he said i've come to the door everything in his name whatever you do in word or d do it all in his name knowing that the key that you got is fate because it's a scripture made key he said now if it says creed key denominational key i don't know what it'll do but if it's a scriptural key it'll unlock because god said so oh thank god we received a scriptural key oh aki according to his word according to what he promised would take place that's the key we're holding this morning by faith isn't that right hallelujah no wonder they can subdivide so far amen they had the key okay he said first none of those prophets nothing could stop them he didn't have to do the prophet said he's testifying he didn't have to do like he does to me sometimes pounding it over and over and perhaps i hope not but he keep telling me go do this he said and then he'll stumble along then go do this go back and do it again he didn't do it right he said just one little knot just and they feel the spirit just tell them it's the thing to do and nothing's going to stop them oh fearless at the job isn't that right because they got in contact with something oh brother they stopped them out of lines they escaped the edge of the sword they done everything just a little not from god because they held the key in their hand that great faith he says oh hallelujah oh my how glorious he says he said now you know a key unlocks watch he said no now you know a key that locks unlocks too see he said you can loosen or bind the word says so isn't that right we just read it the same key that locks unlocks and the key that unlocks can lock up oh that's exactly see said because it works both ways and he said how pitiful it is that the church has ever lost its vision of that he said what a sad thing it was when the church sold itself out to creeds as we've done today and now trying to call to unite oh isn't that right it reminds you of samson when he sold himself out to delilah oh isn't that right hello is it to that spirit he was tied to those seven locks god tied it to him because when he lost it he lost the power and when he got it back he got back the power oh isn't that right hallelujah that was his covenant that was his key hallelujah to the power of god allah was those seven locks no wonder the prophet said he has my only hope that while samson was in prison i'm not a shock of here grouch oh hallelujah while he was pound while he was grinding at the mill another shock of air grew out and the church might be in a condition you might feel like you're in a condition but i say this morning while you were in prison another shock of here is growing out this morning god's getting our group ready holy our crop ready for that last great kill hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there will be a pride on the earth with the key to the door to unlock the promises of god for this day the rapture for this day the wedding supper for this day hallelujah millennium everything praise this behind that door let's go to that door this morning let's leave this world behind it don't make sense sticking around here anymore everything is falling apart the world is falling apart the systems are falling apart everything you think is permanent it's only temporary but there's one thing that will remain when heaven and earth pass away that word will never pass away and that word shall accomplish that word is gonna turn to spirit in your life in your heart oh hallelujah are you gonna be a witness of this glorious resurrection ministry of jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah all right all right on a mission here we go we've seen where the great roman hierarchy they have come they're going now to meet now they're going to change some programs they said i thought they didn't change what they're going to anyhow give each priest the power of a pope wherever he's at and so forth how pitiful that the church ever sold out to dogmas instead of the word see that's where they left the key right there that's the reason here's the prophet said these great miracles and signs are not done amongst the people today that there used to be because they've lost the key yeah they know the tool they know the door is there but the next thing is the key to open the door oh hallelujah the treasures are behind the door they're locked up they're out of sight from the unbeliever but the believer who has faith can take the key of it and unlock those tools oh you've got faith the little remnant here this morning oh hallelujah you know that there's a genuine spirit of god out there somewhere people claim this people claim that i ain't worried about that we know the genuine dollar this morning that's what we come for we want the same penny we don't want some nickel some silver thing praise god some finish anything no we want a genuine stamp genuine holy ghost genuine revival genuine penny the same penny now the only workers receive this last minute paid pride these 11 hour gentile workers are gonna receive the same holy ghost god same stamp of approval in your heart oh god gonna put his brand of hot brand in your heart the searing power of god and burn the demons out and bring back another church like he had in the beginning before the resurrection there will be a church with power of god moving in it signs wonders miracles they will have the key to open the door [Applause] once more this will head direct from god ah because they'll have the key the treasures are behind the door they're locked up the other side but if you can take the key of it you can unlock these doors yes sir so who is the door christ the word he says i am the door to the sheep fool so christ is the door just a recap isn't that right what is the key the key is faith faith that unlocks the door and what is faith faith is a revelation of the predestinated will of god god's predestinated will for your life i don't care how you feel doesn't matter about how you feel it matters about what god wrote in his book he is perfect she shall be perfected unto adoption to take this glorious stand in 2021 i will so please to send my spirits to baptize my sons and daughters into the everlasting kingdom oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] his spirit will bear witness with your spirit that your name is in this book that we are the children of the light and that we walk not in darkness but we walk in his marvelous light [Music] hallelujah when god faces a revelation of when god is divinely revealed to the individual oh now don't stop praising me this morning we're going somewhere real quick praise god amen we're going to time warp now we're going to speed up a little bit when that individual can see christ beings reveal in his own word then that is divine revelation and revelation is sovereign god reveals himself to whomsoever he will i love it [Music] you can't push it inside your own head and make somebody believe it or make this one believe it or make that one believe it you just have to believe for them but if god if he ever revealed to you what your name is on that book brother the devil cannot prevail against that rock revelation that you've got in your soul you could wash a devil in his eye and say do the skin worms destroy my flesh you can take away my eyes you can take away my feeling but once more lord once more lord pour out the dynamics like you did for the alpha church oh my you got a promise from the lord you're not venturing out on your own faith but it's according to prophecy he promised he would meet this people oh and we'll be on the expectation for it this morning now watch crisis mystery of god reveal he said now god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person it is not your theology it is a revelation of jesus christ and jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church isn't that right no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school no other nothing no other interpretation no other church no other thing no other group no one that's not built on that but i built upon this solid rock of revelation the revelation of jesus christ today but on exactly the revelation jesus christ and through the new birth you're born again hallelujah he is born in there and he christ injects his own life to your new birth that's why you must be born again oh you're going to receive it you've got to receive it it's the only way for him to inject his life in there and begin to grow in you from faith to faith to faith hallelujah uma do you believe it he's born in there and he checks his own life your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people that they see the very life on works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you so we got to see as we come near the headstone i remember the stephen oliveira man he preached our message supercharged super race isn't that right what a blessing and as we narrow that headstone we've got to see these signs and wonders be in fulfilled god being manifest in us oh we're nowhere close to it he's coming for our perfect church he's coming for our church with jesus christ walking in it so these signs have to follow them i believe oh hello then we're going to see the sick being healed the blind seeing the walking the gospel being preaching his power when that time comes oh holy satan this mountain be moved and don't you doubt in your heart but faith to believe it fatal move mountains a perfect page for a perfect rapture hallelujah see the very life and signs those are right that is looking through you outside of that the rest is not even called to at all now watch god's great revelation unfolding he said now by lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation see they lack that revelation the teachers oh my but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it is revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture amen so what is fate it's a revelation a revelation to you holy this word is revealed to you who god is what he is and what he's about to do in you he said and now it's a revelation for the revelation is faith what is it it's faith the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation he said without it being faith faith is a revelation oh hallelujah and that is the key to the door because it's something that's revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what's been revealed to him and though it wasn't so now what he said now faith uh what faith is is a revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body amen amen hallelujah glory to god honestly isn't that right he said now and uh uh revelation jesus christ exposition he said now let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than 99 percent of delusions oh a lot of people who think they know but to know him is life he is the living word hola he gives he is the life giver to the scriptures hallelujah not we ourselves but he will he reveal himself to isn't that right holiday he bypassed the learning he bypassed the schools he bypassed the theology but one time he had a woman to meet he told the disciples go and get some meat for yourselves but there's somebody i got to speak to there's somebody i've got to meet hello she was an ill-famed woman but jesus had an appointment to speak to this woman because this woman had a representation in her hallelujah this woman is living all kind of life and it's just perfect because it proves to show that it doesn't matter what condition you are in doesn't matter what situation you are in on earth once that seed is in your soul when jesus comes to you when the life giver comes to his own word he brings his own word to life he brings his own word to pass oh he shows himself he reveals himself isn't that right you say woman do you have a drink uh uh give me a drink isn't that right hallelujah he said she said uh you know i have nothing to get the water with him isn't that right and he got to talk and so on he began to hunt a spirit he may be gonna hunt a soul he began to go past the bone in the marrow and the discern and thoughts and intent of her heart to see that she wasn't an ill pain woman after all that she wasn't so garmed up after all that she wasn't so lost after all and i don't care how you feel this morning you are not so messed up after all you are not so lost after all your your situation is not unredeemable god came down to redeem you your situation is not too lost that it cannot be found it's not too fallen and it cannot be saved you are not too broken that he cannot put you back together again oh let him speak to you this morning [Applause] hallelujah isn't that right oh my so he revealed himself to her by pastor learning hallelujah pharisees sadducees of that day said our fathers ate bread and willingness and he said they're everyone dead praise god because they had no representation because even though the living word is standing here right in front of him they couldn't recognize it oh hallelujah but to babe such as would learn to the ignorance to men he couldn't write their own name he revealed himself he said andrew come philip come peter come there was cuspard fishermen they didn't know nothing about this gospel they did not go in a church there was no scroll readers them just doing as a feeling but somehow another god found him in the situation god found him and he found you this morning as messed up as he was as terrible as he was looking oh he come to wash you up he come to put you back together again he is a potter you are the clear surrender yourself into the hand of your maker this morning let him break you let him shape you let him mold you yo his hand is not too short that he cannot reach you that he can't reach your husband your wife your children oh hallelujah hallelujah maybe for a few minutes i'm minister my look that scripture always amazed me when god told moses i will harden pharaoh's heart against the children of israel and against you and against all your signs and wonders it always amazed me how god said i'll harden his heart against him so that he'll keep going keep going until we get down to that last plague then i'll break him for him to let you loose oh hallelujah i always say that if god did harden hats he could soften hearts too if god could harden hearts he could break hearts too he could break the hands of fetters that bang you he could break this painfulness of sin he can crush the unbelief he non-belief cannot hand a car somebody say man [Applause] [Music] he stirred up the heart of the king of cyrus to send the people back to their homeland he did that he put it on the king's heart oh hallelujah isn't that right he could put it upon your heart this morning he could wake you up he could show you something in the world this morning he can anoint you he could inspire this word to you because if this word is inspired to you brother you could ask what you will and it shall be done unto you why because you've got the key that opens the door to every promise of god [Applause] promise for your healing promise for deliverance promise of the holy ghost promise for your breakthrough promise for what you're looking for oh the desire of your heart oh he knows the desire of your heart this morning he knows what you have need of he is able to provide your every need he is the door every blessing is behind the door all you need is a key to open that door this morning if any man lack wisdom let him ask god oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody praise him this morning glory to god hallelujah [Applause] he knows that since god is immutable isn't nature he's just as immutable in his ways that satan knows surely that the original church at pentecost the original church the original manuscript is that right the original whatever you want to call it the blueprint with the power of god saint mark 16 action is the true church that jesus christ claims as his own all else is false it has to be amen he said now remember this the christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts we've read it we know it but praise god i want you to shout on it because it's the word of god amen hallelujah but the book of revelation shows how that antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless no praise demons pact in there no faith they can't praise they can't believe god for our to take even hardly much more for the rapture isn't that right he said but it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and so on right down to the time he's cast in a lake of fire the devil fights that he fights that he's fighting you this morning he doesn't want you to get the victory because if you get the victory you'll kick him in his face faith in the word of god will unlock every promise to you this morning oh so his mission is to sit on your lip and sit on your hand until you're not worried and you can't praise god and look what you do yesterday i look what you do just now i look at your temper look at your bad attitude don't look at that this morning look at this this is what we are going to become second peter 1 4-7 oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm not what i ought to be but i'm not what i used to be i'm coming on to perfection devil he will perfect the word that concerned me this morning he will complete it he is able to complete it amen anymore glory glory he can't stand it he fights that he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is also one day you're gonna know what it is the genuine thing you're gonna be able to taste the real thing and all these showers and sprinkles of blessings was only coming on to something but we're coming on to the real thing real genuine holy spirit christ directed works on the third pull third phase hallelujah praise khan my what she stands for and to know that she can do the greater works oh hallelujah eternal life i'll give you your two boys isn't that right she'll be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand oh hallelujah you're gonna know hallelujah every spirit what can attend the church by the way isn't that right oh hallelujah understanding withstand that antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before isn't that right with true revelation it gets if i can't prevail all right right good skipping on he said now you'll recall i mentioned at the beginning of this message this book we're studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church as his work in the future ages then i mentioned that watch now he said that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together now you'll see that it won't just take ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost i said and that means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people oh here's a shout don't miss it hallelujah praise god this book will be revealed to a special class of people you are not ordinary this morning there's something very different about you that's why the devil tried to kill some of you he tried to cut you off he's not playing games if he could cut you off he would cut you off but the angel of the lord and camp it round about them that fear him and deliver at them god put his fear in you to recognize the word of god for your day oh and he protects that god himself is fighting against the devil fighting against you from coming again to this word two forces pulling one pulling upward one pulling downward which one are you influenced by this morning i say come up hither i say lift up your heads lift up your hands your redemption draw at night there's coming a power into the church oh hallelujah the sick are gonna be healed the blind will see the will walk oh hallelujah what you see manifested temporarily will be in its fullness when that time comes oh hallelujah praise god praise god just a flow just a flow of god through the people here's my spirit flowing freely here's another one i can place him i can place her the adoption of sons oh made it happen in here this morning may it happen with you my brother because that's the condition to get into the rapture isn't that right you want to talk rapture then you got to have rapturing condition you want to talk about apostolic times there's got to be apostolic conditions oh then we've got to come back to the bible back to the word isn't that right but i thank god that he sent to us elijah prophet to unveil the whole word of god to us so that we could see the plainness of god this morning hallelujah hallelujah that we could see the entire plan of god so i could know what our inheritance is what our promises is what we have to possess oh hallelujah it hasn't been spoken so shall it be amen praise the name of the lord all right to make it real got to be revelation right it's going to be the operation of the holy ghost a special class of people it'll take one and prophetic inside it will require the ability to hear from god oh what is it this morning you have the ability to hear from god otherwise you wouldn't know it you wouldn't understand it it will fly over your head but god put something in your soul this morning that's why you're sitting in that chair this morning that's why you're sitting on that pew nothing i could have done for you but what god predestinated in your soul and in your heart from before the foundation of the world oh hallelujah let me hurry along here now to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing versus verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear oh how we need to hear from god the prophet said and lay ourselves open are you open this morning and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know oh i'll let yourselves open this morning before the presence of god hallelujah amen isn't that right you believe this word to be true then give him praise this morning and lay yourselves open before god hallelujah don't look to me i can't do anything for you this morning but the spirit is here to show you your promises this morning because if you see it you could have it and if you got the key you could open the door he said now as i already said this book revelation is a consuming consummation of scripture it's even placed exactly right in the canon of scripture at the end wow so now you can say no why it says that anyone who even hears it or read it is blessed amen you are blessed this morning to hear what you hear and to read what you read oh blessed is he that hear these things isn't that right now watch it is a revelation of god i will give you authority over the oh devil what is it the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil he said and you can see why they would who uh uh why they who would argue take away from it will be cursed it would have to be so for who can arrow take away from a perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy he said it's that simple amen amen you can't take away from it you can't water it down and then expect it to be effective it's got to be the pure concentrated dose oh hallelujah hallelujah hello people who want the real thing right now if somebody got vaccine they want the real vaccine might not inject yourself with water and methylated spirits and hydrochloroclean you want a real vaccine you want the pure concentrated dose the thing that inoculates that thing away from you isn't that right well the holy ghost have the inoculation for you this morning it is a pure concentrated dose that will keep the bugs off of you this morning it'll keep the demons away from you this morning hallelujah the prophet talk about hybrid plant you say if you have a hybrid plant you ought to water it you have to pet it you have to say come on you have to say grow you have to watch the sunlight you have to time it you got to bring it inside you got to bring it outside that is a hybrid plant that's a halfway thing pray that cop will reproduce itself but our original plant he knows the prophet said he got something built inside of him to weather the storm to fight off the insects the fight of diseases the fight of the wind to fight off the waves he's got something inside his soul and you've got something inside your soul this morning oh you've got to get that pure concentrated dose or the inoculation of the holy spirit of fight off the demons in this last day oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen now i'm not preaching a vaccine now that's what i'm saying we're talking about the holy ghost all right praise god i felt your mind go anyway all right praise god amen hallelujah isn't that right okay so as i said now he said it's that simple there's nothing such as prevailing power as a revelation of the word see in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book and i think this refers to the old testament custom of the priest and so on reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could read so the priests had to read to them and as long as it was the word the blessing was there praise god hell it doesn't matter how lonely you are praise god how much phd or ll you have is that right praise god but god revealed to him not hear it oh holy and that's us this morning who are privileged to hear what we hear and to see what we see amen isn't that right okay get it on quickly time is going a few more minutes so malachi 4 prophecy has locked the heavens can we say amen and we're looking for the dynamics but it cannot come until the world had to come first into its maturity that's why i said at the beginning the world is coming into that place now sirs how late is it we see time closing in on us we see the chapters of this world closing we see the pages of this bible coming to a close what time is it we've got to wake up we got to pinch ourselves somebody has got to wake us up oh hallelujah hallelujah no more did that message come the other day blow a trumpet in zion sound an alarm in my holy mountain call them a solemn assembly oh get next to yourselves we don't have much much time left oh it's time to get out of here time to get your lamps trimmed oh and clear look up for your redemption is near it's time to get the holy ghost it's time to get filled up it's time to be born again be washed and be born again by the spirit of the living god oh he doesn't feel to be filthy still he holy be holy still that time is coming soon get desperate get next to yourselves if you're not praying if you're not seeking if you're not consecrating yourselves brother sister you're gonna miss it you gotta make your calling and election show oh no preacher can bring a revival no elder no deacon it takes a people in your homes come on now in your lives come on now to bring the revival in this lastly oh holly the burden's got to be upon you amen to bring this revival you're looking for you said amen it's not right praise god oh amen okay we're on the beam now so the seed had to go in the ground first the seed had to be sown first in order to produce a harvest you can't have a harvest for something you didn't show you can't reap what you didn't so that's phil's time behavior that's them going on rage hamda house behavior that is that kind of madness hallelujah you carry for you guess so how are you teething but you gotta sow something in order to reap something hallelujah isn't that right so a seed had to be sewn in your heart first some fell upon tony some fell upon the wayside some come up all through the years but they couldn't stand a word test and when it got too hot they got driven out because it was hollow there wasn't made for it to begin with but you come all this way we didn't come all this way for nothing no no no the holy spirit is promised to beat unto you this morning according to your faith be it done unto you you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen and that gift is to help you to form you into the word image because a real gift is a seed in your soul and that holy ghost the temporal gift is there to teach you how to walk in jesus name till you come to perfection then you come into the fullness of jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right how can we speak wisdom to them that are perfect to them that are mature in other words you are going to come into that state of perfection and maturity before the resurrection before the wedding suffer there will be a bride on the earth standing in perfection maturity all holily adopted and positionally placed amen same and somebody my god so the seat had to go on the ground first the seed had to be sown first in order to produce a harvest and this dynamic revival will be and must be watch a vindication of the word for this day what was prophesied by malachi 4. isn't that right he said yes now listen to the authenticated prophet of god lao decent church he said who appears in this last day what he says from god the bride will say the bride and the prophet and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already be said in the word he said they are saying it now come out from among her and be separate oh hallelujah glory to god a man hallelujah when revelation 22 strikes that bride she will say what that prophet said oh hell and she will she anoint that same spirit will be upon her spirit on the bride say come let him that is a thirst come let him now drink of the water of life come come all you are weary come all you are heavenly laden and i'll give you rest oh hallelujah hallelujah i'll come and drink of the water of life the pride will be on the earth giving out holiday imparting praise god life to the people isn't that right oh to the predestinated now watch now that's what the reason is today that the revivals that we're supposed to have third seal he said we had denomination revivals he said we've had a real stirring we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere oh there's churches and churches there's prides and brides there's groups and groups but not a revival nowhere this morning hear what the prophet said the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no man revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet oh hallelujah so this revival that we're looking for has to come by a manifestation of god to stir the pride to discreet revival to start this great revival that we're looking for oh see but we're looking for it now and here it is he said it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again oh see he said yeah he'll sell it he he promised it oh he said now watch first seal prophet said at the end of the pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word of god and god help me tonight to show you through here that we are to see and receive a messenger that will take those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church he said and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing fate he said because what we got now we wouldn't be able to do it oh hallelujah he said we can't have enough faith for divine healing and we've got to have enough faithful to be changed in a moment and to be swept out of this earth we gotta have enough faith for that this morning friends oh hallelujah you can't do that in your human spirit you can't do that in your human self but it'll take a power to take the church up into glory this morning oh that's what we're looking for that's what we under expectation for for this glorious revival brother it's already been spoken i say it is here it is going to take place oh it's here by faith receive it anointed god will send it he promised it he promised hallelujah that these salman thunders will utter their voices to you make you ready for the rapture now watch fourth seal and we found out that he gets killed with the sword too the sword of the word of god of god's word what is it sharp sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down private said wait till them seven on those on uh seven thunders i'll tell their voices to that group who can really take the word of god and hand it there it'll slice and cut oh and they'll close the heavens they can shut this they can do that or whatever they want to oh glory he said he'll be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth sharper than any two-edged sword oh what are we saying this morning it'll take that prophecy to unlock the heavens this day in this hour in the season the dynamics revival that we are looking for it will take malachi 4's prophecy oh you've got to know it by revelation in order to speak it in order to anoint it in order to take that key and turn it in the door which is christ revealed for this last day [Music] right now everybody have to do it everybody preaching the door malachi 4 word isn't that right but it'll take those seven unknown thunders to get access to this power of god that we're looking for to heal the sick to see the lame walk to see the cripples walk to see the gospel preaching his power it'll take the key to the door to unlock every promise that is laying in malachi 4's message [Applause] almost home now almost home hallelujah oh hello we're running so he'll be asleep by that word isn't that right it's the word of god coming from the mouth of god yes and he always uses man to work with oh isn't that right no wonder in this last day the prophet said he's calling god call man man that's not trained by the school of theology but train in the spirit of god you know the spirit of god the little prophet said i'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of god that knows that he is the same yesterday that he is ashamed today that he is the same forever i didn't come to warm a church bench but i know the spot i want to know the spirit of god i want to be trained on that anointing train on that holy spirit of promise i want to be so yielded that i could feel him move and i could move with it the spirit hallelujah appearing witness that we are the chosen of god this morning because if you're dead he'll pass right over you god didn't come for dead bride you know can you imagine a man is causing a woman and he's telling her you know i'm gonna come back for you i love you so much you know i'll do anything for you i'll give you the moon and the stars and she's like huh oh that's cool that's real cool what does he do he goes away there's no engagement hallelujah isn't that right but when you speak to her and she responds back and she believe him and they enter the conversation then it reforms a relationship because they have like interests they have like passions they bought one the word they would want to see it reveal oh hallelujah then he gets excited as he shares the word and as he brings her closer to him they become one they develop a relationship and god wants to become one with you this morning not by might not by power but by his spirit communicating communing with you and as he gives you his promises you believe you believe be it done unto me according to thy word you receive it you don't doubt it you don't mix up with it praise god you believe it just as he said oh that's the kind of bride god loves and that's the kind of pride he's coming back for this morning somebody who is interested in his things and the things that he loves in the things that he wants in his desires in his program and his purpose someone who wants to become one with him do you want to become one with your lord this morning then open up he gates hallelujah my god hallelujah isn't that right oh i'm getting ready to close out a musician could come it's like that story the prophet told isn't that right about a little little sister who was watching in the back of the party she wasn't privy to all the royalty that was going on upstairs or outside or wherever praise god but a rich man of the house come a rich young ruler isn't that right come around and all the girls are promenading and doing anything in front of him and and and throwing themselves and so forth at him but he's not interested he's not looking for that praise god hallelujah he's he's fed up of the attention he gets out of the party hallelujah come around the back see this little sister no shoes on her feet praise god she's there watching but there's something about her spirit something about her that's different he began to talk to that woman and she was humble she was wonderful she had a fine spirit there was something different about her and there was something different about you yes yes you were tattered you were torn you were nothing that you would anybody would desire you were smitten away but he loved you still he came and found you came round the back side of the book although he came and found you oh hallelujah come to call your name oh hallelujah come to reveal oh something to you that is coming back for you oh hallelujah what a joy that little sister felt what a peace that little sister felt when the party was over when everybody was sad because all the drinks finished and all the party done and the music done when everything was done everybody joy was gone but that little sister was no getting started her joy was over full and full of glory because he made a promise to her that he was gonna come back for her oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] and did they laugh boy did they laugh you gobble dirty dick coming back for you nah i don't believe that oh they laughed up a storm she was a joke of the party she was a joke out of town from weeks maybe for months but that didn't bother her she knows who spoke to her and we know who spoke to us all these years it's been the ministry of the word given us promises promises promises i'm coming back for you i'm coming back for you i love you i'm gonna give you the holy ghost yeah yeah you might be weak now but strength is coming you might be sad now but joy is coming in the morning day that's so in tears shall reap enjoy yeah you're praying now but one day you won't have to even say in jesus name you will command the devils to come out praise god the authority of god will be on the pride in her last tale she will be with her headship her lord she will have his authority his voice his leadership she will have his potentials she will have to say the lord will keep still she will have the voice of the archangel fail in her flesh to call oh hallelujah hallelujah the names from the book hallelujah glory almost finished what did she do she got a garment ready she got her bride veil ready she got her dress ready whatever little money she was making and washing away yes she was saving it up oh and she was bottling it up oh hallelujah and every time you pray you're bottling it up this morning every time you call upon god no it's not going to waste hollywood every penny every scrap of coin we're bottling it up this morning button it up this morning god oh hallelujah seeing your vile of prayer filling up this morning and god's getting ready to pour it out upon you when the time is right when the time of this prophecy is to be fulfilled god is going to pour upon you a blessing an anointing a power that's going to shake this world or your husband's going to see it your wife is going to see it your children is going to see it your co-worker is going to see it your family is going to see it once more this will get direct from god because that voice will be pale in our pride in the last day oh hallelujah speaking the word and it'll flash like lightning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh honey you could begin to play some softly he said i believe that age has come now the miraculous i'm getting the clothes out now amen the phenomenal the baptism of the holy spirit the power the signs the wonders this great outpouring of god's spirit in the last days he said that's the thing that'll bring faith into the people that'll take a rapturing faith that'll take the church into glory he said i believe it he said how can we not be raptured when we haven't got faith for healing we've got to have rapturing faith first that's right how that god moves by his spirit signs and wonders begin to follow everywhere where god begins to move signs and wonders follow after god oh hallelujah isn't that right hey man you understand i'm finished here's my last quote hallelujah he said oh brother he said give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all theologists fail to do in 2000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful little remnant after the doors of the gentiles is closed oh god will anoint the church then he was filthy letting me filthy still he was righteous let him be righteous still and he who is holy let him be holy still and god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will begin to take place oh hallelujah not
