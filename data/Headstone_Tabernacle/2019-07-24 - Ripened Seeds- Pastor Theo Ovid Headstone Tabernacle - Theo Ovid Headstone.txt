night marked up to four verse 24 to 29 we're gonna have our excitation and we're gonna have a time of Maria mark for reading from verse 24 Oh Leslie from verse 26 rather and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grew up he knoweth not how for the bringing forth fruit of its herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the air when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put it in the sickle because the harvest has come may God bless this word universe would even be seated or praise the name of the Lord tonight of a title ripened seeds ripen seeds another inspiration to lay in the presence of the Sun no on sunday we talk about sweat it out and many people not interested in sweating anything out they interested in a short cut but there are no short cuts the word is God forget your feelings tonight forget the emotions forget you have to snap out at the humanistic ground and break into the realm of what God have said define revelation what could have said so have a few quotes to share with you tonight not just coral bless it and inspire see that you know it's not something that you don't know since that you already know but it's how we apply it to our lives and ourselves this is the age where there's so much destruction with a cell phone with the internet with friends or the phone and you know these we didn't have cell phone we didn't have a ton of this destruction you have no internet and all these access only special people that cell phone in those days but the point is we had more time in prayer more time to study law and things of God and today with the hustle and bustle it's so difficult but we are still called to distinction and this responsibility and bam talk about the brighter responsibilities of Christ and the word and the prayer it is a responsibility you have to determine to make a commitment to it you have to determine to stir yourself up because it has to be done you have to do it you have to push and press your way this is what Eagles were designed for his Eagles wasn't designed to be grouped like the fly Zulu and find a meetin and see about their own kind and so designed to do and God be too and his people going to fly in this hour he chose you because you are special he chose you because you can be pressurized don't think you can handle that you can because he will never give you more than you can bear because he is faithful say he is faithful tonight he is faithful tonight he knows what you're going through remember everyone is going through something because they try and come to try every man on the earth every man woman family home will be trying to desert none will escape none will escape every man woman child family gonna be tried and desert or glory that God you take in your trial now you take in your tribulation no you take in your pressure now some will take it all in the tribulation you come here to escape the tribulation or glory to God by coming into the child of your feet hallelujah because a worse time lays ahead for the unbeliever and the make believer and the church member become in the brightest rapture don't ever make war with the remnant of the woman see when the bat is raptured the devil be angry that he couldn't get a hole up on that bride so the remnant of the church members he would be loosed after them Oh glory to God the devil after you know you better praise God Oh hallelujah praise God because he has something in you that's why he's after you no of course I know he's after he's supposed to be after you you are the bride of Jesus Christ or glory to God if you don't know two hundred thousand thousand Devils have been loosed against the bride that was loose against you they'll stop those Devils the target and church members these are the different demons now this level target and bride all glory to God ones that potentials in you you are targeted all glory to God you are target for demonic attacks for pressure for stress or glory to God for all kind of depression and frustration you are targeted or glory to God and what all this pressure is for you see each of us we see there's pressure and trials and testing but the god he see you are getting right on because you have to be a ripened seed or glowing of God not a fresh soldier a trained soldier or glow either God a ripened see we believe that so but herb and him say watch Nietzsche he said a thing watch he said you watch nature we see where every age designed it out in the last age of chakras pulled away we have 15 years nearly 20 know of the message sweeping from nation to nation this one in hooked up across the nation and no organization it can't organize there's nothing ever been like it or will be hereafter but the team that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must leave in the presence of the Sun to get ripen uh-huh we're not talking about church no we're not talking about coming to service now we're talking about coming into presence Oh hallelujah so this message supposed to bring us into presence hallelujah not just talk not explanation but to draw you into presence and in that presence you got to stay on the deal and abideth very few gonna get there but I can me that's a different thing altogether they're not writing notes and writing some code and writing something is trying to remember and reading some book no no no no no that is laying there in presence Oh hallelujah there's a purpose for that hallelujah watch to get ripen you can pick up the message and let the sun-baked all the greenness out of you to make you mature Christians you see what I mean God is coming to receive his church and we must have that type of Christian for him to receive or glory to God so it's not just Christians is that type or Kobe give the Lord a shout tonight it's not just Christians in that type your wife have to notice your husband after know this though you never have to notice your friends after notice it's not just Christians it's the type mature Christians ojala the wheat has got to get right Oh glory to God amen and the evening light produces that Oh glory to God somebody said to me at anybody right now precious brother of mine he said he's seen like a sock on a vine he said we discussed it in the room the other day but I rather was these two before the conditions of the time the feeling of the Spirit in the churches today hold began to drop down ministers from everywhere interviews asking what happened what has happened but I rather asked me are they living off the spirit of Satan or what so if they feeling less of the anointing less of the presence he said I said no the circle is of the strength of the vine it lives because the citrus food and lemon will grow in an orange tree but it will not be oranges do it live by its life so the church so call is only a grafted sucker living under the name of religion under the name of the church Catholic and Protestant just suckers and just as it have churches that are suckers enough Christian people or church members that'll just suckers then living under the branch of the message and Christianity and they are Rascals and they are just suckers producing the own life they're not interested in transformation the not interested and delights me and change this reason will come at the church because church is a covering and it covers the a brigade of a religion a message religion not a life transformation yet they're in the fruit what they are because it wasn't convicted it wasn't in the original predestinated plan of God that's the reason they have to deny the word and the other kind of fruit the real genuine tree in the roots was predestinated to pay for oranges God had given a buffet-style that you choose who you want you have to eat the whole rule or give the Lord a shout do you get what I'm saying there it's not buffet style you pick and choose what you want you have to eat the whole scroll or glory record and you could prophesy about your own life Oh glory to God you know you're gonna make it hallelujah no you're gonna get a break truth you're not you're gonna deliver runs you'll know you're gonna get victory you can prophesy about your own life because they eat the whole scroll or glory to God amen jesus said I am the vine you are the branches and if there's ever scripture that really uncurse this thing is the scripture st. John 15 I am the vine ye are the branches every branch that does the producer me I cut off Oh glory to God hallelujah and every branch that group it begin to produce I'm gonna prune it that'll bring forth more fruit and heaven is my father glorified that to bring forth much fruit or glory that got stuck or not interested in branches he interested in fruit or chlorine O'Connor when the farmer put on the seed he sleep he's raised he's sleepy wake up hallelujah and he seen it growing he's no not how it just growing because there's a law in it because once you put the see there's a law in it you don't have to do nothing there's a law in the seed in itself to let the devil try to mess with your mind there's a law of the seed inside of you and to give it clear jesus said you have to buy the knee not we after me not be like a false teeth attached to me you have to be connected to me not connected but connected because when you're connected then the light will flow from the vine to the branch and then for this root all glory to God so we're talking about a connected life I connected life not to touch life not a reason oh when I gave life but that but the connected life you have to want that kind of life because I connected life the life of Christ control true or glory does not remember he's trying to get the church in position that he Co said there is my spirit flowing freely or glory to God you want to see a spirit flowing freely because that is what was in the beginning there was darkness coming in and the Spirit of God begin to move or glow in their garden and God said let there be light or something else to move because the voice speaks to move is that practice until you're a beginner move okay it's chaos until the spring begin the move although it's confusion until the speaking of all all the confusion and message will be canceled when the spirit begins let me say that in all the confusion all the darkness all the mess in the message that will be wiped out when the spirit begins to move on because God will speak once more the world with Tyra from God once more or glory to God the fire want to be upon the sons of God to speak dusty of the Lord because a bribe alive - here the Lord while she wills keep still when the Spirit begins to move then you look for the miraculous to take place because when omnipotence speak you'll get the Lord I show the miraculous gonna take place or going a goodbye omnipotence I'm Jesus naked clean you can do nothing without me if you forgot you are the branch again through chipper I know we undo your own thing like some disconnected branch and you're on your own you're wrong that is brain that's not connected to the source somebody some group somewhere some pasta and they perfect in with scenes there is one body and by one spirit you have baptized into one body or let me say this with my once great you are connected to the body the body is a spirit connection that's why the first message was you must be born again to get a new birth to get a fresh connection to come from the power source let's continue she said if that tree ever puts forth another branch it will be its original fruit original so that's alpha branch produce something and God sent two processes and God have on listen alpha branch produce another book of Acts that was the Alpha does he simply die Scott's plan alpha produce book of Acts then after the book of Acts though you have grafted plants Church ages grafts grafton Luther Wesley grafts coming in when the Prophet came he brings a condom in the world to bring back original restoration of what was in the beginning that is why it said he shall tell the house of the children back to the faith of the fathers because we are going back to the original or glory of God you are going to be original or cash oh you are going to be original no photocopy no carbon copy no clone and nothing you gonna be original I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last row is the same church just because it wasn't trying to those guys in gonna rupture but it already my god let them get sealed away and it so if it put for another branch it would be original fruit and there's got to be a restoration of all these things right at the end of the vine there is to be a restoration of the evening light to light it up and to make it right and will come out of the vine not a denomination grafted in it but the original production of the word is got a comfort for the even time there will be light in the even time it takes light to write knit it takes what all perfectly in the scripture I did I won't be called the all-night fruit cannot write them unless the sunlight and said that's nature right no matter how much you preach here we go whatever you do it cannot be right man it cannot be manifested it cannot be vindicated only by him you said I am the light of the world so he flatly pancake on the teachers and the preachers and everybody right until the light comes it could only be right when by him who said I am the light of the world okay now watch this what is you know so there has got to comfort a power the Holy Spirit Himself the right or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifested that what he predicted would happen in this day after all the talk is over it has to come for a power the Holy Spirit itself this is the person of the Holy Ghost this is not baptism this is the person of Christ coming among the people as promised he said when we get and then thunders will be worshiping the Living Christ him moving in and out among us he could move in tonight and deliver you he could move in tonight and heal you he could move in tonight and free you he could move in tonight and see you Oh glory to God him moving in and out not faithful moving a little him go give the Lord some praises him moving in a no not some man moving in and out him the capstone him we better feel him not having a tiny ticket him the confirmation halle-loo him Jesus Christ glory to God and if you come looking for him you're gonna find him if they come looking for him you're gonna get him or glowing Ilana come expecting expecting you're gonna see him so there's got to come for the power so that's what I have to preach I have to tell you what this puffy saying I have to tell you what just promise I got all your desk I just gotta call another man another explainer another mechanic something there's got to come for a power the Holies with himself to right panel how we can be right men without the Holy Spirit or the way that I pin you the word is the word the word is receive you the son of man is a sure the world is a cedar when you take the Sun or give the Lord a show nothing wrong what you have you know but it needs to be right nothing what you have but you need to come into presence and to stay on the presence and to walk in presence can live in presence or chlorine of God as middle and by the Spirit of God they are sons of God or hallelujah we talking about breaking into the spirit where you're living here that become your residence that's become your house you'll live in an atmosphere or God put you in there or get the Lord a shout or glowing a God don't you want to live there there's a places around this atmosphere and you are call to it or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah [Music] like ugly I was thinking about Berlin canister sell mainly you want revolution balconies I realize you were very Chinese give us access to the door of the Holy Spirit because the brotherly kindness is blood of the aged and a revelation of brotherly kindness give your feet to attest that door not only that God see the blood on you by revelation and the spirit follows the blood that is why the spirit is here to 90 because the blood is here tonight there is blood here tonight the spirit follows the blood nobody can take the blood of the church glory to God and a special come and go back out but nobody could change this because the spirit follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption all glory to God you are covered by the blood or glory to god that's why presences here you are covered by blood hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is no charity with all the spirit of forgiveness there's no charity there's no real faith because faith is based on forgiveness will give the Lord some praises tonight all these feet talk and feet talk and powerTalk how we could get fit little forgiveness it has to have forgiveness and God make sure you put forgiveness right on the top just be Lord Holy Spirit you put forgiveness right here to see if you will drop your odds to see if he'll forgive receive your continue with your grudges and yet I will let cranky behavior Oh God put that there oh I don't care if you see him at all your door see em and it's still the truth I'm gonna set you free Oh glory to God don't everybody tie you up bang you up with bitterness and anger keep its purity or keep your heart pure or glory to God hallelujah that's why I so know cease against nobody to keep your heart pure that any man are gonna come behind yet for sweet fruit and you can say Amen and the priests foolishness go or give the Lord a shout but the word is caught Oh hallelujah come here for the word only the word not Sebastian I'll that's the confusion that's the gossip in Trinidad your colors that we not preach and gossip we're not preaching back another foolishness we preaching the word the scroll the book God hallelujah nothing out there we gotta pull on the cap we had a call for charity we have a revival we s are bred true this is what we are here for but your nineteen is here the present is here that's your most important thing that means we cannot revive her tonight or call it a God missing limbs to be restored tonight Oh Chloe Devon fix you up on your life tonight [Applause] so let's say did you have to come for the power we had revelation comfort mystery come for inspiration come forth but they gotta go on a power Jesus what the Holy Ghost and power these guys had power not anoint and power power power but what the teachings [Music] be a promise permanent power not temporary power resident power you having a dynamo within you there were dynamics come from you having a dynamo that is self operating inside of you a power within of his belly inside of him have a gelatin that releases when your need of it we have media tonight we have media tonight to break out to break through yes we have a need of tonight are the holes with himself to write the motive indicate or to prove automate manifested what that's what he's predictable happen is day the evening light produces that is what he said Holy Ghost I've been born are the very first over 2000 Holy Ghost them Devils Devils sittin loose Devils damage has been Russia Holy Ghost but God loosely Holy Ghost any form of the world because you have to draw the face because it word is the conductor the spirit that just spirit he had loosed word so when he loosely where the devil can understand that because it what is a mystery but it would is very bright so when you would come in just Burton and that's noise and this will people but that elect divine revelation because in the spirit community a heart know you become a conduit you become an active line that quarter will true God can make you unconnected resource you're not a wood if you put wood unless you see line you work on that nothing you would get conducted you have to become like that electric line that current to flow to you well you were once dead in sin and shame iniquity wanna to convert you and make you a current line or glory to God make you a channel of communication with inspiration to flow through you become a channel of God or when God want to find somebody I knew or

this and leak out that charity bond of perfectness come to seal the building then you become a living moving monument covered by the love of God all of this is things we have to mature into grow into seasoning to get a revelation of intro this is what this is about you know what is called the stature of a perfect man read in Ephesians 4 that he said this being man is completed is the servant of God in the church of god that's calling the rapture he never said this sermon of the minister completely he said this being when it's completed when it is completed that means I start I have a finish that me my start and I'm a completion when it is completed not when you have a potentially we're not talking about that when it's completed where is completed that gonna me rapture or glory to God

Athena here just as an obvious ear magnet talk he is here he's not talk that's real here's here's I control I take every spirit under my control so after he is here he did every spirit of subjection

said you can pick up the message then let the son be all the greenness out of you make mature Christian who must make it the son he passes is right so you see why some people love church because church is a comfort zone from the hot Sun shirts becomes a sheet she becomes a cover in a religious as well as coming to religion they go to church they love to love the message love church this is not so much today like it because this means you have to leave in the presence this means you have to pre and steal and wait wait from the Lord Oh hallelujah you can say lord give me quick our patients won't want it quickly after wait that's a we tell your change come you have to wait for the anointing to come Boren will gonna forests and career and so on hunting and preemie cell usually when your body got a brick to the mosquito is this that I'm just when your body letter Britt you is when all hell does break loose just in bridge later you know but that is the discouraged you the devil do one you see your bridge to door the door right there then I blame you you're going you're going and pressing your pushin and just when you're about to break something happen but you have to hang in there press for you Gideon come on yeah what he said here I mean you know this one listen friends listen I believe the churches to beginning to hear the message and it beginning to understand

people have send things to me a little quotes and whatnot and it's so precious it's so real because it's the depth of God that came and so on so look at this note he said but friends we've got to lean the presence of the Sun we have got to be right on our feet isn't nobody he say intellectually we're hearing a message that God has given us and seen these signs he showed us I'm proving it by the Bible it is here but oh how the church needs to live in his presence till it tenders up and get sweet in the spirit so he can't be done so he's talking about a genuine connection that brings an atmosphere upon your life it will affect your life it will affect your husband it will infiltrate your family it like a flu you see when they get flu it is pastor wrong and Sally hopes you cough it right so when you get this atmosphere it will infect sometimes in my mind I'm singing a song and as a singly song and we saw this thing I said that he seemed so nice singing it's a connection there that's what we talking about it's a connection there so when you get the anointing and you walk inside your home and you begin to sprinkle your 19 in your home let it flick off you believe it all by faith every devil inside that house moving praise got the atmosphere now you can expect you can't expect a nice a presenting home and you look in the Maghreb that kind of wrong kind of thing you looking for a nice elbow you come in and you charge nd you you put in fire to the confusion you looking for trouble you said know what sometimes they speaking the message you get us have to break it like that because they've got a Clinton to make it whole but when the church here we go once gets it which is the core the clean early message watch the elected is call out and separated then we're in the presence of God I know it will be something like the people was dear when it takes the rapture so friends it has got to come to presence ministers pastors preachers all of us after bringing the
