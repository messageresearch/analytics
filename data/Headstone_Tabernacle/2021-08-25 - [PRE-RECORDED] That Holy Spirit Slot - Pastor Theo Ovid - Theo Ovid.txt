tonight and bless your word in jesus name we ask it amen and amen oh blessed be the name of the lord we feel his presence you feel his power here tonight that means anything could happen so god bless you if you have your bibles i'd like to attend the second peter uh 1 4-7 mark 11 22 to 26 and first peter 2 want to read from verse 3 to 9. reading from 2nd peter 1 47. whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving our diligence out to your feet virtue and to virtue knowledge and to nourish temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity mark 11 22 and jesus answer it say it unto them have faith in god for verily verily and verily i say unto you whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said and wherefore therefore i say unto you that what things so ever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which in heaven forgive your trespasses and last scripture tonight from first peter 2 i want to read from verse 3. if so be he have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men not a dead stone a living stone but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones i built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood offered spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture the holy land zan the chief cornerstone elect precious he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallow the same is made head of the corner a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumbled at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but he a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show for the praises of him what called you out of darkness into this marvelous light we are grateful to god tonight may god bless this world you may be seated oh praise god so tonight our title that holy spirit slot so tonight we want to look what hashem could just point across there uh above brotherly kindness uh you get uh l-o-v-e but between l-o-v-e and brotherly kindness is that holy spirit okay and we have their next date the bright age that holy spirit so tonight that's the title that holy spirit start it will tie into what we speak uh spoke last wednesday with uh um blood uh spirit and so on like that amen what a blood spirit praise the lord so let's come let's let's get into the word tonight you love him tonight oh it's good to be here tonight it's good to see all of you out tonight god bless you thanks for coming out we appreciate that and uh this is from the seventh seal this is brother brown i remember i think it was uh this is the time but the brandon gave a dream one of the brothers had a dream and it was connected with a pyramid and he's taken a crowbar ripping it off and then he was telling the brethren look on this he rip it off and he was interpreting the writing outside and then he said light not never shown it before that was part of the whole package and so on like that now this is on the seventh seal he said and on that dream too he told the virgin look on it but they were looking at him instead of looking at what he tell them to do he said very few were looking on what he said to look on this i was in something in the pyramid but all the other virgins look and say where did he go where did he go where did he go where did he go and they were looking after him see and that's what end up happening instead of looking at the pyramid they're looking everywhere else praise the name of the lord but but there are some people who keep looking on this that like he said all right so then he was talking about this in the seventh seal he said notice the next thing i took some kind of bar cut it off on the inside was a white rock that had nothing wrote in it and at that time i started to go west and i told them don't go out west stay here and look on this until i returned and went west for the blast return back to the east with the holy spirit interpreting the unwritten word now if that isn't perfectly the god almighty i don't know what is what i am trying to say this for friends is to show you we are at the end time and if them others is perfectly on dot with the word so is this perfectly i'm done with the word we are the end time soon it shall be time run out millions will lose their lives we talk about how much people die in america right and just keep climbing with the coronavirus because of poor leadership bad management and there's debt everywhere but that is nothing compared to what's going to happen he said millions will lose their lives millions will be and now believe that they are saved and will be counted further for the atomic age we are living at the last hour and by the grace of almighty god by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearance of christ how long brother branham maybe 20 years maybe 50 years maybe 100 years i don't know but maybe in the morning maybe yet tonight i don't know but anybody says they know they're wrong they don't know only god knows oh glory to god soon time will run out time run off for some people tonight they're already gone every day sometime is running out every day so many years seal the way into the kingdom of god every day somebody's being called every day somebody's rejecting christ every day somebody going to hell and somebody go to heaven every single day times runs out for individuals hallelujah to repent to make things right to get back in order time running out and soon time around for this world time shall be no more angel already descended and announced time shall be no more oh glory to god hallelujah he said i am not he will embrace speaking i am his servant and the pillar fire is not he it's in spirit form which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of man purpose to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together just like the pyramid has enoch built we find in that pyramid they never did get the headstone on it why the headstone is yet to come the seven steps in the pyramid we will go to that someday now you notice american dollar the great headstone the seal notice back there in egypt those stones are laying there so perfect at the top and the top the stone is like a great big diamond and that stone could not fit down there at the bottom of the foundation it will not fit on the second foundation or the tilt foundation it will only fit on the top foundation so he was saying these stones will only fit on the top foundation he said abraham faith isn't that right hallelujah isaac love jacob grace pentecostal and they thought perfection the capstone word so on top that word and that word that slab is brotherly kindness and between bradley kindness and love is that holy spirit slot and you tonight have to believe that you are called to be one of them stones to be fitted in that holy spirit slot because that is what christ is coming for oh glory to god the pet the prophet came at the end of the pentecostal age to introduce a bright age which is a hidden mystery because the bible only talked about up the layout is here but the brightness is a hidden mystery so god loose this bright ears to call you oh glory to god when the prophet died the bright age couldn't be just yet because he came to call a bright age and we have to have a history to have a bright age i know we have a history no we have a word we have a sign we have a messenger we have a voice or give the lord a shout the messenger is the holy ghost could we give the lord a shout the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel in the church tonight hallelujah directing us to the word because only the holy ghost could only when we get the word oh we are free tonight oh glory to god free from denomination free from interpretation oh glory to god the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word all glory to god i feel so excited tonight hallelujah praise god because the holy ghost itself will write that word will ride the word i will ride this trail once more there'll be one more ride oh glory to god the holy ghost the white horse rider no matter how stop it no message pope no bishop no church no corona virus no press nothing going to stop i'll ride this trail once more it was the holy ghost that spoke it through that prophet nothing going to stop it oh glory to god i feel at liberty tonight to prophesy i'll ride this trail once more he spoke it it's going to happen the holy ghost going to monk that bride the bride hallelujah the spirit itself going to be upon that bride to give the bride the final voice to the final age once more the world will hear direct from god once more not a man trying to play something but once more the spirit itself build a fire resting on the shoulders of the sons of god in the last days oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god thank you lord thank you lord my god i feel the pull you better feel the pull god and pull you to stay around this here this pull is to pull you into the holy spirit or give the lord a shout the devil is a liar the devil is a liar not to pull you into intellectualism to pull you into the holy spirit that is where you belong oh [Music] [Applause] do you see it this call couldn't come to the luther group this call couldn't come to the wrestling group it couldn't come to jacob grace the pentecostal group it could only come to a jersey perfection bride to be fitted in called out to be fitted in to that holy spirit amen hallelujah oh glory to god and that holy spirit shall types in joshua ministry because moses could only bring them up to the land but joshua was ordained to cross them over into the land of promise and the land of promise and the old and new testament is the land of the holy spirit he says that another world is another land all glory to god we call for this land we call it to fit into this thing oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that thank you lord jesus praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah not one scripture he read his outer order it's perfectly in order peter said actually fed virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness isn't that right hallelujah and god put bodily kindness as the blood for the age of the message of the hour the blood that's supposed to be on your chest isn't that right and jesus said mark 11 he gave the turple first the second pull after and give the first pull and the first pull he said when you stand praying forgive if you have order against any so that means that brotherly kindness and faith is based upon forgiveness so approach the cap the skylight of bradley kindness you've got to be on that platform and this is where the ministers miss at the field they could curse and carry on and and blast this one and make this one and talk nasty about this one and approach the capstone and approach the king because the king is sitting on the throne the king is on the seventh step and to get there you have to have it right you have to have it walking right you have to have talking right you have to have a certain atmosphere and all that was represented by the bells that was upon aerian garment and the oil and the anointing that was upon him you have to walk a certain way you have to talk a certain way you have to move inside there a certain way because he was going into presence and as we get nearer to the headstone as we get nearer to the capstone as we get nearer and we get into his presence we got to come a certain way oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah glory to god speak in terms with god hallelujah glory to god all this come the blood all glory the blood come to bring us in speak in terms speak in terms with god that we could talk to him and access his divine plan mine oh hallelujah let's continue here praise god out to your faith virtue there's some god prof uh this is starting perfect man out to your faith virtue add to virtual knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to your godliness brotherly love to your brother love thee holy spirit and christ will come he said at the braille of what the holy spirit which is in that holy spirit schlotus here and christ will come because just being in him who is him l-o-v-e that's him just beneath him who is him l-o-v-e hallelujah is the holy spirit is the spirit of jesus christ into the church to manifest these virtues because you can manifest it yourself so it will take him who is him the holy spirit the spirit of christ to come into the church to do what to manifest those virtues oh give the lord praises that's why the prophet prophesy when the spirit fall the world will live in the people could we give the lord a shout them not one you say if he said when let me say it again he didn't say if he said when he didn't say and when and if there was a rain to plant the seed there must be a rain to produce the harvest let me hear a shout on that one if there's a seed sold by solomon there has to be a rain come to produce and manifest the contents of that seed oh give the lord a shout no man can tell me there is no more rain there is no more revival there is no more supernatural there is no more power that's alive that's the devil himself that's a revelation from the peter hill there will be one more rhyme there'll be a power that's gonna shake this world like they have never saw before oh glory to god thank you lord jesus hallelujah oh glory to god glory do you love him tonight awesomeness rainbow let me see rainbow and that holy spirit is where i get joseph rainbow coat that is where i get the coat of many colors oh that's the holy spirit that covers the church at world without seem oh hallelujah praise god in that holy spirit slot is where you're gonna be called out the elected the predestinated in that holy spirit slot is where there is a horn in as fitting and are cutting and shaping to fit you inside a deer is not a joint in church we are in the real thing now this is the kernel and the kernel oh glory to god this is the message now when he preaches touch of a perfect man he said this is a message and teach him that will tie the man that is going to be redeemed at the end of this episode that is going in the rapture then he said this being when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's calling the rapture he never talked about a sermon he doesn't talk about the message he never talked about any mystery he said this being when it's completed completed completed completed is the sermon of god in the church of god that's going to rapture if it's not completed they're not going oh give the lord our shout we underwear tonight oh glory to god we underwear tonight i don't care what mighty message they preach [Music] if that is not completed they're not going they will comfort the rest of the tribulation saints they'll be explaining why they miss it like them in in america you know explain why all the lion prophets lie concerning the election in america trying to explain it now you could go this way that way go to talk show go to talk either or go to the royal dice and say unlucky over seven god not only gambling business is here his he said conquer me on this what we see manifested now will be manifested its fullness there will be a power coming to the church that man gonna speak the word it will flash like no lightning no but about that or give the lord a shout the critics are gonna be healed the blind on the sea the are gonna walk without hands being laid on them there's no prediction this is dusty at the lord this is not predicting this is thus saith the lord and the bride will have dust here the lord or she keeps there oh glory to god so in that holy spirit slot you find just for ministry there you find adopted sons dear oh glory to god is not right sons to be fitted inside a deer you have to see yourself fitted inside a deer that is where you belong that is what the journey is all about from egypt to the promised land to get inside the holy spirit slot is not the blood this time it's the spirit when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you but what it is this time is the spirit life of jesus christ as a token that you are all right oh my hallelujah oh glory to god amen [Music] don't shut down a jacob grace in this message the grace i go out of the grace i go don't shut down you have a next title you have a next stop do the perfection you could like what you're called too you're called to be jacob grace where you believe the message you believe nothing unbelievable you are a believer so was the foolish virgins they didn't there was no unbelievers they were believers they just missed the wisdom of revelation to get the extra oil to hit the holy spirit they did not get there they did not stay there oh glory to god in him my god so what he's talking about the holy ghost is the person of christ it's the person of the holy ghost understand this the azusa revival brought many mighty miracles it was god it was the spirit but it didn't have the person it was the anointing it was dynamics but it didn't have the seed oh god do you get that it was god almighty it was the open door there was no messenger there god slammed the door open what caught door god open no mankind shut he said it was the open door and the holy ghost come to that door no man was in control of that it was divine power it was divine unction it was the holy ghost sweeping healing delivering baptizing speaking in tongues supernatural piano playing all kind of manifestation it was god almighty but what we are promised is god himself the word in you being dominated by the spirit itself in the holy spirit's oh give the lord a shout god that's using man he is in the world he put in man what's the secret the word is in the bride go give the lord a shout the pentecostal can't claim that because they are shocked but the word is in you deceiving you what happened son of man come son of man is always a sour showa solomon brings seed that was a perfect bring he brings seed he couldn't release quite quite dynamics where we look back to pentecostal again with all the life without the talking with all the holy ghost without the word with all the mechanics we've been back to pentagons again with a kind of half waiting so god put the word as a seed and say hold that hallelujah dial to that dial to yourself to your flesh i'll cross jordan oh hallelujah glory to god so then you become god's tabernacle or god's house oh here brother branham and there's a man i continue what is it just like the pyramid message you see he went right up this way into the minority with the headstone the ministry of jesus christ oh let me back up a little bit he said when a man in a form jesus making a bell he's got to have a certain tone to put in it and when he is sitting his mole and pouring his iron he puts so much brass so much steel so much copper he knows just exactly how much to put in to give it the right tone and that is what jesus has done to his bride he put in so much looter so much methodist so much presbyterian so much pentecost in it what does he come up with his own perfection so you can eliminate justification and signification but you kindly made all the other things that's what make up the tone if you don't have the ingredients you can get ping when you bear supposed to paint your belgian pong so for you to get the ping you haven't got so much of copper so much a method so much at this so much i tried to hit get the right note are you with me you say what is it just like the proven message you see is keeping right up come to minority with the headstone the ministry of jesus christ on earth has to be here we go the same he had or he can't come to it he is saying they have to be i'll say this way i see what prophecy i i i always say with prophecy it has to be a reproduction of the original grain bringing back the same ministry that jesus had so jesus have to see his own ministry in the church isn't that something does not give me not come join and we hear and rewrite that that you know no they know that at all watch it has to be the same minute as he had or he can't come to it he said just like head to feet the feet is not the head but the head packs the feet you get it where's he with a great light he said yes sir no the dirty rags of yesterday no it just become dirty rags all the time it serves its purpose as clothing now it becomes paper justifications of his time on the looter then it had to become signification to wesley signification save his time till it become the baptism holy ghost and the baptism will go service time until the holy spirit wishes only one god now yeah they tell me use now one god blends into the church and the church into christ and it makes jesus christ reflected on the earth as he promised you in the bible so he's talking about blending now remember we're going to say we're going to take up those words blend and honed so now the holy spirit has to come to blend into the church call yourselves i don't beat it you don't just drop an egg on your egg blend it yeah whisk it so if god had to blend the holy spirit he has to do some whisking if you don't want this with skin thingy you don't want to blend because afterwards you have to be blending with the anointing then the anointing becomes part of you and part of it you can live without it is part of your life part of your walk your talk holiness becomes part of your rhythm part of your speech your action your attitude your life [Music] my my mind now what shall we say here now the church constantly getting the minority with greater powers when the enemy become like a flood based on the sign of the time new york the enemy raises the standard when they spend the enemy come like a flood rather the spirit of god would raise a standard against it no we have left the pentecostal age i guess this is prophecy present now we are coming to where like in the pyramid not pyramid doctrine now but i mean like as the pyramid the headstone when it comes to fit it's got to be honed there's got to be a ministry in the church the true church of the living god to where when the headstone comes christ or the ministry of christ will fit right in together then that brings back the redeemed to take the whole house of god to glory the methodist the baptist but through the great revelations that come out and give their lives and persecution and things for the kingdom of god but that stone is coming so in other words you say we must come to perfection to bring the resurrection that is true but remember christ does all three the shout the voice and the trump is not pastor teacher evans is doing that it's christ doing all three he produced the shout he produced a voice he produced the trump isn't that right but they've got to have a ministry christ's own spirit in the church that he could come down and blend into it to do that all glory to god that's why we've got to come to perfection hallelujah that last step and that's where we continue from the last service last wednesday oh glory to god are you with me now he said under luther was the same holy spirit justification then signification then about the holy spirit he said not three steps of grace but three stations notice when a baby is born they are treating that constitutes a birth isn't that right water blood and spirit the elements that come from his body to make his body it comes from his body is the material to make his bride so water blood spirit is the material to make the bride not word only no no no don't come with that don't try that don't try that it's easy because you study long it's easy because you study hard but there's not you see men just go against the spirit because the spirit does put them out of control jesus said when the spirit is come he will guide you into all truth so he must take man out of the way because the spirit is what taken the whole love oh glory to god i meant the one that because men want to be in church but god sent the holy ghost to be in church oh glory to god holy ghost two gifted men holy ghost true men god using men people think i don't believe god has used men no no no god of jews man holy ghost using men oh hallelujah but the man spirit is a defending altogether i spirit a man trying to dominate the church that's nicolette and spirit now by spirit conquering the laity by mental and intellectual and demonic and political power oh glory to god and we get delivered over that the church the church got busted god god come to redeem yourself after that and he said his church will never go back into that they will mind handle church but never the bribe every bright member will be delivered by the spirit of the living god because you you come from god oh glory you come from that you come from that source hallelujah you come from that element that where your gene belong oh no pastor hole in your gene that's nonsense no pastor of the key to your life that is foolishness or give the lord a shout the god who call you is able to the one that started working you was able to finish it and i challenge you to see any pastor started working you that's a lie is god that stopped the work in you the same one that called you i don't care what conditioning he called you out to that for what purpose to be jacob grace no they committed to perfection that the holy ghost could strike his soul hallelujah upon that fourth foundation oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah and when christ died there was three elements that came out of his body water blood and spirit justification to believe in water signification through the blood and the baptism holy spirit and here we go and this is where we closed off last week now this last great step must come to perfection that the holy spirit has to live in the church so perfectly do you get it tonight that's the holy spirit's shirt come along and walk on brotherly kindness no brotherly kindness the holy spirit or give the lord a shout my god how i could run out of the church right now i could run around the building and come back up now no brotherly kindness the holy spirit when you stand praying for the holy ghost when you stand praying for charity when you stand praying for that super anointed forgive [Music] forgive whatever see that you know they're not teaching them i have a teaching tonight in burlingame that level channel when brother branham was condemning the woman in the restaurant and got tapping on his shoulder and said i forgive yourself would you condemn and he had to go and repent and he got a woman restored when the people was making love in church and rosemary drop down and tell him death death whatever you say will happen and he said i forgive you and he said hold me was please because you see you have to show god's kindness the way god does think the way god does feel they call the woman and adultery and said this one was caught in the very act and the lord wanted moses toner and jesus said which one among you without sin cast the first stone and jesus himself had no sin and he didn't curse all empty believe he said here do i condemn thee go and sin no more who could do that by the power of love who could do that by the spirit of forgiveness who could do that by the power of reconciliation and that's what god come to reconcile sinners unto himself then we have to be like god oh glory to god to express god's kindness oh god to the weak ones and of some of compassion making a difference to those who are weak in the flesh from brute priests oh give the lord some praises tonight the way i shout in the house [Applause] [Music] they rejected the stone to the pyramid cut off to the mountain without without hands god centered do you see it the rejected one the rejected one is the head of the church the head the capstone and the very one that they rejected through this gentile is christ and christ was not cut and put there by as a vicar or son of god or some great dignitary to church he is the holy spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be christ coming amen so lovee christ coming and the holy spirit is what's coming to us to prepare for l.o.v [Music] now watch i've got this shape like a pyramid the horizon of the saints makes the match to glory christ the headstone the rejected stone the all-seeing eye and daniel have you watched the gentile age until the stone come up with the mountains wasn't cut without hands they never put a capsule on that pyramid it wasn't cut off by man's hands it's god hand that cut that stone so when you talk about capstone now which is the seal of the building man in charge of that but i'm saying we do all that we can do that's the mechanics but only gorkas and dynamics so man god didn't give the right of man to dynamics he's in charge of that but you take faith to connect with that because faith could pull along the power of god and faith is based on forgiveness if there's no forgiveness there's no real faith because the faith was that he sent a prophet to the hearts back what to the fate of the father is to pull along what the holy ghost the power to get into the holy ghost you cannot get in that slot by mental up ability is by faith you have to get there so it's a holy ghost send the prophet the holy ghost say behold i send you elijah to give fate into your system to connect back with the power because you need power to enter in you need power to break through the strong barrier to get into rapturing condition oh god lord help me tonight did you hear what i'm saying you need power to get into wrapping condition before the astronauts go out there they have to have a rehearsal down here oh glory to god they have to have a place where they have zero gravity to float and whatnot because that's the atmosphere up there and before we leave here oh glory to god we have to have an atmosphere down here which is the spirit of christ in the church that's why he said there will be a church with jesus christ walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp oh i'm so excited tonight we have a lot to live for we have a lot to look forward for oh glory to god if we move into the temple a great ministry lies ahead oh give the lord a shout i ain't dead at all i'm not back singing hallelujah i'm on fire for god this is what i'm looking for since 1975. oh god a church in order oh glory to god at church and expectation a church cut off from the world and the things of the world we'll give him some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah christ is that stone he wasn't born of a man he was born of god he is coming for a church that has been reborn again by the spirit of god because the strength of that headstone runs through the church like a magnet so i remember about watching the mill and the time they were shaping and a big stone come all that scrap of metal in there and a big magnet won't pick up it all because it was magnetized it we have got to be magnetized to the headstone not some person or some bishop not some man of the hour not so many son of man who is the man of the hour and all that nonsense you have to be mannerised to the headstone who glory to god to who had stolen say it again the headstone that's where to be magnetized to not the church [Music] not this church hallelujah the headstone which is christ the holy spirit the word hallelujah we have got to be manchester headstone that headstone is the holy ghost oh glory to god that headstone is the holy ghost christ and when every one of us that got the magnetism of the holy ghost when that stone strike the image the church will flee to it back into glory she'll be taken up in the rapture of the saints my god seriously there's a time you say might be closer than you think that's got me steered time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be so my brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders oh they mean that pyramid down there that holy ghost is very tough this is that that's right that's where the sun does at oh hallelujah if that be so then the pyramid is capped by voices what the devil couldn't know what the devil can't handle oh glory to god the rainbow inside the deer joseph rainbow caught inside the deer oh glory the father loved that son called joseph give him a robe of many colors and he'd given the church a robe of many colors how else could we stand the world concert churches how else would we stand the press they're gonna come we have to have the robe of many colors we can't wait for the press to get a rope we had a rope then they could come with the press oh give the lord i shall come on say amen say amen we are waiting for them to get robbed you have to get wrong first for them to come why they was in the upper room why anyone had the door shut because they were waiting for the robe [Applause] glory the bridge of god was already breathed upon him received the holy ghost he had just openly understanding of the scriptures and opened the understanding of the word he breathed on them it was the breath of god upon them he gave them a promise behold i send you the promise of my father no promise i don't minister the promise of my father tiring the seat of jerusalem until you'll be doing power from on high not paul from some church not far from some connection that's almost a minister who knows more than everybody else power from on high the on high part of the path oh glory to god only god could bring along that part the unhide part they don't know how it's coming they don't know when it's coming they didn't know what time it coming all in all it was coming and when the day of pentecost was fully come there was in one mind help me tonight there was a one accord is this real for you or not i'm not crazy if i am crazy leave me alone i want to stay crazy oh hallelujah and they were filled so god failed oh glory not something quick into your hair failed they were filled god dipped them in the spirit and straightened them out and they still couldn't be straightened out because they dance they walk on like drunk men filled with new wine [Applause] and if that same holy ghost come back where would you celebrate oh glory to god you're gonna be like trump man all over again because one lord one faith oh god i feel tonight hallelujah one baptism oh help me tonight i feel for old fashioned river oh glory to god tonight is my night hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah god still speak in tongues god shall heal the sick god still raise the dead god still cast out devils god still killed cancer god will never be from humor god can restore god deliver that slightest [Music] [Applause] seriously think about a georgia minister that seriously think at all he said seriously think they should take it serious then the pyramid capability 700 this should get serious because the tunnels is the capstone where am i at oh i can go raptor without thunders and thomas is the cap so therefore the cap of revelation and manifestation then exactly exactly mechanics and dynamics then oh you mean just like enoch his mechanics became dynamics oh yeah the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you mean the word is spirit yes holy spirit slapped is the same word turn into spirit making that the kingdom of god in you oh glory to god hallelujah do you see it tonight behold the kingdom is within you [Applause] we continue you say you remember the pyramid message it is the caption what did it do the holy spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we added our faith righteousness godliness kept adding till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is god and that is how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the holy spirit oh glory to god where is that holy spirit that seal is that between l-o-v-e and brotherly love holy spirit's isn't that right and that word is the word from luther wesley paul arenas martin columba luta all the word to the ages which was the scattered word he put all that word and put it inside of you and put a pyramid inside of you it's the pyramid of your life in mechanic form that's the secret the entire pyramid is a seed put inside of you hallelujah then if that be so brother branham he got seven church ages that is immune and he had seven mysteries that had been summoned away and they fought for to bring back that he knew and now the heads don't come the cap of the church does the thunders mean that so what in you is what god's seen to keep now the cap can't come down unto brotherly kindness the capital come down holy spirit these stones have to be called out to be fitted into the holy spirit slot because it's from dear you will be raptured because in there you find heavily places and there you find another ephesians is there you find super church super race has been near the headstone oh glory come on now as we need a headstone superchurch nowhere in the holy spirit [Applause] isn't that what the god tell the prophet pick up a pen and write as the bride near the headstone she will be a super race a super church what he's talking about he's talking about holy spirit he's not talking about brotherly kindness he's not what you in the same spirit of christ was oh glory to god the works of christ saint john 14 12 the same was i do shall you do also you can erase that you can't change that that is still the word all glory of god has to be fulfilled or in a bride [Music] nobody burn him and blasphemous name he was saying he said when you say automobile he said no i'm not a mechanic it's got to be plugs and coils and balls and valves and everything else so when you talk about baptism of the holy spirit there's a lot that goes with that so he's comparing the battle he goes with the same automobile a different kind that manually have automatic walking thinking of door trunk back we have this world called automobile so when i talk about baptism he said a lot of things goes with it okay he said no peter said first fate now what are you close faith now to your faith then you add virtue and temperance and so on like that and love and i even know love is god now then bringing this into the seventh church ages god is building in seventeenth ages are bright for christ so this was the structure of building a bride that is the ages of the state dispensation then and the same way he built the ages he built you he can't break his principles he can't break his laws he was building a bride under the nose of satan because all these messengers were hidden in the seals it only said white torch reduced a loss black horse and so on but these messengers was hidden under the land anointing ox anointing man anointed eagle anointing they were hidden behind here to call out the elect devil totally blindsided because in every age the elect was called out and sealed away this is the first elect satan have to deal with it mano amano man to man he had to deal with this bride because this bride was sent in satan's eden to defeat him do you hear that tonight did you get that tonight [Applause] this will be such a defeat that when he look for the price he's raptured and the devil will be so upset he will make war with the remnant of the woman's seed which is the church members in this message i call them the tribulation saints that hearing message preached tonight around the world without real revelation because they ever went in scott's eden and trade on god's bride and god waited until they have the highest technology the highest amount of sin highest among our loss and sex and filth and pornography you name it a day is there and it's having a clean pure virtual sinless brain going to come out in this age and prove to the devil prove to satan she's not like eve oh glory to god she's not only staying behind the world you know she will become the word itself and the same voltage power that satan felt when jill well it is written is the same power you will feel this bride because this bride will be extension of jesus christ what jesus began to do and continue to do what she just began to do and continue to do she's going to write another book of acts or give the lord a shout it will be the acts of the holy spirit oh glory to god that same holy spirit slot from dear acts of the holy spirit write another book of acts hallelujah who there to guide you who they tell some man some bishop some pope the holy ghost itself my god my lord my lord my lord glory to god he has built a bride born a bride begotten a bride on earth for christ and the same way he bears his bride he has begotten individuals so our sister shepard had a dream and the dream was she was wondering lord if i have got the holy ghost can you prove to me some safe i shouted he said watch you said she saw she dreamed this dream and baram saw the dream that's how you can interpret it she dreamed her dream she was up on a mountain in this mountain it was a rock box her husband was behind her she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water that she'd ever seen pouring it into this box this rock box setting up the mountain and the rock box could not hold the water it rolled right out there just boiled up the trash and sticks and everything in there ball it out rolling up the mountain roll over her feet she was standing right in that stuff only didn't stick to her then she asked why the box didn't hold it the man said that is not water that's the holy ghost that's nothing will hold it he said he went back and got another big bucket it was full of honey and poured the honey into deer and he said no it would hold this and she taught the box the rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and held it she turned and went down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped on the bottom of the mountain and looked back she saw five streams of pure crystal water not contaminated by the things that had been through still pure clear coming swiftly then it slowed up then almost feed it out and she was wondering would it ever reach the bottom of the mountain five streams that she woke up so but the brandon began to interpret the rock box his rock confession upon this rock blessed also amber jonah uh but my upon this rock i'll build my church he said no that has been each church age hasn't had a rock confession which is a rock revelation right so there's a revelation that what when the whole stuff okay he's not you cannot make a holy church one two there's no such thing as the holy church or hold on tradition right three the holy spirit can be preached in it but in dear you find good bad renegades and different than everything else so somebody judging the church by one member is foolishness because in the church you find let me say it again good bad renegades and indifferent let me say that again it just see this unseen that no we call them scenes we call them brothers and this he said in the church you find good bad renegades and indifferent places that tree cannot believers and everything else so an organization will not hold it you can't say and i don't understand how believers could read these things and see the foolishness you can't say we got it none of the rest of them has it so when people in their churches believe they own their pastor or their group or their only channel of god and and people come to them to hear it and to see it and whatnot this is it is contrary he said you can't say that he said you can't say that if anybody say hear that they will hear from me don't let me hear you say that reading whispered don't let her come back in my ears you know he said you can't say that you know some spirits they hear that but they want to see that you know because they're feeling led the holy feeling is bad it's sitting upon the middle jesus jesus jesus be the boy don't worry the christ i'm not living god just had to be crucified no no no he said get behind me satan sit and jump on him right after you can't see that all right none of the rest of them have no sir the holy spirit is part of the individuals so tonight people hearing us tonight could holy speak about that in their house they don't even have to be in church glory because the holy ghost is poured out on individuals i tell you when he was young he messaged and i read what i'm saying one is a majority in god i wear them my knees and say lord i'm a majority are we going to pray for stuff yes why i say won the majority i feel like a real big majority one is the majority and goes in them oh glory to god now in this church the message the message is being poured into the church this tabernacle we see here she comes to church this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle there is no such a thing individuals that come into this church is holy ghost tabernacles they are tabernacles that contain the holy ghost but not the church therefore it runs out so you take a bucket of holy ghost it pours into the church it goes sweep all the trash fill people individuals by going right through the church can hold it like how some people like if they're renting the angel they say the angel with his brother the angel with his pastor and people fighting the angel of the lord like the angels have a rental apartment in the church and you have a sexual rejection he just living there yeah the injured apartment yes he has a new scripture he isn't really prophet but he enjoyed this one and he wrote that one and when they hear what they're speaking you could know that angel is with them you know but not the issue of the lord i don't know what name i don't know where he comes from but it's certainly not from heaven it's not the israel it's somebody in general because the india being in revelation they're not in scriptures not in the message they call it hidden mysteries hidden from god and all right hidden from hearing from the prophet the brother didn't reveal it see god sent a prophet to reveal all the mysteries and if a man preaching a mystery now that i can't find any word he only own and people like that become man invented you know they're saying something prophet didn't see you know i mean fresh they find this is boring i only say in bad things a man say years ago why think we're reading scripture look how long genesis is written but you know moses didn't reinvent that oh gosh i feel like in the beginning was the word or the beginning moses just screamed that because he takes some marijuana and some ganja and something going to his head is god spoke to him and we take that as dusty at the lord holy men move as they were moved by the holy ghost this is the written word that's why the prophet said the spirit and the brave prophet will say the same thing i'm not embarrassed about this message i'm not embarrassed about this word i don't have to bring my own revelation and my own interpretation and my own explanation i am locked in my job is to find promises to preach and i'm preaching to you tonight the holy spirit shot is where you belong is where you are to aim at is where you are to press out the man was born in the water was the messenger to the church pouring a message to the church and the water was doing it was boiling all the trash that was in it that is what the holy spirit does and i'm talking about revival revivals they're getting trash out of the church people but no revival they're a bunch of stinkness all weed walking i will pan all kind of nonsense inside the church and sing a message song on top of that as if mr strong's revival i said that intellectual songs no juice in it no anointing in it no atmosphere in it and that's supposed to be message because you have things and messages in it yeah it's good for information but not for inspiration informational songs we need inspiration song listen daniel couldn't uh david couldn't play a message song for saul you know that spread upon stolen moving messages he had a prayer inspirational song he had praying because you know devil casting knowledge of the atmosphere his devil is upon the man when david presents his music so it bring an atmosphere is the atmosphere to run them devils even them difference in your home will take your atmosphere you can all come out there will come whatever what spiritually you have atmosphere you create that atmosphere you come to church to get connected to atmosphere now when you go back in your house that atmosphere could vibrate over you you know it coming off of you oh glory to god is the atmosphere hallelujah could we give the lord a shout glory hallelujah hallelujah glory hallelujah so therefore the message is pure it's pure word it will boil the trash out and even in pasture kind of crazy stuff and all kind interpretation is still pure uncontaminated it's still written it's still there we can still say what he tapes see we forget all the way into position it's still here no you see my i do like brother so-and-so or brother jones i don't like brother son so he said but let something happen to that brother your heart is broke nearly killed you we can't obtain burly kindness and fearing for one another but to maintain a group and so on so he's talking about um you know that that forgiveness then isn't a group you're getting that that's what could hold in the church brotherly kind of spirit of forgiveness see so that is why we stress we strive for that because that is what the holy spirit is coming down upon the atmosphere of brotherly kindness spirit of forgiveness i like that i'm not teaching a very kind i say people teach that and explain that we're in brotherly kindness but we can't break they just talk we're talking about the spirit of spirit of forgiveness you see when that comes husband forgive wife why forgive husband i have had to forgive children children forgive parents when that spirit comes to atmosphere oh glory to god make you put your put yourself in the person's position and put your shoes on oh my want to skip down quickly you know i'm gonna skip down so he's talking about our streams of grace i wanna just get down can i get this he said but those gifts of god with all these virtues in them we should call please makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by god this has to be first so it is important to understand why this time of lingering in this message because god wants to see this this has to be first when you have faith virtual knowledge temperance patience goodness bully kindness then the holy ghost comes down and seals you as a unit this is specific are we driving slow down this road we're not talking about pentecost we're not talking about 1906. we're talking about when these things are added he said then the holy spirit come down on syria as a unit the same as receiving the church ages as a unit so in other words he can't seal the church ages until it's completed after it's completed so the prophet come to the enemy age and he could look back and say look at ephesus sardis taitara pogamos you see he come to the end and look back so then he could show the cap will come it was rejected but we are the end now so we know what coming next the count of the cap is the coming of the christ the coming of the cap is the coming of the stone that's totally to end the gentile dispensation then they could go to 145 000 jews but there's a ceiling angel to come to close it off the angel from the east having the seal of the living god the cap and we're going to read it as we close and we get down to the closer the cap the pyramid of your life oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah the same way he makes his bride is the same remixes individual made all the same material oh glory to god you can't imitate them they got to be god sent and god born imitation only causes confusion it has to come from inside out and it produces christianity god by the power of the holy spirit our sister had her feet wet when she got to the bottom and then he talked about god accepted the foundation and so on here's what's wrong with brahms i'm not good you see there are two different kinds of fate they're two different kind of virtue about human virtues human faith human body kindness natural virtue natural and people say no in church but they're natural stuff we're not talking about that you're talking about blood transfusion such a perfect man put you in your preaching theater get your blood out and put the blood jesus in put the blood jesus bring the feet of jesus virtue of jesus knowledge of jesus not your knowledge knowledge of jesus temperance of jesus isn't that right that faith and he said no watch what what we have the biggest part of it is mental fate a mental fate only here in the world bring us our mental recognition of god but then from above if it ever strikes this there is a godly spiritual fate so he's talking about the operation of the holy ghost to strike a mental fate and make it a spiritual revelation and that faith only recognizes the word so regardless of what the man say and preach the only way they could recognize isn't that right now the five streams you see coming down through here tempest together has been the holy spirit that made the ephesus church it was the holy spirit that birthed the introduced new word here now birth the smiling church the holy spirit give the approval mastery tytara church and build that bride there's an elected predestinated by jesus christ that the holy spirit has called out the elect and it's been the holy ghost in this age in that age in that age onto the top of the holy spirit now as in individuals these virtues and things knowledge temperance is added to it then here we go when the capstone comes the holy spirit cements it together there is the baptism of the holy spirit that's the automobile that all the parts the plugs deploy the condensers and everything else inside this fan the radiator everything in there that's it there is the baptism of the holy spirit that is why it is short so short today so then you talk about from faith so in other words from faith to love sees you at christ then you have the person of the holy ghost living inside of you and that is not talking he said well speak for itself he will make let it be made known it will make itself known i must say how you say it it will make itself known you will have to speak a word it will speak for itself he said no watch what was number one number one coming down to your mental fate holy spirit coming along into your mental fate making it spiritual faith number two tree then you'll have a spiritual revelation you'll have the holy spirit i will seal all these things into you as the holy spirit covers this from your faith here we go up to the holy spirit the slot he's talking about seals you in with christ then you become one amen then you become one at that day you shall know i'm in the father you me and i in you then that's a sealed unit of the lord god then is when they are vindicated and placed not before then let me say it again then let our pastors figure their own and their vindicated no nothing at all zero only mouth only talk then they are vindicated i'm reading then they are vindicated and placed and when that time takes place they become vindicated sons and daughters of god right now we are sons and daughters of god but then they become vindicated sons and daughters of god hollow that song and god tonight when when you're in the holy spirit slot that's inside a deer that spirit slot you become vindicated sons and daughters of god not a devil move till you say so i take heavy spirits under my control for the glory of god hallelujah oh hallelujah when a member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these verses in him that god can see virtue and knowledge and temperaments and patience and so forth then and then god seals him and places him that is when you see the son of he say it again when god can see it oh glory to god so you don't have to impress nobody impress god shame how much faith you have how much virtue you have show off your temperance to god let him see how much patience you have let joe be a fight with your patients oh glory to god hallelujah praise god let your brother look at his flow like a river oh glory to god make it make people come around you because you're sticky with love they're sticky with honey oh give the lord some praises hallelujah now therefore watch when the church comes into this place or the individual listen this is good for you tonight watch when the church comes to this place or the individual the church is going to be there let me see it real good so you get it the church is predestinated to be there i want to be part of it how to become part of it by one spirit you cannot join the church you could join a lodge i think if god tempered his bride together with that spirit and then it tempers the individual together with that spirit then you're born into the kingdom and then the very life that was in the church is in the church praise god that very life that was in the vine is inside of you isn't that right oh my patience oh my test don't worry satan will count them for you i'm climbing up the ladder now i've added virtual knowledge and temperance i've added patience i still ain't got the holy ghost then i added patience godliness don't misbehave myself go like a christian gentleman or two nobody put on he said watch it's birth it's a bit i've been booted into this i've been breathing all over the jews watch and then the love of god christ come down and seals all that up in me for service [Music] say when be some just who went is those who got sent as my father sent me so send are you some just went but there will be those who god will sell sent once sent because my father is in them so they know become sent one and he who receive who i send receive me because i send them i'm in them i'm vindicating myself to be in them oh glory to god what does he do when he gives me the holy ghost he sets you up in a separate place to yourself you're going to play something you're a different person then you're not of the world no more you're clothed different you're dressed different not the outside dress no no you don't have to be odd and peculiar he said it's a spiritual dress that comes the wedding garment is put on you oh you mean you already wear the gum before you leave here yes oh give the lord i shout glory to god his wife hat made herself ready she is putting on the clothes of the world and dressing herself in the garment of his promised word final quote and i'm done but i'm praying from the contest let us stand our feet and let us stand tonight you see the contest is on paul said forgetting those things that are in the past all our mystics of last year i pressed towards the mark of the high calling all my mistakes that i've made in all these years forgive me for them god forgive me church forgive me on a ministry i have filled with i feel god forgive me for your church forgive me of my mistakes i press towards

mistakes of last year and as we approaching the debt of 62 and the boot of 63 and we see the debt of 2020 in the boot of 2021 oh god may we be one step higher up the ladder until we can see jesus and his program may everyone hear lord in prayer while the olia is dying and the new birth of the new year is coming and may the old man of sin and unbelief doubt in our heart and a new word come in with
