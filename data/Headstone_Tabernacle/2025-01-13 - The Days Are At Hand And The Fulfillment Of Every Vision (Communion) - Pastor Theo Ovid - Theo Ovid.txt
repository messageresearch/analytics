read from verse 21 to 28 Ezekiel chapter 12 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel saying the days are prolonged and every Vision feel it tell them therefore thus sayeth the Lord God I will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain Vision nor flattering devation within the house of Israel for I am the Lord and I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days oh rebellious house will I say the word and will perform it seeth the Lord God again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man behold they of the House of Israel see the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesied of the times that are a far off therefore say unto them thus sayth the Lord God there shall none of my words be prolonged anymore but the word which I have spoken shall be done say the lord god let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word and we pray your presence will come into it come among us and come upon your people speak to us we wait to hear from you in Jesus name ask it amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord before we have communion we have something that we want to share with you and have a title for this exhalation the days are at hand and the Fulfillment of every vision and have an inspiration the spirit of Prophecy now this month and next month is very interesting this January and February in January 2025 a notable planetary alignment will occur featuring Mars Venus Jupiter and Saturn appear in night sky so six planets going to be aligned in this January month this event is expected to be most prominent between January 15th and 21st will Peak around January 17th and 18th during this period Venus and Saturn will be visible and so on like that and February 28th 2025 AR Ray alignment involving seven planets Saturn Mercury Neptune Venus Uranus Jupiter and Mars will be visible from the earth this phenomenon often referred to as a planetary parade is the visual effect resulting from the planet positions along the epileptic plane lot of high talk but God put these things for signs and Seasons okay let's go Genesis 1:14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament and the heavens to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years so all that is happening now so strange fire and then the alignment of these planets six in January 7 in February and here it is but Bram hting on the wall he said at the junction of each age we have had several Junctions of time when time Runs Out man's ability fades take note when time Runs Out man's ability Fades Rian 10811 The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open at the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter the shab in th mouth sweet as honey I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was my mou sweet as honey as soon as eaten it my belly was bitter he said thou must prophesy again I want to emphasize that must part that must part is the part the bride have to pick up thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings the Amplified you must make a fresh prophecy concerning peoples and races so Revelation 10 th must prophesy what what must we prophesy the word isn't that right so we must prophesy the word so all these 700 seeds of Revival of the Bride Revival and dynamic in the mechanic had to be prophesied by that Spirit of Prophecy that's my inspiration tonight the spirit of Prophecy praise God so the days at hand and the Fulfillment of every vision and the inspiration is the spirit of Prophecy so this all these promises for the bride exclusive promise for the bride seven give Faith show the bride how to prepare bride's Revival Holy Ghost Dynamics all these promises for the bride had to be spoken by a fresh prophecy brought by the word nothing outside of the word the word itself isn't that right so brother Branham restored this big prophetic Vision that we could speak by prophecy I like to say it like a puzzle you see the picture of the puzzle then you know how to fit the pictures all the pieces of the puzzle all everything mix up and jumble up but because you have the vision because have the picture on the puzzle box you could fit this here fit that there every it taking time but it going to be built up and when that prophecy going to complete it's fulfilled because when it's fulfilled you don't need to prophesy you said this day this scripture is fulfilled you don't have to prophesy when in its fulfillment but before it is fulfilled you prophesy but Los Angeles you prophesy about whatever to take place around the world we have to prophesy the bride must prophesy again oh praise God give the Lord some Praises Revelation 19 let us rejoice and be glad give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a rain L fine and white clean and white for the fine linen in is the righteousness of saints he said unto me blessed the day which are called unto the marage supp of the Lamb he said unto me these are the true saints of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him He said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so I want to hear say this today that the Dynamics is here in the form of the spirit of Prophecy and that is what we have had all these years we preaching what the promises that the prophet brought oh give the Lord some Praises we preached that by the spirit of Prophecy and we have had the testimony of Jesus and we have the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy that prophesy over you that you will have a Revival that you will be filled with the Holy Ghost glory to God that the quicking power will come upon the bright Church glory to God to the spirit of Prophecy listen that God plac upon us is the testimony of Jesus oh give the Lord some praises and he said this Covenant this Blood Covenant is an Everlasting Covenant it wasn't called an eternal Covenant because that would wouldn't be it wouldn't be because it wouldn't be eternal when we are redeemed it is all over there therefore it is called an Everlasting Covenant which means a certain amount of time till time runs out but when the angel came down the angel saw time shall be no more you know was time was running out oh give the Lord some Praises there will never be another one when time runs out we won't need a covenant but until times runs out we need a covenant a blood Covenant the blood speaking on your behalf oh go all your mistakes all your faults all your failures the blood speaking better things on your behalf Give the Lord some Praises his blood was shed to speak on your behalf oh Hallelujah glory to God watch there is no sin praise God worship Him show forth his promised power God's bloodbound token bound Covenant people has the spirit of Jesus in here isn't that new testament means Covenant that's right Testament means Covenant the New Testament means the New Covenant the new the Old Testament was old under the lamb the life could not come back upon the believer the New Testament was the Lamb of God and his life comes back on us blood life blood life is the New Testament life is in the blood of the Lamb which mean the New Testament New Covenant that God after those days will I write my laws after all this Old Testament and all the law for Moses he said I will write my laws upon the fleshly tables of their heart so that Stony rock that Moses come up Ten Commandments that was a reflection of what God was going to write upon you oh glory to God promised he going to write his laws in your heart Oh Glory that you become a written epistle because the Finger of God going to be writing in you just as the Finger of God wrote upon those Ten Commandments upon the rock God finger going to write in your heart and when God write on you the devil can unwrite that the devil can erase that that the devil can't take that out of you oh give the Lord some pray a new heart I will give you a new spirit I'll put within you and I'll put my spirit inside of your spirit God promis you a new heart a new spirit and his Spirit you're going to be powered by God oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah not upon Stony tables and Lamb's blood you say yeah I got blood over here what does that do but upon the tables of your heart the spirit Covenant will I me with people so the new life New Covenant shows Jesus has met every requirement for us that god require to make us truly Sons and Daughters of God under the blood where there is no condemnation under the blood no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and my words are spirit and life your character is God's character what is it a little push over no sir God is a god of judgment he's a god of correct it must be on the line nothing else would do that's the kind of character you are because you in the character of your father now watch the life then this life for the blood the life itself the life it it come from the blood right the blood was applied and the life could not come back under the Believers animal life but this human being talk about Jesus it was a super super super human being that makes the human being now not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of God of the super super super super life that was in him come back upon you the super super super super life that was in Christ come back upon you then you are more than a conqueror oh give the Lord a shout and this super life comes upon you and change you from a sinner and to on a church member are denom I shall go to a born again Christian filled with the Holy Ghost the life of God flowing through you Sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness as the holy spirit is speaking oh praise God if sin is in our heart then it condemns us we might as well not even start you got to be free from sin and if you're in sin God want to free you from that sin glory to God if you confess your sins and repent then you get free from it you don't have to go and sin no more you don't have to go in the environment to encourage what you used to do some more so if you're a drinker and you was drinking and you always drinking you do go back in environment where you have booze and all kind of

Sanctified from the things that is not the token so sanctification is not the token I'm cleansed I'm no longer smoking I'm no longer drinking I'm no longer fornicating I'm no longer running around that's good but you need more than that you need a spirit he said the spirit is the token the spirit of Christ come upon you that Spirit come upon you like Simeon he was normal normal normal God told him he will not see death until he see lost Christ Mary Walking with the baby see see didn't rec there thousands of women walking through with their babies Mary walking and the spirit that give him

lead you correctly when you are led by the spirit of God and he cannot lead you where he can't keep you oh give the Lord a shout in the house he will not lead you to where he cannot keep you wherever he lead you he can keep you have faith in God this evening oh blessed be the name of the Lord let me finish off here you can't get the token from the railroad fear until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is to pay it then he said this full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience so God will test you to see if you would obey age doesn't mean a thing you don't pass from age you're in eternity your life is hidden God through Christ don't be afraid of man what he can do to you I am with you my grace is sufficient for you when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even debt are you defeated you are more than conquerors oh give the Lord a shout we are not to fear his love cast out all fear we had to

glory to God when Jesus said Lazarus come forth Lazarus had no choice but to come forth oh give the Lord some praises glory to God Amen we are not to fear his love cast out fear oh the devil bring hatred I'm going to keep those who fight the humble of God and scuff and Destroy let them do it and do it they will but all in the name of God and religion but they lie they are not of God they have all theight of the devil when he comes down from heaven clo with a light pill of light Cloud rainbow over his head rainbow Covenant Christ with one foot upon the sea one foot he said time be no more time shall be no more and seven Thunders thr their voices out what if it is something to let us to know how to enter into Rapture in fate will we run and leap over the walls is there something fixing to happen that these old mad vile bodies are going to be changed can I lift a seat it oh Lord is this so close I could lift the seat in this generation what time is it where are we at time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens seriously think if it is the pyramid is kept by the seven tunders my god when them seven tunders UT the voices this is brother I'm speaking time would be no more Hallelujah if the ministry of the mysteries of God is finished what if is them seven Mysteries coming forth a Humble Church like ours almighty God regarded the lowest state of his people a message will wind up the loosens and would introduce the Messiah just before his coming you hear that introduce the Messiah just before is coming who's Messiah anointed word so the word itself anointed that makes the Messiah that anointed word had to be introduced that's what he said then you are worshiping the living Christ him moving in and out I am not the living Christ Christ have to come among us then we know he is here oh give the Lord some Praises that's what brother Bram said he is here I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God because he is here are you looking for it he has to appear and then come he appears before he come so this Angel bring the next announcement what is it what if is something to let us know to enter in Rapture in faith will we run and jump over walls and so on he said remember the first pull I tried to explain it he said don't do that second pull don't try all you remember he said the turple is coming but don't try to explain it he said I feel Duty bound will this be the mystery that would open up that would bring Christ bring up power to the church power has to come to the church it can't be paper testimonies it can't be just books and tapes it can't be just be coming to church and going back home power have to come into the church and you have to be under expectation for such a manifestation God said tell them that the time is at hand and the effect of every Vision Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the land of promise is the land of the Holy Ghost the promise is the holy spirit that's the promise the the Holy Ghost it's a process to get ready to inherit I'm closing we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things the Seal of the Plan of Redemption from before the F of the world it every bit ends it is the end it's the end of struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything is there is is there the end of the trumpets is the ends of the V is the end of time time Runs Out seven Thunders under the voices and time is running out can you think about that now is it that when seven Thunders Al the voices time has run out for the Gentiles he said after the door is shut God will anoint the church then this is scary my pause is Raising after the door of the Gentile is closed God will anoint the church then power all kind of thing taking place and people can't take it people can't receive it because it was already shut and a bride dear who has been having the testimony of Jesus Christ for years under the spirit of Prophecy step forward Healing The Sick casting all Devils raising the dead and nobody else could be saved bearing witness to the Eternal loss judgment on the earth an anointed bride preparing to leave here oh blessed be the name of the Lord this is not game times Runs Out time shall be no more pray praise God everything runs up in the time the end of this seven seal is the end of the Seven Seals is the end of the trumpets is the end of the vs even ends the ushering of the Millennium is on the seven seal what that seventh seal it just ends the time of the world it ends the time of this ends time for that it's end time for this everything ended up under that seven seal oh praise God I'm going to close with that I'm going to close it so Jesus prophesy about the beginning of Sorrows are we entering to that when the five planets aligned 1965 but the Bram said that represented an infant Church born into manifestation five planets align by February 28th note the date time of Life Next 28 days Sarah I will return unto
