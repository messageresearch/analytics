[35:56] god bless you and welcome if you have
[35:59] your bibles i'd like you to turn to
[36:01] second timothy chapter two
[36:03] we want to read from verse 19 to 22.
[36:08] second corinthians chapter six one read
[36:11] from verse 14 to 18
[36:13] and malachi chapter 3 we want to read
[36:16] from
[36:17] 1 to 3. read in 2nd timothy
[36:24] 2.
[36:28] nevertheless the foundation of god
[36:29] standed sure
[36:31] having this seal the lord knoweth them
[36:34] that are his
[36:35] let everyone that nameth the name of
[36:38] christ
[36:39] depart from iniquity iniquity is known
[36:42] to do right and doing wrong
[36:44] but in a great house they are not only
[36:47] vessels of gold
[36:48] and silver but also of wood and of earth
[36:52] and some to honor some to this honor
[36:55] if a man therefore purge
[37:00] himself from these he
[37:03] shall be a vessel under honor sanctified
[37:07] and meet for the master's use and
[37:10] prepared
[37:11] under every good work free also youthful
[37:14] lust
[37:15] but follow righteousness faith
[37:18] charity peace with them that call on the
[37:21] lord
[37:22] out of a pure heart we read from
[37:26] ii corinthians chapter 6
[37:33] verse 14. be
[37:37] not unequally yoked together with
[37:39] unbelievers
[37:41] for what fellowship are righteousness
[37:43] with unrighteousness
[37:45] what communion had light with darkness
[37:48] what concord had christ with
[37:50] bear what part had he that believed with
[37:53] an infidel
[37:54] and what agreement had the temple
[37:57] of god with adults for ye
[38:00] are the temple of the living god
[38:04] as god hath said i will dwell in them
[38:08] and walk in them and i will be their god
[38:12] and they shall be my people
[38:16] wherefore come out from among them
[38:20] and be separate saith the lord and touch
[38:23] not the unclean thing and i will receive
[38:26] you
[38:27] and will be a father unto you and ye
[38:29] shall be my sons
[38:31] and daughters said the lord almighty
[38:34] and let's read from malachi chapter 3
[38:37] reading from verse 1.
[38:42] behold i send my messenger and he shall
[38:45] be peered away
[38:46] before me and the lord
[38:49] whom he seek shall suddenly come to his
[38:53] temple
[38:54] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[38:57] he delight
[38:58] in behold he shall come saith the lord
[39:01] of hosts
[39:03] but who may abide the day of his coming
[39:06] and who shall stand when he appeared
[39:10] for he is like a refiner's fire
[39:13] unlike fuller soap and he shall
[39:16] sit after as a refiner
[39:20] and a purifier of silver and he shall
[39:23] purify the sons of levi
[39:25] and purge them as gold and silver that
[39:27] they may offer unto the lord
[39:29] an offering in righteousness may god
[39:32] bless his word
[39:32] you may be seated
[39:41] [Music]
[39:47] good morning and god bless you
[39:50] greeting to those connected to us
[39:54] on the internet it's a blessing to be
[39:56] here this morning
[40:03] this morning i have a title
[40:07] it's the refiner's fire
[40:12] the refiners fire i have a subject
[40:17] the fiery trial which is the trial
[40:21] another inspiration purged vessels
[40:25] ready for the master's use
[40:29] that's my subject purge vessels ready
[40:32] for the master's use
[40:35] so we see how the lord will what the
[40:37] lord will do for us today
[40:41] the subject the fiery trial which is the
[40:43] trial is taking on the scriptures first
[40:45] peter
[40:46] 4 12-14 which peter said beloved think
[40:49] it not strange
[40:50] considering the fiery trial which is to
[40:52] try you or some
[40:54] as do some strange thing happen to you
[40:58] but rejoice in as much as your partakers
[41:00] of christ's sufferings
[41:02] that when his glory shall be revealed ye
[41:04] may also be glad with exceedingly great
[41:06] joy
[41:07] if he be reproached for the name of
[41:09] christ happy a ye
[41:10] for the spirit of glory of god rested
[41:13] upon you
[41:14] and for their part he's evil spoken of
[41:16] but on your part
[41:17] he's glorified so that is where i get
[41:19] that that subject from
[41:21] that uh content think it's not strange
[41:24] the fiery trials
[41:25] that come your way amen
[41:29] matthew 7 so read some scriptures today
[41:31] matthew 7 this is 15-29
[41:33] this is jesus words it's in red
[41:36] beware of false prophets
[41:40] they are wrong they're always talking
[41:42] walking they coming
[41:44] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[41:47] but inwardly
[41:49] they are evening wolves you
[41:52] shall know them by their fruits
[41:57] do men gather grips of thorns or figs of
[42:00] tissues
[42:01] even so every good tree bringing forth
[42:05] good fruit but the corrupt tree bringeth
[42:08] forth
[42:08] evil fruit a good tree cannot bring
[42:11] forth evil fruit
[42:12] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[42:14] good fruit every tree
[42:16] that bringeth not good fruit is hewn dog
[42:18] cast into the fire
[42:20] whereby by their fruits you shall know
[42:22] them
[42:23] not everyone that's under me lord lord
[42:25] shall enter the kingdom
[42:28] not the lord lord talk thing not that
[42:31] but watch but he that do it the will of
[42:33] my father
[42:35] which is in heaven so he is qualifying
[42:37] who going to enter
[42:39] he is qualifying how you get there not
[42:41] everybody hallelujah glory glory no no
[42:43] no he's talking
[42:44] about doing the will of the father all
[42:46] right
[42:47] many will say to me in that day lord
[42:49] lord have me not prophesied in thy name
[42:52] in thy name have cast out devils in thy
[42:54] name done many
[42:55] wonderful works then i will profess unto
[42:57] them i never knew you
[42:58] the part for me is at work iniquity
[43:03] so then the fine print is getting deeper
[43:05] and deeper as to what god requires of us
[43:08] and this is what you are here for to
[43:10] find out god's requirement
[43:12] for your life isn't that right
[43:15] and therefore jesus said
[43:18] whosoever heareth these things of mine
[43:21] and do with them
[43:22] i would liken him unto a wise man
[43:26] which built his house upon a rock so
[43:29] this is jesus now
[43:30] sinking in the teaching at mysteries
[43:34] because mysteries was hit as parables he
[43:36] is sinking in now
[43:37] not to talk not to say lord lord but did
[43:40] i do the will of my father
[43:42] did i come into obedience to my word and
[43:44] to my will i will tell you what kind of
[43:46] man that is
[43:47] i'm going to tell you that kind of woman
[43:48] that is and yes he could begin to give
[43:50] his parable
[43:53] would have heard these scenes of mine
[43:54] hear it like everybody in the message
[43:56] hearing
[43:56] and do it amen
[43:59] i would liken them a wise man which
[44:01] built his house upon a rock and
[44:03] the rain descended and the floods came
[44:06] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[44:08] house it fell
[44:10] not before it was founded upon a rock
[44:13] and everyone that heard these things of
[44:14] mines
[44:15] do with them not shall be likened unto a
[44:16] foolish man which built his house upon
[44:18] the sun
[44:19] the rain descended the floods came the
[44:21] winds blew beat upon that house and it
[44:23] fell
[44:24] and great was the fall of it and when it
[44:26] came to pass
[44:27] when jesus ended these scenes the people
[44:29] were astonished
[44:30] at his doctrine and he taught them as
[44:33] one having authority
[44:34] and not as described i want to bring
[44:37] your attention to a particular thing
[44:38] here
[44:39] not the house built but the rain that's
[44:42] coming
[44:46] notice he didn't see the house built
[44:48] everybody was looking nice
[44:50] but that's nothing only the rain will
[44:53] prove
[44:53] what's it built on
[44:57] but ramp is a measure called the
[44:58] uncommon storm only the storm will
[45:00] vindicate
[45:02] what the house is built on only the
[45:05] trials
[45:06] only the judgment of fire would prove
[45:09] what works somebody had built on
[45:11] and it's coming it's coming to you
[45:15] to your home to your family to your job
[45:18] it's coming the churches is coming the

[46:02] on fire
[46:04] so before christ even make his
[46:06] appearance

[46:19] hallelujah
[46:21] whose fan is in his hand and he shall
[46:24] thoroughly push the floor
[46:25] and gather his wheat into the ghana but
[46:28] but you burn up the chaff with
[46:30] unquenchable fire
[46:32] then commit jesus unto galilee unto john
[46:35] to be baptized of him
[46:36] john forbid him saying i have need to be
[46:39] baptized of thee
[46:40] come as thou to me and jesus answered
[46:42] and said unto him suffer to be so now
[46:44] for us it'd be committed us to fulfill
[46:46] all righteousness and he suffered him
[46:48] and jesus
[46:48] when he was baptized so we're getting
[46:51] the continuation now john come to
[46:52] introduce his messiah
[46:53] here come the messiah he's following the
[46:55] scriptures he's not saying
[46:56] because i am this i do have to do that
[46:58] no he is humbling himself
[47:00] he's going the flow of the word he is
[47:02] obeying what god said
[47:03] he's fulfilling righteousness it looks
[47:05] like a small thing but he's going to get
[47:07] baptized
[47:08] and watch what happened here now and
[47:09] watch and straightway out of the water
[47:11] and lord of heavens to open up
[47:13] and he saw the spirit of god descending
[47:16] like a dove
[47:17] lighting upon him and a voice of heaven
[47:20] saying
[47:21] this is my beloved son in whom i am
[47:24] well pleased oh hallelujah then was
[47:27] jesus
[47:27] led up of the spirit into the wilderness
[47:30] to be tempted of the devil
[47:32] oh praise the name of the lord
[47:34] hallelujah
[47:36] and that jesus came with his earthly
[47:37] ministry
[47:39] pick up some men which he called
[47:41] disciples
[47:42] say be followers of me and i will make
[47:45] you fishers of men
[47:46] and he begin to take these natural men
[47:49] carnal men
[47:50] ordinary men men with jobs and
[47:53] everything else i begin to share
[47:54] the words of the kingdom with them and
[47:57] tell them they're going to be servants
[47:58] in this kingdom
[48:00] and they're going to be sanctified by
[48:01] thy truth and thy word is truth
[48:03] he sanctified them and then he began to
[48:06] begin to expound to them and demonstrate
[48:08] to them
[48:09] the the the powers of the kingdom
[48:11] demonstrated them the authority of the
[48:13] kingdom
[48:14] demonstrate to them the kind of things
[48:15] we will do in this kingdom
[48:17] by healing the sick and raising the dead
[48:19] and cast not devils
[48:21] and telling these same men the same
[48:22] words i do
[48:24] you're gonna do also because you're
[48:26] going to get a revelation of what
[48:28] kingdom you come from
[48:30] and my kingdom is not of this world and
[48:32] your kingdom is not of this world
[48:34] so don't let the world tie you up don't
[48:36] be unequally you
[48:37] don't tap yourself with unbelieving
[48:39] unbelieving people outside of there
[48:42] free yourself from that because you come
[48:44] from a higher order
[48:45] you come from a higher life you come
[48:47] from a higher kingdom altogether
[48:50] could we get a shout in the house
[48:52] [Applause]
[48:56] hallelujah
[49:00] and jesus let them straight up to his
[49:03] exact commission
[49:04] to them he said behold i send the
[49:07] promise of my father upon you
[49:10] hallelujah you shall receive power
[49:14] after the holy ghost come upon you and
[49:16] you shall be witnesses unto me
[49:19] flown in jerusalem unto the utmost part
[49:21] of the earth
[49:22] so jesus came and dropped their
[49:24] commission upon them
[49:25] to go into all the world and preach the
[49:27] gospel and the gospel wasn't involved
[49:30] only
[49:31] it was in power and demonstration so
[49:33] jesus
[49:34] had to empower these men with his spirit
[49:38] which was the promise from the father
[49:41] and they went in the upper room
[49:43] and they created an atmosphere in the
[49:44] upper room and they went one man and one
[49:46] accord
[49:47] and they were waiting they were
[49:49] believing
[49:50] they were repenting they were groaning
[49:54] they were travailing they were hiding
[49:57] they were fearful of the people on the
[49:58] outside but they had a promise from the
[50:01] father
[50:02] that the holy one was going to come and
[50:04] when the day of pentecost
[50:06] was fully come it was the right day it

[50:47] of my father upon you and peter said
[50:50] that under the pentacles

[51:16] that is the promise here we go are you

[54:18] after you offered by zach i know you
[54:20] fear me
[54:21] and blessing i will bless thee and
[54:23] multiply multiply the
[54:25] anti seed not maybe
[54:28] not perhaps not god scratching his head
[54:30] wondering
[54:31] what the season last days will do god
[54:34] already know what we will do
[54:35] he told it to abraham seed
[54:38] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[54:42] there is no gate that could stop any
[54:44] seed of abraham
[54:45] yes that's the ability that's what god
[54:48] prophesied

[54:58] oh glory to god you're gonna take back
[55:01] from that devil
[55:02] whatever he took from you you're gonna
[55:04] take it back that's the authority that's
[55:07] back in the church
[55:08] could i hear a shout in the house
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:27] this this holy ghost fire
[55:31] that started on the day of pentecost
[55:33] what's the original fire
[55:36] [Music]
[55:39] every age had to get light off of that
[55:41] fire
[55:42] so the light that cannot suck you take
[55:44] the fat from ephesus and light it tell
[55:46] it i keep light and smoother
[55:47] i'm sad is that the light because that
[55:49] that church had the original light
[55:52] that is why william branham came to turn
[55:54] our hearts
[55:55] back
[55:55] [Applause]
[55:59] come on give me a shout in the house
[56:06] [Applause]
[56:10] so before you can go forward you have to
[56:12] go back and pick up what they had back
[56:15] [Applause]
[56:28] it's not a slip already these are the
[56:30] back side already
[56:31] because big shots coming to the church
[56:33] and they find this fault
[56:34] and that fault and they find they're
[56:36] supposed to be so and they're supposed
[56:38] to be so
[56:38] and then put this one in a special seat
[56:40] and what kind of stuff
[56:42] and then begin to dry up and use the
[56:44] earnestly contend
[56:46] for the fate that was once delivered to
[56:49] the saints
[56:50] god came and delivered it to the saints
[56:53] you supposed to walk home without faith
[56:55] lay hands on the sick in your house and
[56:57] i'm safe
[56:58] god's don't perish without faith pray
[57:00] without faith
[57:02] overcome with that faith the just shall
[57:04] live by faith
[57:12] you will be seasoned and in this last
[57:15] days it takes seven thunders
[57:16] to bring back that fate all seven seas
[57:19] have to be open
[57:21] and seven thunders one two three four
[57:22] five six seven and god bring them
[57:24] thunders
[57:25] to cut our bride out to keep that by
[57:28] faith
[57:29] oh glory to god we are back to the faith
[57:33] the faith has already been identified
[57:36] manifested in william mariam branham to
[57:39] be manifested in a body called a bride
[57:45] so then go out to joel other prophecies
[57:47] province to restore
[57:49] or what a conqueror woman the palmer
[57:51] woman the caterpillar lucas eat down
[57:53] comes to restore it
[57:55] by a four-fold message a four-fold
[57:58] revelation four full move of god
[58:00] so to speak there come loot with
[58:02] justification
[58:03] they can reside sanification god had to
[58:06] build this thing back up
[58:08] because god had to keep his own law his
[58:10] own word so you bring justification with
[58:12] luther
[58:13] someday and here come the pentecostals
[58:15] now to introduce the spirit age
[58:18] let me give a testimony from that age
[58:20] 1906
[58:22] to 1909. frank battleman account as an
[58:26] eyewitness of what happened
[58:28] 1906 to 1909.
[58:31] the fire falls at azusa that's on the
[58:34] book nazuzu street chapter 2
[58:36] fire fall in azusa just remember they
[58:39] know come out of the matter this age
[58:41] no fire the power was so much they were
[58:44] so sanctified
[58:46] ah god lord have mercy they left such
[58:49] clean lines you hearing that you
[58:52] listening certainly here
[58:53] you hear what i'm saying they live such
[58:56] clean lives
[58:57] that the holy ghost used to come upon
[58:58] them ready to fill them
[59:00] but they used to have a bucket of water
[59:03] when the power hit them so they throw
[59:04] water
[59:05] and they revive before they get the holy
[59:07] ghost
[59:10] so you qualify service in different days
[59:12] by having buckets of water
[59:14] when you see a dunk themselves that's
[59:16] what's real good
[59:19] think about it you're preaching on your
[59:21] buckets of water line up
[59:22] waiting for the power to fall and the
[59:24] power hit them so you throw water and
[59:26] revive them up
[59:27] because it is not yet for the holy ghost
[59:29] 1906.
[59:30] god said behold i set before me an open
[59:32] door no man messenger
[59:35] in that door god himself opened that
[59:38] door
[59:39] no pastor prophet evangelist
[59:43] no man just god bless that door open
[59:47] hallelujah behold i said before they
[59:50] an open door it was an open door age
[59:52] holy ghost moving

[59:56] were all on one level
[59:58] my god in barnyard no air condition

[1:00:04] complain about who i'm smelling
[1:00:06] all the one of us holy ghost no makeup
[1:00:09] praise god hallelujah no no musical
[1:00:12] instrument
[1:00:13] they were singing in the spirit or they
[1:00:15] were singing the songs of god
[1:00:17] singing the blood songs old-time
[1:00:19] religion
[1:00:20] hallelujahs fire falls on azusa street
[1:00:24] i wonder where the fire gonna fall next
[1:00:26] because there's a bride
[1:00:28] that is waiting for fire oh don't let me
[1:00:31] get outside of the priest right now
[1:00:32] there's a braggart we fired up tax yes
[1:00:35] goggles and a fire bomb

[1:04:46] pray for deliverance for holy bunch
[1:04:48] womans
[1:04:51] are those not serious
[1:04:56] there was a general spirit of humility
[1:04:59] manifested in the meeting
[1:05:01] they were taken up with god amen
[1:05:04] amen evidently the lord had found a
[1:05:07] little company at last
[1:05:09] outside as always through whom he could
[1:05:12] have his way
[1:05:13] god had not chosen an established
[1:05:16] mission where this could be done
[1:05:18] there they were in the hands of men the
[1:05:21] spirit could not work
[1:05:23] others far more pretentious had failed
[1:05:26] that which man esteems had been passed
[1:05:28] by once more
[1:05:29] and the spirit was born again in a
[1:05:32] humble stable outside the ecclesial
[1:05:34] establishment amen
[1:05:36] our body must be prepared in repentance
[1:05:38] and humility
[1:05:39] for every opponent of the spirit
[1:05:42] there is no outpouring of the spirit
[1:05:44] without preparation amen
[1:05:46] hallelujah god's in a message of
[1:05:47] preparation john was sent to prepare
[1:05:50] for the coming of the lord who shall
[1:05:52] stand when he comes
[1:05:55] and he come in like a refiners fire what
[1:05:57] are we going to get on into it
[1:05:59] oh hell but he's coming away with me for
[1:06:02] him to come and he's coming he's right
[1:06:04] on his way isn't that right
[1:06:06] glory the present world by pentecostal
[1:06:09] manifestation
[1:06:11] did not break out in a moment like a
[1:06:13] huge prairie fire
[1:06:15] and set the wall on fire in fact no work
[1:06:18] of god ever appears that way
[1:06:20] there is a necessary time for
[1:06:21] preparation the finished article is not
[1:06:24] realized at the beginning
[1:06:25] men may wonder where it come from not
[1:06:28] being conscious of the preparation
[1:06:30] but there is always such every movement
[1:06:33] of the spirit of god must also run the
[1:06:37] gauntlets of the devil's forces
[1:06:39] the dragon stands before bearing up the
[1:06:41] bearing mother ready to swell up her
[1:06:43] child
[1:06:44] so it was with the present pentecostal
[1:06:46] work in the beginning
[1:06:48] the enemy did much counterfeiting god
[1:06:51] kept the young child well hit for a
[1:06:53] season
[1:06:54] from the herod's until it could gain
[1:06:56] strength and deserving to resist them
[1:06:59] the flame was guarded jealously by the
[1:07:02] hand of the lord
[1:07:03] from the winds of criticism jealousy
[1:07:06] unbelief and so on
[1:07:07] it went through about the same
[1:07:09] experiences that all revivers have
[1:07:12] it phones were both inside and out
[1:07:16] both luther and wesley experience the
[1:07:18] same difficulties in this time
[1:07:21] we have this stretch and eaten vessels
[1:07:23] every
[1:07:24] natural birth is surrounded by
[1:07:27] circumstances
[1:07:28] not entirely pleasant god's perfect work
[1:07:33] is brought about in oh oh
[1:07:36] i'll just skip that every natural bird
[1:07:39] is surrounded by circumstances not
[1:07:40] entirely pleasant
[1:07:42] john wesley himself once prayed after
[1:07:44] revival had about died out for the time
[1:07:46] oh lord
[1:07:47] send us the old revival with all the
[1:07:49] defects
[1:07:52] and if this cannot be send it with all
[1:07:55] of his defects
[1:07:57] we must have a revival
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:00] oh god what a man of god what a man of
[1:08:03] god
[1:08:04] 735 without the defects
[1:08:07] but lord if this cannot be sent by the
[1:08:09] defects
[1:08:10] we must have a revival hallelujah praise
[1:08:14] god
[1:08:15] adam clark said no nature along with
[1:08:18] satan
[1:08:19] will always mingle themselves as far as
[1:08:21] they can
[1:08:23] in the genuine work of the spirit in
[1:08:25] order to discredit and destroy it
[1:08:27] in great revival of religion it is
[1:08:30] almost impossible
[1:08:31] to prevent wildfire from getting among
[1:08:33] the true fire
[1:08:35] oh holland people would say
[1:08:42] so then they move from bunny bay street
[1:08:44] to 312 azusa street
[1:08:47] so the spray began to move in bonny
[1:08:49] berry street they switched to 312.
[1:08:52] tristan number 312
[1:08:56] azusa street here that rented an old
[1:08:58] frame building
[1:08:59] formerly a methodist church in the
[1:09:00] center of the city
[1:09:02] but now a long time out of you from
[1:09:04] eaton
[1:09:05] a receptable of all lumber plaster other
[1:09:07] materials
[1:09:08] they are cleared space enough in the
[1:09:11] surrounding dirt and debris to lay some
[1:09:13] plants on top of
[1:09:14] empty nail kegs which seats enough for
[1:09:17] possibly
[1:09:18] 30 people if i remember rightly
[1:09:22] they were arranged in a square facing
[1:09:25] one another
[1:09:26] so it was a square entire amount was 20
[1:09:30] people just hold it
[1:09:31] i was under tremendous pressure to get
[1:09:33] to the meeting that evening
[1:09:35] it was my first visit to azusa mission
[1:09:38] mother wheaton was living with us was
[1:09:39] going with me
[1:09:40] she was so slow that i could hardly wait
[1:09:43] for her
[1:09:45] we finally reached azusa and found about
[1:09:48] a dozen saints dear some white
[1:09:50] some black but a sema was dear in charge
[1:09:53] the ark of god moved slowly
[1:09:55] but surely at azusa it was kind in the
[1:09:58] show of his own appointed priests in the
[1:09:59] beginning
[1:10:00] we had no new cat in those days to
[1:10:02] please the colonel mixed multitude
[1:10:04] we had the devil to fight but the ark
[1:10:06] was not drawn by
[1:10:07] oxen zombies the priests were alive unto
[1:10:10] god
[1:10:11] too much preparation and prayer
[1:10:15] discernment was not perfect and the
[1:10:17] enemy got some advantage
[1:10:19] that brought reproach to the work but
[1:10:22] the saints
[1:10:23] soon learned to take forth the pressures
[1:10:26] from the vial
[1:10:27] the combined forces of hell were set
[1:10:29] determinedly against us
[1:10:31] in the beginning it was not all blessing
[1:10:33] in fact the fight was terrific
[1:10:36] as always the devil calmed the country
[1:10:39] for crooked spirits to destroy the work
[1:10:42] if possible
[1:10:43] they will look for them and send them to
[1:10:45] the church send them to the revival
[1:10:47] say you have to go there
[1:10:51] but the fire could not be smothered
[1:10:54] gradually the tide arose in victory from
[1:10:57] a small beginning
[1:10:59] a very little flame was kindled
[1:11:02] i gave a message at my first meeting in
[1:11:04] azusa two of the same spoken tongues
[1:11:06] such
[1:11:06] much blessings seemed to attend the
[1:11:08] utterance it was so noisy abroad that
[1:11:10] god is working at azusa and all kinds of
[1:11:12] people begin to come to the meetings
[1:11:13] many were curious
[1:11:15] and unbelieving others were hungry for
[1:11:17] god the newspapers began to ridicule
[1:11:20] and abuse the meetings that's given us
[1:11:21] free advertising
[1:11:24] this brought the crowd the devil overdid
[1:11:28] himself again
[1:11:29] oh my my my my
[1:11:32] my my my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:36] oh glory to god can any good thing come
[1:11:39] out of nazareth
[1:11:40] oh glory to god hallelujah can any good
[1:11:43] thing come about this seven thunder
[1:11:45] bride
[1:11:45] that what kind insider there yes a real
[1:11:49] revival
[1:11:50] seven thunder revival holy ghost revival
[1:11:55] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:11:58] the devil over there themselves outside
[1:12:00] persecution never heard the work
[1:12:02] we had the most fear from the working of
[1:12:05] evil spirits with him
[1:12:07] spiritualists hypnotists came to
[1:12:10] investigate
[1:12:11] and to try the influence then all the
[1:12:13] religious saw is
[1:12:15] crooks cranks came seeking a place in
[1:12:19] the works
[1:12:23] remember in paul time he said give me
[1:12:25] that power that paul had
[1:12:27] that we could do that too come on devil
[1:12:30] in the name of jesus paul preacher
[1:12:34] so this is not a new thing them looking
[1:12:36] for power without character looking for
[1:12:38] power they're not
[1:12:39] authorized to have so watch
[1:12:42] we had the most to fear from these but
[1:12:45] this is always the danger to every new
[1:12:46] work
[1:12:47] they had no place elsewhere this
[1:12:50] condition casts a fear over many that
[1:12:52] was hard to overcome
[1:12:53] it hindered the spirit much many were
[1:12:55] afraid to seek god for fear the devil
[1:12:56] might get them
[1:12:58] then came the earthquake san francisco
[1:13:01] earthquake
[1:13:02] the earthquake was surely the voice of
[1:13:04] god to the people on the pacific coast
[1:13:05] so god had everything lined up you know
[1:13:07] the anointing the people the earthquake
[1:13:10] that just take it the next level
[1:13:11] together
[1:13:14] it was used mightily in conviction for
[1:13:16] the revival the lord graciously
[1:13:17] brought afterwards in the earlier days
[1:13:19] both heaven and hell
[1:13:20] seem to have come to tongue
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:25] this is this is serious men were at the
[1:13:28] breaking point
[1:13:30] conviction was mightily on the people
[1:13:34] they would fly to pieces even on the
[1:13:36] street without provocation
[1:13:39] our very bloodline seemed to have been
[1:13:41] drawn around as those are missioned by
[1:13:42] the spirit
[1:13:43] where men came within two blocks of the
[1:13:45] space they were seized
[1:13:48] with conviction amen the work was
[1:13:51] getting
[1:13:58] listening
[1:14:01] the work was getting clearer and
[1:14:02] stronger at azusa god is working
[1:14:04] mightily
[1:14:05] it seems that everyone had to go to
[1:14:07] azusa missionaries were gathered from
[1:14:09] africa india
[1:14:10] the islands of the sea preachers and
[1:14:12] workers across the continent and come
[1:14:14] from distant land
[1:14:15] with an irresistible drawing to los
[1:14:17] angeles gather my saints together
[1:14:19] they are coming for pentecost though
[1:14:21] they literally realize it
[1:14:22] it was god's call holiness meetings
[1:14:25] tents
[1:14:26] missions begin to close up for lack of
[1:14:28] attendance their people were at azusa
[1:14:31] brother and sister god closed the
[1:14:32] burning bush wall came to azusa
[1:14:34] received the baptism of the spirit and
[1:14:36] was soon on their way to india to spread
[1:14:38] the fire
[1:14:40] even but there was much there was there
[1:14:42] was much persecution
[1:14:43] especially from the press they wrote us
[1:14:46] up shamefully
[1:14:47] but this only drew the crowds gave the
[1:14:49] work six months to live
[1:14:50] soon the meeting was running day and
[1:14:52] night the place was packed out nightly
[1:14:54] the whole building upstairs and dung had
[1:14:56] now been cleared and put into use
[1:14:58] there were far more white people than
[1:15:00] black people coming the color line was
[1:15:02] washed away in the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:06] he said uh a s warrior a translator of
[1:15:09] the new testament declared his rules of
[1:15:10] work
[1:15:11] had rediscovered the blood of christ to
[1:15:12] the church at the time great emphasis
[1:15:15] was placed on christ's blood
[1:15:16] for cleansing and more a high standard
[1:15:19] was held up
[1:15:19] for a clean life oh my and that has a
[1:15:23] return
[1:15:24] a high standard for a clean life a
[1:15:26] consecrated life
[1:15:28] a holy life a dedicated life isn't that
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:31] divine love was wonderfully manifest in
[1:15:34] the meetings
[1:15:35] the people will not even allow an unkind
[1:15:37] word
[1:15:38] said against the opposers of the
[1:15:39] churches or the churches
[1:15:41] the message was the love of god it was a
[1:15:43] sort of fullest love
[1:15:44] of the early church return the baptism
[1:15:47] of the holy spirit as we received
[1:15:48] in the beginning did not allow us to
[1:15:50] think speak
[1:15:52] or hear evil of any man the spirit is
[1:15:55] very sensitive
[1:15:56] tender as a dove the holy spirit is
[1:15:58] symbolizes a dove
[1:16:00] we knew the moment we had grieved the
[1:16:01] spirit by an unkind thought or word
[1:16:04] we seem to live in a sea of pure divine
[1:16:06] love the lord
[1:16:08] fought our battles for us in those days
[1:16:11] we were committed to his judgment
[1:16:13] fully in all matters and never seeking
[1:16:15] even to defend the work of ourselves
[1:16:17] we live in this wonderful immediate
[1:16:19] presence
[1:16:21] are you getting the picture of what we
[1:16:22] had back there
[1:16:24] we live in this wonderful immediate
[1:16:25] presence and nothing contrary to his
[1:16:27] pure spirit was allowed there
[1:16:29] the false was sifted out from the real
[1:16:32] by the spirit of god the word of god
[1:16:35] itself decidedly absolutely
[1:16:37] look i like this the word of god itself
[1:16:41] decided absolutely all issues
[1:16:45] and we have to come right back to that
[1:16:47] well all issues is settled by the word
[1:16:49] of god
[1:16:50] no matter how you feel i know you think
[1:16:52] and what is brother saying another one's
[1:16:54] saying and
[1:16:55] no no by the way what did the word say
[1:16:57] hallelujah
[1:16:59] the heart of the people in act and
[1:17:02] motive
[1:17:03] was searched to the very bottom love
[1:17:05] that
[1:17:06] let me read it again the hearts of the
[1:17:09] people
[1:17:10] watch both in act
[1:17:13] and motive was searched to the very
[1:17:16] bottom
[1:17:17] it was no joke to become one of that
[1:17:19] company
[1:17:20] no man this joined unto them it was no
[1:17:23] joke
[1:17:24] unless they meant business it mean a
[1:17:27] dine out
[1:17:28] and clean up process in those days to
[1:17:31] receive the baptism
[1:17:33] it was a little more than going to
[1:17:34] church no it was a little more than that
[1:17:36] that occupied a pew it was a little more
[1:17:38] than that
[1:17:39] it was people coming for the baptism of
[1:17:40] the holy ghost people coming to be
[1:17:42] sealed
[1:17:43] people are coming for the mark of god oh
[1:17:46] can we give the lord a shout in the
[1:17:47] house
[1:17:47] [Applause]
[1:17:51] we had a tyrion room upstairs for those
[1:17:54] especially seeking god for the holy
[1:17:56] spirit baptism
[1:17:57] though many got it in the main assembly
[1:17:58] room also in fact
[1:18:00] they often got it in their seats in
[1:18:02] those days the spirit worked very deeply
[1:18:04] in the tearing room
[1:18:06] an unquiet spirit or thoughtless talker
[1:18:09] was immediately reproved by the spirit
[1:18:13] that means the spirit are arresting
[1:18:15] people yeah cause i'm talking talking
[1:18:17] talking no there's a different
[1:18:18] atmosphere together
[1:18:19] you have to reference and respect the
[1:18:21] operation of the spirit of god isn't
[1:18:22] that right
[1:18:23] we were on holy grounds the atmosphere
[1:18:26] was unbearable
[1:18:27] to those with a common spirit they can't
[1:18:30] wait to leave
[1:18:32] they generally give this room a white
[1:18:34] bird unless they have been totally
[1:18:35] subdued and burnt out
[1:18:37] that means they get out they cannot they
[1:18:39] can handle it
[1:18:42] only honest seekers sought it those who
[1:18:45] really mean business with god
[1:18:47] it was no place to throw fits or blow
[1:18:49] off steam
[1:18:51] men did not fly to their lungs in those
[1:18:53] days
[1:18:55] they flew to the mercy seat they took
[1:18:58] their shoes off figuratively speaking
[1:19:00] they were on holy ground oh my
[1:19:03] so that was the little caption that i
[1:19:05] have from azusa street
[1:19:07] kind of atmosphere you appreciate it
[1:19:14] god had this man as a witness to the
[1:19:17] atmosphere
[1:19:18] that he fights and the battles that they
[1:19:19] had itself this is brother branham you
[1:19:22] take a chicken egg
[1:19:23] and put it in an incubator which should
[1:19:25] be under hand it will hatch anyhow
[1:19:27] put it under pop it will hatch it's the
[1:19:30] warmness
[1:19:30] it's the condition that makes it hatch
[1:19:33] you could take a good live egg put it on
[1:19:34] that dead end it won't hatch it's the
[1:19:36] condition
[1:19:37] and that's the weight in this age we're
[1:19:39] living in you've
[1:19:40] got to find what is god's way of doing
[1:19:43] it for this age
[1:19:44] that's what martin luther found that's
[1:19:46] what john wesley found
[1:19:48] that's what the pentecostal found in
[1:19:49] their age now watch the pentecostal
[1:19:52] there was a brother one of his eyes was
[1:19:54] out a colored brother he's seymour
[1:19:56] who was like the lead person in that
[1:19:57] revival okay so
[1:19:59] one eye out she's like a one eye
[1:20:02] mandarin
[1:20:04] if people choose anyone choose the one i
[1:20:05] man
[1:20:07] but god choose that man all right
[1:20:10] he was laughed at because he was a negro
[1:20:13] he was made fun of but he brought a
[1:20:15] message for that age just a little boy
[1:20:17] but a buddy
[1:20:18] a little buddy fellow could have said
[1:20:20] his own name but the lord had revealed
[1:20:22] to him
[1:20:23] that this was the age for the
[1:20:25] restoration of those gifts
[1:20:29] that was his revelation in the season
[1:20:31] and time for the gifts of tongues and
[1:20:33] interpretation of tongues

[1:22:07] manifestation of god that is promised
[1:22:10] and god promised a manifestation of god
[1:22:12] to the bride he said a bride has not a
[1:22:14] revival yet

[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:23:03] buddha burnham
[1:23:13] was recognized as the nominal leader in
[1:23:16] charge
[1:23:16] we had no pope there's a man continuing
[1:23:18] now we have a next part of it
[1:23:20] i'm reading here now we had no purple
[1:23:22] hierarchy we were brethren
[1:23:24] we had no human program the lord himself
[1:23:26] was leading we had no priest class
[1:23:29] no priest craft these things come in
[1:23:31] later
[1:23:32] with the apostasizing of the movement we
[1:23:34] didn't even have a platform or pulpit in
[1:23:35] the beginning
[1:23:36] we were all on the same level the
[1:23:39] ministers were servants
[1:23:40] so they didn't even have an elevated
[1:23:42] platform or pulpit everybody on the same
[1:23:44] level
[1:23:45] that's how it was zazusa
[1:23:50] old time shouting oh glory hallelujah
[1:23:53] the ministers were servants according to
[1:23:56] the true meaning of the word
[1:23:57] we did not honor men for their advantage
[1:24:00] it means
[1:24:01] or in means or education but rather on
[1:24:04] their god-given gifts
[1:24:06] he said the members in the body now a
[1:24:08] wonderful and horrible thing
[1:24:09] is is to come to pass in the land no
[1:24:12] okay i'm just keeping something this is
[1:24:14] a scripture a wonderful and horrible
[1:24:16] thing has come to pass in the land the
[1:24:17] prophets prophesy falsely
[1:24:18] and the priests bear rule by their means
[1:24:21] and my people love to have it so
[1:24:23] and what will be the end thereof that is
[1:24:24] jeremiah
[1:24:27] so my people children are their
[1:24:28] oppressors and women rule over them
[1:24:31] isaiah 3 12.
[1:24:32] but the seymour generally sat behind two
[1:24:34] empty shoe boxes
[1:24:36] one on top the other he usually kept his
[1:24:39] head inside
[1:24:40] the top of one unipre meeting
[1:24:43] in prayer there was no pride there the
[1:24:45] services ran almost continually
[1:24:48] seeking souls could be found under the
[1:24:50] power almost any hour night and day
[1:24:52] the place was never closed nor empty the
[1:24:55] people came to meet god
[1:24:57] he was always there hence a continuous
[1:24:59] meeting
[1:25:00] the meeting did not depend upon a human
[1:25:01] leader god's presence became more and
[1:25:04] more wonderful
[1:25:05] in that old building with his low
[1:25:07] rafters and beer floors god took
[1:25:08] strong men and women to pieces and put
[1:25:11] them together again for his glory
[1:25:16] low rafter mud floor
[1:25:19] strong men and woman broken before the
[1:25:21] power of god
[1:25:23] oh what will happen when that pillar his
[1:25:25] sent once more
[1:25:26] like he descended on monk sinai it was a
[1:25:29] tremendous overhauling process
[1:25:31] pride self-assertion self-importance
[1:25:35] self-exceed esteemed could not survive
[1:25:38] there
[1:25:38] the religious ego preaches his own
[1:25:40] funeral sermon quickly
[1:25:42] no subjects or sermons were announced
[1:25:45] ahead of time
[1:25:46] no special speakers for such an hour no
[1:25:49] one knew what might be coming
[1:25:50] what god will do all was spontaneous
[1:25:53] ordered of the spirit
[1:25:54] we wanted to hear from god to whoever he
[1:25:56] might speak
[1:25:57] we had no respect of persons the rich
[1:26:00] and educated with the dame as the poor
[1:26:02] and ignorant
[1:26:03] and found much harder today
[1:26:08] you're rich finding the heart of there
[1:26:11] today
[1:26:14] we only recognize god all were equal no
[1:26:17] flesh my glory in his presence
[1:26:18] he could only use the self only he could
[1:26:21] not use the self only recognized
[1:26:23] opinionated
[1:26:24] those were holy ghost meetings led of
[1:26:26] the lord it had to start in the poor
[1:26:28] surroundings
[1:26:29] god all were equal no flesh my glory in
[1:26:32] his presence
[1:26:33] he could not use the self to keep all
[1:26:36] this selfish human element
[1:26:37] all came down in humility together at
[1:26:39] his feet they all look alike that's what
[1:26:41] baram talked about
[1:26:42] all look alike isn't that right had all
[1:26:45] things in common
[1:26:46] all came down in humility together at
[1:26:48] his feet they all look alike
[1:26:50] the rafters were low the tall must come
[1:26:52] down by the time they got to jesus they
[1:26:54] were humbled
[1:26:55] ready for the blessing the food was
[1:26:57] displaced for the lambs not giraffes
[1:26:59] all could reach it oh praise god
[1:27:02] we were delivered right there listen we
[1:27:05] were delivered right there
[1:27:06] from ecclesiastical heritage like
[1:27:09] hierarchism
[1:27:10] nice pope and bishop and this sort of
[1:27:12] thing and abuse
[1:27:13] we wanted god when we first reached the
[1:27:15] meeting we avoided as much as possible
[1:27:18] human contact and greeting
[1:27:22] remember yesterday you see what happened
[1:27:24] in politics
[1:27:26] we're here don't make nadia please amen
[1:27:30] you're coming for god you're coming to
[1:27:32] me the pillar of fire
[1:27:34] it has to change from coming i'm going
[1:27:36] to church i'm going to see yesterday no
[1:27:37] you're coming to meet god
[1:27:39] they come and wait and god speak to me
[1:27:41] there's got to be a word in this service
[1:27:43] here
[1:27:44] that i know is god speaking to me you
[1:27:47] know my needs
[1:27:48] you know my condition you know what's in
[1:27:49] my home you know what's in my house
[1:27:51] i need a deliverance i need a
[1:27:53] breakthrough i need an answer i need to
[1:27:55] hear from you
[1:27:58] speak
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:05] we got our heads under some bench in the
[1:28:07] corner in prayer
[1:28:08] and met men only in the spirit knowing
[1:28:10] them after the flesh no more
[1:28:12] the meetings started themselves
[1:28:14] spontaneously in testimony and praise
[1:28:16] and worship
[1:28:17] the testimony were never hurried by a
[1:28:19] call for popcorn
[1:28:21] we had no pre-arranged program to be
[1:28:23] jammed through the time
[1:28:25] our time was the lord's we had real
[1:28:27] testimony some
[1:28:28] fresh heart experience otherwise the
[1:28:31] shorter testimonies the better
[1:28:33] a dozen might be on their feet at one
[1:28:34] time trembling under the mighty power of
[1:28:36] god
[1:28:37] we didn't have to get a cue from from
[1:28:40] our leader
[1:28:41] we were free from lawlessness we were
[1:28:43] shut up to god in prayer
[1:28:45] in the meetings of our mind on him all
[1:28:47] obed god in meekness and humility
[1:28:49] in honor we pray for one another the
[1:28:51] lord was liable to burst through anyone
[1:28:54] we prayed for this continually
[1:28:57] hallelujah some will finally get up
[1:28:59] anointed for the message
[1:29:01] all seem to recognize this and give way
[1:29:03] it might be a child
[1:29:04] a woman a man it might be from the back
[1:29:06] seat from the front it made no
[1:29:07] difference
[1:29:08] we rejoice that god was working no one
[1:29:10] wished to show himself
[1:29:12] we thought only about obeying god in
[1:29:16] fact
[1:29:16] there was an accuracy of god there that
[1:29:18] forbid anyone but a fool
[1:29:20] attempting to put himself forward
[1:29:22] without a real anointing
[1:29:25] i think that word reading again i think
[1:29:27] that word reading again
[1:29:29] hallelujah in fact there was an
[1:29:31] atmosphere of god there
[1:29:32] that forbid anyone but a fool attempting
[1:29:35] to put himself forward without a real
[1:29:36] anointed
[1:29:37] and such did not last long the spirit
[1:29:39] from the throne controlled the mittens
[1:29:42] those were truly wonderful days i often
[1:29:44] said i would rather live six months at
[1:29:46] that time
[1:29:46] than 50 years of ordinary life
[1:29:52] everybody alive everybody receiving
[1:29:56] this is our history we can't deny luther
[1:30:00] we can't deny wesley we can't deny
[1:30:02] pentecost no this is our history
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:09] but god is just the same today only we
[1:30:11] have changed
[1:30:13] someone might be speaking suddenly
[1:30:14] spirit fall upon the congregation god
[1:30:16] himself would give you all the call
[1:30:18] men would fall over the house like a
[1:30:20] slain in battle
[1:30:21] or rush for the altar in mass to seek
[1:30:23] god
[1:30:24] the scene also often resemble a forest
[1:30:27] of fallen trees
[1:30:29] such a scene cannot be imitated i never
[1:30:32] saw an altar called given in those early
[1:30:34] days
[1:30:34] god himself would call them hallelujah
[1:30:39] such a scene cannot be imitated god
[1:30:42] himself would call him
[1:30:43] and the preacher knew when to quit when
[1:30:46] he spoke we all obeyed
[1:30:47] it seemed a fearful thing to hinder or
[1:30:49] grieve the spirit
[1:30:50] the whole place was steeped in prayer
[1:30:53] like that
[1:30:54] amen steeped in prayer not a little dip
[1:30:57] you know
[1:30:57] you know when you have your ill tea bag
[1:31:00] you could depend and pull it out you
[1:31:01] know
[1:31:02] die no tea you know
[1:31:06] to get the tea you have to steep it and
[1:31:08] leave it inside of it here it takes time
[1:31:10] for it to steep
[1:31:11] it takes time to get along in prayer
[1:31:13] it's in a good morning longer even lord
[1:31:15] it takes some time
[1:31:16] we need to get some tyrion time oh
[1:31:18] hallelujah praise god
[1:31:20] as bahram says when you're about to get
[1:31:22] a breakthrough here come the mosquito
[1:31:23] bite to him
[1:31:24] there comes something stinging him
[1:31:26] something buzzing around his head
[1:31:27] when you're about to get a breakthrough
[1:31:29] i don't know when you're bought the
[1:31:30] vehicles you walk on a torch coming this
[1:31:32] coming that coming the phone ringing
[1:31:34] somebody knock on your door when you're
[1:31:35] about to get a breakthrough
[1:31:37] but you keep pressing on
[1:31:38] [Applause]
[1:31:43] the whole place was steeped in prayer
[1:31:45] god was in his holy temple
[1:31:47] it was for man to keep silent the
[1:31:49] shekinah glory rested there
[1:31:51] in fact some claim to have seen the
[1:31:53] glory by night over the building
[1:31:54] i do not doubt it i have stopped more
[1:31:56] than once within two blocks of the place
[1:31:58] and prayed for strength before i dared
[1:31:59] to go on the person of god was so real
[1:32:03] did you hear that two blocks from the
[1:32:05] place
[1:32:06] the presence of god is so real he asked
[1:32:08] for strength to go on
[1:32:10] oh how the are falling in the streets
[1:32:12] two blocks people getting healed
[1:32:14] on their way to the building people

[1:32:28] to god it will be greater than that
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:33] [Music]
[1:32:36] the presence of god was so real
[1:32:38] presumptuous men would sometimes come
[1:32:40] among us
[1:32:42] especially preachers who tried to spread
[1:32:44] themselves
[1:32:45] in self opinion but their effort was
[1:32:48] short-lived
[1:32:49] the bread would be taken from them their
[1:32:52] minds would wander
[1:32:53] their brains real things were turned
[1:32:55] black before their eyes
[1:32:57] they could not go on i never saw one of
[1:32:59] them get ready in those days

[1:37:14] confession were taken up of god
[1:37:16] transformed
[1:37:16] to the mighty baptism of the spirit the
[1:37:19] old man died
[1:37:20] with all his pride aragon said good
[1:37:21] works in my own case
[1:37:23] i came to abhor myself
[1:37:26] i begged the lord to drop the curtain so
[1:37:28] close behind me
[1:37:29] on my path that it would hit my heels

[1:37:34] though it had never occurred
[1:37:36] as soon as it was accomplished ending
[1:37:37] for him at least my good works would
[1:37:38] become a snare to me

[1:38:36] light of god
[1:38:37] the preachers died the hardest
[1:38:46] because they could coat and they could
[1:38:47] preach and some people businesses and
[1:38:48] but when they still have fire

[1:39:48] them

[1:39:57] oh glory hallelujah until the preachers
[1:40:00] died the hardest
[1:40:02] when god got you with them they gladly
[1:40:03] turned a new pageant capture
[1:40:06] that was one reason they fought so hard
[1:40:08] death is not at all a pleasant
[1:40:10] experience
[1:40:11] strong men die hard
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:17] strong men die hard what a time is
[1:40:20] coming oh this bright
[1:40:21] wind for a wonderful time it will be hot
[1:40:24] and heavy but we in for tremendous time
[1:40:26] in the lord oh praise god for the pranam
[1:40:31] from sisters the time he says now a
[1:40:33] mystery scripture
[1:40:35] a previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:40:39] revealed
[1:40:40] but a supernatural elements to remain
[1:40:42] despite
[1:40:43] the revelation a scripture a mystery of
[1:40:46] scripture
[1:40:47] isn't that right a previously hidden
[1:40:49] truth now
[1:40:50] divinely revealed it means revealed by
[1:40:54] the spirit
[1:40:55] somebody could be actually inside here
[1:40:56] 20 years and god revealed himself to
[1:40:58] them
[1:40:58] and you can't stop that that is flesh
[1:41:01] and blood heart not reveal it to you
[1:41:03] so i could preach but to take the spirit
[1:41:05] to reveal it to you
[1:41:06] that's why you have to come in the
[1:41:07] spirit because the spirit can then
[1:41:08] reveal it to you
[1:41:09] and that's the rock that you build this
[1:41:11] church on
[1:41:13] that's the rock the devil can't touch
[1:41:15] that's anchored in your soul the devil
[1:41:16] can't go there
[1:41:18] because it's a word to deserve the
[1:41:19] thoughts and intents of the heart so
[1:41:20] when god dropped that in your soul
[1:41:22] devil can't touch that he can't go
[1:41:24] behind there
[1:41:25] he have no reason to go behind you he is
[1:41:28] not the word
[1:41:29] so though your flesh may act up your
[1:41:31] flesh may feel there's a rock that god
[1:41:33] put inside of you
[1:41:34] a seed inside of you that is ready to
[1:41:37] anoint with fire
[1:41:39] baptism of fire that's he gonna come
[1:41:42] alive
[1:41:44] are you gonna manifest what's inside of
[1:41:45] you
[1:41:48] oh glory to god glory to god
[1:41:52] listen peter was jesus he wrote you know
[1:41:55] he was a son of god and he was a soldier
[1:41:57] you know
[1:41:58] the devil seemers are miserable this and
[1:42:00] miserable that and jesus said that i
[1:42:01] prayed for you that everyone was sitting
[1:42:03] like wheat
[1:42:04] but i prayed for you what for what for
[1:42:06] that your faith failed not
[1:42:08] because of your faith fail everything
[1:42:09] fall down your christian life is based
[1:42:11] upon faith
[1:42:12] my feet are coming this morning i know
[1:42:14] this is not an easy message but i got to
[1:42:15] preach it
[1:42:16] because that is what he gave me to
[1:42:18] preach and i don't question what i'm
[1:42:19] given
[1:42:20] i don't preach what i feel like that
[1:42:22] entice your ears these are things you
[1:42:23] need to know
[1:42:24] it's not easy to preach this kind of
[1:42:26] gospel but this is what you need to know
[1:42:27] because this will help you to grow to
[1:42:29] understand
[1:42:30] when we get to the spot listen when we
[1:42:32] finish the devil not even in the picture
[1:42:37] let me say it again when we are finished
[1:42:40] you would see the devil not even in the
[1:42:42] picture
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:47] it's just the potter on the clay
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:54] and if you're gonna rema if you're gonna
[1:42:56] submit yourself and surrender yourself
[1:42:58] yourself to his moulding all right
[1:43:01] but the prana he said no i know
[1:43:04] my uh he said okay now elijah will not
[1:43:07] be a system
[1:43:08] it will be a man he'll be a one man
[1:43:11] anointed of the holy ghost
[1:43:12] and he won't introduce any three or four
[1:43:14] gods he will introduce one the lord
[1:43:16] jesus christ
[1:43:17] because his message will shake the
[1:43:18] pentecostal children back to the fate of
[1:43:20] the fathers again
[1:43:21] so this is the message of malachi 4 to
[1:43:23] turn our hearts
[1:43:25] back to the faith of the fathers again
[1:43:28] according to malachi 4 is to bring them
[1:43:29] back to the faith
[1:43:30] which was once delivered to the saints
[1:43:32] bring them back to the faith of the
[1:43:34] fathers
[1:43:34] the pentecostal part in the restoration
[1:43:38] time let me take that slowly
[1:43:41] let's take that slowly to bring them
[1:43:43] back to the fate
[1:43:44] here we go the pentecostal part in the
[1:43:47] restoration time
[1:43:48] oh yeah people are books and tapes but
[1:43:50] where is the pentecostal part
[1:43:52] yes you're saying restore and restore
[1:43:54] where is the pentecostal part
[1:43:56] because that is what happened on the day
[1:43:57] of pentecost
[1:43:58] [Applause]
[1:44:00] and the holy ghost has to be made real
[1:44:02] to the people again
[1:44:06] that's why people are not seeking the
[1:44:08] holy ghost is no longer real but it's
[1:44:09] going to become real
[1:44:11] again oh there's a real holy ghost
[1:44:15] there's a real baptism there's a real
[1:44:18] power there's a real presence
[1:44:20] there's a real transformation
[1:44:21] [Applause]
[1:44:26] i think that would reason again bring
[1:44:28] them back the faith of the fathers
[1:44:30] the pentecostal part in the restoration
[1:44:34] time
[1:44:35] i will restore share the lord the real
[1:44:38] event
[1:44:39] end time evangelism oh praise god and
[1:44:42] jesus asked the question when the son of
[1:44:43] man cometh
[1:44:44] shall we find faith on the earth or will
[1:44:45] these guys cheat us the people out of
[1:44:47] the fate
[1:44:48] question when the son of man cometh not
[1:44:49] gonna reveal himself when he comes
[1:44:51] shall we find faith on the earth got to
[1:44:53] have faith on the earth i don't care
[1:44:55] what's
[1:44:55] wrong with you i don't care if hell
[1:44:56] itself inside your house shall we find
[1:44:58] feet on the earth
[1:45:00] or somebody gonna have that faith my god
[1:45:02] and the
[1:45:03] fine sells kingdom defy satan's kingdom
[1:45:06] that faith defies everything that fake
[1:45:08] common things are not as though they
[1:45:10] were
[1:45:10] abraham look at syria and say lying
[1:45:12] symptoms praise god woman you're gonna
[1:45:14] have that child praise god i don't know

[1:45:19] i didn't promise it god promised it
[1:45:21] isaac is coming ready or not he's coming
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:27] that's the kind of faith god started off
[1:45:29] with that fate and tested that fate
[1:45:31] it's the fate of god that's why they
[1:45:33] tested it that's why the faith has come
[1:45:34] true
[1:45:35] that was the ibrahim faith that was
[1:45:36] god's fate in abraham
[1:45:38] so when god dropped that on abraham as a
[1:45:39] revelation he had to stand the test
[1:45:41] imagine you know god could have talked
[1:45:43] to ac iran ibrahimo
[1:45:45] oh yes god could have been the both of
[1:45:46] them say here and abraham behold my

[1:45:50] a child and he will happen your body
[1:45:51] will be changed what not the other worry
[1:45:52] about nothing
[1:45:55] did you have faith no more

[1:47:11] was strong
[1:47:12] in faith giving praise giving glory to
[1:47:15] god
[1:47:16] and he was fully persuaded that what god
[1:47:18] has promised

[1:48:42] [Laughter]
[1:48:44] but it stays nice
[1:48:48] like they react a little bit but abraham
[1:48:51] amidst all that desert circumstance
[1:48:53] he believed god and god yes
[1:48:57] counted his faith as righteousness
[1:49:02] without any works he believed god and
[1:49:04] god called him as righteous
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:09] for believing a promise that seemed so
[1:49:10] impossible
[1:49:12] how on earth could this bribe be
[1:49:14] transformed after 40 plus years
[1:49:17] waiting on the promise of the father
[1:49:19] from malachi 4
[1:49:20] dynamics to the mechanics he said the
[1:49:22] dynamics of this church
[1:49:24] will be a refilling of the holy ghost oh
[1:49:27] man i feel like jumping though
[1:49:30] the prophecy the dynamics of this church
[1:49:32] [Applause]
[1:49:37] what am i supposed to look for what am i
[1:49:40] supposed to expect
[1:49:43] might have some bums inside here you
[1:49:45] won't be seated
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:48] the capstone haven't dropped yet so what
[1:49:50] love groups have
[1:49:53] let's feel your love have a quote on the
[1:49:56] one called friendship love
[1:49:58] all right they're not capstone well the
[1:50:00] group i go to they're so
[1:50:01] loving they're so kind here with all the
[1:50:04] capstone
[1:50:05] they have more love together because
[1:50:08] they love that god talking about in this
[1:50:10] hour is not gonna fill your business
[1:50:12] everybody love their own even jesus
[1:50:13] bless his own disciples he said you do
[1:50:15] better than that you're a veteran
[1:50:16] everybody pharisee like they own they
[1:50:18] have love among themselves sadducees of
[1:50:20] their own and that's how they say he's
[1:50:21] the best that you see in the whole wide
[1:50:22] world
[1:50:23] yes because you give me this and you
[1:50:24] give me that fine
[1:50:26] all the groups love their own but that's
[1:50:28] not what we're talking about
[1:50:30] we're talking about agape love talking
[1:50:33] about divine love
[1:50:34] that does the will of god come on now
[1:50:37] help me jesus
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:51] what would drive jesus to go to their
[1:50:52] side it's not the love of god for that
[1:50:55] soul
[1:50:56] bombed by those endeavors and jesus
[1:50:58] proven something to us
[1:50:59] don't let them devils stop you
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:04] the bible described the man's condition
[1:51:06] they kind of chained him up
[1:51:07] he breaking his chin the couple closed
[1:51:09] at him he got all closed
[1:51:11] when jesus finished with him the man
[1:51:12] dressed in his right mind
[1:51:14] man fully clothed
[1:51:32] study the stone once they come in on my
[1:51:34] stone somewhere
[1:51:35] watch this protocol look for this stone
[1:51:38] the clavicle light
[1:51:39] for every goliath for every goliath in
[1:51:42] my life
[1:51:43] there got to be a stone somewhere if i
[1:51:45] could only find that stone
[1:51:47] i'm going to deal with that goliath i'm
[1:51:49] going to be with my goliath
[1:51:51] once i can find that stone lord show me
[1:51:54] that stone
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:07] maybe season so there's faith
[1:52:11] of the fathers turn back to the faith of
[1:52:13] the father
[1:52:14] seven tons give feed this feet of the
[1:52:17] son of god this feat is to be tried
[1:52:20] gold and silver doesn't come out of the
[1:52:21] ground pier
[1:52:24] you know they're gonna get pure gold
[1:52:26] your silver are going and sell it
[1:52:31] that the magnet and dig it out and it
[1:52:34] doesn't look nice
[1:52:35] sometimes it doesn't even recognize what
[1:52:37] it really is until
[1:52:38] fire
[1:52:42] until the gold smith or the silversmith
[1:52:45] began to deal with it
[1:52:48] when god called you out you really
[1:52:51] wasn't looking nice now
[1:52:55] [Applause]
[1:52:56] god
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:02] don't let the dirt fool you don't let my
[1:53:06] failures fool you
[1:53:08] don't let the sin fool you because when
[1:53:10] the refiners fire
[1:53:13] come upon my life
[1:53:19] hallelujah i shall be
[1:53:22] asked your goal
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:36] notice when jesus received the spirit
[1:53:39] it led him straightway into the
[1:53:40] wilderness to be tested
[1:53:43] to be tempted and when we come into the
[1:53:46] adoption time
[1:53:47] and that's what we're heading for now
[1:53:49] it's time to come into the place of
[1:53:51] trying
[1:53:52] amen before jesus had this big display
[1:53:54] of power here is to overcome the lust of
[1:53:56] the eyes
[1:53:57] the lust of the flesh the pride of life
[1:53:59] in privacy
[1:54:04] it has some ministers you know just walk
[1:54:06] with us
[1:54:14] jesus led by the spirit solo

[1:56:29] i remember you said tell the church a
[1:56:30] long time to ask god for revelation to
[1:56:32] fellowship here

[1:56:48] so must come into that place of trying
[1:56:51] now first peter 3
[1:56:52] 2 7 blessed be the god and father of our
[1:56:55] lord jesus christ which
[1:56:56] according to the abundant mercy had
[1:56:58] begotten us and a lively hope
[1:56:59] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:57:01] the dead i love this
[1:57:03] to an inheritance incorruptible on
[1:57:05] defile feed another way
[1:57:07] reserve in heaven from you give me the
[1:57:10] whole hug
[1:57:11] the whole story it's reserved it's
[1:57:13] uncomfortable it's there for you
[1:57:15] amen isn't that right to inheritance and
[1:57:18] corruptable undefiled
[1:57:19] feeling with reasonably who are kept by
[1:57:22] the power of god
[1:57:22] true faith on the salvation ready to
[1:57:26] reveal
[1:57:26] the last time wherein you greatly
[1:57:28] rejoice don't know
[1:57:30] for season if need be ye are in
[1:57:33] heaviness
[1:57:34] through manifold temptations that
[1:57:38] here we go the trial of your faith being
[1:57:41] more precious than gold that parachute
[1:57:44] don't be tried with fire might be found
[1:57:46] unto praise and unknown glory at the
[1:57:48] point of jesus christ
[1:57:50] so god doesn't want a product that is
[1:57:52] untried
[1:57:54] his products are tried his sons
[1:57:57] are tried his daughters are tried
[1:58:00] isn't that right but when god finished
[1:58:02] with him it's approved
[1:58:04] that's why balram says what we need is
[1:58:05] thousands of lived voices
[1:58:07] that's the thunder that shakes it lived
[1:58:09] already it overcome in polish and
[1:58:11] martinez in colombia it lived already
[1:58:14] god won the qualified voices alive
[1:58:17] that's the thunder that shakes not
[1:58:18] letter quote
[1:58:22] the quote is not going to shake the
[1:58:23] devil hallelujah
[1:58:26] let's talk about another brother isaiah
[1:58:29] he was leaning upon king yuzan king
[1:58:32] josiah died because he thought because
[1:58:33] he's a king
[1:58:34] he could play priests
[1:58:37] and the king went and tried to do the
[1:58:39] priest work and got judged
[1:58:41] leprosy struck him right there and he
[1:58:43] died that shook up is i
[1:58:46] run into the temple now and god began to
[1:58:48] show him something
[1:58:49] he said i saw stood seraphim's he saw
[1:58:52] the lord high and lifted up
[1:58:54] train filled the temple above it stood
[1:58:55] the seraphims each one had six wings
[1:58:57] with twenty covered his face between
[1:58:59] covered his feet which we needed fly
[1:59:01] and one cried as another said holy holy
[1:59:03] lord god almighty the lord is the lord
[1:59:05] of hosts the whole is full of thy glory
[1:59:06] and the post of the door was moved by
[1:59:08] the voice of him that cried and the
[1:59:10] house was filled with smoke
[1:59:11] then said i woe is me i'm undone because
[1:59:14] i'm a man
[1:59:14] of unclean lips but this is important
[1:59:17] because he's a prophet
[1:59:18] he speaks a god but then in this
[1:59:21] presence
[1:59:22] there's a behavior that came upon his
[1:59:23] life there's an effect it had upon him a
[1:59:26] vision broke upon him and
[1:59:27] transforming totally and completely and
[1:59:29] then he says now watch
[1:59:30] who is me from undone uh
[1:59:33] lips and i dwell in the midst of a
[1:59:34] people and clinics for my eyes i've seen
[1:59:36] the king the lord of hosts
[1:59:37] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[1:59:39] having a life coal in his hand
[1:59:41] which had taken with the tongue some of
[1:59:42] the altar
[1:59:44] wow laid it upon my mouth and said lo
[1:59:47] this had touched my lips the iniquity is
[1:59:49] taken away thy sin purge
[1:59:51] i heard the voice of the lord saying
[1:59:53] whom shall i send who will go for us
[1:59:54] then
[1:59:55] i hear my send me amen
[1:59:58] and this is brother branham he said the
[2:00:00] prophet had been leaning upon the
[2:00:02] kingdom
[2:00:03] and when he found out that something
[2:00:04] taken place no matter how much a man
[2:00:06] has been blessed yet when god when he
[2:00:08] steps across that boundary line
[2:00:10] between error and truth god calls his
[2:00:13] hand
[2:00:14] then isaiah went to the temple fell
[2:00:16] along at his knees no doubt
[2:00:18] yes he said he fell down to the temple
[2:00:20] at the ultimate in the crowd
[2:00:21] and as he cried god came in a vision and
[2:00:24] he saw the angels he said i saw god
[2:00:26] lifted up
[2:00:27] god was lifted to a place that man
[2:00:31] cannot come then he become
[2:00:32] influenced in another way he saw god
[2:00:34] lifted up high
[2:00:35] way up his train he looked and the
[2:00:37] pillars began to move begin to shake
[2:00:39] at the voice he never saw that isaiah he
[2:00:43] saw what a mortal man can feel
[2:00:44] oh here what isaiah saw he saw
[2:00:47] that a mortal man can fail
[2:00:51] fall no matter how much he is blessed
[2:00:56] and that is why it's a shame for
[2:00:58] ministers to deceive the people
[2:01:00] by putting everything upon the people
[2:01:01] about them that it's got to be them
[2:01:06] that's a shame amen because a man
[2:01:08] because of blessings can fall
[2:01:12] ten percent you don't believe that
[2:01:17] but that is what i just said i didn't
[2:01:20] say the prophet said it
[2:01:22] let me read it again in case you really
[2:01:24] understand what i say
[2:01:26] he saw that mortal man can
[2:01:29] fall no matter how
[2:01:32] much he is blessed
[2:01:36] he can still fall one
[2:01:39] so then he get a look at one that can't
[2:01:41] fall whose foundations are sure
[2:01:44] the vision of the temple saw god lifted
[2:01:46] up god being lifted up isn't that right
[2:01:49] he said now watch isaiah seen that the
[2:01:51] king as soon as he got it out of his
[2:01:53] calling god smote him with leprosy
[2:01:55] then as i thought what must i do uzziah
[2:01:57] was dead
[2:01:58] he had lean heavy on his arm he thought
[2:02:00] he was gone what would he do
[2:02:01] life itself was gone from him nearly so
[2:02:03] what did the young prophet do
[2:02:04] he made his way down to the temple and
[2:02:06] pray he fell under the altar and he
[2:02:07] cried out
[2:02:08] sometimes god let the very props be
[2:02:10] knocked from under us
[2:02:12] sometimes he let sickness strike us he
[2:02:15] let sickness strike us he lets
[2:02:18] disappointments heartaches strike us
[2:02:23] amen you saw the immigrant lighter
[2:02:25] [Applause]
[2:02:27] weight on the devil we're talking about
[2:02:30] god he
[2:02:32] so he using the devil to accomplish his
[2:02:34] papers
[2:02:36] because he want to get something out of
[2:02:37] you sometimes you don't even know what's
[2:02:39] inside of you
[2:02:41] but he's got to get it out because he
[2:02:43] want to make you a vessel of honor
[2:02:47] he wants you to be purged and persian
[2:02:51] could only come through a process
[2:02:52] [Applause]
[2:02:55] sometimes he does that to get you where
[2:02:57] you would be influenced by the gospel be
[2:03:00] wise enough to catch it
[2:03:01] don't be stupid enough to walk away from
[2:03:02] it isaiah noted
[2:03:04] that he must find something different
[2:03:06] what did he do he went to the temple
[2:03:09] he saw god on the throne lifted the way
[2:03:11] up he saw the seraphims here we go i
[2:03:13] want to get on to this a little bit
[2:03:15] seraphim mean burners
[2:03:18] the seraphim means which is next to the
[2:03:21] altar actually
[2:03:22] the seraphims is the one who receives
[2:03:25] the sacrifice
[2:03:26] and cleanses the worshipper
[2:03:30] and then presents him to god
[2:03:33] so when you come to worship that fire
[2:03:36] presence
[2:03:38] caused some of the altar coming around
[2:03:40] you
[2:03:41] to prepare you to approach god
[2:03:45] you just come to god there must be a way
[2:03:47] made to approach god
[2:03:48] when the pillar fire came on monk sinai
[2:03:50] god tell moses to put on stakes
[2:03:52] and tell the people don't let the animal
[2:03:54] pass there it got to be killed
[2:03:56] don't cross that mark hallelujah monkey
[2:04:00] becomes holy because the holy god is on
[2:04:01] the mountain
[2:04:03] wherever god is it comes holy and you
[2:04:06] are the temple of the holy ghost
[2:04:07] [Applause]
[2:04:09] glory hallelujah
[2:04:13] you are more than just an ordinary
[2:04:14] person walking god said you are the
[2:04:16] temple
[2:04:17] you are the host they're going to keep
[2:04:20] god
[2:04:21] they're going to house god you are very
[2:04:24] important to god
[2:04:27] could we hear a shout in the house then
[2:04:30] you can look to do your own thing
[2:04:32] you got to get your life conformed to
[2:04:34] his will
[2:04:41] cleanses the worshipper then presents
[2:04:44] him to god
[2:04:44] this seraphims are angelic beings they
[2:04:47] are the very one next to god right at
[2:04:49] the altar
[2:04:50] they receive the sacrifice it shows the
[2:04:53] justice of god
[2:04:54] that sin cannot come in his presence
[2:04:57] until it's been atoned
[2:04:59] and these seven seraphims remember in
[2:05:02] the seventh church ages they guarded the
[2:05:03] gospels
[2:05:04] one on either side they were in the
[2:05:06] gardener eden with the flaming sword
[2:05:08] guarding the altar so when god tell him
[2:05:11] oak are eden
[2:05:13] and god tell the servants to protect
[2:05:14] that tree unless he called with his
[2:05:16] perverted life
[2:05:17] and have eternal life and he served him
[2:05:19] with god in the tree
[2:05:20] now they serve him trying to get you
[2:05:21] back to that tree oh my hallelujah
[2:05:25] oh glory like uziah trying to usurp
[2:05:29] the place of an anointed office because
[2:05:31] he was a big fellow
[2:05:32] among god's people they are no big
[2:05:34] fellows
[2:05:37] fivefold they're
[2:05:40] massive
[2:05:43] real big ghost people there's no big
[2:05:46] fellows
[2:05:47] we are all children of god god gave us
[2:05:50] one of us wanting to do and another
[2:05:54] thing to do so you are just as important
[2:05:57] as the minister
[2:06:03] god may have a little thing for you to
[2:06:05] do and that's very important in the
[2:06:06] kingdom of god
[2:06:09] just as important

[2:24:44] understood the storm was coming all
[2:24:45] right
[2:24:46] he knew what happened it was only a test
[2:24:48] of their fate
[2:24:50] he knew this almost coming
[2:24:55] that's good i thought that was a good
[2:24:56] one jesus knew the storm was coming
[2:24:58] he wouldn't have a strong sleep leaving
[2:25:00] them to see what the food will do
[2:25:02] and they're singing the special student
[2:25:04] god is so good

[2:25:23] jesus said speak to yourself they'll
[2:25:25] know he understood the storm was coming
[2:25:27] and it will happen it only gives them a
[2:25:28] test of fate and maybe
[2:25:30] these troubles is only done maybe the

[2:25:34] do about it
[2:25:35] maybe maybe sickness struck you
[2:25:37] discourse not not know what was nobody's
[2:25:39] sin

[2:25:44] nothing happens just commonly not
[2:25:46] without god knowing that he knows it
[2:25:48] and all these things happen because it's

[2:29:50] isn't it strange how god leads his
[2:29:52] people very strange as soon as jesus was
[2:29:54] baptized he went to the wilderness to be
[2:29:56] termed the devil
[2:29:57] as soon as israel came out under the
[2:29:58] blood and circumcised by the holy spirit

[2:32:51] them i'm identified with david with
[2:32:53] samsung with just i but the heroes of
[2:32:55] faith

[2:33:19] hard
[2:33:20] see all is well she belong as well
[2:33:23] so here it is all his will
[2:33:27] there's a reason why she riding so fast
[2:33:29] she have a dead son into back there she
[2:33:31] don't want you to know what's going on
[2:33:34] she's going to elijah elijah is a man of
[2:33:37] god

[2:33:41] hallelujah child was raised from the
[2:33:43] dead and god going to ask some men of
[2:33:45] god men going to be villain god
[2:33:47] men will become the temple of the living
[2:33:49] god but we want to identify a little
[2:33:50] process
[2:33:51] for you to become a vessel of honor if
[2:33:53] any man purge himself there's a persian
[2:33:55] there's a cleansing there's a purifying
[2:33:57] there's a refining
[2:33:58] that has to come prophet call it honing
[2:34:00] honing
[2:34:03] oh glory to god hallelujah then we're
[2:34:06] going deeper now
[2:34:08] to become temples of the living god god
[2:34:11] was veiled in peter
[2:34:13] and that's what our nasty sapphire did
[2:34:15] not understand they thought that was the
[2:34:17] same brother peter that was the same
[2:34:18] house
[2:34:20] but that was a different man fire was
[2:34:23] upon that throne
[2:34:24] god was on top of that throne listen my
[2:34:28] god hallelujah
[2:34:29] and the prophecy will repeat again let
[2:34:32] me go further now
[2:34:33] okay my very final fire
[2:34:37] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[2:34:40] reign with him
[2:34:41] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[2:34:43] for this is
[2:34:44] character simply is never made
[2:34:47] without suffering character is a
[2:34:50] victory not a gift that's why blessings
[2:34:54] have become cursed i think somebody
[2:34:57] uh england did i think some girls should
[2:34:59] win the lotto age 17
[2:35:00] and she want to sue them and say they
[2:35:02] shouldn't allow anybody to win it on
[2:35:04] age 17 because um her life has been
[2:35:08] messed up by all this money
[2:35:09] it was too much of money and she did all
[2:35:11] this to herself she buy house this now
[2:35:13] she's broke
[2:35:14] she messed up she have no life she's
[2:35:16] frustrated she said she never should
[2:35:18] have wanted to begin with she's suing
[2:35:24] them
[2:35:34] they don't know how to make it it hit
[2:35:36] them and they
[2:35:37] blow it character is
[2:35:40] a victory not a gift
[2:35:43] and character is simply never made
[2:35:46] without
[2:35:47] suffering so all of you who don't want
[2:35:50] suffering and don't want to pain and you
[2:35:52] you know what i mean you spoil your
[2:35:53] children you spoil your wife you spoil
[2:35:55] your husband you spoil everybody you
[2:35:56] could spoil
[2:35:57] all i could tell you is a good happiness
[2:35:58] bulgerian
[2:36:00] so you do the spoiling but when god has
[2:36:02] agreed with you he not spoiling you
[2:36:05] he will go through the process like noah
[2:36:06] like moses like abraham he never spoiled
[2:36:08] none of them
[2:36:09] he straight them out he correct them
[2:36:11] jacob every one of them you know
[2:36:13] their sons too
[2:36:16] but all of them came to the grinder and
[2:36:18] they came out right
[2:36:23] don't give up on anybody don't write
[2:36:26] anybody off
[2:36:27] when that vessel was mad in the potter's
[2:36:29] hand he repurposed it
[2:36:31] he reset it he re-channeled it
[2:36:34] he cannot throw it away he cannot dump
[2:36:37] it
[2:36:37] but he choose to hold you glory
[2:36:41] give him praise inside of here
[2:36:50] character is a victory not a gift
[2:36:53] a man without character cannot reign
[2:36:55] because power apart from karate satanic
[2:36:58] but power character is fit to rule and
[2:37:00] since he wants to share his throne
[2:37:02] on the same basis he overcame and sit
[2:37:04] down at his father's throne then we
[2:37:06] have to overcome the sith with him and
[2:37:09] the little temporary suffering we go to
[2:37:11] now
[2:37:11] is not worthy to be compared to the
[2:37:13] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[2:37:15] in us
[2:37:16] when he comes what treasures is later
[2:37:19] for those who are willing to enter in
[2:37:21] his kingdom
[2:37:21] into his kingdom with much tribulation
[2:37:24] oh give him a shout
[2:37:25] out hallelujah hallelujah
[2:37:29] hallelujah take it that strange concern
[2:37:32] the fairy trials that is a trial
[2:37:35] what god wants us to develop is a
[2:37:37] christ-like character
[2:37:39] that comes through suffering amen you
[2:37:41] say we all have trials
[2:37:42] we have all have tried and chastened us
[2:37:44] sons but not one goes through that the
[2:37:45] church that is not suffering is not
[2:37:47] being tried
[2:37:49] the church that is not suffering
[2:37:52] and is not being tried isn't of god
[2:37:57] [Music]
[2:37:58] i think i've seen it again the church
[2:38:01] that is not suffering
[2:38:03] and is not being tried isn't of god
[2:38:06] for whom the lord love it hebrews 12 6.
[2:38:09] he chastened it and scorched at every
[2:38:12] son
[2:38:13] who he receive it and if you're with
[2:38:15] ultrasonic
[2:38:16] aware of all the particulars then you
[2:38:18] are bastards are not sons
[2:38:20] there is no special condition in smyrna
[2:38:23] this special conditions mana must be
[2:38:24] applied to every age
[2:38:25] there is no age free from it there is no
[2:38:27] true believer free from it
[2:38:28] this is of god this is the will of god
[2:38:32] it is needful we need the lord to teach
[2:38:35] us the truth
[2:38:36] that we are to suffer and be christ like
[2:38:38] in doing it
[2:38:42] when you're on the phone gossiping and
[2:38:43] telling people about where you're going
[2:38:45] through and where you're going try where
[2:38:46] you went to
[2:38:46] that is not suffering like christ

[2:39:50] this angry god
[2:39:52] but he's teaching us something here the
[2:39:54] cloudy skies and storms of life

[2:41:03] down these things here oh my
[2:41:04] god last time i preached here i talked
[2:41:08] about the potter's house

[2:41:11] to the potter's house and i will show
[2:41:13] cause you to hear my words i went on to
[2:41:15] the potter's house and behold he wrote a
[2:41:17] work on the wheels
[2:41:18] and the vessel that he made the clay was
[2:41:20] mad in the hand of the potter
[2:41:21] so he made it again another vessel
[2:41:25] and it seemed good to the party to make
[2:41:27] it then the wilderness came to me saying
[2:41:29] o house of israel kind of i do with with
[2:41:31] you as this spotter says the lord

[2:41:45] he's not leaving the clay on his own he
[2:41:47] is
[2:41:48] molding it he is shaping it
[2:41:52] he's feeling it there's any stones in it
[2:41:54] to take it out
[2:41:56] oh yes oh yes he's channeling it for a
[2:41:59] vessel of use
[2:42:00] a vessel of honor a blessing that he can
[2:42:03] use
[2:42:04] because you have to make the vessel that
[2:42:05] he can use a vessel of honor that god
[2:42:08] can use
[2:42:09] oh hallelujah that was the potter
[2:42:12] that was a claim no devil in there

[2:42:54] problem
[2:42:55] every burst that buried fruit he
[2:42:57] purchased it
[2:43:00] so he's not interested in non-fruit
[2:43:02] branch
[2:43:04] he's interested in brands of producing
[2:43:05] fruit and once he's a fruit he's a purge
[2:43:10] now you may take fruit fruit
[2:43:13] fruit
[2:43:16] the object behind that more fruit

[2:43:32] to you abide in me
[2:43:33] and i in you as the branch cannot be a
[2:43:35] fruit of itself accepted abiding in the
[2:43:37] vine
[2:43:38] no more can you accept your body than me
[2:43:39] i am the vine you are the branches he's
[2:43:42] a divider than me and him
[2:43:43] the same bringing forth much fruit for
[2:43:45] without me you could do nothing
[2:43:46] if a man about not in me is cast out as
[2:43:48] a branch is withered
[2:43:50] men gather them cast them into the fire
[2:43:51] they are burned if you abide in me

[2:44:06] you ask what you will
[2:44:07] so you in charge to ask whatever you
[2:44:10] will
[2:44:11] because you abide in him you are
[2:44:13] arrested in him
[2:44:14] you understand a revelation that you are
[2:44:15] a branch of god connected to the vine
[2:44:18] and the life of the blind is throwing
[2:44:19] through you producing the fruit that god
[2:44:21] needs
[2:44:22] which isn't the fruit that god wants so
[2:44:24] you become a channel of god i
[2:44:26] am of god a vessel of god a tool of god
[2:44:29] use of god devil is all the picture
[2:44:33] you're coming into god's wisdom now
[2:44:35] you're coming to god's maturity now
[2:44:37] you're coming at a different level
[2:44:39] altogether where your whole work becomes
[2:44:41] god inspired god directed
[2:44:44] amen
[2:44:52] who may abide in the day of his coming
[2:44:56] who shall stand when he appeared for
[2:44:58] he's like a refiner's fire
[2:45:00] and like a full of soap and a standard
[2:45:02] full of soap
[2:45:03] is some kind of lie some kind of soap
[2:45:05] that made and didn't clean and clot
[2:45:07] to make cloth clean and the way it is
[2:45:10] done
[2:45:10] they have to walk on it and sprinkle it
[2:45:12] and whatnot they can't leave it and walk
[2:45:14] away
[2:45:15] they have to stick with it so just as
[2:45:17] the vines connect with the branch
[2:45:19] just as the potter is connected with the
[2:45:21] clay the fuller soap
[2:45:23] cleaning the cloth you have to connect
[2:45:24] with the soap connect with the cloth and
[2:45:28] scrub that cloth
[2:45:29] and wash that cloth you can't leave it
[2:45:30] it'll spoil it you have to stick with it
[2:45:33] to work with it
[2:45:34] you're not moving away from it that's
[2:45:35] the fullest but tonight we want to talk
[2:45:37] about the refiner's fire
[2:45:39] he shall sit as a refiner
[2:45:44] who shall abandon day of his coming who
[2:45:46] shall stand when he appeared for he is
[2:45:48] like a refiners fire like a fuller soul
[2:45:50] he shall sit as a refiner and purify of
[2:45:53] silver
[2:45:54] he shall purify the sons of levi and
[2:45:56] purge them as gold
[2:45:58] and silver that they may offer unto the
[2:46:00] lord and offering in righteousness
[2:46:02] and this is a story there was a group of
[2:46:06] women in bible study
[2:46:07] on the book of malachi as they were
[2:46:09] studying chapter 3 they came across
[2:46:11] these verse 3
[2:46:12] that he would sit as a refiner and
[2:46:14] purifier of silver
[2:46:16] this verse positive woman and they
[2:46:18] wondered what the statement meant about
[2:46:20] the character nature of god
[2:46:23] one of the women offered to find out the
[2:46:24] process of refining silver
[2:46:26] and get back to the group at the next
[2:46:28] bible study
[2:46:30] that week this woman called up a silver
[2:46:32] smith
[2:46:33] and make an appointment to watch him at
[2:46:35] work she didn't mention anything about
[2:46:37] the reason for her interest beyond her
[2:46:39] curiosity
[2:46:40] about the process of refining silver as
[2:46:42] she washed the silversmith
[2:46:44] he held a piece of silver over the fire
[2:46:46] and let it heat up
[2:46:48] he explained that in refined silver one
[2:46:50] needed to hold the silver in the middle
[2:46:52] of the fire
[2:46:53] where the flames are the hottest has to
[2:46:56] burn away all the impurities
[2:46:58] the woman thought about god holding us
[2:46:59] in such a hot spot then she thought
[2:47:01] again about the verse he sits
[2:47:03] as a refiner and purifier of silver
[2:47:07] she asked the silversmith if it was true
[2:47:09] and he had to sit there in front the
[2:47:11] fire the whole time
[2:47:12] the silver is being refined the mana
[2:47:15] instead and said yes
[2:47:16] he not only had to sit there holding the
[2:47:18] silver we had to keep his eyes on the
[2:47:20] silver the entire time
[2:47:22] it was in the fire if the silver was
[2:47:25] left a moment too long in the flames
[2:47:27] it would be destroyed
[2:47:37] he shall sit as a refiner
