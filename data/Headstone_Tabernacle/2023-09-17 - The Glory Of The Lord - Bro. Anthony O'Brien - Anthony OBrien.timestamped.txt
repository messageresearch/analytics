[55:31] so just one portion of scripture want to
[55:34] read from this morning
[55:38] Sydney happy to be here in the house of
[55:40] the Lord second Corinthians chapter 3 we
[55:42] want to read from and um praise
[55:48] God Amen you appreciate the
[55:51] Lord 2 Corinthians chapter
[55:54] 3 I ask the Lord what do I read this
[55:57] morning told me
[55:59] said well this captures everything amen
[56:02] so so we'll read this
[56:04] amen all right Do We Begin Again to
[56:07] commend ourselves or need we as some
[56:10] others Epistles of commendation to you
[56:13] or letters of commendation from you ye
[56:16] are our epistle written in our hearts
[56:20] known and read of all men for as much as
[56:24] he manifestly declared to be the Epistle
[56:26] of Christ ministered by US Written not
[56:29] with ink but with the spirit of the
[56:31] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[56:35] fleshly tables of the heart and such
[56:38] trust have we through Christ to God what
[56:42] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[56:44] to think anything of ourselves but our
[56:47] sufficiency is of God who also ha made
[56:51] us able Ministers of the New Testament
[56:55] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[56:58] the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[57:00] life but if the ministration of death
[57:03] written and engraven in Stones was
[57:04] glorious so that the children of Israel
[57:07] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[57:09] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[57:13] which Glory was to be done away how
[57:15] shall not the ministration of the spirit
[57:18] be rather glorious for if the
[57:21] ministration of condemnation be glory
[57:23] much more do the minist ation of
[57:25] righteousness exceeding Glory which is
[57:28] what we have today amen is that right
[57:30] for even that which was made glorious
[57:32] had no glory in this Respect by reason
[57:35] of the glory that excelth for if that
[57:38] which is done away was glorious then
[57:40] much more that which remaineth is
[57:43] glorious oh so there's a greater glory
[57:46] that's promised to you this morning do
[57:48] you believe it seeing then that we have
[57:50] such hope we use great plainness of
[57:54] speech
[57:55] amen we no longer mysterious but plainly
[57:58] speak to you amen praise God these
[58:00] things and not as Moses which put a veil
[58:02] over his face that the children of
[58:05] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[58:08] end of that which uh is abolished but
[58:10] their minds were blinded for until this
[58:12] day remaineth the same Veil untaken away
[58:15] in the reading of the Old Testament
[58:17] which Veil is done away in Christ and
[58:20] even unto this day when Moses is read
[58:22] the veil is upon their heart
[58:24] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[58:26] Lord the veil shall be taken away amen
[58:29] he remove all the veils amen now the
[58:32] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[58:35] of the Lord is there is
[58:38] Liberty but we all with open face
[58:41] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[58:43] Lord are changed into the same image
[58:47] from glory to glory even as by the
[58:51] spirit of the Lord may the Lord bless
[58:54] our blessing to to the reading of his
[58:56] word this morning let's bow our heads
[58:58] now and just pray amen before we
[59:02] begin amen Heavenly Father Lord we pause

[59:12] only you could come and anoint your
[59:14] scriptures father and bring it to life

[59:21] spirit to give it life so father pray

[1:10:51] amen oh my so so in the Hebrew shakina
[1:10:56] or
[1:10:57] shakina means the dwelling or cause to
[1:11:00] dwell that's what in the Hebrew amen
[1:11:03] isn't that right Shak of Glory isn't
[1:11:06] that right in Jewish teachings it
[1:11:08] usually means he dwell or he rested upon
[1:11:11] amen and those that favored it it also
[1:11:13] means God's holiness amen the shakina of
[1:11:17] Glory isn't that right Deuteronomy 23:14
[1:11:19] for the Lord thy God walth in the midst
[1:11:22] of thy camp to deliver thee he says and
[1:11:25] to give up thine enemies before thee
[1:11:29] therefore shall they thy Camp be holy
[1:11:32] that she shall see no unclean thing in
[1:11:34] thee and turn away from thee so you got
[1:11:37] to make your Camp holy this morning
[1:11:40] you've got a responsibility to pray oh
[1:11:43] to cleanse yourself in the blood of the
[1:11:44] Lamb Hallelujah isn't that right to make
[1:11:46] yourself holy when you come before God
[1:11:49] so that his glory can be seen upon you

[1:11:54] can come he can feel free to come and
[1:11:56] dwell to come and inhabit the Lord
[1:12:00] inhabits the Praises of his people oh H
[1:12:03] so there's got to be a condition there
[1:12:05] for Holiness to dwell for his presence
[1:12:08] to dwell for his glory to dwell that's
[1:12:11] how we come to church this morning to
[1:12:13] find out how we can get into condition
[1:12:16] how we can get into a situation where we
[1:12:19] can please God with the lives that we

[1:19:17] the priest brought the Ark of the
[1:19:18] Covenant of the Lord unto his place I
[1:19:21] like that the ark came into its place to
[1:19:25] the Oracle of the house into the most
[1:19:28] holy place even under the wings of the
[1:19:31] cherubims everything was done according
[1:19:33] to instruction hey according to Moses
[1:19:37] isn't that right my my my and the priest
[1:19:40] brought in the Ark of the Covenant of
[1:19:41] the Lord into his place right okay so
[1:19:43] for the chuban spread forth their wings
[1:19:44] over the place of the Ark and the
[1:19:46] cherubin cover the ark and the staffs
[1:19:48] thereof above and they drew out the
[1:19:51] staffs of the Ark and at the ends of the
[1:19:52] stares were seen from the ark before the
[1:19:54] Oracle but they were not seen without
[1:19:57] and there it is unto this day and he
[1:19:59] said that there was nothing in the ark
[1:20:01] save the two tables which Moses put
[1:20:04] therein at Horeb and when the Lord made
[1:20:07] a covenant with the children of Israel
[1:20:09] when they came out of Egypt and it came
[1:20:12] to pass that when the priests will come
[1:20:14] out of the Holy place for all the
[1:20:17] priests that were present were
[1:20:18] Sanctified oh they were what they were
[1:20:21] Sanctified oh they were prep prepared
[1:20:23] for service and he said he did not wait
[1:20:25] and did not then wait by course and also
[1:20:28] the Levites which were the singers all
[1:20:30] of them of ASF and of hemon uh of of
[1:20:34] jedian with their sons and their
[1:20:36] Brethren being arrayed in white linen
[1:20:39] having symbols and suies and hops stood
[1:20:43] at the East End Of The Altar and with
[1:20:46] them and 100 120 priests sounding with
[1:20:48] trumpets and it came to pass the Bible
[1:20:51] says it it came even to pass as the
[1:20:53] trumpets and singers were as one to make
[1:20:56] one sound oh doesn't that sound familiar
[1:20:59] One Voice one Accord with one sound to
[1:21:03] be heard in praising and thanking the
[1:21:06] Lord oh worship it precedes the Holy
[1:21:10] Ghost oh the Lord and when they lifted
[1:21:12] up their voice with the trumpets and the
[1:21:15] symbols and instruments of music and
[1:21:18] praise the Lord saying for he is good
[1:21:21] for his Mercy endure it forever that
[1:21:24] then was the house filled with a cloud
[1:21:29] even the house of the
[1:21:31] Lord so that the priest could not stand
[1:21:34] to minister by reason of the cloud for
[1:21:38] the glory of the Lord had filled the
[1:21:40] house oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:44] hallelujah oh they were in one mind they
[1:21:47] would one Accord they were praising his
[1:21:49] name and then all of a sudden Town come
[1:21:52] a Cloud oh from Heaven not from the side
[1:21:56] somewhere but an anointing from above
[1:22:00] the weight of his glory dropped into the
[1:22:02] building oh I wonder this morning if we
[1:22:05] could get into such a condition where
[1:22:07] God would be pleased to come down in his
[1:22:10] house and fill the whole house oh
[1:22:14] hallelujah hallelujah he promise to do
[1:22:17] the same thing if you meet the same
[1:22:20] conditions oh isn't that right
[1:22:23] hallelujah oh my my
[1:22:28] my imagine such an
[1:22:30] atmosphere where the priest can't even
[1:22:32] stand to minister oh Hallelujah the
[1:22:34] preacher can't even stand to preach
[1:22:36] where the singer can't even stand to
[1:22:38] sing but the glory fills the house what
[1:22:41] happened God take control God begin his
[1:22:46] reign in that territory in that
[1:22:49] atmosphere there's no devil can stand in
[1:22:52] that atmosphere no demon can stand in
[1:22:55] that atmosphere when God takes over the
[1:22:57] service oh I'm longing for a church
[1:23:00] service when the pillar of cloud when
[1:23:03] the pillar of fire could take over the
[1:23:06] sanctuary when the minister was stand to
[1:23:09] minister but the glory of God will begin
[1:23:12] to heal the sick you begin to raise the
[1:23:15] dead you begin to create missing limbs
[1:23:18] missing organs we get to sprout in the
[1:23:22] presence of
[1:23:26] God oh my my my my that's a kind of
[1:23:30] service we are coming on to with the
[1:23:33] glory of God oh could it be
[1:23:37] today oh
[1:23:39] hallelujah oh I'm expecting it today oh
[1:23:45] my my so the prophet said on dedication
[1:23:48] 1962 he said but did you notice after
[1:23:51] the building was completed he said it
[1:23:53] was still an empty building now he said
[1:23:56] there was nothing in it but Furniture so
[1:24:00] Solomon had done all he could do put the
[1:24:02] furniture in his place everything in his
[1:24:04] place right build it exactly the way
[1:24:05] it's supposed to be built he's done all
[1:24:08] that he could do and when you've done
[1:24:10] all that you could do that you're
[1:24:12] supposed to do when you've met your end
[1:24:15] that's when God starts that's when God
[1:24:17] takes over that's when God steps in and
[1:24:19] said you've done all you could do now
[1:24:21] let me show you what I can do oh
[1:24:25] hallelujah hallelujah oh when you've
[1:24:27] come to your end brother when you come
[1:24:29] to the end of your road when you've come
[1:24:31] to what pretty Gideon talk about your
[1:24:34] last cry when you come to your last cry
[1:24:37] and you CED all you could cry and you
[1:24:40] prayed all that you could pray and you
[1:24:42] screamed all you could scream at the
[1:24:45] altar that's when God takes over and
[1:24:49] shows you oh what he can do
[1:24:53] oh he could part the spirit he could
[1:24:55] power the Holy Ghost he can heal the
[1:24:57] sick he could deliver your son he can
[1:25:00] deliver your daughter he can deliver
[1:25:01] your husband yes yes he can deliver your
[1:25:04] wife he can do anything as long as
[1:25:06] you're willing to lay it all upon the
[1:25:10] altar is your all on the altar this
[1:25:12] morning somebody answer me praise God
[1:25:18] hallelujah
[1:25:20] hallelujah cast your bread upon the
[1:25:22] Water
[1:25:23] laid upon him this morning oh
[1:25:27] my so there was nothing in it but
[1:25:29] Furniture
[1:25:30] right an empty
[1:25:33] house after a man done all he could do
[1:25:36] he still end up with an empty
[1:25:40] house because because it takes God to
[1:25:43] fill it isn't that right to make it
[1:25:46] complete oh Hallelujah so they were
[1:25:49] going to dedicate this building for
[1:25:50] worshippers to worship something
[1:25:52] something Prophet said now without
[1:25:54] Something There To Worship the building
[1:25:56] would have been in vain but the building
[1:25:59] was now ready for dedication and when
[1:26:02] the Levites and the priests with
[1:26:04] thousands of trumpets blasting the sky
[1:26:07] with lamb after lamb dying for a
[1:26:08] sacrifice of sin and the Levites
[1:26:10] positionally took their place went into
[1:26:12] the corner and got their poles and run
[1:26:15] them through the rings on the AR where
[1:26:16] the tables of stone was on the inside
[1:26:19] two tables of stone same Stone these two
[1:26:21] are one same commandment right same
[1:26:24] Covenant when these two tables of stone
[1:26:26] with the cherubims and their wings pitch
[1:26:27] across one another when these Levites
[1:26:30] only that consecrated group could be out
[1:26:33] the prophet said no man could touch it
[1:26:35] outside of them he did if he did he died
[1:26:39] huh the serious hour he said and now

[1:48:40] and take the penalty of death upon
[1:48:42] himself he laid aside his crown and his
