the Covenant we were so blessed what a atmosphere brother Anthony God bless you may God continue to anoint you and inspire you amen and give you words of life to feed this generation this generation amen well many under great expectation this morning I am I am under great expectation to see what the Lord will do among us because he promised to come Among Us promise to speak to our hearts to minister to needs our needs and that's what we come here for to get our souls ministered unto amen we had a tremendous time on Thursday that Gathering here praise God a tremendous time tremendous anointing praise God brother Isaac Hallelujah that was really really powerful Tuesday tonight Hallelujah I am blessed to see what I'm seeing praise God I am blessed amen so before we get into the service that we have for you this morning I want to just share few Thoughts with you from the prophet's message question and answers with a br God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he could deal with that will stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something you believe that see a man that God can bless and he will still keep himself a man and not be an angel or a God hallelu as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little just a little something given to him like how but BR phras that a little something just just a little something given to him he wants to be a God he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what I do me me mine all that that's the wrong attitude am God's hunting for somebody M who he could bless amen pour out the blessings and the more he is blessed the little the man will become Hallelujah and you will never get more of God until you become nothing you have got to be little yourself he that will exalt himself God will bring a beast and he will humble himself God will exalt you have got to get little before you can get big and you will never be big in your own self you'll be only as big as God will be big in you or could we give the Lord shout on that one and this is from say this the time is this the sign of the answer now I do not believe that there's anything that he has spoken all these years of my life that I have spoke to the people but what come to pass now many people have come with dreams and he would let me by his grace interpret for the people many has come with dreams and with problems that I was unable to interpret and I haven't tried to introduce to you people a gimmick that has all the answers I try to be honest to tell you what was truth and I could only tell you as he told me amen and then as it come to me I could tell you and I want to warn you in this day that we living in not saying anything against people but when you see a man when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word the amen song in the light on that one I want it to be clear this is no gimmick thing we we have all the answers no no no no I want to warn you he said yes when you see a person that got the answer to everything that is contrary to the word amen Jesus said there were many lepers in the Days of Elijah but only one was healed in the many years the 8 more that Elijah lived one leper was healed many widows in the days of Elisha he was only sent to one yeah and we find out that there are many things that God does that he doesn't reveal to his servants I'm not hearing you I want to hear a bigger amen than that many thing that God does that he does not reveal to his servant no servant is greater than his Lord and God will not share his glory with nobody he is God oh give the Lord a shout in the house and when a servant comes to a place he tries to take the place of God some do that know the playing God then God takes his life and moves him away somewhere or something we must remember that so I trust that these few things will edify you that's what you C here for edify you and we could be judged by the word because every gift going to be judged every man is going to be judged all of us going to be judged by the word oh Hallelujah so we not trying to compare ourselves with William brandham and his experience like years ago there was a brother used to preach all kind of things sit down and preach preach for two hours not preach really talk talk they were talk in those days and he said brother brandham uh melt a cigarette pack in the forest and preach a man called thinking man's filter so he can meet a fan he can meet a a box of matches he can meet anything and be a sermon from that so all of them playing mini profit they could just take a word and get an experience and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk so you find out that I am not interested in those sidh shows I call them those experience that belong to brandham and here's why you have to look at listen carefully not so much the prophet you know but the prophet's prophecy amen let me say that again amen not the prophet but the prophet's prophecy you see the prophecy said they would stagger with and have on a lips uh staggering lips and tongues and so the prophecy said that now if you're watching Jesus you could say Jesus never stagger Jesus never speak in tongues and and and fall along in the upper room and no no no so you watching Jesus but you're not watching the prophecy what Jesus fulfilled was his prophecy what is for you is your prophecy so you have to understand that the scriptures prophesy certain things to be fulfilled so it didn't prophesy we be like brother brandham have a hat and go and hunt and so on I'm not living in that kind of area and so on there's a scripture for you to be fulfilled isn't that right so you don't watch the just the prophet but you watch The Prophet's prophecy what is to be here for this time look how much mockery of brother Brandon for prophesying about the car shaped like a egg that you don't need steering wheel and it was controlled by some power look all they mck and make fun and look how they have it right now and it's normal normal normal normal but he said before the end science will increase so powerfully that they will create the car that don't need a steering wheel he saw people sitting in it and they were playing cars or playing games and whatnot and it was taking them to the destination well that's what they have now that's what they're coming up with now why we are nearing the end praise God he said before the end this is supposed to happen but we see it coming in front of us but be near in the end then there going to be a briad Revival why we are nearing the end there's going to be a super Church a super race why we are nearing the end when the power of this church Rises it will bring the brethren we are nearing the end praise God men have feeling for fear we are nearing the end Russia com in position we are nearing the end praise God Hallelujah the power is moving in the church we are nearing the end the anointing thing going to get greater and greater move higher and higher why we are nearing the end there's got to be a people prepared why we are nearing the end God can't leave us in this state we can't meet the challenge our in this state something have to happen praise the name of the Lord do you understand what I'm saying we had 50 years of this you not hearing what I'm saying this this morning oh glory to God 50 years of mechanics mechanics teaching and preaching of the word we have to switch over the Dynamics of the spirit to drive the people to Calvary then into the Rapture you're going to die you're going to rat you're going to travail you're going to grown your money can't take your in neither your job or your rank or your post or your house or your car you need a Rapture in Fai to take your in you need a power to take your hand oh Hallelujah with with all your plans you're making make sure God in the center of all that plan oh give the Lord a shout it's later than you think the lamb is speaking like a dragon Hallelujah and the bride the bride have to speak with the voice of God because the voice of God will be in the bride in last days oh hallelujah praise God it's a shaken time you know may be seated we're going to get in the scripture shortly but brother Ram says when Christ was going to Calvary much Crypt being fulfilled such a short time you see it's dragged on but then when the wheel begins to turn it's thing after thing after thing happening praise God I'm telling you it going to be something else you know but I'm Revival strike sisters got wash the dishes praise God I have the problems upon your mind you wouldn't it wouldn't no longer be a problem those petty little nonsense bling in your mind praise God you shited us so fast all what you can't overcome all what you can

God you may be seated praise God you have to experience walking with the word you have to experience that walking with their word God said so God said so God said so you feel it you touch it you a experience it but God said it can't lie God is not a man that would lie if God said it God big enough to keep it God promis it Hallelujah he going to keep it God said so I don't need a feeling to believe it God said it did God say it oh hallelujah hallelujah Satan that's what God Said and if God said it that settles it don't tell me anything about it don't question me about it don't try to twist it here and twist it here leave it like it is it's th sayth the Lord [Applause] Enoch walked with god with mechanics with the word and God took him his mechanic became dynamics that woman with a blood issue she told herself talk about problems she first problem she had was her husband husband didn't want to go to that small Church husband didn't want to hear that preacher called Jesus making

multiplying it everybody around Jesus he's popular everybody is talking about This Man Called Jesus and she is just one of them but she was not just one of them she was one of them with a fate that spoke to herself that I have to get where no man went before I have to touch where nobody touched before I have to make scriptures that's how she was she was different a different she was going to

5 reading 1 to 10 Ephesians 1 vers hisory blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his BL blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained here we go an inheritance being predestinated Ed according to the purpose of him who work all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after you hear the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed he was sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of all inheritance an until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory chapter 5 want to read from verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven know and Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no one was F worthy to open and to read the book needed to look thereon and and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seeds thereof and I beheld them low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the eldest to the lamb that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne when he had taken the book The Four beasts 4 and2 the elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them HS in Golden vials full of aors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new songs saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the Seas thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth let's bow our heads with a prayer almighty God we thank you than you for your word we thank you for this book today that is still open oh Jesus may you speak from that book may we hear from that book May each person hear their name and go free unlock the mystery of who they are that they could leave it with a consciousness of God a consciousness of who they are and where they come from and where they going Grant it Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise the name of the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus this morning of a title the Redemption of the purchased possession amen that's my title this morning the Redemption of the purchase possession and have an inspiration the coming of the Lord amen hallelujah a context scripture from 2 Peter 3 and I want to read it from verse 3 2 Peter 3:3 this is read knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scuffers walking after their own lust this is part of the package of the last days scuffers and saying this is important now saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the be I see no change where is the promise of his coming well William brandham was the promise of his coming behold I send you Elijah before the terrible of the Lord William brandham Malachi 4 scripture that was the promise amen I give you a message that forun my coming amen hallelujah and Elias is already come yes what they don't know the Lord already descend with a shout which is a message Hallelujah the Lord himself already descend they start to descend already with a shout than a voice than a trump but he is coming he is on his way we are making ready for the coming of the lord we are not making ready for a better Church come on now we are not making ready for a better building no we are making ready for the coming of the Lord that's the objective of coming to the church Hallelujah to get a people prepared for his coming are you with me yes sir for they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth are now by the same word are kept in Store Reserve onto fire against the day of judgment and parition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a th years as one day the Lord here we go is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so right now we under the Longs suffering of God that the voice of God could go on with one more ride one more voice of Mercy once more blood speaking from off the altar Hallelujah the voice of God to go out to your loved ones to your family is the mercies of God so don't talk about how dread it is how dark it is how sinful it is thank God for his Mercy amidst the darkness am miss it being dread am missst cross Darkness covering the people there's a lights are still shining there's a blood walk that we have to walk oh could we give the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also the works that are there shall be burnt up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasten until the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall milk with flent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new Heavens come on now let me hear the amen shout and that a new Heaven and new earth where it dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that long suffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written un unto you and also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things in which some things had to be understood which they that are unlearn an unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction amen ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the the error of the wicked fall away from your own steadfastness but grow in Grace in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory and honor now forever and ever amen oh blessed could we give the Lord and praise His people hallelujah oh glory to God so when Adam fell he didn't lost just his eternal life he lost his inheritance in that eternal life God was God over the universe Adam was a god of the earth isn't that right and we are promised a double portion Hallelujah isn't that right not only the baptism do a down payment but a baptism to change our B mortal bodies am isn't that right because God is Not only redeeming your soul and your spirit he has to also redeem your body also Romans 8 says but not we not only they but we also our El have the first fruit of the spirit we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of the body Hallelujah so there's a spiritual adoption and there's a physical adoption we have to come to the physical adoption but before the physical adoption there'll be a spiritual adoption where God could take his sons and said listen here him amen my life is in him my voice is in him my virtues is in him my blood flows through him hear ye him oh glory to God you understand what God going to do this hour go going to find some born Sons some filled Sons some tested Sons some tried Sons he send them to the grinder he send them to hell and they come out he send them to half place and they come through hallelujah praise God all kind of CH and testin but they're going to come out Victorious because God promised that kind of son and last days not no church W bench no no no no no rugged Sons God SE Sons Sons that won't give up sons that wouldn't let go sons that are steadfast overcoming Sons Victorious Sons sealed Sons redeemed Sons adopted sons in the last days oh Hallelujah are you looking for it are you an expectation for it not dying Sons falling Sons failing Sons but sons that belong to Joel's Army Hallelujah hallel Mighty Men of God oh give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you may be seated so let's get down now let's get down into the harness Hallelujah Israel and the church brother bandam says watch if we can't have faith for Divine Healing yes how are we going to have Rapture in fith that alone should shake up this entire message world if we can't have a healing campaign if we can't have faith for Divine Healing wait my Rapture have no Rapture coming where there's no Divine Healing it has to have Divine Healing you're going to find out what that is all about it's not by chance it's not like praying for the sick and we are Pentecostals and no no no no it's not that it's a program of God cu the Raptor is actually a glorified healing mortal put on immortality corruption putting on incorruption so healing is the earnest of the Rapture DK payment that if God could take a old liver and make a new liver you don't hear what I'm saying if God could take a old heart and give you if God could take cancer and dissolve it if God could take your female problem and [Applause] dissolve my god of God could take your Blind Eye and pop that open and give you a new player eyes new kidneys

who he called he justified and who he justified he had already [Applause] [Music] glorified oh oh oh what sin tell me what sin you can't bring up sin when the predestinated come from the Lamb's Book the blood section of the book you can't bring that up you are Justified as if you never did it never did it never did it never did it you are Justified if you never [Applause] did [Applause] you be seated God talked to Moses he said I believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit notice he didn't say Mysteries more word more knowledge more information more deeper Mysteries Hidden Mysteries mystery Mysteries the mysterious Hidden Mysteries the mysterious mysterious Mysteries and go like that mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious hidden flip it all over your one do I know all some of them get so idle now they just they're making their own Mysteries now they're making God like a puzzle that that like Catholic Church long time they taking the whole whole thing in Latin everybody clueless sick all you know confid wafer and that's it Church done they speak in tongues for the whole service they're talking Latin people don't know Latin only priests doing all the s and thing drinking his own wine and some give you a little thing and then D it and you home you good for the day well that's what them preachers doing right now they're talking Latin a Latin mystery a Latin language unknown language it's so the people don't to live nothing just say boy that is the man that is my man that my pastor as if God said truly P Rapture but said this message and teaching call his t a perfect man is the man that going to be redeemed at the end of the seven seal this is a message that ties the man that's going to be redeemed those virtues must be in the man the man can come and he have virtues anybody can say that they have all seven let me test this one let me see one just one we want to see where are we have seven virtues okay let's test it you frightened you can have all this virtuous and frighten afraid all I want to see is the test of forgiveness yes that's all I want to see you forgive me that's all I want to know because if you forgive me you would love me I short to your lovable oh come on give those some Praises people yeah feel like that in feel like shouting feel like praising God you can't tell me you have virtues you can't forgive you nutcase that makes no sense because that is what this age is about brotherly kindness because faith is based on forgiveness what a mighty God we serve he makees sure you can't get Faith until you could forgive so people could do whatever they want to do don't let it stick on you to hold a heart or a grudge Give the Lord a shout in the house the test is not for them that's when you making excuses he did me and she did me and some excuse that's you making excuses the test is on you to see if you would let it go to see if you'll forgive because when you break that song barrier of unforgiveness when you break that s and I can't forgive you in a different realm all together in a realm of communication with God then your communication restored back to God isn't that right now you could speak to the mountain then you could speak to the Rock because you have a basis of Faith to approach God a faith without fear a faith without condemnation a faith without holding anybody art oh Hallelujah Glory so I believe the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit Power signs and wonders this great pouring of God's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring Faith into the people that that will take a rapturing Fai that will take the church into Glory I believe it amen what is going to bring it great outpouring of the spirit not great explanation of Mighty gifted preachers or teachers am that's right that's right when they hear somebody preaching a teacher will come and said you know preaching does convict The Sinner but teaching this positionally place the man so the position he place the people last 50 years if the teachers are right in that context then the people have been nailed into position for that's why they can't move that's why they can't praise that's why they can't get a breakthrough because they get nailed by teachers nail them down they know everything but they can't worship God God is the object of worship what God you talking about how you can be serving God and can't worship we don't emphasize worship enough I am not talking worship because I have nothing to preach I'm talking worship because you need to do that I'm not here to pray worship worship worship because I have nothing to preach you need to do [Applause] that and I'm going tell you when you need to do that you need to do that when you're not feeling good

house Hallelujah you may be seated if somebody wi lot and they fly here raising God they wi lot it's not because of God they feeling charged by money this they smiling from Air to air but if you're

churches were intact until that when Jesus died it was was they maybe season when Jesus died they were they for a s relief boy Judas was part of the plan to give him so much silver to betray Christ and everything everything settle down now afterwards they say Jesus re the dead but they see no evidence because Jesus have private Ministry going on they don't know what going on they just among the disciples and elected they don't know nothing else but when you see Jesus begin to come from the inside to come on the outside to give demonstration of the hidden power that the pillar of fire brought in the upper room when that Jesus that they can't see they got touched when that fire that's on the inside begin to express itself on the outside in signs in wonders in miracles in the power of God

yes yes yes yes you will wak up and don't expect no encouragement from the devil because he don't know who Jesus was he never knew who Jesus was that's why I say if thou be the Son of God turn his stones and if he didn't know who Christ was how on Earth know who we are you are fighting for your place in the sun yes you are fighting for your position in Christ hallelujah praise God the devil would not believe for nothing because you smoke you drink you lie you live all kind of life and so on he knows it he saw it he had his agents he had his recorder he have his video tape everything else the only thing you don't have is blood that where Jesus coming hallelujah hallelujah so when San said did this go said blood blood blood complaining he accus blood blood no it was the blood I died for them that's why I pay the cross that's why I went to Calvary Satan complaining complaining keep on complaining but I know it was the blood oh give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house oh oh oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how many going free this morning glory to God you are going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb thou has redeemed Us by thy [Applause] blood Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah glory to God thank Hallelujah you say Satan is the ruler of the earth and its atmosphere you said atmosphere both Heaven and Earth you may be seated is now contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us while the accuser keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected that he foresaw that is why he said it's so filthy today now watch here's a human heart and he draw a heart inside of it there's a snake watch that is what makes the sin the life this one over here has a dant so two hearts which is the holy spirit that has aive he has malice the one with snake have malice hatred Envy that's what causing it is that fellow inside a deer that snake in the heart is inside a there now when you are asked to forgive you of your sins that has been forgiven and taken away but the thing that caused it is still there yeah so God forgive you for L stealing robbing whatever God forgive you but the snake is still there that's justification God forgive you but the thing that caus you to do it is still there then come sanctification watch sets our mind in order of Holiness to think right signification is a compound Greek word which means to cleanse and set aside for service the next comes the baptism of fire and the holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God here we go cleanses our hearts from sin Hallelujah and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that they did back there Hallelujah notice he didn't say teachings he didn't say Mysteries he didn't say the letter of the word he said the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin Hallelujah isn't that right a man can repent of his sins and maybe he's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds it's still there maybe he's a drunker every time he smells a drink it is still there when he gets Sanctified it cleanses that desire out of him Hallelujah it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted yes but it takes the want of it away but when he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire and hear the word cleansed burnt out cleaned up and then put into service of God because signification means set aside for service but the Holy Ghost puts us in service in service Hallelujah excuse me so look how striking he takes the a place where you had to dwell in through the same process he is called The Church who justification called The Church who sanctification then filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire he took it to a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God can dwell in it amen now watch a mystery what people did not know no day with water God judged the Earth by water and so on flood and so on it wasn't just that he was redeemed in the Earth by baptizing it in water so the mystery behind noah8 year old prophecy and the Ark and the flood was God saying I am taking back what is mine I am going to redeem my P purchase possession isn't that right he was going to die to redeem everything everything that was lost so he baptized the Earth in water when Jesus died his blood sanctify the Earth there only one thing left fire fire fire and the same way he redeems the Earth yes sir he redeems the individual you are Justified that's why you get baptized in water you are Sanctified by the blood and then God has to baptize it with fire somebody shout [Applause] fire Oh Glory Oh Glory Hallelujah oh Hallelujah you may be seated but the cents if it is how the preaching today with all these teachings and word then it means that God you don't need you just need water you just need blood and you just need word that's how God redeem the Earth but then John saw John saw a new Heaven and a new Earth John said there was no more sea but said the fire going be so powerful you're going to break up the H2 from the O there'll be no more water God going to renovate the Earth just God going to renovate your life because God going to give you a new body it going to be a glorified body this body is not the body you're going to see me in my God is a dying man there's a dying body but we going to have a glorified body we shall not hinder those that asleep they coming back for their body and our body will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet of the Lord has sung dead in Christ shall rise Incorruptible we shall be changed oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God even The Sinner Man have to rise the ungodly man have to rise everybody have to rise because there's a judgment time coming oh death is not the Judgment there's one beyond that it have come called the second death but death have no power over the Blood Washed ones oh I feel like Dan that have no power over the blood wash man my God I feel really Pentecostal right now death have no power over the blood wash ones th us redeemed us by thy blood and has made us unto God Kings and Priests oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God you may be seated let brother B describe this fire come into the Earth what it is to burn he said the baptism of fire Holy Fire from God will cleanse the earth and the heavens around it it is purchased so the redeemed can live on it live in peace notice the baptism of fire is a cleanser from sin from sickness from disease germs from sinners from the devil and all his group he's to be cast in a lake of fire Holy Fire from God coming from God watch god notice to make it ready for God to dwell in God in the new world has to come to dwell on the earth God God he dwells in the heart but he and the bride becomes one and they go to their new home in their new world here we go the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both the world and the persons that live in it amen so the world has to be Redeemed by water in Noah's Day by Blood In Jesus Day by fire that is yet to come and you have to redeem by the Water by the blood and by the baptism of fire amen could we say amen amen oh Hallelujah I know this is not preach much because it his old school Hallelujah and people want new school and then the Holy Fire and Holy Ghost of God comes down you comp it back down to your human heart and burns out the desire of sin the nature of sin how can he be a sinner and a redeemer man at the same time how can I be in a porn shop and out of the porn shop at the same time he redeemed Us by his blood by his spirit he cleanse us then come down to dwell in us the church not theom the church now watch see Satan Satan still has a claim because it's a marked but Jesus buys it by his shed blood so watch it's purchased but not yet [Music] taken I'm not hearing you you have been purchased but not yet taken so what he's coming back for he's coming back for his purchase possession and he give the Holy Ghost as a dunk payment of your inheritance Glory my God I feel the fire in the house in the building do you understand what the Comm of Lord is about he's coming back for his [Applause] purchase Hallelujah the baptism watch the baptism of fire cleanses it from all germs all diseases all sicknesses watch he redeems it the same way he does his people he makes it all the same his Plan of Redemption he's the unchangeable God always the same in his plans now in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us three stages it was attributed first was in God and he thought of himself as a human being and that transmitted him down to be Jesus now you will ever be there if you'll ever be there you was with him then for there is only one form of eternal life and that's God and you had to be part of God at the beginning not what you choose down here he he chose you that is enough to make everybody in the church shout this morning it's not even your choice and I can shout and I can rejoice and I cannot be happy you got to be crazy I am going to shout I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to be happy because

if there is no Divine Healing there is no resurrection of the body Divine Healing is the Earnest of our redeemed body Hall did you hear [Music] that Hall Divine Healing is evidence our bodies physically is going to be redeemed you heard a testimony about the woman born without eyes and she came up to the platform to BR then he spoke the word for her and then a light came and began to circle around the sockets in the middle of that he stopped and said wait a minute I forget to ask you what color eyes you want she say her hair blue is a nice color and it's [Applause] finished do you understand what that is about the God that make Eyes [Applause] Nose do you understand your body already made dust of the earth dust Thou Art dust thou shall return but God going and glorify that body because you going to glorify the Earth as it was new heaven new Earth it take a new body to come on the new [Applause] Earth you understand how Paul said if this Tabernacle be dissolved we have one wait him do you understand what Paul saying what putting off this Tabernacle this House have a new house take off this P house have another house waiting have another building waiting is a no big thing de had no power over the blood wash want no wonder Paul said de where is your thing grave where a victory you have no victory over me because I know where I'm going no devil could hold this body down oh Hall No Grave going to hold his body down you are belonging to the redeemed you belong to redeemed listen to this Divine Healing is the earnest of our redeemed body did you ever think of that if there is no know Divine Healing when you go to the Grave that's all of it you'll be there forever but I think that the power of God that would take a Cancer woman that the doctors have just given a few days she's one of thousands on records not just the man the person's testimony but the doctor's testimony one of thousands and her eaten up with few hours to live by cancer and by the earnest of her redeemed body will put her in the condition it is now what will it be when she draws the full value off of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I love that I the woman was eaten dying and she was redeemed as it was by her and she was healed he said what it going to be when she draw the full value off of the Resurrection oh we going to draw the full value we have to draw the full value oh Hallelujah he redeem your soul he redeem your spirit he going to redeem your body you'll be joined the full Val of the resurrection of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord a [Applause] shout so now you can understand why Jesus could say as a mortal man destroy this body and in three days I myself I will raise it up myself destroy it all you have to work with is three days within three days I'll raise up myself and when he died he rose within 3 days oh Hallelujah try to touch don't touch me yet I have not yet ascended to my father oh Hallelujah Jesus body passing through walls time space Hallelujah no

the house this is real this morning this is real this morning this is real this morning but that same resurrection power That Came Upon Jesus going to come upon you oh give the Lord a shout oh Hallelujah Glory the earnest you may be seated is a down payment on anything that holds it secure she's just got the earnest of it by being healed of a hideous cancer that will take her life now she's sitting there well and normal oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord he's talk about and in Jesus lay the complete salvation complete Divine Healing if there's no Divine Healing there's no resurrection of the Dead I like to wait over that we have first fruit of our inheritance the earnest of Salvation the little touch that we have watch watch watch he what he saying here now the little touch that we have when I walk up here to that screen a while screen a while ago and hear the screaming and praising God and the Holy Spirit falling and tears rolling down cheeks while we were singing all heal the power of Jesus name when I stood this morning I heard that little JW this morning sing and watch that's the earnest that's the down payment that is something get a hold of it there is the proof watch it comes upon us and take the desire of sin out of us we have no more desire to sin the worshiper once purged than something then becomes perfect where we stand with the Angelic choir when then if Divine Healing is the earnest of our redeemed bodies the earnest of our redeemed bodies and if God can reach down and take cancer ridden Florence n and Gale watch and if God can reach down to that poor wretched mortal that couldn't even raise a hands to shake hands couldn't speak till I could hear her and put her to 150 pounds in perfect health that is the earnest of our resurrected body oh Hallelujah so you can understand what will drive Rapture in faith you will understand the Supernatural and the power of God that is among the people to activate this Rapture in faith among God's people oh glory to God from who is mzc like you woman claiming your God the Holy Ghost how could the spirit of God in you ever do such a thing we in short and so on it's not a filthy spirit it's Holy Spirit now listen to this when you become subject to that spirit here we go on it shows your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened amen hallelujah amen that spirit is nothing but the seed word made manifest or quickened so in other words it come right back to the secret is the word is in the bride and then that word transform into power and that's the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is the word made spirit and power in your life so you're not coming to church in vain you're coming to church to be seated on with the word with the prophecy of the book to get the word in you this is what the devil could not understand for the last 50 years the bride was nailed down by the word Spirit of Prophecy testimony of Jesus The Living Word the word coming you word by word by word but now the spirit the Lord of the spirit the law of the spirit is in the word hallelujah going to transform that word in your life into Spirit into Power this is what the devil was not catering for he thought we going to be batted and bruised just between a long hard word battle but it's not so there's an appointed time I will return unto thee according to the time of life and you're going to have that son that's not talk now that's not 25 years saying I'm going to have Isaac no no no this is the time of life now there's a time to produce something oh glory to God when that egg hit that sperm that was a conception Isaac was on his way it had N9 months to him to come forth but he was on his way oh we have a right to Rejoice because I feel that egg hit that SPM is it has a matter of time now for that baby to come forth Oh Glory to God are you with me now hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory so when a man is Born Again from Heaven back up a little bit he talking about a woman a baby don't care how cruel she is she gets really kind what happened there's a body what this body now is not alive yet the only thing is flesh and muscles bumping and when the baby come out of the womb God breathes the breath of life into it and then it screams out so the natural body is formed and outside the womb there's a spirit life to hit that body yes sir and then you have a baby alive well reverse is also true we are Spirit babes in Christ and outside of us have that body that if this body fall down we have a body to go into isn't that right so here he's bringing it now when a man is Born Again from Heaven he become a spirit baby in Christ and when this robe of flesh is dropped this there's a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of woman that we go into and then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body h that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preach of souls in prison he turned back into theophany and if Corinthians 51 if this Earthly body be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one we have bass that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin uhhuh so you bypass the attribute of God to be what tested and temped my sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over when we are taken up into this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skipped to come right down to be tempted and tested and if we come through that there have been no temptation we would know all things the reason Jesus know all things he was word because before he was flesh that's right and then we become the word hallelujah and here we are to be formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word to feed on the word and being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you joined Church you tried this nothing satisfied but one day you just recognize it then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the Living Word you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body beli we have one waiting when Moses seen him he seen him in a theophany when Abraham saw him he saw his name he saw he call him Elohim isn't that right he was in a theophany form notice therefore the theophany here we go are you ready everybody alive right now therefore if you have died and entered into that theophany what happens something he's revealing here the theophany comes to Earth to pick up the redeemed body hallu hallu if you are here in the air you take the body to meet the Tony there you are you are caught up to meet the Lord in the air so those that have died they have to come back for the redeemed body those that are here have to leave with redeemed body pick up the teony so we have to connect we will not hinder those that are asleep oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God you come from God you going right back to God isn't that right Hallelujah now the world how did he redeemed the world first he did when it sined he washed with water baptism he Dro his blood of it and then now he tore the world out of you and renovate the whole thing by the F baptism the Holy Ghost which he will renovate the Earth so watch it show blly the watch the natural birth is tree water then blood then Spirit isn't that right what happened to a plant that rots the talk the tassel this is shock then the grain comes out watch showing plainly are you ready the predestinated is the only one that is considered in Redemption amen did you get that let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that is considered in Redemption people might think they are making like they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back to redeem is to bring back to its original bring back to the original Oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah almost finished here now praise be to God now watch from the breach watch he said he comes forth from eternity Yonder and then he's the K Redeemer he holds it all he called the contestant hand Satan they are mine now I've raised them up from the grave he take all the liars and perverts of the word all them like that with Satan and Destroy them and Li of fire now watch what happened from verse 8 to 14 we read it and I behold in the midst of the throne the four beasts Elders to the lamb seven spirits seven Church ages seven Messengers that kept the fire burning and they took the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now watch what's he done watch what taking place you talk about a jubilee this is exactly the breaking of them sees look what take place all creation is groaning no one know what to do John was weeping man fell and lost it no man was able to do anything but redem anymore isn't that right no Priest No Pope could redeem it no Mary but here in the future tonight he's a mediator and then those under the altar prayed so long they prayed for Redemption they prayed for res Resurrection we have got a representative we have got a Kinsman he come to make claims isn't that right he wanted to come back watch they wanted to come back they are going to be back Kings and Priests Glory he said I feel good to speak in tongues he said I don't have enough language he said I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels he say talk about the Jubilee when they seen the lamb come and take the blood of redemption the soul scream out we will get it all everything the elders fell down they poured out the prayers of the Saints they were presented a Kinsman represent a Kinsman for us they fell upon their faces they sang a new song that worthy and I heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and thousands time thousands and thousands sing with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was

the trees they shook and Shook and jump for joy they seen the prophet Shepherd they seen the whole nature was redeemed they scream and jump the world went in an earthquake the Rocks fell off Hallelujah and everything has taken place like in any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you it is finished your sin is finished the world is finished your Redemption is [Applause] [Music] finished final quote I have seen jumping spells Joy spells nobody hurt the mountains rung out the sun went down everything took place nobody was hurt I've seen meetings when the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood they scream they cried they shouted to the top of their voice for the
