oh this little of oh well I'm going to let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine youen Anthony thank you very much uh let us B heads would praying I got this prayer request from Kell I read it there over this afternoon while picking up my guitar from the repair shop uh the Lucia asked me what I was doing tonight when I told him we had prayer meeting he grew very serious and asked if he would remember him in prayer in talking to him I found him to be a man very much hungering and thirsting for righteousness I shared my testimony with him and he said wo it sounds like you were delivered he said yes and shared about the Holy Spirit coming into to do the work and Acts 2:38 as the promise I don't know who was more affected myself or him upon my leave and he tanked me his name is Henry Lewis if he would please remember him in prayer so let's bhead as you want to pray Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight and we thank you for guiding us together and I pray that you would visit us Lord by the little word of exaltation and by your presence coming down upon every life in every home everyone who choose to join here that you would visit them and bless them in a powerful way father we bring Mr Henry Lewis before you and I pray you would deliver him and touch his life we use brother Kelly to win that soul and bring that Soul into this glorious Kingdom Grant Lord that if he's sick and body whatever the condition is that you will touch him and visit him deliver him and save him in Jesus name I ask it and as we get here now into our session I pray you visit us by your spirit and by Your Word in Jesus name I ask it amen and other script like to read from Matthew Chapter 13 familiar scripture 3-9 Matthew Chap 13: 3-9 and he spake many things unto them in Parable saying Behold a s went forth to swow and when he swed some seeds fell by the way side the fs came and devoured them some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forward they sprung up because they had no deepness of the earth and when the sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they wither away some fell among thorns and the torn sprung up and choked them but other fell upon under good ground and brought for fruit some 100f some 64 some 34 what iss to hear him here may God bless his word now but Bram always said that God told him this if you will get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before the prayer now that's the thing be sincere when I pray and get the people to believe so let's just zoom in on that a minute minute what this also tells us is that you can pray without being sincere note God did not tell him because you are Prophet or you are gifted or you a minister or preacher or whatever I will answer your prayer he said one you get the people to believe you and two this is up to you now that you will be sincere When you pray so the condition of his heart is to be sincere to be sincere is to be authentic to be genuine to be open no Fe to be honest to show what you really feel to be sincere means that you are free from pretense or deceit so this is a hard condition not church not joining church or going to church or going back home this is your own heart now now the parable we read note that the seed is the constant the atmosphere is variable Wayside Stony thorny good but the seed which is the word is Con Wayside atmosphere variable on the edge you're hearing more unbelievers than Believers you are hearing worldly stuff than word stuff the Stony atmosphere variable that's why I calling it hard attitudes no depth surface Christianity going to church is about enough nothing is Tak seriously the thy atmosphere varable love the cares love the responsibilities of Job and Family it brings excuses as to why you can't do this or that the cares of life keep you away from making time for God the good atmosphere variable living in God's Pavilion living in God's presence conscious of presence so friends tonight you create that atmosphere for prayer or the atmosphere for prayer have to be created remember he said if you get the people to believe you be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer so now I want to go to Mark 11 from scripture and there after Jesus cursif vict tree verse 22 said Jesus answered said unto them have faith in G verse 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and th shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he seeth but this is the verse I want to get to verse 24 We Struck it before and I fa to bring it again tonight therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them now in the light of talking about sincerity this particular verse carries a lot of weight because you cannot be hypocritical and believe that you're going to receive them you have to be sincere that the the prayer that you're going to offer to God will be received and verse 25 says when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any so it's conditional that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses so SE thir tonight if you have a ought or you know have a grudge or you have some issues with somebody you want to clear that out first you want to go ask God to help you to get rid of that that you could get that what he says here when you stand praying forgive in other words don't stand praying with hate don't stand praying with malice don't stand praying with heart issues that affect your knocking on God's door and if you do not forgive neither will your father which to forgive your trespasses that means you stand as a sinner and then God will not hear sinners unless you pray a sinner prayer okay so let's go so he referred to this under the ministry explain what's the order of the word you shall receive it you shall have it first you believe you got it then it will be given to you and when you come make your confession believe God believe that he will do it and he is under obligation to do it God is worth no more than his word is no man is worth any more than his word and God is infallible he cannot ly his word is true and we just accept him by his word and believe it and it's got to happen is it that simple but over yes it is that simple Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him do you believe it he had powers upon powers and when he met Satan he never uses power he gave an example for the weakest of Christians when he met Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God the weakest Christian can take that stand hold it sure God is the word now he said it is written why it is written it is written yeah it is and he quot the scripture whatsoever things you desire When you pray so you could actually say to God Lord this is what your word says whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them watch the order of the word believe now present tense you receive it and you shall have it it will be given to you later but believe it now and then he went into this before before you can get your crop you got to plant the seed water it believe it don't dig it up every morning to see every time you dig it up you'll delay it that much more it will never grow if you keep digging it up when you settle in your heart that God has healed you sister you little boy you brother any of you settle it in your heart and believe take go at his word and start testifying about it give it plenty of water fertilize it watch what take place the word of God will produce just exactly what it says an amen Amen to that so he said he cannot heal you until first you confess it and I want to bring back something that we had that we struck on Wednesday he said when you are converted to Christ almost done I love to Christ when you accumulate a faith in Christ like you would to your wife or to your husband you accumulate a faith and you walk in that fate so he's showing how love produces an accumulation of Fate now watch this if you can believe in the Lord Jesus not only for salvation for yourself or for your loved ones and you know if you desire something that wasn't right you wouldn't have faith enough to ask God in the first place because you know it ain't right if you are sinc and know that it is right and you ask God with a clean heart knowing it's no selfish object motive and your objective and motive exactly right then ask God like a child believe you get it and you get it I know that and this is the part I want to get here I have come to Christ and I guess about 20 years since 20 years when 20 years old and I can sincerely see that I have never asked Christ sincerely for anything now that is really sincerely ask him anything that was for right but what he give it to me or told me why he couldn't do it and then later on I found out it was a good thing that I didn't get it so he's saying very plainly whatever he sincerely asked the Lord he got it and if he couldn't do it he will show him why he couldn't get it he said now remember when you believe on him and have faith in him and trust him yeah SP Saints don't try to show yourself to do it just stay with him don't the Lord now and reason it out so he's showing you a prayer approach and I want to share that with you tonight this is the example IDE like if I was coming to brother Welsh here to borrow a ,000 I guess I couldn't get it because he may not have it but if he had it and I could get it now and I come and try to lay the case down I come and say Welsh give me a thousand so watch the approach now that is no way to do it and that is no way to ask God I'll come up I will say to brother Welch could I speak to you a few minutes brother Welch sure brother BR go over to one side and sit down I say brother Welch the first thing I want to ask you do you have $1,000 that you could get a hold of for me well we are friends he'll be asking me or me him one of you Brethren it will be the same now that is what I want I lay down and show him I said brother Welch I'm over here in a meeting I'm absolutely up against it I've got to leave the town I'm $1,000 in debt I just got to have the money from somewhere now the Lord put it upon my heart to come to you and I explained to him now from another meeting that I had a certain place I've got $1,000 coming in and it would be about three months from now I can pay you I'll pay you interest in it if you want it just lay it all down and explain it to him why I don't want to leave that tongue like that it's a barting on my name if I do that they're going to say he's nothing but a cheat and a steal and leav in the tongue owing money see what I mean I'll explain it to you sit down like a brother and talk it over with you well I believe and if you like me as you do you'll do anything you would pour an automobile or sell something out of the house to get the money see now the right thing to do is come sit down and and talk it over with one another let you know and express our feelings to each other you are my friend that's the reason I come to you how many guesses tonight because he come come to say now that's the same way it is by Christ say tonight and he's saying how to approach say you are my Lord I'm sick the doctor say he can't do nothing for me but I know you can because you are now you are my Lord just speak it over with him you feel then that you receive it and that is your faith faith is a substance of things so far the evidence of things not seeming and I when I feel that way is just as good as I got it I can go ahead because I got it he done promis me that settles it I just keep holding on wait it and finally you know here comes the pouring down out of the corders of heaven then you got it so this is it stat now you understand what I mean it's by faith we do everything believe on the Lord believe on the Lord for a job believe on the Lord to to give you the wife that you should have believe on the Lord to give you the husband that you should marry believe on the Lord to send you some new furniture if the bar goes empty and the cruise gets dry and there's no food and the children are hungry believe on the Lord believe on the Lord for anything let's bow our heads almighty God I thank you tonight because this is what is upon my heart to share with your people these keys to talk it over with you to share our concerns whether is Health whether it's finances whatever it is to share it over with you and ask for your intervention God come and visit every home and heart tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen I trust and hope that this what was shared to you tonight would be edifying was edifying to you I would help you that you would be able to press on in God by God's grace so at this time we want to go straight into prayer God bless you praise the Lord [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
