[53:31] GL
[53:33] GL all the
[53:36] way all the
[53:40] way God bless you and welcome so good to
[53:43] be here this
[53:44] evening and uh we have some how do you
[53:48] say it sad news and and glad news sad
[53:52] news but the Peter chandel passed away
[53:54] today and um um it felt at first like a
[53:58] gut a punch in the gut and um but God
[54:03] knows all
[54:04] things I had the privilege of being with
[54:07] him in Ivory Coast and I preached for
[54:10] him up the last Wednesday I came back on
[54:13] on on Friday and to hear this news was
[54:16] just
[54:17] stunning but it just reminds us that
[54:20] this is not the only life that we're not
[54:23] here
[54:24] forever and we have
[54:26] uh our long home yes sir I like to say
[54:29] this way brother Peter's gone to his
[54:31] long
[54:32] home uh his work on Earth is complete
[54:34] and we want to pray for his wife and
[54:37] family and church before we go further
[54:40] tonight and as I told my wife I said all
[54:43] this is a wake up call because this
[54:45] shows us who is in charge this shows us
[54:48] who's in charge and it begs to wonder uh
[54:52] people's attitude people's behavior
[54:56] people bitterness anger and and hatred
[54:58] and Malice and plain plain wickedness
[55:02] and mockery of Christianity expect to
[55:04] wonder what people think this life is
[55:06] all
[55:07] about you work to live and you live to
[55:11] die you work hard to get stuff and gain
[55:14] stuff and yet a man's life doesn't
[55:18] consist of the things that he possess it
[55:21] and you fight to possess things that
[55:24] canot take you over Yonder and here it
[55:27] is I'm looking forward for him to be in
[55:29] our meetings in July to minister for us
[55:32] here it is we have plans we have
[55:33] thoughts and God have a different
[55:35] thought because when the saints of God
[55:37] cross over God see I bring a son home I
[55:41] bring a child home Hallelujah and then
[55:43] to think because you know I processed
[55:46] things a certain way it hit me it was
[55:48] effective of me and afterwards I said I
[55:50] begin to think how God sees it how God
[55:53] thinks it it's not gone too soon it's
[55:55] gone the right time
[55:56] he has set us boundaries that we cannot
[55:58] cross we think we can cross them but we
[56:01] can't he set those boundaries and as
[56:04] long as we live the best thing to do is
[56:06] to live uh you know like Ram says live
[56:10] live a life that is worthy of the gospel
[56:12] live a life that will be pleasing to God
[56:15] live a life that will glorify God and
[56:17] this was his first time in IV coast and
[56:19] he it was tremendous the anointing the
[56:21] atmosphere the Believers and it was I
[56:24] told him I said brother Peter I so glad
[56:26] you choose to come because other
[56:28] brothers could make a different
[56:29] situations came up and it happened that
[56:32] uh uh he had to take two Services I took
[56:34] two services but Sala took one and but
[56:38] Paul own jaob closed off the last
[56:39] service and exalted us and have a prayer
[56:42] line and and afterwards I came back to
[56:44] London and and preached my brother Peter
[56:47] um Wednesday night and the Lord blessed
[56:52] and it was quite an experience and I
[56:54] didn't have a clue that that was the
[56:57] last time I'll be seeing my brother I
[56:59] didn't have a clue but God knows all
[57:01] things and it it tells us how we have to
[57:03] work we don't have this as I told
[57:06] somebody you know I see bigger fish
[57:07] fryer people have attitudes and they
[57:09] figure they big and they own and they
[57:11] walk with this aggression and you know
[57:13] two piece of money in the pocket and
[57:14] they figure they own and whatnot and
[57:16] afterwards everything kept crumbling but
[57:18] it's lessons for us to learn it's things
[57:21] for us to think about and as we approach
[57:22] the service this evening I want you to
[57:24] think about what you need deliverance
[57:25] from and what you need a breakthrough I
[57:27] want you to have that in your heart
[57:28] because deliverance and breakthroughs is
[57:30] personal it has to be what ticken inside
[57:33] of you a lot of us I don't know why I'm
[57:35] talking this now I'll just talk a lot of
[57:37] us we tend to look outwardly we tend to
[57:40] see what others are doing to justify our
[57:42] own stuff to justify our own self and we
[57:45] make excuses but when come face to face
[57:47] with us and the word there's nobody else
[57:50] to see you can't see this one that one
[57:53] well she doing it he doing it this one
[57:55] no no you don't see that that you see
[57:57] yourself and that is where we have to
[57:59] come to each one of us not I'm in the
[58:01] message forget that forget that the
[58:04] message is the gospel which is a
[58:05] transformation in your heart and life
[58:08] the Bible speaks about a human heart is
[58:10] desperately wicked who can know it about
[58:12] God who could really know what's inside
[58:14] somebody's heart what's in your child
[58:16] heart what's in your husband heart what
[58:18] in your wife heart who could really know
[58:19] what's in but God knows and he knows
[58:22] it's wicked inside of there just a
[58:24] matter of time you know that's why he
[58:25] said a new heart I'll give you because
[58:27] you know the wicked one we have can't
[58:28] work a a heart towards God an attitude
[58:31] towards God an attitude towards his
[58:33] people then he said I'll give you a new
[58:35] spirit Oh Glory to God that you can get
[58:37] along with your neighbor get along with
[58:39] the word and then God could prepare you
[58:41] to get his Spirit a new heart a heart
[58:44] towards God a new spirit that you could
[58:46] get along with others and then God could
[58:49] give you his spirit that you could
[58:51] continue to obey his word and walk in
[58:53] the light of his word this is what
[58:55] become to Church to do to learn of him
[58:57] to learn who this God Is to learn his
[59:00] requirements and want to obey it to
[59:03] resist the devil to resist temptation to
[59:05] resist evil not say a given a given a
[59:08] given no you have to resist by resisting
[59:10] you show you love God by resisting you
[59:13] know you're coming in obedience to God
[59:15] by resisting what the devil have to
[59:17] offer Oh Glory to God is not anything
[59:19] goes this is what the society want to
[59:21] bring to us anything goes but that's not
[59:23] God program God told his son and
[59:25] daughter in G the day you eat thereof
[59:27] that day you shall surely die he told
[59:29] them that he told Adam that Adam told
[59:31] Eve that and the devil was still able to
[59:33] come use the serpent to give them a
[59:35] different picture all together we want
[59:37] to correct all of that because the
[59:38] prophet said this end time bride will
[59:40] not be like Eve she will not fall like
[59:42] Eve glory to God hallelujah praise God
[59:45] he said that woman was made to be
[59:47] deceived and be deceived deceive and be
[59:49] deceived deceive is when you're thinking
[59:53] right when you actually think in your SP
[59:56] Spirit you are right and you're dead
[59:57] wrong and you go bully down the road
[1:00:00] like that that was Eve think she right
[1:00:03] and look at us today dying people only a
[1:00:06] matter of time you know oh yes only a
[1:00:09] matter of time that's why youth is
[1:00:12] Vanity beauty is Vanity handsome and
[1:00:15] good-looking vanity after 50 years what
[1:00:17] what what US is all about that's what
[1:00:19] you're used to be you look at them black
[1:00:20] and white pictures you look at the old
[1:00:22] photos in the photo magazine but that
[1:00:25] disappear so all so when you so so so so
[1:00:29] the conclusion of the matter fear
[1:00:33] God and obey his commands fear God
[1:00:37] because he keeps his word and I don't
[1:00:40] think the people catch that years have
[1:00:43] been seing this message the message has
[1:00:45] not seen judgment yet the message world
[1:00:48] has not seen God's judgment that is why
[1:00:52] they continue in the behavior and the
[1:00:54] attitude the same God that brought them
[1:00:56] out of Egypt killed them two million
[1:00:59] people same God he brought them out and
[1:01:02] he judged them that same God is not the
[1:01:04] mayor of ARA or the mayor of San Grandy
[1:01:07] or the mayor of Trinidad you're serving
[1:01:09] it's not the Prime Minister you're
[1:01:10] serving you when you come you come to
[1:01:12] serve God Almighty when Moses brought
[1:01:15] them to the mountain and the fire had to
[1:01:17] shake they said don't let God speak let
[1:01:20] Moses speak and then God said good I
[1:01:23] will send you men that will be my
[1:01:25] mouthpiece
[1:01:26] and that is where the phrase come man
[1:01:28] shall live by bread alone but every word
[1:01:31] that proceed out of the mouth of God so
[1:01:33] God put His prophets as his mouthpiece
[1:01:35] so when they speak it's different when
[1:01:38] they speak it's judgment when they speak
[1:01:40] is God speaking it's not man speaking
[1:01:43] and after the Prophet come it have
[1:01:44] faithful ministers and Messengers to
[1:01:46] Echo the same thing the prophet have
[1:01:50] said God sent a message in this last day
[1:01:53] a way you think about it you could have
[1:01:55] be a Baptist you could be a Hindu Muslim
[1:01:57] Pentecostal Jehovah Witness whatever but
[1:01:59] God call you out not for you to be
[1:02:02] backsliding inside the church not for
[1:02:04] you to be dead inside the church God
[1:02:06] call you out for a purpose praise God
[1:02:09] you see brother Peter Chandler he was a
[1:02:10] genuine Christian just like brother
[1:02:13] zigma Coen brener these are genuine
[1:02:15] people see their life see their walk see
[1:02:18] their attitude no hidden agenda no no no
[1:02:20] funny business genuine people it are few
[1:02:24] like them praise God and for years I've
[1:02:27] been watching him I know him and I tell
[1:02:29] myself anytime I get an opportunity I
[1:02:31] will try to connect with him and get
[1:02:33] back back on you know how I know him and
[1:02:34] so like that because he was treated
[1:02:36] terribly in years ago and I said if I
[1:02:39] get a chance I will try to see if I
[1:02:40] could get that corrected and the first
[1:02:42] opportunity I got and inviting preach
[1:02:44] that he said brother what the other
[1:02:46] minister might think I said forget that
[1:02:48] they would appreciate they would love
[1:02:50] and and it was appreciated and and he
[1:02:52] was a blessing and so on and what not he
[1:02:54] has a certain personality type everybody
[1:02:56] not have the same personality type
[1:02:58] somebody are passive somebody aggressive
[1:03:00] some people are militant some people are
[1:03:02] this way and that way God build
[1:03:04] different people and and have them a
[1:03:05] certain way and you cannot choose how
[1:03:08] God set up that man because God buil
[1:03:10] that man from his mother's womb God
[1:03:12] loose that man a certain kind of a way I
[1:03:14] am built a certain way I Dem manage a
[1:03:17] certain way you can change that I can't
[1:03:20] even change that I'm built a certain way
[1:03:22] praise God because we have spirits to
[1:03:24] deal with it's not no joke plating if
[1:03:26] you caral and natural and you don't know
[1:03:27] what going inside of here you think I
[1:03:29] could take size you I could pick this
[1:03:30] brother and pick this sister I have no
[1:03:32] time for that everybody have cases
[1:03:34] everybody have condition everybody have
[1:03:36] challenges everybody looking for a
[1:03:37] breakthrough that's why you here today

[1:04:08] foolishness out and somebody tell you
[1:04:10] you can't make it and this and that
[1:04:12] forget
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:16] that Jesus come to free people from
[1:04:18] their past from their fears from their
[1:04:20] sin to get them delivered and he said
[1:04:23] who the son of man set free is free

[1:30:07] a compromising father will not rebuke
[1:30:09] his
[1:30:10] son a compromising mother will not
[1:30:13] rebuke her daughter because she's a
[1:30:15] silly
[1:30:18] compromiser but the Bible said knowing
[1:30:23] that this is loud need an age knowing
[1:30:25] that this age needs a sharp
[1:30:27] rebuke from God sometime you have to
[1:30:30] give the children a sharp rebuke is a
[1:30:33] rebuke you
[1:30:34] know yeah am when our clergy get so soft
[1:30:38] and dirty like some age grandfather to
[1:30:41] be his grandchildren ever what they do
[1:30:43] is
[1:30:44] perfect I know about
[1:30:46] that I agean thing you but you love your
[1:30:50] grandchildren and just get away with the
[1:30:52] grand grandparents where they can't get
[1:30:54] rid of mother and father that's right so
[1:30:56] the grandchildren love to go by
[1:30:59] Grandpa love to go by grandma because
[1:31:02] they could get away but God is not a
[1:31:06] grandparent he not any grandparenting
[1:31:09] that human he's only father he only have
[1:31:13] sons and daughters he does any
[1:31:14] grandparents s all right so watch this
[1:31:16] now it's been said so much that God is a
[1:31:19] good god until they try to make God a
[1:31:21] big Doty grandfather or like a Sant
[1:31:24] close then you see but he's not he's a
[1:31:27] father a father of righteousness or
[1:31:29] correction and love is always corrective
[1:31:33] not
[1:31:34] sometimes always love corrects no matter
[1:31:38] how bad it hurts it's still corrects a
[1:31:41] real mother will correct her children a
[1:31:43] real dad will correct see it gets so
[1:31:46] soft and Doty he said I he said course
[1:31:48] he lug the other day a beach lug and I
[1:31:51] jump on it and a great chunk fell off it
[1:31:53] was real rot and Duty I said that's the
[1:31:55] way Christians are becoming dead in sin
[1:31:57] and trespasses so long till they become
[1:31:59] Duty they can hold no weight at all they
[1:32:02] don't know what overcoming means and I
[1:32:04] begin to think of this text overcome
[1:32:06] keeps life in
[1:32:08] you overcome do what shout out keep life
[1:32:12] overcoming keeps life in you if you have
[1:32:15] a bad attitude you have a temper you
[1:32:17] have a and your you you say Lord help me
[1:32:19] to overcome it overcome it it gives a
[1:32:21] charge inside of you it keeps life
[1:32:23] inside of you
[1:32:24] and then you take a Christian that's
[1:32:26] supposed to be a Christian let the life
[1:32:27] of God go from him and the experience
[1:32:29] the joy of serving Christ The Joy of
[1:32:31] serving Christ there something called
[1:32:32] The Joy of serving Christ nobody are
[1:32:34] forcing you to cover your knees you have
[1:32:36] Muslims you see them the toes covered
[1:32:38] and all and the face knows only the eyes
[1:32:42] have it you only seen the eyes and they
[1:32:44] had a black veil and the Sun hot you
[1:32:47] know the son is right now they might say
[1:32:49] no God son is hot I can't no no no they
[1:32:51] wearing that am so we had a beg no
[1:32:54] Christian to pull and dress and dress
[1:32:56] properly and like that's that's ABC
[1:32:58] stuff you're getting a real
[1:33:02] fight if we are trying to follow watch
[1:33:06] then you are Christian supposed to be a
[1:33:08] Christian let the life of God go from
[1:33:09] him and experience the joy of serving
[1:33:11] Christ Living in church where such is
[1:33:13] going on he's rotting twice as quick
[1:33:15] living right under it so if we are
[1:33:16] trying to follow the message of the hour
[1:33:18] or Le this part of the message we should
[1:33:21] live constantly in the gra of Christ to
[1:33:24] stay in the Life of Christ that you'll
[1:33:25] be fruit bearing yes now he says now
[1:33:29] this is the greatest sinful age the
[1:33:31] greatest it's more sin in this age than
[1:33:33] ever been and the powers of Satan is
[1:33:37] many times harder to fight than it was
[1:33:39] in any age therefore there are certain
[1:33:41] sins you have to be prayed for prayed
[1:33:43] with to get rid
[1:33:45] of you can't even Pray by yourself you
[1:33:48] have to get somebody anointed to pray
[1:33:50] with you for you to get that
[1:33:52] breakthrough
[1:33:56] I I'll say it again there are certain
[1:33:58] things you have to be prayed for and
[1:34:00] prayed with to get it off of
[1:34:05] you because sin does attach itself to
[1:34:08] you you
[1:34:10] know haunting you terrorizing you it has
[1:34:15] to be broken off of
[1:34:17] you that's what they come to church for
[1:34:20] to get things busted off of you that you
[1:34:22] can say I am free
[1:34:26] how many want to be free you have to be
[1:34:28] free God desire is for you to be free
[1:34:31] you know is when you have Kings and back
[1:34:34] doors that you allow the enemy to come
[1:34:36] in that is how you have a a hole in your
[1:34:40] life because of things that you do and
[1:34:42] say and act and it open up a door for
[1:34:44] the enemy to come in and then the San
[1:34:45] have a right to do that a right to be
[1:34:49] there but the spirit come to cancel all
[1:34:52] these things amen all the demons and
[1:34:55] assignment had to be cancelled Oh Glory
[1:34:57] the devil come to steal Rob and Destroy
[1:34:59] he has an objective and you have to
[1:35:01] fight that back glory to God is Jesus
[1:35:04] say I come that you might have life and
[1:35:06] have it more abundantly so Jesus come to
[1:35:08] give you life Abundant Life Oh Glory to
[1:35:11] God hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:35:14] praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God
[1:35:17] let me let's go this is the age okay all
[1:35:20] right so it's more sin than in any age I
[1:35:23] ever been and the PA are Satan many
[1:35:24] times what all right back there in early
[1:35:27] ages Christian could uh belong to Christ
[1:35:30] could be beheaded for it so if you to be
[1:35:33] a saint in them times you're losing your
[1:35:35] head say you're dying for the law you're
[1:35:37] a Christian and the six time to head
[1:35:40] said n nothing that I for that you know
[1:35:42] you know you know that Saint in those
[1:35:44] times the saint in time get lose the
[1:35:46] head so the chch was pure it had serious
[1:35:48] people in those times all right so it's
[1:35:51] deceiving now so what it's so close the
[1:35:54] people so live people can live clean
[1:35:57] holy life not be sinful adulterers
[1:35:58] Drinkers and they can live above that
[1:36:00] and still not be right with it this is

[1:39:05] the on Noah day eight people overcome
[1:39:07] Noah Three Sons their wives Noah and his
[1:39:10] wife in every age God had Overcomers and
[1:39:13] God going to have Overcomers in this age

[1:39:32] that could stand the test of fire and
[1:39:35] lion and we are expected to be tested
[1:39:38] and that's the reason the right back
[1:39:39] there he that come to God must first be
[1:39:41] tested tested with what the

[1:43:28] when you trust God oh glory to God when

[1:44:03] house that's the God we talking
[1:44:08] about you have changing Banks to you
[1:44:11] [Applause]
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:19] know I was reading a book negotiating
[1:44:22] for for Bank and whatnot and I I went
[1:44:25] and call this bank called that bank and
[1:44:26] when I go to my bank the bank tell me I
[1:44:28] think 11% I said but that bank gave me
[1:44:30] 9% they all we can see what we could
[1:44:35] do then they reduce the R I said I learn
[1:44:38] something I learned something don't take
[1:44:40] what they're saying challenge them and
[1:44:42] that's what I did I challenged them I
[1:44:44] said that bank taking in other words I
[1:44:45] can move you
[1:44:46] know there
[1:44:52] move you can't overcome let's do the
[1:44:54] test given and when the test is given is
[1:44:57] to
[1:44:58] see if you can overcome or not and the
[1:45:02] test is the greatest thing that can
[1:45:04] happen to us I believe it's written in
[1:45:06] the scripture Our trials are worth more
[1:45:07] to us than precious gold it is testing
[1:45:10] time it is one good evidence to us that
[1:45:13] God is with us when we are tested for
[1:45:16] all the children of God are tested and
[1:45:18] tried all are tested and
[1:45:20] tried let me read the top part of this
[1:45:23] scripture we read unto the sh of L he
[1:45:24] said write these things said the amen
[1:45:26] the faithful and true witness the
[1:45:27] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[1:45:29] Thy
[1:45:30] Works talking to you I know about you
[1:45:34] you are neither cold nor hot I would
[1:45:36] that th would cold it hot but because th
[1:45:38] are lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will
[1:45:40] spe into my mouth because thou sayest
[1:45:42] I'm rich I'm creasing Goods have need of
[1:45:43] nothing and knowest thou not that thou
[1:45:45] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[1:45:48] I con to buy of me go tring far that all
[1:45:50] must be rich white green men that all
[1:45:52] must be clothed that the shame of thy
[1:45:54] nakedness do not appear that anoint
[1:45:56] thine eye with eyes have that th may see
[1:45:59] he called them to repent repent is to
[1:46:01] turn around repentance is looking
[1:46:03] inwards repentance is not looking
[1:46:05] outward what others doing and based upon
[1:46:07] what others doing you repent repentance
[1:46:09] is about you you in a mirror you and you
[1:46:13] alone not you and the pastor say it so
[1:46:16] and then no no no not you and nothing
[1:46:17] else not you and the Elder not you and
[1:46:19] no excuse you and you alone Hallelujah
[1:46:23] the tendency we have is to look
[1:46:24] outwardly what others have done and
[1:46:26] doing but if you are lukewarm you see it
[1:46:30] am you are back you know it you're not
[1:46:33] where you're supposed to be you know
[1:46:35] that that you have to address that you
[1:46:37] nobody could to address that for you the
[1:46:39] pastor can repent for you it's all about
[1:46:42] you oh glory to God I wear a long dress

[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:33] Perfection I want you to all to play in
[1:53:35] the cross in the cross Jesus was totally
[1:53:40] completely man he could cry like a man
[1:53:43] eat like a man he could become man he
[1:53:44] was totally physical human being he had
[1:53:47] desires and Temptations He was a man not
[1:53:50] an angel above temptation but God God
[1:53:52] took a complete man to bring a total
[1:53:55] deliverance and he filled him with his
[1:53:58] Spirit the Holy Ghost without measure he
[1:54:02] was our example we are men and women we
[1:54:06] are also Christians he is our example
[1:54:09] let us completely deliver ourselves into
[1:54:11] the hands of God that we might subject
[1:54:14] to the kingdom of God s since God can't
[1:54:17] force himself on us that's why he said
[1:54:20] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:54:23] door you have to make the choice to open
[1:54:27] the door of your heart you have to make
[1:54:30] a choice to want him to have the
[1:54:32] pinenes to want to be a servant of
[1:54:35] Christ I think Dwight Moody was
[1:54:36] challenged by a evangelist one day and
[1:54:39] say God is yet to find a man who is so
[1:54:42] surrendered to him the world is yet to
[1:54:44] see what God will do with a man that is
[1:54:47] fully surrendered to God and Dwight
[1:54:49] Moody said I want to be that kind of man
[1:54:53] you must want this thing as a reality
[1:54:57] you must want to be used of God you must
[1:54:59] want to be a tool of
[1:55:01] God
