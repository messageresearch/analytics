[11:50] we got the lady amen you know the pastor
[11:56] can't do it all

[12:00] all
[12:03] pastor can do it all amen
[12:07] blessed be his name it take it gotta
[12:12] take some members in the church now what
[12:16] who remembers do I leave it up to you to
[12:20] answer that each one of you has helped
[12:25] support this meeting with your finance
[12:28] you have supported with pray and tonight
[12:32] if scheduled walked out regularly and he
[12:36] paused he said to little women it has
[12:39] been hid away in these eight days of the
[12:43] meeting so they were having I ate their
[12:45] meeting and he was referring to two
[12:47] women who were hid away in the eight
[12:52] days has been fasting and praying for
[12:57] this meeting that's one of the reasons
[13:01] that it was a success that's right
[13:07] I trust that they're here tonight that
[13:11] was told to me by pretty good authority
[13:12] which I believe is authentic so I
[13:14] appreciate your sisters
[13:16] I appreciate you Friday night prayer
[13:20] warriors I appreciate you I appreciate
[13:24] you on behalf of the elders I said thank
[13:29] you
[13:30] the pastor cannot do it all we thank
[13:33] those who are supported the meetings the
[13:36] tabernacle here with your finance we
[13:39] thank you that I'm supported with your
[13:41] prayer because my god the pastor cannot
[13:44] do it all if you come looking for the
[13:48] pasta to do it all you are mistaken
[13:51] you know it was a time it has always
[13:54] been that way people when God first call
[13:58] out a church you know the first time
[13:59] when I BAM says the first time the
[14:01] church was called because the word
[14:04] church comes from the Greek ecclesia
[14:06] which means called out so Moses was the
[14:09] original pastor that God used to call a
[14:13] church out of Egypt no they were looking
[14:16] to Moses and when things begin to go
[14:21] seemingly order order there was a time
[14:26] they wanted to stone the pasta because
[14:30] they thought the pasta was responsible
[14:32] for what was going on but God was
[14:34] leading and you know we are told and we
[14:39] are taught that God likes to put his
[14:42] people in trouble
[14:44] so sometimes the church gets in trouble
[14:48] and it's not a pastor's fault is God
[14:51] doing that and some members when the
[14:55] trouble comes they run already church is
[15:01] the truth and they run to another church
[15:04] where they believe it have no trouble
[15:06] there but God is the one who does it
[15:08] they picked up they taught Moses was the
[15:11] one that was pausing when they see where
[15:14] Moses was carrying them actually but he
[15:17] was a pillar of fire leading he led them
[15:20] to a place where there was no water
[15:21] member they will go into a wilderness a
[15:23] desert area and you come to a point
[15:26] where there was no water and then
[15:30] someone had timed it got water I where
[15:34] they go to drink the water it was bitter
[15:35] water but God was leading it wasn't
[15:38] Moses it was a pillar of fire leading so
[15:41] God likes to put you in trouble someday
[15:43] individually he'll put you in trouble
[15:45] collectively he'll put you in trouble so
[15:49] thank God for the prayer warriors I my
[15:51] my my my my tongue study prayer warriors
[15:54] because my god the pasta cannot do it
[15:58] alone
[15:59] he has his part to play he will get the
[16:01] word of the Lord he will point it he
[16:04] will point you in a certain direction
[16:06] because if God shows him this is the
[16:08] direction to go he will point you but he
[16:10] can't carry you you have to realize that
[16:14] you gotta make the steps you gonna walk
[16:17] in that direction you gotta fight you
[16:20] gotta press you gonna when trouble comes
[16:23] what do you do you bend your knees you
[16:27] pray or cry out on to God amen

[1:24:48] abounded to us toward us in all wisdom
[1:24:51] and prudence having made known unto us
[1:24:54] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:24:56] good pleasure which he hath purposed in

[1:25:01] fullness of times he might gather
[1:25:03] together in one all things in Christ
[1:25:05] both which are in heaven and which are

[1:30:29] Celsius but you can't measure coldness
[1:30:31] call this only happens when there's no
[1:30:34] more heat it's not darkness could only
[1:30:38] appear when there's no more light

[1:50:40] well hallelujah
[1:50:43] one more time I'm getting rid of clothes
[1:50:46] mrs. musicians to get ready Samson
[1:50:53] can't help but think about something
[1:50:56] right now
[1:50:57] Samson lost his eyes sometimes when a
[1:51:00] pitiful condition
[1:51:02] Samson look terrible you'd have felt
[1:51:05] sorry for Samson if he was living in his
[1:51:08] day because he was a mighty man in his
[1:51:10] time but this wasn't that time now now
[1:51:14] he was betrayed and how he was piqued
[1:51:17] forgotten he was almost forsaken
[1:51:19] holidays now arrived in a terrible
[1:51:22] condition
[1:51:23] Samson an almighty remembered his glory
[1:51:25] days how he lifts up the gates of Gaza
[1:51:28] and pack them up on a hill such was the
[1:51:31] glory of God upon Samson and Samson was
[1:51:34] up wasn't a big Hulk fellow he was not
[1:51:37] man in big muscles he was like a TBT
[1:51:39] fellow who looked like everybody else
[1:51:41] but when the spirit of the law come upon
[1:51:44] Samson with his seven locks with the
[1:51:48] Covenant that he kept he could do great
[1:51:50] things he could move mountains halal is
[1:51:53] not right he could beat the Philistines
[1:51:56] runnin with the jawbone of an ass he was
[1:51:59] powerful when he was in the hands of God
[1:52:03] isn't that right but he mess around and
[1:52:08] gotten the wrong crowd and ended up
[1:52:10] messed up ended up looking forsaken had
[1:52:14] his head shaven challah is not right but
[1:52:18] I believe Samson remember the Covenant
[1:52:19] because sometimes waiting for a specific
[1:52:22] time for him to make his move he was in
[1:52:26] that prison but he knew that did that
[1:52:28] they stood there was a chance there was
[1:52:31] an opportunity and when he put his hair
[1:52:33] back and he felt those locks growing
[1:52:36] back he knew that there is a possibility
[1:52:39] there's a possibility for change there's
[1:52:42] a possibility for Carter to once more
[1:52:44] what he did before
[1:52:47] one smaller quarter to it once more a
[1:52:51] quarter fill a cottage seal that God to
[1:52:54] deliver that God to restore the clock at
[1:52:56] backlash nakaka change

[1:53:01] for such a time as this
[1:53:03] once more Lord hallelujah the devil to
[1:53:11] Delilah was planning for Samson I went
[1:53:14] to devil God Samson it seemed like it
[1:53:16] never stopped his planet but Samson's
[1:53:19] got to plan know how he was gonna get
[1:53:21] back at the enemy how he was gonna
[1:53:24] avenge the enemy for all I took place in
[1:53:26] his life
[1:53:27] Samson hallelujah and know exactly what
[1:53:29] he was going to do what he was waiting
[1:53:30] waiting for those locks to grow back
[1:53:32] with it boys covenant to be restored
