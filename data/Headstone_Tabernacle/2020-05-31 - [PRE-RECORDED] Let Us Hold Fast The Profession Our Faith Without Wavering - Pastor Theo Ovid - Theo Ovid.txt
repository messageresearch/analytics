since eight seventeen and I'm grateful to God for that I know that our lives have purpose behind it and this is the key thing to come to that spot where you really begin to have an interest in purpose not just purpose from a general perspective but purpose for your life and regardless of a mechanic's teacher lawyer whatever because of what status you in you have to still dig deeper to find out the purpose of God for your life because the end the end game ever use that word is that we really become witnesses of him in whatever capacity in whatever job status at the end of it all is not just for you to be safe in church because God could have said stays safe in heaven and say Adam or you fall next contestant let me get a new era New Eden says safe in heaven he decided calm down himself and seek after Adam and go after Adam and bring back Adam by blood this is what God's love is all about there is no one higher and greater and better than we all are what we are by the grace of God God

[Music] [Music] özil [Music] [Music] and their Bibles Elena turn to Psalms 91 we want to look at verse 1 2 7 Matthew chapter 6 wanna read from verse 5 to 15 and Hebrews 10 from verse 19 to 25 Psalms 91 who's 1 to 7 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler from noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a Thousand shall fall that I write as I side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Matthew chapter 6 Riaan from verse 5 a window Perez thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for the love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the streets corners of the streets that they may be seen of men very nice unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayers enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and when you pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen and for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses final scripture Hebrews chapter 10 I want to read from verse 19 to 25 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an High Priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for his feet for that promise and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your kindness we thank you for your spirit on your presence and we invite you to come into your world and breathe upon us Lord afresh speak to our hearts and may our lives be transformed but this be a transformational service Lord that the people would leave different from how they came they leave clues are drawn to you wrapped up in your love covered by your blood and caught up in the token granted father in Jesus name I ask it email an email you may be seated a little context rapture like to read from second chronicles chapter 5 you could find it if you want to second chronicles chapter 5 and I want to just read something from there you love him this morning it's always a blessing to be in the house of God David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of God don't stay home get out the church hallelujah praise the name of the Lord all right from second Chronicles after 5 when they look at verse 4 you have your fibres and the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the ark and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that when the tabernacle Di's did the priests and the Levites bring up also King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto Him before the ark sacrifice sheep and oxen which could not be told non numbered for multitude and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into its place like that me read it again verse 7 and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into his place to the Oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark and the cherubims cover the ark and establish their of above and they draw the stars of the ark on the ends of the styles was seen from the ark before the Oracle but he was not seen without and there is under this day there was nothing in the Ark save the two tables which Moses put Devin in or when the Lord made a covenant with the chin of Israel when they came out of Egypt and they came to pass when the priests will come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present was sanctified and did not then wait by course also the Levites which were the singers all of them of Asaf of human of jetson with their sons and their brethren been arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps to the east end of the altar with them a hundred and twenty priests solid with trumpets it came even to pass as the trumpeters and the singers were as one to make one song to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endures forever then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand the minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled a house may God bless his word oh praise the name of the world this morning our title let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering of a subject the meetin please the to pull closet as my subject of meat and place the to pull closet and have an inspiration look on this Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so we in here to get something from the Lord this morning the hallelujah praise God so Berta Branham on a messaging interval he was seen I find that among most Christians I hear to see it that way that most people have professed Christianity seem to have a hard struggling time to hold on and I believe it's a lack of correct teaching of the Bible there's no such thing of holding on the whole Christian principle is based upon rest common to me all that our labor and heaven leaden and I will give you a rest you don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting it's a giver as you enter into a peace that the whole thing is finished Oh hallelujah finish isn't that right then who we call it justified and who he justify he already glorified that just happened to be the word that happened to be what God said who he foreknew he called who we call it justified and who is justified he already glorified that's settled already you can change that hallelujah isn't that right you see a man say I went seeking God no man ever sought God man don't seek God God seeks man isn't that right God went to a Tigana it is an Adam Adam where Dow but the problem he said is intellectual faith but the faith the real faith comes from the heart Oh hallelujah so that's the faith that have people up and down and in and out us intellectual faith but the real faith is from the heart brings core that's inside or glory to God are you with me so he said God told Moses to get some of the golden OMA which is a manner right and take it into the holiest of Holies that it could be kept true generation to come no they could touch the manor they could eat the manna but it only lasted for one day the next day the manna couldn't work but the one and the Holies of Holies that was fresh all the time it wasn't what it was it was where it was it was in a place Oh hallelujah a place that God prepared a place that had Shekinah a place that had glory and once you are put in that place the manner is fresh the world is fresh the whole scripture is fresh the message remains fresh not because of what it is but where it is okay the lot some praises people hallelujah hallelujah without the Shekinah it could be still to some it could be normal to some it could be ordinary your Sun but with the Shekinah it's everything that you need or praise and him alone are you with me praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah so this Tabernacle is in three parts isn't that right it's done right justification certification and the Holy Ghost he's talking about a great tabernacle the manna fell outside the courts the people eat this manner but God told him to tick up the manner and put some in a holy place in the Ark and God prophesied to the Prophet I will write my laws in their hearts I will put them in the tablets of their heart praise be to Jesus we're gonna jump a little bit he said new heart I'll give you I'm a new spirit I will give you he said that spirit that new spirit is so it can agree with God's Spirit because the spirit some people have they can't agree with itself they can email have fellowship with your neighbor so gonna give you a new spirit first a new heart to give you a heart to watch God oh you want a party you want a dance you wanna go to fetch you smoke you wanna drink please good and gautama give you a new heart you can't explain it you want to go to church wanna read your Bible you want to get baptized you want to get a breakthrough God give you a new heart I have to watch God the snake is still there the thing that Cornelison is still there but at least your heart change you're on your way don't let the devil lie to you you're on your way you've gotta finish with your yet but you're on your way he sells you have he'll give you a new spirit I'll give you then I put my spirit my holy spirit into your new spirit I'm gonna give you something that you didn't have before oh come on I'll preach back to me somebody caught promise hat or do you believe that Oh hallelujah praise God praise God Barham says I'm gonna put a new spirit in them I said you want to give you a new spirit don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit cause you and your condition you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband hallelujah can't get along with your neighbor how are you gonna get along with God I'm not hearing you can I get quiet on that one if you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband ho you're gonna get along with God that's why Jesus said could of God who you can see and the kind of your bridge is you in French I praise God and God loved you that He gave His only begotten Son and God came after you and you have trouble loving the Brethren who do you think you are or get a lot of shout in the house oh we had a man on fire this morning we had was woman on fire this morning hallelujah she puts a new spirit on you give you a new spirit and you out like a new faith then he puts the Holy Spirit in you and that's the matter with the people that they they don't want to get shut off from the world you want to be contact with who's next to pop a little in Hollywood watch on the outside the man who live in there in the courts never went to the first altar he lit by the light of the Sun so the outer court sunshine moon nighttime in out up he's called he's in the environment but he's in the outside court isn't that right the next place was the holy place seven kind of six sometimes the light goes out up and down in and out I've like no like feeling me pressed down up and down but there's a place beyond the holy place howl doesn't feel between the holy place in that place there is a place I'm convinced of that Abram was looking for a city whose maker and villain Abraham knew praise calling ahead of last week that there's a real place hallelujah city whose meta and builder is Cordero pants [Applause] and in the spirit realm there is a place that we can find that we can hide under the shadows of the mighty a secret place Oh glory to God god help us this morning hallelujah hallelujah he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadows of the Almighty we have to find that place more than ever more than ever you can't build bricks and hide what's coming oh my he said millions will die millions of Christians so-called will die who become atomic from a father for this age just material for the atomic power to blow up and destroy millions gonna die there is no way out except up so I hope this message lift you up and raise you up in your faith what's good - it would not waver Oh glory to God hallelujah and that you will hold on hold fast the profession of your feet without wavering because ports enter 20 century profit to give us light to know how to walk such a time as this all kind of demon power Strider er the fate that God has released but when the son of man commits we find it and I say yes you're gonna find fit you're gonna find faith and a bride you're gonna find faith enough people or chlorine ago when the son of my comment he's gonna find faith inside of you you believe that hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God my if you walk into little fellowship with a church that's the seven golden candlesticks I like that he identified church-going as up up to that level seven golden candlesticks which sometimes the light goes out but watch this you still have smoke it is green it is cloud it is and when the light was out the lamps smoked up the experience you see miss drones over there who suppose the Christian do something that wasn't right you say oh I wonder if there's anything to it you still got your eyes on on Miss Jones see you still walk in my activation light but the man who walked in behind the holiest of Holies it didn't matter whether the sunshine or not it didn't matter whether the candles burn or not he lives in the Shekinah glory that takes to be under Church ages that you beyond seven you don't hear what I'm saying that just use a number eight oh boy did you get that can you get that first it's the outer court then there's that place with seven golden candlesticks where where something the cameras go out but there's a place beyond that I'm missing please hallelujah praise God a place that got to talk to you and that's not doing a pastor come on I'll give the Lord a show that's not new the elder with the Deacon has nothing but to do with who is sitting in front of you next to you behind you that's nothing to do with that [Applause] minowaman is what men a woman me today after you've been brought into the kingdom of God is a hidden life men and women who will get with Christ and let the Christians drop her on them you don't care what the world see them this is what I want to see I want to see people that don't care what the will see because I see the world don't care what anybody see they do what they want to do when they want to do it how they want to do it so what about you praise God you can praise God any way any time because shout when you want you can praise God you could amen amen you could be a genuine Christian come on now come on you could span yes you could hold fast your profession without wavering let them enroll let them talk I will not be moved [Applause] what the church needs today is a hidden consecrated life you can't be deterred Adeline with the world impersonation acting like them hidden Christ cause you're trying to fashion after the world you're trying to live at the next church you're trying to belong to a better organization you're trying to wear better clothes that don't comply with Christianity Christianity is a sacrificed life a lot of people don't want that word sacrifice but it is if any might want to follow me Lenin so said mother bear of Sodom that up his cross and follow me dearly he never just say come he's a Hall across take a price because it cost [Applause] [Music] Christianity is a sacrificed life hidden life but got you quite sealed by the Holy Ghost that's what a real Christian life consists of watch not how well you can do this not how well you can sing not how well you can preach that's fine but that isn't it you see we say Amen but that is it yet you know I'm a deacon wisdom I'm a preacher what is that I'm a dis I'm a duck what is that that has nothing to do with anything because give and Colin are without

the churches you're gonna find out more about it as we go forward first seal then all the judgment of the evildoers you see down to the ages as the seals has been breaking you see people didn't know it was breaking the ages were unfolding without any open view of it breaking our seals but the reality was every it sees us breaking messenger coming out people coming out living out dying is open is cruising it open big fallen it's unfolding and God promised to reveal the whole thing at the end time so when it bring brother branham but around come and said look on this look what happened this age look on that age look on that age looked on that age here we are so we can look back and see God's pattern and he's on phone and revelation and its purpose for his people all these evil doers of the seven seals has been working mysterious in the church and it should be not oppositional in the church evil doers I will find out there Milland they even work in the name of a church they call themselves the church no wonder I have been so against denomination not knowing why the city nomination spirit is what gets people in the group that the group becomes their voice so they are silenced by group teaching group testimonies group anointing but when Jesus died this same in a veil that was hiding the most holy place God rented from the top to the bottom the shore is no longer priesthood could go inside idea but whosoever will have access to disk I know it has to be a pastor to get it you don't have to be like elder to get it it'll have to be a deacon to get it whoever will can have access the Shekinah glory where the mother stays fresh in your life in your heart or give the Lord some princess people so there was no man worthy to look upon the book because this book me because in this book this book like this because in this book was the book of redemption say there was a book in the book don't forget that know his own name was in there nobody was busy sober I'm praying there God we are willing to take this book we are not good we are unworthy to take this book into our hearts and we read in the scriptures no man was in heaven or beneath it was willing to take it and only the Lamb that I mean slain he talked about for he was worthy he lives the scenes around and we are looking to him this morning to reveal these contexts that's written in the book because it is the book of redemption all that is redeemed is written Aaron that is redeemed is written in so as Isaac preached we read the voice of one crime the wilderness were when got lucky see John we read a virgin shall conceive but when God look you see Mary isn't that right so when we read scriptures but God see names so every name written for this age is in the book so when the mighty angel came up with the book open he came down with your name in it that should make you shout and scream because John was weeping when the book was closed John was weeping John was crying I'm John rejoice when the lamb came and took the book know for you to hear that that lamb not only take the book not even open a book but he brought down the book nobody have to book on the earth and the mystery of God come strong from God as the world of God your name is coming up afterward and as he received the word you receive him a revelation of your very name come on come on now so you do you understand what happened woman of the well she didn't know any my notebook she didn't have no understanding of that or she knows she struggled to mind the children and she's sleeping with this one and that one and that one and Jesus had to pass there to call out the corner out not further stay in that condition to call out he come to say woman you do belong there woman you have a higher calling woman you have a higher life woman you can break out and break into come on somebody the devil only trap you who the son of man set free come on I'll have meat wishes is [Music] [Applause] and Jesus Jesus bust her out and she ran

when you get so hot it makes just stand up and make your show and make you want to dance and make it want to be some kind of jig glory that woman run and said come see a man who told me all that I did she was embarrassed she wasn't ashamed she was privileged to have light shine on the seed that was in her soul she said that he knew that quadratus Eden I thought a cutie dumped inside a stroller why she was a sinner when she was born she had it she always had it she couldn't get rid of it she couldn't take it all they couldn't operate and take it out it belongs to her it was her Oh pummelled is alone [Applause] you can be lost if you try ok the loss of praises mm er occurrence hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a shout [Applause] all right how about givers if I make my bed in hell he's here

gonna be it my back I want to bring back your joy the joy is your strength the joy of the Lord is your strength bring back your joy [Applause] bully [Applause] Oh you may be seated don't let nobody shake you off the faith the profession of your faith this endtime message is true it is Tashia the Lord Oh glory to God listen listen listen listen you talk about hidden mysteries who in this world what theologian could come and say Abraham faith Isaac lung check upgrades to perfection nobody else could do that I take a prophet to come and reveal that watch watch watch but a Branham breaking the seals hidden mysteries he belongs bigger justification Sarah stratification and when I thought Mary was the word he said Mary is Pentecostal shock I'm Jesus is the word this is real man the brief what the Messiah or you don't you know what I'm still [Applause] do you get that it was he here I was not mistake it was part of God's program justification sanctification Mary because but she produced Christ the web [Applause] so God you may be seated so God had us to reveal that the shock only covers and protects the seed until the seed get mature and right so good written for your faith to get ripe to cross the mystery of who you are where you come from who is we're going who your dental is and you cannot be defeated because when God told the Prophet pick up your pen and write nothing will defeat this pray that's the same guarantees in Joshua every place you put your foot is yours no man shall be able to stand before thee [Applause] listen in Hammond on it you're about to do it you're about to put your foot in the devil's neck yes yes yes you are both to put your foot under Kings hand that's what you're about to do don't just look at me [Applause] [Applause] we proceeded it's something you may be seated it's something when you begin to compensate destiny and purpose okay look at Esther Esther was chosen and she's listing the Mordecai and she's doing a thing and doing her stuff and Mordecai knows do and everything else he recognized him and gonna fight because he's not taken on him and he might want that highfalutin Maury kind of giving him that he wanted me worship and thing like that and when human and Mordecai recognized that judgment Collins commented the Jews he tell Queen Esther I said you gotta do something you got to do something no she can sell gone I cannot fight it you know the rules Italy lost you got going on as you can call you but there was a place where the king was active and he alone could could give a difference to what was happening isn't that right so she come to a spot when she recognized her purpose her destiny whatever this is whatever it is such a time as this what what all this all this drama all this unfolding is to put you in the position to be trusted could I get us the SoCal shout glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Esther Esther walk up to the king for perish I perish what I'm gonna do I want Dunphy's we go talk she got say this and that no she right here she won t right training so when she leave the king the King trouble shall pour the rinsing because she I tell him what she want yet the King is troubled he can't sleep what about setting up things the King can sleep so he tell wise man saturated Chronicles for me start to read what going over the kingdom and the king the man's had to read and then he come up with Mahdi chi-o-matic I save the king it was anything done for Monica [Applause] you yourself caught the springs tress gorgeous Vince chess bring all can oppress to put things in position for is on on Tory we know the story when he a man come we can say what shall I do for the man that the King won to honor him on ting cos him so he come up with his fresh on the best horse of this the best ride has to be brand new everything else and he can monkey streets and let the people do this now if you say all this talk he said do enough of Modi guy Jesus say when invited to the table take the lowest seat lease you assume you big up and you take a high seat and somebody better than you come on the other senior back down basically take the lowest seat and let them promote you because the man that got promote the terror can demote when God put his touch I see they could say what the what nobody could touch that oh this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous give a lot some praises [Applause] all right let's blow a beeper now it's gonna further stand the gap but a brenell speaking about June 8th brother Jackson he had a dream he's a Methodist minister he told me a dream a dream there was a long grassy hill water I'd wash up the top of the soil it become ball on the top of a mountain then in this rock was a funny rating and I was standing there with all the brethren around the church here interpreting this writing and then become a time that I got it all interpreted that I got a hold of a crowbar like angle bar or angled by a pry bar and cut the top of the mountain out and lifted it up and on the inside of it was a white rock something on the order of granite some white rock that wasn't written on and I said stay here look in on this and while they will all look in I slipped out among them started going west I'm gonna Jackson said he saw me going up a hill I got in smaller and smaller he said well the interpretation of course was given here in the church and I believe the full revelation yet is true the age of looter and Wednesday and John Smith and different ones that preached on the Bible then we got over in the Bible and showed where the seven angels message at the song of the seminal message all the message of God would be made known then come seven mysterious thunders now if it's at the end age we are living in we have come to justifications and vacation signs wonders prophecy healing we have lots of impersonation we have people get up and try to act like Christians and and life don't compare there's something wrong their fruits may push your know them never jump a hair higher and you live we find out as I told you the interpretation on the rock on the rock is Christ that was the brother's dream and all these years the Bible has been interpreted till we have an ecclesiastical intubation true but the last gift added to the loud is an age which seven angels message watch del I watch like Luther pre justification he gonna come and explain it away he let it run while Luther never organized the church we're never on as a church and so forth those man reformers didn't live long enough to get it all together John Smith brought back water baptism any Muslim but her titles many of those things were left loose but when it come down to the end here we go the last message is supposed to straighten that all up and bring these things to one fate one Lord one baptism which we know is another Ephesians so after the Bible is interpreted you notice I open up the top of a pyramid like Rock not pyramid teacher now watch but however it was in the shape of a pyramid the cap on the pyramid was never put on the cap never did come because it was the cornerstone the cap was disguised as the cornerstone in the early church it was the cornerstone but in the full church it's the headstone so it never did come it was rejected ya know and it will come prophecy so this headstone was disguised as the cornerstone of the early church because upon this cornerstone what Bill seven ages to bring us back to this age which is the capstone age now Lisa ends it and we break into that slot called Holy Spirit slot - the headstone is not right so I believe that there's a church we're coming to a place from just a tional luta sound occasion on the Wesley and the Pentecostal message will bring the church in such a minority and her ministry will be among those people exactly the same Ministry of Jesus Christ oh my my mind so here we go he said now watch because he didn't come in the first watch they went to sleep second watch in the seven watch and the seven angels message when he come all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps Presbyterian Baptist with a born of the Spirit of God shall go in the rapture and I believe here we go that the bride will be call out during that time that's why I say the brightest - because we're only holding on but the time coming for the landowner gentle with us same power same signs in wonders you can't expect to go no under your family still out set something after begin to move up on you that will get your family to see to come inside also because this is the last our Android on the next generation coming along it don't have no next messenger coming on the bride will be the final to the final that is what you are there is no other prophet coming there is no other messenger coming hollow the Prophet the messenger the Prophet on the bride will be saying the same thing [Applause] and so much as you notice by the Jackson dream there was no writing on this rock on the inside that's what I went west for nineteen sixty two hundred contests what a bad name is prayin make us fit servants forgive our pasts bless our future guide us Oh Lord I mighty hand Jehovah bless these ministers here bless the lady all the visitors a be with us Lord we are your servants we give yourself ourselves wholly to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence is in our life you know being help us God forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty violence of the faith mighty warriors of the faith and here he is prophesying in prayer open this year Lord that hidden manna that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God so brother Branham knew that the rock beneath the rock he take a proba and break off the capstone as it was there was white rock there there was something dear that we could see the program of God so the revelation of that rock is to show you the program of God then he went deeper DISA tap off the pyramid of our life who know what he was talking about back there who I prune back there to know what he is talking about faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience he said cap off the pyramid of our life put the capstone Christ Jesus upon each one of us means great Manek magnificent holy blessing be upon us may the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us Metapod resurrection be manifested how we thank you tonight we are yours and serious this is a time he said might be closer than you think it got me scared I haven't done enough time shall be no more your noxious time is over what happens now if that is so then the permanence kept by the seven thunders you remember the freedom message it's a capstone wanted to do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it notice he's not my church he's armored group the Holy Spirit caps off the individual and seal it when we added off it registers in Ghana some theaters of what we kept adding until we get seven things and the seven one was love which is God that's how he makes the individuals he caps him and seals them with the Holy Spirit if that be so then that individual of 78 ages that he had seven minutes treatment ministries that's underway and they fought for to bring back and the head stone from the Capitol they fought to do what let me fought to bring it back because the early church had to seven virtues in them they had seven voices in them they had seven thunders in them that Christ in them and as the church began to fall away the others were fighting to bring it back what do you think you have to do you have to fight to bring it back bring back the altar in your home bring back the prayer in your life bring back the Holy Ghost upon your soul you have to fight say fight say hello to fight you have to fight to bring it back or give the Lord the brezza offering [Applause] so in in since this name is for my dream dream then notice in some mysterious way we picked it out in the air shaft tool open the top there was white cry night it was interpreted there was no letters and I set the present look on this hallelujah look on this until it fully unfold look on all these promises that you have I'll never leave your nerve for a second why don't you look on that look at the healing virtue look at strength instead of you have reason and Haga no work on why don't you say the Lord my fortress I came when I put my trust or look on these promises hallelujah and I stood there a little bit until the Holy Spirit revealed it and said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man - justification sonification the battle only goes but in Jesus name all these have been revealed but there is secrets that is hid inside because the Bible see with seven seals I must go and find it and that morning when those seven angels come down and blast the earth rocks flew everywhere seven angels stood there and said return back to Jacksonville from where you come from for the seven seals of the seven message will be open and today your understanding serpent seed if God's willing will understand the correctness of margin divorce all these things that God has open every seal the mysteries since the foundation of the world it be up and enjoy the presence of the blessing oh my hallelujah this is all interpreted according to his dream is all finished according to God's Word the seven messenger will finish and then the seven thunders saw the capstone all over praise the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus you love him give the Lord some praises [Applause] so I believe this is one of the hidden mysteries that God brought out and I want to bring this for you here brother Brian are you talking about I believe when a man is born in the world when you're a little baby born in the world you could not have been here without been in the foreknowledge of God because infinity knows all things now if he ever going to have life there is another something in there in the child and he come too soon our little that the seed is in him if you got eternal life tonight if we are eternal life then we always will because there was only one form eternal life we always were the reason we were is because we were part of God and God is the only thing that is eternal so what he's doing you know he's bringing a deeper revelation that you just been a sinner saved by grace [Applause] did you yera [Applause] he's bringing a mystery to show the real thing like my jeddak received tights from Abraham and it was a lot of his grandson Levi wasn't even born yet and the Bible said Levi get tight in Abraham Myron feels good this morning because Claude was able to look down and see the sees coming damaged Oh missed it there is no he's not coming there's no he can

always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was in the book of life was put there before the from vision world he knew what you were I am only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might take away the fear and the scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now are we the sons [Applause] you see it have a scripture that not we will be but no we are the activities as powerful as the world itself because because the world was expressed so the attribute the attribute and God is just as real the tree wasn't gone stinking but the tree was not an attribute because the tree is temporary but you you are not you you you and I'm saying this morning you are a tribute of his thinking [Music] when when God had you in a stinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's and you know how to be with God before they're before he even become material it before he become a Tillett you were deer that's why we were locked up in Christ that's right when he died we died that's why we are buried we were buried a rainy arose order the

you've been a sinner many of you can fellowship with me tonight and on this Court when you were a boy or little girl you'd walk around there will be certain things that were just it wouldn't bother other kids it seemed like this something you cried out there was God somewhere you yet you were sinner though what was that that was a little form of life in you then it was always so that's why Jesus to bravely say all that the father had given me welcome Jesus I said oh good you think go come father what I worry about Andrew oh god Philip I cannot fight no Jess wasn't then he said Peter come and something in Peter normally was yet suffering as Peter said Ellen and you a man all the ornithologists tunnel there were always sons the Holy Ghost don't make a son because you are son [Applause] come on ooh come on now the Holy Ghost don't make us and that's really Jason because your son go to the failure where the Holy Ghost give the Lord a shout [Applause] let me see if I can roll this ball

breaks and the children he take his hands wash your body he take your hands off your family that's what we talking about and man surrender to God is omnipotent [Applause] hallelujah iossef shelters in the house no man called you cause you you are called of God [Applause] Florine you'll be seated after a while you've heard the gospel you went to church you pickle-dish you went from the nomination to

down it has to be going to choose that he's already chosen it oh praise God I'm gonna hit the home stretch yeah alright this is bottom 10 vision I want to listen to this when I was sat down I was Bonita and standing above her the great tent I never seen such a tent and I made an altar core see my god only altar people weakened hundreds of people and then a real kind gentleman went walk on a platform and said wild Burmese rested moments we call the prayer line I noticed the prayer line and when I wrong from the tent and I looked I was standing on the platform and there was a small building about 12 feet across 20 foot long and I stood at that and I seen them bring a lady up on a stretcher there was a lady taking a name on a paper and there was someone come push up through and the next one came to it crutches and I went and he went to this little building and only outside the lady come out screaming at the top of voice pushing the stretcher the other lady said what happened I don't know I couldn't tell the man was sick and paralyzed I know he is leaping and jumping when he come into this little room and notice clothes there's a difference between the angel of the Lord and that light because I heard something moving as it does when it comes on the platform at night I kind of like a white fire whipping around and it went over the top of the audience here we go and I went down and she stood over the top of that building and settling on the top of it and when it did this one standing by me the same voice the angel voice says I will meet you in dia and this is the third pool so this light went the rest of the room the angel by the Prophet says I will meet you in there that is the third pole but nobody would know nothing about it I said I don't understand why in there my dear he said it will not be a public show I don't I said I don't understand going into that closet then the angel gave him a scripture that's what we read today he said is it not written by our Lord when doe prayers be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who sees in secret and he who sees in secret shall reward me openly and I said I understand and he took me into this place and set me down in this room where I was act and then he told me what to do the 2-time Christian friends when I leave this world that will still be in my bosom what a vision that is where I got the torte from could pull closet hallelujah because you see everything has to be in the word alright from the Seventh Seal I'm on the horse - now he says the holy spirit stood between me and God he don't know nothing about it is speaking he said know what remember Satan will try to impersonate everything that the church will do notice true the Antichrist but this is one thing kind of person it there is no mimics to it because he don't know it there is no way for him to know it it's the temple he don't know nothing about it next words he doesn't understand it Oh hallelujah so the vision I seen the light leave me go into that building and the voice suddenly I'll meet you in there that would be the truthful why it wouldn't be a public show I want to identify five things wherever I'm says it eatable and each one of those things have a scripture connected with it first the one we read was a ten vision he connected Matthew 6:6 when opreis and tonight closet when I shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward you openly he said the third Pole as a spoken word scriptures in McCallum 23 if you shall say to this mountain be movin don't talk in your heart but believe those things which you see at Chuck on the pass she'll have what survey said he said the third pull as the Kings sword scriptures in John 15:7 if he abadan me I was abiding you that's what you will he shall be done unto you Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper - its sword he said a third polish the open of this world the Scriptures scripture Luke 24 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded in the scriptures things concerned himself Luke 24 45 then open here understand into the scriptures that they might understand the scriptures the fifth thing sores in prison first Peter 3:18 for Christ also had once suffered for sins - just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited listen or while the ark was preparing we're in a few issues were save so if this is the triple then a great ministry is lying ahead for us oh my inclusion but a bottom says how about to meet the Sun gets stronger every day is get stronger and finally witness Lee in there it will go to take in life so first the sweetest green Shaka's green you don't know who is who but then the pressure come the heat come to bake the shout underwrite in the wheat green then the wreath goes on to take in life and after a while it becomes stronger and the green should be maturing and getting stronger as the Sun becomes stronger every day and that should be your testimony Luther's mana will not work for Methodist Methodist mana wouldn't work for Pentecost Pentecostal mana would work for the day it got to come fresh Luther's mana messages vacation where these message was sonification the Pentecost about the restoration of the gifts but this is introduced in the headstone the last day the bride tree so therefore this seventh under revelation or inspiration was supposed to be cuss out and get us out of a fleshly shock ways that we could become vessels of honor unto God question and answers sound vacation is when your name goes on the book as a believer oh my Kelly's question if we were saved we were what we said before the from day in the world yes Russian 13 it says you were saved and your your name was put in lamb Book of Life before the world was ever created then he could the scripture Ephesians 1 according as he has chosen us in him before from this in the world that we should be holy before him before we love and so on were we spirits then no we were nothing then but in course in mind we were and his pocket and materialized it how many know that Jesus that years was the lamb slain for the phone in the world God book it and it was good as finished and when he saw me he saw you before the foundation of the world we are only figurative in his mind and he come to the world we were bought man one male and female and got separated in man and female spirit isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord we almost did someone asked me to repeat the Hebrew word again enjoy the second chapter and that form and a serene the word former is more e-ma you re each which means teaching in other words it will be a teaching ring and a harvest raining he says now watch the first rain is when you plant the seed and that stature cup growing then before it matures there's another crop that's what they call harvest rain we know the rain we find out was the spirit so we are still waiting on that ring isn't that right he said the former rain coming over the latter in his past Jew it slapped over and together the former rain and the Lateran together the Holy Spirit made what the foreman Lateran together the Holy Spirit made manifest by the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ that is the former in la serena together the holy spirit not more talk not more mysteries and more revelations but the holy spirit made manifest is not right blessed be the name of the Lord okay here we go I'm going to visit you from this era the latter rain is fixin to fall you have held that seed in there long enough no believe in you're looking for that coming son and he is coming the body carriers all the works carries all the works and does the

Spirit do right if the crop in the last days the Holy Spirit were pulled in time in the last days to bring the latter in the real rain they are trying to manufacture lighter rain nonsense the latter rain will sweep across the world brother hallelujah we are seeing former in so in words watch here we go that's right are you ready I'm closing listen carefully cut this delimit president is now you

won't be able to open your mouth that is when he'll come that is when he will show that is when you will see Doreen Lee still be quiet let it go the Prophet already prophesied of a close down this message they will shut the door but he said the rain is gonna fall that's only gonna show and I redefined our quote God from deceived from the world send us another Church before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the Spirit marked 16 can follow the church acts 2:4 will be following right along with the church signs wonders accompanied apostles
