[28:37] Amen. Psalms chapter 46 says, "God is
[28:39] our refuge and strength,
[28:42] a very present help in trouble.
[28:46] Therefore will not we fear, though the
[28:50] earth be removed, and though the
[28:52] mountains be carried into the midst of
[28:55] the sea,
[28:57] though the waters thereof roar and be
[28:59] troubled, though the mountains shake
[29:01] with the swelling thereof, Silla,
[29:05] there is a river. Amen.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; The streams thereof shall make glad the
[29:09] city of God, the holy place of the
[29:13] tabernacles of the most high. God is in
[29:16] the midst of her and she shall not be
[29:19] moved. God shall help her and that right
[29:24] early. The heathen raged, the kingdoms
[29:28] were moved. He uttered his voice and the
[29:32] earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with
[29:36] us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[29:40] Sailor, may God add blessing to the
[29:43] reading of his word. Let us bow our
[29:45] heads together as we pray to him
[29:48] tonight.

[29:55] glory. You reign above all the heavens
[29:58] and above all the earth. You are a
[30:00] mighty king tonight. There is nothing
[30:03] that we can do without you, Lord Jesus.
[30:06] We are helpless, Lord Father, and our
[30:09] hearts are crying out for you. Father,
[30:13] won't you come this evening, Lord, and
[30:15] help your needy children, Father? Be our
[30:18] rod, be our staff, Lord, be our lamp
[30:22] unto our feet tonight, and show us where
[30:25] to go, Father. For we are much need of
[30:28] you, Lord, in this hour that grows so
[30:30] dark. Bless the people tonight as we
[30:33] come into this place, Lord, to worship
[30:34] and praise you. We pray your presence
[30:37] would come down in a mighty way and
[30:38] bless the service this evening. Bless
[30:41] the songs that we would sing, Lord. May
[30:43] it be a a sweet sound in your ear. And
[30:46] may your blessed word as it come forth
[30:48] tonight, Lord, from your yielded
[30:51] servant. We pray your anointing will
[30:53] come upon him, Father, and bless him,
[30:55] Lord, and take him out of the way. And
[30:57] may the word of God speak, fall upon us
[31:00] like rain. May the fire of God come
[31:03] afterwards and ignite the word and bring
[31:05] it to pass. This is our expectation in
[31:09] this hour, Lord, to see the word made
[31:11] flesh. Grant it almighty God. Have your
[31:13] way tonight. Bless your people as we
[31:16] come into this place for worship in

[53:31] Through it all.
[53:33] Amen. And amen. Amen. And although the
[53:37] song says I've learned, I'm still
[53:39] learning.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we
[53:42] thank you for the opportunity you've
[53:44] given us tonight. And we thank you for
[53:47] precious brother Hov and the church here
[53:49] in Headstone Tabernacle. Truly we feel
[53:52] your presence every time we come. And
[53:55] it's always good Lord when the anointing
[53:57] is there. So father all we have to do is
[53:59] step in and then you would lead because
[54:02] without you we are nothing.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Lord if you don't come then I might as
[54:06] well sit down. And that is why we've
[54:08] been praying. That is why we've been
[54:10] trusting. And that's why we have the
[54:12] faith that you are here
[54:14] &gt;&gt; to bring us into that place where we
[54:16] cannot go cuz you have the eyes, you
[54:19] have the wings, and you have the
[54:21] strength and we have the need. So I pray
[54:24] that you will meet it and you would lead
[54:26] us and satisfy us
[54:29] &gt;&gt; just like you did with Abraham when he
[54:31] was told that you are the double
[54:33] breasted God. El Shad
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Lord. And there something else to have
[54:38] two breasts to suck on at the same time.
[54:41] One on the left, one on the right. When
[54:44] you're tired on the left, you go on the
[54:46] right. Father, we are grateful.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Please Lord,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; have your own way tonight. And we'll not
[54:52] forget to give you the praise, the
[54:54] honor, and the glory in Jesus
[54:56] magnificent name. And all the people
[54:57] say,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; turn around and greet the person next to
[55:01] you.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:05] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:10] Praise God. You can have your seats when
[55:12] you're finished.
[55:15] And it's good to see all of you are here
[55:18] this evening.
[55:20] And I realize that we are in a holiday
[55:24] and usually you know people tend to
[55:26] gravitate to rest.
[55:29] I tried to do that but I got labors
[55:34] and you're like oh brother um Isaac said
[55:36] that labor into your rest I never
[55:38] thought of that so I couldn't say no and
[55:42] when you can't fight the word
[55:44] &gt;&gt; and you cannot break the word to fulfill
[55:46] the word
[55:47] &gt;&gt; so I had no choice but it's good to be
[55:50] here because brother and I go back a
[55:52] while and since in the days of brother
[55:54] Mio who introduced me to him and I love
[55:57] He's a real man of God.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And I think as a church here, you should
[56:03] be real happy.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; I usually, you know,
[56:09] when I'm home, I am not, you know,
[56:13] preachers funny. We get funny ways. And
[56:16] I normally don't tune into a lot of
[56:18] preachers because I don't want to have
[56:21] bad thoughts,
[56:24] especially these days. So to avoid bad
[56:27] thoughts, I choose my battles
[56:30] &gt;&gt; and I choose who I listen to because the
[56:32] amount of voices they have over there
[56:34] today, you're wondering what's going on.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I know it's in the end time and it's
[56:39] difficult and that is why I choose my my
[56:43] battles. So the ones I choose, I don't
[56:45] have a problem. And before I go further,
[56:48] let me greet the young lady in the back.
[56:50] I've heard of Brother Chandler. I've
[56:52] never met him, but meeting you, it makes
[56:55] us connect. So, God bless you.
[57:01] And let me also greet brother Isaac.
[57:04] Couple times we met coming through
[57:05] Grenada and I always uh admire him and
[57:09] when he preaches I see myself when I was
[57:12] his age and that that brother has had an
[57:16] experience with God. That's my personal
[57:19] take
[57:21] and I've had my own share. We've been on
[57:25] the road. I might look a little older
[57:27] when brother because you take better
[57:29] care of him. But we are same age.
[57:33] And I realized something since I came
[57:35] here in Trinidad. You eat now and worry
[57:38] later.
[57:42] We don't have that pleasure because
[57:43] things home expensive. So while we are
[57:46] buying we have to worry then eat.
[57:50] So we pray that the Lord will bless you
[57:52] all and the musicians you know I don't
[57:55] have that privilege. I have to play and
[57:57] then preach and when I come here and I
[58:00] see all of that my daughter said oh my
[58:02] god could you imagine so I have to see
[58:04] if I can get a labor from here is fair
[58:06] exchange
[58:08] come Grenada and see if you can help us.
[58:11] Amen. So time flies past and when I was
[58:14] here the last time I didn't even have
[58:16] time to give the the um the scripture
[58:18] readings and so on and uh you have had
[58:21] some amazing meetings recently
[58:29] and it puts me in uh the vocative it
[58:32] puts me in a place now what do I do
[58:34] after up there I can't bring it down so
[58:38] you need to help me bring you bring me
[58:40] up
[58:41] &gt;&gt; to where you are so that I can be there
[58:44] at least with my head above water
[58:47] because it was an amazing service
[58:53] and and I heard that brother when he was
[58:56] going he was just gone.
[58:59] real wonderful preacher
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and it's good to see that you know all
[59:03] is not lost but how we still have some
[59:05] men who still have some fire
[59:08] &gt;&gt; because a lot of churches and the
[59:10] message these days while they are
[59:12] speaking you are sleeping
[59:15] so it's and I worry about that because
[59:19] like brother I don't really have time
[59:22] for games when I see what's going on and
[59:25] when we have to deal with demons and
[59:27] devils and spirits And then you have to
[59:29] present a church
[59:31] &gt;&gt; to God.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, those of you who
[59:34] don't know, I worry all the time and I
[59:37] never come here without spending a lot
[59:39] of time before God because one day I
[59:42] have to give an account
[59:44] &gt;&gt; about what I tell you,
[59:45] &gt;&gt; what I tell him and what I tell myself.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; So I take it very seriously and I never
[59:52] ever go and preach or do anything just
[59:56] like that. I spend a lot of time asking
[59:58] him because I am nothing
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; and I don't know about you but I am
[1:00:02] nothing
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; and uh all my and when I'm praying and
[1:00:06] these days the more I pray is the more I
[1:00:08] realize how nothing I am
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; and I go deep down and I say Lord and
[1:00:13] sometimes in my prayer all I'm saying is
[1:00:14] Lord have mercy Lord have mercy Lord
[1:00:17] have mercy and you may say Tim well
[1:00:20] you're a preacher but you see when you
[1:00:22] become a preacher the words open up
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; and you have no excuse I preach a
[1:00:25] message like got no excuse. Though what
[1:00:28] an inexcusable
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; oh man
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; and many times we don't realize we have
[1:00:33] no excuse with all that have been told
[1:00:35] us
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; and I treated very very seriously.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; So I trust that you are praying for me
[1:00:43] that the Lord will help me to stick and
[1:00:45] stay with the word
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; because we must give an account. A lot
[1:00:50] of people now being let loose in the
[1:00:52] pulpit and they are committing a lot of
[1:00:54] damage and I don't want to be one of
[1:00:57] them because when you are gone that's
[1:01:00] when you know who you were
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; what is said about you
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; your legacy is your life
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; and you build your legacy with what how
[1:01:10] you live
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; not so much what you say but how you
[1:01:14] live.
[1:01:16] And I I say that and I want to get into
[1:01:18] it, but I just want to feel a little
[1:01:20] comfortable. You know, you are here. I
[1:01:22] am coming. So help me so I can feel a
[1:01:24] little comfortable and settle in. But I
[1:01:27] was speaking to I'm I I like to observe
[1:01:30] things. I don't only preach, but I like
[1:01:32] to see what I preach and observe people
[1:01:34] and observe things and observe myself.
[1:01:37] And I was speaking to someone in the
[1:01:38] message and I was trying to reconcile
[1:01:41] what they were saying. She said at one
[1:01:43] time they were told forsake not the
[1:01:45] assembling of yourselves together and
[1:01:47] now they are told that pass but the
[1:01:50] Bible didn't change
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; and they had difficulty with that and
[1:01:54] then they were told you must um have
[1:01:57] communion and feet washing and so on.
[1:01:59] Now they told another story. Now these
[1:02:02] are serious things
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; because he said you cannot add neither
[1:02:06] can you take
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; and especially he's not so much talking
[1:02:09] to you but he's talking to those that he
[1:02:12] has given the charge
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; to bring the word to the people.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And I don't know what's wrong with
[1:02:18] people today but I fear God.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I fear God so much that I would rather
[1:02:24] wait than be presumptuous.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I am afraid. He is wonderful. But
[1:02:31] there's another side. Same amount of
[1:02:33] love, same amount of legs.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Same amount of love, same amount of
[1:02:39] seriousness.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; God so love and that God is so wrathful.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Everything in him is extreme. There's no
[1:02:47] part. There's no little piece. Is that
[1:02:50] because he's perfect. So you must
[1:02:52] recognize you who are coming here and
[1:02:54] serving the Lord, you're not going to
[1:02:56] walk away
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; cuz every day you get the word,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; it's recorded in your conscience.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't turn it on, it's
[1:03:05] there.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And if you try to ignore it when you are
[1:03:09] dying,
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; God turns it on.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Not you. God turns it on. And then you
[1:03:15] see all those things that you had the
[1:03:17] chance
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; cuz all the labor that we as ministers
[1:03:21] put down is not in vain.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; It will not return void.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And so you need to understand that this
[1:03:29] is not a game.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That this is life and death. And that's
[1:03:33] how God started in the garden
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; and it has not changed.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; So when you come to a church, choose a
[1:03:39] church that gives you the word. But once
[1:03:41] you get that church and you choose that
[1:03:43] church to go to, stay with it until
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; because you need to recognize you will
[1:03:49] be judged
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; by what you know.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; By what you know.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; So God can't judge me if I don't know
[1:03:59] what you know. He will judge me by what
[1:04:01] I know. So to whom much is given, much
[1:04:04] is required. I'm saying all of that so
[1:04:06] you could get a little understanding of
[1:04:07] me because I I kind of different to most
[1:04:10] preachers and I tend to go down
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; and when I come in your house I'm in the
[1:04:15] I'm down in the basement. I like to go
[1:04:17] and check down there because you could
[1:04:19] have a nice looking house but rat
[1:04:20] infested mice infested ants infested and
[1:04:24] it's only when it will give in.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; So I'd like to go down because I like to
[1:04:30] see why we do these things. What causes
[1:04:33] us to behave like that? For example, I
[1:04:36] observe you. You you come and you
[1:04:38] rejoice and you you're wonderful. And I
[1:04:41] ask myself, how long does it last?
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; After you come and you rejoice and you
[1:04:47] give praise, is it as long as going down
[1:04:49] in the car?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Is it on you still Monday,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Tuesday? When I preach the whole week,
[1:04:56] the anointing is on me still because I
[1:04:58] stay in prayer
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; so that I can live close to God. Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have no guarantee.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; The only guarantee we have is that as
[1:05:05] long as you have faith, you will remain
[1:05:07] what you said you are.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; You can have faith now and lose it in
[1:05:12] another 5 minutes.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to talk to you
[1:05:15] about this evening and to show you that
[1:05:17] God give you a long time to live. Not to
[1:05:20] live to enjoy yourself, but to live to
[1:05:22] please him.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; And if you please him, you will be
[1:05:27] happy.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I tend to make people think and
[1:05:32] I believe that when I'm finished
[1:05:33] preaching and if you're not thinking
[1:05:35] about it then I fail.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; My job is to help you that you will
[1:05:40] never be the same person again.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; That's all I live for. I'm not much. I'm
[1:05:46] a little spokes when I was dunkers.
[1:05:48] Brother Isaac came down mighty man of
[1:05:50] God and I laugh.
[1:05:55] Mighty is overrated.
[1:05:57] Anyhow, let's go to the word and you
[1:06:00] have had the scripture readings and I'm
[1:06:01] going to get I have couple of them
[1:06:03] because I'm starting now and finish on
[1:06:05] Sunday of God is give us the mercies and
[1:06:08] I know a lot of people expect the
[1:06:09] rapture but I don't think they're right
[1:06:11] because nobody know the day nor the
[1:06:13] hour. All they wanted to do was a trip
[1:06:16] but we are here to go into the word. So
[1:06:18] the first scripture we're going to use
[1:06:19] is Mark 11.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Mark 11 if you find it for me.
[1:06:28] And just bear with me. I'm a little
[1:06:30] slower, you know. And reading from verse
[1:06:33] 22 to 26.
[1:06:36] And may the Lord, Father God, this is
[1:06:38] your word. When you were here, you broke
[1:06:41] the bread and it multiply and fed 5,000.
[1:06:44] Lord, this is spiritual food. Break it.
[1:06:47] And those who are listening, if the
[1:06:49] Wi-Fi is working and those who are here,
[1:06:52] may we all eat in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Could you join with me?
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answering said unto them,
[1:07:00] "Have faith in God. For verily I say
[1:07:02] unto you, that whosoever shall say unto
[1:07:05] this mountain, be thou removed, and be
[1:07:07] thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[1:07:09] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[1:07:12] that those things which he see shall
[1:07:14] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:07:16] he said." These are powerful words,
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; and many times I don't think we think
[1:07:21] about them. Therefore, I say unto you,
[1:07:24] what thingsoever you desire when you
[1:07:27] pray, believe that you receive them, and
[1:07:30] you shall have them.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And when you stand praying, forgive. If
[1:07:34] you have ought against any, that your
[1:07:36] father also which is in heaven may
[1:07:39] forgive you your trespasses. But if you
[1:07:42] do not forgive, neither will your father
[1:07:44] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:07:46] trespasses. Mark 16. I have a little
[1:07:50] reading and you know That's that's where
[1:07:52] it's coming from. Reading from verse 16
[1:07:56] or 15. I'm going to go a little ahead of
[1:08:00] you. And he said unto them, "Go into all
[1:08:02] the world and preach the gospel to every
[1:08:04] creature." That's what we are doing now.
[1:08:06] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:08:07] be saved. He that believeth not shall be
[1:08:09] done. And these signs shall follow them
[1:08:12] that believe in my name. Shall they cast
[1:08:14] out devils. They shall speak with new
[1:08:15] tongues. I shall take up serpents. And
[1:08:18] if they drink any deadly thing, it shall
[1:08:20] not hurt them. They shall lay hands on
[1:08:22] the sick and they shall recover. One
[1:08:25] more reading in Romans chapter 4.
[1:08:30] Romans chapter 4.
[1:08:35] And you can't talk faith without talking
[1:08:36] to Abraham.
[1:08:38] Reading verse hold on.
[1:08:43] There we go. Chapter 4
[1:08:49] verse 16.
[1:08:51] Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it is of faith that it might
[1:08:55] be by grace to the end the promise might
[1:08:57] be true to all the seed. Not to that
[1:09:00] only which is of the law, but to that
[1:09:02] also which is of the faith of Abraham,
[1:09:05] who is the father of us all. As it is
[1:09:07] written, I have made thee a father of
[1:09:09] many nations before him whom you
[1:09:12] believe, even God, who quickened the
[1:09:14] dead and called those things which be
[1:09:16] not as though they were. who against
[1:09:18] hope believed in hope that he might
[1:09:20] become the father of many nations
[1:09:22] according to that which was spoken, so
[1:09:24] shall thy seed be. And being not weak in
[1:09:27] faith, he considered not his own body
[1:09:29] now dead. When he was about 100 years
[1:09:32] old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:09:34] womb. He staggered not at the promise of
[1:09:37] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[1:09:40] praise, giving glory to God. And being
[1:09:42] fully persuaded, that's a that's a key
[1:09:45] thing, being fully persuaded. that what
[1:09:48] he had promised, who God had promised,
[1:09:52] he was able also to perform. May the
[1:09:55] Lord bless the word. You can have your
[1:09:56] seats.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless brother Terry, wonderful
[1:10:03] brother.
[1:10:04] Now, this evening, I want to go a little
[1:10:07] more into what I started that Holy
[1:10:10] Spirit had given me on last Wednesday
[1:10:13] about Lord, help me to live what I
[1:10:15] believe. It sound It sounds strange, but
[1:10:18] if you think about it, are we really
[1:10:20] believing or living what we believe? And
[1:10:23] this evening, I want to go a little
[1:10:25] deeper and have a text dismantling
[1:10:29] unbelief.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; The word dismantle is a big word. In
[1:10:33] fact, I was hoping to get one of them
[1:10:35] true them cube. You know them cube, them
[1:10:38] square cube.
[1:10:40] And I was hoping to bring it and
[1:10:42] dismantle it so you would see that it
[1:10:45] takes effort to dismantle.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; You can't just say you're going to
[1:10:49] dismantle. Dismantle doesn't happen by
[1:10:50] speech.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Dismantle happens by action.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And faith is an action.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is a product of of one you
[1:11:00] don't believe. So beyond beyond to
[1:11:03] understand that dismantling is not
[1:11:04] something you come on a Sunday and you
[1:11:06] get and you're gone.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? That is why
[1:11:10] Abraham had some time
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; cuz the greatest test in faith and
[1:11:14] unbelief is time
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and none of us have time
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; and that's why we have problems because
[1:11:21] everybody want it
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; now. And that is the that is the uh
[1:11:26] phenomena that we have to get rid of
[1:11:28] when we become children of God because
[1:11:30] we in into that thing where we I want it
[1:11:33] now
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; and if we don't get it we you know we
[1:11:36] lose faith and we get weak and so on. So
[1:11:38] I want to look a little about
[1:11:40] dismantling unbelief. Now the word
[1:11:43] dismantling means to take something to
[1:11:45] pieces or take it apart or strip it
[1:11:48] bare.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me systematically?
[1:11:52] So you're pulling narrative pieces. What
[1:11:54] we want to talk about this evening is
[1:11:56] Lord help me to live what I believe. And
[1:11:59] of course unbelief is what is blocking
[1:12:01] us or this uh not allowing us to live
[1:12:05] what we believe.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Now you when I say the word what I
[1:12:08] believe is what you claim and what I
[1:12:10] claim. I believe the message. I believe
[1:12:11] God sent a prophet and I believe
[1:12:13] everything I read in the Bible.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; The question is do I live it?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Do I believe enough to live it? And if
[1:12:20] I'm not living it, why? Because God
[1:12:22] cannot lie.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; And you say you're lying.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And two of us can be saying the same
[1:12:29] thing and not getting the results.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And I know God cannot lie. So we have to
[1:12:33] assume that we are the ones that are
[1:12:34] lying.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; But we don't like to acknowledge it. And
[1:12:37] therefore, we need to recognize before
[1:12:39] you could fix anything, you have to find
[1:12:41] the reason that you are sick or the
[1:12:43] reason that you are like that. If you
[1:12:45] don't find a reason, then you're just
[1:12:47] doing what we call plastering.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; You don't want that. You want to find
[1:12:50] the cause so you can get the cure.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And unbelief began in the Garden of
[1:12:56] Eden.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So dismantling means disconnecting,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; detaching, dismembering, dividing,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; disassembling.
[1:13:05] All those things are connected to what
[1:13:08] we want to talk about this evening. All
[1:13:10] right.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Now, let me see if I can go here and try
[1:13:13] and follow me. Now many times we think
[1:13:15] that sin which is unbelief is drinking,
[1:13:19] gambling, committing adultery. But these
[1:13:22] are just attributes of unbelief. What's
[1:13:24] the topic again? Dismantling unbelief
[1:13:28] and unbelief is the only sin.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Gambling is the attribute of this sin.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So he says the attributes of
[1:13:38] unbelief. Now those who does those
[1:13:40] things do it because they do not
[1:13:43] believe.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; But I thought you said you believe
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; but then we find within ourselves these
[1:13:48] habits
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and we've been on the road a while.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And we still lying.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Of course we don't take it as a lie
[1:13:56] because we laugh but laughing don't make
[1:13:59] a lie the truth.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And probably that's one of the reasons
[1:14:02] why we are not serious. Brother Brandham
[1:14:04] was told be more sincere
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; and he is the one with the sign and the
[1:14:09] angel is with him
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; and he is not sincere enough and the
[1:14:14] angel is telling him cuz I'm coming to
[1:14:15] that. So you need to understand one of
[1:14:18] the only way to grow as a Christian and
[1:14:20] remove that unbelief is be honest.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; There is not enough honesty in the bride
[1:14:26] of Christ.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And honesty means
[1:14:30] you have to be honest with yourself
[1:14:31] first. It begins with me.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; And you know, majority of us like to
[1:14:37] think that we good
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; and we we perfect and we reach where we
[1:14:41] going. That's why we don't take telling
[1:14:42] and we don't take advice and we don't
[1:14:44] take we don't like nobody tell us
[1:14:46] anything.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And if you really want to know if it's a
[1:14:48] believer, let the pastor say, "Listen, I
[1:14:50] don't think you should do that. I need
[1:14:52] think you need to stop and see if you
[1:14:54] take it with a pinch of salt or if you
[1:14:56] take it with a smile.
[1:14:59] See if you take it with knowing that he
[1:15:01] loves you and he cares.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? And these are the
[1:15:04] times that we get to know who we really
[1:15:06] are when we are being tested.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And every son and every daughter must be
[1:15:14] tested, tried and proven. There is no
[1:15:19] excuse for you to go in. You have to
[1:15:22] pass through that door. You have no
[1:15:25] window climbing
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; and you have to pass through that door
[1:15:28] though where you are proven. I listen to
[1:15:30] brother T a lot of times and he's
[1:15:32] looking for that time when we'll see the
[1:15:34] the uh the sick raised and the dead
[1:15:37] raised and the lame walk and so on. Now
[1:15:39] these are powerful things. Who's going
[1:15:40] to do it? People who have been tested,
[1:15:42] tried and proven. God is not going to
[1:15:44] give you a gun and you don't know who to
[1:15:45] shoot.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You don't give your child a gun. For
[1:15:50] example, I just saw on the news a little
[1:15:52] boy seven years old put his little child
[1:15:54] sister two years in an oven and baker.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Now how is he going to be staying home
[1:16:00] and do that? Because the parents were
[1:16:02] not there.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; God is not going to give us things to do
[1:16:06] in before Jesus here what Jesus told the
[1:16:08] disciples. Before you go and do anything
[1:16:10] about representing me with all those
[1:16:12] signs, I want you to go in the upper
[1:16:14] room.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was a time when Jesus
[1:16:17] had gone to a place and the people
[1:16:19] didn't accept them. And when they were
[1:16:20] leaving, one of the disciples with all
[1:16:22] the godliness in him said, "Let burn
[1:16:25] them."
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You don't know what
[1:16:31] kind of spirit you have."
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; And one of the things that Jesus
[1:16:35] recognizes that these brothers had zeal,
[1:16:38] but zeal without the knowledge and
[1:16:40] without the control can be destructive.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? And therefore,
[1:16:45] it's important for us to learn these
[1:16:47] things by experience.
[1:16:49] Faith comes by hearing, hearing the word
[1:16:51] of God. But you cannot get faith without
[1:16:54] an experience that brings you to a place
[1:16:57] where you really know if you believe or
[1:16:59] not.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; So let's continue. So he says uh Jesus
[1:17:05] would not do those things. So these
[1:17:06] things are actually the attributes of
[1:17:08] unbelief. And there is only two spirits
[1:17:11] that control a man. That's either his
[1:17:13] faith or his doubt. And you notice not
[1:17:16] mine, yours. our faith, our doubt. Now
[1:17:21] you might think it's God's faith. You as
[1:17:23] a child of God has been appropriated a
[1:17:26] certain amount of faith to do a certain
[1:17:28] amount of thing. God will not tell me if
[1:17:31] you believe you can get what you want
[1:17:33] and then don't show me how to do it or
[1:17:35] don't allow me to do it. He don't play.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; He will give you a promise that is
[1:17:41] available, that is unattainable and that
[1:17:43] is possible.
[1:17:47] The problem is we don't check it out to
[1:17:49] find out why
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; am I not getting it
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; cuz if it is for me I want it
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want to you know hear you in
[1:18:00] other words brother Brennham talk a lot
[1:18:02] of nice things and many miracles and
[1:18:04] signs and I'm following the same God you
[1:18:07] know many time I'm telling I say father
[1:18:09] the same way you helped brother Brennham
[1:18:11] and he was able to come to you about
[1:18:13] these things we have issues too we have
[1:18:15] needs
[1:18:16] Where do we go?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? We love you. We We
[1:18:21] appreciate you. And the devil is hearing
[1:18:23] that. And he's saying, "Don't don't
[1:18:25] listen to him. Don't listen to him
[1:18:26] because I don't want him to get smart. I
[1:18:28] don't want him to wake up. I don't want
[1:18:30] him to dismantle that unbelief."
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And you don't even realize it, but there
[1:18:39] are two people with you. When you get
[1:18:40] up, when you become a believer, Satan is
[1:18:42] just behind you.
[1:18:46] just behind your head. If you read
[1:18:47] brother Brennham, he will tell you that
[1:18:49] old evil spirit is just right there.
[1:18:50] That's why he just talk to you in your
[1:18:53] ears.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; In your ears.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? That's why the air
[1:18:59] is in the head, not in the foot.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; He's right there because you want to go
[1:19:03] back in the house.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; When the unclean spirit leaves a body,
[1:19:07] it is not going and look for another
[1:19:08] house. That's his house. But I'm saying
[1:19:11] to you that that house was not designed
[1:19:13] for him.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; He's a thief. He's a robber. He came in
[1:19:18] without permission. He wants to come
[1:19:21] back.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; What you have to do is have a strong
[1:19:25] man, which is faith, which comes by
[1:19:28] hearing the word
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; to keep him out.
[1:19:31] The devil don't play. He has one plan. I
[1:19:36] met a young lady downstairs and she uh
[1:19:39] uh was in a wheelchair. Now, I don't
[1:19:41] know about you, that break me.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; You know why? I'm saying I'm a preacher.
[1:19:47] I preach the gospel and I'm preaching
[1:19:49] about power and I'm preaching about
[1:19:51] deliverance and I read this verse
[1:19:54] whatsoever you desire.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And I feel helpless. And I said, Lord,
[1:20:00] shouldn't I? Isn't there something that
[1:20:01] I can do?
[1:20:03] I listen to that child. The only reason
[1:20:05] she's alive today is because she has
[1:20:07] faith.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; I do insurance. Insurance says when you
[1:20:11] have sickle cell at 17, you die.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; She's sick 26. That is the grace of God.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That is faith in her.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; She is fighting. And while she's talking
[1:20:22] to us, she bends her head down and says,
[1:20:24] and I asked the mother, "What's wrong?"
[1:20:25] She says, "She has pain.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's why I don't play." Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; The devil should not be able to do that.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; We have been given the tools
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and we've been praying
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; rather than building
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; because to dismantle to dismantle
[1:20:46] unbelief is to build faith.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of unbelief and not
[1:20:52] building something.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me you come to church
[1:20:55] and you don't even know what your what
[1:20:56] your purpose is, what God called you
[1:20:58] for?
[1:21:00] God didn't call us for us to get blows.
[1:21:03] God call us for us to get blows to be
[1:21:06] conquerors.
[1:21:10] We have a plan. We have a purpose. He's
[1:21:13] right there. Willing us sending the
[1:21:16] message over and over. What is the
[1:21:18] message doing to you?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That word is supposed to build you in
[1:21:24] what? The stature of what?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; The perfect man. Where's the man? Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Where is the woman?
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, do you know why the rapture
[1:21:34] ain't come yet?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Don't blame God.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; We are late.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Because him not willing that any should
[1:21:42] perish. He sees that many of us and you
[1:21:45] live in a place I I don't know about
[1:21:47] you, but I feel sorry for you because
[1:21:48] Trinidad have everything. My daughter
[1:21:51] just come for a week. She said, "D, I
[1:21:52] want to stay."
[1:21:56] And of course, you know who's spending
[1:21:59] and one this and oh wow I can stay here
[1:22:02] and I'm like checking the days but we
[1:22:05] only have another week
[1:22:08] and I'm like how do you do it you have
[1:22:11] the world at your fingertips
[1:22:13] life and the things of life pride of
[1:22:16] life lust of the flesh lust of the
[1:22:18] things
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; and you think it's great but it's more
[1:22:23] dangerous
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; because you you have no idea when you
[1:22:27] know I don't want to go off track. When
[1:22:29] Jesus met that rich rangula, that rich
[1:22:31] rang ruler did not go to Jesus because
[1:22:32] he wasting time. He go to Jesus because
[1:22:34] he have everything right on that side
[1:22:36] and he want to fix your life now.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And Jesus said,
[1:22:40] well, you know the the law. He said, I
[1:22:42] have obeyed all 10
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; from my youth.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; All 10.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked at him and said he
[1:22:51] loved him.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Hello. Now, we want to see if it's true.
[1:22:57] And you're going to get a test now. You
[1:22:59] ready, honey?
[1:23:01] Go.
[1:23:03] Go.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is he saying go?
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Go where?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; You know how long I take to build that?
[1:23:11] Do you know why my balance in my count
[1:23:13] is? Do you know what I have done to have
[1:23:15] that? I sleepless nights. Working double
[1:23:19] shift.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Working real hard. Some days I ain't
[1:23:23] eating. My stomach on fire. I have
[1:23:27] reflex.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; And what you saying? Go.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. Did he say go?
[1:23:35] What's the other one? And what?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, Lord. I could do a portion.
[1:23:42] I could sell a portion, but you can't
[1:23:45] let me sell this. Come on. You know how
[1:23:49] my father gave me that?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; I can't give up all that. Please go
[1:23:55] easy.
[1:23:58] For goodness sake, go easy. Ease up.
[1:24:00] Jesus didn't ease up. He said, "Go and
[1:24:02] sell all
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; that you have accumulated.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; You want eternal life
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; or you're just talking.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; It's easy to obey the law.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, sin is not, oh, don't
[1:24:17] shall not do this and don't shall not do
[1:24:18] that." It's them things that I can't see
[1:24:20] like malice
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; and hate.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; You could have hate and I would never
[1:24:26] know.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Grinding it, sucking it away and you're
[1:24:31] there and God bless brother and I would
[1:24:34] never know how powerful that is. Because
[1:24:37] why? You were designed like that.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; When we came to this world, we came as
[1:24:43] hybrid
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; in the garden. spoken word is the
[1:24:47] original seed hybrid.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; You know what hybrid means? You have a
[1:24:51] lot of cars here
[1:24:54] and the name hybrid. And you even
[1:24:55] realize we live in the message
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; and all of us want hybrid.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Nobody want the original old condom or
[1:25:03] the old the original thing where you
[1:25:05] turn the key. That's arcade. You're not
[1:25:09] with the times.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Did you hear? No. Some of you might get
[1:25:12] offended, but it's all right. I'm only
[1:25:14] here for a week.
[1:25:17] But these are the things when I came to
[1:25:18] God, when God arrested me, I had what
[1:25:22] you call a Honda Integra, the first one
[1:25:24] in Grenada. I was working in the bank.
[1:25:26] So they had a big show and I'm driving
[1:25:29] this fancy car.
[1:25:31] And when I came to God, the Holy Spirit
[1:25:33] asked me, "Which one you put in front,
[1:25:35] the car or God?"
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; I sold it. I had to prove that that car
[1:25:41] is not more important to me than my
[1:25:44] faith.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I got rid of it.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; So I got another one and I'm there. And
[1:25:52] when I'm going into it, one of the guys
[1:25:54] says, "So Tim, you're going to live in
[1:25:56] that."
[1:25:58] I put car before house. You know when
[1:26:00] you're young, he says, "You're going to
[1:26:02] live in that." I changed my mind on car.
[1:26:04] So car now is just transportation.
[1:26:07] I can't live in it.
[1:26:09] What happened to it? They dismantled my
[1:26:11] ideas,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; destroyed it,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; and I'm saying to you, what do you have
[1:26:18] that is not beneficial to your soul,
[1:26:23] to your destiny? We getting older, not
[1:26:25] younger. You're getting pains that you
[1:26:27] never had before. And on top of that,
[1:26:30] with unbelief, how you going to get
[1:26:31] well?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you see what's happening?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And we are going down the road. held
[1:26:38] bell
[1:26:39] and nobody checking.
[1:26:42] Do I have what it takes? Yes, the word
[1:26:44] have what it takes.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; The word has been given it to us. But
[1:26:48] for us, church became a transaction.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; You ever heard about a transaction where
[1:26:56] I buy, you sell.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; So it's a transaction. God, you give me
[1:26:59] peace, I give you part of my life.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Just enough,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; not too much. cuz I want a little nice
[1:27:08] things. I want a little I want to be
[1:27:10] able to listen to a little calypso now
[1:27:11] and then. I want to be be able to listen
[1:27:13] to, you know, some of this what we call
[1:27:16] regular music. I mean, not because you
[1:27:18] save your stupid.
[1:27:21] So, we still have some of the old taste
[1:27:23] that we not giving up.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; We are still some of them old things and
[1:27:27] the little steel bar
[1:27:29] and so on.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And we like a little function where the
[1:27:33] world is.
[1:27:35] No, as I said before, me ain't worrying
[1:27:37] about you because brother know I only
[1:27:39] here for a week.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; But my job is to help you recognize that
[1:27:46] time is running out.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And you need to know God. You need to be
[1:27:52] certain of God.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; You cannot be committed. Look at look at
[1:27:56] the amount of people on a holiday in
[1:27:58] Grenada. When it's holiday, it didn't
[1:27:59] make a difference.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; The whole church comes.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You know why? cuz everybody's concerned
[1:28:06] and everybody's praying and when you
[1:28:08] pray you get into the inner veil and
[1:28:10] when you get into the inner veil you
[1:28:12] realize I may not be in where I thought
[1:28:15] I was. Paul himself said I must be
[1:28:18] careful.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; When I think I'm already in
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and I'm not.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not unsaving you know because if
[1:28:28] you're unsaving means you're unsaved.
[1:28:30] Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to do is to get you to
[1:28:33] hook dismantle unbelief which is the
[1:28:36] greatest scourge in the message.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; We have a lot a lot of people but very
[1:28:41] few believers.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; They come in by their turns on the on
[1:28:48] the and the the droves.
[1:28:52] I was standing by a place today in my
[1:28:54] massi
[1:28:56] and a lady was there nice long dress and
[1:28:58] a man is coming. She say, "God bless."
[1:29:00] So me, you know, in Grenada, you hear
[1:29:02] God bless that message.
[1:29:04] So I said, "How she saying God?" That
[1:29:05] must be your message believer. So I say,
[1:29:07] "Hi, are are you a believer?" She said,
[1:29:09] "Yes." I said, "What you chose?" And
[1:29:10] then I see her pastor. She said, "I'm a
[1:29:12] pastor." And that man is coming with a
[1:29:14] red shoes, a red pants, and a red
[1:29:16] everything red.
[1:29:20] So media had to ask about if his message
[1:29:23] again because what coming there is not a
[1:29:25] man.
[1:29:28] Not long after the people came that were
[1:29:30] with her one of her pants I say hey
[1:29:32] everybody saying God bless now
[1:29:37] any let me move on I ain't have much
[1:29:40] time on this holiday I don't want you to
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; run out while I'm preaching
[1:29:46] so here's what this this says each one
[1:29:48] of us this day is possessed with one of
[1:29:50] the other
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen is a horrible thing and Jesus in
[1:29:55] his teaching upgraded them because of
[1:29:58] their unbelief. You know what upgrade
[1:30:00] means? Forcefully. You have to
[1:30:02] understand we preach as soft. When
[1:30:05] you're dealing with Jesus, you either
[1:30:07] come straight or don't come.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't play around. He empty your
[1:30:12] whole church. 70 evangelists, preachers,
[1:30:16] popes,
[1:30:18] they left because he deliberately said,
[1:30:21] "Eat my flesh. Drink my blood." because
[1:30:24] he knew from the beginning
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; they had unbelief.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you're hearing me.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; So when they were gone who
[1:30:38] does he personally choose remember he
[1:30:40] choose the same but it's not like choose
[1:30:42] like he went and look for that one here
[1:30:44] and he went and look for that one. He
[1:30:46] didn't go and look them come and look
[1:30:47] for him.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; And when they came, you say, "Okay,
[1:30:49] y'all want to be part of the program,
[1:30:51] right?" And he send them out two by two.
[1:30:53] And they were casting out devils. Devils
[1:30:54] casting out devils.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Hello. Why is that possible? Because he
[1:31:01] had given them power.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And the devil must understand who in
[1:31:05] charge. They had authority.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They were given the
[1:31:11] authority and they were doing it. And
[1:31:12] they were glad.
[1:31:17] There are some things going on now in
[1:31:18] the world. It's crazy.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Here is this woman. I I mean these days
[1:31:23] people just stand up. You go in a church
[1:31:25] and they speak in tongue, not tongue,
[1:31:26] something.
[1:31:28] And they run it and I'm like, what is in
[1:31:31] the world is going on? So here is this
[1:31:34] woman and she's running it and the man
[1:31:35] says uh anybody here to speak just pray
[1:31:38] in tonesues. And she raised her hand. He
[1:31:40] said come. And he gave her the mic. He
[1:31:41] said let me hear you pray in tones. And
[1:31:43] she went look and she make cheating and
[1:31:45] when he done he said now tell them what
[1:31:46] you just say.
[1:31:49] She couldn't even say the first word.
[1:31:53] He said now watch me. Go on. Sit down.
[1:31:55] Stop that nonsense and stop distripping
[1:31:58] us. Don't do that again.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; She never ever will speak.
[1:32:04] All I'm trying to show you is what
[1:32:06] unbelief is
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; and there silently creeping along
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; being your passenger being with you.
[1:32:13] Why? Because you're not growing. If you
[1:32:15] grow, it means faith is victorious.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; We need to be higher than where we are.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; This place should be on fire. People all
[1:32:24] over the place. Why? We have an
[1:32:26] opportunity. People are saying the
[1:32:28] rapture is today.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Look behind you. Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something. Even if you
[1:32:39] see the dead raised here, it wouldn't
[1:32:41] change you.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; It will not even change you. By
[1:32:46] tomorrow, you're back in number one.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And I have seen that with my own eyes.
[1:32:54] Brother near in debt. Custing all the
[1:32:57] time. He didn't the message. You always
[1:32:59] had to go and help him repair damage.
[1:33:02] always repairing damage that he did with
[1:33:04] his mouth.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; He's dying. We send the brothers and
[1:33:08] he's still crawling dying.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Death don't change you.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Death don't take away your anger. Death
[1:33:18] don't take away your bitterness. Death
[1:33:20] don't take away the way you are.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; That's why you must
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; be born again.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And we take that and we make it simple.
[1:33:29] It's like, well, well, you know, I'm
[1:33:30] born again. are baptized. Born again
[1:33:33] means not the same person.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; A new creation,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; a new generation, a regeneration of what
[1:33:41] it was.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Not the same car with a different paint.
[1:33:49] And many of us could be faithful and
[1:33:51] Christians here.
[1:33:54] Can I come to your home
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; and be invisible
[1:33:58] and hear the husbands and wife
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; and let me move on. I know
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; let me go on because that is coming real
[1:34:07] regular now
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; and people get so custom in living in
[1:34:11] the message that they ain't even
[1:34:12] watching the life
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and pastors are not preaching about it
[1:34:17] because they're going to lose
[1:34:20] ching ching.
[1:34:22] Hallelujah.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I know you're not like that.
[1:34:25] So I could afford to make that comment
[1:34:27] here. But y churches, I can't say that.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Let's go
[1:34:33] now. He upraded them that they should
[1:34:36] not have done a particular thing. And he
[1:34:37] also chided Sidon and Capanium which
[1:34:41] were exalted up into heaven shall be
[1:34:42] brought down to hell. For if the mighty
[1:34:44] works, hear it. Mighty works had been
[1:34:47] done in you as to Solomon Gomorrah and
[1:34:50] the other cities. If the mighty works
[1:34:52] had in Solomon Gomorrah had been done in
[1:34:55] Capalonium, it would have been standing
[1:34:58] today.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. So why wasn't Solomon
[1:35:03] Gomorrah standing? They had an angel.
[1:35:05] They had a message of God and they
[1:35:07] failed to receive it. And today Solomon
[1:35:11] Gomorrah lies in the bottom of the sea.
[1:35:14] That's the result of unbelief.
[1:35:17] I am your friend, not your enemy. I am
[1:35:21] here to tell you, wake up.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Believe. Be certain of God.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Stop the games.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Be real.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; If you can't find it, stay here. Do what
[1:35:34] I do. Do I'll stay here. I ain't
[1:35:36] leaving. So help me, God. Life too
[1:35:39] serious.
[1:35:40] [Applause]
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Don't be spoiled.
[1:35:47] Do you know easy living means no
[1:35:50] victory?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; You know that
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; it's only when a man face trials and
[1:35:58] hardness that he calls God.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; People don't want God because they all
[1:36:03] are right.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And worshiping God is connected to need.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a need, you in pray.
[1:36:12] If everything going f well you see the
[1:36:13] rich as they get the richer they get the
[1:36:15] less they pray
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; and pray is your power
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; the power in a church is prayer
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; you could listen to all the message in
[1:36:24] the world and you don't want to talk to
[1:36:25] God you think God going to say all right
[1:36:27] I could I could ease you up
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; God made me to talk to him God made you
[1:36:36] to talk to him to spend time on Gre's
[1:36:40] knees
[1:36:42] But we don't want that. We want it easy.
[1:36:44] You pray for me. You pray for me. You do
[1:36:47] my religion. It ain't going to happen in
[1:36:48] the message. We are not Roman Catholics.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; We don't burn candle. We don't say or
[1:36:57] whatever they just say and roll bead.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; We don't pray for the dead.
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:09] I have never heard William Brandon
[1:37:10] preach a message and at the end he's not
[1:37:12] crying
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; or saying
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; what's wrong with us.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; You have the greatest message that ever
[1:37:19] hit this earth and we treat it as if it
[1:37:22] is a Roman dogma.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Not because them men and they mess it up
[1:37:28] it means wrong something wrong with it.
[1:37:33] Don't watch them men. They will always
[1:37:35] have.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; You don't see fellas pelting mango that
[1:37:42] green.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; You go after something that's good.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; So there's something in the message that
[1:37:49] the devil trying to blind to blindfold
[1:37:51] to sabotage to wreck.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And we are depending God is dependent on
[1:37:56] you. You you you the little ones the
[1:37:59] little bride.
[1:38:01] Little boy, little men,
[1:38:03] are you hearing me? Who knows
[1:38:07] what it is to be born again.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Being born again is not words.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I just had a grandson, first one out of
[1:38:25] five children, and the last shall be
[1:38:28] first. The last boy give me a grandson.
[1:38:30] And you know how much thing they had to
[1:38:32] do for that boy, that boy to born. And
[1:38:34] every day my little daughter come, watch
[1:38:35] your picture. Watch your picture. Watch
[1:38:36] your picture. Me want to see the picture
[1:38:38] when he's in the belly. I want to see
[1:38:40] the picture when he's up.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Because I live so long, you know, longer
[1:38:46] than them, they are excited. Come on,
[1:38:47] feel it. Come on, feel it. You know many
[1:38:50] children died in the belly. Do you know
[1:38:52] many people in church die as church
[1:38:55] members
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; until you are born
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; until you are born?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; You're not inside.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; The new birth is a must.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; It's not a suggestion.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; It's not something you well if you don't
[1:39:15] mind.
[1:39:17] He told Nicodemus, you must verily
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; and our prophet says without the new but
[1:39:28] we perish. Those are not just words.
[1:39:32] These are truths.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; William Mar and Brennham when he came
[1:39:36] into the message and he had a little
[1:39:38] hookup about it. How many died?
[1:39:41] You said we none die by me because you
[1:39:44] don't know who you are. The devil ain't
[1:39:46] taking none because you're already his.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; The devil has only interfere with what
[1:39:51] is not his.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Why would I go after something that I
[1:39:56] have?
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And he is number one in greed and envy.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; So what he is a thief? You don't thief
[1:40:04] your own thing.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; You don't thiefs. Hey, I just th some
[1:40:09] mang who the tree for mine. That make
[1:40:12] sense?
[1:40:14] They should arrest you for lying.
[1:40:17] You can't keep what it's yours.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And the devil only goes after lambs,
[1:40:22] sheep,
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; people who come to the house of God with
[1:40:25] a claim.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; With a desire,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; but how strong is a desire? I told
[1:40:32] Labarie, love is not enough these days.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; I love you, darling. It's not enough.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Help me wash the ways. Help me sweep the
[1:40:44] at the house.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Come with me. Let's go and shop.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; The love that we have is Go ahead.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Here's the money. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go
[1:40:53] ahead. Go ahead. Gone. Gone. Gone.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Though
[1:40:59] love is together.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; We walk together. We talk together. We
[1:41:04] love together. We embrace together. We
[1:41:07] shout together. We praise together. Do
[1:41:10] you love him?
[1:41:14] Prove that love. Saying your love is not
[1:41:17] enough.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; What about when the wife reach menopause
[1:41:23] and she pause
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and you last you get a hug and then your
[1:41:30] mother
[1:41:32] man you expect man to make it. You don't
[1:41:35] understand this thing. He's a human too
[1:41:37] and I have feelings.
[1:41:40] Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Get those feelings born again.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.
[1:41:47] Been there. Experience it. And until
[1:41:50] that old nature is gone, your eye long.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Male as well as female. Don't Don't take
[1:41:59] away the female. You know them more
[1:42:01] deadly.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Don't think well it's a sister. She have
[1:42:05] no bad thoughts.
[1:42:09] Let me go on. And these are what the
[1:42:11] attributes of what?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Unbelief. I'm saying to you, unbelief is
[1:42:15] a pandemic.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Actually, it's a endemic.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know which one is worse. Brother
[1:42:21] Isaac know more about these things. I
[1:42:22] don't know which one is. All I know is a
[1:42:24] mick
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; and it bad. And I am st
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; this message I love. And when I see what
[1:42:36] they're doing with it, shooting it down,
[1:42:38] pulling it here, pulling it there,
[1:42:40] destroying people, and they have people
[1:42:42] onto them as if them is God.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; You mean people that can't even read you
[1:42:51] a man, it's more important for you to
[1:42:53] please a man
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; when the when the word is God?
[1:43:01] Since when if my if I'm your pastor and
[1:43:04] I'm going wrong, leave me.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; No, pastors don't fear that. They're
[1:43:10] afraid to say that tonight.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; But real man of God is not afraid
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; because he is fixed. Faith is fixed.
[1:43:17] Faith is settled. Faith don't move left
[1:43:20] nor move right. You don't care who
[1:43:22] coming, who not coming. As long as you
[1:43:25] please God, that's all.
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:30] You're there on the bus, you go. You're
[1:43:32] not on the bus, you left.
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; God begging you.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; We must beg him.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; So long in the message, still have that
[1:43:46] temper.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And you're getting older. You think
[1:43:52] temper just get easier when you get
[1:43:53] older.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; It get more complicated. Amen.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; It's harder to deal with
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; because now you in your system and that
[1:44:01] what have you sick
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; before you know you say brother Tim I
[1:44:08] nervous you know you're nervous that
[1:44:10] thing inside there that rage
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; use your mother child
[1:44:17] until you become a son of God or a
[1:44:19] daughter of God you are your mother's
[1:44:21] child you are your father's daughter
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; and the seed of the father is in you
[1:44:25] until you become a son of God, until you
[1:44:28] become a daughter of God, until you are
[1:44:30] born again.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; DNA is no joke.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; People look at me say, "Boy, you look
[1:44:40] like your father." But it's better for
[1:44:41] me to say, "Boy, you're doing like your
[1:44:43] father."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Me and my father are one.
[1:44:47] I want to do like he did. He brought me
[1:44:49] a word. He brought me a life so that I
[1:44:52] can be like him.
[1:44:57] And then we have the belly to say God
[1:44:58] come and live in me. Where?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Where? In that rage.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; In that in condition
[1:45:08] when Matthew 5 is the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; You ever pray for your enemies?
[1:45:16] Well, send them a gift.
[1:45:20] Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; You said except your righteousness
[1:45:24] exceed what?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; The righteousness of what? The rich
[1:45:28] young ruler.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; You cannot
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; enter into the kingdom of heaven. And we
[1:45:35] have come to a place where everybody
[1:45:37] want a nice soft message. Go easy.
[1:45:42] It's for your own harm.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; You cannot if brother I heard brother
[1:45:46] Isaac preach a message. It takes perfect
[1:45:48] love
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; to enter there. What do you think is
[1:45:51] perfect love? Biting, snarling,
[1:45:55] leave me alone before I put on my
[1:45:56] salvation. That's perfect love.
[1:46:02] If you want to know is perfect love and
[1:46:03] brother Brennham said it and up to now I
[1:46:06] I'm not connected. Not not that I'm not
[1:46:08] connected but I hope I not to do that.
[1:46:10] You say if you love this lady
[1:46:13] and this man love her more and you have
[1:46:16] the love of God in your heart, he'll
[1:46:17] tell her look go with him.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Put up your say amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; There were a lot of thing in this
[1:46:28] message we only watching
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; but it is there to live.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Them that honor me,
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; I will honor them.
[1:46:39] Let me move on.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how much time I have to Jesus?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. At least nobody
[1:46:47] gone yet.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; So Jesus had just been called Beelub.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Hear that? Before somebody give you a
[1:46:59] nickname or something, you're upset.
[1:47:01] They call him Belug and he turn back.
[1:47:03] He's not be them. They calling you use
[1:47:05] that.
[1:47:07] So why you bothering you?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was going to the bread and shake
[1:47:12] hand and just turn away. So what? Shake
[1:47:14] somebody else on.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Why you had to make that a problem?
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know what I doing. And then you
[1:47:20] go there
[1:47:23] and the devil say yes I catch one.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Everything the devil drop, you're taking
[1:47:29] it up. What wrong with you? You're a
[1:47:31] garbage pickup.
[1:47:34] Every foolish thing he dropped. Oh,
[1:47:35] well, you know, brother, so what wrong
[1:47:37] with you? Why you come to church? Well,
[1:47:38] you know, I was planning to come. But I
[1:47:39] understand this, brother. Say this and
[1:47:41] Oh my God.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; If he was living in the days of the
[1:47:46] tree, right? Those three Hebrew boys,
[1:47:48] what you do when everybody was against
[1:47:51] them and their faith remained steadfast
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; and they said, "We will not defile
[1:47:57] ourselves with the king's meat."
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; These men and the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:48:04] given They just raw love.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Many things that we say we can do, we
[1:48:11] could do it to just roll off
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; because feel love have some power.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; A gap is what bends the corner.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; So could you imagine the prophet said
[1:48:29] who was the prince of the devils and
[1:48:31] because that he was able to discern the
[1:48:33] thoughts of the people. telling them
[1:48:34] where they had been and what they had
[1:48:36] done. They said he was an evil spirit.
[1:48:39] So I'm your brother as long as you ain't
[1:48:41] tell me nothing bad.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; God help me
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; the day that happened. Then tell
[1:48:48] yourself, uh, I got dementia.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I will lay the same word down as when
[1:48:54] Paul
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; regardless. And I know according to the
[1:48:58] word, he going to get less. Amen.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; When I was telling the message said 12
[1:49:03] right now, how much you saying?
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine men and women who had
[1:49:12] sat under the reading of the scripture
[1:49:14] through the years and had the great
[1:49:16] schools of spirit and would be and would
[1:49:18] be in a shape till they would see such
[1:49:20] as that and nail it down to a devil
[1:49:24] working when in the scripture had
[1:49:26] plainly quoted that's what it will be.
[1:49:29] And they were so took up in their dogmas
[1:49:30] until they failed to recognize him. And
[1:49:33] that's what's happened in the message.
[1:49:34] We fail to recognize the presence of
[1:49:37] God.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; And many times the Holy Ghost would come
[1:49:41] down and pay the place, but we busy and
[1:49:43] we going and God said, "Don't worry."
[1:49:45] Amen.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Many times I'm finished preaching and I
[1:49:50] can feel the anointing dropping down and
[1:49:52] those when they're not ready the whole
[1:49:54] place flooded and everybody on the floor
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; and then there'll be other times you
[1:49:58] could see the tension they want to go
[1:50:00] and God gone.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; It was starting but it gone
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; and you could switch off God like that
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; because you don't have a prayer life and
[1:50:10] you don't even know when he comes. Could
[1:50:12] you imagine you worshiping God for the
[1:50:14] last 20 years and you don't even know
[1:50:15] when he come
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; and you said God is my father and God is
[1:50:19] the one I love and you're willing to to
[1:50:21] say all kind of thing and fight
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; and you don't know him.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; You need help to stand up in your faith.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; I don't need no help.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's me alone.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I will stand with it. So help me God.
[1:50:41] Until
[1:50:44] you have an experience with God, you are
[1:50:45] nothing. Nothing.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; You're just a church member.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus, you know what Jesus says? In
[1:50:53] vain,
[1:50:54] they have what? A form.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want no form.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; You know what form means?
[1:51:07] They know what to say. Amen. They know
[1:51:08] to shake your hand. And they know how to
[1:51:10] do these forms. Where's the power to
[1:51:12] live above? Where's the power to tell
[1:51:15] unbelief scatter, dismantle?
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Where's the power? Listen, the spirit in
[1:51:23] you have more power over your body. Then
[1:51:26] why you allow your body to rule the
[1:51:28] spirit?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Why allow your temper to rule your
[1:51:32] inside? And then go and say you see why
[1:51:34] you cause cause what?
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; You do your own thing for yourself and
[1:51:38] blaming me. You need help.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Don't blame me for what you're doing.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Take the responsibility and recognize
[1:51:50] you need the new breath.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; You need faith.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; When a man of faith, he can't lose it.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Faith is settled.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; It's a substance. You know what
[1:52:03] substance means?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Substance mean is a living thing.
[1:52:11] You know what the Holy Spirit was
[1:52:12] showing me? He said unbelief is a devil
[1:52:15] and the substance that we call faith is
[1:52:17] the spirit of God
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; is real.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And if it's substance and is invisible,
[1:52:25] what else could it be?
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; It's invisible. Have you ever seen it?
[1:52:30] But you have seen the works. You've seen
[1:52:31] the action. Faith is a action thing.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That's why you have works with faith.
[1:52:40] Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; And when you say I believe the message
[1:52:43] and you keep coming, then God will cause
[1:52:45] something to happen in your home to see
[1:52:46] if you will still come.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you when time for
[1:52:51] church
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; and my car break down. I'll walk.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I'll walk.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; God will give me a ride.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro, what if you're living in
[1:53:01] town and you going grande?" I don't
[1:53:02] care.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Before they make God make foot
[1:53:08] When I when it comes to my God, nothing
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; comes between me and him.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; When I was dying, he helped me. When I
[1:53:19] was down, he picked me up. When I was
[1:53:21] lost, he saved me. And what am I doing?
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; I am not ungrateful.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; 10 lepers come to Jesus.
[1:53:35] And leprosy is a form of spiritual
[1:53:37] darkness.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's on the flesh
[1:53:41] and it's on the soul.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And they came and they said, "We want to
[1:53:45] get delivered."
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And Jesus watched them. He could have
[1:53:48] touched them.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; But these were different
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; because they had nine denominational and
[1:53:54] one believer
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; and he didn't want to make the
[1:53:57] denominational fellas feel bad for the
[1:53:59] believer he saw.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Go and show yourself to the
[1:54:03] priest." action and on the way
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; on the way
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; on the way
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; all of them skin clean
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; what happened
[1:54:14] nine was Grenadians didn't go back
[1:54:20] your country they not
[1:54:24] one
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; went back
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; and say thank you do you know why
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; one time I was preaching and the Holy
[1:54:32] Spirit showed me because the nine
[1:54:34] got back the leprosy.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz when the unclean spirit leave a
[1:54:39] person, it ain't gone.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; It's a clean.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Let's move on.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; So he said that would be such as that
[1:54:52] and nail it down. Okay. So God in all
[1:54:54] the ages has walked through men and the
[1:54:56] reason that they didn't believe him is
[1:54:57] because he was doing these great works
[1:54:59] of God. He had been a man. But it
[1:55:01] pleased God to manifest himself through
[1:55:03] his subjects. For God is a spirit. And
[1:55:05] God was manifesting himself through his
[1:55:07] son, the Lord Jesus. And they was trying
[1:55:09] to say that he made himself God. And
[1:55:11] they were ready to stone him.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You hear? Who want to stone him? Who get
[1:55:21] healing? Who eat a lot of bread and
[1:55:23] fish? Who eat a lot of things from him?
[1:55:26] Cuz your Bible said they chase him. They
[1:55:29] went looking for him. And he said, "I
[1:55:31] know why you're coming."
[1:55:33] We all also have to ask ourselves why we
[1:55:36] coming cuz people just go in church and
[1:55:38] hide
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; cuz people just tell him what happened
[1:55:40] to you. Well, something do with me some
[1:55:42] maybe they do me or some mal take me and
[1:55:44] they say well baptize.
[1:55:47] So people baptize and they say you going
[1:55:49] church. Yeah. Going still.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Where's the change? Where's the power?
[1:55:54] Well, you know how it is.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; I ain't too agree with everything
[1:55:57] they're saying.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; People have their own quiet things,
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; intricacies,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; widens fully when
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; you know it's the best of the rest.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Old Pharisee,
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; you you have the right to say wise best
[1:56:23] and wise rest.
[1:56:26] Since you don't understand why I preach
[1:56:28] it to be you. But if it's for you then
[1:56:29] you know if the cap fit
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I don't play.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; God don't play.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; And you should not play.
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; So God where am I? So him being a man
[1:56:49] could do those things. And the world
[1:56:50] hasn't changed too much. It's still hard
[1:56:52] for people to see that God is a spirit
[1:56:54] that works through men. He did it
[1:56:55] through Moses, Elijah, Noah, Enoch, and
[1:56:58] Jonah. Now, faith is not an emotion.
[1:57:01] It's not a sensation, but a substance,
[1:57:03] and it comes by hearing. So, it comes
[1:57:05] with an experience.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; It is not a mental conception. It is not
[1:57:09] a myth. It is not something mysterious.
[1:57:12] It's something you possess.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Buckle up. Hallelujah.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; If it is something you possess and it's
[1:57:20] something real, can you honestly I want
[1:57:23] you to speak to yourself inside. Do I
[1:57:26] have that?
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to question yourself. Do I
[1:57:31] have this substance? Is it so real in
[1:57:34] me? Because when it is real in you and
[1:57:36] it is there, you obey it.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; You don't question it. You don't reason
[1:57:42] it. You just obey
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; cuz faith is spirit.
[1:57:48] And spirit, there's only one spirit
[1:57:49] that's connected with faith. If faith
[1:57:51] cometh by hearing God and God is the
[1:57:53] word
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; and God is a spirit.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; So faith is spirit.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Spirit is substance. You must know if
[1:58:01] you have a spirit in you.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; that's why we say not by might,
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; not by power. That's what pushes me.
[1:58:11] That's what pushes brother Isaac. That's
[1:58:12] what pushes preachers to keep going in
[1:58:15] spite of what the people do.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; But the people have a responsibility for
[1:58:20] that same spirit. What they do with it.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Every time you hear that word,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; you have to give an account.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Every day you hear of a message. Coming
[1:58:32] to church is good and forsaking not the
[1:58:34] assembling is better, but it comes with
[1:58:38] a price.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Look at my hair. I have to forsake for
[1:58:44] go all physical ailments to bring the
[1:58:46] word to you. It's a price.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; I'm sure brother who is around my age
[1:58:52] have little ailments that he had to deal
[1:58:53] with too.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And that many times I studying the word
[1:58:56] and pain.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Does that stop me?
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; No. I have a purpose. I have a plan.
[1:59:03] God, I must please.
[1:59:07] Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; When I was in the world, who helped me?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; When I was heading for hell, who helped
[1:59:15] me?
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; God sent Jesus died for you,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; suffer for you,
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; go through all them thing for you. What
[1:59:22] is your response?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; You're in shame.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; What is our response? Are you self what
[1:59:34] do I call die to self so much that you
[1:59:36] would give him all
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; he didn't hold back
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; are you sold out
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; lock stuck and barrel that if God say
[1:59:45] stop that
[1:59:47] you would give it up
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; I don't like to do these things but the
[1:59:52] Lord have a way of dealing with me so if
[1:59:54] I go somewhere I shouldn't go he would
[1:59:56] send me a dream you shouldn't go there
[1:59:57] don't go there again
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; no that's because of a prayer life I
[2:00:00] have I Don't you talk about me. I don't
[2:00:02] know about you. And I if I like God know
[2:00:04] it's not it's not a lie.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; And and and then when I when he says
[2:00:08] watch that then I watch it because why I
[2:00:11] am telling him I need his help
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; because the road is dark. The road is
[2:00:17] deadly and Satan is like a roving lion.
[2:00:21] He's let me tell you and the closer you
[2:00:24] are to God is the more danger you face.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; There's no no game. Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; When I stand here to preach the gospel
[2:00:33] and I come to pray for you to cast out
[2:00:34] devils. When that devil gone, he watches
[2:00:36] me.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; And if I'm not living right, he attacks.
[2:00:40] He comes.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; The only thing to keep him is the angel.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; You are coming here and you're serving
[2:00:49] God. And the angel of the Lord encamped
[2:00:51] what?
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Round about now. When last check to see
[2:00:54] if the angel there,
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; is he with you?
[2:01:02] He ain't camping.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Where is the fear?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; He asked that question. Where is my
[2:01:08] fear?
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; People of of uh Headstone Tabernacle,
[2:01:12] don't get to the point where you get too
[2:01:13] big.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Stay humble.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; You have a wonderful, wonderful
[2:01:18] minister.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Support it.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; There are few like that. Amen.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; And it not getting better. You know what
[2:01:31] I asked my church? God forbid that he
[2:01:33] tries and we gone.
[2:01:36] And Isaac had to carry the burden. I
[2:01:39] wonder who gone to
[2:01:46] get quiet. So what happened? I done
[2:01:48] ain't done yet.
[2:01:52] How many here because of brother or how
[2:01:55] many here because of God?
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I think I'm going too far inside there.
[2:02:03] Okay. Yeah. Some parts in the house you
[2:02:05] can't go. So let me go back.
[2:02:09] But I usually preach by inspiration. As
[2:02:12] the Lord revealed it, I speak it. Any
[2:02:14] let me continue as I come to a close.
[2:02:20] He said,
[2:02:22] "Now it is the evidence of things hoped
[2:02:24] for. You do not have it as yet, but you
[2:02:26] have the authority of God to say that
[2:02:28] you have it."
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; You hear that?
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; You have the authority of God to say
[2:02:33] that you have it. I saw that child in
[2:02:35] the chair and I said, "Lord, what can I
[2:02:37] do?" And he said, "You have the word."
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; And I ain't reached there yet, but I can
[2:02:43] tell you something. If that child don't
[2:02:44] get healed, then the church bears the
[2:02:46] responsibility.
[2:02:48] Because one sin unconfessed
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; can cause that child not to be healed.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; One person can make the church fail
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; pitily.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; And God, brother Brenham said at the day
[2:03:05] of judgment,
[2:03:07] you will be called to give an account.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; You come in here, we don't confess sin,
[2:03:11] have a little boyfriend on the side or
[2:03:13] have a little girlfriend on the side and
[2:03:14] nobody don't know. You think God seen
[2:03:16] it?
[2:03:18] Hey, married, but yet you're having
[2:03:20] conversations in work or wherever you're
[2:03:22] going. That shouldn't be
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; those things don't go. So,
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; it's being looked at. It affects the
[2:03:33] growth and perfection and power in the
[2:03:36] church. Satan loves that.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; So, we would come with all the faith and
[2:03:40] you ain't have, you know what happened?
[2:03:42] We had to go back home.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; It takes two,
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; brother. all the faith. If you ain't in
[2:03:47] half, it won't happen. That's why he
[2:03:49] don't follow the people. He follow the
[2:03:51] light
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; where the faith is.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; And all of us have the ability to pull
[2:03:57] the light.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; But the light comes with sincerity. It
[2:04:00] comes with
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; genuiness.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Back home in Grenada, I was preaching
[2:04:08] about this message and people owing God
[2:04:11] in tithes. I don't know what y'all doing
[2:04:13] in Trinidad. talking about Gree
[2:04:17] and people just owe God.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, you could owe God when first fruit
[2:04:22] is.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; No, I'm telling you. Gay that. So, don't
[2:04:28] say I come here and preach tight.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Gate that because you ain't supposed to
[2:04:33] be doing that because you're making good
[2:04:34] money.
[2:04:37] As I ask the question, as I tell you, I
[2:04:39] like to observe. I ask what is it? What
[2:04:41] is it like in Trinidad? Oh, plentiful.
[2:04:43] Nice. My daughter want to come
[2:04:47] to whom much is given.
[2:04:50] Notice anytime you go in a church and
[2:04:52] you say money
[2:04:55] the place gone dead quiet
[2:05:01] brother. You could talk about this, talk
[2:05:02] about adultery, talk about this, talk
[2:05:04] about all kind of thing. Wearing bands
[2:05:06] cussing all thing. You say money.
[2:05:10] Ouch.
[2:05:12] Don't go there.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; That is sacrosant.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; I'm saying where created the point I'm
[2:05:24] making is if you could rob God in tight,
[2:05:28] what else will you rob him in?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Because when you start, it takes a kind
[2:05:34] of unbelief to make that move.
[2:05:38] Especially when you know you're wrong
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; and you're you're riding over it. Now
[2:05:42] remember g help me ga
[2:05:46] and especially when you know you're
[2:05:47] wrong and you're riding over it and you
[2:05:49] kind of let her pass but you pass in
[2:05:51] your conscience
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; and what you do you deaden it. What's
[2:05:55] doing that? Unbelief
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; and you ain't even worrying that God
[2:06:00] give you a 100 and all he aifi is 10
[2:06:02] cents.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; You ain't watching that. What you
[2:06:06] watching the 90?
[2:06:10] That's all I left with
[2:06:14] a bills to pay, rent to pay. What we
[2:06:17] talking greater? Because your face
[2:06:19] getting frightened.
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:25] Smile. So I know it's not you, not a
[2:06:28] dealer.
[2:06:31] You get the picture. But the point is if
[2:06:34] you could do that and I'm not talking
[2:06:35] about little people or big people,
[2:06:37] deacons, trustees. In fact, the more the
[2:06:39] people who make the more
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; guilty of that the most.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; It's too much.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; And God say I proven in that just that.
[2:06:51] And you break that. You know what is the
[2:06:52] next thing you'll be telling me?
[2:06:54] There'll be must be something else. Cuz
[2:06:56] if you could make that move there, where
[2:06:58] else? Now why am I doing dismantling
[2:07:01] unbelief? What is the biggest problem in
[2:07:03] the church today? Unbelief. It plaguing
[2:07:06] it pulling down people. It takes away
[2:07:08] the strength of the church. When the
[2:07:10] church should be vibrant,
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; you have enough. I hear message pass you
[2:07:14] here. Each one of you should be a prayer
[2:07:16] warrior healing people all over the
[2:07:18] place.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; The level of message pass here.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; So it ask I have to ask one question.
[2:07:27] What have you done
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; with Jesus
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; called Christ? Cuz if you take the word,
[2:07:34] you become the word. And if you become
[2:07:37] the word, no sickness should walk
[2:07:40] through that door.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; No condition should walk through that
[2:07:44] door. Because why? These signs shall
[2:07:48] follow where there is no unbelief.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; So we all a brother's keeper. We all
[2:07:57] have the right and we all have the
[2:07:58] responsibility to have that faith.
[2:08:01] That's why in the book of acts what
[2:08:03] happened
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; a thin believer came in
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; who owe tithes
[2:08:12] from the sale of the land ga
[2:08:16] smile please smile
[2:08:20] I could talk about my country
[2:08:23] and they said this is what we get now
[2:08:27] remember Peter no thy god in Peter.
[2:08:32] Peter can't kill people.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; He don't have the belly.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; God can kill.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; And God
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; took her down
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; without
[2:08:45] forgive me.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Without I'm sorry. Without Please give
[2:08:50] man another chance
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; one time.
[2:08:56] For the sin was in the heart,
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; not the mouth.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Not long, notice how they just go to
[2:09:04] church over there. About an hour after
[2:09:07] they're still in church, you going home
[2:09:09] already.
[2:09:11] The wife come
[2:09:14] that time. You going home long time cuz
[2:09:16] you can't stay long in church. You had
[2:09:17] to go and do your thing and make a
[2:09:19] dollar or whatever and eat your doubles
[2:09:21] and so on.
[2:09:23] And Peter ask him nothing less. She asks
[2:09:26] and nothing less. Come, come, come,
[2:09:28] come, come. We here waiting on you. The
[2:09:32] whole church waiting on you and she want
[2:09:33] to walk. Everybody so sad. We just bury
[2:09:35] your husband. Tell me your turn. Now how
[2:09:39] much you sell the land for?
[2:09:41] You know that foolish lady lie to
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; she ain't even have I thought the woman
[2:09:46] supposed to have some intuition to tell
[2:09:48] she said something ain't right. She lie.
[2:09:51] She say yes for so much. He said, "Well,
[2:09:53] them people who just bury your husband
[2:09:55] will take you out."
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Do you remember brother Brandham had the
[2:10:00] chance to do it and he couldn't do it
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; because the angel tell him you did the
[2:10:03] right thing.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Who killed them?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Who killed them? These things are
[2:10:11] written for what?
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; For what?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; And you know why nothing happened to us
[2:10:15] yet?
[2:10:18] Those who are praying
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; bringing grace. Amen.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Those who are believers bringing grace.
[2:10:24] You say understand Abraham
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; brought grace to a backsliden nephew.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; The nephew had nothing
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; left to the nephew alone. He dead.
[2:10:39] Abraham beg.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know who the 50 was? 50 of Lot
[2:10:44] family.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; He knew that was Sodom. He's a prophet.
[2:10:50] He knew he had nobody down there.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; So who he was begging for? Lot and his
[2:10:56] family. Because Lot went in there really
[2:10:58] harang on them
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; and the 50 of them. So he said, "What
[2:11:03] about 45
[2:11:05] and God going down here,
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; you reach 10
[2:11:10] and you make one final thing." He say,
[2:11:12] "I don't want to get you vexed, but
[2:11:13] permit me to say one final time before I
[2:11:16] get in trouble. Would you do it for
[2:11:18] five?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Saints, tell me something. This boy grew
[2:11:23] up with Abraham praying, reading the
[2:11:24] Bible and everything. He gone down in
[2:11:26] that place and in no time at all,
[2:11:29] everybody backslide.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Unbeliev them.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; And the only reason why they coming out
[2:11:39] is because of what? The righteousness of
[2:11:41] who?
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:11:46] So the righteousness of one or two
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; will stand in the gap for the many
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; pray God the rapture come and you ain't
[2:11:56] gone
[2:12:00] cuz all of that is over
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; a closing we continue Sunday because
[2:12:07] we're not talking this thing we looking
[2:12:08] real serious and I really ain't want to
[2:12:11] take licks yet wait until Sunday
[2:12:13] I close him with
[2:12:16] in Grenada. Where? Grenada.
[2:12:22] We had a situation in the church because
[2:12:24] we are very serious.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; No games. And there was a brother and a
[2:12:30] sister who were living in sin.
[2:12:33] I didn't know.
[2:12:35] The church did not know. And the night
[2:12:38] after studying, God gave me a dream. And
[2:12:40] as always get them dreams around five.
[2:12:42] And in the dream, I saw two great big
[2:12:45] black snake in the building.
[2:12:49] One inside hiding and the other one
[2:12:51] trying to come out
[2:12:54] huge. And I said, "There's something God
[2:12:57] is warning me about."
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; So I went to the church and in the
[2:13:02] preaching we found it out.
[2:13:05] When the service was over and I finished
[2:13:07] preach, a young sister walked in in my
[2:13:09] office shedding tears, balling,
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; she was living in fornication.
[2:13:16] Choir member,
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; you hear this choir member. I didn't
[2:13:21] know God knew. And she came. And the
[2:13:24] other one
[2:13:26] was a highlevel member
[2:13:30] who while I preaching walk out on God
[2:13:33] not once, not twice, not three times.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; And I spoke to him. I said, "You can't
[2:13:38] do that."
[2:13:42] And when he walking out, things went bad
[2:13:45] and he went south.
[2:13:48] We sent the brothers to pray, see if he
[2:13:50] come back.
[2:13:52] He sent her confession
[2:13:56] when I read it. I said, "But there are
[2:13:58] no place in this confession where he say
[2:13:59] he's sorry
[2:14:01] and he wouldn't do it again." So I said,
[2:14:04] "Brother, I I want to help you, but you
[2:14:06] had to put something in there to show
[2:14:07] that you mean business
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; action.
[2:14:12] You didn't do it. You wait, he wait, he
[2:14:15] waits, please." And then the Holy Spirit
[2:14:18] tell me that man is not going to do it.
[2:14:22] So after we give him a month, I went
[2:14:24] back and checked the prophet and I see
[2:14:26] where the prophet said, "You have a
[2:14:27] month and then do what you got to do."
[2:14:29] And right in the front of the church in
[2:14:31] the Sunday morning, we released the body
[2:14:34] to the devil that the soul might be
[2:14:37] saved.
[2:14:38] No, I'm just telling you about Ga.
[2:14:42] Guess what happened?
[2:14:44] It changed the church.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; People in plane,
[2:14:49] everybody serious.
[2:14:51] The whole church prays. The whole church
[2:14:54] to a man
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; and they don't stay home. No service
[2:15:00] holiday or not.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Is that me? No. When you begin to get
[2:15:07] serious with God, God begins to get
[2:15:09] serious with you.
[2:15:12] And I'm saying to you, this is we're
[2:15:14] going to stop here because I think we
[2:15:17] need to stop to go back on Sunday when
[2:15:19] we'll continue cuz I can feel the pull.
[2:15:22] If he has spoken to you this evening,
[2:15:25] don't leave as you came.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; The time is finished.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; We don't have more time.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; It is punto fin.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; It's over. Are you hearing me? The
[2:15:40] little bit of God you have in now to
[2:15:41] pull you is going to soon
[2:15:44] disappear and then the bride will have a
[2:15:47] revival quick short work.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; At that time you can't come.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; At that time you can't confess.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; At that time it's pass.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; It will be only a manifestation for the
[2:16:01] inside.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Amen.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz you now have your upper room
[2:16:06] experience
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; where the Holy Ghost takes over.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because whatever he is, we must
[2:16:13] rise. The prophet said we have to lift
[2:16:17] ourselves because what we have now can
[2:16:19] do it. What you think bring the lift?
[2:16:21] Conditions
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; the situation. And I am feeling it. The
[2:16:26] more I pray is the more I feel that
[2:16:28] darkness
[2:16:30] and people are just going through the
[2:16:31] motion and soon they will just like a
[2:16:34] truck that run out of gas
[2:16:38] tired.
[2:16:39] Can't keep going. They're losing
[2:16:42] whatever they had. Why? They did not had
[2:16:45] an experience with God to get the
[2:16:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; We can't keep saying that forever.
[2:16:51] Everything have time.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[2:16:56] Even our service have a time
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; to start and a time to end. Then why
[2:17:02] wouldn't God have a time
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; for you
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; and for your life? You can't keep
[2:17:07] playing with your soul.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The most important
[2:17:13] asset you have is your soul. And hear
[2:17:15] me? You can't blame God. He says you
[2:17:17] have a choice.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Nobody is without excuse. You are
[2:17:22] inexcusable. Amen.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Oh man,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; woman,
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; don't blame nobody.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; When everything is finished, you are the
[2:17:32] one to kneel there and talk to God. When
[2:17:34] everything is finished, you are the one
[2:17:35] to skate with your temper, with your
[2:17:37] malice, and whatever it is, you don't
[2:17:38] want to get rid of it.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; You
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; cause an individual affair,
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; not your pastor. You
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; I to get to business with God.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; There's no time for playing.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, boy.
[2:18:04] Before revival could start, there has to
[2:18:06] be a purge
[2:18:08] and there has to be a cleaning. And we
[2:18:11] cannot take it for granted that all is
[2:18:14] well until we go down in the bottom.
[2:18:16] That's where Gideon was before God came.
[2:18:20] He was down in the well, hiding,
[2:18:23] starving,
[2:18:25] barely surviving.
[2:18:27] And the angel said, "Oh, mighty man of
[2:18:30] God." And he shocked. He said, "Me
[2:18:31] mighty hiding down here."
[2:18:36] There is a power in the church.
[2:18:39] And the devil know that more than all of
[2:18:41] us.
[2:18:43] But I'm here to tell you, wake up. Arise
[2:18:47] and shine.
[2:18:50] Do what you have to do or whatever that
[2:18:52] is. Get right with God. Be certain of
[2:18:57] God. Whenever you make a vow, you say
[2:18:59] anything, mean it or don't say it.
[2:19:04] Then God will start hearing your prayer.
[2:19:07] Then God will start drawing near. Then
[2:19:10] you'll start getting a purpose in your
[2:19:13] life. Cuz this is not a myth. This is
[2:19:16] not talking. This is real. Faith is
[2:19:20] real. And before I leave, I would like
[2:19:23] to pray or see something happen for the
[2:19:27] sick.
[2:19:29] Oh, where's the brother that is sing?
[2:19:32] My sister, my daughter was telling me
[2:19:34] about his wife. I I I don't know. I have
[2:19:37] a problem. I just get compassion for
[2:19:40] people.
[2:19:42] And we God has given us the resources
[2:19:45] and the tools to pray these things out.
[2:19:48] But it begins with us
[2:19:51] as a church.
[2:19:53] It begins with you and I as individuals.
[2:19:57] A call to God.
[2:20:00] Dismantle unbelief. Run. Move from it.
[2:20:04] Don't play.
[2:20:08] May God bless you as we pray. Let's all
[2:20:10] stand.
[2:20:15] That song you sang, give me more. You
[2:20:19] all know it.
[2:20:21] You know it. Well, I want more. Could
[2:20:24] you come and sing it while we pray?
[2:20:27] Heavenly Father,
[2:20:29] I come to you this evening.
[2:20:32] Lord, I pray that somehow somebody will
[2:20:38] be touched. Lord, even if it's five, it
[2:20:42] will be worth it cuz that would be five
[2:20:45] changed individuals.
[2:20:48] I have asked you to help me and I've
[2:20:51] done just that. And I pray, oh God,
[2:20:53] you'll do the rest.
[2:20:56] I ask that you will change our desires
[2:21:00] and make them holy,
[2:21:03] change our thinking and make it right.
[2:21:06] Lord, there there are conditions here
[2:21:08] that has to be met. We can't go outside.
[2:21:10] We can't call the pope. We cannot call a
[2:21:12] priest. We have to call you.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; And therefore, we are praying, oh God,
[2:21:17] that you would intervene because it is
[2:21:19] your desire that we be well.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; It is your desire that we walk away,
[2:21:26] heal, delivered.
[2:21:29] It is your desire that we rejoice and be
[2:21:32] happy.
[2:21:34] It has never been your desire for us to
[2:21:36] suffer unnecessarily.
[2:21:39] And so let faith rise and build this
[2:21:42] evening and dismantle unbelief and let
[2:21:46] there be a purpose in the hearts of the
[2:21:47] people. Thank you for brother.
[2:21:50] I thank you for your servant. Not many
[2:21:53] are willing to stand with purpose and
[2:21:56] his mind fixed. I love that. Help us
[2:22:00] Lord. It's a very difficult time but
[2:22:03] it's in a very beautiful moment. Have
[2:22:06] your own now as I surrender them to you
[2:22:09] is my prayer in Jesus name.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:14] I hope I put you in trouble but I love
[2:22:16] that song.
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:26] Thank you Jesus.
[2:22:32] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:22:34] I know what it's like
[2:22:41] to be in the presence of the Lord.
[2:22:49] [Music]
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; And not know what time it is.
[2:22:59] Because time stood still
[2:23:08] and bodies were healed
[2:23:16] and families restored
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; because we stayed.
[2:23:27] here
[2:23:32] in the presence of the Lord.
[2:23:41] No one had to say a word.
[2:23:44] [Music]
[2:23:49] Couldn't even make a sound.
[2:23:58] But I give up everything
[2:24:06] for this treasure I found.
[2:24:10] [Laughter]

[2:40:34] who is man that you are, you are mindful
[2:40:36] of him. Uh Lord, that you would call us
[2:40:39] to this Lord. We Lord, we are ashamed of
[2:40:42] ourselves, Lord. Father, just like Job
[2:40:45] said, Lord, he abhore himself. Lord, we
[2:40:48] come to a place where we recognize that
[2:40:49] Lord, what we have is not enough. Lord
[2:40:52] Father, we need more tonight, Lord. We
[2:40:55] need more of your spirit, more of your
[2:40:57] power, more of you in our lives, Lord
[2:40:59] Father, to be more sincere, Lord, to be
[2:41:02] more real, Lord, to be more honest,
[2:41:04] Lord, Father.
[2:41:06] Lord, we just need more tonight.

[2:41:17] tonight, Reverend Timothy Redhead. Lord
[2:41:20] Father who preached such a wonderful
[2:41:22] powerful inspiration tonight. What a
[2:41:25] message from the Lord and how throughout
[2:41:27] the message Lord you used him mightily
[2:41:30] to dismantle unbelief Lord and Father to
[2:41:33] break it apart piece by piece. Lord the
[2:41:36] devil is now exposed fully tonight
[2:41:39] by the word of the living God. We thank
[2:41:42] you for your mercy to us Lord. We thank
[2:41:45] you, Lord, that in an age like this
[2:41:47] Lord, so dark, so dreary, that you could
[2:41:50] bring a word like this to us tonight, to
[2:41:53] help us to get into perfection, to get
[2:41:56] into adoption, to get into all these
[2:41:58] glorious promises that you have laid in
[2:42:01] store for us in these end time. Lord,
[2:42:02] Father, help us to be real Christians,
[2:42:05] Lord, or no Christians at all. Father,
[2:42:08] we thank you for your servant tonight.
[2:42:10] We pray anointing would bathe him down
[2:42:12] tonight, Father, with the with the
[2:42:14] presence of God, Lord. May your heal and
[2:42:15] virtue, may your strength, your
[2:42:17] anointing pour into him tonight. We are
[2:42:20] grateful tonight, Lord, for your
[2:42:22] ministry here, Father, for the word that
[2:42:24] was preached here tonight. We pray you
[2:42:25] bless your servant, Lord. We anoint him
[2:42:27] and continue to inspire him, Lord, as he
[2:42:30] comes and ministers with us here by the
