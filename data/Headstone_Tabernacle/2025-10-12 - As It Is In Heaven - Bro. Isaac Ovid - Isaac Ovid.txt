Can I tell it all this morning? Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's just turn to Psalms 107. Amen. Reading from verses 1-9. Hallelujah. [Music] Psalms 107 it says, "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endured forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he had redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way. They found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted in them. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Would that men would praise God for his goodness, for his wondrous works to the children of men, for he satisfied the lonely soul and he filled the hungry soul with goodness. Amen. Play that song. Jehovah Gyra my provider. You are more than enough. Let's just for prayer this morning. We thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your mercy and your love.

Yes, you can do better than that. He is worthy. From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, his name is worthy to be praised. There's none like him. There's none like him. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Don't stop now. He inhabits the praises of his people. He loves it when we worship. He loves it when you lift your hands. Brother Brandham said, "You defy the laws of gravity. When you lift your hands, you let the world know you are a creature of eternity. We don't belong here." Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning that we could be gathered in your house one more time. Lord, there's truly no place we'd rather be, Father. Lord, we don't take it for granted, Lord. There are many people who did not wake up this morning. There are many people who died in their sleep. There are many people who did not make it through the night. But we are here this morning, Lord, by divine purpose, by divine decree, by your divine will. Lord, we are the expression of your will, Father. Lord, without your grace, we would not stand here this morning. And Lord, we don't want to take it for granted ever. Lord, there's nothing we could do to ever deserve this. There's nothing we could do to be qualified for this. But your grace and your mercy and your love reach from eternity, Lord, into this dimension, Lord. And you are able to call us, Father, because our names were already written, Father. You are not now calling this morning. You are not now choosing this morning, Lord. It is because we are seed, Lord, we could be reborn. It's because we are seed we could come to this gospel. It's because we are seed we could receive more from you. Because we are seed, every demon in hell has to bend, has to break, has to bow, Lord. You said every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess that you are Lord. You are Lord of our lives. You are Lord of our homes. You are Lord of our physical bodies. You are Lord of our minds. You are Lord of every circumstance. Lord, may you speak to us from your word this morning. May you take me out of the way and may you speak lip to ear to your people. We are totally and completely dependent upon you. May you walk out the pages of the Bible, Lord. And may you reveal yourself to us. There are many in here this morning with different needs, different situations, different problems, whatever it might be. Lord, may you minister to each one at the point of their need. I don't know what the need is, but you know the needs this morning. May May you speak to your people this morning. May you take me out of the way. May you bless those that are here physically, Lord. And Lord, those that are not here that are connected online. May the angel of the Lord, the presence of the Lord visit them where they might be. We commit this service over to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I'd like to welcome you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And while you're standing, uh, if you have your Bibles, would you turn with me to two portions of scripture, we want to read from Matthew 6. Thank you, brother Jason. Thank you, musicians. Matthew 6 and reading from verse 9. and Revelation 4 reading from verse one. Matthew 6 and from verse 9. After this manner, therefore pray ye. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen. And let's read from Revelation 4 and from verse one. After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." And immediately I was in the spirit. And behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and 20 seats. And upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raignment. And they had on their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like unto crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him, and they were full of eyes within, and they rest not day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and is and is to come." And when those beasts gave glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth forever and ever, the four and 20 elders fall down before him and sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning. Certainly a great privilege to be able to gather in the house of God because we are spiritual beings. We are not natural beings. We walk amongst natural people, but we are spiritual class of people. We are a God class of people. So we are a little lower than the angels when it comes to who we are in terms of our ancestry or genealogy or spiritual genealogy. We are not created above the animals. We are spiritual beings here on the earth to have a reflection of God's power, his grace, his will, and to prove to the devil that we will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; And the fact that we cannot be deceived is because we are the elect of God. The elect of God not by our own election, but we are the elect of God by his election, his choosing and his calling. And his calling and his choosing is not a present tense activity. It is something that took place before the foundation of the world. Because the Bible said speaks in past tense. For who he forneew, he called. Past tense. Who we called, he justified. Past tense. And who we justify, he hath already glorified. So the way God sees us is very different from the way we see ourselves. We woke up this morning and we see a fallen man. We see a man that is dealing with pains and aches and trials and bills and and situations and circumstances. But when God looks through the barrier between time and eternity, he sees you as an eternal being. One who rotated off of his presence. &gt;&gt; He sees you in the state that you are as representation by predestination. He sees you because you there's a theophony and this physical element that we call our bodies is just a house for the soul. That's the real who we are. That if we were to put down this mortal body, there's another body waiting for us. So death does not intimidate us. Sickness does not intimidate us. And we are very clear that there's a God above us who is bigger than our situation, who is bigger than our circumstance, a God of miracles, a God of the impossible, a God who is able to transform and to change and to take someone who knows nothing about him. Because when we come into this world, we forgot where we came from. When we were born, we forgot our ancestry. So God had to tell Job, Job, where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth and the morning stars sang together. And the sons of God shouted for joy because there were some people who were there. And because they were there, they could be represented here. Despite their trials, their tribulations, their testing, the opposition, despite your feeling, despite your mind battles, despite your insecurities, and what went wrong this morning, we're not speaking about what went wrong. We're not speaking about what happened yesterday or last month. We are going back to eternity. We back before time because only if you are eternal, you can be part of the eternity. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So because we are eternal beings trapped in time. Hallelujah. We are subject to the elements of time. But it doesn't change who we are. That's why the broth could speak plainly. You are not the believer. But the word seed in you, that eternal seed that had no beginning and could have no ending, that seed speaks for you. That seed is the seed that brought you to church this morning. You didn't drive to church this morning. You didn't you didn't wake up and say, "I'm feeling to go to church." That seed wants to be here. That seed. Is there anybody in the house this morning? You may be seated. I'm just having a conversation with you before I get into the word because the challenge is we are suffering from an identity crisis. &gt;&gt; This is not just a world issue. It's a issue in the church. It's a issue in homes. It's an issue in marriages. It's an issue in families. If you do not know who you are, what you are, what you are called to do, you will be abusive to yourself, abusive to your purpose. If you don't know what a hammer is, you will take a microphone. If you don't know what a microphone is for, you can take a microphone and hit it because you want to pound a nail &gt;&gt; because you don't understand the purpose of the thing. &gt;&gt; But when you understand the purpose of the thing, you treat it a certain way. &gt;&gt; But you have to have a revelation of the thing. &gt;&gt; If I take a bag of money and a banana and put it in front of a monkey, he will take the banana and run. Although the bag of money could buy a million bananas, &gt;&gt; because he doesn't understand the purpose of the thing, he treats it casually. &gt;&gt; And many of us, we don't understand the spiritual purpose of the thing. &gt;&gt; This thing called faith, that is the substance of what we hoping for. We hold on to our paychecks. We hold on to our jobs. But faith is worth more than your job. Faith is worth more than your paycheck. Faith could produce a better job. You hold on to the thing because you think the thing is what you're fighting for, but faith could replace the thing. Faith could transform the thing. You hold on to the good report of the doctor, but faith reaches to a higher report, the report of the Lord that could every single time beat the report of the doctor. I don't know if you're hearing me this morning. Faith is the substance of what we are hoping for. It's the evidence of what we cannot see. By faith, Abraham. By faith, Noah. By faith, Moses. By faith, you are here this morning. You came by faith because you believe something could change. &gt;&gt; You don't know what, but you believe something could change. What's the good coming to church if you don't want to get changed? We are not here to waste time. Oh, somebody preach back to me. &gt;&gt; So, it took faith to put on your tie this morning. It took faith to get dressed. It took faith to look in the mirror and say, "This works. It took faith to drive up the road even though it's rain, even though it's traffic, even though you're feeling sick. There are people out here this morning, they're in pain, but they're in the house because they have faith that God is a healer. They have faith that the purpose of God by election might stand. They have faith that the doctor could be waiting to perform the surgery. But before the doctor's hand touches my wife, before the doctor begins to operate on you, the tumor could be dissolved. The sickness could be dealt with. The issue could be taken care of. That's what faith is. Faith gives you a confidence. Faith makes you speak different. Faith makes you change your outlook on life. Anybody in the house this morning? Hallelujah. We preach in a little bit, but I want to encourage you. The Bible says, "By faith, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter." For all of his life, that is how he was known. That was his identification. This is Pharaoh's daughter son. This is Pharaoh's daughter's son. But by faith, it was not just a declaration. It took faith for him to make the statement, "Don't call me that." He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He said, "That's not my name. That's not who I am. That's not my identity. That name is not tied to my purpose. When you call me that, I know that's not who I am." Hallelujah. And you are not a child of this world. You are not a son of Satan. You are not serpent seed. You are not a failure. That's not your name. You are not sick. Arthritis is not your name. Cancer is not your name. High blood pressure is not your name. Fornication is not your name. Adultery is not your name. Your past is not your identification. We refuse by faith this morning to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. Brother said, "I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandom. I refuse to be identified by who my parents are. My natural parents, he saw himself as a son of God. I come from God and I go back to God. I don't care who your father is, your grandfather, your greatgrandfather. We reject that natural bloodline and we refuse that natural bloodline and accept the genealogy of God because in that genealogy as healing, &gt;&gt; deliverance, breakthrough, freedom, power and attitude. In there is humility. In there is love. In there is faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and confidence to say no to the devil. We reject sickness this morning. We reject our past this morning. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Is there not a cause?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there enough situations &gt;&gt; that should push us to become more serious. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said, "If love doesn't get us desperate, then conditions will." &gt;&gt; Situations will come in and around our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why wait for God to break your foot to say, "Lord, I need you." &gt;&gt; Why wait for a crisis to say, "Lord, I need you." &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "What we see should put our souls into action &gt;&gt; to make a church." God is not making the church. He builds the church. He gives the foundation of the church, but the making of the church, the work of making the church is on the believers &gt;&gt; because God wants to have a perfect church. &gt;&gt; A church that sin cannot stay in the church. A church that sickness cannot stay in the church. a church that if you want to come, it's because you're serious about coming. Because I'm persuaded that people do what they want to do. [Music] &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; It's a choice. I'm just having a conversation. We'll preach. Today's Sunday. We have said it before. Sundays is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Buckle your seat belt. We here &gt;&gt; because we have some needs to pray for. We have some demons to deal with. We have some situation that must be resolved because we have a responsibility. This age is like no other age. What we could do, Moses could not do. What we could do, not even whether Brandham could do because this is the last age. And the spirit, the prophet, and the bride will say the same thing. There's a power that's going to be put into the church of the living God. Not a power for us to be church members, but for a power to live a holy life. A power to reject sin. A power to live holy. A power to speak to your situation and see your situation dealt with. A power to take us back to Eden. A power to have dominion over yourself before you could have dominion over other things and other situations. [Applause] A power to stand. And that power comes by overcoming. To him that overcome it will I make a pillar in the house of my God and he shall go no more out. You struggling with backsliding. You need to overcome some more. May God give you the strength to overcome. Overcome lying, overcome doubt, overcome your mind. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; For a title this morning, I want to take a title from that scripture we read from the Lord's Prayer. As it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; That was the Lord's prayer. Thy will be done on earth &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Because I could guarantee in heaven God's will is established. &gt;&gt; That's what he loved about David. He said, "David is a man after my own heart, and he shall do all of my will. Can the church say amen? Everybody feeling fine? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And then we read with John where the Lord called John. And maybe I'll start there before I go back to the beginning where we read the scripture and this is where John was on the aisle of Patmos. He was in exile. &gt;&gt; That's right. He was on an island with criminals, murderers, bandits, all kind of manner of people. And he was there not because he had done a crime. He was there because he was preaching this gospel. &gt;&gt; They tried to do everything they could do. They tried to boil him in oil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you put your finger in oil in burning oil, you know what has happened? &gt;&gt; They tried to boil John and that didn't work. Amen. &gt;&gt; You imagine &gt;&gt; the Bible say you'll pick up deadly thing and it wouldn't harm you. &gt;&gt; They they get so frustrated with John they throw John in exile. That's right. &gt;&gt; John is there by himself. The Bible doesn't tell us if there was a deacon, there was an elder, there was a minister. John is there by himself in exile. And in those days, exile wasn't a nice thing. It was a laboral kind of camp. &gt;&gt; You're working. But in the middle there, the Bible said that behold, a door was open in heaven, &gt;&gt; and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, said, "Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." And immediately I was in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Church, if the voice ever speaks to you, you cast out the spirit. &gt;&gt; He was in exile, but he got in the spirit when the voice got to him. I could tell when you heard from the voice. Because when you hear from the voice, immediately you're in the spirit. Because you cannot get anything from God if you're not in the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's impossible. But when that voice came to John, he was in the spirit. Hallelujah. I pray to God that the voice speaks to you this morning. Not the voice of the preacher, not my voice, but that same voice that said, "Let there be." That same voice that said, "Let there be light." And there was light. That same voice that called this one and that one say Peter come James come Gideon thou mighty man of valor told the prophet you will forun hallelujah the second coming that same voice is still speaking this morning can the church say amen &gt;&gt; and that voice says come up hithermen &gt;&gt; come up higher &gt;&gt; don't get on in the carnal realm don't don't drop your level God doesn't come down to our level can the church say amen he pulls us higher &gt;&gt; you need to rise above your problems. This is not positive selft talk. You need to rise above your situation. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; To see things that are meant to be, &gt;&gt; things that supposed to be thereafter. And God was showing John a picture of heaven. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; 24 elders, four beasts, throne, cherubims, structure. In other words, heaven has a structure. &gt;&gt; Heaven has a layout. &gt;&gt; It's not a random thing. Let me put the thing here and let me do this here. No. God has a structure. Heaven is structured. There are cherubims, seven lamps. It's not 92 lamps. No, it's seven lamps. &gt;&gt; Flames of fire. Can the church say amen? Seven stars, seven horns, seven golden candlesticks. There's a structure, there's a order, there's a divine order that is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? [Applause] &gt;&gt; What makes heaven heaven is the expression of God's will. &gt;&gt; That's what makes it heaven. Because in heaven, God's will alone is the will that stands. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me this morning? I'm saying a few things to help us. So God, we know existed all alone. LR Elohim. He couldn't even be called God because God means object of worship. So without anyone to worship him, he wasn't called God. He was just ll Elohim, self-existing one. Can the church say amen? So he created the angels. He created structure that man wasn't privy to because man was still in the thoughts of God. But in this form, we couldn't appreciate it. But we were there before there was a beginning. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? And the angels were there operating. &gt;&gt; And we look in the book of Genesis in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be." And God, who was his word? His word was the expression of his will. His will produced what the word was. &gt;&gt; John would say in the beginning the same parallel of Genesis to say in the beginning was the word and the word was God and the word was with God. And we know these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Word speaks to nature. Last Wednesday we speaking about the nature, the divine nature. Somebody says something funny, you'll have to say that person. If every time you see somebody they say something funny, you'll say, "Well, that person is funny. That's that's right. Right. You meet a comedian. Words are powerful. &gt;&gt; The comedian speak once, twice, and everything he say is a joke. &gt;&gt; You leave with an identification of the person. Even if you don't know his name, &gt;&gt; you will say that man is funny. &gt;&gt; His character becomes visible by virtue of his words. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; When a man and every time you meet him, he talks serious serious serious. You never laugh. You You're okay. That man's a serious man, boy. Because his words express who he is &gt;&gt; and the more you speak that's why the Bible say even a fool when he is silent &gt;&gt; is considered wise &gt;&gt; because only when you open your mouth &gt;&gt; we already know who you are &gt;&gt; the old people say listen twice and talk &gt;&gt; because that's biblical. If you stay quiet, nobody will know you don't know. &gt;&gt; Nobody will know. This is why in school they say, "Don't stay quiet. Let us know you don't know." So we could give you the correction. People sit in your class and they don't know and they're saying anything. &gt;&gt; Other school teachers used to say there's big shame and small shame. &gt;&gt; He said big shame is when you write the exam and you don't know. Small shame is when they put it behind in class and say I don't know. He said, "Choose your shame." &gt;&gt; We thank God for good teachers &gt;&gt; who could bring context to things so we could appreciate things. &gt;&gt; I was sharing with my daughter. I had a math teacher. When he's standing in front of the class, he say, "Everybody like to watch television." Everybody put up your behind. He say, "Fantastic." He went on the board, draw a TV and had to do all the math inside the TV. &gt;&gt; But he had a real heart to see people learn, to see people grow. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so too God in his complexity because God is big. &gt;&gt; He is complex. There are many aspects of God. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for almighty God to have expressed himself all at once. So God had to unveil himself over time. &gt;&gt; But only when he took that word became flesh and the expression of complexity was now veiled in simplicity in the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same Jesus will say, "Let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Because Jesus understands the principle that will is powerful. &gt;&gt; When a young person backslides, the issue is will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They want to see their will expressed. &gt;&gt; This is what I want. My will is to do this. Because when you look to Lucifer, the Bible says there was structure until Lucifer. There was there was error found in Lucifer and we call it the five I wills. &gt;&gt; I will be like the most high. I will. So what it was was an expression of will. &gt;&gt; The challenge today in society is people want their will. So there's a conflict of wills. When there's a government election, this is why the kingdom of God could have no election. &gt;&gt; Because a governmental natural election is a conflict of will, our will, if given the opportunity, would be to do this. &gt;&gt; And if given the opportunity would be to do this, it's a conflict of wills. But with God, it's only one will, his will. &gt;&gt; And when his will is established, everything is perfect. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. If his will is guiding your life, you will never find yourself in a place that God can't keep you. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; In a home, if the husband and the wife have two different wills, that house is a war zone. &gt;&gt; Run for cover. Hide here. Do this. Don't come in here. Why? Is a conflict of wills. &gt;&gt; Every conflict in your life is a conflict of wills. &gt;&gt; Why the bank doing so? The bank has a will. The bank say you have to do it this way, in this way, in this way, in this way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I want it to be so that your will or &gt;&gt; so. So Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane say Lord not my will &gt;&gt; but thy will be done. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you understand the principle of the will of God, then simple baby stuff like how to dress and how to act, those no longer become issues &gt;&gt; because your will should become his will. &gt;&gt; All you want to do is Lord, whatever you want from me, that's what I want. Send me, Lord, where you want me to go? I want to go. I don't care where it is. I don't care what I have to give up. Lord, not my will, but thy will be done. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done on earth as it is &gt;&gt; in heaven. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; I trust this is helping in some way. &gt;&gt; Because in this life we live in the problems we run into is when we run against the will of God. &gt;&gt; There's no example in scripture and and we talk about now perfect will and permissive will. &gt;&gt; That's this issue of wills. You end up in doing set of foolishnesses and then God still allow it to work out. But he there's a perfect will for your life. &gt;&gt; Many people run ahead of God. They try to do their own thing and then they hope it works out. That is taking risk. That is unnecessary risk. God don't take risk or no. God is the best risk manager you could ever take. He swore by himself. He didn't even get another party to the contract to ensure that what he said will come to pass. He said the first covenant man broke it. So I'm not taking any chance with no other man. I will do it myself. He swore by himself. He said in blessing I will bless thee. In multiplying I will multiply thy seed because my will will be established. And no demon, no devil, no principality, no power to come against my will. His will is to see a perfect church. His will is to see sin out of your life. His will is to see you heal from the crown of your head to the soles of his feet. And every demon that stands against the will of God, God will do it for himself. You don't hear me this morning. We pray, but God has an agenda to defend his will. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't hear me this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why when you fall, you cannot stay backsliden. &gt;&gt; His will brings you back. His will lifts you up. &gt;&gt; He said, "My will." Oh, come on now. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The existence of heaven began with the will of God expressed through the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The moment he willed it, the word was spoken to make it happen. &gt;&gt; It could not just remain a will. Will had to be expressed as a word &gt;&gt; because your will is what you want to see. &gt;&gt; Will is an expression of what you want to achieve. &gt;&gt; Will speaks to your intent. &gt;&gt; So God had an intent. He had a purpose. He had a motive. And he didn't leave it just as will &gt;&gt; but it became word &gt;&gt; and that word became expression. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; In other words, the word is God's visible thought. &gt;&gt; We say a thought brother said is a word expressed &gt;&gt; or a word is a thought expressed &gt;&gt; is a connection there because if you think it and this is why how you speak determines your future. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Bible study, we were asking the question, who are the people in your life? Because it's not just about proximity. It's really about words. &gt;&gt; Because the people in your life could say, "Let's go to a party or let's go to a prayer meeting." Or the people could say, "You're going to make it or you're not going to make it." Or the people could say, "Keep on pressing." Or, "You don't need to do that." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What Satan said to Eve was, "What did God say? &gt;&gt; Are you sure? Well, I have a different perspective. It was a conversation. So, words are important. If you are connected to the word of God about your life, forget it. Then nothing could shake you. &gt;&gt; And if you repeat the words of the Lord every day in your life, then your mind becomes honed on the word of the Lord. I shall be healed. That's what happened to the man that brother Brandon prayed for. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon prayed for the man &gt;&gt; and he came back for prayer again. And brother say, I don't need to pray for you again. I pray for you already. But he didn't have faith. And the solution to building faith was to just say it all the time. By stripes I'm healed. By stripes I'm heals. He say keep saying it over and over and over and over and over until one day it moved from an intellectual understanding of by stripes I'm healed to the word became a reflection of who he was. He and the word became one and all of a sudden he was healed. But if you live every day, but is Christianing hard and are going through a rough time and listen, when you accept rough time as part of the journey, you see beyond that, you don't make that the issue. We will never promise a bed of ease. We will never promise to have it easy. We will never promise to have a red carpet. &gt;&gt; We were promised a training ground to fight the devil. The battle is still ahead. Listen, if God wanted to end the devil, he could have done it a long time. But he refused to do it because he wants you to do it. He wants me to do it. It is his will that his wife, his bride, take possession of the earth. Why? Because the heaven is the jurisdiction of the Lord. But this earth belongs to us. &gt;&gt; It is our jurisdiction. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to see a picture, church. &gt;&gt; Heaven is the Lord's jurisdiction. It's not ours. &gt;&gt; We're not trying to go to heaven to stay there. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said we shall reign where? &gt;&gt; So reigning is not in heaven for us. It's on the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a partnership because in Eden before the fall, heaven and earth was in unity. &gt;&gt; God's will was in heaven as it was in the earth. &gt;&gt; There was no need for the Lord's prayer at that time because his will was already established in heaven and on earth. &gt;&gt; It is because man fell. We need to pray thy will be done on heaven and on earth. But in Eden, there was no need for the prayer because the will of God was established in heaven and established on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are getting back to there. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Nothing is by accident. &gt;&gt; Nothing is by chance. And when we see it through the whole picture, it begins to make sense. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because in God's perfect heaven, &gt;&gt; Lucifer, &gt;&gt; a creation &gt;&gt; of the creator, &gt;&gt; express will. &gt;&gt; Boldface. Thank you punch. &gt;&gt; He boldface express will &gt;&gt; he created to worship. But he say but this thing this worship thing. Why all have to go to God? And there was war in heaven. &gt;&gt; So I want us to remember heaven isn't our jurisdiction. &gt;&gt; But as it is in heaven is on the earth. &gt;&gt; War in heaven. We were represented there. &gt;&gt; Spirits rotating off of God. We were part of the war &gt;&gt; to reclaim heaven to kick out the devil's will &gt;&gt; and reestablish God's will. You don't hear me this morning. We were represented there. When Michael drew his sword, all of the seeds who rotated off of God were there drawing their swords. We went to war for the jurisdiction of heaven. It was God and his Oh, come on now. God and his family fighting to reclaim heaven. And what did we do? We kicked the devil out of heaven. And the Bible said there was no place found for him there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What did God do? &gt;&gt; He showed the expression of his creation. &gt;&gt; He showed the power of free will, &gt;&gt; the power of the angels to decide because there were angels who sided with Lucifer and they were all kicked out of heaven. &gt;&gt; God clean house as it were. And the war of angels became the war of men. &gt;&gt; So heaven is under its correct leadership. But the earth, there's a war going on this morning. The family of God fought with Michael to reclaim heaven. Now Michael himself, has come down to fight with us to reclaim our jurisdiction. Heaven has already been sorted out. It's time to sort out the earth as it is in heaven. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why church, the devil can't just destroy the devil. Sorry, God can't just destroy the devil like that because he don't want to. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was under Michael's leadership &gt;&gt; that it was cleared up in heaven. &gt;&gt; But on the earth now, it has to be the bride leadership &gt;&gt; because the earth belongs to his wife. &gt;&gt; So Michael supports the bride. When we were there, the bride was supporting Michael. But on the earth, this is our jurisdiction. So the angels have come to back us up. But we have to lead the charge. Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Let me make sure you leave with it the picture clear in Eden before the fall. &gt;&gt; Heaven, earth, &gt;&gt; perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; God could walk &gt;&gt; and say it was good. &gt;&gt; He saw the reflection of heaven and earth. He saw the order established in heaven expressed on earth. In fact, when you go through scripture, when God met Moses to give instruction about building the tabernacle, what did he do? He said, I will show you the dimensions and the structure from the blueprint I've used in heaven. &gt;&gt; You're not building it the way you want. What I want on heaven is what I want established on earth. And God met with Moses and see the wall here. I want the wall this way. And I want you to use these stones. And I want you to put the throne here. And you're going to put the holy of holies here. And you say, "This is the exact way it's in heaven. I want heaven and earth to be always connected. Heaven is my throne. The earth is my foottool. Heaven is my jurisdiction. The earth belongs to you. You shall reign on the earth, kings and priests." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the battle of angels &gt;&gt; is now the battle of men. &gt;&gt; So angels don't lead us except the mighty angel, &gt;&gt; the Lord himself &gt;&gt; because he is the head of the body. But his leadership is to put us into power &gt;&gt; because he is the great king maker &gt;&gt; because he says we are kings. &gt;&gt; We are priests. &gt;&gt; He's the king of kings. He's the lord of lords. He's the high priest of our confession. He is leading the way for us to step into the way. So you can say the spirit, the prophet and the bride will say the same thing. God is a spirit. Prophet prophets through the ages pointing to people to the same thing to bring them to our realization of what belongs to us. No other age could have claimed jurisdiction like we can. &gt;&gt; Why must I be sad &gt;&gt; and depressed and allow some movie, some show something somebody say who say they go do me and think &gt;&gt; angels are servants. You know, &gt;&gt; we are sons. &gt;&gt; Angels work for us. &gt;&gt; God does the salaries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the angels are encamped &gt;&gt; around them that fear him. &gt;&gt; They can't leave. They can't move. They they know they are on assignment. Because once sons are identified, angels have to be there. The moment you were born, angels with dispatch for your protection. The moment you were born, when you leave church, it's even here. Angels in front of you, angels at the side of you. goodness and mercy following you. You are a moto kid all by yourself. You walk Frederick Street and there's a motocade around you. [Applause] I had to pass in the mall yesterday briefly and I'm passing and I see two people and I did a double take because some of you see someone in a different environment and you don't connect it at first. It was when I passed them I realized oh that is our former prime minister's wife and daughter unassuming quiet. And I said to my wife, in the US, this will never be because once you leave office, you don't lose secret service. &gt;&gt; We are real casual in this country. Maybe you're a small country, so maybe you walk the street, you see a minister, government normally just going in the car, normal, normal. In the States, you'll never see that. What kind of security when you walk out your house, if you could see the movements outside your house, when you step out the house, You see when our prime minister driving, the president driving is all kind of siren, flashing car, motorbike, they almost want to bounce you down, pull aside here and when you look is the prime minister coming down three, four, five vehicle and some motorbike and thing when you get out of your house if you see motorbike, &gt;&gt; if you see car and listen, we not like Trinidad in the States, they have plane and helicopter. You have helicopter too. &gt;&gt; Is angels dealing with it? No. Angels flying above. Air surveillance. Making sure your path clear. Turn left. Turn right. Hold here. Don't do this. Somebody just feel something. You just feel a pause. And is the angel held you back. Don't go yet. Something ahead. Not for you. Not now. Move now. Angels. Why? You're coming into power. [Music] You may be seated. &gt;&gt; In the US, once election date is over, brother Clark, the moment what they call the presidentelect is known, &gt;&gt; he not in office yet because there's a swearing in ceremony. &gt;&gt; In the spiritual realm, we call it adoption. &gt;&gt; The adoption ceremony. But before the adoption ceremony, once you are identified as president-elect, in other words, they know you are the next president. It's a few days before you take office and get a car and get a plane and move with a punch. You need to pack your things and get it into the White House. You can't just walk in today without your things. They need to prepare the room. They need to ask you what you want for breakfast. Oh, come on now. Somebody help me. What do you like for dinner? The White House chef need to get ready to prepare your favorite meal. You don't hear me this morning. But the moment the election results are in and you are identified as president-elect, your whole life changes. &gt;&gt; And the moment you are born and you are identified as predestinated, &gt;&gt; your life has never been the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to build your feet. so that we could reach a point that we're not having baby conversations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And scriptur is like present your bodies a living sacrifice, &gt;&gt; holy and acceptable unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; When the Bible say it is your reasonable service. &gt;&gt; You know what reasonable mean? &gt;&gt; Anybody know? No big thing. Thank you, brother George. &gt;&gt; Reasonable service. The Bible say to present your bodies a living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And people still struggling. How in 2025, brother Blackman, help me. Could covering your knees be a struggle. There's a big heart trial for you there and you're stressed out about this thing and the people in the work and you don't know what they will say and they just talk about you and it has hurt my feelings and and are you that weak &gt;&gt; and my nails and and and so go ahead make it good. So what they're telling me, God didn't do a good job. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find with a black man a way for people to see that those are the petty things because what we're talking about is taking leadership. &gt;&gt; I shared in the youth meeting in France that the queen of England, Lord bless her soul, when she was on the earth, you never see her in a miniskirt. &gt;&gt; Search, &gt;&gt; no pants. Why? &gt;&gt; She was in the message secretly. In the night she there reading talking with books. &gt;&gt; She was very secure in her identity &gt;&gt; and she understood the principle that as a queen I dress a certain way. I speak a certain way. There are places I do not go. There are things I do not do. There are people I don't have conversation with. Not because I'm better than anybody. But I'm a queen. So her confidence and the way she lives is a function of her identity. &gt;&gt; And this is why I say the issue with us is we have an identity crisis. &gt;&gt; Because the moment you cannot stand up and say I am a Christian, &gt;&gt; there are things I do, there are things I do not do. Take this as it is. Deal with it as it is. &gt;&gt; These are the terms of the engagement. These are the terms. If you don't want me as your friend because I'm a Christian, then I'm happy to not be your friend because we can't go to the same place. &gt;&gt; How could two walk unless they are in agreement? That's scripture. [Music] &gt;&gt; And this is why I say be real church. It has to be a point. This is not just in the spiritual. You want to save, save. &gt;&gt; I'm struggling to save. I'm struggling to save. And I sure if you audit your finances and you take out one extra bag of fries, &gt;&gt; you just when they say you want to upsize, you say, "Nah, just leave it low size." I don't know what talking to. I see people getting convicted. This is not a movement against fast food, &gt;&gt; but we're talking about a principle of choice &gt;&gt; because people do what they want to do. &gt;&gt; People will say they tired, they tired, they tired, they tired for work, they're tired for work. Carnival time I see people go and fet until 4:00 in the morning and they have to be in work the next day and they bre dragging itself to work &gt;&gt; because they can't afford to miss the fat and they take a loan to go the fet. A year later, they're still paying for the &gt;&gt; fed. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are making this up. You know, this is true thing. &gt;&gt; And people don't want to make sacrifice for the Lord because they don't see the value. &gt;&gt; When you understand the value of something, you treat something with value a certain kind of way. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] One time the Lord told the prophet, I think he was going onto the platform and he had a book and he put the book on top of the Bible. Anybody hear that one? &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Don't rest that on that thing." You know, &gt;&gt; my word is too val. Take that off. &gt;&gt; God is looking at it. Some of the things we do casually. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't even know where our Bible is. &gt;&gt; I say don't use the phone and iPad for quick things, but where's your Bible? &gt;&gt; Where do you store it? &gt;&gt; If the lights are off in your house, could you find it? Because if that is your best defense, cuz there are many stories of people I know home invasion and they plead the blood, Lord Jesus, help me. And the bandits don't even know what happened. They say we left. Yes. Because we don't know what we dealing with. &gt;&gt; Do you have faith in God and his word to protect you? &gt;&gt; Do you treat his word as sacred? Do you treat the house of God as sacred? Do you treat the things of God as sacred? Do you treat a service as sacred? Or you say, "Well, we going to church because we No, this is sacred. This is the pathway to get out of this world and to get to glory. &gt;&gt; We are too casual about these things and the conversations we get into like Eve is what creates the problem. &gt;&gt; Until as we said on Friday night, God had to ask, "Who told you you were naked?" God didn't tell you that. &gt;&gt; He didn't hear that on Sunday's message. &gt;&gt; Who told you you were naked? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody spoke to you. Somebody told you you're not good enough. Somebody telling you you're wasting time. Somebody tell you it's okay to go to the party and it's okay to dress like that and you don't need to be that kind of a Christian and that church too strict. Who told you that? Because God didn't tell us that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I trust this helps. I'm having a conversation this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I know in heaven God's will is perfect. It's established. No angel is out of order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody moving things around. And let me shift the throne here and this. You know what I feel in lead is not seven lamps. Let's say we move one lamb the next side of the room. No, it don't work like that. &gt;&gt; God has a divine order. He has a divine structure. He every single thing he does has a meaning. There's a purpose behind it. There's a purpose for communion. &gt;&gt; Will I in the message really take communion? What? What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; When the Bible says do this in remembrance of me, this is not brother Brandham say this. &gt;&gt; This is scripture said do this. In fact, when Peter was questioning what was going on &gt;&gt; and he said, "Lord, how you could wash my feet?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Peter say, and the Lord said to Peter, "Peter, if I don't do this, you have no part of me." &gt;&gt; All years you've been with me. If you don't fulfill this, you have no part of me. &gt;&gt; When Peter heard that, he said, "Lord, don't just wash my foot. Come on. &gt;&gt; Wash everything because I want to be part. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What are you doing, preacher? Rebuilding the altar. &gt;&gt; Setting the place in order. &gt;&gt; Setting lives in order. Setting homes in order. There's a will of God for the way a home operates. There's a will of God for how fathers operate, how mothers operate, how children operate, how deacons operate, how elders operate, how ushers operate, how ministers operate, how sons and daughters of God operate. And there is no excuse for that standard because it's not our standard as it is in heaven. It is God's standard. [Applause] Thy will be done on earth &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; There's a quote where by brother man said you can miss work but don't miss church. &gt;&gt; But we like to turn down the volume on some of these things. &gt;&gt; I say it don't have to work. I just going from the word and I'm looking at effort and balance because yes life evolves but what is your sacrifice because people sacrifice for all kind of thing. &gt;&gt; You talk long enough to brother Terren to brother George they will tell you about late coming if you give them the opportunity they will go down into it &gt;&gt; but I can guarantee you many people who come late for church not they're not late for working &gt;&gt; you know why &gt;&gt; they just write you up But George saying come on. I trying to reverse. He's saying drive. &gt;&gt; The car have two wheels here. &gt;&gt; But because people don't see consequences. The Bible said judgment begins where? Not in the party in the &gt;&gt; fetal. &gt;&gt; The Bible said judgment begins in the house of God. &gt;&gt; You have to want to become serious about this thing. &gt;&gt; This is not about the church. Brother, brother Isaac, the ministry. This is you and God wanting to do all that you could do because you want your heart right with God. I'm not trying to rebuke you. I'm trying to encourage you. Come up hither. Because that's what God said to John. Come up hither. Come up higher. I know. I know you're in trouble. I know you're on the aisle of Patmos. I know you're oppressed, but come up hither. Let me show you things that are to be. Let me show you there's a greater world. Let me show you there's more than your present circumstance. Come up hither. Come up higher. Let us climb higher. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Climb into the realm of the Holy Ghost. Till you could be in the house of God and you could say, "I'm not sitting in hellstone tabernacle. I'm seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; His growth, his development, his progress. &gt;&gt; There's an author Malcolm Gladwell. He wrote a few books. And one of them is a book called outliers. He did a study of successful people and across the board. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Beth Hovind. He went across many different disciplines to try to find what is the pattern that unites them all &gt;&gt; to help them achieve success. And one of the elements that was common in every single one of these cases that became what might be called masters of their field was a principle he called 10,000 hours. He said across the board they spent at least 10,000 hours pursuing the course of the field or the study that he became masters in. &gt;&gt; And he was showing that unless you are willing to put in the effort to achieve something. &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with degree and education. &gt;&gt; It has to do with effort towards purpose. &gt;&gt; Because I've seen many people with no education become extremely successful. But what is consistent is they put effort behind purpose. &gt;&gt; So Beth Hovind played and played and played and played until playing became his life. and you study it people because understand this we talk about the 1% and people who listen it's common people who achieve anything in life they just do more in the same time as you and I you know &gt;&gt; it is not that if Bill Gates or Elon Musk have 29 hours in the day &gt;&gt; it's the same 24 hours &gt;&gt; but what is different is how they use their day Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible speaks about redeeming time. &gt;&gt; How much time do you waste? &gt;&gt; Because when you look back, sometimes you only see things over trends. Months go. But wait a minute. You know, I spend an hour a day on Facebook. That is 365 hours in the year. in 10 years like 3,600 some of us on on on the road to be Facebook experts. We're about to do 10,000 hours of Facebook which means 10,000 hour means you make no progress in life. You just know everything about entertainers and people who have no consequence in changing your life. &gt;&gt; All the latest gossip, the latest news, the latest thing that that that is your identity. But when you see someone who knows the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; how much hours you spending per week listening to a tape, &gt;&gt; reading a book, &gt;&gt; reading the scriptures? &gt;&gt; I tell my wife, I don't even do half the time I want to do. I'm trying to do more &gt;&gt; because I'm scratching the surface of my potential &gt;&gt; because the Bible said study to show yourself approved. That's scripture. That's not a Every single one of us supposed to be studying. &gt;&gt; It's not just the preacher. Every one of us supposed to be studying because the word is your identification. &gt;&gt; How do you know you're lining up with the word if you're not in the word? &gt;&gt; When Paul said, "Follow me as I follow Christ." What you doing to be able to mark his papers to say, "You know what? Paul is going right. So, I'm comfortable with this direction." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem with many of us is laziness. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to go down the road, but dizzy road. &gt;&gt; The lazy in school, the lazy on their job. That's why I said on Friday again, we working for the man, you're working for the man. The Bible say you're working, work unto the Lord. In other words, everything you do is to the Lord. You're reading your Bible is to the Lord. You're going to your job is to the Lord. You're talking to your wife is to the Lord. Everything you do if you include him as a director and the board of your life, your life is different. &gt;&gt; We have to reframe our thinking. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to put deal with the symptoms. You go to the doctor, they say, "Well, take this tablet and it's a painkiller." There's a root cause of the problem. No, &gt;&gt; the painkiller will just deal with the pain. Where's the cause? &gt;&gt; Because we could treat pain. Pain management is a treatment. But that's not a rare thing. We want to get down to the problem. What causing the pain? If we fix the problem, you don't need painkillers anymore. &gt;&gt; God had come to bring painkillers for us. He come to remove the root cause of the problem. Take the sin out of your life. Take unbelief out of your life. &gt;&gt; So you could believe that yes, my family could be delivered. I don't care where they are now. They got to be delivered. &gt;&gt; I don't care how far they have gone. I haven't gotten there, but the context of heaven and earth, that's why when Jesus when the revelation broke upon Peter &gt;&gt; thou art in Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of living God, what was Jesus response? Flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you. &gt;&gt; But my father in heaven, he goes on, but I give you the keys. &gt;&gt; And then he taps into his original intent. Whatever you bind on earth, &gt;&gt; I'll bind in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth, I will loose in heaven. In other words, we will be in agreement. I will back up what you want. So you want to loose your son on earth, I will loose him in heaven. He will be loose. You want to be free here on earth, speak the word. I'll back it up. Heaven and earth will come to agreement again. Thy will be done on earth &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Is this helping anyone this morning? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You spend time with positive people. &gt;&gt; You will leave a bit more positive. &gt;&gt; You spend time with people who are criticizing. &gt;&gt; This is why me personally, I don't I don't even get a comment criticizing the government. And what is what's the what's the value? What is telling me what the government could do or cannot do or should do or didn't do? Am I in power? &gt;&gt; Men get in whole argument for two hours about government policy. Are you in power? Could you change the policy? &gt;&gt; Are you trying to go into government? &gt;&gt; Are you going up for election? &gt;&gt; So that whole two hours, do you really understand? They just waste time. &gt;&gt; Old talk. Thank you. But just old talk. You there for 20 and and people leave heated and blood pressure raising things. But my brother real stupid. I tell him to ting ting thing and you upset you mad because all you have political difference and you know we're closer to more money, better health, better life, better marriage, better relationship with God. Nothing that have value to your life has been strengthened &gt;&gt; except your blood pressure went up and you and your brother have to to for a month before you can talk again. &gt;&gt; You have to ask yourself the question because the Bible said add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge. What are you adding to your life? &gt;&gt; Because activity and productivity are two different things. This is a concept that I am baffled that people don't get. &gt;&gt; I'm working hard. I'm working hard. I'm moving files from this cabinet to this cabinet. &gt;&gt; Then I'm moving from this cabinet back to this cabinet. Nobody can tell you not you're not working or know. But you know what it is? Activity. &gt;&gt; There's no productivity. &gt;&gt; No value has been created. Nothing has been done to change the company. All you you moving files from this cabinet to this cabinet and they move files back. clock out at 3:45 because work is finishing at 4:00 and you know in Trinidad already. &gt;&gt; But Joel, don't laugh like that. Now &gt;&gt; you know in your heart of hearts that there's really not much productivity ready to place. &gt;&gt; You know some of these things I don't want to go down that road but if you really look at it and look at our days and ask yourself what did I accomplish? This is one of the reasons somebody shared with me when God would come down in the cool of the evening to talk to Adam. It was every day. It was a status report to know Adam what you did today. Which animal is your name? &gt;&gt; Let's have some fellowship. &gt;&gt; Daily fellowship around what you achieve today. &gt;&gt; Are you making progress every single day? &gt;&gt; Can you identify how you are growing? Because the word tells us add to your faith virtue, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience. In other words, you are supposed to be making progress and God has not limited that just to spiritual things. It is in every area of your life. What have you done to get progress in your marriage, &gt;&gt; among your family, in your workplace, with your neighbor, with your job, whatever it is, are you making progress? Or when you look at your Sunday from last Sunday, recognize are in the same spot? &gt;&gt; You know why I'm sharing these things? Because there are people who know the message but their life is still a mystery. They have no progress. &gt;&gt; Is your prayer life better? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you have more clarity on what to pray for? &gt;&gt; I told it it'll be good for us to really have a service and have people stand up and pray because I can tell a lot about your prayer life by how you pray. Somebody say Lord &gt;&gt; Lord Lord help because you don't have a you don't have a routine of prayer. So your prayer hasn't matured because we don't have exams and these things. You have exam for police, exam for account exam for doctors. Where's the exam for prayer? Where's the quality of your prayer? But Abraham said one time, you remember the story of the they had no water and the old lady came out to pray and but said the moment she put her hands up and start to pray, he say you know she was a praying woman. &gt;&gt; If you start to pray, could we tell you're a praying woman, &gt;&gt; you're a praying man just by the way you start, you say, "Oh God, help us because this whatever she pray for about to happen here today &gt;&gt; because you know there's a vial of prayer stored up because it is part of your DNA. When you wake up in the morning, you start to pray. Lord God, I thank you for waking me up this morning. Lord, this day is the day you have made. Lord, I will rejoice and be glad in it. I thank you for your provision. I thank you for food, for substance, for strength, for comfort, for peace in the midst of the storm to take me through my home. I apply the blood in the home. It's a relationship you have. You're going through the day. In the middle of the day, you take a pause. You want to get a little prayer in because you want to talk to God. It's a relationship. Lord, it's lunchtime. I had a good morning. I just thanking you for taking me through the morning. Give me strength to go through the evening. Touch my body. Touch my sister. Lord, send a revival. Lord, pour out the Holy Ghost. Touch me today, Lord. Expand my territory. Give me strength. Give me a promotion. Well, I say pray for promotion. Some of you ain't even praying for promotion. Pray for promotion. Pray for increase. [Applause] Brother said, "Ask for big things." &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Is this helping anybody this morning? &gt;&gt; It's a different kind of service. I just feel less to have a conversation with the church. &gt;&gt; I was talking to brother Oen. and say, you know, one of the tragedies of life is, and this is because it wasn't so from the beginning, &gt;&gt; God had a design of how we want families to operate. &gt;&gt; Because the bedrock of a church start with the family unit. The first thing before there was church, it was family. &gt;&gt; Before God talked about people, the first restaurant on people was to Moses. I've heard the cries of my people. He wasn't even calling him people. until Moses. The first time we referenced church was in Matthew 16 with Peter. Before all of that, there was family. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were by tribes and families. &gt;&gt; God wants to get inside your family. &gt;&gt; Establish a altar in your family. &gt;&gt; Whether you are one person family or a 50 person family, God wants to have a preeminence in the home. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that preeminence, that will comes and comes together as a church. &gt;&gt; So the word of God can be rightly divided in due season to provide clarity for the season and the hour as revealed through the scripture and the messenger of the hour. &gt;&gt; So that we're not moving aimlessly to and fro by every wind of doctrine, but we are rooted and grounded with the principles of the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. See in true scripture how God was interested in every aspect of his of his disciples lives. &gt;&gt; When they had to pay taxes he say go fish and the fish was gold. &gt;&gt; God saying you have taxes to pay. I will provide that for you. &gt;&gt; Render to Caesar what is Caesars. &gt;&gt; Showing that God was not just interested in your spiritual well-being. He wants all of you to be complete. &gt;&gt; Why? Because brother Brandham said you are God's advertisement boards. When people see you, they must know that God is in your life and God is real. And you place a value to this thing that drives you to a closer relationship with God that the devil has no room. As brother Brandham said, a man can live so close to God, the devil don't know what to do with you. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? A man can live so close to God, the devil don't even know what to do with you. He tried this and you're still standing. He tried that, you're still standing. He tried this, you're still standing. He threw this against you, you're still standing. You lose your job, you're still standing. He throwing a bit of sickness, you're still standing. Your children giving trouble, you're still standing [Music] until the devil say, "You know what? I fed up. I leave you alone. I go for somebody else because nothing I do could stop you. I can't stop his praise. I can't stop his faith." He still have faith. He still come to church. He has been through a love but nothing will separate him from the love of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham speaking about ambition. God has ambition. &gt;&gt; Do you have ambition? &gt;&gt; In the school they ask you what is the ambition? What do you want to be? What do you want to achieve? But the brand said God has ambition. His ambition is a perfect church. &gt;&gt; His ambition is you on top of the mountain. His ambition is you with no sickness in your body. His ambition is you and your family is together. His ambition is you walking on the devil's neck. His ambition is you perfect. Divine love flowing through you. That's God's ambition. What is your ambition? [Applause] &gt;&gt; No wonder the prophecy we are living under our privileges. Amen. &gt;&gt; We could do more. &gt;&gt; We could do better. &gt;&gt; We could do more. &gt;&gt; We could do better. &gt;&gt; We could rearrange our schedules. We could look at our timets. We could give more to God. He said, "Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and everything else will be added to you." [Applause] &gt;&gt; I've never found someone who put God first and God didn't bless them. Brother Brandham says that I've never seen somebody who put God first and God didn't bless them. God honors the effort. He honors the activity. He honors the sacrifice. He's not a mean God. He's not an unfaithful God. If there's one thing we know about God is great is his faithfulness. He is faithful. Everything you do for God, he takes note of it. [Applause] There's not one thing you have ever done for God he doesn't know about. &gt;&gt; But he wants more. He wants all of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wants his will &gt;&gt; to become your will. &gt;&gt; So like Jesus, Lord, not my will &gt;&gt; but thy will be done. &gt;&gt; So it begs us to ask the question, what is the will of God? What does God really want? Why are we even coming to church? What is God trying to achieve? Because if you are not clear in the business world, the story is told of someone walked into NASA space company and they saw a man cleaning and they say, "What what are you doing here?" And his response was, "We're about to send people to space." I want you to notice he's a cleaner &gt;&gt; but he's clear on purpose and vision. He is saying I'm here cleaning the floor. You know he say we are here because we're going to send people to space. In other words, he understands the bigger picture. &gt;&gt; He understands that the vision without a vision the people perish. &gt;&gt; That is why the Bible say write the vision to make it plain. &gt;&gt; What is the will of God concerning you? We are not Pentecostals. We are not Baptist and Methodists. We're not even message people. This is the bride of Jesus Christ. There's a will that God has for us. There's work we have to do. There's no resurrection for brother Brandham without us. &gt;&gt; Every brother and sister was gone on to be with the Lord from this church. And every church is waiting on you and I. &gt;&gt; To come to perfection, &gt;&gt; to bring on the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So every service, every week, our faith should be growing. Our conviction should be stronger. Our attitude should be more positive. Our approach should be to cut out foolishness from our lives and say, "Lord, I want to be I want to be pure." &gt;&gt; The Lord told his own prophet, you need to be more sincere. If God can say that to the prophet, what about me? &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to be more sincere. I want to be a I want to be real. I want to be genuine. When you see me, you see a genuine a genuine walk. But the said a preacher, God don't make halfway preacher, but a preacher could be halfway. God don't make halfway. Christian, but a Christian could be halfway. Lord, help us to not be halfway. We are plenty halfway. Fathers, halfway, mothers, halfway, sons, halfway, daughters, halfway, business, halfway, all kind of thing. &gt;&gt; But heaven can't be halfway. &gt;&gt; Heaven is perfect. &gt;&gt; Everything is in its place. And we want God's will to be done on earth &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Could you take some more? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before the war in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that interrupted the will of God. The interruption was an interruption of will. The five I wills of the devil. You'll find that in Isaiah 12. Isaiah 14:12. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground, which didest weaken the nations? For thou has said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the size of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou art brought down to hell to the sides of the pit. &gt;&gt; The reason I read this is not just about will. It speaks to ambition. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because this was Lucifer being ambitious. &gt;&gt; And I want to present it as both a warning and to also present the contrast of the opportunity. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, &gt;&gt; but there's such a thing as godly ambition, &gt;&gt; and there's such a thing as ungodly ambition, &gt;&gt; and I make the point very clear. I've said this in youth services many years ago. There are some jobs that are not for Christians. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't have faith to believe that God could provide, because for you to accept a job that puts you into spiritual jeopardy means you are also living in a state where you do not believe that he is Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Because as Jehovah Gyra, his responsibility is to provide. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to raise now because I've seen many people their struggle is because their job tied them up this way and before you know they can't see them in church anymore. &gt;&gt; And when you talk to them well I have to provide for my family and do this and there's nothing wrong with providing for your family but don't let your ambition take you away from God. &gt;&gt; You have to work to find alignment &gt;&gt; between your natural ambition, your spiritual ambition and God's ambition. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the moment you begin to have your own ambition because what the devil was saying as I will as the expression of his ambition was at war with God, &gt;&gt; you understand how ambitious he was. This here is the most ambitious being that ever lived in. &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. &gt;&gt; There's nobody has ever lived with a ter more ambitious than this. But it is the exact picture of ungodly ambition. &gt;&gt; So I want to caution us because we're living in dangerous times and people have all kinds of desires and because we live in a world of compromise. Years ago I preached a message no more excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to talk about no compromise. &gt;&gt; Because the moment you begin to compromise, you are putting yourself out of line with God's will. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what God saw with David that he loved a man after my own heart. He would perform all my will. &gt;&gt; Saul, King Saul, as a contrast, did his own thing &gt;&gt; on multiple occasions. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; laying down as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; I want to skip some things here because I've said so many of my so much of my notes just in under inspiration that I need to find back myself a little bit here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we talked about this that God showed Moses the God showed music. Moses the divine architecture. The divine architecture. Brothers, I think I need the microphone. The divine architecture. So what Moses was doing was not defined by his own idea, but it was God's master plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God's design that Moses was responsible to sort out. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; It was heaven's architecture &gt;&gt; using earthly material. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So again, we see God's interest into how our family is structured, how our homes are structured, and how our lives are structured. &gt;&gt; One second. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 6 and verse one. In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his trained filled the temple. And it stood, and in it stood the seraraphims. Each one had six wings. With twain he covered his face, with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. &gt;&gt; And one cried unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory. And the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then said, I, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then flew one of the seraraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken from the tongues from off the altar. &gt;&gt; And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send and who will go for us? Then said, I here am I, &gt;&gt; send me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this was Isaiah having an experience and we have preached on this before that he was leaning on King Uzziah. And when the man he was leaning on was no longer there, he found himself in the temple and something opened up to him a vision beyond what was physically in that realm that he was in. He got a preview, a taste, a shadow of the throne room itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. speaking to the fact that within the context of that experience, God was showing him that there is a higher calling. There's a order that is established. And as he was standing there, he could not help himself. This was a prophet, but in the presence of the throne room, something came over him &gt;&gt; and he started to see himself different. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before that experience, he may have felt comfortable in his identity and his mission and his ministry and his calling. But the moment as he got closer, he started to look at himself. And then he realized, war is me. He said, I am I am undone. &gt;&gt; In other words, I thought I was fine until I came into the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The presence of the Lord made me aware of things about myself that I did not realize. And that should be the impact of every single service we come to. That when we come into the presence of God, it makes us realize, wait a minute. I'm not even looking at my brother or my sister. But Lord, woe is me. I'm I'm I'm undone. I'm I'm I'm incomplete. I'm not finished. There's something wrong with me when I'm in the presence of the Lord. Lord, I need some fixing. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need a touch. I need something to come over me because the very presence of God, the throne room of God, the seraraphims, the cherubims, the the structure to see everything laid out in a certain way has me feeling somehow. And when I come to the presence of God, I realize, listen, Lord, I'm undone. &gt;&gt; If when you come to the house of God, it doesn't make you feel that way, you need to get closer to God. &gt;&gt; Because when Isaiah was a apart away from him, he didn't feel that way. But every step he took that was closer and closer and closer. He started to see himself. &gt;&gt; The very light of the presence of God came upon him &gt;&gt; and he wanted more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips. Here's a prophet saying, "I'm a man of unclean lips." Why? Why the reference of unclean lips? Because we are going back to spoken word. What comes out of our mouth is important. What we say is important. &gt;&gt; Life and death is in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; We cannot just speak any way we want to because our words have an impact on our destiny. Words have an impact on how we feel. Words have an impact on where we go. Words have an impact on what we do. Words have an impact on other people. This is why the prophet would say to us, the three most powerful words you could say to anybody is God bless you. Because when you say the words God bless you, you are speaking life into someone. &gt;&gt; You couldn't walk in and pass shape. No. Say God bless you to them. Because that declaration puts you in a channel. Put it it's it's saying things. This is why the prophet would say if you cast something good, don't say nothing at all. Because words create &gt;&gt; the world that we see. The expression of this world that we see &gt;&gt; is created by the spoken word. &gt;&gt; God didn't come and physically put stars into place. His word put it in place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are going back to spoken word. &gt;&gt; Back to the beginning. &gt;&gt; Adam could speak and what he spoke was created. Adam could do and whatever he said was going to take place. That's what we are coming to. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet will say right now we lay hands on the sick but when that time come we'll command the devils to leave &gt;&gt; because there's a power coming into the church to bring us back to the spoken word. And that's why our character our nature has to season out and becomes mature because if we start to say foolishness, God can't trust us with that. Can the church say amen? So it brings us a sensitivity to only say what God wants say and to be very careful to speak the things that God once said. Can the church say amen? Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to wind down. The musicians can get ready. &gt;&gt; God's will. When Jesus was on the earth, they asked him, &gt;&gt; "Where is the kingdom?" And what did Jesus say? &gt;&gt; Kingdom of heaven is within you. &gt;&gt; Heaven already on the earth. This word we preach is already heaven in word form, seed form. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come into life that there could be an alignment of will. &gt;&gt; My prayer this morning for each one of us is that our will would come to an end. &gt;&gt; And his will will take over. &gt;&gt; Have you been living outside of the will of God? &gt;&gt; Listen friends, us having activities doesn't change the fact that you have to align with the will of God. &gt;&gt; Because the will of God is your daily life. You want to live in his will every day. &gt;&gt; There's only so much we could do, &gt;&gt; but it must be your desire. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself had to pray &gt;&gt; in the garden of Gethsemane &gt;&gt; and wrestle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said his sweat was like blood &gt;&gt; as he was dealing with the crisis of his will versus God's will. That's the crisis we all have to go through because we have to deal and bring our will under subjection. &gt;&gt; Whatever our will tells us to do, is it God's will? If not, my will has to die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Lord, if it's possible, let this cup pass." &gt;&gt; In other words, this is a is a hard thing, &gt;&gt; but nevertheless, not my will &gt;&gt; but thy will be done. Just as his father David did the will of God. Here was seed of David saying Lord not my will. My will. I have a will. I'm not saying you don't have a will. I'm saying your will has to come under subjection to the will of God. &gt;&gt; Your ambitions have to come under subjection to the will of God. Your human desires have to come under subjection to the will of God. The things you want to do, like to do, hope to do have to come under subjection to the will of Almighty God. When you don't feel like praising and that is your will, you bring that will under subjection and say nevertheless not my will but thine and be done I will praise God anyhow because his will is that we are worshippers. His will is that we praise. Friends, if it is up to our will, we wouldn't pray every day. But we bring our will under subjection because the will of God is men ought to pray and not to faint. So we bring our will on the subjection. It is our will for our own nature to be expressed but is God's will to give us a divine nature. So we bring our will under subjection. He said you must bring your body to obey your confession. So what we are speaking about is the confession of God's will because God's will is to see this body come under subjection of the leadership of the Holy Ghost that the will of God to be expressed. Are we together? Are we here this morning? &gt;&gt; So God has will and his wills and the devil has his will. They're only two. We preach it as two influences, but it's really wills. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And Satan knows he can't do anything in heaven. &gt;&gt; We establish this. We knows. He knows he can't do everything in anything in heaven. In fact, we read the quote on Wednesday night. The devil knows more than theologians. The devil knows that if Oh, come on now. That Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and the devil knows this. &gt;&gt; Do you know? Do you know? Do you believe? Because the devil believes and the devil trembles. &gt;&gt; So, the devil knows that because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you get into the will of God, there's nothing will stand before you all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I shall be with thee. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The expression of the will of God. The same way the son was an expression of the will through the word is the same way you are an expression of God. The will of God through the word of God. You are standing here. You are not keeping yourself. You cannot keep yourself. You cannot preserve yourself. Hallelujah. The word of God itself is powerful to preserve you. And the spirit of God is hovering over the word seed in your soul. And when your will aligns with God will when two omnipotent meets then the miraculous must take place. They were in the upper room dry seeds waiting for the rain to fall. They were under expectation their will. They were you in one mind. They were in one accord. They had one purpose. They were in one will. They were in one mind. They were in one accord. They had one objective. They had one purpose. But the Brandham said if we could get the people into one mind into one accord into one purpose into one will then in 5 minutes there'll be not a feeble person in the building. You don't hear me this morning. In 5 minutes every sick person in this room would be healed if we could align our will with his will in one mind in one accord in one purpose in one objective. Every female condition will be dissolved in 5 minutes if we are in one mind, one purpose, one will. His will is healing. My will is healing. Lord, let the healings begin. His will is deliverance. My will is deliverance. Let the deliverance begin. Can the church say, "Amen. His will is joy. My will is joy." Then let joy break forth because the joy of the Lord is our strength. Brother Brandham said, "God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive it." So his will is to give you the Holy Ghost, is that your will to receive the Holy Ghost? Because if his will is to give you the Holy Ghost and your will is to receive the Holy Ghost, when two omnipotent Oh, come on now. When two omnipotent meets, then the miraculous, the miraculous has got to take place, the Holy Ghost has enough power to change your being. I'm saying it's going to come up hither. Let us combine wills this morning. If two shall agree, if two shall get into the same will, if two shall agree, touching anything, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Hallelujah. They are sick among us that if we agree, if we agree today, if we agree right now, if we come into one mind, I want to call. I believe in my heart that the angel of the Lord could move to better you where he is right now. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. The same God we serve, Satan knows. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you know that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever? And his will is to not leave you incomplete. His will is not to leave you defeated. His will is not to leave you sick. His will is not to leave you depressed. One 91 accord. One mind one accord. You have back pain. We come against the back pain. God's will is to heal you. Female condition, yes. Cancer, yes. High blood pressure, yes. Ivate what it is. God's will is to heal. Healing is the children's bread. Joy, the Holy Ghost, deliverance, the power of sin, the power of Satan, Satan, the blood of Jesus is against you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once more, Lord. Once more, Lord. Once more, Lord. One mind, one accord. One purpose, one objective. If we want the revival, we can make it happen. If we want the Holy Ghost, we can make it happen. You want a move of the spirit, yes, it can happen because God wants to do it. He's looking for somebody who digs a valley full of dishes. Once you do something, it speaks of your will, what you want to see. You want to see revival, then let's make ready for it. You want the Holy Ghost, make ready for it. You want healing, make ready for it. God is in position. God is in position. Let's get into position. God is ready. Get ready. [Applause] Oh Lord, Lord, it's me and standing in need of prayer. Lord, I'm undone. I'm incomplete, but I'm not leaving here. I'm not leaving here until I get a breakthrough. God, I've been struggling with this. I've been struggling with that, but today is my day. May you move upon me as never before. Father, I put aside my will. I put aside my feelings. I put aside how I feel, what it might be, but today is my day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Somebody's going to go free today. Somebody's going to go free today. Yes. Yes. Yes. That demon have been holding you. Today is the last day. The Egyptians you see today, you will see them no more forever. The will of the people under Moses have come to a crossroad. God said, "Speak and move forward. Why cry unto me? Speak and move forward. I'm done crying this morning. Crying time is over. We are speaking this morning and we are moving forward. The time to cry about your problems is over. Let's speak to your problems and let's move forward. Let's speak to your problems. Speak on your children this morning. Speak on your home today. Speak over your sickness today. By his stripes, I am healed. Not will be healed. I am healed. I am healed. He already did it. He's not now healing. He already did the healing. Receive your healing. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive your freedom. Sin is has no power against the living God. May the will of God drop down in this room. May the will of God drop down in your home. May the will of God drop down in your marriage. May the will of God drop down in your family. May the will of God drop down in your business, on your job, wherever you go. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. We give the Lord permission today to move freely. Lord, move things around. Lord, shake things up. Lord, move things out of place. Put things into position. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come on, John. John is the tap of the bride. Come on, John. Come up here. Come on, rise a little higher. Let your faith rise higher. Let your faith climb this morning. Lift up your hands. Talk to the Lord. Lift up your hands. Worship him. Stand to your feet. Let's give the Lord a shout of praise. Let's talk to the Lord. Tell him what you want. Speak to him this morning. Jesus on the main line. Tell him what you want. You need the Holy Ghost. Tell him what you want. Wonder &gt;&gt; you could begin to play something softly. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Come on, talk to him. Talk to him this morning. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Yes, [Music] &gt;&gt; the angel is here. &gt;&gt; The one with his swept back wings. The mighty angel. He the one to lead us. The one to direct us. He is setting an order for the coming of the Lord. [Music] We didn't make an altar call, but there are people at the altar. He is doing the work this morning. He is breaking self-will, breaking will, breaking your desires. Allow him to perform surgery. Yes. Yes. Yes. Allow him to perform surgery this morning. Allow him. He say, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone opens up, I'll come in and perform surgery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you want to serve the Lord? Do you really want to serve the Lord? &gt;&gt; Oh, make him know. Let him know. Let him know. Lord, I want you. Oh, more than ever before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; More than ever before. More than ever before. More than ever before. Make your altar where you want this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All over the building. [Music] Oh, he's moving from person to person. &gt;&gt; He's moving from person to person. &gt;&gt; Don't you leave the same way you came today. Oh hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. [Music] I want to be more like you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to be a vessel. You walk through. I want to be more. Make this your prayer today. Oh, I I want to be &gt;&gt; Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. Let the Lord hear you. Say the words. I want to be a &gt;&gt; judgment is hanging over the world, but there's mercy here this morning. The throne of God is a judgment seat, but there's blood on the throne. There's mercy this morning. If you want mercy, you can receive mercy. It will not be mercy forever, but there's mercy this morning. Lord, I want to be more like you. Lord, I want to be more like you. Come on, mama. Come on, papa. Catch a burden. This may be the last service for somebody. This may be the last time of grace for someone. We don't know. But take advantage. If you're a backslider, I invite you. I invite you. Come for restoration. If you've been living wayward, I invite you. Don't leave the service the same way you came. The angel of the Lord is here. The Lord Jesus himself, every head bowed, every eye closed, all over the building in reverence. God is dealing with situations. He's dealing with homes. He's dealing with individuals. Oh, I want to be more of me more in the presence. &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah felt of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Maybe you have been casual about God. You have taken this thing for granted. [Music] Woe is me. Lord, forgive me. [Music] Forgive me for being casual. Forgive me for taking it lightly, Lord. [Music] but in your presence. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need more of Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Every head bow, every eye closed. Almighty God. Lord, your word has gone forth. Lord, with the message you give for today, Lord, we see souls at the altar through the building. Lord, tears, prayers, cries, people reflecting on Lord, as Isaiah would have done as he came into the presence and as he came closer to the throne, he said, "Lord, I I need more. I cannot live this way. May this presence be upon each brother, every sister, even those connected online. May the presence move into the room where they may be. Lord, may the presence surround each one. Lord, may the presence move into each one. Lord, love is not a feeling. Love is a person. And Lord, we feel the divine presence of love in the building this morning with mercy moving through the camp because it is not your desire, not your will that none should be lost, but you sent a prophet, a message, grace. Lord, in this day and age, Father, that we could be called higher like John, a type of the bride to come up hither into the realm of the heavenly, we could sit in heavenly places, Father. Lord, may you forgive our past, forgive our casualness, forgive our lack of sincerity, forgive us for what we have taken granted, Lord, we have taken for granted, Lord, forgive us, Lord. And Lord, may you do a work here today among your people, Lord. May you touch each one, Father. Lord, there are needs in the place. We pray for Lord this prayer request from brother Barry for Lord Aira and Ethan down with the coal Lord that you would heal them completely Father and Lord for his wife Lord for strength Lord for the journey that you would touch her also and Lord for all the different requests in the church this morning Lord we pray for the cases the harder cases we pray for the you father who just celebrated a birthday Lord the grace of God in his life and how the enemy is trying to cut him off, Lord. But Satan, we come against you. We are united today. We unite in faith. We unite as one. We unite as a people, our will, God's will, one will for a complete healing. May you touch your son. May you touch your deacon even now. May the Holy Ghost move upon brother Hugh. May you touch brother Terren. And Lord, that eyesight, Father. The devil had no right to touch his eyes. Satan, take out your hands from in the name of Jesus. May healing touch your servant, Lord, with a Ashby, Lord, Sister Donna K. Every situation in the tabernacle, every condition, Lord, in the building with a Clarence, everyone with a need, Lord, every one with need of physical healing in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Father, Lord, we unite in faith as a church. You said if two shall agree touching anything, we could have what we ask for. Lord, many in the building, Lord, they have family that's out there that loved ones that have backsliden, but Lord, we want to unite in faith as a church, Lord, for a restoration of every family member. Lord, of every backslider, Lord, there's seeds in their hearts, but the enemy tried to cut them off. But Lord, you said, "My sheep know my voice, and of strangers, they would not follow." Lord, we plead the blood upon them. We send the blood hound of the Holy Ghost after them to arrest them. If you could speak for Lazarus who was dead to come back to life. We could speak this morning for the backsliders to be completely delivered. May you break every chain. May you break every shackle Lord for the young people Lord who have their struggles but more than that they have not made a decision a real decision to serve you with everything. Father, Lord, gay you may you give them the strength to decide because Lord, the blessings could only follow the decision. When Ruth decided, then the blessing was unlocked. So, Father, may your young people make a decision that from this day on, come what may, I will wholly follow the Lord. As for me and my househ, we will serve the Lord. Lord, may that not just be for the young people only, but even for the Calebs, for Lord, for the older ones. Uh Lord, as a service of recommmitment to see the will of God, the plan of God, the desire of God, the design of God reflected here in this terrestrial realm. Father, Lord, may you bring us back at the appointed time and be with your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Brother Jason, can we give the Lord a hand of praise?

So, may the Lord may she bless you and grant you many, many more years straight into the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, uh let's just bow our heads one more time. And we also want to remember in prayer there was a situation uh in Lagos where uh some of the brothers in returning from a funeral were taken captive and we want to remember them in prayer at this time that all will be well and the mighty hand of God would bring deliverance to them at this time. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your blood, for your grace, for your mercy, for your loving kindness, Lord. And Lord, we have so much to thank you for, Lord. If we even try to use the English language to express it, we will run out of words to properly put into structure how much you mean to us what you have done for us. So Lord, we unite in saying thank you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy to us. And Lord, we want to remember each one here in prayer. We want to pray for our pastor in a special way and his wife, Lord, and the ministry that we are under, all of the health and the governments, Lord. And Lord, we want to remember each one, Father, that Lord, helps make this church what it is, Father. And Lord, we want to remember our friends, our brothers in Nigeria, Lord. And Lord, what a situation. But Lord, you are more than able to bring relief and deliverance in this situation. Lord, you are God and God by yourself. So, Father, at this time, we could only tap into Lord, what you want to achieve out of this. But Lord, we commit the situation completely to you, knowing that Lord, at the end of it, you will get all the honor, all the glory. So, Father, we commit the brothers into your hands. We commit the efforts into your hands, Lord. And we pray dear God that Lord you would bring great deliverance to them. Father may you bless the church and may you bring us back at the appointed time. We commit your people into your hands. May you grant traveling mercies as we leave this house but not from your presence in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. service continues this Wednesday at 8:00 PM live here at the tabernacle and we encourage you to make an effort uh to be here. Um, you know, I was sharing with my wife. I said, you know, there are people who, um, I get it. You might finish work late and different things, but I want you to reframe your thinking. You know, even if you can't make it every single Wednesday, could you make once a month, twice a month, three times a month, but let it not be that you miss every Wednesday service, you know. So, find a way to structure that you could make the effort because God counts the effort. So let us reframe our thinking because it could be so casual um that we have many Sunday only believers you know so it takes effort it takes sacrifice and I even if there's a day you miss but don't miss all right so rethink on your approach and your strategy so that you could give God what his fair share is all right so service continues on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. There will be no uh online services coming Friday. There will be no online services coming Friday. This doesn't mean you just go and do what you want. Still find some time to pray. &gt;&gt; Still find some time to have your own family altar. All right. So service continues this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. and this coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m. under great expectation for God to do something tremendous for us. Maintenance team group five, please meet with brother Blackman after the service today and next week Lord willing group four which is brother Marlon Alexander's group will be carded to serve. Uh, I want to just remind the church, brother Steven, forgive me. I don't have a full approval just yet, but we do have the church dinner coming up in December. I'm waiting on brother OIT to just confirm the date and once we have that date, we'll send it out um via the WhatsApp group uh this week so we could at least have it on your calendar. But it is happening. We're just trying to confirm the date between one of two weeks in the month of December. But I am under authority. So I don't have approval yet. So the date will come by the grace of God this week, right? So um but we will have a church dinner in December and do continue to remember one another in prayer. We are living in in different times, dangerous time and if there ever was a time to pray, it's now you know and when you look at the scripture that says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together, it actually adds in there as the day approaches. So it places a context to as the day approaches, we are supposed to be actually assembling more because we will need each other more. That's the purpose of what the church is for. So I want to encourage you to reframe your thinking on that and really look into what are you doing. Like I said, it's not for church, it's for the Lord. It's expressed in the structure of the church, but it's unto the Lord. So may the Lord richly bless you. May the Lord keep you. And uh Jess, I'll close with this before brother Jason sings us out. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in this Lord that he meditate day and night. There's a lot of lessons in there to to to impact us and to unpack. But as we go out to school and to work and to meet people that we invariably have to meet people, be very cautious because there are people who will speak into your life. But the Brandon was driving one time and he allowed someone to come into his car and he said when they spoke in the car, he said they spoke a blue streak. &gt;&gt; By that he meant the words they used activated a spiritual impact in his vehicle. So I want us to be sensitive that we're not taking these things lightly because we're not wrestling against flesh and blood. But when you let people speak into your life, it has an impact. &gt;&gt; So you have to guard your heart, guard your phone, guard your conversations, guard what you look at, guard what you listen to, guard whose advice you take, guard whose counsel you expose yourself to. Because if you do not do that, you will find yourself drifting into places you don't know how you got there. But you re then real you open up yourself into some friend and they tell you this. And when you really realize it, it's a is it the devil using them? You know, &gt;&gt; I'm not accusing them of being devils, but the same Peter who was in the book of Matthew 16 that the Lord revealed and say, listen, flesh and blood reveal this to you. when it was opened up, God could still turn to Peter and say, "Get behind me, Satan." Because at that moment in time, the devil was using Peter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, we are not walking around saying that people in our lives are devils. But understand this, there are only two forces. &gt;&gt; And every word that is spoken into your life, you have to ask yourself the question, is it from God or is it from the devil? &gt;&gt; Because nothing that comes to you that takes you away from God could be from God &gt;&gt; because you know the truth. So if it affects your mental state, your mind, your attitude, coming to church, fellowship, say, you know what good advice is. And if you want to get good advice, then brother Brandham said, you want to get the Holy Ghost, spend time with people who have the Holy Ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because your environment determines your trajectory. All right? So these are life principles and and if you're not in an environment where you are hearing these things or you practicing these things and have these conversations by the grace of God we want to help create that environment so that at least during the week when you put on a tape you read the scripture send a message ask something let your whole life be a positive one. So may the Lord rich you bless you we love you we appreciate you brother Jason. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh God will make a way where there seem to be no way. He works in ways we cannot see.
