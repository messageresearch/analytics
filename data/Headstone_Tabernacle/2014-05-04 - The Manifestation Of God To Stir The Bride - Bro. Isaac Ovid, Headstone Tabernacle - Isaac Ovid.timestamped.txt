[7:53] chapter 2 i'm going to read from verse 9
[8:01] when you have it's a man and it came to
[8:05] pass when they were going over that
[8:07] elijah said unto Elijah asked what I
[8:12] shall do for thee before I be taken away
[8:14] from thee and Elijah said I pray thee
[8:17] let a double portion of the spirit be
[8:19] upon me and he said that was asked a
[8:22] hard thing nevertheless if though see me
[8:25] when I'm taking from thee it shall be so
[8:27] unto thee for if not it shall not be so
[8:30] and it came to pass as they still went
[8:33] on and talked at behold they appeared a
[8:36] chariot of fire and horses a fire and
[8:39] parted them both asunder and Elijah went
[8:41] up by a whirlwind into heaven and he
[8:44] likes a sword and he cried my father my
[8:46] father the chariot of Israel and the
[8:47] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[8:50] and he took whole of his own clothes and
[8:52] ran them in two pieces and he took up
[8:55] also the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[8:57] him and went back and stood by the bank
[9:00] of Jordan and he took the mantle of
[9:02] Elijah that fell from him and smooth the
[9:05] waters and said where is the Lord God of
[9:07] Elijah and when he also had smitten the
[9:10] waters departed hither and thither and
[9:12] he'll I Shah went over and let us go to
[9:16] the book of Zechariah for and reading
[9:21] from verse 4 so I answered and speak to
[9:29] the angel that talked with me saying
[9:31] what are these my lord and then the
[9:34] angel that talked with me answered and
[9:35] said unto me know as thou not what these
[9:37] be and I said no my lord then he
[9:40] answered and speak unto me saying this

[11:47] man when I'm not going to be too long
[11:49] with us as our communion communion
[11:52] evening service so just for a few words
[11:54] encourage your fear this evening
[11:57] hallelujah so he can grow from strength
[11:59] to strength because every day with Jesus
[12:02] should be sweeter than the day before
[12:04] every day with Jesus we should love him
[12:06] more and more and I was saying in the
[12:09] prayer meeting that we had that the
[12:11] devil's tactics are just to distract us
[12:13] everything around us is to just distract
[12:15] us
[12:15] from keeping our focus on what we are
[12:18] born to do the job is designed to
[12:21] distract you it's one thing to have to
[12:23] make money to live but there comes a
[12:25] point where it becomes a distraction
[12:26] from your purpose and you have to become
[12:28] vigilant with protecting your purpose
[12:31] above all else you have to protect your
[12:33] purpose because your purpose is not
[12:35] somebody else's professor you can't
[12:37] expect your neighbor to watch out for
[12:39] your purpose you can't expect your
[12:41] father to look out for your purpose your
[12:43] natural mother she's not gonna help you
[12:45] with your purpose because your purpose
[12:47] come from God and I come from Gordon I'm
[12:50] going back to God so I want to be
[12:52] Purpose Driven I want to be focused on
[12:54] where I'm going this evening and I want
[12:57] to encourage you we are going somewhere
[12:58] this evening we are under expectation
[13:01] this evening I don't know what you came
[13:03] to do this evening but I'm on the

[13:07] expectation it makes you for something a
[13:10] certain way if you don't expect you may
[13:12] be seated if you walk into church if you
[13:15] come to the service and you don't know
[13:17] what you come for then you'll accept
[13:18] anything but if you come looking for
[13:21] something specific then you know that
[13:23] you're going to position yourself that I
[13:25] come for that specific purpose and I'm
[13:28] not going to move I'm not going to turn
[13:30] to the left I'm not going to turn to the
[13:32] right the Deacons wouldn't have to carry

[27:51] that's what they need up that's what we
[27:54] need
[28:06] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my God
[28:12] my God hallelujah from the message of
[28:15] third seal butter Branham said no that's
[28:17] the reason today the revivals we're
[28:20] supposed to have he said we have the
[28:22] number national revival so he say oh
[28:24] that's a grown-ass denomination revival
[28:26] we haven't had a real stirring we are
[28:30] never real story no sub he in fact he
[28:33] says it multiple times have no no no no
[28:35] no sir we have another real Sturm so you
[28:38] me in 1983 you mean all the great 1993
[28:42] you mean all that God has already done
[28:44] still hasn't been the real stirring you
[28:47] said the brighter hasn't had a revival
[28:49] yet maybe the church has had a revival
[28:52] but the bride has a revival coming the
[28:55] prize revival is coming and I'm here
[28:57] tonight to declare it's here it's here
[29:00] it's arrived
[29:10] but if adam said don't think we got me
[29:13] vayas we haven't he said the pride
[29:15] hasn't had a revival you see there's
[29:17] been a revival there and no
[29:19] manifestation of god I'm the stirred up
[29:22] ride yet time he said we're looking for
[29:24] it so it'll take those seven unknown
[29:27] thunders look back yet to wake her up
[29:29] again is this what's happening are you
[29:32] being woken up this evening hallelujah
[29:36] get a lot of some praise get the loss of
[29:39] worship I'm getting ready to close out
[29:41] because the Holy spread is already in
[29:43] charge of the service I can't do much
[29:45] more because the word is already in you
[29:47] I'd really give us back the trigger you
[29:50] may be seated for a minute
[30:10] there is power in the message of Malachi
[30:13] 4 there is no mistake in the message of
[30:17] Malachi for every word and he spoke what
[30:21] specific was chosen and he said he went
[30:25] to so certain sees because the real rain
[30:27] is coming so there are certain things in
[30:30] the message just as when Jesus was here
[30:33] in earth and he spoke certain things he
[30:35] said things throw off some people and he
[30:38] said things to pull some people so when
[30:41] he made us deep and accept you eat my
[30:43] flesh and drink my blood those that were
[30:46] just church members didn't understand
[30:48] the service that day so they walk out
[30:50] the church this shot the Deacons hands
[30:53] and say that we are not coming back
[31:02] Jesus had no problem and that he turned
[31:05] to his own disciples and challenged them
[31:07] he said will you go also and then I
[31:14] brother Troy no not again said where
[31:16] shall we go when you alone have words of
[31:18] eternal life so I want to drive
[31:20] something home yet i win when you read
[31:24] this message you cannot read from an
[31:26] intellectual perspective and that's what
[31:29] confuses so many people including
[31:31] ministers reading the code and think
[31:34] it's in its intellectual it doesn't
[31:37] matter how smart you are unless God
[31:39] opens your understanding by revelation
[31:42] to what the Prophet said it will remain
[31:44] intellectual I don't know how I got the
[31:47] I don't know where I came from but it
[31:49] needed to be said but I'm trying to come
[31:51] to a point where the plenum saying
[31:53] there's been no manifestation of God to
[31:56] stir the bride and I was thinking about
[31:59] a would stir there's so many words you
[32:02] could use to describe what's supposed to
[32:03] happen why did believe I'm sister the
[32:06] bride Anna and I began to think about
[32:07] the woods still
[32:10] and sir by definition it means to mix it
[32:17] means to combine it means to unite it
[32:22] means to bring the elements together in
[32:26] chemistry and I'm not a chemist but in
[32:28] chemistry there's something called a
[32:30] Bunsen burner the cameras can correct me
[32:33] it's where you put certain things in and
[32:35] you try to mix it together but for
[32:38] certain things to mix together you need
[32:41] to stir it but there's another element
[32:44] certain things you need to mix together
[32:46] you got to put some fire to heat the
[32:50] elements up Oh somebody help you
[32:53] preachers evening you gotta put some
[32:55] fire under the burnham so there's the
[32:58] manifestation of God it's going to bring
[33:01] a fire that when the bride is turn up
[33:04] there's gonna be a reaction
[33:09] there's gonna be a reaction there's
[33:12] going to be a chemical reaction
[33:24] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[33:27] I might drop something off to you that's
[33:30] why I love it he said the bride hasn't
[33:33] had a revival yet there's been no
[33:35] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[33:38] so I want you to picture the bride in
[33:41] some vessel so to speak a Bunsen burner
[33:44] and if we all bride it can be this group
[33:48] on that side and this group on this side
[33:50] and this one can talk to this one if
[33:52] that is the current case when the heat
[33:54] begins to activate and the story begins
[33:57] to take place then all who can shake
[34:00] your hand they suddenly have to shake
[34:02] your hand because there's a mixture
[34:03] going on there's a combining going on
[34:06] there's a reaction going on there's a
[34:09] shop
[34:12] that's why you may be seated it will not
[34:15] be manner because of these seven tunnels
[34:17] to gather the bride I went a
[34:19] manifestation I shot takes place no man
[34:23] could take credit for bringing the unity
[34:26] of the faith no man could take credit
[34:28] for bringing a unity among the people it
[34:31] would be God himself
[34:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or
[34:44] somebody give the Lord praise somebody's
[34:47] going free today you are going free
[34:49] today
[34:56] you may be seated so by revelation this
[35:01] evening you are being placed because God
[35:03] is the greatest chemist he took 16
[35:06] elements and mix it together and formed
[35:10] man and said this man right here he's
[35:13] analyze a little breathe some life into
[35:16] him I gotta wake him up hug I gotta use
[35:19] a seven ton of power that's rooted in me
[35:22] don't wake Adam up from his slumber and
[35:24] that's the same God that's coming to
[35:26] wake the bride up to put the bride into
[35:29] action because the brightest or work the
[35:31] two kind of church semen
[35:40] I'm trying to close out I'm gonna have
[35:42] to finish this message some other time
[35:47] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[35:53] my mama mama mama so what are we looking
[36:00] for friends we are looking for you may
[36:02] be seated for the manifestation of God
[36:05] of God not of man we have had enough of
[36:11] man what we need is a manifestation of
[36:14] God to stir the bride can the church say
[36:17] Amen a present tense reality you walk
[36:22] the message world you walk the message
[36:24] churches it's all about pushing the
[36:27] manifestation away because it's all
[36:29] about had knowledge read this read and
[36:32] studied in study this and there's no
[36:35] focus under God of Elijah there is no
[36:39] focus on the dynamics and where the
[36:42] branham said that I name this could be
[36:43] perfect but what does it go due to
[36:46] polish the hubcaps and keep washing a
[36:48] car if you don't intend to start the car
[36:51] for all these years we have been under
[36:54] the Ministry of the word and what we
[36:56] need now is the Ministry of the Spirit
[36:59] to bring these words he's alive or to
[37:03] use the word and I recourse to activate
[37:05] it to activate it because it's already
[37:09] in you somebody say man
[37:14] my God my God my god I must skip a lot
[37:19] of this here huh my God my God a
[37:27] manifestation of God you may be seated
[37:30] so Abraham let's just pick up something
[37:32] here and i'll touch elijah and then we
[37:33] go out abraham had to work for 25 years
[37:36] it is not right but after a while he
[37:40] needed something more than just the
[37:42] testimony yet he needed the word
[37:44] revelation that he testified about to
[37:47] change form because in that current form
[37:50] he was going to have the Sun but for
[37:52] what he needed was to move to a
[37:53] manifestation of God isn't that right
[37:56] Jacob he had reached the end of his Road
[37:59] when he had problems with his brother
[38:01] his ideas had run out him his way of
[38:05] doing things came to an end up he ran
[38:07] out of solutions there was nothing else
[38:09] that he could do he needed more than he
[38:12] had himself so he had to wait for what
[38:15] for a manifestation of God to bring a
[38:18] radical transformation in his life so
[38:21] that when he got a whole of the angel
[38:23] and he wrestled all night long when the
[38:26] Bible said he was all alone he didn't
[38:28] have the pasture with him the Ellis with
[38:30] him the Deacons with him he didn't have
[38:32] the ministers with him he didn't have
[38:34] any books with him he could even reach
[38:36] our book because he was in the middle of
[38:37] a fight but he was wrestling all night
[38:40] long because he made up his mind that if
[38:43] I let this angel go I'm going to be in
[38:45] the same condition that I came to church
[38:48] with she said I'm not gonna let you go
[38:50] until you bless me listen Jacob was such
[38:56] a fighter and it's hard for the human
[39:00] mind to comprehend how a mortal man can
[39:03] fight an angel in so much that he ends
[39:07] up they say please let me go what kind
[39:11] of hold and he have on the angel until
[39:13] he say angel
[39:16] I'm not gonna let you go the inter they
[39:19] say okay okay okay what do you want you
[39:21] see I need a change I need a change I
[39:24] need a manifestation of God to change my
[39:27] life kind of church hey man you may be
[39:33] seated I always tell young people it's
[39:41] two elements you need a revelation and
[39:44] you need experience Moses he had a
[39:47] revelation part he had a revelation
[39:50] party and with that revelation he was
[39:53] successful in his mission of killing one
[39:55] Egyptian I'm freeing none of his people
[40:00] his revelation took him as far as I need
[40:04] to save one of my countrymen and I will
[40:07] kill this Egyptian and the plan fold it
[40:10] after that because his strength his
[40:13] ideas his training was insufficient to
[40:16] the magnitude of the task that layer
[40:19] hand the responsibility that he was born
[40:23] for his intellect could have never
[40:26] prepared him for it his education could
[40:30] have never prepared him for it he had
[40:32] the best he could have in the course of
[40:34] Egypt I'm none of that training was
[40:36] going to prepare him for the work that
[40:38] he had laying on him so Moses frustrated
[40:44] walked out of Egypt he didn't whether he
[40:47] didn't walk it in a nice car saying I'll
[40:48] see all they want to come back you know
[40:51] he left desperate to get out because he
[40:54] had to run for his life because his own
[40:58] natural ability the ability of man had
[41:01] come to its end number six could have
[41:05] only taken him so far he needed to reach
[41:08] number seven he needed to get the cell
[41:11] phone to dial number seven can the
[41:14] church here man but Moses didn't know we
[41:18] had to call the number
[41:20] so he runs her own living his normal
[41:22] life get a wife you have a child you
[41:25] have a nice tent nice-looking tent until
[41:31] one day he sees something on the hilltop
[41:35] you see a manifestation of God because
[41:38] God's purpose has always been to
[41:41] manifest himself what good does it do to
[41:46] be able to deliver and you don't deliver
[41:49] what good is it to be a healer and don't
[41:52] heal anybody so God always what's the
[41:55] manifest himself and he's looking for
[41:58] somebody that he could use after a long
[42:01] time he was looking out looking out
[42:03] looking out waited for the right man to
[42:05] come along who was waiting for the right
[42:07] opportunity for manifestation and here
[42:11] it was the pillar of higher here and
[42:12] Moses here and Moses saying i gotta go
[42:15] up and investigate this kind of church
[42:21] demon i'm not going to be too long i'm
[42:24] finishing every drive this point home
[42:28] they see Moses who was a politician who
[42:33] was next in line for Pharaoh they will
[42:35] never put somebody who cannot speak or
[42:37] articulate himself or explain his
[42:40] military position as leader of the
[42:42] greatest army and kingdom on earth but
[42:45] when he came in contact with a burning
[42:47] bush he said I can't talk I don't know
[42:51] how to use sign language I don't know
[42:55] how to write I don't know how to do
[42:57] anything because he realized he came
[43:00] into contact with something that was
[43:02] much greater than himself can the church
[43:04] team and is there anybody here tonight
[43:07] who wants to contact something greater
[43:10] than themselves
[43:17] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[43:21] I'm getting ready to close out and what
[43:24] a ministry Moses had when Moses met a
[43:27] pillar of fire he was never the same God
[43:30] told Moses you will be like God and Iran
[43:32] will be a prophet that's how Moses been
[43:35] as she was and when Moses died God came
[43:38] to Josh ones here Joshua Moses my civic
[43:41] is dead no arise take my people over go
[43:46] across Jordan go possess your
[43:48] inheritance he said and as I was with
[43:51] Moses sure shall I be with me I will not
[43:54] leave him I will not forsake thee and
[43:57] bry come on Josh was tonight up as i was
[44:00] with malachi for so shall i be with thee
[44:03] the same God that was feeling the
[44:06] prophet
[44:11] and the church hey man and there's so
[44:16] many things that I have to skip through
[44:17] a lot of it the woman with the blood
[44:22] issue the Bible says he spent all she
[44:25] had it would appear that she was a woman
[44:28] of some substance because she went
[44:32] around trying man's idea trying
[44:34] different churches trying different
[44:36] doctors trying different solutions until
[44:39] the situation itself for start to make a
[44:42] decision it was not by choice or
[44:45] excitement that you went to Jesus it was
[44:47] because of money ran out and she was out
[44:49] of options now we could understand why
[44:52] but a random said if love doesn't get
[44:54] you desperate conditions will so there
[44:57] are people who have it so nice they
[44:59] can't make it to church they have it so
[45:01] good they don't want to pray they have
[45:03] it so nicely convergence when they
[45:04] wanted doing the Juan de pere ties when
[45:07] they want to do this thing when they
[45:08] wanted clapping the one God is going to
[45:10] change the situations because if you are
[45:13] predestinated you have to come into your
[45:15] purpose so there was something God had
[45:19] to prove with this woman that when
[45:22] everything ran out she had to look to
[45:24] our only solution which was Jesus and
[45:27] she said if I could just touch the hem
[45:31] of His garment I don't know if I'll make
[45:33] it all the way to shake his hand but if
[45:35] I could just touch the hem of His
[45:37] garment then I can see the manifestation
[45:39] of God that I want from my life kind of
[45:44] church came in and that's how I feel the
[45:47] ceiling looking for a manifestation of
[45:50] God looking to become so real to you
[45:54] that when you wake up in the morning you
[45:56] say Lord this is the day when you go to
[45:59] bed at night you see Lord this is still
[46:01] dirty when you drive in your car it's a
[46:04] constant planning in your heart like
[46:07] Elijah after Elijah because when Elijah
[46:10] tasted that anointing is to that power
[46:12] when the mantle dropped upon him and he
[46:15] fell the anointing he had never felt
[46:17] anything like that before
[46:20] and you feel the anointing that is here
[46:22] or right now and they are not even moved
[46:24] in the service you know that's the angel
[46:27] you know that's the law I mean I just
[46:31] said you know what I cannot live without
[46:33] that I cannot live without that and he
[46:36] got rid of everything he had he burned
[46:39] the bridges behind him because he wanted
[46:42] to follow after that and everywhere
[46:48] Elijah went Elijah was following it was
[46:53] an easy for him because people were
[46:55] there discouraging him your master will
[46:57] be taken from you why you going there
[46:59] why are you praying why are you
[47:01] desperate why are you still going out to
[47:04] service can the church see man but he
[47:09] never lost his focus it didn't matter
[47:11] what was going on he never lost his
[47:13] focus because he wanted a manifestation
[47:16] of God for his life he wanted something
[47:20] to happen in his life until he finally
[47:23] crossed Jordan and Elijah said him what
[47:26] do you want
[47:30] what do you want he said I want a double
[47:34] portion Eliezer looked at him you asked
[47:39] a hard thing it's one thing to have what
[47:41] I have one double you want the same
[47:47] world that I do I'm greater works than
[47:49] these shall you do that's what you're
[47:51] asking for you want the dynamics of this
[47:56] should be a refilling you want more you
[47:58] you just do with the feeling you want
[48:00] refilling after you one can you ask a
[48:06] hard thing but if you see me go if you
[48:10] see me go if you see me go you could
[48:13] have what you asked for can the church
[48:16] him and the musician good the musician
[48:18] go get ready to come off I don't know
[48:22] how i made about amazing and i could
[48:30] imagine we read the scripture the
[48:33] chariot appears never before has
[48:38] anything been seen like this but Elijah
[48:41] is not focus on the chariot he's not
[48:44] focus on the horseman he's not focused
[48:47] in the fire he wants the mantle he ones
[48:53] what was wrapping Elijah all along he
[48:56] want a covering that Elijah had he won
[48:59] the same message that Elijah was
[49:01] preaching he won the same seventh seal
[49:03] seventh and anointing that Elijah had
[49:06] and when he lied is going up he didn't
[49:09] even say goodbye Elijah I don't know
[49:12] we're not no no no no no no the moment
[49:14] he Leiter taking up he's there waiting
[49:15] for the mantle because he knows that
[49:18] that's
[49:21] somebody help me preach down and when
[49:24] Elijah grab the mantle what did he do
[49:28] the first thing you did he ripped his
[49:30] mantle into you see away with my ideas
[49:35] away with what worked for me away and
[49:38] how I used to do things away with how we
[49:41] used to have services away with how I
[49:45] there was no more IIIi nothing away with
[49:49] all of that and he took eli just mental
[49:52] and i love how the skiff tourettes the
[49:56] the scripted as he stood he just stood
[49:59] at the bank and there's a pause and then
