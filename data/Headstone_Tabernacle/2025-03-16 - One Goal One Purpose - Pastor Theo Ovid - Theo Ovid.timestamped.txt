[53:05] animals he made us a little lower than
[53:08] the
[53:08] angels we could fall back into animal
[53:11] behavior and bad behavior but God called
[53:13] us to something a little higher I want
[53:16] to strive towards that calling that God
[53:19] plac in our hearts the devil could take
[53:21] some but he cannot take all oh blessed
[53:24] be the name of the Lord so I'm grateful
[53:27] to God to be here to see all of you out
[53:28] this morning we are appreciated for the
[53:31] Lord appreciate to the Lord uh Friday
[53:35] Friday uh Bible
[53:37] study
[53:39] man front part and back
[53:42] part all the animals made and there was
[53:44] no man there was no visible I call that
[53:48] first man the backp man part in the back
[53:50] you can't see but that's the real man
[53:53] that's the subconscious man that's part
[53:55] you can't see
[53:57] see what I'm talk about when somebody
[53:59] say Do you believe you'll be healed and
[54:01] you said yes sometimes that just the
[54:03] conscious man but the subconscious is
[54:05] doubting and questioning so we need to
[54:07] get that back part man lined up with the
[54:09] front man we need to get when you say
[54:11] amen and the front it mean amen behind
[54:14] that'll make a whole difference isn't
[54:16] that something so God couldn't instruct
[54:19] that Spirit man about telling his soil
[54:21] in Genesis 1 but when he form Man Out of
[54:23] the Dust of the earth which is the front
[54:24] part man now he could talk to man that's
[54:26] right and say listen till the soil sir
[54:28] dress it name the animals and so now
[54:31] they could see him and he could see them
[54:34] physical man isn't that right there's a
[54:35] reason why I'm saying those things you
[54:37] know because when we come back to the
[54:38] back of the book you realize the back of
[54:40] the book is only in the book is written
[54:43] but on the back side is sealed with
[54:44] Seven Seals hallelujah hallelujah and
[54:47] the 81 silence is the only mechanism for
[54:51] the back to come to the front and that's
[54:53] under silence so God put silence under
[54:56] the seven seal but there's something on
[54:57] the back of the book called seven
[54:59] Thunders isn't that something else this
[55:01] morning so we in for Revival because God
[55:04] promised it we in for a breakthrough
[55:07] because God promised it we in for signs
[55:10] wonders and miracles because God
[55:11] promised it and God is not a man that
[55:13] would lie if God give a promise he has
[55:16] the ability to fulfill that promise
[55:18] sometime we fail in our promises but God
[55:20] never fail and he will not fail you the
[55:23] devil is a liar this morning I don't
[55:25] care what your dream last last night
[55:26] what thoughts bang your mind last night
[55:28] God is still alive and he is still on
[55:30] the throne oh praise the name of the
[55:33] Lord let me say it again God is still
[55:35] alive and he is still on the throne and
[55:37] he going to prove himself to be the same
[55:39] yesterday today and forever in this
[55:42] generation glory to God he going to
[55:44] prove himself are we going to read it
[55:46] but I'm say when I'm gone healing is not
[55:48] gone he was going but healing wasn't
[55:50] going the mighty Angel is still on the
[55:52] earth the angel of the Lord is on the
[55:54] earth fixing things around that angel is
[55:56] here this morning that angel is around
[55:59] the world glory to God fixing things

[1:00:07] all the words of the Lord hallelujah
[1:00:10] Colossians chapter 1 reading from verse
[1:00:24] 15 who speaking about Christ is the
[1:00:27] image of the invisible God sir the
[1:00:30] firstborn of every creature sir for by
[1:00:33] him were all things created that are in
[1:00:34] heaven that are in Earth visible and
[1:00:36] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:00:39] dominions or principalities or Powers
[1:00:42] all things were created by Him and for
[1:00:46] him and he is before all things and by
[1:00:49] him all things consist and he is the
[1:00:52] head of the body not the pope he is the
[1:00:55] head head of the body the church who is
[1:00:58] the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:01:01] dead that in all things he might have
[1:01:03] the
[1:01:04] preeminence for it pleased the father
[1:01:06] that in him should all fullness dwell
[1:01:09] and having made peace through the blood
[1:01:11] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[1:01:13] things unto himself by him I say whether
[1:01:15] they be things in Earth or things in
[1:01:17] heaven and you that will sometime
[1:01:19] elimated and enemies in your mind by
[1:01:22] Wicked Works yet now had he reconciled
[1:01:26] in the body of his flesh true debt to
[1:01:28] present you holy and unblamable
[1:01:31] unreprovable in his sight if he continue
[1:01:36] in the Fate grounded and settled and be
[1:01:39] not move away from the hope of the
[1:01:41] Gospel which you have heard and which
[1:01:43] was preached to every creature which is
[1:01:46] under Heaven whereof I Paul I made a
[1:01:48] minister who now rejoice in my
[1:01:50] sufferings for you and fill up that
[1:01:53] which is behind of the Affliction of
[1:01:54] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[1:01:57] which is the church whereof I am made a
[1:01:59] minister according to dispensation of
[1:02:02] God which is given to me for you to
[1:02:04] fulfill the word of God even a mystery
[1:02:07] which has been hid from ages and from
[1:02:09] Generations but now is made manifest to
[1:02:12] his Saints to whom God would make known
[1:02:14] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:02:17] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:02:20] Christ in you the hope of glory whom we
[1:02:24] preach warning every man
[1:02:26] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:02:29] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:02:33] Christ Jesus where unto I also labor
[1:02:36] striving according to his working which
[1:02:38] worketh in me mightily our last
[1:02:40] scripture one verse of vertion 8 verse1
[1:02:44] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:02:46] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:02:48] space of half an hour let us pray father
[1:02:50] God has been acqu a couple of weeks
[1:02:52] having these things Lord laying here to
[1:02:54] prepare them for your people and now
[1:02:56] this hour has come and this is just the
[1:02:58] beginning and father I pray you take me
[1:03:00] out of the way and speak to them and
[1:03:01] feed them the bread of life granted Lord
[1:03:04] in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be
[1:03:05] seated praise God so this have been
[1:03:07] riding me for quite a while now uh and
[1:03:11] today I be I be uh believe I'm going to
[1:03:13] present this to you of a title one goal
[1:03:18] one
[1:03:19] purpose that's the title one goal one
[1:03:23] purpose let's go are you ready this
[1:03:26] morning all
[1:03:29] right there may be things that God has
[1:03:31] added to the church which stimulate FEI
[1:03:34] but now when I am gone healing isn't
[1:03:37] gone healing ought to be more than it
[1:03:40] was before we come here that's the
[1:03:43] purpose is to get the people in their
[1:03:46] mind in the spirit of the latter
[1:03:50] days we in the latter day you believe
[1:03:52] that we are the world is in the spirit
[1:03:55] of the latter day but the church is not
[1:03:57] in the latter day spirit yet did you get
[1:04:00] that we are in the latter day the world
[1:04:03] is in the spirit of the Latter day but
[1:04:05] the church is not in the latter day
[1:04:08] spirit yet that why they
[1:04:11] going how they say it say it I don't
[1:04:13] have it we could say l but there no
[1:04:16] translation for
[1:04:18] that but slow and
[1:04:20] sluggish and lazy what was the
[1:04:24] mic show up TR a new
[1:04:28] one that's a new one so so watch in
[1:04:32] other words and and you will see who we
[1:04:33] put responsible for this in other words
[1:04:36] we may be in a portion but God wants his
[1:04:40] church so in the spirit they would just
[1:04:43] fit in just anywhere God would to lead
[1:04:46] them
[1:04:47] to the latter days of the rening world
[1:04:50] man look at the places eat and drink and
[1:04:51] Mar and given in marriage all the
[1:04:53] immorals there is in the world the devil
[1:04:54] send down his troups in the latterday
[1:04:57] spirit but we
[1:04:59] ministers haven't got the church yet in
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:03] spirit so he put the rug he put the hug
[1:05:06] he put the whole hug upon the ministers
[1:05:08] to get the people in the spirit because
[1:05:10] the ministers have a choice get the
[1:05:12] people on them get the people to their
[1:05:14] group or church or get them in the
[1:05:16] spirit latter the spirit that they could
[1:05:19] look for the coming of the Lord not look
[1:05:21] for the minister look for the coming of
[1:05:22] the Lord not look for their group look
[1:05:24] for the coming of the Lord in the spirit
[1:05:27] isn't that right but talk about the John
[1:05:30] was in the spirit in the Lord's day
[1:05:32] isn't that right he said now watch was
[1:05:33] the spirit of the Lord's day he said the
[1:05:35] first thing you have to do get in the
[1:05:37] spirit how are these Revelations going
[1:05:40] to come over to you to get in the spirit

[1:21:03] a seed and in the right kind of ground
[1:21:06] it will bring forth His Kind let's go
[1:21:08] then he said this notice ran 10
[1:21:11] 1-7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed
[1:21:16] to the bride by the messenger of the
[1:21:19] laan
[1:21:21] church not
[1:21:23] some all shout out all all not some and
[1:21:27] a man from Trinidad not some and a man
[1:21:30] from America not some and a man from
[1:21:32] Europe or South America all would be
[1:21:35] revealed and this revelation will be
[1:21:38] placed on books and
[1:21:39] tapes all oh praise God praise God isn't
[1:21:44] that right Hallelujah so in that day we
[1:21:47] seen him come down eat up the little
[1:21:49] book he put one foot on the land on the
[1:21:51] sea swore by him the L forever and when
[1:21:53] he did seven out of their voices and
[1:21:56] when the seven Turners out their voices
[1:21:57] John said he was about to write he said
[1:21:59] don't write it he sealed it and somebody
[1:22:01] said well them seven sees but a brandom
[1:22:04] that will be revealed in the last days
[1:22:05] some great mystery how we get closer to
[1:22:07] God hear the question no sir it can't be
[1:22:12] he said what it is it's a revelation on
[1:22:16] what has been missed back there to bring
[1:22:19] it's already wrote here it's in here it
[1:22:22] is to reveal what's already been written
[1:22:25] because you cannot add one word or take
[1:22:28] one word from
[1:22:29] it oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:22:32] hallelujah hallelujah God's mystery
[1:22:35] secret secret mystery he had before the
[1:22:38] world began that was in the back part of
[1:22:41] God's mind there was something he was
[1:22:43] trying to achieve he had a motive in
[1:22:45] doing it in order to let himself be
[1:22:48] Express first there wasn't even a Moon
[1:22:50] Star atom molecule or anything before he
[1:22:53] was he was God he wasn't exactly God at
[1:22:56] that time because God in is the object
[1:22:58] of worship so in the form of Elohim
[1:23:00] self-existing before Moon star and Earth
[1:23:03] he was there with his thoughts thinking
[1:23:07] his attributes as the thought huah Gene
[1:23:12] unexpressed and then when he brought the
[1:23:14] expression that Elohim became the logos
[1:23:17] word and that word is what you get in
[1:23:20] John John 1:1 in the beginning
[1:23:22] Hallelujah was the word because the
[1:23:24] begin in the beginning was the birth of
[1:23:26] time but before the beginning it was
[1:23:29] Elohim self-existent because he wanted
[1:23:32] to get to us humans a view of him or
[1:23:37] revelation of him it has always been
[1:23:39] about him not about us this message is
[1:23:41] not about us it's about him it's about
[1:23:44] Christ being revealed to his church
[1:23:48] Hallelujah do you get it now all right
[1:23:52] so watch so when he created the Angels
[1:23:55] he became God because God is the object
[1:23:57] of worship so in his great mind he
[1:24:00] wanted these attributes to be Express in
[1:24:03] him was love in him was to be a father
[1:24:06] in him was to be a son in him was to be
[1:24:08] a savior but there was nobody lost there
[1:24:10] was no children Express but it was in
[1:24:13] him hallelujah oh Hallelujah it was
[1:24:14] locked up in himl as a thought as a gene
[1:24:18] as a mind as the intelligence he wanted
[1:24:20] to be a father he wanted to be a savior
[1:24:23] but there was no lost he can't take
[1:24:25] humanity and just lost them no he had to
[1:24:28] have a plan oh give the Lord some
[1:24:29] Praises hallelujah hallelujah in my
[1:24:33] opinion the first thing he made was
[1:24:34] angels and they worship him that made
[1:24:37] him God he started from De he said what
[1:24:39] before there was a molecule there was
[1:24:40] nothing it was Darkness now God had a
[1:24:43] purpose here we go and a hidden Mystery
[1:24:45] and that is what I want to speak about
[1:24:47] the church this morning the hidden
[1:24:48] Mystery that God had in his mind
[1:24:51] Hallelujah and this is where I get a
[1:24:52] taught from one goal and one purpose and
[1:24:54] I want everything we say around this one
[1:24:56] goal and one purpose not two goals not
[1:24:59] six goals one goal and one purpose he
[1:25:03] had one objective had one motive a
[1:25:06] purpose behind what he was doing
[1:25:08] everything is revolved around this one
[1:25:10] goal and one purpose not two goals one
[1:25:13] goal and one purpose any Minister
[1:25:16] preaching have to connect with that one
[1:25:18] goal and one purpose Hallelujah every
[1:25:21] mystery reveal has to be connected to
[1:25:23] that one goal one purpose if there is
[1:25:26] seven tunders it has to connect to that
[1:25:28] one goal one purpose if there a bad
[1:25:31] Revival it has to be connected with one
[1:25:33] goal one purpose Hallelujah whatever M
[1:25:36] relation whatever teaching whatever
[1:25:39] mystery whatever inspiration has to be
[1:25:41] connected to that one goal and one
[1:25:44] purpose Give the Lord some Praises not a
[1:25:46] d move unless we say so give the Lord a
[1:25:49] shout in the house
[1:25:51] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:55] Hallelujah let's go God's great mystery
[1:26:00] it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody
[1:26:04] know nothing about it even the angels
[1:26:07] didn't understand it he didn't reveal
[1:26:10] it are you ready that's the reason under
[1:26:14] our seventh mystery when the seventh
[1:26:18] seed was open there was silence
[1:26:25] first seal White Horse then red horse
[1:26:28] and black horse and Pale Horse and set
[1:26:31] of symbols but when the seven open
[1:26:33] silence you're looking you hear nothing
[1:26:35] you see nothing just silence for the
[1:26:38] space of half an hour your name was not
[1:26:41] under the first seal your name was not
[1:26:42] under the second seal your name was
[1:26:44] under the third or fourth or fifth or
[1:26:45] sixth seal your name was under the seven
[1:26:48] seal that's a seal of life that's God's
[1:26:52] seal that's a seal of completion that's
[1:26:54] the Seal of finish that's the seal to
[1:26:57] birth the manifestation of the sons of
[1:26:59] God hallelujah that's the seal to bring
[1:27:02] on the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:27:05] that seven seal and there was nothing
[1:27:07] under there oh give the Lord a sh Oh
[1:27:11] Glory to God hallelujah
[1:27:16] hallelujah silence don't misinterpret
[1:27:19] silence you
[1:27:21] know silence is a powerful thing you
[1:27:23] know when the sun come up in the morning
[1:27:25] you
[1:27:27] Creek the Sun come making no s noise no
[1:27:32] silence the sun just rise TR his rise
[1:27:37] just silence the bird the worm form a
[1:27:41] cocon around itself and after time it
[1:27:45] just breaks out into a butterfly it
[1:27:48] breaks a silence a silence is something
[1:27:51] else don't fool with silence silence
[1:27:54] have something behind it hallelujah
[1:27:58] hallelujah you see a tree with a strong
[1:28:00] trunk and great and great branches but
[1:28:03] that is not its power you know the part
[1:28:06] that is powerful is what is below the
[1:28:08] ground that what you can't see how deep
[1:28:10] it is how grounded it is hallelujah
[1:28:13] that's the silent part that's the hidden
[1:28:16] part that's the main part that's the
[1:28:18] foundation part oh praise God so that's
[1:28:21] the reason under our seventh mystery
[1:28:24] when the seventh seed was open there was
[1:28:27] silence Jesus when he was in Earth they
[1:28:30] wanted to know when he was going to come
[1:28:33] even the son himself don't know when
[1:28:35] it's going to happen God has this all to
[1:28:39] himself it's a secret that's the reason
[1:28:42] there were silence in heaven for the
[1:28:44] space of half an hour and seven
[1:28:46] tunders utter their voices so that mean
[1:28:49] those seven tunders are connected to the
[1:28:52] coming of the Lord that's right we
[1:28:54] disconnected it is connected God put
[1:28:56] silence in it because you don't know
[1:28:57] when he's coming isn't that right
[1:28:59] Hallelujah John was forbidden to write
[1:29:01] it see the coming of the Lord oh praise
[1:29:05] the name of the Lord do you believe
[1:29:07] that he showed or reveal it in every
[1:29:10] type that's in the bibleall here we go
[1:29:12] he the statement therefore the entire
[1:29:17] Bible not some of
[1:29:19] it watch these words the entire Bible is
[1:29:24] the revelation of God's mystery in
[1:29:29] Christ the entire Bible hallu is an
[1:29:32] expression Hallelujah of one goal that
[1:29:36] God
[1:29:37] had one purpose he wanted to achieve in
[1:29:40] the entire Bible
[1:29:42] one and all the acts of the Believers
[1:29:46] Hallelujah in the Bible Hallelujah has
[1:29:48] been in type expressing what God great
[1:29:51] goal is
[1:29:54] so the believer's actions and behavior
[1:29:57] was reflecting what God goal
[1:30:01] is and now in the last days he has
[1:30:04] revealed it therefore you can see the
[1:30:07] great meaning of what is to notice and
[1:30:09] then try to bring it to the people he
[1:30:11] said this what God has revealed to me
[1:30:13] now I want to read a scripture from Luke
[1:30:16] 24:24 is a familiar scripture this is
[1:30:19] Jesus withholding himself from his
[1:30:21] disciples who is walking in in a Gloom
[1:30:25] depressed mode under his ministry for
[1:30:28] three and a half years under anointing
[1:30:30] and power and these guys under
[1:30:33] depression these guys like they don't
[1:30:36] believe and Jesus he talking to them
[1:30:39] what going on why what going on why you
[1:30:40] so sad and depressed and what going on
[1:30:43] and they giv testimony so in verse 24
[1:30:46] they explain and certain of them we with
[1:30:49] us went to the Sea fala and found it to
[1:30:51] be so as the woman had said but they saw
[1:30:53] him not
[1:30:54] no they telling Jesus
[1:30:58] that then he said unto them here this
[1:31:01] rebuke oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:31:05] believe all that the prophets have
[1:31:06] spoken ought not Christ have suffered
[1:31:09] these things and enter into his glory
[1:31:12] verse 27 and beginning that Moses and
[1:31:15] all the prophets he expounded unto them
[1:31:19] in all the
[1:31:21] scriptures the things
[1:31:24] concerning
[1:31:27] himself not the things concerning a man
[1:31:29] in
[1:31:32] Trad or some Archbishop or some
[1:31:35] Pope what he was showing is himself in
[1:31:39] the scripture himself in Abraham himself
[1:31:43] in Moses himself in Joshua himself in
[1:31:46] Joseph he could identify himself in the
[1:31:50] scripture because the entire Bible is
[1:31:53] God's revelation of Jesus
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:58] Christ so when he was unlocking or
[1:32:01] unfolding or expounding this word it was
[1:32:03] about himself do you get that we want to
[1:32:06] go on to verse 44 of that same chapter
[1:32:08] Luke
[1:32:09] 24:44 he said unto them verse 44 of Luke
[1:32:13] 24 he said unto them these are the words
[1:32:17] which I spake unto you while I was yet
[1:32:20] with you that all things must be
[1:32:23] fulfilled
[1:32:24] which were written in the law of Moses
[1:32:27] and in the prophets and in the Psalms
[1:32:28] concerning
[1:32:29] me
[1:32:31] then open he their understanding that
[1:32:37] they might understand the
[1:32:39] scriptures so now the word is
[1:32:42] open now their understanding is open he
[1:32:46] was giving them an understanding of
[1:32:48] himself in the lies of the Believers
[1:32:51] that is already written you can read
[1:32:54] about Isaac you could read about Abraham
[1:32:56] you could read about Moses you could
[1:32:58] read all that in Scrolls so he now go
[1:33:00] around to identify it is me here is me
[1:33:02] here is me here life here look Joseph
[1:33:04] reflect my Christ and so he could unfold
[1:33:06] all of that so they understand it was
[1:33:09] Christ from Genesis straight through not
[1:33:13] the devil
[1:33:14] Christ Hallelujah Christ is the mystery
[1:33:18] of God
[1:33:19] revealed oh give the Lord some
[1:33:22] Praises Hallelujah
[1:33:24] so brother bam says so therefore this
[1:33:26] word being unfolded to them was the
[1:33:29] revelation of Jesus
[1:33:32] Christ and you will see what you are to
[1:33:34] become as Jesus was a revelation of God
[1:33:38] you will be a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:33:43] oh God give the Lord that that that's
[1:33:45] enough to make a Pentecostal Shout

[1:33:54] that
[1:33:57] conscious like a conscious
[1:33:59] amen Jesus was the revelation of God you
[1:34:03] as his
[1:34:06] wife you will become and display the
[1:34:10] very revelation of Jesus
[1:34:13] Christ he's saying here what he saying
[1:34:15] search the scriptures they testify of me
[1:34:17] and then you think you have eternal life
[1:34:19] search the scriptures he said Moses and
[1:34:21] the law and so forth and the prophets
[1:34:22] and SSM spoke of him
[1:34:24] he said the scripture testify of him
[1:34:27] then he dropped this here he is the

[1:34:37] the Bible read it again because you miss
[1:34:39] something the Bible is Christ he is the
[1:34:42] word and when you read it in the
[1:34:44] beginning God created there is Christ
[1:34:47] from the Amen in Revelation that every

[2:09:33] them men didn't know what they were
[2:09:35] doing they only knew that they were led
[2:09:38] by the spirit to do something it was
[2:09:41] holding it back in the last days for
[2:09:44] this great Revelation he expresses
[2:09:46] himself himself in Moses and David in
[2:09:49] Joseph in Elijah yet it showed Jesus
[2:09:53] Christ expressed perfectly yet never
[2:09:56] given his secret in full waiting for it
[2:09:59] to be made known in the last days as he
[2:10:01] promised waiting for it to be fully
[2:10:05] comprehended before he could express it
[2:10:08] the whole thing now the coming of the
[2:10:11] Lord is a mystery we don't know when
[2:10:13] he's coming how he is coming but we know
[2:10:15] he's coming you see all the mysteries of
[2:10:18] God was waiting for this last day
[2:10:20] Hallelujah after he already
[2:10:23] completed then he reveals and shows what
[2:10:27] he's done hallelujah so watch this this
[2:10:31] seven Church Ages was a mystery nobody
[2:10:34] knew it took a prophet to take a pyramid
[2:10:37] and put it in the pyramid because he is
[2:10:40] at the end so now he's looking back and
[2:10:42] he Paul irenius Mar Columba Luther
[2:10:47] because that is how God does it you
[2:10:49] could have to be here at the end and
[2:10:50] look back
[2:10:51] and the mystery begin to unfold so
[2:10:54] because he's at the end he could begin
[2:10:56] to unfold what took place all
[2:11:00] along now I can't get into it too much
[2:11:03] we understand by Revelation that the
[2:11:06] church ages is really the unfolding of
[2:11:09] the
[2:11:11] seed the history of the seed life
[2:11:16] because when you put a seed into the
[2:11:17] ground it doesn't come a seed right away
[2:11:21] is a young shoot it begin to unfold
[2:11:23] branches tassel it unfolding and at the
[2:11:27] top it come back to seed so when you
[2:11:29] plant a corn seed it doesn't get corn
[2:11:32] right you get a shoot right it begins to
[2:11:34] unfall that's the church age ISJ the
[2:11:36] life of the seed begin to unfold First
[2:11:39] Age second age third age fourth age then
[2:11:43] it come
[2:11:44] Luther justification Wesley
[2:11:47] sanctification Pentecostal looking like
[2:11:49] seed but they are shock looking like
[2:11:53] seed and if you put it in the message
[2:11:55] people in the message looking like
[2:11:58] seed you could tell people I say
[2:12:03] so we not making a mistake with what we
[2:12:06] saying looking like seed but they are
[2:12:08] shock and the only way you could
[2:12:10] understand what the shock is when the
[2:12:11] sun
[2:12:14] comes the sunlight exposes the shock
[2:12:17] because the shock does turn dry but the
[2:12:19] sea does turn golden brown
[2:12:21] with the same trials same testings same
[2:12:25] Sun same pressure one drying up and one
[2:12:29] getting golden brown
[2:12:36] ah if Satan had this Revelation he never
[2:12:40] let the son hit you never let the son
[2:12:43] hit you because that son only hit you
[2:12:45] you're getting rip because you can't
[2:12:47] bury a a green seed or preach back to me
[2:12:50] somebody
[2:12:51] you can only bury a ripe seed so when
[2:12:54] you are ripe and what is the evidence of
[2:12:56] ripeness Brotherly kindness Spirit of
[2:12:59] forgiveness when you can forgive you are
[2:13:02] showing that you're mature you're on top
[2:13:04] of the pyramid you're ready for Holy
[2:13:06] Spirit oh
[2:13:09] God I don't know what to preach again I
[2:13:12] don't know how to say this again
[2:13:14] brotherly kindness identifies how ripe
[2:13:18] you are hallah
[2:13:26] Hall that ministers think preaching a
[2:13:29] ton of mysteries Iden right there it for

[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:52] [Applause]
[2:16:54] I'm going to try to wrap up here
[2:16:55] [Applause]
[2:16:58] somewhere so after it's
[2:17:01] completed then he reveals hallelujah
[2:17:04] what he has done hallelujah then he said
[2:17:07] this it's just like this comparing the
[2:17:10] Seven Seals when God used Martin Luther
[2:17:13] for the coming out of that first CH age
[2:17:15] now Luther don't have a clue he making a
[2:17:18] age
[2:17:21] the Catholic Church killed how much
[2:17:23] millions of Christians 68 million
[2:17:25] Christians so they thought everybody
[2:17:27] dead stone dead that's it they reing and
[2:17:29] ruling so God had to find a man in the
[2:17:31] Catholic
[2:17:33] church so Luther reading his Bible
[2:17:36] discover the J live by FEI Hallelujah he
[2:17:39] going up on his knees and it thundered
[2:17:41] into him he heard the voice of God like
[2:17:43] a thunder the J shall live by faith and
[2:17:46] he recognize it not by rules and not by
[2:17:49] Mary and Joseph
[2:17:51] and Penance so Luther free himself so
[2:17:55] God went and find a man in the Catholic
[2:17:57] church God could find a man behind the
[2:17:59] enemy line you
[2:18:01] know God can find a man in the enemy
[2:18:03] camp you know and bring him out you know
[2:18:06] God found Luther a Catholic anoint him
[2:18:10] Inspire him and he came out to J by
[2:18:13] faith and preach
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:17] justification now the Catholic chch
[2:18:19] control the text and the word and what
[2:18:21] not the people the Bible Hallelujah only
[2:18:23] the priest give signal
[2:18:25] so and something like that bless them
[2:18:28] and that's all they know not only that
[2:18:29] they preach in Latin too so they totally
[2:18:31] clueless you have nowh to get all know
[2:18:33] take your last
[2:18:36] C so God anointed Wesley hallu and heu
[2:18:41] around that time the Germans invite in
[2:18:43] invented the printing press watch how
[2:18:46] God has do things to print the word so
[2:18:49] now I have a man and Ed and now the
[2:18:52] press to print scripture text and that's
[2:18:55] how it's spread now Hallelujah with
[2:18:57] Wesley Hallelujah gospel spreading now
[2:19:00] after that God raised up the
[2:19:02] Pentecostals because know they have the
[2:19:03] word so they un expectation because God
[2:19:06] want to break the spirit age which is
[2:19:08] the open door age no messenger no man
[2:19:10] just open the door for the spirit to
[2:19:12] come in and God used them to break into
[2:19:15] the spirit realm because you have to
[2:19:17] have the spirit a platform for that
[2:19:19] Elijah to come in
[2:19:22] Make Way for messiah Oh Glory to God so
[2:19:26] when William brandham come he came to
[2:19:28] the
[2:19:29] Pentecostal he came to his own and his
[2:19:32] own rejected him they were supposed to
[2:19:34] go into the Rapture but they were expose
[2:19:37] a shock they reject the word to bring
[2:19:39] them a Perfection that's why to this day
[2:19:41] they still failing and falling and they
[2:19:43] order 30,000
[2:19:45] people and man still falling by this one
[2:19:48] and that one man still backsliding
[2:19:49] because they never went to the word
[2:19:51] because the word is what bring
[2:19:53] character so all the pentec I have was
[2:19:56] gifts with anointing no life to this day
[2:20:01] is still gift with no life but you who
[2:20:04] came to believe this message of Malachi
[2:20:06] for you have been
[2:20:08] invited to get you shaped into the word
[2:20:12] image you have been invited to get your
[2:20:16] character to characterize to the image
[2:20:18] of Jesus Christ it's an invitation you
[2:20:22] accept it or you reject it you don't
[2:20:23] have to accept it you could say a nice
[2:20:25] Church M and love yourself I have a
[2:20:27] scripture for you men shall be lovers of
[2:20:28] their ownself you could stay right there
[2:20:29] in that scripture or you could hate
[2:20:31] yourself like job I hate myself oh give
[2:20:34] the Lord a shout and you want to be like
[2:20:36] Jesus so you ready to show
[2:20:40] [Applause]
[2:20:42] off I'm going to
[2:20:44] close if I come to this way you will
[2:20:46] kill me Hallelujah and I wouldn't allow
[2:20:48] that
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:53] I can't right
[2:20:55] now finish yet so pulling you're pulling
[2:20:59] you're pulling Hallelujah almost wiped
[2:21:01] out all right so watch this now so watch
[2:21:04] when God used Martin Luther for the
[2:21:07] coming out of that first church age when
[2:21:09] he used John Wesley watch this and he
[2:21:12] gradually brought them out and was
[2:21:15] revealing in them that church age
[2:21:20] revealing where in them so they were
[2:21:24] living out something that they had no
[2:21:29] idea so Luther living a life and is
[2:21:33] living out the word in the realm of the
[2:21:35] spirit Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:21:41] another Bible being written Temperance
[2:21:44] patience godness brotherly kindness on
[2:21:46] top of that Holy Spirit to cap the
[2:21:49] Pyramid of Our Lives so we are the only
[2:21:51] age having a complete revelation of
[2:21:54] Jesus Christ that identify when that
[2:21:57] which is perfect is come that was just a
[2:21:59] text Paul wrote you know but we have a
[2:22:01] revelation and understanding from
[2:22:03] partial realization to perfect
[2:22:06] realization that we going to connect to
[2:22:07] the cap of the pyramid to bring back the
[2:22:10] manifestation of the sons of God the
[2:22:12] devil can't handle that he said 340 days
