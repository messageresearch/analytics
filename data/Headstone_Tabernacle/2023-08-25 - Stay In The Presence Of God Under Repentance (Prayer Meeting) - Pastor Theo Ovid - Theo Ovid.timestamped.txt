[14:45] God bless you since and it's a blessing
[14:48] to be here tonight
[14:49] and uh what few things I'd like to share
[14:52] with you if you have your Bibles
[14:53] uh
[14:55] I just want to say a few things from the
[14:56] prophet and then we're going to read
[14:57] some scriptures from Psalms
[14:59] and I think I would share the screen as
[15:01] you would able to read it or you could
[15:03] all be in Barbers and and read it but
[15:05] the title I have tonight is T in the
[15:07] presence of God
[15:09] on the repentance
[15:11] stay in the presence of God
[15:13] on the repentance the prophet was seen
[15:16] here the journey time of Ezra the
[15:18] children of Israel have become backslid
[15:21] start to mix up any more by woman and so
[15:24] on like that he says what a picture that
[15:26] is of today about churches your way they
[15:29] are falling from the old fashioned human
[15:32] line that God laid on for the church
[15:35] the precepts that we were to live by the
[15:38] church is communism fornication with the
[15:42] world it's out got out into the world I
[15:45] began to dally with the world and it
[15:47] embarrassed the prophet so much
[15:49] so when he come before God
[15:52] he blush his face and that blushing is
[15:54] to be ashamed to be embarrassed
[15:57] and it seems like the morality of his
[16:00] people is hurting so bad until he set
[16:03] down and anointed himself pluck his hair
[16:05] out because it was heavy-hearted before
[16:08] the Lord in prayer then when they even
[16:11] sacrifice was offered
[16:13] he went into the temple
[16:15] fell on his knees and blushed before God
[16:18] for the sins of the people
[16:20] now hear this part
[16:22] he didn't blush for this college streak
[16:24] of the red light district
[16:27] he didn't blush for the booze Drinkers
[16:29] and Elwoods well it was bad as it may be
[16:33] but he blushed because the sin of the
[16:37] elect
[16:39] he blushed because
[16:41] the sin of the elect and what we need to
[16:44] do is some more prophets with enough God
[16:47] in their hearts to blush
[16:49] in the presence of God for sins of the
[16:52] people who call themselves the people of
[16:54] God and do in the way they are doing
[16:57] what a disgrace we have brought to this
[16:59] place
[16:59] the morals of all people
[17:03] this is not an easy subject to speak one
[17:05] I could think of many things that is
[17:08] easier to speak on
[17:09] but brother if somebody don't sound in
[17:12] the sinful adulteress D but we live in a
[17:15] colder colors what's going to happen
[17:16] somebody gonna speak the thing somebody
[17:19] got to place it before the people past
[17:22] Ezra didn't want to do it but it was in
[17:24] his heart
[17:25] and this is what I get to know
[17:27] when you see a servant of God
[17:31] get so sincere
[17:33] to live on his face with his hands and
[17:35] the ear
[17:37] praying to God
[17:38] and blushing
[17:40] because the iniquity of the people
[17:43] then
[17:44] you want to see a Revival start
[17:47] and hear the quote
[17:49] a man
[17:51] cannot lay in the presence of God
[17:54] a church
[17:56] cannot leave steep in the presence of
[18:00] God under repentance
[18:03] unless
[18:04] the Holy Spirit
[18:06] comes down
[18:08] and gives unction and Power
[18:11] to start a move of God in there among
[18:15] these people just got to be let me read
[18:18] that again
[18:19] a man
[18:20] cannot lay in the presence of God
[18:23] a church
[18:25] cannot see in the presence of God under
[18:29] repentance
[18:31] unless
[18:32] the Holy Spirit comes down
[18:34] and gives um and Power
[18:37] to start the move of God in dear among
[18:41] those people just got to be
[18:43] he said what we are doing today we are
[18:45] Partners on the back we are calling it
[18:46] this that and a Revival when there's no
[18:49] Revival there's a stirring of emotion
[18:51] called a religion among the people but
[18:52] no Revival that religious group in that
[18:54] day they had us still in that day but
[18:56] they needed a Revival

[20:36] it works at all because of all my
[20:38] enemies
[20:39] depart from me all the workers of
[20:41] iniquity

[21:54] sin
[21:56] for this shall everyone that is Godly
[21:59] pray unto thee
[22:00] in a time when Dome has been formed
[22:04] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[22:07] they shall not come now then
[22:10] Thou Art my Hiding Place
[22:13] thou shall preserve me from trouble
[22:15] though shall Compass me about which song
[22:17] of Deliverance

[22:22] way which Thou shalt

[23:26] and my sin is ever before me
[23:29] against thee the only have I sinned and
[23:33] done this evil in thy sight
[23:35] that though might just be justified when
[23:37] those speakers
[23:38] and be clear when those judges
[23:41] behold
[23:43] I was shaping iniquity
[23:45] and in sin did my mother conceived me
[23:47] behold though desire is truth in the
[23:51] inward parts
[23:52] and in the hidden part though shall make
[23:55] me to no wisdom
[23:57] please me with his son and I shall be

[24:41] and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
[24:44] righteousness O Lord

[24:49] shoot for thy Grace for though desire is
[24:52] not sacrifice as I will give it all the
[24:55] Lars desire the lightest nothing but
[24:57] offering the sacrifices of God
[25:00] our broken spirit
[25:02] a broken and contrite heart through God
[25:05] that will not despise
[25:08] do good in thy good pleasure design
[25:12] build out the walls of Jerusalem
[25:14] then shall not be pleased with the
[25:17] sacrifices of the righteous with burnt
[25:19] offering and the whole burnt offering
[25:22] then shall they offer Bullock
[25:25] upon thine water
[25:27] and we want to go to Psalms 102.
[25:31] Psalms one or two refine it
[25:36] three four
[25:38] hear my prayer oh Lord

[25:43] hide not thy Feast on me in the day when
[25:45] I'm in trouble
[25:46] inclined and ear unto me
[25:49] in the day when I call answer me
[25:52] speedily
[25:53] for my days are consumed like smoke my
[25:56] bones are burned as an earth my heart is
[25:59] smitten and wizard like grass so that I
[26:01] forget to eat my bread my my reason of
[26:03] the voice of my groin and my bones
[26:05] cleave to my skin I'm like a pelican of
[26:08] the Wilderness I'm like all of the
[26:10] desert I watch and I'm as I Sparrow
[26:13] alone upon the house Stone my enemies
[26:16] report me all the day these that are mad
[26:19] against me are sworn against me I have
[26:21] eaten ashes like bread and mingled my
[26:23] drink with beeping because of dying a
[26:26] dimension and Iraq when I was Lifted Me
[26:28] Up and passed me down my days are like a
[26:31] shadow I decline it and I will visit
[26:33] like grass but though Lord shall endure
[26:36] forever and the remembrance unto all
[26:39] generations though shall arise
[26:42] upon Zion for the time
[26:48] is come
[26:50] for like servants take pleasure in the
[26:52] storms and favor the dusteroth so the
[26:56] Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord
[26:58] and all the kings of the earth thy Glory
[27:02] when the Lord shall build up Zion he
[27:04] shall appear in his glory
[27:06] he will regard the prayer of the
[27:08] destitute and not despise their prayer
[27:11] this shall be written for the generation
[27:14] to come and the people we shall be
[27:16] created shall praise the Lord for he had
[27:19] looked down upon the height of his
[27:20] Sanctuary from Heavenly the Lord be holy
[27:23] Earth they hear the groaning of the
[27:25] prisoner to loose those that are
[27:27] appointed to death to declare the name
[27:30] of the Lord in Zion and his praise in
[27:33] Jerusalem
[27:34] when the people are gathered together
[27:37] and the kingdoms to serve the Lord he
[27:40] weakened my strength in the way he shot
[27:41] my days I said oh my God
[27:44] take me not away in the midst of my days
[27:48] the years that showed all generations of
[27:51] all
[27:52] has only the foundation of the earth and
[27:54] the heavens are the work of thine hands
[27:56] they Shall Perish but Dosha and go ye
[27:59] all of them shall works all like in
[28:01] garment as a vested shall thou changed
[28:04] them and they shall be changed but
[28:06] though at the scene and thy ears shall
[28:09] have no end the children of thy servant
[28:11] shall continue
[28:12] and their seed shall be established
[28:15] before thee
[28:16] Psalms 130
[28:19] and we read three four out of the depths
[28:23] of I Cried unto thee O Lord Lord

[28:29] let thine ears be attentive to the force
[28:32] of my supplication
[28:34] if the Lord should Mark his iniquities
[28:37] oh Lord who shall stand
[28:39] but there is forgiveness with thee that
[28:42] though must be feared
[28:43] I wait for the Lord
[28:46] my soul bottle wheat and in his word do
