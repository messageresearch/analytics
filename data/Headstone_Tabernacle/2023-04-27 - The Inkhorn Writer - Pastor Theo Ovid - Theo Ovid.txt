chapter 66 1 verse 8. Ezekiel chapter 9 I want to read from verse one to six Revelation chapter 7 I want to read verse one to four thanks for coming out tonight it's good to be here amen Isaiah 66 8. who had heard such a thing what's seeing such a thing shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as I am travilled she brought forth her children Ezekiel chapter 9. beautiful verse 1. he quite also in my ears with the Lord's voice saying caused them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate towards the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was cruel with linen with a writer's in corn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the prison holder and the glory of the god of Israel had gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was to the Cheshire of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers in corn on his side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him to the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have you pity slay utterly old and young both means and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then the beginner the ancient men which were before the house our last scripture is from Revelation chapter seven you want to read from verse one and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the Earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor in any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to her the Earth and the Sea seeing who needless sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord my my mind it's good to be in his presence tonight Avatar the ink horn writer that's the title have tonight the incorn writer and an inspiration sealed in or sealed out on a context scripture I'll tell you where that scripture Sunday evening First Corinthians 12 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body pray this prayer he said dear Lord Jesus we are summoned again in your name with great expectation for your point of the quickening power of God to bring us into recognition of our position and place and all responsibilities of being a call people separated from the world dedicated to God Grant Lord tonight that the blessings of God will guide us and direct us in the things we do and see that it might bring honor and glory to your name so he was under expectation for the all point of the quickening power what are you on the expectation for tonight oh Hallelujah you have to be under expectation for that quick then power From the Inside Man brother Branham you know you would like to know what I think the greatest need of the church today would you like what I think where I think the lacking is is no soul trivial the people are not broke up enough listen to those words the people are not broken up enough there is no burden seemingly you give me someone that's so taught about lost souls that they cry and are wanting a Revival so bad till they can hardly eat they simply can't you can't continue if you read the history of the world and religious history you will find out it always take that kind of spirit to bring a Revival what kind of spirit Brokenness broken Spirit broken hearts you're feeling uh to pour out you want to repent you want to make things right you want to be reconciled to God you want to humble yourself to the Cross you want to lay at Christ's feet it takes that kind of spirit to bring a Revival not arrogance not Pride not you and your own self and your own thing people not caught up and and have a burden about Jesus Christ when you fall in love with the Lord you want to do the things that pleases God so not your children for you it's not the family first not what you feel first is what God first what Jesus won first so Jesus become the team of your life Jesus become the center point of your life everything is wrong with All Around Jesus not this is me no this is known it's about Jesus it's not about you oh Hallelujah so let's see saying that's right and then he quote the scripture he read when Zion travail and I think uh I I I when Zion travil I think is a better word why there's a big Echo here Isaac when Zion travil why she brought four children you have to be tore up the atmosphere or anything you have to be torn up so sometimes God allowed things to happen to break our Spirits yes to embarrass and shame us and mush us up so when we get broken we could cry because if God leave you intact you are fine Everything is Everything everything working out how your money how your house you have your car you have your land everything we're gonna find you you don't need God because things were colonize with you yeah but then God have to crush that amen break that something have to happen to break your spirit and if your spirit is not broken he will break it because there is going to be a reviver praise God do you believe that there is going to be Revival and you will have to get in that Spirit to get into the Revival oh priests and you know do you believe that Abraham said you get along with your arguments you get into the type of atmosphere if there's something in the church someone who is disobedient and acting ugly in the church and causing trouble you will never be able to have a Revival as long as that kind of atmospheres are wrong so all the rocks that offend God will move out all the people that want to be ugly go going to move them out run them out screw them out because God's going to have a right atmosphere for a Revival Oh Glory that God he will bust the rocks from Office Holy Mountain because God going to have a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle and no human ever stop that church Hallelujah no Pastor human no Elder human no Deacon human no office on human no believer human no human spirit will just stop that church from coming forth because the Mount of the Lord had spoken it o praise the name of the Lord do you believe that so so watch is somebody acting ugly in the church and causing trouble you will never be able to have a Revival as long as that kind of atmospheres are wrong you have to have everybody if you notice when the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost they were all in one place in one Accord waiting for the promise and when we get like that the Revival will be there there oh praise God hallelujah and the reason I think we have just had protractive meetings instead of a Revival because we do not have a Revival of the nation as yet we have Revival like they did in the Wesley Revival Scotland all these Revival days or Wesley they had great breaking up and worldwide Revival by John Wesley that's when I take every Revival I notice in my Ministry this is whatever I'm talking now if the people will spiritual people and yet they will watch what God will do and signs and something that he will perform and the people sit and say well that's very fine and you'll notice God will do something else now and they will say that's very nice we appreciate that that was a good god well it's your duty God you did it as a duty no real burden they just take it for granted God blessing you you have health and strength you take God for granted did they go flat in the lie down on the hospital bed flat then you recognize oh God what's your ticket for granted that's why you ought to have an attitude of gratitude let me say it again you have to have you should have an attitude of gratitude you don't need to complaint because your face though the B system yet UFA is depressed yet you have gone in the wilderness yet the devil take you all day yet so right now you should have an attitude of gratitude that God will open your eyes to see this end-time message Oh Glory to God to see if you will stay with the word until your time comes Hallelujah you're going to wait till your time come we only waiting you know but one day the tea gonna turn the clock is ticking down you know time is running out all glory to God there's going to be a Revival Hallelujah just when the worst earthquake to strike America's truck the Revival Holy Ghost and Azusa that's true Hallelujah 1906 I believe it was I think it was 1906. hallelujah what a great earthquake and people was blaming God for that it was a great destructive earthquake with many fires but there was another earthquake in the spiritual realm that was littered up a different kind of fire it was Holy Ghost Fire it was a bonfire it was the answer to Revival and I believe tonight there's going to be another earthquake but this time will be the bright Revival it's going to be a holy ghost Revival he said what we see should make a church that would make a Revival that people will fly from everywhere saying the seven thumbnails of Revelation 10. the SE not even written it's being manifested Oh Glory to God so I am under great expectation tonight Oh Glory to God Amen do you believe that but Ibraham says no If there really was a Revival in the air when those things would take place every soul will grasp it quickly there will be no end to it it will just go from one to another from one to another it will keep moving of course you know I'm American like you are but in Africa down here where they're supposed to be hidden land it was kind of would make us feel ashamed of ourselves to see how they receive the Gospel when they see one Supernatural thing perform 30 000 receive Christ that's cool son saved at one time that was 50 000 there's no question it was just over that's all and I will tell you listen to this brother I think our people has relied too much on education and theology and so forth and has let it take the spirit's place so now it's the message loaded with knowledge and information and Revelation and understanding and topics and discussion and fellowship and people they have no feet no atmosphere learning with Theology and the theology it ended up a substitute for the spirit that's supposed to be here present for the spirit that's supposed to be working oh Hallelujah let me drop this to you I believe in Ezekiel the nine chapter that's what we read I'm pretty sure I may be wrong I know I'm quite sure it's Ezekiel 9 chapter when the Holy Spirit went forth first it was a man when fought from behind the gates with slaughtering weapons to destroy so they say these angels was coming to destroy is one among them was that one with the ink on with the right to right side isn't that right and that was of course scripturally applied was before the destruction of Jerusalem and there was a man came forward with a white robe and an incorn by his side and the commission was given to him by God to go through the city now listen to this and set a mark upon the forehead and he call it he say it here I'm reading I'm still reading the ceiling of the Holy Spirit they not understanding and getting a revelation and you know they would come to me we're not talking about that now he's talking about a mark yeah do you have that Mark you're talking about a mark this is not I see you should have this or Pastor say no no this is the scriptures now he says no go through listen set a mark upon the forehead the ceiling of the Holy Spirit a mark upon the forehead of every man or woman that sighed and cried for the Abomination did in the city so that's the quality of spirit that's a quality a attitude sighing and crying for the Abomination now I want to ask you if he was coming to Chicago tonight how many places would he find tonight that in the home they are laying subbing for Revival just in such a travil of soul that they can't stand it any longer they just don't know what to do I wonder how many would he mark in Chicago tonight of this city of almost 5 million people in it what would he mark I imagine you could count them on your fingers hardly don't you think so the people with that type of burden and yet that was exactly he wasn't a mark no one but that type are you that type do you want to become that type do you want God to come and put that burden on you that you want to be signed crying and groaning and travailing according to the scripture we read when Zion travel Zion brought forth if there is no travail nothing coming forward therefore God have to bring on a travel of soul traveling your spirit Beyond where you just have your needs met and and things being met and things working on for you something have to go beyond that that you can grasp the burden of God oh hallelujah praise God you see people individuals inside they have the individual interests and burden and conditions we who in Ministry not fortunate to be in your position amen because we have the burden of the entire church so when you study you and your family we can study our own family we have to study the entire church the burden is different the responsibility is different the weight is different Hallelujah so you can look for all the individual attention Edition was a thousand people how much time we will shake how much people we could go home by and fellowship with it can't work it can't work you have to good up your loins and become a Christian and make yourself a Christian you have to do that you ain't born a Christian you are born hungry and tasting after righteousness you have to be blessed Jesus said blessed are they that are hungering and thirst after righteousness I want God to bless you tonight that when you leave here you have a hungering in your soul that you can't even explain because God after creating that and barabanam said Lord created me a Revival let me hunger let me test God after creates what I created in you if it is knocking you you're only going to church you're a church member just a church member [Music] he wasn't a mark no one but that type yes a people you see what I mean he said we got to get mellowed up before God Hallelujah now Jesus a man went out and another man went out another hour and worked another man went out and worked and one man went out 11 door and when he stopped at 11th hour he gave every one of them the same portion the living Tower they wondered why why did he did everyone working Luther worked on the looted this position the Methodist shouted Diana Wesley died in Grace We're living another age not back there mother used to go on an ox cart we're going to afford V8 and forward almost jet propelled we are living in a different age we are living in a different dispensation we are living in the day here we go of the restoration of the powers of God foreign power of God because that is what the Azusa Street introduced for years is Bible text Hallelujah the Catholic church should take away from the people and when and when they had no Bibles so the priest was interpreting the word to them God had the Germans they invent the printed press because the Bible was about to be restored so when the printing press the Bible went on print and then Wesley spread the print then God invent make science invent the audio tape because barabbana was coming that we could get the death of The Voice Hallelujah God know what you're doing when he won the word printed he got it printed when he won the word spread he got the spread when he wanted unclear because I don't take now he wanted to be seen or going about so that's why we have video that's why we are streaming because God wants he said the holy horse will go across the world overnight overnight this Holy Ghost will go across the world or Hallelujah it will sweep across the world the latter rain will sweep the world go give the Lord some praises glory to God so these four angels these Angels were angels of Destruction that angel to smile for is a good God for every time no not that these Angels Came to destroy destruction angels they come into this truck to hurt the Earth to hurt the sea hallelujah amen Angels committed for Destruction then these four Angels what hold back hold back what but I'm gonna say now watch hold it until what until what all the Four Winds hold back the destruction the Angels come to hold back destruction destruction coming you know but hold it back you know close to your eyes but you hold it back Hallelujah earthquakes holding back Hallelujah this problem holding back until what until the 11th Hour people would come in you know is that that is Gentile workers you see what God see you are this is what the Bible say you are you are the 11th Hour Gentile workers that got everything with waiting for you everything will be held up for you all the destruction Oh Glory to God oh Hallelujah because I steal the Angel is coming no no man angels are still an angel Oh Glory to God and sail again not no man angel I steal an angel coming to fill you the angel from the East remembers hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord the angel from the East oh my my Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah holding the Four Winds and the earth and the wind that should not blow on the Earth or the sea nor on any tree I saw another man eating from the East having the Seal of the Living God oh Hallelujah because Destruction come into the Earth but Obama had a vision he saw it coming it was his seventh Vision where America was blown up we'll get to it we'll praise God so yeah what he says 11 our people will come in the last call of the Gentiles mother worked there Dada worked there grandmother worked back there this is our age the 11th Hour World War stopped on the 11th month in the year in the 11th day of the month the 11th Hour of the day world wars was stopped in the November the 11th at the 11th Hour nobody can explain how it stopped that time but God was showing a sign of the 11th Hour workers Gentile workers coming in it's not right he said in 11 minutes of the hour that 11 hour people might come in to receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that they did back there in the beginning let me say it again because this is not preach Mustang the message but I'm going to preach it hallelujah hallelujah the 11th our workers is to receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that they had at the beginning that's why William Branham was sent to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers they can't get around it preach whatever they want to preach we have to go back to the faith of the fathers and works is fake Express Oh Glory to God wants the faith of the fathers is restored you have to have the expression of the works that the fathers have not taught the fathers had okay the Lord some praises Hallelujah to receive what the same baptism of the Holy Ghost what a sin we explain that Sunday same as same not the explanation of the Holy Ghost not an understanding the Holy Ghost we adapt not that but the same when when God finish with Peter he will staggering when God finished with Mary she was staggering when God finished with James and Andrew and all them brothers in the upper room they were staring like drunk men we want that same one that make you drunk like drunk men or give the Lord a shout on a modern Holy Ghost we want no mental Holy Ghost we want the same Holy Ghost no intellectual Holy Ghost no explaining Holy Ghost [Applause] oh we are [Applause] I am taking that [Applause] Hallelujah I ain't letting a man feed me with that talk same talk hallelujah amen [Applause] amen Hallelujah I want you convinced I want you to be convinced it's the same Holy Ghost I want you to be convinced what Peter had and Paul had is what you have to have I want you to be convinced that you don't want nothing less than that no let nobody explain that away from you nobody and your camera's Mysteries how much Revelations how much understanding there is something called the power of God with power of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen listen to receive the baptism Holy Ghost like back there in the beginning to bring back the power and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus seeing signs same wonders same Miracles what is it the wars are struggling here struggling there struggling here struggling the atomic bombs everything else they're being built up but they can't do it they can't do it until the Jews gets a visitation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not not teaching I Heard a Voice said how much was sealed I heard 140 Waters were sealed from this tribe and that tribe sealed and before they could be sealed there's a gentile right to be sealed with the same Holy Ghost [Applause] not talked go sealed [Applause] they can't do it until the Jews get the position of the bathroom only goes the angel said hold it till we see the servants not the bride the Gentiles never was a servant we are Sons and Daughters of God that servants the Jews are Abraham God servant so you are the 11th Hour workers Hallelujah and God is holding back what the three and a half years tribulation from you because the foolish version is going two and a half year tribulations Oh Glory you wouldn't be escaping the three and a half years tribulation by having the Seal of God that's what the seed come for for you to escape three and a half years tribulation oh that is not a show tonight that's enough thought is it Hallelujah Glory the god that incorn writer is Mercy before judgment Oh Glory to God you believe that oh hallelujah hallelujah so before any tribulations can whatever come God have to seal you first do you believe that Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory the lord so let me just break in here this is an interjection from Azusa and this is all testimony from it and I hear about the Terry talk about the choir singing heavily music and different things listen to this especially the enchanting strange of the so-called Heavenly Choir or him sung under the evident direction of the Holy Spirit both as to words and tune till my whole being is a testimony from my Jesus treat it was not something that could be repeated at will but supernaturally given for each special occasion and was one of the most indisputable evidences of the presence of the power of God perhaps nothing so greatly impressed people as this singing at once inspiring by a holy awe or feeling of indescribable Wonder especially if the hearers were in devote attitude this is what I get to Divine love was wonderfully manifest in the meetings they would not even allow an unkind word said against the opposers or the churches the message was the love of God it was a sort of first love of the early church returned it was a sort of First Love of the early church return the baptism as we receive it in the beginning did not allow us you talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man that's what repeated that that word repeated the baptism of the Holy Ghost did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man the spirit was very sensitive and tender as a dove [Music] are you like that hit the mystery as a real mystery oh Hallelujah not arrogant and proud and Lucy lip and say where you're born and this is me talking this is not that the spirit sensitive as a dove one man said I would rather live six months at that time than 50 years of ordinary life I have stopped more than once within two blocks of the place and prayed for strength before I dare go on the presence of the Lord was so real and he asked him for God for strength to reach the place because the power of God is upon him I mean we don't even know the presence of the Lord was so real scores of people were seen dropping into prostrate position in the streets before they ever reached the mission they would would get up speak in tongues without any influence from Jesus of people God had accomplished his work g.s Lang reports that some who came to investigate were baptized in the Holy Ghost in their Legends scores of personal and eyewitness accounts are tests that many who came to ridicule the meetings were knocked to the floor where they seemed to wrestle with unseen opponents sometimes for hours these are the people who come to ridiculous because they will they will come you know oh yes when he sprayed fall it raised up other spirits and Satan will send every crackpot to see if he could disrupt our genuine Holy Ghost Revival so listen to this these people okay these people generally arose convicted of sin and seeking God one foreign born reporter has been assigned by his people to record the circus-like atmosphere in a comic relief fashion so he called me looking for kicks coming together report he attended a nighttime meeting sitting find it back in the midst of the meeting a young woman began to testify how God had baptized with the Holy Spirit when she suddenly broke into tongues after the meeting the reporters sought her out and asked her where she had learned the language of his native country she answered that she didn't have any idea what she had said and that she spoke only English he then related to her that she had given an entirely accurate account of his sinful life all in the language of his native tongue oh blessed be the name of the Lord so it wasn't a game in those days now it wasn't a play thing and balram said the Holy Ghost will be back in the church and there'll be a nonsense will be a perfect Church go go protect that church it will be a part of our church holy ghost in the church Oh Glory to God people can hide under word word but they can't hide on the spirit or give the Lord a shout come on give the Lord some praises amen and the spirit will expose oh give the Lord a praise offering glory to God let me jump a bomb on you you ready you ready God will do in one year when all the theologians ill to do in 2000 years he said give me a church full of the Holy Ghost full of the Holy Ghost full of the Holy Ghost God will do it one year [Applause] because fire is coming Power is coming Oh Glory to God hallelujah [Music] we're doing one year but all the solutions failed to do in 2000 years in 10 versions he was speechless he said put you be for unbeliever f o for formal and essay for saved now in the safe Church of unbeliever so we're not telling them that formal Church them there is we're not studying them we talk about save church now who in this safe church have have keep in mind in this safe Church there's two classes in this church right here come on in the safe church we talk about Message Church in this message it will just have two classes and save Church which is the type of Christ one of them was a sleeping Vision the other one had oil in their lamp Hallelujah glory to God now when the days of the coming of Titus after Jesus left the Holy Spirit was that man with the incorn at his side Hallelujah the Holy Spirit was that man with the ink on at his side and he went to Jerusalem to set a mark upon people now I want you to notice something church member and you will claimed out the Holy Spirit he said don't seal any of them but then that sigh and cry for the Abominations on the city now where is anybody so burdened about the world now and their condition people so selfish they can't concerned about people in the church for the willingness condition so it's going to hell and there's no testimony from you so it's going to hell and you can even witness how God save you somebody testify to you that is why you are here tonight you can't even testify to anybody and you are Christian no you're a church member you come to church and you go back home a Christian is to be christ-like Christ came to get sinners Christ come to redeem Peter come James come Andrew come amen you don't want to see him I'm not lying to you [Music] the truth the truth is set you free don't seal any other about them where's anybody so burden about the world knowing the condition you say a Methodist I'm Baptist so what difference does that make oh not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul people angry and bitter in their soul they will get them long time the Christianity gone no matter how bad anyone ever treats you anything don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it will grieve the Holy Spirit Away from you it certainly will coming to church with the Holy Spirit going home the word of Holy Spirit going to work with the Holy Spirit what what kind of life is that what he sent us holy spirit you come to church to get the holy spirit that your life could be guided by the Holy Spirit not by your human Spirits you're a human Spirit too you know listen you have a human Spirit you know you have a will of your own just a not my will but your will be done you have a human Spirit but you have the Holy Spirit that if you yield to the Holy Spirit it can't lead you can cherry to his word because the spirit and the word is one let's continue oh my God now to see whether this message we got is connected with it or not the very hour that Israel was signing to be a nation is the very same hour the very same day the very same month I was at Greenville Indiana and the angel appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this he met me down the river and told me that would take place then commission me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was signed a nation it is all connected together the end then he made a statement and let me keep preaching something like that the angel of the Lord is Unwritten now he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord now 1914 the world went to war there have been never had been peace since country swinging swinging swinging in and they're doing the very same thing yet and they was doing what holding he said oh God have mercy holding that great thing that I saw in division the whole team become a destruction holding the atomic holding the words that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until Israel returns back and get herself together and then the message will go to Israel and she'll be sealed with the Seal of the Holy Spirit after the Gentiles is called out the people his name's sake then Israel only receives a three and six three years and six month message Daniel said so there's given a space is given for the Gentiles when it comes to this age he called it the times of the Gentiles not even fixed yesterday called just the times of the Gentiles and when that time of the general is over the door is shut not one more Gentile to be saved and then God go over to the Jews oh my Hallelujah could I read on a little bit then there's three and a half years left for the Jews now if we get older version 11 we'll pick it up at the end of that Elijah and Moses returns again and preacher the Jews two men Anointed with that Spirit or maybe them themselves they never died so they killed them and they lay in the street called Sodom where our Lord was crucified Jerusalem and after three days the life Spirit came into them and they went up and raised up and then about a third of the Earth was blowed to pieces at that time Squad inside of here [Music] you mean this is real you mean this gonna happen he say a third of the Earth was blowed up to pieces at that time now here the Jews that come in to preach through the world cannot will not blow up one another or kill one another or Destruction come until the Jews come down to that place and here sets the Bible he saw for angels and watch what they got to receive they have got to receive the Holy Ghost oh hallelujah praise God Ephesians 4 30 the Holy Spirit sealed until the day of your Redemption and they cannot do nothing until those Jews return oh praise God hallelujah you love him tonight the last season we picked up and find out that the first church how it started off it was started their Pentecost where the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Believers and we saw the reaction of these Believers and how they acted upon them nobody talks about that they explain away the Holy Ghost but they had an action and they did and signs and wonders follow them we find out at the closing Church age about 300 years they sprung up a heresy among them that Doctrine was the induction of the nicolaitan we find out it was Deeds to begin with in the next churches become a Doctrine then they become persecution at the Dark Age then the other side it come Protestant Church Martin Luther watch and he's seeing the spirit of God lead him out instead of letting the people stay free he organized a church and made an image liking unto the Beast be sure in his Spirit realm what God's seen people say that church God seen an image unto the Beast and let's let's go further a political power lighting unto it instead of letting the people walk as God gives light they organize under a discipline that they have to state that discipline what happened in the message what happening churches people are doing Doctrine and teaching and people following Doctrine and teaching Hallelujah and that and and that is supposed to put them in the bride like I'm like I said on Sunday there is no private bride yeah nobody can take a church outside and like that is the brother Jesus Christ and then minister to the brother Jesus Christ that that doesn't exist the bride of Christ is a body by one Spirit you are baptized into that one body nobody can hijack that bride and have that by the corner you can hijack trust members anytime you can have thousands of church members but that bride that's Jesus Christ first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself descending from Heaven would have shout to get that right he sent a message to get that bride Oh Glory to God if God call you by this message oh glory to God you are you are privileged you are privileged because the bride will not be manhandled then bright gonna be flesh of his flesh word of his word Spirit of the spirit Oh Glory to God Amen god listen listen God move right out into the Methodist Church the Methodist at a Revival that struck the world the Holy Spirit was with them teaching sanctification and the first thing you know they organize the church and made an image unto the Beast a political organized power to bind the people that's what that anointing does it binds the people to assist them and not the holy ghost that is what we are fighting Hallelujah systems binding is a power you know it's a mechanism foreigners there is no Miracles there is no power the church is dead under our power different kind of power you see we don't see that's power you don't see that power but it's a power I'm reading to you he said the first thing you know watch God move forward the first thing you know when they did that they organize the church may not imagine to the beast that's right a political organized power to bind the people of God to a Creed instead of being free to worship and walk in light as light was thrown in their path did you realize Christian friends that the Antichrist which is the mark of the beast aha now we come to another Mark put a mark the income right to have a mark and the bees have a Mark it's just two marks it's not 24 marks it's not tattooing all over it's just two marks Mark of God and Mark of the Beast I was saying that it's just true I like that it's simple it's just two marks it's not 24 marks it's a buffet style Max take whatever Mark you want it's just two marks Mark of God mark of the beast Mark of God mark of the beast sealed in or sealed out oh Hallelujah okay the Lord I shout I will say it again either you are ceiling or sealed out there's no in between there is no in between off the Bell on the Earth shall worship the Beast whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Oh Glory to God we are crazy we're not crazy Oh Glory to God we are not crazy this is the message this is the word back to the Bible what the Pentecost back to the Holy Ghost back to Dynamics and we are emphasizing Dynamics we emphasize in the spirit oh my God do you realize Christian friends that the Antichrist which is the mark of the beast the Antichrist everyone knows that the Antichrist there that his Mark is his power a beast is a power there is a power in the Catholic Church I want you to understand what the prophet saying here there is a power in the Methodist Church so it's not like they have no power no it's what kind of power because the causes of millions is a power keeping them people inside the idea whether to our father entry healing Mary yes it's keeping them there you know they're not moving every Sunday morning have them under control Church that is the beast power the Baptist Church is the same yes the Pentecostal Church Jehovah Witness all of them it's peace power you can change a Jehovah Witness unless the name on the book will stay in your witness because that doctrine that bind them the following Jehovah Witness the following Baptists tied ahead ring the bell that is it it's a power Hallelujah but we have to get our power too [Applause] our power has to be the same power that Peter had because there's one Lord It's one faith and it's one baptism or give the Lord a shout one Lord One Faith one baptism it's the Holy Ghost baptism and those guys had it you wouldn't have it because there's only one it's not two is one [Applause] dollar nobody fool you it is Modern Age and we have a kind too [Music] that's the faith of God Abraham had it Oh Glory to God the early church had it only one faith bring back to that fate oh hallelujah praise God praise God am many many men Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God brother Branham and this is where I get whoo get the inspiration from if I could see that way see the Antichrist brother Brown God bless you I love you and if you want to see a real genuine gifts and not impersonation if you want to see real solid Christians walking so salty till the Earth is twisting for them to be like them you can't go down the street and tell what is Christian anymore that's right they all go down the street they all act the same they talk the same all time around cracking all kind of jokes everything like that when God said you'll give account for Every Idle Word that you speak what happened because brother you are letting the devil come in and put it over your eyes the first thing you know prophecy the time will come when God will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out the kingdom of God Glory Hallelujah not join Church people join usually by the thousands he said a message going to come and that message going to either actually see you in or seal you up that's right he said we need the old-fashioned gospel back in the church back to the word of God a lot of this nonsense and foolishness cut off oh my around the country the things that's done here in our country something coming here not long ago you can't even mention Pentecost around our country anymore of a counterfeit come in with thousand times thousands of dollars taken from the poor people to buy airplanes and so forth never was a little airplane boat and all that kind of stuff and get up on the platform bringing ear Flappers hanging down enough jewels on your fingers to send four missionaries across to the Sea and preaching gospel them poor people they're starving to hear the word of God and we call ourselves Christians he said brother there is something wrong we have time for everything else no time for prayer meetings the home is all butchered up the girls and boys are all going around lacking around the country mothers and fathers is unconcerned yet Pentecostal what we need tonight is a home altar in the house a place where God where the Bible is read and the children are taught the word of the Living God oh glory to God hallelujah so the wise virgin going to be in travail Oh Glory to God the wise virgin will be in travail to get the extra oil because the foolish version they all gonna run out oh glory to God they get a temporary blessing he said the Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God Amen what what what what what what they come to do lamb chiman time what is part dip in oil and Pat on fire yeah if but George if they don't have the pattern fire they can't see nothing you know that that lamp like so you have to be the right part of you and oil and the next part on fire that could give light isn't that right but after a while the the Lambda suit up they share the suit up then you would long time when we have lamp here to do you take the lamp and you take the newspaper and clean it out you trim the lamp your clip the weak and then light it over fresh you get nice light good light so long tremend time you have to sick clean the clean the lamp and cut the wick oh God lamb chimney time all that power that shoot up in your life and smoking up your life that you can't give the light you're supposed to give that's how they get clean out that Hallelujah so what I'm talking about is heading up to two great teams coming to the end time the mark of God and the Seal of the Beast is none right on the seed of God any minister no is a baptism of the Holy Ghost remember what the mark of the beast is the mark of the beast is kind of eso reject that Birthright didn't eat so we bitterly trying to restore that bit right again but there was no place of repentance when you reject the Holy Ghost you seal yourself outside of God's mercy now you say brother Branham you if you can tell us our diseases and so forth you are Prophet well I am still the same person that's right I still got the scripture said it's exactly right it's the truth it's hearing people say there'll be a Mark it's already marked just reject the Holy Ghost and you are marked receive the Holy Ghost and you are marked that's right receive it once and see what take place receive it once that's the mark of God and you are sealed to your Eternal destination like the cow out on the road the inspector comes and by no if you didn't get the Holy Ghost last night that went in there check up the night the inspector of the Holy Ghost is here inspecting you over I used to work at the Pennsylvania Railroad we load a car with cans the inspector comes along Shake everything to see if they want any looseness and that's the way God does his church he shake it to see what's the matter with it to see if there's any looseness in you before he pours his Spirit into you and if the church is a little shaky he won't pour His Spirit into it if you still love the world and want to do the things of the world you will never get the Holy Ghost upon that you might get a confusion you might get stammary lips you might get speaking in tongues but you still that don't mean you have got the Holy Ghost where you got the Holy Ghost you are sealed by God to your Eternal destination and when the inspector come and check that don't go good that car he shut the door and put a seal on it and when God sees you are really so Lord for him he fills you with the Holy Ghost you are sealed by the Holy Ghost until your destination oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God so we are waiting for the finishing of the seventh seal to prove who we are Oh Glory to God the bride get caught up at the finishing of the seventh seal and the foolish version will be exposed for the three and a half year tribulation period Oh Glory to God resisting the Holy Ghost and they will not even know it until the television hit them glory to God that's the reason I spoke against the church there's only one Church unless the body of Christ but these lodges that is called churches blasphemy must name why blasphemy it is to be contrary or speak against what God Said and God said come and be born and they say come and join and when the baptism of the spirit is forcing took over for water away from the Catholic church he said and the Protestant Church an emotion in a Pentecostal church instead of the person of Christ coming in with all that building material instead of the person of Christ coming with all that pyramid building we had the other day after your faith virtue and spiritual knowledge Peter said these things [Music] that's the Holy Ghost virtual knowledge and depth that's the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some praises that is what the Pentecostals was short of oh my let's continue quickly the great Angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ taught not rub it in equal with God the full sexed us he brought him from a natural land to a natural land from Egypt to Keenan land the second exercise he brought him out of a spiritual condition into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this third one now he's big enough for my spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost it has to come from the Holy Ghost baptism to the land of the Millennium he said come out a chaos come to the Living God come to the word and the world is made flesh and dwell Among Us o praise God talk about the virgins here Fiverr wise had all in the lamps the other five was pure holy had no oil they were Sanctified without the Holy Ghost there's treated their record on earth water blood spirit so John uh of First John 5 7 they are treated their record in heaven Father Son and Holy Ghost these three are one the street that bear record on earth water

religion Lisa was calling for Jesus take our boat across because Legion Faith was so strong and he had a thousand devils he and a thousand of us he Plus and he went past a thousand devils and his faith was so loud it called Jesus to cross over to the other side [Applause] it forced Jesus to go to the other side to deliver a man named Legion [Music] [Applause] faith is God's currency all that you are all that you ever will be is based upon faith in his word not to any message long time it doesn't have that it's faith in his word you see tonight tonight is to position your feet Amen in the right direction you know what God loves me God want me to have the Holy Ghost God want me to be marked with his Mark God will be deceived foreign [Applause] [Music] yeah last swim time down and when they put that down in his flesh you hear me in the fleshill when that sings you know there's a big set of ruption you know then they let him lose kind of run without Fire Hits here so you can

how to wrap up all the alarms Rapture in feet believe in signs ones and prophecies and everything else these are the five that was taken away the rest of them were still virgins would not be lost but we'll go to the tribulation period okay let's wrap up now recognizing your DNS message recognizing your day on this message the seventh Angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the eleventh hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay the first of our work has got it here open the scenes to say we know more than them we have seals we have Mysteries open the purpose of opening the seals is to call the 11 hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay csmp same bear is the same Holy Ghost this Holy Ghost is just as real that's why they fell under their Pentacles Oh Glory to God same Holy Ghost how many wanted tonight glory to God hallelujah so Jesus taught it somewhere in Harvest and they received the same pay I'll skip them he said no watch it's so perfectly or the first hour Messengers with the word with the gospel with the truth that came out of the Pentecost and there was a dark age that blocked them out then the middle of the day Luther Wesley came in and then there is to be here we go an evening time message to receive the same thing that is at the beginning and then he said the even time message is to restore back again to bring back that same thing he said we say you communism 19 2019 the bride United themselves God uniting why never before since the early church was the pillar of fire among the people never before since the early church did they see the things we are seeing today and this lesson was only made possible when God sent Seven Seals and give us a Sign by it he sent seven angels down from heaven come to bring back that scattered word in damn denominations and tied back into the word of God again to bring down his holy spirit so all this word unfolding word revealing and words showing and we're tying together the object of the tiny word together to see this big picture is to bring down very long shout it out Bring Down the Holy Ghost so the object is to bring it on oh give it a God as many as received him to them there's the power to become the sons of God it will take the Holy Ghost to form You Into the Wilderness Oh Glory to God no teaching doing that oh my God [Music] so you have a serpent in your heart and it's upon your baptized that the person discipline still there you shake his hand welcome to the church he's supposedly because you're born with that serpent another [Applause] come and drop inside your heart change your nature If any man be in Christ he's a new creator all things are passed away Oh Glory to God change your nature change the desires Oh Glory to God change you all together something happened with him that makes you a Christian you say that is a reform intellectual yes they reformed Hallelujah you're on your way to be converted but I'm says until he receive the Holy Ghost you're on your way because your daughter you receive it it's a promise and we have to preach it because the promise it's a promise of God if you don't preach it you can get it you have to know it's a promise but run say you have to know it's given for you no glory to God you have to know what it is and you have to know it has given for you and we are here to say it's given for you my mind so seven angels come to God in this scattered word to bring the vision of what we're supposed to receive Jesus did the same thing when he rose from the dead he appears to disciples under the Lord open their understanding and open their word that they might know what they could receive just try to tell them nothing again he said tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you endude with more Revelations no that's what you give them until you endure with your interpretation no until even during my Mysteries somewhere from where from where from on high it's an old man of the unhigh brother it's God on high oh give the Lord a shout is there no man coming on from on high it's only God to come on so Jesus let them know where the power coming from [Applause] I ain't no crazy preacher this is the same old time holy spirit that the devil won't go near it that the people that people are sharing but it's good enough for me we need this old-fashioned Glory we need it I'm gonna close right here oh my my mind oh National Force but the churches in the world comes the churches he said but the power of God will put the people in The Bride no man could do that no teacher no Apostle no Prophet no Passover put you in the bride if you take the power of God let us raise our hands musician God please let's begin to worship alone right now they are in an upper chamber they were all in one Accord when the Holy Ghost descending that was just now oh send apart just now baptized everyone [Music] thank you Jesus thank you Lord give him a shout of praise tonight [Music] [Music] everyone go send a power just

the power just now power just now oh Lord send the power just not I'm popped up one more time Hallelujah [Music] yes Lord Jesus [Music] one more time [Music]
