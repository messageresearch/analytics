like to turn to Isaiah 55 you want to read 8-11 Revelation 10 8-11 and Revelation 19 7-10 thank you for coming out tonight and we're looking to see what the Lord will do and Isaiah chapter 55 reading verse 8 it reads my thoughts for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are high than the earth so are my ways High than your ways and my torch than your torch and as the rain cometh down and snow from heaven and return it not thither but water it the Earth and maketh it bring forth and but that he may give seed to the soore and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish the purpose it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it Revelation chap 10 reading from verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven speaking unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongs and Kings final scripture is from Revelation chapter 19 reading from verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should beid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marage supp of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true saints of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and I and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy may God bless his word you may be seated praise God tonight I have a title the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy note the angel which was Malachi 4 here that's showing John typed the bride all these things and when John tried to worship the prophet said no no no no see thou do it not I am of thy fellow servant and of Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy amen blessed be the name of the Lord so we re see what the Lord will do tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord now we find out that he said here now that God promised he said be careful God has promised Malachi for for this last day and he said at that time Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled for it is the gerti word of God spoken by Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time listen close all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be before that time here we go are you ready the Bible is to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger Ares of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible Plumb from the serpent to the messenger in the form of rain I want you to get that he going to plant what the seed of the entire Bible so the message of the hour that come to us is the seed of the entire Bible and if God put that seed then that seed have to come to life oh praise the name of the Lord isn't that right all right so what he said now he will be rejected by theal people as his forefathers John and Elijah as was spoken by the Lord all right let's go now the first thing we want to draw your attention to is the infallibility of God's word God keeps his word to the letter and tonight we want to fasten our thoughts on that that God keeps his word we can rest assure of anything that God has said in his word to be the truth and Faith does not rest upon the shifting sounds of man ideas or man's theology but it has its final rest in place on the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal Word if God said it that is forever the truth he can never take it back and say I did not mean it I can say things and you can say things and we are PR to have to take it back because we said it with the best of our knowledge with the best of our ability but then God is so much different from us he is infinite therefore he does not say one thing unless it is absolutely perfect he never has to take it back he never has to apologize for what he has said it always stand as the truth even for Jesus in this great day when God really slay his son for sins of the world was perhaps thousands of years before even the foundation was ever laid God spoke the word and it's a finished product in heaven when God speaks it it's already finished that's the part I want to get tonight when God speaks it it's finished so in God's world speaking it it's good as if it's done it have no future it have no no past it is never present so when he speaks it it's good as done in other words it's finished once it come out of his mouth so he can say my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose and the design what I set it up to do is going to bring it to pass Oh Glory to God so shall my word be oh Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises tonight he said your thoughts are not my thoughts Hallelujah your ways are not my ways he already said that so you don't have the thoughts of God we have to catch the thoughts of God oh praise God Amen Hallelujah I love that tonight all right so watch what so watch so even God spoke the word it's a finished product in heaven when God speaks it it's already finished oh if we could only grasp what that means what different people we would be to see in his books the judgments that is placed in here for the disobedient it would make a man examine himself hour by hour it would make the righteous Rejoice hour by hour to read the blessings that God has promised to the faithful and we can rest assured that every word will be fulfilled just anchor our soul on it it always been that way the prophet only looking off and seeing something he is talking about what he's looking at he ain't thinking about here what you look like now he is looking what it's going to be and when he speaks that if it is in the word of God is already been spoke and there is nothing in the world can stop it you see that's right only God himself he speaks his vision the prophet does now sometimes he speak good things he speaks of your healing all right you might think it just can't happen I I haven't got any better then what does that do that just brings the judgments of God upon you that's right see Jesus Pro promise to save you if you believe it if you don't believe it it won't happen to you you've got to accept it you've got to believe it see you got to know where it's coming from and that gives your faith in God or your Prophet you got to believe it now we find out here that when these prophets spoke they spoke and what they said come to pass if the wrath of God is pour upon the people there's only one thing if that Prophet said something another going to happen there's only one thing that will stay the hand of God that is repentance that's the only thing the only thing that will stay in the hands of God repentance that is repentance towards God that stays his WRA now don't wait for it do it then God says anything do it right then see praise God do you believe that tonight do you understand that word he speaks must come to pass right no brother Bram on the seven seed he was talking about uh notice now for the End of Time message talk about the seven SE now for the End of Time message this seal he reveal all the six seals he don't say nothing about the seven but the end time seal when it starts will be an absolute total secret to the Bible he didn't say finish in a secret it going to start as a secret what seal the seven seal what seal is that the end time seal so we can't talk about end time until we can get into that seal because that seal is the end time seal and under the seven seal of seven Thunders 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 banging under there seven voices right on the side of there oh glory to God and those voices will be a bride in the last days to make her the final voice of the final age nothing can change this oh praise the name of the Lord because God said it God spoke it it's got to come to pass because God will give the brighter voice oh give the Lord a shout and God's voice was spaced out through Seven Ages oh give the Lord a shout in the house his voice was spaced out through seven ages to be gathered in the last days as the voice of God Seven voices seven Church ages seven Messengers seven men seven spirits oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah gathered up together one voice voice of God in the last days in a bride so let's go now watch the end time seal when it starts will be an absolute total secret to the Bible now remember Revelation 10 1 to7 at the end of The Seven Angels message all the mysteries of God would be known he identified the scriptures Revelation 10 1-7 all the Mysteries would be known we are the end time the opening of The Seven seal Oh Glory to God so in other words we can't talk end time without talking about that seventh seal and that seventh seal all the Mysteries written has been revealed Revelation 10 1-7 but tonight we read Revelation 10 8 to 11 and that specifically speaks about the bride because John represented the bride oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the Earth so this is not going to jville now this is not going to Bram Tabernacle now this is not going to some man in America or England or Europe or Africa or west indes or Caribbean this is going to the angel the one with the sweat back Wings the one with the seven seal the one with little book open it is going to that angel could somebody give a shout in the house this is not a man from America this is going to the angel that came down from heaven the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout is that right oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah okay we see where we go tonight okay all right now the seventh Angel's message is is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th Hour Gentile workers to receive the same pay that the first hours got now this is loaded here this have the seventh messenger this have he's opening the seals and what it is for for us to get something not for to talk to it for 50 years and say we the message not for you no no no say we listen to books and tapes for you it's get the same pay because Peter and them got paid Hallelujah and we have to get paid also because it has a pay involv in this thing same Penny isn't that right Jesus taught it he saw what people went into the Harvest they were hired early morning they receive a penny for a day noon time some coming went to work 11th hour that's the last hour of the day someone coming and receive the same kind of payer Lyon last hour final hour Oh Glory to God there'll be one more ride Oh Glory to there'll be one more ride that's a prophecy you know there'll be one more ride I'll ride this Trail once more who speaking the Holy Ghost you're going to ride this Trail once more he has some family members to pick up he has some electri to pick up he has some seeds and bars right now some seeds wearing hot pants and mini skirt some PE drunk right now they don't even know they are seeds but they're coming there'll be one more right could we give the Lord some Praises there'll be an adopted prde to go after Fallen Sons they are boxing people for years in this message they're coming out they're coming back oh glory to God there will be a Revival I will restore said God Almighty Hallelujah glory to God amen amen all right let's go this part I want to get to now now God full of Mercy made a way to redeem woman that woman and he promised her that sometime in the future the true word would come to her again the true word will be made known to her remember because he promised Christ through the woman and Christ is the word s John 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwell among us he was the word here we go before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created so God thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word that is when he presented to you as a thought his thoughts is revealed to you then it is still a thought until you speak it sir so let's see if we could break down down tonight before a word is a thought before you express it in word form verbal it's a thinking thing and he say a thought has to be created so God thoughts become creation when it is spoke by a word so let's go back to Genesis in the beginning God said let there be light the thought a creation of God the expression by his mouth the word and there was light oh give the Lord some Praises so God's Channel and ability for fulfillment has been to the channel of thought word expression oh give the Lord a shout in the house and God is not changing from that so for this thing to happen according to Revelation 10 Hallelujah the bride must prophesy again oh give the Lord a shout glory to God there must be a fresh Prophecy of the prophecy okay the Lord you got to speak it if it's revealed to you you got to express it there is going to be Revival in Trinidad Oh Glory to God we speak it a seven ton Revival it have a name he said let there be light have a name he called the light day the darkness he call night it have a name for this revival there not just any Revival this is a 7 T exclusive Pride Revival oh give the Lord some Praises this is not for church members Oh Glory to God this for bride members his wife had made herself ready oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory so listen hallu if you're not studying the word if you're not reading the word if try to get into the spirit of the word how you catch the thoughts created to speak the word amen even prophesy your own deliverance and your own breakthrough and your own Victory and over your own family how you going to do that because you have to have faith like God to do that you know he said my word shall not return me void he don't have to look for a manifestation he just get his word out out yeah he just have to get it out of his mouth hey glory to God did you get that tonight he not worried it just have to come from thought to word and out his mouth and he could just walk away oh give the Lord some Praises knowing his word can't be turned void knowing it can't come back empty knowing it's got to be fulfilled hey glory to God his word is a prophecy Oh Glory to God and tonight I am claiming I am believing we have the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy that has been anointing us all these years Oh Glory to God we have been working with the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy and one of these days we will say like Peter this day this scripture Oh Glory to God this is the stone that you build refus oh this is that that the prophet Joel spake of oh praise God praise God oh glory to God glory to God glory hallelujah hallelujah let's go one more time before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created so God taught become creation when it's spoke by a word so that's why we have the word expressed and becomes a word seed before it's a real seed because when God speak the word let there be light that was a seed that that word itself was a seed it could take a millon years for light to come that's the real manifestation of the word seed but it's a word seed so when he come back and we hit it now the secret is the word is in the bride God have no worries God are getting a fight God are getting a battle in his mind how you going to make it he know the secret is the word is in the bride we already identify for you that this Prophet will SW the seed of the entire Bible so when he said the word is in the bride that Bible is not just the physical Bible it's our next Bible too it's our Prim Bible that consists of faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance so you have the whole Bible in you in seed form for Give the Lord a shout I don't know what you doing inside here tonight praise God you have the entire Bible that the prophet brought Oh Glory to God that seed is what has to come inside of you not a man taught you know not of man ideas you know because if you take the book and eat the book you can only prophesy from the book oh give the Lord some Praises oh Hallelujah I wonder if you see that tonight John can go and prophesy his own thing is the book he eat Hallelujah the book is what God digests inside of him he can only speak from the book from the open book Oh Glory to God that's why you say what the tape say you got add to it you can't take away from it oh my watch Hallelujah he was continuing he said his thoughts if it's revealed to you is still a thought you get a revelation it's a revelation reveal to you you get excited and what not but still a thought until you speak it why AB see having a son you know you you can have faith and don't speak it faith is spoken hallelujah praise God your wall this wall coming down Jesus curs the viory and look back you know disciples say from the root and then he say if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you son you could have what you say Jesus never look back know he C this walk he never look back see if it ding what if it really Dy no he curs it and you know that is finished amen amen and the same thing for cancer tumor Lema blindness finish that's how the bright will be a super church and a super because the level of faith will be finished he say when you have to lay hands you'll be commanded when that time comes hey when that time comes you'll command it Oh Glory to God you talk about the super anointing you talk about super Church you talk about super race do you understand where we going tonight it will be God thoughts dropping down upon your heart when you speak is not your thoughts Oh Glory to God when you speak is God's Own word hey amen hallelujah do you see it tonight all right hear this he said now that's the reason Moses went out to pray that Pillar of Fire around him he said go hold your stick towards the east and say call for fly Moses that to call for fly if he call for fly but have fight coming there's no flies I'm reading but he went held the stick there and said let there be flies no flies at all yet went on back but the word God's thought has already been spoken it's a word now it's got to happen now don't you see where Jesus said if you say to this mountain not if I say but if you say to the mountain be moved and the first thing I guess in Moses time a big old green fly begin to buzz and afterwards there was 5 pounds per yard from one fly to five pounds every yard is 5 pounds of fly where did they come from God created them don't you see oh my Hallelujah so we can't get our own thoughts doing CXC and GC then God thoughts we can't get God thoughts doing GC and C exceeded you could study algebra and biology and what they not go thoughts subjects you I'm saying then God toses from his word so you have to be in the word to catch God thoughts Jesus said it this way the Holy Ghost will bring back things to your remembrance what I spoke to you you are human oh give the Lord some Praises you can't catch everything in one shot god account for your stage of growth in your Christian walk to give you dispense to you Revelation so as you grow you get more as he mature you get more he want to come from child to young man to Father praise God to know him from the beginning Oh Glory to God I call you young man because you're strong and overcome him praise God I call you fathers because you know him from the beginning there's a higher Revelation the father's get into a god Consciousness he talking about coming into full realization perfect realization to know where you come from who you are where you're going praise God oh glory to God a higher level to know just only not only what God has done but why he did it oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God all of that is levels we're talking about now praise God God pulling up his sons higher and higher praise God glory to God glory to God hallelujah so when God speaks his his word and when you catch it is his thoughts coming to you then it becomes your thought because he reveal it to you and then when you speak it it's your word oh give the Lord some Praises we got to speak it glory to God go we have to say seven Thunders we have to say adoption we have to say perfection we have to say Revival we have to say prde Amen pray Pride material that is the message what we have to preach we have certain terminology we have to use mes Let It Be C let be flies but God tell them to speak and speak it refilling the he said he said the the the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost I can't say otherwise the the Dynamics is not some man come from America to tell about books and tips the Dynamics foret Dynamics not talking about brother brand you know go and a prophet we know that that's why we believe the message we're not fools elas has already come is the is the prophet prophecy we dealing with now oh give the Lord some Praises praise God I a't come to be taught about God in a prophet and what happened 1933 that's not what I'm here for we done pass that already we 50 plus years pass that we don't want to hear about 1933 and 19 and this and 19 and 1947 no no no don't go there yet tell us what he prophesied tell us what that great Elijah brought to us as an entire message tell us what we must expect tell us what we must press forward to Oh Glory tell me about the kingdom in preach and everyone press into it so if the word spoken for your condition whether healing physical whether spiritual whether my financial material whatever it is it's finished amen because it spoke remember a woman I think I believe she wanted have a baby or something so and and Bam spoke and the Lord spoke through him about you're going to have you're going to be healed or have a baby or something like that and she said she got among some doters and some friends and what he said who spoke and he said if God said it it doesn't matter who you get among it going come to pass because when when D say the Lord come is th say the Lord you you not nobody stopping that you know oh praise the name of the Lord all right let's go wait the prophet now he said this angel of Light to the Lan Church age that rejected Christ and his word right and he stood at the door knocking trying to get in the church age had rejected the Christ and Christ is the word had rejected it he was in the outside the only church age we have Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in now watch here we say now this is where you really need a man of God to put the word together to see the picture because B Bram put a prophetic Vision on that give us the panoramic it's like is like a puzzle if you have puzzle pieces and you never see the picture of the puzzle box how you making that now you can build it you know but boy that will take some time because you don't have a vision of what the pieces is about so the prophetic Vision gives you a panoramic yes sir of the cover of the puzzle box so there's a house here a cow here a coat here a door here whatever it is here then you have the pieces here now so as you start of fitting pieces you look at the box and you're fitting here you know this one this color is supposed to go here this supposed to go here and this is the beauty of this prophetic Vision you know where the pieces are fitting so when somebody preaching something out of timing you know it out of Tim because not supposed to be there the C what you doing on top the thing now the part may fit you know but the picture is not correct your fit people fitting things you know fitting belong there but they fit in it to connecting I said boys some connecting the water electrical line look trouble you know how how you pull that wire down there they fitting things but not according to the prophetic Vision that was released by seven sees and seven Thunders they not fit in it according to that Vision Hallelujah right division that's what God said that's what brother bam did and a five4 Ministry were supposed to come and make it plain not make it complicated Hallelujah and I have more relation than you make it plain that you who read it could run run with it give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah not you who read it get stunned no you may read it may run stand and run is two different thing some people say stand they can't move they get baptized in the brains with head knowledge all right so here we go watch brother BR the only church age that we have Christ on the outside knocking trying to get in and this Angel's message messeng that come from God was echoing his message on the earth to come out of Babylon come out of organizations this is what he said here now the Holy Spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word word it can't vindicate dogmas there's no life in them so the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel go to the angel which angel angel in Trinidad angel in some church he P up in some church he pick he renting a room in a church somebody said this chch of the angel that you the angel that you the angel which Angel you talking about the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel hallu trying to get the people back to what the word not their thoughts not their interpret not their dreams not their ideas the word because you can only vindicate what the word God will vindicate his word oh glory to God hallelujah praise God because only the word have life it can't vindicate a Dogma there's no life in them and the church has built so many systems around the world until he shook them a rocker when he come so God has sent prophets to shake people off of the systems she had bird pains what was it back to the word word back to the life systems doesn't have a life it is only God's word that has life do you believe that it and and what the systems is built around it where does not and it does not have life it is the word that gives life so people come in this message and build systems around your message so the talking message talk but there's a system around it but only the word of life oh praise God hallelujah it is the word that gives you life all right Revelation 181 to4 says after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is Fallen is become the habitation of devils the hole of every fou Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird and All Nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of a fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax rich through the abundance of her Delicacies verse four and I heard a another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our sins that you receive not our plagues now listen to how the prophet interpret that verse four now this Angel is the last messenger before the coming of Christ in the 19th Chapter of Revelation so this is Revelation chapter 18 the messenger voice if you notice when he gave his voice on the earth there was a voice echoed again in heaven fourth verse if you want to read it all right the fourth verse 199th chapter this Messenger on the Earth was so inclined with God until when he spoke it on Earth God echoed the same thing out of Heaven oh Hallelujah so when the prophet spoke on Earth Echo from Heaven that mean you could hear from heaven and you would hear the same voice that was spoken Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house now catch this here you are hearing the word you hearing what has been taught what has been shared what's been spoken what has been played what been echoed but the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the revelation of Jesus Christ so hearing it is not the revelation of it the Holy Ghost have to take what you're hearing and reveal it to you then that become yours oh give the Lord some pray I want you to see it tonight when it's revealed to you it's absolutely yours the Devil Himself got take it out of you oh because God has revealed it un you okay we could go back in the word who do men say I the son of man am they say something you this that the other then Peter said th about the Christ he said Flesh and Blood ha not revealed this unto you he saying you heard from heaven and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the case of hell can Prevail against it so right away Peter knew he had a rock inside of there he had a key inside of there he had a foundation inside of here because faith is the foundation of the Christian experience and that rock Revelation is faith upon that rock you going pervert you and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness but it have to have a rock inside there oh give the Lord a shout in the house Glory Hallelujah do you see it now watch God echoed the S of Heaven what is the fourth ver translation what does it mean God's voice speaking to his predestinated people seeing come out of her just exactly what the voice was he's got people out there all through Babylon what is Babylon confusion so God's voice will come down in Trinidad and say come out of confusion come out of Babylon not talking about Roman thing you know that is outside we talking about inside a lot of confusion people confused come out get out you have to get it clean and clear you have to get clarity of vision and purpose to accomplish your mission because when God put somebody on Earth he G them a mission to accomplish and the vision of the mission had to be clean and clear Oh Glory to God take down the Philistines take down the Grove take down the altars Oh Glory to God take down Jero it had to be clean and clear you got be confused when you start to fight here oh God am I supposed to go here what I'm doing here what I'm doing here you're confused the vision has to be made plain oh praise God praise God hallelujah praise God let's continue Joel 2:28 says it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy yes your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions so there's a direct scripture according to Joel that the spirit of Prophecy going to be here in the last days by your por of his Spirit now here the prophet now now the Bible said your sons and daughters shall prophesy now what does the word prophesy mean look it up it is to tell something under inspiration or forell something it's a compound word just just like sanctify means to be clean and set aside for service Joel said I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy now the word prophesy does not mean to teach so thou must prophesy again to many nations doesn't mean we going with a Teaching Ministry around the world to teach the prophecy is something different he specifically said the word prophesy does not mean teach the word prophesy means to tell an experience under inspiration to forell something that is fixing to take place oh give the Lord some Praises so this bride must prophesy again it's not this bride must teach again oh give the Lord some Praises I feel excited tonight I feel inspired tonight I feel it's getting clear tonight is not the bride going around the world teaching teaching teaching explaining interpretating no no no no I know other word interpretating just sound good just sound good interpretating so the bride not going wrong interpreting stuff the bride has to be a genuine echo of what the prophet said and my contention is this if a man truly eat the book from the angel he can only prophesy from the book Oh Glory to God because the book is the entire word oh Hallelujah let me say it again so watch now the word prophecy does not mean to teach the prophecy means to either tell an experience under inspiration as I say that I remember when the brotherly kindness and the anointing fell in 1981 some prophetic utterance was spoken and I remember the Lord saying the holy spirit is wanting to seal the whole thing that wasn't for kwell church you know that was for the bride body you know the holy spirit is trying to see the whole thing remember brother Kangle but where is the brotherly kindness he said and was just speaking the holy spirit is wanting to seal the whole thing but where is the brotherly kindness where is the spirit of forgiveness and at that time we didn't even have pyramid I don't think we had a pyramid in in the church in the building there we didn't even have that and right on top have the Holy Spirit my Lord hallelujah the Holy Spirit want to see the where's the brotherly kindness only a confusion and sword fighting and bitterness and anger and and no fellowship and and all kind of ducks they building instead of building the house of God they're building walls and every year they adding bricks and adding The Grudge and renewing the grud like renewing LIC they renewing The Grudge and renewing the ocean they continue the fight and they pass into the congregation the congregation have attitude to so do fight that's why I never want to be in that foolishness never Hallelujah M of nonsense going on I just say nothing El keep my mouth sealed cuz I don't want nobody try to fight you see what happened to America soon as the Trump start to talk thing everybody acting up all kind of thing because he he anointing them he just saying to key words you know he had to speak it first you know and then fell just feel led to do it see there anointing a cult anointing that same thing will come back in the church now oh praise so don't much prophesy again is not to teach again is not to explain again is not to interpret again all right so Revelation 10 we want to look at it again from the Amplified side verse 8 says and the voice that I heard from Heaven speak to me again saying go take a little book scroll which is open the hand of the Angel who is standing on the sea and on the land so I went and to the angel and asked him to give me a little book he said to me take it eat it up it will embitter your stomach D in your mouth it will be sweet as honey all right so I took the little book from the Angel's hand and ate and swallowed it it was sweet as honey in my mouth but once I had swallowed it my stomach was EMB bitten then he said to me you are to make a fresh prophecy concerning many peoples and race R es and Nations and language and Kings is a fresh prophecy how could we make a fresh prophecy without having the testimony of Jesus the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy you cannot make the fresh prophecy without the spirit of Prophecy Hallelujah the spirit of Prophecy comes from the testimony of Jesus oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so therefore this seven seal seven T the message have to turn into the spirit of Prophecy for this world to be fulfilled because God can't lie if God said the prip must prophesy again that mean the spirit of Prophecy have to come upon the bride I have a word for you tonight and the spirit and the bride say Come Oh Glory to God in other words the bride by word revelation 19 go have the anointing of that prophecy Spirit the spirit itself oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so the Dynamics Holy Ghost have to mount a bride to anoint her with the spirit of Prophecy even on the journey oh give the Lord some Praises do you believe that that Spirit of Prophecy would to speak by direct inspiration same as Peter did on the day of Pentecost these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that who told Peter to say that he was anointed he was inspired he could go back into Jewel and identify this what you're seeing here now is that that the prophet and we will see what prophet Malachi for spake of Oh Glory to God if this is not that we keeping this because that is coming oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Peter Peter is the one who said this is a stone that you buers refuse yes sir H this is a stone that become headstone of the corner and John types the bride is not right so the prophet came an anointed messenger planted the seed of the entire Bible oh praise God so many home stretch here oh praise God all right so here recognizing his message famot like Israel back in the promised land she don't know how she got back there she was automatically put back there why National Force put in a place National Force yes Hitler Stalin ikan melini all of them you said the gentle gentle hand of Jehovah guiding his people back to the promised land 6 million Jews died you they paid daily you know God told them for their sin and Disobedience they will get boils they will be scattered and I hope I could get into it I think it's Deuteronomy chapter 28 and read some of it what the judgments look like to his own people and the fact remain is he cut them off that we could be grafted in yes sir so we can't walk with our attitude and our pride and our arrogance no they were blinded that we could see oh give the Lord some praise so we have to get a a humbler attitude he was blinded that he could get a gentile bride and now the spirit have to lead the Gentile church and go over to the Jews close off the Gentile dispensation we're not going to be here forever not be warming Church bench and talking about God and a prophet praise God we have to come to the Fulfillment of the Prophet prophecy oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that's why I ask a question Sunday will the bride have a voice will we be stuck up to Revelation 10 1-7 or will we graduate into Revelation 10 8 to11 oh give the Lord some praises to have the testimony of Jesus which is the pro Spirit of Prophecy to prophesy against the nation tongues people everywhere hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all right watch National Force put Israel in a Homeland National Force will put the church in the work of churches but the power of God God will put the people in The Bride so when our pastor stand up and tell his chur this is the bride here and we the bride you see nobody else have like us and what he's a liar he's a false prophet he put in a false tribulation anointed upon the people to believe he's the man of the hour that is nonsense that is foolishness I don't care what part of the world have that nonsense because this is the word here this can't lie he said National Force put the Israel back in their Homeland and the power of God will put the people right no man have that controll of power no man controlling that power power Daniel said I saw a stone cut out without the hands of man that Stone is coming that Dynamic is coming that rain is coming that power is coming that anointing is coming oh give me a church full of the Holy Ghost he said God will do in one year what all the theologians fail to do in 2,000 years you wait till that door is shut you wait till the anointing strike Oh Glory to God the anointing is going to strike then him be filthy filthy still holy still righteous still the anointed upon the Earth it can't St too long the Earth can handle it oh give the Lord some praises and the bride will be taken away with the anointing Oh Glory to God no more Spirit atmosphere upon the Gentile Pride Church The Only anointing going be upon Moses and Elijah to call 144,000 Jews and not them secular worldly crazy Jews across they have there now not that he specifically The Tribe of Benjamin the tribe of just all the tribes 144,000 stand with Israel which Israel talking about one party in there and Hamas

to pull it together caught snapping sleeping don't be caught that way you know is not that we don't know what's coming you know we know a press is coming we know a squeeze is coming but I'm saying to

material on earth now to make themselves ready notice it said she has made herself ready she said so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you you have got something to do so you have to make yourself ready you have to want to change you have to want a new walk and new talk and new life you are to

end and say blessed he that overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just P you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself myself I have to make a decision for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God the weather was terrible today the cloud was dark I had a decision to make either a close off the service and call off the service and have service tonight but I purpos to have service tonight I a prepared this to speak to the air this is thoughts that come down to me that I feel I have to share and there got to be a bunch of people here without you a audience I can't preach this if I come there's nobody dear oh we going to preach this thing that there got to be somebody here to receive what God give me here go give the Lord some Praises so God set you up to be here that we can have a service tonight I a study the weather the weather have to take care of himself but I have to take care of the Bride Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises all right Abraham had promised a child he he had was promised a child but he must maintain This Promise for 25 years the ups and downs that he had so Abraham life was a life of Prophecy he com in he com in all man sit down doctors come say Fed Up don't come back I check you ready you cannot get any son a check say already your wom dead long time stop it stop it old man he's still coming for checkup because Abram trying is you know hoping something small sign encouragement and thing you know what I mean praise God praise God like the day after the weather gone bad see a big beautiful rainb in the East I said I'm Wai think about that I said I know some people see that they say that a sign said but I nothing that that just a rainbow for me said beautiful looking rainbow but some people take it as a sign you know but I nothing that I don't have the ability to inter those things all right so Abraham now he going to the doctor get fed up him but his life was a prophecy 25 years I guess he might get depressed down the low and struggling up and down he's a human struggling and one day about 12:00 noon three men come walking and my Lord oh Hal Elohim oh God come walking and say I will return to thee according to the time of life and then the prophet prophesy he said you are beholding that se long enough the real rain is fixing to fall we prophesied about a long time about a latter rain coming with the former rain we prophesy that but it's going to fall Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen Let Me skip down quickly praise God let me wrap up here now you talk about the bride right he said as they near The Headstone there'll be so much like him there'll be a super Church super race as they near The Headstone they'll be much like him they'll be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be one there will be the very manifestation of living God denomination can never produce this watch the first son spoken seed son give him a bride to produce himself and the bride was given to produce himself again another Son of God but he fell right hyban did that now let's close it to us now from a little group of the true SE of the word not everybody will read the the message and you have to understand why Paul said all Israel is not Israel and but brah said he said that to show that not all the people that believe is in the bride because the message called three kinds including the foolish virgin and the wise but the wise make it into bride okay now watch it is bad now from the little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ Our beloved bride a virgin to his word of course the word of promis was like Mary I skip down now they would love him and they will have his potentials and for he's their head right notice what Harmony I skip down nothing can harmmer not even debt if there see is planted the water will raise up again now I have got a big Hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bride that's one part that's one part and the next part is and the mind of Christ which is the thoughts of God oh glory to God the word is in and then the thoughts of God coming down now which is the intelligence Hallelujah that's if only faculty pass the eyes the only thing could go beyond the prophet is the intelligence because the prophet brought the vision the entire Vision but the bride connect with with intelligence to know what he wants done who he Christ what he wants done with the word oh give the Lord I feel I feel the fire in the camp tonight hallelujah praise God the intelligence dropping down upon you glory to God giving you instructions what he wants done with the word Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has the say the Lord not the church she has oh give the Lord a shout that means her Can't Fail that means she is the final voice that means she will pack the voice of God in the last days oh give the Lord a shout God pack it in a prophet God going to pack it in a bride and no man could stop it I feel good tonight oh give the Lord some Praises oh I feel the angels flying back and forth in here tonight hallelujah praise God let's he as thus sayth the Lord it is gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's grown and serve its purpose they only do his will no one can persuade them different they have dust say the Lord or they keep still or they shut the mouth Hallelujah but when they open the mouth I will open thy mouth woo and put words in it oh give the Lord a shout prophesy to the Nations hallelujah praise God oh my let be seated remember Moses born for work here we go had to wait on God for the extra gift for the job he was born for it but he had to wait for something extra to fulfill it so he had to go back and wait for the time appointed by God a certain Pharaoh had to be on the throne so Moses can't move out of timing and the bride can't move out of timing glory to God we can't shut ourselves down they have to shut us down oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah God never play Signs ahead of his word that's a scure God never play Signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first pick me a cake first the true prophet of God will proclaim the word in the last days denomination will hit him but he will not pull any punches remember friends now watch Jesus said in the last days it will be in L's time his preaching will be like the spirit straight line of God's word because so much has been called God's truth many will misunderstand this true Messenger I wrote here prophecy because so much has been called God's truth by fakers many true ministers will misunderstand that messenger now remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words written must be fulfilled praise God praise God praise God and let's wrap up here right now when the spirit Falls and there Comes A Move among the people them denomination Will Spring together as certain I'm standing in the pulpit and the Church of God will be outad and they'll make such a racket until they'll Confederate it put a boycot on anybody who do belong to them Rome will rule the world for one hour she will rule for a little peace not communism romanism will rule the world with the cooperation of protestantism in the nominal form of church which God has rejected oh my Hallelujah I'm closing I think after this revival swept the world in his last years I think the saints of God ought to be in the heavenlies everywhere and the power of God going into hospitals and everywhere else and great signs and wonders and miracles taking place but he can't get the people to stand still long enough if we saw theal seeds we will reap the Nal Harvest that's what we have done if you notice that word in Hebrew former and latter rain former means sewing rain and when the spirit Falls that if when the spirit Falls it falls on the just and the unjust so every seed's baiting for rain just and unjust Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said watch the Baptist took a million more and whatnot he said what have we done this is the closing he said we have added members got better churches bigger membership what we need is quality not quantity that's the trouble he's hunting for the pride today Elia had a awful time finding quality and then to get her ready to go to the next thing after he found it so you to find quality first and then get quality ready woo that is Trouble boy Pastor have it hard cuz all kind of characters is land in the church my Lord oh praise God I'm closing could be to play something I want to go back to the very first thing that I I hit on before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created all right so God thoughts become creation when it is spoke by a word that is when he presents to you as a thought his thoughts is is revealed to you it's still a thought until you speak it so you understand why Jesus said Lazarus come forth
