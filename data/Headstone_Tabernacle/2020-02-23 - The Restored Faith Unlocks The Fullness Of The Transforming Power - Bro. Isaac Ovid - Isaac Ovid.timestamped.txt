[44:14] attack mode
[44:15] the launch out as to what the deal with
[44:17] what the enemy is he's not just knowing
[44:19] what you have to do good and what you
[44:20] have to do right you have to also know
[44:22] what you're not supposed to do what you
[44:24] just stopped doing
[44:25] oh praise the name of the Lord amen so
[44:28] before but I succumb and bring the word
[44:30] I want to read a scripture I want to
[44:34] read a scripture from Acts chapter 8 if
[44:40] you want to go play Bibles it could be
[44:43] seated and I want to read we read this
[44:47] some time ago but Philip went on the
[44:49] city of Samaria and preached Christ unto
[44:51] them I want to go a little further then
[44:53] Philip this acts tough to eat we didn't
[44:55] verse 5 then Philip went down to the
[44:57] city of Samaria and preached Christ unto
[44:59] them and the people with one Accord give
[45:04] heed unto those things which shall have
[45:05] speak hearing and seeing the miracles
[45:07] which he did for unclean spirits crying
[45:11] with Lord voice came out of many that
[45:13] were possessed with them and many taken
[45:16] with pulses and they were lame were
[45:18] healed and there was great joy in the
[45:20] city but there was a certain man called
[45:22] Simon which before time in the same city
[45:26] used sorcery and bewitched the people of
[45:29] Samaria given out that himself was some
[45:33] great one so he didn't wait for people
[45:35] to say he's great he was given out about
[45:38] himself how great he was to whom they
[45:41] all give heed that mean to listen to
[45:43] this dude from the least the greatest
[45:45] that means the top in government the
[45:47] lowest everybody taken on this man
[45:49] called Simon because he's a sorcerer
[45:51] so he's demonstrating demonic powers ok
[45:54] and but when they
[45:57] Philips preach him the things concerning
[45:59] the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[46:02] Christ they were baptized both men and
[46:05] women then Simon himself believed also
[46:09] and when he was baptized he continued
[46:12] Philip and wondered behold in the
[46:15] miracles and signs which were done so
[46:18] this was Simon's attraction he believed
[46:20] and his eye and miracles and the power
[46:23] of God that is working with Philip let's
[46:25] continue now when the Apostles which
[46:27] were Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[46:30] received the Word of God they sent unto
[46:32] them Peter and John who when they come
[46:36] down prayed for them that they might
[46:38] receive the Holy Ghost listen to his
[46:40] ways though for as yet he which is the
[46:45] Holy Ghost was fallen upon none of them
[46:48] only D were baptized in the name of the
[46:52] Lord Jesus Christ
[46:53] so I specifically want identify the
[46:56] scripture to show you that it was a
[46:58] direct experience that they had to
[47:00] receive the people there was no need
[47:06] baptized in water the Holy Ghost had not
[47:09] yet fallen on them okay then watch they
[47:14] lay their hands on them and they
[47:16] received the Holy Ghost
[47:17] this same Holy Ghost people didn't know
[47:19] about the receiver here now when Simon
[47:23] saw that through the laying on of the
[47:27] Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given
[47:31] he offered them money now this is Simon
[47:35] who supposed to be the former sorcerer
[47:38] before my witch doctor before must see
[47:41] me demon when he see the Holy Ghost
[47:44] fallen by the leonov ants he offered
[47:46] them money
[47:47] listen saying give me also this power
[47:50] you see wonder in this poor morning he
[47:54] want to remain the man of the hour be
[47:56] the change over man what whatever post
[47:59] one would give me of this power that on
[48:02] whomsoever I lay hands he may receive
[48:04] the Holy Ghost but Peter said unto Him
[48:07] thy money
[48:10] because thou has thought that the gift
[48:13] of God may be purchased with money there
[48:16] was neither part nor lot in this matter
[48:18] for the Hat is not right in the sight of
[48:20] God this is a person I believe there's a
[48:24] person that baptized this the person
[48:26] that is following whose heart is not
[48:28] right Peter said repent therefore for
[48:34] this thy wickedness and pray God if
[48:37] perhaps the thought of thine hat be
[48:39] forgiven thee for I perceive that door
[48:42] what in the gall of bitterness and then
[48:44] the bond of iniquity then answered Simon
[48:47] and said pray for e to the Lord for me
[48:49] that none of these things which are
[48:51] spoken upon me upon me praise the name
[48:54] of the Lord so I just brought bring that
[48:55] the attention to show you the power of
[48:58] the early church on how the witness of
[49:00] the Holy Ghost was so powerful that
[49:02] characters and and what you call is here
[49:04] boy sneaking away : again it ever
[49:10] sending them sending them to infiltrate
[49:13] the move of God Satan himself because I

[1:10:40] when you among brethren it's a living
[1:10:43] it's a continual sacrifice you're you're

[1:11:20] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:11:23] will of God
[1:11:24] may the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:11:26] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:11:28] this morning certainly great to be in
[1:11:31] the house of the Lord this morning and
[1:11:34] we have been having quite a time the
[1:11:37] last few weeks you appreciate but over
[1:11:38] it he has been preaching every service
[1:11:41] and he seems just as strong as when he
[1:11:46] started out huh hey man so we thank God
[1:11:50] for that and he's been on a truck for
[1:11:52] some time speaking about the restored
[1:11:54] feet and speaking about the feet and he
[1:11:56] was kneeling on her feet in a couple of
[1:11:58] weeks ago he said like a switch and he
[1:11:59] started to connect the feet to the Holy
[1:12:01] Ghost so he didn't know what I had so to
[1:12:03] him I had a thought and my title this
[1:12:06] morning is the restored feet unlocked
[1:12:08] the fullness of the transforming power
[1:12:11] the restored faith unlocks the fullness
[1:12:14] of the transforming power and a subject
[1:12:17] change from glory to glory and an
[1:12:20] inspiration and inspiration the
[1:12:21] transforming power is the Holy Ghost can
[1:12:25] the church say man you believe that this
[1:12:28] morning
[1:12:28] Amen now the word transform and by the
[1:12:33] Branham it was on September the 11th
[1:12:36] 1965 he preached on transformation then
[1:12:39] October 31st so this is in the closing
[1:12:42] chapters of parables ministry he
[1:12:45] preached God's power to transform and
[1:12:47] the power transformation in September
[1:12:49] and October of 1965 and in there he also
[1:12:53] pulled the definition of it because when
[1:12:55] I said I look at it sometimes you just
[1:12:57] hear it
[1:12:57] Church transformation the power to
[1:12:59] transform or when you dig down into the
[1:13:01] definition of it it gives you a whole
[1:13:03] different perspective on it so the
[1:13:05] transform means the change in
[1:13:07] composition or structure so if the
[1:13:10] composition change that's something the
[1:13:13] structure can also change it means a
[1:13:15] change the outward form or appearance it
[1:13:19] means a change in character or condition
[1:13:21] can the church say man it's us it's the
[1:13:25] subject of mathematical transformation
[1:13:27] it's the cause a cell to undergo genetic
[1:13:31] transformation so when we talk about
[1:13:33] God's power to transform the
[1:13:35] transformation can either be in
[1:13:37] composition it could be in structure it
[1:13:40] could be an outward form or it could be
[1:13:42] an appearance it could be in character
[1:13:44] or it could be in condition it could be
[1:13:47] mathematical or it could be genetic
[1:13:49] somebody preached back to me this
[1:13:50] morning so I started a core to the
[1:13:53] scriptures and I looked at how Jesus did
[1:13:56] a mathematical transformation but it's
[1:13:57] even tough to correct me I'm not a
[1:13:59] mathematician but in my simple
[1:14:01] mathematical understanding it's a five
[1:14:04] loaves and two fishes and it was the
[1:14:06] power of transformation that took the
[1:14:08] five loaves and two fishes and the match
[1:14:10] did not make sense because he had five
[1:14:13] thousand people and there were twelve
[1:14:15] baskets remaining if that's not a power
[1:14:17] transformation I don't know what is
[1:14:19] somebody preached back to me this
[1:14:21] morning Jesus found himself in a wedding
[1:14:24] and they ran out of wine they brought
[1:14:27] water to him he said Jesus will run out
[1:14:31] of wine he said bring some water before
[1:14:33] he even said that he said what is how is
[1:14:35] this my problem I'm just a guest in the
[1:14:38] wedding but if you ask the power of
[1:14:40] transformation to change the situation
[1:14:43] because the condition needed to be
[1:14:45] changed it's a change of condition there
[1:14:47] was a condition that presented itself
[1:14:49] they ran out of wine somebody helped me
[1:14:51] this morning so the condition another
[1:14:54] kind of transformation he said bring
[1:14:56] some water and when the Branum said that
[1:14:59] eventually that water would have met
[1:15:01] grapes and those grapes would have been
[1:15:03] fermented and those fermented grapes
[1:15:05] would have spended
[1:15:06] I am fermenting and then it'll be put in
[1:15:08] a wine jar and eventually would have
[1:15:10] ended up maybe in the wedding somewhere
[1:15:12] but Jesus bypassed the process because
[1:15:16] he was the god of transformation can the
[1:15:19] church say Amen hallelujah anybody with
[1:15:23] me this morning I just wanna encourage
[1:15:25] your feet this morning that
[1:15:27] transformation is coming your way it
[1:15:30] could be in composition it could be in
[1:15:32] structure it could be an outward form it
[1:15:35] could be an appearance God Himself
[1:15:37] transform himself from caught above us
[1:15:40] so God with us and he transformed
[1:15:43] himself God and morphe its
[1:15:45] transformation to God in us so when
[1:15:48] Jesus second little stroll didn't
[1:15:51] realize it was the same God who said let
[1:15:54] it be
[1:15:55] he's a code of transformation and the
[1:15:58] church cement and there's a promise to
[1:16:01] you and to me that we can access this
[1:16:04] power transformation not just a
[1:16:06] transformed composition or appearance
[1:16:09] but the fullness of the power
[1:16:12] transformation the fullness of the
[1:16:14] transforming power when the church Haman
[1:16:18] you may be seated
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:23] transformation it means change it is
[1:16:27] unfortunate that many people come to
[1:16:29] church and they don't change let me
[1:16:35] rephrase that they are changing but not
[1:16:39] for the positive because when the
[1:16:41] Branham taught us that whenever you come
[1:16:43] to church you either get better or you
[1:16:47] get worse but a change has taken place
[1:16:49] and you have to realize that your mind
[1:16:53] has to change the Bible says be not
[1:16:57] conformed to this world conform is not
[1:17:01] transformed but a Branham said that the
[1:17:04] devil t-phones so this is you erroneous
[1:17:07] word form as a delicate issue because
[1:17:09] there are people who are being deformed
[1:17:11] their choices deform them
[1:17:14] their decisions deform them because the
[1:17:17] devil is the master of deformation the
[1:17:19] world handles conformation but Jesus is
[1:17:23] about transformation somebody reached
[1:17:25] back to me this morning
[1:17:27] you see conform and deform don't
[1:17:31] introduce a new element this is
[1:17:34] conforming when I move something
[1:17:36] it's conforming to my wishes of what I
[1:17:39] wanted to be but transformation is when
[1:17:42] I could replace this with some new
[1:17:44] elements what I can introduce a new
[1:17:47] element so where the random said you'll
[1:17:49] pick up a dirty glass
[1:17:52] he said you wash the glass you see they
[1:17:55] pour milk in the glass when he is a new
[1:17:58] elementary thing it's a whole different
[1:18:00] story can the church say man so God is
[1:18:03] interested in change he's interested in
[1:18:05] transformation he's interested in change
[1:18:08] in your walk change in your talk change
[1:18:11] oh come on somebody help me this morning
[1:18:13] so when you meet the transforming power
[1:18:16] your mind can change your heart can
[1:18:20] change your character to change your
[1:18:23] purpose could change your mission is
[1:18:26] supposed to change your motives are
[1:18:29] supposed to change your objectives are
[1:18:31] supposed to change your desires are
[1:18:34] supposed to change your passions are
[1:18:36] supposed to change your body is supposed
[1:18:38] to change your thoughts are supposed to
[1:18:41] change your nature is supposed to change
[1:18:43] your attitude is supposed to change your
[1:18:46] motivation is supposed to change your
[1:18:49] inspiration is supposed to change your
[1:18:51] burnin is supposed to change your
[1:18:54] knowledge is supposed to change how you
[1:18:56] talk to your wife it's supposed to
[1:18:58] change how you talk to your children
[1:18:59] it's supposed to change come on now
[1:19:02] somebody preach back to me God wants to
[1:19:06] move you from your currency or you'll be
[1:19:10] forced it into his desired state or your
[1:19:14] after seat people must be able to watch
[1:19:16] you and say that's not the same person
[1:19:19] that's not a person I know they have
[1:19:22] changed not change for the worse but
[1:19:24] will you look at you they must see this
[1:19:26] looks like Jesus this looks like Jesus
[1:19:29] this looks like Jesus walking like Jesus
[1:19:32] talking like Jesus come to church say
[1:19:37] Amen everybody with me this morning you
[1:19:41] remember what my title is - restored
[1:19:42] thief unlocked the fullness of the
[1:19:46] transforming power so we're trying to
[1:19:49] build to something this morning the
[1:19:54] Bible says be transformed by the
[1:19:57] renewing of your mind because before you
[1:20:02] could have a spiritual transformation
[1:20:09] check the scripture it starts with a
[1:20:11] mental transformation and brother
[1:20:14] Branham speaks of mental feat because he
[1:20:17] said faith comes by hearing and hearing
[1:20:20] the word so when God came to Cillian is
[1:20:24] a key area mighty man of Valor before
[1:20:27] Gideon could talk about power or
[1:20:28] understand power God was tryna
[1:20:30] arrest his thinking because God knew
[1:20:33] what his thinking was about himself so
[1:20:36] before God to transform his situation he
[1:20:39] had to change his thinking
[1:20:40] he said Gideon a mighty man of Valor and
[1:20:43] he called out the problem and the
[1:20:45] problem was Gideon's thinking because he
[1:20:49] made it evident by saying but I'm in the
[1:20:51] smallest tribe my family is the smallest
[1:20:56] family and if you bring the whole family
[1:20:58] it's a photo shoot and the smallest one
[1:21:01] in my family you can't be talking about
[1:21:03] me but Kaur was dealing with his
[1:21:06] thinking because before your actions
[1:21:10] could change your thinking after change
[1:21:13] your actions could never change
[1:21:16] if your thinking does not change
[1:21:19] so the preaching of the gospel is to
[1:21:22] introduce a new way of thinking because
[1:21:26] what you think becomes your actions and
[1:21:29] your actions become your habits and your
[1:21:31] habits become where you reach in life
[1:21:33] you're happy become your destiny
[1:21:36] somebody preach back to me let me say
[1:21:38] that again before you can change your
[1:21:41] behavior you have to change your
[1:21:43] thinking because your thinking becomes
[1:21:45] your actions your actions forms your
[1:21:48] habit and your habit is your character
[1:21:51] it's who you are before God could speak
[1:21:54] whether Adam taught it it was a thought
[1:21:56] before it become a whit
[1:21:59] it has to be a thought before it become
[1:22:01] an action for me to pick this up my
[1:22:04] brain had to think picking this up
[1:22:07] before my hand to pick this up when you
[1:22:09] put your hands up to worship you made a
[1:22:11] decision that you're gonna lift your
[1:22:13] hand up to worship every action physical
[1:22:16] or otherwise
[1:22:18] that's mental thought somebody preached
[1:22:20] back to me change your thinking change
[1:22:23] your action so when somebody doesn't
[1:22:25] want to worship it's not a physical
[1:22:27] issue it's a mental issue because they
[1:22:30] got to think differently if they don't
[1:22:32] understand how worship plays into
[1:22:35] spiritual experience you can't get upset
[1:22:38] with them all we gotta do is help them
[1:22:41] to understand that if they could think
[1:22:43] differently or somebody preached back to
[1:22:46] me he transformed by the renewing of
[1:22:49] your mind
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] you maybe see that can we talk a little
[1:22:56] bit when you computer get in trouble
[1:23:00] what do you do you reboot it you reset
[1:23:07] it because something you do so much
[1:23:09] things that you might ask they get back
[1:23:11] to the factory default settings and when
[1:23:14] every Saturday I wanted a worker
[1:23:15] punished in some maybe a loose contact
[1:23:17] information somebody help me this
[1:23:18] morning because I want to get a phone
[1:23:23] working again so God says so so so so
[1:23:27] the words ain't be not conformed but be
[1:23:30] transformed by rebooting your mind
[1:23:33] because you might have some corrupt
[1:23:35] programming some corrupt thinking and
[1:23:38] the word comes to transform your
[1:23:40] thinking
[1:23:41] so as bird always says when the Bible
[1:23:43] says husband's love your wife it is not
[1:23:46] as your father loved your mother but
[1:23:49] it's as Christ loved the church that's a
[1:23:51] thinking loop you know before that
[1:23:55] becomes something that you say well I
[1:23:56] waited for the Holy Ghost are you in
[1:23:58] video that goes to love your wife that's
[1:24:04] a mental issue your thinking needs to
[1:24:09] fix the Babis and as a man thinketh in
[1:24:12] his heart so is he
[1:24:13] if he we're dealing with people who can
[1:24:15] separate the spiritual experience from
[1:24:18] you making a choice because life is
[1:24:19] about choice and as Christians we always
[1:24:25] have a choice but our choices reflect
[1:24:28] our thinking so when we talk about
[1:24:33] transformation it has to start with your
[1:24:37] can the church same and everybody
[1:24:39] feeling fine so let me say it again your
[1:24:42] mind has to change your heart has to
[1:24:49] change your character has to change your
[1:24:53] purpose has to change your mission has
[1:24:56] to change your motive has to change your
[1:24:59] objectives have to change your desires
[1:25:02] have to change your passions have to
[1:25:04] change your body has promised a change
[1:25:07] can the church see going back to Genesis
[1:25:19] but the venom said in the message God's
[1:25:22] power to transform he said I'm thinking
[1:25:24] this morning in Genesis 1 this world was
[1:25:26] without form and it was void and
[1:25:28] darkness was upon it
[1:25:30] nothing but a complete chaos and when
[1:25:32] this world was in a condition the Spirit
[1:25:34] of God moved upon the face of the water
[1:25:36] and the entire picture was changed from
[1:25:40] total chaos the Garden of Eden that is
[1:25:44] transforming power of God that could
[1:25:46] take anything that's nothing and make
[1:25:48] something wonderful out of it that could
[1:25:51] transform in power and the church say
[1:25:53] man
[1:25:54] God loves it's his nature by the
[1:25:56] currents to see chaos and use the
[1:25:59] transforming power to bring order he
[1:26:01] can't help himself you know there's some
[1:26:03] people when they come to your house in
[1:26:05] might see some and it has fix it because
[1:26:07] it's in nature they want to see a
[1:26:09] certain thing in a certain way when they
[1:26:10] get to their house they said no nobody
[1:26:12] picked this or twisted it Lisa right
[1:26:14] good no because they want to see things
[1:26:16] in a certain order God is a God of order
[1:26:18] so when the earth existed when when
[1:26:20] everything existed and there was no
[1:26:22] order was chaos he had to do something
[1:26:24] about it you have to look at the chaos
[1:26:26] and the brother branham said it was a
[1:26:28] transforming power that was used to turn
[1:26:31] the chaos into order he said let there
[1:26:33] be let there be first day second day
[1:26:38] 13:40 he was bringing order order into
[1:26:41] the universe order into the stars on the
[1:26:45] earth and after the 60 he was so pleased
[1:26:48] there was nothing more to transform
[1:26:50] somebody preach back to me everything
[1:26:52] was perfect there was nothing to fix
[1:26:54] there was that adjust there was nothing
[1:26:57] to sweep there was nothing to move in
[1:26:58] place everything was in place everything
[1:27:01] was in order everything was perfect
[1:27:03] so court arrest hallelujah the
[1:27:08] transforming power could take a rest
[1:27:10] because nothing was out of order and so
[1:27:13] to the sons of God when you get closer
[1:27:15] to him you can't stand chaos you want
[1:27:18] order you want order in your life you
[1:27:21] want order in your marriage you want
[1:27:23] order in your family you want order in
[1:27:25] your workplace because you are son of a
[1:27:27] God of order and attribute sons exhibit
[1:27:31] the same type of behaviors like your
[1:27:33] father
[1:27:33] somebody's a man or somebody freaks back
[1:27:37] to me I'm better Pelham taught us that
[1:27:43] then when Adam was in his place he
[1:27:45] operated with a sixth sense and that
[1:27:50] section was fit because the problem
[1:27:53] friends is not the power the power has
[1:27:55] always been
[1:27:56] the problem has never been the power let
[1:28:00] me say that again the problem has never
[1:28:02] been the power when people say where's
[1:28:03] cord where's the miracles when if the
[1:28:06] problem has never the power the problem
[1:28:09] has always been the feet to move the
[1:28:12] power somebody bridge back to me look
[1:28:15] through history all it takes is somebody
[1:28:17] for their fleets across a level and they
[1:28:21] activate power
[1:28:22] oh I don't even have to co-sign power
[1:28:24] when faith is activated it could operate
[1:28:27] independently because it's a principle
[1:28:30] of God see it's connected to power Oh
[1:28:33] somebody happy this morning you may be
[1:28:36] seated this morning oh can I preach a
[1:28:38] little bit feet and power are correlated
[1:28:45] they move together the more feet you
[1:28:48] have the more power you movement as your
[1:28:51] feet Rises listen it's a sense it's a
[1:28:54] sixth sense
[1:28:55] people say well my my eyesight gets
[1:28:58] better they say if you eat certain
[1:29:00] things if you eat carrots I don't know
[1:29:03] how true it is but I'll tell you but
[1:29:04] I've little bit that if you eat carrots
[1:29:06] your eyesight gets better
[1:29:08] so if man is trying to find ways to
[1:29:11] improve this sense call sight when
[1:29:16] people what are these signs of not
[1:29:17] feeling well let's say you lose this
[1:29:20] before if you have the koulouri flu you
[1:29:23] say well I don't really taste it right
[1:29:25] now
[1:29:26] so your your sense of Tears could be
[1:29:29] affected when you get to call your sense
[1:29:31] of smell Kabir they say holy smokes holy
[1:29:33] food smell it
[1:29:34] well a customer right now have the call
[1:29:35] so it means has been a discussion in the
[1:29:38] use of that particular sense
[1:29:41] so when man fell there was a destruction
[1:29:44] in the use of this sense cause it
[1:29:48] the same width could interact with the
[1:29:51] world and you can know that this is
[1:29:53] something man lost the ability because
[1:29:56] he lost meet the know that there was
[1:29:58] something else out there that kind of
[1:30:00] factory around the physical realm the
[1:30:03] realm of that limited the five senses
[1:30:06] there was a greater sense somebody
[1:30:10] brings back to me this morning this
[1:30:12] sense calls it it's indestructible this
[1:30:16] sense cause it could affect the other
[1:30:18] senses or you don't hear me this morning
[1:30:22] or you don't hear me this morning this
[1:30:24] is a super sense you may be seated
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:30] this sense where the Clarence is the
[1:30:32] independent operating sense this sense
[1:30:35] has a contract with heaven that God
[1:30:36] Himself leaves to operate on its own can
[1:30:43] I see that again that sense brother
[1:30:45] handy could operate on its own quadrille
[1:30:48] even if they get in falls in the
[1:30:49] administration of that sense give me an
[1:30:56] example
[1:30:56] but the Branham was praying for the sick
[1:30:58] he's praying for the sick and there's a
[1:31:01] woman here with crutches she's just
[1:31:03] watching
[1:31:03] she says watching watching the prayer
[1:31:06] watching the healing after a while she
[1:31:09] just walks up to him and him the
[1:31:11] crutches he didn't have to pray for her
[1:31:13] because she activated something that
[1:31:15] bypass the presence of a prophet on the
[1:31:18] earth it was what was it it wasn't it
[1:31:21] you don't hear me this morning you may
[1:31:25] be seated if that's not even good for
[1:31:26] you shut down a minute this independent
[1:31:31] operating sense that could bypass the
[1:31:33] presence of Suns on the earth Jesus is
[1:31:36] ministering and they saw little need she
[1:31:40] has run out of money she has run out of
[1:31:42] doctors she has run out of friends and
[1:31:44] family to go to so she tells us
[1:31:47] she didn't ask a deacon she didn't talk
[1:31:50] to the elder she didn't get from missing
[1:31:52] from the pastor she told herself she
[1:31:56] connected with the Sixth Sense a little
[1:31:58] bit of it not even much not resource it
[1:32:02] not originally a little measure of it
[1:32:05] with a Mensa she told herself if I could
[1:32:09] just touch the hem of His garment and
[1:32:11] Jesus didn't even see it coming
[1:32:14] Jesus standing there may be seated for a
[1:32:16] minute Jesus ministry and who touched me
[1:32:20] because I felt verge you / transforming
[1:32:24] power / dynamics / charity woman the
[1:32:36] place
[1:32:41] somebody please back to me so true of
[1:32:51] the Bible what we have a people who for
[1:32:55] lack of a better explanation if this is
[1:32:58] a line that requires faith to operate
[1:33:02] above to activate power we have these
[1:33:04] aberrations these exceptions to the rule
[1:33:08] that broke past the line and in so doing
[1:33:11] the access power and Jesus LIC if you
[1:33:17] have faith like a mustard seed you could
[1:33:26] say to this mountain be moved anybody
[1:33:30] ever see a mustard seed I'm gonna get
[1:33:33] some examples of mustard seeds the city
[1:33:36] quantity of feet that it takes to move
[1:33:38] mountains I would imagine half of a
[1:33:43] mustard seed to move half a mountain can
[1:33:48] the church say Amen because any sense
[1:33:51] could be strengthened and by the Browns
[1:33:53] picks up at different levels of it for
[1:33:55] mental feet intellectual feet he said it
[1:33:59] starts here even by the bottom said
[1:34:00] intellectually you're hearing the
[1:34:02] message the conversion of that is your
[1:34:04] defeat that the message is supposed to
[1:34:06] produce it's not producing for you quit
[1:34:08] still in the intellectual stage because
[1:34:10] he has to drop to your heart and even
[1:34:14] feed crops they have their levels of
[1:34:16] that feet so he give example he said a
[1:34:18] for lepers or the lepers who are outside
[1:34:20] the city they say if we stay here we die
[1:34:22] that's logical playing mathematics if we
[1:34:25] stay here we die if we go there we die
[1:34:28] both situations have dead but if we stay
[1:34:31] here we don't get anything if we gotta
[1:34:32] be might get something
[1:34:36] let me go and but I'm gonna call it
[1:34:39] didn't she fit the lowest levels meeting
[1:34:42] enough can the church say Amen but we
[1:34:46] are in the age of not didn't see fit
[1:34:48] this is the age of the restoration of
[1:34:50] defeat can the church a man so it means
[1:34:54] that the power we supposed to access is
[1:34:57] that different kind of power come the
[1:34:59] church Haman what answer but I brought
[1:35:01] him said let me read it in Israel before
[1:35:04] the brazen serpent is that I truly
[1:35:05] believe before the church can have the
[1:35:08] rapture is got to have rapture and feet
[1:35:11] we can't even have sea for divine
[1:35:13] healing let alone rapture it got to have
[1:35:16] a feet that'll change and quicken this
[1:35:18] body and be taken away I believe there's
[1:35:21] a church on this road tonight who a
[1:35:24] power of the Living God that man will
[1:35:26] speak to will here and there a little
[1:35:28] flash like lightning and a church is
[1:35:30] coming out not a psychologist not some
[1:35:32] of this put on make-believe but a real
[1:35:35] true genuine anointed holy Eagles called
[1:35:38] our church and that's why I'm speaking
[1:35:40] to this mornin can the church say man
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:47] transforming power transforming power it
[1:35:52] takes feet to move the power that's the
[1:35:56] problem all along it takes feet to move
[1:35:58] the power so the feet you have
[1:36:01] it's connected to the world that's
[1:36:03] available to you so as the word
[1:36:05] increases to you so to your faith is
[1:36:08] supposed to increase so over all of the
[1:36:10] ages has each messenger it's time the
[1:36:13] right hand of God is bringing forth the
[1:36:15] feet supposed to be rising until this
[1:36:17] great Elisha prophet who came to turn
[1:36:19] our hats back to the feet he came to tie
[1:36:23] up all the loose ends he came to restore
[1:36:25] the fullness of the world because the
[1:36:27] word restored as the conductor moves the
[1:36:30] spirit can the church say man I know
[1:36:35] you've heard it said this way that the
[1:36:36] word is a conductor whisper but what is
[1:36:38] the conductor a conductor moves
[1:36:41] something from one place to another
[1:36:42] place so the power is there the wood is
[1:36:46] a conductor of the Spirit so when you
[1:36:48] have a little bit of the word
[1:36:49] using a very small conductors who only
[1:36:50] said the motor power could be
[1:36:52] transferred when the fullness of the
[1:36:54] word is here then you can actually move
[1:36:56] all the power but the word being a
[1:36:59] conductor is to take the power to please
[1:37:02] and a transformer also does a level of
[1:37:07] conversion to transfer the power in that
[1:37:09] watch even if you plug this camera into
[1:37:12] the power supply you know what'll happen
[1:37:13] you blow the camera so something has to
[1:37:18] be able to connect between the power
[1:37:19] supply and what needs to be operated can
[1:37:23] the church say Amen all that God was
[1:37:26] important to Christ all that Christ was
[1:37:27] a positive Church so there has to be
[1:37:29] something about that now could connect
[1:37:30] you to the power supply that you don't
[1:37:33] blow a fuse that you don't blow a gasket
[1:37:35] that you don't blow your engine but the
[1:37:38] power could be used effectively so god
[1:37:40] construct something called character
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:47] because poet or character will blow a
[1:37:49] fuse he said it is with powers of
[1:37:52] clarity satanica do all can accredited
[1:37:54] but when you have character no he could
[1:37:56] connect character to the power supply
[1:37:59] and now you have PO in action power in
[1:38:02] control because Jesus was power in
[1:38:04] control he was God himself he could see
[1:38:07] Lazarus come forth and the church semen
[1:38:10] somebody reached back to me anybody in
[1:38:14] the house is spawning no you understand
[1:38:20] why we can be a Pentecostal Church if it
[1:38:22] can be any kind of a church because we
[1:38:25] have a messenger who has to tie up all
[1:38:28] the loose ends all the mysteries of the
[1:38:30] scripture all of the mission I was
[1:38:32] locked up in the Bible that we can see
[1:38:34] plainly who we are how we are supposed
[1:38:36] to behave how we are supposed to live
[1:38:38] how we are supposed to relate to each
[1:38:40] other how we are supposed to act how we
[1:38:42] are supposed to worship how we are
[1:38:44] supposed to look like in the thymus just
[1:38:47] come to church see man but a Brannon
[1:38:50] went on and God's power to transform and
[1:38:52] everything under control to bring four
[1:38:54] of its kinda remember to bring when he
[1:38:56] put the seed in the earth
[1:38:58] the sea can only come forth with the
[1:39:00] power of life in it to transform it from
[1:39:03] a sea to a pond or whatever it was his
[1:39:06] transforming power now God put the seed
[1:39:09] in here with potentials that it would be
[1:39:11] what he said it would be and as long
[1:39:14] look at the condition as it steered in
[1:39:16] its right category it would be just
[1:39:18] exactly what God said it would be it had
[1:39:21] to beat up me because he had made it
[1:39:23] that way and made a channel that
[1:39:25] anything that stays in his channel in
[1:39:28] his line of wood it would have to bring
[1:39:31] for exactly like his would said it would
[1:39:34] do it cannot move from there
[1:39:37] it's channeled exactly right so with
[1:39:40] everything in the trust of his own son
[1:39:42] that it would be that with and court
[1:39:44] said it's all good
[1:39:45] so I'll just rest so God lead every seat
[1:39:48] and in every seat was potential and as
[1:39:51] long as the seed that had potential
[1:39:54] Steve in his channel it would bring
[1:39:57] forth the way it was supposed to can the
[1:39:59] church be man
[1:40:00] once the apple or the mango seed
[1:40:03] stealing his computer's channel it will
[1:40:05] bring forth mango trees every time and
[1:40:07] Adam had the potential in him to produce
[1:40:10] sounds by the spoken word that was the
[1:40:12] potential that was in him Oh Adam I to
[1:40:16] do was T in the channel all Adam had to
[1:40:21] do a stay in the channel and it wouldn't
[1:40:23] fool the way it was supposed to because
[1:40:25] in the seed has the potential to bring
[1:40:28] for there is nothing to add to the see
[1:40:30] the seed has the potential already God
[1:40:33] is not adding the potential to the seed
[1:40:35] the word seed has the potential but the
[1:40:38] personal rapture and faith is laying in
[1:40:40] the message this seed of this message
[1:40:43] planted in your soul has the potential
[1:40:45] for you to be in the rapture this word
[1:40:49] seed sown by the Son of man has the
[1:40:52] potential for your complete healing in
[1:40:56] this seed of this message soon by the
[1:41:00] Son of man
[1:41:02] son of men fear in a son of man that's
[1:41:05] it as all the potential in that scene
[1:41:09] has seven live voices in that cedar
[1:41:12] seven thunders and that she does
[1:41:14] manifestation of the sons of God in that
[1:41:17] seat has your family in that seat
[1:41:19] missing limbs will be restored in that
[1:41:22] seat there's no doubt in that seat is
[1:41:24] only light in that see there's power in
[1:41:27] that seat is authority in that seat as
[1:41:30] concurrent Devils in that seat is
[1:41:32] putting your foot on the neck on every
[1:41:34] situation and that series your financial
[1:41:37] breakthrough and that scene is your
[1:41:38] passive and son being delivered in that
[1:41:41] seat everything is laying in that seat
[1:41:44] [Music]
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:51] but it only remains potential unless you
[1:41:58] bring it into the right channel and the
[1:42:01] right channel is the channel of the word
[1:42:05] it's not the channel of a church it's
[1:42:08] not the channel of a group is that the
[1:42:10] challenge of a Creed it's a channel of
[1:42:12] the word once you put that seed in the
[1:42:16] channel of the wood that seat does what
[1:42:19] it's supposed to do the only time the
[1:42:21] seed doesn't release the potential is
[1:42:23] when it's in another channel and that's
[1:42:30] a problem today people have their own
[1:42:32] channel just think about it what channel
[1:42:38] are you tuned into are you chewing into
[1:42:42] the wood because if it curated the wood
[1:42:45] then all the potential seek you first
[1:42:48] the kingdom of God and all these things
[1:42:50] will be added that's in the seed you
[1:42:51] know if you put on the right channel the
[1:42:55] channel of the wood then that sea just
[1:42:57] begins so your business success that
[1:42:59] you're fighting up to get is locked up
[1:43:01] in DC but what channel you're watching
[1:43:03] because the channel that you watching I
[1:43:06] wouldn't even cried out look how old are
[1:43:08] they are being successful he say have
[1:43:09] you considered the end because I was on
[1:43:12] a different channel from you you
[1:43:13] watching there
[1:43:14] you don't even watch any channel
[1:43:16] somebody please back to me other people
[1:43:20] is not your channel other people in
[1:43:23] church that's not your channel
[1:43:25] oh come on somebody please back to me
[1:43:27] what are the church's groups doing
[1:43:29] that's not your channel your channel is
[1:43:31] you would it's you and you would
[1:43:34] watching each other the world watching
[1:43:37] you and you watch in the world and the
[1:43:39] more you watch the word and you and the
[1:43:41] see in the world begin to communicate
[1:43:42] you lose all these factions you lose all
[1:43:46] our position you know what a Branham
[1:43:49] separates in a man could be so
[1:43:51] surrendered to God that he'd never don't
[1:43:53] know what to do with him did ever Scout
[1:43:55] try this I tried that but I managed
[1:43:58] switch in the channel I tried to get to
[1:44:01] know what she news but he s when she
[1:44:02] channel I try to get to the watch trump
[1:44:05] but he has switched channel
[1:44:06] he just focus on the word he wants to
[1:44:09] know what the word says about his family
[1:44:11] is that I'm watching them he watch in
[1:44:13] the world I want I don't want to watch
[1:44:15] them I wanna do other words about my son
[1:44:17] I want to find everywhere that says my
[1:44:20] son has to be delivered because if I do
[1:44:22] that that'll take care of itself
[1:44:24] cuz somebody help me they're smaller
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:39] I'll give it a business example many
[1:44:42] businesses say watch what a competition
[1:44:44] is doing that has his place but you know
[1:44:46] the most successful companies say I'd
[1:44:48] even want is it takes everything is cost
[1:44:50] enough it takes time to look at the
[1:44:52] competition
[1:44:54] so amazon.com for example Jeff Bezos is
[1:44:59] a wealthiest man in the world right now
[1:45:00] a trillion dollar company and they said
[1:45:04] that his focus was on such real endless
[1:45:07] customer satisfaction that he was they
[1:45:11] were looking at the competition but in
[1:45:13] pursuing customer satisfaction the
[1:45:15] competition got destroyed because he
[1:45:19] found something you wanted to focus on
[1:45:21] then I'm doing look at no competition
[1:45:23] forget it competition focus on being the
[1:45:26] best product having the best company
[1:45:29] having the best customer service
[1:45:30] everything will take care of itself
[1:45:32] best product yes service best delivery
[1:45:35] best product best service that's
[1:45:38] delivery and in doing that the
[1:45:41] competition is getting lick up lick up
[1:45:43] left he wasn't really take on the
[1:45:44] competition keep focus best product
[1:45:47] that's company that's customers best
[1:45:49] service and he drilled the company
[1:45:51] drilled the company and chorus in
[1:45:53] adoption perfection forget everything
[1:45:56] else holiness purity revival power see
[1:46:01] focus it's gonna happen
[1:46:03] he's never filled he is never
[1:46:06] disappointed he has never lost a battle
[1:46:08] steer focus it's gonna happen super
[1:46:11] Church super ace rise revival young
[1:46:14] people being delivered and the church
[1:46:17] say man oh come on now somebody please

[1:47:24] problem he could handle the situation

[1:47:32] somebody give God a shout of praise
[1:47:34] hallelujah I'm not gonna encourage you
[1:47:37] this morning because his gospel is a
[1:47:39] real gospel you may be seated
[1:47:41] I'm one of a few people wonderfully I am
[1:47:44] tired of church because church is a
[1:47:50] means to an end
[1:47:51] god I put this here to have Church you
[1:47:53] know he put us here to have power Oh
[1:47:56] somebody please back to me he put us
[1:47:59] here to have dominion
[1:48:00] when God put Adam in even in the galleys
[1:48:03] hey Adam Sunday morning at 10 o'clock I
[1:48:05] want to see you know he said Adam have
[1:48:06] two million if you see that it's molten
[1:48:09] removed whatever you name your name
[1:48:11] whatever but because man losses six
[1:48:14] cents we have to go to this process to
[1:48:16] reconnect to the sixth sense but when we
[1:48:19] come back to the sixth sense the unity
[1:48:21] of the faith knowledge of the Son of God
[1:48:23] stretch up a perfect man
[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:27] I've said it a minister of the faithful
[1:48:30] is temporary
[1:48:31] it's until we reconnect the sixth sense
[1:48:36] you may be seated
[1:48:38] the sixth sense with a pop well active
[1:48:41] is my direct line the direct
[1:48:44] communication that when I speak
[1:48:46] everything else when I sign angels
[1:48:49] heaven respect my signature disease come
[1:48:53] out the doctor go and say let me get
[1:48:55] approval and if no no no no no never
[1:48:57] come out demon come out sickness come
[1:49:00] out Lazarus come forth they have to take
[1:49:02] note because a son is on the earth and
[1:49:05] the trance a man many people go to
[1:49:18] school and the despair of a great
[1:49:22] teacher is when they see a student with
[1:49:25] potential wasted I'm sure you've seen it
[1:49:34] people you know people who have
[1:49:37] potential family members neighbors
[1:49:41] disabled this boy bright why he missing
[1:49:45] school why he not be intelligent you see
[1:49:49] the potential you see his aptitude you
[1:49:51] see what he's able to do he or she or
[1:49:53] whatever it is and life is full of
[1:49:56] people who have not lived up to their
[1:50:00] potential but the Branham said it girl
[1:50:05] don't make halfway Christians God don't
[1:50:09] make halfway preachers but the Christian
[1:50:11] can be halfway appreciate to be halfway
[1:50:13] l-look at me halfway a deacon could be
[1:50:15] halfway the context of halfway means
[1:50:20] that there's more there's potential that
[1:50:22] is unused unfulfilled unrealized so the
[1:50:30] issue is not potential because there
[1:50:32] were many people who came that his
[1:50:33] messages messages power they came in and
[1:50:37] they were given the potential because
[1:50:39] the seed was there but because they
[1:50:41] didn't get into the right channel
[1:50:42] because a channel is the environment the
[1:50:46] word has his environment because a word
[1:50:51] attracts the spirit by default by
[1:50:55] default you know after propose a spirit
[1:50:58] the word attracts the Holy Ghost so we
[1:51:02] need an atmosphere of the word the Holy
[1:51:04] Ghost just recognizes something about
[1:51:06] you and him because he's attracted to
[1:51:09] his word or somebody preached back to me
[1:51:12] this morning you may be seen it for a
[1:51:14] minute what have we been taught before
[1:51:18] 1906 before the Pentecostals on the
[1:51:21] Wesleyan and the holiness and that
[1:51:23] dispensation the people was so
[1:51:25] sanctified by the word that the Holy
[1:51:29] Ghost wanted to fall they want crying
[1:51:33] out for the Holy Ghost they were not
[1:51:35] looking for the Holy Ghost they were not
[1:51:37] seeking the Holy Ghost but their holy
[1:51:40] lives what was attracting the Holy Ghost
[1:51:46] and because the word hadn't opened to
[1:51:51] them enough the Deacons were instructed
[1:51:54] whether a man put a bucket of water but
[1:51:58] Andy put a bucket of water but he'll
[1:52:00] keep a bucket of water because these
[1:52:02] sanctify people when they start to
[1:52:04] attract the Holy Spirit when he see them
[1:52:06] said to move too much shorter and that's
[1:52:10] what I did back then before the Azusa
[1:52:12] Street revival what was it they live
[1:52:15] such a sanctified life that the devil
[1:52:18] had to step out and the Holy Ghost could
[1:52:20] step in until the season change so don't
[1:52:26] give me no excuses about why you were
[1:52:28] the position that you're in because
[1:52:29] you're in the wrong channel it is not
[1:52:32] God's job to put you in the right
[1:52:33] channel it is not good job to come into
[1:52:35] your house and changee station or
[1:52:37] changing music or come on your phone and
[1:52:39] oh somebody help me this mornin
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:44] that's what you have to do yourself and
[1:52:49] once you do that
[1:52:51] he sends his spirit into your living
[1:52:53] room into your bedroom into your car
[1:52:56] into your workplace can the church say
[1:53:00] Amen
[1:53:00] Oh hallelujah because you're in the
[1:53:03] channel you're in the channel you wanna
[1:53:08] get so deep in the channel that you
[1:53:09] can't come out
[1:53:10] you wanna get sauced surrounded by the
[1:53:12] wood you don't know your head from your
[1:53:14] foot all the sinners would you see
[1:53:16] yourself in the wood you see the word in
[1:53:18] you you see the world in your brother
[1:53:20] you don't see the faults in the brother
[1:53:22] you see the word in your brother you may
[1:53:27] be seated
[1:53:28] can the church say man it's a change of
[1:53:32] behavior it's a change of attitude is a
[1:53:35] change of operation when you look at the
[1:53:40] word made flesh he blows our mind with
[1:53:43] his action I think back to when Judas is
[1:53:48] there Jesus knows who Judas is and not
[1:53:50] once could you find a scripture where he
[1:53:52] he made us feel bad when the time came
[1:53:57] for Judas Ogando why do you say and let
[1:53:59] the devil in this church go and do it no
[1:54:01] he didn't say that this demon is a demon
[1:54:07] hear it no no no no he said whatever you
[1:54:11] do do quickly never I just thought he
[1:54:13] went to bring something in did you
[1:54:16] forget something on the donkey outside I
[1:54:18] know it wasn't easy for the Prophet
[1:54:26] because the Prophet sees person the
[1:54:27] people but I said many times and and
[1:54:31] they say you could not tell his enemies
[1:54:32] from his friends he would see the spirit
[1:54:35] upon the people people who shouting
[1:54:37] people who worship and people who say
[1:54:39] thank you Jesus and in there is a demon
[1:54:41] of jealousy demon of envy demon of lust
[1:54:45] demon of hatred
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:52] and he had had the grace and the
[1:54:54] compassion he exhibited the same thing
[1:54:57] that Jesus did
[1:55:01] now the more you in the world you'll
[1:55:04] behavior will change because it changes
[1:55:06] your thinking when you see that in the
[1:55:11] scripture and it becomes a part of who
[1:55:12] you are then you'll be easier reflects
[1:55:16] that it is not a putana to the shows
[1:55:19] that are walking up trying to deal with
[1:55:21] this but and know something about them I
[1:55:22] trying to be with it no it becomes the
[1:55:25] expression it becomes the way you live I
[1:55:28] said it up to a year to I want to a
[1:55:31] message on your way but I random lived
[1:55:33] and show you how the way Jesus lived and
[1:55:37] to show you how far people who call
[1:55:39] themselves Christians live because it's
[1:55:43] not the same we have to be like Jesus
[1:55:50] we have to see like Jesus and when we
[1:55:57] begin to get that level of maturity you
[1:55:59] will have more love and compassion for
[1:56:01] your brother more love and compassion
[1:56:05] whenever I'm administering him he would
[1:56:06] miss it by saying you I know you don't
[1:56:08] want to be this way but it's a spirit
[1:56:11] operating upon you so he would deal with
[1:56:14] his spirit and then see the person go
[1:56:15] free can the church a man and people
[1:56:19] come to children all kind of baggage all
[1:56:21] kind of stuff but when you come into
[1:56:26] world because the devil cast down the
[1:56:28] wood he can do no he knows that he
[1:56:32] believes it but when he started expose
[1:56:34] him he has a child of friends on my
[1:56:35] outside so our job is to expose the
[1:56:38] devil at every one of his tricks and as
[1:56:41] we expose him he have no room
[1:56:44] that's why the Bible said in verse said
[1:56:46] he'll be chained by circumstance
[1:56:48] what is that chained by suitable son
[1:56:50] he'd be bound because there'll be no
[1:56:51] please phone for him in your heart if
[1:56:54] the devil is looking for some place to
[1:56:55] live today he's looking for somebody see
[1:56:57] can I find a place in his heart in heart
[1:56:59] and if your heart is closed and your
[1:57:01] hatches closed and your heart is closed
[1:57:03] then he'd ever cut fire every say listen
[1:57:04] I gotta find the next business because I
[1:57:08] have nobody to operate through can the
[1:57:10] church say man
[1:57:11] everybody feelin fine could you take
[1:57:14] some more I haven't even read II started
[1:57:17] you know I don't recognize I reach me at
[1:57:25] six just see you have 51 but then
[1:57:31] tomorrow is kind of about Monday so I
[1:57:36] wake up this morning early and Karen
[1:57:39] same a Whitner like that done five
[1:57:42] o'clock anymore because they're jumpin
[1:57:44] Isaac but we're they get energy for so
[1:57:49] nobody tired
[1:57:52] nobody knows was retired we know
[1:57:55] starting can the church say Amen
[1:57:58] we know warming up in them we ought to
[1:58:01] be the happiest people on the face of
[1:58:04] e-wallet joy supposed to be coming
[1:58:07] through your hands your pores yeah you
[1:58:10] can't wait to come to the house a lot
[1:58:11] and it can't wait to go to work to go to
[1:58:14] school
[1:58:14] to demonstrate this goodness of Jesus
[1:58:16] upon your life can the church say Amen
[1:58:20] so what are we talking about the
[1:58:21] restored feet unlocks the fullness of
[1:58:25] the transforming power and I'm making a
[1:58:27] distinction between transforming power
[1:58:29] and the fullness of it and you know I'm
[1:58:31] going because it takes a certain faith
[1:58:33] for the rapture a feat that many trees
[1:58:37] did never had the feet for the rapture
[1:58:38] because as a special kind of it give it
[1:58:41] a special kind of people can the church
[1:58:43] say Amen so but I balanced it was a
[1:58:45] transforming power that came to Abraham
[1:58:48] it Brahmas our old man his wife was an
[1:58:51] old lady not only were they old and
[1:58:54] scare in particular was all but she was
[1:58:56] also barren so she had to get double
[1:58:58] transformation God change her like a
[1:59:00] young woman and change her barrenness
[1:59:03] into a fruitful woman but but her plants
[1:59:06] it was a transforming power and by the
[1:59:08] parent said God sends his transforming
[1:59:11] power to fulfill his would and by the
[1:59:13] venom of the same God sends the Holy
[1:59:15] Ghost as the enforcer the back of the
[1:59:17] wood so will he talk about a
[1:59:18] transforming power and the Holy Ghost
[1:59:21] doesn't that a song like the same thing
[1:59:23] that something has to follow the word to
[1:59:25] bring it to pass somebody piece back to
[1:59:28] me and it transformed an old man and an
[1:59:31] old woman because he promised he would
[1:59:33] do it and what God promises to do that
[1:59:36] he'll do there's nothing any perverted
[1:59:39] thing grab court can do nothing with it
[1:59:41] but he will keep his word and he is
[1:59:44] his spirit i the lord have planted it I
[1:59:47] will water it day and night less some
[1:59:50] should pluck it from my hands all
[1:59:52] wandering stars you will desire in your
[1:59:55] heart you've got to have it or you
[1:59:57] wouldn't be sitting here this morning
[1:59:58] and the church say man and you wouldn't
[2:00:01] be in these churches and order terms of
[2:00:03] things you are in out across the land if
[2:00:05] something didn't bring you in here some
[2:00:07] person spoke to you don't go any further
[2:00:09] there's a washing of the water by the
[2:00:11] word that'll make you white as snow
[2:00:14] Ibrahim believed God and God caught any
[2:00:17] and caught anything contrary can the
[2:00:19] church say man what is it it's a
[2:00:22] transforming power Abraham didn't know
[2:00:24] how this gonna happen but God said is
[2:00:26] gonna have a son when I asked around how
[2:00:29] you're feeling God said I'm going to
[2:00:31] have a son how you feeling today Rahab
[2:00:33] God said I'm gonna have a son oh yeah
[2:00:35] feelings here Abraham go tell Abraham
[2:00:37] because God and speak to Sarah directly
[2:00:39] until he came I will return unto thee
[2:00:41] according to the time of life and Sarah
[2:00:43] gonna have a son and the church say man
[2:00:46] and Abraham held on until one day he
[2:00:50] didn't realize what had happened he
[2:00:51] looked in the mirror I say wait a minute
[2:00:53] Abraham you're looking a bit younger
[2:00:55] than it did yesterday you feel a little
[2:00:57] bit stronger than you've had last week
[2:00:58] you ain't just last week what today
[2:01:01] you're feeling stronger

[2:01:05] a transforming power that's keeping you
[2:01:07] alive that's keeping me alive we shall
[2:01:10] not all sleep but the transforming power
[2:01:13] one of these days we'll turn this gray
[2:01:15] hair back the transforming power will
[2:01:18] take this bald head and put here back on
[2:01:21] it the transforming power if we could
[2:01:23] make an old man and an old woman young
[2:01:26] again to have a son what about you and
[2:01:29] the church here in Abraham steal the
[2:01:32] bullet of the world was not even reveal
[2:01:34] but the transforming power can made him
[2:01:37] young again what about our team when we
[2:01:40] have the fullness of the world every
[2:01:42] mysterion feel oh and the church say
[2:01:45] Oh hallelujah
[2:01:50] but if I said come back to the word come
[2:01:53] back to the world

[2:02:08] speaking from my house I'm speaking for
[2:02:10] my family I'm speaking for the
[2:02:12] backsliders I have paid for the
[2:02:14] backsliders I ask for the young people
[2:02:17] who are not even in here what kind of
[2:02:20] faith the resource heap the original
[2:02:23] seed that was delivered on the day of
[2:02:25] Pentecost give the Lord a shout of
[2:02:32] praise you may be seated
[2:02:37] hallelujah Abraham was called the father
[2:02:40] of it but the feet that Abraham was and
[2:02:43] the feet that Peter had was a different
[2:02:45] kind of date somebody please back to me
[2:02:47] the flea that Iran had and the pit that
[2:02:49] Peter had was a different kind of niche
[2:02:52] because that was the fear that you
[2:02:54] referred to the earnestly contend for
[2:02:56] the fear that was delivered this was a
[2:02:58] fee that was delivered to them because
[2:03:00] the word himself had come and because
[2:03:03] the fullness of the word was there
[2:03:04] it brought with it a fullness of the
[2:03:06] faith kind of church amen
[2:03:08] Oh somebody please back to me this is
[2:03:12] our revival this is our inspiration the
[2:03:16] tightness you feel that has a subject
[2:03:18] itself but the fullness of the
[2:03:20] transforming power that sickness you
[2:03:22] feel as a subject itself
[2:03:24] the fullness of the transforming power
[2:03:26] your passive son has such as get himself
[2:03:29] little full of the transforming power
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:40] you may be seated
[2:03:42] and then already a prophet is trying to
[2:03:45] hunt and go through what you're looking
[2:03:47] for
[2:03:48] he said looking for scre he says speak
[2:03:50] and just like God in Genesis out of
[2:03:53] nothing the transforming power just like
[2:03:57] in Genesis
[2:03:59] let there be and there was a squirrel
[2:04:00] the same ago said let there be light
[2:04:03] that is fullness that is fullness power
[2:04:07] of creation power of the rapture power
[2:04:10] of healing all every promise this is the
[2:04:12] first time since Genesis that God is
[2:04:15] gonna trust the fullness of his power

[2:11:08] God is not legalistic because if he was

[2:12:52] message people know something wrong with
[2:12:55] that could have no testimony with nobody
[2:13:00] else body people are wrong them so it's
[2:13:02] god bless you god bless she's fine
[2:13:04] brother as in a Muslim as a neighbor as
[2:13:13] important as in family who not in church
[2:13:22] what kind of Christian are you it's easy
[2:13:27] to see who I really was in them you
[2:13:32] never say well what's not after they
[2:13:34] come true if you hear argument if you
[2:13:37] hear what's not we have to go in another
[2:13:39] part of our host I'm not here the
[2:13:41] argument in Dale's our interests it is
[2:13:46] all over me Holy Ghost and fire keeping
[2:13:55] me alive and when they go home keeping
[2:14:00] me alive it has to be consistent you see
[2:14:09] the problem with actin is some nine
[2:14:11] years forget who you're asking for and
[2:14:12] what role you're playing in that way
[2:14:19] must be real because when you're actin
[2:14:21] so Who am I again to this listen to this
[2:14:26] one I'm a gangster this one
[2:14:31] constant one is this you forget to
[2:14:35] forget you rollerblade but consistent
[2:14:40] when it come to church that's brother
[2:14:42] so-and-so mmm glory hole things blessed
[2:14:45] and highly favored I'm not here on the
[2:14:48] head I'm not the tail a bother not be
[2:14:50] neatly no weapon formula against him no
[2:14:53] merit ravenica whyever gas food and what
[2:15:01] what what before they're done why why
[2:15:04] well let's see how Peter hardly seems
[2:15:07] innovation anyway then cockiness went up
[2:15:08] in the roof and just relax
[2:15:13] I say in the caucus but relaxing but the
[2:15:21] Holy Ghost changes your nature behavior
[2:15:25] I've preached before you take a pig
[2:15:28] could he pick nature's the mother that's
[2:15:30] what the brand said you know the
[2:15:31] difference in a pig an alarm because we
[2:15:33] know in every church there's some
[2:15:34] churches who seem to operate at they do
[2:15:36] new one kind of believer that's not in
[2:15:38] the messenger in every church up three
[2:15:41] kinds of believers in every church I
[2:15:43] don't care how unknowing to inspire the
[2:15:45] level quality of teaching in every
[2:15:47] church have three kinds of believers so
[2:15:53] I don't know who is real believers who
[2:15:56] is make believers an anomaly that's not
[2:15:57] my purview it's above my pay grade God
[2:16:03] is the author of these things so there
[2:16:07] we have three kinds of believers can the
[2:16:12] church say man you have to know how much
[2:16:15] of this is being left out in your life
[2:16:17] you have to know what you do it when you
[2:16:20] leave this place because you are you are
[2:16:23] but offenses when nobody watching when
[2:16:26] nobody else is there and you by yourself
[2:16:28] that's when you know who you really are
[2:16:32] and that's opposed such a desire in your
[2:16:37] heart because do you know God gets upset
[2:16:40] when you know better and don't do it God
[2:16:45] gets disturbed when you know better you
[2:16:47] don't do better what does it mean it
[2:16:52] means your mind hasn't really been
[2:16:53] changing because your mind changing
[2:16:55] comes back to belief because if you
[2:16:57] believe something you will act a certain
[2:16:59] way listen this coronavirus record it
[2:17:04] have people listen people believe and
[2:17:06] they belief in this thing is so serious
[2:17:09] that airlines say we don't fly in there
[2:17:11] anymore people have adjusted you don't
[2:17:17] believe now say III just driving through
[2:17:19] the city
[2:17:23] but belief affects your behavior come to
[2:17:28] church say man everybody feeling fine I
[2:17:31] still on page no idea region page 7 come
[2:17:37] back to the would take that would it'll
[2:17:43] grow it's got to go God's transforming
[2:17:45] power that brought it up in the first
[2:17:47] place
[2:17:47] Enoch was translated from dead by God
[2:17:50] transforming power so we see it true the
[2:17:52] message is consistent what did God do
[2:17:54] that for listen the Prophet is answering
[2:17:56] what God did that for and this is course
[2:17:59] this is September of 1965 what God for a
[2:18:03] type of the rapture in church that's
[2:18:05] coming so it'll take a transforming
[2:18:07] power for us to go into the rapture can
[2:18:10] the church Eamon Jesus body was
[2:18:13] quickened after it was dead and in the
[2:18:15] grave Jesus but it was quick about a
[2:18:17] word of God and transformed transforming
[2:18:19] power from a dead call a mature
[2:18:21] resurrected glorified Son of God the
[2:18:23] word has got to come to pass as gods
[2:18:25] would plant it in your heart if you want
[2:18:27] to go in the rafters anybody wants to go
[2:18:29] in the rapture anybody here wants to go
[2:18:31] into the rapture that must be your
[2:18:34] confession you know if you want to be a
[2:18:37] Christian genuine please this would as I
[2:18:40] believe it was Ezekiel God said take
[2:18:42] that school and eat it up the prophet
[2:18:44] and a wood could become the same Abraham
[2:18:46] didn't take the scientific research of
[2:18:48] his day saying I'm too old to have a
[2:18:49] baby I've went too far I've done this
[2:18:51] that or the other but he called anything
[2:18:54] that was contrary to God's Word I'll do
[2:18:56] it wasn't so everything that was
[2:18:58] negative that was not supporting his
[2:19:00] feet his belief he said it doesn't
[2:19:02] matter he's focused on what God said he
[2:19:05] counted everything contrary as doesn't
[2:19:09] matter and he staggered not at the
[2:19:11] promise of God who unbelief but was
[2:19:13] strong
[2:19:14] giving praise to God he know that God
[2:19:16] was able to perform that what he
[2:19:18] promised all wandering sons deform by
[2:19:20] the creepers of this wandering sisters
[2:19:23] that the places and fashions of this
[2:19:25] world has drawed you is that you this
[2:19:27] morning that the fashion of this world
[2:19:29] has caught your attention and has
[2:19:31] distracted you from the channel of the
[2:19:32] wood
[2:19:33] and sister there you might consider me
[2:19:37] an all crank but one of these days when
[2:19:41] you meet what Florence Shikari and met
[2:19:43] the other night that's when a sister had
[2:19:45] passed away in the church as you know
[2:19:46] when you meet that you'll find out not
[2:19:48] me but this wood is right keep out of
[2:19:52] those fashion shops keep out of those
[2:19:53] things it was a transforming power that
[2:19:57] came to Moses
[2:19:58] it was the transforming power that came
[2:20:00] to Gideon it was the transforming power
[2:20:02] that came to Peter it was the
[2:20:05] transforming power hallelujah that met
[2:20:08] the woman with the issue of blood it was
[2:20:11] a transforming power that met the
[2:20:12] servant of the Centurion and we tying it
[2:20:16] up together now I'm not gonna be too
[2:20:17] much longer but it takes feet to move
[2:20:20] the power and when Jesus was speaking to
[2:20:23] the Centurion what did you just say I
[2:20:24] haven't even seen feet like that in
[2:20:27] Israel so it was the feet that God saw
[2:20:31] it wasn't who he was it wasn't he not
[2:20:34] any message not any Church he's not even
[2:20:36] a Jew it wasn't that God look at his
[2:20:38] feet and his feet had to be ignited by a
[2:20:42] belief he would have had to heard
[2:20:45] something somewhere some words somewhere
[2:20:48] that had given him enough feet that he
[2:20:50] came with the fiddles hide a leafy Jesus
[2:20:52] had encountered in all of the teaching
[2:20:54] that it sat on the under Obadiah
[2:20:55] Zedekiah and Jeremiah let me say that
[2:20:58] again
[2:20:59] whatever word that Centurion is it was
[2:21:01] enough wood to give him a greater fit
[2:21:03] because faith comes by here in the wood
[2:21:06] so that Centurion may have heard it from
[2:21:08] a neighbor you may have heard it from
[2:21:10] the street people but it he heard it
[2:21:12] enough and because it was a seed India
[2:21:14] to respond to it that ignited a faith
[2:21:16] that was so great as a Gentile he had
[2:21:20] more fatally choose who grew up in the
[2:21:23] temple that you have not even seen sleep
[2:21:25] like this before the faith that he had
[2:21:29] defeated power how many times you'll
[2:21:35] just say your feet has made you all not
[2:21:37] how much time you attend church how long
[2:21:39] any message your faith is what makes you
[2:21:41] whole
[2:21:43] and it's God's amen and the transforming
[2:21:46] power his faith was so real as a Gentile
[2:21:50] think about it Francis people saw real
[2:21:52] and when he got back in and asked if he
[2:21:54] was healed he said what time I know his
[2:21:58] field I know that I know he's healed I
[2:22:01] wanna see hard time he was here
[2:22:04] how fastest thing does work how
[2:22:07] immediate this thing is he told you just
[2:22:10] speak the word he does what it is a
[2:22:12] speaker would and I know my civil will
[2:22:15] be healed made of hid in this church
[2:22:17] rise today that the words spoken would
[2:22:21] be all that you need to see your
[2:22:23] situation transform just feed the world
[2:22:26] richer just speak the word and I know my
[2:22:29] situation will be transformed can the
[2:22:32] church say Amen but every time goes on
[2:22:43] you see Isaiah's lips he was just an
[2:22:46] ordinary man of unclean lips he said
[2:22:49] Lord I'm among unclean people and I've
[2:22:53] got unclean lips
[2:22:54] woe is me because I've seen God and an
[2:22:56] angel came down got the fire holy fire
[2:23:00] off of God's altar and transformed his
[2:23:02] lips from the lips of a wandering man to
[2:23:05] the lips of a prophet with thus saith
[2:23:08] the Lord God's transforming power a
[2:23:10] hundred and twenty fishermen and little
[2:23:13] ole sellers of purple of woman and those
[2:23:15] goddamn themselves in an upper room and
[2:23:17] closed the doors some of them not enough
[2:23:20] education to sign their own names God
[2:23:23] transform them from fishers of men from
[2:23:26] Memphis to fishers of men from men and
[2:23:29] woman on the street the scenes of God
[2:23:31] immortal the transforming power of God
[2:23:34] may that be the record that's spoken
[2:23:37] about me also transformed from the
[2:23:39] preacher I was to our immortal creature
[2:23:42] hallelujah somebody's give God a shout
[2:23:44] of praise
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:46] [Applause]
[2:23:48] Paul whatever and I went on in course
[2:23:51] poet to transform Paul a local church
[2:23:54] member Presbyterian methodist Baptist
[2:23:57] Pentecostal or something down the street
[2:24:00] he went with his great defiant spirit in
[2:24:03] him that he'd known more than any of
[2:24:05] them he had come up under gamma leo
[2:24:07] one of the best teachers there was in
[2:24:10] the land what happened on his road down
[2:24:12] to the masses anton wrote down to
[2:24:14] damascus get a bunch of people who was
[2:24:16] believing cause would he was going after
[2:24:18] people to kill them but on his road down
[2:24:20] there was tricking nominee heard a
[2:24:22] message and the message but as it
[2:24:24] transformed him from a church member and
[2:24:27] a churchgoer to a prophet of god who
[2:24:30] wrote the would've caught in a new
[2:24:31] testament from a church member to saint
[2:24:34] Oh hallelujah hallelujah can the church
[2:24:38] say man and each age the transforming
[2:24:41] power is getting stronger and stronger
[2:24:43] and stronger because as each eight
[2:24:45] progressed more and more of the word
[2:24:47] first it was Luther with the first light
[2:24:49] then Wesley with the second light then
[2:24:52] the Pentecost with the third light then
[2:24:53] the Prophet came with the fullness of
[2:24:55] the light to reveal the fullness of the
[2:24:57] word to reveal every mystery the time
[2:25:00] every loose end to let there be no doubt
[2:25:02] there'll be no question about who you
[2:25:04] are who God is his nature his being his
[2:25:08] attributes what you were born for that
[2:25:10] no devil has power over you that you
[2:25:12] were there in the back plastic was mine
[2:25:15] that when Lucifer was kicked out you
[2:25:17] were there also when you fought in my
[2:25:19] cup that you will tell also about
[2:25:22] spiritual amnesia and these things how
[2:25:25] you forgot who you were because God put

[2:28:32] human body that gives perfect assurance
[2:28:35] there's more joy in that in five minutes
[2:28:39] than there is an all the worldly
[2:28:41] pleasure that could be given that
[2:28:43] resurrected power but their pattern was
[2:28:45] already feeling it he said when I feel

[2:29:38] what you're supposed to be but you're
[2:29:40] definitely not what you used to be oh

[2:29:56] every defeat every victory battle scars
[2:29:59] so when you line up master David you
[2:30:02] could compare battle scars
[2:30:04] when you line up next to the heroes of
[2:30:05] faith you can look at your scars and
[2:30:08] talk about your stories of how you made
[2:30:10] it over that it was not your strength
[2:30:12] but it was a transforming power you may
[2:30:19] be seated and so is the Holy Spirit it's
[2:30:26] to be manifested it's a promise I don't
[2:30:29] know look around seeing we already had
[2:30:31] revival and I don't know I don't know
[2:30:33] I'm looking for something but ever I
[2:30:35] said this is 63 and so it's a Holy
[2:30:39] Spirit
[2:30:39] it's to be manifested when we see the
[2:30:42] Lord Jesus coming in glory and feel that
[2:30:45] transforming power and see the ten
[2:30:47] rising out of the grave and know that
[2:30:49] that second longer will be changed and
[2:30:51] have a body like his it will be made
[2:30:53] manifested then to those who rejected it
[2:30:56] will be left out who somebody saint man
