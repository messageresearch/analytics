========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] but when God spoke it back here every word of God is steadfast it's immutable it's imparable it cannot fail and when God slay the sun before the foundation of the world he was just as much slaying that as it was a Calvary it's a finished product When God says so and remember when the lamb was slaying your salvation was included in the sacrifice because the Bible said that your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen what about that and what we going to do it's God that showeth Mercy it's God that called you it's God that chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world Jesus said you never you never chose me I chose you and I knew you before the foundation of the world [Music]
