[37:58] who being in the form of god taught it
[38:01] not robbery
[38:02] to be able with god
[38:06] but made himself of no reputation
[38:10] and took upon him the form of a servant
[38:14] and was made in the likeness of me
[38:18] and being found in fashion as a man
[38:22] he humbled himself and
[38:26] became obedient unto death

[40:07] glory to thy self
[40:08] in jesus fighting and we pray amen
[40:12] praise god amen so i have just a little
[40:16] to tie to my testimony and that is
[40:19] the hour of us to be manifested
[40:23] back to the healing of god the hour of
[40:27] us amen
[40:30] the hour of us you and us
[40:34] believe us in christ jesus to be
[40:36] manifested
[40:38] again to the healing of god
[40:42] hallelujah i have a subject
[40:45] my subject is keep your eyes
[40:48] on that elijah of malachi 4.
[40:52] keep your eyes on that elijah
[40:55] of malachi 4 and for inspiration
[40:59] from hebrews 38 amen
[41:03] i just want to quickly draw your
[41:05] attention to this because
[41:07] jesus said in the scripture we're right
[41:09] here let
[41:10] the mind of that mind of christ
[41:14] be in us and when jesus came
[41:19] he didn't come with his own mind he came
[41:22] with the mind of god
[41:24] and that mind of god happens to be what
[41:27] was his
[41:28] mind and here in philly philippians
[41:32] and he was also telling us the things
[41:34] the same thing he said
[41:36] let this mind be in you
[41:39] which was also in christ jesus
[41:45] amen jesus didn't come to fulfill
[41:48] whatever he feels he wanted to fulfill
[41:51] he
[41:52] came to fulfill the will of the father
[41:55] and that is what the bride has also come
[41:58] to do
[41:59] has manifested the sons of god we have
[42:02] come
[42:03] to fulfill amen
[42:06] the mind of god now listen very closely
[42:10] here
[42:11] i have a word i want to read from these
[42:15] message titled identification the
[42:19] prophet preached
[42:20] in 1964 march
[42:24] february 16th amen
[42:28] here the prophet was saying something
[42:29] very spectacular
[42:31] amen and he asked a question
[42:36] and then he said just like you are
[42:39] looking at me and i'm speaking
[42:41] imagine christ standing here
[42:44] he was a man he came in the image of god
[42:47] was the mask of god and the prophet was
[42:50] saying here
[42:52] now what if god stood on the platform
[42:55] today
[42:55] and said what is required of a christian
[43:01] then where would we all be
[43:06] see the character
[43:09] isn't expressing itself
[43:12] now you see hear your prophet
[43:18] and he said his mind was to stay with
[43:21] the father's word
[43:24] their mind was the same mind
[43:27] that was in them was to be in us
[43:31] and if his mind is in us
[43:34] we will do like he did somebody say
[43:39] if his character is in us
[43:42] we will be as he was is that right
[43:47] amen all the prophets had that
[43:50] we know we took think
[43:54] about talking think about nuance
[43:57] how he did in his day moses how he did
[44:01] in his day daniel in his day
[44:05] the hebrew children and so forth the
[44:07] word most god's character to us
[44:10] and anything that is tried to be mixed
[44:13] with that character breaks the mood
[44:16] you can't mix creed with word
[44:20] amen you can't mix the world
[44:24] with the word
[44:27] jesus said you can't serve god
[44:31] a mama mama means the word
[44:35] you can't be one or the other
[44:39] if you love the world or the things of
[44:42] the world
[44:43] the love of god is not even in you
[44:46] is that true then you see
[44:50] you can't mix it you can't mix
[44:53] oil and water it just won't mix
[44:57] praise god to me and that is how it is
[45:00] today
[45:01] you can meet this bride with a church
[45:04] denomination you can mix this bride
[45:08] with all kinds of principles not even
[45:11] the message
[45:12] the word you can mix it with anything
[45:15] denominational or whatever you think
[45:18] praise god amen
[45:20] and therefore this bride is being called
[45:23] to manifest just that pure word
[45:26] and we are here today because
[45:29] god had had us as attributions of god
[45:33] taught in his mind before the foundation
[45:36] of the world
[45:37] and we were made expressed and he had
[45:41] waited to see
[45:42] us being expressed and our sons of god
[45:45] we had to manifest his character
[45:48] praise god remain and that
[45:51] character had to be the expression
[45:55] of the life zoi's life which is the life
[45:58] of christ eternal life
[46:01] and that is what's supposed to be
[46:02] manifested in us
[46:04] praise god amen therefore god
[46:07] identified himself as we are
[46:11] he took his strengths what he was
[46:15] his strengths as god and stretch his
[46:18] tent
[46:18] down here and become woman he made
[46:22] himself a tent
[46:23] a body to live in and that body
[46:26] is known as jesus god lived in christ
[46:30] see he become woman in order to save us
[46:34] and he took our and he took away
[46:37] upon him our form that he might
[46:41] mold in us his character
[46:44] amen therefore and his character was
[46:49] he he did everything that pleased god
[46:52] and he stayed with the world that's
[46:55] what he wanted us for we would stay with
[46:59] god's word
[47:00] find our place and then know
[47:04] where we were stay with his word
[47:07] and think of it we are invited to shape
[47:11] our own character to his
[47:14] now we are going to find out what we
[47:17] have done
[47:18] shape our character to his own by his
[47:22] own spirit
[47:23] then we by him are sons of god
[47:27] just what eyes i have expressed by
[47:31] having his mind in us
[47:34] to shape our character to his
[47:37] his mind let the mind that was
[47:40] in christ be in you if that mind
[47:44] is in you then you see you become
[47:48] manifested sons of god

[52:20] church
[52:20] and associated ministers who had offered
[52:23] me this privilege to be of service to
[52:26] god's people
[52:27] and maybe somewhere along the line we
[52:30] can be of a blessing
[52:31] we trust that christ

[52:38] will rise in our lives and with the
[52:41] earth when of god
[52:42] rise to melt out all that the winters of

[53:02] god bless pastor paul and all the saints
[53:05] god bless you all if you don't mind may
[53:08] we just rise up
[53:09] for the reading of the scriptures
[53:16] if you have your bibles with you i like
[53:18] to
[53:20] read from two passages that look
[53:22] disconnected
[53:25] both they are very good for history and
[53:28] if you bear with me it will
[53:31] it will get clear as we go along amen
[53:37] my first scripture is in the book of
[53:40] luke
[53:40] chapter 24
[53:45] luke chapter 24.
[53:55] i'd like to read the first 12 verses
[53:59] and i'm also going to read from the book
[54:01] of ephesians chapter 5.
[54:04] luke 24 verse 1 to 12
[54:08] and then we shall go to the book of
[54:10] ephesians chapter five
[54:12] amen
[54:17] now upon the first day of the week
[54:21] very early in the morning they came onto
[54:24] the sepulcher
[54:26] bringing the spices which they had
[54:28] prepared
[54:30] and sat in others with them
[54:33] and they found the stone rolled away
[54:36] from the sepulcher
[54:38] and they entered in and found not
[54:41] the body of the lord jesus and it came
[54:44] to pass
[54:45] as they were much perplexed there about
[54:49] behold two men stood by them
[54:52] in shining garments and as they were
[54:55] afraid
[54:56] and bowed down their faces to the earth
[54:59] they said unto them
[55:01] why seek ye the living among the dead
[55:05] amen i think we need to answer that
[55:09] question again
[55:11] he is not here but is risen
[55:16] remember i will speak unto you when it
[55:19] was yet
[55:20] in galilee saying
[55:23] the son of man must be delivered into
[55:27] the hands of sinful men
[55:29] and be crucified and the third day
[55:32] rise again and they remembered his words
[55:36] and returned from the serpoca and towed
[55:40] all these things
[55:42] onto the eleven and to hold the rest
[55:45] it was mary magdalene and johanna and
[55:48] mary the mother of james
[55:51] and other women that were with them
[55:54] which
[55:54] told these things unto the apostles
[55:57] and their words seemed to them as i do
[56:00] tales
[56:01] and they believed them north then arose
[56:05] peter
[56:06] and ran onto the sepulcher and stooping
[56:10] down
[56:11] he beheld the linen clothes lit by
[56:13] themselves
[56:14] and departed wondering in himself
[56:18] at that which come to pass
[56:21] amen ephesians chapter five
[56:35] ephesians chapter 5 i'll read from verse
[56:42] 21.
[56:44] uh 2 verse 30
[56:47] 32
[56:51] submitting yourselves one to another in
[56:54] the fear of god
[56:56] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[56:59] husbands
[57:00] as unto the lord for the husband
[57:03] is the head of the wife even as christ
[57:07] is the head of the church and he
[57:10] is the savior of the body therefore
[57:13] as the church is subject unto christ
[57:17] so let the wives be to their own
[57:19] husbands
[57:20] in everything husbands
[57:24] love your wives even as christ also
[57:27] loved the church
[57:28] and gave himself for it that he might
[57:31] sanctify
[57:33] and cleanse it with a washing of water
[57:37] by the word that he might present it to
[57:40] himself
[57:42] a glorious church not having spot
[57:46] or wrinkle or any such thing
[57:50] but that it should be holy and without
[57:52] blemish
[57:54] so ought men to love their wives
[57:57] as their own bodies he that loveth
[58:00] his wife love it himself
[58:03] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[58:07] but nourisheth and cherisheth it
[58:10] even as the lord the church
[58:13] for we are members of his body
[58:16] of his flesh and of his bones
[58:20] for this cause shall a man leave his
[58:22] father
[58:23] a mother and shall be joined unto his
[58:26] wife
[58:27] and there too shall be one flesh
[58:30] this is a great mystery
[58:34] but i speak concerning christ and the
[58:37] church
[58:38] may the lord add his blessings to the
[58:41] reading of his holy word
[58:44] god bless you you may be seated
[58:51] this
[58:55] moment if the lord will be our help
[58:58] which i trust he will
[59:01] i would like to speak on
[59:04] for this easter a subject i called
[59:08] she is risen she
[59:11] is not here
[59:17] i'm mindful of the scripture that we
[59:19] read
[59:20] that the scripture did not exactly say
[59:23] she is risen
[59:25] she is not here the person who testified
[59:32] the angel who testified
[59:35] to those who were so concerned
[59:39] about the lord jesus christ did not use
[59:42] the word
[59:43] she is risen
[59:46] did not use the word she is not here
[59:50] the angel used the word he is
[59:54] risen he is not here
[59:59] but you see my use of she is
[1:00:02] and she is not here is not a sacrilege
[1:00:07] it is also the scripture
[1:00:11] and it is the hidden thought behind the
[1:00:14] statement
[1:00:15] of the angel because
[1:00:19] christ cannot be risen
[1:00:22] and his body remained in the grave
[1:00:27] did you catch that
[1:00:30] for there to be a personality the
[1:00:33] earth and the body must be together
[1:00:37] so if you are lying on the bed and your
[1:00:40] head
[1:00:41] raises the resin of your head
[1:00:44] raise your body and the head
[1:00:47] will not be able to move anywhere
[1:00:50] without
[1:00:51] the body
[1:00:54] even when the head eats the food do you
[1:00:57] know chewing
[1:00:58] and eating is from the edge
[1:01:02] you didn't catch that where do you eat
[1:01:06] from
[1:01:07] you use your mouth to eat where is your
[1:01:10] mouth located
[1:01:12] so am i speaking right eating
[1:01:16] is from your head but you see whatever
[1:01:19] you
[1:01:19] eat the destination it's your body
[1:01:23] until it gets to the body it does not do
[1:01:26] your entire being
[1:01:27] any good so these two
[1:01:31] these two units are connected together
[1:01:35] and you cannot they are inseparable
[1:01:38] connection
[1:01:39] until you see christ and his bride like
[1:01:41] that
[1:01:42] you will never be able to understand
[1:01:45] your life
[1:01:50] don't view christ's body as his you know
[1:01:56] his physical person
[1:02:00] in terms of redemption christ is the
[1:02:03] edge
[1:02:05] and you are the body
[1:02:08] whatever happens to the edge affects the
[1:02:11] body
[1:02:13] the edge may conceive many things to do
[1:02:16] but it is the body that actually
[1:02:18] implements it
[1:02:20] amen that is why the earth cannot move
[1:02:24] about
[1:02:25] without his body so if christ
[1:02:28] actually was risen then his body rose
[1:02:33] if christ was dead his body died
[1:02:37] if christ was buried his body was buried
[1:02:40] the prophet of the lord said christ took
[1:02:44] you
[1:02:44] in him to the cross of calvary so we
[1:02:47] were melt with him on the cross
[1:02:51] when it declared it is finished it was
[1:02:54] our statement
[1:02:55] that christ was echoing hallelujah
[1:03:00] because christ not has no other body
[1:03:03] than your body and mind
[1:03:05] now your friends you look at me amen
[1:03:08] what am i touching my head
[1:03:12] what am i touching are they just are
[1:03:14] they different
[1:03:16] do they share different complexion
[1:03:19] except i'm bleaching
[1:03:21] amen when you see people who are light
[1:03:25] all over your fanta color in their head
[1:03:28] and maybe coca-cola in their body
[1:03:31] something
[1:03:32] is wrong the body and the head usually
[1:03:35] share the same complexion
[1:03:37] because the body is recovered something
[1:03:39] it might look fresher than the one
[1:03:41] under the heat is that right but they
[1:03:44] are still the same complexion
[1:03:46] because the body and the edge are
[1:03:48] inseparable
[1:03:53] so and the prophet said christ went with
[1:03:56] his body to the cross of calvary
[1:04:00] he went with you inside of him so you
[1:04:03] were identified
[1:04:04] in his death you were identified with
[1:04:08] him
[1:04:08] in his burial and you've got to be
[1:04:11] identified with him
[1:04:13] in his resurrection
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:17] when christ rose and he said all power
[1:04:20] is given me
[1:04:22] oh man he was testifying of his church
[1:04:26] if christ has all the powers then the
[1:04:29] church
[1:04:29] has all the powers because whatever
[1:04:32] christ
[1:04:33] has all mine the inheritor of christ
[1:04:37] is his bride the bible said all that god
[1:04:40] was according to christ
[1:04:42] all that christ was he put into the
[1:04:45] church
[1:04:46] so this bride will be word of his words
[1:04:50] life of his life power of his power
[1:04:55] manifestation of his manifestation
[1:04:58] this bride will be him if you are
[1:05:01] looking for christ today
[1:05:02] you can only fight him in his body
[1:05:06] amen because his body on earth
[1:05:09] represents his physical presence
[1:05:12] and that is why what christ did this
[1:05:14] body will do
[1:05:16] and it will be so natural for them to do
[1:05:18] it
[1:05:19] they wouldn't have to struggle to do it
[1:05:22] that is why this
[1:05:23] body doesn't look for signs science
[1:05:26] follows this body
[1:05:27] because they are the believers and the
[1:05:30] scripture that spoke of them says these
[1:05:33] signs shall follow those that believe
[1:05:36] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:05:39] they shall take up deadly things which
[1:05:41] do not hurt them
[1:05:42] they will lay ants upon their sick and
[1:05:45] they will recover
[1:05:47] if christ their ex did it they will do
[1:05:49] it
[1:05:50] there is nothing that can stop that
[1:05:52] manifestation
[1:05:54] because it's a concluded program of god
[1:05:57] enjoy your inheritance this is why all
[1:06:01] you
[1:06:01] need to do is to come to the realization
[1:06:05] of who you are don't struggle to get
[1:06:08] power you're already in power
[1:06:12] did you hear me church don't walk up
[1:06:15] manifestations you already have it in
[1:06:17] you
[1:06:18] you cannot manifest christ for this
[1:06:22] hour you cannot but demonstrate the
[1:06:26] power of god
[1:06:27] in this hour it is your inheritance it
[1:06:30] is your buildup
[1:06:32] it is your chemistry it is your makeup
[1:06:35] don't look for it it's already in you
[1:06:38] come to who you are and you will do the
[1:06:42] greater works
[1:06:47] you love him this morning
[1:06:51] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:06:53] sun
[1:06:55] the prophet was describing this and he
[1:06:58] said the same word
[1:07:01] that spoke of the groom speaks of the
[1:07:04] bride
[1:07:06] so if the word spoke of the groom and
[1:07:09] said
[1:07:10] he is not here it is risen
[1:07:13] then i can on the authority of these
[1:07:15] statements that have matched
[1:07:17] and these statements of the prophet say
[1:07:20] she
[1:07:20] is not also here because the same watch
[1:07:24] that spoke
[1:07:24] of the groom speaks of the bride
[1:07:28] amen the eating thing behind that
[1:07:31] statement
[1:07:32] is that it was the bright that god had
[1:07:35] in mind
[1:07:36] this is why if you watch the easter
[1:07:39] the last easter the prophet celebrated
[1:07:43] it wasn't the easter of the resurrection
[1:07:46] of jesus christ
[1:07:49] he called it it is the rising of the sun
[1:07:53] in church he said i want this easter
[1:07:56] to mean more to you than any easter you
[1:07:59] have ever heard
[1:08:01] hallelujah because before that time
[1:08:05] we were celebrating historical easter
[1:08:09] but we must bring history to living
[1:08:11] tense
[1:08:12] we must bring history to present tense
[1:08:16] hallelujah there is that the prophet was
[1:08:19] celebrating
[1:08:20] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:08:22] sun was the easter
[1:08:24] of the bride not that of the bright
[1:08:27] groom
[1:08:28] that was why in that message he said the
[1:08:31] whole idea of redemption
[1:08:34] is what easter stands for and that
[1:08:36] redemption
[1:08:37] idea is between the e and the sheep
[1:08:41] hallelujah so in as much as we have
[1:08:44] observed this far
[1:08:46] that you know christ had risen christ
[1:08:48] has risen
[1:08:49] we must come to a point that the risen
[1:08:52] christ what did he rise for
[1:08:55] and the prophet was demonstrating it in
[1:08:58] various ways
[1:08:59] he took it back to the shift waving
[1:09:03] in the beginning in the old testament he
[1:09:05] said when
[1:09:06] a farmer plants his vineyard or his
[1:09:09] plantations his farms
[1:09:12] and nearing the time of harvest he will
[1:09:15] be looking for the first of that
[1:09:17] plantation that will mature
[1:09:19] the first of that plantation that we
[1:09:21] mature is avested
[1:09:23] in many cases not for eating but for a
[1:09:27] symbolic celebration
[1:09:29] amen because it's to be taken to the
[1:09:32] high priest
[1:09:32] or the priest to do what to do the feast
[1:09:36] of shiva waving
[1:09:38] which is a time to pray for the rest of
[1:09:40] the harvest
[1:09:41] and to celebrate in advance so faith
[1:09:44] has to be connected and to celebrate in
[1:09:47] advance
[1:09:48] the adverts of those ones that are yet
[1:09:51] to arrive
[1:09:52] with a message that just as this one
[1:09:54] became
[1:09:55] ripened the other ones will also come
[1:09:59] that is the feast of shiva waving
[1:10:01] hallelujah
[1:10:02] and the prophet of the lord said christ
[1:10:04] was our worship wave
[1:10:07] christ was the first that much watch it
[1:10:09] was the first one from among the dead
[1:10:12] it was the first one that came up
[1:10:14] signifying there will be more of christ
[1:10:18] there will be more of resurrection there
[1:10:20] will be more of manifestation
[1:10:23] he said this is the reason he said
[1:10:24] greater than this shall you do
[1:10:26] he said we aren't going to do anything
[1:10:28] greater than what he did
[1:10:30] but the right language is more of this
[1:10:34] in that it was just a single unit doing
[1:10:36] those things
[1:10:37] he's going to bring his body which is
[1:10:39] many members
[1:10:41] doing the same thing so where christ did
[1:10:44] one
[1:10:44] is many members and millions will do
[1:10:46] millions
[1:10:48] is taking place here is taking place
[1:10:50] there
[1:10:51] if the first ship that was with was
[1:10:53] accepted
[1:10:54] is a sign that more will come so the
[1:10:57] devil cannot stop it
[1:10:59] sickness cannot stop it death cannot
[1:11:02] stop
[1:11:03] it antichrist program cannot stop it
[1:11:06] don't disturb yourself with those things
[1:11:08] they are not powerful enough
[1:11:10] to stand in the way of god because this
[1:11:13] is god's program
[1:11:15] god will have a blight and that blood
[1:11:18] will be without spots
[1:11:20] it will be without wrinkle
[1:11:23] it will be holiness unto the lord
[1:11:25] because the first place was holy
[1:11:27] the first groom was holy it was pure
[1:11:31] amen he said the prince of this world
[1:11:34] came to me
[1:11:35] and find no fault satan find no fault
[1:11:39] his agents will find no fault the
[1:11:41] prophet said this end time bride
[1:11:44] the body of that groom will be a sinless
[1:11:47] virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:11:50] because the righteousness of their
[1:11:52] bridegroom is their covering
[1:11:55] oh glory to god
[1:11:59] when you know these things you will know
[1:12:01] christianity is a rest
[1:12:04] how many are resting it is your season
[1:12:08] and him walking
[1:12:10] hallelujah
[1:12:16] i feel good this morning and we haven't
[1:12:19] even started
[1:12:21] but let's feel good about these
[1:12:22] blessings it's good for a background
[1:12:25] i'm saying that which applies to him
[1:12:28] applies to you
[1:12:30] amen this is why when the blood appears
[1:12:34] which is you and i
[1:12:35] i'm not talking of the future bright
[1:12:37] that bride is already here
[1:12:39] many the prophet said the problem of man
[1:12:41] is that they will thank god for what is
[1:12:43] done
[1:12:44] looking forward to what he will do
[1:12:46] ignoring what he
[1:12:48] is doing amen the perfect bread has got
[1:12:51] to be now
[1:12:52] now you are talking of the rapture
[1:12:54] rapture cannot come without perfection
[1:12:56] of the bride
[1:12:58] and what it takes to bring perfection to
[1:13:00] that bread has been given
[1:13:04] oh glory to god the prophet said ezekiel
[1:13:08] saw us in prophecy
[1:13:10] amen and he saw a valley full of dry
[1:13:14] bones
[1:13:15] it might have been fulfilled in the life
[1:13:17] of israel in one way
[1:13:18] amen because ezekiel lucia they were
[1:13:21] saying the same thing
[1:13:22] you know bringing revival after two days
[1:13:25] after 2000 years
[1:13:26] amen there will be you know there will
[1:13:29] be a nation of israel again
[1:13:30] which by the grace of god we have seen
[1:13:33] but the reviewer for the hour
[1:13:35] brought ezekiel prophecy to the bride of
[1:13:37] jesus christ
[1:13:41] and the ezekiel was asked god showed him
[1:13:45] amen the valley full of dry bones
[1:13:48] and then he was asked amen can these
[1:13:51] bones live
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:55] in other words will there be another
[1:13:57] revival
[1:13:59] will there be another shake amen after
[1:14:03] such a dryness
[1:14:04] isn't this the age of dryness isn't this
[1:14:08] the age of apostasy
[1:14:10] isn't this the edge of famine isn't this
[1:14:13] the edge of thick darkness
[1:14:14] can these bones live can there be
[1:14:18] another revival
[1:14:20] will there be a revival of the just will
[1:14:23] there be a manifestation
[1:14:26] of him who wants to walk on the streets
[1:14:28] of jerusalem
[1:14:30] will christ be lifted out of history
[1:14:33] oh man and ezekiel said i don't know
[1:14:38] only god know it hallelujah
[1:14:42] you see but the revival of that bones is
[1:14:45] not up in heaven
[1:14:47] he's right here on earth god
[1:14:50] was going to use a prophet amen and in
[1:14:53] that vision
[1:14:54] ezekiel types the prophets oh
[1:14:58] church are you here
[1:15:01] god did not speak directly to those
[1:15:03] bones
[1:15:04] are you here church he told the prophets
[1:15:07] to prophesy
[1:15:09] is the ezekiel professor then the
[1:15:12] prophet called our attention he said it
[1:15:14] takes the prophet to prophesy
[1:15:17] it takes the prophecy of the prophet to
[1:15:20] bring life
[1:15:21] to the dead bones for the dry bones
[1:15:24] to put flesh on them to put senior on
[1:15:27] them
[1:15:28] to put energy on them to put life
[1:15:31] in them hallelujah for them to rise up
[1:15:35] like a mighty hermit oh
[1:15:38] gosh there will be another revival
[1:15:42] there will be a revival of the just
[1:15:45] missing limbs are going to be restored

[1:15:52] have need of rain i'm going to give him
[1:15:55] it is just here the lord the needs of
[1:15:58] the blood will be met among the bride
[1:16:00] it is just here the lord and even right
[1:16:04] now
[1:16:05] because another type of us is ruth
[1:16:08] that in this hour before the great
[1:16:11] manifestation
[1:16:13] which the greatest of manifestation of
[1:16:16] ruth
[1:16:16] was to reproduce the savior on two feet
[1:16:20] before that manifestation root was given
[1:16:24] and full on purpose
[1:16:26] ruth was not abandoned those and full
[1:16:29] will solidify your faith
[1:16:32] those untruthful will give you a quick
[1:16:34] name
[1:16:35] that is why right now engineers are

[1:26:24] amen the people were told to believe god
[1:26:28] after the finish preaching after the man
[1:26:31] of god
[1:26:32] finished preaching after i did he said
[1:26:34] he just went to consolidate
[1:26:36] amen and they consolidated not quite
[1:26:39] long
[1:26:40] and he came back again and said brother
[1:26:42] they'll come and pray for the people
[1:26:46] then i said okay i went behind the
[1:26:49] pulpit
[1:26:52] the people who wanted to pray as such to
[1:26:54] the altar there were many
[1:26:57] i realized it's going to be impossible
[1:26:59] for us to have
[1:27:00] a prayer line like that and i want a
[1:27:03] harmony of the spirit so i said lord
[1:27:05] what do we do
[1:27:07] then the lord spoke to me he said tell
[1:27:09] them to lay hands upon each other
[1:27:13] oh so that took away every discordance
[1:27:17] amen tell them to let somebody was
[1:27:20] telling me later
[1:27:22] that when i said that oh he felt it
[1:27:24] we're coming
[1:27:25] grace you know a welcoming spirit just
[1:27:28] felt so good
[1:27:29] because he felt that that was what we
[1:27:31] needed
[1:27:33] as a le i said how many of you believe
[1:27:37] i said now you don't need my hands or
[1:27:39] the hands of any other person
[1:27:41] as much thinking is better than your own
[1:27:45] hands
[1:27:46] i said the provision the the the
[1:27:50] the the requirement for hans lane is if
[1:27:53] you believe
[1:27:54] then i gave them a testimony of a sister
[1:27:58] who fed led to pray for another sister
[1:28:02] who was by her side and when that
[1:28:04] leadership wouldn't leave
[1:28:06] her she requested of the sister and yet
[1:28:08] there was a prayer line going on
[1:28:10] she requested of a sister can i please
[1:28:13] pray for you i'm just
[1:28:14] feeling that hush in my heart and the
[1:28:17] sister submitted
[1:28:18] and the other sister laid upon this
[1:28:21] sister
[1:28:22] amen we've got to be in harmony of the
[1:28:26] spirit
[1:28:28] and when ill she let and upon that
[1:28:31] sister
[1:28:32] that condition disappeared
[1:28:35] but she never knew she came to the
[1:28:38] prayer line anyhow
[1:28:39] and when she got to the prayer line and
[1:28:42] she got to the prophet
[1:28:43] the prophet was ready to pray says the
[1:28:45] start you don't have anything
[1:28:47] any sickness again on that discernment
[1:28:50] and the prophet was looking around and
[1:28:52] say yeah

[1:28:56] while ago
[1:28:58] this sister
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:02] he said sister stand up you felt a
[1:29:04] leadership that was god speaking to your
[1:29:06] heart
[1:29:07] to pray for this sister and you yield it
[1:29:11] to the spirit call
[1:29:12] he said let me turn to this sister he
[1:29:14] said the moment she led and then prayed
[1:29:16] for you
[1:29:17] your sickness disappeared
[1:29:20] then brother brown said you don't need
[1:29:23] my prayer
[1:29:24] he just asked a blessing and he told her
[1:29:27] to go
[1:29:28] how do you think about that amen
[1:29:31] and i said if you believe lay ends on
[1:29:34] one another
[1:29:35] and they led ants on each other and
[1:29:38] there was a brother in there
[1:29:40] who are the problem with this tricycle
[1:29:43] and the part
[1:29:44] that was going to be considered for his
[1:29:47] economy
[1:29:48] is great then he said
[1:29:51] you know he said i don't know what to do
[1:29:53] is that now they are laying hands upon
[1:29:55] me but this is my need and i said
[1:29:57] raise your request before the lord as
[1:30:00] you lay hands upon each other
[1:30:02] and i pray over you and when we finish
[1:30:05] that
[1:30:06] prayer amen
[1:30:10] he went to the tri-cycle the church
[1:30:12] dismissed
[1:30:13] he went to the tricycle he tried to
[1:30:16] start
[1:30:16] the engine it was expecting the symptoms
[1:30:19] the symptoms never came
[1:30:21] the things that appear he said it just
[1:30:25] mattered the words the lord
[1:30:26] have been prayed for and i believe the
[1:30:28] prayer of your servant
[1:30:30] do something then for a testimony to
[1:30:33] clear
[1:30:34] his doubt he went to the mechanic the
[1:30:36] next day
[1:30:37] and said that thing helped me check and
[1:30:40] the guy said
[1:30:42] what did you do what happened to this he
[1:30:45] said this thing is now okay you don't
[1:30:48] need to replace it any longer
[1:30:50] this thing is now okay the brother ran
[1:30:53] back to church the next day
[1:30:55] is that i haven't read all testimony
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:00] church is still the same god if you
[1:31:03] could replace a carburetor
[1:31:06] and replace whatever it was alternator
[1:31:09] in that tricycle it can replace jeans
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:15] he can replace anything he's still in
[1:31:18] that same business
[1:31:20] then another minister who have not been
[1:31:23] able to function for 10 months
[1:31:26] it became invalid he said ahead of the
[1:31:29] meetings
[1:31:30] i struggled to come he said as the
[1:31:32] people i stay with i'm almost like a
[1:31:34] liability to them
[1:31:36] he said but after that prayer i got up
[1:31:39] i danced i wrote i said
[1:31:43] he said that the devil told me the devil
[1:31:45] told me
[1:31:46] it is momentary it is momentary he said
[1:31:49] okay don't worry
[1:31:50] whether you think is momentary or not is
[1:31:52] spoke back to the devil
[1:31:54] is that this blessing of mine you aren't
[1:31:56] going to take it from me
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:01] if you say it is momentary i haven't
[1:32:04] done it in 10 months
[1:32:06] and i could do it now whether momentary
[1:32:09] or not
[1:32:09] i accept my healing
[1:32:14] then he went that night to go and lay
[1:32:17] down
[1:32:17] he said i went that night to lay down
[1:32:19] and in the morning
[1:32:21] because he always could not get up by
[1:32:23] himself they have to support him
[1:32:25] and things he said in the morning when
[1:32:27] he woke up
[1:32:28] the thing come back he said you see that
[1:32:30] is momentary now he said it's a lie
[1:32:33] then he said he just felt that that's
[1:32:35] such that good feeling
[1:32:37] he raised up he got up
[1:32:40] he bounced and he said since that time
[1:32:43] i have been bouncing
[1:32:47] only believe all things
[1:32:55] what do they accept the prophecy of the
[1:32:58] prophets
[1:33:03] you love him church
[1:33:06] he said hezekiah will this bulls leave
[1:33:10] it's a down rest ah if i know if i'm the
[1:33:14] one who knows
[1:33:15] then i'm gonna put my word in your mouth
[1:33:17] he says he can
[1:33:18] speak prophesy to these bones
[1:33:22] he gave him what to say and ezekiel
[1:33:25] began to say
[1:33:26] and the bones began to vibrate
[1:33:32] are your bones vibrating
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:35] hallelujah the bones began to vibrate
[1:33:39] and by the spoken word flesh came
[1:33:43] hogging to hogan sinew came
[1:33:46] the organs came the blood came the water
[1:33:49] came
[1:33:50] and reformed the the bones began to form
[1:33:53] until it formed to a man and those bones
[1:33:56] rise up
[1:33:57] by the prophecy of the prophet
[1:34:01] they rose up and ezekiel said i saw a
[1:34:04] mighty heaven
[1:34:05] this church is a mighty heaven
[1:34:09] amen what are we to do what is our
[1:34:12] commission
[1:34:13] the prophet said satan's army are
[1:34:15] commissioned
[1:34:16] to put sicknesses and affliction in our
[1:34:19] bodies
[1:34:20] but god's army are under commission to
[1:34:23] do what
[1:34:24] to cast them out
[1:34:27] we shall fulfill our commission we will
[1:34:30] cast them out
[1:34:32] the prophet said the list of the
[1:34:34] believers
[1:34:36] among us this morning has got the devil
[1:34:38] under his face
[1:34:40] hey hey hey okay let me prove it to you
[1:34:45] if you imagine this morning that you are
[1:34:48] not
[1:34:48] the hair if you imagine this money that
[1:34:52] you are not the stomach
[1:34:53] if you imagine this morning that you are
[1:34:55] not a palm
[1:34:57] if you think you are the soul of the
[1:34:59] feet of christ
[1:35:01] amen just think about that are you the
[1:35:04] soul
[1:35:05] where is the ground still under the soul
[1:35:12] did you get it can this ground rise
[1:35:15] above your soul
[1:35:17] did you guess it so whatever you stamp
[1:35:20] it's under you when the devil stumped
[1:35:24] down the devil
[1:35:26] even if you are the soul you are still
[1:35:28] on top of the
[1:35:29] devil so i said this morning
[1:35:33] the list of the believers has got the
[1:35:36] devil
[1:35:37] under him as god's sicknesses
[1:35:40] disease and affliction under them
[1:35:43] don't accept the package return to the
[1:35:47] sender
[1:35:48] because it is your heritage to condemn
[1:35:51] every tongue
[1:35:52] that speaks against you sons and
[1:35:55] daughters of god
[1:35:56] rise up and manifest for who you are
[1:36:02] [Applause]
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:06] hallelujah we are no longer dead
[1:36:10] we are no longer a slave to sin amen
[1:36:15] once upon a time we were under him and
[1:36:18] he was running us up and down
[1:36:20] as he wished and as a desire but that
[1:36:23] day on calvary
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:29] what a day on calvary what a glorious
[1:36:32] day it was
[1:36:34] we are in our hedge pronounce it is
[1:36:36] finished
[1:36:38] and the body agrees with it because
[1:36:40] wherever the head goes
[1:36:42] the body follows hallelujah
[1:36:46] if the head entire place and his body
[1:36:49] cannot go
[1:36:50] what does the boy head do he goes back
[1:36:56] did you catch that that's a revelation
[1:36:59] to using
[1:37:00] meaning that there will never be a place
[1:37:03] the head will get you
[1:37:05] that his body will never be there
[1:37:08] christ is the head yeah and you are the
[1:37:12] body
[1:37:13] so whatever ground christ has claimed
[1:37:16] it is your inheritance you claim it with
[1:37:19] him
[1:37:20] when he said it is finished that was
[1:37:23] meant for you
[1:37:24] that was why the graves couldn't hold
[1:37:32] abraham
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:39] three things took place in three
[1:37:42] different dimensions
[1:37:44] you want to hear it it will help you to
[1:37:46] hear it
[1:37:48] in heaven on earth and underneath
[1:37:52] come on george let's start from under
[1:37:56] the moment he said it is finished the
[1:37:59] bible said the earthquake
[1:38:02] and the graves of the saints not the
[1:38:04] grave of everybody
[1:38:06] the grave of his own body
[1:38:13] is coming for his own
[1:38:19] the graves of his own body were opened
[1:38:23] open for what preparatory to
[1:38:26] resurrection
[1:38:29] the reason they were held down was
[1:38:32] because
[1:38:33] the author of death the one who was the
[1:38:36] king of
[1:38:37] death was responsible
[1:38:40] for this prescription that produced
[1:38:42] their physical bodies
[1:38:45] it produced the physical body to die
[1:38:49] this is why you will never need these
[1:38:51] bodies
[1:38:53] in eternity
[1:38:56] whatever happens to this body don't care
[1:39:00] there will be no blind mind
[1:39:03] no deaf man no leprous man
[1:39:08] no invalid in the hallelujah square
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:16] it will be a perfect body
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:20] spoken into existence not by sex
[1:39:24] god is going to bypass sex to reproduce
[1:39:27] you
[1:39:28] back that is why you will never die
[1:39:32] and you will never ever grow old
[1:39:38] this body grows old as a symptom of
[1:39:41] death
[1:39:42] so when you are celebrating birth day
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:45] say i'm getting older you actually
[1:39:47] celebrating death
[1:39:48] when you come to eternity it will be one
[1:39:51] long birthday
[1:39:56] it will just be one day amen
[1:40:00] are we together so
[1:40:03] when the saints died from genesis
[1:40:08] to malachi even to the coming of christ
[1:40:11] before the cross certain exercises
[1:40:14] authority
[1:40:15] over their bodies
[1:40:20] because he was responsible he had a
[1:40:23] contribution
[1:40:24] in the way that body was formed
[1:40:27] did you get that that is why sisters
[1:40:30] the prophet said
[1:40:33] don't glory in this your healthy body
[1:40:36] and don't be self-conscious and admiring
[1:40:40] your beauty
[1:40:41] because the shape you had married was
[1:40:44] inspired and given to you by satan
[1:40:48] and that is why if you don't meet god
[1:40:52] you will be more an instrument that will
[1:40:54] send more souls to earth
[1:40:56] than even bear then even be a joint
[1:41:01] amen so this is why you must come to
[1:41:04] christ
[1:41:05] and make no delay you see what is
[1:41:07] polluting the edge today
[1:41:09] it is all about sex is that right church
[1:41:14] you see it on the billboards you see it
[1:41:17] everywhere
[1:41:18] you see it in conversations at least
[1:41:21] they talk so freely
[1:41:23] on vulgar things today they are they are
[1:41:26] crossing the boundary
[1:41:27] they don't really feel is a big deal and
[1:41:30] they are promoting it you don't even
[1:41:32] have to know the person
[1:41:34] if that's what he wants if that's what
[1:41:35] you want you can go for a casual outing
[1:41:38] and never see yourself again let me tell
[1:41:41] you
[1:41:42] this world will bomb more than sudo
[1:41:47] is a satan's even
[1:41:50] every programs even for teenagers
[1:41:54] are becoming sexual
[1:42:00] watch what your children feed on we know
[1:42:03] the devil is running ring around us
[1:42:06] they hardly can do the assignments do
[1:42:07] their homework do the education without
[1:42:10] internet again without form without high
[1:42:13] pass
[1:42:14] but you've got to be alive as a parent
[1:42:17] i'm telling you
[1:42:18] because beyond that they also want some
[1:42:20] entertainment
[1:42:21] and the way they get entertainment is by
[1:42:24] their peers
[1:42:25] have you watched greenwich have you
[1:42:26] watched this one have you watched
[1:42:27] friends forever
[1:42:28] have you watched those nonsenses they
[1:42:31] don't need it
[1:42:33] the prophet said is going to blast their
[1:42:35] minds before they even get started
[1:42:38] that is why sin must be killed from its
[1:42:40] infancy
[1:42:43] this is why joshua never spared the
[1:42:46] children of the amalekites
[1:42:48] jebusites as babies as they are oh man
[1:42:51] is that they don't even have teach yet
[1:42:54] but the prophet said remember when they
[1:42:55] grow up
[1:42:56] they will be like their daddies
[1:42:59] kill sin before it has a chance
[1:43:05] and if you are talking your head in such
[1:43:07] evil to pornography you better repent
[1:43:10] because you are destroying your value
[1:43:13] you are destroying your conscience
[1:43:15] you have destroyed your morality you are
[1:43:17] destroying your spirituality
[1:43:19] you haven't destroyed your psychology
[1:43:21] everything is all losses are no gain
[1:43:25] repence
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:31] hallelujah so satan holds that key
[1:43:36] the day you hit thereof that day you
[1:43:40] die hallelujah so immature
[1:43:43] amen he has the key of death and that
[1:43:46] was why
[1:43:47] he was so bold listen to me church
[1:43:51] when moses died
[1:43:55] god was going to preserve that body amen
[1:43:59] satan was so bulged to come and confront
[1:44:02] the messengers of god
[1:44:04] i said my friend i i own that body
[1:44:08] i'm quoting your bible i'm quoting the
[1:44:11] scripture
[1:44:13] hallelujah he said it was disputed about
[1:44:16] the body of moses
[1:44:18] why was it disputing moses was a saint
[1:44:21] amen but by the power of death satan has
[1:44:24] a right
[1:44:25] to the dead body common church
[1:44:30] and he's got a right to lock them up
[1:44:33] and god cannot refuse him that right
[1:44:37] you know why because the real penalty
[1:44:40] for sin
[1:44:42] the price for it has not been paid
[1:44:46] the blood of god's bulls and lambs are
[1:44:49] only a cover
[1:44:50] they cannot actually remit
[1:44:53] they cannot restore you to your position
[1:44:56] so why that was waiting
[1:45:00] and satan knows is right he said give me
[1:45:02] that body
[1:45:03] god said no i take an exception
[1:45:08] yes sir i need this one
[1:45:11] i take an exception this is why he
[1:45:14] couldn't dis
[1:45:14] he couldn't dispute the body of elijah
[1:45:16] because he didn't die
[1:45:18] did you catch that it didn't dispute the
[1:45:21] body of enoch because he didn't die
[1:45:23] they went straight but if they died it
[1:45:26] will come
[1:45:26] like he came for moses because until
[1:45:30] that time
[1:45:30] he owes the power of death he will tell
[1:45:33] you i killed them
[1:45:35] they are my spoils if an hunter goes for
[1:45:38] hunting
[1:45:39] and he kills the game whoson is it
[1:45:42] church answer me is a practical simple
[1:45:45] exercise
[1:45:50] so one of the things god must take is
[1:45:53] the powers of death from satan
[1:45:56] if he's going to have a right unto his
[1:45:59] own people
[1:46:00] the only way satan would not be able to
[1:46:02] have had the right
[1:46:03] was if they never died so enoch went he
[1:46:06] didn't fight
[1:46:08] elijah went he didn't fight but when
[1:46:10] moses went
[1:46:11] and god wanted to keep the body he said
[1:46:13] no
[1:46:15] but you see the master must prove
[1:46:17] himself
[1:46:18] he said let me tell you even though you
[1:46:21] have that power i take exception to this
[1:46:25] no this one has a work to do
[1:46:28] so you got to leave him for me he said
[1:46:30] no then the bible said
[1:46:32] while disputing and contending micah did
[1:46:36] not bring a railing accusation
[1:46:38] ah church can we learn from that can we
[1:46:41] learn from that
[1:46:42] no matter no matter what a level of
[1:46:46] dispute or misunderstanding it gets
[1:46:48] don't use bad language
[1:46:51] did you hear me don't use unkind words
[1:46:55] don't use vulgar languages it does not
[1:46:58] belong to christians
[1:47:02] it is the unbeliever that abuses it is
[1:47:05] the unbeliever that curses
[1:47:07] amen michael never used foul language
[1:47:12] he said he never brought a railing
[1:47:14] accusation
[1:47:15] don't get under pressure to use wrong
[1:47:18] languages
[1:47:19] and you say let me tell you when you are
[1:47:21] converted those things eases out
[1:47:25] this is like christianity life is not a
[1:47:27] struggle
[1:47:28] you hear brother to brother having a
[1:47:31] conversation around the world
[1:47:32] and the next thing you a devil you are a
[1:47:35] serpent
[1:47:37] you are a liar you have this and that
[1:47:39] don't bring railing
[1:47:41] accusation even michael the arc anger
[1:47:44] never brought it on satan
[1:47:46] as satanic as he is not to talk upon
[1:47:49] your brother
[1:47:53] but your language will never be right
[1:47:56] until you are converted
[1:48:00] this is why the prophet said if you come
[1:48:02] if you become
[1:48:03] bitter about a misunderstanding he said
[1:48:06] you need the altar
[1:48:07] he said i never disagree with people
[1:48:10] except on the basis of the better
[1:48:12] enlightenment of the world
[1:48:14] and if it is on enlightenment of the
[1:48:16] world who can enlighten
[1:48:18] a man better it is god meaning what i
[1:48:21] need to do is to create the right
[1:48:23] atmosphere
[1:48:24] for god to come on the scene either help
[1:48:26] my brother or help me
[1:48:28] don't ever get on the bad end it is not
[1:48:31] christianity
[1:48:37] hallelujah so he held them
[1:48:40] under the powers of death abraham
[1:48:44] and all the rest where else that when
[1:48:46] jesus declared it is finished
[1:48:49] the grave quickened quit
[1:48:52] what happened the graves were opened by
[1:48:56] preparation for what resurrection the
[1:48:59] grace that have been opened
[1:49:01] amen the occupants of the grave are
[1:49:04] under the captivity of the devil
[1:49:06] the only thing god disagree
[1:49:10] is to put his own in the common prison
[1:49:12] house of death
[1:49:14] they must stay in the vip section
[1:49:17] that is the paradise that then was you
[1:49:20] know in all these correctional centers
[1:49:22] there are vip
[1:49:23] sections so they put all the saints in
[1:49:26] the vip section
[1:49:27] so christ was interested in that key
[1:49:31] because his own we are under captivity
[1:49:34] and luck of that key so right underneath
[1:49:38] christ went down
[1:49:43] he said i'm here satan where's the key
[1:49:48] hang me over the key he said which key
[1:49:52] you think i come here for joke satan
[1:49:55] said wait let me
[1:49:56] share testimony with you when i killed
[1:49:59] abel
[1:49:59] i thought i got you but i missed it then
[1:50:03] i killed abraham i killed this i killed
[1:50:06] that i killed isaac
[1:50:07] i killed a zika even to malachi the last
[1:50:09] prophet i thought you were the one
[1:50:11] but now i'm happy at last you are here

[1:55:12] conqueror conquered
[1:55:13] and he gave you the trophy so you were
[1:55:16] the one
[1:55:17] who sent jesus to go and fight satan
[1:55:21] to defeat death on the cross of calvary
[1:55:25] he was running your parents and when he
[1:55:27] had a victory
[1:55:29] he handed it over to you you are more
[1:55:32] than conquerors
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:40] hallelujah a wonderful insight will be
[1:55:42] for you
[1:55:44] it will be a resurrection of everything
[1:55:47] that the winters of life had killed a
[1:55:50] resurrection of everything
[1:55:52] that the winters of life are frozen
[1:55:55] anything
[1:55:56] dead anything frozen must receive life
[1:55:59] must thought out by the heat of the holy
[1:56:02] spirit
[1:56:04] because you must be the better for it in
[1:56:06] the name of jesus christ
[1:56:08] that's my prophecy for your lives
[1:56:15] hallelujah you love him
[1:56:19] then on the earth we have started from
[1:56:22] under
[1:56:23] let's come up on the head the bible says
[1:56:28] the veil of the temple did was
[1:56:32] rented into two and the renting
[1:56:35] was from top to the bottom
[1:56:39] is that right church from top to the
[1:56:42] bottom
[1:56:43] not from bottom up top to the bottom
[1:56:46] to let you know it was god who rented it
[1:56:53] hallelujah and what which veil was this
[1:56:58] it was the veil that separated the
[1:57:00] oldest of the holies
[1:57:03] from the middle court the outer court
[1:57:06] has no veil
[1:57:07] amen the middle court is
[1:57:10] it's a it's a shaded place amen
[1:57:13] but the oldest of the holy's was
[1:57:15] separated
[1:57:16] from all the courts by the veil
[1:57:20] and what is in the oldest of the holies
[1:57:23] the act of the covenant with that manner
[1:57:26] that can never decay
[1:57:27] inside and with cherubims on top of the
[1:57:31] heart
[1:57:31] covering signifying
[1:57:35] what christ did in hidden after men fell
[1:57:38] in mountain cherubims to gather to guide
[1:57:41] the part of the tree of life
[1:57:43] that tree of life is that undecable
[1:57:46] manner
[1:57:46] it is the lord jesus christ it is a
[1:57:49] revealed word
[1:57:50] it is the total revelation
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:56] and when men fell god mounted these
[1:57:59] cherubims
[1:58:00] with flaming swords to do what
[1:58:04] to guard god's departs so that man
[1:58:07] without proposition for his sin will not
[1:58:10] come back to eat
[1:58:12] life
[1:58:16] and eat life and become a rank devious
[1:58:19] sinner
[1:58:21] it will pollute it amen
[1:58:25] this reveal what this blessing is for
[1:58:28] sinners who are ready to repent
[1:58:31] if you bypass calvary to come and eat of
[1:58:34] the tree of life
[1:58:35] you will become an intellectual giant
[1:58:38] and you'll be a liability to the gospel
[1:58:41] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:58:44] the knowledge of the truth
[1:58:46] a make believer you will be because you
[1:58:49] will say amen to the world
[1:58:51] amen but you will never live the life of
[1:58:53] the wedge
[1:58:54] god does not want the word alone he
[1:58:57] wanted life by the spirit
[1:58:59] that is why apostle paul said the gospel
[1:59:02] was not preached to you
[1:59:03] only in watch but in the demonstration
[1:59:06] of the spirits
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:12] we are not sweet talker we carry
[1:59:15] life whatever we testify to you will see
[1:59:19] it in our lives
[1:59:20] if our life cannot produce it no work
[1:59:23] done
[1:59:24] come on church
[1:59:29] so but that day when the veil of the
[1:59:32] temple rented
[1:59:34] those cherubims that were guiding the
[1:59:37] part of the tree of life
[1:59:39] they felt jobless
[1:59:42] they looked at themselves what we are
[1:59:45] guiding
[1:59:47] by the symbol of the temple has been
[1:59:49] opened
[1:59:50] by the one who employed us to guard so
[1:59:54] we have lost
[1:59:54] our job nothing to guide again
[1:59:58] and i can hear god speak to them no sir
[2:00:01] you haven't lost your job i am changing
[2:00:04] your job description
[2:00:08] will you accept the change
[2:00:11] and allow the cherubims to now walk on
[2:00:14] you
[2:00:15] is that before now i told you to chase
[2:00:17] them away
[2:00:19] but from today that's the uncovering
[2:00:23] with that same flaming sword go after
[2:00:26] the ones
[2:00:27] that you have chased away go after these
[2:00:30] brothers
[2:00:31] go after the sisters they are my body
[2:00:34] use the same sword
[2:00:35] to chase them inside
[2:00:40] the prophet said that is why in every
[2:00:43] service
[2:00:44] in one of the messages of influence the
[2:00:46] cherubims must be around
[2:00:48] and he gave us the scripture he said the
[2:00:51] angels of god
[2:00:52] encompass most of you who are
[2:00:55] always afraid use that scripture only
[2:00:58] for the night
[2:01:01] when you want to sleep he said let angel
[2:01:03] in capron department no sir
[2:01:05] it's a 24 hour scripture
[2:01:09] as we are here now that scripture is
[2:01:12] fulfilling
[2:01:13] how many fear the lord how many worship
[2:01:16] the lord
[2:01:17] how many are god's children angels of
[2:01:20] god and camp
[2:01:21] round about don't be afraid
[2:01:26] in the morning don't be afraid in the
[2:01:29] afternoon
[2:01:30] don't be afraid at night angels are
[2:01:33] watching
[2:01:35] over you when we go out when we come in
[2:01:39] in the here on the road in the sea
[2:01:42] on the rail under the water by the
[2:01:45] submarine
[2:01:46] angels are watching up because
[2:01:49] angels of god encompass
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:56] when you know that you won't misbehave
[2:01:59] you won't embarrass the sight of the
[2:02:01] angels
[2:02:02] you won't want them to see filth you
[2:02:05] will do the right thing
[2:02:07] and right now here they are here the
[2:02:10] prophet said you may not see them
[2:02:12] but if you end the spirit you can feel
[2:02:14] their church
[2:02:16] this is why some of you are shouting him
[2:02:18] and this is why some of you got her
[2:02:20] this is where some of you are raising
[2:02:22] your hands what is that
[2:02:24] it is the talk of the angels he said you
[2:02:27] don't see them
[2:02:28] but you can feel their presence making
[2:02:31] you say amen
[2:02:32] making you rejoice at the world making
[2:02:35] your own god
[2:02:36] exorbitant expressions it is the charge
[2:02:39] of god's angel
[2:02:45] do you now realize why this
[2:02:48] end time cherubim was knighted with a
[2:02:52] sword
[2:02:53] aha aha
[2:02:57] he got that there are four
[2:03:00] living creatures is that right
[2:03:04] john saw them as living creatures
[2:03:06] ezekiel saw them as cherubims
[2:03:09] come on church and there are four of
[2:03:12] them
[2:03:13] with the face of a lion with the face of
[2:03:15] an hogs
[2:03:16] with the face of a man and with the face
[2:03:18] of an eagle
[2:03:20] these four are the closest to the throne
[2:03:23] they are the gods of the messengers
[2:03:25] after them is the 24 elders and so on
[2:03:28] and so forth
[2:03:29] so they are closer to the truth to see
[2:03:32] what is going on in the throne
[2:03:34] more than any being
[2:03:39] so they are the custodians of the tree
[2:03:43] of life are you catching it
[2:03:47] now in these last days we have the
[2:03:49] cherubims with the face of an eagle
[2:03:52] and that anointing came upon a man who
[2:03:56] found favor before god and we call him
[2:03:58] william braham
[2:04:00] i am not ashamed of the prophet
[2:04:04] whose prophecy we quicken dry bones
[2:04:07] [Applause]
[2:04:09] hallelujah it was his prophecy
[2:04:13] in more than 1000 messages that is
[2:04:16] quickening
[2:04:18] our dry bones putting flesh giving us
[2:04:21] identity
[2:04:22] and that message is going to raise us up
[2:04:25] as a mighty army to manifest
[2:04:28] for his glory is going to give us
[2:04:32] the revival of the just
[2:04:41] when they revealed what when the seven
[2:04:43] seals
[2:04:44] when the entire bible was to be opened
[2:04:50] because that is the tree of life
[2:04:52] hallelujah
[2:04:54] god told this cherubim in person
[2:04:58] to come to a mountain
[2:05:01] by the grace of god i visited that
[2:05:03] mountain with my wife
[2:05:06] it still has its allowedness for those
[2:05:08] who are believers
[2:05:10] amen because these are memorials that we
[2:05:13] never fade
[2:05:17] and he went on that mountain
[2:05:21] and he started praying instead because
[2:05:24] he didn't know why god told him to come
[2:05:26] there
[2:05:28] look friends this gospel costs the
[2:05:31] prophet of god a lot
[2:05:34] did you hear me church it cost him
[2:05:38] so much things god could have told him
[2:05:42] just in his house
[2:05:43] he would tell him go to a mountain we
[2:05:46] traveled from his house in arizona
[2:05:48] to mount sunset mountain it was more
[2:05:51] than three hours
[2:05:54] and god we ask his prophet go to that
[2:05:56] place until you get there i can't speak
[2:05:58] to you
[2:05:59] and the encounter might not be more less
[2:06:01] than 30 minutes
[2:06:02] and then we finish and drive three hours
[2:06:05] or four hours back again
[2:06:08] we drove in the solid suv we didn't get
[2:06:11] there until
[2:06:12] over three hours
[2:06:16] so about seven hours back and forth just
[2:06:19] to get a message for you
[2:06:21] come on church and somebody a backslider
[2:06:25] will sit somewhere
[2:06:28] and be condemning the message
[2:06:32] pity them
[2:06:36] because great will be their their
[2:06:39] punishment preaching them
[2:06:41] oh man and while he was praying on that
[2:06:45] sort of mountain
[2:06:45] that was closer to his house while he
[2:06:48] was praying all of a sudden
[2:06:50] he felt something in his arm boom
[2:06:54] and he had a loud voice as he beheld the
[2:06:57] king's sword
[2:07:02] a king knight a man with a sword
[2:07:05] the voice came back not a king when you
[2:07:08] say a king it would be
[2:07:10] a one among many there is only one
[2:07:14] the king there is only one
[2:07:17] the rock that's why when i sing that
[2:07:21] song
[2:07:22] jesus is the wrong i don't say a
[2:07:24] but this shade by day
[2:07:27] yes that's the only shade are you
[2:07:31] are you seeing jesus as an alternative
[2:07:33] to every other shade
[2:07:35] who can shed you better
[2:07:38] let's sing those songs with revelation
[2:07:41] hallelujah
[2:07:43] the hey the voice came back is not a
[2:07:46] king
[2:07:46] the king saw
[2:07:50] and while he was settling down to it the
[2:07:53] remarkable thing
[2:07:55] he noticed was that his unfitted
[2:07:59] perfectly the handle like it was
[2:08:02] made for him and actually it was
[2:08:05] made for ease and
[2:08:09] that is why today he is the only
[2:08:12] qualified one
[2:08:14] i don't care we either with respect or
[2:08:18] we don't due respect
[2:08:20] to any other authority he is the only
[2:08:23] qualified one to bring interpretation
[2:08:28] to the scriptures and the interpretation
[2:08:32] must run from genesis to revelation
[2:08:36] 1946 to 1965.
[2:08:40] don't just talk in the middle of the
[2:08:42] road
[2:08:43] revelation came to him progressively and
[2:08:46] that is the only way you will get
[2:08:48] it until you land in 1965 don't build a
[2:08:52] doctrine
[2:08:54] because that is what is keeping some of
[2:08:56] you stunted
[2:08:58] and making you to become a broken system
[2:09:00] if
[2:09:01] life has not stopped its traveling don't
[2:09:03] stop also
[2:09:04] oh glory to god
[2:09:10] what why was it nature with the sword
[2:09:12] right at the opening of the world
[2:09:15] is to use that sword to chase you back
[2:09:18] into the tree of life
[2:09:23] memorials that will never die so that
[2:09:26] happened on the earth
[2:09:28] can we go into glory now how many are
[2:09:31] ready to travel with me
[2:09:34] let's go into glory
[2:09:37] and we come to ephesians chapter five
[2:09:41] in glory
[2:09:44] this bridegroom
[2:09:48] has a picture
[2:09:52] of what he wants is bright to be
[2:09:56] uh-huh like i've severally told you
[2:10:00] when christ made his bride
[2:10:04] he wasn't in the shape yet
[2:10:09] of his reflection
[2:10:13] but it was determined to bring his bride
[2:10:18] to his reflection
[2:10:21] whatever state he met her is not going
[2:10:24] to discourage him
[2:10:27] this is what the bible said it wasn't
[2:10:30] until we became
[2:10:31] christians that he commended his love to
[2:10:33] us
[2:10:35] oh my you never did anything to impress
[2:10:39] his love
[2:10:41] you never did anything to attract or to
[2:10:44] gain his election
[2:10:46] his free will it is not him that we let
[2:10:50] it is not him that run it it is christ
[2:10:53] that showed mercy
[2:10:55] and i will have mercy on whom i will
[2:10:57] have mercy
[2:10:58] compassion or know my will and on whom
[2:11:01] we will if we withhold it
[2:11:06] say thank god for mercy
[2:11:10] what do you do for this mercy i will
[2:11:13] live a life of appreciation
[2:11:15] that's all you and i can do we never
[2:11:18] meditated we were not the people who
[2:11:21] pray the most
[2:11:23] we don't even go to church as much as
[2:11:25] some people
[2:11:27] but mercy rewrote
[2:11:33] all right god smells
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:42] okay leave it at that leave me that ass
[2:11:48] when you talk of mercy you talk of
[2:11:49] amazing grace
[2:11:52] hallelujah will we an hopeless case
[2:11:56] avoid an empty space if not for grace
[2:12:03] he entered bar room to get some of you
[2:12:06] but as maybe prostitute come to get some
[2:12:09] of yours
[2:12:10] perhaps the gums of ruffians and
[2:12:12] hooligans to get some of us
[2:12:15] those places were filthy for christ to
[2:12:17] enter into
[2:12:19] but he had you in mind they were not
[2:12:21] filthy enough to keep him away
[2:12:24] as long as you were there
[2:12:29] while we were yet sinners god commended
[2:12:33] his love
[2:12:35] but he had a desire that no matter how
[2:12:39] this bride
[2:12:40] of mine looks i'm going to bring her up
[2:12:43] to speech
[2:12:45] she's going to become a glorious church
[2:12:48] say glorious come on george
[2:12:53] something glorious is adorable
[2:12:57] she's gonna become a church without
[2:12:59] spots
[2:13:00] without wrinkle
[2:13:04] did you hear that without one blemish
[2:13:14] and in order to get her to do that
[2:13:17] he must wash her with the water of what
[2:13:23] is wet
[2:13:27] did you hear that the water
[2:13:30] is his work which wedge by the way
[2:13:36] that's what we're going to close on
[2:13:39] because this bride must rise
[2:13:44] this bride cannot be found in some
[2:13:47] quarters
[2:13:50] which ways
[2:13:54] christ at a three-phase ministry
[2:13:58] i'm winding down now but you must see
[2:14:01] this
[2:14:02] don't forget the bible says
[2:14:06] the way christ is getting his bride
[2:14:09] is the way you and i get our bride
[2:14:13] i must quickly hurt that
[2:14:19] the bible said even us
[2:14:22] i will always repeat it to your hearing
[2:14:26] meaning that there is no difference in
[2:14:29] comparison
[2:14:31] of our christ god is bright
[2:14:35] live with his bride
[2:14:38] to the way you do yours
[2:14:43] so if you cannot marry like christ
[2:14:46] and relate like christ with your bride
[2:14:49] you are not fit
[2:14:51] to marry
[2:14:56] who can act like christ
[2:15:01] do you say why you need the nature of
[2:15:03] christ before you go into marriage
[2:15:06] are you here
[2:15:09] if god says take this for the new birth
[2:15:14] if god says if you don't talk like me
[2:15:18] if you don't smile like me gesticulate
[2:15:21] like
[2:15:22] me act or react like i do you will not
[2:15:24] make it
[2:15:26] and it makes me the standard do you know
[2:15:28] all of you are finished
[2:15:31] there are two ways to behave like me
[2:15:35] one is the counterfeit one is genuine
[2:15:40] the counterfeit way is to practice to
[2:15:43] imitate me
[2:15:45] is very stressful but you will achieve
[2:15:48] something
[2:15:50] even though it will not last
[2:15:53] you will practice some people have
[2:15:54] practice today like those twins
[2:15:58] to talk and behave like president our
[2:16:00] president
[2:16:02] that fair-skinned young man i may not
[2:16:04] know him
[2:16:05] if we talk like him he will try they say
[2:16:07] he even looks like him
[2:16:11] but you see when he's doing it he's only
[2:16:14] acting
[2:16:15] because that is not his real him
[2:16:18] unconsciously when they forget himself
[2:16:20] what will he do it will go back to
[2:16:22] himself
[2:16:24] so it's a struggle constantly to do
[2:16:27] like me you will practice you will sweat
[2:16:30] you will do everything but when you
[2:16:33] forget yourself
[2:16:35] you will behave like your real you
[2:16:38] because you know why
[2:16:39] it takes a nature in you to be you
[2:16:42] it takes a nature in me to be mean
[2:16:46] and that nature pilots your body
[2:16:50] effortlessly without you know
[2:16:52] effortlessly
[2:16:54] it's just your primary you just as you
[2:16:57] know
[2:16:58] that if you pick your foot even with
[2:17:01] your eyes closed
[2:17:02] it won't go anywhere else than your
[2:17:04] mouth see
[2:17:07] the ants already know the way of the
[2:17:09] mouth it's effortless
[2:17:12] it doesn't need to be guided this is
[2:17:15] your primary nature
[2:17:17] but for a christian its primary and
[2:17:20] single nature
[2:17:21] must be christ in order to act like
[2:17:23] christ
[2:17:24] so when you practice you can imitate
[2:17:28] but it doesn't last if you're under
[2:17:31] imitation this morning
[2:17:32] i want to call you to a higher life
[2:17:36] because imitation can be frustrating
[2:17:40] it will come to a time that you are
[2:17:42] switching between imitation acting and
[2:17:44] your real you
[2:17:45] amen and when you can get it separated
[2:17:48] you become frustrated
[2:17:50] and you say there's nothing to this
[2:17:52] christianity there's a whole lot to hit
[2:17:54] brother
[2:17:55] there's a whole lot to his sister
[2:18:01] but look at another way
[2:18:04] what if a portion of my nature is taken
[2:18:09] and they come to you do like a surgery
[2:18:13] to take out your own nature and put my
[2:18:16] nature in you
[2:18:17] by the time you wake up you would think
[2:18:19] like me
[2:18:21] effortlessly you will talk like me
[2:18:24] you will act like me you will act like
[2:18:27] me
[2:18:27] everything about my life will be primary
[2:18:30] and easy for you
[2:18:32] did you catch that this is what god
[2:18:35] wants
[2:18:36] and that is why he released the holy
[2:18:38] spirit
[2:18:39] because holy spirit is a portion of
[2:18:42] god's life
[2:18:43] is the life of god in a measure we are
[2:18:46] in christ as the fullness of god
[2:18:49] you are invited to take a measure of it
[2:18:52] amen whether it is a measure or a
[2:18:55] fullness
[2:18:56] it is the same character it is the same
[2:18:58] content
[2:18:59] it's like me going to the sea to take
[2:19:02] some sea water amen
[2:19:05] if i take a bucket of sea water i have
[2:19:07] the entire sea
[2:19:09] in a measure if you measure the entire
[2:19:12] sea water
[2:19:13] and you know and do a measurement of the
[2:19:15] contents
[2:19:16] of the one in the bucket it will be the
[2:19:18] same the same element the same chemicals
[2:19:21] the same thing
[2:19:22] but in a measure you need that nature of
[2:19:26] god
[2:19:27] in a measure to come into you then you
[2:19:30] can testify like paul it is no longer
[2:19:32] either liver
[2:19:34] so before you get married get the holy
[2:19:36] ghost
[2:19:40] it is the only way to marry like christ
[2:19:45] it is the only way to act as the blight
[2:19:48] of christ's reflection
[2:19:50] did you hear me
[2:19:53] it is the only way that no matter what
[2:19:56] happens you will remain a girl and son
[2:19:58] of god
[2:20:00] no matter what happen you will not go on
[2:20:02] a bad hand
[2:20:03] does christ beat his wife does he punch
[2:20:06] his wife
[2:20:07] if you want to be a boxer anthony joshua
[2:20:10] is there for you
[2:20:12] he's available to test your strange
[2:20:14] witch don't test
[2:20:16] it with your bride amen
[2:20:19] even if you lose if you can fight antoni
[2:20:21] joshua you will still collect millions
[2:20:24] so don't waste those energies go to the
[2:20:27] right quarters
[2:20:28] amen but if you carry the nature of god
[2:20:31] you will not do what christ will not do
[2:20:33] to his bride
[2:20:35] because the bible says even us
[2:20:40] christ will never divorce his bride
[2:20:43] no matter what happened amen
[2:20:46] is gotten up for good and for all time
[2:20:54] and the bible said christ loved his
[2:20:57] bride
[2:20:58] until he was willing to sanctify himself
[2:21:01] for all
[2:21:03] you and i you have a reflection of what
[2:21:05] you want your bride to look like isn't
[2:21:07] it
[2:21:08] the way she does things this some of you
[2:21:10] are so meticulous
[2:21:11] you have a way you arrange your table
[2:21:13] you have a way you arrange your books on
[2:21:15] the shelf
[2:21:15] slanted straight horizontal vertica and
[2:21:18] some of you are so meticulous the moment
[2:21:20] you enter the room
[2:21:21] you notice some you can tell
[2:21:26] you are that sensitive to know any
[2:21:28] change amen
[2:21:29] until your wife adapts to that your
[2:21:32] reflection
[2:21:33] you've got to have the patience of
[2:21:35] christ
[2:21:37] amen don't be a bully
[2:21:40] don't be an hyena those are not the
[2:21:44] content of love
[2:21:45] he said he loved his wife
[2:21:49] until he gave himself some of you when
[2:21:52] your husband
[2:21:53] when you're when you are coming home
[2:21:55] your wives are
[2:21:56] under tension anxious because she
[2:22:00] doesn't know what pleases you
[2:22:02] if she greets like this only welcome why
[2:22:05] didn't you say my lord
[2:22:10] if you say my lord why didn't you spice
[2:22:13] it with some romantic word
[2:22:14] by honey sweetheart you are never
[2:22:17] that one is so formal is a cake the same
[2:22:20] person
[2:22:22] you are just an impossible creator
[2:22:26] christ is not like that
[2:22:31] see what we've been showing whatever
[2:22:34] christ
[2:22:35] enjoys he gets it to the bride so he's
[2:22:38] right
[2:22:39] and i gave you just a simple experiment
[2:22:41] if the mouth
[2:22:42] tasted the body the stomach
[2:22:46] stole it
[2:22:51] but a lot of you you take care of
[2:22:53] yourself at the detriment of your wife
[2:22:56] shame on you does christ wait for you
[2:23:01] to tell your need before even supply he
[2:23:03] has the capacity and the nature to know
[2:23:05] the things you need
[2:23:07] the bible told me so he said take no
[2:23:11] thoughts
[2:23:12] hallelujah for what to eat what to drink
[2:23:15] where we shall we be clothed is that
[2:23:18] don't be anxious like the heathen
[2:23:20] for their heavenly father knows that you
[2:23:22] need those things
[2:23:24] isn't that the scriptures but she
[2:23:26] confessed the kingdom of god
[2:23:28] and his righteousness then all other
[2:23:31] things
[2:23:32] it will hurt some of you brothers you
[2:23:36] don't know the needs of your wife
[2:23:38] you stay in the same room you sleep on
[2:23:39] the same bed you don't know any
[2:23:41] you are not that concerned shame
[2:23:46] she has to ask he has to beg she has to
[2:23:49] preach
[2:23:50] and you think that is an advantage
[2:23:53] to show your lordship you are just
[2:23:56] taking advantage to show how a dictator
[2:23:58] you are
[2:24:01] swallow it and say amen
[2:24:03] [Applause]
[2:24:08] i have to say this because paul
[2:24:11] apostle paul was running a comparison he
[2:24:14] said this is a mystery
[2:24:16] and i speak of christ and his word bride
[2:24:20] you gotta love your wife and sisters
[2:24:24] because i'm saying it for the audience
[2:24:25] of the world
[2:24:26] and sisters you've got to come under
[2:24:29] absolute subjection
[2:24:32] that's your position can i hear him for
[2:24:35] that
[2:24:35] [Applause]
[2:24:38] no matter what you attain in life keep
[2:24:41] it at the door when you're coming
[2:24:43] and come reverently that man is your
[2:24:46] head
[2:24:47] amen don't marry a man who you cannot
[2:24:51] submit to
[2:24:53] because you must totally submit
[2:24:56] he is the earth you are the body the
[2:24:59] scripture use the word
[2:25:00] reference reference is stronger than
[2:25:04] respect are you hearing me reference is
[2:25:07] near worship
[2:25:08] amen so make sure you marry a son of god
[2:25:12] enough
[2:25:12] deserving of that for you
[2:25:16] because you must give it if you don't
[2:25:18] give it you are not in your position
[2:25:21] if you don't love your wife like christ
[2:25:23] will do until you can give your life for
[2:25:26] her
[2:25:27] you are not in your position is to show
[2:25:30] you
[2:25:30] the stretch of how much christ was
[2:25:32] willing to sanctify himself
[2:25:35] marriage sanctification is not
[2:25:37] justification sanctification
[2:25:39] but the ability to let go to come
[2:25:43] up from your lofty eyes amen
[2:25:46] and come so low to be able to
[2:25:49] bring your wife to your desire it will
[2:25:52] mean a lot of shaking than for you
[2:25:55] it meant for the lord jesus christ but
[2:25:57] he achieved it
[2:26:00] if christ's heart is bright glorious
[2:26:02] spotless without wrinkle
[2:26:04] you got to have yours to reflect your
[2:26:07] desire
[2:26:08] and that would be a perfect marriage
[2:26:11] hallelujah now
[2:26:14] as i close how did christ achieve it
[2:26:19] by the washing of the water of what
[2:26:22] is words which works let's go to heaven
[2:26:26] now
[2:26:26] and say the word
[2:26:30] that the uncalvary we've seen the ground
[2:26:32] we've seen on the ground
[2:26:34] we've seen what happened on earth we're
[2:26:36] going to heaven the bleeding lamp stood
[2:26:38] before the throne
[2:26:40] worthy
[2:26:44] that's when the four hell that said it
[2:26:46] was worthy
[2:26:47] the four living creatures said it was
[2:26:49] worthy even john when he came back to
[2:26:52] himself said it was worthy
[2:26:54] what is the lamb that was slain to take
[2:26:57] the book
[2:26:59] to lose the seals hallelujah
[2:27:03] revelations chapter five that's where we
[2:27:05] are now amen
[2:27:07] there have been an announcement from the
[2:27:09] throne can i go out for a few moments
[2:27:11] there has been an announcement from the
[2:27:13] tron who is worthy
[2:27:17] why was this announcement because the
[2:27:19] book
[2:27:20] that was in the end of him that sat on
[2:27:22] the throne
[2:27:24] was not meant to be resident in heaven
[2:27:27] it had always been on the earth
[2:27:31] that book was the title deed of the
[2:27:34] earth
[2:27:35] amen it was by it adam lived
[2:27:39] adam never needed any inventions
[2:27:42] to enjoy his earthly living because he
[2:27:46] lived by spoken word
[2:27:48] amen everything listened to heather
[2:27:52] that was taking his position as a son of
[2:27:55] god
[2:27:56] god make you the governor of this earth
[2:27:59] and you are going to rule
[2:28:00] you are going to reign that is the
[2:28:02] meaning of the manifestation
[2:28:05] of the sons of god
[2:28:08] we are coming back to his church
[2:28:12] when heard them has the right to die
[2:28:15] titled it
[2:28:17] he has that tattoo deed which gave him
[2:28:19] ownership
[2:28:20] not just the governance of the earth
[2:28:24] did you hear me that is why even till
[2:28:27] now
[2:28:28] don't get it in your head that you are
[2:28:30] going to spend eternity in heaven
[2:28:32] you are spending eternity on the earth
[2:28:35] because
[2:28:36] this earth belongs to us satan today
[2:28:40] might be the god of this evil age but
[2:28:42] tell him i say
[2:28:44] is an ordinary squatter he's not even
[2:28:48] dignified to be a tenant
[2:28:50] if he's attendant he'll be paying rent
[2:28:53] but scott has done parents
[2:28:55] they do i don't seek occupation so i
[2:28:58] cause satan is quarter
[2:29:00] it doesn't have the title here and it
[2:29:02] doesn't have receipts to show a patreon
[2:29:05] because the real land owner we are not
[2:29:07] willing to take filthy money
[2:29:09] from the ants of the devil he should
[2:29:12] keep his money away
[2:29:14] it should keep his rent away because
[2:29:16] whatever satan
[2:29:17] offers hallelujah it doesn't offer
[2:29:20] freebies
[2:29:21] it's a pleasure for a while and the
[2:29:23] pleasure for the world is to filthy for
[2:29:25] us
[2:29:26] that is why we will not accept his
[2:29:28] proposal
[2:29:29] we will not accept his temptations
[2:29:32] hallelujah
[2:29:33] are the children of god with me on this
[2:29:36] or you are yielding to the devil
[2:29:38] you are taking his carrot you are
[2:29:39] enjoying his sinful excesses
[2:29:42] those are his rents but we won't take it
[2:29:47] hallelujah so he will keep squatting
[2:29:51] until we are ready to take over why did
[2:29:54] he become his cutter
[2:29:56] when adam fell he lost
[2:29:59] the possession you know when satan saw
[2:30:03] somebody
[2:30:04] who could talk to the trees and trees
[2:30:05] will obey
[2:30:07] is if vedim was going in the midst of
[2:30:09] the garden and the tree had flourished
[2:30:11] and crossed his path it doesn't need an
[2:30:13] axe
[2:30:14] or a pruning fog if we just said mr tree
[2:30:16] adjust yourself
[2:30:17] i want to pass until we say oh governor
[2:30:22] and it will pass if adam got to the sea
[2:30:26] it doesn't need a yacht a canal a ship
[2:30:29] or anything
[2:30:31] it just keep walking and the sea will
[2:30:33] take an option
[2:30:35] the master is coming what shall i do
[2:30:37] shall i gather more gravity to suspend
[2:30:40] him while walking upon
[2:30:41] me and he will not sink or shall i just
[2:30:43] open up for him
[2:30:44] to pass through dry land
[2:30:48] it's flying over your head
[2:30:54] this is the message that will bring you
[2:30:56] the consciousness of that
[2:30:58] the prophet said when we fell we lost
[2:31:00] the consciousness of who we are
[2:31:03] but the time has returned for us to be
[2:31:05] brought back to it
[2:31:07] are you here don't let it fly over your
[2:31:10] head
[2:31:11] it is the truth that was why god gave
[2:31:14] you
[2:31:14] a moses amen whom did you open for
[2:31:18] and he walked on dry land he gave you a
[2:31:20] peter who walked upon the waters
[2:31:22] and he gave you a joshua who spoke to
[2:31:25] the son
[2:31:26] amen all those things are to show to you
[2:31:28] how it was in the beginning
[2:31:30] and give you appetite and faith for a
[2:31:33] return
[2:31:34] because it will happen again the prophet
[2:31:37] said now we pray
[2:31:38] very soon we shall be speaking because
[2:31:41] to us
[2:31:42] is the restoration of the spoken word
[2:31:44] the touch you did of god for this hour
[2:31:47] you love him
[2:31:51] so when he fell he lost the possession
[2:31:55] when lucifer saw that he was too
[2:31:58] jealous and envious he wanted that
[2:32:00] ability but he can have it
[2:32:02] so when adam fell he thought by that if
[2:32:05] we get the title
[2:32:06] but god brushed him aside and he took
[2:32:08] the title
[2:32:10] and he left for glory but as long as
[2:32:13] that title stay
[2:32:14] in glory we cannot take possession here
[2:32:18] our christianity will be what alone
[2:32:21] will be a bluffer and we have to take
[2:32:24] possession
[2:32:25] we have to manifest as the sons and
[2:32:28] daughters of god
[2:32:29] amen because the earth is groaning
[2:32:33] waiting for that manifestation they want
[2:32:36] to see
[2:32:36] us in the pre-genesis chapter 3
[2:32:39] condition
[2:32:40] wearing everything is subject to the
[2:32:43] adopted sons and daughters of god
[2:32:45] are you here together come it will come
[2:32:49] friends
[2:32:50] so this was why heaven couldn't hold
[2:32:52] that book
[2:32:54] but to get that book the penalty of sin
[2:32:57] of what happened in genesis 3 must be
[2:32:59] paid
[2:33:00] so christ paid it on the cross of
[2:33:03] calvary
[2:33:04] oh before he resurrected he did a lot of
[2:33:06] things for you or not
[2:33:08] that was why his resurrection means so
[2:33:10] much to us
[2:33:11] amen because his resurrection was a seal
[2:33:16] that the work is indeed finished the
[2:33:18] rome
[2:33:19] put a stone on his grave and they put a
[2:33:22] seal on it
[2:33:23] to block the resurrection but jesus
[2:33:26] broke the seal
[2:33:28] the hinger came down broke the seal and
[2:33:31] he rolled away the stone
[2:33:34] every lid by which you are kept under
[2:33:37] by the finished work of cavalry is
[2:33:39] broken
[2:33:41] the stone is rolled away it was the same
[2:33:44] person who rode it away
[2:33:45] from the grave of lazarus he rolled it
[2:33:48] away from his own grave
[2:33:50] and today i roll it away even from your
[2:33:53] own life
[2:33:54] by the prophecy of the prophet in the
[2:33:56] name of jesus christ
[2:33:58] [Applause]
[2:33:59] you will have no limitation they said
[2:34:02] the sky is the limit
[2:34:03] we are going to fly beyond the vaulted
[2:34:05] sky
[2:34:06] amen we are going beyond all dimensions
[2:34:10] right into the mighty presence of god
[2:34:12] because the central resurrected within
[2:34:15] the sky was not their limit they broke
[2:34:17] beyond the sky
[2:34:19] they broke beyond the blues they broke
[2:34:21] beyond all the heavens
[2:34:22] and they went straight into the presence
[2:34:24] by the captain jesus
[2:34:26] lift your gate and let the king of glory
[2:34:29] come in who is this king of glory
[2:34:31] the lord mighty in battle he
[2:34:35] is the king of glory they could testify
[2:34:38] of his identity because they enjoyed it
[2:34:41] you can testify of the identity of
[2:34:44] christ
[2:34:45] by what you enjoyed of him you will
[2:34:47] enjoy him as a savior
[2:34:49] as a redeemer as a healer as a deliverer
[2:34:53] in all his redemption abilities you will
[2:34:56] enjoy that blessings
[2:34:57] they are yours
[2:35:03] the bleeding land stood and proved to be
[2:35:06] worthy
[2:35:08] and it took the book amen
[2:35:11] you see because no one was worthy john
[2:35:13] was crying
[2:35:15] do you know that was you you were
[2:35:18] represented as
[2:35:19] john in the book of revelation
[2:35:22] you sounded hopeless you sounded empty
[2:35:25] you think you wouldn't make it but thank
[2:35:28] god for the elders
[2:35:29] you were so caught up in your sorrow
[2:35:32] until you didn't even see the
[2:35:34] intervention
[2:35:35] but thank god for the elders the job of
[2:35:37] a true elder
[2:35:39] is not to tell you what christ will do
[2:35:41] is to show you what christ
[2:35:43] has done and by the preaching of the
[2:35:46] gospel take away your doubt
[2:35:48] so you can rise up and receive it
[2:35:51] the elders called unto john john whipnot
[2:35:55] amen look the lamb has prevailed
[2:35:59] not that he will prevail he has
[2:36:00] prevailed everything christ wanted to do
[2:36:03] for you he has already
[2:36:05] done by his tribes you
[2:36:08] are healed the chastisements of your
[2:36:12] peace
[2:36:12] has already been placed upon him so
[2:36:15] nothing can tamper with your peace
[2:36:18] nothing can happen with your joy
[2:36:20] all things are yours this morning those
[2:36:23] who may follow you
[2:36:24] he cults you are here this morning
[2:36:27] because he called you those whom he
[2:36:29] called him justified
[2:36:31] he sanctified he predestinated to be
[2:36:34] confirmed for abduction even your
[2:36:38] adoption is a finished work
[2:36:40] i say it all things are yours all you
[2:36:43] need to do is to only believe
[2:36:45] then all things will be possible
[2:36:48] the lamb took the book
[2:36:52] the bible said it prevails
[2:36:55] to take the book and to do what and to
[2:36:58] lose the seals
[2:37:00] because if he took the book and never
[2:37:02] lose the seals no job done
[2:37:04] because i'm trying to test them to trace
[2:37:07] the watch that washes you
[2:37:10] that makes you glorious without spot
[2:37:12] without wrinkle
[2:37:13] there are so many words in the land amen
[2:37:16] there are theological wars there are
[2:37:18] denominational wars
[2:37:19] but there was one particular word of
[2:37:22] ease
[2:37:23] that must produce the blight of his
[2:37:25] reflection
[2:37:26] that's what i'm treating for you john
[2:37:29] rejoice
[2:37:30] amen until heaven and earth stopped
[2:37:34] that is your joy there when the lamb
[2:37:37] took the book
[2:37:38] when he took it in revelations 5
[2:37:41] in revelation 6 it started opening
[2:37:45] if you never opened it you will never be
[2:37:47] better than a denomination
[2:37:50] that thought first ministry of jesus
[2:37:52] christ is on
[2:37:54] the first two faces elin and disarmament
[2:37:58] couldn't produce the bride
[2:38:02] swallow it swallow it regardless of
[2:38:06] carnal theologies you have been taught
[2:38:09] and let me tell you that wasn't the
[2:38:11] shout
[2:38:13] god started the message rapture amen
[2:38:17] the shout came in the heaven in time the
[2:38:20] prophet said
[2:38:21] the messianic discernment and the
[2:38:22] healing by the ants
[2:38:24] they are all concluded as healing
[2:38:26] service
[2:38:27] they are signs behind their voice
[2:38:30] but the voice must come the signs
[2:38:33] attracted all manner of people
[2:38:35] all manner of congregation from among
[2:38:38] whom is the bride
[2:38:39] but those signs cannot i couldn't
[2:38:42] identify the bride
[2:38:44] just as the crowd was with the lord
[2:38:46] jesus christ when he was healing the
[2:38:48] sick raising the dead
[2:38:50] giving them bread five thousand years
[2:38:52] four thousand years
[2:38:53] mighty great campaigns hallelujah but do
[2:38:56] you know the identity of the bride among
[2:38:58] those crowds
[2:38:59] no sir until they began to sound his
[2:39:02] message
[2:39:02] except you heath my flesh you drink my
[2:39:05] blood no life in you
[2:39:06] a lot of people went back after all the
[2:39:09] bible has said
[2:39:10] they were not following him because of
[2:39:12] his words
[2:39:14] they were following because of the
[2:39:15] miracle of bread and signs and wonders
[2:39:18] science seekers are still doing the same
[2:39:20] thing today that is why they will make
[2:39:22] you try to think
[2:39:23] that there is no move no revival in the
[2:39:25] bride i don't know what
[2:39:27] a greater revival could be the reviver
[2:39:29] of the revealed watch
[2:39:32] that comes with its attendant
[2:39:35] manifestation
[2:39:36] if it is not happening in your quarters
[2:39:38] change house address
[2:39:41] because it's happening among the real
[2:39:42] believers you love him this morning
[2:39:45] the gospel is being demonstrated in
[2:39:48] manifestations
[2:39:49] not only in word alone it is the article
[2:39:52] of the believing church
[2:39:56] when jesus began to sound this message
[2:40:00] a lot of people took offense even the
[2:40:01] closer seventy left
[2:40:04] left with from among one was even the
[2:40:06] devil
[2:40:07] all the entire ministry of jesus christ
[2:40:10] on the day of pentecost couldn't produce
[2:40:12] more than 120 people at the upper room
[2:40:14] imagine that meaning some pastors
[2:40:17] even the apostles were more successful
[2:40:19] than christ
[2:40:21] in terms of gathering people amen but
[2:40:23] you know that's a mystery in itself
[2:40:26] because except the corner of this they
[2:40:28] accept the corn
[2:40:31] the seed of corn the corner of weight
[2:40:34] is buried amen it will abide by itself
[2:40:38] amen a lot of people were not meant to
[2:40:41] come until
[2:40:42] until after the dead burial and
[2:40:43] resurrection who are those people
[2:40:46] you the gentile bride
[2:40:50] hallelujah so
[2:40:53] when he was doing that so much crowd but
[2:40:55] when he began to sound his message
[2:40:58] the third face which the prophet called
[2:41:00] the deadpool
[2:41:01] the crowd left so also in this entire
[2:41:06] so the lamp started opening the seals
[2:41:09] which is the thoughtful the opening of
[2:41:11] the world
[2:41:12] in revelation 6 it was busy opening
[2:41:15] until revelations chapter 8 it
[2:41:17] completely word
[2:41:18] opened don't deny any of the seals
[2:41:22] opening because even from your scripture
[2:41:25] the bible said they were all opened what
[2:41:28] you can say
[2:41:29] is that what the seventh in particular
[2:41:32] opened to
[2:41:33] has not completely come to pass that is
[2:41:36] very true
[2:41:37] but we know what to expect from them
[2:41:40] because the prophet said 17 it's like a
[2:41:42] rocket
[2:41:43] that we blow air blood air blow here
[2:41:46] take so many things and bring the
[2:41:48] perfect
[2:41:48] picture of the scriptures are you here
[2:41:51] and they call it
[2:41:52] the end of time as long as we are in
[2:41:55] time we are still in the seventh seal
[2:41:57] it call it the end of the struggling
[2:41:59] world as long as we are still in the
[2:42:02] struggling world
[2:42:03] till we blend into eternity we are still
[2:42:06] in the seventh seal
[2:42:07] the prophet said i will speak about one
[2:42:10] fold of it
[2:42:11] the rest i will keep if he knew enough
[2:42:13] that there are three folds in the
[2:42:15] seventh seal
[2:42:16] it shows it's already opened amen
[2:42:19] if he's able to tell us one fold of it
[2:42:22] which he called the seven thunders
[2:42:23] it shows it's already opened if it
[2:42:26] wasn't open
[2:42:27] we wouldn't knew that much so don't deny
[2:42:29] the opening of the world
[2:42:31] if you want to be saved if you want to
[2:42:33] be redeemed
[2:42:34] if you want to be changed if you want to
[2:42:36] be glorious
[2:42:37] if you want to be unspotted if you want
[2:42:39] to be his bride
[2:42:41] of his reflection
[2:42:45] because it wasn't a close book that was
[2:42:48] delivered
[2:42:48] to john it will come to each
[2:42:52] the title this the book that it was
[2:42:54] opening is the same bible in your hand
[2:42:59] over three billion people among the
[2:43:00] seven billion people
[2:43:02] according to what statistics are
[2:43:03] christians who carry this bible
[2:43:05] whether that's fundamental or orthodox
[2:43:08] pentecostal
[2:43:09] different types of denomination and
[2:43:11] including the bride of jesus christ
[2:43:13] but to how many is this book opened
[2:43:17] they are carrying a close book because
[2:43:20] they have not accepted
[2:43:22] the prophecy of the prophet and it is
[2:43:24] the prophecy of the prophets that opened
[2:43:27] the book
[2:43:28] that put life into dry bones to make
[2:43:30] them a matching army
[2:43:31] for their manifestation i'm bringing
[2:43:34] ezekiel
[2:43:34] to the book of revelation 10 now
[2:43:39] by revelation 8 he had completed opening
[2:43:42] by revelation 10 is to does the mighty
[2:43:45] angel
[2:43:45] with what with the book opened
[2:43:50] can you say the language of the
[2:43:51] scripture are you saying your easter
[2:43:54] it wasn't for nothing that the bible has
[2:43:57] to specifically give specific details
[2:44:00] it didn't say with a book in his hand he
[2:44:02] could have said that
[2:44:03] it said with a book opened
[2:44:07] why was it opened because in revelation
[2:44:10] 6 to 8
[2:44:10] it was busy opening by revelation 10 it
[2:44:13] has finished opening
[2:44:18] you caught that
[2:44:21] then he said but in the days
[2:44:24] of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:44:28] when it shall begin to sound the prophet
[2:44:31] said
[2:44:32] not in the healing service so those of
[2:44:35] you who thought shout
[2:44:36] was just the first pull and second pull
[2:44:38] healing service you are confused
[2:44:41] the shout is the actual opening of the
[2:44:44] wedge
[2:44:45] and that takes oh my that removed the
[2:44:48] plank on the feet
[2:44:49] of those who felt it's another person
[2:44:51] who will come and reveal the word
[2:44:53] the prophet reveals the words the
[2:44:56] prophet wasn't the revealer it was the
[2:44:58] mighty angel
[2:45:00] amen taking over the ministry of the
[2:45:02] seventh angel of laodicea
[2:45:04] to reveal himself to the bride of christ
[2:45:08] are we here don't get confused
[2:45:13] there is no heath messenger anywhere
[2:45:16] and there is no other joshua than the
[2:45:17] lord jesus christ himself
[2:45:19] because he is jehovah's savior it is not
[2:45:22] the ministry of men that open their
[2:45:24] sails
[2:45:25] when the cloud of glory came down amen
[2:45:29] they are disputing it because it is our
[2:45:31] redemption
[2:45:32] you can take it away from us what was
[2:45:35] the testimony of the prophet about that
[2:45:37] ring of mystery
[2:45:38] it was our lord up there
[2:45:41] and when we turn it to the right angle
[2:45:44] which only god knows the right angle
[2:45:47] we can see the eyes of our lord the nose
[2:45:50] and the mouth of our lord
[2:45:51] what was he doing coming down amen
[2:45:55] in the ministry of the seven angels to
[2:45:58] give the commission for the open book
[2:46:00] christ was the seals that were opened it
[2:46:03] was the one that opened the seal
[2:46:05] it is not the ministry of a man it is a
[2:46:08] reincarnated ministry of the lord jesus
[2:46:10] christ
[2:46:12] but since he said he will not be here in
[2:46:14] his corporate body
[2:46:15] he must go through a man amen
[2:46:18] but this that man is not the one we are
[2:46:21] feeding upon
[2:46:22] amen because a man his word will
[2:46:26] fail the prophet and the message
[2:46:28] anointed once at the end time
[2:46:30] i was not the one that appeared at the
[2:46:32] ohio river
[2:46:34] i was only the person nearest hallelujah
[2:46:38] it was a present town near edmond sunset
[2:46:41] arizona mountain when the seven angels
[2:46:44] came down
[2:46:45] amen and when they were going back they
[2:46:47] left a memorial for us
[2:46:49] he was the only one near her to see the
[2:46:51] pillar of fire
[2:46:52] to even tweak an undisputable picture
[2:46:55] because it was taken by the critics he
[2:46:58] was the only one available to do it
[2:47:01] amen we don't see the pillar of fire
[2:47:05] except he chooses to reveal himself
[2:47:07] because somebody
[2:47:08] built him today is the most sensitive
[2:47:12] person to the supernatural
[2:47:13] he can tell you when he's around amen he
[2:47:16] can tell you when he leaves
[2:47:18] and when it please god by the camera of
[2:47:20] that critic
[2:47:21] it took his picture for us that we can
[2:47:24] behold
[2:47:24] that this is not a fable it is the hour
[2:47:27] of another calling out
[2:47:28] it is another exodus it is the how of
[2:47:31] another resurrection
[2:47:36] the mighty angel looked for his seventh
[2:47:39] angel
[2:47:40] and deposited the blessing to carry you
[2:47:43] to who
[2:47:45] to john of this hour he said i am not
[2:47:49] the one that appeared at ohio
[2:47:51] but i was the only person there you are
[2:47:54] not feeding on me
[2:47:55] because a man is what will fail but you
[2:47:59] are feeding on the unfailing body weight
[2:48:02] of the son of man apostle paul said that
[2:48:05] which i received from the lord the semi
[2:48:09] john was delivered with two with an open
[2:48:12] book he was given an open book
[2:48:14] and what is it to do with the open book
[2:48:18] this is your cleansing this is your
[2:48:21] purification
[2:48:22] this is your patch to glory hallelujah
[2:48:26] hallelujah laodicea rejected this
[2:48:30] when that full world was being given
[2:48:33] just as they rejected christ
[2:48:34] they rejected the message amen
[2:48:38] and the moment laudation pentecostal age
[2:48:41] who carried the prophet around the world
[2:48:43] seven times not with your money
[2:48:45] it was the money of united pentecostal
[2:48:47] assemblies of god for square
[2:48:49] and full gospel businessmen amen they
[2:48:52] were rallying around them as they rally
[2:48:54] around jesus
[2:48:56] during the healing service moment but
[2:48:58] when
[2:48:59] he began to sound his message because
[2:49:01] the ministry christ brought
[2:49:03] what the minister the prophet brought
[2:49:05] was the reincarnated ministry of christ
[2:49:07] solely for the gentiles as it was done
[2:49:10] to the jews and to the samaritan
[2:49:12] so the reaction the experience jesus art
[2:49:15] is what the prophet will have because
[2:49:18] the ministry was the same
[2:49:20] did you catch that so when they rejected
[2:49:23] it
[2:49:23] laudacian lust told the article to
[2:49:26] produce a bride
[2:49:27] lauda became dead amen
[2:49:31] now in the midst of that loudesia what
[2:49:34] the stars deceits the blood of christ
[2:49:36] something must be used to call them out
[2:49:39] and that is the voice
[2:49:41] that is the shout that is the opening of
[2:49:43] the world
[2:49:44] that has pulled you and i out so the
[2:49:46] angel can ask the people again this
[2:49:48] morning why are you looking for the
[2:49:50] living among the dead
[2:49:54] do you see why the prophet said i want
[2:49:56] this easter to mean more to you
[2:49:58] than any easter he said the easter of
[2:50:00] the groom was the resurrection of christ
[2:50:03] he said but if the head resurrected the
[2:50:05] body was also resurrected
[2:50:07] he said this last easter is the
[2:50:10] resurrection
[2:50:11] of his bride out of dark dead
[2:50:14] denominationalism out of dead laodicea
[2:50:18] into the glorious age of the bride
[2:50:22] god kept another economy because
[2:50:25] laodicea lost the article to mature you
[2:50:28] and to keep you alive laudacia became
[2:50:31] blind
[2:50:33] wretched naked miserable poor
[2:50:36] and on top of it amnesia they don't know
[2:50:39] it
[2:50:39] can the price be matured under such
[2:50:41] conditions
[2:50:43] the maturing brand must come out of that
[2:50:45] condition
[2:50:46] just as the exodus blight in the effects
[2:50:49] of us we're out of
[2:50:51] egypt by condition when there was
[2:50:53] darkness in egypt there was light in
[2:50:55] goshen
[2:50:56] is to show to you that a calling out is
[2:50:59] ready
[2:51:00] and when christ was ready to call us out
[2:51:02] it changed the condition
[2:51:04] we are in the laudacian age but we don't
[2:51:06] live by laudacian conditions
[2:51:09] god carved a new economy called the age
[2:51:11] of the bride
[2:51:12] while we are not blind our eyes have
[2:51:14] been anointed with eyesight
[2:51:16] and we can see we are clotted in his
[2:51:19] righteousness
[2:51:20] we are not filthy we are clean we are
[2:51:22] not poor
[2:51:23] we are rich we are not wretched we are
[2:51:25] children of the king
[2:51:27] we are children of dominion living a
[2:51:30] life of victory
[2:51:31] a life of possession and our eyes of
[2:51:34] understanding
[2:51:36] has been open at last so we don't suffer
[2:51:39] amnesia
[2:51:40] so we no longer live in love this year
[2:51:43] why did we come out
[2:51:44] in order to eat the open book
[2:51:48] for our manifestation amen
[2:51:51] enjoy your eating is this sweet to you
[2:51:54] as you are eating
[2:51:56] in your mouth is going to be sweet john
[2:51:58] was commanded to eat
[2:52:00] not to sympathize with it not to
[2:52:03] decorate his house with it but to eat it
[2:52:06] be glutenous about it friends because
[2:52:08] the hour is late
[2:52:10] eat as much as you could it will be
[2:52:12] sweet in your mouth
[2:52:14] when it gets to your belly it will be
[2:52:16] what bitter
[2:52:17] amen when is joy become your joy and
[2:52:20] your joy become his joy
[2:52:21] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[2:52:24] you the life that will come out of you
[2:52:26] will become a weep to the kingdom of
[2:52:28] darkness and there is going to be a
[2:52:30] reaction
[2:52:31] the prophet said there is a bitterness
[2:52:33] but you've got nothing to fear
[2:52:36] he said because john thomas professor
[2:52:40] the testimony of jesus christ is the
[2:52:43] spirit of prophecy
[2:52:44] meaning john you must testify you must
[2:52:48] give the living proof
[2:52:49] that christ is not dead but he is alive
[2:52:53] and the visible proof will beat the
[2:52:55] living world
[2:52:56] leaving himself out in you doing the
[2:52:58] same things
[2:52:59] that he did when christ was here that is
[2:53:02] our manifestation
[2:53:04] that is our blessings that is the
[2:53:06] glorious church
[2:53:07] without spot without wrinkle that is the
