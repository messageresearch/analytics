there it was so inspiring I was thinking how as if we in Babylon outside is Babylon and here we are tonight worshiping the Living God going on commune with the Living God the world is busy outside the world is doing everything that they could do tonight but we choose to talk to God we choose to relate to God we CH we choose to call upon his name and that is such a precious thing and to think the three hebo boys to think about Daniel to think about the heroes of fith and the Old Testament how they Wonder so much pressure and the god of Babylon the different gods that they had and they still to press forward to serve the Living God and they stood they stood without the Holy Ghost they stood by revelation of faith their soul and this is how we have to stand tonight we fight and we battle and we live by faith let's bow our heads tonight as we want to start in a word of prayer and we want to have a special prayer for brother VJ tonight he's in the hospital and he's looking to God they have some operation to do for him and we just pray Our God Hand be upon him and his wife and family Heavenly Father we thank you for gathers together tonight and we pray that your presence will come down

this race I love to be shut in with god father you shut us in and hide us Lord bless the family the VJ family in a special way and as we go on into your word may be with us in Jesus name I ask it amen and God bless you and again tonight welcome thanks for taking this pause tonight I'll give you my title for this call called a House of Prayer called a house of prayer and I want to start by reading this before I read the scriptures brother brand I was a little I was a little boy first recognition I have it in my book it'll be all pretty soon my mother's own words concering what taking place a little cabin the morning when I first came I never come here by my own power you never come by your own power I never knew when I was coming I don't know when I'm leaving none of us do we may yet some of us may leave the world before the night is over I do not know but I was 7 years old I was in water from a well and a voice spoke to me out of a bush as a whirlwind in a bush and said don't never smoke or drink or defile your body in any way they'll be a work to do when you get older I said that is sacred let me repeat that part he was just seven years old and a voice said don't never smoke or drink or defile your body in any way there'll be a work to do when you get older so tonight to scriptures Isaiah 567 and Matthew 211 12-13 Isaiah 567 says even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people Matthew 21 12 and 11 12-13 and Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all of them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money Changers and the seats of them that so does and said unto them it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but you have made it end of of Thieves may God bless his word so Jesus actually was referring to that scripture in Isaiah so Jesus knew the word and his action and his expression and all that he did was a reflection of what the scriptures are prophesied so what Jesus was saying to them is that this house that is to be a House of Prayer you have defiled it by what you do in it I want you to think about these words a House of Prayer being defiled by what you do now we want to show you you as that house not a physical building your body now what is defilement what is defilement the act of making something F Duty or unclean the violation of something considered secret or the act of making something ceremonially impure defilement spoiling something or someone so that is less beautiful or pure corrupting the Purity or Perfection of something making something physically unclean with something unpleasant or contaminated so defilement refers to the act of making something impure unclean Unholy either physically morally spiritually it often denotes a state of separation from God due to sin unclean actions or association with something considered unclean or profane now Jesus in Mark 7 verse 20 he said these words he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man I want you to think about the man being your body being your house for from within or out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders tests covetousness wickedness deceit lishness and evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness all these evil thing come from within and defile the man but BR some Ephesian Church AG he said the way of God is Holiness let it be known to every member here of the body of Christ until you live a holy life God refuses your sacrifice so think about it the house or the temple was a place to bring sacrifice to bring an offering to bring whether it's a bull or a goat or whatever it is it's a place is to bring a sacrifice unto God and here the prophet is saying let it be known to every member here of the body of Christ he's not talking to a church now he's not talking to a group he's speaking to the body of Christ that means this is international around the world until you live a holy life God refuses your sacrifice the sacrifice must be offered with holy hands the high priest before he could even come in to offer the sacrifice you had to be holy dedicated anointed perfume and everything and before you could even walk in the presence of God to offer the sacrifice is that right then here we go how can you go out here and cheat and steal and fuss and fight with your neighbors and everything else and carry on the way you do and then come in here and say oh Lord Praise Jesus Hallelujah so he's showing that your mindset has to adjust and change as to who God is and who his house is the question was asked what house will you build me and I want you to think now a house is built Brick by Brick cement gravel sand it is built and if he has to have a house of prayer it must also be built how you start how you come through in building this house because brother bam said he made praying a habit and you can also whe you're exercising whe in the bathroom and you're bathing whether you're on the streets traveling you can make this praying or have it you could be in your own Zone and you could be crying out unto God so let's continue now under the law I want to get an idea of how God saw it under the law this word defilement Leviticus 18 20 to 27 moreover thou shall not lie Carly with thy neighbor's wife to defile thyself with her Thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire of Mo neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God I am the Lord Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination neither shall thou lie with any Beast to defile thyself therewi neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down there there too it is confusion defile not ye yourselves in any of these things for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast down before you so he seeing these are the acts these are the performance of the nation and God cast them out verse 25 and the land is defiled that's how God viewed that's God opinion of it not just the people but the land itself is defiled therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land itself vomited out inhabitants ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments and shall not commit any of these Abominations neither any of you of your own Nation nor any stranger that sourth among you for all these Abominations have the men of the land done which were before you and the land is defiled so we want to go now in this terminology I'm using here about defiling the house Ezekiel 511 so just relax and just listen listen closely these are scriptures we never really touched before but I believe it's applicable now Ezekiel 511 States wherefore as I live sayeth the Lord God surely because thou has defile my Sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine Abominations therefore will I also diminish thee neither shall my eyes spear neither shall I have any pity Jeremiah 7:30 for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight seeth the Lord they have set their abomination in the house which is called by my name to pollute it so this is not man's opinion this is God's opinion this is God's Viewpoint I say to you this way you have your thoughts I have my thoughts I may be wrong you might be right you might be wrong I might be right but it is irrelevant your thoughts and my thoughts what is most important is God thoughts you may have strong conviction about certain things that's okay that's fine but how does God see it and this is when we shake off the load of people's thoughts and ideas when we begin to look again and ask the question in our behavior in our attitude in our words how does God see this this is me and this is me I'm not talking about you because you are troubled all by yourself born in sin shap iniquity non rightous no not one we are wicked that's how God sees us that's why we come to Christ we are wicked we are evil that's why we repent and we bring our sins upon the altar that the cleansing blood could cleanse us to make us right there is none righteous no not one that's the word so we cannot approach it from our self righteous position we can't do that so let's let's continue 1 Corinthians 3:16 Says know you not that he are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are so now we begin to see in the context of the scripture saying we are fearfully and wonderfully made God made this body or this house or this Temple that he could dwell in it that his Spirit could work in it and through it we have our own Spirit we have our own choices I know a lot of these women live and and and and and wom talking about my choice my body and whatnot but is it our body or is it what God give to us our hands our eyes our feet our lungs from the crown of our head to the soul of our feet un loan and you hear me oft times the time was given to fulfill purpose so in this time this body called time the Prophet this body called time and time at a beginning and time of an ending and his body called time he give us this opportunity to fulfill his purpose so he sees our bodies as a temple do you see your body as a temple or you just doing your own thing 1 Corinthians 316 and the Amplified says do you not discern and understand that you the whole church at Corinth are God's Temple his sanctuary and that God's spirit has his permanent dwelling in you to be at home in you collectively as a church and also individually verse 17 Amplified if anyone does hurt to God's Temple or corrupts it with false doctrines or destroy it God will do hurt to him and bring him to the corruption of debt and destroy him for the temple of God is Holy and sacred to him and that Temple you the believing church and his individual Believers are so you could take note why I read but bram's testimony of when he was seven years old where God told him don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body because I have a work for you to do at 87 he is not in a position to do any work but at 8 Heaven he could hear God's voice to give him an opportunity to prepare his mind and your mind have to be set in order for Holiness now we are not just throwing out words tonight these are very specific things that your mind can set it in order for Holiness set it in order in preparation to be used by God so now we find out that by God telling him that it means that God uses a certain type of vessel and that is why you hear me say God is not looking for a better sermon a better text a better Exposition go looking for a better man is you he's looking for when he got fed up with Saul he said I see a better man and that better man was David David would have his fla and his flaws but the fact is he saw a man after God's Own Heart and this is how you have to become you grew up from wherever part of train that you grew up from whe background or whatever and you have your own thoughts and ideas sometimes the family is lopsided sometime their family is not balanced and you out of your own family come out with a unbalanced view unbalanced view of Life unbalanced view of things around you and you are challenged to drop your view drop your thoughts and ideas and embrace God's thoughts as it comes through by the word all of us will have issues and challenges from our family background and how we grow up and what we see and what we taught and our educational background or lack there of whatever it might be but when it comes to the word IT addresses all rich poor Born Free poor Rich IT addresses all and God is no respect of persons you don't respect or you're rich or you have money Car Land house motorbike or airplane it doesn't M it doesn't matter what you have he is not respecting you by what you have he respects his word if you respect his word if you honor his word he will honor you after to finish this what I'm doing tonight let's continue 1 Corinthians 6 15- 20 Meats for the belly and the belly for Meats but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for forication but for the Lord and the Lord for the but so God sees fornication certain way he sees sexual impurity certain way he see defilement a certain way and the scriptures Clearly say now the body which is your body or your house is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body I'm still reading and God had both raised up the Lord and will also raise us by his own power knowing not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a hot God forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to UNH harot is one body for two s he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit flee fornication every sin that a man do it is without the body but he that commit fornication sin it against his own body so we see from the scriptures you can actually sin against your own body then Paul in verse 19 went on further what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost so I hope God will write this in your heart like an iron pen that you are your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye and not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods as we hit the home stretch here now familiar scripture 2 Corinthians 7 verse1 this is the instructions 2 Corinthians 7 vers1 says having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God shall wrap up here in terms of going over some so Paul teaching emphasizes the Holiness of the body and the responsibility of Christians to live in Purity and honor and church friends Christians you must see your body as his house again he said know you not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost he are bought with a price so God is calling not just to avoid sin but the sin especially that defiles the body If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy now Romans 121 Paul begging asking I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present what your bodies or your house or your temple a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service so you're expressing about the sanctity of the body your physical body so your body is not just a vessel of physical existence but it is to be a sacred place where God's Spirits dwell so this implies avoiding behaviors that desecrated such as sexual immorality substance abuse or neglect into this body we are called to maintain Purity in thought word and deed and therefore as a responsibility to glorify God as believers we are called to honor God through our action choices and lifestyle you know that's called diabetes two things in diabetes sometimes is inherited gen um genal gen genetically and sometimes it's lifestyle lifestyle could be addressed you cannot do anything about your genes pass down from Grandfather or whatever it is but the lifestyle you know with the choices you make what you eat what you drink where you go that is life C how do we address defilement defilement is anything that tarnishes a person's Purity Holiness or relationship with God how do we address that defilement can be cleansed through repentance and obedience to God word 1 John 1:9 says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness here we go the scripture about it read is a beautiful scripture I've never preached on it I always refer to it now and again but it's a lovely scripture Isaiah 58:12 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old way places thou shall raise up the foundations of many generations and thou sh be called the the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in I just love the scripture the repairer of the breach the term breach refers to a gap or a broken Place often symbolic of broken relationships society that straight from God moral failings a repairer of the breach is someone who restores what is broken whether it's spiritual relationships whatever Believers are called to be repairers of the breach reconciling others to God 2 Corinthians 518 said all things are of God who had reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation not the ministry of cutting off others no the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world un himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation and then we are ambassadors for Christ and as though God did bese you by us we pray in Christ said be reconciled to God and this is what I'm trying to encourage you tonight to be reconciled to God regardless of your feelings your shortcomings your backslidings you have an opportunity tonight to be reconciled to God for he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so to be a repair of the breach is to be a restorer a reconciler one who addresses Brokenness and this is the final page and I'm done I have a caption here called called call there's one calling called call the children of God that Matthew 5:19 blessed are the peacemakers for there shall be called the children of God it has called by my name 2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn their Wicked Ways then will I hear from Heaven I will forgive their sin and will heal their lamb Rian 21:19 called The Bride the Lamb's wife and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vow follow of the seven last plagues and talk with me saying come hither I will show the the bride the Lamb's wine Isaiah 126 and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counselors as the beginning afterwards Thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful City and the last one I have here is called the House of Prayer Saints we cannot continue this prayerlessness look how God has blessed us even as we short him Matthew 21:13 and he said unto them it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but you have made it a den of things so friends starting tonight I hope it starts tonight that this house this Tabernacle this body could be called a House of Prayer you know sometimes I've heard testimonies of people in Witchcraft and how they couldn't attack some homes they couldn't attack some houses because they were always praying they can't attack and subvert and Destroy and affect a house in prayer may you get strengthened tonight and realize that your body is not for everybody you are not a dishrag you are not a slop you are not a a prostitute you are not in hom you want God's righteousness you want the spirit to flow through you you want God to use you you want to be a vessel of Honor you want to be something that God could put his hands on and he want wants it a certain way he pick us up how we are but we are not to remain as we are he want us cleansed and purify let's bow our heads a would to pray Heavenly Father it was such a beautiful day today to turn down the pot and to seek you and to just move away from the Flesh and now tonight called the house of God may be our deepest desire that's my desire to be a servant that are be praying day and night called a house of prayer may it be a desire for every home every family every person here under the song of my voice

have your way this evening in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen as we close Saints just want to read something to you but Brandon was speaking he was talking about how the devil hat his book of Revelation he knows that God cannot change do Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost the power of God s Mark 16 and action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is force it has to be remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it so there's a prophecy that this spirit will come to the Father the church making it how lukewarm formal and Powerless and then he says now he knows Satan knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for what she can do that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army what a word from the prophet tonight that this bride will be an invincible Army by getting a true revelation of what this true church stands for so Jesus Took a belt and beat them out of that house and say my father's house shall be called a House of Prayer
