first Peter 1 1 to 5 we have had some really powerful messages process he had overcometh shall inherit all things then perseverance let us cross Jordan and open visual manner Ephesians the restoration of access Authority and power by the sons of God Calvary with fallen man regain full access to the heritage that I am lost depth of ikana wheat and Wednesday night making claims which I feel it's very very important to read in Joshua chapter 18 verse 1 and 2 and the whole congregation of the children of Israel assemble together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the correction there while she's with now and the land was subdued before them the kingdom demons was a mess objection and they remain among the tribes the chamber is well seven tribes which have not received their inheritance next chapter from Ephesians after one let's go down to three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ what blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy I would out blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had meanness abounded towards us wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to good pleasure of it which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who look at all things after the counsel of his own will our last scripture reading from first Peter chapter 1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia elect : to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and be multiplying blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which had according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled but faded not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God true feet on the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time may God bless his word you may be seated thanks again for coming out this morning it's always great to have you here that we could fellowship a ROM the wood of God we wouldn't want to come and preach the empty benches empty pews we want to come and be able to preach to you the Word of God amen so this morning for title what inheritance has it I go what inheritance talking about inheritance from what claim and what inheritance we're speaking about and an inspiration in inheritance by predestination that's the inspiration inheritance by predestination a title again is what inheritance amen so ready for the word this morning this is the place when you come there ready to get charged up you're ready to be inspired when you leave here you must be equipped to fight the devil one more week get more tools get more training get more discipline all right so when Adam sinned by hidden is what Okemos each time this time I watch anytime and I pray go to take me all the time in her take things eternity but how I arrived with me and if you haven't listened to this message Calvary where fallen man regain full access check it out go back and listen to it again because man fell from something and we say the issue has always been about power and authority Lucifer son of the morning wanted to be like the Most High he wanted to be like God so he got injured form a coup to overthrow the Most High and then he didn't I guess you gotta boots I when he gave the boots and get kicked out he fall on the earth and the Battle of England began about love man know when he felony there was nothing there he just killing time the prince of the power the air go up people place a garden called Eden for his sons I call you have expected a baby a PPR crib well gotta pay a place in the Garden of Eden to place his sons there because he wanted somebody just like him angels it had angels all kind of thing and what created this daddy are but it was nothing like him so he said I'm gonna make man in my image and my likeness he will have my purpose and intent he's on a flash money as is a spirit man this is Genesis one so this spirit like a Miss fruit in the garden even that was Adam but then God say you know what he on earth so I have no man to till the soil I need a dustman know so go take dust and form what you sitting in right now that moves and eyes and multi-object dies by the Bible said the start and the slow I shall return what hey some does Genesis true and blow a man right there standing take this Genesis spirit man and push him in that - man and man became a living soul no wife yet no liquor no rum no whiskey no money that's Adam and I remember given the word no wife here no girlfriend yet no woman yet just the word hallelujah he was given the word that when woman come along a good teacher and share with her the word that his father is given him hallelujah and I'm known to work normally I would work and then when I'm to work not a lazy man I find that many sadder yet seen any sadder you know so when I'm could work and I know the word he ready for wife now so God put him in a deep sleep because isn't good for moms well alone Pilates a bi-product because he finished create everything already so Eve was a bipedal pilota madam and the devil watching what going on here is it mmm-hmm so when I'm going to work down that will smart you know you fool he had cut off just like that when I'm go to work he gonna use nested to Eve morning is I am you know Lucy and I running things down here go don't talk to me so what did God tell you excited because remember God didn't talk to Eve go talk to Adam Adam spoke to Eve so Adam Eve excite Lisa go savory eat of the tree of the fruit of the garden but I've seen a mrs. garden we shall not eat for today we shall surely die he say oh yeah but you shall not surely die because God know when you have all this knowledge and wisdom you'd be like what yourself she said yes and that was the beginning when Adam come home in an fall already give Adam and Adam fall and man fell creation felt everything fell a sad day but also a glad day a sad day because man fell but I grabbed it because God could lose his attributes that was locked up in him that he couldn't review before no it could be a savior no he could be a he loved no he can deliver up no he could be about ties up no literary spora no need to be a helper no we can easily make up no he could be a provider all these things looked up at him that couldn't come out it could come alone and he loves to get these things out of him so he want to give you a preacher this morning he won't believe you this morning he want to touch your family this morning you want to hear your ho you can't believe that now as well you're wasting your time notice all the services previous is actionable items not information when you say perseverance that is actionable over commit here at all things that is actionable let us cross Jordan that is actionable hallelujah Calvary when fallen man again access you want to get access that is actionable last one wins tonight making claims that is actionable because even the lemons have had to make claims so you can't tell me you hammer can only watch it watch it watch it while you're watching let me see what is yours and to understand what is yours it'll reveal to you I want to reveal to you that touches mine that is mine that is mine if you can shake your daughter on you can shake it and prayer people you can reach and touch but your mental person and prayer don't let them get away run them run prayer behind them get the string to the branch swing it the camera can't see me but I will pray for them or give the Lord a shout glory to God you have no time to waste there's an action time you can for the missus over the devil is behind you the devil is after your family he's yet to rubber to seek and destroy you know why his time is short and he understand he misses him he has no access to this book yes no access to this deed and the sons of God is about to break forth into a manifestation where we look good glory all the delica do is try to cut off perceive potential that's his job and when Moses born so he'd never seen potential kill all kill all all all you must catch him that's me he couldn't catch Moses he can't catch you he couldn't touch Jesus he cannot catch you that there was a liar he cannot catch you what protected Moses God protected Jesus God will protect you [Music] [Applause] maybe season on your job is that people with demons and them nice co-workers with Devils on them I know what is original I talked about Devils there was on them it's on the show light an amount in all of them and the smiling normal normal but they are not your friend they are not your partner they are not your body we wrestle not against flesh and blood they'll be an ignorant Christian wake up get conscious it's a war going on [Applause] [Music] maybe season and the more you make claims is the matter that ever have yet because he can't get what you want to get because what you get is already have been given you know what I'll say that what you gonna get has already been given say you've got to get it this inheritance we talking about is that God's cutting his head wondering who to give this to or glory look what this is reserved did you hear that your inheritance is reserved it I was not able to touch it it's reserved in heaven Lucifer got kicked out from dear so he don't even know what we're talking about this mornin reserve glory my god a member of Stephen hallelujah alright trying to get started here so when I'm sin by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's Word his wife reasoned which Seaton and then produced a product to Adam Adam turn loose the word so loud he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life I done lost what he lost his inheritance he lost his eternal life he lost his fellowship so if God after restore Suns back to Eden the fellowship after be restored [Music] eternal life has been restored and inheritance after restore all that Adam had not some say all sold out all a bigger one and all will be restored right back I am NOT a Pentecostal another Baptist or Methodist that too short and too small for me to be identified with that what an identified width is the sons of God the manifest of the sons of God what Adam was before the fall [Applause] my identity is with Adam before the fall because God has purpose to respond back zapman not another man the same man he bring him back whatever image was has to come back whatever I've liked this was have to come back and that man have the power you'll be seated so when he lost his life he lost his inheritance in life and then bharanam flashed us out here because he was completely supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth small G God is a God of the universe as the big G but his son had this earth under his control he could speak he could name he could say he can stop Nietzsche he could do anything that he wanted to but when he lost in his Saracens he lost all her that he lost speaking power he lost portable power he lost the authority to speak the word all Mandarin always talk in let's talk that's explaining and talking and he'd ever this laughing I that that is what he when he likes a quarterback realize I went across the Jordan and cross over he was fallen Elijah Elijah so he walk on dry ground and cross over he knows I'm about to give him back him go take not talk to begin back he know the god of Elijah the same product opa Batsy no insisted no the old man Gordon the main prophet Gordon this is a man nominated you have the mantle but he recognized a whole this thing supposed to work here I thought when I got a mantle of Avira charge recognizing my face as a mantle he charged at him and he taught me this he taught the chattels in the mantle we didn't discover is not the mantle is the god of Elijah gonna have to be with you it's not the stick had the power in in Samson poppy donut ocean fill this time it was the anointing on his stick is that Sampson pick up against an oily anointing upon him when the Spirit come upon you you can do anything you look just a devil not chasing you right now when the spirit come upon you and the devil fight in the spirit that's why the churches are dead before the devil go you get in the spirit because once you get in the spirit you are different to a small together and the spiritual upon Sampson and the spirit come upon Peter and the spirit upon this one the spirit of the car upon you you can sit there in your nasty human spirit unexpected understand and interpret was being spoken to you John was in the spirit you have to get in the spirit pool or go little bobbin the man of God in the spirit and you in this parish

something what me spiritually - because you're going to be a better man you want to be a better husband you want to be a better wife a better mother a better father you don't want to be as you are you want to be better other people to content our that is why there's no ambition to achieve because God has put ambition in people's soul to achieve for the things of God after ambition a lazy man goes nowhere because that given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance he has sitting on the bottom and then you wonder with the preacher to come that bring some wafer for you he'll say that he's had all the time the priest going in once a year once a year for them to get forgiveness for one more year but when Jesus died the veil was rent on the top to the bottom so every man have a right to access that glory that's behind the veil don't tell me a mother this I don't care what your mother is don't tell me a father this don't tell me a husband you have a right to access [Applause] [Music] the first channel of overcoming is a sub linen and stop making a choose you're wrong you're wrong you'll fall you're fall you'll fail your field stop making excuse let's take it from there it's not what happened to you it's what we do about what happened to you something is always gonna happen to you or to the Lord I show a little of an unfinished breach this DL I'm saying something will always happen to you conditions and what kind of situations will always happen to you are on you are on you buy you is not it it's what you do about what happen around you oh my so we find out a voice that who is worthy to take the book Michael Wednesday Gabriel was the only angel was there now I'm gonna step for because he was not angel God wanted what I've struck close he wanted a kinsman [Music] so Mike Alchemist I'm Rudy no no no that not for you the engine different category I want a man all my money born in sin shape iniquity but Jesus did nothing when he born in said he went on pay the price now notice he didn't say upon a very price witty cross he was not not kiss it was not crazy kind of fanatical thing he was graining and groaning in the garden agates M&E if it is possible that is authentic original behavior let this cup pass him unit cost is the price to go forward as a church as a cost some people like the free ride they said free they want to ride but it have no free ride it have a price to pay and Jesus know the cost was his own blood but this man he offered himself once sat down on the right hand of God till his enemies become his footstool but this man or this man called Jesus oh I love him this morning he made her wait for you to be here this morning he made a way for you to be saved this morning he made a way for you to redeem this morning and you are gonna get your inheritance the devil have none to get [Applause] [Music] split foot have none to get loose if I have not to get but you have your own already reserved when somebody asked what I get reserved it reserve it your name on it you should show them that one if not just Raziel with a blank you know if we serve with your name on it that mean nobody

sons of God or cattle or - oh God will take care of you [Music] [Applause] [Music] Nords this book in the hand illusion owner it's the title deed to redemption the one who have it owns it the one who have it forgive it and release it the deed itself squatters don't have deed because there's cotton they have no legal right that I get from the government for the letters of comfort but until they get

Jesus Shepton somebody's a strip he stripped him at Calvary [Applause] Maureen Oh God hallelujah Oh help me Jesus before Calvary blood of bulls and goats could only cover sins so they elected that

sins but it's more than that he died that the book the book was in is most important thing because the book held the key to produce more sons of God without that book you couldn't get back a

wrong like an optional so even which Alice I know I'm serious I know of energy all right let's continue so he took the book of redemption everything that Adam and everything he lost Christ redeemed back and if already redeemed us he already redeemed us already redeemed us but he what but he hasn't took the position yet he cannot until the time appointed and then become the resurrection that it will be renewed and so on until the appointed time all right I'll gonna skip down let's go now one of the elders said we've not the lounge habit will prevail right and a mr. Lala Eber Alam why didn't he see the lamb before the lamb had been seated on the Father's throne inside the guards and John could not see deer because if for God was God in the Tron so the lamb was sick let me show you no but you are looking drunk Tasi because the lamb was behind the guns John could not see into there he only seen those four headed for beasts and India news for cherubim standing guard in the holy place but the show it was not a natural beast the lamb because it took the book out of the right hand he mustered up on the throne notice it was a lamb Redeemer I like that word a lamb Redeemer God can never change the foolish Redeemer was a lamb in the ghana eden it was a lamb that god offered and here is again remote what did when they were found naked he kill a lamb that was represented redemption watch and here again in Revelation is again a lamb to redeem what the fallen condition befallen inheritance of her followers of people a lamb come to redeem like always was beginning to redeem us to redeem what watch what does he bring back to us Islam everything we had at the beginning I want you to see that this morning is not just a church life it's not just coming to church you know hi I'm a safe know I'm a Christian girl no no no no he redeemed everything that was lost what did we have at the beginning question eternal life we was heirs of the world we had life we never had to die we never had to be sick we never had to get all we never had any worries there was no funerals no graves no evil no death no gray here no spook shoulders no mourning no crime we have life eternal life and we had jurisdiction over all the it we were a god of the earth we could walk about the tree and if we didn't like the tree standing there we can say we plucked up here and set over here it will do it the wind was blowing we didn't warn the winds a blow peace be still and it did it and what did he come to do redeem all that back to us again and burn and say oh my get all that back again and now nature itself is groaning waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God for the sons of God to be manifested because when man fell because nature was under man Beach FL also so nature fell under the curse because man is ruler itself and what was under it fell also so nature is groaning for man to get back in position to bring it right up Oh glory to God hallelujah no yeah we have the earnest of our salvation now and can take our brother that's dying with cancer and stand with that little breath of redemption and pray the prayer of feet over him that will turn a shadow of a man back to healthy again what will we do when our full possession comes he said right now with a little breath of redemption we could pray the prayer of faith and see people healed what will happen when the full possession comes because nature was cursed with his master but when its master was Christi is the nature fell with the master but when this kinsman-redeemer come and redeem back the man that the master over nature then all nature is written for man master Oh glory to God hallelujah so when the Lamb took the book and John said we shall reign on the earth john saw that he was going to return back to the inheritance which was the earth we not supposed to be in just six dimensions floatin in heaven heaven is a hole in place until we come to the fullness of redemption that we could get back on the earth is where we belong or glory to God you believe that hallelujah part of our inheritance is sin John 14:12 the same works I do shall you do also is not right send mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe st. mark 11:23 if you shall say to the mountain be moving on talk in your heart this is what we're here for not that under Church and go back home but to manifest or redemptive rites Oh glory hallelujah glory so notice when Jesus took the book and he brought it down in ruins at 10-7 angel reveal every mystery and then what the voice said go and take the book and eat it and prophesy prophesy were gonna happen to you why you could see yourself not gonna make it any feet right why are you talking at me I'm not gonna be here you a question I'm here or delivered no you have to prophesy the word you get the prophesied the word isn't that right Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God Oh inheritance is that we can arena in the earth I'm escaping quickly you know praise God and he said now in whom Scripture after you believe after hear the word of truth the gospel of your salvation that you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession so this Holy Ghost is a down payment you get that sometime you buy the house the absolute 10% so the course called house cost a million dollars the $100,000 10% and any bank will lend us any money so the earnest holy ghost is a down payment hallelujah a down payment on your inheritance that is reserved so there is no justification for anybody to leave you sad because what is yours is already reserved nobody can take it and it tied to your name because nobody can have your name you are you I stopped the book or my never leave it is the mission of what the book is as the world is being preached you are seen an image that's nice that's nice if you have a little message go and listen back to Wednesday

whole word Redemption but random until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the Redeemer comes to claim his possession nothing can do it don't grieve it in other words he took the scripture scream not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption hallelujah he's a hole at word redemption until the day that the book of edom shall be revealed and the Redeemer comes the claim is possession nothing can do it don't grieve it don't do the thing that displeased do the thing that pleases God for the book is sealed now and you are sealed the Holy Spirit Cerf is a seal and I see you signify a finished work a seal signifies ownership I see a signifies security I see you signify you're secure same signify security to his destination Oh God nobody supposed to break that because you are sealed child of God notice this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption so the book I walk without you you are part of the book Oh God the book has seven seas and God put in the seals on you you are seven also see my seven perfect spirits or glory to God as the book was sealed with seven seals you will be sealed with

paying a tax in cones and what around went to her and was telling about the squirrels because go Thailand speak for squares let there be one day and a squirrel uh parachuted now you seem creative voice let there be if you shall say and he must se find her she said brother Brown that is nothing but the truth watch the power of seeing the right thing when she said that it pleased God so you see you should train yourself to see the right thing don't let your mother loose and it lets me loose and say where they come to your head your head could be bad say the right thing she said the right thing and the horse it was pleased and the Holy Spirit told the Prophet give her whatever she desires this is a man that have access the full power Dominion and authority God as they asked me to give Ayanna you give her whatever she desires because you are authorized you could sign the check you to Buddha you are my son I'm gonna have some more sons just like that just like that woman don't know what to ask a sister a sister no wheelchair he said your access sister to be here she be here right now if you ask for for $50,000 how much money you'll get it right now what are the ass and look at the heart of that woman I want this salvation of my two boys of my sons and I'm giggling somebody host I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ and those guys fell on the knees right there and then God save them I give them to you and he said creator works is important eternalized the same like that Adam had greater walls will be important eternal life by the spoken word or give the Lord a shout this bride will come into power hallelujah Oh glory to God amen so brother branham said Christ he said Joshua Moses brought him up to the land but did not give them the inheritance he led him up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people and Christ brought the church up to the place the way their possession was made to them and given them just Jordan the cross but the Holy Spirit is the one who said suggest in order that Joshua of the day puts the church in order given each one gives some places on position and he's the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ I've saved the Holy Spirit no we are getting over to the book of Ephesians and the same way he positionally placed the church where they belong just show up place them in a natural land and the Holy Spirit is placed in the church positionally in the land the position that they belong to so the whole book of Joshua wishes a type of Ephesians just was just replace them naturally in the land the Holy Spirit pays some people into the land the land of promise isn't that right now work the Holy Ghost was the one who came down in the upper room on the day of Pentecost and set the church in order Jesus himself couldn't do it he said I must go if I don't bought a comforter will not come so when Jesus left the Holy Ghost came down to get each one of them and they were born into the kingdom of God hallelujah but abarim said we are promised a corner ocean ten Malakai for look something thirty that there will come a Ephesians at this that there must come and Ephesians so even though the Bible said loud this year and so on after that God's promise and Ephesians which is a hidden mystery right in front the devil's face he don't you know that he don't understand when he shall turn the heart of the chair and back to the face of the father's Mimi came back and pick up Ephesians say there's going to be another Ephesians church another apostolic church and that church was like Joshua Oh glory to God hallelujah cuz we give the Lord a shout hallelujah and he said there must come a Ephesians that these Sevenfold mysteries of the Word of God must be unfolded understand the loudest an age that this takes place I we are here I believe we are right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and as Joshua just before the Ephesians raised up so there's John the Baptist raised up just before the next Ephesians and we are promised and not Ephesians it is predicted here in the Bible a lot of ministers don't notice but this is the promise not Corinthians not Hebrew babies not the Corinthian church not Galatians Oh hallelujah but a real Ephesian Church where you understand that you are predestinated unto adoption God predetermined that you're gonna make it the devil can't stop you you are gonna make it because God purpose that's peaceful Oh glory to God you're falling down you get back up your slide your front side the backside your front right side Oh glory to God you fall down you're bounce right back up Gabriel can't keep your dog why you are predestinated Oh glory to God we for knew he called who we call it justified who we justified he already glorifying what more shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us or God will fight yourself be patience with your own self and be patient with God he has service with you yet did ever want to tell you God finish with you that's a lie that's a lie Oh glory to God plan somebody God is still working with on me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so will we not present topics we are preaching a vision that's the difference a lot of ministers depression topics publisher discussing topics and talk about we're not talking topic we're talking about a vision and when you get a vision right any topic of fittin because you have the entire vision you have to have a vision if they don't have a vision of the house they were sick son you go see cement you will see gravel you will see all kind of thing all you see this material and they discuss in your preaching the name the material you see the steel and he pushes a making steel then they go to the gravel there's good eating and they got rocks and break it up and then it'll gravel here and next master could be on on cement or the mix cement and so on that is just information and immaterial but when you see the hose you understand how to mix in semen turn this steel to put it in box in the pod is to concrete it's not cement I discussing you know is concrete cement sand and gravel will make something called concrete so you like a spiritual scientists taking the materials that God put and fitting it together to stop a seventh under revival so you get butter with other people talking this and talking that you not comfortable materials you have a vision of the hopes that court must build when Solomon had that vision he sent for materials all over the world and there was no need ever saw Hanna it was so clear it was so clean that when Solomon first billet or glory of God it was so good only one thing was missing a strange-looking stone it was a stone that the builders didn't recognize but that was the key stone that was the capstone that was the cornerstone or glory look good I went that stone fitting position the glory was ready to come down and one of these days everything will fit just right fit virtual knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness just right tongue become the glory hallelujah so we're not preaching topics on material we take any building material and show you the building showing you what you have to become showing your way you are going while you're gonna get there and its power it takes to get there listen to what he said you may be seated national force but Israel and homeland but they believe the power of God to put the people in the bride if the mysteries could I put on my bride really bright long time but is it the power the mystery bring the world inside are you the world inside are you but I would have to be telling the power and the only way I could tell the power is the spirit of the come or glory that God Jesus couldn't claim his ministry outside this world Jesus was born in son of God he knew his position he understood he was about his father's business after 28 years years even led to come out and say I I can preach no before tears coming Hannibal ba Jesus i person is he so closely demons by Jesus so Jesus couldn't calm us 28 or 29 a feeling preacher's boy trouble I always do that which pleases my father so he it's 30 he was ready for his tree and a half years ministry hallelu when he started off hot sweaty oh he was sick and doing all this turn water into wine and people started following Messiah one time three thousand one times five thousand crowd getting big anybody follows Messiah and Jesus trying to work he said my always got yet come did you hold me the key holder before type you always not yet come you never have to pull you down before time here I got permission to pull you don't so tell him upfront my always not yet come your destination is rapture your destinations change the body your destination is that you over yonder Oh glory to God we shall not all sleep somewhere but not all or either God you alive and remain or glowing of God I don't want to tribulation since no I'm talking about Raptor material right material tribulation Saints them remaining because I didn't accept that two minutes fullness they didn't accept before blood there was trying some kind of legalistic thing to make it through when you look at the blood of Jesus is not what you have done is what he has already done it's how you accepted his forgiveness how you accepting his pardon how you accepting his grace to your life and stop saying that you're not worthy and you're not worthy that killing your feet God God can't deal with you on you're not what do you think oh god it's time you know you're not worthy nobody s worthy the lamb alone is worthy but the lamb come and putting that take that book and leave an inheritance and all you want to know how the inches go on the you to see is is have the engines of your inheritance even David said the Lord shall perfect that but concerned at me David didn't make no mistake David makes the words easy the Lord will perfect that much considered hallelujah the Lord will perfect that's where she considered me I have to go to perfection or glory there God more fiction not no more hands on oh man the game tie up like at the fivefold ministry what does in Ephesians 4 is go perfect the Saints in that flat we are the told some brothers already you have to say Ephesians 4 the fivefold ministry as revealed by the prophet of malachi for all m Pentecostal Nollan people talk about fight for ministry is not that no manner perfect any sense its Christ's ministry doing that no man can perfect the Saints so hold on to this man hold on today's man which man is talking about voluntary man Christ Jesus is the Ministry of Jesus Christ [Music] I don't know why I'm saying all this today listen the seven angel messenger baram says could only open six seals not seven six he said it is all to be gathered up into the revelation of the Son of Man so brother Branham seventh messenger open six because Christ is his seventh seal and has gotten up no Son of Man in him then son of man in him said come to the unveiling of the mighty god that was not brother Branham that was Jesus Christ beginning to unveil himself and subtle knew some mysteries in this message that is only for the bride or get the lure - Oh glory so then Jesus ministry in the Prophet began to preach about who is much acidic future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride that was Jesus revealing mysteries inside earlier or glory know God that Jesus has to come back because he know what he revealed and he know what was being spoken I wasn't brother Branham he said I am NOT the Sun man he said I wasn't the man that came on River that day that was the son of man that was a pure fire I am a Solomon revealing this Hanuman I am NOT the Solomon in the early part of his ministry he said I represent defeat by way of a design gift the gift was representing the faith the faith didn't come into him yet he said I represent the faith by the way of a divine gift but one day that angel happened to him he wasn't representing the fact he was the fake the faith wasn't him the faith is Jesus Christ or tell the Lord our show [Applause] [Music] Laurie glory hallelujah see I want to finish off you hallelujah glory to Gordon and Laurie so there's no fraudulent message this will make sure we don't miss it and errors in it who get to off they have to get you off but the Braddock attempt

sick person they get healed this is he quit them power this is pretty Otunga speaking unknown tongues speak another language altogether there's the power of God we talking about how many want it home and reside Oh glory to God hallelujah you may be seated Jesus told them this comforter that's gonna come he's all with you but he shall be in you he was saying I am a comfort note to you but I am the Word made flesh but the comfort that gonna come to you will be the word made spirit in you so now the comforter is with you but he shall be in you and I doubt that you shall know I'm in the father here me and you because my spirit will be inside of you I'm gonna wrap up what are you fighting for what do you have to fight for you have to fight for what you know is your own now that statement is very profound for believers to understand the grass because if you don't believe is yours you wouldn't fight for it you're looking for a fever the grace of God it just got have mushi upon me and you can fight for nothing oh this channel Israel did is not like somebody you know like they they work for this land that God give them go tell Abraham microprose I'd sooner bring them out and get my land God hotel Abram all that already is a land they didn't they didn't work for all he tell them is every place you put your foot is yours in ours thankful then Philistines fool on that land squatting all yep they're moving just so move please are gone are gone gone me as far as the concern I hear only your for the signs you live with you're born with it influences in your life as part of your nature that not giving up dice unfair that is why fear when map beyond is really no because he taught this table unto him and the devil door ready to leave you belong to Christ and the devil understand that he live alone thing he still believed he had access to you that's why you have the cause of all the doors in your life and back doors in your life that the devil don't have access by doors that you leave open in your life or give the Lord a show go to where that coming from but they just coming out hallelujah hallelujah things that do things you say how you act leave a door then the devil step

strongman [Applause] [Music] how do I get over here how could you make claims when you are not short as yours how could you make claims when you are well the greaser Gordon origins you know I did this I remember a long time them some brothers when the back style of something happened in life every time you meet them five is a they still talk about that and because so many preachers have this pleasure of knowing that they saw and they keep seeing yourself Sue and your new boy a backslide welcome back now and about is that what forgive you or whatever if God forgive me you're free you know you could run out wrong wrong wrong in church who want a laugh there's a business when he will manatee well got spoken to here and you know and say come see a man who told me all that I did she wasn't

a bird that testify and tell everybody who the son of man set free is free indeed or Gloria laughs but I'm free yeah but I could show ya but I could push it my god [Applause] [Music] so don't look at anybody pass because you don't know what God did for them last night come on oh don't talk about somebody last year you don't know what happened to them last night and I will tell you don't study your pass study or future study where you're going he passes where you come from way according to destination your pass is Egypt but the destination is came a man destination is Ephesians destination is

inheritance is what inheritance the one he died foreign people [Music] what inheritance hallelujah praise God so listen is you that's why go tell Joshua marriages on the word denied that word merited is not a read that would Magister ponder to think to think deeply to let it absorb your mind and your thinking because it meditated it change in your thinking oh that is oh boy distinct yeah yeah you distinct one way but your thoughts are not my toes your way is not my ways see that's your thoughts but when he's got a stinking meditate you've started get only thoughts of God begins a drop down upon you Oh hallelujah so he tell Joshua for you to have good success say good success notices in tell Joshua success good success so God doesn't want to just to succeed where you have good success you want to exceed and beyond good success marriages under day or day and night and if you do that no man shall be able to stand before thee all the t's of their life so when man sat on fall and man Saturday just Ricola hold is the wait a minute that is not what God told me we are supposed to have one funeral fellas can kill any land so when I'm pleased that I gotta lick up he said no stop hole

brittany.brittany Lord captivity Lord keeping spoils for the Lord you say thought everything do even touch everything they have there is dangerous people because it's God's covenant and principle you know he's breaking laws when you break laws certain things activate alter the control of other things so you don't want them you want them to be blessed glory to God I'll show you something Joshua attitude was one of possession not profession professionals when you have the confession of the word God said this court said but when they come to actionable items what you must do know you can make things right you could forgive you could pray you could press actionable items you could be a participator insulations are onlooker you can worship you could raise your hands you can say Amen you could do that I think you could do that is your mechanics all that you can do and let him send young dynamics upon all that you can do are you doing you all [Applause] [Music] because lighten up any bank easy to get a pension money by you nobody yet fortuigence service think about it is a mindset and this better intention you could take a bunch of money on Barack an adult and Tablas and stefania

of jacket and blessing I'll multiply the multiply the you will add to you he will multiply two or give the Lord I shall don't be afraid have faith musician come please woo know in the last days we are given to understand by the word that we are going to understand it because it will comment Ephesians each to it you see what coming onto the Jordan meant we are down here now let us cross over now let's quit playin let's cross the other side now hear me Church yes cause it all belongs to us it is all ours them fishes never filled they can't feel because they come from God I believe with all that is within me we are not the Harlem that will run back into the wilderness we will cross Jordan the separation there in say God brick to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people inheritance that God left for them so the seven thunders on the back of the book is the means by which a cross over to get your inheritance the seven thunders really reveals debtor self Oh hallelujah it's not something to say I have it you don't have it no I see it therefore I could die I could surrender to God I think I want to I want to read this year and I close to this is paradox but I'm talking the translation mind spoke in tongues and a man interpreted because there was chosen the hard way because that was chosen a narrow path the hard way that's a choice there's always the easy way you could be a free thinker you do your own thing you hide your duck you have known yourself in ministry and you're not seeking advice or counsel young listen this because that was chosen a narrow path the hard way that was made walk of your own chosen in other words I didn't have to do it I can side in and go with them if I want to but I see I wanted to steam with the wood is God speaking that was picked the Karaka precise decision it is my way if you notice he said because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee now that's what I wondered when I died would it be then have the thing F is the portion of the different portions to us up there heaven is the kingdom of heaven that's within us that one all waits for no watch what a glorious decision that was made this in itself is that wish given may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine hallelujah oh my can I continue a little bit but upon say continue here a signal no they go what you make it do so I just are the continuous oh thank you question there's a man a debt go to heaven or to hell immediately or do they wait the judgment you see that's a good question now God got to keep his word he can't do nothing else but keep his word he said you're born in sin shape in equity commonly well speaking lines so you were born you are sinner by nature so there's nothing in the world you can do about that there's nothing I could do to save myself or you can do to save yourself it's what Christ did for us okay now this sinner has got to stand judgment and there won't be but this judgment is like a sickle listen carefully it's like a circle a rainbow around the world of the blood of Christ so he said right now there's a circle around the world it's a blood of Christ okay now if God could look down on the earth in this condition tonight any other way down through the blood of Earth he would destroy it in a second so the blood of Jesus is cyclical it God has seen the earth through the blood of Jesus that is where the judgments is coming if a man under here no matter if the man is a drunkard a gambler a horrible unbeliever the mercies of God still have tones for him right now that's how you could testify to anybody you could share the world with anybody come eat whatever it is because the Moose's of God now still have tones for them why the pump of the blood is around the earth could I continue and a woman she might be a prostitute whatever the blood of Jesus still atones for her SoDo right nobody off you don't have that authority let's continue but the minute that her soul leaves this body and she goes beyond that she is passed from mercy in the judgment so as long as their lives of a chance because the bond bumper is around here once the dinosaur pass that they exposed this judgment do you get that so you can say this one can make it down one can make it no the police here that's why you should forgive because the blood is still there you can see my blood cast on this one I'm a black cat take this one you can talk that talk so watch once her soul leaves the body she passed an over mercy in the judgment go already judge her that's a flick she's done she's judged you judge yourself by the way you treat God's procreation there for your sins you judge yourself you don't judge him just enough to forgive you if you think if you think he'll forgive you confess your force and he will forgive you but when we die we die now we go directly into the presence of Almighty God in a celestial body if I would meet brother Neville up there if we both die now in that hour from now and on all from now I will meet him and say greetings by the nettle and talk to him I couldn't shake his hand he's in a celestial body I could talk to him he looked just like he does know I look like I do but we could talk to one another but we couldn't touch one another because we haven't got any of the five senses of ctess feel smell and hear but we would be immortal and we could see one another we would live in the bless of realms over the altar of God now when Jesus which is in us now in the form of the Holy Ghost when his celestial body the Holy Spirit returns with the glorified body we will be glorified with him in his likeness and then I will shake his hand and say here it is but a Nevel jesus told His disciples taken the communion I will eat no more of the fruit of the vine until I eat it and drink it with you a new in my father's Kingdom there it is so a justified person standing in the presence of God goes into his presence as an immortal being and lives in the realm of the blessed the blessing Ram of peace until the day returns now when the people didn't go into the presence of God when they died there was once a time that didn't go in presence of God that was the Old Testament they went into a place called paradise where their souls just waited in paradise but paradise was a place where God kept the souls in dreamland until the blood of Jesus was shed for the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin it only covered sin but when he died at Calvary on his return he brought out the grave those dead scenes that had died under the atonement of blood on bulls and goats and they entered into the city oh my as I often said you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world so every day you're walking through life underworld influence coming up above world influence coming down here we go this is important if you are influenced from here above you are from above your celestial body is written up there but if you are wicked and hypocritical and indifferent your celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think is up there because the fruit that you bear before people proves where you're from are you ready so you are here what you are somewhere else that is deep that is deep that is deep your life you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here oh praise be to Jesus hallelujah what kind of inheritance he predestinated according to the purpose of him who look at all things he said no watch you see Abba Father here we begin to come we destinated us to inheritance in him which was predestinated we inherited listen before the foundation of the world inherited by predestination he said I inherited something what what inheritance Jesus had to be they had to be somebody leave something for me Jesus left you an inheritance he said beg your pardon Jesus never left the inheritance jesus never left you an inheritance he gonna come down appeared for your inheritance [Music] your inheritance he came down and paid for your inheritance and brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on a Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you an heritance your inheritance came first I'm gonna close hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah your inheritance came first it's resolved no devil to touch it your sins can affect it your life can't cancel it it is reserved may the Lord bless you [Applause]
