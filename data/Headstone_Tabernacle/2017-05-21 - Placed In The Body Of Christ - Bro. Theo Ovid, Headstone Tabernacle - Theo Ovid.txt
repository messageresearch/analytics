Amen god bless you amen Nadia seeds appreciate Lord this morning or we feel its presence if it is present in joy or hallelujah but after the dancing that song this must be you middle way I love that

reconciliation and we are grateful and thankful we appreciative of Christian love to work there what else could we do but worship Him and praise him we are so undeserving but the Bible said Noah the sons of God give us this good opportunity in this final end enough time to be a witness of Jesus Christ him being the same yesterday today and forever so we have some serious very question we want to take this right after the service we want to go in the wood now so that's all stand we want to say happy Buddhism by the Stephen Oliveri so any after service give them a big hug and quick returns were placed with a fever let there be the name of the Lord so this morning we want to go to Bible the two portions of Scripture Ephesians 4 and Colossians chapter 1 1 a welcome each and every one here this morning welcome all those connected to us live on the internet and those that put here on our YouTube channel headstone tomorrow YouTube channel god bless you trust them that this message this morning will be a defined value and shrinky you to face and deal with the battle at Achilles head Ephesians 4 risen from verse 4 there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one feet one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but our the unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ when it in the Colossians chapter one going to read from verse twelve to nineteen given thanks unto the Father which had made us meet to be partakers of inheritance of the scenes in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is in the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so by him all things created in heaven and that is visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things are created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should also this dwell let us pray one more time father we thank you for your word with your comment interpreted to our hearts may be a true lamp tore feet and a light on toe pads and we're shining righteous instead of people may great deliverance signs one of the miracles they wrote today confirm the wood with signs and wonders we ask in Jesus name Amen amen you may be seated you sit down give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] keep your Bibles close to you we want to read an extra shortly but before that I wanna give the title and the title is pleased in the body of Christ our subject many members one body I'll have an inspiration rebuilding the church by the spirit okay many members one body rebuild that is by the spirit I want to go into first Corinthians up to 12 and I want to reform verse four let's go read in Chapter 12 everybody fine it King now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit there are differences of administration's but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all and the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit without for one to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another feed by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these work it that one the cells in spirit divine and each man severally as you will for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body so also is Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many and if the foot shall say because I am NOT the hand I am NOT of the body is it therefore not of the body under the air shall say because I am NOT the eye I am NOT of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body one I wear with a hearing if the whole body was hearing where would the smellin but now God had set the members every one of them in the body as it had pleased him and if there were all one member where were the body but now are there many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you need much more those members of the body which seemed to be feeble are necessary are you with me for those members of the body which we think to be less honorable God upon these will be so much abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but got a tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked that there should be the purpose is that there should be no schism in the body and that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one mum one member suffer all the members suffer with it one one member be honored all the members rejoice with it know ye are the body of Christ and members in particular may God bless his word oh praise his wonderful name hallelujah praise God so we tank over the scripture reading Ephesians 5 50 says for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones we are actually members we have one body and we are hands we are feet we have ears and eyes and so on it's not one member isn't a body but many members in that body so too is the body of Christ and Christ and that Christ's body will have many members so many members buddy is not right and you have to be placed in that body now whistling Joshua now we still in Ephesians we still in the land of promise where you have to drive the enemy out and come into your possession to possess what you know is your own you cannot possess if you don't know what is your own therefore what is your own has to be revealed to you and then that gives the faith to go and possess now go don't want to observe the land watch the land God want you to possess the land that is why God tells just what all this is the men go out and go to the land and come and bring a description of the land the description is evidence you've been through the land you cannot describe what you did not see you cannot describe what it is an experience the fact that just relax our description mean these guys walk through the land and God want you to walk you your land you have to know your scriptures you have to know your promise that's why Jesus could go to the land and find the place where it is written the Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me he had the famous scriptures where a Branham had to find Malachi for Luke 17 13 is not right revelation 10 7 you have to find a scripture and we get anointed though when he began to discover it he didn't manifest the scriptures just yet but he was connected to it he had to believe I am that my gosh Scripture he had to believe I am that Elijah that was prophesied yes believe the spirit Elijah is appointed you have to believe that Oh glory to God yet I look back and see he was that seven angels messenger he had to look in the scripture and see he would reveal the Son of man that was his picture what about your scripture these signs shall follow them that believe that's your scripture he has and a half of the true impact of a ton of others that's your scripture the spirit and the bride say come that's your scripture the same work I do shall you do also that's your scripture you a scripture also thank you have to begin to believe an annoying Oh hallelujah glory Nevada Dalila all right thank you Jesus killing evil nor run no whiskey no smoke no ganja no cigarette brothers growing up and God say come and worship me let me see your revelation of who I am King what's ours he ever got this blood God confirmed it as revelation and reject the king but in that rejection got with the door he said King if you do like your brother just follow because he has revelation just follow him if you do what he does I'll bless you the scene could be given a lot a shout in the house so even if you don't have a revelation you could do like others who have revelation and get the same blessing for the Brenham and the only way that one was received could have done anything different um his brother it was revealed to him and Hebrews 11 said by Saint Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than of came with God testified he was righteous just the offering of the sacrifice God give testimony so that's a righteous man demanded I could do anything just bring a sacrifice and go set up and righteous see the seed of evil Oh hallelujah praise God blessed is the man that God will impute righteousness or glory the body man without wealth do you understand when God pronounced you are right now you are right because that's the pronouncement of God you have to change that your sins can change that what your family did can change that what your father my mother pregnant mother did establish that that's a pronouncement of good will get a lot of shows in the house I want to free you from your path leave and what the devil told you free you from what your family did forget about it [Applause] that's why Jesus said who does men say i the son of man are they talking talking talking what they saying about me some see your son the Baptist some see or something he lasts until you're dead some say that he says who do you say I am and they got caught following a man to clean our fears the deloria is a nice man is a good man he does new miracles he'd be moving different he have a higher level higher authority who is this man over sudden Peter Siddhartha Christ Son of the Living God and then Jesus a flesh and blood has not revealed it to you you then read it in a book you didn't get my email you're gonna get my text nobody I was talking to you flesh and blood hath not revealed unto you but my father in heaven had revealed unto you ah here we go here we go no and upon this rock I will build or glory no God not not this past upon the bill I will build my church and a column the Colossians is a head of the body all the church so the church is Christ's body the real carriage the true church upon this rock or porous we are crystal and good structure they are passive and vegan but not what he's talking about he then says a man will billet upon this rock what that rock upon this revelation that means he has to reveal himself upon this rock I will build my church not upon the information come on now not upon the knowledge come on now but when the Spirit revealed to you I don't care what the devil used to be trapped this morning you could be the hell hole this morning but if God revealed themselves to you the dead butter did ever have to give up to put away it comes because who the tournament free is free indeed of course they're issues that's a boss of issues in your life that's what he came for he can't be heal the sick he came to set the captive free he came to bring the villa repellent along became to open the wine that got to be somebody's like that gotta be somebody drown that probably somebody even for that that'll be a death prize hold of him there's gotta be somebody that God can work on [Applause] let me seated there gotta be an obstacle there gonna be a red chief to gonna hear me they've gotta be obstacles there's gotta be a war on chemical and we could know that God could bring down the walls that's why that's why there was a Jericho that we cannot save in a lab is Glock admit impossible possible yes yes yes what could open up the Red Sea what to make away there is no way you're gonna sleep this morning you're gonna have a say to believe for yourself that you want to get out your condition you're gonna get off your segment you're going to gather your situation even appreciated with you this morning Oh glory to God give the Lord a shout I don't care what's in your home what's wrong you I don't know what messing with your husband but messing with your wife I look at what listen to your mind right now [Applause] [Music] [Applause] remember an ammonia kicked out the gardening they got kicked out but that means of evil from getting revelation because sons and daughters are you ready have the ability to hear I'm God without anybody in between we preach the word but we can reveal the word we preach the word but the Holy Ghost is the revealer what we preach so you're hearing it but baguette dropped amicus tear your couldn't hear me keep did not yell me this morning if you're not you'll be shouting then we are preaching this morning the word between me and you the wood coming out but the Spirit is hanging over let me see them that's why Hebrew says the word didn't profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith to them that said it so even though two million was Aaron Moses is only Joshua and Caleb had divine revelation after what to possess so it's not the multitude Emily Jesus always mixed is the election is the multitude that could catch divine revelation I knew by inspiration young-min this morning Oklahoma in the spirit world did we didn't understand it when Jesus was walking on the water and Peter said Lord is that you bid me to come Jesus said one word come if I had a choice I still write it but getting frightened by the second we had a choice even whereas the Lord of Musa pon me Lord in the name of Jesus Lord sanctify me another way will be to walk this world no he didn't go down the parameter mode he just said what would come and he stepped up he stepped out and he gets a walk just like Jesus giving us to walk on the water just like Jesus it was Jesus it must be the obeying Jesus and if God tell you walk this morning walk ah oh my let me do it Oh some of you weakened here the walls come down before yourself he didn't tell them that he said shout something was up when I did you the show don't buy the tumor the doctor de Gama humor so great a doctor pay irises so then the doctor give up on you but don't give up on God [Applause] levena when you could shot before I was coming on the prove your feet when you could stagger not at the promise of God on the leaf but strong giving praise to God and you do have evidence of that trial a better speed when you could tell you that is not the test at the hem of a garment and push between men legs and push men outside I'm pressed and push and push the cart or get got to walk it over the loss of breathing people talk talk talk but when the time come to apply your faith your situation doctors when it matters I might be some everybody inside of here because there's no other Christ may be seated upon he shows up in my church he said blessed are thou Simon John but Jonah flesh and blood never reveal to you my father which is in heaven has revealed to you upon this rock I'll build my church what what does it profit the true revelation of the way there is The True Vine again in up to Revelation is a false revelation it's a revelation I have intellectual reasoning as I said Thursday night a bunch of Ministers know how to call them ticklers they are not aesthetically here's the people and they are silly women leading with divers lusts happily is itching he a new doctrine new teaching new evolutionary devil just have it for them because I don't want to hear it will ring right because if it will ring you have to be careful they don't want to prepare for it you if you know it will have dynamics the Holy Ghost is about to pour out you cannot make preparations for it because faith which is revelation brings preparation brings expectations for the manifest do you see it Abraham got a revelation Isaac of Syria God did not I love what God that he did not talk to Sarah so Sarah have no encouragement for Abraham Abraham I'm back you me many men save a cantina even Sarah Hauer all horrors because his old woman a couple faith to believe in this power that Abram testifying about but God told Abram to Sarah when Terra Cotta to believe she introduced Abraham to Hagar she had a interpretation with a belief but Sarah so Abraham can rely upon zero absolute a boxer because my wife a encouragement is that right in which Bible you find nothing this one this I encourage myself you have not seen nobody in Sigma that's that's cool nobody ain't call me that's cool you recall anybody you have to do better than that got to be rugged you have to believe God design you for this hour you have to see more weapon for Mackenzie were prosper you have to be when you walk Deborah's trembling you have to believe that that's your Scripture no man howdy able to stand before thee all the days of thy life hallelujah so you're not going expecting defeat you expecting victory every time if the feet come you deal with it if you fall you get back up the dustpan sir does address the Duster floating they get back up and the compassionate ring again because you supposed to win this fight and if they'd ever see you gonna pass up you can no devil you win this one but not coming back because my god is awesome my god is real Oh glories of God hallelujah praise Oh hallelujah glory of God amen like the eleven demon are caught about a man that was barren and God David bottle David have you consider his end don't let that prosperity fool you forget that it's a race be running I will all come out the finishing line oh praise God could use this continuous or Abril by see what is fate we keep seeing this we're gonna get on with it what is fit say is something that's revealed to you that is not yet what you believe it will be Oh or get a single unit now see it is a revelation of the will of God I want to put something on to that the will of God to you not the church will of God well we'll have got to come to service this morning because don't do investigation in step together that s final scripture I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a mix of the words God will speak to you above you because there is not given for somebody for you get is given to you you tell any of it you can believe for others they cut the hole the hole that we surveyed long I perceive you have said to be healed right up and walk in the name of Jesus the man have faith inside of him is that right so you have to look for God revealed you his will because once you connect to the will of God for your life and you do it you're free when you like a famine time to a woman with a woman bake me a cake first because God told Elijah I have a word a woman death of CDD it's family and I ordained a woman to feed you he has died in how a girl look and what he thinking in his mind and what kind of fight imagine that you know God say I ordeal a widowed woman to feed you that is the anointing I release upon her that is the power I believe upon she doesn't know it became ordained she's sick for that she built for that she can make a good day she could pick something just right for this man of God hallelujah so where he get the word from the Lord I ordained this woman to feed you when he come there he was famine he have baked me a cake pan no God out to work on both sides this man is anointed he know the will of God he know that woman clever this woman is he interested because of a son yeah the last bit oil now the last but the flour he was thinking but the last meal but this marathon comments he forget he but gospel because he was yelling from God he got a revelation that a genuine man of God look at the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] you may be seated and when that woman learn share a choice on the old man I am making a big for you is me and my son and my take on that but when she turns to obey pass see the world your power not gonna Donnell you only want to not pay until rain fall upon me my god I can see a woman when you dip a flower keep it for plower when she did she was a masala a little too much water beneath Emma flower the mixed up with water you don't know Sophie Sophie mixture ready Deborah was over there and you get your power there when we did never we put you there never reset this there are the knowledge and

Brook movement and then the friends that I let down the friends yeah I think I don't remember say all your sick going like a doctor they know that they're coming for that they've let down that man because of the healing is there the pillar of fire is here they know power is here they know supernatural and spear in the manifested son is there you know Jesus Christ with him yesterday [Applause]

revelation of the will of yard I shall not die but live that teams are passing all around hey go go go take a trip I'm going to your scripture I shall not die but live because I still have a testimony

their wife and all kind of nonsense and I call it nonsense we ties what they think about the church my daughter teaches means he is head of the body called the church not I am here he is head another

don't leave in spirit a revelation they believe in the dogmatic teaching of some system so the people are very proud to testify what they believe and to tell you what we do believe you same thing about a sermon what I preached in captivity no rapture as I never know what teaching is erupting I thought was faith and virtue and knowledge I thought was the life that God is taking up we could knock that he say you have to be magnetized to the headstone so any magnet past Magna picking up wood and stone and people the magnet taken what is magnetized to it so they have a magazine in you when

to put his foot to see if his shoe size could put in you want to give him his shoes you have to be able to end into the person suffering that is how you could three for somebody that's why sometimes

could be embedded and pitaya that person definitely their shoes are not sitting on criticize and complain about a walk it was me I was gonna walk so I am not like that sinner outside I come to church

small compared to the Blues on task he has to save the world I'm not hearing you Harmon is coming no one knows about it you may be seated Georgia had the gift to interpret dreams because quad is a

under a bad luck I think you're under the wrong teaching you know you could you could imagine Oh David don't you Joseph he's dead but he was working but Allah Baker Baker condemned but Allah restored he tells the but Allah remember me but it but I'm not going to remember him because the time is not yet when the time is right what your favorite dream that he can remember you understand and then Pharaoh call only wise then the cynicism come and tell me ten minute upon your dream this television is a carryover degree I know yeah then they say we can to Dadri we need to dream the interpreter he saw your project or lack of a time we have cut all ahead oh I didn't say my Wiseman all you see all these white men only shown your spiritual only story in beating volume in mystery what is gonna take common now so tell me my dream and mental attitude [Music] not only I forgot all you I'd run in the country now where they pick up to this valley wise men and now just get caught up in that whole move just K : there's a god that reveals secrets all the whole whole whole given and then what happened it unfold it reveal a next million to zip is promoted to be next to fear famine in all the land Russian hungry but you never go to Egypt it live next to fail Joseph is demand or what happened they had to come all do this that I am Joseph your brother whom you sold then then then listen to his mommy's invoice God sent me ahead he didn't get nearly kill me I needed an attorney in order to harvest although we could no meat for you no he didn't talk the way he said God send me ahead to preserve life now what you're hearing is the right spirit what you're hearing is the Christ attitude what you hearing is what we're supposed to be hearing like oh god children you don't know God allowing there's a higher purpose as long as you stay along what this one do on that one do you miss the will of God you miss the vision of God this is Samson Samson back slavery Delilah doesn't I doubt whether the higher purpose be ila go I want to play stance with the high knee and any lines want to take all three thousand villas then that's always like kind of a 10 here a 2 here is 3000 oviduct go I want to deal with them in a big way so God's entrance into a process positionally plays him he said once more Lord and now your power this is the Sun on the line he's better than revelation there wasn't permanently back sitting back to the lorry temporary go over you don't let me back appreciating father don't let me not appreciate this morning back slidden is only temporary [Applause] I have no tumor and bathroom and God check that out yes is that a yes sorry another son it was always our son God how did liver David goryl delivered Solomon all my other issues do oil but it was sons back to the temporary you know because never can ever come for you you didn't get that one when Israel backlight is all Gotham King Nebuchadnezzar stated in with the captivity and then they will cry and Bowl and then go comma deliver them that go sturdy by the god bless them did power on a continent glory after while the Hydra coal but I get cold pressure then they back side they get lukewarm they get cold and then some king comma Babylon and that's how to punish them until they repent what we tell here decry city but it wasn't crying you know they was wicked my Pharaoh you have been a condition and you're looking for Pharaoh because you're not complaining you know desperate is losing but then when they got set up and you get tired but you begin to grow in your spirit Lord this is not the way to live this another Christian life this is not the way for me to walk and talk and be here why I am Kirsten why I'm doing this why I'm doing this contrary to the word and your will this is not right what I'm trying to done to you then you can save your cry come and don't know to deliver I've given a special scissors praise got a big enough special function to get them demons over your life Oh hallelujah have to know it happened right now somebody's been delivered right now I'm believing that somebody going free right now the reason that somebody did here right now I'm believing that Oh glory to Baba the common expect the supernatural Oh glory to God amen hallelujah oh my my my my my Oh glory to God watch for the Brandon Robert Paul Paul the pillar fire hit down Paul's sort of a soil and he was fighting the church fighting the revolution everything else and he didn't know he was seed all you know he tell us for the Pharisee doctrine ego has found his concern this church is a crazy church for this man called Jesus so there is poor soil rather right on his high horse pillar fire nothing more funny but what the Lord right away he know will de Paul only knew in by revelation Peter knew in by revelation he walked with him talked with him therefore you can set this wood now I've said that he was the word a scholar can set down listen carefully and read that word till I just tie a mine up in anyway if he wants to bad smart brilliant and so on he's a real train collision can do that but I practice perseverance he make you think you don't know nothing but the only way you are seized is to know him by revelation if I can take the presbytery induction and kalpeni console up till II don't know I can see the battle doctrine and show you finally got several million things you don't know nothing else that's right but that is not his church so being able to expose scriptures and teaching and Thai people about magnetic energy are you ready his church is himself revealed it's not a building it's not a room of people this church which is the price is really Christ's lowest price is God revealed the church is quite revealed so the church really reveals Jesus right Christ is the mystery of God revealed so so so that's why you hear me say often about right division like a dream and that the word as a big intern for supposed to bring clarity not more confusion and when you see the real vision the prophetic vision the real core of the message the rest is filler material and I compared to somebody giving you a gift in a bag nice booty bag and have those people are wrong it and this is a drink or something like that the bag is not a gift the people are wrong it is not against is the steadiest the paper I wrong it is filler material so even though here it looks nice the real thing is in the middle that's what it's about the Jews have their place at the principle choose and talk about Jews and all about Jews but that doesn't help me I just talked about those Angelis that doesn't help me I talked about the Pope that doesn't help me there are many things in the scriptures that is what God said but doesn't apply to you I have about the tribulation now what vials in other world wars and I world wars have all kind of stuff inside idea but what we want is the promises that become effective to up the face the challenge that is in our lives and to face the challenge that is yet before because a develop student still the devil is open up its treasures the Lucius on the earth when we're around here had the people I mean that hell has been delivered Bella uncovered and streams of demon bones pouring out but doing so much more with virtual reality knowledge television abiram says when is that the woman and not it's on the television so they're puttin avenues and channels with demon powers the computer witches and witch doctors and all your children story and all kind of stop the pushing inside of that the poison people man Oh hallelujah are you with me you're all the fools on all if I help break down the human body break down the human mind oh yes yes yes yes yes so but Ron says we are striving to enter the kingdom of God before these big strike I hope you get Britain you know oh they got Britain of the world you know because we have children's we have grandchildren we are family and so on and we see these eases and destruction and all kind of things come in for the bottom dollar what adopted sons pushing back this and pushing back that and stopping diseases and stopping cancer because it will be necessary to do it because he doesn't have a mission to kill all Oh hallelujah are you with me he want to destroy your life oh praise be to Jesus but the balance says here he said someone said to me when I come out of my great trials I felt lost my wife baby and everything said brother Brandon did you keep your religion during that time I said no sir it kept me during that time is what it is for I can't keep Christ he keeps me it is whether I hang on is whether he tells on it's a gift to me and then noticing that people have this hard time there's got to be something wrong somewhere if the Christian religion watch here we go only consists of a declaration of treed denomination or in the lectures then we don't need nothing but real good smart group of people that's what we need if that's the church the church is governed by intellectuals not until our killers all right you can receive the word intellectually but let it's so true to the heart and then they begin to get real results so the results is not just here in it the result is when you allow this word just so true now if God meant for us to run is just by denomination also by crease then the only thing we need is the intelligence of a man smarter the man better the church but that's not God's program are you ready to go down further God's program was for the Holy Ghost to run the church the Holy Ghost was given for the church no we can't have two faculties one the church at the same time if man runs that Cody goes goes out that's a big one that's a massive one if - riders forty goes gone if the Holy Ghost runs it usually the man goes out it's one or the other sometimes me to believe I meet some rather be somebody and I'm listening I'm hearing the testimony I'm listening with a keen ear of what is the emphasis and most time the emphasis the Education Department I'm looking to hear Christ I'm looking at the vision I'm looking at the headstone the jacket I'm looking at here beyond denomination beyond group I'm looking to here at know the first question what Joseph Fellowship and which is going to now they asking that because I have a a judgment line on that so what do where you see they react or you win there or I right right right they off the image do you see that that's the behavior as a reaction they don't want to know about you life Abraham says you don't discern the church you still in the spirit in the man you don't listen the man group you doing the spiritual individual you can't judge somebody inside ear by one person I'm looking for holy be here you have to judge somebody by their spirit in them sometimes we talk around since that hour behind the organ she's just very short she said but you say but she'll find spirit he bought them because I wasn't she just but have longer son terrible spirit but they will look and say what you see have just not long enough you want something so at the end of it all it has to be a discernment what is the person's motive and the person's objective all praise God we love them so it isn't what the church needs I'll tell you what the church needs it means the baptism of the Holy Ghost it needs to pagal Living God our revival doesn't go to more and make new members a revival means to revive what you already got no no a backslider back side from something something was in him and what would always activate that so we have the paperback silence not to pray for the deliverance and then picture because it's demon powers hold them captive well Ron says what the preacher does is Constable's other people and people receive the Lord to understand the people have Devils on them some religious devil intact in spirits but when they get broken off then they get free then they can worship they could honor God Oh hallelujah praise God praise God could you take some more under the Church of Smyrna write these things said the first in the last which was dead and arrived notice every time he introduced himself he put forth something of his DG of who years I am God I changed no time came Who I am I'm the first and the last this is what a brown no watch no Smyrna means bitterness it comes from the words merle and the first church has lost his first love ephesians church the church has began to get a root of bitterness coming up in them because the main church the big part here we go the majority of them was hammering against the whole he goes ruling in the church they wanted to rule themselves they wanted to set up a priesthood they wanted to act like the Old Testament people did they wanted priests Oh a man who a man of the hour we know we are it because we have this man and one brother claiming to have the whole 5-volt is unscriptural God put gifts different gifts different gifts different administration different men and so on one man can hard will size will know they have to say that in order to be it in order to they don't need anybody else but that's not what the Bible teaches because I'm a hand I have no need of the foot that can teach that and the I have no need of the nose because if you begin to realize that we are members of that body then we need each other and we cannot do like if we are the only pebble on the beach we cannot do like every are the only members of that body we need a nose we need amount we need a ears with inner eyes with all the body parts even those padded up not calmly we need every part of the body so that is why God hates the attitude I am right you are wrong ayah if you are not I have it you don't have it what is that and that's why I got here the Nicolaitans spirit that beats the people into pots and povery them just to be in subjection to some man for some bishop or some a special or some positive rule because God is the head of the church and you have to recognize yourself as the body and as you get in that body you become part of that whole movement and there's a path in that body for you and your heart nobody else could take your path nobody could replace no time nobody is a substitute for you you are in God part of God what happened out from the pagan churches there Jupiter priests Venus and silver and they wanted to bring in them same thing to make these men this church had begin to sing a root of bitterness why it was bitter against those who want to continue on with the whole Eagles the lover fainted away and they were trying to swap it with creeds and denominations getting them Holy Ghost leadership so you swap it for teachings mysteries more doctrine more knowledge more information so I know a whole lot up here and that makes me better than you who don't have much up here but yet God here we go bypass the Pharisees and scribes who were scriptural these people they get fishermen who can read and write Reuven when God rate the world he don't need read and write he need a right heart because God has gifts of knowledge gift of wisdom gift of discernment that he could give to somebody without reason right let me give the Lord a shout in the house do you understand that got to jumping upon you active of wisdom Baca drop upon your gift of knowledge what will give you Gifford assignment Oh hallelujah do believe that civic watch aha could we take a little more so watch the root of bitterness stop creeping in and they thought they were right right and that something dignified the great woman people would come in they are the Pope that great men Cardinals and so forth they just fine they got away from all the noise and everything they had very quiet I'm sure they were dying that's why I said we do have enough noise Oh hallelujah be ready but get away from the noise they get quiet because the China here and I depend on the writin nodes and I didn't notes and writing notes I said when they go home is muggy different right all you know as you want and they come the churches because I want to be mysterious because in the spirit is where you get them divine revelation if you're not in the spirit you need hear me intellectually but in the spirit or God speak to us wait a minute but sometimes I'll be doing something all of a sudden feel the warmth of the Holy Ghost come over me hallelujah he's anointed I don't know what is for yet but I feel the presence of God like just step into the room and I've seen the anointing of God and I know he wants as direc with you something and I what I see what made his upon my heart it's the Holy Ghost afterwards when it was come the Holy Ghost goals you know that the Spirit comes and goes and so on like that to tell you what to do what to see how to operate Harlan Lewis under mom can as well take a rest and write as a restaurant like a vision comes the inspiration comes and I see all what to put where what to put the coats and everything else and my mind to be totally blown so I come on a while here seems unfold and I'm stunned to see what he lot put together now I'm telling you something that I never televisual and I avoided indicate a Bigfoot for sure there's no I scared of people trying to make a goal some people came at the decoder already that disc is me Oh hallelujah but a van stop which incidentally you can I make him Jesus Christ he was so much like Christ what he was Jesus Christ no people individual egos it is insane Oh hallelujah so the garden on the noise they were dying they would pick me find the made of butter body what but but holding was just a classic oh so when they get away from the real revelation you see because perrantes revelation brings stimulation revelation carry shaking yet many many ten a revelation that you hear in become a heron hearing that's mental see but when it's revealed aha you jump off you might walk downstairs and drink the waters our mother because it's so excited you have to kind of get to do something you can't sit still a revelation revelation make the Prophet run run a tree reveling in the khaki choir because revolution is wine word is water you can't get ahead from drinking water you can get help from drinking wine because wine big stimulation does when the upper room there was tagging like junkman why because it was all over them it was the wine of Revelation they'd have to be waiting of Revelation hit again wine of Revelation what was Jesus first miracle he's done water into focus the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah maybe got to give you a miracle this morning until

you may be seated for a few announcements amen amen amen service continues this busy at 7:30 p.m. and we just want to remind the church that going forward every Thursday it's a day of fasting and prayer for the church that we conclude here with our Thursday night prayer meeting here at the church so we want you to really contribute yourself for that and even if you can't physically make it to church on Tuesday night that you do set aside that time in your home to be united in prayer with the rest of the tabernacle that services at 7:30 p.m. we also want request that maintenance group for with me go to the Malon alexander after the service today there will also be a short choir practice after the service and we'd also like to remind the church that we are just a few weeks away from the Convention and God has blessed us thus far and we continue to solicit your support to put things in motion for the convention so the sisters will be downstairs for those of you who have pledged and we want to encourage those who have not yet made a commitment we do solicit your support particularly at the end of this month of me and the end of June as well but even beyond that you're free to make your pledges and your contributions towards the convention we're under great expectation for what we'll what God will do for the bride of Jesus Christ both here and abroad and I can tell you that the services from the last two years of conventions have been a mighty blessing around the bride of Jesus Christ around the world and I'm under great expectation because as beloved said Simeon would come to church come to the temple not knowing what deed was going to be but he was under expectation that he could be that deed and I believe that for many years we are under great expectation for a meeting that would take place where the Holy Ghost would be so thick that the ministers would can administer the worshipers were can't even sing and shout for the Holy Ghost will just take over and I'm on the expectation that this meeting could be that kind of a meeting where we have backsliders can come in and it could be completely restored there are sick among us I believe that God is about to do a work of healing among the body of Christ we have never seen before in fact what the Branham set up where Christ is the sickest body on the face of the earth but that will not be how we will leave this place that's maybe how it is right now but that's not our promise we are not to leave sick and defeated entire and I believe that every prayer request that was prayed for today will come back as a note of praise and more than that I believe that every young person who is not in the house of God because of whatever situation they will be in the house of God that's also our promise I believe those are weary and tired God will give them a charge and an anointing and a call and they have to respond to because my sheep knows my voice and a stranger they will not follow and I love about over today being back slidden is temporary there's no permanent backslider because once you're done you're always a son so don't worry about your situation don't worry about your children don't worry about anything because God is in control I am under great expectation for what God will do in the upcoming convention even now every service we know this is mandatory isn't that right every time it is mandatory what I want to encourage you next week Sunday is the 28th day of me and we will have a special service to set the church in order for the convention and basically the 28th day time of live service and from the 29th of May we are calling for a 40 day consecration for the church now they'll take us directly into the convention on the 7th of July so we are announcing to the church next week sunday is a very special service on the 28th day of me and on the 29th we are calling for a 40 day period of consecration for the church which will take us to the convention and the convention is some spiritual numbers between six and nine the converse would be July 7 8 and 9 so we under great expectations who what God will do so don't miss next Sunday service tell somebody who is not here that we are getting ready to leave this place we don't have too much time let me get a redditor to get out of this place we are getting ready to give the devil the final knockout punch we're getting ready to see the backlight has come in and but the Branham said will be a short quick message I will shake the whole nation all of the years we have been laboring in the vineyard is for short quick message for your family to come in for short quick message we're going to pour out the Holy Ghost there are some 11-hour Gentile workers who haven't even come to church yet but they will come in a short space of grease they will come through that door that opened or the baptism of the Holy Ghost straight into the bride body so all these years of coming was just to prepare us to leave this place to prepare us but what era have where she could have seen and what David wish she could have seen even with a Branham Michigan of goodness and so close I could almost see it but Church it's later than we think but it's a happy time for the bride of Jesus Christ because we are getting younger we are getting stronger we are getting more powerful we are dealing the vibrations of a theophany say this time is up the whole creation groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God to come under great expectation our blessed week amid a lord richly bless you hallelujah Oh glory be to God breathe Gordy man it was just get ready common or she odd Oh bless you amen amen she won rather me be the malady you surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemy to all my fears Oh [Music]
