[16:57] opportunity to share the word with you
[17:01] tonight and also Sunday
[17:04] morning but before I read the
[17:08] scriptures I want to read a
[17:11] prophecy that
[17:13] came at the beginning in the in the
[17:15] beginning of the message of
[17:18] Grace uh somebody spoke in
[17:21] tongues and there was an
[17:24] interpretation and and that was uh soam
[17:27] was speaking
[17:29] and he was saying that something changed
[17:31] that
[17:33] morning he had one
[17:36] message and like the Lord he changed
[17:39] it and as he speaks was before I think
[17:42] before he
[17:44] prayed this prophecy
[17:46] came and it says again I've spoken to
[17:49] you this morning by my
[17:52] spirit again calling to your
[17:56] remembrance that I will talk to you this
[17:58] morning by the voice of my
[18:02] Prophet I have given him a message this
[18:06] morning that might seem even strange to
[18:11] him yet it has been ordained of me that
[18:14] your understanding might be made
[18:20] fruitful that you might look upon my
[18:23] work of
[18:26] righteousness that I am working in my
[18:28] church this
[18:31] day that your heart might be lifted
[18:35] up that your understanding might be made
[18:41] fruitful that you might be
[18:44] receptive to these things that I'm going
[18:46] to speak to you this
[18:50] morning that you might become encourage
[18:53] in the
[18:55] way that I desire you to walk in
[19:00] that you might lift up your voices and
[19:05] praises and thanksgiv to
[19:08] me in the close of this
[19:12] service and know that I have been
[19:17] here that my spirit is in the midst of
[19:19] you even
[19:22] now look unto
[19:25] me the true and living God
[19:30] because I am standing in the midst this
[19:34] morning I am rejoicing with you in my
[19:39] spirit and I would lift you this
[19:43] morning by my strong right
[19:47] hand in the place where you can
[19:52] represent and walk beside me in Heavenly
[19:56] places because my desire this
[20:00] morning is unto
[20:02] you that your hearts might be lifted
[20:06] up that you might Rejoice with
[20:10] me in
[20:12] spirit listen to this part and
[20:16] gain this Mighty
[20:20] knowledge and this spiritual
[20:23] wisdom and the
[20:26] understanding that you are going to need
[20:30] need when the time
[20:33] comes and the
[20:36] persecution that is going to
[20:39] come just before I Rapture my
[20:44] bride you will not endure my wrath my
[20:49] children but no you will not endure my
[20:53] wrath my
[20:56] children but persecution will come upon
[21:00] you and beset you on many
[21:05] sides you will be
[21:08] tried and you would lift up your
[21:11] hands and raise your
[21:14] voices on my
[21:17] behalf and
[21:20] testify when the going gets
[21:23] hard I will come
[21:26] down and witness through you
[21:31] I will ward off of
[21:34] you the evil devices of the wicked
[21:38] one
[21:40] because I have spoken to
[21:43] you from my
[21:45] spirit and if you would listen to my
[21:49] voice that I am bringing to you this
[21:52] morning you will have no cause to
[21:56] regret God sayth my spirit
[22:00] oh praise the Lord oh praise the
[22:04] Lord so two things I want to
[22:08] highlight you have often heard the
[22:10] prophet speak about a
[22:14] persecution come into the
[22:17] church and we see it here in Prophecy
[22:19] and this this what was
[22:22] spoken wasn't spoken for that
[22:25] time it was spoken for our time
[22:29] so I wanted to get it clear
[22:32] tonight we are not going to sit in
[22:35] church and just walk into the
[22:38] Rapture no no no no no it's not
[22:40] happening that
[22:41] way a persecution is going to
[22:44] come pressure is going to
[22:47] come and that pressure will
[22:50] separate the men from the
[22:53] boys and the wom from the
[22:56] girls in other words don't press is
[22:59] coming to
[23:01] test and to see what's in
[23:04] us so I want to encourage you
[23:07] tonight this message is not a
[23:10] game it's not a play
[23:12] thing it's
[23:14] real God had
[23:17] spoken by this Mighty Malachi for
[23:21] Prophet that word shall not return
[23:26] void oh praise the Lord
[23:29] hallelujah hallelujah so let's stand
[23:32] tonight as you want to turn to Genesis
[23:34] chapter
[23:36] one we were to verse 26 and
[23:41] 27 Romans chapter
[23:44] 8 we want to read 20 to
[23:49] 31 and Ephesians chapter
[23:54] 1 we will read 3 to 5 and 9 to1
[24:00] reading from Romans chapter
[24:03] 8
[24:04] verse 26 and
[24:09] 27 oh no we read Genesis chapter one
[24:13] rather and God said let us make man in
[24:15] our image after our likeness let them
[24:17] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[24:19] over the fall of the air over the cattle
[24:22] over all the Earth over every creeping
[24:24] thing that creepeth upon the Earth
[24:40] so God created man in his own image and
[24:42] the image of God created him male and
[24:46] female created
[24:52] them Romans
[24:56] 8:28 and we know that all all things
[24:58] work together for good to them that love
[25:00] God to them who are be called according
[25:03] to his
[25:11] purpose for whom he did for know he also
[25:14] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[25:17] image of his son that he might be the
[25:19] firstborn among many brethren
[25:31] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[25:33] he also called whom he called them he
[25:36] also Justified and be justified then he
[25:39] also
[25:46] glorified what shall we then say to
[25:49] these things if God be for us who can be
[25:51] against
[25:57] us Ephesians
[25:59] 1 from verse 3 to 5 and then we go down
[26:02] to
[26:03] 9 blessed be the God and father of our
[26:06] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[26:08] with all spiritual blessings and
[26:10] Heavenly places in
[26:20] Christ according as he has chosen in him
[26:23] before the foundation of the world that
[26:25] we should be holy Without Blame before
[26:27] him in love
[26:36] more having made having
[26:40] predestinated us unto the unto the
[26:43] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[26:44] himself according to the good pleasure
[26:47] of his
[26:47] [Music]
[26:53] will verse n having made known unto us
[26:57] the Myster of his will according to the
[27:00] his good pleasure which he had purposed
[27:02] in
[27:09] himself that in the dispensation of the
[27:11] fullness of times he might gather
[27:13] together in one all things in Christ
[27:16] with both which are in heaven and which
[27:18] are in Earth even in him
[27:30] in whom also we have obtained an
[27:31] inheritance being predestinated
[27:34] according to the purpose of him who work
[27:37] at all things after the counsel of his
[27:39] own
[27:49] will let us pray one father God we have
[27:53] read your
[27:54] word I am very needy tonight
[27:59] I'm depending upon you
[28:01] [Music]
[28:02] father that you would release the
[28:03] unction to
[28:07] speak and may your
[28:09] spirit Quicken the word to your
[28:12] people in Jesus name I
[28:15] ask amen and amen you may be seated oh
[28:19] praise the
[28:20] lord well I have a
[28:22] title predestinated to be formed to the
[28:26] word imagees
[28:30] predestinated to be formed to the word
[28:35] image have context
[28:38] scripture from Romans
[28:41] 8:15 and it says we have not received
[28:44] the spirit of bondage to
[28:48] fear but we have received the spirit of
[28:52] adoption where we cry AB
[28:56] father mean that we have a connection
[28:59] with
[29:00] God and a
[29:02] revelation that he is our
[29:04] father the spirit bear witness with our
[29:10] spirit that we are the children of
[29:12] God and if
[29:16] children then you are
[29:18] ears if
[29:21] children then you have an
[29:24] inheritance and if we suffer with
[29:27] him we may be glorified
[29:29] together and then Paul dropped this
[29:33] bum for I
[29:36] reckon that the
[29:38] sufferings of this present
[29:42] time are not
[29:44] worthy to be
[29:47] compared with the
[29:49] glory that shall be revealed in
[29:53] us for the creation
[29:58] is waiting on the
[30:01] manifestation of the sons of God oh
[30:04] glory to God in the
[30:07] Amplified that verse 18
[30:10] says I consider that the
[30:13] sufferings of this present
[30:16] time I'm not worthy to be
[30:19] compared with the
[30:21] glory that's about to reveal to
[30:24] us and in us and conf on
[30:29] us Oh Glory to God we have a great time
[30:35] coming powerful time
[30:37] coming but tonight I want you to know
[30:42] that you are
[30:43] predestinated to be formed to the word
[30:47] image all this
[30:49] message of Seven Seals of seven tund had
[30:54] an objective with
[30:56] God is that right
[30:58] so he said that he is
[31:01] predetermined that you have to be
[31:05] conformed because who he form you he
[31:09] called who he called he justified and
[31:13] who he justified he has already
[31:16] glorified and he has he has
[31:18] predestinated
[31:20] you to this word
[31:22] image what what is this word
[31:26] image and that is what we want to talk
[31:29] tonight what is this word
[31:32] image and if God help
[31:34] us on Sunday we can go into how we are
[31:39] formed but this is what you are
[31:41] predestinated
[31:43] to God didn't set you
[31:47] up to be a nice church
[31:50] member set you
[31:52] up he had a purpose in his
[31:56] mind he predestinated
[31:59] to
[32:00] adoption his
[32:03] longing
[32:04] God to see his sons come to
[32:08] maturity that's CA
[32:10] burden remember there was nothing like
[32:14] him is had animals
[32:18] dinosaurs all kind of
[32:20] creatures but there was nothing like
[32:22] him then God
[32:24] said let us make man
[32:28] in our image and in our
[32:31] likeness so in the
[32:33] beginning God's
[32:35] image came on the
[32:37] earth and Adam was a
[32:40] reflection of the image of
[32:42] God in flesh but man
[32:46] fell and God
[32:48] purpose he will bring man right
[32:51] back to that image of
[32:54] God all the
[32:56] Mysteries all the
[32:58] Revelation is to bring us right back
[33:01] because we are going back to
[33:03] Eden we are not
[33:05] Americans we are not haian our home is
[33:09] not this world we going back
[33:12] somewhere we came from
[33:14] somewhere and we going back to somewhere
[33:17] but we came from
[33:19] God going back to God we don't belong in
[33:23] heaven we belong on the
[33:26] earth so when the lamb took the
[33:29] book John said we shall
[33:32] rain on the earth to rain it's to
[33:37] rule it's to
[33:39] dominate it's to conquer it's to
[33:43] overcome that's our
[33:46] calling to r on the earth as Sons and
[33:49] Daughters of God oh it's a high
[33:53] calling it's a glorious
[33:55] calling you'll be struggling now
[34:00] but one day your struggle will be
[34:03] over because God had purpose that you
[34:06] are going to make
[34:08] it don't try to figure it
[34:11] out who called you who started to work
[34:15] in you who brought you out you didn't
[34:19] start it you didn't call yourself and
[34:23] the god that began good work is able to
[34:27] complete it
[34:29] tell that devil
[34:31] tonight God is still working on
[34:34] me let that devil know

[34:41] give the Lord some
[34:43] Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[34:46] hallelujah glory to
[34:50] godam he said God can
[34:52] write one time there was writing on the
[34:56] wall God wrote with his
[34:58] fingers he said God can
[35:01] speak God can
[35:06] read or let say in the
[35:09] beginning the Bible said the Earth was
[35:12] without form and
[35:15] void no form no
[35:19] shape just a mix up
[35:21] thing
[35:23] darkness and then God
[35:26] spoke God said said let there be
[35:30] light hallelujah hallelujah so when God
[35:33] see things that are not
[35:36] shaped or
[35:38] formed because God is into shaping
[35:42] things forming things not letting things
[35:46] just
[35:47] scatter he's a god of
[35:50] order he's a god of
[35:52] discipline he set the moon one
[35:55] place he set the sun one place
[35:59] he's a god of
[36:01] order hallelujah hallelujah he's a god
[36:04] of
[36:05] form there was no
[36:07] form something had to change that the
[36:10] only could change that has to be the
[36:14] word so he spoke a word and things begin
[36:18] to
[36:19] shape and the evening and the
[36:22] morning was the first day and God said
[36:26] let there be this
[36:28] let there be
[36:30] that he is coming onto
[36:33] something so listen what the prophet
[36:35] said therefore he created by his
[36:40] word he sent his
[36:43] word so all the
[36:46] seeds that he placed upon the
[36:49] Earth he formed those
[36:53] seeds by his own
[36:55] word for there was nothing else to make
[36:58] the seed out
[37:01] of he placed them and they were beneath
[37:04] the
[37:05] water the first
[37:08] man was in the image of
[37:11] God which is
[37:13] Spirit God is a
[37:15] spirit isn't that right the first
[37:19] man was a spirit
[37:22] man and he was in the
[37:25] image and likeness of
[37:28] God then he put this man in
[37:32] flesh and man
[37:35] fell isn't that right then God came
[37:40] down
[37:41] listen he come in the image of
[37:45] man to redeem Fallen
[37:48] man did you get that in the
[37:51] beginning let there be a
[37:54] man in our image Spirit man put this man
[37:59] in
[38:01] flesh that man
[38:03] fell now Spirit
[38:05] God put on
[38:07] flesh to redeem that man to bring back
[38:11] that
[38:12] man
[38:13] Spirit put on flesh in the person of
[38:17] Jesus
[38:18] Christ to come and redeem that man and
[38:21] in this last day God go have them Sons
[38:24] and
[38:25] Daughters veiled
[38:28] with God to go after your Fallen
[38:31] brother to go after Fallen sister it
[38:35] will be God in you
[38:38] redeeming
[38:39] calling
[38:41] pulling
[38:43] drawing that's his
[38:45] purpose isn't that
[38:47] right now let's go he
[38:51] commanded each one of those
[38:53] seeds what it would
[38:56] be and they they would transform
[38:59] themselves into the
[39:01] plant of which any kind of whatever the
[39:04] kind of the word spoke it should
[39:07] be in other words he said every
[39:11] seed bring forth after his
[39:14] kind and that was a
[39:16] word isn't that
[39:19] right because the cre
[39:22] creator has sent for his
[39:25] word listen to this
[39:28] the word
[39:29] seed was
[39:32] there before the real
[39:35] seed was ever
[39:40] formed the wood is a seed right so when
[39:43] God said let there be
[39:45] light that was a
[39:47] seed and then there was
[39:49] light oh hallelujah hallelujah
[39:52] hallelujah hallelujah so when the word
[39:54] go to
[39:55] you a word seed
[39:58] it's the word seen first before it com
[40:01] to the
[40:03] reality Oh Glory to God do you get it
[40:07] now let me say it again and the Word
[40:12] was before the real seed was ever
[40:15] formed in other words let there be a
[40:17] mango
[40:19] tree let there be a mango
[40:22] seed that's a word people could laugh at
[40:25] it people could mock
[40:28] that's a prophecy mango seed is
[40:31] coming it could take 10 years 100 years
[40:36] and all of a sudden seed is there the
[40:39] real seed so I'm talking about you now
[40:43] there's a prophecy over your life they
[40:46] may laugh at it but that's a word but
[40:50] one day you be a
[40:52] real the
[40:54] Lord one day Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[41:00] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[41:02] to God okay okay watch the
[41:07] seed can only come
[41:10] forth with the power of life within
[41:14] it to transform
[41:17] it from a seed to
[41:20] plant I
[41:22] love how God
[41:24] operates remember the first major
[41:26] parable Jesus
[41:29] gave the first
[41:31] Parable disciples ask him Lord what what
[41:34] is the meaning of
[41:36] this if you don't get this one you can't
[41:40] understand the rest the word is a
[41:42] SE a saw went for to
[41:45] S some fell on the way
[41:48] side some fell on
[41:50] rocks some fell grw up in with
[41:53] torns and some fell in good ground
[41:57] nothing is wrong with the
[42:00] seed each one of those
[42:03] hearts
[42:05] weide
[42:07] Rocky
[42:09] thorny and good represent
[42:15] heart nothing wrong with the
[42:18] seed the seed is
[42:20] perfect the seed is
[42:22] God but once that
[42:25] seed get into good grow
[42:28] a process start to take place and people
[42:31] don't like
[42:32] process but God is a god of
[42:35] process Jesus could have come down like
[42:38] a big
[42:39] man but God said all a seed a virgin
[42:44] shall
[42:45] conceive Lord
[42:48] prais the
[42:50] Lord Jesus could have come long on the
[42:54] earth as a big man
[42:57] God said a shall
[42:59] conceive now Adam didn't go through that
[43:03] process Adam was spoken with
[43:07] image Adam he called
[43:10] Adam the seed of the
[43:13] word but Jesus he was the Flesh of the
[43:17] word he was the word
[43:19] itself Adam had the
[43:22] potential but Jesus was the reality of
[43:26] God he expressed God in
[43:30] totality oh give the Lord some
[43:33] Praises hallelujah hallelujah so when
[43:36] God put a seed he said the

[43:43] potential of what he said it would
[43:46] be let's bring it to you
[43:49] tonight the seed that has been going

[47:24] past what the devil is afraid of
[47:27] is your
[47:29] future what the devil is afraid

[48:41] brother anything that stays in his
[48:44] channel in the line of the
[48:47] word it will bring forth exactly
[48:51] so in other words the mango
[48:55] tree or the mango
[48:57] seed feel led to become a bread
[49:03] fruit or or become Taman
[49:09] tree or become orange
[49:11] tree mang I'm tired
[49:15] of I don't want to be no mang
[49:17] anymore that can't
[49:19] work every
[49:21] seed after its
[49:24] kind every seed
[49:26] after its kind so if
[49:29] God want sons of God in the last
[49:33] days what
[49:35] seed what he
[49:37] plant if God want a
[49:41] reproduction of the original
[49:44] grain what
[49:45] seed would he plant what Original
[49:49] Seed and the spoken
[49:52] word is the Original
[49:55] Seed spoken
[49:57] word the word out of the mouth of
[50:01] God and the mouth of God are His
[50:06] prophets so prophetic
[50:10] utterance Spirit spoken
[50:13] words or Spirit given
[50:17] words Jesus said it this
[50:20] way my words they are
[50:24] spirit and they are life
[50:27] so my
[50:28] word is also
[50:31] spirit so you can receive
[50:34] spirit in word
[50:38] form in seed
[50:41] form so that's why the angel of God the
[50:44] spirit of
[50:46] God that told the prophet pick up a pen
[50:48] and
[50:50] write he said the secret is
[50:53] this the word is in the bride
[50:57] that's the secret that's the secret the
[51:01] word is in the bride this bride is
[51:07] pregnant with God in the form of the
[51:12] word but one day he will throw his
[51:16] Spirit upon that word that's in you and
[51:21] it will be
[51:21] transformed oh give the Lord some
[51:24] Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[51:27] Hallelujah the
[51:29] kingdom of God that is within you the
[51:34] prophet said it's the word turned into
[51:39] spirit and power and that's the kingdom
[51:43] in
[51:44] you hallelujah hallelujah that's why he
[51:47] said Jesus said when they said come here

[51:55] said don't with them
[51:57] the
[51:58] kingom is you he said father they have

[53:53] back hallelujah hallelujah so long time
[53:57] they praise God and these
[54:00] people claim to see the name in the
[54:03] book which book a copy
[54:07] book exercise

[54:11] Book when John show his
[54:14] name John say what even the

[54:49] one
[54:52] 11 the Bible said he came onto his own

[55:04] him the
[55:08] word as many as received
[55:11] him the word to them he give
[55:15] power watch it to
[55:19] become so this isn't like instant coffee
[55:21] and instant
[55:23] food this is power
[55:27] to
[55:28] become so in other words faith is a
[55:31] revelation but
[55:33] virtue virtue is power virtue is what
[55:39] came out of Jesus so virtue is power
[55:43] that come upon your
[55:45] Revelation to give you power to add the
[55:48] rest of the
[55:49] light Give the Lord a
[55:52] sh that's not a natural thing that's not

[56:22] image what image f virtue knowledge
[56:29] Temperance patience
[56:31] godliness
[56:33] kindness charity that image would be
[56:38] ins once more the
[56:41] world direct from God once
[56:45] more people will see
[56:48] Jesus in bright
[56:50] form Give the Lord some
[56:52] Praises hallelujah hallelujah Glory
[56:56] hallelujah hallelujah as many as receive
[57:00] him to them give it
[57:03] power to become the sons of God who he
[57:06] speaking about which were
[57:09] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[57:13] flesh nor the will of man but of God so
[57:18] he's not talking about your first
[57:21] birth he's talking about the New Birth a
[57:24] born again experience
[57:26] there something
[57:28] superal happen to
[57:31] you to God you can't explain it that's
[57:36] from
[57:37] Grace that's from the message of
[57:39] Grace what happened when the head come
[57:42] when that come it
[57:46] sh of
[57:48] Grace Grace the prophet said if the
[57:53] power is to come among the people
[57:57] it will not be their
[57:58] prayer it will not be their prayer it
[58:01] will be the grace of God Rejoice tonight
[58:05] the grace of God is coming to
[58:08] you oh glory to Hallelujah not by
[58:14] might not by
[58:16] power but by my
[58:19] spirit say the
[58:21] Lord God will
[58:23] speak God has spoken
[58:26] God is
[58:27] speaking Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[58:32] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[58:37] hallelujah what does the
[58:39] transformation how do we get it what
[58:42] does the what does the
[58:44] transformation he's asking the question
[58:47] and he's giving the
[58:48] answer God does it by the spirit of his
[58:52] word I love that so the word of spirit
[58:58] said
[59:00] letter
[59:01] kills but the spirit give it
[59:05] life or you mean it could have
[59:09] word no Spirit exactly that is letter
[59:15] just as the
[59:16] voice what mean is live
[59:19] voices could you
[59:21] imagine a voice without a life a voice
[59:26] without spirit it's just words it's like
[59:29] a lecture so we need live
[59:32] voices life behind the voice so in every
[59:38] age when the devil came in with God
[59:41] raised a spirit
[59:43] Power the
[59:45] ox the eagle lion the man he rais a
[59:51] power against the demon
[59:54] power that power
[59:56] was spirit
[59:58] Power in every age had God's
[1:00:02] spirit in his people through his people
[1:00:07] overcoming the
[1:00:08] devil so when he sent the
[1:00:10] Prophet The Prophet
[1:00:13] gathered all the spirit that was in
[1:00:16] Seven
[1:00:17] Ages he put it all
[1:00:19] together because He restored the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost
[1:00:22] itself back in the church
[1:00:26] released to
[1:00:27] us the Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost in word
[1:00:32] form
[1:00:33] Glory hallu he couldn't release the
[1:00:37] spirit as
[1:00:39] spirit because that was going to make us
[1:00:42] P
[1:00:44] church because to handle the
[1:00:47] spirit you need
[1:00:50] character Lord I
[1:00:52] pra are we getting some
[1:00:54] tonight are we getting somewhere tonight
[1:00:58] when the Holy Ghost fell upon the
[1:01:01] Pentecost they speak in tongues cast out
[1:01:05] Devils heal the sick roll on the
[1:01:08] floor shout a little
[1:01:10] bit and then this one go with this one
[1:01:14] husband and this one go with this one
[1:01:16] wife because there was no word there
[1:01:19] there was no life there but the word had
[1:01:23] the life and the word to a prophet and
[1:01:27] the PC reject the prophet and then go
[1:01:31] open
[1:01:32] opportunity that you and I could get
[1:01:35] it if the
[1:01:37] Pentecostal had received the
[1:01:39] prophet rure going
[1:01:41] already but they couldn't receive it
[1:01:45] because he said they were the
[1:01:47] shock and the shock is the green thing
[1:01:50] around the
[1:01:53] seed hallelujah hallelujah around the
[1:01:56] seed you see when you have the corn is
[1:01:59] Young it has some green around it
[1:02:02] because it is
[1:02:03] Young and you have to protect the
[1:02:06] seed from the hot July

[1:05:53] ourselves Oh Glory to God
[1:05:56] let me let me just go back quickly in
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:58] scriptures Jesus called the
[1:06:01] disciples give them seeds he know
[1:06:05] they're not ready yet to
[1:06:06] handle he told them the works that I
[1:06:10] do you will do also could you imagine
[1:06:13] how
[1:06:15] this
[1:06:19] talking men who are not
[1:06:22] converted men who are not changed
[1:06:25] he giv them
[1:06:26] promises the same works I do shall you
[1:06:30] do also as my father sent me so send
[1:06:34] you why because they are sons and Sons
[1:06:39] could handle the
[1:06:41] seeds even if you're ready yet you have
[1:06:44] to hear it you have to believe it you
[1:06:47] have to act on it because you a son he's
[1:06:51] not treating you as a
[1:06:53] outcast he's treating you as a son
[1:06:58] and Jesus died two guys
[1:07:01] walking Jesus come among them he could
[1:07:04] come Among Us and see a
[1:07:07] word and he walking with them said what
[1:07:10] going on what was happening say well oh
[1:07:13] God Jesus was with us he
[1:07:19] died they fall
[1:07:22] years with no Revelation Jesus told them
[1:07:26] going to die you know what Jesus do he
[1:07:30] pepper
[1:07:32] them he rebuke
[1:07:35] them fo
[1:07:41] slow Christ was to suffer these
[1:07:44] things but he gather them
[1:07:47] together not a public
[1:07:50] Ministry not on some Mountain
[1:07:53] Fe when he rose from the dead
[1:07:56] it was a private
[1:07:58] Ministry to the
[1:08:01] elect oh give the Lord a
[1:08:03] shout the public
[1:08:06] Ministry for Peter and all of
[1:08:09] them that was coming but Jesus lock them
[1:08:14] in open up the word open up the
[1:08:18] understanding so they they got
[1:08:21] Clarity they got
[1:08:23] Clarity of the purp
[1:08:26] and the vision of God for their lives
[1:08:30] they had no mistakes they had no
[1:08:33] wondering they have no
[1:08:36] question how how how you know that
[1:08:39] because the Bible say they returned to
[1:08:42] Jerusalem with great joy and Christ was
[1:08:46] going Hallelujah GL hallelujah
[1:08:50] hallelujah because Jesus said Jesus said
[1:08:54] if I don't go
[1:08:56] the comforter will not
[1:08:57] come oh glory to God so Jesus will tell
[1:09:01] them you have a comforter with
[1:09:04] you I am with you I am the word I am a
[1:09:08] comforter but I'm not talking about
[1:09:11] me I'm talking about another
[1:09:14] comforter and that another
[1:09:16] comforter is the spirit Oh Glory to God
[1:09:21] so he
[1:09:22] prophesied he said behold
[1:09:25] I send the
[1:09:26] promise of my father upon you and he
[1:09:31] blow receive the holy Oh Glory to God
[1:09:36] hallelujah and all me in the upper
[1:09:41] room Apostle Prophet teacher Church
[1:09:50] janitor everybody was there and to
[1:09:54] wait because Dynamics was
[1:09:56] coming Oh Glory to God and I know many
[1:10:00] men in the
[1:10:01] message has claim a lot of
[1:10:05] things and it's only because their mouth
[1:10:07] saying
[1:10:08] so no
[1:10:10] Vindication no
[1:10:12] manifestation no
[1:10:14] evidence but the m
[1:10:17] going making all kind of claims they
[1:10:20] will be found to be
[1:10:21] Liars when God come down
[1:10:25] God begin to do the work there be no
[1:10:28] doubt he will let it be known among men
[1:10:34] it will speak for itself oh give the
[1:10:37] Lord some Praises when God begin to work
[1:10:41] with you it will speak for itself oh my
[1:10:47] hallelujah hallelujah so he transformed
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:51] seed yeah what he said he plants his
[1:10:54] seed
[1:10:55] and throw his Spirit on
[1:10:57] it and it brings forth the
[1:11:00] product so what you expect God to
[1:11:03] do plant a seed and we just have books
[1:11:06] and
[1:11:08] tapes and we like seed
[1:11:12] collectors not
[1:11:14] working when the
[1:11:16] disciples understanding
[1:11:18] open and the word open they decide to go
[1:11:22] in the upper
[1:11:23] room and they created an atmosphere
[1:11:26] and the prophet says the Praises and
[1:11:30] worship is
[1:11:33] water to the seed so if you want the
[1:11:37] rain if you want the water
[1:11:42] you because nobody knows the trouble see
[1:11:45] you
[1:11:47] troubles like if you car
[1:11:50] whole hold troubles in
[1:11:52] your I remember a story somebody said
[1:11:54] one time
[1:11:56] somebody was in like
[1:11:58] heaven and they had the cross the back
[1:12:02] and they come inside said Lord this
[1:12:06] cross so
[1:12:07] heavy and the Lord say
[1:12:09] okay put on that cross and look and pick
[1:12:13] anyone you
[1:12:14] want they look and they look and they
[1:12:17] look and they pick up this one and he
[1:12:19] put it on and Jesus said but that's he
[1:12:22] want you come with
[1:12:25] the smallest
[1:12:27] one in other words the cross he thought
[1:12:29] was so
[1:12:31] heavy was the smallest
[1:12:34] one every one of us have a cross to
[1:12:38] beer every one of us have something to
[1:12:42] carry Jesus said come unto me
[1:12:48] all and I will give you rest for my yoke
[1:12:52] is easy and my burden is light
[1:12:56] he did not say no
[1:12:58] yoke he did not say no
[1:13:01] burden he said the burden the devil will
[1:13:04] put on
[1:13:05] you my burden is lighter than what the
[1:13:11] devil put on you and my
[1:13:15] yoke is
[1:13:17] better devil put on
[1:13:19] you oh give the Lord some
[1:13:22] Praises
[1:13:24] Glory somebody had to pack that
[1:13:27] burden GL to God hallelujah
[1:13:30] brother I'm
[1:13:32] Pentecostal but not
[1:13:35] denomination I am Pentecostal by
[1:13:38] experience you cannot organize
[1:13:42] Pentecost because it is an
[1:13:45] experience if you don't believe all the
[1:13:48] word of
[1:13:49] God you haven't received the Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost because when you hear the
[1:13:56] truth and the Holy
[1:13:58] Spirit don't lead you to
[1:14:01] it then there's another spirit in
[1:14:05] dear keeping you away from
[1:14:07] it so the spirit you
[1:14:10] got in the Holy
[1:14:13] Spirit then he said this then he said
[1:14:15] this when Jesus was made
[1:14:19] flesh he was the Flesh of the word of
[1:14:23] God are you ready but when we receive
[1:14:26] the word of
[1:14:28] God then we
[1:14:31] become God's word in our
[1:14:34] flesh the church should be in that
[1:14:39] condition where you know that you
[1:14:42] receive the
[1:14:43] word then that's God in your
[1:14:46] flesh Oh Glory to God don't miss this
[1:14:50] now after God made his man in his own
[1:14:54] image
[1:14:56] that was a perfect
[1:14:58] man but he
[1:15:00] fell by the
[1:15:03] byproduct which is the bride which is
[1:15:06] Eve he said death come by cross
[1:15:12] breeding death can't come by God's
[1:15:16] word the watch it life comes by the
[1:15:21] word Jesus said my words are life
[1:15:26] and the spirit Pickens the word and
[1:15:30] makes it life now what he say here and
[1:15:34] who who do you say this
[1:15:35] is and the word
[1:15:38] anointed makes the
[1:15:40] Messiah and he said be
[1:15:43] one as I and my father are
[1:15:47] one how will that be how would that be
[1:15:51] the word in
[1:15:53] us would be the the anointed
[1:15:56] word that's the oness of God so he's
[1:16:00] talking about the word coming into you
[1:16:04] and then God anointed that
[1:16:06] word in you even Jesus had to say the
[1:16:12] spirit is upon me he was the word
[1:16:15] itself but the spirit had to come upon
[1:16:19] him after you overcome the
[1:16:22] devil lust of the eyes
[1:16:25] lust of the Flesh and the pride of
[1:16:29] life came into the
[1:16:31] temple Spirit upon him he's now the
[1:16:35] Messiah the anointed word so right now
[1:16:39] you are the word but you are to
[1:16:43] become what the devil is troubling by
[1:16:46] what the devil is looking
[1:16:48] at who is this I don't believe
[1:16:53] she I don't believe him
[1:16:56] he was a
[1:16:57] smoker she was an
[1:17:00] adulterer a
[1:17:03] drinker who who are these
[1:17:06] people but that's what God
[1:17:08] does and confuse the
[1:17:11] devil so the devil not looking at
[1:17:14] you because you are something
[1:17:16] else oh glory to God
[1:17:20] jacobob jacobob God was looking at
[1:17:23] something beond Jacob
[1:17:25] he was a
[1:17:26] trickster but he was going to be changed
[1:17:29] he was going to be
[1:17:30] transformed even his name was
[1:17:33] transformed so when they say Jacob you
[1:17:36] did this hey talking to Israel my name
[1:17:40] was changed don't talk about this jacob
[1:17:43] thing when I was
[1:17:45] Jacob but now but now I'm changed I'm no
[1:17:50] longer Jacob oh give the Lord some
[1:17:53] Praises I'm a different man
[1:17:56] glory to God
[1:17:59] transform change so the word in us would
[1:18:03] be the anointed word that is the Oneness
[1:18:06] of
[1:18:08] God the Oneness of God is the word
[1:18:13] anointed in
[1:18:14] you so listen to
[1:18:16] this so regardless of what you
[1:18:21] believe you cannot transition
[1:18:25] from the seed in the
[1:18:28] soul to the resurrection for body
[1:18:32] change
[1:18:34] no there's something in between
[1:18:38] there we find by
[1:18:41] Revelation brought by this enti
[1:18:44] message God put a seed in your
[1:18:46] soul when you was in smoking when he was
[1:18:50] drinking when he was in Baptist or
[1:18:52] Methodist
[1:18:54] was there so when the message come over
[1:18:58] you something in you respond to it you
[1:19:03] can't even
[1:19:05] explain how it happened but it happened
[1:19:10] because God put something inside of you
[1:19:12] isn't that right but listen to
[1:19:15] this God has to bring that seed in your
[1:19:20] soul into the
[1:19:22] process in which it is transformed
[1:19:26] by those
[1:19:27] virtues hallelujah hallelujah then the
[1:19:30] virtues resent in your
[1:19:33] body you're not going to the
[1:19:36] Rapture the Rapture is in you the
[1:19:39] Rapture is not outside

[1:19:46] the
[1:19:47] inside change what's on the
[1:19:50] outside Oh Glory to God the fire

[1:21:56] that to release that and it will be done
[1:22:00] there will be a genuine F
[1:22:05] Min with the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:22:08] all right let's
[1:22:09] go
[1:22:11] wow the first man he made the first man
[1:22:15] in His
[1:22:17] image are you ready and we are returning
[1:22:21] back to that image to our first created
[1:22:26] image if there one thing I want you to
[1:22:28] get
[1:22:29] tonight is that we are going back to the
[1:22:33] first created
[1:22:35] image glory to God to God has said let
[1:22:38] us make
[1:22:39] man image going back to that and no
[1:22:44] devil will stop that because God said
[1:22:48] that image is to have
[1:22:50] dominion Glory so if the image
[1:22:55] is
[1:22:56] restored Dominion will be
[1:22:59] evident all the Devils that was
[1:23:02] conquering you you would conquer them
[1:23:06] you would step on the nck you would
[1:23:08] overcome you would possess the case of
[1:23:11] the
[1:23:11] enemy because you have returned back to
[1:23:15] your first
[1:23:16] image he call it the first created
[1:23:19] image God hallelujah let's go when God
[1:23:23] created me
[1:23:25] William Bram I was before the foundation
[1:23:27] of the
[1:23:28] world he made my
[1:23:32] being my
[1:23:34] spirit I wasn't conscious of
[1:23:37] it he said I don't believe you're
[1:23:39] getting
[1:23:40] it so when he was preaching this he knew
[1:23:44] them at that
[1:23:46] time wasn't getting it are you getting
[1:23:49] it getting it
[1:23:52] tonight no wait he said wait a minute
[1:23:56] Jesus told his
[1:23:58] disciples that he knew them before the
[1:24:01] foundation of the world and Paul said
[1:24:04] here he chose
[1:24:06] us what you didn't choose him he chose
[1:24:11] you he chose
[1:24:13] us in him before the world began are you
[1:24:19] ready Church there was some part of
[1:24:22] me and the rest of you here
[1:24:25] that's in Christ
[1:24:26] Jesus before the world ever
[1:24:29] began in other words before God say Let
[1:24:33] There
[1:24:34] Be You Will part back there you can't
[1:24:38] remember it that doesn't change it now
[1:24:43] remember in the beginning was the
[1:24:45] word that is the beginning we talking
[1:24:48] about before the
[1:24:49] beginning because Lucifer he came part
[1:24:52] of in the beginning
[1:24:56] note he wasn't before the
[1:25:00] beginning so he don't know about before
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:05] beginning he could never be you he could
[1:25:08] never come back for that first created
[1:25:11] image because when God created
[1:25:13] Lucifer created Lucifer in the
[1:25:16] beginning the Angels worship Him Mak him
[1:25:22] God that's how become
[1:25:25] God of
[1:25:27] worship I going devil
[1:25:30] part are you
[1:25:32] ready here this big one to my
[1:25:36] analysis I think that the people
[1:25:40] today that are possessed with this
[1:25:44] Spirit or the
[1:25:46] spirit is part of these Angelic
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] beings spirits
[1:25:55] which wor rotated rotated off of
[1:26:00] God that never fell in the
[1:26:03] beginning he saying the spirit that you
[1:26:07] are he
[1:26:09] believes is part of the Angelic
[1:26:13] being that rotated off of
[1:26:16] God that never
