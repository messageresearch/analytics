so much praise the Lord we thank God for this time of worship and atmosphere as bhe word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence and we thank you for giving us this opportunity this Friday to come and talk to you talk it over with you and make a request known and father you know what's upon my heart tonight and I pray that you would so Inspire to every believer here Lord that they would pray differently that they would pray with confidence we pray with approach your with boness granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen trust keeping fine I trust the test keeping you on your toes and the stress will bring you Above the Rest oh blessed be the name of the Lord so tonight I have something upon my heart I'd like to share with you and the title give the title first asking for God's blessings increase guidance and protection that's the title of what I want to share with you tonight to get in prayer asking for God's blessings increase guidance and protection and we want to take a text from 1 Chronicles chapter 4 and uh we want to read from verse 7 from verse 1 to 6 is uh you know who begot who and like that so I will skip from one you can always read it and um it looks almost I wouldn't say boring but it looks like there's nothing in it in terms of just names the sons of Judah farz hezron Ki her that's in verse one and it goes on and on and on now in verse 7 it says this is 1 Chronicles chapter 4 verse 7 and the sons of hiler were zerth and jar and ethnan and cause begat anob zobah and the families of ahel the son of Haram and all of a sudden this uh name calling and name description of who beg got who and so like that is interrupted by this verse here verse 9 and jabz was more honorable than his Brethren and his mother called his name jabz saying because I bear him with sorrow and jabz called on the god of Israel saying oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thine hand might be with me and that thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested oh blessed be the name of the Lord God granted him that what he requested and I take a little peek in the Amplified and I'll read verse 10 says jabes cried to the god of Israel saying oh that you would bless me and enlarge my border that your hand might be with me and you would keep me from Evil so it might not hurt me and God granted his request this is our text tonight and this is very interesting and you know when the Bible calls out a name it is of some significance and Jab ja's life prayer and requests were noteworthy and important enough to be written in the Bible now jabz was born when his when he was born the Bible talk about his mother called his name jabz because she bore him in pain so that is a terrible thing I think to name the child and that name carry sorrow and sorrowful and so on but that is the name that she give her son note jabel was more honorable than his brothers now that name jabz in the Hebrew is a word for pain and sorrow and we know and I didn't put it down here but talk about that church is groaning that the Holy Ghost is just as real and just before that he was talking about how the Hebrews mother when they given birth they will be in labor pains and the church have to get into labor pains there are people that are light they just come and go back home no burden no concern but the storms a hit yet so they could afford to you know take it easy but it coming coming so jabz asked God to bless him bless me and I want you to see tonight it is not a hard thing to ask God to bless it's not a terrible thing to bless you to bless you because I want you to pray pray this prayer I want you to to look closer at this prayer tonight and God granted him requests so I have some things that I highlighted here and the Bible speaks about let us therefore this is Hebrews 4:16 let us therefore come boldly before the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of need now it is not easy having a name like jabz it is not easy to be packing a Sorrow by your name by your birth by your environment it's it's a hard thing jabz was born out of sorrow and pain and jabz had Brothers note the Bible never mentioned not one of his brothers that means he was living a life Above the Rest whether he was the middle child first child second child I don't know where he fit into this brother's line but you always find that the elect or the named or you know they say the cream just come to the top regardless of what and pressures and people claim you know my mother my father they have excuses as to why they are how they are and I reject that because the Bible give us a clear line if you want a breakthrough or if you want Deliverance they are so much people relish and they seem to be almost enjoy going back in the past and who do them and what they go through and nobody and know all kind of I call it nonsense because this guy was born to his mother had pain and she named him after that now the Bible talk about jabz was more honorable than his brothers and the Bible the term honorable is used to describe individuals who were esteemed respected have qualities that are worthy of admiration it signifies a person of character conduct reputation what kind of person are you I'm not talking about your your Pew I'm not talking about your chair seat I'm not talking about you're in church or you're in this message I'm not talking about that I'm talking about being honorable the word honorable is a word called Cabo I think is in the Hebrew and it signifies when applied to individual it suggests that they possess qualities that bring honor dignity or respect to themselves and others honorable also goes with character it refers to individuals who exhibit moral Integrity righteousness uprightness uprightness in their thoughts words and action honorable also go with deeds and action it can describe acts of kindness generosity righteousness that are praiseworthy and commendable like Romans 12:17 says recompense no man even for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men and he Amplified it says repay no one evil for evil but take thought for what is honest and proper and Noble aiming to be above reproach in the sight of everyone praise the Lord also an honorable person according to biblical the Bible seeks to live in a manner that it brings glory and honor to God and benefit others honorable has nothing to do with selfishness and I and me and I first honor have nothing to do with that at all and Jesus in Luke 815 speaking about the good ground he say but they that are on good ground are the which is an in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience so jabz went and prayed to God that you would bless me you would bless me not the job not the salary not the pay some people think the pay blessing them you know because the money that they getting mean so much to them they could throw off God they could throw out the channel of God the word of God and they powering themselves because of what is behind them now but jabz knew that his source of blessing was from God he wasn't going to a man he was going to God and he ask for increase of his cost or enlarge my territory I find that is bold that is Dearing there are some people they contented with what they have but this man jabz you could see he had ambition he have desire he want to increase he want to expand and this expansion is not just I believe physical but I so I believe it's spiritual I think that each one of us here tonight should want an increase you want an expansion not just a physical or what not you want an expansion in your health in your strength in your finances in your blessing in your Communication in your winning Souls you want to expand enlarge my territory and he went on to say that your hand be with me that your hand be upon me and how did he say it here he says that thou would bless me indeed enlarge my coast and that thy hand might be with me and th Keep Me From Evil so watch I believe that jabz was a humble Soul because you see humility make you bow humility makees you dependent humility confess that you don't know you people who are so arrogant they fet to know everything okay they you can't tell them anything you can't bring counsel or guidance they just know and you have to leave them alone until what we call you bounce your head hit a wall and that and crash but javz he was humble enough to Bow before God and to sayl I want you to bless me I want you to enlarge my territory I want your hand to be upon me and it was showing that jabz was asking for guidance and it troubled us so much at times that we see people make decisions make choices they do things without guidance no guidance they don't even understand the role of the pastor as a guide because the pastor will get inspiration from God to bring leadership to bring guidance to bring a word and so like that they do their own thing but they just going to church they come like if them you know like them and God in that sense but you see it still doesn't work that way God use people and God want to bring correct guidance to you this here is a defining thing for me he had Faith despite of his name and he didn't allow his name of Sorrow to Define him he was going against the Green he was going against all ODS and when things are not going well for you you have to be able to go against the grain and go on go against all Earths he knew the power of calling upon God Lord bless me and brother Bram speak about this in Inspiration he says when Jordan when Elisha crossed Jordan and he turned to him and said what would you have me to do for you Elisha said that a double portion of your spirit be upon you he said you ask a great thing then the prophet said this God wants us to ask for big things my God he don't run out of blessings up to you you can't ask too much good Lord s look at right here you can't ask for too much could you imagine a little fish about that long out in the middle of the ocean saying I better not drink much of this water because it might go dry but that's just unreasonable as would be or more so unreasonable to think that God's blessing would be exhausted to the believer all Heavens belonged to you that's a direct quote ask for big thing start to tonight tonight we don't want you to leave it for the next per meeting I want you to start this on a plan this tonight this guy Jaz asked God to increase his Coast to expand his territory and to ask God for that means you know this remind me of for know in literature sometimes you're doing Shakespeare and whatnot and they have one line and they expect you to write a whole essay on this one line and there so much dep inside there and this word so much depth inside the there this thing expansion of territory if increase my territory that doesn't mean God just taking land and expand it what he's asking God give me victory over the enemy because those days territory mean you a fighting so you you can't want God to increase your territory and you not prepared to fight so if your prayer is tonight leave me as I am right here I am comfortable you I'm getting by you what you really saying I don't want to fight I don't want to press I'm comfortable in my one by one or 2x4 or whatever it is you you are sick you you are ill you you are problems you you not you're not seeing what God want to see because you see God told Joshua from this part to the going of the sun sh your Coast when you're walking and see sun going down and he go all of that you keep walking then sh your coast and there shall no man be able to stand before thee all the days of my life all days of your life so so when when jabz was asking about increase that is why I title title Noti i title it asking for God's blessings increase guidance and protection almost done wouldn't beong with you tonight so when he asked for increase expansion of territory increase increase in possession even Prosperity a life marked by increase it means he prepar for war he prepared to fight he prepared to overcome he's asking God for victory we know how it is in the Book of Joshua you have to be able to fight and overcome and then you could you remember in Joshua there was somebody a tribe come and complain how they land too smallart and Joshua rebuked them and say look oh look look look it have Hills go cut and fight you expand expand but you see the spirit of contentment and the spirit of laia and the spirit of laziness and that is why I cannot see virtue going to a lazy soul I a seen it adding anything because Joseph means God will add second Peter is God adding add not subtract add act to your faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance God want increase how many see that tonight God don't want you where you are am God want you where he wants you to be he wants that Spirit of Excellence to achieve God want his people to be the on on top not below to be the head not the tail he wants you to be like a candle placed on a hill you don't like a candle and put it under a Bush Hill you put it on top the hill and that's why it's so noteworthy that the Bible identify jabz as more honorable than his brothers so let's say his brothers in church let's say Brothers laal there Breen Sons but they pressing on to adoption they're not pressing on to Perfection they're not pressing on to Excellence they're not pressing on to a level that would give them that spack that God could take a note of them because this is what God did here now he took a note of jabz nobody has name is called nobody names is called he injected this guy called jabz and I think it's for us to take a little look and see this short prayer he ra and going over and over and set of repetition it's very simple very straightforward I want you to bless me I want you to increase me I want you to guide me and I want you to protect me oh Hallelujah and God answer his prayer oh I feel like shouting tonight I keep to behave myself tonight on this chair but but but but but this is this is this is what this is about so I want to shake you tonight and rock you tonight that you wouldn't just be comfortable now um all right so the next one he ask for God's hand to be upon him and that's that's what he looking for God's presence God's guidance and the last one he asks for is protection from Evil and I find this is very important because as Christians you know sometimes you know God blessing you and so on and you're not looking for evil you're not looking for when the enemy trying with traps and tricks and you have to be on a lookout because Jesus says in Matthew 6:13 and lead us not into temptation Jesus interjected it in how the Our Father prayer was was was capped and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen so this evil is something to take a note her don't just think everything that's going smooth and no no no there are forces of evil trying to get at you trying to get at your family trying to get at your home I was telling a pastor in miam I say sometimes Satan send people into the church Minister sometimes doesn't understand that the Fig another a member somebody come and another member but sometimes Lucifer sent them to bring all kind of erction and issues and all kind of stuff the spirit so so I think it's powerful that jab says protection from Evil all right but one I'm going to close here now I'm going to close here now one of the biggest thing that I saw here though is when he talk about that that was was keeping from Evil that it may not grieve me that it would not hurt me that it wouldn't be a sorrowful experience to me so he actually was able to identify his name and his environment in this prayer and say you know what I reject the destiny that my name speak I supposed to be in other words when that name drop on you you're supposed to be sorrowful you're supposed to be this you're supposed to be that and the you to be destined to that he said I don't want that he had a complete rejection I have this here written a complete rejection of the destiny by which his name defined by stating I that I don't bring pain that is what he I I I I I don't want to bring pain God was pleased and God answered his prayer and I am finished tonight you know sometime people put a word on you you will be this you'll be that you'll be that you fall and you think that you will remain Fallen that's not true you could go against the Green and I challenge you tonight God could bless you abundantly you know sometime you hear us preach David say my cup run it over that's a real thing that's a think about it now David had more than he could handle it's so much that he said my cup run it over don't be afraid to ask God for miracle don't be afraid to ask God for deliverance and breakthrough and a rescue from your selfishness your harshness your unot behavior your terrible Behavior they have terrible Christians they are Christians because they under Christ and they confess Christ but they terrible behav people and I said you have bad Sons back Sons half halfway sons all kind of sons but guess what there's going to be the right kind of I want you tonight to be like jabz I want you tonight to say Lord bless me you have to have a certain amount of boldness to come and say God bless me you know your life is already but you are going to ask God tonight to bless you you're going to ask God tonight to increase I don't care what you have if you have a million God could increase that if you have 10 million God could increase that because if God increase you is to bless others your increase is never to be selfish to say I have and I own and this is my your blessing is that it could run over and the the powerful thing about this increase is how you have to fight for it you asking God in other words jabz didn't look for a shortcut he didn't look for easy way out there are so many people looking for easy way out there is no shortcuts you have to possess this land you have to deal with the Hittites in your life jebusites G all the ice P the Philistines let us bow our heads tonight heaven hely father it was just trilling for me to study this and to look at this guy called jabz that the Bible highlighted in such a unique way in just two verses in just two verses of so much things and that could almost take like a Bible study and drilling down inside of dear oh this guy that was bted by Pain by his mother named sorrow named jabz named painful and he carrying this wait on him maybe never had a joyful time in his life and he choose to Humble himself go before God and say God bless me God increase me God let your hand be upon me and God protect me and the Bible said God answered his request may we be like that tonight Lord as we get on in prayer may each person father here tonight may you answer their prayer in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen so I trust L that the Lord that you were blessed tonight and you were inspired tonight by this word I believe it's something that God give us to share with you and I trust in that you would take it to heart and you would look for God to bless you to increase you to his hand be upon you to guide you and his hand to protect you God bless you as we get down in prayer tonight or be with you [Music] [Music] spe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for
