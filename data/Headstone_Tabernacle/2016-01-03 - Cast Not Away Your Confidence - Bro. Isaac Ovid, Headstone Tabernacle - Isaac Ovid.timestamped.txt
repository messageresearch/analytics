[11:15] pray. Almighty God, we thank
[11:19] you for your grace and mercy towards us.
[11:23] Yes, Lord. Lord, you had your prophet to
[11:25] put a little sliver of light to
[11:28] represent a bride in the last days. The
[11:32] whole earth was covered with darkness.
[11:34] Your prophet Isaiah said, "Gross
[11:36] darkness cover the earth and gross
[11:38] darkness covered the people." We are so
[11:41] blessed this morning to have evening
[11:44] light to shine in our path. We so
[11:47] grateful for sending a true end time
[11:49] messenger to turn our hearts back to the
[11:53] faith. We love you this morning. We ask
[11:56] you to forgive us where we fail you and
[11:58] fall short and quickness to your
[12:00] righteousness, quickness to your purity,
[12:02] quickness to your word. May your word
[12:04] become flesh in us. Humble our hearts as
[12:07] we wait upon you and look away to you,
[12:09] Jesus. Have your way. I pray in Jesus
[12:12] name I ask it. Amen and amen. Amen.
[12:16] Hallelujah. You have your seats.
[12:19] [Music]
[12:20] Wonderful.
[12:22] Wonderful. Thank you, Jesus.
[12:26] Hallelujah.
[12:29] Glory.
[12:31] Glory. Hallelujah. I just feel the
[12:34] spirit of God so much
[12:38] in this place this morning.
[12:42] Glory.
[12:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I love that
[12:50] song. Worthy is the lamb.
[12:53] Has nothing to do with you. It has to do
[12:54] with him. Has nothing to do with your
[12:56] problem. Have to do with who he is.
[13:00] Oh, he is worthy. He Hallelujah. He gave
[13:03] us a chance. When nobody else would. He
[13:05] gave us a chance. Gave us a second
[13:08] chance. He gave us a third chance when
[13:10] we did didn't deserve a chance. He gave
[13:11] us a chance for us to love him and serve
[13:14] him, worship him and appreciate him for
[13:18] he is worthy. He is
[13:20] worthy. Didn't have to do it, but he
[13:22] did.
[13:26] He gives us space of grace. He gives us
[13:28] space, an opportunity to repent, to be
[13:30] reconciled to God. Opportunity to make
[13:34] feel whole again.
[13:36] Can you imagine the prostitute in those
[13:37] times? The unloved, the troubled and
[13:41] Jesus minister to them and they could
[13:44] see the heartbroken, blind Batimas,
[13:47] different ones. And his compassion going
[13:49] from place to place, village to village,
[13:51] heart to heart, life to life. Somebody's
[13:54] sick, a child just died, Lazarus died.
[13:58] There's so many cases. He was active in
[14:01] ministry, active in healing, restoring,
[14:04] redeeming. Amen. Bringing joy even at
[14:06] the wedding. He turned the water into
[14:07] wine. Hallelujah. That they wouldn't
[14:10] have a depressive reception.
[14:13] He keep doing things. Hallelujah. To
[14:15] uplift. Take five loaves, two fishes,
[14:17] and multiply it. Come on now. For the
[14:19] multitude,
[14:21] he was giving. Hallelujah. He was
[14:24] sharing. Hallelujah. It wasn't about
[14:26] him. It was about the rest of the world.
[14:28] Hallelujah. He knew he can do it all. So
[14:31] you get 12 men and get a bunch of
[14:34] disciples and train them and anointed
[14:36] them and inspire them that they could
[14:39] spread that word. Hallelujah. And
[14:41] through every age he has disciples.
[14:42] Amen. Who will anoint and inspire to
[14:45] press that word. Oh, we love him this
[14:48] morning. Amen. Well, we in for time this
[14:50] morning. Could we stand for the reading
[14:52] of the word? I'm not the preacher this
[14:54] morning. The preacher going to preach
[14:56] this morning. Amen. But I would
[14:59] certainly want to share something with
[15:00] you before he comes on. Is brother Isaac
[15:02] going to speak to this
[15:04] morning? Appreciate brother Isaac.
[15:07] Amen. I appreciate him. So you want to
[15:10] turn to Job chapter
[15:12] 14 verse
[15:14] 14 and you want to turn to Matthew
[15:16] chapter 25 for scripture reading this
[15:18] [Music]
[15:22] morning. Job 14:14 says, "If a man die,
[15:25] shall he live again? All the days of my
[15:28] appointed time will I wait till my
[15:30] change
[15:32] come. Matthew 25. Then shall the kingdom
[15:35] of heaven be lightened. The 10 virgins
[15:37] which took their lamps went forth to
[15:39] meet the bridegroom. Five of them were
[15:42] wise. Five were foolish. They were
[15:44] foolish took their lamps took no oil
[15:47] with them. But the wise took all in
[15:49] their lamp vessels with their lamps.
[15:51] While the bridegroom tried and the all
[15:53] slumbered and slept. And at midnight
[15:55] there was a cry made, "Behold, the
[15:58] brideman cometh, go ye out to meet him."
[16:00] Then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[16:02] their lamps. And the foolish said unto
[16:04] the wise, "Give us of your oil, for our
[16:07] lamps are going out." And the wise
[16:10] answering, saying, "Not so, least there
[16:12] not be enough for us and you, but go
[16:15] rather to them that sell and buy for
[16:18] yourselves." And while they went to buy,
[16:20] the bridegroom came, and they that were
[16:23] ready went with him to the marriage, and
[16:26] the door was shut. This
[16:30] barheads, we want to pray for Romel Ko,
[16:34] the virus, and for guidance, new school
[16:37] from his dad. Let's bow our heads.
[16:38] Father God, we thank you for your
[16:40] presence, and we pray that Lord, you
[16:42] would bless Romel in a special way. Heal
[16:44] him, Lord. May all work out well for him
[16:46] this coming term. May you bring things
[16:49] back to his membrance Lord and as we
[16:51] approach your word this portion of the
[16:52] service may you edify us strengthen us
[16:54] and bill us in Jesus name I ask it.
[16:56] Amen. You may be seated. Praise
[16:59] God. Well we had a great tremendous time
[17:02] in Ghana and I spoke a message there a
[17:07] time of lingering a subject waiting on
[17:10] the promise of God and an inspiration. I
[17:14] will wait until my change come. Amen.
[17:17] and I wanted to bring that back to you.
[17:20] I also sent out uh a greeting email to
[17:24] all the ministers that we associate with
[17:27] all whom I know for all the over the
[17:29] years and I wrote this fellow servants
[17:32] and ministers of Jesus Christ. Greeting
[17:35] in the precious name of our Lord and
[17:36] Savior Jesus Christ, happy new year to
[17:39] you, your family and your churches. May
[17:42] God bless you abundantly and continue to
[17:44] use you mightily for his kingdom as we
[17:47] earnestly contend for the faith restored
[17:49] by Malachi 4. Truly we are on the verge
[17:52] of the manifestation of every promise
[17:55] for the bride. Sir, is this the time for
[17:58] the dynamics to connect to the
[18:00] mechanics? My prayer for 2016 is to see
[18:04] sons come forth be vindicated and placed
[18:07] according to the prophecy in blasphemous
[18:09] names where and I have a quote you
[18:12] become one see you and Christ live
[18:14] together at that day you will know that
[18:17] I'm in the father the father in me and I
[18:19] in you and you in me see then that's a
[18:22] sealed unit of the lord god now and
[18:24] where and then they are vindicated and
[18:28] placed when that time takes takes place
[18:31] and have that in bold. When that time
[18:34] takes place, they become vindicated sons
[18:37] and daughters of God. Amen. May 2016 be
[18:40] the year of when that time takes place.
[18:44] May God richly bless you and grant the
[18:45] desires of your heart yours in your
[18:48] service Junior Pastor Headstone
[18:50] Tabernacle. So that's what we sent
[18:52] out by the grace of
[18:55] God. Amen.
[18:59] So Olia's night changing of
[19:02] timel time of sealing a time of
[19:07] judgment. Amen. And I know that is like
[19:10] a time as we said you have a clock on
[19:12] the stove and you pass seen the time but
[19:15] when you want to cook something you
[19:16] press the timer you have an hour and the
[19:19] hour counts down. So once the timer is
[19:22] on is a countdown. Amen. Countdown to
[19:25] judgment. Amen. Because that's what we
[19:26] heading to. Yeah. All this blood, seven
[19:29] drops of blood sprinkled eastwards and
[19:32] so on. All this mercy seat, it's really
[19:35] a judgment throne with blood on it. Once
[19:38] that blood is removed, it's over. It's
[19:41] done. You can't cry anymore. It doesn't
[19:44] matter how you plead anymore. Sincerity
[19:47] doesn't count anymore. It doesn't even
[19:49] matter anymore. The door is shut.
[19:52] Hallelujah. We have an opportunity to
[19:54] enter in and to be free. Amen. I mean,
[19:56] free indeed. Not just free for the devil
[19:59] to hook you back. Free indeed. Could we
[20:04] say amen? Praise the name of the Lord.
[20:07] So, there's really something else
[20:09] talking about this changing of time.
[20:10] Hallelujah. Because you see, I believe
[20:12] that God is about to knock out the rocks
[20:14] that will fend on this holy mountain. I
[20:16] believe the message hasn't seen judgment
[20:17] yet. That is why everything people do
[20:19] what they want to do, act how they want
[20:21] to act, get angry, stomp, walk out, do
[20:24] what they want to do, say what they want
[20:26] to say, preach what they want to preach.
[20:27] That's okay under time. But when it
[20:31] changes, it's no longer okay. It was
[20:34] okay with Anastasia. But when the time
[20:38] changed, when that Peter had the God
[20:41] upon the throne of his heart, it wasn't
[20:43] okay to lie. It wasn't okay to be
[20:46] dishonest. Amen. No, it was not okay.
[20:48] The time change, the season change was
[20:51] another book of acts. And there's a
[20:53] prophecy that there's going to be
[20:54] another book of Acts. Someday that going
[20:57] to change. We timing is running now. Oh,
[21:00] praise the name of the Lord. Do you love
[21:01] him this morning? Praise the name of the
[21:04] Lord. Just a little bit of news. Russia
[21:07] has named the US as one of the threats
[21:09] to its national security in a new
[21:11] assessment by President Vladimir Putin
[21:13] on Thursday. According to a public
[21:16] report, it is the first time Russia has
[21:19] officially named the US as a national
[21:21] security threat. According to routers,
[21:24] Russia claims its heightened global
[21:26] reach has caused counteraction from the
[21:29] US and its allies, which are striving to
[21:31] retain their dominance in global
[21:33] affairs. This document claims that
[21:35] Western pressures will likely lead to
[21:37] increased political, economic, and
[21:40] military andformational pressure on
[21:42] Russia. So that's just a word a news for
[21:45] you to think about. Oh hallelujah.
[21:48] Because brother say wait till Russia go
[21:49] over that oil. Watch out. We are ready
[21:52] for it then. They don't have to build
[21:53] any more bombs. The bombs is ready. It's
[21:55] just set there. Just wait until the
[21:57] countdown. Amen. Right now it's under
[22:00] time. But then there's a countdown. But
[22:03] Abraham saw the vision of America blown
[22:04] up. He saw these things. He saw the
[22:06] bride being pressed. He saw the people
[22:08] that follow the pillar of fire will be a
[22:10] hunted persecrated group. But it'll be
[22:12] ready for the rapture. So, what you
[22:14] thinking about? What are you worried
[22:17] about? Do you have any worries? Not yet.
[22:20] It's coming.
[22:22] Everybody should be smiling right now.
[22:23] Woo. Amen. I thought I had worries.
[22:26] That's right. You thought you had
[22:27] worries.
[22:32] It's quiet inside of here. Maybe you
[22:35] don't have enough worries. Oh,
[22:37] hallelujah. You know what Baron say? If
[22:39] love don't get it desperate, condition
[22:41] will. Is either love or condition. Pick
[22:45] one. If the loving not loving enough,
[22:47] you could get conditions and condition
[22:49] will get you desperate. God will light
[22:51] fire under you, around you, above you,
[22:54] to your left, to your right. This will
[22:57] happen, that will happen. God will make
[22:59] you uncomfortable until you get in your
[23:01] place. There's a place for you and your
[23:05] God going to push you. Amen. Praise God
[23:09] because he taught about you as a son.
[23:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Walen
[23:15] preached. He said that son wanted to
[23:17] humble himself and take a lesser role
[23:19] and be a servant. And the father could
[23:21] not accept that. Once a son,
[23:24] always a son. Once a eagle. You could
[23:28] never be a chicken. Once a eagle, always
[23:32] a eagle. You might be a wounded one. You
[23:35] might be a old one. You might be a tired
[23:38] one. You might be a sick one. But you
[23:42] are one. One's a
[23:45] eagle. Always an
[23:47] eagle. Oh, hallelujah. Devil's a liar
[23:50] this morning. How do you know he's a
[23:52] liar? Every time you open his mouth. Oh,
[23:56] glory to God. Hallelujah. You come here
[23:59] for the word to transform your
[24:02] soul. Glory to God. Don't do like
[24:05] Israel. Now they had a prophet that word
[24:07] that message and their word what didn't
[24:09] mix with their faith. So they didn't
[24:11] benefit from it. There's only killing
[24:14] time. Amen. And sitting on pews wasting
[24:16] time. But Joshua and Caleb, every word
[24:19] that was spoken, they snatch it. They
[24:21] grab that's minds. I ain't come to waste
[24:23] time in church. I grab the word God is
[24:26] speaking to me. Hallelujah. There's a
[24:28] time of lingering. That's what I speak
[24:30] on in in uh Ghana. Just want to bring
[24:32] back something to you.
[24:34] But what I'm talking about, they chose
[24:36] Matias to take the place of Judas
[24:38] because the church had to be set in
[24:40] order before dynamics fell before the
[24:42] spirit fell. They couldn't leave it with
[24:44] 11, had to be 12, had to be right.
[24:47] That's why we are striving and
[24:48] passionate now to set the church in
[24:49] order and set things in order. Isn't
[24:52] that right? And he said, I believe, here
[24:54] we go. This is where I get his vision
[24:55] from to preach in Ghana. I believe that
[24:58] all these things has a time of
[25:01] lingering
[25:03] waiting waiting for a time for
[25:06] scriptures to be fulfilled. Amen. Couple
[25:08] of weeks ago, I spoke a message that the
[25:10] scripture might be fulfilled. Jesus
[25:12] wasn't just doing things. He was doing
[25:14] things to fulfill scripture. Amen. So
[25:18] watch. Many times we get impatient like
[25:21] a child. We get great anticipations and
[25:24] many times jump way ahead and that just
[25:28] hinders the workmen and many people
[25:31] don't understand that that you have to
[25:33] follow instructions not emotions when go
[25:37] Joshua say when I begin to shout shout
[25:39] somebody can feel led to shout now amen
[25:44] and Joshua I give instructions when they
[25:46] was reading a book and they feeling
[25:48] shoutish
[25:50] you seal your mouth
[25:51] Hallelujah. If God said when I begin you
[25:54] to shout, that's the time to shout. Wait
[25:56] for the timer.
[26:00] Hallelujah. Wait for the God say shout
[26:02] now. Hallelujah. Shout to the voice of
[26:05] triumph.
[26:06] For the Lord has given you the city.
[26:08] Hallelujah.
[26:11] Hallelujah. That means you have to be
[26:12] trained.
[26:14] Amen. So watch watch. So unlike a great
[26:18] child great anticipation many times jump
[26:20] way ahead that hinders the work until
[26:23] the work get caught up here the spirit
[26:26] now we must move reverently
[26:29] and have a purpose in heart that God if
[26:33] he would desire to use us in such and
[26:36] such a way but wait till he makes the
[26:39] opening cause he has to go ahead of us
[26:44] and that's what I keep saying we can't
[26:46] challenge comes to churches, silver and
[26:48] gold have I none. We have books and
[26:49] tapes. We had that for the last 50
[26:51] years. Yes. Yes. We can't do that. So we
[26:54] have to wait till God go ahead and then
[26:58] we could know the Russian and malberry
[26:59] tree. We know victory is ours because
[27:02] the spirit is going ahead. Are you with
[27:05] me? So in this time of lingering several
[27:08] things are supposed to happen.
[27:11] This is the time of the revelation of
[27:14] these things being made known. We are
[27:17] still in the time what call it the
[27:20] revelation of these things being made
[27:26] known because God told Daniel go thy
[27:28] way. The book is sealed till the time of
[27:30] the end. God sent a prophet to reveal
[27:33] the whole secret of God for the rapture
[27:36] of the church. And God also said in the
[27:38] days of the voice of the seventh angel.
[27:40] So the prophet flesh has gone 50 years
[27:42] ago but the voice is here. And there
[27:45] were men and ministers speaking back
[27:47] what the prophet said that you will know
[27:49] you are still living in the days of the
[27:52] voice not in the days of the
[27:54] interpretation of the
[27:56] voice because the spirit and the prophet
[27:59] and the bride says the same thing and
[28:01] what they say will have already been
[28:03] said in the word. So what you're hearing
[28:06] from this pulpit is what the prophet
[28:08] said. What he said we believe.
[28:12] Hallelujah. And we are resting on that.
[28:15] Hallelujah. Your faith have to rest upon
[28:18] something. We are resting upon that.
[28:20] You're not resting upon politics. You're
[28:22] not represent of who this man think he
[28:24] is or where he come from. You're resting
[28:26] solemnly on the word of God. Cuz this is
[28:29] our strength. This is what can fail.
[28:32] Heaven will pass away, but this word
[28:35] can't fail. I could fail, but this word
[28:39] can't fail. The church could fail, but
[28:42] this
[28:44] word.
[28:45] Hallelujah. Glory to God. And when we
[28:49] say the word, we mean the revelation of
[28:51] the word. And revelation comes from God.
[28:54] And revelation is faith. Isn't that
[28:56] right? And faith knows no retreat. Faith
[28:59] can't back down. Faith don't give up and
[29:01] let go and get tired and weary. Faith
[29:03] stands anyhow. Oh, glory to God. And God
[29:06] want to give you a rock in your soul.
[29:09] Upon this rock, I will build my church
[29:12] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[29:14] against
[29:19] it. Don't Don't worry. I'm not the
[29:22] preacher. The preacher said coming. He
[29:25] might want me to preach this morning,
[29:26] but I said, "No, we Hallelujah." If he
[29:29] think he's escaping this morning, he's
[29:31] not going to escape this morning. He's
[29:32] commissioned to come here and bring
[29:34] forth the word of God. Hallelujah. So,
[29:36] we're going to linger a while cuz we
[29:39] speaking about a time of lingering.
[29:42] All
[29:44] right. So, this is a time of the
[29:46] revelation of these things being made
[29:48] known. Number one, the revelation of the
[29:51] seven thunders to gather the bride
[29:53] together to show how to be pure to to
[29:56] give a faith revival. And then but Ram
[30:00] said it specifically wait till them
[30:03] seven thunders utter to the voices don't
[30:06] run ahead wait
[30:08] they'll come back with more books and
[30:10] tapes wait no we had that for 50 years
[30:13] after we wait and we get this thing
[30:15] because it's saying you we have some
[30:16] books to hand out after
[30:18] service we wait 50 years to hand out
[30:20] more books no it has to be the word made
[30:23] flesh it has to be a manifestation of
[30:25] God has to be the literal life of Jesus
[30:28] Christ sir back on the earth. There had
[30:30] to be seven living voices that the devil
[30:32] could watch and can't touch.
[30:37] You think the devil really God had to
[30:39] invite him to look at you.
[30:46] The devil just bringing on his own. You
[30:48] know, he gathering his own. He have his
[30:51] own mysteries that will gather his lady
[30:54] together. This woman I don't know bride
[30:57] one call she hell has opened up God have
[31:01] to send seven thunders seven voices that
[31:05] was through seven ages every age
[31:07] overcome every age had overcomer so God
[31:11] know we need all the horsepower from
[31:13] every age
[31:15] every age had overcomer
[31:17] every age had overcomers you can't tell
[31:19] me we ain't have a bunch of overcomers
[31:21] in this life we got to have overcomers
[31:26] Go to send your wife to test you, your
[31:28] husband to test you, your children to
[31:29] test you, your family to test you, your
[31:31] boss, your neighbor, your
[31:33] [Applause]
[31:35] children. God will send sickness to test
[31:38] you when you come on
[31:40] now. Job said, "Don't tell me I trust
[31:43] him. I will
[31:45] wait till my change come."
[31:49] Oh, hallelujah. Glory. Don't give up.
[31:52] Now, you can't give up now. Oh,
[31:55] hallelujah. You come too far to turn
[31:57] back now.
[32:00] [Applause]
[32:02] I'm too close to this revival to get
[32:04] tired and weary. I'm too close to this
[32:07] revival to let all this hinder me and
[32:09] this hinder me and nothing going to
[32:10] hinder me. Hallelujah. And I would tell
[32:13] God will not allow anybody to hinder
[32:14] this church. God will move them out. God
[32:17] will set them down. God will throw them
[32:20] out. It doesn't matter. Nothing going to
[32:22] stop this. This is not the kingdom of
[32:24] man. We talking about the kingdom of
[32:26] [Music]
[32:29] God. You may be season watches a minute.
[32:33] 400 years between Malachi and Matthew
[32:38] or so that Pharisees scribes elect there
[32:41] message to gather
[32:42] them. They lost in space under time of
[32:45] lingering. Amen. Waiting for scriptures
[32:48] to be fulfilled. Hallelujah. Amen.
[32:50] Pharisees think they it statuses think
[32:52] they everybody Herodians all them have
[32:54] the long gong the long thing the scroll
[32:56] everybody healing them out who are bo
[32:57] who wouldn't
[32:59] fool that fightful in that time whatever
[33:01] who in this position that position or
[33:02] what not all of a sudden all of a
[33:05] suddenise
[33:10] angel come take this a little bit get
[33:14] pregnant baby not moving angel talk to
[33:17] Mary no this now watch this behind the
[33:18] scenes Yeah, this is not broadcast on
[33:20] television on newspaper. Well, angel
[33:23] talk to
[33:25] there is no newspaper. There is no text.
[33:28] There is no WhatsApp. There is no facts
[33:30] or email. This is going on behind the
[33:32] scenes. A baby is born.
[33:36] What's what's that time has start?
[33:42] This baby John. Hallelujah. He have a
[33:44] six months ministry to introduce
[33:45] Messiah.
[33:47] He was the He's the voice of one crying
[33:48] over. Isn't that right? So God pull him
[33:51] out. Give him John going over and he
[33:52] waiting for appointed time. The clock of
[33:55] God is ticking because Messiah is
[33:58] coming. Let's say it this way. Dynamics
[34:00] is coming. Clock of God is ticking. Oh
[34:04] hallelujah. We in 2016 now.
[34:09] All of a sudden John come out of the
[34:10] wilderness. We thank every one of
[34:13] you. Amen.
[34:17] That's a disturbance. That's an
[34:18] interruption. The minister association
[34:20] can handle that because he not joining
[34:22] with them. He's not part of their
[34:24] movement or thinking or atmosphere. He's
[34:26] just different. He is radical. He is
[34:29] dressed different, preaching different,
[34:31] and they can't handle him. But he say,
[34:34] "I was sent to make a way."
[34:37] There is one standing among you. John
[34:40] was just different. So all them church
[34:42] people who are accustomed with the
[34:43] Pharisee anointing and the Sadducey
[34:45] anointing and the hypocrite anointing
[34:47] and the joker's anointing and all the
[34:50] entertainment and the pulpit anointing.
[34:52] They couldn't handle John. He said
[34:54] because the axe is laid to the root of
[34:55] the tree and every tree that don't bring
[34:58] forth fruit will be cut
[35:01] off. What's that? Time is about to
[35:04] change from the prophet to the prophecy.
[35:08] prophecy about to be fulfilled when
[35:10] Russia going to get that oil. Watch out.
[35:14] Therefore, the bride have to break into
[35:15] the supernatural realm to get the mind
[35:17] of Christ to know what he wants done
[35:19] with the word to know what God want
[35:24] spoken. And if we get a word in due
[35:26] season, how good it is. You should be
[35:28] blessing and praising and giving glory
[35:31] to God. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[35:33] house.
[35:40] All of a sudden, John John was so
[35:42] convinced he say one stand among you.
[35:45] Jesus had to listen and wait because his
[35:47] spirit had to go in front of him. Then
[35:49] he went. Then the season changed again
[35:51] from the prophet to the prophecy. And
[35:53] that's how Jesus come on the scene.
[35:55] Hallelujah. Call of men called elected.
[35:58] And then afterwards Jesus said my hour
[35:59] is not yet come. What's happening there?
[36:01] He's had to wait fulfill things. When he
[36:04] said my then he said my hour has come.
[36:06] He has to be crucified. He know the
[36:08] pattern. Well, well, you know what's
[36:10] approaching us? Our hour is approaching
[36:12] us.
[36:14] Whether you are ready or not, our hour
[36:17] when I say our hour around the world,
[36:19] all them message people, whether they
[36:21] have interpretation, six seal, no seal,
[36:23] half seal, whatever seal, they have all
[36:25] all cuz the devil is saying what you
[36:28] believe. What you believe? What you
[36:29] believe? What you believe?
[36:33] They deceive with that foolishness.
[36:37] Many that are being in a movie looking
[36:38] for the total.
[36:41] Amen.
[36:43] There'll be two in the bed, one taken,
[36:44] one left. Not two groups, not two
[36:46] church. You're not safe inside of here.
[36:52] You you you can't hide inside of here.
[36:56] How much groups promote theel and test
[36:58] and the church and the church and the
[36:59] ministry and what kind of feeling good
[37:00] about itself right and then what when
[37:03] you read the Bible now you see there's
[37:04] two people
[37:07] oh it's not all are we
[37:14] it's not that I belong here therefore I
[37:16] am okay everybody got a stamp on the
[37:19] passport or something so oh this is not
[37:21] the angel stamp in your book you mean
[37:23] you have to get your mark yourself
[37:26] You mean brother over is not the sealing
[37:27] angel? No. Bible said I saw another
[37:31] angel
[37:32] from the east having the seal of the
[37:36] living God. You mean all this church
[37:39] politics is foolishness? Yes.
[37:42] Hallelujah. You mean this church against
[37:44] that foolishness? Yes. You mean the
[37:46] token is everything? Yes. You mean when
[37:48] I see the blood?
[37:50] Yes. You mean that mighty angel coming
[37:53] to see the B? Yes.
[37:56] [Applause]
[38:04] Hallelujah.
[38:06] The time of lingering brings out who is
[38:08] who.
[38:10] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. My God. My God is
[38:13] awome. Hallelujah.
[38:16] He can move mountains.
[38:19] Hallelujah.
[38:21] My God is awesome. Amen.
[38:27] Who then is that faithful and wise
[38:28] servant whom his lord will a male ruler
[38:31] over his household to give them meat in
[38:33] due season? Blessed is the servant whom
[38:35] his lord when he cometh shall find doing
[38:37] so doing. Verily I say unto you, he
[38:39] shall make him ruler over all the goods
[38:41] his goods. But if here we go that evil
[38:44] servant that evil manvant all them to
[38:47] the servants God say evil servant by
[38:50] over trying to cast a thing on people.
[38:53] No I'm reading the word
[38:57] is that evil servant shall say my lord
[38:59] delay is coming. Aha and shall what?
[39:02] Smite the other servants. Yesmen
[39:07] and shall begin to smite his fellow
[39:08] servants and to eat and drink with the
[39:09] drunken. The lord of that servant shall
[39:11] come in a day when he lookth not for him
[39:13] in all that he not aware way of shall
[39:16] cut him a sand and appoint him his
[39:18] portion with the hypocrites that shall
[39:19] be weeping and nashing of teeth. Yes
[39:21] sir. So I told them in Ghana there are
[39:23] three kind of believers make believers
[39:24] unbelief true believers and there are
[39:26] three kind of
[39:27] ministers good ones evil
[39:30] ones and um true ministers who barang
[39:34] says misunderstand that Elijah
[39:41] And the Holy Spirit told Baran that when
[39:42] he said, "Pick up a pen and write that
[39:44] good, evil, and I call them true
[39:46] ministers that misunderstand that
[39:49] Elijah."
[39:51] Oh, hallelujah. So there's no such thing
[39:53] as a holy church because church have
[39:55] three kind of believers, please.
[39:58] Okay. So therefore, the time of
[40:02] lingering filters out from the shout to
[40:04] the voice. Baram said, "I wish I had the
[40:07] voice of the archangel to bring it to a
[40:09] place where you can see it." So within
[40:11] this time, the seven seed prophetic
[40:13] vision is to be made plain or made
[40:16] clear. So as we get closer, you're not
[40:19] supposed to have more questions and your
[40:21] head hurting you and you're scratching
[40:23] your head while the minister speak
[40:25] because you're clueless about what he is
[40:28] saying. Hallelujah. Jesus opened their
[40:30] understanding to the scriptures that
[40:33] they might know clearly what they're
[40:35] supposed to receive.
[40:37] Hallelujah. So there ought to be no
[40:40] question in your mind as we get nearer.
[40:43] The word supposed to be clearer. The
[40:44] word supposed to be easier, smoother.
[40:48] Hallelujah.
[40:50] Oh, glory to God. He opened their
[40:52] understanding and he opened the word.
[40:54] They couldn't miss it if they tried.
[40:57] Peter was unlearned.
[41:00] Peter was a fisherman, but yet he stood
[41:03] there and said, "This is that
[41:07] [Applause]
[41:09] that the prophet Joel spake of." Why?
[41:12] Because Jesus revealed to them this
[41:15] going to be that. When this happened,
[41:18] this vindicates that. Come on, say
[41:20] somebody. This is the promise here. This
[41:23] is the promise of God. Wait for
[41:27] it. Don't take it by faith. Wait for it.
[41:31] I will wait till my change comes. Oh,
[41:35] give the Lord. Change is coming and I'm
[41:37] going to wait for it. Nobody going to
[41:40] tell me I have it already. I've got it
[41:42] to get it. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[41:44] the
[41:46] [Applause]
[41:49] house. I'm not buying no paper.
[41:53] Hallelujah.
[41:55] Praise the name of the Lord.
[41:57] Okay, because Habac says, "Write the
[41:59] vision." Almost done. I'm going to wrap
[42:01] up. Habac said, "Write the vision." I
[42:04] make it plain that he has read me a run.
[42:06] So the third pull comes to bring the
[42:10] bride to the opening of the word.
[42:13] Hallelujah. But the prophet brought the
[42:15] word. So the third pull going to bring
[42:17] you back to the what the prophet said.
[42:20] But now your eyes are open. What's the
[42:23] sense God show you when you can't see?
[42:28] God have to open your eyes then he
[42:30] brings your word. You hear what I said?
[42:34] He open your eyes and bring to you your
[42:37] word.
[42:39] [Applause]
[42:40] When you see the word, you see you in
[42:43] the word. Then it becomes your word.
[42:49] Oh hallelujah. So you get caught up in
[42:52] being part of the prophet's prophecy.
[42:55] The people that know their God shall be
[42:58] strong. You know, tears and weeping and
[43:01] frung and depression all these years,
[43:03] but you're going to know him. You're
[43:05] going to know him. You're going to know
[43:08] at that day, you shall know him. And the
[43:11] father heal me and I you're going to
[43:13] know him according to
[43:16] 14:20. All right.
[43:19] Okay.
[43:21] Job said, "I'll wait till my change
[43:22] come." That must be our testimony. Men
[43:26] who run ahead always causes problems in
[43:30] God's program. God is about to remove
[43:33] the rocks that will fend on his holy
[43:36] mountain. Every obstacle in the way of
[43:39] dynamics, every man in the way of
[43:41] dynamics, God will move out of the way.
[43:43] There will be no more delay. Noah had to
[43:46] wait 120 years plus 7 days. Abraham 25
[43:51] years. Jesus 3 and 1/2 years. John 6
[43:54] months. Disciples in upper room 10 days.
[43:57] The waiting had to do with proving and
[43:59] testing his sons and also God's
[44:02] appointed time. But abandon calls it the
[44:05] process of character development,
[44:08] waiting on God and waiting for God.
[44:11] Amen. But abandon was born a prophet
[44:13] born and yet God commissioned him to do
[44:16] work of evangelist until he was
[44:18] positionally placed by God after being
[44:21] tested and tried. He became a placed
[44:24] vindicated son. Amen. Malachi 4 said
[44:27] that these virtues of faith, virtue,
[44:29] knowledge, etc. are to be proven to be
[44:31] in us. Then we are vindicated and
[44:34] placed. How dare any man claim to be in
[44:36] the five ministry per se without being
[44:39] proven, tested, vindicated and being
[44:42] placed. This is not talking by faith.
[44:46] This must be a manifested reality.
[44:48] Hallelujah. There is no true Bible
[44:50] fivefold ministry outside the process
[44:52] that was laid down by the prophet
[44:54] William Brown. Amen. There are no
[44:56] shortcuts. Amen. This time of lingering
[44:58] introduces the space of grace according
[45:01] to Revelation 22:17 to pick up our
[45:04] families. Hallelujah. And our loved ones
[45:07] along with Thomas who will not believe
[45:09] except be touched.
[45:12] We are in the time of judgment between
[45:14] the four angels stopping the wars of
[45:15] World War I and two and the sealing of
[45:18] the Jews. We are right in that time. We
[45:20] in a time in America 13 begin to speak
[45:23] like a dragon and will kill freedom of
[45:26] religion. What a time we are living in.
[45:28] This is going to be happening that the
[45:31] scriptures might be fulfilled. And I'll
[45:33] close with this one scripture. You have
[45:35] to find it. And I read
[45:38] it across there from Exodus 32 verse
[45:42] 1-4. This is when Moses went up and have
[45:45] his time of lingering to get
[45:46] instructions from God. Listen to these
[45:48] words. And when the people saw that
[45:50] Moses delayed to come down out of the
[45:53] mount, the people gathered themselves
[45:55] unto Aaron and said unto him, "Make us
[45:57] gods,
[45:59] which shall go before us. For as this
[46:02] Moses, the man that brought us up out of
[46:04] the land of Egypt, we don't know what
[46:06] become of him.
[46:08] Aaron said unto him, bring off break off
[46:11] gold earrings and your ears and of your
[46:13] wise and so Aaron gain
[46:16] revelation say give us a god and he
[46:18] looking to make a god one time for them.
[46:20] Bing gold
[46:21] bing. All the people who bring out the
[46:23] golden earrings were in the ears and
[46:26] brought them to Aaron and received them
[46:28] at their hand and fashioned it with a
[46:30] graven tool. And after he made a molten
[46:33] calf, he said unto them, "These be your
[46:35] gods, O Israel, who brought you in the
[46:37] land of Egypt. You wore God. Look one,
[46:40] take that." And that is what happens
[46:43] when people don't want to wait.
[46:45] when they don't want to wait upon
[46:47] instruction supernatural God's guidance
[46:50] they make confession God but notice when
[46:53] Moses come down about who on the Lord's
[46:54] side Aaron is stupid enough to go and
[46:56] stay with that hol you know Aaron was
[46:58] one of the first one to run towards
[47:00] Moses side you know all the god he
[47:02] fashion all the molten thing he do Aaron
[47:04] do that wrong you know so when Moses say
[47:06] who on the Lord's side say I'm not with
[47:09] them you know I got this for you only
[47:11] pressure me to make mol god and what I g
[47:14] You better know. Don't be a stupid
[47:16] virgin. Don't be a foolish virgin. Come
[47:19] on. Don't be a stupid because five was
[47:22] stupid. Five were idiotic. They had lamp
[47:25] and no oil. However, light. Come on, say
[47:29] somebody. Hallelujah. Praise God. Be a
[47:32] wise virgin. Give me oil in my lamp. Oh,
[47:37] give me all in my lap. Give me burning.
[47:43] Give me oil in my life I

[47:53] me burning. Oh, keep me burning till the
[47:59] break say give me oil. Give me oil in my

[48:27] Oh, praise
[48:28] God. Oh, hallelujah. Well, this morning,
[48:30] brother isn't going to come to us to
[48:32] preach the word of God. But today, I
[48:35] want to say he'll be acting. He's
[48:36] standing in a position of acting
[48:38] assistant pastor. Praise the name of the
[48:41] Lord. So that is where he's going to be.
[48:43] So the assistant pastor going to come
[48:45] and minister to you this morning. So in
[48:48] my absence, Isaac going to be the point
[48:50] man accountable and responsible for the
[48:52] church operation. And when we are not
[48:55] here, both Isaac and I, but Steven Ali,
[48:58] he's going to stand in the gap there to
[49:00] be responsible and accountable. We will
[49:02] talk more about things after the
[49:05] service. Amen. But give me oil in my
[49:09] lung to keep me burning. Oh, give
[49:15] me I pray.
[49:19] Give
[49:20] [Music]
[49:27] [Music]
[49:32] me
[49:41] sing to the king.
[49:46] Oh
[49:54] sing to the king. Can we give the Lord a
[49:59] hand of praise? Give him worship. Give
[50:02] him glory. Give him honor. Give him
[50:12] thanksgiving. Amen. and blessed be the
[50:14] name of the Lord. Will you may be seated
[50:16] for a few
[50:18] minutes? Happy new year. And I pray that
[50:22] this year would be your year of harvest
[50:24] and blessing and outpouring to you and
[50:27] your family and your loved ones. And for
[50:30] your loved ones that are not here, this
[50:32] will be the year to see them come into
[50:33] the house of God. for your family that's
[50:36] not here. I believe that this is the
[50:38] year when God is going to with a mighty
[50:40] hand deliver his sons and his daughters
[50:43] from whatever condition, whatever
[50:45] situation, whatever bondage, whatever
[50:47] sickness, whatever confusion, whatever
[50:50] depression, whatever frustration,
[50:52] whatever tiredness, and God is going to
[50:55] with a mighty hand bring them out in
[50:57] this year. We got to speak it. We got to
[50:59] claim it. We got to accept it. We got to
[51:02] believe it. and we going to see it
[51:03] happen. Can the church say amen?
[51:06] You appreciate the
[51:08] pastor. Amen. Many
[51:11] amen. Well, I'm humbled by the
[51:13] confidence to serve and by the grace of
[51:16] God, I'll do my best. He knows I'm I'm a
[51:20] reluctant preacher. I'm a very unwilling
[51:23] preacher. I always like to be in the
[51:24] back and
[51:26] somehow God seems to have other plans.
[51:29] So, by the grace of God, we're going to
[51:31] endeavor to do what God wants us to do.
[51:34] Amen. And um it was really a great
[51:37] convention in Ghana. It was a great
[51:39] honor to be there and to serve and to
[51:41] see God's people go free. And every
[51:44] service was so tremendous. And the Lord
[51:46] placed on my heart a message, one taken,
[51:48] one left. And just to echo what Brother
[51:52] said, God isn't coming for one group and
[51:54] taking one group and leaving another
[51:57] group. He's not coming for one church
[51:58] and taking one church and leaving
[52:00] another church. He's looking for
[52:02] individuals. He is looking for people
[52:05] who are called out, who are separated,
[52:08] and will do everything because they
[52:11] count eternity more than what is
[52:13] natural. They place more importance on
[52:16] the things of God than the things of
[52:19] this world. Can the church say amen? So
[52:22] I'm here to encourage you as the first
[52:25] message of 2016 because I believe time
[52:28] is short and when you read the news and
[52:31] all of the news is just confirmation of
[52:33] what God's prophet said so many many
[52:35] years ago to see Russia bearing its
[52:38] strength to see America doing what they
[52:40] do getting into position. What about the
[52:42] bride? What about the bride of Jesus
[52:44] Christ? And you know it's so sad how
[52:46] many people have gone through this
[52:48] message and you don't see them anymore.
[52:52] There are people walking who know the
[52:53] truth. There are many people who were
[52:55] here in the 60s7s 80s 90s. There are
[52:59] people who know of the prophecies and
[53:00] they walk the streets and they live
[53:02] anyway they want. They drink, they
[53:04] smoke, they carry on and yet they still
[53:06] know the prophecies. And sometimes when
[53:08] you meet them on the road, they shake
[53:10] your hand and they ask you how things
[53:11] going and they they actually quote
[53:13] scripture and quotes from the prophet to
[53:15] you and they talk about, you know,
[53:17] judgment is coming. And some of them are
[53:19] quick to preach. You know, are you on
[53:21] fire? And they're living there and
[53:22] living any kind of
[53:24] life convinced but not concerned. They
[53:27] know God sent a prophet. They know the
[53:29] Bible is real, but there's no
[53:30] desperation in their souls. Amen. They
[53:33] know Los Angeles is going to sink.
[53:35] Glory. And I always wonder because I
[53:38] believe the bride will be here when Los
[53:39] Angeles sings. You know the kind of
[53:41] service is going to have after Los
[53:43] Angeles sings
[53:44] [Music]
[53:46] because people are going to come running
[53:47] out of the woodwork saying, "Lord, I'm
[53:49] coming home." But who knows? It might be
[53:53] too late. Amen. Amen. Because God's
[53:55] clock and his countdown, I believe, has
[53:58] already started.
[54:00] God already is counting down to get his
[54:02] bride out of here. Oh yeah. So before we
[54:05] leave this place, we got to put
[54:07] everything in position. Cut everything
[54:10] out that not supposed to be there and
[54:12] put everything in that's supposed to be
[54:14] there. Can the church say amen?
[54:17] Thank you musicians. Before I get to the
[54:20] message, I just want to share a few
[54:21] things to kind of lay a background
[54:23] before I get to the text this morning.
[54:26] And
[54:27] um I believe that the season has really
[54:30] changed and in the message the world is
[54:32] falling apart. Brother Brandham said,
[54:34] "Friends, we are not promised a system.
[54:36] We not coming to church just to have
[54:38] church. Jesus wouldn't have nothing to
[54:40] do with a system. We wasn't promised a
[54:43] system. We were promised a kingdom." And
[54:46] how do you get into it? By one spirit.
[54:49] We are all baptized into this kingdom.
[54:52] So, I'm not sure what you came to church
[54:54] for this morning. But I pray that you
[54:57] came to church to be in that kingdom.
[54:59] And if you don't have the Holy Ghost, if
[55:02] you don't have an experience, people
[55:04] make all kinds of New Year's
[55:06] resolutions. You should have only one
[55:09] resolution. Lord, I want an experience.
[55:13] I want the token. I want the Holy Ghost.
[55:16] Because God is not asking you what
[55:19] church you belong to, who your pastor
[55:21] is, how long you're in the message, what
[55:24] books did you read. He's not interested
[55:26] in that. He's interested in one thing.
[55:29] and one thing only. Do you have the
[55:31] token? Do you have a testimony? Do you
[55:35] have the life? Do you have what it takes
[55:37] to get out of here? Can the church say
[55:40] amen?
[55:41] So that is my focus this morning. That's
[55:44] the only thing I'm interested in. Not to
[55:46] be another message church, not to just
[55:49] come to church, but Lord, we have a need
[55:51] this morning. I can't live on his
[55:54] experience. I can't live on brother
[55:56] Pam's experience. I can't live on
[55:59] Moses's experience. I can't live on
[56:02] Joshua's experience. I can't live on my
[56:05] mother's experience. I need an
[56:07] experience for
[56:11] myself. Oh, you don't hear me this
[56:13] morning. You don't hear me this morning.
[56:16] If you don't have an experience, you
[56:19] should be shaking this morning. Because
[56:21] without an experience, you're not going
[56:23] to make it. Uh if you don't have the
[56:25] Holy Ghost, uh you are not going to make
[56:27] it. Uh and the Holy Ghost will make you
[56:30] behave a certain way every single time.
[56:33] Uh so if you're up and you're down and
[56:35] you're in and you're out, you need
[56:37] another experience. You need another
[56:39] touch from God. Can the church say
[56:43] amen? We're going to preach in a minute,
[56:46] but I want to nail down. We are not part
[56:48] of a group. We are not part of an
[56:50] association. We are individuals uh who
[56:53] have come from the east, from the west,
[56:55] from the north and the south. And we
[56:57] have gathered because the words of the
[56:59] son of man are being echoed in plain
[57:02] view so that the living reality of the
[57:05] living God can be made real to us. It is
[57:08] not good enough to know that God is
[57:10] real. What I want to know is he's real
[57:13] to me. I don't want to know about what
[57:16] he did for somebody else. But this year,
[57:19] I want to know what he did for
[57:20] [Applause]
[57:27] me. Hallelujah. It's easy to talk about
[57:31] what God did for the prophet. It's easy
[57:34] to talk about what God did for the
[57:35] pastor. It's easy to talk about what he
[57:38] did in the scripture. But what has the
[57:40] Lord done for you? What is your
[57:42] testimony? When I see the blood, I pass
[57:45] over you. Can you testify that you have
[57:47] met the pillar of fire that was Moses's
[57:50] testimony? What is your testimony? Young
[57:53] brother, young sister, because if you
[57:56] have a testimony, then the world has no
[57:58] attraction for you. Sin has no
[58:01] attraction for you. Can the church say
[58:05] amen? Oh,
[58:07] hallelujah.
[58:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We serve notice
[58:13] this morning against every sickness.
[58:15] Yes, I serve notice this morning. Satan,
[58:19] the blood of Jesus is against you. We
[58:22] serve notice against the demons that try
[58:25] to stop you from worshiping. We serve
[58:27] notice about that demon that tells you
[58:30] you should backslide and you should give
[58:32] up. We serve notice this morning to
[58:35] every demon in hell, every demon in your
[58:38] mind, every demon in your body, every
[58:40] demon in your spirit. We serve notice.
[58:44] We serve notice to your family. We serve
[58:46] notice to your children. We serve notice
[58:49] to your husband. We serve notice to your
[58:51] wife. We serve notice for you and your
[58:54] house. As for me and my house, we will
[58:57] serve the Lord. This is the Lord's
[59:00] doing. It is marvelous. It is marvelous.
[59:04] He's not going to lose one. He's not
[59:06] going to lose
[59:08] one. God is real. The message is real.
[59:13] He's the same yesterday. He is the same
[59:16] today. He is the same forever. You may
[59:19] be
[59:20] seated. The message is not the problem.
[59:24] The message is a vindicated message. The
[59:27] prophet is not a problem. The prophet is
[59:30] a vindicated prophet. The problem is the
[59:32] individuals who want to twist the
[59:35] message to their own purpose. But I want
[59:38] all that the prophet said belongs to me.
[59:41] I want all the scripture says belongs to
[59:43] me because one of these days uh there'll
[59:46] be no more church services. One of these
[59:48] days there'll be no more meetings. And
[59:51] it'll take the power on the inside to
[59:54] transform the
[59:58] outside. You may be seated.
[1:00:00] [Applause]
[1:00:02] We haven't seen persecution yet. We
[1:00:06] haven't seen problems yet. And for those
[1:00:09] of you who feel you're so stressed out
[1:00:11] and you're so bothered, listen to this.
[1:00:13] In the book of Hebrews chapter 10 and
[1:00:16] verse
[1:00:17] 32, Paul says, "But call to
[1:00:21] remembrance the former days in which
[1:00:24] after ye were illuminated, ye endured a
[1:00:28] great fight of afflictions." So Paul is
[1:00:30] exalting the church. I want you to
[1:00:33] remember when you came out of darkness.
[1:00:36] That's when the pressure started in your
[1:00:38] life. Uh people like to the Pentecostals
[1:00:40] can't preach this because they want you
[1:00:42] to believe that when you come into
[1:00:43] Jesus, everything will be all right and
[1:00:46] it's going to be a a bed of roses. But
[1:00:48] Paul is saying, I want you to remember
[1:00:50] that when you came out of darkness,
[1:00:53] there was a heat turn up in your life.
[1:00:54] Uh there was trouble in your life
[1:00:56] because the devil doesn't want to lose
[1:00:58] you. He doesn't want to release you. He
[1:01:01] want that demon to stay on you. He wants
[1:01:03] that sickness to hold you. He want that
[1:01:05] spirit of fornication to reside in your
[1:01:08] soul. He wants you to commit adultery.
[1:01:11] He wants that spirit of pornography to
[1:01:13] sit there. But we serve notice
[1:01:17] today. We know who our God is. We know
[1:01:20] who we are serving. We know what we
[1:01:23] worship.
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:31] You may be seated. Brother Brandon said,
[1:01:33] "For re for we receive a kingdom that
[1:01:36] cannot be moved." Cannot be moved.
[1:01:40] Governments change, prime ministers
[1:01:42] change, empires change, currencies
[1:01:46] change.
[1:01:48] But we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:01:51] moved. You could take that to the bank.
[1:01:54] People trembling. They're skimming in
[1:01:56] the accounts. You know, one day your
[1:01:57] money will be worth nothing because you
[1:01:59] won't be able to buy or sell unless you
[1:02:01] take the mark of the beast. It's what
[1:02:03] skimming got to do. Then all of these
[1:02:05] things around you just to shake the
[1:02:07] world, keep the world. And then the
[1:02:09] Bible calls it men's hearts failing for
[1:02:12] fear. The situation intensifying because
[1:02:15] the God of this evil age knows that
[1:02:18] there are people coming into power.
[1:02:20] There's a people in the land who are
[1:02:22] coming into power. Brother Brandham said
[1:02:25] the moment you realize who you are, then
[1:02:28] the devil is finished, he calls it an
[1:02:31] invincible army, an unstoppable people,
[1:02:34] Joel's army, a people that the devil
[1:02:37] can't move around, can't push
[1:02:41] around. I'm talking to you this morning.
[1:02:44] I'm not talking to your past. I'm not
[1:02:46] talking to your mistakes. I'm not
[1:02:47] talking to what you did. I'm not talking
[1:02:49] a 2015 that's over. Thank God it's over.
[1:02:54] Paul said forgetting the things that
[1:02:55] have passed. I press I press I press
[1:03:00] towards the mark. So I come this morning
[1:03:03] to say church let's press towards
[1:03:05] perfection. Let's press to adoption.
[1:03:08] Let's press to see the seven thunders
[1:03:11] utter their voices to that group who
[1:03:13] could take the
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:19] word.
[1:03:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not
[1:03:24] satisfied coming to church. I'm not
[1:03:27] satisfied being a church member. I'm not
[1:03:30] satisfied hearing good messages. I'm not
[1:03:33] satisfied hearing good singing. I'm not
[1:03:36] even satisfied hearing good preaching.
[1:03:38] I'm not satisfied until I see the living
[1:03:41] God living inside my heart. I'm not
[1:03:44] satisfied just coming to church. I'm not
[1:03:47] satisfied with a cold lukewarm religion.
[1:03:50] I'm not satisfied being in the message.
[1:03:54] Give me liberty or give me debt. Give me
[1:03:57] freedom or give me
[1:04:00] debt. Is that how you feel this morning?
[1:04:03] These old bones they are rejoicing this
[1:04:06] morning. Your cells in your body, they
[1:04:08] are rejoicing this morning. The trees uh
[1:04:11] they are groaning this morning because
[1:04:13] they are waiting for the manifestation
[1:04:16] of the sons of God. Uh those men and
[1:04:18] women uh who come from the God class. Uh
[1:04:21] they come from God. Uh they are going
[1:04:23] back to God. One day you will look at
[1:04:26] sickness. You wouldn't even have to
[1:04:27] speak because sickness will tremble at
[1:04:30] the very
[1:04:31] presence of sons and daughters of the
[1:04:34] living
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:37] God. You may be seated. One time there
[1:04:40] was a lady with a brand was ministering.
[1:04:43] There was prayer lines. She was watching
[1:04:45] what was going on. She came to the
[1:04:47] meeting sick. She was in her crutches.
[1:04:50] She see people getting healed. And after
[1:04:52] a while, she humbled her way up to the
[1:04:54] prophet and just looked at the prophet.
[1:04:57] He didn't even pray for her. Her fate
[1:04:59] was so anointed. She just took the
[1:05:02] crutches and handed it and walked away
[1:05:05] because the atmosphere was right. The
[1:05:07] anointing was all over the place. And
[1:05:09] the word was being spoken and the word
[1:05:12] carries the
[1:05:15] anointing. You may be seated. So what
[1:05:18] are you saying, preacher?
[1:05:20] No matter the fear and the concern and
[1:05:25] the situation that the disciples had,
[1:05:28] they made it their business to be in the
[1:05:30] upper room because in the right
[1:05:33] atmosphere, everything could be changed.
[1:05:36] In the right atmosphere, your situation
[1:05:39] could be resolved. All you got to do is
[1:05:41] get to the upper room. You had to be in
[1:05:44] the upper room. That's why Paul exhorted
[1:05:47] the church. Don't forsake the assembling
[1:05:50] of yourselves together because something
[1:05:52] happens. You might have a little small
[1:05:54] spark and you have a little small spark
[1:05:56] and you have a little small spark. But
[1:05:58] when these sparks come together, there's
[1:06:00] a fire that begins to connect. But the
[1:06:03] brand said that's a pillar of fire. It's
[1:06:06] a little piece over there. It's a little
[1:06:07] piece over there. But when it comes
[1:06:09] together, God is pleased because he
[1:06:11] loves fellowship. He loves communion. He
[1:06:14] loves relationship. That's why we come
[1:06:17] into the house of God. That's why David
[1:06:20] said, "I was glad when they said unto
[1:06:22] me, let us go into the house of
[1:06:25] [Applause]
[1:06:27] God." You may be seated. We're going to
[1:06:30] preach in a minute, but I want to make
[1:06:32] sure that we are going to the same
[1:06:34] place. I want to make sure we have the
[1:06:37] same destination.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] Amen.
[1:06:48] There are people who like to go because
[1:06:49] of the
[1:06:50] ride. There are people following Jesus,
[1:06:53] because of the activity,
[1:06:55] because of the bread, because of the
[1:06:57] fish, because for all the years they
[1:07:00] were in church and never saw what Jesus
[1:07:01] did, but they had no real revelation.
[1:07:06] Question. 5,000 people got bread and
[1:07:10] fish. Next service, 67,000. The church
[1:07:13] growing. How many made it to the upper
[1:07:15] room? 120. Where were all those
[1:07:18] believers who were there listening to
[1:07:20] Jesus?
[1:07:22] Amen. Where were they? In the upper
[1:07:26] room. They heard him preach. They saw
[1:07:30] miracles. They witnessed bread being
[1:07:32] multiplied. They witnessed fish being
[1:07:35] multiplied. And you couldn't find them
[1:07:37] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:07:40] Seeing is not enough. Hearing is not
[1:07:43] enough. There must be a desire to act
[1:07:46] upon the word of God and apply the token
[1:07:49] to your
[1:07:51] house. It is not the responsibility of
[1:07:54] the pastor to apply blood on your house.
[1:07:58] He has to apply on his house.
[1:08:02] Oh, you don't hear me this morning. It
[1:08:04] is not the responsibility of the
[1:08:05] minister to come and put blood on your
[1:08:08] house. You have to apply it in your
[1:08:11] house. You have to plead for your house.
[1:08:14] You have to cry out for your house. You
[1:08:17] have to seek God for your house. You got
[1:08:19] to carry for your
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:23] house. You cannot blame the pastor. You
[1:08:26] cannot blame the elder for your house.
[1:08:30] It's one thing if the word is not being
[1:08:32] spoken with clarity and with zeal and
[1:08:35] with enthusiasm, but if the word is
[1:08:38] clear to you, then it is up to you to
[1:08:40] act. Moses told him, "Kill a lamb
[1:08:45] without blemish."
[1:08:47] There's no argument, no debate, no
[1:08:49] interpretation, and take that blood and
[1:08:51] put it on the door because the dead
[1:08:53] angel is passing by. He's not asking how
[1:08:56] much money you have, what job you have,
[1:08:58] how long you a Jew, what tribe you
[1:09:00] belong to, whether you a Levite or you a
[1:09:03] God or whatever you are. When I see the
[1:09:06] blood,
[1:09:07] I'll pass over you.
[1:09:11] That angel is not compromising about
[1:09:13] that. When I see the blood, I will pass
[1:09:16] over you. But I've been a Jew all my
[1:09:19] life. That has nothing to do with it.
[1:09:21] When I see the blood, I'll pass over
[1:09:23] you. But I'm in church every Sunday.
[1:09:25] That has nothing to do with it. When I
[1:09:28] see the blood, I'll pass over you. When
[1:09:31] I pay my tithe, that has nothing to do
[1:09:33] with it. When I see the blood,
[1:09:37] I will pass
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:40] over
[1:09:41] you. Only blood will speak of your
[1:09:46] testimony. Only blood will speak of your
[1:09:50] action. Only the blood. I don't want to
[1:09:53] hear you explain that you know what the
[1:09:55] blood is. I don't want you to describe
[1:09:58] the blood. I don't want you to tell me
[1:10:00] about the seven virtues and the seven
[1:10:01] thunders. I want you to apply the blood
[1:10:06] because the blood for our day is the
[1:10:08] life of Christ. And brother Brandon
[1:10:10] taught us anybody could speak, anybody
[1:10:12] could preach, but the thunder that
[1:10:15] shakes the devil is that life. So when I
[1:10:18] see the blood, when I see you forgive,
[1:10:21] then I'll pass over you. When I see you
[1:10:24] have temperance, then I'll pass over
[1:10:26] you. When I see you have patience, then
[1:10:28] I'll pass over you. When I see you have
[1:10:31] brotherly kindness, then I'll pass over
[1:10:36] you. When I see the
[1:10:40] blood, seven perfect
[1:10:42] spirits, seven dead, seven birds, then
[1:10:45] I'll pass over you.
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:52] Ezekiel 9 says to seal an angel with the
[1:10:55] ink horn right now moving through the
[1:10:57] camp and to begin in the sanctuary.
[1:11:01] Begin in the church. Begin at the
[1:11:03] ancient men. beginner. Those who know
[1:11:06] better, who have been in the message for
[1:11:07] a long time and they are playing the
[1:11:10] fool.
[1:11:11] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:17] Gotten lazy.
[1:11:19] No prayer, no
[1:11:22] consecration, no
[1:11:24] dedication, no zeal to serve God, no
[1:11:27] zeal to
[1:11:28] testify. I wonder if some of you really
[1:11:30] love your families.
[1:11:33] You have loved ones and you don't talk
[1:11:34] to them about Jesus. You have families
[1:11:37] and you don't testify about what God did
[1:11:39] for you. Have no testimony at all. They
[1:11:43] are more of an influence on you than you
[1:11:45] on them because you are weak and you
[1:11:48] don't have guts and you don't you're not
[1:11:51] bold enough. That's why be bold. Be
[1:11:53] strong. Be courageous.
[1:11:57] Be very courageous.
[1:11:59] Give us men of God. give us David's back
[1:12:02] in the church who will say, "I need
[1:12:04] help.
[1:12:07] My son needs help and I'm going to come
[1:12:09] to the church and lay at the altar
[1:12:11] prostrate before God until my son walks
[1:12:14] into the house of
[1:12:17] God.
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:19] People choked by the cares of life,
[1:12:23] choked by ambition, choked by greed,
[1:12:26] choked by the desire to make money,
[1:12:28] choked by the desire for recognition,
[1:12:31] choked by the desire to be a somebody.
[1:12:34] And when God is looking for nobody's
[1:12:37] because he's the only body that matters,
[1:12:42] can the church say amen? Yeah, I'm going
[1:12:45] to read a scripture in a little while,
[1:12:46] but I believe when we come to church
[1:12:48] now, we come to church to tar in his
[1:12:50] presence and to get strength to fight
[1:12:52] the battle because there's not much more
[1:12:54] time left. That's why the Bible said as
[1:12:56] the day approaches, we supposed to meet
[1:12:58] more frequently
[1:13:00] because we are getting into rapturing
[1:13:02] condition
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:07] the world is falling apart. says, "I
[1:13:09] look for a rapture." And this is scary.
[1:13:12] For just a handful of
[1:13:16] people, that's right. Just a handful of
[1:13:19] people, they'll never be missed in the
[1:13:21] world.
[1:13:24] Now, when I preached this, I preached
[1:13:26] this same quote in the message rapturing
[1:13:28] condition.
[1:13:30] And a brother called me because when I
[1:13:32] said this, I said, "Church, if this
[1:13:35] whole church disappears, that will be
[1:13:37] kind of obvious."
[1:13:41] Because if the prophet said they're not
[1:13:43] going to be missed, it means it's really
[1:13:45] a handful of people will go into the
[1:13:48] rapture.
[1:13:49] If this whole church disappears, that's
[1:13:52] kind of a red flag. That's right. Amen.
[1:13:56] So it means from out of the church, God
[1:13:58] is calling a bride.
[1:14:02] So I charge you and I challenge you
[1:14:05] young man, young woman. You could be 99
[1:14:08] years old or 9 years old. You make your
[1:14:11] calling and election sure. This has
[1:14:13] nothing to do with your husband, your
[1:14:15] wife, your child, your boss, your
[1:14:16] neighbor. This has everything to do with
[1:14:19] the eternal destination of your soul.
[1:14:22] Because this earth is going to pass
[1:14:24] away.
[1:14:27] Heaven and earth will pass away. But not
[1:14:29] this word. This is going to come to
[1:14:31] pass. And the devil will be so mad with
[1:14:35] those who go into the rapture. He will
[1:14:37] come to h the remnant. The church
[1:14:39] members who were sitting in the same
[1:14:42] services but didn't act upon the word.
[1:14:47] Lord, give me strength.
[1:14:50] put that burden in my heart to make my
[1:14:52] heart right with God. Is that your
[1:14:55] prayer this morning?
[1:14:57] Is that your desire
[1:15:00] to have an experience with God that goes
[1:15:03] beyond coming to church for you and your
[1:15:06] house? Can we all stand to our feet?
[1:15:10] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:15:14] I want to read one
[1:15:17] portion of
[1:15:20] scripture to encourage
[1:15:25] you for this new
[1:15:28] year. And we're going to read from the
[1:15:30] book of
[1:15:31] Hebrews, chapter 10, and we're going to
[1:15:34] read from verse 35.
[1:15:45] Hebrews chapter 10 and reading verse
[1:15:52] 35. And the Bible says, "Cast not away
[1:15:55] therefore your
[1:15:57] confidence which hath great recompense
[1:16:01] of reward.
[1:16:04] For ye have need of
[1:16:07] patience, that after ye have done the
[1:16:10] will of God, you might receive the
[1:16:12] promise.
[1:16:15] For yet a little while, and he that
[1:16:17] shall come will come and will not tarry.
[1:16:23] Now the just shall live by fate. And if
[1:16:28] any man draw back, if any man backslide,
[1:16:31] if any man turns away, my soul shall
[1:16:34] have no pleasure in
[1:16:35] him. But we are not of them who draw
[1:16:39] back unto predition, but of them that
[1:16:42] believe to the saving of the soul.
[1:16:47] I want to read this one more time, but
[1:16:49] from the
[1:16:51] amplified. It says, "Do not therefore
[1:16:53] fling away your fearless confidence, for
[1:16:57] it carries a great and glorious
[1:17:00] compensation of
[1:17:02] reward. For you have need of steadfast
[1:17:06] patience and
[1:17:07] endurance, so that you may perform and
[1:17:10] fully accomplish the will of God, and
[1:17:13] thus receive and carry away and enjoy to
[1:17:17] the full what is promised. for still a
[1:17:20] little while, a very little while, and
[1:17:23] the coming one will come, and he will
[1:17:26] not delay. Amen. But the just shall live
[1:17:29] by fate. My righteous servant shall live
[1:17:32] by his conviction, respecting man's
[1:17:35] relationship to God and divine things,
[1:17:38] and holy f and holy fervor, born of
[1:17:42] faith, and conjoined with it. And if he
[1:17:44] draws back and shrinks in fear, my soul
[1:17:48] has no delight or pleasure in him. But
[1:17:51] our way is not of those who draw back to
[1:17:54] eternal misery, predition, and are
[1:17:57] utterly destroyed, but we are of those
[1:18:00] who believe, who cleave to and trust in
[1:18:03] and rely on God through Jesus Christ the
[1:18:06] Messiah, and by faith preserve the soul.
[1:18:09] Shall we bow our heads in a word of
[1:18:11] prayer? Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:18:14] Lord, we are so touched this morning to
[1:18:17] be in your presence, Lord, on this
[1:18:20] Sunday morning service, Lord. There are
[1:18:22] so many people, Father, who have lost
[1:18:24] their way. And Lord, we come this
[1:18:26] morning to be encouraged, to be edified,
[1:18:29] to be built up, Lord. And Lord, as your
[1:18:31] word says, to cast not away our
[1:18:34] confidence, Father, but to move boldly
[1:18:36] with faith and go forward, Lord. not
[1:18:38] drawing back to lose our souls but
[1:18:41] pressing towards the mark. Father, may
[1:18:44] you touch your people this morning.
[1:18:45] Father, may you bless the reading of the
[1:18:47] word, the hearing of it. May you bless
[1:18:49] those who are connected on the internet.
[1:18:51] May you bless those who would hear this
[1:18:53] tape when it is played. May you be with
[1:18:55] your people for the next few minutes.
[1:18:57] May you open our understanding to the
[1:18:59] scriptures and speak to us in the
[1:19:01] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[1:19:03] church says, "Amen." Amen. And amen and
[1:19:06] amen and amen. You may be seated.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah. I have a title this morning.
[1:19:11] It is cast not away your confidence. And
[1:19:16] my inspiration fully persuaded that the
[1:19:19] promise will be fulfilled. Cast not away
[1:19:23] your confidence. I want you to turn to
[1:19:25] your brother, sister, greet them and
[1:19:26] tell them cast not away your confidence.
[1:19:39] I just want to make sure nobody is
[1:19:41] sleeping.
[1:19:43] Everybody feeling fine? Wonderful.
[1:19:47] So Paul is speaking here in the book of
[1:19:49] Hebrews. Cast not away your confidence.
[1:19:52] Amen. Amen. Confidence is faith. It's
[1:19:56] trust. It's assurance. When you are
[1:20:00] confident, you are bold. You are sure.
[1:20:03] You are persuaded. Nothing can move you.
[1:20:05] You are fearless. You are aggressive.
[1:20:08] When you are not confident, you you need
[1:20:10] permission.
[1:20:12] You need approval. I'm not I'm not sure.
[1:20:14] This thing looking good. This tie
[1:20:15] matching the shirt. I really not too
[1:20:17] confident to go out there with this
[1:20:19] door. You're not sure. You're tentative.
[1:20:21] You are hesitant. You are easily
[1:20:23] influenced. So Paul is exalting the
[1:20:25] church in the book of Hebrews. Cast not
[1:20:28] away your confidence. Amen. which had a
[1:20:32] great reward. So there's a reward for
[1:20:34] just being confident. And then he goes
[1:20:37] on because you have need a patience.
[1:20:38] He's connecting it after you have done
[1:20:41] the will of God that you might receive
[1:20:44] the promise. In other words, have
[1:20:46] confidence.
[1:20:48] If you do the will of God and be patient
[1:20:50] because the promise is going to be
[1:20:52] fulfilled. Don't be discouraged. Don't
[1:20:55] don't give up. Don't backslide. Just
[1:20:58] keep confident because the promise has
[1:21:01] got to happen because God made the
[1:21:03] promise and you have been faithful for
[1:21:06] all these years. So don't cast your
[1:21:09] confidence.
[1:21:11] You may be seated. I'm going to teach a
[1:21:14] little bit then we going to
[1:21:15] preach. Paul is attributed with writing
[1:21:19] 14 books in the New Testament. Romans, 1
[1:21:22] Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians,
[1:21:25] Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1
[1:21:28] Thessalonians, 2
[1:21:30] Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy,
[1:21:32] Titus, Filimon, and
[1:21:35] Hebrews. When you read the letters that
[1:21:38] Paul wrote to the Romans now, we know
[1:21:40] Paul's ministry was a transition because
[1:21:43] he was a Jew and his ministry was to the
[1:21:46] Gentiles. But as he is building in his
[1:21:49] ministry, he's writing Romans. He's
[1:21:52] writing to the both Jews and the
[1:21:53] Gentiles among the Romans. Then he
[1:21:56] speaks to the Corinthians in Corinth. So
[1:21:58] he is now not dealing with those in Rome
[1:22:00] and the heritage of Rome. But he speaks
[1:22:02] to the Corinthians. Then he speaks to
[1:22:04] the Galatians. He speaks to the
[1:22:06] Ephesians. He he speaks to the
[1:22:08] Philippians. He speaks to the
[1:22:10] Colossians. He speaks to the
[1:22:11] Thessalonians. There all gentile
[1:22:13] nations. And then there are the pastoral
[1:22:16] letters. letters written not to churches
[1:22:17] but written to individuals. So he writes
[1:22:19] to Timothy as you study show yourself
[1:22:22] approved. He he speaks in a pastoral
[1:22:25] ministry edifying individuals to Timothy
[1:22:27] to Titus to Filimon. But then there's
[1:22:30] the book of
[1:22:30] Hebrews which is written differently
[1:22:33] from every other book that Paul wrote.
[1:22:35] Amen. In fact biblical scholars argue if
[1:22:38] Paul even wrote the book because there's
[1:22:40] such an anointing with how it's written.
[1:22:42] They see who could have written such a
[1:22:44] book. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. The whole of Hebrews is a
[1:22:48] book of exhortation. Hebrews 11. By
[1:22:50] faith. Amen.
[1:22:53] By faith, Noah. By faith, David. By
[1:22:55] faith. But just before Hebrews 11,
[1:22:58] there's Hebrews 10 where God is saying,
[1:23:00] "Cast not away your confidence."
[1:23:04] What is interesting about this book,
[1:23:06] he's not speaking to Gentiles. He's
[1:23:08] speaking to believers. Amen.
[1:23:12] So he's speaking to people by the
[1:23:14] kangali who born and grow up in this
[1:23:16] thing.
[1:23:20] People who know the thing. They know the
[1:23:22] thing. They know about this history.
[1:23:24] They know about Genesis and they know
[1:23:26] about Moses. These are Hebrews.
[1:23:33] So he's speaking to people cuz when he
[1:23:35] says about drawing back, he's not
[1:23:36] speaking to new believers. That's right.
[1:23:39] He's speaking of people who have been in
[1:23:40] the faith because for you to draw back
[1:23:43] you had to be somewhere to go back. If
[1:23:45] you in the world you can't backslide in
[1:23:47] the world where what you backslid and
[1:23:48] domen.
[1:23:51] It's only after you went forward you
[1:23:53] could backslide. So he's speaking to
[1:23:56] believers and say don't draw back. Hold
[1:23:58] your ground.
[1:24:00] You're not healed yet but hold your
[1:24:02] ground.
[1:24:04] You don't have the Holy Ghost yet but
[1:24:05] hold your ground.
[1:24:07] The winds might be blowing, but hold
[1:24:09] your ground. Lock your knees. Hold it to
[1:24:12] the ground. Let the storm blow. Let the
[1:24:15] wind blow. But whatever you do, don't
[1:24:17] draw
[1:24:19] back. Don't cast away your
[1:24:23] confidence. Paul said in Philippians,
[1:24:26] "Being confident that he who started the
[1:24:28] work in you is able
[1:24:32] to Somebody help me preach in the house.
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:43] So Paul is exulting the church. It's a
[1:24:46] specific category of believer because
[1:24:49] there's something happens when you in
[1:24:50] church a long time.
[1:24:55] Lord, I've been holding on for 10 years
[1:24:57] and I'm still not healed. Lord, don't
[1:25:01] cast away your confidence.
[1:25:03] Lord, I've been coming for 15 years and
[1:25:05] Lord, I I'm still looking for that
[1:25:07] touch. That's that's who he's preaching
[1:25:09] to. But don't cast away your confidence.
[1:25:12] 40 years in the message, but don't cast
[1:25:14] away your confidence. Don't draw back.
[1:25:17] You have need of patience because the
[1:25:19] promise is about to be
[1:25:21] [Applause]
[1:25:25] manifested. In other words, Paul is
[1:25:28] preaching, he's in the spirit and he's
[1:25:30] speaking in veiled terms. He's saying,
[1:25:32] "Listen, hold on." If he was speaking in
[1:25:34] today's sermon, he would say, "It ain't
[1:25:36] over till it's over. Don't give up. We
[1:25:39] come too far to turn back now. Don't
[1:25:43] cast away your confidence." And you know
[1:25:45] what I love about this? Can I preach a
[1:25:47] little bit?
[1:25:49] He said, "Don't cast." And he places the
[1:25:51] power of casting in your hands.
[1:25:56] In other words, God is never going to
[1:25:58] take your confidence away. And the devil
[1:26:01] cannot take your confidence away. All
[1:26:03] the devil could do is tell you, "But
[1:26:05] look what you do for God." And nothing
[1:26:07] happened. Like what he did with the
[1:26:08] prophet. He said, "But you pray for
[1:26:10] people and look at your own child. You
[1:26:13] ministered and look at your own family
[1:26:16] trying to nip away at his confidence."
[1:26:19] That's what he tried to do with Job. He
[1:26:21] said, "Job, look at your condition." And
[1:26:23] Job, he held on to his confidence. His
[1:26:27] confidence was not in himself. He said,
[1:26:29] "Though he slay me, yet
[1:26:32] still though the skin worms destroy my
[1:26:35] body, yet in my flesh, I have confidence
[1:26:39] that I'm going to see God. It might be
[1:26:42] in the resurrection, but I'm going to
[1:26:44] see
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:46] God. Somebody help me this morning.
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:55] Pass not away your confidence.
[1:27:00] Don't draw back. Paul said, "We are not
[1:27:02] a them that draw back." You know how
[1:27:04] many people were in the message and
[1:27:05] they're not here. They draw back. Yes.
[1:27:08] Yes. Yes.
[1:27:11] Amen. Situations come and brother
[1:27:13] Brandham said, "God sends situations
[1:27:15] into the church."
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:21] Amen. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:25] God sends them to shake to see if you're
[1:27:30] grounded because God is in the character
[1:27:33] formation business. If God had a
[1:27:35] company, his company would call
[1:27:37] character formation limited. Amen. Or
[1:27:39] rather character formation unlimited
[1:27:42] because there's no limit with God.
[1:27:43] Character formation. He's in the
[1:27:45] character formation business.
[1:27:50] He said, "Cast
[1:27:52] not away your confidence.
[1:27:56] Don't let anything discourage you. Don't
[1:27:59] keep your head down."
[1:28:02] You might be waiting for healing, but
[1:28:04] don't cast away your confidence. Look
[1:28:06] up. Be patient. Said, "You have need of
[1:28:09] patience." Because God has approved
[1:28:11] something.
[1:28:13] You are waiting, but God is waiting. And
[1:28:14] the devil is watching and God is talking
[1:28:17] about you.
[1:28:19] So be patient because I'm proving
[1:28:21] something to the devil that you can wait
[1:28:25] until you can wait until your change
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:34] comes. Turn to your brother and sister
[1:28:36] and shake your hand and tell them, "Cast
[1:28:38] not away your confidence.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:03] Paul slipped this in there and I love
[1:29:05] what brother Waldron said two weeks ago.
[1:29:06] He said, "Listen, it's a open book."
[1:29:09] Open book. Seven sea go anywhere. Old
[1:29:11] Testament, New Testament, preach
[1:29:13] anything. This is a hidden mystery in
[1:29:14] there. Written to the believers. So when
[1:29:18] the devil says, "Look at your son. He
[1:29:19] not in church."
[1:29:22] I'm confident.
[1:29:24] I'm not going to cast my confidence
[1:29:25] away. I'm going to be patient because
[1:29:28] the promise has got to come to pass.
[1:29:31] Come hell or high water, my son is going
[1:29:34] to come back. My daughter is going to
[1:29:36] come back. Sister Christine and I has
[1:29:38] got to open up the female conditions in
[1:29:42] this church going to be dissolved. All
[1:29:45] the arthritis, diabetes, high low blood
[1:29:52] pressure. You can look the situation in
[1:29:55] the face and hold on to your confidence.
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] Hallelujah. Give the Lord a shout of
[1:30:05] praise.
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:10] You may be seated. This message is real.
[1:30:14] This message is right. This me is a
[1:30:16] truth. And Paul,
[1:30:19] Amen. was looking and I know he they all
[1:30:22] connected, you know, because Paul taking
[1:30:24] orders. That's right. From Jerusalem.
[1:30:30] No, Paul wasn't taking any orders from
[1:30:32] Jerusalem. That's right. Paul was
[1:30:35] busting Jerusalem. He was busting
[1:30:37] Ephesians, Corinthians because Paul
[1:30:40] wanted to hear from one source.
[1:30:43] Paul had a vertical relationship. If he
[1:30:46] didn't hear from God, he has seen
[1:30:47] nothing.
[1:30:49] They heard from God or they kept still.
[1:30:52] No small talk. Paul is not creating
[1:30:54] stuff. He is looking through the
[1:30:56] banister of time with eagle eyes from
[1:30:58] his father seeing the church going
[1:31:00] through transition, you know. Remember
[1:31:02] the Brandon when he was here, he thought
[1:31:04] he was going to make the rapture.
[1:31:08] And those who were in Brham tabernacle
[1:31:10] thought they were going to make the
[1:31:10] rapture too. And as God unfolded time,
[1:31:14] Paul was saying, you have need of
[1:31:16] patience because the promise is going to
[1:31:18] come to pass. But God has some
[1:31:21] scriptures to fulfill. He going to place
[1:31:23] a time of lingering. And the only way to
[1:31:26] go through a time of lingering is by
[1:31:29] patience. Hallelujah. Waiting on God and
[1:31:33] waiting for God. So he always places
[1:31:36] this stamp of lingering because he
[1:31:38] doesn't want it to be your strength,
[1:31:41] your might, your ability, not even your
[1:31:44] prayers. It's all about his timing.
[1:31:49] That's why brother Brandham said if God
[1:31:51] is ever to do something, it wouldn't be
[1:31:53] your pray. It will be the grace of
[1:31:55] almighty God. That's why the headstone
[1:31:58] will come with shoutings crying grace,
[1:32:01] grace, grace, grace. Because if it
[1:32:04] wasn't for the grace of almighty God,
[1:32:07] I'd be drunk somewhere. I'd be lost
[1:32:09] somewhere. But his grace is
[1:32:13] sufficient.
[1:32:19] Sufficient.
[1:32:21] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Are you
[1:32:23] enjoying the presence of the Lord this
[1:32:25] morning? So don't cast away your
[1:32:29] confidence. Be confident that he who
[1:32:32] started the work in you is able to bring
[1:32:35] it to pass. He promised to supply all
[1:32:40] all of your needs.
[1:32:43] So you don't think God knows what your
[1:32:46] needs are? He knows your needs. So if
[1:32:49] God promised to supply you all your
[1:32:51] needs, just be patient and don't cast
[1:32:54] away your confidence. And what does
[1:32:56] casting away your confidence mean? It's
[1:32:58] the same thing with over red. The
[1:33:00] children of Israel really and truly
[1:33:05] they're really troubling her. Yes.
[1:33:08] Imagine for 400 years you're locked up.
[1:33:11] You can't help yourself. You can't take
[1:33:14] yourself out. God sent Moses based on a
[1:33:17] promise. Yes. He just sent Moses. Moses
[1:33:20] came as a fulfillment of a promise that
[1:33:22] God gave to Abraham.
[1:33:25] So Moses just happened to come. It was
[1:33:27] God fulfilling his word.
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:31] And God comes and delivers them. The
[1:33:34] plagues, no other kingdom could have
[1:33:36] beat Egypt. That's right. God wrecked
[1:33:39] the whole system. Swallowed them up when
[1:33:42] he opened the Red Sea. Swallowed up
[1:33:44] Egypt.
[1:33:47] And Moses going to get the word of God.
[1:33:49] And the children of Israel, they're
[1:33:51] feeling
[1:33:52] antsy. They can't wait for Moses to come
[1:33:55] back down. So they cast their confidence
[1:33:58] away. And they say, "You know what? We
[1:34:01] need our own God." Hallelujah. Religious
[1:34:04] spirits, you know, build their own gods
[1:34:07] in the message. Put on men what only God
[1:34:10] wants. Put on ceremony only what God
[1:34:14] wants. put in tradition only what God
[1:34:16] wants. When God only wants to be the
[1:34:19] object of worship and he wants the
[1:34:21] praise, he wants the honor, he wants the
[1:34:23] glory.
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:27] Amen. But as if they should have learned
[1:34:29] their lesson,
[1:34:31] they come down to Kadesh Bara. Amen.
[1:34:35] Amen. And after they saw God deliver
[1:34:38] them from Egypt, deliver them through
[1:34:40] the Red Sea. Have grace even with his
[1:34:42] golden calf.
[1:34:44] Foolishness, they come to Kesh Bania and
[1:34:47] they send the spies and 10 men come with
[1:34:50] a testimony. We need to cast down all
[1:34:53] confidence.
[1:34:55] Because we cannot take this land.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah. These giants, these
[1:35:00] situations, these problems, we don't
[1:35:02] have what it take in our own eyes. That
[1:35:04] is real self-esteem in Israel real
[1:35:06] self-confidence. In our own eyes, we
[1:35:08] look in the mirror, we look like
[1:35:10] grasshoppers. Yes.
[1:35:14] And Caleb and Joshua, we know they came
[1:35:19] late because they had not had grapes
[1:35:21] before. They had not had milk before.
[1:35:23] They had not had the honey before. Them
[1:35:26] fellas come, they close so in honey,
[1:35:28] soak in milk. There was no bib. They
[1:35:31] didn't invent the bib yet. fellow was
[1:35:32] pouring milk and honey and praise God
[1:35:35] come back to see no but everybody crying
[1:35:37] even the elders crying the ministers
[1:35:39] crying the deacons crying everybody
[1:35:41] crying hallelujah why are they crying we
[1:35:44] don't have it we can't take it amen and
[1:35:47] said let us cope at once once we are
[1:35:50] more than able
[1:35:54] don't let a little trial hallelujah take
[1:35:58] away your confidence
[1:36:00] let a little situation
[1:36:02] get you to put understand this in the
[1:36:05] amplified it said don't fling away your
[1:36:07] confidence. In other words, whatever you
[1:36:09] do, hold on to it. Even if you're
[1:36:10] scared, hold on to it.
[1:36:13] You're feeling weak, just hold on. You
[1:36:14] might lose everything, but not your
[1:36:16] confidence
[1:36:17] because your confidence has a reward.
[1:36:20] Your child might walk on you, but don't
[1:36:22] hold on to it because your confidence is
[1:36:23] what's going to bring them back.
[1:36:26] Whatever you do, don't cast away your
[1:36:28] confidence.
[1:36:31] that he who started the work in you is
[1:36:35] able to complete it.
[1:36:38] Daniel was confident. David was
[1:36:41] confident. Moses was confident. His
[1:36:43] confidence was based on his experience
[1:36:47] with God.
[1:36:49] And if you ever get a genuine experience
[1:36:52] with God, then nothing will move you.
[1:36:56] Moses had a testimony. What is your
[1:36:59] testimony?
[1:37:01] What is your testimony? Enoch had a
[1:37:03] testimony. What is your testimony? Paul
[1:37:07] had a testimony. What is your testimony?
[1:37:11] Brother Brandham had a testimony. What
[1:37:13] is your testimony? You must have a
[1:37:16] testimony. You will have a testimony.
[1:37:19] You have not believed in vain. The devil
[1:37:22] wants to destroy your confidence. The
[1:37:24] devil cannot take it away. But if you
[1:37:26] throw in the towel, if you give up, if
[1:37:28] you cast away your confidence, the devil
[1:37:30] knows that you are finished. But as Paul
[1:37:33] said, I'm going to nail it down being
[1:37:35] confident of this very thing that he
[1:37:38] which had begun a good work in you will
[1:37:40] perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:37:43] Christ. Can the church say amen?
[1:37:49] Hallelujah. Don't cast away your
[1:37:52] confidence. You are going to receive the
[1:37:54] Holy Ghost. Don't cast away your
[1:37:57] confidence. You are going to be healed.
[1:38:00] Don't cast away your confidence. The
[1:38:03] Egyptians you see today, you will see
[1:38:05] them no more. Don't cast away your
[1:38:09] confidence. God promised to take care of
[1:38:11] you. Don't cast away your confidence. He
[1:38:14] will put food on your table. Don't cast
[1:38:17] away your confidence. He will open the
[1:38:19] word to you. Don't cast away your
[1:38:22] confidence. He is able to give you a
[1:38:24] wife. Don't cast away your confidence.
[1:38:27] He's able to restore your marriage.
[1:38:29] Don't cast away your confidence. He's
[1:38:32] able to restore your wife, your husband,
[1:38:35] give you a wife, give you a husband,
[1:38:37] give you a job. Don't cast away your
[1:38:40] confidence. It's only a test. Be
[1:38:43] patient. It's going to come to pass. The
[1:38:46] word that was spoken has got to come to
[1:38:48] pass. Don't cast away your confidence
[1:38:51] because no weapon formed against you can
[1:38:54] prosper. Cast not away your confidence
[1:38:58] because by and through the bride will be
[1:39:00] fulfilled all that was spoken. Don't
[1:39:04] cast away your confidence.
[1:39:08] You may be
[1:39:12] seated. Hallelujah.
[1:39:14] All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:39:17] All that Christ was, he poured into the
[1:39:19] church. Don't cast away your confidence.
[1:39:23] Hallelujah. I've said it so many times.
[1:39:25] America banned praying in schools.
[1:39:29] But when 9/11 took place, they brought
[1:39:31] tele evangelists to CNN to pray for the
[1:39:34] nation.
[1:39:37] They removed their confidence in God as
[1:39:39] was established by the founding fathers
[1:39:41] and placed their confidence in the
[1:39:43] systems and the nuclear weapons and the
[1:39:46] technology and the systems of men that
[1:39:48] evolved from Cain's children.
[1:39:53] In the absence of confidence in God, we
[1:39:56] place confidence in our doctors
[1:39:59] and our lawyers. And it's only when the
[1:40:02] situation is bad, we come back to church
[1:40:04] when the doctors don't know what to do.
[1:40:05] So, you want to come to pray when you're
[1:40:07] supposed to come to pray first
[1:40:10] because your confidence should only be
[1:40:12] in God. You don't hear me this morning.
[1:40:14] We place our confidence in our parents.
[1:40:16] We place our confidence in our relatives
[1:40:19] and in our neighbors. When God says, "I
[1:40:21] am the God that created you. I am the
[1:40:24] earth is the heaven is my throne and the
[1:40:26] earth is my foottool."
[1:40:29] Hallelujah.
[1:40:31] Cast not away your confidence because in
[1:40:34] the church of the living God lays the
[1:40:36] power to cast out demons. There are
[1:40:38] people in here this morning with all
[1:40:40] kind of unclean spirits in their souls.
[1:40:42] But there's power this morning to cast
[1:40:44] it out. You don't have to go back home
[1:40:46] with that demon of lust, that demon of
[1:40:48] pornography, that demon of drinking, of
[1:40:51] smoking, of whatever it is. Don't cast
[1:40:54] away your confidence. God didn't bring
[1:40:57] you out of the world to abandon you, to
[1:40:59] lose you after all these years you've
[1:41:02] been holding on. You know God already
[1:41:04] touched you. You know he delivered you.
[1:41:07] You know he opened the word and now the
[1:41:09] devil trying to wrap up your mind for
[1:41:10] you to give up. But he said stand
[1:41:13] therefore having done all to stand. He
[1:41:15] exalted them. Stand with put on the
[1:41:18] whole armor of God having done all to
[1:41:21] stand. Stand and don't cast away your
[1:41:25] confidence.
[1:41:27] In the church of the living God lays the
[1:41:30] power to heal the sick. Don't cast away
[1:41:33] your confidence.
[1:41:35] So many people have accepted their
[1:41:37] sickness as if it's part of their
[1:41:39] condition.
[1:41:41] It's just something I have to live with.
[1:41:44] Yeah. Don't cast away your confidence.
[1:41:48] That sickness has already been served
[1:41:49] notice. When Jesus died, that sickness
[1:41:52] was finished. And we plead the blood
[1:41:55] this morning over every person here
[1:41:58] battling any condition. We speak a word
[1:42:01] to those who are not here. Sister Janice
[1:42:04] Traer, Sister Antoine, we speak a word
[1:42:07] right now, right where they
[1:42:10] are. Every condition, every sickness we
[1:42:14] serve notice
[1:42:17] today. We are confident. We are
[1:42:20] convinced. We are fully persuaded that
[1:42:22] he is the same yesterday, the same
[1:42:25] today, the same forever.
[1:42:37] Hallelujah. But let's go a little
[1:42:39] deeper. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Let's
[1:42:43] praise God.
[1:42:45] Let's go a little deeper.
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:51] Cast not therefore your confidence,
[1:42:53] which hath great recompense of reward.
[1:42:57] For ye have need of patience, that
[1:42:59] after, now this is the fine print.
[1:43:04] This is the where the pedal hits the
[1:43:07] metal. Amen. Amen. And this is why many
[1:43:10] of us cannot get the results that we are
[1:43:13] looking for.
[1:43:15] If you are in school and you have an
[1:43:18] exam, if you do not study, you will not
[1:43:21] do well in the exam. Amen. Unless you
[1:43:24] have photographic memory, unless you
[1:43:27] were born with some genetically enhanced
[1:43:31] understanding of mathematics or biology
[1:43:33] or chemistry, you have to learn from
[1:43:35] somewhere. If you do not put the effort
[1:43:38] and the time and the dedication in the
[1:43:40] material when you do reach the point
[1:43:42] when you pray, you can't pray for God to
[1:43:45] bring anything back to your memory
[1:43:47] because you place
[1:43:48] nothing in your memory. Yes.
[1:43:54] So the Bible says, "For ye have need of
[1:43:56] patience after ye have done the will of
[1:44:00] God." Amen. And that's the problem with
[1:44:04] many of us in the message. Amen. We have
[1:44:06] failed to do the will of God. Amen.
[1:44:11] Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my
[1:44:14] commandments." He called David a man
[1:44:16] after my own heart because he will
[1:44:19] fulfill all of my will. Jesus himself
[1:44:23] had to come to terms with father not my
[1:44:26] will but thine be done. And there is the
[1:44:30] crossroad for every believer who follow
[1:44:33] the message of Malachi 4. Their battle
[1:44:36] or the battle rather of their will with
[1:44:39] the will of God
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:42] because God is looking to see his will
[1:44:44] because his will is the same way but the
[1:44:46] brother said full obedience to the
[1:44:49] entire word of God.
[1:44:51] entitles you to the token. So if we are
[1:44:54] saying that you have to have the token
[1:44:56] to go and brother Brandham taught us
[1:44:59] full obedience. This is not 90%. This is
[1:45:03] not 20%. This is not a buffet and I like
[1:45:05] rice and I don't like spaghetti and I
[1:45:07] don't like macaroni and I just want
[1:45:09] this. This is full obedience to all of
[1:45:12] the word now makes me a candidate for
[1:45:15] the Holy Ghost to dwell inside of me.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah. So, I'm here to warn the
[1:45:23] church. Amen. This is a real kind of
[1:45:26] mixed up service, huh?
[1:45:29] Be confident. Be sure warning.
[1:45:36] That's what brother Random taught us.
[1:45:37] Let the sword go in and then come out
[1:45:38] gentlemen. Amen. But we trying to get to
[1:45:41] somewhere that we because it's it's just
[1:45:44] in Hebrew. Let me read it for you. I
[1:45:46] like to go back to the Bible.
[1:45:48] Hallelujah. In this same
[1:45:50] Hebrews, this this is this is my context
[1:45:52] scripture for what I'm doing right now.
[1:45:54] In this same Hebrews 10, and let us
[1:45:56] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:45:58] love and to good works. Amen. I'm not
[1:46:00] trying to provoke you to the wrong
[1:46:02] thing. It's to love unto good works. Not
[1:46:05] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:46:07] together,
[1:46:09] as the manner of some is, but exalting
[1:46:11] one another and so much the more as you
[1:46:15] see the day approaching. Amen. In other
[1:46:17] words, as the day is coming, we need
[1:46:19] more encouragement because the devil is
[1:46:21] just trying to throw your confidence
[1:46:22] away. He wants to make you work more,
[1:46:25] work over time, do this, do that to
[1:46:27] distract you. And you know what? The
[1:46:28] rapture going to go and you're going to
[1:46:29] be clocking your car to hell
[1:46:34] because you have abandoned the will of
[1:46:36] God. I have said to the young people
[1:46:38] many times, not every job is for you.
[1:46:40] You got to know if you're in the bride.
[1:46:42] You got to have a revelation.
[1:46:46] You got to put God first. Seek ye first
[1:46:48] the kingdom of God. It's not a system.
[1:46:51] It's not a religion. You want to be a
[1:46:53] Pentecostal, go to the Pentecostal
[1:46:54] church. You want to go to the rapture,
[1:46:56] then there are certain things you must
[1:46:58] do. You cannot perfect yourself in your
[1:47:00] house.
[1:47:03] Why would we need pastors? Why would we
[1:47:05] need a church?
[1:47:10] You have to have a burden because all of
[1:47:12] the scripture must be fulfilled. Amen.
[1:47:15] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And this is why
[1:47:19] my wife and Ian Paul says this is the
[1:47:21] not this church part.
[1:47:25] Amen. The will of God means you live
[1:47:27] right. Amen. You dress right, you speak
[1:47:31] right, you have a testimony. People must
[1:47:33] look at you and know you are a
[1:47:35] Christian. They must not wonder, I
[1:47:37] wonder if No, your testimony must speak.
[1:47:41] They had to take note that they were
[1:47:44] with Jesus. They were written epistles.
[1:47:53] Your skirt halfway between long and
[1:47:55] short. You're not sure. It might be not
[1:47:56] short. Maybe if you lean so you're not
[1:47:58] sure. You lean so you
[1:48:08] Brandham said if you want the Holy Ghost
[1:48:11] What did he say to do? Spend time with
[1:48:13] people who have the Holy Ghost. Who are
[1:48:16] your friends? Who do you spend time
[1:48:19] with? Who do you want to be like? You
[1:48:21] spending all your time talking about
[1:48:23] this, about that, about the other and
[1:48:25] abandoning the will of God.
[1:48:28] But I'm here to encourage you, cast not
[1:48:31] away your confidence. Because you
[1:48:33] couldn't even be here this morning
[1:48:35] unless God had confidence in you to call
[1:48:37] you, to predestinate you, to put your
[1:48:40] name in the lamb's book of life, and to
[1:48:43] create a provision for you. Amen. So
[1:48:46] that you can receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:47] Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] Hallelujah. You know what brother said?
[1:48:50] He said temptation is not wrong. You
[1:48:52] know, it's giving into temptation. He
[1:48:54] said the Holy Ghost when those women
[1:48:56] walk on the street supposed to make you
[1:48:57] turn your eyes. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:02] The temptation not going to go away, you
[1:49:03] know. But the Brandham was panicking in
[1:49:06] his day. I told the young people, he
[1:49:08] said he hung a cross in his car so that
[1:49:11] when he see the woman walk in the 1950s
[1:49:13] and the 60s, God help us, he would look
[1:49:15] at the cross. What about our day?
[1:49:21] I told young people the size of the
[1:49:23] cross you need could fill the whole
[1:49:27] car. Amen.
[1:49:32] Hallelujah. But that's the day we live
[1:49:34] in where hell is on the earth and the
[1:49:36] devil is not taking prisoners. He wants
[1:49:38] your soul. And that's what the scripture
[1:49:40] said. Don't draw back. You have come
[1:49:42] this far. What you talking about going
[1:49:44] into the world? What are you messing
[1:49:47] with that person with that drink, with
[1:49:48] that smoke, with that lifestyle? What
[1:49:50] are you doing?
[1:49:54] Amen. Amen. Amen. When you're supposed
[1:49:57] to be in the word, because I told
[1:49:58] somebody recently, you can't be in the
[1:50:00] word and then get in an argument with
[1:50:01] your neighbor.
[1:50:03] You can't be in the word and you end up
[1:50:04] cussing out your friend. You were just
[1:50:06] in the word. It's impossible because the
[1:50:08] word carries an anointing. When you're
[1:50:10] in the word, all of a sudden troubles
[1:50:12] come and the wind blow, hurricane
[1:50:13] happen, and you don't even know it
[1:50:14] happened because you are just locked up
[1:50:16] in eternity. Because you are creatures
[1:50:18] of eternity. You belong to the God
[1:50:20] class. This earth doesn't matter to you
[1:50:23] because heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:50:25] But this word cannot pass away and you
[1:50:27] become the word as
[1:50:29] you as you receive the word and you
[1:50:32] can't wait to hear. You can't wait to be
[1:50:34] in church on Sunday. You can't wait for
[1:50:36] the midweek service. It It's food for
[1:50:39] your soul. This is better than KFC.
[1:50:41] Better than jobs. Better than
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:54] Wonderful. Have you done the will of
[1:50:58] God? Hallelujah. Have you been faithful
[1:51:00] to his word?
[1:51:02] Have you been praying? Have you been in
[1:51:05] the word? Have you separated yourself
[1:51:08] from the world? If you have done these
[1:51:10] things,
[1:51:12] then be patient because the promise is
[1:51:16] just ahead. I'm not going to be too much
[1:51:19] longer with you. But Isaiah 40, hast
[1:51:23] thou not known? Hast thou not heard that
[1:51:26] the everlasting God, the Lord, the
[1:51:28] creator of the ends of the earth,
[1:51:30] faintth not, neither is weary? There is
[1:51:33] no searching for his understanding. He
[1:51:35] giveth power to the faint, and to them
[1:51:38] that have no might, he increases
[1:51:40] strength. Even the youth shall faint and
[1:51:43] be weary, and the young men shall
[1:51:45] utterly fall. But they that wait upon
[1:51:48] the Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:51:50] They shall mount up with wings as
[1:51:52] eagles. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:51:55] They shall walk and not faint. Cast not
[1:51:58] away your confidence, but wait on the
[1:52:01] Lord, fully persuaded that he who
[1:52:04] started the work will be able to finish
[1:52:07] the work. Can the church say, "Amen."
[1:52:11] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] Hallelujah. David said, "Let none that
[1:52:17] wait on thee be ashamed." David said,
[1:52:20] "Lead me in thy truth and teach me, for
[1:52:22] thou art the God of my salvation. on
[1:52:25] thee do I wait all the day. He said,
[1:52:28] "Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage
[1:52:30] and he will strengthen thine heart.
[1:52:32] Wait, I see on the Lord. Our soul waitth
[1:52:35] for the Lord. He is our help and our
[1:52:38] shield. For evildoers shall be cut off,
[1:52:41] but those that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:52:44] inherit the earth. I waited patiently
[1:52:47] for the Lord and he inclined unto me and
[1:52:50] heard my cry." This morning I say they
[1:52:53] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:52:55] their strength. You have not been
[1:52:57] waiting in vain. You have not been
[1:52:59] holding on in vain. God is going to pour
[1:53:02] out the Holy Ghost. He's going to fill
[1:53:04] you. He's going to seal you. He's going
[1:53:06] to deliver you. He's going to change
[1:53:08] you.
[1:53:11] Hallelujah. The musicians can get ready.
[1:53:15] They that wait upon the Lord, that's
[1:53:17] what this message is all about. Cast not
[1:53:20] away your confidence but wait until your
[1:53:22] change come. Wait patiently because the
[1:53:25] Holy Ghost uh he's moving fixing things
[1:53:27] around uh for the coming of the Lord.
[1:53:30] And the problem is too many of us we
[1:53:32] want to do our own thing. But God has
[1:53:34] always said wait until you be endured
[1:53:36] with power from on high. He said tar he
[1:53:39] has always been a God of waiting. He
[1:53:41] told Abraham and Sarah I will return
[1:53:43] unto you according to the time of life
[1:53:46] and you're going to have that son.
[1:53:48] Abraham didn't know how it was going to
[1:53:49] happen, but he had to wait. And he
[1:53:52] staggered not at the promise of God. Uh
[1:53:54] because he knew there was something
[1:53:55] about waiting. And we have been waiting,
[1:53:58] not in vain. But I believe any day and
[1:54:00] now we're going to see the manifestation
[1:54:03] of the prophecy. Noah had to wait.
[1:54:06] Joseph was in prison and he had to wait.
[1:54:09] He couldn't take himself out of prison,
[1:54:11] but he had to wait until his change
[1:54:13] comes.
[1:54:14] I'm saying we are going to wait and your
[1:54:17] change is going to come. Somebody say
[1:54:19] amen.
[1:54:23] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:54:27] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:54:32] Hallelujah. Wonderful. Glory. Glory.
[1:54:35] Wonderful. Wonderful. Amen.
[1:54:38] So if you are struggling today,
[1:54:40] Hallelujah. If you are hanging on today,
[1:54:43] even the youth shall faint and be wary,
[1:54:45] and the young men shall utterly fall.
[1:54:48] Man at his strongest is weak, but all
[1:54:50] God always wanted to find somebody who
[1:54:54] would depend on him, who would place
[1:54:56] confidence in him, who would wait on
[1:54:58] him. But they that wait upon the Lord
[1:55:01] shall renew their strength. Friends,
[1:55:04] without God, without Christ, without the
[1:55:06] Holy Ghost, you are going to fall. But
[1:55:09] if you seek the kingdom of God and wait
[1:55:12] on the Lord, uh, you are going to run
[1:55:14] and not be weary. You're going to run
[1:55:16] straight into the rapture. You're going
[1:55:18] to run straight into your portion. Can
[1:55:20] the church say, "Amen."
[1:55:23] Amen.
[1:55:25] Hallelujah.
[1:55:30] Getting ready to close out. Cast not
[1:55:33] away therefore your confidence which had
[1:55:36] great recompense of reward. For ye have
[1:55:39] need of patience, that after you have
[1:55:41] done the will of God, you might receive
[1:55:44] the promise.
[1:55:46] For yet a little while, and he that
[1:55:48] shall come will tarry. He that shall
[1:55:50] come rather will come and will not
[1:55:52] tarry.
[1:55:54] Now the just shall live by feet. But if
[1:55:57] any man draw back, listen carefully.
[1:56:00] Now the just shall live by fate. But if
[1:56:03] any man draw back, my soul shall have no
[1:56:07] pleasure in him. But we are not of them
[1:56:10] who draw back unto petition, but of them
[1:56:13] that believe to the saving of the soul.
[1:56:16] And we read in the amplified that
[1:56:17] drawback is because of fear. So I want
[1:56:20] to say this morning, you don't have to
[1:56:22] be afraid to worship. Hallelujah. You
[1:56:25] don't have to be afraid to stand up and
[1:56:27] be a real Christian. You don't have to
[1:56:29] be afraid to claim your inheritance. You
[1:56:32] don't have to be afraid to say, "I'm
[1:56:33] going to be adopted." You don't need to
[1:56:35] be afraid to say, "I'm going to be
[1:56:37] perfected." You don't need to be afraid
[1:56:39] to say no to that friend, to that family
[1:56:41] member who wants to take your soul to
[1:56:43] hell. You don't need to be afraid to
[1:56:46] testify
[1:56:47] about Jesus the same yesterday, today,
[1:56:50] and forever. And that God sent a prophet
[1:56:52] with a message of deliverance, a message
[1:56:55] of power to take us to the rapture. But
[1:56:58] before we go into the rapture, we must
[1:57:00] accomplish certain things. We must see
[1:57:02] the sick healed. We must see the
[1:57:04] cripples walk. We must see the
[1:57:06] backsiders restored.
[1:57:08] Amen. You must not be afraid to invite
[1:57:10] your family to church to tell them there
[1:57:13] is a God that's real. Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] Don't be afraid. Hallelujah. And most
[1:57:20] importantly, as that scripture said,
[1:57:22] don't draw back.
[1:57:24] Don't draw back. Amen.
[1:57:28] you draw back, you lose your
[1:57:31] soul. Brother said uh rather Paul said
[1:57:35] in that same scripture and a lot of
[1:57:37] times some of these scripture when you
[1:57:39] read it, it makes you really really
[1:57:41] grounded. Listen to Paul in that same
[1:57:44] Hebrews 10 verse 26.
[1:57:48] For if we sin
[1:57:50] willfully, after that we have received
[1:57:52] the knowledge of the truth, there
[1:57:55] remainth no more sacrifice for sins.
[1:58:02] Amen.
[1:58:06] In other words, it's a high
[1:58:08] calling because when you are
[1:58:10] illuminated, as he said in this
[1:58:12] scripture, you need to forget the old
[1:58:14] things. Yes, there's blood, but you
[1:58:16] can't willfully sin. You can't go and do
[1:58:19] what you want. You can't live anyhow
[1:58:20] because you have a different owner.
[1:58:23] You are under a different covenant.
[1:58:26] You're under a different promise. You
[1:58:28] have a different destination. This world
[1:58:30] is going to hell, but you are going to
[1:58:32] glory. Can the church say amen? So,
[1:58:34] don't draw back. Keep moving forward.
[1:58:37] Yes, you're going to have up days. Yes,
[1:58:39] you're going to have downs, but keep
[1:58:40] moving forward. Don't cast away
[1:58:44] your confidence.
[1:58:48] I spoken this a long time ago. We're
[1:58:50] talking about Lot's wife because she's a
[1:58:52] classic example of drawing back, of
[1:58:55] looking back, of turning back. And I
[1:58:58] said Lot's wife, I don't mention it on
[1:59:00] Thursday night. She heard the message.
[1:59:04] She responded to the message. She knew
[1:59:07] the message. It was impossible for her
[1:59:10] to have been around Abraham and not know
[1:59:12] about God.
[1:59:15] She knew about being in church. She knew
[1:59:18] about all of this. And when the call
[1:59:21] came, she responded. She listened to the
[1:59:23] warning.
[1:59:25] She started the journey to her
[1:59:28] redemption.
[1:59:30] But she draw back.
[1:59:33] She gave up her confidence.
[1:59:36] Friends, I'm compelled this morning to
[1:59:39] challenge everyone, young,
[1:59:43] old, make your calling and election
[1:59:46] show. Amen. If you have been not giving
[1:59:49] all that you're supposed to to the
[1:59:51] kingdom of God, straighten up this
[1:59:54] morning. Amen. just before the terrible
[1:59:57] plague strike. Revelation 22:10 says,
[2:00:00] "And he saith unto me, seal not the
[2:00:02] sayings of the prophecy of this book,
[2:00:05] for the time is at hand." He that is
[2:00:07] unjust, let him be unjust still. He that
[2:00:10] is filthy, let him be filthy still. He
[2:00:13] that is righteous, let him be righteous
[2:00:15] still. And he that is holy, let him be
[2:00:17] holy still. We are in 2016 and God still
[2:00:21] hates sin. Amen. And sin will still be
[2:00:24] judged. Amen.
[2:00:27] Amen. Amen. Brother said if God doesn't
[2:00:30] judge America soon, he'll have to
[2:00:32] resurrect Sodom and Gomorrah and
[2:00:36] apologize to them. Amen. Amen. Maybe
[2:00:40] there's somebody here this morning you
[2:00:41] could begin to play something softly.
[2:00:43] Hallelujah. And maybe you have
[2:00:46] been grasping at your
[2:00:49] confidence, thinking of letting go.
[2:00:52] Maybe you're here this morning and
[2:00:53] you're backsliding. Maybe you're here
[2:00:55] this morning and you just came to church
[2:00:57] because it's the first Sunday of the
[2:00:58] year and you wanted to be in the house
[2:01:00] of God, but you haven't been praying.
[2:01:02] You haven't been crying. You haven't
[2:01:03] been putting God first. You have found
[2:01:06] every other thing to be important, but
[2:01:09] the business of God and the business of
[2:01:11] your soul. I want to challenge you this
[2:01:14] morning to not leave this place until
[2:01:18] something stirs in the inner man. The
[2:01:22] door is open this morning.
[2:01:24] But the Brandham taught us that every
[2:01:26] age had a messenger. But the Pentecostal
[2:01:29] age, God slipped that open
[2:01:31] door, that Holy Ghost door, that Holy
[2:01:34] Ghost entry there that anybody could
[2:01:37] come in and have an encounter with the
[2:01:40] supernatural. Amen. That door is still
[2:01:43] open today. If you don't have the Holy
[2:01:46] Ghost, you get desperate and say, "Lord,
[2:01:49] I don't want to live this way anymore. I
[2:01:52] don't want to go to school tomorrow for
[2:01:53] those who go to school without an
[2:01:55] experience with a pillar of fire.
[2:01:58] Because outside of an experience with a
[2:02:00] pillar of fire, it's just death and
[2:02:02] destruction. Amen. In Noah's day, Noah
[2:02:05] preached, they didn't believe him, but
[2:02:06] when God shut the door and the clouds
[2:02:09] begin to come, they all wish they could
[2:02:12] get him, but it was too late. Lord,
[2:02:16] that's the same way it's going to be in
[2:02:18] our day.
[2:02:20] Noah's children didn't understand what
[2:02:22] all the fuss was about because God
[2:02:24] didn't speak to
[2:02:26] them. Noah had to make sure his children
[2:02:29] stayed in there because they were
[2:02:31] saying, "We're missing all the fun.
[2:02:32] We're missing all the parties. We're
[2:02:33] missing our friends are doing this and
[2:02:35] that." But when the rain began to fall,
[2:02:37] his children were so happy they were in
[2:02:39] the ark. Young brother, young sister,
[2:02:41] you may not understand everything that
[2:02:43] you hear preach to you, but thank God
[2:02:45] that you are in the ark of safety this
[2:02:47] morning. Christ is that ark of
[2:02:51] safety. When death and destruction hits
[2:02:54] the land, trust me, it's already here.
[2:02:58] The judgment is being held while the
[2:03:00] ceiling angel moves through the camp,
[2:03:02] looking for those who sigh and cry for
[2:03:05] the abomination in the city. Those who
[2:03:08] are trouble in their souls, saying,
[2:03:10] "Lord, you made a promise. You have been
[2:03:12] holding on. Now bring it to pass. We're
[2:03:14] not going to let you go until until you
[2:03:17] bless me. Those who sigh and cry for the
[2:03:20] abomination in their houses. Sigh and
[2:03:23] cry because the evil is everywhere. We
[2:03:26] complain about the murders and the
[2:03:28] robberies and the crime. That's not
[2:03:29] going to stop. It's going to get worse
[2:03:31] because but the Bible said all the love
[2:03:32] will be only in the bride.
[2:03:35] There's still love on the earth, but one
[2:03:37] day it's going to be only in the bride.
[2:03:39] And then when the bride leaves, all of
[2:03:41] the love will leave.
[2:03:44] You know what kind of place it's going
[2:03:46] to be when there's no more conviction in
[2:03:48] the heart? There's no more conscience
[2:03:50] telling you what's right and what's
[2:03:52] wrong. There's no love. There's no love
[2:03:53] anymore on the earth because the bride
[2:03:55] went to all the love. Where you going to
[2:03:56] hide? Where you going to run to? This is
[2:03:58] not to frighten you. This is not to
[2:04:00] scare you. But it's the reality of
[2:04:02] what's coming. It's already spoken. And
[2:04:04] we see the fulfillment of
[2:04:06] prophecy. Russia waiting. They are in
[2:04:09] their place. America is in its place.
[2:04:13] All of the world is in their place.
[2:04:15] Sodom and Gomorrah is already on the
[2:04:17] earth.
[2:04:19] What about you, young brother? What
[2:04:22] about you, young
[2:04:24] sister? You make your calling and
[2:04:26] election sure this morning. You take
[2:04:29] time this morning. Your school could
[2:04:32] wait. Your job could wait because God is
[2:04:34] Jehovah Gyra. He will provide for you.
[2:04:37] But your soul cannot wait on the Lord
[2:04:39] anymore. Your soul needs uh to hear from
[2:04:41] the Lord. Your family needs this. Your
[2:04:44] son needs this. Your daughter needs
[2:04:46] this. Your husband needs this. The world
[2:04:48] needs this.
[2:04:51] Brother Anthony, may the Lord bless you
[2:04:53] this morning. Let's stand to our feet.
[2:04:59] Maybe there's somebody you want to be
[2:05:00] prayed for. The altar is open this
[2:05:02] morning. But you don't have to leave the
[2:05:04] way you came. I don't care how old you
[2:05:06] are. I don't care what position you are.
[2:05:09] The altar is open this morning. If you
[2:05:11] want to be prayed for, you come right
[2:05:12] now. Don't you hesitate.
[2:05:16] Don't cast your confidence away. The
[2:05:19] Holy Ghost is here. The angel of the
[2:05:22] Lord is here moving from person to
[2:05:24] person, looking to put a mark, a ceiling
[2:05:27] mark upon those who sigh and cry,
[2:05:30] sighing and crying for the abomination.
[2:05:33] You don't belong to the world. You don't
[2:05:34] belong to the devil. You don't belong to
[2:05:36] the lust and the styles and the fashion.
[2:05:39] Oh, maybe your son or daughter is not
[2:05:41] here, but you want to come and stand at
[2:05:43] the altar for them. You could come to as
[2:05:45] a witness. Apply the blood to your
[2:05:47] house. Say, "Lord, I'm here for my son.
[2:05:48] I'm here for my daughter. I'm here for
[2:05:50] my husband. I'm here for my wife, but I
[2:05:52] don't want to go home. I don't want to
[2:05:53] go home. I don't want to leave this
[2:05:55] presence." When the angel of the Lord is
[2:05:58] here, he's still in the hearts, still in
[2:06:00] the hearts of the
[2:06:01] people to come back to God. Oh, you
[2:06:06] backslider. You better make things right
[2:06:08] now. You better come back to God now
[2:06:11] before you lose your
[2:06:14] soul. All over the building this
[2:06:17] morning. All over the building. The
[2:06:19] angel is here. The Holy Ghost is here
[2:06:21] fixing things around. He's here moving
[2:06:23] from person to person. The angel of the
[2:06:26] Lord is here. He He wants to fill you.
[2:06:28] He wants to break the chain. He wants to
[2:06:31] break that spirit. He wants to break the
[2:06:33] lust. He wants a house of hell give way
[2:06:35] to the name of Jesus this
[2:06:41] morning. Hallelujah.
[2:06:43] [Music]

[2:26:44] and minister the word of God. And as we
[2:26:47] set the church in order and things come
[2:26:49] right and line up, we would see more and
[2:26:51] more of the spirit having the
[2:26:53] preeminences. How we thank you for your

[2:26:58] word of encouragement to not to cast

[2:27:07] was revealed by your end time message
[2:27:10] and prophet Mia 4. And as your people go
[2:27:12] to their homes, those even connected to
[2:27:15] us, Lord, that your spirit will drop
[2:27:17] down and they'll worship you in their
[2:27:19] hearts and feel the anointing in their
[2:27:21] homes wherever it is played that you are
[2:27:23] worthy. Lord, we are worthy. It's not
[2:27:24] about us. It's all about you and your
[2:27:27] son's coming back into position. Grant
[2:27:29] travel your mercies. We pray in Jesus
[2:27:31] name we ask it.
