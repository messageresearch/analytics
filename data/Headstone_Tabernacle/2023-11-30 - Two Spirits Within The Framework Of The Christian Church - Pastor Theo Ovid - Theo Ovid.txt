on fire tonight father confir your would with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen amen we have one prayer request we'll take right after the service God bless you and thank you for being here tonight I have two portion of script I like to read Ephesians 41-13 and Matthew 24:4 script reading tonight Ephesians 4 and he gives some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the Perfection of the SA Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith out of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and Matthew 24:24 reads for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect let us pray again father we thank you for the word the written word and I pray you would comeing upon it Lord Lord I couldn't wait to get here is all whole day waiting to come to this Pulpit Lord as you open up the word in our way we have never seen before may it bring Clarity father may it be the vision be made plain tonight that is not a game is not a play thing father but it's a reality that is coming right before us granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may be seated oh oh blessed be the name of the Lord Praise His wonderful name thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God so since I'm under a great expectation tonight see what the Lord will do sir and the title I have for tonight's message is two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church title of it two Spirits within the free of the CH Christian Church all right so let's uh hit the ru tonight amen Hallelujah but when Moses when God told Moses take off your shoes Moses on Holy Ground I've heard the cries of my people I've remembered my promises I made to Abraham I'm going to send you down to deliver them now Moses know that voice was God how because it was scriptural listen listen close now anybody that passes and see a voice and if it is not a scriptural voice leave it alone there's a slight echo on the platform listen anybody that passes and and and and sees a voice if it's not a scriptural voice leave it alone if the Bible says so then believe it because it's a scriptural voice people seeing angels and so forth Joseph Smith seen one I different with Jose Smith because it was not scriptural now I don't say the man never saw an angel I'm not the disput the man's word there have been many angels but Paul said Galatians 1: 18 if a angel come down from heaven and preach any other gospel than which was preached unto you let him be a curse so man seeing light man seeing Angel Angel tell them this and tell them that now tell them bring the angel and come because they have a word to examine the Angel by Hallelujah it has to be a scriptural voice so all these brothers like Moses and William branam and all them they heard a voice voice but the voice was tied to the scriptures so that means you have to back up with a scriptural voice not not a message voice a scriptural voice because the message itself come from the scriptures oh give the Lord some Praises do you see that tonight do you catch it tonight now so watch this now so Satan used his ministers oh I didn't know that see the minister yes Matthew 24:24 false anointed one since the prophet left in 1965 false anointed and false teachers come among the bride with all kind of interpretations and ideas and inspiration to try to deceive the end time bride but the way I'm seeing that my totally my totally blown it's not churches you know it's not people saying I want to get infu it's Lucifer Lucifer trying to keep the bride away from her promises keep keep the bride from coming to Perfection keep the bride from having a Revival keep the pride from breaking out is Lucifer at work again oh glory to God hallelujah I hope you see the way I'm seeing it tonight now watch this God spoke to that prophet and say seven T give faith it wasn't the prophet saying that you know God spoke to him seven T will gather the right together seven T will show the out repair seven T will give the bright fith seven T will Bri Revival God said that not a man God said that oh glory to God hallelujah and that there'll be going to be a Unity of the faith and the devil fought that but we saying what God said Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so every false teacher false prophet false messenger was to sent to try to get us off the word the objective is to get you off the word but the bride will stay with the word glory to God hallelujah praise do you believe that tonight Glory I'm not talking about outside the message I'm talking about in the message two spirits in the framework of the Christian Church Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus now we see there are two churches each one have ministers the bride Ministry ministers come from Ephesians 4 11-13 and the bride herself come from second Peter 1 427 that's the scripture Hallelujah and the false Church their ministers come out of Matthew 2424 that is their Ministry 54 Ministry that come from the Matthew 2424 and their church members come from 2 Timothy 3 5-8 oh blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God I read the scripture a certain way I give Ephesians first which is the which is the fold Ministry and then I give Matthew 2424 because you have to have the original first and the counter feet follow after so tonight I want to present the bride to you from second Peter 427 whereby had given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of his divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world true lust and besides this giving all diligence your fith virtue am Anthony and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance and Temperance patience and patience godliness and to God his brotherly kindness Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise that's the bride oh give the Lord a shout glory to God that's the bride that's the elected that's is who going to Rapture Oh Glory to God no wonder he said this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's going to around Give the Lord a prayer I'm feel so good tonight I couldn't wait to get here my God I'm pregnant with this child Oh Glory to God this baby going to be delivered tonight Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh praise God now watch we are not really the bride until we come into charity Colossians 314 says and above these things above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness so charity have to seal the bride seal the body seal you then you are the bride so you have to connect with your mate your husband and that is Charity himself Oh Glory to God after you added all these seven things so this spirit is versus all the rest Oh Glory to God this is the plum Line This is God's voice on the earth this is God's body on the earth this is seven perfect Spirits Oh Glory to God that will be sweeping across the world from a bride Hallelujah all right let's go brother brand now if Jesus said two spirits in the last days would be so close till it would deceive the very elective possible religious people now remember there's ain't nothing out there what call formal outside they have a formal you see the two Spirits are real spirits and that struck me like never before it's not no game you know it's real spirits it'll be so close till it would dece very lck but it was working side by side in the last days right with me tonight my dear Christian friend demons are working on every hand and God's spirit is moving right out on the other hand to contact it every time so every time I have demonic activity it have Holy Ghost activity anytime the enemy come like a flood it have to have the spirit raise a standard anytime it have a false Spirit false prophet false anointed it have to have a true anointed true Spirit Holy Spirit could we give the Lord a SP a praise let's go you see what I mean about demons they are working they are very religious they go to church every Sunday I don't leave that for I I I let one soak a little bit I'll read it again they are very religious they go to church every Sunday they repeat Apostle Creed just as Rel can be brother brandham you mean that's the truth I'm still reading because there a hting to understand you know them demons are staying home you know they're dressing up and going to church in the [Applause] message are shaking that's the kind of spirit that hung Jesus to the cross and Jesus said you have the Father the devil some of them say Russia is the Antichrist never Russia is the Antichrist the Antichrist is going to be so religious it'll fool the very elect if possible remember this is deep God takes his men but never his Spirit the devil take his men but never his Spirit suit yourself I'm only responsible for truth yeah I'm pumping here demons working yesterday I had them in the Physical Realm today I'm showing you in the spiritual realm they are in the religious realm out yonder in the Physical Realm it's called cancer this that the other I prove to you by the Bible they are devils but over here today here they are again in the religious realm very religious very Pious now if you think Kain the very beginning was very religious Esau religious Judas religious it's religion it ain't the outside world it's right in the ranks right in the message what that demonology condemn no one love everybody if you can't love from your heart then Christ is not with you oh praise God let's continue now we have applied it to healing service cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis all those things are not natural things they are Supernatural and are demons the scripture plainly vindicates that that is demons in the body with growth like cancer got a life in it and the life of that is a demon growth of cataract spread of tubercolosis and other diseases is demons that's in physical form but this morning we're going to talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they are in the soul as same as they in the body we are bound to admit that we see people with cancer and different diseases in the human body and and recently even cancer had been declared to be a fourth dimensional disease that is another dimension that's demonology every disease is a fourth dimension disease the beginning of it so the beginning of it is spirit and then it gets a body and it get tumor and all kind of broken cells and form a p and form something inside of there but it start in the spirit realm are you with me now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul the demon can come in either place amen wow now there are many times people with good thoughts many good people who try many times to rest upon some theology they have they have been taught since a child and still find that D in their being down in their soul they have something that's not right many are here this morning no doubt you find Christians gathered together you find people who have those Spirits it's undesirable they don't want them they say oh if I going quit ly if I going to quit lusting if I going to quit this or that that's Devils now they come in the form of religion many times now in this okay I'm going to skip that okay if people could only realize that is why I come this morning okay I'll skip I'll come back now in the scripture there was a man named Jehoshaphat great man religious man he went out to another king which was king of Israel and he je being a king of Judah he went to Ahab king of Israel and they got buckled up together made an alliance one another to go and fight up at rahad Gilead but they did it without praying first amen and if people this statement get you if people can only realize that is why I come this morning and ask you to remember me as I go overseas in all things pray say after me in all things pray say it again in all things pray in all things to buy a car to buy a house to go here whatever it is what pray pray first pray for protection pray for guidance pray for them Devils to to miss past your straet oh give the Lord some Praises praise we in a battle Hallelujah every day you in a battle every day Warfare is declared Oh Glory to God hallelujah every single day I think Sunday message or talking or some other message say Satan is like he he has Noone right here on the earth like a disembodied Spirit looking for bodies he has no real house this is not his home this not his land he's a squatter he was kicked off the Earth and come down kicked out of and come down on the earth and know we looking for bodies to dwell in bodies looking for houses to dwell in and when they when they get when leave here and don't get the Holy Ghost Inside of there he come Seven Devils worse than himself and come back to take over the land again take over your country take over your property he he not orain to be there oh glory to God hell hell hell hell wasn't created for for the Saints hell was created for the devil and his angels Oh Glory but people get caught up in the hell spirit and devil spirit and they worship that Spirit Oh Glory to God remember the man who who came to challenge brother brandham and he say he'll fall over my feet and he came say you snake in the grass I will kill you and everything else and he came up to the platform and fall over bar feet and when the police came they asked somebody asked question was he delivered he said no he worshiped that Spirit praise God people have to get rid of the religious spirit in this message to get Deliverance they are not delivered they believe brother Bram that spoke book but they are religious is Devils religious spirit is Devils if you never hear from anybody here tonight religious spirit is devils is not the Holy Ghost not the Holy Ghost talking to you oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah that's why God said Jacob I love he wasn't religious he was a a Scamp he was a clook and he was for real what is your name I am Jacob I am the old Thief Oh Glory to God I did this I did that God like reality he like your confession Oh Glory to God he look like hypocrisy oh give the Lord a shout in the house praise the Lord hallelujah but he said pray someone come the day and say but do you think it's wrong to do a certain thing I said what are you questioning about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone should I go here should I go here have little party and me family invite me you think once you go there once you have a question leave it alone let your friends and family go to that once there's a question leave it alone then he said then you know you're right oh praise God when you start to do anything if it's a question whether it's right or wrong stay away from it don't go into it at all then you know you're right so everything ought to be considered prayerfully first then he made this statement seek first the kingdom of God his righteousness all these other things shall be added then he said this I am positive sure this morning I said tonight if men and women could only get into the position where their soul their thinking their attitudes would be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches ever existed therefore if a man or woman could ever get his thoughts and their testimony and their lives so line up so you have to want to think God thoughts you have to want his word you have to want to get in the atmosphere you have to want this thing to get line up with it we don't know God's mind and God's plan and purpose it's in his word we come to church to get line up with it we getting line up with something tonight God is bringing something to us tonight he said watch if if they get their thoughts and testimony in their life shall with the word until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up where they were where they with freedom from their hearts with the Faith from the innermost many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have int ual Faith they confess their sins and join a church by intellectual Faith he don't look at your intellectual Faith he looks on the heart where on the inside so you could understand when Jesus spoke to the woman of the well what he was looking at her heart you speak truthfully you had five the one you live is not yours that's honesty he was looking at her heart go and send no more woman you are loosed and set her free and everything else you understand that now the Pharisees and them and think them have corruption in their heart and they have white gong on the outside all right them showing him Mage on the outside no message at all all right so watch notice he said give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer a factory worker that will put God first in everything in everything in I will show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first so you don't have to worry what people doing or people saying about you you know who God blessed no man could curse you can't you can un bless a man oh give the Lord a praise offering when God pour the anointing oil upon David nobody got take the anointing off of him Oh Glory when God put the anointing upon me no man in Trinidad or out of Trinidad could take it off of me because God put it on me and I can say the spirit is upon me because he has anointed Me Oh Glory to God to bring a word in due season oh give the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah now watch here we go so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits they in the world they are demons they go out into places they get amongst men ministers I didn't say that you know I ain't trying to trting of ministers you know this is just the word this is the truth here you know they get among men ministers because they want to get the top dog they want to get the top man you want to get the CEO because you have influence to open up a channel in the church that more demons could come in oh G even no praise demon oh you get me started tonight oh glory to God do you understand that now the man himself have to have a no pra demon on him too you know and when he drop that on the church all them demons sit down on the people top lip they can't even say hallelujah Glory they can't stand up they can't shout they can't praise God they can't say like David I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord I'm excited every time I come to church Oh Glory to God why shouldn't I be praise God over 50 how much years pumping Oh Glory to God to get among men to get among ministers they get among church members they get among good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that are contrary to the word of God could we somebody say amen and do you know you are not right with God when you are still back backbiting and lying and doing everything you can't be right with God even Paul was preaching and he tell the church put away lying it had Liars inside the church Oh Glory to God inside there too you know oh we going cast that line out though either the L Spirit go or they go with the ly Spirit oh give the Lord a shout in the house the pastor in the house tonight oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God when you are still back biting and lying and doing everything you can't be right with God I don't care how many churches you belong to until your soul become converted brother that old fashion that will boil down and put soup in your soul oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah

shout in the house we talking about the Gent Gentile dispensation I Ain talking no Jews I ain't going there at all second Timothy is where the church members in this message is identified 2 Timothy 3:1 this know also the last is perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud Blasphemous disobedient of parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent F despises of those that are good so if you're despise Hallelujah say Glory despises are go as long as you are not despising anybody but the people despising you Hallelujah how the Bible here they supposed to do that because the bright spirit is the bright Spirit and the church spirit is the church spirit it's not the same thing the seed Hallelujah shall not be air with the shock oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory and the shock was a hidden Mystery Oh Glory to God the Bible talk about tears and wheat but under the wheat

testing and tribulation Oh Glory to God in your place are trying you will turn golden brown while the shock turn to straw Oh Glory to God without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despised are those that are good it finish here traitors heavy High minded lovers of pleasur more than lovers of God having a form of godliness in the message but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this s are they which creep into houses creep my goodness them is creepers and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins Leed away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of Truth now as Janice and jambers wited Moses so these resist the truth men of corrupt Minds repr probate considering the fith the Amplified verse 7 these weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them they are forever inquiring and getting information but are never able to arrive at a recognition and knowledge of the truth hallelujah as just as Janice and jambes were hostile to and resisted Moses so these men are also hostile to and oppose the truth they are depraved and distorted minds and are repr bait and a counter feat and to be rejected as far as the feat is concerned that's the church two Spirits going to be working in the framework of the Christian church but BR now the spirit says now listen I'm quoting from you from the scriptures the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the Fate giving heed to seducing Spirits doctrines of devils now look how would be he highminded Big Shots excuse but you know what we call the big shot Street expression we all know he High minded LS of pleasur so was quoting the scripture back right an intellectual he highminded lovers of pleasure and lovers of God I'm quoting scripture the Holy Spirit speaks expressly that this would take place at the end time he High minded well first incontinent desp of those that are right hater of those who believe the word now notice in these these times intellectual age he High minded lovers of pleasure one lover of God stay on Wednesday night to watch some we love Susie and and we love Lucy you rather stay and watch that than attend a prayer meeting lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God hey High minded in continent Fe having a form of godliness you said they are communist no they are not are you ready they are church members all of that from second Timothy they are church members having a form of godliness but what denying the power thereof having a form of God but say God doesn't do these things there's no power to it you just you just accept this and do this no change of life and just the other day before even studying this I was talking about people for years no change after 30 years no change no change of life no nothing just belong to church I I belong to this Tabernacle I to that Tabernacle you belong you already belong there why don't you belong to Christ having a form of godliness but denying the power there from such to away the Bible says I I skip that all right now what but B say now these Messengers and Witnesses you see we find out what crop we are in look what

signs and wonders we are in one of the crops we are the end time oh glory to God hallelujah you know I didn't give an inspiration the inspiration was try the spirits that was that was it that was the inspiration try the spirits hallelujah praise God 1 John 4 beloved believe not every spirit that that's a commission you know believe not every Spirit but try the spirits that's the inspiration try the spirits whether they of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world so we have no authority to believe anybody yes try the spirit you understand that somebody come testimony see a angel see a light and go tell them me you but come come bring it bring it and come and when you hear it you hear something scriptural you know well not the Lord tell them that some enticing Spirit tell them that are you with me now praise God Jude 3:4 beloved when I give all diligence and write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which which was once delivered to the Saints for there are certain men crept in Una awes they sneaking they wasn't really observing they they come in watch who were of all ordained to this condemnation on Godly men turning the grace of God into lishness and denying the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ all right we read this and we're going to say this is where I get the core title here from let me show you why Satan hat his book of Revelation he he know that God changes not he knows God is unchangeable in his nature immutable in his ways do Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claim as his own all else is false it has to be now remember Christ in the true church in the last day the true church and false church right Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts in which was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles was the acts of God among God's people oh glory to God Peter in prison and the church people praying and then Peter come out of prison because the gate open oh God in other words Holy Ghost working in prayer Holy Ghost working in the prison Holy Ghost working all over is another book of Acts oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God this is something inside of here we we tired read this but this is something tonight watch this now but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm evidence of defilement lukewarm evidence of defilement formal evidence of defilement powerless Hallelujah it exposes Satan and be he said now watch watch he he he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army that's one part if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God and I put down here the opposite is true without true revelation of du Spirit Satan in charge because the church will be power so in other words we are about to start a scriptural War Oh Glory to God you he that yet I know that a strike yet you know but we are about to start a war in Trinidad and around the world war going to be declared and a holy war going to start Oh Glory to God the bride and the church I not talking outside business I'm talking about the

hallelujah so every unscriptural song is an uncertain song everything that's not backing up like the scripture is uncertain we can't move with that if the trompet give an uncertain song who can prepare for the battle it has to be a scriptural voice it has to be a scriptural song it has to be from the word and that give us the authority to fight back Oh Glory to God the church will get the authority brother Kang the all the authority that Jesus had will be back in the church Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you can't live any how you want to live praise God we know a

God we will never be bong again after this message every spirit will be exposed oh give the Lord a shout the bride going to step forward in faith you wouldn't let no church member no church Spirit stop you from worshiping from praising from coming out and giving the Lord a shout and giving God glory you will never let anyone stop you from inheritance no mother no brother no husband no wife Oh Glory to God no man oh glory to God this revelation will give us power over every devil Oh Glory to God this revelation will give us power of every Spirit hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God all right let me see we can stress you know watch brother Bram and you now understand how we judged what the church was was like what she was at Pentecost and what she was in the Apostle age as set forth in the word in the book of Acts we can apply the same rule to show us how the church failed the basic error or errors that crept into the first church and will reveal in the book of Acts and Revelation also in the Epistles will become more and more visibly manifested in each subsequent age until we come to a complete blackout of the Lan age now we find out this first key that we have received of the Lord there comes another less slightly yet wonderful truth I said that the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts always that's exactly right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there's a complete blackout of Truth in the last days when the Lord is about to appear the question now Aris in our minds does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception on no account for the scriptures clearly stated in Matthew 24 that the elect cannot be deceived what then the answer is clear before us there is a true church and a false church so i a ping crazy thing tonight there's a true church and a false Church there is a True Vine and a false Vine but of course that false Vine body will try to usur the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic the false will try to kill the true it's never the true tried to kill the false and how does the false try to kill the True by trying to break your influence kill your effect yes amen it come like a a crazy housewi just all right affecting the husband to cancel his authority over the children to cancel the authority over his home because she fail because she make the baby you know I mean she running isue religious spirit you know she not going to subject and listen to what the husband telling her because she feels she's the boss I ain't come to go there tonight I just give an example example praise God watch I want to carry this thought all the way through Let's us step further have you ever studied the history of revivals now Revival signifies a move of God in power and people say Revival over Liars Li l tongue you cast over and move God in power if we have no power we finish you know we might as well drink and be merry because we going and perish we're going to die we just cancel everything and just get the V 19 get the liquor get you know I mean just go drink and make we we wasting time National Force put Israel in the Homeland he said the power of God would put the people in The Bride we need Revival we going to have none if every other Church in trado don't want it we going to have it I have nothing to do with what they they seen it so don't see it so I have nothing do what you seeing your i c i don't know what I'm praise God there's going to be a Revival a Revival boil that trash out the church no teaching doing that you know no Mysteries doing that you know a Revival take the trash all way can overcome and you getting stress and all that that will get you out you'll find yourself praying 1 Hour 2 hours 3 hours sisters can't wash your dishes because a Revival is on oh get the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah praise God praise God that could start tonight you know that could start right here you know that could start with you you know may you be the Revival Oh Glory to God a personal individual Revival you are the majority in God run every devil out your house Oh Glory everything contr out your life run it out oh glory to God Amen you may be seated Revival signify the move of God in power watch and every time God moves Satan is there to move also in the days of the great wealth Revival most people don't know this the insane asylums fill up quickly there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God it is written that in wesle day the people would do the most peculiar things that were definitely of Satan to try to mock the goodness and the power of God in Luther day it was said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the Catholic church but the miracle L of fact he could and stay sng and sing amidst the Fanatics who were often filled with guided by wrong Spirits that's in Luther's message and if you have been aware of the last day Ministry you'll notice the same invasion of false and wicked Spirits I hope and trust you that are spiritual minded enough get that and capitalize on it just to seal the point on the true and false Vine mingling and demonstrating the two spirits of work and brother brandham quote the scripture we read just now there 1 John 4 belove it believe not every Spirit but try the spirits to see whether of God because many false prophets have gone out in the world and so on hallelujah praise God listen to this part now then he talk about certain many he quot Judah and so on spots in your Feast it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds remember the parable Jesus give when you s seed the next man come and S some seeds and then when Harvest Time come time of harvest come they say shall we separate them he said no no no least get the false The Good Seed let them grow he said let them grow because who planed that let them grow in time of harvest we'll reap Angels come and reap and separate them Harvest Time Coming Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God all right are you ready brother BR this concluding chapter was given in order to trace the two churches and two Spirits from Pentecost to the country this age started just as a turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being bride she was at Pentecost watch these words we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the Believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying out to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest the gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the Lin prophecy now can only come after the former rain which is the spring or teaching reain the lattering den is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come who's the son of man Jesus is a son of man and what the son of man does he sow the seed so the prophecy Luke 17:30 that the son man will reveal again meant that seed was coming again to SW for a bride oh give the Lord a shout because rain coming to fall on seed so it doesn't make no sense looking at at rain and there's no seed here that's what he's saying here now all right now watch thiso thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come amen it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of the spiritual blessing and manifesta in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing to you it was also the devil power here we go as many were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it this is a scary thing you this is scary you know when people start to see what the pastor has been teaching and preaching has been off the word and they have off the for years and you know when you drift off a little bit after years what happen when you're supposed to be so you're going quite so you know but Jo REM say when you see a TCH off the word they can believe anything see some brothers take some worship in that country and one brother come and say we was we we was accepting the worship on behalf of Christ now I say is he right in his head he he crazy you read in the Bible when that angel start to worship joh don't do it don't do it worship God all worship God don't do that don't do that they well Hallelujah we receive it on behal of Christ but brah says it's written in the scriptures Thessalonians 5:21 prove all things hold fast to that which is good when anything is proven it will be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right then as you find what is right hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold it fast hold it tight now what is possible for staunch Christians fine people hold sometimes to the wrong thing thinking it is right and then these things should be proven right or wrong oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God do you love him I want to read this scripture here quickly home church here now um this is um acts 8 5-24 when Philip went to City of Samaria there was one Accord and he did miracles unclean spirits and people were healed and possession and the lame were heal and great joy in his City but there was a man in nam Simon which he we talk about him Bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one so let's call him for now Simon the great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God Simon Sor he has sorcery power andto him they had regard because he was a long time he had Beed them with sorceries but but then when when they believe Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believe also and he was baptized and he continu with philli so he in the message now he in church with Simon wondered Behold The Miracles and signs will come now here the part I want to get to Anthony listen to this one verse 14 when now when the apostles which were in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John now Philip was preaching people being heal people were delivered but holy ghost have fall yet do you get that signs one of the Miracles his gift is in operation but the Holy Ghost a pour out yet so watch they heard that Samaria received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they had come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost what Holy Ghost you talking about you one 24 hours and be lost can't be that one for yet verse 16 he was Fallen upon none of them there's not teaching brother Jo there's not Myster he who's he the Holy Ghost is a person you know he he he when he the Holy Ghost comes he had not I wonder if he a fall yet in this message how much people get it fall and George then what they doing sitting down praise God they have to be in the bride is have to fall on them oh give the Lord some Praises if you want to be in the bride this Holy Ghost have to fall on you oh glory to God thank you Jesus give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to if they fall on you yet have to fall on you watch for yet he has not he he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God not the explanation to receive the Holy Ghost and when Simon saw that through the lay on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost has given he offered them money CU he wanton that power too he wanton that influence too saying give me also this power that on whosoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost he don't have it you know but he want to give it by money by paying for it but Peter said un him thy money perish with thee because thou thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou Hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right with the sight of God repent therefore of this wickedness and pray God if he that perhaps the thought of th heart may be forgiven Thee I perceive that thou are in the G of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity and he's a brother in the church oh give the Lord some Praises all right let go when Jesus called the disciples what did he have to do get the very literate type men and women who were can't even sign their own name Peter and John they were ignorant and learn watch but if the intellectual wouldn't they wouldn't hear him they wouldn't hear him now they got their own course they're on their own Road they follow that road because they have been instructed that way because your pastors and their Bishops and Cardinal have directed them on that road here we go but the holy spirit will bring you back to Pentecost every time they did it in the scripture to everybody and it will do it this day to everybody it will bring you back to that reality it will bring you back to the baptism of power of the spirit that would lead you and never take one word off the Bible it will stay right in the Bible Oh Glory glory to God hallelujah they were ignorant fishermen and sheep herders didn't know how to write didn't know how to read or nothing but they had nothing to lose and he got to them and they surrendered and when they were completely surrendered and give themselves over to God God gave them a Pentecostal reality Oh Glory to God hallelujah he led them up to Pentecost and give them the Holy Ghost and the very first time Eve disbelieve one word from God it broke off fellowship with the great Union and the minute the church disbelieves any one word of God's Bible and places it somewhere they break off that wonderful Fellowship that was offered to them oh praise God and then brother R dropped this bomb he said no man no woman can believe the devil's lie until they disbelieve God's truth so before they get under the spirit of deception they have to reject truth coming to them everybody but a George with that Spirit of deception around them is because they denying some part of the word oh and that denying open my back door for the deceiving Spirit to come oh God a ling Spirit come and say let me go and anoint all of them praise God that the prophecy will come true oh give the Lord a shout brother Bram said this think seriously because we will never be able to think anymore after this after this Mortal life is over your thinking is now you cannot choose after this you must choose now for this is the day of choosing make your choice now one word not a whole decalogue one word she questioned God because it was presented to her in that light and that word was questionable God word cannot be questioned he meant just what he said and I want to Anchor that one word off and we lose our fellowship unto Deb Eternal separ from God just as Adam and Eve did we must believe God's truth hallelujah Satan tried to get in there and spy out and hold the human race and he showed he had to be Supernatural power to think of it so Satan no stupid man all right he used this the first time and was successful he done it ever since and still successful to a certain extent he used reason instead of fi Satan come to Eve and begin to reason with the word of God is only reasonable and God will not destroy you surely you will not die that's Satan tactic to begin with he still uses the same thing still successful with it reasoning and I try to reason that's why watch you try to reason why would we need the Holy Ghost today when the seed is in the soul but you someone jumping and shouting and praising God and he SE his soul and I know who I am you know what I mean because teaching position it places you who you are the kingdom of God Peter had SE his soul white Peter didn't say I ain't going to theupper room now because I se in his soul and Jesus pray th me before the fish of the world and I knew who I am I was a fisherman and and Messiah called me out and and the word open up to me I might understand to me and J said Don't Preach until you have endured not from the books Paul from on high not from the tape and reading plenty and studying no Paul from on high B said when the of Pentecost fully come them just afraid that you they were one man and one Accord and suddenly there came a song from Heaven no man make that song Nobody ring no Bell nobody B the pulpit there was a song from was a Russian Mighty wi and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and then they begin to Star like drunk men oh God that could happen tonight that could be something else you know I feel I could close off here tonight praise God song of a Russian Mighty Wind filled with the Holy Ghost set your soul on fire Oh Glory to God your home changed all together your life change all together the devil on the Run Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God and brother manam said we got to know our enemy isn't that right Hallelujah any enemy that reason any person any church any organization any individual that reasons Against One punctuation of God's word is your enemy Oh Glory to God it takes the word to defeat the enemy musici come please but praise God hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God oh glory to God so much thing we say there tonight Hallelujah I'm amazed hallel Oh Glory to God any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of God's word is your enemy but says when a church is grown in that the Holy Ghost is just as real as it fellon the Pentecost when they are born and positionally born how they grown how they cry but when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church not before Apostles teachers Prophet evangelist you have to be a positional birth let the ministers fight that you can fight that that they moving from the spok with books a positional birth when they are born and positionally born then God sets the Bible said he's set in the church not man get voted in not man is the biggest and the eldest and what not no man God sets and when God set no man can unset oh give the Lord a sh when God put a man in a place nobody could pull you out of that place glory to God I'm not here by votes I'm here because God placed me here but when I'm placed in the position as Pastor that's a different thing altoe there's going to be adopted Sons with the ministry of Jesus Christ behind the pulpit adopted evangelists adopted Apostles adopted prophets a prophet teachers adopted pastors do you believe that you will see that in your very eyes Oh Glory to God hallelujah I'm going to close persecution and trials are natural normal part of Christian Life hallu there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not leave the outworking and fin judgment to him thou can not bear them which are evil thou has tried them with s the apostles and a n and found them Liars these Ephesians believe that God's people ought to be holy yes according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unle from sin most evidently the apostasy had started sin entered the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul he said put away the wicked from among them that coming back in put away the wicked from among them they were a separated people they had come out of the world world and now they weren going to let the world come among them they would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life thou try them with say the apostles and not as found them Liars my that's is a blunt statement that was try them who call them Apostle isn't that presumptuous what wrers are people to try those who call themselves Apostles how do we try them I love this you see he's quoting the scriptures Galatians 18 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel among you other than what we have preached unto you let them be a curse it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DT or a dash of it Paul knew it was God's word who had spoken to him for he said even if I come and try to bring a second Revelation try to make a little change to what I originally give let me be a cursed you see Paul knew that the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can't give he he can give a revelation and act to it he did it in the Garden of Eden when he promised a seed to the woman and then later designated the seed to come to Abraham then later it would come to the bloodline and David and and it was the same Revelation it only give people more information to help them receive and understand stand but God's word can change and you see what those false prophets are doing they are they come with their own word this is it here right here they push the tapes aside they push the books aside and they're bringing forth the Revelation so the people have confidence that is my man woo nobody could bring word like that you know oh but it's their own word but the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will be already said in the word so they came with their own word those Ephesians knew what the word as Paul taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the Lan of Paul's hands they looked those false prophets in the eye and said you are not seeing what Paul said you are therefore false this coming back too straighten their eye I don't care how much in the congregation how long the preachers straighten their eye if you're not saying what Paul said you are false Hallelujah say oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle Prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them oh give the Lord some Praises it's not you trying to fight up a midur war you know oh glory to God is the word that is trying them the bride will become the word and the spirit will come upon the bride Oh
