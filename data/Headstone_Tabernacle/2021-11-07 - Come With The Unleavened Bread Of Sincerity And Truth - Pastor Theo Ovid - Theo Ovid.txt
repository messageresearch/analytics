to eight thank you musicians very soon thank you what happens here exodus chapter 12 verse 1 and the lord speaking to moses and aaron in the land of israel saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking unto all the congregation of israel seen in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man allam according to the house of the fathers allam for house if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eaten shall make you a count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening they shall take of the blood and strike it on those two side posts on the upper doorposts of the houses wherein they shall eat it they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter hoops she shall eat it eat none of it raw no sudden at all with water but rose with fire his head with his legs with the putin and thereof and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and and that which remained of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your line skirted your shoes on your feet your stuff in your hand you shall eat it in east it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night i will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beasts and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for talking upon the houses where you are when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt and this day shall be unto you for memorial and he shall keep it a feast to the lord through your generations you shall keep it a feast by the ordinance forever seven days shall we eat unleavened bread even the first day you shall put away 11 out of your houses for whosoever eat it 11 bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel and first corinthians chapter five reading from verse six paul with addressing that issue corinthians has been a carnal church natural church our moral church and that kind of a way moral behavior somebody was with his mother's husband our wife his father's wife and he says your glory is not good knowing ye not that a little level 11 at the whole lump that's the one i get to purge out there for the old level that he may be a new lump as he are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us here we go therefore let us keep the feast not with o level neither with the level of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth may god bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord welcome welcome this morning praise god we thank god for his love for his grace for his mercy to be here welcome one and all hallelujah so this morning i have a title come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that's the title this morning come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth other context scripture and it's from psalms 51 this is when a david fell in sin or with bathsheba and he was spoken to and david was calling upon god and he said have mercy upon me o god according to thy love and kindness according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly for my iniquity cleanse me from sin for i acknowledge my transgression and my sins ever before me against thee and thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when those speakers and be clear when thou judges behold i was shaped in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me be whole thou desirous truth in the inward paths that's where god wants you to come from from the inner being from inside of you not your tongue not your lip not your mouth truth from the inward paths oh glory to god he said thou desire is truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part though shall make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear the joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broke me rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities created me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with i free spirit then will i teach transgressors their ways and sinners shall convert unto thee deliver me from blood guiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness oh god open down thy lips and my mouth will show for thy praise for thou desire is not sacrifice else i would give it then thou the light is nothing but offering but the sacrifices of god are a broken heart a broken spirit a broken uncontrite heart oh god that was not despised david said if he sacrifices they want i wasn't going to give it it's not that what god want oh glory to god what called one is a broken heart a contrite spirit or creating me a clean heart and renew our right spirit within me oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah your sacrifice to come in this morning that's not what god's talking about he's talking about that heart you have insider dear oh give the lord some praises thank you lord jesus oh glory to god hallelujah in a meeting but the brandon was in somebody spoke in french and there was an interpretation and there was three people that interpreted it all said the same thing it was in french and these were the words because daw was chosen the narrow part he says see i have to walk by yourself you have to walk by yourself i can understand that watch he didn't have to do it but he did it moses because there was chosen a narrow path the haraway though has walked of your own chosen and people do what they want to do i'm convinced of that i think this sunday's one month is awful sugar i'm not saying that from my from a health perspective i choose that i never thought i'd drink coffee without sugar that was poison altogether that was something almost impossible but i have done it i'm doing it and i recognize you know when people determine because i determined to see about me i determined to deal with what i have and the challenges i have otherwise i'm going to deal with it i would just sit down and move but no no i'm going to deal with it and if i could come to that spot that i could do what i have done then i could do other things too no wonder pause that i can do all things through christ that strengthened me don't tell me you can't stand don't tell me you can't serve god don't tell me i can't press don't tell me you cannot pray don't tell me i can't do right think right don't tell me that you can oh glory to god you can you can let me give you a big one don't tell me you can't change oh give the lord some praises because ours chose the narrow part the hard way don't made you're walking your own choosing in other words i didn't have to do it i can side in and go with them if i want to but i stayed with what i want i stay with the world though i speak the precise decision it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion awaits thee now that's what i wondered when i die well then i happen to think heaven is not portion of the different portions of deer heaven is the kingdom of heaven that's within us that one waits for what a glorious decision god has made this in itself this decision is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine a prophet make a decision and we're going to get tremendous victory no no partial victory no no side of the mount my victory tremendous victory praise god you hear what i said no no smile anymore business you know i got my tremendous victory raise the ambition up a little bit god wanted to get tremendous victory god went to bless you he wanted to let your cup run over you want to have victory over the world the things of the world over every devil hallelujah give the lord a shout in the house tremendous victory [Applause] my god he said now let's quit playing you see what community jonah means let's cross over now let's quit playing let's cross the other side now all because all belongs to us it's ours them visions never fail they can't feel because they come from god and i believe it with all that is within me we are not the highland that will run back into the wilderness we will cross jordan the separation god breaks us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for joshua devises the people's inheritance and if you notice those hebrew mothers when they was in their labor and gave birth to those patriarchs one of these days the lord will give birth to those patriarchs when they spoke their name she also positionally place them in the kingdom inspiration is a paradox [Music] that's why some have it and some don't have it because inspiration is a paradox you just can't catch it it's inspired and god moves it into his right place so when the woman was groaning and said joseph that put him positionally it has to come with a groan that's why he said when a church is groaning under the persecution from the outside world that the holy ghost is just as real as it was to them on the day of pentecost when they are born and positionally born then god sets in the church no man said to nobody in no church god has to set people in the church fire have to come down you have to warn this fire glory to god don't come and join nothing come for fire come for god to baptize your soul come for heaven to come upon your life glory to god you must have church join them pastor love him look at the lord i shout in the house you have to love god you have to love the word oh glory to god you have to love truth [Applause] [Music] so paul had to confront the christian currents for not acting upon a man who claimed to be a believer having a sexual affair with his father's for his for his father's wife and he telling them that to remove that man if there's an unbeliever doing that is wanting but not somebody who claimed to be a christian in other words that and then he went on further to say a little level there's level the whole lump that means one rotten apple goes by the whole bunch so we have to be concerned about rotten apples and get the level out don't come here with 11 we have to get it out that is what this is about hallelujah get 11 out and this thing called 11 we read about it that god introduced that when they was coming out of egypt he said eat it with bitter herbs don't put no level in it eat it in haste don't just eat it you know is it a certain way go eat it in a rocking chair put your shoes on your foot put your stuff in your hand because you're leaving here you're on a journey glory to god no guarantees you're on a journey you have to trust me come on now preach back to me preach back to me somebody now you may be seated they could understand why the bunch of them want to go back to egypt because egypt they had food guaranteed they eat bread to the full pharaoh was fixing them right because they allowed them to walk but no god tell me you're coming up and you had to walk by faith oh glory to god you're coming out you're stuffing your hand a little bread no ease in it unleavened bread oh glory to god here you eat lemon cut it off don't put nothing to it don't add nothing in it don't put your own thoughts in it don't put your ideas in it don't put your teachings in it say what the tapes say oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you say turn that man over to the devil remove that level in the church get him out bring my fellowship better brother who's our fornicator hallelujah don't even mess with them don't leave them alone then they're nastiness leave them alone walk away from that oh glory to god a little level of the whole lump now sincere the word sincere is free from pretense or deceit proceeding with genuine feelings honest pure true the definition of sincere being in reality what it appears to be i like that so i see somebody saying something and afterwards you see a different behavior but i didn't know he was so it wasn't sincere maybe there are politicians you know politicians are sincere right the stallion light normal normal normally no they can keep the promise but they promising to get what a vote god is not a politician when he speaks he keeps his word that's why i love him the absence of pretense deceit or hypocrisy genuineness truthfulness having a character which corresponds with the appearance oh god give the lord some praises let's drill down a little bit sincerity is the virtue of one who communicates and acts in accordance with the entirety of their feeling beliefs and thoughts and desires is a manner that is honest and genuine oh glory to god so god's word of sincerity and truth as that word has the power to sanctify and to cleanse and you know jesus says sanctify them by thy truth thy word is true not somebody thoughts on ideas thy word is true second timothy says ye all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers will watch worse and worse deceiving and being deceived they themselves deceived and them receiving others oh my my my and if you amplify that word but wicked men and imposters will go from battle ways everything that bad now some of them always are ready but they're going from battle voice deceiving and leading astray others and being deceived and let away let us treat themselves but for you continue to hold to the things that you have learned of which you are convinced knowing from whom you learn them the worst person is a person in that convince you can't even be sincere because you're half-hearted you're you're neither on defense you're on the fence there you don't know going left you're going right you're just balancing the devil go throw you off you know you better get something to be convinced of and when they get convinced of it you could stand for it oh glory to god hallelujah i was convinced that women belong to some man all girls and so on have some husbands somewhere so don't fool with that nobody because they have a fool with them it's like a fool of somebody's wife i cause convinced that since a young man oh glory to god so i was in charge and i was taking a hold of my behavior and attitude towards woman oh give the lord a praise offering all glory to god because i wanted my marriage to work i wanted to have one wife not 10 wives not no no no one wife oh god i don't want to get the right wife so i have to pray sincerely to god that i could get to the annmarie oh give the lord i shall make my feel good now all glory to god nobody else nobody else could fit that spot oh hallelujah hallelujah get the lord some praises thank you lord and amplified and from your childhood you have had a knowledge of and have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to instruct you and give you understanding for salvation which comes through faith in christ jesus through the learning of the entire human personality on god in christ jesus in absolute trust and confidence in its power wisdom and goodness every scripture is god breathed oh every scripture is god breathed and given by inspiration and is profitable for instruction for reproof for conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience for training and righteousness amen ministers for training righteousness in holy living in what holy living and conformity to god's will and thought purpose and action and i preach another two sundays also are back so that the man of god may be complete and proficient when fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work jesus praying in saint john 17 he said i've given them thy word and the world had hated them say if they would love you you know something kind of cuckoo because they will love their own but you are in the world but not of the world so you have to be different and if you have different yet something wrong you have to be known to be different everybody you can't be like everybody else god bring you out to egypt god bring you out a world god bring you out to that to be a different people all together that's why you're coming to learn the ways of god when david said he said created me a clean hat david knows how corrupt david know his heart ain't good if his heart was good he didn't behave that way okay the lord i shout in the house hallelujah his desires got perversed all glory to god he was a man just like you and i but he got it right he came back on the right track and i want to tell you this morning get back on the right track oh get it right oh give the lord a shout this morning hallelujah he said i pray watch he said i have given them thy word and the will not hated them because why why they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that dog should just take them out of the world but that those shoulders keep them from the evil so it's not that god wants us among them by receiving somewhere no we must be in but not off i want a bigger amen than that i am preaching to you this morning if this is the scriptures if this is the word say amen don't watch me and steer say amen hallelujah they are in but not off they are in the world and of the world praise god then he says verse 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou sent me into the world even so i have also sent them into the world so we just come to warmer church bent we are come to be sent just as god called us you have to send us also who you think bring in your loved ones and your family and your brothers and your sisters it's you you're glory to god i hear you every one of you is evangelists come on come on now every one of you call to win somebody else every one of you called to

after service we have about 102 young people going to get that baptized right of this service amen oh give the lord some praises so god's word is that the means he used to get his things done so when he wants something he speaks let there be let there be he said my word shall not return to me void before you could be here he had to put these scriptures for you to be here did you hear that i'll say it again before you could be here you have to put you in the scriptures for you to be here behold i send you ladder the prophet and he shall turn the house of the children that's you back to the faith of the fathers that's them back there oh give the lord a shout in the house elijah come for nobody elijah come for somebody he called he come for the bride of jesus christ so you have to find you in trinidad if you were two miles down under the earth you had to drop dynamite and blow up the whole earth to get to you oh glory to god summon you buried deep because you asked you are like diamonds

lust and your own heart and your own desires he doesn't leave you alone he's not talking about another people he's talking about his people oh glory to god he's talking about israel then people in the message saying there will be a past they don't have this is the god of the word what did the bible say saint john one he came unto his own his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him that's us to them that's us give power that's us to become the sons of god man i feel good this morning i feel like my battery getting recharged i feel ready young again oh glory to god hallelujah praise god oh glory to god maybe the greatest had to turn back black i don't know oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me say it again god when you no longer want to hear god's voice he will leave you after a while to your own lust to your own desires oh my so that's why you say how can we know our meat how can we know his debate by by constantly being in the world that we could know our mate the revealed word so you are challenged to stay in that word not stay in facebook stay in the word not stay on youtube stay in the word find out what god say not what somebody on youtube everybody have a voice now everybody's saying things i see some liar some man receiving people long time with two years of false information concerning vaccinations he dead and gone he couldn't get to court with the charge deb gone not people dying they want her for you see what happened the internet gave everybody a voice facebook everybody on my facebook everybody could say something everyone have an opinion i feel i think i see i hear i know shut up that every man would be a lie and god would be true hallelujah well i'm the president of this country shut up use god god is the word that every man would be a lie and let god would be true there's going to be a by revival that's what god said when the power of this church rises that's what god said we have a seventh on the revival that is what god said i feel revival over take a feeling and go with it we say the revival coming oh glory to god give the lord a show well i will die preaching this thing [Applause] oh glory give the lord a shout if they taught more than a stretcher and they put a microphone by remote while i'm going out in the stretcher i'll be saying seven thunders give faith seven thousand by

i don't want nothing else if i crazy leave me alone go your way oh give the lord a shouting house hallelujah i ain't preached a false doctrine i have nothing to take back i say what the tapes say and god going to honor it [Applause] [Music] [Music] come with the unleavened bed of sincerity and truth you see how jesus accepted me like a little child a child is completely honest completely a child have no guile they will say i don't like that like one of my grandsons say say grandpa he do like avocado he says avocado tastes too much like avocado i can't fight him i can't force him so this is what the kingdom's supposed to made of children sons and daughters with no hidden agenda with no hidden motive as to why you do i helping you you know because i wear my back no guy you help because you choose you give because you want you serve because you choose you love because you choose you worship because you choose you act because you choose you're responsible for your actions you don't say well because he before she because them and that is why you know how you move no you want to move or you move you're making them excuses you're not accepting responsibility for your action you're not going to get because that was chosen you will get better god has reacted that's not what they caught on the prophet because that was the artist you know because that was chosen you choose the hide away anybody could smoke and drink and carry around a woman die no hurting that what they were doing but when you choose to be a soldier a christian stands for principle stands for what is right you think right you speak right you act right you must come out right so when you stand up and connect to psalms one blessed is the man that walketh not in the conquest of the ungodly nor stand in the way of sinners nor sit in the seat of this conference but as the light is in the law of the lord and in that law that he meditated day and night he shall be like a tree planted not just thrown outside by waters whatever you're going to prosper so when prosperity prosperity hits you and your trees are the blossom what do you say your choice you choose hallelujah praise god amen blessed be the name of the lord [Music] but branham you say god at this altar every heart present here and around the nation may the waters from under the altar of god gush out this morning upon your church and water it you say lord for the seasons just about finish give it life the waters of life that it might be able to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened for your great ground you see where god wants us to be ripened that ripeness is maturity yes that rightness is the quality of anchor that will possess your soul that they wouldn't react and act the way you do because it's just sure green you are and god doesn't have misclasses yeah jump from one to three you will go and do two and if you fail two you make it repeat because you have to get through two to go to three so the test will come hot and heavy one after each other to get you going right and if you know this as the principle of god you will begin to thank god for every test because the test really is trying to bring the best out of you whether it comes from your wife or your husband or your children or your family or the boss or the neighbor it doesn't matter where it comes from the test is the best that got to release to you because you are accounted worthy to be tested because god wants to pre-qualify you ah oh glory to god not all who say lord lord that all that came up was israel no god caught a bunch but out of the bunch is another bunch a bunch and a bunch hallelujah holy ghost bunch oh blessed be the name of the lord he said watch he said father i pray for them but the stalk must dry so i cannot pray for it it must die so it is dead but i pray for the wheat lord that is forming into the body of christ that's you who are here this morning who are free to take this grant lord that the fresh waters of god will keep its cheeks beared with tears of joy and understanding until the command comes to take it home in jesus name i committed all to you lord the results is yours or we thank you god lord as we set in this summer moment almost like a funeral for we are facing the burial of a dying dead world a dying death church you say oh god gather your way quickly father come quickly lord jesus bless thy people father bring sincerity and deepness to the heart of the people may we get off from fragile dancing and settle down into the deep riches of the honey of god granted lord keep our hearts established with love and sincerity bless thy people everywhere father as we leave this place may we go to the in the name of the lord jesus to speak that which is sincere that which is truth that which is right may we shun what is wrong lord when a man begins to lie to us may we quickly turn our back upon him turn our back on all the filthy jokes and the things of the world and just break oh glory to god hallelujah and just turn our backs and walk away help us dear god maul us make us break us make us into the image of sons and daughters of god that we might act with the virtue of the holy spirit not with your temper not with your senses not with your desire but act with the virtue of the holy spirit are you with me we commit ourselves to you with our hands in each other in jesus name amen could we give the lord some praises hallelujah glory thank you lord let's continue lebron now my ministry is in a little slump now because it's changing in america from one to another and if you notice it the first was a sign that the people could looked at the second was a sign that only god himself could do now on this third ministry it lays right straight back in the lap of the people now you know the first sign he had when people were sick and he hold him his hands used to show something of what's wrong with them and he could see they could see it on his hand see it a different reaction in his hands he will know yeah i can't say that to him and whatnot the second was discernment they know only god could do that your name is so and so your house number is so and so your streets and so and so you did so last night they knew that was god but listen to this one watch he says no but this third one he said if they'll come with sincerity talk about the people now no doubt at all watch the holy spirit operate itself it comes upon me and tell them just exactly it heals right there but they have got to come not with an emotional fate but with a solid fate to believe it's the truth see as god puts it right back in the individual lap again because it has to be that way because there's no power in man to heal so after a while you sit there and you believe the word being preached that's the truth and if that's the truth then god is god god can't lie then the true men that body could dissolve your cancer could disappear your female condition could be resolved whatever is aching you blood in you praise god your faith begin to move up nothing brother of it it's not faith in me when when that lay man was what peter said you think it is me he that man is faith in jesus name come on same as somebody so in other words your faith could move god to inspire the preacher to minister to you by the word that word come out of his lips that he was not even thinking of will be god ministering directly to you [Applause] hallelujah but it takes a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ into present tense if we're taking theology what would the persecution mess in this baptist catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a chance or support unknown people but it doesn't take knowledge say it doesn't take knowledge say it again it doesn't take knowledge so you do have to know everything it takes a humbler dedicated to god to bring jesus christ into present tense that's why they're going to take note with peter that they were ignorant and unlearned but they were declaring god their lives declared god their actions declared god they were manifesting god or give the lord a shout we don't need as much knowledge as we think but we need god we need the holy ghost and fire oh glory to god amen not thy power not by might but by his spirit i'll unfold this mystery and he will cry grace greece unto it oh my so not learning is the grace of god thank you jesus thank you lord jesus interestingly matthew 16 dr finance very interesting scripture and when the disciples would come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread so then come breadless then jesus said to them take heed and beware of the level of the pharisees and of the sadducees and the reason among themselves seen is it because we have taken no bread which jesus perceive he says to them oh he of little faith why reason you're among yourselves because you have brought no bread do you not understand neither remember the five lows and the five thousand and how many passes you took up neither the seven loans of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up how is it then that you do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread but that you should be aware of the level of the pharisees and the sadducees then understood thee how that he speak not beware of the level of the bread but of the doctrine the doctrine of the pharisees and the services teachings it will send it to hell or the tribulation either one is terrible beware any man bringing any teaching or revelation that you can't find in the bible you can't find any prophet's word i don't care how much injuries they meet they can meet him last night yesterday i don't care which rank the angels have you come from this level at that level on that level fourth level fifth level paul said you know what paul said right if an angel come from heaven one way straight backwards yes and preach any other gospel running more channel yes yes yes show him where the exit is you know i look at how light and bright he is you know some people oh god yeah what do you say all i want to do is jersey because angel better speak that word so if you don't know the word you'll be deceived all right and strange enough right after that when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked disciples who women say that that they said manner some said i was johnny baptist he said whom do you say that i am and that's where peter said that were the christ the sons of the living god and what was it it was heaven drop down upon peter and give him divine revelation do you have that this morning divine revelation you have to have that you know because you say upon this rock i've been my church this is not the church he bill you know this had some time after building that jesus building we build this the church he talked about here that's the rock of revelation that is to be built inside your heart because when you get that rock nobody can take it out nope listen no pope no bishop no no man no woman wife nothing could separate you from the love of god that connected inside of them wife or no wife husband or husband boyfriend or no boyfriend girlfriend or not girlfriend it doesn't matter you know [Applause] faith of all fathers living still hallelujah so in the amplified the scripture we read he said purge clean out the old level that you will be fresh new dough still uncontaminated as you are for christ our passover has been sacrificed therefore let us keep the feast not at all level nor with the level of vice and malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of purity nobility honor and sincerity and unadulterated truth do you know what malice is you know you hear the word malice you know what malice is malice is the desire to harm someone now when paul talks about malice he's not talking about unbelievers you know themselves already no you don't want to treat folks having malice malice is ill will wrong intention desire to cause pain and injury or distress to one another again i'm thundery we will give it on the right back we have seven for you no it's a brother coming to me i go let somebody come from outside the community i light fire under the behind they've run out as fast as they're coming oh hallelujah this is not your father's house this is my father's house oh glory to god my father's house can't be a denative and a bunch of rascals we come out of the world not to find the world inside of here we leave back them things to find something different we'll give the lord a shout get delivered out [Applause] all right let's hit the home stretch for the brain jesus went to the wilderness to fast after the holy ghost come upon him not before for the holy ghost to come on him but he went in and fasted after the holy ghost came upon him now in the vision to talk about the vision i was about three o'clock in the morning i suppose i've gotten up i looked there in front of me it was coming down to the jordan it looked like i was standing on the map of palestine i was coming down to the jordan seemed like i could hear the song i'm going down to jordan someone was singing it and i drew near the river i looked back and seeing which way i come i was tutors of the way dear to the jordan and i look across jordan and i said oh praise god just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promised lay in the promised land then i came to myself i thought could i have possibly could i have been dreaming because it was nighttime and a vision is something that you see with your eyes open like a dream you're looking right at it you're conscious that you are standing there on a platform and you're standing there but when you look like you're in a dream you can't explain it there's no way to do it then i sit there a little bit aside on this chair all of a sudden he'd come back again then i knew it was a vision then when i come into the vision again it seemed that i was lifted up sitting on a highway a narrow highway with some brother i never knew who the brother was i look around i said now i'm sure i know this is a vision the lord god is here it seemed like everybody was afraid and i said what is everybody so afraid of and a voice came and said there is such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that is dead when it strikes you i heard the weeds mashing down and i look and here come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds i taught now knowing this is a vision then i shall see what this animal obese is he crawled up on the highway and as soon as i got sight of him i knew it was a mamba now amanda is an african snake which is the most deadly bite of all thing there is there is nothing as poison as a member the snake of course represents sin and death now he said no when we go to africa in india we find they have the cobra there's a black cobra he's a bad snake he's a dead bite too there's a yellow cobra which is far beyond him and the yellow cobra the patient dies with such a horrible that it dies from suffocation it paralyzes the breeding system they can't breed just open their mouth and gap trying to and die like that and that's the type of snake that was one lick from getting billy paul when we got the snake in africa and here comes the man but he is dead he is so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his steel just whoosh and he's going to hit you in the face usually stands up high and strikes hard and when he hits you you've got a few breaths till you're finished it don't he said turn real it it don't only paralyze you it gets into the bloodstream it gets the news everything you die just in a few seconds damn native boys and track boys you can say mamba and butt the head scream and running it's dead in a few seconds when i hit you and here he was on the highway i thought well this is it so i looked at him he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he come close to me he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and quiver and stop and something would hold him off he wouldn't bite me and he would turn around on the other side and try to approach from this side and he would get back and get a stab swish right around towards me get slower slower and then stop and he would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me then he turned and look at my friend and away he went after my friend and i see my friend just jumping up in the air and over him and over here and over him trying the thing was striking at him and he thought oh if it ever hits him it will be instant dead no wonder everybody is scared because this thing hits you it's instant death it was just striking at him like that and i threw my hands up and said oh god have mercy on my brother i said if that supper ever strikes him it will kill him and just then the serpent turned to me when i said that and look at me again and a voice came from above me said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any now watch this the snake couldn't bite him he was protected his burden switched to his brother that was on the run so it wasn't about him or give the lord some shouts it was about his brother isn't that right and when he said god have mercy for my brother voice drop down and say you have been given not i will give you have been given power power to bind him the worst or any oh glory to god hallelujah listen to birmingham response after that voice i said well god what must i do so he didn't say yagin power okay wait wait wait man no lord what must i do he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere no they know the preacher we talking about he's a prophet this is dealing with others now this is dealing with being given power and what it will take to manage what has been given to us he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere i said well god forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity and when i raise up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me that lifted me up it seemed like my whole body was charged with something after what when he said forgive me lord for insincerity give me sincerity we have to come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and we can't come as we normally do something has to change i trust something changed this morning when i look at the serpent then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet so this open take a tune back in him again and he said satan in the name of the lord jesus christ i bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him he's a spiritual component like the blue smoking name a blue smoke flowed on him and he curled up and make like an unsigned backward sign and and bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and he still choked his own self to death around his head when he made this backward s and sign like that and the brother was free i went over and mashed on it i said no i've got to find out about this because it's a vision i hit on the thing it turned like it looked like a handle like a glass and a picture and just made it into solid crystal think of that how quick the blue smoke was life and everything had left it all the elements turned to glass and then a voice came on me and said you can unbind him also and i said satan that i might know i unbind you and when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and i said i'd buy you back in the name of jesus christ you you carry them on buying for too long that is trouble he said that i might know i can bang you and as he said come on i bang you back in the name of jesus christ and then he choked himself right back and turned to crystal when he did that the voice said no you must be more sincere than what you are to do this can we worship the lord then it left me and i was standing in the room a few moments i heard a clock go off and my wife getting up the cheering you know your house what i'm gonna wear today mama where are my books what did i do you know so i stepped off to the den room and i got to my knees and i said lord jesus i don't know these things what must i do and the children will be calling me to take them to school in a few moments what must i do i looked around and my bible was laying dear i said lord if you would forgive me i do not believe in opening up the scripture and taking something out of the bible saying but in the times when god can comfort you by such a thing i said lord in this case of emergency right now before your spirit leaves me i i don't know what to do the kids will be in an hour yet before they'll be gone would you show me if there's something you're trying to get to me heavenly father then let me know and i took the bible and pulled it open and my tongue was laying on first corinthians the fifth chapter the eighth verse when something reads something like when you come i was planning on taking a fast to the lord and i told him i would go out and fast he said when you come to the feast which is the fast in the body is a feast with the lord we know that when you come to this feast don't come with the old living of malice and so forth but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth just exactly what he told me the vision and this is where i get the title from come god is my solid judge come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that is the word could we give the lord some praises that is where i get a title of the message from then i seen what he meant as he years ago when i seen the bible come down i got it right here and a hand came from heaven and pointed down to joshua and i read the first nine verses and stopped there and that was joshua come to the wilderness but he was ready when he was near jordan god called him and said this day i'll begin to magnify you before the people and then he took the children of israel across jordan i went to the woods and prayed and prayed and fasted and i went back to the tree where i had met those squirrels were you heard the other message and so forth and i met god god helped me to live through i'm almost done mission quran please border man in studying the history of the church life of sin martin and all dawn he says they followed a man right on to his life how he raised two dead people cast out evil spirits spokes around tongues seeing vision and things when a great man but yet the very secret of his power was in humility before god and we find today that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the scientific believer yet we find them puffed out big me little you that isn't like the early church you see are you ready they were humble kind to one another and sweet somebody showed out sweet there's not sweet like sweet to suck like sweetie this is sweet to each other oh my they were sweet understanding it was so much different today and i wonder if a lot of this hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message that we want to humble ourselves and keep yourselves the more humbler you can be the better god will use you probably give the lord a shout on that one the more humble we can be the better god will use you so many people today are open up their hearts to the wrong things you get a spirit all right but many times it contradicts the word see that's the devil under the disguisement of christianity god help us when we get down into this a bit and you receive an evil spirit in the disguisement of christianity instead of humility and power of the spirit you've got the word without the spirit hallelujah and you do more harm than you would if you were like the rest of them what's the trouble today they have so many revelations and false things it is prostrating themselves out there and open up their hearts to devils instead of staying with the word of god that's the trouble that is what matters oh my i'm almost done many people say if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing or serving but that's up to you you have got something to do too they don't overcome shall inherit all things they are overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready you see god couldn't push us through a pipe and pull us to the other end and say blessed he will overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you have got to make decisions yourself because though has chosen you've got to do what make decisions yourself hallelujah watch and i have to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show our feet and respects to god brother branham you talk about i want to see my church the church of god in deep sincerity i want to see the old-fashioned pramitans i want to see them times when they can can't leave the church they stay all night and pray and fast and call until god answers is i think one of the things that keep our people from being healed is a lack of confession it's a lack of sincere confession for instance this might sound a little bit bad i don't mean it in this way but looking at my wife here what if i go out here today throw my hands around another woman make love to her and i know after i did that i was wrong so wrong of course my comforter would keep me from doing that see but i mean if i did that and it happened that i didn't or anything similar to it then i would the first thing is to say to my wife before i could say to god forgive me because i sinned against her if you come to the altar and remember you have an ought go make that right first because you can't plug into the sauce if you have an oat do you get that see if you come at the altar and you say lord i want you to heal me we have a great oat against it and so and so go go go heal you you're not plugged in you have to plug into the source by obeying what he said go there sister says sister i'm sorry please forgive me and then come back to the old and say lord i already know fire i come from a healer now healing the children's bread pika glory to god amen so whatever happened i did so and similar to it and i know the first thing is to say to my wife before i could say to god forgive me because i sin against her and if you come to the altar remember you have an odd go i made a right first before you offer your gift so i've got to go to her i believe in confession is straighten up also but what if i said i'm going to confess it i've done wrong and i said lord god oh oh friend of mine you know what i know you real well praise the lord i think you're a good old fellow forgive me you know old friend i didn't mean it that way see that's sacrilegious to make a confession like that hey you know we're going on dates you know you know something happened but you forgive me if you figure it there's no confession they're trying to ski that all over it right but what if i go and say lord i didn't mean to do it just that way and you help me i won't do it again he refused my sacrifice until i first and go and make it right with my wife and if when i come with her with the same irreverence and say oh old girl friend of mine old mother my children and old sweetheart you know old chumps for a long time say what if i put my arms around another woman what do you say about it oh would you forgive me don't marry and she looks you think what happened to my husband see the first thing she wouldn't know whether i was kidding or whether i wasn't and you don't go that way to make a confession to your fellow man or god you go with the depths of sincerity with godly sorrow of your sin first you must be sorry i must tell a sweetheart come here it may mean the rest of our married life the woman that i live with that's my sweetheart how i love you all these years but now you may leave me from this on but you may not stay with me you may not accept me but knowing that yet to make it right i've got to make it right then i've got to tell god the same way and tell both her and god with the sincerity that i'll never do it again by the grace of god and maybe my speech to her would convince her but my speech wouldn't convince god he looks in my heart he knows after all just a few more years with her if god permits and will be taken out of this world but with god is eternity so i must be deeply sincere with god then if i am sincere he will hear me and if i'm not sincere there is no need of me wasting god's time listening to me so you cannot go any more halfway you have to be deeply sincere hallelujah and then he shared this here i noticed the people making their confession has to come with deepness of sincerity he's talking about i believe it was in birmingham term new york a lack of sincerity seemed like and i wonder there was one man that was healed a one in particular speaking of the man had great affliction he was healed this night standing here and before we left five days the affliction was back on him again see because in the presence of the holy spirit it took that off of him just like they did the young woman a while ago here in the yard didn't pay something softly young man last night but it has to be a deep sincerity to know that the god here we go listen that the god that can take it away from you with the same anointing on you can keep it from you see then the holy spirit spoke to me one morning about daylight said get up on the platform and bring these people up here and make them confess everything they did before you pray for them unless the will repents it's got to perish praise the name of the lord so i'm going to close second corinthians 4 1-3 i'm going to read it amplified paul speaking considering ministry he said therefore since we do hold and engage this ministry by the mercy of god granting us favor benefits and opportunities we have renounced disgraceful ways secret thoughts feelings desires and underhandedness the method and arts that many hide through shame we refuse to deal craftily to practice trickery and cunning or to the adulterate to or handle this honestly the word of god and we state the truth openly clearly candidly so we commend ourselves in the sight and presence of god to every man's conscience so paul was saying we are not trying to be on the hand crafty manipulating the word manipulating people but we present the word in such openness that we are open to every man's conscience oh blessed me and even if our guts will be hidden or obscured or covered up with the veil that hinders the knowledge of god it is hidden to only to those who are perishing this is where i'm going to close god we realize that the badge of authority is not a name or denomination but it's the power the power of the resurrection of christ in each individual's life god miss people here this morning strive to enter that and if this tape should ever get out to the country where the people are out let them know that it wasn't set for malice because i'd be wrong myself that the church might be triumphant and realize this place now we pray father that you'll forgive some of our sins may this message you could begin to sing but anthony may this message sink deep into the hearts may the people with this church as this little tamina could know in the billion process of building a church may they never look to some beautiful something but just enough to shelter the people god may they never go back and look and say we belong to this big tabernacle we got a big dome on it god let it not be empty hull may never lose sight of the object of jesus christ may it be the one that fills the temple and then the power and fire of the holy ghost will fall on the altar upon them
