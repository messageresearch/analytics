press I'm going to overcome I'm going to stand I'm going to LIF for God that's what we yet to do all scriptures given by inspiration is profitable for rebuke and correction and instruction in all righteousness the scriptures there to do something for our lives it didn't benefit Israel because the word wasn't mixed with faith so they just press on in inertia straight line same beat day in day out no change whatsoever same attitude no expectation but you see inertia is interrupted by an external Force I will be your external Force so your beat will be interrupted in this church you will not continue the way you come you're going to be transformed something going to change you I'll interrupt your beat I'll interrupt your walk I'll interrupt your attitude that is what I'm here for oh give

oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know what day they call this day Palm Sunday you know what happened today everybody was in Jerusalem everybody was in an expectation they didn't know what was going to happen and all of a sudden a donkey came riding all of a sudden a man was on that donkey he was the Messiah the king came right and LLY that was our King riding humbly that was our dynamics that was our power that was our re Jesus come riding into Jerusalem and the people begin to shout the people begin to worship but hosana hosana blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord you better bring your worship and the people got so terrified they said stop them from worshiping he said if I stop them The Rock's going to cry out I can't stop when the time come for the people to worship if I stop The Rock's going to cry out you may be seated woo W Hallelujah this message is alive God is not dead he is still alive still alive he's still in the healing business the delivering business the restoring business the anointing business and the thing I love about him you may be seated is that nobody could keep you from receiving your blessing oh Hallelujah nobody could hold back your your blessing from you oh hallelujah oh he he's the lovely one this morning oh we are blessed to be in this age this is the last age sad to say is the last age Hallelujah that's good to say it's the last age we don't have another age coming we going to close this age up with a shout we're going to leave this world with a shout we wouldn't leave word scratching our head like L's wife looking back to see what we leaving back no this bride will leave here shouting we'll be saying goodbye World good morning glory that's what we're going to be saying goodbye World good morning glory that's what we going to be saying we're going to be changed you talk about changed we ought to be changed right now on the inside and then the body is going to be changed will be changing the very atoms in the moment and the twile of an eye and we will not be here we have a scripture a man named Enoch you may be see that he walked with God and was not for God took him but before God took him you see there are so much people like to talk about what God allow it almost like if there's no devil what God allowed and God allowed the devil to afflict me and God allowed this and stop studying what God allow and start to study what you have a right to you see because God give promises inside of here that we have to take the kingdom is preached and Every Man Press their way into it and those who understand who they are they could take it only those you see you see when those Fighters they were taking some land I think we read it already Joshua tell them he said listen we want some food for men we're going to take the kings of this this one and that King head off and that king and the King was the guy say what happened you know you going to do that what you talking about they don't want to get them he said when I come back I go beat you Hallelujah because when God said to take that them fellas are saying how do we have enough men do we have enough sword do we have enough ability that was not the question the question is God said it we just do it we executed so these guys were so positive they said we going and take them Kings head off we need food we are hungry famishing give us food the man said they want to give them food he said when I come back we'll deal with you man they take them king's head off handle the whole thing and come back and put licks because that is what they say they want to do so listen we are hungry this morning this [Applause] evening we have we have some battle to do this evening are you with me are you going to fight this evening let's all stand for the word Deuteronomy chapter 8 Amos chapter 3 and Revelation chapter 10 for the word remember in me in prayer on Wednesday I'm on my way to Ivory Coast for the Easter meeting and Ivory Coast I'm expecting a great time over there in the Lord next month supp to be Cameroon praise God so let's Deuteronomy chapter 8 read verse one all the Commandments which I command the this day shall he observe to do that he may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manner which thou knowest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord do man live Amos 3 we want to read from verse 7 and 8 and next we read Revelation 10 81 read in Amos 3 verse 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion had roared who will not fear the lord God had spoken who can but prophesy Revelation 10 and you going to read from verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again saying go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me a little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter shall be thy mouth with as honey I took the little book out of the Angel's hand ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings let's bow our heads father we have read your word bless it speak may they hear your word from your mouth your voice in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated Hallelujah the title have this evening is the word from the mouth of God hallelujah I'm subject living by the word title again the word from the mouth of God Jesus said it when the devil tempted him to turn the stone into bread he quoted the scripture man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God and I'm talking today about the word from the mouth of God now they have billions of people on the Earth millions of mouths on the earth men and preachers on the earth it's onean thing for words to come out the mouth of a man or men but is another thing for it to come out the mouth of Goden when God brought all the children of Israel and they came to the mountain and fire Came Upon the mountain and the mountain begin to shake and earthquake and so on the people said don't let God speak let Moses speak amen and God say okay I'm going to let Moses speak he going to be my mouthpiece amen isn't that right so then the mouthpiece of God are His prophets yes sir and Amos said surely the Lord will do nothing except he revealed the secrets unto his servants the prophets amen so therefore when Adam fell God continued in his creation to try to find a man who would live every word he tried to find a man that would live the word for his age and we find out that Satan caused Adam to Fall by that one word by saying you shall not surely die and God continue on in his creation to try to find one man that would live by every word his first man fail and this man would live his time his age live in now there are different ages that God prophesied from the beginning which would take place all down and that's the reason he could tell the end from the beginning what if Moses had brought Noah's message it wouldn't work amen what if Jesus brought Moses message it wouldn't work so we can't bring a Methodist message or a Baptist message or a Pentecostal message it wouldn't work amen isn't that right so we've got to find out the what the scripture says for today that's why Jesus said it this way he that believeth on me as the scripture had said amen in other words it has come right back to what's written in the scriptures isn't that right so God excuse me is going to judge the World by the church which one Catholic 66 something El naations how's he going to do that God is going to judge the World by Jesus Christ because in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us God and the word is the same and this is God in print this is God in print amen I want to say it again this is God in print am so that's why the devil don't want you to even read the Bible because this is God in print but Jesus said it is written it is written it is written oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises so the word of God is God on print amen Brethren God on print here we go Jehovah printed on a book oh give the Lord some Praises Jehovah printed on a book isn't that right here we go he has got to judge the church by some standard and he cannot judge it by the standard of any system that we have made so there are churches and there are systems built around the churches how they humiliate the deacons or how they Jam the trustees or how they press the ushers or how they do this or how to do that how they straighten their members out they have systems around the word sys are built around the word but it's not the word the word is always [Applause] God so when Jesus came he came andet systems Pharisees scribes Sadducees e he met systems and he was the word so he was bringing the present tense reality of truth but they had the systems that was built around the truth which was SP and pans gospel handwashing gospel Thou shalt not and do this and do that and he came and bring the word and when he brought the word it was rejected because the word is always rejected because the world can't handle truth and system is built off of the world because system is always manmade but the word is God church is man-made but revelation of Upon This Rock I'll build my church that's [Applause] God and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall never Prevail against it fight with it wrestle with it come against it Hallelujah so when God put a tick on your life before the foundation of the world no man can ex you off on the earth I will say it again when God put a tick on your life a green tick on your life before the foundation of the world nobody can ex you down here come on now come on Glory Glory Hall the woman in the well she had a tick on her life before the foundation of the world but then Earth they put an ex on her and Jesus came to tell her you have a tick up CSA woman don't bother with those men I come to tell you you have a green tick you are all right you are fine oh I want to hear a bigger shout than that okay so watch because every one of our systems are man-made and listen it has to be judged yes sir now if you want to disagree and say no I believe you're wrong there but brandham I believe ours or the other fellow would say well ours is well then which one is right then there are 900 different systems of it so God could not judge the church by 900 100 different systems there will be one and that will be God will judge the World by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word so that is why every church is Sovereign yes and you cannot take the standard of one church and show it on another church the standard is the word regardless of where that church is this is the standard not race not color not hair not skin just the word word because this written word is what became flesh in the person of Jesus Christ he was this word Made Alive I want to hear you ride with me this evening so when they asked John the Baptist who are you he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness he was quoting the written scriptures he was quoting the word himself because the scripture is the word from the mouth of God oh Hallelujah and when the mouth of God speaks something nothing could stop it he said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I sent it to accomplish w you don't know I feel this evening Glory so Jesus knowing the scriptures knowing what David said I shall not suffer my soul that soul in corruption nor leave my my leave his soul in hell my Holy One he knew David spoke speaking about him by prophecy because men of old were moved by the spirit and spoke the prophecy and when Jesus read that scripture he could rest his soul on it because that was the word from the mouth of God he said destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up myself Jesus was relying on the word from the mouth of God that was spoken to David come on say Amen somebody they were so convinced that it was from God they could hand their soul and it Jesus said destroy this body never a man speak like that man never a man speak like that [Applause] man do you do you understand Daniel Daniel said I read by books and I understood the time that was at hand and I begin to seek the Lord because all these these brothers understood that the word from the mouth of God cannot fail man's word will not stand but this word one time Jesus heaven will pass away but my words will never pass away he was so convinced of where he come from and what he was he could say my word will never pass away come on are you going with me now oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so we are coming back that we could live by the scriptures live by word the word oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you may be seated let me just share a few scriptures with you Matthew 2:23 and he came and dwelt in the city of Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a Nazar Matthew 13:34 all these things spake Jesus UN in unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable speaking it unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world Matthew 27:35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfill which was spoken of by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vest did they cast lots Mark 7:6 he answered them and said well had Isaiah's prophesy of you Hypocrites for it is written this people honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me so you begin to understand that Jesus was living the word and identifying scripture being fulfilled because he knew every word that came out from the mouth of God it can't fail it can't lie it's the truth you shall know the truth and the truth going to set you free we need to hear a word not any word but the word from the mou of [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah glory and Jesus John 12 when he had found a young ass and sat and thereon as it is written fear not da of Zion Behold thy King cometh sitting on an ass a cult oh Jesus hallelujah oh Jesus oh Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah you see I recognize people don't know the scriptures oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah they know what preachers say but they don't know what the Bible said Hallelujah this time I think I'm going to read this scripture what the Day represent think I'm going to go ahead and take it from Matthew chapter uh 21 I'm going to read it you could find if you one chapter 21 and when they drew n un Jerusalem which will come of Bethpage unto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus two disciples oh listen this is beautiful saying unto them go this is Jesus go into the village against you and straight way you shall find an ass tide and a cold with her loose them and bring them unto me amen now now if this not handled right these guys could be arrested for theft if this is not handled right you could call your authorities because they didn't own that Jesus didn't raise that and Jesus told his disciples he said go and you're going to find these animals there just loose them and bring them to me now here the subtext If any man say unto you ye shall say the Lord hath need of them amen listen that's not all and straight way he will send them this is not a mean man this is not a stingy man this is not a selfish man this is a man that has the ability to surrender to the will of God straight way [Applause] now what I want to point out to you is this when the season changes for the scripture to be fulfilled they have to lose that [Applause] cult we are coming for the cold you not hear what I'm saying you are not hearing what I am say and no man going to ask what we want with it because the Lord have need of it oh give the Lord some praise His People I'm saying the Lord I need of somebody inside of here brother the devil got to take his hands off of your life could we give the Lord some [Applause] Praises so could you imagine those Brothers going straight and loosen in the court the man say wait wait wait when he said the Lord I need he said okay go ahead man you should be screaming you understand what happening there your healing coming your deliverance coming it's your Victory how many feeling loose [Applause] [Music] [Applause] already what watch all this about this was done watch watch this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of Zion behold I King cometh unto the meek sitting upon an ass and a CT and a fool of an ass watch and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them and brought the ass in the CT and they put in them clothes and let them sit there on now the thing about it all the time Jesus telling people don't say anything don't tell nobody don't announce anything anything amen you that's how Jesus was just keeping quiet and silent but this was different this was this was going to be a a ruction the whole Jerusalem this is going to affect everything because this was announcing a whole new turn of his ministry now this was going big public big time all the people came down to celebrate and so forth this was this was big this was really big and a very great mother you spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and stray them in the way cuz normally when the king come in you lay a carpet you live a robe you do something they were laying things so what kind of mad people is that oh my and the multitudes that went before them cried hosana to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana in the highest and when he was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved moved the whole message was moved everybody was moved who is who was moved and God is about to produce a move that going to shake a short quick message that going to shake the whole nation it's prophesy it's promise oh Hallelujah Glory when the city was coming to Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee and Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all of them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and said of them it is written brother PO he said it is written my father's house shall be called a house of prayer and you have made it a denes and the Blind and the lame came to him in the temple and healed them and when the chief priest and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple saying hosana of the son of David they were so displeased if you think people will to be pleased with signs wonders Miracles with the worship you were wrong wrong they were so displeased who was displeased religious people scripture bearing people book reading people tape listening people they would be pleased that's why you can't please man you have to please God you have to listen to the word coming from the mouth of God oh give the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Luke 4:14 and Jesus returning the power of the spirit in the Galilee amen they went out of Fame of him throughout all the regions round about and he taught in the synagogues being glorified of all came up to Nazareth where he had been brought up as it was his custom was he went in the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood forth to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and he found the place where it was written the spirit ah you see it now so he wasn't just living a flat life a flimsy life a shallow life he was living by the word he found the place not even the scripture being read was a random scripture it was a chosen scripture it's a scripture he found to effect a season change and time and purpose he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering into the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruise to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book he gave it to the minister sat down and all the eyes of them that were a synagogue were fasten on him and he began to say unto him this day is this scripture fulfilled hallelujah oh glory to God I wonder what you going to say I wonder what the bride going to say you waiting for healing so long but you're going to say this day the scripture is fulfilled I was reading about the prophet pray for a woman I think she had some stomach condition she couldn't eat and he prayed for her and she was so sick and for three weeks she going through pain and struggling and whatnot praise God and people mocking her and scuffing her because she was just believing God and trusting God and after a while she just felt to eat something she eat one thing she eat something else and afterward she recognized she was healed she run out praising God the prophet said the angel of God listen listen he said the word of healing what happened God said thus sayth the Lord you shall be healed and that's dust Lord is the word coming out from God when he dust here the Lord it can't fail for three weeks she is struggling she is looking like she is all sick and after three weeks you see the angel of the Lord pass by her neighborhood and fulfill what God had spoken three weeks before so don't you give up you pass through that prayer line last Sunday don't you doubt one moment praise God they shall lay hands on the sake and they shall be healed glory glory to God Amen Hallelujah praise God you believe that let's continue now in order to have faith faith have to have a basis you can't let Faith be loose and wild faith has to rest not upon the shifting SS of man's reasoning but faith is based on the solid rock of God's word so once you have the word the word becomes a platform to rest your faith on it's got to rest on something isn't that right that's why Jesus could rely on David's words that's why Dani Daniel all these prophets could rely on one another word because they know where the source is they know where it come from it came from the mouth of God so this word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word is is exciting to me it is thrilling to me to know we are called to live by the scripture itself I'm expecting this word to be activated in your spirit to be activated in your soul I expect you to connect with your scripture I expect you to have Victory from this day [Applause] forward so faith is based rest on God's word so Faith Can't float Faith have to rest I want to say faith can't float it have no floating faith it have to rest oh Hallelujah and something isn't that right and it must rest on the word so you need the word you need a word from the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God gyrus was a secret believer he couldn't confess he really believed the Messiah because they was going to kick him out the synagogue they was going to press him out from his special position in church and give him a backseat somewhere and small ify him that's not a word reduce him is not put pressure on him but gyrus you see God has forced the issue his daughter got so sick that gyrus couldn't be silent anymore private anymore or secret anymore he know the word was made flesh and it was alive and quickening with healing virtue power for service flowing freely out of the body of This Man Called Jesus so D Glory [Music] [Applause] you may be seated Jus are you going up I'm not sure I'm not sure that was not sure don't ask me not please don't ask me when when push come to shove he shove he run straight to Jesus and say Lord go to sick while he's yet speaking somebody say Jus don't bother with him a Savor all the embarrassment she's dead sick dead sick dead from sick sck to dead from bad to worse and that didn't remove Jesus sometime we things go from bad to worse and and you move and all emotion shaking up but Jesus he stood still he said go wake her come she's sleeping come come let's let's go let's go do

Holy Ghost surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophets now listen to this from loud and church age he said they have gotten away from the word they are lukew about it for seven out of Seven Ages I've seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mine so at the end of thise age I'm spewing you out of my mouth it is all over Revelation 10:7

come on now that proceeded out of my mouth [Applause] peace the Bible said in his hands have seven stars or seven Messengers seven spirits actually re reverse to one Spirit working out the will of God in different Generations so watch he is holding them amen it didn't say eight Stars 92 Stars 100 stars seven stars and a fivefold star it didn't say that it say Seven Stars not seven and a quarter not seven and a eight just seven because they are only Seven Ages so God just needs seven stars stars means it's night time stars mean they come to shine light in the time of Darkness that's when stars do come out because it's all dark so you need Stars has to shine to show us the light for the hour it shall be light in the evening time come on give the Lord some Praises people oh glory to God Hallelujah in his right hand you know what right away they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what the hand signifies it signifies the power of God the authority of God not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what Paul said it takes the authority of God and the power of the Holy Ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of God in the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost they all stood up to the world they were full of God they were sent or authorized by God not by self or other men so this is what man selling out man says God sending out man that's [Applause] different Jesus said here we go this is powerful you got to listen carefully Jesus said that when he went away he would send his Spirit which the world could not receive that is right the world's systems could not receive him that is what organization is it is a world system right show me a world system church that is full of the Holy Ghost I want to see it you will never see it he said if I can show you if you can show me such a church you are finding a Mystic in the word not one of these Messengers was organized either they were put out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization you hear about the sin of adultery and fornication all kind of sins but there's a sin called the sin of organization when men rule men and men dictate to men and men anoint themselves Crown themselves lay hands on themselves lay hands on others that's denomination that's organization that Spirit of man when man bring inspiration for the rest to say the same inspiration that is organizational stuff yes sir but these men were different they were hearing direct from God the word of God they brought the revelation of God as God gave it to them they spoke it out man shall live my bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God and God mouth was unfolded through Seven Ages so through Seven Ages he had seven men that would release a portion of his word to the age of that [Applause] time oh are you with me and this age he sent William Marian branam a 20th century Prophet as his mouthpiece to release to the entire age every mystery that was sealed from the foundation of the world oh give the Lord some Praises people are you with me Hallelujah and in Revelation 10 the mighty angel came with his book open every mystery revealed every mystery unfolded the book was open open it was sealed with Seven Seals no man could look at it no man could touch it but the lamb died and take the book and loose it on the earth and the prophet was there to catch it because the word of the Lord comes to a prophet the word of the Lord comes to a prophet the word of the Lord written voice word comes to a prophet it must be in the book it must be written that's why he said the seven tunders after a while you're going to find where it is written [Applause] you may be seated so Revelation 108 the voice said go to the angel with the book and eat it because you have to live by it man shall by bread alone but by every word of the open book so once the book is open you can eat it you can't eat the sealed book you have to eat the open book and once the Myster is revealed you can eat it because the secret things belong to God but the things that are revealed belongto us and to our children that we may do the whole works of the Lord so once it's revealed that's ours that's mes give me my Mountain come on now church are you getting it are you seeing it [Applause] so these men either they were put out got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization hallelujah how can the Holy Spirit possibly be in an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit and denomination take the place of the word remember organization is debt yes if the world takes over the spirit departs here we go yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the Seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the true church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had of of Pentecost by experience it is a Pentecostal Church there will be tongues interpretations prophecy healings God will be in the midst of her God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has and he will she will be unorganized don't forget that we have some more to say so sit at the edge of your seat and listen carefully now we see that Jesus Christ is revealing himself Through the Ages by his Spirit In The Messengers they are as Moses was to the children of Israel he had the Revelation for his day here we go so each messenger has God's revelation and Ministry for that day thus when we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the Lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power amen it is not enough that he has Associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was standing again among the seven Golden Lamb stands now it is even enough here we go there's a ton there's a bum hereall now is it enough that we see the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors for in each age the church goes astray but it is not just the lady but the clergy group that Bunch soal fold there he said the shepherds are wrong as well as the Sheep my God so when you hear a church go astray it's not just the bunch of lady going astray it's Shepherds and [Music] [Applause] sheep then God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd yes in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth oh give the Lord a praise offering Glory so religious men spiritual men pastors Evangel and whatnot the start of God in the word afterwards the backslide deteriorate and the form Church big steeple that's right s me and God send some men to bring the word Luther Wesley Columba all bring the word to them these men bringing light for the age isn't that right isn't something else Hallelujah seven churches is set forth if Ephesus pamus Titar Philadelphia he said he had an air come let him hear what the spirit is saying to the ages to the churches notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to one person relative to the word for that age here we go are you ready listen to this statement only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say for that age that's right one message receive all for the entire age all not some all one man in the Age receive all for the entire age so if the age stands strs 400 years what he says is to stand for 400 years because it's the word for the entire age one man a man sent from God a man in his right hand one of the Seven Stars one of the seven voices one of the seven messages one of the seven Messengers every single one had the entire revelation of God for the entire [Applause] age and in the last day every mystery revealed the book open God sent a 20th century Prophet with the entire revelation of the entire age oh can we give the Lord a worship do you see that now man shall not live my bre alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God now watch therefore any man coming after that Prophet can only be a echo of what the prophet said no man could bring a further Revelation a new revelation a stimulating Revelation no additional Revelation to what the prophet has brought because the prophet brought the [Applause] entire I feel like dancing when the spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart I'm going to dance like David [Applause] dance I say it again any man coming after the prophet could only be an echo can it be a eight messenger can it be another voice it's the same voice it is one voice let me bust it on you the spirit only have one voice the spirit only have one [Applause] voice and that what's me that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speak for God by Revelation to the churches amen both true and false the message is broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear and not getting their own private Revelation GL Hallelujah glory to God Amen take the ball out the park Hallelujah those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is the group getting their Collective Revelation each person is hearing what the messenger has already receive from God now give the Lord a big [Applause] shout Glory oh this is good this is good this is good you may be seated after 110 years somebody want to come and check out Noah's service to find out what's new Noah comes behind the pulpit and say my scripture for the day is it Will Rain my word for today is it will rain my subject today is it will rain my inspiration it's still going to rain I am prophesied from what God told me it's going to rain but now I heard you talk that 110 years before he said wait it has a more time coming but it's still going to rain you a't see it yet you a feel it yet it a interpret yet it's not fulfilled yet but it's coming because once it is spoken it's got to come to pass and the manifestation is the interpretation we don't know man to interpret what the prophet already interpreted for us we don't need no man's Spirit to be loosed among us we reject that we cast that out we challenge that we come against that one messenger for Revelation for the entire age behold I send you Elijah you shall live by the word Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you are going to live by the word [Applause] itself may be seated what word husband love your wife that's the word come on now come on now go hold back now wife respect your husband that's the word in other words you can't pick what you want and choose what you like listen to it again man shall not live by bread alone but by some words no no by every word that proceed out the mouth not man mouth man can say what he want and so men speaking in this last day oh Hallelujah listen to this think it not strange Paul set this pattern under the hand of God Paul alone had the full Revelation for his day as evidence he it by his confrontation to the other Les not Believers you know Paul was good he's Apostle Paul had nothing to do with that he smoked Peter out openly and pugly publicly yes sir holding back you know because Paul you see you see this is what I want I was talking to brother Anthony we going down I say what does loyalty means to you I begin to talk about

who are you worshiping if you're not worshiping God you're going to worship the Beast all that dwell on the Earth shall worship the Beast except those who names written in the Lamb's Book of Life so when you come to service you come to hear your name you come to bless God for your name your name is that Catholic your name is that Baptist your name is that bromite your name Ines that is not your name Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] do you understand that Satan went in God's Eden and mess things up do you understand God coming in Satan Eden to give him one last [Applause] kick I'm excited because the mouth of God already spoke words concerning this bride becoming a Super Church a super race as she kns The Headstone as she kns the headstone when you're far from The Headstone you are you come on now but as a draw near you are not you you you you come in more like him holl in his very image in his very likeness you come in just like him same Works same signs same power as you near the hstone oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory now watch in every age we have the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger here we go in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught so the messenger brings the light and from that light others draw to preach but of course here we go all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord what came the word of the Lord from you or came unto you only the they added here they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice here we go for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God even Paul said he couldn't change what he had said he said if we or an angel come down from heaven and preach any other thing let him be a curse [Applause] Paul said I can't change what came out from the mouth of God do not hear what I'm saying when God spoke to his mouth he can't change it this is real you are going to be [Applause] delivered Glory listen to this Hallelujah he that he that has an Al here with the spirit in the church in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you a Christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word for this age every Messenger to every age will preach the word every fresh here we go are you ready every fresh and true revelation will be because men have gotten back to the word for their ageu The Cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of God repent come back to the word from the first book in the Bible Genesis to the last book Revelation there's only one reason for God displeasure that is leaving the word oh blessed be the name of the Lord he said these men he said they they were denounced by by organization now it is not hard to stand up and keep true to a Creed it is easy for the Devil is right behind all of that but it's something else to stay with the true word oh praise God could you we I'm going to hit the home stretch now let's look at uh Jeremiah chap 23 you don't have to find it but if you want to read with me I want to read some scripture to show you God's thinking God's thoughts God mind concerning pastors concerning sheep let's look at Jeremiah chapter 23 we read woe be unto the pastors wow is that real I thought all pastors are lovely men saints of God men of the cloth and God say woe unto the men of the cloth pastors that destroy scatter the Sheep of my pastor say the Lord therefore thus sayth the Lord God of Israel against the pastor that Feed My People ye have scattered my flock driven them away have not visited them behold I will visit upon you the evil of your doing sayeth the Lord and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries where I have driven them and will bring them into their fs and they shall be fruitful and increase I will set up Shepherds over them that would feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking sayeth the Lord behold the days come sayth the Lord that I will raise up David A righteous branch and the King shall reign and prosper shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth in his day Judah shall be saved and right and Israel shall dwell in safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness therefore behold the days come sayeth the Lord they shall no more say the Lord liveth which brought up the children of Israel of the land of Egypt but the Lord liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the House of Israel out of the North country from all countries where I have driven them and they shall dwell in their own land my heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones Shake I'm like a drunken man like a man whose wine have overcome because the Lord because of the Lord and because the words of his Holiness for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mournet the pleasant place of the Wilderness are dried up their course is evil and their force is not right for both prophet and priest are profane Y in my house are found their wickedness sayith the Lord wherefore their way shall be unto them a slippery ways of Darkness they shall be driven on and and fall therein for I will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation this what people don't know sayeth the Lord and I have seen the Folly in the prophets of Samaria prophets now they prophesy in Baal and caused My People Israel to ear I have seen the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing the commit adultery walking lies listen they strengthen the hands of the evildoers that none return from his wickedness the all of them unto me are Sodom and of the inhabitants of Gomorrah therefore th sayth the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold I will feed them with wormwood and make them drink water of G for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profanes gone forth all the land thus sayth the Lord of hosts listen here we go ha not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord they say they say still unto them that despise me watch the Lord said he shall have peace and they say unto everyone that walketh in the imagin of Their Own Heart no evil shall come upon you for who had stood in the councel of the Lord and perceived and heard his word who had marked his word and heard it Behold a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in Fury even a grievous Whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon upon the head of the wicked the anger of the Lord shall not return until he have executed till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter days he shall considered perfectly I have not sent these prophets yet they ran I have not spoken to them yet they prophesied but if they had stood in my counsel and had cause my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from the evil ways and from evil doings am I a god at hand say the Lord or a god a far off can any hide himself in secret places and I shall not see him sayth the Lord do I not fill Heaven and Earth sayeth the Lord I have heard that what the prophet said that prophesy lies in my name I have dreamed I have dreamed how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets the prophesy lies yay they are prophets of Deceit of their own heart which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which it tell every man to his neighbor as their fathers have forgotten my name for Beal the prophet that had a dream let him tell a dream he that at my word let him speak my word Faithfully what is chaff to the wheat sayth the Lord is not my word like a fire say the Lord I like a hammer that break the Rock in pieces therefore behold I am against the prophets sayth the Lord that steal my words everyone from his neighbor behold I'm against the prophets sayth the Lord that use their tongues and said he SA yet behold I'm against them that prophesy false dreams sayeth the Lord and do tell them and cause my people to ear by their lies and by their likeness yet I sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all sayeth the Lord may God bless his word I read that to you to let you know how God sees things is not as man sees it is as God sees it we need to get back to the word from the mouth of God because when God speaks it's got to come to pass isn't that right I'm about to close Hallelujah I want to ask you something B I'm saying Jo witness is loyal to what they believe the Baptist is loyal to what they believe why can't we be loyal to the word amen to the word I want to ask you something you say well brother brandham how do you know they are not now if those Pharisees and Sadducees and leaders of that day musician come please that would have got away from their Creeds and their dogmas and listen to what the word said what Jesus was telling them just exactly but listen to this part they Tau so much of their leaders they wasn't bad men they wouldn't lie steal cuss anything like that they wouldn't do that they wouldn't commit adultery certainly not they would witness why they were good men but the only thing there wasn't spiritual men oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah I'm closing a momentary consideration of the church history would prove go God sent the word in Luther's day Luther spoke for God at that time they organized again pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creed they not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley he was the voice with the word in that day the people who took his Revelation from God became living Epistles rather known of all men for their generation when the Methodist fail God rais up others so it has gone on through the years until again there's another people in the land who under them messenger that same one Messenger will be the final voice to the final age here we go are you ready yeah the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it it his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God and look as I close Samuel old Eli rather old priest isn't that right Samuel a young man the priest so old in the message at that time he couldn't have the ability to hear from God so God find this young man Samuel begin to speak to him because Samuel and his sons were doing evil in sight of God and so on isn't that right and he said now the work has being done he said and today one reason that the church is in the condition it's in is because there are so many voices so many voices to attract the church from the voice of God so it's very doubtful that many would even hear the voice of God though it spoke right in the midst they perhaps wouldn't even understand it there are so many voices on the Earth today that is absolutely a hard thing because it deadened the voice of the supernatural oh my there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual and in that intellectual condition they even Shake Nations they are not overnight persons but they Shake Nations and it'll bring confusion and so forth and their voices raise up and it causes The Voice voice of God to be placed somewhere with the true from the true voice of God and the voice of God they say how will we noce the voice of God because today it was in the Vindicated Prophet now today how do we know it's the voice of God are we ready am because it's a manifestation of the prophet's word this is God's prophet and a true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural god with his Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word that's the voice of God may the Lord richly bless you oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Jesus Hallelujah glory to God Amen let's all stand and worship as brother Steve Will Come Oh Glory to God and
