[14:55] being here we appreciate all of you who
[14:57] choose to join us tonight we pray that
[15:00] the holy spirit will speak to your heart
[15:02] you need to hear from God the Bible is
[15:07] not a regular text the Bible is not a
[15:10] novel it's not a you have non-fiction
[15:12] and fiction there's none of that the
[15:15] Bible is God's word and he could look
[15:18] over his own word to make sure his word
[15:21] is gued and he will bring us with to
[15:24] pass he doesn't try to ask us to
[15:26] manufacture anything he want us to
[15:28] believe what he says and act upon what
[15:31] he says so tonight I have something upon
[15:34] my heart and that thought that I have
[15:36] upon my heart is as many as I love as
[15:40] many as I love and this is brother
[15:43] Brandon he is praying heavenly father as
[15:47] we are so enjoyed this fine Fellowship
[15:50] singing how would Trill my heart when I
[15:53] heard that song they done see me father
[15:57] I trust that we be all dear each one of
[16:00] us and we are bowed now towards the dust
[16:03] we pray that you receive our
[16:07] Thanksgiving and our
[16:10] repentance and our prayer for each other
[16:16] look out at his
[16:17] place receive our
[16:19] Thanksgiving and our repentance and our
[16:23] prayer for each other so tonight this
[16:27] night is along the line of
[16:31] repentance now he says now the reason
[16:34] that the Holy Spirit today would rebuke
[16:37] and tear down the church as me a love
[16:41] rebuke thank God for rebuking a real
[16:44] father to straighten us up and get us
[16:47] out whether the scripture is here just
[16:50] let's obey it now in this age Hebrew 12
[16:54] chapter says if they cannot stand
[16:56] chastisement if they cannot stand won't
[16:58] take rebuke him they're illegitimate and
[17:00] not sons of God a man blow up H I ain't
[17:05] going to listen to that anymore go right
[17:07] ahead illegitimate but a real child of
[17:11] God will take his correction saying yes
[17:14] Father it's your word I've got to
[17:17] straighten up now I've got to do what is
[17:21] right and you know you would see over
[17:25] the years months you keep hearing us
[17:27] talking about people that they are
[17:29] entitled and they are wrong with that
[17:33] entitlement they are wrong with that
[17:35] entitlement because every son that come
[17:37] to God will be
[17:39] chastised and will be
[17:41] corrected butam
[17:43] say uh he so he he had an experience he
[17:48] went to this restaurant we familiar with
[17:50] it just want to just reflect back over
[17:51] it and he was a woman was there with all
[17:55] kind of crazy clothes and everything
[17:57] else and and and and and World music
[17:59] playing and he begin to say Lord how
[18:02] long will you stand this evil and this
[18:03] sin and how long God how can you stand
[18:07] it he said look over to my right I heard
[18:09] someone make out a big grown and there
[18:12] sat an age woman probably 60 years 70
[18:15] years she had on those old Fula clothes
[18:18] and I was thinking I said God why don't
[18:21] you destroy the whole thing why don't
[18:24] you just sink it Ben the earth I said is
[18:26] my little Sarah and Rebecca going to
[18:27] have to grow up on such stuff like that
[18:30] and God in your great Holiness ever
[18:32] stand to look on a thing like that and
[18:34] not send an earthquake and sink it as I
[18:36] was standing dear condemning the woman
[18:38] as I was I stepped back behind the door
[18:41] and I felt the spirit of God come to me
[18:44] and I stepped behind the door I seemed
[18:47] like something whiring and when it was
[18:49] in the vision it was the world turning
[18:52] WR and around and I noticed around the
[18:54] world was a Scarlet streak around the
[18:57] world and as I got to the world I see
[19:00] myself just a little boy doing things
[19:03] that I ought not to do maybe not like
[19:06] ego was sin but every time I did
[19:08] anything I seen that great black shadow
[19:11] gr towards heaven and God would have
[19:14] kill me at that minute and I see
[19:17] standing between me and God stood that
[19:19] perfect sacrifice I seen him standing
[19:22] dear with the torns on his head spit
[19:24] hanging on his face and every time my
[19:27] sins would start towards God he would
[19:30] reach out and catch it like a bumper on
[19:33] the car he was protecting me from Death
[19:36] so the wages of sin is Deb and this
[19:40] experience where was sharing that every
[19:44] sin was like a black shadow going to God
[19:48] and Jesus his blood was like a bumper on
[19:51] the car he was protecting me from De and
[19:54] every time I would do anything wrong
[19:58] we can underline anything wrong God
[20:02] would have killed me certainly his
[20:05] Holiness requires it his laws requires
[20:08] it and every time I would do anything or
[20:11] you do anything the blood of Jesus
[20:14] Christ acts like a bumper when I see
[20:18] that Scarlet Street meant that then the
[20:20] blood still holds the Earth
[20:24] question now what this shows is is that
[20:28] you could do a whole lot of crap because
[20:31] you're under a
[20:33] covering covering of the blood you see
[20:37] so it's your choice if you're going to
[20:40] recognize that your body is the Temple
[20:43] of the Holy Ghost and God wants you to
[20:46] keep your temple clean and
[20:49] holy but when I have I wrote this down
[20:53] here but when the cup of iniquity is
[20:55] filled up then God takes action so B
[21:01] says here now as I looked looking I got
[21:04] a little closer to him I notice him he
[21:08] would hear me say father forgive him he
[21:12] doesn't know what he's doing and I look
[21:14] down and there laid a book and there was
[21:16] recording Angel standing by side and
[21:19] every time I sinned it was put down in
[21:22] the book my name was on it and I
[21:26] realized that someday that blood streak
[21:29] would be lifted and I would have to
[21:32] stand in the presence of God with my
[21:34] sinful life but I seen by his Mercy he
[21:39] was holding off my
[21:41] judgment so I went to him humbly I knelt
[21:44] on my knees so all he see the vision I
[21:48] said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am
[21:51] unworthy to
[21:53] come in your presence will you please
[21:57] forgive me for what I have
[21:59] done
[22:01] question are you going to do that
[22:03] tonight to ask God for forgiveness for
[22:07] your personal sins he touched his side
[22:12] with his hand took it the old book and
[22:15] wrote pardon showed it back behind him
[22:19] and my sins were gone then he looked me
[22:22] s in the face on the light St s in the
[22:26] face he said no
[22:29] I have forgiven you but you want to give
[22:32] them
[22:33] her then I
[22:35] seen what it meant as I come out of the
[22:39] vision I walk over to her I said how do
[22:41] you do she was
[22:43] drinking she looked up at me said hello
[22:47] and he begin to speak to her he said
[22:49] lady just a few minutes ago standing Y
[22:52] and I begin to tell her as I begin to
[22:54] look the tears begin to drop down from
[22:56] her cheeks she told told me I said lady
[22:59] you don't mean to do these things Jesus
[23:01] died and the judgments of God is held
[23:04] off by his blood you don't mean to do
[23:06] this she said no sir my father was a
[23:09] deacon in the church I was raised in a
[23:10] Christian home my husband and I were
[23:13] ched members I live a Christian Life she
[23:15] began to tell me after his death she had
[23:17] two young girls she went astray all the
[23:19] girls had left her she had thrown her
[23:22] life away and she thought there was no
[23:23] more hope for her I said God be merciful
[23:26] those who for he has called
[23:28] she said are you Reverend bam she said I
[23:31] am he said I'm ashamed of myself to be
[23:34] sitting here like this do you think
[23:36] there will be a chance to me I said
[23:38] Jesus has his arm stretched out waiting
[23:40] for you to come lady and the other
[23:42] people begin to take up I said would you
[23:44] walk out here on this floor with me she
[23:46] said I will sir I took her by the hand I
[23:48] said you about the age of my mother
[23:50] would you kneel here with me on the
[23:51] floor and dear in the floor we broke up
[23:55] that place that afternoon to a
[23:56] oldfashioned meeting
[23:58] and God saved that woman by his grace
[24:02] she dressed herself come to the meeting
[24:05] as far as I know living a Christian Life
[24:07] tonight and this is what he said us what
[24:10] is it God requires
[24:15] Perfection he requires your
[24:19] repentance he requires your loyalty to
[24:23] him no matter how much you have sinned
[24:25] how little how much you are still a
[24:28] sinner let me repeat that no matter how
[24:31] much you have sinned little or much you
[24:34] are still a
[24:36] sinner and cannot get in no other way
[24:41] but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient
[24:45] sacrifice and in him you are perfected
[24:49] forever think of it it is nothing you do
[24:54] it is not turning new pages you turn it
[24:58] is not a new life you start here we go
[25:02] Saints it's a confession of your wrong
[25:06] and God's grace to you that brings you
[25:09] to Perfection and then you are perfected
[25:12] in Jesus Christ it is what it's a
[25:16] confession of your wrong and God's grace
[25:19] to you that brings you to Perfection and
[25:24] then you're perfected in Jesus Christ so
[25:27] listen to this now in the beginning was
[25:29] the word wood was with God the wood was
[25:32] God the wood became flesh and he was the
[25:36] pillar of fire once then he come was
[25:38] made flesh now he comes in your flesh
[25:41] what is he doing God
[25:44] condescending trying to draw near to his
[25:48] people so he can be loved and
[25:51] worship we in the louan age turned him
[25:54] on the outside he's knocking trying to
[25:56] get back in
[25:58] and here we are that is God our father
[26:03] in the form of the Holy Ghost trying to
[26:07] get back into our lives to control us so
[26:12] we know
[26:13] assuredly that God will not force us God
[26:17] will not hold our hands and hold our
[26:20] hearts and force us to
[26:23] repent Force us to make things right
[26:27] Force us to cleanse ourselves like the
[26:29] Bible talk about having therefore these
[26:30] promises let us cleanse ourselves from
[26:33] all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit
[26:36] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[26:39] vessels of Honor if we mortify the Deeds
[26:42] on our body and cleanse ourselves we
[26:44] become vessels of Honor that is your
[26:47] choice that is my choice that is our
[26:49] choice that the word could have the
[26:53] pinenes something but U struck in the
[26:57] the last message Sunday passed where
[27:00] Deuteronomy 8:1 he said and thou shalt
[27:03] remember all the way in which the Lord
[27:07] thy God LED thee these 40 years in the
[27:10] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[27:15] thee to know what was in thine heart
[27:18] whether thou would keep his commandment
[27:20] or no so the only way God could see
[27:24] what's in our hearts is to pass us the
[27:27] way of the Wilderness the way of the
[27:30] Wilderness or hardship or trials or
[27:33] testings however you want to present it
[27:35] it's a way in which God really punctures
[27:38] to see what's inside of them and it's
[27:41] only when the tests come and the Trials
[27:43] come it reveals who we are what is
[27:47] inside is what will come out let's see
[27:50] if we can wrap it up again that is God
[27:53] our F in the form of the Holy Ghost
[27:57] trying to get back into our lives to
[28:00] control us he's got to have a church I
[28:03] said last night that Capstone come on
[28:07] it's got to come on they perfect and the
[28:10] church has got to draw into Perfection
[28:13] you say perfection that's what he said
[28:16] be therefore perfect as your father in
[28:18] Heaven is imperfect
[28:21] it okay let's
[28:25] go revelation 31819 I conciously buy of
[28:28] me gold TR and the fire thou th be rich
[28:31] why rment that thou may be closed and
[28:34] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[28:37] and KN and eyes with i that down may see
[28:40] as many as I love I reuk and chasen be
[28:42] zealous therefore repent and the brother
[28:45] R says this here the counsel of God is
[28:49] thirst it is to the point and that word
[28:52] thirst there means abrupt short brief
[28:56] Gruff
[28:58] condensed clipped
[29:02] blunt God's counsel you will never see a
[29:06] wasted word everything is condensed it
[29:10] is blunt it is clipped it is short it is
[29:14] AB brough it is brief it is thirst and
[29:18] bah said to himself it is to the point
[29:21] he directs his lasted Church to one hope
[29:24] that hope is himself he says come to me
[29:27] and by it is evidence from the phrase by
[29:30] of me that the Lan Church age is not at
[29:34] all dealing with Jesus or spiritual
[29:36] products of the kingdom of God their
[29:38] transactions cannot be spiritual they
[29:41] may think that they are spiritual but
[29:43] how can they be let's look at the word
[29:46] buy buy is the pay a price if we are to
[29:50] have a Revival and we know a revivalist
[29:52] promise but the Revival have a cost byy
[29:56] mean a price when the wise verions told
[30:00] the foolish versions go to them that
[30:03] sell it simply meant go and pay the
[30:06] price it meant that the wise virgin PID
[30:10] the price to have extra the foolish
[30:13] virgins was content just to have enough
[30:16] the wise virgin saw the need to have
[30:20] extra so he said the works in their
[30:22] midst are definitely not as Paul would
[30:24] say God in you willing doing his own
[30:28] pleasure thus these churches okay I skip
[30:31] that by me go try the fire you may be
[30:33] rich now these people had plenty of gold
[30:36] but it was the wrong kind it was the
[30:38] gold that bought men's lives and
[30:40] destroyed them it was the gold that wed
[30:43] and twisted human character for his love
[30:46] was the root of all evil which is money
[30:49] and Money Changes people they get tight
[30:52] they get selfish they get mean it
[30:55] changes people watch I'm going to skip
[30:58] down this now and wrap up here all right
[31:02] but he's talking about Babylon for
[31:05] habitation of devils Revelation 18 and
[31:08] the kings of the earth who have
[31:09] committed fornication and live
[31:10] deliciously with her and then he said
[31:12] alas alas the great City Babylon that
[31:15] Mighty City for in one hour is thy
[31:17] judgment
[31:18] come this is this is powerful here now
[31:22] and the merchants of the Earth shall
[31:23] weep and mourn over her for no man buy
[31:26] it the merchandise any more and the's
[31:28] eyes of gold and silver and precious
[31:30] stones and pearls and fine and purple
[31:33] silk and Scarlet all thine wood and all
[31:35] manner vessels of ivory all manner
[31:37] vessels precious stones brass iron
[31:39] marble cinnamon orders ointments
[31:42] frankincense wine oil fine flow wheat
[31:46] Beast sheep horses chariots slaves and
[31:49] Souls of men and the fruit of thy Soul
[31:53] lusted after I departed from thee and
[31:56] all things which were dainty and godly
[31:58] departed from thee Thou shalt find them
[32:01] no more in other words Babylon being
[32:03] judged now these words this is
[32:07] exactly the organized churches of the
[32:10] last day for it says in verse four come
[32:13] out of her my people and he put here
[32:17] right after that the Rapture has not yet
[32:21] taken
[32:22] place so we going to see a lot of stuff
[32:25] happening and the Rapture has not yet
[32:29] taken place he said the bride is not yet
[32:33] gone here we go when these terrible
[32:38] conditions in this Rich false Church
[32:42] exist there is a goal and that goal is 1
[32:46] Peter 1:7 that the child of your faith
[32:49] being more precious than that of gold
[32:51] that perisheth the gold of God is a
[32:55] Christlike character
[32:57] produced in the fiery furnace of
[33:00] Affliction that is where I can of go why
[33:03] am I saying all this tonight
[33:06] Saints you have to toughen
[33:09] up we have to toughen up we have to
[33:12] become strong Bible believing
[33:16] Christians strong word
[33:19] Christians this is the only way out you
[33:23] have to be able to disconnect from what
[33:25] you feel what you think your emotions
[33:29] how you want it to be and come to the
[33:32] place where all you want to know is what
[33:33] God Said and you could simply say God
[33:37] said so I give a little testimony
[33:40] considering how I got on the flight and
[33:43] I had to repent because I recognize then
[33:45] we have to trust God more because how it
[33:48] unfold to me was like a miracle living
[33:51] right in front of me and I've seen so
[33:53] many of these things that all I can know
[33:56] it is the hand of God
[33:57] and I'm sure in your life there
[34:00] experiences and stuff that you could
[34:03] testify of it was the mighty hand of God
[34:07] let me say close here watch
[34:10] this the goal of God is a chis character
[34:13] produced how by Mysteries by teachings
[34:16] by reation in the fiery fullness of
[34:19] Affliction that is the right kind of go
[34:22] what kind of goal does the church have
[34:23] today it has World goal that will perish
[34:27] it is Rich listen to this it is
[34:31] complacent it has made affluence the
[34:35] major Criterion of spirituality and he's
[34:37] talking about AFF by what car you have
[34:39] what house you have and everything else
[34:40] right he said you better come before
[34:42] it's too late buy of me gold triing the
[34:45] far and then you'll be truly Rich are we
[34:47] getting it listen to me naked physically
[34:51] we came into the world but naked
[34:54] spiritually we will not leave it oh no
[34:57] we are going to take something with us
[35:00] what that something is all we can take
[35:03] with us nothing less nothing more so we
[35:06] better be careful now to see we take
[35:09] something that will make us right before
[35:11] God so then what will we take with us we
[35:15] will take our our character that is what
[35:18] we will take with us what kind of
[35:20] character will you take with you whether
[35:22] it be his whose character was molded by
[35:25] suffering in the fire fullness of
[35:27] Affliction or will it be we go the
[35:30] softness of this characterless loudes
[35:34] and people it is up to each one of us
[35:38] for in that day every man shall bear his
[35:42] own burden almost
[35:44] done as many as I love har you can Chas
[35:47] him this is the same message that John
[35:51] had when he was dealing with the
[35:53] Pharisees and sades he said repent there
[35:56] was no other cause then there is no
[35:58] other C now there was no other way to
[36:01] get back to God then there's no other
[36:04] way now it is
[36:07] repent
[36:08] change your
[36:10] mind turn
[36:13] around
[36:14] repent what you're doing now that is
[36:17] contrary to God and His word stop it
[36:20] stop it tonight repent tonight let us he
[36:25] said he said it is to repent change your
[36:28] mind turn around repent for why will you
[36:33] die let us examine the first phrase as
[36:37] many as I love in the Greek the emphasis
[36:41] is upon the personal pron I he does not
[36:45] say as many would feel he should say as
[36:47] many as love me no sir we must never try
[36:50] to make Jesus the object of human love
[36:53] in this earth no it is the many that are
[36:57] the loved ones of God it is his love in
[37:01] question not ours so once again we find
[37:05] ourselves glorying his salvation his
[37:09] purpose his plan and we are confirmed
[37:13] even more strongly in the truth of the
[37:15] doctrine of the sovereignity of God even
[37:18] as he said in Romans 9:13 Jacob has I
[37:22] loved does it now obtain that since he
[37:25] only loved many he therefore in the
[37:27] state of complacency awaiting the love
[37:29] of those who have not drawn n him by no
[37:32] means he declared in Romans 9:13 Esau
[37:34] have I hated and in verse 11 the spirit
[37:37] boldly calls out for the children not
[37:41] being born neither having done any good
[37:43] or evil that the purpose of God
[37:47] according to election might stand not of
[37:50] works but of him that call it this love
[37:54] is elective love it is his love for his
[37:57] elect and his love for them is aart from
[38:01] Human Merit let me repeat that again his
[38:03] love for them is apart from Human Merit
[38:07] for it says that the purpose of God
[38:09] stands in election which is exactly
[38:11] opposite to works or anything man has
[38:14] done thems because before the children
[38:16] were born you already said Jacob have I
[38:18] loved es so have I Heen now he says to
[38:23] his
[38:24] own as many as I love so when you see
[38:28] sisters can't take correction brothers
[38:30] can't take correction people Gruff and
[38:33] like a frog eting toad eting bushot and
[38:35] caring with a bunch of foolishness you
[38:37] know that is this is not what God
[38:39] talking about here as many as I love I
[38:43] rebuked and chasen if you are not being
[38:46] rebuked by the Spirit rebuked by the
[38:48] word or being searched by the spirit you
[38:51] have to check yourself and see what is
[38:53] going on because this goes to his
[38:57] elective bride as many as I love I
[39:01] rebuke and Chas him and as I finish
[39:04] listen to this to rebuke is to reprove
[39:08] to reprove is to expose with a view to
[39:12] correction in other words God wants us
[39:16] to be on the right track exposing sin
[39:20] exposing your behavior exposing your
[39:22] attitude is a view to get you corrected
[39:26] chasen does not mean to punish it means
[39:30] to discipline because the subject's
[39:34] amendment is in mind just like a father
[39:37] or a parent not the kind of how should I
[39:40] say delinquent parents we have now no
[39:43] the real parents will discipline their
[39:45] children because they want them to be on
[39:47] the right track and then he says this
[39:50] this is exactly what Hebrews 12 says and
[39:53] you have forgotten the exaltation which
[39:55] speaketh unto you as children
[39:57] my son despise not the chasing of the
[39:59] Lord nor faint when thou rebuked of him
[40:02] for whom the Lord loveth love it
[40:05] underline love that he Chast it and
[40:07] scorge every son whom he receive and if
[40:10] you endure underline endure endure
[40:13] chastening God dealth with you as with
[40:16] sons for what son is he whom the father
[40:18] chasteneth not and if we be much be
[40:21] without chastisement wherefore all are
[40:23] partakers then we are bastards in that
[40:25] sense furthermore we have had fathers of
[40:28] our flesh who which corrected us and we
[40:31] give them reverence shall we not more
[40:34] rather be subjection unto the father of
[40:36] spirits and live for they verily for a
[40:39] few days chasen us after their own
[40:41] pleasure but he for our Prophet that we
[40:44] might partakers of his Holiness now no
[40:47] chastening for the present seem it to be
[40:48] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[40:51] afterwards that yielded the Peaceable
[40:54] fruit of righteousness unto them that
[40:56] are exercised thereby herein is now set
[41:00] forth the love of God he desired in love
[41:04] a family of his own a family of sons
[41:07] like himself therefore before him lies
[41:12] all mankind as one lump of clay out of
[41:17] that same lump he will now make vessels
[41:20] unto honor and onto this honor the
[41:23] choosing will be his own choosing then
[41:26] those chosen ones born of his spirit
[41:29] will be trained listen to these words
[41:33] now will be trained to conform to His
[41:37] Image in their
[41:39] walk he reproves we talking about the
[41:42] chosen one now he reproves with all
[41:46] longsuffering and gentleness and mercy
[41:49] he chases with nail scar hand sometimes
[41:54] this Potter must take the vessel he is
[41:57] working on and thoroughly break it down
[42:01] in order that he may rebuild it exactly
[42:04] as he desires it but it is love that is
[42:08] his love another way of his love there
[42:10] is not there cannot be oh little flock
[42:14] do not fear the ages fast closing and as
[42:18] it does those Tails will be bound
[42:20] together and as a three-fold cord is not
[42:22] easily broken they will have tremendous
[42:25] three-fold strength of
[42:27] political physical spiritual satanical
[42:31] power they will seek to destroy the
[42:33] bride of Christ here this one she will
[42:37] suffer but she will
[42:39] endure Oh I thought the Rapture coming
[42:42] and oh I'll Fly Away Oh Glory not yet
[42:45] not yet not yet they will seek to
[42:49] destroy the bride who is the day the
[42:53] political the physical and the spirit
[42:56] spiritual satanical power they will seek
[42:59] to destroy the bride of Christ she will
[43:03] suffer but she will endure fear not
[43:06] those things that are coming upon the
[43:08] Earth for he who love his own love them
[43:10] unto the
[43:12] end be zealous therefore and
[43:14] repent now when people think they're
[43:16] right they repented for nothing God is
[43:18] with me liar God is not you're cursing
[43:22] and you're smoking and you're fooling
[43:24] around and you're fornicating and you're
[43:25] living on clean God is not with you what
[43:28] is happening there because of the
[43:30] covering of the blood nothing happened
[43:34] yet I always say this message have not
[43:37] seen God's judgment but that's
[43:39] read be therefore repent I say now watch
[43:45] he's talking about they supporting their
[43:47] own Creed and dogmas in the message
[43:49] talking about message we talking
[43:50] Pentecostal and baptism they have put
[43:53] the word out for their own ideas you
[43:56] hear me many times saying people
[43:58] preaching their own message and
[43:59] sprinkling it like like ketchup or Salah
[44:01] dressing of the message upon their own
[44:04] sermon and their own invention right now
[44:06] watch they have put out their own ideas
[44:10] they have deposed the Holy Ghost and
[44:13] make men into leaders and make men into
[44:17] leaders they have put aside eternal life
[44:19] as a person and make it good works good
[44:22] works but God is calling for another
[44:25] Zeal this is where we
[44:26] it is a Zeal to cry I am wrong now who
[44:31] is going to say that he's wrong there
[44:33] are so many people once you start to
[44:34] talk to them they put up their defenses
[44:37] sometime they find I like how you talk
[44:39] to me how you supposed to talk to
[44:42] you sofy nicey God is
[44:47] thirst sometime God get angry and if God
[44:50] take a man and begin to use that man you
[44:53] would see the anger of God through that
[44:54] man he would see the fear you would see
[44:57] so much different things because God is
[44:59] a living being he not in the human
[45:01] emotions he's not in the feelings and
[45:03] feel feel feel as you feel like God love
[45:06] is is Parental love that is not the love
[45:08] he has he has elective love he could
[45:10] send you through this through that
[45:11] through that we don't want to fail him
[45:15] he has done so much for us chose us
[45:18] called us elected us and the least we
[45:21] could do is give our life over to him so
[45:24] I'm going to close right here
[45:27] God is calling for another
[45:28] Zeal it is a Zeal to cry I'm wrong now
[45:32] who is going to say he is
[45:36] wrong who's going to
[45:40] say let me say this here I don't believe
[45:43] that God is calling only to the false
[45:45] Church to repent in this verse he is
[45:49] talking to his elect so I'm not talking
[45:52] a fraudulent message tonight I'm not
[45:54] sharing you something oh gosh
[45:57] intellectual gymnastics you're not going
[46:00] there this verse he is talking to his
[46:05] elect they have some repenting to do
[46:08] many of his children are still in those
[46:11] churches they are those whom he speaks
[46:14] to in Ephesians 5:14 awake thou that
[46:16] sleepest arise from the dead and Christ
[46:19] shall give the light to be asleep is not
[46:22] to be dead they are sleeping amongst the
[46:24] dead they are there in dead denomination
[46:27] they are floating along with them God
[46:30] Christ wake up repent of your Folly here
[46:34] they are lending their influence giving
[46:36] their time and their money actually
[46:39] their very lives to these Antichrist
[46:42] organizations in the message I would say
[46:45] they need to have a change of mind and
[46:48] turn towards truth yes this is the age
[46:51] that most needs to repent but will it
[46:54] will it bring back the word
[46:56] will it again enr the holy spirit in
[46:59] men's life will it again rever Jesus as
[47:02] the only savior I say not because Jesus
[47:06] said I stand and un knock let's bow our
[47:08] heads Heavenly Father this was just upon
[47:11] me tonight to share with your people as
[47:14] many as I love oh God you hate sin you
[47:18] want them out of sin you don't want them
[47:21] continuing in sin you want them to
[47:24] repent and come completely out of sin

[47:29] Spirit of crying out of mourning of
