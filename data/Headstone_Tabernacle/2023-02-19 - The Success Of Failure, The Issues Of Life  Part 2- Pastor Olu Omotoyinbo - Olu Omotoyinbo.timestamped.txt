[50:18] already and I pray for me I am tired I
[50:21] am tired so but I'll try to
[50:25] um
[50:26] I'll try to to not act tired so so you
[50:30] don't
[50:31] attire too so brother said you see a
[50:36] church the pastor makes his head this
[50:37] way the old church makes the head this
[50:39] way so so I'm even sorry I said I'm
[50:41] tired but so don't act tired so
[50:44] act the opposite so you know you're sure
[50:47] like he's not the pastor's spirit that
[50:48] controls you but the spirit of the Lord
[50:50] Jesus Christ
[50:51] amen so anyway this morning I want to
[50:54] not finish but go on with a thought in
[50:57] the series of um
[51:00] our series on the success of failure and
[51:04] um I know sometimes it might be tough
[51:06] for you to put it all together from
[51:07] where we're coming from but outrun
[51:10] do that for you but even if you take the
[51:12] messages as silos on their own I think
[51:14] you will still find some benefit in them
[51:17] but last Sunday I'm speaking to you
[51:20] about you know the the how the Bible
[51:23] says where
[51:25] um
[51:26] we're faithfully and wonderfully made
[51:28] and trying to show you
[51:31] um I'm not sure you
[51:34] spoke about how the way we are we're
[51:37] like a human computer like the the
[51:40] computer is very very
[51:42] um well known by everybody these days
[51:44] and even your phone in your hand is a is
[51:47] a power
[51:49] Powerhouse of a computer in your hand so
[51:51] and the thing with every computer has
[51:54] like a hard drive which is where you
[51:56] keep all the things and you keep them
[51:58] there like you know memories on the hard
[52:01] drive and when you need them you bring
[52:03] them out you you type in whatever and
[52:06] you bring them out so you program your
[52:08] computer to do those things you the
[52:10] program you see like what program is
[52:13] running your computer and so because
[52:15] we're human beings a human computer too
[52:17] we also have programs that run us
[52:19] and the programs that Runners have been
[52:23] put there by God in the beginning at the
[52:25] original in Eden I mean at the creation
[52:28] of man God programmed us in a way that
[52:31] we will have a phenomenal hugely
[52:34] successful life like Adam did before he
[52:36] fell by sin Eden So Adam was a
[52:39] Powerhouse of a computer and you saw
[52:41] what he did you saw how he lived you saw
[52:45] the impact that he had on this Earth
[52:48] here as a matter of fact this world has
[52:50] different governments they're trying to
[52:52] do an election soon people are voting
[52:54] and you know different governments you
[52:56] can imagine one man who had control over
[52:58] the whole earth over the whole over the
[53:01] whole earth I mean many can even hardly
[53:04] run their homes run their lives let them
[53:07] run their homes but this was the man
[53:09] running the wall so you can imagine the
[53:10] power and the glory that was and um so
[53:15] the same God that made him that that's
[53:18] the same God that made us and the way he
[53:20] created him very same way he created us
[53:23] and so at the original in the beginning
[53:25] Adam was a Powerhouse and God programmed
[53:28] him and that program ran him that
[53:31] program lived out of him and like the
[53:34] Bible says Genesis 2 7 Man became a
[53:37] living Soul Man was programmed and run
[53:41] by the program in his soul and that's
[53:43] what he was able to live by but then you
[53:46] know the story when Adam fell by sin
[53:50] another program came in because the
[53:53] program that God put in there was like
[53:55] disconnected and switched over to
[53:59] another program a negative programming
[54:01] from the Devil
[54:03] his nature his spirit and that's how you
[54:06] have the programming of the two Natures
[54:08] in us and science proves these things
[54:12] science proves this thing science even
[54:14] tells you at any particular point in
[54:16] time
[54:17] your face is right or wrong and it's the
[54:22] HD are programming that has uh the the
[54:26] the that that is stronger in the moment
[54:29] that's what you you you actually carry
[54:33] out and that's what brother that's what
[54:36] the Bible says two dogs in US
[54:39] the white dog black dog the dog that you
[54:43] feed the most is the one that wins amen
[54:46] two Natures in us the nature of Good and
[54:48] Evil two Natures in US God's nature and
[54:52] human nature human nature we just give
[54:54] it like a a good covering it's the
[54:57] devil's nature
[54:58] in every human being and you remember
[55:00] God's nature is part by the spirit of
[55:03] love and the devil's nature is powered
[55:05] by the spirit of fear you remember that
[55:07] all right so so I think we are doing uh
[55:11] pretty good so so last Sunday
[55:14] went further to say that everything that
[55:17] happens in my life and in your life just
[55:20] when we establish how we um let me keep
[55:22] it up on my channel here so
[55:24] um yeah I'm standing so late already so
[55:26] um
[55:27] okay so everything that happens in our
[55:29] lives everything even into the womb
[55:33] proof they can do uh uh um what they
[55:38] call you like um
[55:40] hypnotize you to where you will is is
[55:43] that why he touches them
[55:46] what do I say
[55:49] even therapy even though that's an
[55:51] advanced word I want the one that
[55:53] everybody can understand
[55:54] but is is that's what he's saying
[55:57] hypnotherapy he said hypnotherapy all
[55:59] right so but there's a more common word
[56:03] hypnotism he notices him that they can
[56:05] take you into your mother's womb and you
[56:06] you'll see you talk how you crawl I mean
[56:09] you you are you are like is it is it
[56:12] crawl
[56:13] are you were carved in your mother's
[56:15] womb you see all that they take you
[56:17] right in there because you record it
[56:18] somewhere he's got it somewhere so
[56:22] um
[56:24] um I'm so when we come in the world that
[56:27] recording goes on still and like we said
[56:30] last night that's how God can judge
[56:31] because the books were open what were
[56:33] those books the books were open
[56:36] billions and billions and billions of
[56:38] books are open
[56:39] so
[56:41] you and I are a living human computer
[56:45] recording everything every day I won't
[56:48] get you today but I'll show you why
[56:51] because is that recordings that
[56:53] recording is recorded as the issues in
[56:56] your life and just like ever and they
[57:00] they they they they are they they go in
[57:03] there and most of it programs you the
[57:07] way you live your life that's why many
[57:10] times you were doing things it's not the
[57:12] immediate surroundings that's in
[57:14] controlling what you do
[57:15] no it's not it is not at all this is
[57:18] science
[57:19] these signs
[57:21] [Music]
[57:23] is like your computer only brings out
[57:26] what is programmed on the inside of it
[57:28] nothing else
[57:30] no matter how much you wish
[57:33] it's you must be programmed in the
[57:35] computer you must change the programming
[57:36] to bring out what you want if it's not
[57:39] giving you what you want
[57:42] same way same way our programming on the
[57:45] inside is what comes out
[57:48] that's why it says God your heart
[57:50] because these issues is what controls
[57:52] your life
[57:54] so you might find yourself doing things
[57:56] and Paul said it
[57:58] all wretched man that I am who shall
[58:02] send me from this evil what I would I
[58:05] would not we won't admit it like Paul
[58:07] did but that's the story of Our Lives
[58:10] what we want to do we just don't find
[58:13] the pottery something else is
[58:15] overpowering us a programming on the
[58:18] inside amen
[58:21] so something else has to change that
[58:26] programming on the inside your computer
[58:27] if it has a virus on the inside of it
[58:30] because what the devil put there is the
[58:32] virus
[58:33] that totally changed the programming if
[58:37] your community has a virus no matter how
[58:39] much you wish the virus to go out it
[58:41] will not go out you have got to go in
[58:44] there get an antivirus to to flush out
[58:47] the virus so your computer can start
[58:49] working again properly when you want to
[58:51] bring out your file it brings out it
[58:54] doesn't bring out something else when
[58:55] you want to be something else out but
[58:57] that's what we are that's what the
[58:59] programming the devil put in their sin
[59:02] program doesn't wrongly and we bring out
[59:06] what we don't want to bring out what I
[59:08] would
[59:09] I would not but that thing that I don't
[59:13] want to do Paul said that's what I find
[59:15] myself doing
[59:17] how many times you want to answer very
[59:21] softly you find yourself reaction
[59:22] [Music]
[59:24] and you speak to yourself like how did I
[59:27] do that but the same devil says that
[59:29] don't apologize okay if you apologize do
[59:32] you think you are weak they think they
[59:34] are right and you are wrong it happens I
[59:36] mean can you can can can you relate
[59:41] foreign
[59:42] [Music]
[59:51] I'm just going to take you back to you
[59:53] where we started from
[59:55] because
[59:57] um
[59:57] so lastly we've shown you that most of
[1:00:01] the things that the memories that are
[1:00:04] saved in US
[1:00:06] they're shipped as memories I mean the
[1:00:08] things that have noticed I see those
[1:00:09] memories and that's why God's going to
[1:00:11] be with the judge
[1:00:12] and I said 10 of those things are saved
[1:00:16] in our conscious memory which relates to
[1:00:19] your human mind your brain
[1:00:24] which is spread by your human spirit
[1:00:27] 10 of that what you ate yesterday what
[1:00:30] you had the day before your birthday
[1:00:32] your schoolmate whatever and things like
[1:00:34] that and we can call up that memory at
[1:00:36] will we can call off at will that's
[1:00:38] conscious memory
[1:00:40] that's only ten percent that's the like
[1:00:43] I said that's the tip of the eyes back
[1:00:44] tip of the eyes back but beneath the
[1:00:47] iceberg me in the tip you know that's
[1:00:49] where the most of the iceberg is you
[1:00:52] know that don't you all right
[1:00:55] so
[1:00:56] beneath that tip of the iceberg is the
[1:01:00] 90 percent of the things that have
[1:01:02] happened in our lives
[1:01:04] and that is hidden away in our hearts
[1:01:08] not an atomical heart but a spiritual
[1:01:11] heart
[1:01:13] which is where I received Jesus into my
[1:01:17] heart it's not your anatomical heart
[1:01:19] it's your spiritual heart I love you
[1:01:22] with all my heart it's not your
[1:01:24] anatomical heart it's your spiritual
[1:01:26] heart
[1:01:28] and that's where those memories are kept
[1:01:30] away from where you can bring them up or
[1:01:33] or whatever and that memory is totally
[1:01:36] connected with what the doctors I mean
[1:01:39] the scientists call your sympathetic
[1:01:41] nervous system for example when you eat
[1:01:45] you're not conscious of what's going on
[1:01:47] elsewhere you know your body is removed
[1:01:49] even when you sleep your body is walking
[1:01:52] it's outside of your control
[1:01:56] that's connected to the person on the
[1:01:59] inside who is controlling everything on
[1:02:02] the inside of you so this outside is
[1:02:04] just a shell
[1:02:06] just a shell the real person is on the
[1:02:09] inside talk The Way Way deep on the
[1:02:14] inside that's who the Bible says God
[1:02:17] your heart
[1:02:20] with all diligence
[1:02:22] for out of it come the issues
[1:02:26] of Life those issues are
[1:02:29] these memories
[1:02:31] none of them have been grounding to you
[1:02:33] and they control your life
[1:02:36] country your life
[1:02:39] why do you think brother Branham would
[1:02:40] always get on the prayer line and we'll
[1:02:42] talk with people
[1:02:43] and said I'm trying to catch their
[1:02:45] spirit
[1:02:47] why do you think Jesus Took the man of
[1:02:49] the well and but the Vietnam told us
[1:02:51] that he was only trying to catch her
[1:02:52] spirit
[1:02:54] because in her spirit is where the
[1:02:58] record is rebound will say like that
[1:03:00] woman will never know before and he said
[1:03:02] I'm trying to catch your spirit
[1:03:05] he's trying to read her life
[1:03:07] because that's where it's recorded
[1:03:09] that's why I recorded and said oh I can
[1:03:11] see you you just had an operation I see
[1:03:13] the doctor a short man another because
[1:03:16] he's recorded
[1:03:19] spirit is the soul the soul of man
[1:03:21] that's when you recorded
[1:03:23] [Music]
[1:03:25] those are some of the books that's going
[1:03:26] to be opened you know the record of your
[1:03:29] life is going to be open
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:32] that's why the Book of Life
[1:03:35] The Book of Life
[1:03:37] there's a record of every problem tell
[1:03:40] us that there's a record of every action
[1:03:43] that you take on doing the face of the
[1:03:45] Earth here
[1:03:46] did you tell us that come on give me a
[1:03:48] witness prayer
[1:03:49] said every action you take ever
[1:03:53] every recorded did he tell us that
[1:03:56] every single action every single thought
[1:03:59] every he said every action not every
[1:04:01] action when you're awake every action
[1:04:03] right from your mother's womb is
[1:04:05] recorded there's a record of it
[1:04:10] and every man is judged out of that
[1:04:13] record that's the Book of Life
[1:04:15] but there is another book
[1:04:20] which is called the book of
[1:04:22] his life that's the lamps Book of Life
[1:04:26] the book of the Lamb's life in there and
[1:04:30] when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:33] and he baptize your soul with fire he
[1:04:37] transfers your record
[1:04:39] from The Book of Life into his book of
[1:04:43] his own life
[1:04:44] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:46] Hallelujah and when you and that's when
[1:04:49] you will not come to the judgment
[1:04:52] but you apart from Death unto life
[1:04:54] because the Book of Life spreads death
[1:04:57] but the book of his life spreads eternal
[1:04:59] life and glory and Hallelujah Glory
[1:05:03] Hallelujah you may be seated
[1:05:05] praise the Lord
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:13] and that's why he challenges you like if
[1:05:16] you if you say you have a gift of you're
[1:05:19] a dreamer
[1:05:22] because many of the messages are running
[1:05:24] around these days to all these you know
[1:05:26] signs wonders and all them things like
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:29] and because they're looking for
[1:05:30] something else
[1:05:31] they just run from church to church
[1:05:33] you're either here or you're there
[1:05:37] if you're here stay here
[1:05:39] but if this is not satisfying to you
[1:05:42] if I was you I would go to where I will
[1:05:44] find satisfaction but this is the land
[1:05:47] of the Prophet a prophet has been in the
[1:05:49] land
[1:05:50] and he taught us how to live
[1:05:53] he just had to leave l-i-v-e
[1:05:57] it turned out to be in the church you
[1:05:59] can't be in the church today and
[1:06:00] tomorrow you are back back and forth I
[1:06:02] know you cannot be
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:10] because
[1:06:12] brother banham taught us how to live
[1:06:16] this life
[1:06:19] and this his message is an invitation
[1:06:23] to leave the life of Jesus Christ it's
[1:06:27] as simple as that
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:29] she has a seven Thunder believing Church
[1:06:33] and believes that the seven Thunders are
[1:06:35] the seven voices of the seven Church
[1:06:38] ages as a manifestation of God God
[1:06:41] manifesting his Spirit through seven
[1:06:43] Church ages is not just the Seven
[1:06:46] Virtues it's the man is the mystery of
[1:06:50] the Seven Virtues the mystery of Faith
[1:06:53] how Paul will go all the way back down
[1:06:57] to Genesis right back into the man of
[1:06:59] God and bring out all the Mysteries
[1:07:02] that's the mystery of faith and the
[1:07:04] Mystery of virtue and all the way down
[1:07:06] that's what this church believes
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:13] [Applause]
[1:07:16] and added to that he taught us
[1:07:21] when you are called out from the world
[1:07:23] and find yourself a church that's what
[1:07:26] I'm saying find yourself a Bible
[1:07:28] believing Church find yourself some
[1:07:30] church where you trust the pastor the
[1:07:32] mission that church that they can feed
[1:07:34] your souls and Lead You Back to Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ because
[1:07:38] the angel at the pulpit his job is only
[1:07:42] to lead to the angel of the Lord that's
[1:07:43] all his job is out so the man has no
[1:07:46] business preaching himself preaching his
[1:07:48] views he has to preach what the angel of
[1:07:50] the Lord wants because that's the only
[1:07:52] thing that will lead you back to the
[1:07:53] angel of the Lord can you say Amen
[1:07:59] Hallelujah
[1:08:03] telling you all about my greatness tell
[1:08:05] you a lot about me and all that who do
[1:08:08] nothing is this world revealed by the
[1:08:11] prophet of Malachi 4 that will drive you
[1:08:14] back to the angel of the Lord
[1:08:16] hallelujah how we thank God for that
[1:08:19] great Elijah prophet of Malachi 4. Glory
[1:08:25] that great Elijah Prophet oh Hallelujah
[1:08:30] Amen in the days of the voice of the
[1:08:32] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:08:33] sound the mystery of God shall be
[1:08:36] finished Hallelujah the mystery of God
[1:08:39] who God Is His Pain his nature how he
[1:08:43] lives how he moves how he behaves
[1:08:46] himself we learn these things on our
[1:08:48] Prophet God Elijah Prophet it's no
[1:08:51] secret will follow him
[1:08:53] is no secret will follow him Hallelujah
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:09:03] amen you maybe see that
[1:09:05] you maybe see that
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:19] and that Professor is when you come in
[1:09:21] the world when you come in the message
[1:09:23] it's not church church
[1:09:26] Visions as usual Church to go learn how
[1:09:30] to
[1:09:30] you know
[1:09:34] do whatever dress
[1:09:37] do your business or whatever
[1:09:39] church is much more than that
[1:09:41] there's much more it's not even about
[1:09:43] how to be of good behavior it's much
[1:09:45] more than that
[1:09:46] you come in the church the only reason
[1:09:49] why you are in this church or any church
[1:09:50] at all is you come to be trained if you
[1:09:54] don't understand anything about the
[1:09:55] message understand that your comfort
[1:09:57] training
[1:09:59] and it's not just been trained what is
[1:10:01] the content of that training what's the
[1:10:05] purpose of that training when you're
[1:10:07] going to medical school or law school
[1:10:09] there's a purpose in that training the
[1:10:13] purpose is to get to become a doctor the
[1:10:16] purpose that change you become a lawyer
[1:10:18] engineer or whatever it is what's the
[1:10:20] purpose of his training in the house of
[1:10:22] God what's the purpose of this training
[1:10:24] in the message of the hour what's the
[1:10:26] purpose that you might be like Jesus
[1:10:28] Christ his very own Spirit the Holy
[1:10:31] Spirit itself vibrating through your
[1:10:34] mortal body and adopted bread of Jesus
[1:10:37] Christ
[1:10:38] oh Hallelujah that's the goal that's the
[1:10:41] purpose that's what we're headed for
[1:10:43] don't you ever forget that don't you
[1:10:46] forget that the seven fondness amen
[1:10:50] that's what they are and that's what
[1:10:52] this church stands for
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:05] me
[1:11:07] because if you don't understand that
[1:11:10] you'll come in and you are just doing
[1:11:13] Church
[1:11:14] just playing church just trying to be
[1:11:17] nice trying to be nicer than the other
[1:11:19] person that's just gonna be nice tell
[1:11:21] them to see I'm nice those are nature
[1:11:23] given virtues
[1:11:26] I showed you that already
[1:11:29] in every man
[1:11:31] the word of God is written
[1:11:34] no God created Man In His Image every
[1:11:37] man his image
[1:11:40] what's the image of God
[1:11:43] love
[1:11:46] joy peace what's the image of God faith
[1:11:50] virtue in all the temperance what's the
[1:11:51] image of God
[1:11:53] but the devil came and provided that
[1:11:56] and that's why he said
[1:11:58] feel your love that we have is a
[1:12:00] profession
[1:12:03] oh my
[1:12:05] God you maybe see that
[1:12:11] so anyway
[1:12:14] temperature not just to know how to be
[1:12:16] nice and be good and all that the people
[1:12:18] who you just push your niceness forward
[1:12:22] I'm nice that's not the purpose here
[1:12:25] our NASA is like filthy reacts
[1:12:29] feel the reacts
[1:12:33] we come here to be like Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] nothing being nice we want to have his
[1:12:38] Spirit his life amen flesh of his flesh
[1:12:41] born of his bones that's our purpose
[1:12:44] that's our goal that's the brightest
[1:12:46] Earthly goal it comes from the inside of
[1:12:50] us and we will not stop until we get
[1:12:52] there and we are gonna get there because
[1:12:55] the bread is predestinated to get there
[1:12:57] she will get there whether you and I get
[1:13:01] there that's our problem not God's
[1:13:03] because God has a bride predestinated
[1:13:06] and she is going to get there
[1:13:11] Hallelujah
[1:13:13] [Applause]
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:21] so I said that's that's so I said
[1:13:24] that's why I said when you have a dream
[1:13:26] if I have a dream I say oh you say oh
[1:13:28] you're interpreting my dream some dreams
[1:13:30] are very clear just know what God is
[1:13:31] telling you
[1:13:32] but when you need to interpret the dream
[1:13:34] for me you have got to see that dream
[1:13:37] first
[1:13:38] why because it's it's written somewhere
[1:13:43] in my subconscious so that means you you
[1:13:46] God's got gift in you has got to be able
[1:13:48] to let you see contact my spirit where
[1:13:51] they dream is at it's not just find the
[1:13:53] air no God God has records
[1:13:56] record of life he has the Bible says the
[1:13:58] books were open and there's a book on
[1:14:00] the inside of your recording every
[1:14:01] action and so if you want to see it you
[1:14:03] go and read the book and see that oh
[1:14:05] yeah
[1:14:06] yeah
[1:14:08] even
[1:14:10] Pharaoh's dreams
[1:14:12] he forgot the dreams
[1:14:17] and what's his name
[1:14:21] Joseph
[1:14:23] um put them with their dad
[1:14:26] let me see what that Dad is that Mom
[1:14:27] there okay okay sorry I'm sorry I didn't
[1:14:29] know that I apologize
[1:14:32] so pharaoh
[1:14:35] even forgot his dream and Joseph went
[1:14:38] and saw the dream
[1:14:40] where is she from
[1:14:41] same way like Malachi 4 will contact the
[1:14:44] spirit
[1:14:45] and she's like oh I can see you
[1:14:47] like when you were five years old
[1:14:49] you are a servant in the Roman Catholic
[1:14:51] church and you stole something in the
[1:14:53] church and that's what is affecting you
[1:14:56] right now where do you see from
[1:14:58] from the record
[1:15:01] so to to be a truly dreadly interpret
[1:15:04] dreams he taught us if you are in some
[1:15:06] Pentecostal church that's different but
[1:15:08] if you're in this land of the prophet he
[1:15:10] said the way you interpret dreams that
[1:15:12] you go to see the dream again
[1:15:15] and even elements of the dream that I
[1:15:17] forget you will see it
[1:15:21] and you say this day and say that's when
[1:15:22] I know it's a gift from God
[1:15:24] that's why I know it's a gift from God
[1:15:25] can you say Amen
[1:15:28] oh really God Amen
[1:15:32] this is the land of Malachi for the
[1:15:34] prophet
[1:15:35] of course if you don't believe it I have
[1:15:37] no problems with you
[1:15:39] if what you have satisfied you no
[1:15:41] problem but this is the land of the
[1:15:43] Prophet so you can't mix this and match
[1:15:45] you can't mix this with someone else
[1:15:47] it's not gonna work
[1:15:48] make up your mind
[1:15:50] if I'll make up your mind but I'm
[1:15:53] inviting to come with us
[1:15:54] come with us we will do you good
[1:15:57] not God we will do you good for the Lord
[1:16:01] has spoken good considering this gospel
[1:16:05] this this Gospel of Malachi first
[1:16:07] message
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:12] amen you may be seated
[1:16:17] so you have powerful working computer
[1:16:20] you're powerful
[1:16:22] you are powerful everything loaded the
[1:16:25] program is loaded
[1:16:26] not today but I'll show you how you'll
[1:16:29] bring out those issues and what they do
[1:16:32] to your life
[1:16:33] but we'll we'll maybe study today
[1:16:38] all of your life
[1:16:40] is controlled by the issues of your life
[1:16:43] it's not nobody no nobody is controlling
[1:16:45] you or nobody is you're my issue it's
[1:16:47] not true
[1:16:49] if you say it's true the Bible says not
[1:16:51] true and I choose to believe the Bible I
[1:16:53] don't agree with your experience the
[1:16:55] devil came and told if this is that
[1:16:58] if
[1:17:00] didn't argue with her
[1:17:03] what she should have done would have
[1:17:04] been to just give him what God Said
[1:17:06] I cannot get your experience I Saw Mommy
[1:17:08] water is your experience I cannot argue
[1:17:10] with it but I don't believe it
[1:17:12] I don't see it in the Bible even though
[1:17:14] I really sorry
[1:17:16] my intervention you were having
[1:17:18] hallucinations
[1:17:20] and then you saw something that isn't
[1:17:22] real but I really saw it I don't doubt
[1:17:25] you or whatever
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:28] I was almost saying something I don't
[1:17:30] want you know anybody thinking I'm
[1:17:31] picking on them so I don't uh
[1:17:33] no no I won't say it no I won't say it I
[1:17:38] won't say
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:43] so anyway
[1:17:46] we have these issues the memories loaded
[1:17:50] on the inside of us and some you can
[1:17:52] pick up because then your brain many of
[1:17:54] them you can't pick up
[1:17:56] but when things happen like I said
[1:17:58] before when you
[1:18:02] I speak harshly to you
[1:18:05] and you respond to me immediately then
[1:18:07] you are responding to what I just told
[1:18:09] you but science says if I speak Ashley
[1:18:11] to you or do anything at all to you or
[1:18:14] anything at all that you see here
[1:18:15] whatever every word whatever everything
[1:18:18] whatever if you don't respond within one
[1:18:21] second
[1:18:22] it's not that immediate circumstance
[1:18:24] that that that that
[1:18:26] that's causing your reaction your
[1:18:29] reaction is from a deeper place on the
[1:18:31] internet from the issues of life on the
[1:18:33] inside of you
[1:18:34] did you hear that let me let me say let
[1:18:37] me say it again let me say it again let
[1:18:38] me say it again
[1:18:40] you see you really hurt me
[1:18:43] I said when said last year
[1:18:46] or even yesterday
[1:18:52] and because of that I did this no it's
[1:18:53] not it's not
[1:18:56] science is if you don't react to the
[1:18:59] stimulus within one second it's not the
[1:19:02] immediate environment that is
[1:19:04] responding for your actions it's not
[1:19:07] science is that
[1:19:09] it's something else deeper on the inside
[1:19:12] of you that's going for your actions
[1:19:14] because what happens when things happen
[1:19:16] to you
[1:19:19] your mind goes searching are getting a
[1:19:23] bit in some detail later but I just
[1:19:25] wanted to drop that as I go on go
[1:19:27] searching for a similar event most
[1:19:31] especially when you first came across
[1:19:33] that particular event or a similar event
[1:19:35] and the way you acted at that time
[1:19:40] programmed in you already as an issue of
[1:19:43] your life is what it reacts
[1:19:46] and you swear forgive the word that it's
[1:19:49] what I did or somebody that is making
[1:19:51] you react known
[1:19:53] it's the issue that's reacting
[1:19:57] that's why it said don't react
[1:20:00] choose your response
[1:20:04] how many years of our children are in
[1:20:05] this church here choose your response
[1:20:07] because when you choose your response
[1:20:09] you are overriding what the issue is
[1:20:11] trying to tell you that that instinctive
[1:20:14] thing the issue is trying to do you are
[1:20:16] deciding in your conscious mind this is
[1:20:18] how I'm going to handle this not the
[1:20:20] issue controlling how your life is
[1:20:23] I say guard your heart from all with all
[1:20:26] diligence for how to become
[1:20:28] all the issues of life
[1:20:30] so last Sunday
[1:20:32] we
[1:20:33] brought it down to where
[1:20:36] in every man's head
[1:20:38] there is faith
[1:20:40] and there's doubt
[1:20:42] everyone said he said one sense in the
[1:20:46] soul
[1:20:46] but I told you I read your quotes that
[1:20:49] actually two but only one
[1:20:52] as they say so over you at any
[1:20:54] particular point in time
[1:20:56] faith and doubt two dogs white dog black
[1:21:01] dog and the one that has the sex so the
[1:21:04] upper hand is the one that acts you
[1:21:05] can't do both at the same time and like
[1:21:07] I showed you before Love Is On One
[1:21:09] extreme fear is on the Other Extreme and
[1:21:12] the one that they cannot coexist
[1:21:13] together
[1:21:15] you don't coexist together
[1:21:17] is one or the other
[1:21:19] is it 51 over 49 is it 51 percent that
[1:21:22] will
[1:21:23] control you for that particular moment
[1:21:26] that's why people do things wrong a man
[1:21:30] living in adultery a woman a boy a girl
[1:21:33] in fornication and all these wrong
[1:21:35] things every wrong thing that we do
[1:21:37] as a parent you know as a husband being
[1:21:40] mean to your wife why didn't do this
[1:21:42] your husband as a as a son being mean to
[1:21:45] your your dad mom to your brother on the
[1:21:49] job your support is on the job I say
[1:21:51] whatever it is
[1:21:53] however it is that you whatever it is
[1:21:55] that you do that's wrong
[1:21:58] is all controlled by issues that come
[1:22:01] from our hearts
[1:22:07] Faith or doubt a man coming in adultery
[1:22:10] in that moment in time let the man be
[1:22:12] the worst man on the face of that he
[1:22:14] knows that I should not be doing this
[1:22:17] I should not be doing this I'm running
[1:22:19] ahead of myself
[1:22:24] but maybe let me let me just say because
[1:22:25] I mean I may not get to it I should not
[1:22:28] be doing this I should not be doing this
[1:22:30] but then you go into what we call in
[1:22:33] terms of rationalize going to
[1:22:34] rationalize
[1:22:37] because everything that we do
[1:22:39] everything we always do what we believe
[1:22:42] when that man does that and like the I
[1:22:45] said this in church years ago
[1:22:47] when man does that is and he says like
[1:22:50] he has to talk to his wife and confess
[1:22:52] his sin and whatever and things like
[1:22:54] that I mean I use the same example
[1:22:55] exactly years ago 2015 2016 thereabouts
[1:22:58] because I've said some of these things
[1:22:59] even at that time
[1:23:01] and he has to say like that is future
[1:23:04] but um I didn't mean to do it I'm sorry
[1:23:06] I'm sorry I will never happen again
[1:23:09] but
[1:23:10] all sounds so good
[1:23:12] but you know what it's not true like
[1:23:15] nothing to do it it's not true
[1:23:18] it's not true
[1:23:20] because of our programming
[1:23:22] we always do what we want to do
[1:23:28] we call our programming we always do
[1:23:31] what we believe
[1:23:37] there's no action we take that doesn't
[1:23:40] have an internal goal none known
[1:23:44] I wake up in the morning I go to take my
[1:23:46] bath what's the purpose what's the goals
[1:23:49] that I'm I I'm I'm aiming at I want to
[1:23:52] start my day that's the goal I want to
[1:23:55] come to church on Sunday morning that's
[1:23:56] what took me out of bed and made me go
[1:23:58] to the bathroom and change my clothes
[1:24:00] and head to church there's no action we
[1:24:03] take doesn't have an internal goal
[1:24:05] behind it
[1:24:06] and behind every internal goal there's a
[1:24:09] belief
[1:24:11] what you call Faith or belief
[1:24:15] that drives the internet goes on the
[1:24:17] inside of you that drives your life so
[1:24:20] there's nothing you do but what you
[1:24:23] believe we always live out and act out
[1:24:26] what we believe nothing in the universe
[1:24:30] in creation can make us do what we
[1:24:32] didn't want to do
[1:24:34] unless we just are possessed of an evil
[1:24:37] spirit
[1:24:38] we own it we did it even though we say
[1:24:41] like Paul oh Richard man that I am who
[1:24:43] shall deliver me from the body of Jesus
[1:24:45] boy it took it took our ownership
[1:24:49] he said what I would I would not that
[1:24:52] which I don't want to do that's what I
[1:24:53] do he did it he did it himself
[1:24:56] and we do it ourselves nobody knows
[1:24:58] circumstance not that Mom boss nobody we
[1:25:02] did it
[1:25:03] that man come in adultery he did not
[1:25:05] eating I didn't mean to do no he meant
[1:25:07] to do it because whatever we do at any
[1:25:09] point in time
[1:25:11] is fired by a belief on the inside of us
[1:25:13] I'll I'll break it down for you I'll
[1:25:16] bring them for that I say I'm
[1:25:17] getting ahead of myself
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:20] it's always felt but I believe on the
[1:25:22] inside
[1:25:23] a belief that says this thing is good
[1:25:25] for me at the moment
[1:25:28] if I lose my temper because I know even
[1:25:32] though somebody said that I don't lose
[1:25:33] your temper but they lose your temper
[1:25:35] takes the upper hand because I believe
[1:25:37] it's good for me as a woman it's good
[1:25:39] for me to let my mind be known let me
[1:25:40] let my mind be let me say what I feel
[1:25:42] even though something said no no don't
[1:25:44] do that because I believe it's good for
[1:25:46] me for the moment so we always live by
[1:25:48] what we believe that's why your belief
[1:25:51] is Major what you believe is Major
[1:25:54] that's why faith is Major
[1:25:57] how it was not really scripture maybe
[1:25:58] every next Sunday by the grace of God he
[1:26:00] said we live we walk by faith
[1:26:04] we walk by faith
[1:26:07] every man walks by faith every man walks
[1:26:10] by faith you are thinking the faith of
[1:26:12] the word of God no Every Man Has faith
[1:26:14] belief
[1:26:15] the unbeliever goes to work the
[1:26:17] unbeliever creates things the unbeliever
[1:26:19] invents things it's fired by a belief on
[1:26:22] the inside of them we call it Faith they
[1:26:24] call it belief but it's more than the
[1:26:25] same thing
[1:26:28] we live and walk by faith not by sight
[1:26:33] and that's why because mankind lives by
[1:26:35] these principles of the Bible That's why
[1:26:37] God's going to judge them because they
[1:26:39] can live by those principles and apply
[1:26:40] to the word of God and the relationship
[1:26:42] with God With God almighty
[1:26:46] but sometimes the way we present the
[1:26:47] gospel it's almost like it's only it's
[1:26:50] only meant for inside the church you
[1:26:51] know the gospel the Bible is meant for a
[1:26:54] man to live on the face of Israel live
[1:26:56] on faith he walks within the church he
[1:26:59] walks outside the church he works in the
[1:27:00] home he works in a Marketplace he walks
[1:27:03] in the laundry he walks in the he walks
[1:27:04] everywhere
[1:27:06] works everywhere when you get that
[1:27:08] understanding your shoulders will go
[1:27:10] back you won't feel inferior because you
[1:27:12] are a Christian you have access to what
[1:27:15] is greater than Harvard School of
[1:27:16] Management or business you have access
[1:27:18] to the mind of almighty God guiding you
[1:27:21] how to live your life and control your
[1:27:24] life on the face of Israel here amen
[1:27:27] amen can you say amen I know you don't
[1:27:30] believe it but for the two percent my
[1:27:32] two percent is who I'm talking to amen
[1:27:35] come on my two percent come on two
[1:27:37] percent that's who I'm talking to
[1:27:39] foreign
[1:27:46] amen Glory Hallelujah
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:55] so we brought it down to Faith and doubt
[1:27:58] in every man said every man lives by his
[1:28:00] belief oh
[1:28:02] The Atheist goes to work in the morning
[1:28:04] tell his wife I'll see you at night
[1:28:05] what's that
[1:28:07] belief he just believes he'll be back
[1:28:09] home at night when you go to bed at
[1:28:11] night every man goes to bed at night
[1:28:13] usually I'll see you tomorrow morning
[1:28:15] what is that belief that's how he lives
[1:28:17] if that man lies against us am I going
[1:28:20] to wake up he will die before morning
[1:28:22] let him do that repeatedly every night
[1:28:24] before you know like that they just seem
[1:28:26] dead in his bed but you don't even think
[1:28:28] of it because that belief and faith
[1:28:35] and Faith Can you say Amen
[1:28:37] are you experiencing everybody
[1:28:39] experiences
[1:28:41] amen
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:45] because the same devil talks to you
[1:28:47] talks to them same devil talk to you
[1:28:50] if thou be the son of God
[1:28:54] John the Baptist that says Behold the
[1:28:56] Lamb of God that takes the distance of
[1:28:58] the world he came and said and thou he
[1:28:59] that should come and we'll do it for
[1:29:01] another
[1:29:02] we all get attacked by it
[1:29:05] faith and doubt faith and doubt but when
[1:29:08] God created marriage there was no doubt
[1:29:10] in the picture and you know how doubt
[1:29:11] came in the Garden of Eden at the fall
[1:29:14] that's why we're getting this child to
[1:29:16] the age of accountability getting that
[1:29:19] child to the place and see how God so
[1:29:20] prepared him but what happened to him
[1:29:23] what happened to him
[1:29:26] Glory

[1:29:36] human Communists that we are we live
[1:29:39] from a place of depth on the inside of
[1:29:41] us from our programming

[1:30:10] even be harboring
[1:30:11] complexes from your father your

[1:31:37] girl had some hot temper and brother
[1:31:39] Branham said no they shouldn't get
[1:31:40] married until she gets the Holy Ghost so
[1:31:42] the Holyfield can go and deal with these
[1:31:44] issues in her heart or shall I might not
[1:31:46] be a stress because he said
[1:31:50] is like that the anger thing that she
[1:31:53] has is coming from her
[1:31:55] High lineage
[1:31:57] let me find that quote coming from my
[1:32:00] lineage

[1:32:30] all right
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:43] so the programming excuse me can I open
[1:32:45] my jacket please okay
[1:32:47] yeah I have some bosses here they always
[1:32:49] tell me what to do
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:51] because they have some boys they don't
[1:32:53] want to be my boss so so I got a new

[1:33:05] all right
[1:33:06] so
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:11] to really and completely fully
[1:33:13] appreciate how these issues get formed
[1:33:17] how we have received because the issues
[1:33:19] are positive and negative just positive
[1:33:21] negative
[1:33:23] we need to go back to the beginning
[1:33:25] which we've done before but just to
[1:33:26] refresh your mind again
[1:33:28] and where we receive a love positive
[1:33:32] issues programming and well received
[1:33:34] Affair negative issues programming
[1:33:37] we'll go back to begin in Eden but up
[1:33:39] front let me tell you that uh
[1:33:44] in each of the cases in each of the
[1:33:46] cases words have a lot to do with the
[1:33:50] programming
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:34:09] thank you honey all right
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:15] oh where was I
[1:34:18] I'll go where I watch watch so so so I
[1:34:21] want you to be very careful to follow
[1:34:23] our thinking okay for that thinking
[1:34:25] because life is very very simple
[1:34:29] I'm not saying it's easy but it's very
[1:34:31] simple and I always say we complicate
[1:34:33] and over complicate the simple because
[1:34:36] the more complicated it is the more we
[1:34:37] feel
[1:34:38] module
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:44] he wants to make your pregnancy more
[1:34:46] complex than
[1:34:48] it is so you can get
[1:34:50] more money yeah
[1:34:54] yeah and that's just who we are we
[1:34:56] complicate simple things life is very
[1:34:58] simple your God made it so
[1:35:01] in very very simple say my yoke is easy
[1:35:04] I'm born is light easy should be easier
[1:35:07] than the other the other the other side
[1:35:09] so words words have a lot to do with it
[1:35:13] wasn't a lot to do with it now
[1:35:16] in Genesis 1 22 28
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:32] if I forget to read the quote remind me
[1:35:34] because you remind me okay I don't want
[1:35:36] to miss my thoughts so let me just keep
[1:35:38] it for now
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:45] all right um
[1:35:48] oh yeah in Genesis 1 26 28
[1:35:52] I explained you before when goes to
[1:35:55] engage 26 126 let us make man in our EMH
[1:35:59] after our likeness and let them have
[1:36:01] dominion and let them them have dominion
[1:36:05] over everything on the face of the Earth
[1:36:07] he went to Dominion in other words
[1:36:10] that's the image of God the capability
[1:36:13] of the image of God in every man
[1:36:17] to live a life in Dominion
[1:36:21] that's Genesis 1 26.
[1:36:24] that's the potential in you and I to
[1:36:28] live a life in Dominion
[1:36:29] and whatever it is you're doing
[1:36:31] you don't have a desire to be in
[1:36:34] Dominion of it you are living beneath
[1:36:36] your god-given DNA
[1:36:39] if you are a husband you want to be not
[1:36:42] dominate your wife being dominant over
[1:36:44] yourself
[1:36:45] being Dominion you should be the
[1:36:47] greatest husband possible if you are
[1:36:49] what be the greatest wife possible
[1:36:52] your husband will speak of you like
[1:36:55] Proverbs 31
[1:36:57] if you're a son daughter greatness will
[1:37:00] be your DNA because that's our DNA
[1:37:02] greatness Dominion greatness
[1:37:06] that's our DNA
[1:37:08] thus is potential we have but potential
[1:37:11] is nothing
[1:37:13] potential Talent I'll tell you again is
[1:37:15] overrated
[1:37:18] totally absolutely completely overrated
[1:37:22] so I have potential and you do nothing
[1:37:24] more because God has
[1:37:27] predestinated you it doesn't work that
[1:37:29] way
[1:37:31] it doesn't work that way
[1:37:33] because you could easily so easily
[1:37:35] believe that that amperage needed and
[1:37:37] then do nothing like someone you know
[1:37:38] says sometimes like that so like your
[1:37:41] children are going to be there your
[1:37:42] children everybody's going to be there
[1:37:43] and all that and then these children
[1:37:45] feel like that I'm going to be there
[1:37:46] anyway no it doesn't work that way
[1:37:49] no it doesn't work that way God has no
[1:37:51] grandchildren no it doesn't work that
[1:37:53] way if you are truly presented God talks
[1:37:56] at your heart too and today when you
[1:37:58] hear his voice Harden not your heart
[1:38:01] as in the provocation because God can
[1:38:04] get provoked
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:08] let's let's go on
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:13] so
[1:38:17] potential we have it you have it I have
[1:38:19] it potential for greatness
[1:38:23] I believe as I'm standing I believe that
[1:38:25] every man every one of you every man on
[1:38:28] this face of this Earth here is
[1:38:30] programmed in their being
[1:38:33] to become phenomenal great
[1:38:37] I believe that I believe that my whole
[1:38:39] heart
[1:38:41] but the problem is smaller than young
[1:38:43] people some of the older people some
[1:38:45] boys some girls some men some women
[1:38:47] think about this greatness here I'll
[1:38:49] make some money and you
[1:38:52] don't care about the things of God you
[1:38:55] can be meet your car in that and be
[1:38:57] great in that no you can't have faith
[1:38:59] and death at the same time it's going to
[1:39:00] be one it's gonna be one
[1:39:04] because we're talking about
[1:39:07] the potential God put in man there was
[1:39:09] no flesh there just put in the soul of
[1:39:12] man he stopped conscious being in his
[1:39:15] inner being in his spirit in his being
[1:39:17] on the inside of him what God knows is
[1:39:20] going to fire that man out later in life
[1:39:23] when the flesh comes on God put
[1:39:26] potential there to be in Domination
[1:39:29] if you're a business person that should
[1:39:30] be your goal
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:33] if you are a student that should be your
[1:39:35] goal
[1:39:36] if you are a worker that should be your
[1:39:38] goal
[1:39:39] if you're an employee that should be
[1:39:40] your goals you dominate in the workplace
[1:39:42] so that your boss is going to say wow
[1:39:45] people complain about things let me let
[1:39:47] me know I'm not gonna do that let me not
[1:39:50] go into that
[1:39:51] because I don't want to misunderstand me
[1:39:53] um
[1:39:53] very carefully so you don't
[1:39:55] misunderstand me at all so
[1:39:58] um
[1:39:59] all right
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:04] then
[1:40:06] generation 137 so God created mind is
[1:40:08] the image
[1:40:09] after it's likeness and then verse 28
[1:40:12] God now spoke to
[1:40:15] the creation that creation was the soul
[1:40:17] of man
[1:40:18] the real person that you are that came
[1:40:20] from God and is going back to God again
[1:40:23] God now spoke to that soul and watch
[1:40:26] watch
[1:40:28] and the words he spoke were directed
[1:40:30] toward the Dominion towards the
[1:40:33] potential
[1:40:35] this is how God is putting the things
[1:40:38] the programming into the man programming
[1:40:42] into the man and from that programming
[1:40:45] he will live out this life of greatness
[1:40:46] and in this program that you will see
[1:40:48] that God began to break it down
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:52] be fruitful
[1:40:55] what does fruitful God to do with
[1:40:56] Dominion listen
[1:40:58] multiply
[1:41:01] be fruitful
[1:41:03] do you go into your day and just feel
[1:41:05] like that my DNA is to have a fruitful
[1:41:07] day

[1:41:13] the boss says something hey come on
[1:41:14] their day is spoiled that day is messed
[1:41:17] up

[1:41:21] claim Christian in any ship from a
[1:41:24] manner
[1:41:27] and you you you are comfortable not
[1:41:29] having a fruitful day one day two days
[1:41:32] three days four days five days

[1:41:45] after the other
[1:41:46] and your time is going every every every
[1:41:48] hour you spend now is your investment

[1:41:52] investment into the future

[1:42:05] hours is gone
[1:42:07] thank you
[1:42:08] God is going to require how you spend
[1:42:11] your time no he's going to require he's
[1:42:13] going to require of each one of us
[1:42:15] because we are commanded to redeem the
[1:42:17] time time is Lost in Time needs
[1:42:20] Redemption
[1:42:22] what are you doing with your time
[1:42:25] are you focused on having a fruitful day
[1:42:29] or
[1:42:30] multiply God spoke to this man be
[1:42:33] fruitful be a fruit and because you're
[1:42:36] fruitful you know there's a seat
[1:42:38] somewhere he didn't provide the seed in
[1:42:40] God's case here for every provides the
[1:42:42] seed of God in them for their spiritual
[1:42:45] Endeavors but he's talking about the
[1:42:47] total man he didn't provide the seed but
[1:42:50] you and I know the words the spoken word
[1:42:53] is the origin
[1:42:55] and that's the seed that God put in the
[1:42:58] man be fruitful
[1:43:01] and the man took the fruit
[1:43:03] took the words
[1:43:05] planted in the sin in his heart and from
[1:43:07] there from fruit to be fruitful to
[1:43:10] multiply every day are you a multiplier
[1:43:12] do you go around multiplying joy and
[1:43:15] peace and goodness Allah is that what
[1:43:18] you do all foreign

[1:44:34] live in Dominion he broke it down for
[1:44:36] Adam
[1:44:38] and thus have that potential to be like
[1:44:40] God comes out
[1:44:41] to be like God comes out from what what
[1:44:44] now what are what what are everything
[1:44:46] you know you know this human computer
[1:44:48] that we have here your regular computer
[1:44:51] you input easily with your keyboard
[1:44:53] right
[1:44:54] your keyboard in this case here you even
[1:44:57] put things in and then you see what you
[1:44:59] put on the screen right in this case
[1:45:01] that this human computer that you have
[1:45:02] here the screen is you and I our
[1:45:05] Behavior that's what the program sends
[1:45:09] out
[1:45:10] but what inputs the words is
[1:45:14] your fingers
[1:45:17] the human community that we have
[1:45:19] what impeached the words
[1:45:21] what you hear
[1:45:24] what you see Baba said this the eye is
[1:45:28] the gateway to the soul
[1:45:30] what you taste
[1:45:33] what you feel all of those things when
[1:45:38] you receive them they come into you and
[1:45:41] everything gets
[1:45:43] niched and narrow down into thoughts
[1:45:47] thoughts images in your heart
[1:45:52] thoughts
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:57] the water God but Mom said on the series
[1:46:00] explained to you as a thought in other
[1:46:03] words everyone is not just every word
[1:46:05] spends to you as a thought
[1:46:08] the what you read the what you hear the
[1:46:11] what you taste the words you feel bring
[1:46:13] to you as a thought
[1:46:15] and those thoughts go into
[1:46:18] the sockets of your soul
[1:46:24] and from there the ones you focus on and
[1:46:27] think over and over and over and over by
[1:46:30] meditation
[1:46:32] become the issues in your heart
[1:46:36] they become the things they are Rule and
[1:46:39] control you every thought comes and they
[1:46:41] go but the ones you focus on the first
[1:46:44] you take
[1:46:45] the pornography you will see all the
[1:46:47] time all the time all the time all the
[1:46:49] time all the time becomes issues in your
[1:46:51] heart
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:57] angry angry and you spend time talking
[1:46:59] about it becomes the issue in your heart

[1:47:13] was that you taste words words words the
[1:47:15] external steam wash your Champion the
[1:47:17] ex-nus stimulus
[1:47:20] that you receive and you receive them
[1:47:22] they come down into you as thoughts
[1:47:25] because that's how God programmed it
[1:47:28] thoughts coming to you and they go into
[1:47:30] your soul and the more you
[1:47:34] with the intensity intensity
[1:47:37] those words become those thoughts become
[1:47:39] issues in your heart

[1:47:48] can be passed on they're not genes
[1:47:49] they're genes but they can be passed on
[1:47:54] are you following me
[1:47:58] [Music]
[1:47:59] you have anger issues it's because you
[1:48:03] spend the time
[1:48:04] to think and think convert the anger

[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:55] grind and grind and grind under the
[1:48:58] sheet under the cover
[1:49:00] you're not holding anybody you're
[1:49:01] hurting yourself
[1:49:04] becomes an issue the negative issue
[1:49:07] all sorts of issues positive negative
[1:49:11] same as what the Bible says let the word
[1:49:12] of God
[1:49:14] dwelling you richly
[1:49:17] in all wisdom
[1:49:24] that's why Jesus said out of the
[1:49:26] abundance of the heart
[1:49:29] the mouth speaks the abundance that's
[1:49:31] the issue
[1:49:33] the issue because your palate your part
[1:49:36] of feeling the barrel feeling the
[1:49:37] barrier feeling the body feeling the
[1:49:38] barrel when it's full that it would IT
[1:49:42] issues out
[1:49:44] the issue is out
[1:49:49] oh brother
[1:49:51] brother oh brother me
[1:49:59] so God
[1:50:01] spoke to Adam
[1:50:04] be fruitful multiply replenish dominate
[1:50:08] because that's the goal domination is
[1:50:11] greatness greatness greatness
[1:50:13] you know in the Bible
[1:50:15] Jesus the son of God the angel said it
[1:50:19] shall be great
[1:50:22] it shall be great
[1:50:25] instead of John the Baptist in the same
[1:50:27] chapter John chapter 1 and chapter 2
[1:50:29] said the child shall be great
[1:50:35] because Genesis 1 26
[1:50:37] Dominion greatness and Genesis 1 28
[1:50:40] shows you how to
[1:50:42] actualize that potential and make it
[1:50:45] Comfort we are a bundle of potential
[1:50:48] don't you don't you ever let anybody
[1:50:50] tell you don't have potential
[1:50:53] don't you ever let anybody tell don't
[1:50:55] have that to be a Christian to be the
[1:50:57] greatest there is you have that
[1:50:58] potential to be the best there is on
[1:51:00] your job you have that potential that's
[1:51:02] what the Bible tells me well that's what
[1:51:05] I experience I don't believe you
[1:51:06] experience I believe what the Bible says
[1:51:08] and begin to doubt your own expression
[1:51:10] if it doesn't line up with the word of
[1:51:12] God oh Hallelujah Glory
[1:51:16] amen
[1:51:18] hallelujah amen all right
[1:51:23] so watch
[1:51:26] what what was the purpose of the world
[1:51:28] what come to you and become thoughts and
[1:51:31] from the thought you find thinking
[1:51:34] as a man thoughts in his thoughts in his
[1:51:37] heart so is he no no as a man thinketh
[1:51:41] in his head so is he is the thinking
[1:51:44] that turns the thoughts into
[1:51:47] issues thinking is something you are
[1:51:49] over and over and over something that
[1:51:51] dwelling you richly like in your heart
[1:51:53] is a burial and you are paying the
[1:51:56] barrel there if the barrel should be
[1:51:59] this way it gets full here and you just
[1:52:02] add the word and the pressure you don't
[1:52:04] you don't have it yet it's not going to
[1:52:05] until it gets to feel it can't issue out
[1:52:10] are you following me until it feels up
[1:52:13] it cannot issue out that's what Jesus
[1:52:15] said out of the abundance of the heart
[1:52:19] the mouth speaks
[1:52:21] that means out of the abundance we live
[1:52:24] when I was a child I speak as a child
[1:52:27] it's just our activity our action it's
[1:52:30] going to be full and then it comes out
[1:52:33] when it falls thinking that's how man is
[1:52:36] as a man thinking he said so easy you
[1:52:39] got to spend the time to do the thinking
[1:52:43] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:52:46] things are honest what's happening a
[1:52:48] good report think on these things when
[1:52:52] you lie down there at night you are not
[1:52:53] able to sleep don't let your mind just
[1:52:55] wonder find something profitable to
[1:52:58] think about
[1:52:59] okay
[1:53:00] don't just lie down there and thinking
[1:53:02] like that I just can't sleep what is
[1:53:04] that just use the time
[1:53:07] use the time find something whatsoever
[1:53:09] things are lovely whatever things are
[1:53:12] pure worship of a good report think on
[1:53:14] these things you are filling up your
[1:53:16] barrels some more freeing up the
[1:53:18] paraffin of the barrel and in due course
[1:53:20] of time it will spill over and they said
[1:53:24] what a phenomenal person what a great
[1:53:26] human being
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:34] amen

[1:54:02] life
[1:54:03] they converted into
[1:54:05] thoughts in your soul
[1:54:11] so why what
[1:54:13] positive issues from God came by words
[1:54:16] when he turned over to Genesis 3 it came
[1:54:19] by words
[1:54:21] had God said words
[1:54:28] death and life are in the power of the
[1:54:31] tongue
[1:54:35] amen
[1:54:37] so words that you hear
[1:54:39] what that you feel what that you are
[1:54:42] influenced by
[1:54:44] they shape your thoughts
[1:54:47] and the shape you're thinking
[1:54:49] and when they become your thinking
[1:54:53] many of us don't get results we won't
[1:54:55] spend enough time thinking
[1:54:57] I'm only for a year but I'll which you
[1:55:00] know I mean nothing new I'm saying but
[1:55:02] break down Joshua won to you

[1:55:10] day and night
[1:55:14] and then
[1:55:15] thou shall have
[1:55:17] good success
[1:55:19] because Knight fills up your Barrel
[1:55:22] fills the door fills it up
[1:55:24] and when it's filled up then you know
[1:55:26] you'll have it then because the month
[1:55:28] again is that so easy
[1:55:30] and you'll have good success in that
[1:55:31] thing and the same the same thing works
[1:55:33] for negative also that's right that's
[1:55:36] right
[1:55:38] oh
[1:55:43] so the ones you hear shape your thoughts
[1:55:45] they shape your thinking
[1:55:48] and your thinking shapes your belief
[1:55:51] your faith
[1:55:53] amen it comes from thoughts to thinking
[1:55:56] to believe what you what you hear
[1:55:59] whatever things are are good are
[1:56:01] righteous good report think on this
[1:56:04] thing because the shape your belief and
[1:56:06] your belief Powers how you live your
[1:56:08] life

[1:56:12] our beliefs our beliefs is what powers
[1:56:14] us

[1:56:20] you won't come to church today if you
[1:56:21] don't believe there's some good you are
[1:56:23] going to get coming to church here today
[1:56:26] even if the good is
[1:56:28] not complete I did not come to church
[1:56:30] it's some good
[1:56:32] some good
[1:56:34] even if the goodies so that your Dad or
[1:56:37] Mom will not complain did not come to
[1:56:38] church eat some good
[1:56:40] eat some good
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:50] so it's words because the words get
[1:56:53] converted to thoughts and thoughts the
[1:56:57] ones you focus on repeatedly become your
[1:56:59] thinking and your thinking shapes your
[1:57:01] belief your faith and faith is a power
[1:57:04] it's a Powerhouse
[1:57:07] because we always do what we believe
[1:57:10] amen
[1:57:13] like I said you'll never take an action
[1:57:14] unless you have an internal goal
[1:57:18] behind that action

[1:57:50] because we always do what we believe
[1:57:54] you'll never take any action unless
[1:57:56] there's an internal goal behind that
[1:57:58] action
[1:57:59] every action that we take is powered by
[1:58:01] our ability that's why I believe it's so
[1:58:02] major that's why the devil gets in there
[1:58:04] as God said to get her to believe what
[1:58:06] he wants
[1:58:07] and that's why faith is so major what
[1:58:10] you believe it matters that's what
[1:58:12] controls and make what you live by you
[1:58:15] think it doesn't matter whether you
[1:58:16] believe this other no it matters that's
[1:58:18] what gives you the lifestyle that you
[1:58:19] have what you believe you always live by
[1:58:22] what we believe
[1:58:24] now you say Amen
[1:58:27] now listening by what we believe
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:32] because behind every action
[1:58:33] is an internal goal
[1:58:36] and behind every internet goal is a
[1:58:38] belief
[1:58:39] amen no matter what our beliefs are
[1:58:42] we always do what we believe a hundred
[1:58:46] percent of the time
[1:58:48] 100 of the time
[1:58:50] it's not because somebody made you do it
[1:58:52] no
[1:58:53] you believed
[1:58:56] even if you're doing it because it will
[1:58:57] get him off my back that's your belief
[1:59:00] that's what you believe you you did it
[1:59:02] you chose to do it
[1:59:04] because you had a belief at that point
[1:59:06] in time that was the best thing for you
[1:59:07] to do
[1:59:09] like I said by the man committing
[1:59:10] adultery he believed is the best
[1:59:12] information at that point in time he's
[1:59:13] having thoughts in his mind because many
[1:59:14] times should I should I know the man
[1:59:17] feels like that when it gets to when he
[1:59:19] has crossed the line he gets to where he
[1:59:20] can't control anymore they believe
[1:59:22] Russian language is coming together my
[1:59:23] wife hasn't been nice to me lately
[1:59:26] lately
[1:59:29] and then he does the ACT
[1:59:32] his belief drives everything you do
[1:59:33] you're swear just think just think about
[1:59:36] every action you take you take
[1:59:37] a belief is behind it that's driving it
[1:59:39] belief is Faith that's why faith is
[1:59:42] Major is important for you
[1:59:44] it's my way that you would live and stay
[1:59:46] in faith
[1:59:48] [Music]
[1:59:51] because Faith Powers is your power I
[1:59:54] tell you your faith is the power
[1:59:56] the devil knows that
[2:00:00] the devil knows he can control what you
[2:00:02] believe
[2:00:03] he has you
[2:00:06] he controls your life how you live the
[2:00:08] lifestyle everything he has you in his
[2:00:11] pockets
[2:00:12] I don't know all that stuff in the
[2:00:14] church I don't know whatever and you are
[2:00:16] making the guy
[2:00:17] and the devil is just saying like that
[2:00:19] random boy right on that he showed them
[2:00:22] Chicken Boy chicken show them I don't
[2:00:25] care what they're talking about there
[2:00:27] and the devil is riding really good
[2:00:29] because he's affecting your belief all
[2:00:30] these things there is not true it's
[2:00:32] false this good thing I don't bite
[2:00:36] and then it affects you
[2:00:38] because it gives you a life gives your
[2:00:40] lifestyle because we if you never had it
[2:00:42] for me today just hear this Allah we
[2:00:44] always live by what we believe because
[2:00:47] the Bible says we walk by faith
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:51] and that's every man
[2:00:52] we walk by faith
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:00:59] and that's what God in in training Adam
[2:01:03] was trained to walk by faith and train
[2:01:06] Adam in that Age of Innocence
[2:01:09] the world she was speaking to him was
[2:01:11] the faith words of Hope what's of Life
[2:01:14] words of encouragement words of living
[2:01:16] in a wall Beyond limits lots of
[2:01:19] possibilities and not impossibilities
[2:01:21] what what of greatness what of Glory
[2:01:24] Words of Power that's what God was put
[2:01:26] in Adam
[2:01:32] and this was became issues in Adam's
[2:01:35] house is thinking
[2:01:37] the issues of his life because as a man
[2:01:39] thinking he said so is he
[2:01:41] that's another word for saying the
[2:01:43] issues in your hand are your thinking
[2:01:46] and your thinking gives you
[2:01:48] your attitude
[2:01:51] and your attitude that's your character
[2:01:53] your behavior
[2:01:55] but the devil is trying to get God's
[2:01:58] trying to get to that thinking portion
[2:02:00] where your belief is anchored
[2:02:03] my ankle holds within the Veil
[2:02:07] that's what the devil is I mean God is
[2:02:09] eminent
[2:02:10] to get you to believe
[2:02:14] that's what the gospel is all about
[2:02:17] to get you to believe what you believe
[2:02:20] that's what life is all about what you
[2:02:23] mean that's what the the the social
[2:02:25] scene is all about
[2:02:28] you are just there just just bugger and
[2:02:30] Joshua all the buga and all that stuff
[2:02:32] you are doing that but the devil
[2:02:35] devoting the show what he wants is he
[2:02:37] wants to infect and affect your belief
[2:02:43] your way to having listen listen listen
[2:02:48] you are doing burger and in your soul is
[2:02:51] been entered some belief had God said
[2:02:54] God hasn't said
[2:02:56] and like what happened to Eve you start
[2:02:58] having doubt issues without issues
[2:03:03] doubt issues
[2:03:05] and then your faith is no more
[2:03:09] solid
[2:03:10] your face is diluted
[2:03:12] with some doubt
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:15] and I'm done to everybody I'm talking to
[2:03:17] everybody because the attention
[2:03:19] to that person I'm talking to you
[2:03:23] I'm addressing your issues not that
[2:03:26] person's issues because your issues you
[2:03:29] curse them yourself not that person
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:33] I'm talking to you and I'm talking to
[2:03:35] myself too can you say Amen
[2:03:39] can you say amen I can't hear you
[2:03:41] amen
[2:03:44] Glory
[2:03:45] let's try to close out here amen oh my
[2:03:54] to give Adam each issues of greatness in
[2:03:58] his soul God found no better way than
[2:04:00] words
[2:04:03] Faith cometh by hearing
[2:04:07] listen he didn't say faith coming behind
[2:04:09] the word of God so Faith coming by
[2:04:11] hearing comma hearing the word of God
[2:04:17] did you hear that no let me question you
[2:04:19] again
[2:04:20] Faith cometh by hearing
[2:04:22] stop it there whatever Faith whatever
[2:04:24] you hear gives you faith I don't believe
[2:04:27] this girlfriend if that is what you hear
[2:04:29] all the time before you know it like
[2:04:31] that you have that's become your belief
[2:04:32] I don't believe this God thing
[2:04:34] that's right
[2:04:38] if you fall like they like what all
[2:04:41] these new last chapter in the world just
[2:04:43] fill people like that we're not there's
[2:04:45] no man can we are humankind they're
[2:04:48] gender neutral and all that when you
[2:04:50] hear that openly enough threat comes by
[2:04:53] that your faith stops your belief your
[2:04:55] belief comes by that and that's why you
[2:04:57] become you believe
[2:04:59] what they're trying to do give another
[2:05:02] 10 15 years even though if not shoulder
[2:05:04] than that so all our children will just
[2:05:06] believe like that a man is a woman a
[2:05:08] woman is a man you are whatever you feel
[2:05:09] you are because the and those things
[2:05:12] don't need any resistance they say
[2:05:13] repeatedly repeatedly faith comes by
[2:05:15] hearing and that's what you hear that's
[2:05:18] what you read about that's what you see
[2:05:19] everywhere and all that so get your
[2:05:21] don't don't do no more like you let your
[2:05:23] children just watch any of those movies

[2:07:28] for the gun they put in my head I will
[2:07:29] never come in adultery
[2:07:31] I'll never steal
[2:07:33] no you did it because you took a
[2:07:35] decision that the best thing for me to

[2:08:06] to do it
[2:08:15] he's the one that upset me and that's
[2:08:16] why I did that no it's not true
[2:08:18] no it's not it's not it's my wives my
[2:08:21] husband it is not true
[2:08:24] look how would God
[2:08:26] you and I
[2:08:27] we say we are going to control the Earth
[2:08:30] and then God puts the control of our
[2:08:32] everyday actions in the hands of some
[2:08:34] other person
[2:08:35] it doesn't even make sense don't even
[2:08:37] add up
[2:08:39] you are an absolute control
[2:08:43] absolute control of yourself
[2:08:47] Absolute Total Control amen
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:54] I'm not talking to believers
[2:08:57] I'm not talking to believers
[2:08:59] all right
[2:09:01] all right
[2:09:06] so Genesis 1 26 28 is the love of God
[2:09:11] poured into man in the form of his seven
[2:09:14] spirits
[2:09:16] that's got DNA in man
[2:09:18] the potential and the words the the
[2:09:22] spirit to make the potential come alive
[2:09:25] so Adam can live a life of greatness a
[2:09:28] life of dominion a life of fruitful
[2:09:30] multiplier
[2:09:32] replenish subdue Dominion
[2:09:36] the what the spirit to fire the
[2:09:40] potential and make Adam's potential come
[2:09:42] to life
[2:09:43] so love is a belief system
[2:09:47] the belief system Amen in other words
[2:09:51] love is a way of life
[2:09:53] oh that's my way of life no it's because
[2:09:55] you have a belief that's empowering that
[2:09:57] way of life
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:01] or in our home we have prayer every
[2:10:02] morning you have a belief that no face
[2:10:04] like that pray every morning is good for
[2:10:06] us
[2:10:08] you never do anything against it that's
[2:10:09] why I just said love thy neighbor as
[2:10:11] thyself you don't have to be better to
[2:10:12] love yourself no
[2:10:14] the man who commits suicide he feels is
[2:10:17] the best thing for him at that moment
[2:10:18] that's why he kills himself
[2:10:22] of course it's wrong but that's why he
[2:10:24] does it
[2:10:27] so we'll be able to own our lives and
[2:10:29] take responsibility for everything
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:39] because you know
[2:10:42] when the devil came in Eden you remember
[2:10:46] pain is bad pleasure is good that's what
[2:10:50] it is
[2:10:51] pleasure adultery pleasure fornication
[2:10:55] pleasure still what doesn't belong to
[2:10:57] you take it pleasure is good you have to
[2:11:01] rationalize
[2:11:03] why is good at that point in time
[2:11:06] and while the pain or discipline to not
[2:11:08] do it is bad my wife has just been not
[2:11:11] been nice to me at all
[2:11:13] so I gotta do this it's not my fault
[2:11:15] it's her or whatever whoever whatever
[2:11:18] whatever put whatever there or you shout
[2:11:20] on your children when you don't need to
[2:11:24] when you don't need to
[2:11:26] because you think at that point in time
[2:11:28] it serves your purpose
[2:11:30] what it is just pain is bad pleasure
[2:11:34] just the pain of uh uh feedback or
[2:11:38] criticism Growing Pains you can't be you
[2:11:41] rather ease of full of instant
[2:11:45] gratification let me just release this
[2:11:47] pressure now and speak back
[2:11:50] and shout and let it off
[2:11:53] and
[2:11:55] your pain pleasure programming that's
[2:11:58] like little babies living like an animal
[2:12:01] s have no soul to process these things
[2:12:03] the man coming to Android when at every
[2:12:06] point when we do anything wrong we are
[2:12:07] living like animals
[2:12:12] the man who is living adultery
[2:12:15] is living like an animal
[2:12:19] you've seen
[2:12:20] let me not go there
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:23] oh
[2:12:25] okay
[2:12:27] so love is a belief system
[2:12:29] in other words love is a way of life
[2:12:33] how we see that by the spirit spoken
[2:12:36] words of love in Genesis 1 28.
[2:12:39] and so also is fear a belief system fear
[2:12:44] dominates everything
[2:12:46] dominates everything
[2:12:49] and this phase tied directly into our
[2:12:51] pin pleasure programming
[2:12:54] that pain is bad and pleasure is good
[2:12:57] and that's why women means we always
[2:12:59] gravitate towards pleasure and get away
[2:13:01] from pain like I told you over and over
[2:13:03] in the course of this series here God
[2:13:05] that's what happened in Eden
[2:13:07] the pain of discipline to wait until God
[2:13:11] will give them
[2:13:13] the promised son
[2:13:15] was too much for Eve and she went to the
[2:13:18] pleasure of sensual living adultery with
[2:13:22] the servant
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:29] pleasure to good even when pain is bad
[2:13:32] to run towards pleasure
[2:13:35] because the Bible says she saw that the
[2:13:38] tree was good for food
[2:13:41] want to be desired to make one wise
[2:13:45] and was pleasurable gravity towards
[2:13:48] pleasure and run away from pain
[2:13:51] and with that his speed of fear came in
[2:13:53] when they did it they found like that
[2:13:55] all is good all the all the Glitters
[2:13:57] Is Not Gold
[2:13:59] it's Fool's Gold many times
[2:14:03] hallelujah
[2:14:05] oh glory to God Amen
[2:14:10] and so the fear that came in then
[2:14:13] because they said Adam Adam where are
[2:14:16] thou Adam Adam where are thou I heard
[2:14:19] that voice walking in the garden
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:23] and I hid myself
[2:14:25] because I was afraid
[2:14:28] fear came in there
[2:14:30] just like love is a belief system fear
[2:14:33] is also
[2:14:35] a belief system
[2:14:37] and it's tied directly into your
[2:14:39] pain pleasure programming like you're
[2:14:42] saying Eve run away from Pain grab it
[2:14:45] towards pleasure
[2:14:48] and that makes you excellent focused and
[2:14:50] Jesus said you'll fail when men's Hearts
[2:14:53] fell in
[2:14:54] for looking after the things happening
[2:14:57] in the external the world around them
[2:15:00] the real person lives from within
[2:15:01] because that's where the person is at
[2:15:04] it comes from inside out
[2:15:07] and that's one thing many people many of
[2:15:09] you haven't got yet but I will break it
[2:15:10] down it takes us two three four years
[2:15:12] we'll break it down
[2:15:15] are you in a horse go anywhere
[2:15:17] no way only the horse is going to
[2:15:19] Rapture that's all
[2:15:20] so
[2:15:21] [Music]
[2:15:26] fear came another fall
[2:15:30] and that's how every man was programmed
[2:15:33] to live
[2:15:34] but the devil is not the author of
[2:15:36] creation so we live and run away from
[2:15:38] Pain and gravity towards pleasure and
[2:15:41] just the way he had Eve there he was
[2:15:43] certain was going to have all of us
[2:15:45] there from the day we are born
[2:15:48] well he has kept in God
[2:15:51] and took that fear
[2:15:54] and turning on his head because it was
[2:15:57] God's spirit in man that was perverted
[2:15:59] anyway so God took it back
[2:16:01] and turn it into
[2:16:05] is on purpose the fear of God
[2:16:09] turn the offense to the fear of God and
[2:16:11] that fear of God still made use of took
[2:16:13] what the devil had from his hand and
[2:16:15] measures of it to God's glory
[2:16:17] because it's what God owns it and the
[2:16:19] devil only provided it and God took that
[2:16:22] fear and let that child understand life
[2:16:24] that pain is bad and pleasure is good
[2:16:28] when that child touches a hot plate he
[2:16:31] feels pain if that child don't feel that
[2:16:33] way that child will charge your hot
[2:16:34] plate and it will burn
[2:16:36] and just have bronze all throughout his
[2:16:39] body
[2:16:40] but because pain is bad
[2:16:43] it runs away from that and not lends by
[2:16:46] experience that you will never touch a
[2:16:48] hot plane anymore because it's not good
[2:16:49] for you are you following me
[2:16:52] that child goes to the edge of his
[2:16:54] staircase and falls over the pain is bad
[2:17:00] pleasure is good
[2:17:03] God use it in the early years but when
[2:17:06] we get to that age of accountability
[2:17:08] when we're adults
[2:17:10] that ought to change
[2:17:11] [Music]
[2:17:13] and we don't live no more by pain is bad
[2:17:16] pleasure is good but many when you do
[2:17:19] sin after the age of accountability is
[2:17:21] because you are living by that
[2:17:23] belief system that's fired by fear fight
[2:17:26] by the flesh fired by the external the
[2:17:29] external is the Flesh and all around it
[2:17:33] at the age of accountability we're
[2:17:34] supposed to change that and become
[2:17:35] adults who live not by
[2:17:40] pain is bad pleasure is good but they
[2:17:42] live by what is right or wrong
[2:17:46] and I'll show you because God taught
[2:17:48] that baby Adam or the child Adam in the
[2:17:52] age of that Age of Innocence
[2:17:55] of every tree you can eat of the church
[2:17:57] you don't eat it what's right what's
[2:17:59] wrong
[2:18:00] go talk the child
[2:18:03] so that when it gets accountability
[2:18:04] knows what's right and wrong
[2:18:06] and doesn't live no more by pain is bad
[2:18:09] pleasure is good but many people don't
[2:18:12] leave those training wheels it's like
[2:18:14] riding a tricycle to know how to balance
[2:18:16] yourself going through life and then
[2:18:18] when you become 10 11 15 20 years old
[2:18:20] you are still riding a tricycle
[2:18:23] that's what many of us do with our lives
[2:18:26] [Music]
[2:18:27] what we do is is our pain that we react
[2:18:30] to our pain and our pleasure
[2:18:33] what you said really hurt me
[2:18:35] what you said really
[2:18:37] make me feel bad
[2:18:39] look at what they did and look at what
[2:18:41] they did look at that
[2:18:42] and that's just what you did that's what
[2:18:45] you do that's what you live by
[2:18:46] and that controls everything that you do
[2:18:48] and that grinds issues in your heart
[2:18:51] just if you just have issues all over
[2:18:54] all over issues I wonder they even have
[2:18:56] space for anything possible anymore
[2:19:00] issues negative issues have taken so
[2:19:03] much mind share in their souls
[2:19:06] they don't have space for anything
[2:19:07] possible anymore
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:10] be tired by this angry about this feel
[2:19:13] bad about this feel about it but the
[2:19:15] issues issues
[2:19:16] issues
[2:19:20] oh my
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:26] God Sophia came another fall
[2:19:28] but God turns they feel on his head
[2:19:31] a mixtures of
[2:19:32] that belief system that pain is bad
[2:19:35] pleasure is good in the first years of
[2:19:37] Our Lives during those years of
[2:19:39] Innocence
[2:19:40] but then when we come to the age of
[2:19:42] accountability
[2:19:43] we we
[2:19:44] ought to switch to live by love what is
[2:19:47] right by love joy peace goodness
[2:19:51] gentleness long suffering
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:54] so love and Pain I'm In Love and fear I
[2:19:58] believe systems
[2:19:59] the stories of the issues of our lives
[2:20:02] and God in Eden poured the love of God
[2:20:05] there given Adam issues of greatness so
[2:20:08] only she has that how to be great that's
[2:20:10] why that's wasn't him but at the fall
[2:20:12] the devil came in there and put issues
[2:20:14] of fear and negativity and doubt there
[2:20:17] and that's how we have the white dog and
[2:20:19] the black dog on the inside of us
[2:20:23] and when we get saved it doesn't does it
[2:20:26] does it the black dog is a snake in the
[2:20:29] soul
[2:20:30] it doesn't wipe out because we get saved
[2:20:33] even the bathroom of the Holy Spirit
[2:20:35] doesn't totally annihilate it his
[2:20:37] adoption that will annihilate it
[2:20:40] but because I'll show you from there
[2:20:41] next time God bless you
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:11] foreign
[2:21:14] [Music]
[2:21:23] [Music]
[2:21:25] all right
[2:21:27] did you get did you get the message
[2:21:29] today
[2:21:31] that you are you are totally you are in
[2:21:33] more control than you think you are
[2:21:35] because the devil disempowers You by
[2:21:38] making you feel you don't have the
[2:21:40] control and when we come Christians like
[2:21:42] is God that's in control of our lives
[2:21:44] and all that so then don't get saved sit
[2:21:45] there and say God's in control of Our
[2:21:47] Lives
[2:21:50] he talks at your heart and you go to the
[2:21:52] altar he talks very hard that thing
[2:21:54] you're doing is wrong and you need to
[2:21:56] repent Angel is not going to come repent
[2:21:58] for you I'll be blessed I'm president
[2:21:59] I'll be there no that's a very short
[2:22:01] sign you are not going to be there
[2:22:04] amen because he said if we live on the
[2:22:07] inside in the spirit let us also walk on
[2:22:12] the outside in the spirit it's always
[2:22:13] from the inside
[2:22:14] well it's on the inside oh brother
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:20] the quote
[2:22:24] okay
[2:22:26] it's a little lengthy but listen here
[2:22:28] for instance I believe that every
[2:22:30] born-again member of the body of Christ
[2:22:33] the Paradox in themselves I believe each
[2:22:36] one of the of you methodists and
[2:22:38] Presbyterian they never had experience
[2:22:40] the purpose of the Holy Ghost was in
[2:22:41] some formal church that did not believe
[2:22:43] in the general New Birth and has not
[2:22:44] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:22:45] is a perfect example of a paradox
[2:22:47] because something happened to you that
[2:22:50] changed your whole being and anyone
[2:22:52] could look at that and know that a
[2:22:53] paradox is a miracle unless that happens
[2:22:56] you cannot be a Christian there must be
[2:22:59] a paradox for you to become a Christian
[2:23:00] because no one can change a spirit in a
[2:23:04] man and give him new breath outside of
[2:23:07] God God Alone is the only one that can
[2:23:09] do it
[2:23:11] and it's a miracle how that God can take
[2:23:13] a man's thinking and his ways and his
[2:23:16] life and everything and changing from
[2:23:19] what it was to what it can be
[2:23:22] what he can make it
[2:23:25] for instance a few days ago I was caught
[2:23:27] on a scene a little something on that
[2:23:30] was a fine young man fine very fine boy
[2:23:33] he was going with a little girl
[2:23:35] like some of them here and everywhere
[2:23:38] else
[2:23:40] very fine little girl out of a fine
[2:23:42] family
[2:23:43] and this but all of a sudden come with
[2:23:45] some kind of an idea and he just walked
[2:23:47] away
[2:23:48] it is something wrong to the little girl
[2:23:50] I'm much and much has promised her to do
[2:23:52] a certain thing and then didn't do it
[2:23:54] and instead of coming to the game and
[2:23:55] apologizing like a gentleman should do
[2:23:57] he just it just wasn't in him to do it
[2:24:00] watch this prophet
[2:24:02] and the father and mother called me to
[2:24:04] the scene and said we will desire to
[2:24:06] know what is wrong with our boy he said
[2:24:08] misbehaving big time
[2:24:09] maybe brought up in church and instead
[2:24:11] of misbehaving the big time
[2:24:15] what's wrong with that boy
[2:24:18] this will make me make excuses what's
[2:24:19] wrong with that boy whatever what's
[2:24:22] wrong with that boy nobody's going to
[2:24:23] kill anybody but you're going to know
[2:24:25] what you're dealing with
[2:24:27] I skipped that in Eden you know that the
[2:24:30] devil convinced Eve to get these issues
[2:24:32] in to get many of these negative issues
[2:24:35] in you what was it like it convinced Eve
[2:24:38] there was a problem where there really
[2:24:40] was no problem
[2:24:45] and it it brought into a issue of
[2:24:49] adultery because One Believes
[2:24:52] wrong beliefs not just unbelief
[2:24:55] unbelief is in the word of God
[2:24:58] an unbeliever man doesn't care about the
[2:24:59] word of God on wrong beliefs and wrong
[2:25:01] beliefs
[2:25:03] wrong beliefs opens up the gateway to
[2:25:05] the devil as much as unbelief does
[2:25:08] because they're all shapes of the same
[2:25:11] not unbelief in the word of God
[2:25:22] the mother mother came to me and said we
[2:25:24] would like to know desire to know what's
[2:25:26] wrong with that boy
[2:25:27] now it's not easy to do sometime but you
[2:25:31] must be truthful and honest
[2:25:33] before the boy was a Christian as far as
[2:25:35] far as a Believer he had repented and
[2:25:38] had been baptized
[2:25:39] and now he's positioned among the
[2:25:40] Believers
[2:25:41] but he had not received the person of
[2:25:43] the Holy Spirit no matter how much he
[2:25:45] thought he had
[2:25:48] and that's where we're leading to
[2:25:50] but even the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:52] like I said doesn't Wipe Out the snake
[2:25:54] but he gives you some power
[2:25:56] over and above it
[2:26:00] so you can imagine without the baptism
[2:26:02] you're just struggling
[2:26:08] you're thinking you have and having it
[2:26:10] is you thinking you have and having it
[2:26:12] is two different things you might be
[2:26:14] able to try to say you have and you
[2:26:16] might be able to show some evidence of
[2:26:18] some emotion but unless your life is
[2:26:20] vindicating what you are profession you
[2:26:22] have you still haven't got it
[2:26:25] no matter how many emotions how much you
[2:26:28] jump how much you run sensation speaking
[2:26:32] in tongues or shouting or whatever you
[2:26:35] might laid upon which is all right I
[2:26:37] believe in all that true but unless your
[2:26:40] life copes with your testimony
[2:26:43] then you haven't got it
[2:26:45] because the Fruit of the Spirit
[2:26:48] fruitful fruitful fruits of the spirit
[2:26:51] vindicate what you are just like the
[2:26:53] fruit of any three Tales what it is
[2:26:56] Jesus said by the fruit you shall know
[2:26:59] them
[2:27:00] now these young fellows parents his
[2:27:02] mother is German no reflection on the
[2:27:04] German but there's a strain in that
[2:27:06] family straining that family
[2:27:09] string
[2:27:12] and the strain is in the home
[2:27:14] and the children live with that and
[2:27:17] children live learn what they live
[2:27:20] unless Trend comes to them as an issue
[2:27:23] of life
[2:27:24] and those children just go they just
[2:27:27] can't have a normal relationship with
[2:27:28] anybody
[2:27:29] they just must the matter aggregation is
[2:27:31] the major side where you get a strained
[2:27:32] relationship possibly you and your
[2:27:34] father's house
[2:27:38] Elijah said to wake up
[2:27:42] foreign
[2:27:44] no reflection on the Germans but there's
[2:27:47] a string in that family and that is
[2:27:48] they'll just sit and you can talk to
[2:27:50] them and you'll just tear you right in
[2:27:52] the face
[2:27:53] you don't care what you're talking about
[2:27:56] the girl's sister
[2:27:58] the mother of this boy her sister
[2:28:01] the mother of this boy her sister that's
[2:28:03] the boy's auntie I have calmed down the
[2:28:06] street many morning and this young lady
[2:28:08] be setting out in the yard and I'd say
[2:28:11] good morning how you doing
[2:28:13] she just chill and look at me
[2:28:18] and I'd stop and say sure I find money
[2:28:22] she would just stand by look what at you
[2:28:24] an intelligent woman
[2:28:25] and I say come up to see us sometime you
[2:28:28] see she just turn and look
[2:28:32] that distance look it's a spirit in the
[2:28:35] family
[2:28:38] is an issue in the family it's an issue
[2:28:40] of life in the family
[2:28:45] either they believe it makes them feel
[2:28:47] Swank or feel tush or feel Superior or
[2:28:52] feel like the guys in the insane or feel
[2:28:54] like we don't go around with all these
[2:28:56] church people or whatever we are the
[2:28:58] whatever they feel just tell you are you
[2:29:00] like that
[2:29:02] the boy in church saved same thing so
[2:29:06] his conversion did not take it out
[2:29:08] no that's what I'm trying to show you
[2:29:11] because we get lazy because just like
[2:29:13] God is going to do for us no you have
[2:29:14] work to do we are laborers together with
[2:29:17] God
[2:29:19] no matter how much you are predestinated
[2:29:21] you got work to do
[2:29:23] work to do
[2:29:25] so you just stand and look well her
[2:29:29] brothers are that way father and mother
[2:29:32] is that way because that's the
[2:29:34] atmosphere and that atmosphere was
[2:29:37] poured into her according to her because
[2:29:39] she sees it the child sit in the home it
[2:29:41] becomes thoughts in their hearts becomes
[2:29:44] their thinking how they live and then
[2:29:45] becomes another it fills up IT issues
[2:29:48] out
[2:29:49] issues out that's why you see some
[2:29:51] things running families this is not
[2:29:52] genetic I mean a lot of is genetic but
[2:29:54] even without the genes you can I'll show
[2:29:57] you how even things that are not genes
[2:29:59] can become a genetic thing from you
[2:30:00] science not me science I'll show you
[2:30:02] that also not today
[2:30:05] [Music]
[2:30:08] now the father of the boy
[2:30:11] so on his on his mother's side
[2:30:14] her brothers his mother's brothers are
[2:30:16] that way the father and mother is that
[2:30:18] way also he's one parents that way and
[2:30:21] the anti of course that way now the
[2:30:24] father of the ball is strictly a
[2:30:25] nourished Man Moody Moody
[2:30:30] Moody and high temperate High strong
[2:30:32] highly strong when highly strong when
[2:30:35] Swami isolation he can cut right away
[2:30:37] very prickly they get angry at
[2:30:39] everything just just
[2:30:41] very prickly
[2:30:44] even tension just
[2:30:45] attention tension
[2:30:53] like high tension just just High
[2:30:56] attention just everything just get angry
[2:30:58] just attention that's how we are many of
[2:31:00] us you know the real life you know
[2:31:01] that's how you are
[2:31:02] all of us all of us this is not for the
[2:31:05] other things for you for you you examine
[2:31:07] yourself now the fellow boys should be
[2:31:09] an Irishman Moody High tempered High
[2:31:12] strong
[2:31:13] that's his whole family like that
[2:31:16] so are you telling me all the family
[2:31:17] have these jeans no it's just the
[2:31:19] atmosphere they live in
[2:31:21] Adam lived an atmosphere of positivity
[2:31:24] be bold be strong you can do it amen but
[2:31:28] we get this train leaving an atmosphere
[2:31:30] of like gossip and who it doesn't like
[2:31:32] them who doesn't like them and and you
[2:31:34] think they are going to grow up to
[2:31:35] fulfill the potential of greatest of
[2:31:37] course not
[2:31:38] [Music]
[2:31:40] we get them live in an atmosphere of
[2:31:42] like
[2:31:43] just negative negativity
[2:31:53] High Strong high tempered that's his
[2:31:55] whole family like that
[2:31:57] except one out of the family that's
[2:31:59] converted
[2:32:01] that's converted and that understands
[2:32:04] these things here and knowing like that
[2:32:06] I am not going to live my life just
[2:32:07] reacting through life I'm going to live
[2:32:08] my life responding to life I'll respond
[2:32:11] to life I'll take charge I own I own my
[2:32:13] life I take charge
[2:32:17] I took charge
[2:32:20] the father mother both are Christians
[2:32:23] filled with the Holy Ghost and they have
[2:32:24] brought this young man up in the way of
[2:32:26] the Lord
[2:32:27] and now the young man is about 17 or 18
[2:32:29] years old something along their very
[2:32:31] fine kid very fine kid and it's been a
[2:32:33] real model boy at home nice kid and he's
[2:32:36] got a brother that's just vice versa
[2:32:40] both the girls the mother's family lives
[2:32:42] close to a fine Church
[2:32:44] but do you think they'd ever come over
[2:32:45] there no they won't go to church there
[2:32:48] and they know it's right but it's just
[2:32:50] not in them to ask forgiveness or ask
[2:32:52] pardoning they just won't do it it's
[2:32:54] just not in them
[2:32:58] now the genes in the mother father or
[2:33:01] mother of this boy no matter how much
[2:33:03] they are converted Still Remains the
[2:33:05] flesh that has been interbred out to
[2:33:07] this boy therefore the boy has got a
[2:33:09] complex in him just like from his
[2:33:11] mother's family and they are not
[2:33:13] forgiven they will not apologize and
[2:33:15] there's that and and that's where that
[2:33:17] boy stands now accept to the father no
[2:33:20] matter how much you raise him up now
[2:33:22] look at you out of your family all of
[2:33:24] them drunkards and fighting and shooting
[2:33:27] and cutting and so forth
[2:33:29] now look at our family to the mother
[2:33:31] there are a bunch of people just said
[2:33:34] they won't speak very independent
[2:33:37] the independent thing very independent
[2:33:39] man on my own I like that too
[2:33:41] but everything has its limits
[2:33:45] very independent and so forth a reverent
[2:33:48] to religion
[2:33:50] but I said it's not you you are the only
[2:33:53] one of all your sisters and brothers and
[2:33:55] you are sweet kind of forgiven what does
[2:33:57] that and you are true part of the family
[2:33:59] tree yet you have received the Holy
[2:34:01] Ghost that's the thing that made you
[2:34:02] tender and sweet it's not your people
[2:34:05] anymore it's your Christ that lives in
[2:34:08] you that's why you are different
[2:34:10] but what I'm telling you actually like
[2:34:12] not because you're a Christian
[2:34:13] automatically goes no that's the worst
[2:34:15] way I'm building up to
[2:34:16] that's what I'm building up to even with
[2:34:18] the person of the Holy Ghost you are
[2:34:20] just getting started
[2:34:21] so that's why you need the Holy Ghost
[2:34:23] that's why there's seven breath pains
[2:34:27] to shake you out of your filled flesh
[2:34:30] shake you out of these issues of life
[2:34:32] and Shake you back into the image of
[2:34:35] Jesus Christ
[2:34:36] amen doesn't the middle Santander it's
[2:34:39] not your people anymore it's your Christ
[2:34:42] that lives in you I said to the boy look
[2:34:44] at your family practice all of them are
[2:34:46] drunks and so forth and how moody and
[2:34:48] high temper and high Strong high strong
[2:34:50] but you are not you are kind forgiven
[2:34:52] what is it the Holy Spirit you are no
[2:34:54] more what you want what you are is
[2:34:56] Christ and you are said now that's the
[2:34:58] thing that's going to happen to your son
[2:35:00] on the father reads up and said my son
[2:35:02] went to the altar he was baptized
[2:35:03] correct in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:35:05] what about in the pool said I know my
[2:35:07] son has come to Christ see parents yeah
[2:35:11] that may be all right all the outward
[2:35:13] emotions you might be identified as
[2:35:16] believer of the Believers but until he's
[2:35:17] reaching and written born again I advise
[2:35:20] that that young man to never marry a
[2:35:22] woman
[2:35:23] or he'll make hell on Earth for her unto
[2:35:26] that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of
[2:35:28] Christ comes in then that will be a
[2:35:30] paradox in itself to take the very
[2:35:33] nature of a brother that's between
[2:35:34] father and mother and yet in his
[2:35:35] intellectuals he's trying his best to
[2:35:37] overcome it he can do it by
[2:35:39] intellectuals he'll never overcome it
[2:35:41] Christ has to come in him and overcome
[2:35:43] it when he lets Christ in then he's
[2:35:46] already overcome then it will be a
[2:35:48] perfect product when a man is born on
[2:35:51] the spirit of God
[2:35:53] a paradox

[3:00:40] family day tomorrow Lord willing right
[3:00:42] here at the Tabernacle where the Gideon
[3:00:44] would have given quite an overview after
[3:00:47] the service last week so we're going to
[3:00:49] remind you to walk with your foods and
[3:00:51] drinks certainly feel free to partner
[3:00:54] collaborate share and with the Gideon
[3:00:57] would have went over that last week it's
[3:01:00] better to have more than they have less
[3:01:01] but certainly don't let anything keep
[3:01:04] you back from coming also make sure you
[3:01:06] organize your transportation it is
[3:01:08] Carnival Monday as you know and although
[3:01:11] there are plans and
[3:01:13] things in place for activities you are
[3:01:16] certainly welcome to work with different
[3:01:18] things for activities games bicycles and
[3:01:20] those things for particularly for the
[3:01:22] younger one but I just want to encourage
[3:01:24] the church most importantly is to be in
[3:01:27] the presence of one another
[3:01:29] and to have a time to fellowship and
[3:01:30] have a time to connect knowing that one
[3:01:33] day when this time experience is all
[3:01:36] over we'll be on the other side
[3:01:37] fellowshipping about the trials and
[3:01:40] fellowshipping about how we made it over
[3:01:41] and we are looking forward to spend more
[3:01:43] time with each other it's also biblical
[3:01:46] as the day approaches that we spend more
[3:01:48] time together encouraging one another
[3:01:51] fighting through these trials that we
[3:01:53] all have to face that God and His Divine
[3:01:55] wisdom has sent our way and certainly
[3:01:59] last but not least among the great
[3:02:01] expectation as I'm sure you are as well
[3:02:03] for our convention this July 14 15 and
[3:02:06] 16 and I believe in my heart that it
[3:02:09] will be the greatest convention that we
[3:02:10] have ever had do you believe that
[3:02:12] that one of these days of Minnesota
[3:02:14] wouldn't be able to minister that the
[3:02:16] Holy Ghost will pour out in such a way
[3:02:18] that'll shake the word it'll shake this
[3:02:20] island it'll shake the nation and I
[3:02:22] believe God has called us for such a
[3:02:24] time as this so we want to encourage you
[3:02:25] to be in prayer and also uh in
[3:02:29] preparation for this as we are looking
[3:02:31] for God to do something
[3:02:32] as you know for the last few years we
[3:02:34] would have had ritual conventions
[3:02:36] because of the pandemic but we are
[3:02:37] really happy to be able to get back to
[3:02:39] physical physical conventions this year
[3:02:41] and we're looking for God's work for us
[3:02:44] and to also be able to host our local
[3:02:48] Believers as well as Believers from
[3:02:50] around the world just before I came up
[3:02:52] to the pulpit I got a message you know
[3:02:54] from Ivory Coast with number of
[3:02:56] believers who are trying to make it and
[3:02:57] we're beginning to get to the
[3:02:59] applications and the requests coming in
[3:03:01] for all of the Visas and all of these
[3:03:03] things so we could begin to process so
[3:03:05] our Believers coming back once more to
[3:03:07] this beautiful small island of Trinidad
[3:03:10] to have a wonderful time in fellowship
[3:03:12] with the Lord so beyond the expectation
[3:03:15] we need all the help and the support and
[3:03:18] but over also asks that we mentioned
[3:03:20] that we are looking to get some
[3:03:21] commitment from the Believers as the
[3:03:23] Lord put on your heart in terms of
[3:03:25] pledges and commitments for the
[3:03:26] convention we would like to be able to
[3:03:28] start to work on this from next Sunday
[3:03:30] Lord willing and but over there
[3:03:32] that and we'll put some support there
[3:03:34] with kind of coordinate that effort but
[3:03:36] we are soliciting your support uh
[3:03:39] whatever law puts on your heart but what
[3:03:40] is important is that we have a
[3:03:42] commitment so we can be in a position to
[3:03:44] be a blessing to others you believe that
[3:03:45] this morning
[3:03:46] so may the Lord wish you bless you have
[3:03:49] a wonderful time in the Lord today is
[3:03:52] the Lord's day so it's it's a day we
[3:03:54] dedicated the Lord so all those service
[3:03:56] is officially over I want to encourage
[3:03:58] you to keep practicing the presence of
[3:04:00] the Lord he loves the fellowship with
[3:04:01] you you know he loves when you call upon
[3:04:03] his name he whenever you talk about him
[3:04:05] he draws in there because he loves to be
[3:04:07] the center of your joy the scent of your
[3:04:09] life the scent of your home you know my
[3:04:12] brother all who said so much about the
[3:04:14] way we live every day and the choices we
[3:04:16] make every day he says it's out it's
[3:04:18] it's the issue of your heart so my
[3:04:21] prayers Lord I want the and I want that
[3:04:23] virus out of my heart take the virus out
[3:04:25] of my heart today I want to be
[3:04:27] reprogrammed to the original programming
[3:04:29] that Adam had before he fell because
[3:04:30] that program that script when it was
[3:04:33] running had a certain kind of behavior
[3:04:35] that came from in time when the devil
[3:04:37] came in that virus brought a different
[3:04:39] kind of behavior but Lord take us back
[3:04:41] to it was Back to Eden oh fellowship and
[3:04:45] God back to holiness
[3:04:46] the way it wasn't a day of Pentecost
[3:04:48] where the Holy Ghost says just as real
[3:04:50] as when it poured out Peter didn't even
[3:04:52] know he could have been reprogrammed but
[3:04:55] when Peter was reprogrammed he said this
[3:04:56] is that that the prophet Joel spoke
[3:04:58] about Oh my he wasn't afraid of debt he
[3:05:01] was not afraid of persecution why he was
[3:05:03] reprogrammed back to the original back
[3:05:06] to the original programming brother I'm
[3:05:08] excited because that original
[3:05:09] programming cannot die that the results
[3:05:12] were coming is eternal oh when they
[3:05:14] tried to take that original programming
[3:05:16] and put that programming on the cross
[3:05:17] that programming had it built in he said
[3:05:21] destroyed his Temple and then treaties
[3:05:22] are raised back up again there's
[3:05:24] something written in the programming oh
[3:05:27] that you cannot die and even if you fall
[3:05:29] down you're gonna see you in a
[3:05:31] resurrection because that's all part of
[3:05:33] the broken oh I want that programming
[3:05:35] and it comes by the Holy Ghost itself
[3:05:37] living out Living Faith all the way to a
[3:05:40] living charity a new creature a new
[3:05:43] creation and this being when it is
[3:05:45] completed is the being go to the Rapture
[3:05:48] oh I'm looking for the Rapture are you
[3:05:49] are you looking forward to leaving this
[3:05:51] world behind
[3:05:53] leaving the sin behind leaving the Mind
[3:05:56] battles and the back pains and the
[3:05:57] struggles behind people feeling free to
[3:06:00] go out the house the crime or the
[3:06:02] situation but before we leave it'll be
[3:06:04] such a power in your life that when the
[3:06:06] devil sees you he has to cross the
[3:06:08] street because he knows just like when
[3:06:10] Jesus went there those demons that were
[3:06:13] in Legion said have you come to
[3:06:14] tormentors before our time they
[3:06:16] recognize him before he said a word and
[3:06:19] the devil will recognize those who have
[3:06:21] been placed into the body of Christ with
[3:06:24] the fire of God burning in their souls
[3:06:26] so be excited stay on the firing line
[3:06:29] and don't let the devil lie to you you
[3:06:31] are born for this you are built for this
[3:06:33] you are designed for this you are going
[3:06:36] to overcome lift your head up Square
[3:06:38] your shoulders back and say Mama I'm
[3:06:41] Coming Home that eagle to Eagle call
[3:06:43] that mother Eagle was trooping over and
[3:06:46] when that little Eagle saw that mother
[3:06:48] Eagle he said something in my soul
[3:06:50] responded Mama I'm here I'm here and I'm
