[20:10] not the scenes of the prophecy I love an
[20:13] inspiration the time is at hand
[20:17] what praise the name of the Lord you
[20:19] read a quote this morning I was down
[20:20] here seven thunders idle forbidden to
[20:22] write down who the voices and it's book
[20:24] was sealed the mystery of God would be
[20:27] finished in other words God would be
[20:28] known to his church not in three people
[20:30] but as one person the mystery of God
[20:33] will be revealed
[20:34] I hear the part now and when that was
[20:37] completely revealed then the seven
[20:40] mysteries were open to the church he's
[20:43] talking money seven thunders are because
[20:45] India the church prophecy would be
[20:48] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[20:52] Spirit him moving in and out and showing
[20:55] his signs of being alive and a mosque
[20:58] living among us we are then worship in
[21:00] the Living Christ data malas so friends
[21:04] your faith itself must be anointed this
[21:07] currency of purchase which is this faith
[21:09] must be anointed it has to have an
[21:11] applied feet and actually a feet God
[21:14] brother Branham was told people were
[21:17] told if you could get the people to
[21:19] believe that even cancer was done in
[21:21] your way so we have something but I
[21:24] don't think we understand the value of
[21:25] what we have that faith is it purchasing
[21:28] power shoutout purchasing power it's
[21:31] like you have a currency is like you
[21:33] have money it's like I could you need
[21:35] the bread you can't eat the money you'll
[21:37] need to get the bread the money is the
[21:39] purchasing power of the bread if you
[21:42] could get to the bakery you're gonna get
[21:43] the bread but in the meantime you have
[21:45] the pictures in power you could rejoice
[21:47] you can praise God you can
[21:50] you're hungry yes but you can be
[21:52] grateful because you have the purchasing
[21:53] power you are faced as a believer you
[21:56] have the purchasing power for your
[21:58] deliverance for your bridge route to get
[22:00] out of whatever in you have the
[22:02] purchasing power all that you are all
[22:04] that you ever build will be is based
[22:06] upon faith in his word you have to have
[22:08] fear to believe that God will to break
[22:11] you out now go get the bus y'all to
[22:13] watch your in you have to have it to
[22:15] believe that you will be healed you have
[22:17] that fear to believe that you will get a
[22:19] breakthrough
[22:19] that's what will lift you off that
[22:21] depression and that frustration you have
[22:23] that fear to believe that
[22:25] not the client if they believe dots
[22:29] don't believe can snow only believe
[22:31] oh praise the name of the Lord so do you
[22:34] believe that it's promised that he'll be
[22:36] moving in and out among us then we
[22:38] worship in the Living Christ hallelujah
[22:41] john was worship in the angel didn't say
[22:43] don't worship me I want to prophets him
[22:45] and don't worship me isn't that right
[22:47] hallelujah enough Christ to worship so
[22:50] we have no man to worship we come to
[22:52] worship Jesus Christ will begin to see
[22:54] Christ we come to worship Jesus Christ
[22:55] isn't that right so your faith has to be
[22:58] anointed to activate dynamics not just a
[23:02] dry fit it's a resurrection faith isn't
[23:04] that right praise God amen
[23:06] do you believe that so God praise God no
[23:10] listen to this you read this until see
[23:12] I'm moving back again I've tried I've
[23:14] been studying I told before the
[23:16] congregation I've been studying the
[23:18] early church and I watched the way those
[23:20] anointed men prepare the house of the
[23:22] Lord and the order of the Lord worship
[23:24] in the house and it struck me real good
[23:27] and I preached about it some time ago to
[23:29] the subject I'll restore and I begin the
[23:31] study on what these men did and the way
[23:35] they take care of the church that God
[23:37] had left them to overseer now we're
[23:39] going to start off with the early church
[23:40] and just bring it about of five minutes
[23:43] to see what they did and then I can show
[23:45] you
[23:46] isn't the vision that I have for the
[23:49] future now at the beginning the church
[23:51] was inaugurated at Pentecost I'm there
[23:54] the Holy Spirit fell upon them where
[23:56] Jesus are chosen twelve and one of them
[23:59] had fallen and they had to choose my
[24:01] tires to take his place
[24:04] here's the point here's the point now
[24:06] I'm the Holy Spirit waited until all
[24:10] this was in order before it come
[24:14] understand this Judas was the hoff he
[24:17] hung himself so it was 11
[24:19] they had to have 12 a to happy no Paul
[24:23] was ready these twelve men I was gonna
[24:26] find but for dynamics are strike you
[24:29] have to have 12 so they have to pick
[24:31] somebody it have a book of my tires
[24:33] it has nothing about Matias the chief
[24:35] Matthias I'm Matthias make up
[24:37] number twelve and then it was ready it
[24:39] was sent fire could fall no because
[24:42] everything is in order
[24:44] are you with me give the Lord a shout on
[24:45] that one though these are my words
[24:50] though this is a preface world God
[24:51] waited until they get Matthias in
[24:54] position for the fire to fall no this is
[24:57] brother Branham now he said the Holy
[24:58] Spirit waited until all this was in
[25:01] order before it can come they had to
[25:03] choose the bishopric of Judas that fell
[25:05] by transgression to fulfill Scripture
[25:07] and I believe here we go
[25:09] that all these things has a time of
[25:13] lingering waiting but it is waiting for
[25:18] a time for the scripture to be fulfilled
[25:21] till everything gets right everything is
[25:24] in order
[25:24] Wheaton many times like a child we get
[25:27] impatient
[25:28] we have great anticipation and jump
[25:30] where hand and that hinders the work
[25:32] until the work that caught up we must
[25:34] move reverently have a purpose in heart
[25:37] to say if the Lord's will and so forth
[25:40] like that if he desires the users in
[25:42] such a way but wait until he makes an
[25:44] opening David had to hear the rustle of
[25:47] marbury tree he answer no God is going
[25:49] in front of him is not right children
[25:51] then hammocks is here today dynamics is
[25:54] here already in the form of the spirit
[25:57] of prophecy which is the testimony of
[26:00] Jesus and we have that today
[26:02] Oh hallelujah the testimony of Jesus is
[26:06] the spirit of prophecy that gives us the
[26:09] authority to know every devil up the
[26:11] Warner run to give us the authority to
[26:13] see the sick you will deal
[26:16] hallelujah the blind will see the Deaf
[26:18] gonna hear your family will be delivered
[26:21] by the spirit of prophecy that can't
[26:25] return boy you take authority by the
[26:27] word to prophesy from the book the book
[26:31] is already open we have the authority to
[26:33] go into the book and press the sign
[26:36] devil came up basilia notice get off our
[26:40] property get off my land
[26:43] give me my Mountain or give the Lord
[26:46] some praise as people Oh glory of God do
[26:49] you see it
[26:50] hallelujah so you have to go forward now
[26:53] to pick up the authority you haven't
[26:55] gone to claim your Mountain and the
[26:58] criminal inheritance and stop accepting
[27:01] the estate the way out right now oh my
[27:04] oh praise God so we can only prophesy
[27:08] according to the vision loosed by the
[27:10] spirit of prophecy
[27:11] oh my so Abraham received the word and
[27:14] anything was contrary to the world he
[27:17] call it a bit wasn't in other words
[27:20] everything with a lion symptom Sarah
[27:22] each their estates the rock body was
[27:24] lying to him
[27:25] I finally concerned nothing in Compton
[27:27] the Bible said he's tagged on another
[27:28] promise I've got you unbelief listen he
[27:30] had frustrations he had obsessed upside
[27:32] down with everybody else and what you
[27:33] would have but not at the promise
[27:35] because he was convinced the Bible said
[27:38] he was fully persuaded fully persuaded
[27:41] that God was able to perform what he
[27:44] promised
[27:48] tonight you've got to be fully persuaded
[27:50] gotta be convinced if your buddy you're
[27:53] feeling that's not having to do with it
[27:55] I have your foot not feelin it your eye
[27:57] not feeling it you're hot enough you're
[27:59] not feeling it
[28:00] it's not Sheila stop this it's the diva
[28:02] stone this my god I'm believing it's a
[28:05] substance that create the faith
[28:06] I want to sell it believe him it's a
[28:08] substance that create the faith thank
[28:16] you Lord Jesus
[28:17] so Jesus so but about me so back to
[28:20] faith he introduced the Messiah and
[28:22] reveal all the mysteries of God and I
[28:25] want to bring back this one the
[28:26] appearing and coming is another quote
[28:28] the different one of the cities one is
[28:30] two different things the appearing of
[28:31] the Lord is now the appeal appearing
[28:33] among his people we see him in his same
[28:35] work the apparent his Holy Spirit but
[28:37] his common here we go will be his
[28:39] physical being to catch the church up
[28:42] that's the Trump of God his coming his
[28:45] actual common is that right
[28:46] blessed be the name of the Lord want me
[28:48] along with you so there are five
[28:49] spiritual offices in the church to set
[28:52] the church in order apostles prophets
[28:54] teachers evangelists pastors those are
[28:57] called offices by God then in the local
[29:00] congregation there nine spiritual gifts
[29:03] that work among the people which include
[29:05] prophecy tongues interpretations and
[29:07] wisdom knowledge gifts of faith gives up
[29:10] healing all of that now in these offices
[29:12] and places and the offices you hear from
[29:15] the Apostle his ministry you hear from
[29:17] the Prophet his ministry from the
[29:19] evangelists from the teacher from the
[29:21] pasta each has a separate ministry so no
[29:24] matter PAC in all faith either here P my
[29:27] mind claims of all liars because
[29:30] I snuck the scripture it's a separate
[29:32] ministry and that is why God divided the
[29:34] land everybody can have all the land God
[29:37] here Judah here
[29:39] Ephraim here the land is divided the
[29:41] land got to be divided faster here
[29:44] prophet here teacher here evangelist
[29:46] here apostle here land divided
[29:49] to set the church in order you hear from
[29:51] the pasta you hear from the Apostle you
[29:53] hear from the prophet you hear from each
[29:54] ministry because Israel's you have a
[29:56] world to bring you to that perfection or
[29:59] Chloe require a ministry for ministry is
[30:01] a ministry for work what will fall
[30:04] protection of the Saints the work of the
[30:06] ministry for the edifying of the body
[30:08] till we all come in the unity of the
[30:10] faith or praise God isn't that right so
[30:14] then I'm almost done then in these
[30:16] offices and places you hear from the
[30:18] author and so forth each has a separate
[30:19] ministry and their ministries of God go
[30:22] ahead set them in a church for this
[30:24] purpose then God comes down in the form
[30:28] of the holy spirit among his
[30:30] congregation to speak with tongues
