[51:56] like they don't know who God is and who

[53:16] there's no hope you want to get a cocoon
[53:19] and say beat me up
[53:22] I want to go out of here
[53:24] but because of the word
[53:26] that God gave us faith in our Souls
[53:28] praise God in the scripture we read
[53:30] Genesis 29 20 and Jacob saved seven
[53:34] years for Rachel but they seemed to him
[53:37] as a few days because he loved her
[53:41] praise God if you didn't love her
[53:43] but I walk by
[53:45] but because of love
[53:47] seven years was us
[53:49] and this bride I know case 40 years ago

[54:29] hold and put alone more and put brushing
[54:31] Cutlass and have an automatic brushing
[54:33] capacity
[54:35] and then it gave our wind to blow the

[54:47] have to drive them out
[54:48] you have to start now you have to you
[54:51] can't postpone it some people postpone
[54:53] in things don't postpone it say today is
[54:55] my day anyhow
[54:57] let me just see this you know what a
[54:59] blessing to have but Andrew for long
[55:01] yeah suddenly you certainly appreciate
[55:02] him
[55:03] the purpose of God
[55:06] Hallelujah
[55:08] he had about 50 pages of of a PowerPoint
[55:10] notes presentation he put all that aside
[55:12] he didn't get any title
[55:13] but the anointing atmosphere
[55:16] I know that is what's going to happen
[55:18] shortly this
[55:20] Pentecost
[55:21] Peter so he said these people are drunk
[55:24] as you suppose but this is that that the
[55:26] prophet will spake of this is that stone
[55:29] that you Builders refuse
[55:31] he went right back in Psalms 118 and
[55:33] pick up the stone that the pillars
[55:35] refused has become the headstrong of the
[55:37] corner and identified Christ as that's
[55:39] to all glory to God hallelujah praise
[55:41] God on one of these days the anointing
[55:43] on a strike and you'll hear this is that
[55:45] that the prophet William Branham spake
[55:47] of this date this scripture is
[55:50] fulfilling your ears oh give the Lord
[55:53] some Praises all right let's go
[55:56] so the purpose of God
[55:58] purpose of God is to bring a brighter
[56:01] perfection
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:03] not the goddess in church the purpose of
[56:06] God is to bring a bite to perfection
[56:09] the perfection
[56:10] to reconnect and complete the circle of
[56:14] Eternity
[56:15] by removing the king called time
[56:18] the time space interruption in which we
[56:21] are placed here to be tested and tempted
[56:25] one day it will be all over
[56:27] Perfection again back on the Earth as
[56:30] Adam was before the fall
[56:32] brother
[56:34] eternal life has no end because it had
[56:35] no beginning it never can die because it
[56:38] was never born it had no beginning of
[56:39] days or enough time now the only way we
[56:42] can live eternally is through receiving
[56:45] something that is eternal
[56:46] and God before there was anything it was
[56:49] God God never had a beginning on end and
[56:52] God was this great spirit and we
[56:54] pictured him here seven colors of the
[56:56] rainbow that covers watch But as God is
[57:00] eternal and he was the perfect perfect
[57:03] love there we go perfect peace perfect
[57:07] Joy perfect satisfaction all those seven
[57:11] spirits as we get in Revelation they
[57:13] come out what's made up God was
[57:15] perfection
[57:17] he's saying the seven spirits was God
[57:19] made up
[57:22] Perfection and everything else outside
[57:24] of
[57:25] sight of something perverted from that
[57:27] so what we have here is a perfect
[57:29] message
[57:30] perfect word
[57:32] perfect rainbow God almighty
[57:35] Hallelujah that Perfection let's go here
[57:39] we go and the only way we can come back
[57:42] to Perfection is to come after that
[57:45] Perfection which is God
[57:48] so in the beginning was the word but
[57:50] before the beginning was the rainbow
[57:52] which is the spirit which is that
[57:54] Perfection so he's saying you have to go
[57:56] back to before the beginning so God is
[57:59] not know right in your name because
[58:00] you'll be even good
[58:01] and because you're fine he's put your
[58:03] name on the book first and then put you
[58:05] on the earth to be tested and tempted
[58:07] knowing the devil could watch but can't
[58:08] touch and even if he touch he can't
[58:11] touch the seed the germ
[58:14] he attribute that God put inside of you
[58:16] your father didn't protect your mother
[58:18] didn't put it it's not a natural
[58:20] attribute your mother gave your face and
[58:23] hands and that kind of thing like a
[58:24] mother and father but the attribute
[58:25] inside of you to respond to the word God
[58:28] himself put that inside of you
[58:30] so Jesus could say all that the father
[58:33] had given me will come oh believe the
[58:36] Lord I shout
[58:37] he will find you
[58:40] he will get you
[58:42] so the only way we can come back to
[58:44] Perfection is to come back with that
[58:47] Perfection which is God then we come to
[58:50] Perfection and then we have eternal life
[58:52] we don't end without anything just
[58:54] forever eternalize
[58:56] and the tip I want to put on this
[58:58] morning is a tape called the Perfection
[58:59] by William Brother Brown Prophet Prophet
[59:02] William Brown about they call him now
[59:03] Prophet William Branham
[59:07] in this message is a key for you
[59:10] don't let that leave you know the Pastor
[59:12] said there's a key for me I want that
[59:14] key
[59:14] there's a key for deliverance and
[59:16] breakthrough because you can perfect
[59:17] yourself
[59:19] you can bring yourself to perfection
[59:21] oh praise God so watch
[59:23] this is two things that pull out from
[59:25] the message and you're gonna hear it
[59:27] friends there are so many things that we
[59:29] could sit at night about the perfection
[59:32] we are always trying to gouge the eyes
[59:35] out of somebody else
[59:37] to make ourselves a little holier than
[59:40] they are
[59:41] but if we only look at the picture
[59:43] it is only God's grace
[59:46] that we are what we are
[59:49] that's what everybody
[59:50] from Pulpit the back bench and the last
[59:53] one
[59:54] as we get ready to put that tape on
[59:56] what is it
[59:58] God requires perfection
[1:00:01] I want to say it after me God
[1:00:03] requires
[1:00:05] perfection
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:08] he requires your repentance
[1:00:12] requires
[1:00:14] they'll say I angry repent no he
[1:00:16] requires it
[1:00:18] he requires your loyalty to him
[1:00:21] he is looking tonight here we go no
[1:00:24] matter how much you have sinned
[1:00:26] how little
[1:00:27] or how much I wonder sometimes everybody
[1:00:29] hear this what goes through their mind
[1:00:31] when they hear in this because you see
[1:00:33] you have to believe this you know you
[1:00:35] can't believe you you know
[1:00:37] you have to believe what God Said
[1:00:40] no matter how much you have sinned how
[1:00:43] little or how much you are still a
[1:00:45] sinner
[1:00:47] and cannot get in no other way but by
[1:00:49] Jesus Christ
[1:00:51] foolishness
[1:00:56] only
[1:00:57] Jesus Christ
[1:00:59] all right God all sufficient sacrifice
[1:01:02] and in him
[1:01:04] you're perfected forever
[1:01:06] think of it it is nothing you do
[1:01:09] it is not new pages you turn it is not a
[1:01:13] new life you start
[1:01:15] are you ready it's a confession of your
[1:01:18] wrong
[1:01:19] from your mom
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:21] a confession of your wrong and God's
[1:01:24] grace to you that brings you to
[1:01:27] perfection
[1:01:28] then you are perfected in Jesus Christ
[1:01:32] all of us at the same level
[1:01:35] all of us need the same blood
[1:01:37] all of us God requires Perfection from
[1:01:40] the pulpit to the back bench there is
[1:01:42] none righteous no not one
[1:01:44] it takes a confession of you wrong and
[1:01:46] the grace of God to bring you to
[1:01:49] Perfection so I want you to pump amen
[1:01:51] and praise God and Shout at this message
[1:01:53] this morning could we all stand as you
[1:01:56] want to go straight into the tape this
[1:01:58] morning thank you so much musicians
[1:02:00] praise the Lord amen
[1:02:09] now let us pray just a moment blessed
[1:02:13] Lord Thy word is truth amen and we're
[1:02:17] thankful for a man who handle it
[1:02:19] Fearless as they give it out to the
[1:02:22] people and as we open up the Bible
[1:02:26] tonight or turn back its pages may the
[1:02:29] Blessed Holy Ghost come and open the
[1:02:32] word of understanding to us through
[1:02:35] Jesus Christ we asked it amen
[1:02:41] this great night that we are celebrating
[1:02:44] of the crucifixion of our blessed Lord
[1:02:49] I wish to read the night from his own
[1:02:52] precious lips the words that he has
[1:02:56] had written in his book in Saint
[1:03:00] Matthews the fourth chapter we and the
[1:03:04] 47th and 48th verse we read this
[1:03:10] and it's you salute your brethren only
[1:03:14] what do you more than others do not even
[1:03:18] the Publican soul
[1:03:20] but be therefore perfect even as your
[1:03:26] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:03:30] and tonight we gave out that we were
[1:03:33] going to speak on the subject of
[1:03:36] perfection
[1:03:38] now we that seems like a very strange
[1:03:43] text to take for the night of the
[1:03:45] crucifixion of Our Lord but today
[1:03:49] perhaps you've been listening to the
[1:03:51] radio and hear the different messages
[1:03:54] and The Messengers how they presented
[1:03:57] that great awful day when our Lord died
[1:04:02] for the sins of the world so I have
[1:04:05] chosen tonight to go around a different
[1:04:07] way to get to it
[1:04:10] so it would be a little different and
[1:04:13] might refreshing you a little May the
[1:04:16] Blessed Holy Spirit Inspire the word now
[1:04:19] as we take the effort to bring it
[1:04:23] God
[1:04:25] requires Perfection we want to bear that
[1:04:29] in mind
[1:04:31] that there's nothing just part way
[1:04:35] can go in the presence of God it must be
[1:04:39] perfect
[1:04:41] our worship everything
[1:04:44] I am in the Garden of Eden
[1:04:47] God add Adam and Eve in the garden
[1:04:51] and they sinned and transgress the laws
[1:04:55] of God
[1:04:57] by sinning disobedience
[1:05:00] and when transgression comes
[1:05:03] disobedience is the transgression of the
[1:05:07] law
[1:05:08] and the law of God him being holy
[1:05:13] just unadulterated holy
[1:05:17] therefore no spot of unholiness can ever
[1:05:21] stand in his presence amen
[1:05:25] so if sin came in the world by
[1:05:28] transgression
[1:05:29] then sin must be dealt with
[1:05:33] before the sinner can ever stand in the
[1:05:37] presence of God
[1:05:40] now
[1:05:43] if there is no law then there is no
[1:05:47] justice
[1:05:49] but Law requires Justice requires a law
[1:05:56] and the law when it is it is uh recalled
[1:06:01] on IT projects Justice
[1:06:05] now by the law no flesh is safe
[1:06:09] now the law cannot say this
[1:06:13] the law was just the thing that put us
[1:06:16] in jail
[1:06:17] but it has no redeeming power
[1:06:21] the law only showed us that we were
[1:06:24] Sinners and condemned this
[1:06:27] that's what law is to do it's the brain
[1:06:31] condemnation
[1:06:34] or to show you where your mistake is
[1:06:38] so the law in itself could not save
[1:06:42] It could only prosecute
[1:06:46] and God being holy and just he had to
[1:06:51] have a prosecution
[1:06:54] he had to prosecute The Sinner
[1:06:57] because he had overstepped the bounties
[1:07:01] of Grace
[1:07:02] and had become a law breaking citizen
[1:07:08] then he must be dealt with
[1:07:12] and that every law has a penalty
[1:07:16] for
[1:07:18] the penalty of transgressing God's law
[1:07:22] is death
[1:07:25] and it had to project death to the human
[1:07:29] race
[1:07:31] and all of the human races under the
[1:07:35] penalty of this law
[1:07:40] now when Adam and Eve had sinned there
[1:07:45] was no way no other remedy
[1:07:50] that they could ever stand in the
[1:07:53] presence of God again except this sin be
[1:07:58] dealt with
[1:08:00] and no man can commit a sin
[1:08:04] of any type no matter how little or how
[1:08:08] big that individual sin has to be dealt
[1:08:13] with
[1:08:14] for the one who committed it can ever
[1:08:18] stand in the presence of the holy God
[1:08:23] so therefore when Adam and Eve had
[1:08:27] sinned and it transgressed the law they
[1:08:31] were subjects of death
[1:08:34] and the law had to be executed
[1:08:38] therefore it put all the human race
[1:08:41] under the penalty of death
[1:08:46] now if we can only settle down for a few
[1:08:50] moments now in our thinking
[1:08:54] and look at this great picture and
[1:08:58] remember that every person here is
[1:09:01] included in this
[1:09:04] every man and woman
[1:09:07] child is included in the penalty of
[1:09:12] death by the transgression of the head
[1:09:15] of the human race
[1:09:16] Adam
[1:09:18] by his transgression every one of us
[1:09:21] fell victim to sin
[1:09:24] and sin must be dealt with
[1:09:30] and so God in his great
[1:09:33] infancy and his great love
[1:09:37] the law was to separate The Sinner from
[1:09:42] his maker
[1:09:44] then he become annihilated
[1:09:47] and totally annihilated
[1:09:50] there would be no way for him to ever
[1:09:54] come back unless that sin was dealt with
[1:10:01] and it would be very easy then
[1:10:04] to believe in a total annihilation of
[1:10:08] The Sinner at the end
[1:10:10] for he is completely forever
[1:10:13] separated from the presence of God
[1:10:19] now notice
[1:10:20] this sin
[1:10:23] and how God being just and he could do
[1:10:28] nothing else but be just
[1:10:30] for he is the resource of all Justice
[1:10:36] then there would be nothing else for him
[1:10:38] to do but to place the penalty for this
[1:10:42] transgression
[1:10:43] and the penalty was death for he said
[1:10:47] the day you eat thereof that day thou
[1:10:51] shall surely die
[1:10:55] now it's a dark picture we have here
[1:10:59] but then if we go back just a little
[1:11:02] further
[1:11:04] and find out the very attributes of God
[1:11:09] the Bible plainly tells us that God is
[1:11:13] love
[1:11:16] but yet being love he has to be just
[1:11:21] so love does not mean just the thing
[1:11:25] that can be petted and played with
[1:11:29] foreign
[1:11:37] now when God seen that his children had
[1:11:42] transgressed his law and that they must
[1:11:46] die the death
[1:11:48] then Sovereign Love stepped in to make a
[1:11:54] way
[1:11:56] for God seen that these children was to
[1:12:00] be absolutely totally annihilated from
[1:12:04] his presence
[1:12:06] there was nothing else to be done
[1:12:10] for they are transgressed his law and
[1:12:14] the penalty of his law was death
[1:12:18] and then love of God went out for his
[1:12:23] subjects and when Divine love is
[1:12:27] projected
[1:12:28] Sovereign Grace produces the object of
[1:12:32] the love
[1:12:35] and God by foreknowledge
[1:12:38] when he loved this race so well yet with
[1:12:43] the penalty he calls the substitutionary
[1:12:46] death to take place in the Garden of
[1:12:49] Eden amen that was he substituted an
[1:12:54] innocent creature a Little Lamb that no
[1:12:59] no sin
[1:13:01] and it went for a substitute
[1:13:06] to work and to die in the state of the
[1:13:11] guilty Sinner
[1:13:13] and it was a lamb slaying to hold the
[1:13:19] life of his subjects
[1:13:24] all through the Old Testament they
[1:13:27] offered the blood of lambs and goats
[1:13:31] sheep Bulls the heifers
[1:13:35] a subductionary death
[1:13:39] but all in the great economy of God
[1:13:42] there was back in his mind the real
[1:13:47] object coming which would be them were
[1:13:52] Shadows of the real object that was to
[1:13:56] come
[1:13:58] I am the real object was to come was his
[1:14:01] only begotten son
[1:14:06] all the Lambs that die first only a
[1:14:09] shadow
[1:14:11] and a shadow is only the negative side
[1:14:15] of an object
[1:14:17] and they only spoke of Calvary coming
[1:14:24] now for a picture of this let's turn in
[1:14:27] our Bibles
[1:14:29] to the book of Hebrews
[1:14:31] and pick up your what Paul
[1:14:34] the great Apostle speaking trying to
[1:14:38] separate these things for us
[1:14:41] in the 10th chapter of the book of
[1:14:45] Hebrews we read this and I just love the
[1:14:49] word amen the word is the truth amen and
[1:14:53] I like to read it before my congregation
[1:14:56] because I know that in the Judgment I'll
[1:15:00] stand with them now I've got to give an
[1:15:04] account
[1:15:05] so if I bring it from the word
[1:15:09] then I'll not be guilty because it's the
[1:15:13] word and God's responsible for his word
[1:15:18] we see so much today
[1:15:21] of evangelists and so forth filling up
[1:15:24] around personalities
[1:15:26] oh it's a disgraceful thing
[1:15:30] and we find out in going into churches
[1:15:33] we go into church and you find a certain
[1:15:37] Pastor he's got some little peculiar act
[1:15:41] about him
[1:15:42] some little emotion if you don't notice
[1:15:46] the entire congregation will take that
[1:15:49] Spirit
[1:15:52] if he's just a little emotional or jerks
[1:15:55] his head or some little odd thing well
[1:15:58] the whole church will take on to that
[1:16:01] and we've got today in our modern
[1:16:04] churches to work it's Sensations and
[1:16:07] little things like that and it's got
[1:16:09] such a confusion
[1:16:12] but all my beloved Brethren if there
[1:16:16] ever was a time
[1:16:18] that we ought to be on the word it's the
[1:16:22] day
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:26] you see I would hate to stand at the
[1:16:29] judgment and know that I had some little
[1:16:32] fickle this something I will lose
[1:16:35] peculiar Revelation and misled people I
[1:16:40] don't want them to have him my spirit
[1:16:43] all my action but I want him to have
[1:16:46] God's spirit by God's word
[1:16:50] that produces truth
[1:16:53] so on this great occasion tonight I
[1:16:58] would like to read from God's Eternal
[1:17:01] Word
[1:17:03] now we realize
[1:17:05] that the law existed for many years but
[1:17:11] the law could never take away sin as
[1:17:15] I've said in the past it was just a
[1:17:19] jailhouse it was the great detective
[1:17:24] that told you what you had done but had
[1:17:28] no remedy to deliver you it puts you in
[1:17:32] the pawn shop
[1:17:34] but there was no Redeemer to take you
[1:17:38] out with it it only prisons you to let
[1:17:43] you know that you was a sinner
[1:17:46] but now notice in Hebrews the 10th
[1:17:49] chapter as we read
[1:17:51] for the law having a shadow
[1:17:54] of good things to come and not the very
[1:17:59] image remember it was a shadow
[1:18:05] of an image to come
[1:18:09] a shadow only introduces that there is a
[1:18:15] image making the shadow
[1:18:19] a shadow of the things to come and not
[1:18:24] the very image
[1:18:26] notice
[1:18:28] all the things
[1:18:31] the very image of the things can never
[1:18:35] with those sacrifices
[1:18:38] which were offered
[1:18:40] continually make the comma unto perfect
[1:18:46] now God in the beginning required
[1:18:51] Perfection man
[1:18:54] Jesus when he come to Earth said be ye
[1:18:58] perfect
[1:19:00] like God in heaven is perfect
[1:19:04] and the law having a shadow of things to
[1:19:08] come could never make the worshiper
[1:19:11] perfect
[1:19:14] you got the picture now
[1:19:20] let's go it again so you'll be sure not
[1:19:23] to miss it
[1:19:25] God requires perfect Holiness
[1:19:32] no one can stand in His image with one
[1:19:36] little speck of sin
[1:19:41] Jesus witnessed the same and said be
[1:19:44] perfect just like God in heaven is
[1:19:47] perfect
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:51] and the Bible said that the law could
[1:19:55] never with its sacrifices make the
[1:19:58] calmer perfect
[1:20:01] then the law could not perfect anything
[1:20:07] it was only a pointer
[1:20:12] these sacrifices made every year could
[1:20:16] never make the worshiper perfect so
[1:20:19] therefore no one under the law or
[1:20:21] keeping of laws are under the shadows
[1:20:24] could be perfect
[1:20:28] for second verse
[1:20:31] then would they not have ceased to been
[1:20:35] offered
[1:20:38] if there is anything that I can do
[1:20:43] to make myself perfect in the presence
[1:20:46] of God then Christ did not have to die
[1:20:50] for me
[1:20:52] if there's one thing that you can do
[1:20:57] that would Merit anything in the
[1:21:00] presence of God
[1:21:01] then Christ died in vain
[1:21:06] no law keeping no legalistic ideas of
[1:21:11] yours none of your own holiness
[1:21:15] no things that you could quit doing quit
[1:21:19] lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco
[1:21:22] quit going to the picture shows still
[1:21:25] you are lost
[1:21:30] nothing can do it joining churches
[1:21:34] rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of
[1:21:38] the church breeding of priests saying of
[1:21:42] prayers all those things would count
[1:21:46] nothing
[1:21:49] you are lost
[1:21:51] not one thing can you do in yourself
[1:21:57] for you are a sinner
[1:22:01] under condemnation
[1:22:05] and there's not no way within yourself
[1:22:09] or any Creed
[1:22:12] or any thing that you could do or think
[1:22:17] of of yourself that could Merit one
[1:22:20] thing in the presence of God Amen
[1:22:23] because you are a sinner to start with
[1:22:28] and the Bible declares that we were all
[1:22:32] born in sin
[1:22:36] shaped in iniquity
[1:22:38] come to the world speaking live
[1:22:44] and God could not take one man to die
[1:22:48] for the other
[1:22:49] because one is just as guilty as the
[1:22:54] other amen
[1:22:57] in the presence of God
[1:23:00] the Archbishop born in this world was as
[1:23:04] guilty as the lowest barfi in the city
[1:23:08] amen
[1:23:09] one can not atone for the other
[1:23:15] therefore he took an innocent life of an
[1:23:19] animal
[1:23:20] a Little Lamb
[1:23:23] and under the Old Testament the law was
[1:23:26] when a man sinned
[1:23:28] he brought the lamb to the altar
[1:23:32] say if he transgressed any of The
[1:23:36] Commandments
[1:23:37] he brought the lamb
[1:23:39] and he laid it on the altar
[1:23:42] he laid his hands up on the land
[1:23:46] and he
[1:23:48] confessed these sins that he was wrong
[1:23:52] and know that he was guilty
[1:23:55] of and was the law required death
[1:24:00] and he brought the lamb and he stood
[1:24:03] and when he the throat of the little
[1:24:06] animal was cut
[1:24:08] and it's beginning to kick its little
[1:24:10] feet and blading if you've ever seen a
[1:24:15] lamb slaughtered
[1:24:17] what a pitiful cry
[1:24:20] the poor little fellow trying to Blake
[1:24:23] and his little jumper veins cut
[1:24:27] and as he kicks and squibbers
[1:24:31] and as he straightens out then Quivers
[1:24:35] again and Blakes in the blood gushes
[1:24:39] it batheses little wool and the
[1:24:43] worshiper's hands
[1:24:45] and as the worshiper realizing for
[1:24:49] committing adultery for lying stealing
[1:24:53] whatever is guilt laws
[1:24:57] or even evil thinking
[1:25:01] whatever it was in the least Shadow he
[1:25:05] was guilty
[1:25:08] because it was his nature
[1:25:12] he was a guilty person not maybe by
[1:25:16] bizarre but by Nature he was guilty
[1:25:22] and he had to recognize that this
[1:25:25] innocent little lamb died in his place
[1:25:29] and he felt sorry for the little thing
[1:25:33] but the man as soon as the lamb finally
[1:25:36] died
[1:25:37] with the blood of the Lamb upon his
[1:25:39] hands he walked from the building with
[1:25:43] the same desire in his heart they had at
[1:25:47] the beginning
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] why
[1:25:51] because the light that was in the little
[1:25:54] lamb
[1:25:56] light plays in the blood
[1:25:59] your life is in your blood
[1:26:02] we know that
[1:26:03] and the life in the blood of the Lamb
[1:26:07] was animal life
[1:26:09] therefore when it's little car puzzles
[1:26:13] were broken and the life went out of the
[1:26:16] animal
[1:26:18] it could not come back to the worshiper
[1:26:21] because the worshiper was a human being
[1:26:26] all right
[1:26:27] the blood made a covering
[1:26:30] but it could not perfectly atone for the
[1:26:35] man left the building with the same
[1:26:37] desire to sin as he had in the first
[1:26:41] place
[1:26:41] all right
[1:26:43] but doing this he was looking forward to
[1:26:48] a time when there would be a perfect
[1:26:52] land come
[1:26:56] and he did it on the burnt offering
[1:26:59] because it was the only way he knew
[1:27:03] about
[1:27:06] so you see when the blood was pouring
[1:27:09] and the life went from the animal it
[1:27:12] could not come back to the man for one
[1:27:15] was animals one was man an innocent
[1:27:19] animal to a guilty man
[1:27:22] but oh one day
[1:27:26] some 2 000 years ago
[1:27:30] the Lamb of God was born down in a
[1:27:33] little manger
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:35] in Bethlehem and was led like a sheep to
[1:27:40] its Slaughter some 1900 years ago this
[1:27:44] afternoon at three o'clock
[1:27:50] Lamb of God hung on calories Crossing
[1:27:54] died forever sinner amen
[1:27:56] now when the worshiper comes to this
[1:28:02] Lamb by faith
[1:28:05] and this is a different type of land
[1:28:09] amen it's not a lamb like the other no
[1:28:13] man can come to this lamb except God
[1:28:17] draws him first
[1:28:20] you seek God's sovereignty
[1:28:23] oh wow I hope this soaked way down deep
[1:28:27] now am I look
[1:28:30] God knowed he had sheep in this world he
[1:28:35] knowed he was going to have people to be
[1:28:38] saved
[1:28:39] and his love looked down and seen those
[1:28:42] who would be saved therefore by for
[1:28:46] knowledge he predestinated a church to
[1:28:50] meet another without spot or a rainbow
[1:28:54] and if God required a church without
[1:28:57] spot or ankle he had to have something
[1:29:00] to make it that way
[1:29:03] he could not require it his Justice his
[1:29:07] judgments could not let him ask such a
[1:29:10] thing if there wasn't a way to make it
[1:29:13] forever and men cannot do it in himself
[1:29:19] amen he's a total failure God let him
[1:29:23] see that through the law to the judges
[1:29:25] and to all the Old Testament he sent the
[1:29:29] prophets he sent the righteous man and
[1:29:32] they found out that every one failed
[1:29:36] amen so God by his Sovereign Grace
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:42] sent from the portals of Glory his only
[1:29:46] begotten son take our place
[1:29:50] remember if he'd have said for the pope
[1:29:54] of Rome to take it he could not have
[1:29:57] done it
[1:29:58] amen if it has set for the Archbishop of
[1:30:02] Canterbury to do it he could not have
[1:30:04] done it
[1:30:06] amen if he would have thought on the
[1:30:09] most holy Reverend father or Bishop of
[1:30:14] the world Amen he could not have done it
[1:30:18] he had been just as far rejected as
[1:30:22] Judas is characters amen
[1:30:25] he could not do it because he was born
[1:30:30] in sin and shaped in iniquity come to
[1:30:34] the world speaking lies and needed
[1:30:36] atonement for himself
[1:30:38] amen hallelujah
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:43] but there came one from the portals of
[1:30:47] Glory
[1:30:49] none other not a man
[1:30:53] not a good man
[1:30:55] neither a tuner a gentile
[1:30:58] he was nothing less than
[1:31:02] almighty God hidden human flesh
[1:31:07] he came himself to offer his own blood
[1:31:14] for it did not come to sex
[1:31:19] sex had nothing to do with it
[1:31:22] but he overshadowed a virgin and brought
[1:31:27] forth from a blood cell that he created
[1:31:29] himself
[1:31:31] amen
[1:31:33] the innocent one then my salvation yours
[1:31:38] tonight does not hinge upon the merits
[1:31:41] of our own actions
[1:31:47] hello almighty God who had chosen us
[1:31:54] certainly I could never be perfect nor
[1:31:57] you could never be perfect and we don't
[1:32:00] claim to be perfect but we have this one
[1:32:04] consolation that our faith rests in a
[1:32:08] perfect sacrifice that's already been
[1:32:11] received
[1:32:14] then how do we know that we get that
[1:32:17] when the worshiper puts his hands by
[1:32:21] faith upon the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:27] and feels the pair of sin and the mark
[1:32:32] of spit in his own face
[1:32:35] feels the groanings of Gethsemane the
[1:32:39] agonies of Calvary and those that he's
[1:32:43] guilty
[1:32:44] and confesses his sins correctly oh
[1:32:49] blessed Lord
[1:32:52] I am guilty
[1:32:54] and I have no other way but you to help
[1:32:59] me
[1:33:00] and by faith you're bidding the Holy
[1:33:05] Spirit has come
[1:33:07] and beats me come and I'm now by faith
[1:33:11] except Jesus as my personal savior am I
[1:33:16] that life that come from him on Calvary
[1:33:19] called the Holy Ghost which was hid in
[1:33:22] the blood cell of the Lord Jesus returns
[1:33:26] to the worshiper and baptizes him with
[1:33:29] the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:33:32] amen and he's already judged amen you
[1:33:37] don't have to worry about judgment
[1:33:39] as I turn and look at that little
[1:33:41] crucifix
[1:33:43] I realize that that is represents his
[1:33:48] body
[1:33:49] and now that body has already been
[1:33:54] judged
[1:33:55] God take justly judge it again for it's
[1:33:59] already judged amen
[1:34:02] God struck the judgments of death upon
[1:34:06] that body
[1:34:08] and as long as I can find a way
[1:34:14] hit in that body amen his judgment was
[1:34:19] struck for me and for you
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:25] one
[1:34:28] one condemnation that them that are in
[1:34:32] Christ Jesus that walk not into the
[1:34:35] flesh but
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:41] no condemnation
[1:34:44] I don't care what comes or what goes you
[1:34:48] are HID beneath the blood
[1:34:52] again how do we get into that body First
[1:34:56] Corinthians 12 13.
[1:34:59] says that by one spirit
[1:35:03] how does the Spirit come to the
[1:35:05] sacrifice
[1:35:07] where did the spirit lay within the
[1:35:10] blood
[1:35:11] why couldn't the animal come back it was
[1:35:13] an animal
[1:35:15] the animal spirit could not come to the
[1:35:17] human spirit and do anything to it
[1:35:19] because the human Spirit was a higher
[1:35:23] line of life than the animal
[1:35:26] but no other man's Spirit could come
[1:35:30] back
[1:35:31] if you've got the spirit of some
[1:35:33] ancestor it's spiritualism yeah but God
[1:35:37] himself came that his own Spirit which
[1:35:42] is the highest line of spirit there is
[1:35:45] can come back by the form of the baptism
[1:35:49] of the Holy Spirit do the worshiper to
[1:35:52] the blood of Christ and take him into
[1:35:54] the body Heaven he's safe watch
[1:36:00] the blood of bulls and goats would not
[1:36:02] work
[1:36:03] seeing it was weak now let's start
[1:36:06] reading about the 12th verse
[1:36:10] all right
[1:36:12] but blood of bulls and goats cannot work
[1:36:15] neither could it atone watch but this
[1:36:19] man what man
[1:36:22] the bishop
[1:36:24] know the pope no
[1:36:28] but
[1:36:29] this man after he offered one sacrifice
[1:36:34] for sin forever
[1:36:38] sit down at the right hand of God Amen
[1:36:44] from its fourth expectant though his
[1:36:48] enemies be made his footstool are you
[1:36:51] ready
[1:36:52] are you ready for the word
[1:36:55] listen to this
[1:36:57] they don't want you to let it sink down
[1:37:00] listen closely
[1:37:03] far by one offering not year by year not
[1:37:09] Revival after Revival
[1:37:11] not needing after meeting not day after
[1:37:14] day
[1:37:15] but by one offering he has
[1:37:20] p-e-r-f-e-c-t-e-d
[1:37:22] they have he has
[1:37:25] by one offering he has perfected that's
[1:37:30] God's requirement forever then that are
[1:37:34] Sanctified
[1:37:38] there you are that's the answer to the
[1:37:41] death of Christ that's the answer to
[1:37:43] Calvary he absolutely with his own blood
[1:37:48] purchased our sins and perfected forever
[1:37:52] his believers
[1:37:54] therefore in Christ We Stand blameless
[1:37:59] thank you in the presence of God
[1:38:03] Almighty amen amen we are
[1:38:06] underprivileged people with our own
[1:38:08] doctrines
[1:38:10] we are being taught that we have to get
[1:38:12] up to a certain place we have to do a
[1:38:14] certain thing no my brother it's nothing
[1:38:18] you've done it's what God did for you
[1:38:22] we are now if we are justified by faith
[1:38:26] we are perfected forever in the presence
[1:38:29] of God
[1:38:31] amen then Jesus said be therefore
[1:38:34] perfect then it was perfected forever
[1:38:36] God through the death of Christ 1900
[1:38:40] years ago today perfected the believer
[1:38:44] that he forced all before the foundation
[1:38:46] world forever and those who he has
[1:38:49] called he has Justified
[1:38:51] those who eat 4 News he has called those
[1:38:56] who he has called he has Justified those
[1:38:59] who he has Justified he has already
[1:39:02] glorified
[1:39:04] he has perfected his Believers now watch
[1:39:09] this go back now to the first verse
[1:39:13] the law having a shed of good things to
[1:39:15] come
[1:39:17] and not the very image of those things
[1:39:20] can never with those
[1:39:23] sacrifices which were offered year by
[1:39:26] year continue make the calmer onto
[1:39:29] perfect what's Perfect's what we're
[1:39:31] talking about
[1:39:33] far then they should not have
[1:39:36] ceased to be offered
[1:39:40] because that the worshiper once purged
[1:39:45] would have no more conscience of sin
[1:39:49] what do you mean the word conscience
[1:39:52] there and right interpretation is desire
[1:39:55] and if a man comes to worship it
[1:39:58] correctly before Christ seeing you
[1:40:00] suffering and he offers himself to
[1:40:03] Christ
[1:40:04] and says oh Lord God there's nothing in
[1:40:06] me that can atone but I'm holy depending
[1:40:10] on you
[1:40:13] then that Holy Spirit comes into the
[1:40:17] human heart the very sin questions
[1:40:20] settle forever
[1:40:22] forever desire of sin has been taken
[1:40:25] from you
[1:40:27] for if the law could have done that then
[1:40:30] sacrifices would not have deceased but
[1:40:33] being that it could not do it Christ had
[1:40:35] to die
[1:40:37] to make us perfect
[1:40:39] friends there is so many things that we
[1:40:43] could say tonight about the profession
[1:40:45] we are always trying to gouge the eyes
[1:40:48] out of somebody else to make ourselves
[1:40:50] just a little holier than they are they
[1:40:52] are
[1:40:53] but if we only looked at the picture
[1:40:55] it's only God's grace that we are what
[1:40:57] we are
[1:41:05] I was having a meeting down in Ohio
[1:41:09] and I was staying out in the country
[1:41:11] because of the masses I cannot stay in
[1:41:14] the city we've been eating at a little
[1:41:17] dunkard restaurant and such lovely
[1:41:20] little waitresses and decently dressed
[1:41:23] and clean as they could be very ladylike
[1:41:25] waited on us it was a little spot of
[1:41:28] Heaven
[1:41:30] so eat in such a place their kitchen was
[1:41:34] and span
[1:41:36] and on Sunday they closed up and they
[1:41:40] went to their Church
[1:41:42] I got a little hungry I was going to
[1:41:44] preach Sunday afternoon and I went over
[1:41:48] to an ordinary little
[1:41:50] just the common Little American
[1:41:52] restaurant
[1:41:54] to get something to eat and when I
[1:41:57] walked in the door what did I hear but a
[1:42:00] slot machine going
[1:42:02] and was staying there a man of my age
[1:42:05] which perhaps was a married man with his
[1:42:09] arm around a woman playing a slot
[1:42:12] machine
[1:42:13] are very low the protection of our
[1:42:18] righteousness of our Goods was standing
[1:42:21] there violating a thing that he is
[1:42:22] supposed to be protected because it's
[1:42:25] illegal to gamble in Ohio
[1:42:28] playing a slot machine
[1:42:31] and I turned and looked towards the back
[1:42:33] of the building there was a bunch of
[1:42:36] teenage boys in an old rock and roll
[1:42:39] records on the machine playing
[1:42:42] a young lady of about 18 years old very
[1:42:45] neatly uh unlearned Manatee as a woman
[1:42:50] but she was standing there with her
[1:42:52] dress hanging low in the front and one
[1:42:55] of those boys with his hands on the girl
[1:42:58] where they did not belong and they were
[1:43:01] smoking and drinking
[1:43:03] now for oh God how can you stand it
[1:43:09] and I looked over to my right when I
[1:43:12] heard someone make out a big groan and
[1:43:15] there said an aged woman probably 60
[1:43:18] years or 70 years old
[1:43:21] she had on those little old vulgar
[1:43:23] clothes just about halfway upper limbs
[1:43:28] and her poor old wrinkled flesh was just
[1:43:31] as flabby as it could be
[1:43:34] and she had on this shirt lip makeup and
[1:43:38] a great big purple thing on the side of
[1:43:40] her face painted a little pair of shoes
[1:43:43] on sandals with purple toenails painted
[1:43:47] purple fingernails painted and her hair
[1:43:51] was cut real short and curled up and
[1:43:53] dyed blue and I looked at her and across
[1:43:58] the table set to man drunk
[1:44:01] one of them it was summertime with a big
[1:44:04] old army over coat on with a gray scarf
[1:44:07] wrapped around his neck and if whiskers
[1:44:10] all over his face up belching and going
[1:44:13] on
[1:44:15] and they excuse herself the man did from
[1:44:18] her and started walking out like this to
[1:44:21] the restroom
[1:44:23] I stood there and I said God why don't
[1:44:28] you destroy the whole thing why don't
[1:44:31] you just sink it beneath the Earth
[1:44:34] I said is my little Sarah and Rebecca
[1:44:38] going to have to grow up under such
[1:44:40] stuff is that
[1:44:42] I said how can you God in your great
[1:44:46] Holiness ever stand to look at such a
[1:44:50] thing like that and not send an
[1:44:52] earthquake and sink it
[1:44:54] as I was staying there condemning the
[1:44:57] woman as I was
[1:44:59] I stepped back behind the door I felt
[1:45:02] the spirit of God come to me
[1:45:06] and I stepped behind the door and I seen
[1:45:08] like something twirling and when it was
[1:45:12] in the vision it was a world turning
[1:45:14] around and around
[1:45:17] and as a notice around the world was a
[1:45:20] Scarlet Street around the world and as I
[1:45:25] got to the world I seen myself just a
[1:45:29] little boy doing things that I ought not
[1:45:31] to do maybe not like that but it was sin
[1:45:36] and every time I did anything I've seen
[1:45:40] that great black shadow go towards
[1:45:42] heaven which God would have killed me at
[1:45:45] that minute
[1:45:46] then I seen standing between me and God
[1:45:50] stood that perfect sacrifice
[1:45:54] I've seen him standing there with the
[1:45:57] thorns on his head and the spit hanging
[1:46:00] on his face
[1:46:02] and every time my sins would start
[1:46:04] towards God he'd reach out and catch it
[1:46:08] like the bumper on the car he was
[1:46:11] protecting me from death and every time
[1:46:14] I'd do anything wrong God would have
[1:46:16] killed me certainly his Holiness
[1:46:18] requires it his law requires it and
[1:46:21] every time I do anything or you do
[1:46:23] anything the blood of Jesus Christ acts
[1:46:26] like a bumper
[1:46:28] and I've seen that Scarlet streak meant
[1:46:31] that then that the blood still holds the
[1:46:34] Earth
[1:46:36] and as I stood looking
[1:46:39] I got a little closer to him as I
[1:46:41] noticed him now I can hear him say
[1:46:44] father forgive him he doesn't know what
[1:46:47] he's doing
[1:46:50] and I looked down in there later book
[1:46:54] and there's a recording Angel there
[1:46:58] is standing by his side and every time I
[1:47:01] sinned it was put out on the book and my
[1:47:05] name was on it
[1:47:06] and I realized that someday uh that
[1:47:11] blood streak would be lifted and I'd
[1:47:13] have to stand in the presence of God
[1:47:15] with my sinful life
[1:47:18] blasting by his Mercy he was holding off
[1:47:21] my judgment
[1:47:23] I went to him humbly I'm now on my knees
[1:47:27] and I said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am
[1:47:33] unworthy to come in your presence but
[1:47:36] will you please forgive me for what I
[1:47:40] have done he touched his side with his
[1:47:43] hand took the old book and wrote pardon
[1:47:46] on it voted back behind him and my sins
[1:47:50] were gone
[1:47:52] then he looked he looked Stern in the
[1:47:54] face he said now I have forgiven you but
[1:47:58] you want to condemn her
[1:48:05] as I come out of the vision I walked
[1:48:08] over to her I said how do you do she was
[1:48:12] drinking she looked up at me and she
[1:48:14] said oh hello
[1:48:16] I said could I sit down she said I have
[1:48:19] company I said I don't mean it in that
[1:48:23] way lady I just want to speak to you a
[1:48:26] minute she said be seated and I said
[1:48:29] lady
[1:48:31] just a few minutes ago standing there
[1:48:34] behind that door
[1:48:36] I begin to tell her as I begin to look
[1:48:40] the tears begin to run down her cheeks
[1:48:44] and she told me I said lady you don't
[1:48:47] mean to do these things Jesus died in
[1:48:51] the judgments of God is held off by his
[1:48:53] blood you don't mean to do this and she
[1:48:57] said no sir she said my father was a
[1:49:01] deacon in church I was raised in a
[1:49:03] Christian home my husband and I were
[1:49:06] charter members and live the Christian
[1:49:08] Life

[1:49:12] she had two young girls and she went
[1:49:15] straight and how the girls had left her
[1:49:18] and she had told her life away and she
[1:49:21] thought there was no more hope for her
[1:49:25] yeah I said God be merciful those who he
[1:49:30] has four knew he has called
[1:49:33] amen she said are you Reverend Branham
[1:49:37] from Dad I said I am she said I'm
[1:49:40] ashamed of myself to be sitting here
[1:49:42] like this
[1:49:44] she said do you think there would be a
[1:49:47] chance for me
[1:49:49] I said Jesus has his arms stretched out
[1:49:53] waiting for you to come lady amen
[1:49:58] and the other people
[1:50:01] give God now I said would you walk out
[1:50:03] here in this floor with me she said I

[1:50:58] sacrifice and in him you are perfected

[1:53:10] Sanctified us one Spirit we are all

[1:53:17] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:53:19] Jesus
[1:53:21] to them that walked not after the flesh
[1:53:24] but the spirit
[1:53:26] if you're trying to walk by the spirit
[1:53:28] and still lusting for the flesh the
[1:53:32] sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently
[1:53:34] applied to you
[1:53:37] but the worshiper once purged has no
[1:53:42] more desire of sin that was Calvary it
[1:53:47] isn't a place to sell flowers or a
[1:53:50] little place to do this or that it was a
[1:53:52] place where God and man were reconciled

[1:54:50] wait just a moment over your own my
[1:54:53] right hand side surely there's one along
[1:54:56] There Are you ashamed of your sins
[1:55:02] are you
[1:55:04] done
[1:55:06] looking for Heroes
[1:55:09] and it has Heroes physically speaking
[1:55:14] one day honors Switzerland once
[1:55:17] Switzerland was at stake the little
[1:55:19] Swiss party had gutted out into the
[1:55:21] fields to fend defend their economy
[1:55:25] the great oncoming Army was too great
[1:55:27] for them they were all trained had big
[1:55:29] Spears as Shields the Swiss could do
[1:55:33] nothing but give up they were backed up
[1:55:35] against the mountain
[1:55:37] then there was a hero stepped out
[1:55:40] somebody had to die
[1:55:42] and if they lost the battle they had
[1:55:45] enough of those sickle blades and rocks
[1:55:47] sticks to fight with when the oncoming
[1:55:51] Army looked like a brick wall
[1:55:54] if they were taken their lovely little
[1:55:57] wives to be ravished their young girls
[1:55:59] would be ravish their babies would be
[1:56:01] killed their heads would be busted their
[1:56:05] homes would be gone everything would be
[1:56:07] lost
[1:56:08] then there was a man whose name is too
[1:56:10] quickly forgotten
[1:56:12] by the name of Arnold Von weeklord
[1:56:16] he stepped out and said man of
[1:56:18] Switzerland this day I give my life for

[1:57:09] turned to catch his charge he threw his
[1:57:12] arms out and grouped them into his own

[1:57:20] followed him with clubs and sticks that
[1:57:23] great display of heroism rotted that

[1:58:37] the very darkest of all man's dreads was
[1:58:41] death and he took death into his books
[1:58:44] of my own Calvary

[1:58:51] a way for Liberty and he screams to his

[2:01:55] bloody
[2:01:57] you know what happened to him he went up
[2:02:00] in Switzerland many years later lost his
[2:02:02] mind
[2:02:03] plunged himself to death in a pool of
[2:02:06] water
[2:02:07] this morning in Switzerland
[2:02:10] hundreds of people come to watch the
[2:02:12] scene blue water boils up the bottom of
[2:02:16] that big hole of water
[2:02:20] they do it every year it's an old Legend
[2:02:22] they say
[2:02:23] that God refused water to cleanse his
[2:02:26] hands brother no matter how many times
[2:02:29] you're baptized whatever you try to do
[2:02:32] nothing will cleanse your hands but the
[2:02:35] blood of Christ
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:39] in the blue water at your 2000 years
[2:02:41] nearly still brought up
[2:02:44] God refuses it your self-righteousness
[2:02:47] cannot cleanse your sins nothing but the
[2:02:50] blood of Jesus
[2:02:52] think of it now we're going to pray just
[2:02:54] a moment
[2:02:56] I wonder if I could ask something
[2:02:58] tonight when he stood there at Pilots
[2:03:01] judgment Hall this morning
[2:03:04] and set up my kingdom was of this world
[2:03:08] I could speak to my father and straight
[2:03:11] where he'd send me 12 Legions of angels
[2:03:14] one one of them could destroy the world
[2:03:17] I speak to him in 12 Legions of angels
[2:03:20] to be right at my disposal
[2:03:23] he could have done it but he stood there
[2:03:27] Meek and humble to take your death and
[2:03:30] take your sins
[2:03:31] will you be grateful enough for that
[2:03:34] sacrifice tonight you who are needy of
[2:03:36] it and needy of God's blessings would
[2:03:39] you stand to your feet for this prayer
[2:03:41] you stand up to your feet you who want
[2:03:42] to be remembered in this prayer saying
[2:03:45] God be merciful to me I'm guilty I've
[2:03:48] done things wrong and I now want to
[2:03:50] accept my pardoning through Christ Jesus
[2:03:53] will you come to your feet just at this
[2:03:55] time
[2:03:57] God bless you young lady that's the
[2:04:00] courage just remain standing there
[2:04:02] do you mean to tell me you raise your
[2:04:05] hand and they're not sincere enough to
[2:04:07] stand to your feet what good has the
[2:04:09] gospel ever done to you
[2:04:11] oh such playing with church playing with
[2:04:15] God the hour soon at hand one of these
[2:04:18] days an atomic bomb will strike around
[2:04:19] here somewhere where these big powder
[2:04:21] plants
[2:04:22] there will not be one Split Second to
[2:04:25] think it over
[2:04:26] it'll be too late then and maybe before
[2:04:29] next Easter or even this Easter
[2:04:33] won't you stand now say God be merciful
[2:04:36] to me a sinner I accept Christ bye
[2:04:39] though offering himself as the
[2:04:42] perpetuation for my sins and by his
[2:04:45] grace and his grace alone I
[2:04:50] died in the presence of God will you
[2:04:53] confess your wrong he that will hide his
[2:04:56] sin shall not Prosper he that confesses
[2:04:59] Mercy

[2:05:08] now our blessed Lord in the appropriated
[2:05:12] number tonight stands three pinned Souls
[2:05:16] one man and two women
[2:05:20] as I am thinking Lord of Calvary when
[2:05:25] one on one side said Lord remember me
[2:05:29] when thou cometh into thy kingdom the
[2:05:32] other one said if thou be
[2:05:35] let us see a miracle take us off the
[2:05:38] cross and save yourself
[2:05:40] and the other and said God be merciful
[2:05:42] to me and your head swung to its right
[2:05:46] side and said today shalt thou be with
[2:05:48] me in Paradise but you were quiet to the
[2:05:51] other one because there was no
[2:05:53] repentance
[2:05:54] and father God I pray that these maybe
[2:05:57] I'll trust that they are the only three
[2:05:59] in the building that feels that they do
[2:06:02] need to confess their wrongs but that
[2:06:05] they have come the all-sufficient way of
[2:06:07] the way of the Cross forgive them Lord
[2:06:09] and bless them they are standing here

[2:06:22] give its light and the veil of the

[2:06:27] prayed God that you'll bless them and
[2:06:30] give them of thine mercies and cleanse
[2:06:33] them with thy blood and baptize them by
[2:06:37] your sanctifying power into the body of
