conscious that they were here lord we thank you for your grace and your love and your mercy to us this morning to wake us up this morning to lord for us to respond to the call not just for an invitation father because your word declares that no man could come unless the father draws so we thank you for the pull the draw the beckon the call father the call to the resurrection the call to the rapture the call to a new creation the calls are a new walk and a new talk father lord may you take me out of the way and may you speak to your sons and your daughters may you walk out the pages of the bible and may you say something lord through this vessel lord that could break chains and transform lives and lord that we could dash into the presence of almighty god father even now we take every spirit on our control in the name of the lord jesus christ and we declare this ground holy ground this morning lord the singers have already sung lord of worship has already ascended and lord we have built a house for you this morning because you dwell in the praises of your people father and the praises have gone up and established boundaries and lord establish a way that you can move in and out lord and may you move in and out this morning lord if there's anyone depressed we come against it this morning in the mighty name of jesus christ if there's someone sick this morning house of hell has got to give way to the name of jesus christ anyone backs with him we reach past your flesh pass your imagination pass your mind and say satan let go of god's children we declare freedom and victory lord be declared jubilee this morning in this house in this tabernacle in this church lord you said you're truly a prophet we gotta do something for something to happen so we come to do the unexpected this morning something different something radical father may you change lives may you bless the visitors in our gates lord those that are here for the first time those that have been here before may they hear a word lord not from man but a word from you may you take me out of the way they are not here to meet a church meet a ministry meet a pastor but lord we want to meet jesus sirs we would see jesus father we have had enough of man but sirs this morning we want to see jesus we want to see that same jesus who walked on the water that same jesus who took five loaves and two fishes and fed five thousand that same jesus who was veiled throughout the old testament as jehovah of the old and became jesus of the new and is here present tense as the mighty angel fixing things around for the coming of the lord father your coming is right at hand and we want to be ready so take me out of the way speak to your children lord don't let one word be uttered that you wouldn't say if you were standing here this morning lord we are your people father lord we are chosen by you called by you predestinated by you oh god we turn this service completely over to you in the mighty name of jesus christ and the church says and the church says and the church says amen thank you musicians welcome to the house of the lord this morning if you have your bibles will you turn with me to three portions of scripture reading from genesis chapter 1 reading jeremiah 1 and reading scene luke 17 this morning thank you so much for being here those that are here as well those that are connected online we know that god has something special for us today reading genesis 1 and verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them let's go to jeremiah 1 and we're going to go to verse 4. then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came his forth out of the room i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations and our last scripture reading saint luke 17 and reading verse 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here although therefore behold the kingdom of god is within you may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning how many are happy to be in the house of the lord there's no better place to be than in the house of the lord there's no safer place to be than in the house of the lord there's no happier place to be than in the house of the lord there's no place i'd rather be than in the house of the lord as psalmist david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord so we are so grateful for his grace for his mercy and for the opportunity to be gathered here this morning under the canopy of life under the blood and under this great message of the hour that pains a direct road to leave this earth it gives us direct instructions to leave this place because we know rapturing faith is laying in this message and certainly in this service today is a special service it's a deliverance and restoration service so i certainly want to salute those who are here regularly and those who are about to be here regularly because i don't believe you're here by chance i don't believe you're here by accident and if you are invited here this morning it means somebody loves you nobody invites you to choose because they want to do you nobody invites you to the house of the lord because they have problems with you and they're trying to get your life messed up they invite you to the house of the lord because they want to see something better for you and not only do they love you it means god also love you and that's the more important love because the love of an invitation is the expression of god's love to that person who spoke to you because no man could love the way god could love because for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed on him should not perish so we are happy to be in the presence of the lord this morning and just for a title for a thought this morning and we by the grace of god i want to be able to pray for those who need prayer after the service but i believe that we at a time when we ought to be getting right with god it's not about church for the formality of church it's not about church because you're you're you need to be in church and church is something good to do it's about getting right with god and that's why we have a burden for deliverance and restoration it's two things to be delivered from things that you can break from or you think you cannot break from and to be restored to a former state to be restored to a greater plane of existence to restore in your joy and in your walk and and not even the best walk you ever had but to be restored to the representation by predestination the way god sees you and that's where we're trying to go back to by the grace of god this morning so we want to really thank god how many appreciate the prayer meeting on friday night and the service last wednesday and our pressures with the stephen all the very last sunday what a time we're having in the lord so i have a title this morning and the title is connected to the theme of today's inspiration the title is the deliverance and restoration of your spiritual identity the deliverance and restoration of your spiritual identity and we have to realize as a layered background there's a quote i want to read from christ is the mystery of god revealed now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery so god is that without a purpose and not everything he does is obvious so he has a purpose and there's a hidden element or a hidden mystery to how he's unfolding himself and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the his the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began we read that scripture and it's really a powerful scripture when in jeremiah god is speaking to jeremiah and saying before i form thee in the belly so so it wasn't even the conception of father and mother but before i singular personal pronoun form thee in the belly i knew thee he wasn't talking about knowing his fingers and knowing his hands are knowing his feet he's talking about knowing him knowing his identity knowing his potential we're gonna get it before you came out of the womb i sanctify thee so god is not now beginning to work on you god is not now establishing who you are god is not now trying to pick you and and and so in other words you didn't stumble in this morning by accident god was reminding jeremiah and instructing jeremiah and teaching jeremiah what jeremiah didn't even know that before he was even out of belly before he was even formed in the belly god already knew him and you here are known this morning before you were formed in the belly before you came out of the womb before you took your first step before you drank from a bottle before you went to your primary school before you went to secondary school before you said your first life because jeremiah would have made mistakes but god was rewinding the tape of his life to a point before his own existence his own consciousness to say listen we around along the time that your awareness and your problems and your situations can the church say amen a mystery of god that we didn't realize we didn't understand i'm going to come back to this but i want to be going to lay a bit of a foundation here to kind of talk with you a little bit what is the definition of identity by definition your identity is listen carefully the fact of being who or what a person is so your identity or identity is the fact of being who a person is and the operative word there is fact so your identity is the real you the identity is not a show the identity is not uh put on the identity is not you acting as somebody else in another dictionary it is defined as the distinguishing character or personality of an individual when something is identical it means there's no difference in identity because identity speaks about uniqueness your identity is who you are it is your characteristics your identity is your abilities your identity is your nature your identity is your potential it is your realizations it is your achievements come out of your identity your failures are tied to your identity we're gonna go somewhere this morning your victories are tied to your identity your ups and downs is all tied to your identity your identity is the real you so right now you're not seeing the real me because this body is not my identity we're going to go a little deeper you have an id card to try to identify you but that can't really identify you because if your face changes did you change if you lose a finger in the morning does that change who you are so if your finger being removed or your face if you go to facial surgery in the morning and change your face is it a different person so your identity doesn't change when your face change if you lose a finger your identity is still you you lose a toe did you change it it's still you so your body is not your identity your bank account is not your identity if i deposit a dollar into your bank account this morning did they change you so if i increase your money decrease your money doesn't change who you are your family is not your identity somebody gets added to your family does it change you somebody leaves your family does it change you so your identity is not tied to our body our identities are tied to our money our identity is not tied to our family anybody with me so let's begin to go a bit deeper and we're talking about now the deliverance and restoration of our spiritual identity i want to begin to encourage you church the real you is stronger than you think the real you is the overcomer the real you so i'm not talking to this flesh man that's why the prophet can say you are not even the believer but the word in you that's the believer there's a seed germ that if i take away your two legs and your two hands you can still come this morning and shout because the real you oh you don't hear me this morning no wonder this if i lose my teeth gum the devil because my teeth is not that's not my identity that's that's all the entrapments that's all the external expressions of my identity but the real you is an eternal being that rotated off the presence of god can the church see man oh we're building something we're building something this morning hallelujah saw your natural birth when you were born somewhere in the world right now a baby was just born and the person who's holding that baby doesn't know who that person is the person holding that baby is looking at the baby smiling and that baby is smiling and locked up in there is something that the world doesn't know about yet or you don't hear me this morning locked up in there is potential locked up in that baby who has not been to school is the ability to be a doctor a lawyer to be a preacher to be a prophet that identity out of that identity is every possible achievement that could happen in other words because of who you are is why you're an overcomer you don't hear me this morning your education doesn't make you who you are it's because of who you are god allowed you to walk oh you don't hear me this morning it's because of your overcoming is not making you who you are it's because of who you are it's built into you to overcome oh come on now can we begin to preach a little bit in other words you're not here in church to become something else in that kind of a way is because there's a seed in you you're attracted to hear this gospel [Applause] and the transformation that has taken place because when they asked jesus about the kingdom he said don't look there don't look there don't look there the kingdom is inside of you in other words locked up inside of you i placed a seed a long time ago of the real you that's compatible with my kingdom and maybe your mama kept it covered up sin kept it covered up but what people said about you kept it covered up but if we could uncover anybody with me this morning if we could uncover the scene if we could dig a little deeper beyond your facial expressions if we could dig a little deeper between your tiredness in your body to see who's the real person who is the real person who is the real you what is your real identity oh you don't hear me this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah i want to encourage you this morning church that is what's making this gospel so powerful the devil's job is to get you to not know who you really are your ability to get the holy ghost is not tied to what you could do it's tied to who you are it's because god put your name on the book and god predestinated you now you have the ability to fight if your name is not on the book you could never fight you could never respond to this gospel if your name is not in the book you could never show up here this morning it's because of your identity it's because your father is the king that entitles you to access oh you don't hear me somebody preached back to me this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so the great mystery this morning it's the mystery of who you are and i want to challenge you that you don't even realize who you are you only have a partial realization of what you are capable of anybody with me this morning anybody with me this morning hallelujah locked up in you is the ability to do things you don't even realize you could do i'm gonna share a natural story with you then get to the spiritual side i was on some training recently and a gentleman said he paid a lot of money because you wanted to run a hundred mile race i don't know how many of you are athletes but running half a mile per punch for some people will flatten them out running one mile for some people they finish running five miles major achievement 10 miles major accomplishment 20 miles life goal 50 miles forget about it but he had in his heart to run 50 to run a hundred mile race and he paid money and he got trained and whatever he did he couldn't cross 38 miles somehow every time he tried to do it when he was 13 he just gave up and he heard about somebody who who said i could unlock that limitation for you he said give me two days and i will unlock your ability to make that hunt in my race and he told all of his friends he said this guy says he just needs two days to unlock the ability to run a hundred mile race and that's a mind-blowing thing because if you have been trying to do something for a long time and you're not able to pass a certain limit in your life if somebody tells you there's a way for you to break past your limitation like like break past the strong barrier like like break past the prayer barrier like like break past whatever you're trying to go through he said the gentleman came to his house he said the first day he did nothing he just watched him and the next day he said we're going to get up early in the morning and i'm going to give you the instructions i want you to pick this is not spiritual now this is natural but i wanted to show you how we're tied to the spiritual the next morning they got up he said today we're gonna do the race whatever you do don't put voice to your pain he said whatever you do don't say i'm hurting whatever you do don't say i can't make it whatever you don't let the words come out of your mouth even if the thought comes to your mind whatever you do don't let the words come out of your mouth and i'm hearing this natural man speaking and scriptures just turning in my mind let the weak say i'm strong the issue is not you have a problem is what you declare so that was one part of it he said the second thing i want you to do is whenever i ask you how you're doing say i am outstanding so i'm listening to this natural man speaking and my mind goes back to that woman who lost the baby and when they ask her what's going on she said all is well whatever question they had you say all is well so this gentleman said he started the race and he keep asking him how you feeling good how are you outstanding and no question about it brother joe he blew past 38 miles he blew past 48 miles he blew past 58 miles he said as he was getting close to 70 something miles he said he reached he knew he was about to stop and he said this man was running with him and he said let me tell you a secret i don't tell anybody else i don't get tired and i want you to begin to say i don't get tired and at that point in time he said he this man just crazy but he began to apply what the man said and 78 became 79 and 79 become 80 and every time he looked to stop and say how are you doing i feel outstanding i don't get tired and with that 80 became 81 became 82 83 84 all the way to 100. and i looked and i said look how this natural man tapped into a spiritual principle and he said something he said it was the same legs that couldn't pass 38. that is what shook me it was not a dif because it was two days but occurrence it wasn't a year training program it was just two days of changing his mind about what he was able to do he did not know what was locked up in him [Applause] so when i say to you this morning you don't know what's locked up inside of you this is not just words you have to realize that inside of you the bible says jesus said the kingdom of god is inside you and if a natural man could break natural limits by realizing that his words and his actions were triggering limitations being broken in him what about a bride when she realizes that the kingdom of god is within you when you realize who you are what limits are we gonna break this morning what limitations [Applause] anybody with me this morning our identity is who we are not our facial features your words are based on your identity we're going to say something this morning everything we see and interact with is based on your identity and this is why friends when we say people backslide and then i'll get a little bit in this the way you dress is based on your identity you know because it's really an expression of who you are you see many of us we follow the gospel because we learn some rules and some guidelines and we understand if you love me keep my commandments but it remains a surface level because it's head knowledge and is not yet fully who we are even though the kingdom is there it's blocked up by facebook and tick tock and conversations we shouldn't have so the kingdom part of you is being stifled so it lives in our hearts and our minds on a surface level well we don't do this as a christian i could preach till blue in the face until you change the way you dress but the moment your will breaks your real identity resurfaces can i say that one more time because we put a lot of self-imposed controls on our lives don't lie don't steal don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that because when we're born we are born with our identity being hidden many who lived in the world for years lived drinking smoking you didn't know who you were you didn't know your identity you thought you were a chicken you didn't know you were an eagle it's only when the eagle to eagle call come you reckon wait a minute there's something here triggering like a i'm feeling something different i don't know fully what it is but i know what i know is not me i don't feel comfortable going to the bar i don't feel comfortable going to the effect i know the fullness of this perfection and adoption and thing but i know what i was in before is not me and i know what i'm moving towards is what i am but it's a journey and a process of unveiling who you really are and the devil's job is to say no you just like everybody else you're just like your neighbor you're just like your co-worker don't press too hard don't worship don't lift your hands and praise god just be calm and and be collective and just say you love jesus and you're a good person but something in your heart knows there's a deeper purpose and a real identity friends you know is the hardest thing in life to be an actor you know and to act for a long time every day you're acting every day you're trying to put on your best foot so some people this morning put on the whole church outfit not just the clothes you know but the whole personality god bless you god bless you some people have to rehearse i ain't mean i'll literally rehearsal no i mean in your mind in spirit because monday tuesday wednesday thursday that is not how you're living but you have different identities it's like identity disorder it's identity crisis but i better call it spiritual amnesia you don't really know who you are so you operate a certain way because you don't want to reveal the real you to your co-workers because the real you don't talk them kind of thing the real you're not supposed to talk that kind of thing so you have a alternate version of yourself for when you're with family anybody with me this morning you have a different version of yourself so everybody here this morning telling me the real you is who you're showing people all the time because the real you don't get upset and angry and have oaths and grudges do you read you who we trying to find this morning we're on a quest this morning for your spiritual identity because only real you can make it on the other side only because only perfect love can get you over there so the real you can only exist fully in perfect love the real you can only exist in an environment with no oughts no grudges so if you ever order this morning are you talking to the real you yet or no because you had to drop that oat for us to find to be able to reach when jesus when when when did he pull and and that woman came he was brother branson he was hunting for a spirit looking for her soul he was trying to connect with the real her because she was walking around living in her life saying the husband of which is not mine and i bid with so much other men but when jesus said go find your husband he was able to connect with the version of herself she didn't even know what's in her oh come on now he was able to find her name in the book so god was seeing her how she wasn't even seeing herself you don't hear me this morning and i want to challenge you this morning we need to see ourselves the way god sees us and god can only identify with the real you which is your spiritual identity can the church say amen let me encourage you a little bit your pain is not your identity you know pain is to help find your identity or you don't hear me this morning god will strip away the things you're leaning on so that the real you will get exposed we want to expose the real you we want to expose the prayer warrior he hiding this morning we want to find oh you don't hear me [Applause] can we describe your spiritual identity this morning i'm looking for somebody tell me if you know them when you talk to this person with a punch there's always a joy when they talk this person no matter what you do they don't get upset if you do them something they drop the or so the odd hair they just fall off nothing sticks on that person if they have no food they don't bother them if they have money they don't bother them if they have no money it don't bother them when they hear it's time for service they drop everything because this is the most important thing to them are looking for that person and looking for somebody that even if they mess up they don't lie about it because this real person can't lie because god can't lie and this real identity to a lie i'm looking for somebody the more god blesses the more humble they become because that's a real identity not somebody when they give him a blessing they lift their head up that is not who i'm talking to this morning we're going for the real identity the real identity don't feel a certain way to dress like a christian the real one you want to dress like a christian all the time because this is who they are it's not a show it's not a performance it's not a request it's not something hard because when you're yourself it is normal it's your natural way of life you don't hear me this morning i'm looking for that person this morning but occurrence if you if you see that person let me know where that person is because that person is locked up somewhere hiding somewhere covered up somewhere and we want to deliver and restore that spiritual identity you don't have to tell that person to worship that person is a worshiper because they understand that god deserves worship and worship has nothing to do with what happened to you worship has nothing to do with your mistakes and nothing to do with your failures and nothing to do with what somebody said about you that real person is just a worshiper in the morning they worship in the evening they worship on a sunday day worship on a thursday they worship [Music] [Applause] anybody know that person anybody know where that person is hiding that person could be your brother that person could be your sister that person could be a young person that person could be your killer i'm looking for that person this morning that living virtues will be emanating from that person stop living the lie of being who you're not i said it many times ago when that person i'm describing ends up messed up a little bit covered up a little bit and they're trying to hide who they really are so they try to hide it by taking only the language of the world because they don't want to appear too churchy sin just holds them in a grip a grip of fornication a grip of lust a grip of lying a grip of cheating or grip and and and they want to break up because you see the new ones that come out you know when you look at legion legion had a thousand devils but the cry in legion soul connected to jesus you know so it didn't matter how much devils he had upon him that seed in his heart was connecting to the presence of deity on the earth a thousand devils couldn't stop the cry from crossing over to the other side and jesus said let us go to the other side because a seed is crying out people couldn't reach this man they couldn't reason with this man they couldn't talk with this man but it wasn't his voice that was reaching out it was his heart it was his identity it was who he was and when jesus landed here the devils didn't ask jesus name they say we know who you are we know your identity it is your identity that will push back the devils it is just who you are do you realize if you could see the spiritual realm even in your backseating condition when you walk the street devils start to tremble because they know who you are even when you don't even know who you are oh you don't hear me this morning do you know what's locked up inside of you church of the living god i want to encourage you friends your healing your restoration your victory is tied to fate in who god says you are because the faith in who god says you are is the key to unlock one time with the brand i was doing a prayer line and stuff and a woman was there sitting there an indian lady i don't remember the story and she was just watching watching watching and after a while but the band was praying for people and she just caught hold of it and she'd walk up to the prophet and just take her crutches and hand it to him he didn't have to pray for her because she her fate wasn't was strong enough that she could just walk away healed her faith made her whole i can't heal you this morning but your faith your fear can make you whole do you have faith for yourself this morning do you have faith for your family do you have faith for your children [Applause] so friends what we really want to see is a transformation a transformation to unveil the real you that the devil wants to keep covered up hallelujah when you think about it and i'm gonna get it in a bit but just think about esther esther we know who she was we don't know much about her family except that it was her cousin and fam who raised her and esther got comfortable in the palace in other words she lost an entertainer she became separated from who she was and what she could do for her family until i had to say could it be per adventure it is that you are here for such a time as this because if you don't do something about it deliverance will still come you know it will come from elsewhere but how do you not know that for such a time as this you are in your position esther she wasn't living in sin but esther forgot who she was and because she forgot who she was she lost the burden so there are believers who have been in the village a long time and they have forgotten who they are and because they have forgotten who they are they have lost the burden the burden the burden it means that that true you has been covered up by by safety and comfort you're just concerned about your life that's that was yesterday you know she was hearing the threat and because she felt safe can we talk a little bit because esther felt nobody could touch her because she was married to the king she lost sight of the impact on her loved ones and the word had to come to her listen if you don't do something god will do something but there'll be a price because you're in a position to do something in other words you have lost a burden for your people you have lost the burden for the saints you have lost the burden i don't know if there's anybody that's mourning us you lost a burden in your heart i'm pressing on i'm pressing on but you do have a burden for somebody else a burden for a brother who's struggling a burden for sister who was struggling and throughout scripture there are many people who because losing your identity is really not knowing who you are or forgetting who you are you know how did samson end up with delilah samson ended up really lying because he forgot who he was because if you know who you are and you are walking in who you are and you are living in who you are and you are walking in your purpose then you can't do what sons did anybody with me saul the apostle who became paul saul who became paul he thought he was doing right he was in church a pharisee of the pharisees they are stoning stephen but he was in an identity crisis i didn't even know it because he felt justified that he was defending the scriptures until something had to happen to him to change him and for him to come there but wait a minute that that day wasn't me you know gideon struggled with his identity gideon mighty man of allah in other words there's more in you than you realize the way you're living now is not with a calling to live and gideon had a response i'm from the smallest tribe from the smallest family and in my family i'm smallest that is what he saw as his identity he said this is who i am and god to show gideon gideon you are more than what you're seeing because i am seeing you completely different from how you are seeing yourself so if you are here this morning and you think you're failure oh i want to erase that because god doesn't see you as a failure god doesn't see you as a loser god doesn't see you as weak god does it because you couldn't be here unless god wanted you to be here so shake yourself like gideon and say i'm coming home i'm reporting for duty i'm standing up for what is the truth can the church say amen moses left egypt on the run after killing an egyptian and he lost the burden completely 40 years he appeared him it pained him when he was in egypt catch his friends he was in pain when he saw because he saw him at the bus he knew it wasn't right he made a failed attempt to deliver went into hiding and already 40 years he even think about him lost the burden and many times some of us we are living in the ease of our job our position or whatever and we lost the burden for the spiritual things you know we get so caught up in the natural thing because nothing is easier to relate to you see food in the morning and the gas and the car and transportation and this and all these things and and that's our world and we lose the burden not realizing that this natural world has come at an end and only a spiritual world is what matters and we fight so much to build up this natural identity that's dr so-and-so that is mr so and so that is who this person is and we we work really hard to build up this thing that people see about us your resume your credentials all these things and the real you is hidden you're not telling anybody you're christian you don't acknowledge god and it becomes embarrassing when you see somebody who say i couldn't do it without the lord i knew that but wait a minute you know i never tell my workers i'm a christian i never acknowledged god and you're looking for god to bless you even more what about a prodigal son grow up a certain way grew up in church grew up in his father's house blessed but something snapped in his life for every person in this room you know when your life changed for the better and for the worse people go back to when they were saved when they were delivered and all these things but they were they're also highlighting your life or low lights when things went wrong and you're some of you still struggling to find back your way some have struggled and fought back to a place they were because even david say create a mirror clean out and renault read new right spread and cast me over and take and and when you look at david's life restore unto me for to restore joy meant david knew he was in a better place before he knew at that point in time the way he was operating was not it was not his high point he knew he had tasted better than what he was eating at that point in time just like the prodigal son the prodigal son left and for a while he was fine because friends when you leave church and you leave your father house and and stuff it takes a little while for you to work off all the good teaching it will happen overnight so over time and that's why i say people don't backslide today for tomorrow is over time you start to just get weaker and you listen the lesser you would and you live the way you want to live and after a while you'll lose the sensitivity to this still small voice because it's tell small voices they're telling you don't do that don't do that don't go there don't say that don't do this and then after a while brother brown said it's at the low down avoid the volume until you don't hear it anymore and your heart becomes hard however it was this young man went away from home and found himself in a foreign city and he had enough natural substance to sustain him until it ran out and the sad thing is how bad your identity crisis could be he was content for a while living as a slave eating pig food until he had to calm the incenses why did it take him so long until i had to come their senses the moment you offered me to pick food i was gone he was easiness you know the moment you put any plate say i am out of here but he was eating the pig food because he was messed up he had lost himself and there are people walking around the church walking around a life have lost themselves and he had to come to his senses to re-avoid me this is not who i am and even in his coming back he said i will go back to my father's house and say i'm not even worthy to be a son just take me back as a servant not knowing that once your son you're always a son [Applause] i trust this helps somebody today to realize and to relook at your walk in life and with the lord because if a word comes to you today to tell you there's a highway to heaven there's a way to leave this sinful world behind and there's a way to open up this kingdom that's within you to walk in glory and to walk in strength won't you take that road would he be willing to cut away everything that's not god to be able for god to be veiled and seen and lived through you can the church say man friends the devil doesn't know who you are you know this issue of identity is real the same way we struggle to find out who we are in god and friends listen only when you know who you are in god he could really be a christian you know outside of your liver upper down life you know you live a life you're up on the air done one day because you really don't know one day you're living for the world one day living for your business we live for your family but when you don't for god that gives you the confidence every day you're weighing it before the lord lord should i do this should i do this should i live this should i actually should i do this that's the only way to be a real christian it's a full-time thing you cannot defeat a full-time devil with a part-time christian walk you need to be a full-time christian [Applause] you cartoon it or internet off you need to be a christian every day every minute of every day every second of every day that's what a christian is [Applause] how do you get to that spot it's not just about words it's about a life it's about the discipline it's about cleaning the life out it's about opening up the channels it's about cleaning out your phone and cleaning out your computer and cleaning out your car and cleaning out your house because you want no interruption between the line you don't want no disruption you don't want no interference you don't want any static you want god people to speak directly to you and nothing him to you friends god is not putting any obstacle between you and him can i say that one more time god is not putting any obstacle between you and him his desire is to be as close to you even in you so if there's an obstacle in your life between you and god it's not on god it's on you our job is to preach faith in you to begin to move the obstacles and to dig your valley of ditches and to clean up your house and like that woman was looking for the lost coin you have to do it yourself you have to clean up your house you have to clean up your life you have to clean up your interruptions you have to get off the phone of life for god to get to you or you don't hear me this morning you know there's some people they're trying to call on the phone busy and they keep calling and calling and that's what god is doing with some of you you know every day trying to reach you but you're so busy with life all god getting is a busy tone can i say that one more time and say god not blessing me and i'm so stressed get off the phone of life i'm talking about all the nonsense and talk to god don't let them have to try to get you and get you and get you and get you no lord i'm here talk to me i want to hear your voice [Applause] my phone line open i'm not taking any calls today i only want to talk to you you don't hear me this morning many of us listen we are influenced by who we spend time with you know you know when you spend time with certain people you get further from god and if you get closer to god you know it nobody else have to be with you you spend time with people and when you leave that environment you're different every person you talk to changes you but abandoned was driving one time he said somebody came at this car he said he spoke a blue streak then he said don't let certain people into my car because when they speak they change the environment around me they change my atmosphere one time by the man i'm walking the hotel room he said i need another room somebody has come in fornication in this room that's how sensitive he was to the spiritual realm and the sin and the spirit that around them do you understand is that a human and flesh and blood thing but it's a spiritual warfare going on right now to deliver you to clear the pathway for god to speak to your heart drop down your natural defenses people have their defenses i don't want to wait to see miss soft what are you talking about he's vulnerable be vulnerable to god this morning say lord i need help i don't know what to do when i lost at the end of the road i try everything else my family in a mess i've seen too many people i have seen too many young people take this gospel and gone into the world and they're so messed up now i wish i could preach longer i wish i could preach louder i would take a fish on the street to tell people his gospel is real and when you walk away from this the way of a transgressor is hard it's harder when you walk away to come back in you better thank god you are in the house of god this morning and don't take it for granted [Applause] god will do whatever he needs to do that's why he said if love doesn't get you desperate conditions will because god is only cons oh god is only interested in that seed in your soul you may be seated no wonder but everybody don't seek a tree in a better sickness because your body is not your identity this is just a house for your identity oh you don't hear me this morning if you have to break your foot and put in a wheelchair to get your identity to say lord i'm ready to serve you i'm ready to connect with you are ready for the kingdom to be alive in me then god will do it don't you wait until your world turns upside down to come back into contact with god [Applause] we can do better people who have feared before are examples of how we should not do things it's embarrassing when we watch people do nonsense and you walk in the same footsteps how much lessons how much licks you have to get to realize that the raw to hell is pleased with fantastic intentions but it taking you straight to hell and the devil the devil will ensure your taste natural success and think it is god's success you heard what i said the devil will ensure you get natural success and people will say thank god and god it have nothing to do with it [Music] to keep you in a false sense of security that it is well and your soul is not even well [Applause] that's why brother branham can say bright skies are not a sign of god's approval and cloudy skies are not the signs of god disapproval god will shut doors that you shouldn't go in and you're there praying lord open it open it and god say pray all you want that door not opening because i know what's behind that door and behind that door will destroy you you're not passing that door you need to wonder when things don't work out why they don't work out and it's not god whole and your back is something that the devil fighting you it's god saying i wanted to wreck your path because that seed in you has got to come to life and i don't want to get lost in thorns and lost in the case of life and lost doing what you want to do [Applause] everybody will preach on wednesday night be willing to sell all you have to buy that field because that pearl of great price is worth more than five degrees more than five houses more than five cars [Applause] i don't know who this is for this morning is there's nothing worse than a false sense of security i have some money in the bank so you feel secure you have an alarm on your house and you feel secure you have a dog running around the yard and you feel secure you just get a good bill of health from your doctor and you feel secure is that your security how are you checking your security regard do you know how secure you are with him your bank telling you all right your doctor tell you all right but when last have you asked god god am i all right people who struggle with health they go to the doctor and the doctor says the changes you implemented have resulted in a clean bill of health and statistically many people at that point go back to the old ways it's as if that clean bill of health is a license to go back and eat the foolishness they should need because there's a sense of security it's a sense of comfort a sense of safety friends church is a false sense of security there are people who think because they're in church they're all right some people say i love jesus i'm all right i believe the prophet the message the scriptures i'm all right and god is saying i don't even know that i don't even recognize it god will say depart from you work of iniquity and he was in church for 30 years because god is interested in who you are not what you do friends because you could do things with the wrong motive but you see when you do because of who you really are that's what god wants to see will you really you stand up will you really you i want to know who the read you is friends i can speak for myself i know i have stuff to change in my life that's why i'm here this morning and i'm not preaching i'm here in church because i know i have stuff i need to change in my life and if you don't have stuff to change any wrong church because jesus came to heal to to change or transform to deliver to restore it he's a day that i will have no need of a doctor but he is a great physician here this morning for those who need a doctor lord i need a doctor i need a doctor for my mind i need a doctor for my soul i need a doctor for my body i'm a family we need a doctor i'm a business we need a doctor the young people need to go to the doctor so you don't feel the need to compromise who you really are there's nothing more uncomfortable than a christian trying to live as if you're not a christian because you have so much the kingdom in you revolts you find yourself in a shady place and you just you cut even your carpets a bit you try to fit in you're trying to and then after a while you realize you're you're not having fun people are having fun but you can't have fun and even if you feel good for a moment the moment you leave you feel sick not the sickness of your stomach the sickness of your soul because you know is that right and god convicts you on you you're leaving there feeling empty tired weary frustrated messed up miserable anybody know what i'm talking about because once you're touched by this word the world does lose its appetite the tears don't feel right the humanity flesh could struggle in the environment but his soul struggles say this is not me friends if when you miss service it doesn't bother you something wrong with your christian work telling you if and i'm making it today becomes an easy statement something is wrong you are suffering from an identity crisis that's right in the messenger deity of jesus christ can you take some more men and women the prophet said it's time we found out who you are who are you that was the question that the angel asks jacob what is your name who are you what is your identity because the way you're fighting i need to find out what behind that because you're not letting me go i need to go but you're fighting like you need something you're fighting like you're serious about change like you say like tonight is your night you're not going home without getting something who are you because the person that taught us gonna meet somehow you're fighting different i need to go by not letting me go and the angel brother punched a touchy hollow of his thigh because if he didn't do that the angel would have been kept in this dimension and jacob said well i am jacob and by giving his name and we're going to talk about his name revealed his identity but there was no identity conflict so when the angel looked at his real identity and he made me give him he say something not right because the identity you are describing and what i'm seeing is not the same i can't call you jacob because you're fighting not like a jacob this kind of fight and desperation without seeing is not how jacob just do it [Applause] you might think you're jacob a rascal alright but the way you're moving this morning you're in conflict with that name your praise is in conflict with that name your desperation is in conflict with that name you're not lining up with that name i have to call you a different name a name that better describes who you really are jacob i know you don't know who you really are but let me tell you who you are your name is israel [Applause] and from that time his name was not reconciled with his identity anybody with me this morning no wonder the bible says to him that overcome it will i give a new name because that new name speaks to your real you the name you're walking around with but the current current cause that's not your name there's another name the name god calls you pie it's not clarence it's not linden it's not george it's a new name reserved for overcomers who have come in alignment with their spiritual identity [Applause] anybody with me this morning friends your purpose is connected to who you are i will say it one more time your purpose there's nothing greater in this world that man has sought to find than to find a meaning a purpose your purpose is connected to who you are your destiny is connected to who you are your abilities your successes your talents is only because of who you are you walk around saying when i'm gifted and disorderly that's because of who you are you know these skills are not acquired you are your learnings are only helping amplify or express what's locked up in you your ability to survive to overcome the bounce back to get back up when you fall down we sing a song we fall down but we get out that ability to we fall down but we get up that's not you we fall down but we get up and you think you're moving but inside there is that seed whenever you do something that seed pushes his way back up like that lily push we fall down but we get up friends don't forget who you are god had to ask job job where was thou because the current situation is not defining the reality of who you are so i want to remind you where we start when i lay the foundation of the earth let's go back to your representation to your experience the way you were before can the church say amen can we go a little further are we enjoying the lord this morning visit us we're not crazy we're just really serious about making it to heaven [Applause] really really serious about making it to heaven and not going to hell and getting our families to go with us and not leaving here sick and living here in joy and taken back from the devil what he's told from us we're really serious about that thing we're not here to talk church we hear about god's business we hear about the soul winning devil fighting holy ghost outpouring kind of revival that's what we are motivated by it's what drives us what we see should put our souls into action to make a church to make a revival if i describe an identity well enough you should be able to identify who i'm referring to so if i were to say the tallest person in church carries himself very steeply very articulate he's a gentleman has white hair could be soft-spoken you know he's never the loss for words has a beaming smile anybody who we're talking about clarence people just so if i if i describe an identity well enough you should be able to identify who i'm referring to so to simplify this process you could imagine if i had to come to you and say i got a phone call from he's very tall he has gray hair here and i have to go through five minutes to describe me every single time you know how long it'll take to transmit the message and you know how harder it gets if it's somebody who don't have those attributes so it's a sister who sits on the left side of church in between the fourth row and the eighth row you there waiting should i figure it out figure it out you don't know you know where you're going you understand the problem right so if i describe an identity well enough you should be able to know who i'm referring to but to simplify this process we attach names to identities to make the identification process easier faster shareable so if i see a punch everybody know what you're talking about punch i can tell you but a punch called man you could relate an image comes to your mind who are referring to if i say brother hugh williams then you know who we're talking about the more unique an identity the easier it is to identify anybody with me back in the old testament god revealed himself to moses not by your name but he just spoke of his identity when moses asked who shall i see sent me god didn't give him a name because he wasn't ready to be called by a name yet he said tell them i am that i am give them my identity i am your healer i am your restorer i am your waymaker i am your baptizer give them my identity [Applause] whenever you speak about me spend time describing i am your shield i am your reward i am your backlog i am your strong tower [Music] just use my identity and for years he was his identity seven compound redemptive names they didn't have one way to talk about him they always spoke about him by his identity jehovah jehovah jehovah jehovah to describe god you have to bring out this whole description the rose of sharon lily of the valley the bright and morning star the fairest of ten thousand but to give power to the church the church had to have a key to unlock to unlock the power faster because we need the power faster and we need the power wrapped up together in one because we don't just wanted jehovah gyra jehovah rafa jehovah me see we we we want all of god so that's why you say in my name when jesus came jehovah of the old the resume of the old the description of the old the identity of the all became wrapped up in the lord jesus christ as the key to the new in my name you shall cast out devils whether the devil is sickness and you used to call it jehovah rapha that god is here now whether it's jehovah jairo because you need a present help in time of trouble just the name jesus activate jehovah rapha and jehovah sharma and jehovah nisi and jehovah's oh he called you don't hear me this morning [Applause] his name and his identity this is one this was a great mystery that was god was unfolding because when jesus was being tempted in the wilderness the devil never asked him about his name the devil was trying to figure out if this is the one so if thou be the devil was trying to understand his identity he didn't ask him about his abilities its powers you see why identity is important what we call you brother punch is really relevant to know it's your identity the devil is afraid of you know even if you don't realize but occurrence how much is locked up in you that identity is what has the devil trembling this morning that's why when we pray today the identity of those who are in this building will be enough with the fate of god to see the sick healed to see souls delivered to see chains break in this house identity in the message wisdom versus fate but the branham said jesus knew who he was he knew his identity satan was wondering i'll leave that right there so if jesus created a situation and the devil himself brother anthony could not even identify who jesus was think about it friends the devil had to ask the question you know if jesus who was call of god wrapped up in flesh the devil couldn't figure out and had to get verification and confirmation what do you think about you with all your fault and weakness right now you finally read any devil just don't know what to do with you either right now you in that if there will be phase we never don't know if you're for him you're team because one day upon one day you're done but this service we are ripping out pieces of the devil's kingdom that was blocking his view of that seed in your soul so he will come with a more direct question if you be one of those sons who will bring back deep ding ding ding ding ding no you're in a position to begin to speak anybody with me names and identities are connected when you mention the name it creates an expectation of the person so if you hear that anthony's preaching this morning and he would like to welcome at the anthony to the pulpit and then i show up you say something wrong because when you heard the name anthony you expect to see anthony because the name is connected to the person let's read hebrews and this is uh we're taking a little small walk here because this is how i want you to begin to practice this new walk we're talking about here in hebrews 11 chapter of eight by faith moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child i didn't want to pause there it's not the subject of it but a proper child by three months what a blessing man and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses this is the script i want to get to when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter so the name was already to begin to get into conflict with an identity that moses moses wasn't taught this thing you know it was already in him because he was growing up in egyptian palace he wasn't growing up any synagogue he wasn't growing up but something in him was growing as well as he was getting older this german and the seed the word the life the predestination was growing too and after a while i couldn't imagine whether papa they were calling him but i pharaoh's is that is pharaoh's daughter's son and after what he said but wait no man that is no don't call me that don't call me that don't call me that and i want to begin to encourage you to church when the world tries to put a label on you of who you are begin to tell them don't call me dad that's not my name that's not who i am my identity is in conflict i'm not just i'm not a trinidadian no prominent i come from god are going back to god don't try to put a label on me because you don't know who my you don't know my identity anybody with me this morning and we touch on it when there's a significant change in the nature the identity of a person the name will often time bring up the whole identity so to signify and permanently identify this change and identity god himself can't even refer to that person the same way the change is just too great so god establishes a new name so that's why when he met and spoke to abram by the time he was ministering to abram he said listen i need to change your name because your identity the name you got that your father gave you that your mother gave you is doesn't speak to your identity that i have for you so the name abram could no longer work i want to call you abraham and your wife they call her sarai but when i look into her life she's dr sarai she's a sarah and when he looked at saul the apostle saul he says saul your identity is not a soul you're really a paul when i look at your life that not in connection anybody with me jacob jacob that's not who you are you're really israel because you had a change it's not it's not just a change it is not revealing the real the real you because the old version of you was just covered up with sin and muck and maya but as it begins to fade away because the word comes to you in reality and you begin to walk a different walk and walk into the plan of god for your life all of a sudden you real you begin to stand up can the church say amen the musicians get ready so there's a need a great need for deliverance from the bondage of your earthly identity and a restoration to your spiritual identity we need to separate the identity that you see that you will cease from what god sees we need to separate who you are from who you are not and it's because of who you are god could grant you the holy ghost it's because of who you are he could bring healing and deliverance and restoration to you when you look at samson samson grew up fine upright upbringing until he lost sight of who he was and we know the story of samson rip open the lion and take down the gate and all these things samson had stepped from behind the wood the word was his protection the word was his defense if he had stayed behind the wood he'd be finding him and friends if you stay behind you would nothing could get to you if eve had stayed behind you would not even get to eve are you with me eve step out from behind the wood but his mystics and his failures had pushed him to his purpose his failures had pushed him to his destiny and although samson had found himself tied up i'm fast forwarding to the end of his life although samson found himself tied up the philistines were not taking chances they dug out his eyes so it was not enough to trap him they wanted to make sure that samson could not see his way and that's the devil's goal to make sure you don't see your way he don't mind you come to church you know but he don't want to see your way he don't mind you say i'm a good christian but he don't want you to see the way you're supposed to walk can the church say amen and samson found themselves as we know locked up there and the bible says that they came to make sport of samson samson was the main event because he was such a problem for them that they were celebrating the fact that samson had been caught and i wonder samson was there hearing the shoutings because they would have had some kind of preliminary events leading up to the main event what was going through samson's mind you could begin to play something softly as samson was there thinking about his life if you have ever been in a situation paid the hospital the doctor whatever it is that snaps you out of your routine most people end up thinking about their life how i end up here you speak to somebody in a hospital bed at that point in time they're not taking more money they're not thinking about business politics the government those things will come to mind you started thinking about your life and i wonder samson was there waiting his turn as it were figuring out when they're going to call me when they're going to call me there's a bit of regret someone would have had because he said i know better you go back into the scripture the bible shows his parents say why don't you choose a wife among your own that's right but samson alberta branham said god has put red lights on the road to helena he said when you're driving on the road to hell you have to run the red lights because god will do everything to stop you from making a bad decision so when you make bad decision after bad decision the reality is you are breaking traffic lights that are designed to stop you and god is saying turn around turn back turn back turn back don't go this way and i can imagine samson saying to himself what if i listened what if i didn't follow through with this thing i abandoned everything i knew to god on this road that i knew was wrong because nobody does wrong without knowing it wrong or not are you with me [Music] but branham said samson wept [Music] he said he had no eyes and he said those socket-less eyes he wept [Music] and i could imagine a man who was born to be a leader found himself here in the gate opened and a young boy coming to lead him to be the sport and step by step i don't know how long they kept him there grinding at the mill it may have been a while and he didn't have much long steps to make but with every step he felt the weight of decision the weight of life and the consequences that brought him to this spot [Music] and i see you say say little boy leave me to the pillars leave me to the pillars i don't know if samson knew what was going to happen or not but he was being pushed because there was still a seed in him that was tied to purpose he said lead me to the pillars um said as he stood there he was ready to die he knew a price had to be paid and he said lord [Music] remember me you did it before i just don't want to die alone if i have to go down lord let me die with these philistines and lord and noah messed up [Music] but these palestines took out eyes they didn't put in [Music] and they had no right as bad as i got they had no right to take out his eyes he said lord avenge me my two eyes so i have a challenge to the church to the young people to their parents are you prepared to die i'm not talking about physical death now but are you willing to die to your whole life your old way of living you're willing to die and and and take down the devil's kingdom around your life with you so that you could walk in the newness of life as a new creation because that's what god wants for the trappings and the life you have built up around yourself to create an impression in this world that's going to hell under fire i know they're backsliders here i know there are those here who have taken god for granted taking this message for granted taking church for granted taking life for granted and every single time situations come to drive them back to god sometimes it's death sometimes it's hospital sometimes it all kind of stuff and then they say lord i need you lord i need you [Music] friends if your life has been touched in that way i challenge you today to make your life right with god is there anybody this morning who wants to rededicate their life i'm not talking to your family i'm not talking to the person next to you i'm i'm talking to you we're going to pray we're going to pray for you but i want to challenge you if you really want to be changed until transformed be transformed you need to really mean business whether it's your first day in church whether you've been here before where they've been living up and down where they're here just try a thing where they get an invitation and say well oh gosh what if something happened something happened i want to challenge you to give it a 100 if you are not really here for be chained and transformed that's okay this is not for everybody i want to be clear this is not for everybody god wishes everybody will come but this is not for everybody but it is a seed in your soul that is being touched by this word and you realize that this is this is me this is my identity this is where i belong this is how i want to live i want to live holy i want to live righteous i want to be a real christian i want to be a christian in my heart i want to be a christian mother father husband wife son daughter i don't

all the way go all the way go all the way is anybody wants to go all the way many have been in the village for a long time and they're only partially in [Music] when he's supposed to be a real worshiper you give so much of your energy to so many other things and the god you give a few a little thing here alerting here alerting here what does giving all to god look like what does that version of you look like when you are so out and the devil realized nobody branham said a man can live in such a way that the devil don't know what to do with him [Music] i want to say that one more time a man can live in such a way the devil don't even know what to do with you you see i'm i don't even bother with you anymore your faith is too strong your prayer life is unbreakable [Music] i can't find a way your armor you're too defended god i want to be that kind of christian that the devil doesn't know what to do with me that comes from finding your spiritual identity you could tell the devil where to get off because you know who you are you know where you come from you know where you're going [Music] nothing shakes you you can't even think of backsliding what is backslide i make a mistake i get back up put it under the blood but i'm a soldier in the army of the lord let the devil figure that out don't let the devil ask you why you're here this morning tell the devil you have a right to be here this morning because your son and your daughter of the living god i don't care what you did yesterday you have a right [Applause] to access the throne of god today the devil cannot

redemption is made only for those who have the seed of god [Music] you may be seated with a brand of many times to speak about people who would get healed and drunkards prostitutes people who were never in church would walk in and get healed and people who sat in church for years would sit without healing because he said healing is not a merit of your salvation it's a merit of your faith oh
