[11:01] sing unto the lord bless his name show
[11:04] forty salvation

[11:13] and greatly to be praised
[11:15] he is to be feared above all gods
[11:19] for all the gods of the nations are
[11:21] idols
[11:22] but the lord
[11:23] made the heavens
[11:25] honor and majesty are before him
[11:28] strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
[11:32] give unto the lord we kill dreads of the
[11:34] people give unto the lord glory and
[11:36] strength
[11:38] give unto the lord
[11:40] to glory due unto his name
[11:43] bring an offering
[11:44] and come into his courts
[11:47] oh
[11:48] worship the lord in the beauty of
[11:50] holiness
[11:51] fear before him holy earth
[11:55] say among the heathen that the lord
[11:57] remembered
[11:58] the world also shall be established
[12:01] that it shall not be moved
[12:03] he shall judge the people righteously
[12:06] let the heavens rejoice
[12:08] and let the earth be glad
[12:10] let the sea roar and the fullness
[12:12] thereof let the feast be joyful and all
[12:15] that is therein then shall all the trees
[12:17] of the wood rejoice
[12:19] before
[12:20] the lord
[12:22] for he cometh
[12:23] and he committed judge the earth
[12:25] he shall judge the world with
[12:27] righteousness
[12:28] and the people with his truth tonight
[12:31] i want to extract
[12:33] something from that verse 9 there
[12:36] and it says worship the lord
[12:39] in the beauty of holiness
[12:41] and for title to give this bible study
[12:44] tonight
[12:45] i want to call it
[12:46] the beauty
[12:48] of holiness
[12:50] that's the title
[12:51] uh i want to give it tonight the beauty
[12:53] of holi
[12:56] uh
[12:57] you know we talk about yoga gyro
[12:59] gorgeous provider
[13:01] and
[13:02] what is a healer called the liver corres
[13:07] i am that i am i am and
[13:10] whatever
[13:11] you have need of he he has and he will
[13:14] provide and so on
[13:16] but there is one distinction
[13:19] in
[13:20] of him
[13:23] that
[13:25] defines him
[13:27] than any other being or person or any
[13:29] other thing
[13:30] and that is his holiness
[13:33] and we were not born holy
[13:35] actually
[13:36] as you know we were born in sin and
[13:39] shape iniquity
[13:41] and of time you would hear say that
[13:45] when moses came to
[13:47] the children of israel to bring them out
[13:49] the only hearing about this god he
[13:52] didn't notice god moses met this god
[13:55] moses
[13:56] was in his presence in the burning bush
[13:59] and so on
[14:00] so god told moses bring them to this
[14:03] mountain
[14:05] and bringing them to the mountain was to
[14:06] teach them
[14:08] to reveal himself to them
[14:10] to share his thoughts and word with them
[14:12] because they didn't know him and i want
[14:14] you to see us tonight in israel
[14:17] as not knowing god the way
[14:20] he's supposed to know him
[14:21] and how we're supposed to know him in
[14:23] that way
[14:24] and having a design in your heart you
[14:26] want to know him
[14:28] not just as a provider to give you bread
[14:30] and food on your table
[14:32] not just as a protector
[14:34] you have a shelter you protect it from
[14:36] evil and harm and danger all of that is
[14:37] different attributes
[14:39] but to know him
[14:42] in the beauty of
[14:44] holiness
[14:46] so god help us tonight help me tonight
[14:48] it's a thought that struck my heart and
[14:50] i said i will
[14:51] dig into it and look into it
[14:53] and and it was really something else in
[14:55] going through what we're going to share
[14:56] tonight
[14:58] so let's
[14:59] let's go forward now
[15:02] this thing about beauty
[15:04] and i want to look at
[15:07] this is exodus chapter 28 when god was
[15:11] telling them about making the garments
[15:14] for era
[15:15] and this is
[15:17] exodus
[15:19] chapter 28 verse 1.
[15:22] and i want you to see
[15:24] how god see beauty and i wish i don't
[15:27] have it tonight but i know there's
[15:28] somebody who put out a nice drawing of
[15:30] this how it looks it's really really
[15:32] beautiful the priest garment listen to
[15:34] the description here
[15:36] of
[15:37] reading from chapter 28
[15:39] and read in verse 1
[15:41] and take down unto thee aaron thy
[15:43] brother and his sons with him
[15:45] from among the children of israel that
[15:47] he may minister unto me
[15:49] in the priest's office
[15:51] evan aaron
[15:57] aaron's sons
[15:59] and thou shall make holy garments for
[16:01] iran
[16:02] arana iran thy brother
[16:05] here what for
[16:06] for glory
[16:08] and for beauty
[16:10] now this is god speaking here
[16:12] and this is how god wants
[16:15] the objective of the garment
[16:18] and then those three
[16:20] we begin the details why and everything
[16:23] else and those shall speak unto all
[16:25] that are wise-hearted
[16:28] whom
[16:29] i are filled
[16:31] with the spirit of wisdom
[16:34] and that they may make aaron's garment
[16:37] to consecrate him
[16:39] that he may minister unto me in the
[16:42] priest office
[16:43] so god is saying these people who have
[16:46] the gift
[16:47] and talent
[16:48] are inspired by me
[16:50] to do this
[16:51] with four
[16:53] and these are the garments which they
[16:55] shall make
[16:57] a breastplate
[16:58] an effort
[17:00] a robe
[17:02] a broided coat a might
[17:05] a girdle
[17:06] and they shall make holy garments for
[17:09] aaron thy brother and his sons
[17:11] that he may minister unto me
[17:14] in the priest's office
[17:16] they shall take gold and blue and purple
[17:19] and scarlet
[17:21] and fine linen they shall make the
[17:23] effort of gold of blue of purple of
[17:25] scarlet
[17:27] and fine-twined linen with cunning wood
[17:30] it shall have two pieces there are
[17:33] joined
[17:34] at the two edges thereof so shall be
[17:36] joined together
[17:38] and
[17:39] the curious girdle of the ephod which is
[17:41] upon it shall be of the same according
[17:44] to the work thereof even of gold
[17:46] of blue of purple
[17:48] and scarlet and fine twine linen
[17:50] thou shall take two onix stones grave on
[17:53] them the names of the children of israel
[17:56] six of their names on one stone and the
[17:58] other six names and the rest of the
[18:00] other stones
[18:02] according to their booth
[18:04] but the work of an engraver in stone by
[18:07] the engravings of a signet shall thou
[18:09] engrave the two stones with the names of
[18:11] the children of israel
[18:13] thou shalt make them to be set in arches
[18:16] of gold
[18:17] and thou shall put the two stones upon
[18:19] the shoulders of the effort for stones
[18:21] of memorial under the children of israel
[18:24] and eren shall bear their names before
[18:26] the lord okay
[18:29] so i'm going to stop there
[18:31] and
[18:33] okay i'm going to stop it but i read
[18:35] that for you to show you one maybe when
[18:37] you have time you can go and read it
[18:39] just show you the details of
[18:43] how god want
[18:45] beauty and glory for the garments of the
[18:47] priests because the office that will
[18:50] represent him now i don't want to see
[18:52] priests
[18:53] as just iran and ministry and whatnot
[18:56] because you are called to be kings and
[18:58] priests
[18:59] after the order of course of manchester
[19:01] we are called
[19:02] into this priesthood so to speak oh
[19:05] let's continue now
[19:07] isaiah 38 was it says
[19:10] and a highway shall be dear
[19:13] and away
[19:15] and it shall be called
[19:17] the way of holiness
[19:19] the unclean shall not pass over it
[19:22] but it shall be for those
[19:24] the way fearing men
[19:26] though fools
[19:28] shall not kill therein
[19:30] so i want you to say tonight that god
[19:32] speaks up a highway
[19:34] and in that highway
[19:36] let's call that highway
[19:38] the broadway
[19:41] and let's call
[19:43] the way of holiness
[19:45] the narrow way
[19:47] away
[19:48] in the middle of the highway
[19:51] so let's say this road this highway is
[19:53] all of christianity
[19:56] all the different churches and people
[19:58] from different churches and different
[19:59] groups but amidst all of that
[20:03] there's a we call
[20:05] the way of
[20:06] holiness
[20:07] and i trust that god help us tonight to
[20:09] see clearly that way he's talking about
[20:13] okay
[20:14] deuteronomy chapter 14 verse 2
[20:18] says
[20:19] for dawah the holy people
[20:21] unto the lord thy god
[20:24] and the lord
[20:25] had chosen thee
[20:27] to be a peculiar people unto himself
[20:31] above all the nations
[20:34] that are upon the earth
[20:37] so this is god's thinking
[20:39] of getting a people
[20:41] that one
[20:42] they'll be holy unto him
[20:44] two
[20:46] they'll be peculiar or different
[20:49] or unique
[20:51] in other words
[20:52] we as believers cannot be as same as
[20:56] those unbelievers or those in the world
[20:59] we are called to be
[21:01] peculiar
[21:03] different
[21:04] you have to see that
[21:06] that you're called to be apart
[21:09] separated
[21:11] unto god
[21:12] this is
[21:13] a high calling and that is what we are
[21:15] called to
[21:17] now
[21:18] the word sanctification sanctified
[21:22] is means to be made holy or consecrated
[21:25] and sanctification
[21:27] i think we did it some time back in the
[21:29] bible study is the will of god
[21:32] first thessalonians four
[21:35] very interested in scripture
[21:37] first testament for we want to refuse
[21:39] one to seven it says furthermore
[21:42] then we beseech you brethren and exhort
[21:44] you by the lord jesus that you have
[21:47] received of us how you ought to walk
[21:50] and to please god
[21:51] and so should have bond more and more
[21:54] for you know that commandments we give
[21:56] you by the lord jesus
[21:58] for this is the will of god
[22:01] the will of god even your
[22:03] sanctification
[22:05] that you should abstain
[22:07] from fornication
[22:09] and that every one of you
[22:11] should know how
[22:13] to possess his vessel
[22:16] in sanctification and honor
[22:19] not in the loss of concussive sense
[22:22] even as a gentiles which knew not god
[22:25] that no man
[22:27] go beyond and before his brother in any
[22:29] matter because that the lord is the
[22:31] avenger of all such
[22:32] and we also have forewarned you and
[22:35] testify
[22:36] for god
[22:37] but not call us to unclean us
[22:40] but under holiness
[22:43] so this
[22:44] what we are sharing tonight
[22:46] has nothing to do with church
[22:48] going to church
[22:50] and and and
[22:52] and you belong to a group or you go to
[22:53] this church or whatever
[22:56] this is the calling of god i want to
[22:58] read this in the amplified furthermore
[23:00] brethren we beg and admonish you in
[23:03] virtue of our union with the lord jesus
[23:06] that you follow
[23:07] the instructions which you learn from us
[23:11] about how you ought to walk so as to
[23:13] please
[23:15] and gratify god
[23:17] this has nothing to do with pleasing
[23:19] church it has to do with god as indeed
[23:22] you are doing and you have to do so even
[23:24] more and more abundantly
[23:26] attaining greater perfection in living
[23:29] this life
[23:30] for you know that charge and precepts we
[23:33] give you
[23:34] on the authority and by inspiration of
[23:36] the lord jesus
[23:37] that this is the will of god that you
[23:39] should be consecrated
[23:41] and that consecrated here in the
[23:42] amplified says
[23:44] excuse me separated and set apart
[23:47] for pure and holy living
[23:50] that you should abstain
[23:52] and shrink from
[23:54] all sexual advice
[23:57] that each one of you should know
[24:00] how
[24:00] to possess
[24:02] and that process is to control
[24:05] manage his own body
[24:08] in consecration
[24:09] purity separated from things profane and
[24:12] honor
[24:13] not to be used in the passion of lust
[24:16] like the heathen
[24:18] who are ignorant
[24:20] of the true god
[24:22] and have no knowledge of his will
[24:24] that no man transgress and overreach his
[24:26] brother and defraud him in this matter
[24:28] or before his brother in business for
[24:30] the lord is an adventure of all these
[24:32] things as we have already warned you
[24:34] firmly and told you plainly for god has
[24:37] not called us to impurity
[24:39] but the consecration
[24:41] to dedicate ourselves to the most
[24:47] thorough
[24:49] purity
[24:50] so i hope this strike you tonight since
[24:53] that i think we're drilling down
[24:56] with the heart
[24:57] with the mind
[24:59] with what god requires of us
[25:01] and it's not i have any message
[25:03] and i have a a good pastor or a good
[25:06] teacher or good apostle or whatever
[25:08] or i belong to this i belong to that
[25:10] is whether or not you are prepared
[25:12] tonight to take the next step because it
[25:16] is a step
[25:17] to get closer to god
[25:19] or
[25:20] to take the next step in what god
[25:21] requires of us
[25:23] okay so let's continue
[25:25] go praise the lord
[25:26] for the brown he was referring to this
[25:29] in the church ages i know that i work
[25:31] scripture by labor like patience as he
[25:34] walks in the midst of his church
[25:36] he's aware of the suffering of his
[25:38] people and he cares
[25:40] as it was in the days of the captivity
[25:42] in egypt when he heard a cries
[25:44] he who never changes still hear the
[25:47] cries of the oppressed
[25:49] as he walks among them
[25:51] the very word labor
[25:53] signifies awareness to oppression
[25:56] god's people do not only work for him in
[25:59] a labor of love
[26:01] but they suffer for him with joy
[26:03] they are patient
[26:04] and bearing the yoke
[26:06] this first aid suffered great
[26:08] persecution it had to work hard to
[26:11] preach the gospel
[26:13] and the shed for truth
[26:15] their high calling in life
[26:17] was to serve god
[26:19] and when their hopes in life were
[26:21] blighted they were patient
[26:24] and committed all to him
[26:26] who would promise a lasting recompense
[26:28] in him for what they had given up for
[26:31] him on earth
[26:32] i think we ought to stop here and deal
[26:34] with the thought
[26:36] that god's people have always been and
[26:39] always will be persecuted
[26:42] you know that genesis is the book of the
[26:43] beginnings you find starting there will
[26:45] carry right on through the revelation
[26:47] never change
[26:48] we see that cain persecuted and killed
[26:50] either
[26:51] because the latter pleased god
[26:53] we see a perfect picture of abraham the
[26:55] son of the flesh ishmael who teased and
[26:58] fought with the son of promise isaac
[27:00] there was esau who hated jacob would
[27:03] have killed him
[27:04] had not god intervened in the new
[27:06] testament we find judas between jesus
[27:08] while the religious orders of the first
[27:10] century attempted to destroy the early
[27:12] believers
[27:14] the children of this world
[27:16] controlled by the devil
[27:19] hate the children of god
[27:22] who are controlled
[27:23] by the spirit
[27:25] here we go
[27:27] no matter how just and upright a
[27:29] christian is before the public
[27:31] and how gracious he is to his fellow man
[27:34] doing not but good
[27:36] let him confess christ as his savior
[27:38] and acknowledge the operation of the
[27:40] gifts of the holy spirit in tongues
[27:43] prophecy
[27:44] healing and miracles and he will be
[27:46] condemned
[27:47] the spirit of this world
[27:50] hates
[27:51] the spirit of god
[27:52] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[27:55] of god
[27:56] it tries to destroy the vessel
[28:00] in whom the spirit of god dwells
[28:03] persecution and trials are a natural
[28:07] normal part
[28:09] of the christian life i think that would
[28:11] reason again
[28:13] persecution and trials are a natural
[28:17] normal part
[28:19] of the christian life
[28:20] there's only one thing you can do about
[28:22] them
[28:23] commit them all to god
[28:25] judge them
[28:27] leave their own working and final
[28:28] judgment to him
[28:30] though can't not bear them which are
[28:32] evil scripture continues and that was
[28:34] tried them
[28:35] would say their apostles and are not
[28:38] and has found them liars
[28:41] these ephesians
[28:42] believed that god's people ought to be
[28:45] holy oh could we give the lord a praise
[28:47] offering tonight
[28:49] these
[28:50] ephesians
[28:52] believe
[28:54] that god's people ought to be holy
[28:57] according to this verse
[28:59] they took steps
[29:01] to keep the body unleavened from sin
[29:05] remember we talk about the unleavened
[29:06] bread of sincerity and truth and sunday
[29:08] right
[29:09] but they took steps to keep the body
[29:12] unleavened from sin most evidently
[29:15] the apostasy had already started
[29:18] sin
[29:19] had entered into the church
[29:21] but they were obedient to the words of
[29:23] poor
[29:24] when he said to put away the wicked from
[29:26] amongst them
[29:27] they were separated people
[29:30] they had come out of the world
[29:32] and now they weren't going to let the
[29:34] world enter amongst them
[29:37] they were not put they would not put up
[29:40] with sin in the church
[29:42] holiness
[29:44] wasn't a phrase with them
[29:46] or a figure of speech
[29:48] it was a way
[29:50] of life
[29:52] oh could we give the lord some praises
[29:53] tonight
[29:55] are we going to get back to that
[29:57] where holiness becomes
[29:59] not a phrase
[30:01] not a figure of speech
[30:03] but a way of life because this is what
[30:05] the origin
[30:07] and we have to get back there
[30:09] now
[30:11] let's continue
[30:13] and i believe this is from hebrews 12
[30:16] and it says here and you have universe
[30:18] five and you are forgotten
[30:21] the exhortation which speak it unto you
[30:23] as unto children my son
[30:25] despite not though the chastening of the
[30:27] lord so we will see
[30:29] how
[30:30] in this trial and testing
[30:32] road which is the narrow path or let me
[30:35] say because that was chosen this is the
[30:38] harder way in narrow way you walk in
[30:41] your own choosing and some of you
[30:42] tonight would be challenged to make a
[30:45] choice tonight as to the way that you're
[30:47] going to walk and we identify that way
[30:50] already is called the way of holiness so
[30:52] peter is drilling down here paul he says
[30:55] now my son
[30:57] despise not the chastening of the lord
[31:00] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[31:03] for whom the lord love it the sexy
[31:05] chastener
[31:06] and scorch it every son you receive it
[31:09] if you end your chastening god delivered
[31:12] you as with sons for what son is he whom
[31:15] the father chasteneth not but if ye
[31:18] without chastisement where if all are
[31:20] partakers then your pastors are not sons
[31:23] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[31:25] flesh which corrected us and they give
[31:27] us
[31:28] and we give them reverence shall we not
[31:30] much rather gave me subjection unto the
[31:33] father of spirits and live
[31:34] for the verily for a few days chasing us
[31:36] after their own pleasure
[31:39] but he for our prophet
[31:40] listen listen
[31:42] so he's saying natural father chastened
[31:45] us we give them respects and so on and
[31:46] jesus for our pleasure for their
[31:48] pleasure but god for our prophet any
[31:50] objective of that
[31:52] that we
[31:53] might be partakers of his
[31:57] holiness
[31:58] hallelujah so the objective of
[32:00] chastening the whip the rebuking the
[32:03] correction is for us to be
[32:07] and you can say it out with me tonight
[32:09] partakers of his holiness repeat after
[32:11] me
[32:12] partakers of his holiness
[32:15] that is the objective
[32:17] because we don't know god in that way we
[32:20] don't understand his holiness there is
[32:22] no measure to it you could say you could
[32:25] say like the teacher in your class with
[32:27] a very a great man or wise man you could
[32:30] say this brother is very knowledgeable
[32:32] you could say this man is a great father
[32:35] you could say this man is a very good
[32:36] prime minister or president or whatever
[32:38] it is but you cannot say this man is
[32:40] holy that teacher is a holy man
[32:43] you can't see that
[32:44] the
[32:45] person you could point that to his god
[32:48] he is god and he is holy it's the
[32:51] quality
[32:52] that that of what he's made up of and
[32:55] because
[32:56] we are born in sin and shape in liberty
[32:58] our desires is skewed
[33:01] our motive or objective is skewed
[33:04] he said the heart is most deceitful who
[33:06] can know it but god so god offer he's a
[33:10] new heart i will give you a new spirit
[33:12] i'll put within you and then i put my
[33:14] spirit in your spirit he said let's
[33:16] exchange do your sins be a scarlet they
[33:18] shall be right as well so what god wants
[33:20] to do with man full man and a man who
[33:24] want to serve the lord is given exchange
[33:26] you're drinking you're smoking that's
[33:28] what am i going to do run young woman
[33:29] carrying on adultery fornication
[33:31] everything else but then he comes a
[33:33] bigger heart operation to change
[33:35] your desires
[33:37] but that is what it's all about to give
[33:39] you a new nature to give you a new
[33:41] desire so the desire for drinking if you
[33:44] move desire to lust is removed desire to
[33:46] run around and fool around is removed
[33:48] and as that comes out by the operation
[33:50] of the spirit you find your desire
[33:52] changes for the things of god the things
[33:54] of the word things of heaven the things
[33:56] of righteousness
[33:58] knowing that is not your works
[34:00] understand this knowing that is not your
[34:01] ability is god's grace
[34:03] because we are redeemed by the blood of
[34:05] the lamb do you believe that tonight oh
[34:08] blessed be the name of the lord
[34:09] now
[34:11] okay
[34:13] let's continue now romans 13
[34:15] 11
[34:16] to 14 is a familiar scripture but i
[34:18] think it will it will be seen fresh
[34:21] tonight
[34:22] and romans 13 verse 11 and that knowing
[34:25] the time
[34:26] that noah is the high time to awake
[34:30] out of sleep
[34:32] for now is our salvation nearer than
[34:34] when we believed the night is far spent
[34:37] days at hand let us therefore cast out
[34:39] the work of darkness and let us put on
[34:43] the armor of light let us walk honestly
[34:46] as in the day not in writing and
[34:48] drunkenness not in chambering
[34:50] unwantedness not in strife and envying
[34:54] here we go verse 14 do i want to get to
[34:56] but put you on the lord jesus christ and
[34:58] make
[34:59] not
[35:00] provisions for the flesh to fulfill
[35:04] the lust thereof in other words don't
[35:08] set yourself up to fall in the flesh
[35:10] don't set yourself up to be going on
[35:13] lusting and carrying on don't set
[35:14] yourself up don't make provisions for
[35:17] that
[35:18] so what is what is holiness
[35:22] how can we identify holiness
[35:29] we are not born with it
[35:33] you could we could only have holiness
[35:36] to the extent that we know god
[35:38] because god alone is holy first peter
[35:41] says here he says um
[35:43] this is first peter one
[35:45] and peter's saying here elect
[35:47] verse two rather first peter chapter one
[35:49] was to elect according to the four
[35:52] knowledge of god the father
[35:54] through sanctification of the spirit
[35:56] unto obedience so okay let's let's take
[35:59] that slowly
[36:01] okay so peter is speaking to the church
[36:02] scattered to pontus galatia the producer
[36:05] asia and virginia he's an elect this is
[36:07] true of first peter
[36:09] chapter one elect according to the four
[36:12] knowledge of god so that's one part
[36:14] that's god's mind
[36:16] true sanctification of the spirit that's
[36:18] done here now
[36:19] unto obedience and the sprinkling of the
[36:23] blood of jesus christ grace unto you
[36:25] peace be multiplied
[36:27] and then peter begins blessed be the god
[36:30] and father of our lord jesus christ
[36:32] which according to his abundant mercy
[36:34] had begotten us again unto a lively hope
[36:37] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[36:38] the dead to an inheritance incorruptible
[36:41] and undefined that freedom of the way
[36:44] reserve in heaven for you who are kept
[36:47] by the power of god through faith unto
[36:49] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[36:52] last time
[36:53] wherein he greatly rejoiced don't know
[36:56] for season if need be you're in
[36:58] heaviness through
[37:00] manifold temptations so peter send them
[37:02] up to heaven show them the other
[37:03] inheritance and it's undefiled they feel
[37:06] another way it is reserved it's reserved
[37:08] but you're going to stop now
[37:10] that the trial of your fate being more
[37:14] precious than of golden person so these
[37:16] christians were going through a rough
[37:18] time a tough time
[37:19] and they were in heaviness through
[37:21] manifold temptations i was six seven you
[37:24] identify those temptations and all those
[37:27] heaviness that's the trial of your fate
[37:29] be more precious than of gold that
[37:32] parachute do it be tribal fire might be
[37:35] fun unto praise honor and glory at the
[37:38] appearing of jesus christ
[37:40] whom have we not seen you love in whom
[37:43] though now you see and not yet believe
[37:45] in you rejoice with joy and speakable
[37:48] and full of glory
[37:49] receiving the end
[37:51] of your faith even the salvation of your
[37:53] souls of which salvation the prophets
[37:55] have inquired and searched diligently
[37:58] and prophesied
[37:59] of the grace that should come unto you
[38:01] certain
[38:03] of what manner of time the spirit of
[38:06] christ which was in them did signify
[38:08] when it testified beforehand the
[38:10] sufferings
[38:12] of christ and the glory that should
[38:13] follow
[38:14] let's jump to verse 13. wherefore
[38:17] gird up the loins of your mind
[38:19] be sober and hope to the end for the
[38:22] grace that is brought unto you at the
[38:24] revelation of jesus christ
[38:26] let's go to 14 now as obedient children
[38:29] here we go
[38:30] not
[38:31] fashioning yourselves according to the
[38:34] former lust in your ignorance
[38:37] but as he which have called you is holy
[38:40] be holy in all manner of conversation
[38:44] now that word conversation is not like
[38:45] talk not like fellowshipping that word
[38:48] conversation means manner of life okay
[38:51] so verse 16
[38:53] because it is written
[38:54] be holy for i am holy
[38:58] and if you call on the father
[39:02] who without respect of persons judge it
[39:05] according to every man's work
[39:08] pass the time of your sergeant here in
[39:11] fear
[39:13] now that is
[39:15] that speaks for itself in other words
[39:18] you can
[39:19] you cannot carry about yourself if you
[39:21] have no fear of god
[39:22] they say to you for as much
[39:25] as you know
[39:27] that you will not redeem with
[39:28] corruptable things as silver and gold
[39:30] from your vain
[39:32] conversation or manner of life received
[39:34] by tradition of your fathers
[39:36] but with the precious blood of jesus
[39:39] christ
[39:40] as of the lamb laminator blemish and
[39:41] without spot
[39:43] who verily was foreign
[39:45] before the foundation of the world but
[39:47] was made manifest in these last times
[39:51] so in the amplified that verse 15 says
[39:53] but as the one who called you is holy
[39:55] you yourself also be holy in your
[39:58] conduct
[39:59] and manner of living
[40:01] for it is written
[40:03] you shall be holy for i am holy
[40:07] now from the random question announced
[40:09] on genesis he was saying that there were
[40:10] ten men to meet the bergen
[40:12] jesus said so that's right how many
[40:14] agree with that see amen consciousness
[40:16] says amen time went to meet him no watch
[40:18] all of them were holy
[40:20] well
[40:22] in order to be holy they had to be
[40:24] sanctified
[40:26] so sanctified
[40:28] means
[40:29] being made holy because that's the only
[40:33] cleansing
[40:34] holy stream that god has
[40:36] is sanctification
[40:38] now watch
[40:39] all ten of them were sanctified but five
[40:42] didn't have
[40:44] any oil in their lap
[40:46] five had oil in their lamb is that right
[40:49] what does oil represent not not the
[40:51] purity the virginity all represent the
[40:53] holy spirit
[40:54] okay
[40:56] so now i think
[40:58] sometime back
[41:00] i spoke about uh
[41:02] um the the wise virgins and the elect
[41:04] and so on like that but here it is to
[41:07] come now to
[41:08] not just living any life
[41:11] you're talking about the first
[41:14] holy spirit
[41:15] the first clot
[41:17] or out of the cloth of sanctification
[41:19] he's cutting out a bride
[41:21] let me rephrase that
[41:23] out of this
[41:26] holiness bunch or sanctified bunch
[41:29] there's a bunch in the bunch that's
[41:31] going to ask for oil or get extra oil
[41:34] the rest will be sanctified so in other
[41:36] words the unsanctified life
[41:39] not even counter
[41:41] don't even talk wrapped at all
[41:43] don't even talk rapture
[41:46] unsanctified life heading for
[41:47] tribulation
[41:48] let me say it good
[41:50] or let me rephrase it on holy life
[41:54] head in for tribulation
[41:55] so if your life not as it's supposed to
[41:57] be
[41:58] you have an opportunity tonight
[42:01] to get it right
[42:02] or to refocus
[42:04] or be transformed by your mind being
[42:07] renewed
[42:09] and the prophet said justification okay
[42:11] you're filthy you're dirty you're
[42:13] smoking drinking you're sinner you'll
[42:14] give you are to be lord is picking up a
[42:16] beauty glass
[42:18] sanctification is
[42:20] washing the glass preparing a glass
[42:23] and setting your mind in order for
[42:26] holiness
[42:27] so you can't bring in your stuff
[42:30] into god's plan and program
[42:32] you can't drag all your stuff whatever
[42:35] you used to do and how you should do it
[42:37] no
[42:38] that is what you used to do
[42:40] what you are setting your mind for is to
[42:42] see you know what god say be holy it's a
[42:46] command and i'll get it for i am holy
[42:49] it's not a suggestion you know you know
[42:50] it you should live a clean life you know
[42:52] you know
[42:53] it's a good thing to do some moral
[42:54] things that's not what he's saying here
[42:57] this is a requirement
[43:00] i'm not talking about sunday sanctifying
[43:02] i'm not talking about wednesday nights
[43:04] and people
[43:05] i'm not talking about when you go to
[43:07] church you're holy and when you're not
[43:09] in church you're unholy no
[43:11] this is
[43:13] a way
[43:14] of
[43:15] life
[43:16] there's a highway and a way and the way
[43:19] shall be called the way of holiness oh
[43:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[43:24] so brother brian said no you said i i
[43:26] don't think i am okay
[43:28] he said i want to be holy but if the
[43:30] lord ever told me to rule i guess i will
[43:32] rule but i want you see what i said i
[43:34] want to be holy anyhow and live a life
[43:38] of holiness means cleanness before god
[43:42] oh my
[43:44] and if there is one person that
[43:47] got an experience that
[43:49] transformed his life is isaiah
[43:52] and we want to go to isaiah 6 a family
[43:54] scripture we want to read them one to
[43:55] seven isaiah we know was leaning on king
[43:58] uzziah the musa was a king he tried to
[44:01] play priests
[44:02] he went and interfere with the incense
[44:04] and whatnot they beg him don't do that
[44:06] and he got leprosy and he died
[44:08] and when he died
[44:09] it shook up the prophet isaiah
[44:12] as i hustled into the temple
[44:15] i began to crowd into god
[44:17] and god gave him an experience
[44:20] not just a word but an actual experience
[44:24] and we want to look again at that
[44:25] experience tonight in the context of
[44:28] what is being presented tonight
[44:30] isaiah chapter six
[44:31] i don't want you to see it as a
[44:33] scripture text but you're here already
[44:35] and you're ready already
[44:36] but i want you to see what is required
[44:38] of us
[44:39] of you
[44:40] of me is up to six reading
[44:43] verse one
[44:45] in the year that king judge died
[44:48] i saw also the lord sitting upon a
[44:50] throne
[44:52] high and lifted up
[44:54] and the stream filled the temple
[44:57] above it stood the seraphims each one
[44:59] had six wings
[45:00] between two wings he covered his face
[45:03] between two wings he covered his feet
[45:06] and between he did fly
[45:09] and one cried unto another and said holy
[45:11] holy holy
[45:12] is the lord of hosts
[45:14] the whole earth is full of his glory
[45:17] and the post of the door moved at the
[45:20] voice of him that cried
[45:22] and the house was filled with smoke
[45:25] then said i
[45:27] who is me now
[45:29] before we continue dear pull it right
[45:31] there then say that who is me
[45:34] this is a prophet
[45:36] it's not a pastor there's another
[45:37] teacher
[45:39] this is a prophet this is a man that
[45:41] speaks
[45:42] on behalf of god
[45:44] look
[45:46] at the effect
[45:48] of presence
[45:51] look at the effect of god's holiness
[45:55] look at the effect
[45:57] what effect it has do you see arrogance
[46:01] do you see pride
[46:03] do you see a man
[46:05] seen himself up there somewhere
[46:08] hear what isaiah said
[46:10] who is me
[46:11] for i am undone
[46:13] because i'm a man of unclean lips
[46:16] and i dwell in the midst of a people of
[46:19] unclean lips
[46:20] for my eyes i've seen the king
[46:23] the lord of hosts
[46:25] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[46:28] having a life call in his hand which he
[46:30] had taken from the tongues of the altar
[46:33] now this here
[46:34] is not a message simon
[46:36] these aren't an attacks is that a man
[46:39] preaching revelations and mysteries and
[46:41] unfold the word and open up the bible
[46:43] and open up this and open these are open
[46:46] this is a man
[46:48] that come into presence
[46:51] and baraban said the seraphims
[46:53] are the burners
[46:55] they are the one that presents the
[46:58] worshipper
[46:59] and brings them into god's presence
[47:02] so they are in charge of this
[47:04] sanctifying
[47:06] fire baptizing
[47:08] and
[47:09] purifying
[47:11] you haven't had god yet because to get
[47:13] rid of god you have to pass these beings
[47:15] these beings oh glory around the
[47:18] children of god they cried day and night
[47:19] holy holy lord god almighty holy holy
[47:23] they're not stopping two wings to cover
[47:25] their feast humility
[47:26] irreverence two wings they cover their
[47:28] feet and humility and two wings they in
[47:30] action in action in humility and
[47:32] reverence that's how the ministry is
[47:34] supposed to be in action in humility in
[47:37] reference a little child could talk to
[47:38] you anybody could correct you anybody
[47:40] could to bring a word for you you're not
[47:42] above anybody oh hallelujah because the
[47:44] presence of god that dania one dead to
[47:48] john book of revelation he fell as one
[47:49] did the presence have one effect upon
[47:52] man it shows man littleness it shows we
[47:56] are nothing it shows me about us it
[47:58] shows that we can't even stand in the
[48:00] presence but the man says for days he
[48:02] was numb and the angel presence break
[48:04] upon him oh my god hallelujah then flew
[48:08] one of the surfaces of me having a life
[48:10] call in his hand which he had taken from
[48:12] the tungsten of the altar is that a
[48:14] silence i believe no this is something
[48:17] active this is a live call like i call
[48:19] on fire he laid it upon my mouth and he
[48:22] said lo this has touched my lips and
[48:26] that iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[48:30] is purged
[48:31] hallelujah and we know this other part
[48:34] of scripture when the lord the voice of
[48:35] god said who shall go for us he said he
[48:36] are my lord send me he had confessed
[48:40] he was purged
[48:41] and he got a commission
[48:43] three wings action humility and
[48:46] reverence
[48:47] and brother brown was singing the song
[48:48] millions now and sin and she went down

[49:27] lords and
[49:29] then begin to pray begin to pray said
[49:31] heavenly father
[49:33] let us be the depths of our heart lord
[49:35] truly
[49:36] millions know in sin and jim are dying
[49:38] right here in the city of phoenix
[49:40] literally thousands grouping in sin
[49:43] and here we stand this morning
[49:45] enthralled with the presence of the holy
[49:47] spirit we are all conscious of his
[49:50] august presence i feel him in my heart
[49:53] i feel him among the people oh god
[49:56] may a vision come to us
[49:59] that we can see
[50:01] the holiness of god
[50:03] and see
[50:05] how little we are
[50:07] may the temple post we move in our
[50:10] presence
[50:11] and there while we are in his presence
[50:13] lord
[50:14] may the power
[50:15] of the holy spirit just shake us o lord
[50:19] that not only the temple shall be moved
[50:21] but the post in our hearts will be moved
[50:24] the post of indifference that let the
[50:27] poor the door of god's opportunity to
[50:29] come in be moved and the stone of
[50:32] unbelief taken away
[50:33] and let us lord answer quickly master
[50:36] i humble myself
[50:38] i wonder wings over my feet
[50:40] over my face first lord humble me
[50:43] that i might influence others granted
[50:45] lord
[50:46] or give the lord some praise right now
[50:48] my lord i feel his presence i want you
[50:50] to write where you are begin to just
[50:52] give god some praises
[50:53] and worship him oh right now
[50:56] but abraham
[50:57] god can do without you
[51:00] he can do without me
[51:02] but we can't do without him
[51:04] we have got to have him for his life
[51:08] and he alone
[51:10] not to know his book
[51:12] not to know this no doubt or know the
[51:14] creed
[51:15] but to know him his life
[51:17] know him as the person christ in you the
[51:20] word made flesh in you that's knowing
[51:22] him
[51:23] when you and he become one like i said
[51:25] last night in the super sign he has got
[51:28] to come in you
[51:30] god and man must come one
[51:32] and here is bomb
[51:34] you are conscious
[51:36] of your littleness i wonder how much
[51:38] ministers conscious of their living
[51:42] i've met believers and ministers and
[51:44] pastors and different people so arrogant
[51:46] nobody could talk
[51:47] nobody can tell them anything at all
[51:49] they know it all they have it all
[51:51] but
[51:52] what i am seeing
[51:54] like how the prophet said he said
[51:57] intellectually we are hearing the
[51:58] message how we need to lay in the
[52:01] presence of the sun till our fate isn't
[52:03] ripe enough we need to lay in the
[52:04] presence what what laying in the
[52:06] presence means you know in church and
[52:08] you know five hours someone but lean in
[52:11] the presence really me
[52:13] the presence of god because when isaiah
[52:16] come into that presence
[52:18] it transformed his life never be the
[52:20] same after that never
[52:22] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[52:24] so what you are conscious
[52:26] of your littleness in closing i might
[52:28] use
[52:30] other other two wings totally he could
[52:32] fly with the other two wings watch face
[52:34] covered by wholeness of god
[52:36] and in reverence his feet covered in
[52:38] humility and with two wings he could put
[52:41] himself in action to move
[52:44] god was showing his prophet
[52:48] hallelujah
[52:49] god was showing his prophet
[52:52] how
[52:53] a prepared servant ought to be
[52:56] quit looking at uzar
[52:58] here is your example i've sent before
[53:01] you cover your face in reference
[53:04] cover your feet in humility and go into
[53:06] action oh what an example he had looked
[53:09] at us so long and seen it fail
[53:13] no god was telling him what to do
[53:15] showing him
[53:17] happy at seven you see what going along
[53:21] isaiah was leaning
[53:23] on uziah
[53:25] and god allowed us to feel
[53:28] in order to get isaiah where he wanted
[53:31] him
[53:32] and god will allow people that you lead
[53:34] on to feel
[53:37] we don't want people to feel
[53:39] but god wants you to depend upon him
[53:42] god wants you to lead on lean on him
[53:46] that is what god wants
[53:47] man wants you to lean on them
[53:49] especially them message popes and
[53:51] bishops and whoever they think they are
[53:54] they want to release on them because
[53:55] they want to be like like like it's true
[53:58] which they get to god
[54:00] no
[54:01] jesus is the channel to get to god which
[54:03] is the word all they're supposed to
[54:05] present is the word i'm pointing to
[54:07] christ
[54:08] oh praise the name of the lord okay
[54:12] so
[54:14] isaiah 57 15
[54:16] this is a scripture that i love
[54:19] isaiah 57 15 if you have the bible you
[54:21] want to go to it
[54:23] and this is the scripture i i really
[54:25] love
[54:26] for those seat
[54:28] the high and lofty one
[54:30] that inhabited eternity
[54:33] whose name is
[54:36] what an introduction
[54:39] i'm not a boss
[54:40] i am not
[54:41] the person you're working for i'm not
[54:43] your husband i am not i'm not prime
[54:45] minister president
[54:47] tell me who i am
[54:48] dusty at the high and lofty one so he's
[54:51] up there that inhabits that eternity
[54:53] what time
[54:55] his whose name is holy
[54:57] i dwell
[54:59] in the high and holy place this is where
[55:01] he lives
[55:02] with him also
[55:04] o glory
[55:05] that is of our contrite and humble
[55:07] spirit
[55:09] to revive
[55:10] the spirit of the humble
[55:12] and to revive the heart
[55:14] of the contrite ones right now you
[55:16] should be giving god some praises
[55:18] because he identifies who he's going to
[55:20] work with
[55:21] he identify where he is who he is how he
[55:25] lives and who he's going to communicate
[55:27] with you're going to commit those who
[55:30] have a humble heart
[55:31] and a contrite
[55:33] and that's a broken spirit
[55:35] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[55:37] so friends
[55:40] i want you to think now
[55:43] of your approach to god
[55:46] and approaching god
[55:48] on the basis of his holiness
[55:51] you know people could approach god
[55:53] on the basis of he give things you know
[55:56] the rain falling just on just oh bless
[55:58] me lord i want a car i want a job i want
[56:00] and they get it the people have child
[56:02] like feed they ask god they get it
[56:04] and they see god as
[56:06] a blesser
[56:08] they see god as a giver
[56:10] and um what do you say he added no
[56:12] sorrow with it and so on
[56:15] and but tonight
[56:17] i want you to see your approach to god
[56:21] is approaching him by way of his
[56:23] holiness
[56:24] and what he wants of us
[56:26] because this brings
[56:28] sunday service in a deeper way
[56:31] um
[56:32] sincerity and truth
[56:33] into
[56:35] into bringing us alive
[56:36] with the holiness of god which is what
[56:38] you require of his people
[56:41] what
[56:42] makes us his people
[56:45] hallelujah is the holiness of god
[56:48] and and
[56:50] this way that we must be holy to be his
[56:52] people
[56:54] leviticus
[56:56] chapter 11. you want to look at verse 44
[56:59] to 45. the father bibles this is a bible
[57:02] study you should have your bibles
[57:03] leviticus chapter 11
[57:06] 44 and 45.
[57:08] for i am the lord your god
[57:12] you shall therefore sanctify yourselves
[57:16] and he shall be holy
[57:18] for i am holy
[57:21] neither shall you defile yourselves with
[57:23] any man of creep and things that
[57:24] creepeth upon the earth for i am the
[57:26] lord that bringeth you out of the land
[57:28] of egypt to be your god
[57:31] ye shall therefore be holy
[57:33] for i am holy
[57:35] so i want to present holiness
[57:38] as a commander from god
[57:40] another suggestion
[57:42] not an option bring up buffet style you
[57:43] take what you want
[57:45] you take this blessing you take that and
[57:46] take whatever you want
[57:48] but this part you want nothing to do
[57:50] with it in other words let me live my
[57:53] life no
[57:55] you were bored
[57:57] you were bored
[57:59] you were bought with blood
[58:02] you were bought by the most precious
[58:03] thing
[58:04] and that is why there's a landing on the
[58:06] river for you
[58:08] that is why death had no power over the
[58:10] blood watchman
[58:12] you are bought with a price you are not
[58:14] your own
[58:16] he brought you out to the pawnshop out
[58:17] to the devil's country
[58:19] to serve him
[58:21] and to worship him
[58:22] hallelujah in the beauty of holiness
[58:26] thank you lord
[58:28] let's go to leviticus chapter 19 i think
[58:30] has been the book of life with us have
[58:31] it kind of
[58:32] sick and true and we go from
[58:34] chapter 3 chapter 19 verse 1 and
[58:38] leviticus chapter 19
[58:40] verse 1 and 2
[58:42] and afterwards we go to
[58:44] late videos chapter 20.
[58:46] chapter 90 verse 1 and the lord speak
[58:48] unto moses saying speak unto all the
[58:51] congregation of the church of israel and
[58:53] say unto them
[58:55] ye shall be holy
[58:57] for i am the lord your god
[58:59] i the lord your god i'm holy
[59:02] so this is what god tell moses see until
[59:04] then let's go to leviticus chapter 20
[59:07] under verse 7 and then we go on to verse
[59:09] 26
[59:11] leviticus chapter 20 verse 7
[59:14] sanctify yourselves therefore
[59:17] and be holy
[59:19] for i am
[59:21] the lord your god
[59:24] and if you go down to 26 you will see
[59:25] this this is a powerful
[59:27] powerful verse verse 26
[59:30] of leviticus 20. and ye shall be holy
[59:33] unto me this is god speaker
[59:35] for i the lord i'm holy
[59:38] and have
[59:40] severed you from other people
[59:44] that you should be mine
[59:48] my god
[59:50] you shall be holy unto me
[59:51] for i the lord i'm holy
[59:54] and i've severed you from other people
[59:57] that you should be mine so what will
[1:00:01] separate us from other people
[1:00:04] becoming holy unto the lord
[1:00:07] so holiness
[1:00:09] is a separation
[1:00:11] between the people of god and others
[1:00:15] so
[1:00:16] family a and family b could have a ton
[1:00:18] of money
[1:00:20] a ton of boats on a car's stone or
[1:00:21] whatever
[1:00:22] but what
[1:00:24] the separation between those two
[1:00:25] families going to be the holiness
[1:00:28] the consecration the devotion to god
[1:00:32] leviticus 10
[1:00:34] going back there
[1:00:36] this is what god
[1:00:37] told the priests
[1:00:40] leviticus 10 want to read verse 8 11.
[1:00:44] and lord's faking the error and saying
[1:00:46] do not drink wine
[1:00:48] nor strong drink
[1:00:50] dull
[1:00:51] nor thy sons with thee
[1:00:54] when you go into the tabernacle of the
[1:00:56] congregation
[1:00:57] lisa die
[1:00:59] it shall be a statue forever throughout
[1:01:02] your generation
[1:01:04] that ye
[1:01:05] may put a difference
[1:01:07] between the holy and unholy
[1:01:12] between the unclean
[1:01:15] and the clean
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:17] and that he may teach the children of
[1:01:19] israel
[1:01:20] all the statutes which the lord had
[1:01:23] spoken
[1:01:24] unto them
[1:01:25] by the hand of moses
[1:01:27] now we know clearly
[1:01:29] when the anointed strike we go to the
[1:01:31] book of revelation him that is filthy
[1:01:33] filthy still
[1:01:35] in that is righteous
[1:01:36] righteous still aim that is holy
[1:01:39] holy still
[1:01:41] in other words
[1:01:42] things are going to shape up
[1:01:45] to get people almost like a picture a
[1:01:47] snap in a set condition and whatever you
[1:01:50] are then
[1:01:51] it remains
[1:01:53] holy holy still
[1:01:55] righteous righteous still
[1:01:57] wicked
[1:01:58] wicked still evil evil still full of
[1:02:01] malice
[1:02:02] malice still unforgiven unforgiven still
[1:02:05] so this tonight is a serious thing and
[1:02:08] again
[1:02:09] this is not church-based
[1:02:11] okay
[1:02:12] first peter 2
[1:02:16] 9-11
[1:02:19] remember what god said we just talked
[1:02:20] about him talking about i severed you
[1:02:24] from other people
[1:02:26] look how peter said here in first peter
[1:02:28] chapter 2 familiar scripture 9 11 but
[1:02:31] here chosen generation
[1:02:33] a royal priesthood
[1:02:36] a holy nation
[1:02:38] a peculiar people
[1:02:40] which is different
[1:02:42] strange
[1:02:43] unique
[1:02:44] different
[1:02:46] that you should show forth the praises
[1:02:48] of him
[1:02:49] who had called you out of darkness
[1:02:51] into his marvelous light
[1:02:54] which in time passed were not a people
[1:02:56] but are now
[1:02:58] the people of god
[1:03:00] which had not obtained mercy
[1:03:02] but now
[1:03:03] have obtained mercy daily beloved he is
[1:03:06] speaking to these same people now these
[1:03:08] are not unbelievers now i beseech you as
[1:03:11] strangers and pilgrims abstain
[1:03:14] from fleshly lust with war against the
[1:03:17] soul
[1:03:19] let's look at the amplified
[1:03:21] but you are chosen race a royal
[1:03:23] priesthood a dedicated nation
[1:03:25] god's own purchased
[1:03:28] special people that you may set forth
[1:03:30] the wonderful deeds and display the
[1:03:32] virtues and perfections of him
[1:03:35] who call you out of darkness
[1:03:37] in this marvelous light once you were
[1:03:39] not a people at all but now you are
[1:03:42] godspeed once you were unpitied but now
[1:03:44] you are pity that have received mercy
[1:03:47] beloved i implore you as aliens and
[1:03:50] strangers and exiles in this world to
[1:03:54] abstain from sex sensual urges the evil
[1:03:58] desires the passions of the flesh your
[1:04:01] lower nature that wage war against
[1:04:04] the soul
[1:04:06] so paul
[1:04:08] peter
[1:04:09] was presenting these thoughts these
[1:04:12] words to the church
[1:04:14] because remember we have a lower nature
[1:04:17] that's the nature we are born with and
[1:04:18] also when i want you to write
[1:04:20] wrong and you know the battle within the
[1:04:22] flesh and the spirit and they that in
[1:04:24] the flesh cannot please god it is
[1:04:26] impossible so he said uh oh god
[1:04:30] that you walk not after the flesh but
[1:04:31] after the spirit so you have to want to
[1:04:34] walk after the spirit in order to do
[1:04:35] what please
[1:04:37] god
[1:04:38] they are in the flesh cannot please god
[1:04:41] so you have to say wait a minute you
[1:04:42] mean i have to have a desire to please
[1:04:44] god yes you have to start with a thought
[1:04:46] you have to start with a desire if you
[1:04:48] never know god was holy you will know it
[1:04:50] tonight by the scriptures by the word by
[1:04:53] what he's saying or what he's expecting
[1:04:55] of us oh blessed be in the name of the
[1:04:57] lord
[1:04:58] deuteronomy oh i'll read that one
[1:04:59] already we're going to read this one
[1:05:02] deuteronomy 26
[1:05:05] verse
[1:05:06] 18 to 19.
[1:05:09] usually 26 18 to 19.
[1:05:14] and the lord had a vote d this day
[1:05:19] to be his peculiar people
[1:05:22] as he had promised thee
[1:05:24] that thou should just keep all his
[1:05:26] commandments
[1:05:28] and to make thee
[1:05:30] high
[1:05:32] above all nations which he had made
[1:05:36] in praise
[1:05:38] and in name
[1:05:40] and in honor
[1:05:42] and that thou mayest be and holy people
[1:05:45] unto the lord thy god ask yet
[1:05:48] so god's objective
[1:05:51] is to make you and i
[1:05:53] his people
[1:05:54] above all nations
[1:05:56] in praise
[1:05:58] in name
[1:06:00] in honor
[1:06:01] and that you may be holy people unto the
[1:06:03] lord as yet hope so god's holiness upon
[1:06:07] our life
[1:06:08] makes us
[1:06:09] above
[1:06:11] makes us where he could support us
[1:06:14] in a truest sense as his people
[1:06:16] are people called up
[1:06:18] are people separated
[1:06:20] are you separated
[1:06:22] are you called up
[1:06:23] do you see yourself
[1:06:25] called out to be separated unto god
[1:06:29] to serve him
[1:06:31] to serve him to love the lord thy god
[1:06:33] with all thy heart all i sow all thy
[1:06:35] strength
[1:06:36] do you see that tonight oh blessed be
[1:06:38] the name of the lord
[1:06:40] i'm in love with you again
[1:06:43] ii corinthians
[1:06:44] 7 verse 1. this is a scripture that
[1:06:47] means a lot to me
[1:06:49] it's a key scripture
[1:06:53] it's a anchor scripture and i want you
[1:06:55] to look at it really close
[1:06:58] it's a big one
[1:07:00] second corinthians chapter seven verse
[1:07:02] one
[1:07:03] have indeed for these promises daily
[1:07:05] beloved
[1:07:07] let us
[1:07:08] us
[1:07:10] cleanse ourselves
[1:07:12] from all
[1:07:14] filthiness
[1:07:16] of the flesh and spirit
[1:07:18] perfecting holiness
[1:07:21] in the fear of god
[1:07:22] i want to think about that a minute
[1:07:25] hallelujah
[1:07:26] blessed be the name of the lord let me
[1:07:28] read it again
[1:07:30] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:07:34] have india for these promises daily
[1:07:36] beloved
[1:07:37] let us cleanse ourselves
[1:07:39] from all filthiness of the flesh and
[1:07:41] spirit
[1:07:42] perfecting holiness
[1:07:44] and the fear of god perfecting
[1:07:47] what
[1:07:48] holiness
[1:07:49] and the faith of god
[1:07:51] and having therefore these promises let
[1:07:53] us let us do something
[1:07:55] otherwise
[1:07:56] there is something for us to do
[1:07:59] but abraham said if you find yourself
[1:08:00] going wrong doing things wrong he said
[1:08:03] don't just do just continue like that
[1:08:05] you could fast
[1:08:06] you could pray you could ask other
[1:08:08] people to pray with you pray for you
[1:08:10] you could get done and seek god take a
[1:08:12] three day prayer and fast and say lord
[1:08:14] deliver me clench me i've been there for
[1:08:16] these precious promises let us
[1:08:18] cleanse ourselves
[1:08:20] he says make yourself a christian
[1:08:23] get tagged at your means
[1:08:25] the deceptiveness behind the pulpits
[1:08:28] today some people deceive thinking they
[1:08:30] are christian when they are not
[1:08:32] because they haven't made yourself a
[1:08:34] christian they set the face of the
[1:08:36] prophet today to tell people once you
[1:08:38] believe that's it that's a hitting when
[1:08:41] the bible teaches that the kingdom of
[1:08:42] god is preached and every man
[1:08:44] press into it present to what
[1:08:47] if
[1:08:48] there is nothing for us to press reach
[1:08:50] sit down relax
[1:08:51] eat drink and be merry for
[1:08:53] we die
[1:08:54] but if there's a kingdom and the prophet
[1:08:56] said this way
[1:08:58] he says we are striving
[1:09:00] to enter the kingdom of god
[1:09:03] before these horrible plagues strike
[1:09:07] the plagues are coming
[1:09:09] this corona virus is like a down payment
[1:09:11] where the installment is coming but you
[1:09:14] talk about adopted sons that are going
[1:09:16] to stop cancer stop diseases stop
[1:09:20] playing stop whatever is coming there
[1:09:22] has to be a display
[1:09:24] of god's sons
[1:09:27] it's not that if it's not a but it's not
[1:09:30] a maybe it has to happen because this is
[1:09:33] what the whole creation is grown in for
[1:09:37] this is what the whole christian is
[1:09:38] growing for to see these sons manifested
[1:09:41] now remember
[1:09:43] and adam also produced other sons just
[1:09:45] like adam
[1:09:47] but before he could produce sons
[1:09:49] in his image and likeness and reflecting
[1:09:52] intent called intent and purpose he fell
[1:09:55] so then it fell into sex and that is how
[1:09:57] we born in sin
[1:09:59] but we were supposed to be spoken with
[1:10:01] sons adam speak and the word spoke eve
[1:10:04] conceive producer next son just like
[1:10:06] adam
[1:10:08] so that's when jesus came his first
[1:10:10] message the very first teachings was you
[1:10:13] must be born again of the word i love
[1:10:15] the spirit to bring us right back into
[1:10:18] how you're supposed to be back the
[1:10:19] inanimate
[1:10:20] but because adam was a seed of the word
[1:10:23] jesus was the flesh of the word and we
[1:10:25] now have to be formed into that word
[1:10:27] image so in other words adam fell a
[1:10:30] spoken word son fell
[1:10:32] in a garden with no smoke no tampee with
[1:10:34] no booze with no drink but no white
[1:10:36] woman and son he fell
[1:10:38] a man that god said let there be fell
[1:10:42] that means you could fall fall fall flat
[1:10:46] so don't think you above falling
[1:10:48] that is why we have to walk in this
[1:10:50] way this way of
[1:10:52] holiness
[1:10:54] all right
[1:10:55] let's go for another one first
[1:10:57] thessalonians
[1:10:59] three
[1:11:03] and this is paul
[1:11:05] twisted verse 11 first thessalonians
[1:11:07] chapter 3 verse 11 and paul
[1:11:09] was praying
[1:11:11] and he says hey i believe it was paul
[1:11:13] yes now god himself our father
[1:11:16] no you just don't think we pray but god
[1:11:18] himself and our father
[1:11:20] and our lord jesus christ direct our way
[1:11:23] unto you
[1:11:24] and the lord make you
[1:11:27] to increase and above in love
[1:11:30] one towards another
[1:11:31] and towards all men even as we do
[1:11:34] towards you
[1:11:35] to the end objective
[1:11:38] that he may establish your hearts
[1:11:41] unblameable in holiness before god even
[1:11:44] or far
[1:11:45] at the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:11:48] with all his saints
[1:11:49] let's read it again mr t
[1:11:52] to the end he may establish your hearts
[1:11:56] on blameable in holiness before god
[1:12:01] even our father
[1:12:03] are the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:12:05] with all his saints
[1:12:06] oh praise god
[1:12:08] this is about a brand now everybody
[1:12:10] can't be a preacher
[1:12:12] but you've got a voice
[1:12:13] and if you can't preach to people a
[1:12:15] sermon
[1:12:16] if you are preacher
[1:12:17] you're called to the pulpit to preach
[1:12:20] if you are not you are still a preacher
[1:12:22] but live the people a silver
[1:12:25] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:12:27] voice of god
[1:12:29] that will bring reproach to them who
[1:12:30] reject it they will say no one can put a
[1:12:33] finger on his whole life they are sweet
[1:12:36] living
[1:12:37] if there ever was a man of god it's that
[1:12:40] man a woman
[1:12:41] see
[1:12:42] leave your sermons don't try to preach
[1:12:44] them if you're not called to be a
[1:12:46] preacher you get all mixed up anyhow and
[1:12:48] messed up but you'll get the people
[1:12:50] tangled up and you won't know well
[1:12:52] you'll ruin them and yourself too just
[1:12:55] live yourself now the preacher is called
[1:12:57] to preach his and deliver too
[1:12:59] if you can't live it then stop preaching
[1:13:01] but you're supposed to live your sins
[1:13:03] all right there was voices oh
[1:13:06] how we need is jesseville thousands of
[1:13:09] live voices
[1:13:11] the thunder of god thundering out in
[1:13:13] sweetness
[1:13:15] and holiness
[1:13:16] and purity undefined lives
[1:13:19] walking around in the earth today
[1:13:21] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:13:23] christians
[1:13:24] that's the thunder against the enemy
[1:13:26] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:13:28] holla
[1:13:29] the devil don't care how much you can
[1:13:31] jump on what you can do this or shout
[1:13:34] but what hurts the devil
[1:13:36] is to see that sanctified
[1:13:39] holy life
[1:13:41] consecrated to god
[1:13:43] say anything to him call him anything
[1:13:45] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:13:48] right on
[1:13:49] that chosen away
[1:13:51] that's the thunder
[1:13:52] that shakes the devil
[1:13:55] almost done
[1:13:57] first thessalonians 5 this is the prayer
[1:14:02] verse 22 to 23
[1:14:05] poor
[1:14:06] abstain
[1:14:08] from all appearance of evil all
[1:14:12] 23
[1:14:13] and the very god of peace
[1:14:16] sanctify you holy
[1:14:18] and i pray god
[1:14:20] that your whole spirit
[1:14:22] and soul
[1:14:24] and body
[1:14:26] be preserved blameless under the coming
[1:14:29] of our lord jesus christ
[1:14:30] so this holiness have an effect upon
[1:14:33] your spirit
[1:14:35] upon your body
[1:14:37] and upon your soul
[1:14:39] hebrews 12 14
[1:14:42] it says follow peace with all men and
[1:14:44] holiness
[1:14:45] without which
[1:14:47] no man
[1:14:49] shall see the law
[1:14:51] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:14:54] and i believe it's about the final quote
[1:14:56] i have here
[1:15:00] the way of god is holiness this is the
[1:15:01] prophet
[1:15:03] this is to the message it says to you
[1:15:05] here believers
[1:15:07] the way
[1:15:08] of god is holiness
[1:15:11] let this be known to every member here
[1:15:14] of the body of christ
[1:15:16] until you live a holy life
[1:15:21] god
[1:15:22] refuses your sacrifice
[1:15:26] let me read it again
[1:15:28] the way of god is holiness
[1:15:31] let this be known to every member here
[1:15:34] of the body of christ
[1:15:36] until
[1:15:37] you live a holy life
[1:15:40] god refuses your sacrifice
[1:15:43] the sacrifice
[1:15:44] must be offered with holy hands
[1:15:47] the high priest before he could even
[1:15:49] come to offer the sacrifice he had to be
[1:15:52] holy
[1:15:53] and dedicated
[1:15:55] and anointed
[1:15:56] and perfumed and everything
[1:15:58] before he could even walk in the
[1:16:00] presence of god to offer sacrifice is
[1:16:02] that right
[1:16:04] then how can you go out here and cheat
[1:16:06] and steal
[1:16:08] and fuss
[1:16:09] and fight with your neighbors and
[1:16:11] everything else and carry on the way you
[1:16:13] do and then come say lord jesus or
[1:16:16] praise god hallelujah people say i see
[1:16:19] them speak in tongues that still don't
[1:16:21] mean that you've got the holy ghost i
[1:16:22] hear them shout that still don't mean
[1:16:24] the god of holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:16:26] is alive
[1:16:28] oh my
[1:16:30] this great purpose
[1:16:32] of the beauty of who it is
[1:16:35] the object
[1:16:36] the end
[1:16:37] of this what we are talking about
[1:16:40] tonight
[1:16:41] is to get us into the place where we can
[1:16:43] worship
[1:16:45] because that is what the exhortation
[1:16:47] worship the lord how
[1:16:50] in the beauty
[1:16:51] of holiness
[1:16:52] and then do they worship me
[1:16:55] why
[1:16:56] teaching for doctrine
[1:16:58] the commandments
[1:17:00] so i believe
[1:17:02] that the true word
[1:17:04] will bring true holiness
[1:17:06] the true word will bring true faith
[1:17:08] and that true faith
[1:17:10] will bring
[1:17:12] true worship
[1:17:13] it will bring the worship that jesus
[1:17:15] says
[1:17:16] woman the overcome
[1:17:18] and the father secretary you seek of
[1:17:20] them that worship the father in spirit
[1:17:22] and truth
[1:17:23] to worship god is not just a reason
[1:17:25] about talking about hallelujah and the
[1:17:27] heart not right and the mind right and
[1:17:29] the whole being not right no that's not
[1:17:31] what we're talking about
[1:17:33] he's talking about worship in the lord
[1:17:35] the beauty
[1:17:37] of holiness
[1:17:38] god wants us to be holy
[1:17:40] because he's holy
[1:17:42] i want you to seek the lord tonight
[1:17:45] to ask him to become a partaker of that
[1:17:47] holiness we find out we read in the
[1:17:49] scripture
[1:17:50] the chastening and testament trial
[1:17:52] is in order to effect and give us a
[1:17:55] taste
[1:17:56] that we can be a partaker of his home
[1:17:59] we can only understand his holiness as
[1:18:01] we get closer to him as we get into a
[1:18:04] relationship with him and we can see
[1:18:06] what he expects
[1:18:07] that's why you tell them those priests
[1:18:09] if you move that way you will die
[1:18:11] many men die of freedom and chance
[1:18:14] because they're not being what god said
[1:18:16] i wish i could have read more details
[1:18:19] and if you have time in exodus 28 of the
[1:18:21] garments and you take specific details
[1:18:25] and god actually put those there he said
[1:18:27] that garments of beauty and glory
[1:18:30] you know
[1:18:30] just as garments may look beautiful
[1:18:33] god want our inner garment
[1:18:36] that garment to be beautiful also and
[1:18:39] that beauty reflected in our
[1:18:41] consecration of a dedication
[1:18:44] of of a holiness to god
[1:18:46] at this time i want but anthony
[1:18:48] praise the lord
[1:18:50] to sing that song for me
[1:18:52] holiness

[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:36] oh
[1:21:45] heavenly father this has been to me
[1:21:48] an amazing thing to look at
[1:21:51] the beauty of holiness to worship you
[1:21:54] but i may this not just be a psalm that
[1:21:56] was read tonight
[1:21:58] but made ring in every soul and heart
[1:22:02] those i would hear it afterwards
[1:22:04] the beauty of holiness
[1:22:06] something that you can't purchase in a
[1:22:08] grocery
[1:22:09] you can shop for it in a pharmacy
[1:22:12] you can't get it
[1:22:13] and dig in a ground and mine it and it
[1:22:16] has to come from you
[1:22:18] holiness belong to you
[1:22:20] and yet
[1:22:22] you declared i am the high and lofty one
[1:22:26] that dwells with him
[1:22:28] that have a humble heart and a contrite
[1:22:30] spirit
[1:22:32] jesus
[1:22:33] when you see an earth
[1:22:35] you give reference
[1:22:36] to a clear example of the pharisee
[1:22:39] saying i am not like that sinner
[1:22:41] i do this i do that i do the other
[1:22:44] the sinner man couldn't even come inside
[1:22:46] the temple
[1:22:48] he stood out there and said lord i'm not
[1:22:50] worthy
[1:22:52] lord help me i'm a sinful man
[1:22:54] jesus was able to say that man went away
[1:22:57] more
[1:22:57] justified
[1:22:59] you dwell in humility
[1:23:02] you live in humility
[1:23:04] and usually when people get blessed they
[1:23:06] get puffed up
[1:23:08] they get arrogant
[1:23:10] and looking back over the years
[1:23:12] i see people boast
[1:23:14] and proud
[1:23:16] and
[1:23:17] and make all kind of boasting and to see
[1:23:19] they get cut down
[1:23:21] they got vulnerable they get old
[1:23:23] and they pass away
[1:23:25] father help us
[1:23:27] may we all recognize
[1:23:29] that truly life
[1:23:31] is a stage
[1:23:33] and we are like actors
[1:23:35] we come to perform
[1:23:37] we come to act we come to
[1:23:40] run our course
[1:23:42] and after a while we have to walk out of
[1:23:44] the stage
[1:23:45] one by one
[1:23:47] but i help your people tonight
[1:23:49] bless your calebs here
[1:23:51] strengthen them
[1:23:53] encourage them
[1:23:55] may they have a desire to be drawn
[1:23:57] closer to you
[1:23:59] your holiness
[1:24:00] i trust law that
[1:24:02] that intellectuals wouldn't be
[1:24:05] troubled by intellectuals who say we're
[1:24:07] talking about sanctification talking
[1:24:09] about john wesley
[1:24:10] pastor asia's pastor stage
[1:24:12] all that kind of intellectual
[1:24:14] gymnastics no we are not about that lord
[1:24:18] we're about what you call us unto father
[1:24:20] for if a man like john
[1:24:22] who walked with jesus in the flesh
[1:24:25] who fellowship with jesus who jesus
[1:24:27] loved and he was on the isle of patmos
[1:24:30] when
[1:24:30] jesus appeared to him in that glorious
[1:24:32] condition
[1:24:33] he fell as one dead
[1:24:35] it's a different realm altogether
[1:24:38] oh god help us tonight
[1:24:40] help us tonight it's not proper dancing
[1:24:42] it's getting into divine presence where
