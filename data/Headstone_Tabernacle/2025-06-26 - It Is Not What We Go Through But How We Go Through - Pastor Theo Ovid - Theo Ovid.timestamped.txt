[26:22] tonight?
[26:24] Amen. We're here to meet with the
[26:26] father. We're here to celebrate his
[26:28] name.
[26:30] We're here to be anointed by his
[26:33] presence tonight. We're just happy to
[26:34] have you here. And if you have your
[26:36] Bibles, we'd like to turn to a portion
[26:38] of um the Psalms. We're going to read
[26:41] Psalms chapter 91
[26:44] for our scripture reading. Amen.
[26:47] as we want to pray and commit to the
[26:50] service into the hands of the Lord and
[26:53] see what he would do for us tonight. Our
[26:55] faith is in him tonight. Amen.
[26:59] Psalms chapter 91 which reads,
[27:03] "He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[27:06] the most high shall abide under the
[27:09] shadow of the almighty.
[27:12] I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge
[27:16] and my fortress, my God, in him will I
[27:21] trust. Amen. Surely he shall deliver
[27:23] thee from the snare of the fowler, and
[27:26] from the noisome pestilence. He shall
[27:29] cover thee with his feathers, and under
[27:32] his wings shalt thou trust. His truth
[27:36] shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou
[27:39] shalt not be afraid for the terror by
[27:41] night, nor for the arrow that flyth by
[27:44] day, nor for the pestilence that walketh
[27:47] in darkness, nor for the destruction
[27:50] that wasteth at noonday. A thousand
[27:53] shall fall at thy side, and 10,000 at
[27:57] thy right hand, but it shall not come
[28:00] nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt
[28:03] thou behold and see the reward of the
[28:06] wicked because thou has made the Lord
[28:09] which is my refuge even the most high
[28:12] thy habitation. May God a blessing to
[28:15] the ring of his word. Let's bow our
[28:18] heads as we ask God's blessings tonight.
[28:20] Almighty God, Lord, we are thankful
[28:24] tonight, Father. Lord, for your grace
[28:26] and mercy, Lord, Father, upon our lives.
[28:29] We thank you for every mountain. We
[28:32] thank you for every valley tonight. It
[28:35] is your choosing, dear God, to bring us
[28:37] through many things, Lord, that you
[28:39] could try what you put in us, Lord.
[28:41] Father, Lord, that we can prove every
[28:43] one of those virtues, Lord. We are
[28:47] grateful to you tonight that you have
[28:49] called us Lord from out of the book as
[28:52] it were Lord to be manifested sons in
[28:54] the last days. Oh God, may you anoint us
[28:58] tonight as we gather around your word.
[29:00] As we gather in this place, Lord, as we
[29:03] gather in your presence, Father, we
[29:06] remember those who may not be able to
[29:07] make it tonight. We pray you bless them
[29:09] also and different ones might be hooked
[29:11] up online and listening to us in
[29:14] different places. We pray your spirit
[29:16] would be with them also tonight, Father,
[29:18] as we want to create a space for you
[29:21] here tonight, that your angels would
[29:23] move in, oh God, Father, and begin to
[29:25] minister with cos of fire upon the
[29:28] people tonight and you meet their
[29:30] expectation spiritually, Lord, with the
[29:33] August pain of your presence, Father.
[29:36] May you sweep in, Lord, and touch your
[29:38] people once more. Heal the sick, Lord.
[29:41] Fill with the Holy Ghost. may anoint and
[29:44] inspire tonight. Take a hold of your
[29:46] servant as he begins to yield himself
[29:48] before the altar of God. May almighty
[29:52] God come down and minister to us through
[29:54] him, Lord and use every facet of his
[29:57] being to be an instrument, Lord, Father,
[29:59] be a gospel tonight in this last day.
[30:02] Oh, how we need to hear the voice of God
[30:04] more than ever. Father, may we hear your
[30:06] voice tonight. For that is why we have
[30:09] come. We commit the service tonight into
[30:11] your hands. May I have your way and
[30:13] bless the people tonight in Jesus name.
[30:16] Amen and amen. Praise the name of the
[30:19] Lord. You love him tonight. Let's get a
[30:22] key for that song. Your grace and mercy
[30:25] brought me through. Amen. Amen. Why
[30:27] don't you lift your hand and sing? All
[30:29] grace and mercy
[30:36] brought
[30:38] me through.

[44:08] Let's bow our heads for pray. Heavenly
[44:09] Father, we thank you for your presence,
[44:12] Lord. where so much things taking place
[44:14] around the world and here we are
[44:16] gathered around this sacred scriptures
[44:19] this text of the Bible or that you have
[44:22] released and revealed by the prophet of
[44:23] Malachi 4 and we are resting on that
[44:27] Lord there's no way out there is no
[44:29] escape the judgments are set the arrow
[44:34] of judgment has already been loose on
[44:36] its bow it's on its way Lord this world
[44:38] is going to face a funeral service and
[44:42] the bride I going to be facing a wedding
[44:44] supper. So, Father, help us tonight as
[44:46] we come around your word. May you
[44:48] minister to us, meet our every need. We
[44:50] thank you for this service on Sunday.
[44:52] And Lord, as we walk, as you unfold more
[44:55] light, God, show us the steps to place
[44:58] our feet. We want to be guided by you.
[45:00] We want to be led by you. We want to
[45:02] have a sincere and open and honest heart
[45:04] before you that you could use us for
[45:06] your glory. That you could speak to us.
[45:08] That you could reveal yourself to us.
[45:10] that they can anoint us and inspire us.
[45:12] And I pray God that you take me out of
[45:14] the way tonight and inspire your word to
[45:16] your people in Jesus name I ask it. Amen
[45:19] and amen. God bless you. If you have
[45:21] your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to 2
[45:23] Corinthians chapter 4
[45:34] and we want to read from verse one.
[45:36] Therefore, seeing we have this ministry,
[45:39] as we have received mercy, we faint not,
[45:43] but have renounced the hidden things of
[45:45] dishonesty,
[45:46] not walking in craftiness, nor handling
[45:49] the word of God deceitfully, but by
[45:51] manifestation of the truth, commending
[45:55] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[45:57] the sight of God. But if our gospel be
[46:00] hid, it is hid to them that are lost.
[46:06] in whom the God of this world had
[46:08] blinded the minds of them which believe
[46:11] not least the light of the glorious
[46:14] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[46:17] should shine unto them. For we preach
[46:20] not ourselves but Jesus Christ the Lord
[46:23] and ourselves your servants for Jesus'
[46:26] sake. For God who commanded the light to
[46:28] shine out of darkness has shine in our
[46:31] hearts to give the light of the
[46:33] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[46:35] face of Jesus Christ. But we have this
[46:39] treasure in earthn vessels that the
[46:43] excellency of the power may be of God
[46:46] and not of us. We are troubled on every
[46:49] side yet not distressed. We are
[46:51] perplexed but not in despair. persecuted
[46:55] but not forsaken, cast down but not
[46:57] destroyed, always bearing about in the
[47:00] body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
[47:03] the life also of Jesus might be made
[47:05] manifest in our body. For we
[47:10] which live are always delivered unto
[47:13] death for Jesus' sake, that the life
[47:16] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[47:19] our mortal flesh. So then death workketh
[47:22] in us but life in you. May God bless his
[47:26] word. You may be seated. Oh, praise the
[47:28] Lord. Amen.
[47:30] And this is so powerful how Paul could
[47:33] say death workketh in us but life in
[47:37] you. So truly it will take a death dying
[47:42] out that life could come forth. We so
[47:45] blessed on Sunday walking through the
[47:47] fire and that that is just the word.
[47:51] Doesn't matter how we feel about it is
[47:53] just the word and some point in time we
[47:55] have to be confronted with ourselves as
[47:57] facing that very word. Okay. So have a
[48:01] title tonight. It is not what we go
[48:04] through but how we go through.
[48:08] It is not what we go through but how we
[48:12] go through. Now it can be said it's not
[48:15] how but what it's not how you feel but
[48:18] what you believe. But tonight we don't
[48:20] want to go in that way. How but what we
[48:23] want to go is not what we go through but
[48:26] how we go through it. Now Romans 12 says
[48:30] I beseech you therefore brethren by the
[48:32] mercies of God that you present your
[48:33] body living sacrifice. We went over this
[48:35] some time ago and being accounted to
[48:37] this world. I just want to skip it
[48:38] through. and be transformed by renew
[48:41] renewing of your mind. So this message
[48:44] will tie into Sunday message tie into
[48:47] the travail we have been speak for a
[48:49] while the laboring talking about this
[48:50] trying to all of that. So after Paul
[48:54] expressed about this renewing of your
[48:57] mind, he went on to talk about the grace
[49:00] given that that you're not supposed to
[49:03] think more highly, but to think soberly.
[49:07] And and and everybody have a right to
[49:09] think whatever they want to think. They
[49:10] could think they're Superman. They they
[49:12] think whoever it is, there's an angel.
[49:14] They could think whatever they want to
[49:15] think. But the Bible say think soberly.
[49:17] In other words, show up yourself. Hit
[49:19] slap slap sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl
[49:20] sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl
[49:20] sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl sl
[49:20] sl sl sl slap your face and recognize
[49:22] that that you in this place and this
[49:24] world here you have to deal with things
[49:26] you have to deal with issues you have to
[49:28] face your situation it's not a whole
[49:29] spiritual thing that people on a kind of
[49:31] spiritual height that that tripping them
[49:34] he said now then he went and talk about
[49:35] the body of Christ many members one body
[49:39] not having the same office of course
[49:41] being many one body in Christ and
[49:43] everyone members one of another having
[49:46] gifts and he went on and and ministry
[49:48] let us wait our ministry ing and
[49:49] exhaltation and so like that. But this
[49:51] is the part I want to get to in verse 9.
[49:53] It says less love be without
[49:56] dissimilation. So he's talking about
[49:58] love but he's talking about how that
[50:00] love must be expressed or unfolded. He
[50:03] said let love be without dissimilation.
[50:06] In other words, let it be with
[50:07] sincerity. Let it be a genuine love.
[50:10] Abhore that which is evil. Cleave to
[50:12] that which is good. Then he said these
[50:14] words, be kindly affection one to
[50:17] another. Now there's a reason why he
[50:19] would emphasize that about being kindly
[50:22] affectionate because you could be cold
[50:23] with somebody or you could be formal
[50:25] with somebody. He said don't be formal.
[50:27] Don't be cold. Don't be just you know
[50:30] just any anyhow but be kindly affect. So
[50:34] he's appealing to the quality of spirit
[50:37] how we supposed to be to one another.
[50:40] Isn't that right? To kind to so be
[50:43] kindly affection to one to another with
[50:45] brotherly love in honor prefering one
[50:47] another. Not slutful in business like a
[50:50] slacker then, but fervent in spirit. And
[50:53] that fervent means passionate, not dull
[50:56] or passive. So God want us a certain
[50:58] way. Again, is not what, is how. How to
[51:02] be in business. Isn't that right? Not to
[51:05] be dull, not to be passive, but to be
[51:08] passionate serving the Lord. Amen. When
[51:11] the saints rejoicing in hope, patient in
[51:13] tribulation, continuing instant in
[51:15] prayer, distributing to the necessity of
[51:18] the saints, given to hospitality, bless
[51:20] them and persecute you, rejoice with
[51:22] them to do rejoice, weep with them that
[51:24] weep. All these are areas of compassion
[51:27] and mercy and open on your bowels. It's
[51:29] not just ignore people, but weep with
[51:31] them who weep. Rejoice with them who
[51:32] rejoice. And they said, "Be of the same
[51:34] mind one towards another." We can't go
[51:37] and wait for the other side to be like
[51:39] that. These things have to be exercised
[51:41] here. These things have to be displayed
[51:44] here. Be of the same mind once to one
[51:47] another. Mind not high things, but
[51:49] condescend to men of low estate. So you
[51:52] can walk aloft. Hallelujah. You can act
[51:54] aloof. You can act like if you're above
[51:56] somebody, you're above that. You're high
[51:58] and mighty. Somebody that that makes no
[52:00] sense because your dress more expensive
[52:02] than somebody else has own or your tie
[52:04] more expensive. That is foolishness. Be
[52:06] of the same mind one to another. Mind
[52:08] not high things, but condescend to men
[52:11] of low estate. And there's a whole
[52:13] message here after that. Be not wise in
[52:15] your own conceit. Recompense no man evil
[52:18] for evil. Provide things honest in the
[52:22] sight of all men. If it as possible, as
[52:25] much light light in you, live peaceibly
[52:27] with all men. So you can't be a
[52:29] wararmonger. You can't be looking for
[52:31] bakana, looking for confusion, looking
[52:33] at the nearest thing to fight. As much
[52:35] as light within you, not with the other
[52:38] party. You know, in other words, you
[52:39] have to be peaceful. You have to want
[52:42] peace. You can't say when they be
[52:43] peaceful, then you will get peace. As
[52:45] much as light in you, you you you are
[52:49] the person God talking to. It has to lie
[52:51] in you. Isn't that right? Live peaceibly
[52:54] with all men. Not some men. Not with
[52:58] brethren only. All men with your
[53:00] neighbor too. which is Jehovah witness
[53:02] knocking on your door at a cuckoo hour.
[53:05] Live peaceibly with all men. Dearly
[53:09] believer, the daily beloved, avenge not
[53:11] yourselves, but rather give place unto
[53:14] wrath. Amen. For it is written.
[53:17] Hallelujah. Vengeance is mine. I will
[53:20] repay, say the Lord. So, you have to
[53:22] commit things in the hands of God. Don't
[53:24] look for You're looking for vengeance.
[53:26] You're looking for this. You wish this
[53:27] happened to somebody. No, that's
[53:29] foolishness. They're not even
[53:30] Christianity. Isn't that right? Lick
[53:33] lick the depth of it in verse 20.
[53:35] Therefore, if thy enemy hunger, feed
[53:37] him.
[53:38] Not go and say hungry wicked man. You
[53:42] know what the Bible say? You know for
[53:44] you to expose his wickedness and how bad
[53:46] he is. That why he hungry to you say
[53:48] reap for your show.
[53:52] That was the time in scripture for that.
[53:53] You know if he hungry and say hungry
[53:56] Bible say feed him. Amen.
[54:01] If he thirst, give him drink. For in so
[54:04] doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on
[54:07] his head. Don't Don't And be not
[54:10] overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
[54:13] good.
[54:16] That's the only way overcoming evil. Not
[54:18] evil for evil. No, not I for eye. You
[54:22] overcome evil with good. All right,
[54:24] let's go.
[54:27] Ah Lord help me tonight. It's not what
[54:29] is the how.
[54:32] Bible talk about people giving. Right?
[54:34] Second Corinthians 9:7 says every man
[54:36] according as he purpose in his heart so
[54:38] let him give not grudgingly
[54:43] or of necessity. For God loveth a
[54:46] cheerful giver. Watch this in the
[54:48] amplified. Let each one give as he has
[54:51] made up his own mind and purpose in his
[54:54] heart, not reluctantly or sorrowfully or
[54:58] under compulsion. For God loves, he
[55:01] takes pleasure in. He prizes above other
[55:03] things and is unwilling to abandon or to
[55:06] do without a cheerful, joyous, prompt to
[55:08] do it giver whose heart is in his
[55:10] giving. Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of
[55:13] the Lord. So cheerfulness and
[55:15] willingness matter.
[55:18] Not you give a fr in the face of God I
[55:19] had to give that I ain't want to give it
[55:20] no but what god the church tell me and
[55:22] who who tell you and who tell you and
[55:23] they taking a pledge and I
[55:30] Jesus this is Jesus now this Paul
[55:34] said this in 2 Corinthians 9 but here is
[55:36] Jesus in Matthew 6 and Jesus is speaking
[55:40] now he said take heed
[55:42] that you do not your arms before men
[55:45] that is charity charity
[55:47] to be seen of them. Not what you do. You
[55:50] want to give, you want to be charitable.
[55:52] He's explaining how to do it.
[55:56] Otherwise, you have no reward of your
[55:57] father which in heaven. Therefore, when
[56:00] thou doest thine arms, oh, now this is
[56:03] not the this not the whole thing here.
[56:04] You know, we getting to something.
[56:06] There's the platform or the backdrop to
[56:08] get where we want to go. Therefore, when
[56:10] thou doest thine arms, do not sh a
[56:12] trumpet before thee. And we say when
[56:14] people giving when these big this
[56:15] company giving a a check for somebody
[56:17] they ap big big picture they check a big
[56:21] whole thing $7,000 you see the big thing
[56:24] this company giving a check and we see
[56:26] the whole check and that making
[56:27] newspapers all right so they they want
[56:29] to get some recognition for that he said
[56:31] watch now when thou doest thine arms do
[56:33] not sung a trumpet before thee as the
[56:35] hypocrites do in the synagogue and in
[56:38] the streets that they may get the glory
[56:39] of men very I say unto you they have
[56:41] their reward but when do his arms, let
[56:44] not thy left hand know what thy right
[56:47] hand doeth.
[56:50] Hallelujah. Because you know what has
[56:52] happened? Sometimes the left hand might
[56:54] like what you're doing. You know, so
[56:56] left hand tell the right hand don't do
[56:57] that. You know sometimes I watch that
[57:00] left hand and right hand you know I
[57:02] would say husband and wife left hand
[57:03] right hand. That's how he said don't let
[57:06] your left hand no appreciate the word.
[57:10] Don't let the left hand know what thy
[57:11] right hand doeth that thine arms may be
[57:14] in secret and thy father which seat in
[57:17] secret himself shall reward thee openly.
[57:20] Now Jesus bring it natural arms and what
[57:22] then he's going to go down deep now when
[57:25] thou prayest. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[57:27] I feel an anointing upon that. When thou
[57:30] prayest. Hallelujah. Thou shalt not be
[57:34] as the hypocrites are, for they love to
[57:36] pray standing in the synagogues in the
[57:38] corners of the street, that they may be
[57:40] seen of men. Very unto you, they have
[57:42] their reward. But thou, when thou
[57:44] prayest, there's the third pull closet.
[57:46] Now this we heading to the third pull.
[57:47] I'll meet you in there. That's the third
[57:49] pull. That light going in a little room.
[57:52] He said, when your prayers, Hallelujah,
[57:54] enter in that thy closet. And when thou
[57:57] shut thy door, pray to thy father which
[58:01] is in secret. And thy father which seed
[58:04] in secret shall reward thee openly. Oh
[58:06] give the Lord a shout tonight. It's not
[58:09] what we do. It's how we do it. It's not
[58:11] what Amen. And Jesus throwing another
[58:14] girl. We're not going to read the whole
[58:15] thing. He said when you pray how now
[58:17] don't use vain repetition as hidden. Do
[58:20] don't waste your time with that. For
[58:21] they think that they shall be heard with
[58:23] them much speaking. Be not like unto
[58:26] them. For your father knoweth what
[58:28] things you have need of before you even
[58:29] ask him after this manner the how shall
[58:33] you pray. Our father which art in
[58:35] heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Get the
[58:37] Lord some praises. Oh glory to God. So
[58:40] he was only talking the what he was
[58:42] showing the how. Oh give the Lord some
[58:44] praises. Hallelujah.
[58:50] Thank you. Colossians 3:23. And
[58:52] whatsoever you do, glory, do it heartily
[58:54] as unto the Lord, not unto men. That in
[58:58] the amplify, whatever may be your task,
[59:00] work it heartily from the soul as
[59:03] something done for the Lord, not unto
[59:05] men. So, could you imagine you doing a
[59:07] normal task and God looking at your
[59:09] heart, God looking at how you're doing,
[59:11] God looking at the diligence or your
[59:13] slacker because you think you working
[59:15] for a man, but God seeing your heart.
[59:18] See the difference now? It doesn't
[59:19] matter what job you're doing. is what
[59:21] God see how you doing it. He said do it
[59:23] as unto the Lord. That's what Joseph
[59:25] did. He was another country. He had to
[59:28] learn their tongue. But he did his very
[59:30] best and his best give him promotion.
[59:33] Not demotion promotion. Oh, give the
[59:35] Lord a praise because he did it from his
[59:38] heart. He did the best that he could do.
[59:40] And everybody knew he was diligent. He
[59:42] was applying himself. Oh, he was a
[59:44] quality guy. So whatever you're doing
[59:47] the task God want you do with your whole
[59:49] heart. Isn't that right? And if you
[59:52] think that is games or we just throwing
[59:54] words let Philippians answer that for
[59:56] you from verse chapter 2 verse 14 and
[59:58] 15. Do all things without murmurings and
[1:00:02] disputions.
[1:00:05] Hallelujah. purpose that you may be
[1:00:07] blameless
[1:00:09] and harmless, the sons of God without
[1:00:12] rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
[1:00:15] perverse nation among whom he'll shine
[1:00:18] as the light of the world. But talk
[1:00:20] about that slave from Africa. He's
[1:00:22] brought to America.
[1:00:23] And when the buyers come to buy slaves
[1:00:26] because they used to buy slaves against
[1:00:27] his property like horse, cattle, coke,
[1:00:29] pig, whatever. They start to spy and
[1:00:32] look around and suddenly somebody eye
[1:00:33] drop on that man. And that master said,
[1:00:36] "Not for sale. Not for sale." Everybody
[1:00:41] spiff
[1:00:42] different. He's shining different. His
[1:00:45] shoulder is not bowed. His throat back.
[1:00:47] Hallelujah. a certain air about him.
[1:00:50] They say questions are the question.
[1:00:52] Does he sleep different from the rest of
[1:00:53] them? Because he looking like the rest
[1:00:55] of them. Do you get that? He not looking
[1:00:58] like the rest of them. The vibes he's
[1:01:01] giving out is not like the rest of them.
[1:01:02] Does he eat the different? He say food.
[1:01:05] Does he sleep different? Same bed.
[1:01:06] Hallelujah. Same kind of roof. Same kind
[1:01:09] of testing. Same kind of field to work.
[1:01:12] What is the difference about that guy?
[1:01:14] We wanted to find ourselves. And we
[1:01:16] found out that way back in Africa, his
[1:01:19] father is the king of the child. And
[1:01:22] even though he's not in Africa, even
[1:01:24] though he's a foreign land, he walks
[1:01:26] like one. He talks like one. He lives
[1:01:28] like one. He acts like one. Oh, give the
[1:01:31] Lord some praises. And we from foreign.
[1:01:34] We This world is not our world. Let me
[1:01:37] say it again. We from foreign. I want to
[1:01:39] say that way. We not from. That's what
[1:01:41] Abraham was walking. He was seeking a
[1:01:43] city whose maker and builder is God.
[1:01:46] Abraham knew this world was not his own.
[1:01:48] Oh, give the Lord a shout. There have to
[1:01:50] be a city somewhere. Oh, glory to God. I
[1:01:52] saw a new city coming down from God.
[1:01:56] They have to have a place for these
[1:01:57] sons. Oh, give the Lord a shout. And
[1:02:00] that is why we are here on the earth to
[1:02:03] reflect and represent God.
[1:02:06] Hallelujah.
[1:02:07] This same scripture, Philippians 2:14:15
[1:02:11] amplified said, "Do all things without
[1:02:12] grumbling
[1:02:14] and falsifying
[1:02:16] and complaining
[1:02:19] against God and questioning and doubting
[1:02:22] among yourselves." Hallelujah. that you
[1:02:24] may show yourselves to be blameless,
[1:02:27] guyless, innocent,
[1:02:30] uncontaminated
[1:02:32] children of God, without blemish,
[1:02:35] faultless, unrebukeable. That kind of
[1:02:38] life, that kind of operation is
[1:02:40] unreable. People can't rebuke that
[1:02:44] because it speaks for itself. Amen.
[1:02:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:48] Unrebukeable in the midst of a crooked
[1:02:50] and wicked generation, spiritually
[1:02:53] perverted and perverse among whom you
[1:02:55] are seen as bright lights, stars or
[1:02:59] beacons shine all clearly in this dark
[1:03:01] world. And then the Bible talk about how
[1:03:04] to restore someone.
[1:03:06] Galatians 6:1. Brethren, if a man is
[1:03:09] overtaken in a fault, you which are
[1:03:11] spiritual, listen to these words.
[1:03:13] Restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:03:16] weakness. This is the how part.
[1:03:22] This is the how part. In other words, it
[1:03:24] say go and trample and rebuke and carry
[1:03:27] on and and expose. No. Watch. Restore
[1:03:31] such a one. How? How? In the spirit of
[1:03:33] meekness.
[1:03:35] This is deep. Considering thyself,
[1:03:38] least thou also be tempted. In other
[1:03:42] words, he's saying when you talk to that
[1:03:43] person, see yourself.
[1:03:46] Consider that could be you.
[1:03:49] Because if you was in that position, you
[1:03:51] don't even know what you will do. And
[1:03:52] that's why we could criticize, we could
[1:03:55] talk about people, but we have not put
[1:03:57] on their shoes. We don't know what stone
[1:03:59] is inside of there. We don't know what's
[1:04:00] sticking in their inside of there. You
[1:04:02] don't know what they're going through,
[1:04:03] but you open your mouth and you loosen
[1:04:05] what you want to see. Oh, give the Lord
[1:04:08] some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:04:12] You wasn't looking for this tonight,
[1:04:13] right?
[1:04:16] Ah, God help me.
[1:04:19] I know wasn't looking for this. So,
[1:04:21] we're in the same boat. All right. So in
[1:04:23] go so the amplified it said brethren if
[1:04:26] any person is overtaken in misconduct or
[1:04:30] sin of any sort you who are spiritual
[1:04:34] who are responsive to and controlled by
[1:04:37] the spirit should set him right and
[1:04:40] restore and reinstate him without any
[1:04:44] sense of superiority
[1:04:47] and with all gentleness.
[1:04:50] Keeping an attentive eye on yourself
[1:04:54] least you should be tempted also.
[1:04:57] I remember brother telling me I would
[1:04:58] never ask light.
[1:05:00] So I kept very quiet. I was silent. I
[1:05:04] seven seat break. I was silent. He said
[1:05:07] but you will say that. I said not at
[1:05:09] all. I said I can't say that.
[1:05:13] I say I'm in his hands. If he move his
[1:05:16] hands I fall down the ground I fall.
[1:05:18] Amen. So I cannot talk that kind of
[1:05:20] talk. I will never backside that
[1:05:22] backside that that flipping in backside
[1:05:24] right now. He will never flipping over.
[1:05:30] It's not what we go through. So when you
[1:05:33] catch the how part it eliminates the
[1:05:37] complaining. It eliminates your issues
[1:05:39] of excuses. It's eliminate that because
[1:05:42] there's another eye watching you. How
[1:05:45] you're going through what you're going
[1:05:47] through. How to speak the truth?
[1:05:50] Ephesians 4:15. One we know speaking the
[1:05:52] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:05:55] all things which is the head even the
[1:05:56] Christ. Not speaking lovely truth. Some
[1:05:59] people could speak the truth realize you
[1:06:00] know they speaking the truth lovely. But
[1:06:03] that's not what the Bible says. Speak
[1:06:05] the truth how how to deliver the truth.
[1:06:08] I had to tell um what you say um how you
[1:06:11] say boy but um I speak in my mind um
[1:06:15] telling like it is
[1:06:18] if you will receive it
[1:06:22] speak the truth in love all right let's
[1:06:25] go that's the scriptural background and
[1:06:27] let's go brother Brandon he said now
[1:06:31] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:06:34] and confesses to profess and he was
[1:06:37] wounded for our transgression with his
[1:06:38] stripes you are healed. So he's a high
[1:06:40] priest to make intercession upon our
[1:06:42] confession. And he kind of do nothing
[1:06:44] for us until we first accept it and
[1:06:47] confess it. Now we could get down to the
[1:06:49] altar. Here we go. And pray till we laid
[1:06:53] our faces and died.
[1:06:56] Until we believe and accept his
[1:06:59] pardoning grace, we are still lost.
[1:07:03] So I trying to cut to the chase and
[1:07:04] trying to show you don't waste your
[1:07:05] time.
[1:07:07] Let's start to see what God say. Walk in
[1:07:09] that and you'll be fine. Watch this now.
[1:07:13] No matter how loud we could scream
[1:07:18] or how long we could stay or how much we
[1:07:21] could go without food until in our heart
[1:07:25] the revelation God gives us that Jesus
[1:07:29] Christ died to save us and we accept it
[1:07:31] as our own personal property. Amen.
[1:07:34] You're going to church. Amen. This is
[1:07:36] the problem. People going to church and
[1:07:39] that I will call is a religious spirit.
[1:07:42] You want to stay home, you're going to
[1:07:43] church. I'm not talking about you here,
[1:07:44] you know. I hope there's not anybody
[1:07:46] here now. All right. So then when you
[1:07:49] accept it now as your personal property
[1:07:52] that you are responsible for that
[1:07:57] if you're renting
[1:07:59] on some land is not yours, you you know
[1:08:02] you could let things go. You could let
[1:08:04] the grass grow up. to let the horse fall
[1:08:06] down. It's not yours. But when it
[1:08:08] becomes your property,
[1:08:10] then you have to clean it, maintain it.
[1:08:13] You see, if you don't see this message
[1:08:16] as your property, if you don't see these
[1:08:18] promises as your property,
[1:08:23] yeah, take it serious because it's not
[1:08:25] really yours. But when it's yours, you
[1:08:27] fight for it. You wrestle for it. You
[1:08:30] press because it is yours. This kingdom
[1:08:34] is yours. This land is yours. Every
[1:08:37] place you put your foot, that's yours.
[1:08:38] Or give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:08:44] So you will be concerned about your
[1:08:47] attitude. Listen, listen. It have sons
[1:08:50] and sons. It have sons who faithful.
[1:08:54] I'm not talking about spiritual. I'm
[1:08:55] talking about natural family. They
[1:08:57] always have I forget the name. Let's
[1:08:59] call it somebody who always look stray
[1:09:01] strayish and things like that. But you
[1:09:03] have five sons, six sons or whatever it
[1:09:04] is. And this one is diligent, that one
[1:09:06] is diligent. And always among that have
[1:09:08] a slacker as somebody who always holding
[1:09:09] back and what that and always always a
[1:09:12] joker, a comedian, some kind of
[1:09:14] character have there. But they will
[1:09:16] always be a son. They can't cancel that.
[1:09:20] They are son. But what will they
[1:09:22] inherit? When the father is looking at
[1:09:25] their behavior or looking at their
[1:09:27] attitude. Oh, give the lord some
[1:09:29] praises. So what I'm saying then it has
[1:09:31] to come to a place where these promises
[1:09:33] become yours that you could it's mine he
[1:09:36] talking about. So you not looking what
[1:09:37] this brother doing this one is saying
[1:09:39] amen. This one hand it like a paralyzed
[1:09:41] like the devil have the hand in
[1:09:42] concrete. The hand can't raise up at
[1:09:44] all. You not bother with that. You know
[1:09:46] that is their hand and not your hand.
[1:09:48] You hearing what you you seen your name
[1:09:50] on the book. You hearing your promises.
[1:09:52] You see the lamb took the book. You see
[1:09:54] the beast say amen. Elders shouting and
[1:09:57] praising. You want to join the heavenly
[1:10:00] chorus.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] When it become yours, you can stand
[1:10:11] anywhere. Anytime under any condition,
[1:10:14] you will stand. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] You would stand. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:10:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:10:26] God. If the devil can tire all the years
[1:10:28] how you can tie up now it too late. This
[1:10:32] thing don't
[1:10:33] this thing don't melt like it blend. You
[1:10:36] can't unblend that. We blending with the
[1:10:38] word. We blending with the spirit. We
[1:10:40] blending with the promises. We blended
[1:10:43] with God. He said wait till them seven
[1:10:45] thunders utter their voices to that
[1:10:48] group who could take the word and hand
[1:10:49] it there. They were slice and cut. They
[1:10:51] could shut the heavens. They could open
[1:10:53] up the heavens. They could do whatever
[1:10:55] they want to do. They are blended in
[1:10:57] with the word.
[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:04] It's not what we do. It's how we do it.
[1:11:10] If something Christ died did for me, did
[1:11:12] for you. And to whosoever will believe
[1:11:14] it, then you are saved because you have
[1:11:15] believed it and you're healed the same
[1:11:17] way. Many times people say, "I'd like to
[1:11:19] feel if I'm healed." Jesus never say,
[1:11:22] "Did you feel it?" He said, "Did you
[1:11:24] believe it? Amen. That's it. Do you
[1:11:26] believe it? Feeling has nothing to do
[1:11:29] with it. That what people didn't get
[1:11:32] over yet. They're still in their fleshly
[1:11:34] feeling. Feeling has nothing to do with
[1:11:37] it. It's your faith. Somebody say amen,
[1:11:41] somebody. If I did it the way I felt, if
[1:11:45] I did it the way I felt, I'd be in bad
[1:11:47] shape lots of times. Is that right,
[1:11:49] Bron? I guess we all would. But it's not
[1:11:51] how I feel. is what I believe that he
[1:11:54] has done. Not my feelings, it's my faith
[1:12:00] in what a finished work at Calvary.
[1:12:05] So to God,
[1:12:08] what we go through,
[1:12:11] how we go through rather is more
[1:12:13] important than what we go through. Amen.
[1:12:17] If you look at Joseph a little bit, that
[1:12:20] was piece of hell for a young man, you
[1:12:22] know,
[1:12:24] is not the enemy sold him and his
[1:12:26] brothers, you know, his brothers in his
[1:12:28] father's house sold him.
[1:12:31] Let them take him away. They take the
[1:12:34] visionary going to be dead. The prophecy
[1:12:36] go be dead. All them revelation going to
[1:12:38] be dead. That what they thinking. They
[1:12:40] don't even know. They are pushing that
[1:12:43] young man into his destiny. Hallelujah.
[1:12:48] And his destiny is a part of suffering,
[1:12:51] strain, and pain. Oh, glory to God.
[1:12:54] Hallelujah. The only way Pharaoh could f
[1:12:58] send for Joseph, he had to be in prison.
[1:13:00] The only way he could send for Joseph
[1:13:03] because famine was coming. The only way
[1:13:05] he could send for Joseph because a
[1:13:07] vision was coming, a dream was coming
[1:13:09] that he can't explain. And he need a man
[1:13:12] to get that dream. What can the Lord a
[1:13:14] shout? You talk about one in a million.
[1:13:16] Job had to go to Bifford's house. But
[1:13:19] your wife has to tackle him. He had to
[1:13:21] run away. He had to be in prison. He had
[1:13:23] to walk that that that that road of fire
[1:13:28] to get him where God wanted him. And I
[1:13:31] will tell you, God going to set fire on
[1:13:32] your trail. Oh, glory to God. God set
[1:13:35] trials on your trail. God going to set
[1:13:37] testing in your trail to get you in the
[1:13:39] position to place you positionally to
[1:13:42] what God want you to be, where God want
[1:13:45] you to be, how God want you to be.
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:14:01] Let me see it.
[1:14:04] It definitely wasn't easy for Abraham.
[1:14:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because see,
[1:14:09] when you have faith, you have to speak
[1:14:10] it to him. I believe, therefore, I
[1:14:12] speak. It wasn't a private show, you
[1:14:14] know. Well, you know, I'm a private man.
[1:14:17] You know, I I want everybody to know
[1:14:20] Isaac coming just in case he ain't come.
[1:14:22] No, he had no revelation. If he told he
[1:14:23] had no revision whatsoever. The fact
[1:14:25] that he could speak and go and visit his
[1:14:27] doctor. The fact that he could testify
[1:14:30] because he believed God. This man met
[1:14:32] God. You know when he challenge God what
[1:14:34] you going to give me see I go challenge
[1:14:36] God say come the stars so shall I see it
[1:14:38] be. And the Bible said Abraham believed
[1:14:40] God. And that faith was counted as
[1:14:43] righteousness.
[1:14:45] God switch it and say you see what that
[1:14:46] man believe there righteous is over
[1:14:48] here. Righteous Abraham. the faith of
[1:14:51] Abraham. And that faith is what the
[1:14:53] early disciples had. That's the original
[1:14:56] faith. Oh, give the Lord a shout. That
[1:14:59] faith started in Genesis. We going to
[1:15:01] finish it in Revelation. Oh, that's the
[1:15:03] original faith. That faith has been
[1:15:05] restored by the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:15:07] Oh, give the Lord a shout. We are
[1:15:09] connecting to a restored faith. Oh,
[1:15:12] glory to God. We are not restoring the
[1:15:14] faith. The faith has already been
[1:15:16] restored. and William Marian Branham was
[1:15:19] evidence of the restored faith. Oh, give
[1:15:22] the Lord some praises tonight. This
[1:15:24] message is not dead. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:15:26] Hallelujah. This word is not dead. It's
[1:15:29] alive and kicking tonight.
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:38] The testimony of Abraham.
[1:15:41] He staggered not at the promise of God.
[1:15:45] Hallelujah.
[1:15:46] true unbelief but was strong in faith.
[1:15:50] Giving glory to God. What did he do?
[1:15:52] Giving glory to God. It was evidence of
[1:15:55] the strength of his faith. His faith
[1:15:57] means thank you Lord for him now. Thank
[1:15:59] you Lord. He is coming. Thank you Lord.
[1:16:01] He is here. I could feel him in my
[1:16:03] hands. I feel him in my feet. I feel him
[1:16:06] all over me. God's not dead. He's still
[1:16:09] alive. Abraham wasn't feeling nothing.
[1:16:12] But he believed God. Isaac was coming.
[1:16:14] Is that was a revelation inside that man
[1:16:17] heart and seven thunders is a revelation
[1:16:19] in the heart of the bride. The give of
[1:16:21] faith to show how to prepare. It's the
[1:16:24] bride revival. Oh, glory to God. I don't
[1:16:26] care what the message will say about it.
[1:16:28] It's coming. It's coming. It's coming.
[1:16:30] There have been no manifestation of God
[1:16:32] to stir the bride. He will send it. He
[1:16:35] promise it. He will send it. He promise
[1:16:38] it. Oh, glory to God. And if you take
[1:16:41] that as your personal property, you know
[1:16:43] God is not a man that would lie. God
[1:16:45] can't promise nothing he can't do. Oh,
[1:16:47] glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:10] America drop bomb
[1:17:14] and they arguing whether it's totally
[1:17:15] obliterated or halfway or damaged.
[1:17:18] Nobody go and check and see. You know,
[1:17:20] nobody go down there, you know. So I'm
[1:17:22] saying this, some saying that. God not
[1:17:23] in that foolishness. You see when God
[1:17:25] dumped something, it done you know. I've
[1:17:27] heard the cries of my people. I come
[1:17:30] down. He he has bring no ambiguity. You
[1:17:33] know could it be what if it is? Could it
[1:17:35] be bombed? Obliterated. No. No, God not
[1:17:37] in that. No, he deliver He deliver. By
[1:17:41] myself have I sworn in blessing I will
[1:17:43] bless thee. God can't lie no in multiply
[1:17:46] and multiply thee. God can't lie no and
[1:17:49] thy seed shall possess the Gal me. He's
[1:17:52] not talking about the Jews. He's talking
[1:17:53] about the faith of Abraham. That's the
[1:17:55] seed of God. That's the seed of Christ.
[1:17:58] You have that faith tonight.
[1:18:03] All right, let's go.
[1:18:06] doing good tonight.
[1:18:08] Revelation two.
[1:18:10] I know thy works, thy labor, thy
[1:18:12] patience. How thou canst not bear them
[1:18:15] which are evil, and I try them which say
[1:18:17] the apostles and are not. Found them
[1:18:19] liars.
[1:18:23] How you say that differently?
[1:18:27] You don't say liars, you say
[1:18:30] foreign to the truth or something. So
[1:18:31] same same liars. God say, "I found them
[1:18:34] to be liars and has borne and has
[1:18:38] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:18:40] labored and has not fainted."
[1:18:44] How beautifully the Savior praises and
[1:18:46] commends his children.
[1:18:48] He takes full account of their fine
[1:18:51] spiritual attitudes and behavior.
[1:18:54] He knows that there's weakness among
[1:18:56] them, but as yet he does not cry against
[1:18:58] it. Isn't that just like our Lord? He
[1:19:02] knows how to encourage us in the right
[1:19:04] matters and discourage us in the wrong
[1:19:06] matters. We could all learn a good
[1:19:09] lesson there in running the church and
[1:19:11] our families. And better still, we could
[1:19:13] all learn a good lesson in that God
[1:19:16] deals with each one of us in exactly
[1:19:18] this way. Don't ever be discouraged,
[1:19:22] saint of God. For God is not ungracious
[1:19:25] to forget your labors of love.
[1:19:27] Whatever we do, giving a cup of cold
[1:19:30] water to someone has the reward and
[1:19:33] blessing from the Lord. I know thy
[1:19:35] works, thy labor, and thy patience.
[1:19:37] Hallelujah. Here we go. As he walks in
[1:19:40] the midst of his church, he is aware of
[1:19:43] the suffering of his people. And he
[1:19:46] cares.
[1:19:49] You see, the devil will want to make you
[1:19:51] think he don't care. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:56] As it was in the days of captivity in
[1:19:57] Egypt, God when he heard their cries, he
[1:20:00] who never changes still hears the cries
[1:20:04] of the oppressed as he walks among them.
[1:20:07] It's not he not among them anymore. He's
[1:20:09] walking among them, hearing their cries.
[1:20:12] He who never changes still hear the
[1:20:15] cries of the oppressed as he walks among
[1:20:18] them. The oh my. Shall not the Lord
[1:20:22] avenge his elect who cry day and night
[1:20:27] unto him. He hearing them crying day and
[1:20:31] night. Not there alone in the night
[1:20:33] time. He hear your nighttime cries. He
[1:20:35] hear your daytime cry day and night.
[1:20:38] Hallelujah. Shall not God avenge his
[1:20:41] elect that cries day and night unto him?
[1:20:44] Don't be afraid to cry. Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:20:51] The very word labor signifies a
[1:20:54] weariness through oppression.
[1:20:57] God's people do not only work for him in
[1:21:00] a labor of love. But they suffer for
[1:21:03] him. With joy. How? With joy. How? With
[1:21:08] joy. They just suffer with him. Oh god,
[1:21:09] I'm suffering. Oh God, I can't take
[1:21:11] another one of this Christianity thing.
[1:21:14] This message thing. Oh God, stress.
[1:21:23] Don't say amen now. Is the word here?
[1:21:27] They are patient in bearing the yoke.
[1:21:30] The first age suffered great
[1:21:32] persecution. It had to work hard to
[1:21:34] preach the gospel and shed forth truth.
[1:21:37] Their high calling in life was to serve
[1:21:39] God. And when their hopes in life were
[1:21:41] blighted, they were patient and
[1:21:44] committed all to him who had promised a
[1:21:47] lasting recompense in heaven for what
[1:21:49] they had given up on him on earth. What
[1:21:51] had given up for him on earth. I think
[1:21:53] we ought to stop here and deal the
[1:21:55] thought that God's people has always
[1:21:59] been and always will be persecuted.
[1:22:02] And brother had talked about Daniel and
[1:22:05] Shadrach, mission, and Abednego. All
[1:22:06] these guys were public servants and
[1:22:08] working for the government and nice and
[1:22:09] things. They're coming for you.
[1:22:12] Other words, your nice behavior in the
[1:22:13] government and and working and thing
[1:22:15] like that, they coming for you still.
[1:22:17] Because why? It's the spirit upon you
[1:22:19] and the devil upon them.
[1:22:21] Hear how he brings it out here now.
[1:22:24] Hallelujah. The thought that God's
[1:22:26] people Yes. have always been and always
[1:22:29] will be persecuted. Genesis, Cain
[1:22:31] persecuted and killed Abel because the
[1:22:34] latter pleased God. Yes. Abraham, son of
[1:22:36] the flesh, Ishmael, who teased and
[1:22:38] fought the son of promised Isaac. Esau
[1:22:41] hated Jacob.
[1:22:44] Oh, this is all right.
[1:22:50] Esau hated Jacob would have killed him
[1:22:52] had not God interveneed. New Testament
[1:22:54] find Judas betraying Jesus. Amen. The
[1:22:57] children of this world, here we go,
[1:22:59] controlled by the devil
[1:23:01] hate the children of God who are
[1:23:04] controlled by the spirit. So this is a
[1:23:07] big battle going on. Hallelujah. Whether
[1:23:10] you're conscious of it or you're not
[1:23:11] conscious of it, the spirit upon the
[1:23:13] children of the world hates the spirit
[1:23:15] that you have yet tonight.
[1:23:20] Then hear the bomb. No matter how just
[1:23:22] and upright a Christian is before the
[1:23:24] public, how gracious he is to his fellow
[1:23:26] man. Now if you don't know no if you
[1:23:29] don't know this, you going to get
[1:23:30] frustrated. You go say not your calling.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah. You understand I mean you
[1:23:35] wrong message. You wrong Bible reading.
[1:23:37] You understand? You're not even
[1:23:39] connected with Romans 8:28. And we know
[1:23:42] that not some things. Some people
[1:23:44] believe when good things work good that
[1:23:46] the Lord you know but the Bible say all
[1:23:48] things. So watch this now. No matter how
[1:23:51] just and upright a Christian is before
[1:23:53] the public, how gracious he is to his
[1:23:56] fellow man, doing not but good, let him
[1:23:58] confess Christ as his savior and
[1:24:00] acknowledge the operation of the gifts
[1:24:02] of the Holy Spirit in tongues, prophecy,
[1:24:06] healing, miracles, he will be condemned.
[1:24:10] They can say them is Pentecostals
[1:24:13] talking about signs of one miracle and
[1:24:14] the power of God them is Pentecostals.
[1:24:16] We re we breaking seals. Um um um um who
[1:24:20] open the seals? Um the quick in power
[1:24:22] open the seals. Yeah, that you could
[1:24:24] power the seals. But who doing sign
[1:24:26] miracles? Quick power too.
[1:24:29] Same same power. Another one. Same one.
[1:24:32] The spirit of this world hates the
[1:24:35] spirit of God. And because here we go.
[1:24:39] It can't overcome the spirit of the
[1:24:41] Lord. It tries to destroy the vessel in
[1:24:45] whom the spirit of truth dwells.
[1:24:50] Oh, give the Lord some praises. So when
[1:24:52] this bride ah get filled with the oil of
[1:24:56] the Holy Ghost that keeps saying they
[1:24:58] will not close on the church because we
[1:25:00] have books and tapes and we preaching
[1:25:01] brother or preaching the message on
[1:25:03] preaching whatever it is they're not
[1:25:04] going to close down for that. When the
[1:25:06] Holy Ghost begin to rock the world when
[1:25:10] the Pentecostal begin to shake because
[1:25:12] what happened among them so-called
[1:25:14] branomites
[1:25:15] and what is called us When they start to
[1:25:18] see the power of God, when the power of
[1:25:20] God shake among the seven thunder bride,
[1:25:22] let them identify who we are. This seven
[1:25:25] thunderbelieving bride, even the message
[1:25:27] will go get shake up because they will
[1:25:29] think it not supposed to happen. They
[1:25:31] already have the interpretation of how,
[1:25:33] when, and who and by who it going to
[1:25:35] happen. But God is his own interpreter.
[1:25:38] God not bo with them. He put the
[1:25:40] prophecy and he hang it over there. Wait
[1:25:42] till them seven thunders. Wait, wait,
[1:25:45] wait, wait, wait. Keep on waiting. You
[1:25:48] will see something. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:25:50] shout. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The world
[1:25:54] is waiting right now.
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:07] Start Start a war looking with the
[1:26:09] peace. Noah peace prize. Unbelievable.
[1:26:13] Start Start a war and then looking
[1:26:17] like you're playing both sides doing
[1:26:19] mischief here and you're looking for
[1:26:20] peace.
[1:26:23] Let's go. I think Isaac struck this.
[1:26:26] Persecution and trials. Yes. You see
[1:26:29] where I'm coming to now? I start all
[1:26:31] those what and how and then come to this
[1:26:32] year now because you have to behave a
[1:26:34] certain behavior and miss what you're
[1:26:36] going through. And until you get to that
[1:26:39] talk about fasting, don't do let
[1:26:43] Pharisees when they fasting everybody
[1:26:44] know what they did fasting.
[1:26:48] You see like
[1:26:50] you're fasting fasting.
[1:26:54] Jesus Jesus correct that. He said wash
[1:26:56] your face. Don't appear
[1:27:00] in a religious mode. The people praise
[1:27:02] the Lord.
[1:27:04] My girl, Catholic blessing,
[1:27:07] but wash your face. Don't appear like
[1:27:10] that. Your father going to reward you in
[1:27:12] heaven because you're appearing to him.
[1:27:14] You see, let him see your faith in what
[1:27:16] you're doing.
[1:27:18] Persecution trials are natural normal
[1:27:20] part of the Christian life. I wonder if
[1:27:22] the message will know that
[1:27:26] church don't know what I going through.
[1:27:28] Really? Yeah. M say what you going
[1:27:31] through? You're playing dumb.
[1:27:34] If you say what you going through, we
[1:27:36] could pray for you and let God send
[1:27:38] reinforcement. But you're going through
[1:27:39] and and the devil sitting on your top
[1:27:41] lip because you're private. You want
[1:27:44] nobody know.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah. Persecution and trials are
[1:27:48] natural normal part of Christian life.
[1:27:51] There's only one thing you can do about
[1:27:52] them. Commit them all to God. Judge not
[1:27:57] and leave the outworking and final
[1:27:59] judgment to him.
[1:28:00] I have to deal with all kind of cases
[1:28:02] come my way sometimes and I don't have
[1:28:04] all the answers but I commit into the
[1:28:06] hands of God because God is the one that
[1:28:07] sort out somebody come they had this
[1:28:09] condition that condition and get
[1:28:10] baptized him be baptized in Jesus name I
[1:28:13] am not the one I am not God I'm not
[1:28:15] Jesus and I'm not the Holy Ghost
[1:28:21] thou cast them which are evil and thou
[1:28:24] has tried them which say they apostles
[1:28:26] and are not and has found them liars
[1:28:29] these These Ephesians believed that
[1:28:31] God's people ought to be holy according
[1:28:34] to this verse. They took steps to keep
[1:28:37] the body unleaven from sin. They not the
[1:28:39] pastor dut
[1:28:41] all of us have a responsibility to keep
[1:28:43] this body from sin. Most evidently the
[1:28:47] apost the the apost the apostasy had
[1:28:50] already started. Sin had entered into
[1:28:53] the church and they were obedient to the
[1:28:56] words of Paul when he said, "Put away
[1:28:58] the wicked from among them." Amen. They
[1:29:02] were a separated people. They had come
[1:29:04] out of the world and now they weren't
[1:29:06] going to let the world enter amongst
[1:29:08] them. They will not put up with sin in
[1:29:11] the church. Holiness wasn't a phrase
[1:29:14] with them or a figure of speech. It was
[1:29:16] a way of life.
[1:29:19] Thou has tried them which say the
[1:29:20] apostles are not found them liars. My
[1:29:22] that's a blunt statement. Thou has tried
[1:29:25] them who say call themselves apostles.
[1:29:27] Isn't that presumptuous? What right has
[1:29:29] a people to try those who call
[1:29:31] themselves apostles? How did they try
[1:29:33] them? I love this. And then switches to
[1:29:36] Galatians 18. Though we or an angel from
[1:29:39] heaven they not earthly angel now coming
[1:29:42] with a Mercedes-Benz or some kind of
[1:29:43] fancy car not angel this angel from
[1:29:45] heaven one with fresh right back wings
[1:29:48] and stuff. All right watch. If a angel
[1:29:51] come from heaven and preach any other
[1:29:53] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:29:55] already preached let him be accursed.
[1:29:58] Hear it above now. It was the apostle
[1:30:00] who brought the original word to the
[1:30:03] people. Shout out original word.
[1:30:06] This is what on books on the tapes.
[1:30:08] Original word. Men take that and twist
[1:30:10] that. But God brought original word.
[1:30:13] That's why he say what the tape say and
[1:30:15] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:30:19] will say the same thing. And what they
[1:30:21] say will already be said in the word
[1:30:23] because what the prophet brought is
[1:30:24] original word. And original word is the
[1:30:27] original seed. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:30:30] Give the Lord a praise in the house.
[1:30:32] Original word. It came out of the mouth
[1:30:35] of God because man shall not live by
[1:30:37] bread alone but every word that proceed
[1:30:39] out of the mouth of God and the mouth of
[1:30:41] God are his prophets. So when the word
[1:30:43] come out the mouth of God that's
[1:30:44] original word. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:30:47] That word is what is going to be in the
[1:30:49] bride. Not some man's interpretation not
[1:30:52] some man's revelation not some man's
[1:30:55] inspiration but the original word. That
[1:30:58] is what they brought. That is what the
[1:31:00] message got away from the original word.
[1:31:03] Because all of them is mighty preachers.
[1:31:04] They don't need this. They don't need to
[1:31:06] quote. They don't need to say what the
[1:31:08] promises say. They've given Bible
[1:31:10] stories.
[1:31:13] Let's continue. It was the apostles who
[1:31:16] brought the original word to the people.
[1:31:18] That original word could not change. Not
[1:31:21] for a dot or a dash of it. Paul knew it
[1:31:24] was God who had spoken to him. So he
[1:31:25] said even if I come and try to give a
[1:31:29] second revelation, try to make one
[1:31:32] little change in what originally let me
[1:31:34] be accursed.
[1:31:35] This is Paul. He said, you see, Paul
[1:31:38] knew the first revelation was correct.
[1:31:40] God cannot give a first revelation and
[1:31:42] then a second revelation. If he did,
[1:31:44] he'll be changing his mind. He can give
[1:31:47] a revelation and then add to it. As he
[1:31:49] did in the Garden of Eden when they
[1:31:51] promised the seed of the woman, then
[1:31:52] later designated the seed to come
[1:31:54] through Abraham. Then later he said it
[1:31:55] will come through the bloodline of
[1:31:56] David. But it was the same revelation.
[1:31:59] It only give people more information to
[1:32:02] help them to receive and to understand
[1:32:04] it. But God's word can't change. The
[1:32:07] seed came exactly as revealed. And we
[1:32:10] see those false possible doing. They
[1:32:12] came here brother George with their own
[1:32:14] word. That is what they came with. They
[1:32:17] are their own prophets. They bringing
[1:32:19] their own revelations, putting their own
[1:32:21] stamp, printing their own sermons and
[1:32:23] pushing that in the people. And the
[1:32:24] people don't have a clue what this
[1:32:26] prophet said of Malachi 4. They're
[1:32:28] clueless. So when you preach like this
[1:32:30] with these promises, they want to know
[1:32:32] where that come from. How we could say
[1:32:33] it. So they don't even know what the
[1:32:35] prophet say. They know what the pastor
[1:32:36] say, but they don't know what the
[1:32:37] prophet said. Oh, glory to God. But that
[1:32:39] spirit that has to come upon a bride
[1:32:42] know what the prophet said. That spirit
[1:32:44] know exactly what came out of the
[1:32:46] prophet's mouth. And when that word is
[1:32:48] in you, hallelujah, that spirit will
[1:32:50] find you because the spirit and the
[1:32:53] bride Say come. The spirit have to
[1:32:56] anoint the bride. The spirit of the monk
[1:32:58] the bride. The spirit will come upon you
[1:33:01] to give the bride a voice. Once more the
[1:33:04] world will hear direct from God. Oh,
[1:33:07] give the Lord a shout. May it start
[1:33:10] tonight. Oh, glory to God. May it come
[1:33:12] upon you because you will be a live
[1:33:15] voice. Oh, glory to God. How did you
[1:33:17] hear that? You will become a live voice.
[1:33:20] That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:33:22] devil.
[1:33:23] Oh, glory to God. You'll be living the
[1:33:25] word.
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:30] So these false apostles,
[1:33:33] I find a scripture, you know, where they
[1:33:34] call two names, you know. Hallelujah.
[1:33:36] They call the names of them fellows who
[1:33:37] somebody fa they name them, you know. I
[1:33:40] said, Lord, I watch that. Okay, they
[1:33:41] call names. I ain't got no witness to do
[1:33:43] that yet. God tell me they call names.
[1:33:46] If God tell me to call them, I call the
[1:33:48] names. I have a scripture for it. I
[1:33:50] ain't going there. They were they came
[1:33:53] with their own word. Those Ephesians
[1:33:56] knew that word that Paul had taught it
[1:34:00] as Paul taught it. They were full of the
[1:34:02] Holy Ghost. Here we go. By the laying on
[1:34:05] of Paul's hands.
[1:34:11] They looked those false apostles in the
[1:34:12] eye and said, "You are not saying what
[1:34:14] Paul said. You are therefore false."
[1:34:18] Simple. 10year-old
[1:34:24] 10 year old just my grandson be 10 some
[1:34:29] spoken words in the back of the seat of
[1:34:30] the car he loves to read so he coming
[1:34:32] home from school he pick up a spoken
[1:34:34] book first I seen that in the back start
[1:34:36] to read so I turn around I see the book
[1:34:38] I said I feel good I said what book is
[1:34:39] that he said imagine the voice I said
[1:34:40] put that back
[1:34:43] I say find the next one
[1:34:45] you pick up the next one against organ
[1:34:47] relation you could read
[1:34:51] just know
[1:34:54] be taken in that word you know. So what
[1:34:56] I'm saying then they could say if you're
[1:34:58] not seeing what Paul's saying therefore
[1:35:00] you are false. Oh he that sets my heart
[1:35:02] on fire. Get back to the word. It is not
[1:35:06] you that really tries the apostles and
[1:35:07] prophet and teacher. It is the word that
[1:35:09] tries them. God almighty say I know
[1:35:12] there he is walking in the midst of his
[1:35:14] people. There he is the chief shepherd
[1:35:16] of the flock. But does he hold back the
[1:35:19] persecution?
[1:35:20] Does he stem the tribulation? No, he
[1:35:23] does not. He simply says, "I know your
[1:35:27] tribulation.
[1:35:28] I am not at all unmindful of your
[1:35:31] suffering." What a stumbling block this
[1:35:34] has to so many people. Like Israel, they
[1:35:36] wonder if God really loves them. How can
[1:35:38] God be just and loving if he stands by
[1:35:40] and watches people suffer? This is what
[1:35:42] they ask in Malachi 1:3 and 4, the
[1:35:44] burden of the world of the Lord to
[1:35:45] Israel of Malachi. I have loved you.
[1:35:47] said the Lord, yet we say, "Where has
[1:35:49] thou loved us?" Was that Esau Jacob's
[1:35:51] brother? And the Lord said, "I love
[1:35:52] Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his
[1:35:55] mountain to waste." You see, they
[1:35:57] couldn't figure out God's love. Is it
[1:36:00] exactly right on Sunday? They thought
[1:36:01] that love meant no suffering. They
[1:36:04] thought that love meant baby with
[1:36:05] parental care. That's what they love. A
[1:36:08] nice loving sweet pastor, man. Nice to
[1:36:11] man.
[1:36:14] Good thing Good thing I'm not God.
[1:36:18] They thought love meant baby with parent
[1:36:20] and care. But God said his love was
[1:36:22] elective love. And the proof of his love
[1:36:25] is election. Well, you want better than
[1:36:27] that. God elected you. Who he fornally
[1:36:30] called. Who he call he justified. Who he
[1:36:32] justified already glorified. You have
[1:36:34] the proof tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:36:38] Hallelujah. God said his love was
[1:36:41] elective love. The proof of his love is
[1:36:43] election. Election. So no matter what
[1:36:45] happened, his love is truly proven by
[1:36:46] the fact that they were chosen under
[1:36:48] salvation because God had chosen you to
[1:36:51] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:36:54] spirit and belief of true truth. He may
[1:36:57] commit you to debt as he did Paul. Write
[1:37:00] with me. Write with me now. He may
[1:37:02] commit you to suffering as he did Job.
[1:37:04] That is his prerogative. He in charge of
[1:37:06] the part you play, the role you have to
[1:37:09] take, what trials you have to come to.
[1:37:11] Every trial is customized to suit you.
[1:37:15] So don't watch my trial, watch yours.
[1:37:17] Mind your own business. My y o give the
[1:37:20] Lord some praises. Give the Lord a shout
[1:37:21] in the house. Hallelujah. Don't look at
[1:37:24] your brother. Don't look at your sister.
[1:37:25] Don't look at what this one going
[1:37:26] through.
[1:37:32] He may commit you to suffering. He is a
[1:37:33] job. That is his prerogative. He is
[1:37:35] sovereign. But it is all with a purpose.
[1:37:37] Now this is the this is the key part
[1:37:39] here. If he did not have a purpose, then
[1:37:43] he would be the author of frustration
[1:37:45] and not peace. His purpose, are you
[1:37:48] ready? Is that after we have suffered a
[1:37:51] while, we would be made perfect, be
[1:37:55] established,
[1:37:56] strengthened and settled as Job said, he
[1:37:59] put strength in us. You see, he himself
[1:38:02] suffered. That's why I preached the
[1:38:04] other day about God in his labor pains
[1:38:07] bringing forth you. Amen. He had labor
[1:38:10] pains. So he is connected with how
[1:38:12] nature works, with how life works, with
[1:38:15] the seed and planted. So shall my word
[1:38:17] be that goeth out of my mouth. It shall
[1:38:20] not return to me void. Hallelujah. As a
[1:38:22] seed is planted and rain cometh and so
[1:38:24] on. He speaks like that. This is the God
[1:38:27] we serve. You see, he himself suffered.
[1:38:30] But Ram's going deeper. He learned
[1:38:32] obedience by the thing which he
[1:38:33] suffered. He was actually made perfect
[1:38:36] by the things that he suffered. This is
[1:38:38] Jesus. So where you fighting?
[1:38:42] And he quote the scripture for it. If
[1:38:44] Hebrews 5 8, though he was a son, he
[1:38:47] learned obedience by he suffered being
[1:38:50] made perfect, he became the author of
[1:38:52] eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:38:54] obey him. Hallelujah. In plain language.
[1:38:57] Here we go. Almost done. The very
[1:39:00] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:39:02] suffering.
[1:39:05] You can take some more. And according to
[1:39:08] Paul,
[1:39:09] he has left his church a measure of
[1:39:13] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:39:17] in God while suffering for him would
[1:39:21] come to a place perfection note not your
[1:39:24] suffering because you do a set of
[1:39:25] sharpness and you're paying the price
[1:39:27] you know this for him you know not for
[1:39:30] you and your foolishness and you're
[1:39:31] going through and you're going through
[1:39:32] know you act and you decide and you act
[1:39:35] and speak and coring certain way you pay
[1:39:38] that price for your mouth. That's why I
[1:39:40] ask the question is temperance if that
[1:39:41] virtue is a testimony of somebody dying
[1:39:44] out cuz the first thing that hit you in
[1:39:46] dying out is your mouth.
[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:53] So by their faith in God while suffering
[1:39:55] for him would come to a place of
[1:39:56] perfection. Why did he want this? See
[1:39:59] how all the scriptures come together.
[1:40:01] And why did he want this? And Baram
[1:40:02] dropped down James. My brethren, count
[1:40:04] it all joy. When you fall into d
[1:40:06] temptations, knowing this, trying of
[1:40:08] your faith, work at what? Patience. But
[1:40:11] patience have a perfect work that you
[1:40:13] may be perfect and entire wanting
[1:40:15] nothing. So patience is what gives this
[1:40:19] birth.
[1:40:21] To being entire wanting nothing. And the
[1:40:24] only way to get patience is to God drop
[1:40:26] the trial of your faith to make you
[1:40:28] wait. Hallelujah. So Abraham wait 25
[1:40:30] years.
[1:40:34] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:40:38] Jesus had to wait 18 years.
[1:40:41] Hallelujah. Up room disciples had to
[1:40:43] wait how much days?
[1:40:46] Got to wait until
[1:40:48] I don't know how long you had to wait.
[1:40:50] 40 years past, 50 years pass. We still
[1:40:51] waiting. Somebody said they got it. They
[1:40:53] got it. They got it already. Let them go
[1:40:55] with what they got. Let them face the
[1:40:57] conation. Let them face Golat what they
[1:40:58] got. They may see
[1:41:02] right now is in the text
[1:41:05] is a scripture to them there they
[1:41:08] already face golat
[1:41:13] watch let patient have a perfect work
[1:41:14] that may be perfect in tat why does he
[1:41:16] stand by the reason is Romans 8:17 if
[1:41:19] children
[1:41:21] Isa is struck then is of God joint is
[1:41:26] with Christ if so be that We suffer with
[1:41:29] him that we may be glorified together.
[1:41:31] No suffering, no reigning. Suffer to
[1:41:33] reign. Amen. And I reckon I love this
[1:41:37] that the sufferings
[1:41:39] of this present time. Jesus actually
[1:41:42] looked beyond the beyond the the the
[1:41:44] grave, you know, and saw the
[1:41:46] resurrection. You know, if you're only
[1:41:47] looking at the grave alone, you who's
[1:41:48] cooking. That's right. You're like
[1:41:50] you're dead. You're done. You know, but
[1:41:51] when Jesus saw beyond the grave and saw
[1:41:53] the resurrection, he knew death only had
[1:41:56] one place to hold him. Amen. Oh, give
[1:41:58] the Lord a shout. And once you push past
[1:42:00] death, he rise again. He said, "Destroy
[1:42:02] this body in three days. I myself will
[1:42:04] raise it up." Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:42:07] So, you have to look at something.
[1:42:10] I reckon that the
[1:42:13] present time is not worthy. Your capital
[1:42:17] same scale then to be compared with the
[1:42:19] glory that shall reveal us. Almost done.
[1:42:22] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:42:24] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[1:42:27] reign.
[1:42:28] Hear the reason for that, brother.
[1:42:30] George, for this, the reason for this is
[1:42:34] that character
[1:42:37] simply
[1:42:40] cannot be made without suffering.
[1:42:43] I'm the pastor's son. I'm the deacon's
[1:42:45] son. I'm the elder son. I'm the pastor
[1:42:47] daughter.
[1:42:50] I'm the pastor, my brother. I'm the
[1:42:51] pastor cousin. I'm a deacon in church.
[1:42:54] different. No suffering guaranteed. It's
[1:42:57] jacket and tie and we have dinner
[1:42:59] downstairs.
[1:43:02] I can't preach that. I can't teach you.
[1:43:05] You come here and you the bride. That
[1:43:07] kind of carnival band thing. You just
[1:43:09] buy a costume. You just pay for a
[1:43:11] costume. You you join the church and
[1:43:13] you're the bride. We're not in the
[1:43:14] Bible.
[1:43:18] But said this being talking about this
[1:43:21] spoken of man when it is completed
[1:43:24] is the servant of God. He ain't talk
[1:43:26] about the teaching the preaching the
[1:43:28] revelation 4our service 5 hour service
[1:43:30] mysteries be unfolding and all kind of
[1:43:32] thing people who never see it. He talk
[1:43:34] about that you know this being sir when
[1:43:38] it is completed he say well the church
[1:43:40] have 2,000 now uh 2,000 people now we
[1:43:43] the bride or the church have two we
[1:43:46] little flock we the bride
[1:43:49] people say all kind of thing you know
[1:43:51] when church big they say is the bride
[1:43:53] revival everybody come by us when they
[1:43:55] small little flock
[1:43:58] you can't you can't you can't win them
[1:43:59] at all you know they hit you left and
[1:44:01] right you can't win them. You can't win
[1:44:04] them at all. I I I offer that.
[1:44:09] The reason for this is that character
[1:44:12] simply is never made without suffering.
[1:44:15] Character is a victory, not a gift. So a
[1:44:20] ministerial gift is not character.
[1:44:26] A preaching gift is not character. A
[1:44:29] teaching gift is not character. And a
[1:44:31] bustly gift is not character. A prophet
[1:44:34] gift is not character. Character stands
[1:44:36] on his own. Oh, give the Lord a shout. I
[1:44:39] feel inspired tonight. Character stands
[1:44:42] on his own.
[1:44:47] So a man can have character, no gift. It
[1:44:50] is still character.
[1:44:53] Because gifts and calling is without
[1:44:55] repentance. You're born with this thing.
[1:44:58] You're born to sing. You're born to
[1:45:00] shout. You're born to preach. You're
[1:45:01] born to exhort. You're born with that
[1:45:04] gift. Nobody could take it from you. But
[1:45:06] you need character. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:45:08] shout in the house.
[1:45:13] I know 10our message giving you that.
[1:45:19] Let me say it again. Man come to preach
[1:45:21] your voice to the angel. Preach your
[1:45:22] voice. Preach your voice. Blow trumpet.
[1:45:25] When you preaching blood trump, have a
[1:45:26] trumpet of truth. Have your own trumpet
[1:45:28] to blow. That is not giving it
[1:45:30] character. A man draw the pyramid
[1:45:33] connect everything together and make all
[1:45:34] kind of symbols and similian stuff and
[1:45:36] that's not character
[1:45:38] that's on a blackboard.
[1:45:41] Israel sow the Jews so and so and the
[1:45:45] three woes and the woman of the sun and
[1:45:48] everything connected. What a message.
[1:45:52] Never
[1:45:54] hallelujah. All your gray matter
[1:45:55] stimulated that character know that the
[1:45:58] stimulation of gray matter but
[1:46:00] information you never see before not
[1:46:02] even revelation information.
[1:46:08] You see when brother lost his wife and
[1:46:10] the devil tell him a child next and he
[1:46:13] know he's serving God and he said nah
[1:46:16] and devil say look at you you serving
[1:46:18] God all these years and you see what you
[1:46:20] doing in other words why why you don't
[1:46:22] switch sides
[1:46:24] cuz you serving him and look how he
[1:46:26] treating you the lost wife already and
[1:46:28] your nice beautiful baby girl she going
[1:46:30] too
[1:46:33] banging him in banging him in you're
[1:46:34] under pressure and listen he is
[1:46:37] physically weak
[1:46:38] because he's saving people with the
[1:46:39] boat. He put in extra to save and help
[1:46:42] people. He's doing his best. But God
[1:46:44] told him, "Go among them Pentecostal."
[1:46:46] Somebody tell him, "Nah, leave them
[1:46:48] people alone." He follow that. He have a
[1:46:50] price to pay. And when he almost given,
[1:46:53] he just say the Lord give. You see
[1:46:55] that's inside of him. The Lord take it
[1:46:57] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:47:00] Is not what he was going through. It's
[1:47:01] how he was going through it. Oh, give
[1:47:03] the Lord a shout. That is Christianity.
[1:47:07] That is son of God. That is character.
[1:47:11] That is right behavior. That's how the
[1:47:13] father can look down and say, "There is
[1:47:15] my son. He's a chip off the old block.
[1:47:17] He is just like me."
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:27] Next person get you know I ser all these
[1:47:30] years. You're ungrateful.
[1:47:34] Declare talking to the potter.
[1:47:38] declare talking to the potter back
[1:47:39] chatting one time brotherham pray for
[1:47:42] somebody and the person died and and and
[1:47:45] he expect them to live think somebody
[1:47:47] was drunk or something so and they died
[1:47:50] and he said God you owe me answer God
[1:47:51] had talked him for a long time God rest
[1:47:53] him on the shelf and leave him there
[1:47:56] leave him right there high and dry I
[1:47:58] don't owe you no answer then God the
[1:48:00] mercy of God come down and show him that
[1:48:01] person must die so long I gave them
[1:48:02] extent they was living over extension we
[1:48:04] talking about time to call them home.
[1:48:07] Glory to God know your date. God know
[1:48:08] your time. God know your hour. You can't
[1:48:10] miss it for nothing. Time to quick take
[1:48:13] them home. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:48:15] praises. Hallelujah. He said boundary we
[1:48:17] can't pass.
[1:48:19] Exercise how much you want to exercise.
[1:48:20] Take all the pills you want to take.
[1:48:21] Take the pills.
[1:48:25] Character is a victory, not a gift. Not
[1:48:28] a gift. Have a gift. Have a gift. Man
[1:48:32] walking with a gift coming to church.
[1:48:33] Everyone know the bigger. Hallelujah.
[1:48:35] And I want I felt come to the guitar and
[1:48:38] and I watching him watching he and the
[1:48:39] guitar
[1:48:41] I'm not guitar he I want to know what
[1:48:43] behind him
[1:48:45] because he could just be a star boy
[1:48:48] I mean he come to staring ding he come
[1:48:50] to play
[1:48:53] I want to know what is the method what's
[1:48:54] his spirit what's the motive what's the
[1:48:55] objective
[1:48:58] that's what discernment is built on what
[1:49:01] is somebody motive and objective in what
[1:49:02] they do in what they say and how they
[1:49:04] act.
[1:49:06] Hallelujah. All right, let's continue.
[1:49:07] Oh gosh. Character is a victory, not a
[1:49:10] gift. A man without character can't
[1:49:13] reign because power apart apart from
[1:49:15] character is satanic. But power with
[1:49:18] character is fit to rule. And since he
[1:49:20] wants us to share his throne on the same
[1:49:22] basis that he overcame and is sitting on
[1:49:25] the father's throne, then we have to
[1:49:26] overcome to sit with him. And the little
[1:49:29] temporary suffering we go through now is
[1:49:32] not worthy to be compared to the
[1:49:34] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:49:36] in us when he comes.
[1:49:39] Oh, the treasures are laid up for those
[1:49:41] who are willing to enter into his
[1:49:43] kingdom through much tribulation.
[1:49:46] Hallelujah. Almost finished here. And
[1:49:48] I'll keep saying that. Thinking that's
[1:49:50] strange concerning the fiery trials that
[1:49:52] try you. That's what Peter said. It is
[1:49:54] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:49:57] Christlike character that comes through
[1:49:59] suffering. We all have trials. We all
[1:50:02] are tried and chasing as sons. No one
[1:50:04] but goes through that. The church that
[1:50:06] is not suffering, is not being tried
[1:50:09] hasn't isn't of God.
[1:50:13] Glory to God. Hallelujah. I used to tell
[1:50:15] people ask God for revelation to be in
[1:50:16] this tabernacle because when it start to
[1:50:18] rock and shake, it will rock you out of
[1:50:19] it. Okay. The Lord has shout some get
[1:50:21] rocked straight out of it. Hallelujah.
[1:50:23] You have to know God speak to you. You
[1:50:25] have to know why you're here and what
[1:50:27] you are here for. Nobody can come and
[1:50:28] talk you out and he pastor this and he
[1:50:30] pastor that and pastor that. That's
[1:50:31] foolishness. You see a man of God stand
[1:50:34] up here preaching the word of God. God
[1:50:35] put the man here for a purpose to make
[1:50:38] sure you make it in. Oh, give the Lord
[1:50:40] some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:50:44] The church that is not suffering is not
[1:50:47] being tried and isn't of God. Hebrews
[1:50:49] 126, for whom the Lord loveth, he chase
[1:50:52] not. Yes. You only putting licks on them
[1:50:53] he love. You only straight on them he
[1:50:55] love. You only rebuking them love them.
[1:50:57] He don't love rebuking at all. He tell
[1:51:00] them nothing. Leave them alone. But the
[1:51:02] ones he love, hey, word coming, man.
[1:51:04] They could take correction. They could
[1:51:06] take the word. They could bend. They
[1:51:08] could flex. Hallelujah. Can't bend and
[1:51:10] flex. You will break. Okay. The Lord
[1:51:13] shout you will break you. Hallelujah.
[1:51:15] Behold, I laid Zion for a foundation. A
[1:51:17] stone, a tried stone, a precious corner
[1:51:20] of stone. It's either Amen. You fall in
[1:51:22] it or you're going to fall on you. Oh,
[1:51:24] give the Lord a shout. You'll be broken.
[1:51:27] This headstone will break you.
[1:51:29] Hallelujah.
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:34] Hallelujah. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:51:37] chastenth and scorcheth every son whom
[1:51:40] he receiveth. And if you be without
[1:51:41] chastisement, we have all your
[1:51:43] partakers. You are bastard and not sons.
[1:51:46] That is the people who can't take
[1:51:47] correction, can't take rebuke.
[1:51:50] And I realize people can't take
[1:51:52] correction. Most times it's people who
[1:51:53] don't want discipline. That's right. And
[1:51:55] don't want accountability.
[1:51:59] Once you don't want discipline and
[1:52:02] accountability, these people don't want
[1:52:04] tell them anything because they want to
[1:52:06] do what they want to do, when they want
[1:52:07] to do it, and how they want to do it.
[1:52:10] Hallelujah. When, what, and how
[1:52:13] you want this to be done and and how to
[1:52:16] do it and what they want to do it their
[1:52:18] way and they want to do it whenever they
[1:52:20] want to do it and they don't want to be
[1:52:22] no accountable to no one.
[1:52:25] Hallelujah. But it doesn't have that in
[1:52:27] God's program.
[1:52:29] Hear this, Mom. This special condition
[1:52:32] in Smyrna must be applied to every age.
[1:52:37] Every age. what we just preached there.
[1:52:39] It's for every age, including our age.
[1:52:41] There is no age free from it. There is
[1:52:43] no believer true believer free from it.
[1:52:46] This is of God. This is the will of God.
[1:52:49] It is needful. We need the Lord to teach
[1:52:52] us the truth. That we are to suffer and
[1:52:55] be Christlike in doing it. So all I
[1:52:59] start in the beginning is to bring it to
[1:53:00] here. It's not what, but how. It's not
[1:53:04] what you're going through, but how
[1:53:06] you're going through. He said we are to
[1:53:08] suffer and be Christlike doing it. And
[1:53:11] then he hit the bomb. Love suffered long
[1:53:13] and is kind
[1:53:15] not in school.
[1:53:18] Hallelujah.
[1:53:20] Love
[1:53:22] suffered long and I want to give she
[1:53:24] good and I want to hit she good. And
[1:53:27] love suffered long. Look at the quality
[1:53:31] of love. It's kind. That's a big one.
[1:53:35] There's a but Stephen there's a huge
[1:53:37] quality to be suffering people lying and
[1:53:40] you say all kind of thing and you still
[1:53:42] be kind
[1:53:44] they say you couldn't distinguish but a
[1:53:46] brand enemy from his friends
[1:53:50] Matthew 5 112 blessed are ye when men
[1:53:52] shall revile you and persecute you shall
[1:53:54] say all man of evil against you for my
[1:53:55] name's sake rejoice and be exceeding
[1:53:58] glad not go and write texts on on
[1:54:01] Facebook that that they revile you and
[1:54:05] wicked
[1:54:06] that tabernacle day. I go put him on
[1:54:09] Facebook. I go tell him about this man
[1:54:11] called Hallelujah.
[1:54:15] Blessed are you when men revile you and
[1:54:16] persecute you. Jesus say you're a
[1:54:18] blessing. So if you don't believe that
[1:54:21] you see when the unbeliever come in the
[1:54:22] message you don't believe this you feel
[1:54:24] you're not blessing. for God.
[1:54:27] Some sisters, they can't even put it to
[1:54:28] cover their knees because they want to
[1:54:30] be persecuted
[1:54:34] all them rip pants. I just be so think I
[1:54:37] just can't get it. Old people and all in
[1:54:38] that foolishness, men and all in that
[1:54:41] you know study if aliens was to look
[1:54:42] down here there was aliens and look at
[1:54:44] the wood. What is this boy?
[1:54:47] Hallelujah. They will fly back out. You
[1:54:49] know, they say what is this? Them people
[1:54:51] normal in the head.
[1:54:54] How how would looking so rip up like if
[1:54:56] poverty take them like vagrant like like
[1:55:00] you don't expect vagrant to be looking
[1:55:01] so unm normal normal normal normal
[1:55:04] because that's style. How the how the
[1:55:06] aliens going figure out that style just
[1:55:09] mine
[1:55:11] but to this reviling and persecuting he
[1:55:13] said rejoice not just rejoice but
[1:55:16] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[1:55:19] in heaven for so persecuted the prophets
[1:55:22] which are before you.
[1:55:25] I'm anchoring the mission on Sundays.
[1:55:28] Beautiful. The cloudy skies and storms
[1:55:30] of life are no signs of God's approval.
[1:55:33] Neither are the bright skies and still
[1:55:34] waters signs of his love and approval.
[1:55:36] His approval of any of us is only in the
[1:55:39] beloved. His love is elective which he
[1:55:42] had for us before the found. Does he
[1:55:44] love us? Yes. How shall we know? We
[1:55:46] shall know it because he said so. And he
[1:55:49] manifest his love to us. He brought us
[1:55:51] to himself and give us of his spirit
[1:55:53] placing us as sons. How shall I prove my
[1:55:56] love to him? This is my favorite quote
[1:55:58] for years. By conducting what? How shall
[1:56:00] I prove my love to? By believing what he
[1:56:02] said and by conducting myself with joy
[1:56:05] amidst my trials that he in his wisdom
[1:56:07] allow come to pass. Not conduct yourself
[1:56:10] with frustration and you're fed up and
[1:56:11] you can't take it no more and you're
[1:56:13] done. That's you. That your flesh
[1:56:14] jumping up. It just goes to show how
[1:56:16] much you had to die. Amen.
[1:56:20] Missions, come a please.
[1:56:25] I know thy poverty, but thou art rich.
[1:56:29] Begin to play ball. There it is again.
[1:56:32] Hallelujah. See him walking up and down
[1:56:33] the midst of his church. Hallelujah.
[1:56:35] Like a father. He's looking down upon
[1:56:37] his family. He's the head of his
[1:56:39] household. Jesus. He's a provider. Lord,
[1:56:42] he's a protector. He looks on their
[1:56:44] poverty and how the untutoed believer
[1:56:47] stumbles at this. How can God bear to
[1:56:51] look upon his own in a time of need and
[1:56:54] not just stop it all and just give in
[1:56:56] and and lavish everything material upon
[1:56:58] them? Here is where you have to believe
[1:57:00] again in the love and the goodness and
[1:57:03] the wisdom of God. This too is needful.
[1:57:06] Remember he admonished. Take no thought
[1:57:08] for tomorrow. What you shall eat, what
[1:57:10] you shall put on. Let's watch. Your
[1:57:11] father knoweth the things you have need
[1:57:13] of. Father God, we thank you tonight.
[1:57:17] And I pray that your holy spirit will
[1:57:18] come and write the words in the hearts
[1:57:20] of your children that they may conduct
[1:57:23] their lives differently. That they'll
[1:57:25] get a reboot in their mind, a
[1:57:26] transformation in their mind, a
[1:57:29] reformation in their mind that will
[1:57:30] think completely different.
[1:57:33] Jesus waited in silence until his time
[1:57:35] came to go to the temple and read the
[1:57:37] book. He had to wait on his time. You
[1:57:41] have to wait on his ministry. You have
[1:57:43] to wait on the movement of the spirit.
[1:57:44] Father God, help us tonight. I commit
[1:57:46] their lives into their hands. May they
[1:57:48] wake up. May they shake. And may they
[1:57:50] realize it's not just what we do, but
