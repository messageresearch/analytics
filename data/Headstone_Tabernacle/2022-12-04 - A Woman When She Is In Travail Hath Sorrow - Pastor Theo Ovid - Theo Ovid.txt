and we want to express our condolences to the family our prayers with them this morning food announcement will meet after service you know it's tomorrow but God is good God is gracious and us talking a little bit about Terence last night he was telling me that when they went just until 2007 wheat it was his sister's elder sister who told about an experience of a sister who died suddenly accident and by Ram told her that when you see the saints of God taken suddenly as God called him home it's not no suffering no long pain or what not just God just snatch them and call his sons and call his daughters that is something that is something so I really appreciate what I what I see and I know is the hand of God and to see that he actually gave his son son Jesse instructions exactly what to do how to do it it's really really something and you know at all his wife praise God it's almost like he was hustled home you know I'm ready time to go on home and happy it's the things that has gone on

our desire to be drawn closer to you and I pray that you would bless the family in a special way may your comfort your love your surrounding presence and power be with them in a special way in the name of Jesus strengthens so Wendy the children visit them with your presence and Paul this morning if you approach your word Lord may your anointed and inspired a heart as we wait on you and Jason we ask a demon do you have your seats are like there's in one portion of scripture from Saint John chapter 16 I want to read from verse 16 to 31. praise the Lord it's in job 16. uh 16. a little while this Jesus speaks a little while and he shall not see me and again you shall see me because I go to the father then said some of the disciples among themselves what is this that he said unto us a little while he shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me and because I go to the father they said therefore what is this that he said a little while you cannot tell what he said now Jesus knew that they would desire us to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of what I said a little while he shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me verily Vera license to you that you shall weep and Lament the world shall rejoice you shall be sorrowful but your soul shall be turned into Joy a woman when she's in trouble had sorrow because her all is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world ye no therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man take it from you in that day you shall ask me nothing like verily I said to you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have I spoken to you in Proverbs but the time commit when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs I shall show you plainly of the father at that day he shall ask in my name I see not unto you that I will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you and because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God I came forth from the father and I'm coming to the will again I leave the world and go to the father disciples tells him low no speakers doubt cleanly and speakers no proverb now are we sure that those all things and it is not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou came a sword from God Jesus answered them you now believe may God bless us what you may be seated o praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord so we're going to see what the Lord will do this morning we are so grateful to be in the house of God to be in his presence where we could hear this word amen this word that came from a 20th century Prophet where we could hear Dusty of the lord it's not something okay let's go put around they were divided in three different groups with three different opinions some of them believed him some of them hated him and some of them didn't know what to do and that's the way we got it Believers make believers unbelievers them tree in the groups now we can go back and prove that's the state of people always they have always been in that kind of condition then seeing that it's always been that way it makes us prone to believe that God designed people to be that way he will make his enemy to praise him Paul Wooten in eight of chapter of Romans o foolish man can decrease it to the Potter what makes us thus does he have power does he have power to make one vessel to honor and another to this honor what if he had made no night you will never appreciate the sunshine if all sunshine you would have never know to appreciate it but and if there's no sickness you will never appreciate good health what if there was no evil people no evil woman a good woman would wouldn't be honored honor wouldn't belong to her cause is just that way it's a flat thing but it's the law of contrast he call it a law a law of contrast God made it dust want to be dishonorable to show up The Honorable one so so to be far wrong it shows up watch there cannot be a bogus dollar until there's a real dollar if it was just book us to begin with there wouldn't be a real one it's a copy they cannot they cannot be sinned until there is righteousness because righteousness is the right thing and sin is the provision of righteousness in other words truth is a truth a lie can't be a lie until it's a truth first to pervert that truth into a lie so sin is nothing but righteousness perverted so we know that the day the Devil is a pervertor or he lives in provision God is the original isn't that right two systems one of them is the right system and the other is a perverted system one of them is God's word which is right and every man word is a lie and this denominational system we got today forming a welcome to the churches to make the mark of the beast to emerge them together is the wrong thing and man are blindly walking into it God don't put the thing on Earth for them to be delivered by but they think is a bunch of fanaticism Oh Glory to God the things that God put in a normal ordinary no no no without screaming with it it have shouting in it it have messy things with it oh praise God they call it fanaticism praise God because it's not the normal praise God is not the ordinary and God have to bring something to rock you and Shake you up to the humanistic realm out of the Trinidad realm out of the natural realm God have to bring stuff around you to rock your world oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh do you believe that politics watch you see for instance you see if people designed to be in three classes let's take politics there are some that's red hot fireman another group hates him another group don't know what to do about him they don't know which it throws them into confusion this man he's a great man he'll make us a great president the other one said he's nothing but a renegade then the in-between said I don't know what to do see we are designed that way we are made up that way that's the way human beings are it had to be that way to fulfill God's Great economy and to make his achievement that he's going to achieve upon the Earth man had to be designed us isn't that right no the man in between is a bad place because one can show the matter what he thinks is right the other one can show he thinks it's wrong but the one in between don't know nothing about the matter he don't know which way to turn and that's just the way it is in religion people do the same same thing today about the Eternal destination so you don't want to be the one in between you don't want to mess with money in between are they a hot or you're cold in between is lukewarm could we give the Lord a shout in the house is either a heart or your cold if you're cool you're dead if you're hot you're on fire he said I hate lukewarm I'm gonna spewed out of my mouth I've got to reject crew come I'm gonna reject reject halfway praise Hallelujah halfway Christianity halfway serving the lord God don't deserve halfway Oh Glory to God he need you to go all the way is that a heart or your cold oh praise God Mr in between reject that because that's what happened in the early church they fell from the fire they fell from the glory and they end up into lukewarm what kind of Christian are you today praise God you got better get on fire oh glory god shake off lukewarmness and look how tired you are either kept your 1999 when God spoke to Abraham he said walk before me and be all perfect oh give the Lord out not because he's an old man he said just walk before me he said walk before me and beat up perfect oh give the Lord a shout something is required of us [Applause] part of us Hallelujah prophet we're going to hurt just a minute nice guy we just who just a minute he said now watch a man will go to a restaurant right you find a spider web in your bowl of soup you want to sue that company or the restaurant why won't you eat that soup it'll be poisoned you wouldn't take it at all a big roach or something boil up in a bowl of soup you wouldn't have it at all it would make you sick to think about it but yet you let a bunch of theologians push something down your throat that will send you a Million Lives of God and God over it man shall leave my bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the Mount of God it's a chain that your soul is hanging over hell with and if you had taken a spider in your soup you shouldn't take no crap no false Doctrine or pitching or no fresh Revelation from Lucifer under the guise of mysteries or Hidden Mysteries Oh Glory will equip the Lord has shout don't take nobody Point nothing poisoned on your soul this is a weird message we've got to be on target every time every time every time Oh Glory love God [Applause] you have to know which is written it has to be by the Scriptures it has to be by the revealed word praise God because the scriptures is the absolute not part of Branham the scriptures praise God because he is subject to the scriptures that's why when the angel came to him he went back in the Bible to see if the angel is talking what the scriptures say why because he says if an angel cut from heaven and preach any other gospel let him be a curse Give the Lord a shout glory to God we have followed our man we fall in the pillar of fire we follow it God Almighty oh give the Lord a shout be not following Justice will we are following the power of fire or give the Lord and Shout glory to God Amen we have a word to follow foreign [Music] that your soul is hanging over hell with a chain is best at its weakest link one link to break break one of them the rest of them let loose with it this one is strong as his weakest link and if a person that knows if they eat that stupid or poison spies in it make you sick you have to go to the hospital you have to have your stomach pump out on the trouble to go through it will actually kill you why you would never go wrong a place like that you would never want to darken that door again because you're afraid you'll get poisoned and die and when you absolutely join up and put your names on books and fight for every cause of the thing that the Bible said is not damning your body it was sending your soul to hell he said don't add to it don't take away from it he knew in this intellectual age like manga to read books and listen to tapes and have explanation on our social media and our opinions on Facebook and WhatsApp and everything else but he's in a prophet with us here the Lord he makes sure he put it in the Bible behold I send you Elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day of the Lord we don't need an X Elijah we don't need Elijah Elias is already come we need the Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy or give the Lord a shout oh yeah yeah yeah yeah hey Hallelujah we ending on you man no freshman no another man no Mighty mind no we don't need that we need what the prophet says that because at this day this scripture is fulfilled glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God we're not here to sell packs we're not preaching a past gospel we preaching the whole car we preaching a vision we are selling points and plugs and condensers we have preaching condenser this morning we preaching the whole Vision the whole prophetic Vision that was released by Seven Seals and seven Thunders or give the Lord a shout with your preaching topics we preaching our vision all the vision is our appointed time look at me started this morning oh God help me this morning Oh Glory to God [Music] [Applause] hurray Hallelujah Hallelujah I have come to tell you only goes and a prophet I come there telling the Prophet by the prophecy and we are walking in the vision of the prophecy that the prophet brought Oh Glory to God will not read it be walking in it we're not listening to it we are walking in it okay the Lord a shout then the host foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God bless my God this message is so powerful he said the reason reason is because that man in the local church could hear from God and not theologian no message Pope nobody could tell the man what to do because hearing from God and that's why God love he said the reason like the Baptist Church is because the Baptist believes in the serenity of the local church you see if they do believe it is Affinity of local church you need Bishop so and so you need us Bishop so and so and you need Mr Pope himself I blasphope I blast Bishop I would shoot down number six don't even come by me when I raise the jacket so his bums his guns is everything you think about there's necklace and spirit we're gonna cut his head off God is a god of the audience God is a quarter of people he want to be among his people not some bunch of men playing God behind the pulpit or get the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory the court I have always been this way and I have changed it anytime soon foreign [Applause] [Music] you're a prophet no but have the testimony of Jesus and the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy but a serious Professor yes I do I have to I am called to do it why is this scripted from you oh very sentence the prophet but who's represent 10 8 to 10. verse 10 18 11. I heard the voice says go to Jacksonville I didn't hear the voice say that go to the angel and give me the book commission seven that might change of relation 10 he gave version 10 7 the book then you ask the angel that book that was open that book that was revealed that book that was unfolded give me the book and John who tied the bride he said I've been come to the angel [Applause] I went oh give the Lord a shout I go to Jacksonville I go to New York I go to London I go to England or Europa Africa I went to the angels and said give me shout out give me shelter give me give me the book [Applause] John type the bride he said I took it I took it I took it and chew it no no no can't find any Bible I took it and use it as gum I suck it like lollipop no I took it and eat it and digest it and as soon as soon as soon as I've eaten it it was my belly as Peter when you stand for this oh God they hate you they hate you without a cause it's bitter because you have to speak the truth it's better because you have to walk alone it's better because you have no support it's better but make money in the mouth sweet sweet as honey in the market sweet it's sweet this morning what a word what a word from a prophet went to the angel but the Bible didn't stop there I have to eat after digest Thomas domas domas prophesy again how could you prophesy if the book [Applause] then the prophecy have to come from the book so every Sunday we prophesying every point every practice I am we are prophesying every service of your deliverance of your pressure of your healing offering finders or glory to God of the quick and power of your adoption every service we are prophesying God will make our way for you the chains that have your bong God be broken we are prophesying your coming of that prison your covered abundant you're coming out of all whatever difficulty have been in every service we prophesying we have their charity we have the anointing God told us the prophesy we are prophesying this morning there's going to be a bright Revival in this church Church in Trinidad okay the Lord a shout there's going to be a mighty old point of the Holy Ghost [Applause] the angel industration which one you have different angels it had angels that come from heaven and injures I'm coming from hell yeah that we call falling there's one stand up right and poop they take on a lion fall and they fall long show don't idiot looking for bodies because they have none wow that's right they have no bodies looking for humans or anything they can get into even disciplined anything they could step into and the spirit of God also looking for Buddies [Music] [Applause] so this message doesn't come to a group I want to remind you of that I know we hear it but somehow it got distracted when they strike the people they recognize their might not passively pulpit as I told you already I have one wife one woman her name is you know my wife when the prophecy you know the Church of the wife is to talk about a certain context what I live in you one wife is on me of it you have to be wife of lamb not Pastor wife wife of the Lamb and the wife of the Lamb will be flesh of his flesh all of his bone love his word of his spirit that's what God wants you oh my God [Music] so there are two systems working listen recluse I want you to see I want to see if you're going to see Amen on this so he's pumpingly he said there are two systems working in tradable today I'm going to get this off my shoulder and I have it over with we all know that's the word of God and the denominational system so a system spirit is what always challenges the word well you know brother so I said he's in it so I don't care he could be sending in your own place what does the word say that is all you can find me a word you'll find it hush him out tell your story walking I don't want to hear you what you're saying in the descriptions what he said we all know that's the word of God and the national system there are two systems at work just as Jacob and Esau won after the spirit the other after the flesh what is it Eastern Jacob are fighting in the womb of the mother even to the time they are born and so is the nominationals and the word fighting won against the other then he says they have been since Luther first brought the First Reformation I'll go back simple enough to understand so in other words God always have an original Sea church but Lucifer have to anoint the flesh church members I must say this way God have a bright Sea church and that bright Sea church is in the church womb and in that church where his two Spirits were Kenyan there's two systems and two Spirits as he's working now if you look at deeper there's two things working in you too wanna feed say if you want to boost the black dog feed him but if you starve him he will die I said stop that dog stop that that woman said myself you know stab that dog [Applause] he said it this way you get the Holy Ghost it's a little light a button coming to you and as you dial to this as you let go this it expands so if you want to sell it I'd like to go sell a little light but if you wanted to take over the whole being you have to get rid of stuff you have to throw out stuff you have to shake off stuff and then that light begins to grow then it can go down to your hands to your feet the anointed of God to your eyes you see like God is here like God more glory to God a real Son of God because that light is not going inside of you that have nothing to do with your father your mother your sister your brother your uncle your aunt or the pastor okay the Lord some praises all glory to God hallelujah that's why I love God's Serenity God can bless you without asking anybody God could forgive you without asking

could climb amen amen many many men notice these systems will not grow watch it cannot what a cockable cannot bring forth a bunch of wheat but they are both in the same field watered by the same water what water Malachi forward three games as he showed where does it take for that Israel Commodore Egypt how much come out wasn't the elect alone Quran data any bunch of them was there all what posts in Egypt who wanted to go back that my students problem come to say let us go back to Egypt that's why God didn't show them because if they touched it landed they're going back they're going back they fall back to base you want people they're doing this doing that God called them when they backside where they're going right back to what did you do right back to the comfort zone right back to Egypt God want to get them to hold that so he take them out of Egypt the challenge is how they get Egypt to them yeah so God gave them a long journey to kind of bunny jump out of them through the Wilderness to weariness getting bread light all the time favorite no licks this time we load this light bread you bake it you ordered it you you you know that Meek but you want you want you want meat you want Quail go drop a whole bunch of Queen oh God this whole strainer God said Moses speak to the Rock Moses all get away Mighty rough Twinkie Rebels he had all showing off your power go to wait we do that for eign but God said this morning speak to the Rock in your wilderness and he will bring forth his Waters or give the Lord some Praises this morning because she said holy spirit [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Rock will bring forth water is so glory to God they are brought in the same field watered by the same water same sunlight one is the word and one is not the word and the two are fighting go glory to God so don't tell me who fight and fight them the other fight I bought the fight but I'm the boat right I'm on the boat right side Hallelujah so who fighted me that the fact that I figured which side they won oh praise the name of the Lord put Abraham you could imagine how you have lived back in those days under the jolting of God's prophets and words that come forward what side would you want to be in Bhatia he said she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word bacteria and the word is coming for a word brain he said I believe that Jesus here was speaking you would have sorrow but your soul shall return to Joy speaking to disciples here knowing that birth of Christianity was coming to existence and the old has to die in order for the new to be born so David Gohan knew that Solomon Ministry was about to start big time to do something Great and Mighty for God in building the Temple God knew that he needed a man that could be negotiation that could negotiate and talk to other people because what Solomon knew was some different countries the material he needed to put the temple together he didn't have all of the deer Ministry you know he in trouble he had mental problems because he don't want to admit that he do have it all so to solve his problem he just surveyed himself and say I'm all five so I don't need nobody else and we don't I'd say we don't need nobody else we are so blessed to have faith in one God gave you a five and one you see God doesn't work that way God make sure we are interdependent and we are dependent on him and we have to recognize that God have other souls and seeds and ministers and preachers and Ministries in the vineyard for the edification of the church so he said you hear from the Apostle you hear from the pastor you hear from the prophet no Apostle come and take over that's some false Apostles looking to take over foreign politicians they're in the wrong post all right now here he said now watch Jesus said you will have sorrow but your soul shall be done to Joy speaking to disciples here knowing that the birth of Christianity was coming to existence no the old has to die in order for the new to born to have anything that gives birth here we go anything that gives birth has to have Pains of distress and they certainly was going through the pain of distress and anguish to get from the Lord to Grace because they had the law it was indoctrinated with the law there was a doctrination with the law of Moses Moses said Moses say Moses and they want to get Jesus to break the law they caught the woman in very Act of adultery and said Moses say this woman we quarter this is live now this is she shall be stoned and they're watching Jesus see how he handled it he said no problem turn this back from them writing his son he said which one among you caused the first stone and let them think about it all of a sudden somebody really think that they had a child to pick up from school next one have rights to pick up next one have to paint and wash his car and next one have to go to the grocery because you know and everybody excuse me uh you know they do like they hear that all them with it which of you without sin they might want to confess this sin they want to acknowledge this sin they're walking with this sin they connect the jacket and they pull it outside when Jesus surveyed there was a woman standing there she didn't even see when they left you say woman where are they an accusers no looking at it not my Lord he's in neither do I condemn thee and he had no sense go and continue sinning because I forgive you did not say that that's not in the Bible he said go and sin no more free yourself from that Oh Glory to God if God free you this night go and sin no more free yourself from the past free yourself from that go on say no more she was free it's not something there all right so the battle there was to get them from law to Greece all right normal natural boot Spirit type spiritual birth we find out on the ground we see tree in the earth growing struggling for life struggling for what that goes to show there's a tree somewhere that doesn't die it's crying for something we find people no matter all how sick what condition they are crying out to live yes I know old people I know God I wouldn't look into that you're not looking for box I look how old they are they want to live and they came to back post whatever it is they want to live we are called to want to live oh Hallelujah now watch he said John 5 7 says they are treated their record in heaven the father of the word the Holy Ghost these three are one they are treatable record on the earth that's water blood and spirit they are green one notice the first three are one the second three are Earthly which are green one you cannot have the father without the sun you're gonna have the sun without having Holy Ghost but you can have water without blood you could have blood without spirit he said you could have blood without spirit so you can have the message without spirit because the message is blood but we are saying the token the seven Thunders the Holy Ghost is spirit that has to come upon the blood Oh Glory to God because the life is in the blood hey glory to God do you see it so man can have the word and no spirit [Applause] prophecy the preaching the letter heavy and the people like decrease like a living dead you had a fish for him and um when they said unto me let us go you know if you're not glad to come here stay home please you have to be glad to come you come in for something [Applause] this isn't this is not for folks and chicken you know this is Eagle stuff we're talking about yeah [Applause] goes in a prophet that sacrifices like to bring her this message I remember the early days when I get a book so you know at one time I kissed the book I couldn't wait to get a book everything was new fresh oh boy when I get who's melchizer when I was off my rockers with that one and when you learn if you don't I mean you have to be careful lending me books you know when you let me know a book just disappeared I was dangerous with books couldn't get enough I couldn't get the next one no people not even reading them I don't want you like that you know right now I think all mushrooms they copied the hundred dollars so they do all this part them bandito then Crooks look how much money they spent to get this done I thought it was you can't it's impossible to copy people could be normal normal ability is a false so you double the difficult a razor edge between right and wrong Razor Edge Oh Glory to God hallelujah yeah you got to know the word you gotta tell the devil is written and you don't know what written foreign say where show me and you see me yeah I mean there's an Unwritten one you never say oh right you we are Partners I just I just catch them anytime I talk about Unwritten the prophet I bring a mission and somebody bring because he want the star what I never hear it so when it is itching to never hear it so I won't hear the same thing it will rain because rain coming judgment coming I want to know how to get in the Rapture how to add them Seven Virtues I am not tired of themselves I'm not tired of seven Thunders but you know we're talking about praise God because there's here every time they pay their change the message that change the quarter change it's still there but one day it will be manifested for 2 000 years they prophesied about messiah messiah messiah messiah Isaiah talk about Messiah every boy of a messiah but one day John the Baptist come down he said there was one standing among you he will baptize you but the Holy Ghost about fire and one day Jesus come walking it was no longer prophecy it was the Fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy he said Behold the Lamb of God all glory to God and the bridge from the prophecy to the prophet was breathed or give the Lord some prison let me see how to wrap up here [Music] [Applause] don't be wary don't be tired don't be aware of these promises you may be seated when God gives the Prophet The Vision with his wife on the other side he said brother Brian let me preach about and talk about you don't know what it is they didn't learn a perfect love yeah they can love to come inside out here you talk about it but you didn't experience it you talk about it but you don't know what this is amen we have no WhatsApp connection to brother remember that's a mystery them going and then make it to the other side all these secrets that were secret them know

God call you at a higher order dead without us are not made perfect God is calling up right to perfection but we have to break out and change from Jacob Grace into jewelry Perfection Glory record is the transition had to take place from the old to the new it just can't be the grace of God and the grace of God you've got to come to walk before me and be not perfect they glory to God how something has to happen something has to unfold [Applause] a woman interview the first thing comes is water normal second thing is blood then come Life water blood spirit that constitute the normal bird and so it is in a spiritual realm it is water justification by feet Believing on God and second is sanification of the spirit God cleanses the spirit from all the elements of the world and the desire of the world then the Holy Spirit comes in and give new boot and fills up that Sanctified vessel the Greek word is sanctifies a compound which means cleansed and set aside for service not just cleansed but set aside for service power coming to put you into service now watch what is them when they become by still but no song no emotion dead baby and sometimes the matter with the church today we got too much stillborn children they need that gospel spanking baby upside down and put a big lash on the baby knowing my college I love you I don't know sustainable kind of all kind of thing no but alas in that baby and the baby ball they ball them big big noise isn't that right and it's all about the breeding Breath of Life into them we find out it's true theology but it's the truth in the seeds birth the old seed must die before the new one can be born therefore death is hard anytime that is what somebody should have had so you are soft dead that is hard dietary own thinking well I feel better to you you should have more so that's your feelings are you gonna die to that you hold on your feelings but you're wrong he should not see you do it so he should do it so guys tell your thoughts you caught up your own emotions they said I was telling them when you're under stress and pressure do talk zip up keep quiet and I was saying that in reference to job's wife who tell him why because God and die she just say that because she she under pressure because if job admired a wicked woman he examined resentment all together in that sense he said those speakers like a foolish woman I know you're not foolish that what he's saying you know I know you're not a foolish woman I know you're under pressure I forgive you I still love you now be caution of precious he said that um but that's the challenge that was presented to the god I will make him curse and his wife was the tool the final the last round the last thing he could get was his wife and that man had the grace on him to see you speak like he's a Christian he's a Believer he was not just member it was actually if it wasn't a Christian let me tell her you Wicked Woman only money again you're driving me car Billy a house look at your no you're gone grateful and Rich I should have never mind the first place and our next Guild Army Road Academia instead look at you now when I've seen pressure foreign oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah that's why I say when you're under pressure when you're under stressed zip up don't say nothing say Lord help me keep my mouth closed because you don't want to say the wrong thing you want to say the right thing oh glory to God do it Go glory to God give the Lord some Praises hope this helping somebody so that is hard at any time that is painful it is distressful and birth is the same you are bringing life into the world and it is painful a woman when she's about to bring forth she had much travail Oh Glory to God she has much sorrow but when she bring forth Joy comes because a man comes to this world and this bride is going through a travail she's going to bring forth the Christ okay the Lord some Praises Messiah gonna be on earth identified Oh Glory to God is a messiah is on earth now that's the Christmas message that's the message the Angels Came to bring her that's the angel so the Angels Came to Herald that the Messiah is on earth now or give the Lord some praises glory to God [Applause] that's the reason was so hard for those Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law and the law was the word of God in form what a powerful quote the law was the word in seed form but when the word was made flesh and become not law but Grace yet a bomb no Grace and law cannot exist at the same time this is beginner you can't have both that's why Jesus could tell her we had an accusers yes go and say no more I release you the Lord say you should be stoned but Grace come and release you from your guilt your past your shame it cannot be bought it cannot be locked up and release at the same time let's continue now Grace and law cannot exist at the same time cause Grace is so far above law law is not even the picture therefore it is so hard for the Pharisees to die to the law so that Grace could be born but it must go the two laws cannot exist at the same time there cannot be a law that say you can run this sick from all and the other one says you can't run it one says you can and you can't it has to be one note at a time maybe one time you could have went to it caution to it but this time it is red stop see there cannot be two laws exist at the same time notice my thought to you is this it takes I want to wrap up it takes pain distress discomfort but it must be so be comfortable being uncomfortable be comfortable that you're going to have stress and distress here we go let's continue we find a rain which brings forth fruit from the earth is born as the poor said in the thieves of thunder in a ragged jacket Skies if we didn't have thunder and and ruggage against Skies the little distilled drop of rain that's been lifted from the Seas and distilled from the salt wouldn't be born it takes lightning thunderblast ragged rugged fearful thing to bring forth this soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring forth birth it takes dying and as the clouds die rain is born because rain is part of that cloud one has to cease so the other one can exist like a little chicken back there you talk about your own inner parts of the egg has to rot away it has to he's saying Kentucky we call it pipping its way out he said pipping his way out they never found a better way it's God's provided we you try to help them you will kill him tip the shell off of him and he will die he's got to

you're in PIP your way out I want you out you'll be out or give the Lord a shout in the house there we go are you ready that's the way a Christian has to do it ain't somebody shaking your hand and taking you in you've got the lady until you die how does this line up with Mysteries how does his line up with all these Revelations and for our services and the people don't know how to die the brain been informed about this message of the hour but the heart has not been informed that they have to die death of a corner wheat what can the Lord I shout in the house you're gonna die have to die

provided way here we go you don't go in by book you're doing by Shake hand you're doing going by joint church and pump up and pull down you just simply have to get away from your old Shell they have

saying you know I mean every word I'm saying I'm a man sent from God you know not from man Hallelujah come from Jacksonville or even brother Branham you understand that my my commission rather come from Jesus he said go into all the world who talking and preach what is a press play he said what preach the gospel to who Every Creature or get the Lord a shout every minute saying Sarah yeah called to preach the gospel if the word I'm preach it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] system dead I have to get a ride ready have to get that bright prepared and they could only be prepared by the word you may be seated I ain't finished yet he said no the thing of it is new boot is born Luther came forth with the word to just only my feet he could no longer cling to the old system he had to come out of it say holding on to Jacob because you have a pressure to go to Joseph Joseph perfection is a full word so yeah coming up with Pentecostal atmosphere of the message into a perfect word where you walk before god is perfect under the blood you're not you're not good today I'm not good tomorrow you're not safe that they are unsafe tomorrow that's Jacob Grace praise God you're good today why are you going he had struggling nah I Jacob when they're coming to Joseph you're in God's will in God's plan in God's program praise God you are predestinated you are elected no devil could rub you praise God you're saved Hallelujah praying you're not trying to be saved we'll give the Lord some Praises he said back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have a life it is God's word has life the system is built around the life they build system around in this message I'm going to posture it Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God there we go this is where I want to get to he was God's word made manifest all right in order to pay the debt of your hybriden there it is what is it that you could die to yourself top brother over it I mean this isn't a message that we have to die to ourselves you mean this is the word you mean this is a mystery hidden one because you'll hear about it right so but you bringing a kitten issue this morning this one was sealed we're unsealing it after this this is one of the biggest mysteries to drink out of there watch this died in order to pay the debt of your hybriden that you could die yourself until you are no more yourself and be filled with his word believe in his word then the holy spirit that was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow and then the Holy Spirit wasn't him comes down to water that will to make it grow then what is it God manifested continuing the work of his full son his only begotten that died for our hybridian life that he might reconcile us back here it is to be Sons and Daughters of God here why that through the church might flow the same life by the word continuing the work being manifested that was in Christ what did the spirit of the Prophet by and through the bride will be fulfilled all because Jesus didn't finish his work so he's going to do it by and through the bride the secret is the word is in the bride she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with the world in other words she have the intelligence to tell her what to do with the word she don't need an outside force she don't need an outside group she don't need a headquarters Church she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word isn't that right no other life can work in her no other life had broken her she can't come to life no other way it will take the Holy Ghost itself the Holy Ghost itself in other words the Capstone the Dynamics praise God the Capstone word the Capstone of love praise God hallelujah it will take that stone to come and power that bride Oh Glory to God let's go he died and give his life that he might send the spirit and take his body up and send the spirit back to water to pay the redeeming price and he that believeth on me the works that I do then come the Holy Spirit the same word of God we're almost done here now here we go the Bible has got to be in you the book cannot be on top your desk a book cannot be in your hand or in your back pocket or on your phone the Bible has to be coming you but there are three Bibles to zodiac the physical Bible and that pyramid so he is saying that pyramid that Bible has to be inside of you they find that in second Peter 1 4-7 after your faith virtue that's the battle and to put your knowledge that's the Bible hunting all his Temperance not the Bible Hallelujah Temperance patience and godliness and bodily kindness is not right and when you have them by that Bible in you you have Seven Ages you have seven messages you have seven voices you have seven pandas hey oh oh this Bible got to be in you how as I said let's finish here now watch watch the Bible's got to be in you the wood is a seed as long as laying here it won't do nothing we can press play we can listen you can put all your spoken books on embarrassing in your head sleep with it it will do nothing until what when it comes in here in the heart when it comes in the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God then Vision come power comes humility come what come vision power humility all you know it all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives hallelujah hallelujah he died I live when I die he lives again okay the Lord I shall do you want to see Jesus die Oh Glory to God when I die he lives again when I die he promised me life I die out to myself hear these words I die out to myself so in order I can have his life how do I do it by taking his word his Cedar put the seed in here by faith believe it then it produces exactly what the Bible said remember we cannot live by yesterday's light yesterday light is gone it is no more we cannot live by yesterday's light He said Each Day brings on strength a little stronger to ripen the green for the Harvest Oh Glory to God you need light to brighten the green for the Harvest the Sun comes out it gets a little stronger each day it gets a little stronger a little stronger until finally here we go the wheat that's laying there it will go to taking life oh that's beautiful I love that I love that terminology the seed inside of you but one day maybe today that seed inside of you could quote the taking on life all of a sudden something quickly inside of you and that seed began to come alive inside of you one day there's a prophecy hanging over you that that seed will go to take on life oh praise God this is sea time when the sea began to take on life isn't that right oh my let me close um here we go are you ready Jesus did the works of his father because the father wasn't him that is why the works was done because the father was in the sun do you believe that he was incarnate God do you believe that that God the Father which was in the father of Jesus the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in Jesus Christ now what the Bible says the world was invisible now here we go the word was invisible until in his mid flesh then the wood becomes visible he had a bum hear what concerns you and I know true is sacrificial in a Calvary and his resurrection positionally plays his church in that Realm that the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the world visible oh I wish my church could get that if you could see friends this visible made visible how we do it through Caravan Resurrection he put the church in a position if we doubt ourselves we could see Jesus manifested without one floor that's not just for you that's me for us to see Jesus T don't have to die it doesn't matter what people say about me till you still have to die people don't like me that have nothing to do with it not not wanted alive or dead you know wanted dead man yeah you did another life you know Paul said I die my children whom my traveling but till Christ be formed in me Paul was dying to bring life to God's people I've always wanted to come to a church I've longed to see it I could walk in the back door front or wherever it was look across the audience and a perfect Church [Music] the spirit would call it out like a NASA is a fire out you just couldn't do it there'd be no sin in that group see the spirit will speak quickly see women men sitting there under the power of the Holy Spirit not power Mysteries talking foreign Spirit moving perfectly moving someone done something wrong on the congregation they would come quickly and confess it before they sprinkle the whole of it to come and tell it because you know it's going to be called that's the Church of the Living God all my old poor heart is getting old I've long the standards here she's like that and yet I hope to perfect works of God without sin now that could understand you see Church the word was invisible until it was made flesh and at Calvary a burial Resurrection the position only placed the church in that Realm there's got to be a debt a debt to self in this hour brother when we wonder what's the matter with our Revival what's the matter we got the material everything we got the mechanics but where's the Dynamics that's what we need to move Jesus on the scene I tell you there is one here today called the holy ghost that can touch the Dynamics he is the Dynamics of the mechanics imagine the Holy Ghost says We Stand today his Pentecostal one of the greatest churches in the nation thousand times thousands added each year but where is that Holy Ghost it's the word it's the word turn on the light turns on the mechanics and they begin Dynamics their Dynamics when the dynamic comes to the mechanic it start to think ruling take the word if there's only one little thing missed up it won't start lay aside every weight every ISM every Creed that the Dynamics the Holy Spirit might flow through the word and vindicate the promise what God Said Moses look one day he seen the pillar fire it attracted his attention the great Theologian he was to deliver the children of Israel and although his mother totally instructed him watch this on what to do what he would do what God arisma for all that was knowledge as good as it is all this knowledge as good as it is and it is good yet it had to be set off that was only mechanics so Moses head couldn't take him to fulfill the promise mechanics ain't what runs the automobile it's dynamics that runs the mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into his word the Holy Ghost will always point you to the word oh my let me hit the whole church here now he is the Dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it you no longer hear this good I'll be there so much let's come fresh the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets they don't want that now and they they don't even passes now they want us to stop preaching they want us to go foreign controlled by overseas watch the mechanics of the church could imagine is apostles it's teachers and so forth and he is the dynamic that works that [Applause] so anytime go come behind me thanks mechanics and the Dynamics you're seeing how that will work that and if God work in that now and we broke known piece of mechanics much is when God said things in order if right now God right in US and we broke down mechanic state wait till everything lying upon lying upon line we till the juice and the oil praise God without oil start to run that engine and running all them bolts and joints and whatnot the church running smooth praise not a devil moved till we say so we'll give the Lord some Praises he is the dynamic that works that it's worked by a certain dynamic or glory to God hallelujah praise God last court are you ready if you don't cut the work short he cut the workforce for the election but therefore the election he gonna cut it short now where are we at we see Nations breaking children's awaken the sign Israel Awakening the signs that this Bible wrote over this day we see the mechanical take taken place now the spirit here we go the Dynamics of that promised word to get into the church and Jive them into Calvary and turn into the Rapture so praise God praise God praise God the first title I had for that is Dynamics driven Calvary Hallelujah the Dynamics have to drive us to Calvary may God send the Dynamics today in Jesus name that drives you to your cross to drive you to die to yourself the childhood that Christ could come alive let's understand and give God some Praises father God I thank
