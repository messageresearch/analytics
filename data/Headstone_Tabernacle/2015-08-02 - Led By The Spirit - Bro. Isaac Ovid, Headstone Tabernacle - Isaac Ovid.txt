refreshed that you go and fight again and press again oh praise God greetings in Jesus name and God bless you we're looking forward for God to speak to our hearts this day every service is important Thursday in canopia up here Wednesday in Deo Martin is important every service is important because you come to get a word from the Lord I'm sorry there's no self-help kit for your breakthrough and deliverance you can't fix yourself in that sense God have a plan and a road map to take you from one spot to another spot you got to walk on that road you got to get that map you got to get in God's plan and program if you have to get where you're supposed to uh where you have the destination as it was there's no self-help thing where you're going to fix yourself and cure yourself and do this for yourself and no it doesn't come that way there's a mind of God for every situation for every problem and every condition there's a mind of God for your home life your family life your own life there's a mind of God for that you have your own mind and God said it this way my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways isn't that right so we are not we are here to push aside our own thoughts to look for the thoughts of God to drop down among usen Hal how many believe that this morning we are looking for the intelligence of God to drop down to speak to Heart isn't right sometime back we spoke about the Thornes tied up and choked up by the cares of this world and bring forth no fruit to Perfection tied up it's a world where it's busy everybody have something to do everybody has some place to go but yet there's a word from the Lord how it wasn't days a Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man amen amen where there'll be an elected Bunch where there'll be a make believing bunch where there'll be the sodomite Bunch as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man where do you stand today you better be among that elected Bunch called by God elected by God Sodom was finished isn't that right Hallelujah but the people didn't know it sodam was already judged but he was waiting for to be sentenced and people don't even know it they're being marked right now you're being marked right now by the word marked by your attitude by your SP Spirit isn't that right to what's what being spoken to you by the word that's coming to you we are not here to entertain you we're not here for performance we're here to give you the word of the Lord that is what the sons of God are here for to bring the word because the Bible prophesy in the last day there'll be a famine not for books and tapes not for ministers and preachers but for the hearing of the true word of God are they going to run to the East and the west and the North and the South why would the Bible prophesy of famine in the last days if we have so much Bibles so much churches so much preachers why would the Bible prophesy that there will be a famal last days hallelujah because the word have to come present tense to bring the Breakthrough for the people so I want to read a scripture from Joel it says here this is Joel be not afraid he beast of the field he pass the wildness through spring for the tree bear of fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield a strength Hallelujah be then he glad be be glad then he CH of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given to you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain the first month so first God speak to the field isn't that right he said is that right the GL going to be rejoicing isn't that right and the flow shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Lucas had eaten the cankerworm the C pillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and he shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that DWS wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and they shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel that I'm the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and in Revelation 10:8 says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me down must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongs and Kings may God bless his word oh could we give the Lord some Praises this morning oh hallelujah praise God Amen praise God so you will see some changes you will see some differences because we are still setting the church in order what is out of order will come in order what is good and right we'll keep what is off we will throw out so you're going to see some drastic things done here because we are preparing for a Revival we preparing for power we preparing for Dynamics you have to be a people prepared but today just before the speaker comes to us I want to just share something with you about being restored and the prophet preach a message called the restoration of the brid tree and he give a definition of restore meanings to return to the former owner or return back to the former estate or condition am and he went on to say to bring back to the former owner and if a claim is made on something to make a restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place so he is saying here that once there's a promise of restoration you can enforce a claim to be restored isn't that something do you believe that this morning so we can enforce a claim to be restored that means as a church we could enforce a claim to be restored back to the days of the Apostles that is our right and God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers a church where sin can't even stay in it a church that sin can't even walk into it a different kind of church isn't that right do you believe that so he saying now watch he said no watch to restore means to bring back to restore a claim can be restored to bring anything back to it rightful owner therefore some way it went away from its rifle owner and to restore it to bring it back to who really owns it in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce C this rightful condition of restoration like if somebody stole a property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and then enforce this person to restore this property back then we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his law is his word and God in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to enforce these claims upon Satan and said give it back the law of the land is to enforce by the land for the land but the law here we go of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women he took children sicknesses of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them so I want to say this morning that you have a right to be restored if you're sick you have a right to be restored back to good health and strength if you lose your desire you lose your prayer life you need a breakthrough that's your right if you bong you have a right to be delivered that is your right hallelujah hallelujah that is your right for Revival that's your right to have a passion to know the word a hungering and thirst that's your right to be a genuine Christian come on say Amen somebody you don't have to be halfway Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh Hallelujah you may be seated W beong with you brother brandham says God Don't Make halfway Christians God Don't Make halfway ministers God Don't Make halfway preachers but preachers can be halfway oh Christians can be halfway but God don't make that when God tell a man see he his eyes open up Hallelujah when God say here his air open up God don't do any halfway job isn't that right when God said delivered you are delivered when God say free you are free Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah we don't want the kind of Freedom like those guys that broke out of prison and some got free for what half an hour got killed another got free from for 2 three hours and and another got free for 2 days and had to take them back you don't want that kind of Freedom where the devil is behind your back where the devil have a right to take you back into the prison that you once was in you don't want that kind of Freedom you want who the son of man set free is free indeed that there is no way that devil could pull you back in the prison that you were in that is why you come to church that the Holy Spirit could break the fets off of your life oh could we give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen you may be seated if we are looking for total Deliverance total freedom total Liberty total Jubilee we have to agree on the word that word is God not the church is God not the minister is God not the Elder is God we have to agree that the word is God and all of us have to subject ourselves to that word because the word itself is God hallelujah that is why when God came down for Adam he said where are thou he said I'm hiding why he was he hiding because Adam fell from the word hallelujah because sin is what make people hide that's right to cover up Amen to hide it up amen isn't that right praise God but when you understand that God come to shine light amen Oh Glory to God to bring out the darkness out of your life he come to make it more dark he come to bring a light when that light shine it will show every cockroach it will show every rat it will show every whatever in your life it will expose what in your life when the light come the light come to bring light to your [Applause] life Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so we want that full commitment to what God Said not what this sister do because that sister could be off the word what God Said not what this brother do because he could be Plum off the word what God Said then your measurement is not brother or a sister your measurement is the word what was spoken by a prophet he was one of the eyes of the Lord Seven eyes going out throughout the Earth hallelujah hallelujah seven eyes to see and he saw every sin in the age and he put it in the books and tapes to expose it that we could be delivered from every sin every condition every situation Oh Glory to God and call us to preach the word regardless of the people's feelings regardless of their emotions regardless if they want to stay in a church or leave the church the commission is to preach the word oh Hallelujah to stay by the word Deacon on no Deacon elder or no Elder minister or no minister to stay with the word because the word is God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] so you're going to see some changes you have a right to enforce that means if it's sick you could en forc to be healed amen you could en Force God I want my healing I want my break I come you see if you have no expectation you get what you get and that's the problem people just come and just get things because there's no creative expectation in their spirit and their soul the woman said if I could just touch the Helm of His Garment oh oh my Hallelujah blind Bima said Lord help me help me and Jesus was way away from him and somebody said you're making too much an noise Lord help me he didn't bother with who was talking because he had such a great need in his spirit in his soul it doesn't matter who voice say negative Lord help me they said Jesus not even nearby he can't hear you but that didn't stop blind butas I'm crying up and that's when somebody is desperate that's when somebody really getting down to business and serious they don't care who sit next to them who is in front of them they want to get it straight they want to get it right they want to get their need Supply from God oh give the Lord a shout friendsall we have to come down to specifics am a lot of people like General but God has come to specifics notice when blind bimus cried out the faith hit God God hit Jesus and Jesus came to him and Jesus didn't come and just lay hands upon him and say see because everybody could know the man is blind if a stick everybody know he's blind but Jesus ask a question what is it that you want me to do for you suppose blind but must want a million dollars and a home for the blind hallu if Jesus is to come this morning and ask you what is it that you want me to do for you do you have an answer for him that connects with what is in your heart Hallelujah that connects with what is in your spirit hallelujah hallelujah alah because the voice told John not to beg for the book not to cry for the book The Voice told John go on take take take it take it take it take it because the lamb died for it the lamb brought it down the lamb give it to a prophet he put it there no Bishop could hold it back from you no no God not to some man God to the angel and say give me the book in other words you have a right come on now come on now maybe you never see that way you have a right to that book hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated it didn't say the preacher have to get the book John represented the bride and the voice told John go to the angel it said who to go to not go to this church go to that church go to that Bishop go to that man go to the Angel and the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word so once you get to the angel you can get the book oh could we say Amen somebody I'm almost done get to the angel get to the book the book have an effect amen hallelujah Pleasure and Pain hallelujah hallelujah glory to God like but ULU preach the book have an effect Pleasure and Pain but you know what the Bible says the Bible called the pain first it's going to be bit in your belly but it going to be sweet in your mouth when you like to talk about it when you like to Fellowship about it when you like to speak it back it sweeten them out but when you have to stand alone stand against your family and friends when you have to stand for what is right when it come down to the Cuts that's where it's bitter when you have to tell the people the truth that's when it's bitter but you ministers here tell them the truth Oh Glory to God hallelujah only the truth which is the [Applause] word then the effect of it is don't must prophesy again prophesy prophesy prophesy why prophesy Hallelujah when it's fulfilled you what to prophesy after 25 years Abra did not prophesy anymore Isaac was born he said this is that that I spoke about for the last 25 years it's fulfilled but God put the prophecy to do two things to give the critics something to talk about and to give the man who received the faith a means of character development a mean of growth and maturity which only the trial of your faith can produce nothing else could produce that so when God give a word he gave a time to that word within that time he test to see if you really believe if you truly believe if you're hanging in there regardless and the Bible said Abraham tagger not at the promise of God to unbelief but was strong giv praise to God so Joel said it shall come to pass that young men shall see Visions it shall come to pass that the spirit will bring prophecy again you you have to prophesy that you're going to get a breakthrough today you have to prophesy that you're going to get a Revival today you have to prophesy that you're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost you have to prophesy could we stand and give God a praise offering oh the bride going to prophesy and you going to prophesy Oh Glory to God you're going to hear a word from the Lord this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God I need oh I [Music] [Applause] need I [Music] need oh bless me now my S [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah come [Music] to oh I need the I need the every hour every hour I need he hallelujah oh bless me now my saor I come to the let's just sing it one more time every hand raised every eye closed Hallelujah I need the I need is this your prayer this morning every hour I need the hallelujah oh bless me now my [Music] saor I come [Music] to keep playing softly Hallelujah Heavenly Father we feel your presence in this place Lord and we cry to you this morning of how much we need you yes Lord is not a want it is not Lord a frivolous desire but it is a need Lord we need you like we need to breathe we need you like Lord without Lord you we have no life we have no strength we have no purpose we are like a ship without a sale Lord I pray this morning that you would speak to your people who have come from the east from the west from the north from the south Lord under expectation for a touch from you Lord we are needy people Lord may you bless the reading of the word may you open the understanding of your people to Lord the time that we are in the the the the graveness the seriousness the the the the the critical time of the moment that this hour that we are in Lord where Lord as the last ticking of that clock of time Fades into eternity father when we break in that kind of a way from the humanistic realm into Revelation divine Revelation and into Vision this morning Father a vision of Revival a vision of an outpouring may you speak to us out of your word may you take me completely out of the way and speak lip to ear to your people may you bless everyone that's here this morning those that are connected on the internet and may you be with us in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen you may be seated for a few minutes you can keep playing softly you know I was there listening about over speak your appreciate brother over this morning and my mind is blown because just before he started to sing I asked Gideon what key is he in because this is the very same song I wanted to sing when I got up here and he started to singing Because I realize that if your prayer your desire is not I need thee then you have the wrong desire that is my prayer this morning Lord I need thee more than yesterday more than last week more than last month more than last year but this morning Lord I need thee amen you know when I had two different thoughts for this morning and I just feel this morning is a unique day because I had a thought and a brother from another church sent out a quote from the Prophet this morning with the exact same title pretty much that I was going to speak this morning and I was like how could he be connected to the same not so much how but the fact that he is is just such a confirmation of the season and the hour that we are in so I really want to encourage you this morning that as bovit said things are going to be different because we have not passed this way before and when you haven't passed somewhere before everything is new everything is different if you drive down the road on your way home you have seen almost everything before but when you are on a journey when you are seeing all new things you need to walk a certain way because you have not been there before and when you have not been there before you have to depend on leadership because you haven't been there before you can't walk the same way you walked when you haven't been there before because you don't know what lays ahead and if you don't know what lays ahead brother brandom said we ought to be so reverent so careful and I don't know how the service is going to go this morning but it's one of them kind of services I feel it already because there are people in here this morning that I know about who are trapped who are tied up and my desire is to see the chains and the shackles broken we have a responsibility and obligation to preach the word with such Clarity and to bring back what I call Holy fear because people are in church and they don't fear God that's why you do the foolishness sometimes that you do because there is no fear of [Music] God the Bible says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of the beginning of wisdom that's where wisdom starts so the wisdom of this world and the wisdom of coming to church and the wisdom of being in the message all of that falls down if there is no fear of God because if you fear God you would walk reverently you would be so careful in what you do can the church say Amen how many appreciate brother Anthony for his message last week so I'm going to talk to you a little bit this morning I'm going to preach to you a little bit this morning but I'm depending completely and totally on the Holy Spirit to direct what takes place this morning because we have not been this way before you appreciate the musicians you appreciate the singing this morning well can we stand to our feet I want to appreciate brother the over for the opportunity to speak this morning we're going to go to one scripture this morning from The Book of Romans we're going to read Romans chapter 8 and we're going to read from verse one and we're going to take our time a little bit this morning reading from Romans 8 a reading from verse one there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh amen and here is why that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be I want to say that again the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed cannot be in other words it could never subject itself so if that is the case Paul says so then they that in are in the flesh cannot please God I want to say that again so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye and not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be and this is the condition that the spirit of God dwell in you amen now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his so here is Paul makes it very clear If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is now dead because of sin but the spirit of Life the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then is is of God and joined ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads once more Heavenly Father any man could read the scripture but it takes the Holy Spirit to bring it to life may you speak to your people this morning Lord walk out the pages of the Bible and set your people free this morning take me out of the way completely and deliver your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says am and the church says amen amen you may be seated this morning so I have a title this morning and my title is led by the spirit Hallelujah and my subject the Holy Spirit the comforter the guide and my inspiration we have not passed this way before can the church say Amen so this morning we're going to start in Genesis because brother bandam taught us the two books in the Bible that the devil hates the most at Genesis and Revelation because Genesis is where it all began and Revelation defines where it all ends but to understand the root cause of a problem you have to go back to the beginning so we're going to go back to Genesis for a few minutes this morning where in Genesis 1 and in Genesis 2 God is beginning the creation process he's putting things in place he said let there be light and let there be animals and let there be everything trees and everything everything the fish and everything and man is created in Genesis 1 and 2 first the spirit man and then the flesh man and man is in the image of God and that man is led by the spirit that man doesn't know anything about the flesh that man doesn't know anything about lust and Temptation and headaches and being up and he doesn't know anything about that he is led by the spirit his every desire is Con is is controlled by the spirit his every motive is controlled by the holy spirit because he is made in the image of these Spirits because God is a spirit and that great spirit says let us make man in our image so that man could not have gone against God in that form because he was just like his father can the church say amen so that man in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 he couldn't make a mistake he couldn't get depressed he didn't know what it was to be frustrated everything was in order and God the Bible said he was pleased he was pleased with the trees he was pleased with where the sun was he was pleased where the stars was he was pleased by the fact that Adam couldn't get sick he was pleased by the fact that Adam was just like him he was happy because when he come down to talk to Adam Adam wanted to talk to him he was pleased the animals did what they were supposed to do the fishes did what they were supposed to do there was no conflict there was no confusion there was nothing out of order everything was in order because God is a god of order he's a god of structure he's a god of systems and the closer you get to God the more in order your life becomes the less chaos you're going to have in your life when you get closer to God somebody say amen hallelujah everything everything is in order and God decides to operate as a surgeon he I believe it's an anesthesiologist you call it the one who puts you to sleep and make sure there's no pain and the great anesthesiologist puts Adam to ped and puts him to rest and gives him an injection so he feels nothing and from Adam God becomes the first surgeon the first surgery ever created God Cuts Adam open and and extracts a rib and from that rib God in morph he changed himself again as the great Builder and out of man he puts a woman and the two as one in Genesis 1 and two God creates the first institution the first company called marriage and he said who God joined together let no man put a son up Genesis 1 Genesis 2 there is no problem you can't find an issue there's no argument Adam do have to go and argue with Eve and wonder what Eve is doing Eve is in order Adam is in order God speaks to Adam Adam sh it with Eve there's no confusion there's no disrespect Adam loves his wife Eve respects can the church say amen I don't hear you this morning we're going back to beginning that's why the devil hates Genesis because when when we go back to Genesis there's no room for man there's no room for interpretation it's just God and Adam listen you may be seated Adam didn't name himself God called him Adam in other words name in is part of relationship so because God knew who he was God say Adam listen everything starts right there and when god named him even though God knew in the back part of his mind what was going to happen you cannot separate a father from his son you cannot break you cannot break you cannot break the relationship between Father and Son and I don't care what you went through this week last week last month that relationship you have a name there's a name that that you have you don't know it yet but you come from God you come from God made in the image of God this has nothing to do with man this has nothing to do with church this is you and your father this is you and your father you couldn't come here this morning unless your father draw you here you were led by the spirit you were led by the spirit I can't hear you this morning you were led by the spirit if the spirit didn't lead you you couldn't be here this morning because no could come unless the father draws him and God the father he's a spirit and he is here this morning you can see him with your eyes but the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel and he's calling this morning come out of sin come out of lust come out of depression come out of your frustration come out of what you in Hallelujah I'm just laying a foundation Hall I want to be led by the Holy Spirit I have some notes here but I'm very willing to come off of my notes because he's the one who's driving the car I'm in the passenger seat this morning I want Jesus to take the wheel I want him to drive me where we need to go because he has been this way before because he has made every way I have not been this way before but if Jesus is in the drive a seat I don't care where this car goes if Jesus is driving I could sleep in the car you know there are some people when they driving you can't risk falling asleep because you know they're not too good of a driver but if Jesus is driving the car I'm taking my seat all the way back because he's been this way before he felt what we felt he was tempted like we were tempted he was bruised he knows your pain he knows your struggle there's nothing you go through that he can't ident identify with and he didn't sin because he was the second [Applause] Adam Hallelujah you may be seated I'm still trying to warm up here I done jumped all over my notes already I reach the second Adam and I'm trying to speak about the first [Applause] [Music] one so in Genesis 1 and 2 man is in the image of God hallelujah when he looked in the mirror I don't know what kind of mirror he had but maybe he looked in the lake and when he looked he saw something he say I look like my father Hallelujah in the image of God you couldn't tell the difference between him and his father because he was a chip off the old block they had relationship they had Fellowship they had communion but AB Bram used the words Divine Fellowship that's a different kind of relationship that's not a hell how you going kind of friendship but that's in the cool of the evening God would come down and he would have communion with Adam it wasn't on a Sunday only it wasn't Wednesday night only it wasn't Thursday night only but every day at a certain time God himself would come down because God was alone and he wanted fellowship and Adam existed as an amateur God to have that fellowship with God because God has certain thoughts and a thought once it express becomes words but there was nobody to hear the words so God had to create somebody that he could speak to and that's what he's doing this morning he's speaking to somebody because God don't want to talk in a room by himself he's to give us somebody who's looking for a [Applause] [Music] [Applause] relationship you may be seated led by the spirit there was never a time where Adam felt like you know what this evening I don't think I want to talk to God no there was never a time where Adam say well this evening I don't talk to him yesterday I talked to him the day before I think I'm going to go out with e this evening and we going to cut some coconuts and we going to have our own little private dinner no because he was led by the spirit it was normal for Adam to make it his business to be available so when he heard the voice walking in the garden he could say Lord here I am I've been looking for you too because this is what I did this this morning and this is what I did today and this stream was coming here but when I took a selfie with the stream I wanted to move it a little bit this way and I move the stream and I wanted a lion on the backdrop and I wanted a giraffe next to him and a sheep right there and they had Fellowship but then something happened Genesis 3 something Hallelujah takes place Hallelujah and the Bible talks about the serpent being the most subtle and you know it but this is the part I want to get to because the fellowship the communion the desire you know how much of an effort it is for you to come here this morning how much of a struggle it is for you to just to wake up in the morning you are a problem for the devil just to wake up you know when you wake up it's like oh gosh and for you to make it a service this morning all hell is against you amen the devil send drivers with bad drives he sent all kind of problems to make sure you get here as upset as possible and you can't receive anything but when you're in the spirit all of a sudden things open up to you and Adam knew what it was to be in the spirit Hallelujah but then one day he comes home and Hallelujah Eve is not in position and Adam fell and the Bible say and this is the one of the most heartbreaking scriptures in the Book of Genesis and they heard the voice voice they heard the voice of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and this is Adam's response I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid this is the first time the word fear is found in scripture all the time in Genesis 1 and 2 there is no fear there is just communion but all of a sudden Adam say I heard your voice and it didn't feel the same way I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and I was as I was reading this and I shared this in Deo mountain and in canopia that sentence is so powerful Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord you would expect if something goes wrong in your life you would run towards the presence of God but this was not the case but AB Bram said it should have been Adam saying Lord Lord Where Art Thou but here it is God is hunting for Adam because Adam because because of his sin is now afraid the Shina Glory which covered him is no longer there because he had just broken the Covenant amen with God amen amen and his nakedness that exposure that feeling of doing something that was wrong led him to go and hide and God is now on to hunt for him that hunt friends is not Adam's physical location God wasn't trying to get a GPS tracker to figure out where Adam was the question was Adam where are you in spirit that's right Adam where are you because the last time we spoke this is not how you were acting Adam where are you this morning because you're usually in your prayer closet but I didn't hear anything from you Adam where are you where are you at Adam maybe your friends know where you're at maybe your neighbor know where at Eve certainly knows where at go you're hiding together but I'm looking for you Adam Adam where are you this morning I want you to picture it Adam who is an amateur God who had all his power all of a sudden he feels stripped he feels naked he feels exposed the joy he once felt he no longer feels and he's now hiding in the trees hiding in a place that he doesn't want to be seen and and I say today there are people who are hiding from church and hiding in church hiding out that's right because their life is not in order hiding out because something is wrong and God is screaming out the same cry that he said back then Adam wear down this morning you're not where you are supposed to be spiritually you're supposed to be in Authority you're supposed to be on fire you're supposed to be prayed up you're supposed to be desperate you're supposed to be under the anointing of the Holy Spirit you're supposed to be led by the spirit because the Holy Spirit wouldn't lead you to From Me Adam where are you this [Applause] morning friends Adam was afraid Adam was hiding and he was hiding because he didn't know something he was hiding because he really thought his life was over he was hiding because he felt bad about what happened in his life and you know what brother brandham said people lose the sensitivity to the holy Holy Spirit there's something wrong with your Christian Journey if you find yourself doing the wrong things and you don't feel bad about [Applause] it Adam fell and he felt so bad he went and hide because he knew that his condition wasn't fit to even be in the presence of God he had been wrapped in the Shina Glory but the sin of his mistakes had broken the relation relationship and he wasn't free that's why when you see people come to church and they can't shout and they can't worship you're not free I don't care what you tell me how much books you read if you can't worship there's no Freedom Hallelujah and if you are not free God is crying out Adam where are you this morning because there's stuff in your life that got to be dealt with so that we can reestablish communication and reestablish Fellowship because God always wanted Fellowship somebody say Amen hallelujah hallelujah Adam is hiding and God is looking the voice of God walking through the garden and Adam don't know how to respond and butam brought it so beautifully he said that Adam didn't even know there was Grace for his situation because he had not been that way before he didn't he didn't know that there was a provision made for him before the foundation of the world the voice of God was walking through the garden and listen God is a god of judgment but on that day that that judgment seat blood was splashed on the Judgment seat that Adam knew nothing about Adam didn't know that there was Grace for his situation Adam did not know that he could come out of hiding Adam didn't realize that the blood the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before you may be seated understand this God operates on a need to know basis there are some things you don't need to know but when you need to know it that's when he reveals it Luther only needed to know the J shall live by faith he wasn't he didn't have the security clearance to know anything more than that but when Wesley came he had to know what Luther knew and his security clearance was a little higher and he said listen sanctify yourself and the Pentecostals they got to know a little more and by the pum he brought a whole scroll to reveal the whole Revelation the whole mystery that there's blood on the mercy seat for your problems there's blood on the mercy seat and this morning there's power in the blood there's power in the blood there's power in the blood there's power in the blood you may be seated you may be seated oh somebody's going to go free this morning Hallelujah I'm not talking about power in the church I'm not talking about power in the preacher I'm not here to present a Ministry to you I'm here to present the blood because if it wasn't for the blood you wouldn't be here this morning I wouldn't be here this morning there's power in the blood for your son there's power in the blood for your situation there's power in the blood for your fornication there's power in the blood for your adultery there's power in the blood and this blood will never lose its power it's because of the blood you could be healed it's because of the blood you could be delivered it's because of the blood you can lift your hands it's not because of you you are in hiding like Adam was in hiding but God was saying Adam Adam where are you you don't know that there's blood for you now I'm letting you know you didn't need to know it before but this morning there's a mercy seat I brought grace to you I brought Mercy to you I he hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah friends it's a judgment seat the moment you mess up the moment you make a mistake it's a judgment seat because every action has a consequence you don't play with God that's why I say there's no Godly fear God could kill you for coming in here with unconfessed sin butam said don't walk into a prayer line if there's sin in your life because God can strike you dead it's a judgment seat but there's blood there is blood Splash on the on the Judgment seat which makes it a mercy seat and we are under Mercy this morning there's Mercy for you there's Mercy for your family without this Mercy you don't stand a [Applause] chance hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so you could come out of hiding this morning you could come out to be identified God felt so hurt here it is he's looking for his son he's looking for his son in his usual position he looking for his son in his usual state but his son because of guilt because of shame because of condemnation didn't feel comfortable to worship to communicate to fellowship and whenever you feel your prayer life is under pressure and you can talk and you can worship and you can express it means there's something that's been uncovered but if you get the shikina glory to come over you again and if you could plead the blood on your house and plead the blood on your life you could now reconnect the phone because Jesus he didn't disconnect the phone line we are the ones who disconnect the lines but there's blood tonight to repair the line there's blood to repair the communication because I see the blood I'm going to pass over your problem I'm going to pass over your sin I should have killed you a long time but there's blood this morning and when I look to the blood I see you as a Revival group I see you on the way to the Rapture I see you on the way to the resurrection if there was no blood you wouldn't make it but when I look through the blood there's a possibility there is a possibility there's a [Applause] possibility [Music] huah Hallelujah Power in the Blood Power in the Blood people in the message they don't know about the blood people in the message forget about Jesus they're so caught up in Doctrine and teachings and and I something came to me in the car coming up the more Revelation you get the simpler everything becomes I say that again the more Revelation you get the simpler everything becomes because God doesn't need you to have a degree to understand his majesty he doesn't need you to be educated to know that he loves you you don't need to be able to write your name to know that he died for you if you could just get a revelation that you were facing judgment but then mercy said no what is your name can you write it I can't write my name but Mercy said no your honor I don't know I don't know I don't know how to do anything but Mercy is speaking on my behalf this morning and you got to let me go because Mercy said Mercy said Mercy said Mercy [Applause] said I challenge you this morning God is not going to lose one he's not going to lose one he's not going to lose one so you mother hold on he's not going to lose one your son is coming you're not going to lose one your daughter is coming you're not going to lose one he's not going to lose one your child your husband hband they are coming he's not going to lose one there's blood for them too there's blood for them [Applause] too hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated Power in the Blood So Adam on his way to recovery on his road to recovery here it is now God is now painting a picture as the tapestry of time is being weaved out and here it is Abel gets a revelation both Kan and Abel are religious they're both in the church they both know that a sacrifice has to be made they both know that you have to worship because we are made to Worship You worship something you worship your job your car your money you worship a chury pastor but you me to worship something but here it is Cain is coming and he has his Revelation listen people have all kinds of Revelation Kane had his own unique Revelation and he brought the best he didn't bring no bad fruits there being no bad orange and bad apple he took the best he had but he missed the Revelation and here it is Abel Abel had a revelation of the blood and Abel looked all messed up Abel come dragging just one little lamb it didn't look too pretty it didn't look all right and Abel tooked A Little Rock and he just slid the troat and the blood Splash Kane looked at his own Abel looked at his own but God said Abel you have a revelation that you can't even worship me unless you come through the blood you may be [Applause] seated why are you saying all of this brother is because there's no condemnation for them that walk after the spirit the devil wants you to come in here with condemnation and the guilt and shame of your past and tell you there's no hope for you but this bleeding bloody message is the Hope for you because there's blood over you and because of the blood you could get the Holy Ghost yes you may have messed up but if you make up your mind to apply the blood repent turn your away around come to the alt get prayed for and go back home and do the right thing God is obligated because his blood is powerful you may be seated you may be seated but you know what's amazing think about it Abel Abraham Isaac Jacob Elijah David Samuel Shamar habac Isaiah they all had blood applied for their day but it was lambs and Bulls and oats and listen the blood from the sacrifices was to cover their sin because they were uncovered it was just to cover their sin but that was not what God's plan was his plan was to take away sin not to cover up cover up cover up God was tired of covering up the problem cover up your pastor covering up God want you to take it as if you never did it in the first place take it so when Jesus came he brought the solution to erase it not cover it anymore not cover it anymore erase it erase it erase [Applause] it what sin what sin what sin as far as the East it's from the West he removed my transgression who do you think you are trying to tell me I can't worship I can't be a Christian you got to be crazy I know what Jesus died for he died for me he died for me that's my testimony that's my testimony he died for me I could shout this morning I could worship this morning you are free this morning there's blood for you this morning Hallelujah he is here this morning with an eraser he's erasing your past he's erasing your sin he's erasing your mistakes he's erasing you this morning you are free you are free to worship you are free to shout you are free to receive the Holy Ghost you are free to claim your inheritance [Applause] oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah the chains are being broken their chains are being broken you are being delivered right now set free right now Satan has got nothing on you he has nothing on you God can't even remember God cannot even remember when it's under the blood it's forgotten it never took place you could come boldly to the throne of grace and say Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost Lord don't forget my son Lord don't forget my daughter Lord don't forget my children pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry while others thou are calling do not pass me by [Applause] come on young people come on young people don't let the devil lie to you this message this seven T the message is blood for your situation it's blood it's a blood it's a blood it's a blood and when I see the blood I'll pass over you I'll pass over you I'll pass over you because I got nothing against you come on Joseph that Jose Perfection seed there's nothing against you there's nothing against you there's nothing against you nobody could arrest you there's no case with your name in it there's no warrant for your arrest the only one looking for you this morning is the incor writer looking to seal you for those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the city he's the one hunting you right now the devil can't chase you anymore the inkhorn writer he wants to seal he wants to seal you with the Holy Ghost he wants to seal you with power he was a seed with [Applause] authority hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes who do you see this is a greater than Solomon is here the Lord Jesus himself he just moved through the building he's going from person to person right now he's hunting people who have been struggle who have been struggling who've been hanging in there to tell you there's a way there's a possibility there's an escape there's a possibility this morning that you can have a Revival there's a possibility this morning that you can receive the Holy Ghost yes sister Christin because of the blood there's a possibility that your eyes will pop open come on now there's a possibility that this morning there's a possibility this [Applause] morning you may be [Applause] seated hallu H what are you saying but I say we are back to the leadership of the spirit on every matter hallu on every situation when we get back to the Bible every situation has to go back to the scripture it's no longer what we think it is what we feel it is it has to be tested by the scripture can the church chch say amen and listen amen a lot of people say well the Lord led me to do this and to do that that's a dangerous thing to say if what you're saying doesn't line up with the word because effectively you are lying on God and a lying tongue is one of the thing God hates right people lying on the Holy Ghost lying on the Holy Spirit the Lord led me the Lord will never lead you to do anything that's not in the scripture Hallelujah I got to say that again huj the Lord will never lead you to do anything that is against the Bible I don't care who you are because even brother branham's Ministry was limited by scripture amen because the Bible is the template for everything nothing can happen outside of scripture amen hallelujah amen so I'm challenging you now when we speak about being led by the spirit you have to have confirmation that you're led by the spirit and the confirmation has to be in the word not your interpretation of the word or your limited understanding of the word because our understanding can only be limited until God opens it you can't open it studying let me say that again your understanding cannot be opened by your own studying you have to study to show yourself approv but God is the one who opens understanding because he is the one as the revealer that's to bust the intellectuals in the message who feel studying from 8 to 4 every day suddenly makes you an authority on the prophet amen amen the only Authority on the prophet is God and only he can reveal the hidden things in there not by your studying but by you being predestinated to receive something from God and that's why I say this morning you could not even be here this morning unless you were led by the spirit can the church say Amen some I find myself in these grooves at times I was telling about o yesterday my wife was you know just quickly saying a few things about the way the ministers here speak she said brother Anthony loves to say there's more to you than me the ey and you said well brother o loves to say the devil cannot get stronger but you can so I was waiting to hear what you said about me she said and when you go up there you're saying not this church not this church suddenly I've come like the hatchet man coming with the Bazooka not this church pow po pow God's going to have a clean church a church in order but the gifts have to come together and work in harmony because we going to have a perfect Church listen I am the kind of person personal testimony I am either doing something or I'm not you don't get 70% from me it's 100% or zero I have two speeds zero or 100 I told my wife before we got before we got married I said listen if I'm doing this I'm doing this amen if I'm not doing it I'm not doing it amen so the fact that I'm doing this means I'm in it [Applause] 100% 40% I said to her listen I said listen if this marriage fails it's not because of me cuz I'm in it 100% And when I of the Lord I serve him [Applause] 100% you see all these Christians who want to be in and out halfway in one foot in your toe in on Sunday by Wednesday your foot up in the air I can't understand that the Bible says either you're hot or you're cold if you com to church and you want to be a Christian be a Christian every Sunday you have a spark plug you know to got the jump out the car put it up in the Cable One battery but BR over there start your engine all right good start your engine now you supposed to come in your battery [Applause] charge no you on Revival not jumper cables jumper cables jumper cables how much how much you long it take to jump all these cars Hallelujah but if you come charged up for service then moment service start rev your engines we are driving to the resurrection we are driving let's go let the Holy Spirit lead the charge because we are led by the spirit somebody say Amen that was not in my [Applause] notes [Music] God Simeon was led by the spirit amen you shall not see death until you see the Lost Christ you think any body could tell s anything San wife do believe it that is her problem the son do believe it that is his problem s brother that is his problem God told me but the said s was led by the Holy Ghost he was in service because he know Jesus have to come to the temple Jesus not going to the market first he come into the temple so you have to be in the temple to see him amen I hope you can read between the lines and then said listen when Jesus walks in he said Simeon was led by the Holy Ghost he just know today's the day he just feel it something bubble on the inside when the Holy Spirit leading you you know when your time coming all of a sudden you start to feel a little lighter see wait a minute he just feels like today is my day today is my and there is little Mary coming in there not too confident and you know whenever know your baby now born you know too is her first child she she had not she just taking her time coming in and is seeming and all excited led by the Holy Spirit bypass this one bypass this one and comes to Mary and Hallelujah driven by the Holy Ghost now let your servant depart in peace because the Holy Spirit led him to see Messiah there's something happens in your life when you are led by the Holy Spirit blind anim led by the Holy Spirit Well if this one can't get you I don't know what will she couldn't even see where she was going but the holy spirit is his own Compass it own driver is own Direction Anna knows that she's walking not this one not this one not this church not that church not this group not this Doctrine not this denomination somewhere around here there's some led by the Holy Spirit and that's what we want to be led by the spirit somebody say [Applause] Amen in the message expectation but the B said the same reason that you are here today you sick people the same holy ghost that led Simeon the same holy ghost that led Anna has led you here for you believe that there's a fountain open somewhere for you healing it's here God moving among his people believing somebody say [Applause] Amen so friends if you are led by the Holy Spirit young sisters the holy spirit will not lead you to cut your ha amen amen amen the Holy Spirit wouldn't lead you to commit fornication the Holy Spirit wouldn't lead you to go and party the holy spirit will not lead you into Shady places amen and I'm seeing this deliberately I'm not saying this for cause effect or for points because many of us have dropped our God Amen there is an illusion of confidence and but Bram spoke about it with that young lady who was delivered and went back to the bar to minister to [Music] somebody she felt she was stronger than she really was and a spirit entered her so if you are not working aggressively to protect your Christian walk you will fall if you are out of Fellowship I don't care how much you read and study if you are out of Fellowship because Fellowship in the world is put there for a purpose you spend all your time with co-workers and friends on the street or friends in the school eventually those voices will have an influence and I say to the young people the devil is not going to come to you and tell you hey smoke this now he's going to come a little some easier we go and smoke you don't have to smoke but just come with us amen amen and slowly your defenses break down until you say wait a minute and you don't find nothing is wrong with it but brandom taught it like this he said if you have a question about doing something don't to do it I don't want to lay that down in the church this morning not this church lay it down in the church don't play games with your soul we have a respon responsibility to say things to you effectively without any ambiguity that's right to make sure it is very clear and but brandom said it like this he said if you are in a church and the church stands for a certain something and you are in the church then you are supposed to stand with it so if we say in this church Brothers don't do this or we do this if you are in this church you have to line up with it or you can find another church this church has never been about come now come come come do you want no God has an order God has a structure you are free because you don't belong to brother you don't belong to the ministers you belong to God and sheep are meant to be led so if you are in a leadership position then you have to question whether or not you are sheep because if you are sheep you supposed to be led by the Holy Spirit and that's what we are speaking on this morning to be led by the spirit and but the Bram challenged Bram Tabernacle he said check it by the word yourself check it by the scriptures yourself so that you know where you're standing can the church say Amen we are going to have a CH we're going to turn the heat up seven times hotter because that's the conditions for sin not to stay in the church can the church say amen hallelujah brother B say in return and Jubilee the church is a born against born again bunch of Believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the spirit of God they are not of the world Hallelujah they are out of the world they are different from the world so friends if all of the stuff you do is like the world there's something wrong because you are supposed to look different talk different walk different act different I'm supposed to be able to identify you from a mile away [Applause] halll it's good word or hallelujah hallelujah when you give people the jump shout joy everybody say yes that's me but when it comes on to living the life the reality of life on the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday when you are not fortifying yourself because God gave Joshua the conditions for good success read and pray every day meditate on the word day and [Applause] night and like any discipline in life if you don't make time if you are in school and you don't study you're not going to achieve anything how do you expect to achieve as a Christian because butam taught us God Don't Make halfway Christians God Don't Make halfway preachers but we are the ones based on how we live manifest a certain something if you don't work at your marriage it will fail if you don't work at your schooling it will fail if you don't work at Defending Your Life it will fail you want to buy a house you have to save that takes discipline it takes time you want to be a real Christian but the Bram said the tutor monitors the behavior of the son and after a while reports back to the father hey on a Monday he does this on a Tuesday he does this on a Wednesday he does this I think this son is worthy to be adopted it's not your conduct when you're in the church Hallelujah come on now say that again it's not your conduct when you are in the church in everybody here saying right now you we see Monday when you change your outfit and you put the hair all the way up and and you listen to all kind of music but brother Isaac we the message for a long time why he saying this kind of stuff because it's the reality of the attack the devil hasn't changed his his tactics it's still music it's still the boy in the world it's still the girl in the world it's still the woman and the job it's still the man in the job it's still the clothes it's still the lust it's the same demons so we will call it what it is because big people who supposed to be in the message for a long time still doing [Applause] foolishness when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child acted as a child but when I became a man 40 going on 12 45 going on 16 52 going on 18 when will we grow up as Christians and accept responsibility because when Adam got cornered Adam where at TH well I hiding because and is a woman his first action is not Lord I have sinned I know what I did was wrong is a woman that you give me not just the woman no but it's you if you didn't give me h i mean be in this position wow man it is the nature of man to pass on responsibility hallah hallah and blame somebody else for your condition how long will you blame your neighbor your father your mother your last Church the pastor the neighbor for your position when will you accept responsibility Lord I did not pray this morning when I got up I am wrong because I should have done it when will you accept responsibility I did not tell my wife I love her for the whole week whose job I supposed to come and tell every husband he you tell why you love hallelujah hallelujah Mercy hall Hall but over and I were in a meeting and I was saying you know and I'm preaching to the church so those who are connected God bless you I'm having a time this morning Hallelujah but I'm saying that people create such false expectations Hallelujah and when you come to church you have to expect certain things from the ministry we have a responsibility but you also have a responsibility and a lot of parents say well it's youth Ministries responsibility to do X Y and Z and you don't talk to your children you don't fellowship with your children you don't say hey how are you doing how is life is there anything is there anything with thing I can help you with whose responsibility is that have to come to your house and ask your child in front of you God fought for fellowship and relationship that's the found the beginning in Genesis 1 and 2 was relationship and you have to work at your relationships both with God and with those around you that you profess to love and have it as a reality displayed and be able to multif the Deeds of the Flesh and say I have to take certain sacrifices because God is pleased when he sees certain things in action that's when you know you've been led by the spirit because your life gets back in order Bible order has husband love your wives wives reverence your husband hallah Hallelujah that wasn't in my note Hallelujah the church is a born again bunch how we doing for time could I get some more time cuz I feel like in a gar this morning Pastor said don't stop the church is a born against Bunch you know and it's so troubling to me because people have a lot of Revelation a lot of knowledge and I think of it as Paul said I do I have knowledge and give my body to be burnt and know all Mysteries and I could speak in tongues and have no charity and I realize at the end of the day God is Not marking you on what you know all right what you understand what you could explain is that charity that love that conduct that behavior he said if you have all these things and have charity you are nothing and that's why brother BR said you don't need to know the mechanics you know what the mechanics is the Mysteries and the knowledge he said you need to have the Dynamics the Dynamics is the life the Dynamics is charity and the charity is manifested and reflected in your daily walk and that's why but the brandom said your daily walk must be led by the spirit because compassion compassion is not feeling sorry for people but they said compassion is doing what the will of God so when you led by the spirit you're feeling sorry for everybody Hallelujah like I said sometime ago God break some people legs for a reason because with the two legs they was going to all the parties so God break one so they go party so now until they totally embarrassed and realize that that is not for them amen amen and if this keep going I break the other one they'll Pat in a wheelchair that's [Applause] Hallelujah but God will do what he has to do why because he wants to see his life his nature his being his attributes his conduct living through you and living through me it's a reality let me get back on track the church is a born against again bunch of Believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the spirit of God they are not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world that's what makes them what they are their life is dead and they're hid in Christ dead in Christ and hid and sealed by the Holy Ghost they are away from the things of the world sons of God in expectation are led by the spirit spirit of God not led by some other Fanatics or some organization or something or another they are led by the spirit of God the Holy Spirit listen carefully was given to the church to be the overseer yes sir the tutor that was to raise the children of God not our Bishops and Cardinals and so forth but the Holy Ghost amen I'm expecting this is the prophet the Holy Ghost not denomination not a bishop not a Catholic priest not a Baptist preacher or a Pentecostal preacher I'm expecting listen the Holy Ghost to come down and set in order a church that will go to meet him filled with the power and the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting that I believe it God promised it that there' be a church there without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because God said it was so somebody say amen I just want to read a few quotes and I'm going to begin to wind down Hallelujah from the message the word became flesh in the trip report but the B said if your heart listen carefully and your mind is so infilled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind listen and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts God help me you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be amen somebody say Amen am what kind of a people would it be this morning if this branam Tabernacle and I say headstone Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't even have no alternative of your own but just to be led by the spirit is that your desire this morning no alternative of my own no plan of my own no desires of my own no thoughts of my own but just to be led by the Holy Spirit can the church say hallu Amen brother B that same message says and when the human element goes out yes and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself is there anybody wants to empty themselves this morning you empty yourself then will we then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material that's when the church is in his power and B said I believe it's on its road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves that they don't see themselves but they they they don't see no thoughts but to serve God no thoughts but to serve God no thoughts but serve God hallelujah and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world Amen they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind somebody say Amen [Music] [Applause] I want to share some stuff from the prophet because he says it better than I can amen you believe that this morning that's why we have a prophet Hallelujah no man has the ability or the authority to change what the prophet said and that's why we quote the prophet so that it's not my own thought my own idea people criticize us and say well you don't preach or quoting or don't say it so so and I have to be led by the spirit am and that's why I'm going back because God gave us a prophet not for us to just say we have a prophet but God gave us a prophet because the word of prophet brought its present tense its reality and it life to us do you feel that way this morning I am not ashamed of the son of man know of his words he may be seated amen but theam said our thoughts run different a lot of times we walk up and say how do you do brother and you don't it in your heart all right come on all right how you doing you good and they do really want to hear the answer you a lot of times we say I am this and that I will do this you don't mean it in your heart but when you become so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first Christ is all then your entire makeup is of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ he has full control Hallelujah that's when your thoughts will be clean and your thoughts will be pure can the church say amen amen we already spoke about this about Cain and Abel but B been led by the spirit talk about Abel being led by the spirit we're going to skip that amen led by the Holy Spirit from the message led by the spirit of God but the B said led by the ho Spirit Sons and Daughters of God led by the spirit of God Abraham didn't care what anybody else said he said now you separate yourself so he got this little group together and his wife and went out not knowing where he was going he said what do you care where you're going just keep going brother Bram said well where does it lead to just keep on walking he was led by the spirit of God and Men great men are always you don't have to question God what it's all about and sat down and figure it all up in science and how does the spirit of the supernatural being come and get into us that's the intellectuals in the message well this star with this star on this day so it means this and Hallelujah Moses was a man of God led by the spirit of God listen oh he wanted to lead himself one time Hallelujah he got all the mathematics and the militarism all in his mind he know what a great man he was so he thought he could go right out and do it himself but he found himself a failure every technique he started was wrong he slew a man that's the first thing the military cheat treats you kill somebody teachers go kill somebody else that was his tactic that's the prophet speaking so he went out on his military education and he slew a man and was a stranger among his Regin for 40 years but one day an old sheep heard her walking around the backside of the desert and the first thing you know he come into the presence of God and when he did the Holy Ghost got a fire Bush there and he told Moses more about his leading in 5 minutes minutes he had to take the military out of him and put the real genuine Holy Spirit in him so he could be led by the spirit I want you to notice Moses was a coward with all of his military training with all of his theology with all of his understanding of the Bible his mother had taught him from a child what was going to take place how he was going to be an emancipator of the great nation Israel all these things she had taught him but yet in his own mind he was unable to accomplish the purpose yes and every man I don't care how much education you got how well you know the Bible how much theology you have learned you are unqualified till you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be led by the spirit of [Applause] God why are you seeing this brother Isaac cuz I want to make sure that we are grounded in the word of God that no man could deceive you with any comly devised [Applause] fabl can the church say amen amen in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and all those things typed him they talk about all those who gone before just in type but yet the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something Hallelujah now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah and on down through we could take each of these prophets and bring their lives out and show it express Jesus Christ perfectly yet never giving his secret in full waiting for to make known in these last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it because the Bible is written in Mysteries Hallelujah can the church say Amen I'm going to skip down bit and but gives a story maybe you know it talk about being led by the spirit because God friends is looking for individuals he's not looking for a group he's not looking for a church he's looking for individuals in the message led by the spirit of God the musician could get ready he said here not long ago up in my country hope you all haven't got such down there a boy got saved or got converted and went to join a certain denominational Church why it's a Methodist so he and his wife so they moved from the country and went into the city and they took their membership out of the country Methodist Church where they had salvation and went down in the big city Church where they got a lot of theology oh everything just as starchy as it could be so after a couple years brother Bram said the old mommy of the boy kept raging to him said honey are you still going to church said yes we still go to church me and Molly goes all the time said well I'm going to come down and visit you so she was way up there in the mountains of Kentucky and when she come down she wore her Kentucky clothes way high neck great big puffed up shoulders and little old shoes on re long done and when she started in the church somebody said what antique shop did this come out of now the boy and his wife didn't want to take her to church because they know she was noisy she come out of a noisy church so they was afraid it'd be embarrassed so that morning she walked in and she said well praise the Lord to the Usher at the door he said M oh my but the M said there you got it that's his theology M but the m dramatizing so she got her seat and sat down the little lady her daughter-in-law bowed her head her face red her ears could have lit a match this is the prophet now her son looking sideways see the done gut in the wrong crowd that's all that's the way you get to when you get in the wrong crowd you see it's so s it comes so cunning but you just get in the wrong place all right after a while the preacher said dear friends we have one Redeemer and that is the Lord Jesus Mama Said Amen GL preacher said M my he said and he come to Earth to save the Lord she said Hallelujah that's right amen so he nodded over to his Deacon the Deacon went over and told her now said Madam we'd like you to come to church but you're interrupting the pastor if if you don't keep still we'll have to lead you out the door Jesus all right Mama's response you might as well take me yes because I just can't sit still when you're led by the spirit of God you'll blow up if you didn't say something led by the spirit of God she might not have had her name written in who's who but I can imagine but brandom said it was written in the Lamb's Book of Life he say i' rather have it there anyhow she might not have announced to much much she she may not have amounted to much here but in heaven she was a saint because she was led by the spirit of God it didn't matter where she went what church she went to she was a worshiper because she know who her father was she know where she come from you don't want me to shout take me out of here I'm going to shout outside but I know who my God is kind of church say Amen you may be seated I pray that will be a blessing and inspiration to you listen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my my my we having a time this morning huh from the message led by the spirit of God what a great man Elijah was and how he went up there led by the spirit of God and challenged Ahab now listen carefully look at the condition led by the spirit to challenge Ahab you can't just go and challenge unless you're led by the spirit right I and challenge that brother there what did the Holy Spirit lead you to go and challenge you putting yourself in a war zone you have one good and he have two Bazookas but Elijah is now different led by the spirit he goes to challenge Ahab Hallelujah he said bring all your priests down here that's when you know you're standing on good ground bring all your ministers bring bring everybody don't leave nobody bring everybody bring them tell them W them up bring themen let's see who is god let's put it to a showdown see who is God and they got all their priests out there they kill their sacrifice they Lance themselves jump upon the altar screaming oh bam answer Elijah walked around and said maybe he going fishing well send a memo to your God how a little louder maybe not hearing you this is what I'm dramatizing but said he know he wasn't no God at the beginning but just then about the time the evening sacrifice was due Elijah killed a Bullock and laid it upon the altar walked out there led by the spirit of God and said God I've done all this at your bidding brother said I tell you Devils will tremble and sinners will wake when men and women submit themselves to God and are led by the Holy Ghost can the church say amen that's what we are looking for in this church the dead will be raised in this church the sick will be healed in this church btis will be restored in this church why we are led by the [Applause] spirit now listen could you take some more feel like we a good audience this morning we came to have church friends we need more contact hours every week you know I don't think Sunday Wednesday Thursday is enough I think we should have a Tuesday and a Friday amen Amen brother Anthony message he him brother the said now notice talking about adoption now we read the scripture in Romans when there come the time of adoption this son received all of the rights his rights now there's where God wants his children listen carefully to a place that he can take you one by one one by one listen carefully one by one well I in this group and you in that group and I can't shake your hand and after all of that God going to say come you you in the group come take you one by one take you out before the public so you're going to have to stand your own ground your own testimony and Minister something to you that's spectacular that's the prophet speaking Hallelujah something that one of his gifts that he wants to give his church oh there's all kinds of gifts that God has for his church but how can the father listen give us gifts when we are acting the way we are acting see he makes it known the whole world everybody will see this gift manifested if God adopts you or places you possess positionally into his family so that's why I always say there can't be a question mark or H I wonder if he adopted boy you listen to what the prophet said God will make it known there will be no question the manifestation will be the interpretation you may be see it like I heard somebody say this week you can't be kind of pregnant all right all right you're pregnant or no but kind of pregnant is either you're pregnant or you're not pregnant it's either you're adopted or you're not adopted it's either you have the Holy Ghost or you don't have the Holy Ghost it's either you repented or you did not repent it's either you're hot or you're cold but if you are contending for something until you get it keep contending wait until something [Applause] happens I feel like get you want to go to wall feel you have a gun I feel I have a gun in his backpack here I go out and fight yet check the B I feel I have a gun I feel I have a grenade I feel I have something in this back here I'm going and you in the middle surrounded by you're reaching a sandwich potatoes hallelujah it's either you have it or you do have it and if it don't have it we should be desperate to get it desperate on a su desperate on a Monday desperate on a Tuesday desperate on a Wednesday take time off and work if you have to because this is more important than work Heaven and Earth will pass away but this will not pass away this is the most important meeting of your [Applause] week can the church say [Music] amen hallelujah my just a little more but said and why are we not a den domination he said now you don't read God's word just like you read a newspaper amen amen you read God's word by the Holy Spirit see because the Holy Spirit itself speaking through Christ Christ thanking God that he'd hid these things from the eyes of the wise and proven and would reveal them to babes such as would learn so you see there's no way of ever being educated there's no way of ever denominating there's only one way to get right that's be led by the spirit of God and that experience you had must cope with this word then you got it see can the church say Amen we going to begin to wind now from the message looking at the Unseen but said when God made man we back to Genesis he made him thus for he made this little certain compartment in the man for his own Throne his control tower God wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself therefore there is a war constantly a constant War a constant battle a constant challenge amen the man wants to go after what he sees listen with his eyes and that's where he is deceived that's where Satan deceived Eve by what she could see the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was death to the Soul that's right so is it tonight today God wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that a man would be led by the spirit of God amen amen getting off on his own leading is what separated him from his Fellowship looking at what he could see with his eye amen and that's where he stands tonight all those who are led by such things but the scripture says Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God your emotions is your control by B said you can notice a man or woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they never can please God never never never if you put your career above God you can never please God you put your house above God never please God how you look before God never please God money before God never please God Church before God never please God message before before God never please God but God first God thank you but a man or a woman that will not look at the things of the world but just go according to the leading of the spirit they are usually in the will of God hallelujah can the church say amen amen hallelujah man always tried to achieve something by his head he's supposed to achieve it by his heart Hallelujah that's the control tower where God controls and directs his thoughts direct his walk direct his emotions some I get so happy I just have to let loose and if I look around and see somebody then see I got my eyes on people then but God helped me to keep my eyes closed so but say listen be let and don't worry about anybody else you want to Worship You worship amen you want to testify you testify amen I just want to be led by the spirit of God that the flesh will have nothing to do into it what we need tonight brother Bram said is a unified Church filled with the Holy Ghost and power from on high led by the spirit of the Living God on the control tower that won't say because I'm a Baptist and he's a Methodist I have nothing to do with him a real true spirit of God will recognize his brother or sister I don't care what kind of brand he is wearing oh we need a leadership again of the Holy Spirit walking after the Unseen the way that go God leads us can the church say amen hallelujah glory to God I pray this has been such a blessing to you Hallelujah so that you'll be seated now with the right thing and recognize that God's standard is here and we have to step up to that standard can the church say Amen nothing less than the standard nothing less than the absolute nothing less than the word itself you may be seated Hallelujah there's a few more pages I'm going to finish up the message brother Bram said in the message of rejected King he said puts me in the mind of some of these cold formal mors that we've got today talking about churches get so far away from God you don't know how to get back you'll never come back by Creeds you've got to have inspiration to lead you brother and that inspiration comes by the Holy Ghost yes LED of the spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God they love the spirit they don't try to say now wait a minute my church they don't say Amen my church never raise their hands they're very quiet why we give our pastor chills and fever if somebody holler amen well you ought to chill him up once in a while led by the spirit amen from Jehovah Gyra just if you are led by this prayer listen now just take your time until you got zeroed in if you don't you'll shoot too high or shoot too wide or something let's make it zero the Bible I believe that God wants us to zero in hallelu the Holy Spirit zeroed in with the apostles or they had zeroed in with the Holy Spirit rather and I believe we can do the same thing by the same word it hits the target and if it hit it one time dead center it could hit again but you've got to zero in can the church say Amen what we need today brother brandham said in the message God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship what we need today is a beating the gospel back in the church to straighten the church up to pull it out of the kings that it's in and come back under the Fellowship of the blood again in this Shina Glory unto a Pentecostal experience like it had back many years ago like we used to have years ago what we need like in the days of John Wesley we back in the days of Calvin KN way back all the way to Pentecost what we need listen is a relationship again with God talk about Adam right till men are willing to die out to themselves you can begin to play something softly hallelujah hallelujah die out of themselves in the secret chamber with God until New Life is produced until they become a new creature let a man do that if he's a little old coward he will go out and win souls he said said this will make you C and win souls even if you're a coward it'll make you C and win souls because you have an experience because why he becomes in Divine relationship with God in the secret room to himself with him and God he's anointed and went to there with tears rolling over his cheeks and saying God give me the Holy Spirit hallu I don't care if it cost my wife my children my girlfriend my ever what I am just fill me Lord till I could stand in your presence and feel the sh of Glory moving surging over me and through me is that your prayer this morning brother bam speaks about a song spirit of God move in me that's what we need move fresh fall upon me Lord stand there until God takes you into the holiest of holies until God now shuts the curtain behind you and shuts the world out and shuts you up with Christ till you don't care who's around hallelujah what else about you you are walking in the spirit led by the spirit doing the things the spirit would have you to do saying the things that the spirit would have you to say then you come into Divine Fellowship is that your prayer this morning now listen carefully brother Brandon in the message to guide my last quote amen he said that's the trouble today you don't need Hallelujah no guy to guide you down the broad way you know all the alleys and everything else you know all the way to sin you've been around a long time there's no need of somebody trying to tell you about that you know all the shortcuts that's right every sin you know all about it nobody has to tell you to steal you know that nobody has to tell you how to curse you know that nobody has to tell you how to do these evil things because it's posted on every tree everywhere but remember you people people that's Christians You' have crossed over you're into another land amen you're born again you're in the land a Heavenly land you're in the promised landall and that's why I took for an inspiration we have not passed this way before and if we have not passed this way before no man is the authority on how to get where we need to go it has to be the Holy Spirit itself leading us and if we can yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit then that connection is no longer you and any man it's you and God being led by the spirit into what God has for you he said if you pass this way you have to come through Holiness because it's a new land a new life a new people you'll come to church and you hear somebody raise him and holler glory to God hallelujah because you have not been this way before I challenge you friends many of us as brother brandham said we have been led by so many different things and not led by the spirit but Jesus said I'm not going to leave you comfortless Hallelujah I'm not going to leave you without a guide but I'm going to send the Holy Spirit a comforter to guide you into all truth Amen to guide you into your inheritance to guide you into your purpose friends the holy spirit will never lead you against the word it will only direct you to Bible order it will only direct you to children obing your parents it will only direct you to husband loving your wives it will only direct you to wives reverencing your husband it will only direct you to being in Fellowship one with another it will only direct you to forgive it will only direct you to love it will only direct you to make things right it will only direct you to repent it will only direct you to say Lord I'm sorry I need you I need you I need you I challenge you as you stand to your feet to rededicate your life to being led by the Holy Spirit brother Bram said God wants to lead us he wants to direct us he wants to take us where we need to be may the Lord richly bless you this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah oh lift your hands right now and just worship Him oh lift
