[47:37] Welcome to each and every one of you. He
[47:38] is here. He's in our midst. And we have
[47:41] a special tip we like to share with you
[47:43] that I believe will inspire you and help
[47:44] you and strengthen you placed into the
[47:48] body of Christ. It's a message to take
[47:50] you completely to church and recognize
[47:52] there's a body. It's a universal body
[47:55] and by one spirit you are baptized into
[47:57] that body. It's the body of Christ. So
[47:59] God bless you and we're going to go
[48:00] straight into that message tonight. What
[48:02] a shame. Praise the Lord.
[48:08] It looked like it was over and it looked
[48:10] as if it was over.
[48:13] You
[48:15] you made a way. Now I'm standing here.
[48:20] And now I'm standing here. Oh, only
[48:24] because you made a Oh, you you made a
[48:31] way. Lift your hands and sing. Oh, when
[48:34] our backs were against the wall. Oh, and

[48:40] hands and testify. You You made a way.

[48:51] only because you made
[48:55] Oh, you made a way.
[49:01] Oh, and our paths were against the wall.
[49:06] And it looked as if it was over.
[49:09] You
[49:11] You made a way.
[49:16] Now I'm standing here only because you
[49:21] made the way. Let's worship the Lord as
[49:25] the music.
[49:26] [Music]
[49:38] [Applause]
[49:40] [Music]
[49:43] Heat.
[49:46] [Music]
[49:52] Heat.
[49:54] [Music]
[50:07] [Music]
[50:30] He sent us miracles.
[50:32] Hallelujah. He caused walls to fall.
[50:36] There is nothing impossible in here for
[50:39] I'm standing here
[50:42] only because you
[50:45] are turn greet somebody name.
[50:49] [Music]
[51:01] Hallelujah.
[51:03] That's Jesus.
[51:04] [Music]
[51:14] Oh, he made a way for us this morning.
[51:17] Let's bow heads and we want to close our
[51:18] eyes and want to look to the Lord and
[51:20] pray. Father God, we thank you for your
[51:21] blood, for your mercy, your grace. Lord,
[51:24] we feel the windows of heavens are open
[51:26] this morning, Lord, and your grace and
[51:28] blood and love and pouring out. Lord,
[51:31] may you speak to every heart here this
[51:32] morning as we wait on you. And Lord, we
[51:35] know what the people, you know what the
[51:37] people have need of. May you come and
[51:39] minister to them and minister and meet
[51:41] their every need. You know the sick
[51:43] cases among us. You know the request
[51:45] that we have here. Oh Lord, may you
[51:47] speak to our hearts and anointed with
[51:49] such a faith to believe for all things
[51:52] are possible to them that believe. Grant
[51:54] it father in Jesus name we ask it. Amen.
[51:57] God bless you. Amen.
[52:00] You have your seats.
[52:04] Appreciate the Lord this morning.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, we feel his presence. Do you feel
[52:08] his presence this morning?
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[52:12] I ask brother Anthony to sing that song
[52:14] this morning for me. You made a way. I
[52:16] love that song. It's It speaks to us. It
[52:19] speak to our hearts. Speak to our
[52:21] spirits that where we are, we are. And
[52:23] what we are is just by the grace of God.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask to bring us here this
[52:27] morning, but he brought us. We want to
[52:29] be grateful to God in our hearts for his
[52:32] mercy towards us. We failed him. We fall
[52:34] short but his mercy endured forever.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; He gave us the opportunity for
[52:39] forgiveness, for pardon, for cleansing,
[52:41] from sin, from restoration, for
[52:43] reconciliation, and we are grateful.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; We are thankful. We are appreciative of
[52:50] his his love towards us. What else could
[52:53] we do but worship him and praise him? We
[52:56] are so undeserving. But the Bible said,
[52:58] "Now we the sons of God and give us this
[53:01] great opportunity in this final uh end
[53:04] of time to bear witness of Jesus Christ,
[53:07] him being the same yesterday, today and
[53:09] forever." So we have some uh serious
[53:12] prayer requests and we want to take this
[53:13] right after the service. We want to go
[53:15] in the word now. So let's all stand. We
[53:18] want to say happy birthday to brother
[53:19] Steven Oliver. So any after service,
[53:21] give him a big hug and quick greetings.
[53:23] God bless you, brother Steven. Blessed
[53:26] be the name of the Lord.
[53:28] So this morning we want to go to our
[53:29] Bibles to two portion of scripture.
[53:31] Ephesians 4 and Colossians chapter 1.
[53:35] Want to welcome each and every one of
[53:36] you here this morning. Welcome all those
[53:39] connected to us live on the internet and
[53:42] those that would here on our YouTube
[53:45] channel, Headstone Tamaka YouTube
[53:46] channel. God bless you trusting that
[53:50] this message this morning will be
[53:51] edifying and build you and strengthen
[53:54] you to face and deal with the battle
[53:56] that leaves ahead.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4
[54:02] reading from verse 4.
[54:10] There is one body
[54:13] and one spirit.
[54:15] Even as you are called in one hope of
[54:18] your calling,
[54:19] one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[54:25] one God and Father of all, who is above
[54:28] all and through all and in you all. But
[54:33] on the unto every one of us is given
[54:35] grace according to the measure of the
[54:39] gift of Christ. Want to turn to
[54:41] Colossians chapter 1. We want to read
[54:44] from verse 12 to 19.
[54:51] Giving thanks unto the Father, which had
[54:53] made us meat to be partakers of the
[54:56] inheritance of the saints in light, who
[54:58] had delivered us from the power of
[55:00] darkness, and had translated us into the
[55:03] kingdom of his dear son, in whom we have
[55:07] redemption through his blood, even the
[55:10] forgiveness of sins, who is in the image
[55:13] of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[55:16] every creature. For by him are all
[55:19] things created in heaven and that are in
[55:22] the earth, visible and invisible,
[55:25] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[55:27] principalities or powers. All things are
[55:30] created by him and for him. And he is
[55:34] before all things, and by him all things
[55:38] consist. And he is the head of the body,
[55:41] the church, who is the beginning, the
[55:45] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[55:48] things he might have the preeminence.
[55:51] For it pleased the father that in him
[55:53] should all fullness dwell. Let us pray
[55:55] one more time. Father, we thank you for
[55:57] your word. May you come and interpret it
[55:59] to our hearts. May it be a true lamp to
[56:02] our feet and a light onto our path. And
[56:04] may it shine in righteousness to your
[56:06] people. May great deliverance, signs,
[56:08] wonders, and miracles be brought today.
[56:10] Confirm your word with signs and
[56:12] wonders. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. And
[56:14] amen. You may be seated. As you sit
[56:16] down, give the Lord a shout of praise.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you, Jesus.
[56:24] Wonderful.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Hallelujah.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Keep your Bibles close to you. We want
[56:29] to read the next scripture shortly. But
[56:31] before that, I want to give the title.
[56:32] The title is placed
[56:35] in the body of Christ.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I have a subject many members
[56:41] one body.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; And I have an inspiration rebuilding the
[56:46] church by the spirit.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Um many members one body.
[56:52] Rebuilding the church by the spirit. I
[56:54] want to go into 1 Corinthians chapter
[56:56] 12.
[57:04] And I want to read from verse
[57:07] 4.
[57:10] That's right. 1 Corinthians. 1
[57:13] Corinthians chapter 12.
[57:24] Anybody find it?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now there are diversities of gifts
[57:30] but the same spirit.
[57:32] There are differences of administrations
[57:36] but the same Lord. And there are
[57:38] diversities of operations but it is the
[57:42] same God which workketh all in all. And
[57:46] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[57:49] to every man to profit with. For one to
[57:53] one is given by the spirit the word of
[57:55] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[57:59] by the same spirit to another faith by
[58:04] the same spirit. To another the gifts of
[58:07] healing by the same spirit. To another
[58:11] the working of miracles. To another
[58:14] prophecy. To another discerning of
[58:17] spirits. To another diverse kinds of
[58:20] tongues. to another the interpretation
[58:24] of tongues. But all these workketh that
[58:28] one the cells same spirit divide into
[58:32] each man severally as he will. For as
[58:36] the body is one and had many members,
[58:40] and all the members of that one body, so
[58:46] also is Christ. For by one spirit are we
[58:51] all baptized into one body, whether we
[58:55] be Jews
[58:57] or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free,
[59:01] and have been all made to drink into one
[59:05] spirit. For the body is not one member,
[59:10] but many. And if the foot shall say,
[59:14] "Because I am not the hand, I am not of
[59:17] the body," is it therefore not of the
[59:19] body? And if the ear shall say, "Because
[59:23] I'm not the eye, I am not of the body,
[59:25] is it therefore not of the body?" If the
[59:28] whole body were an eye, where would the
[59:31] hearing?
[59:32] &gt;&gt; If the whole body were hearing, where
[59:34] were the smelling? But now God had set
[59:38] the members, every one of them, in the
[59:40] body as it had pleased him.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; And if there were all one member, where
[59:48] were the body? But now are there many
[59:51] members, yet one body?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I
[59:57] have no need of thee. Nor again the head
[1:00:00] to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay,
[1:00:03] much more those members of the body
[1:00:05] which seemed to be feeble are necessary.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; For those members of the body which we
[1:00:15] think to be less honorable, God upon
[1:00:18] these we bestow much abundant honor, and
[1:00:21] our uncumbly parts have more abundant
[1:00:24] comeliness. For our comedy parts have no
[1:00:27] need, but God had tempered the body
[1:00:29] together, having given more abundant
[1:00:31] honor to the part which lacked. That
[1:00:35] there should be the purpose is that
[1:00:36] there should be no schism in the body.
[1:00:39] And that the members should have the
[1:00:41] same care one for another. And whether
[1:00:45] one one member suffer, all the members
[1:00:48] suffer with it. When one member be
[1:00:50] honored, all the members be rejoice with
[1:00:53] it. Now ye are the body of Christ and
[1:00:56] members in particular. May God bless his
[1:00:59] word. Oh, praise his wonderful name.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; So we thank God for the scripture. Read
[1:01:06] in Ephesians 5:30 says, "For we are
[1:01:08] members of his body, of his flesh and of
[1:01:11] his bones."
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; We are actually members. We have one
[1:01:14] body and we have hands, we have feet, we
[1:01:16] have ears and eyes and so on. Is not one
[1:01:19] member is entire body but many members
[1:01:21] in that body.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So too is the body of Christ. And
[1:01:25] Christ and that Christ body will have
[1:01:26] many members.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; It's a many membered body. Isn't that
[1:01:29] right? And you have to be placed in that
[1:01:31] body.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Now, we still in Joshua now. We still in
[1:01:35] Ephesians. We still in the land of
[1:01:37] promise where you have to drive the
[1:01:39] enemy out and come into your possession
[1:01:42] to possess what you know is your own.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot possess if you don't know
[1:01:47] what is your own. Therefore, what is
[1:01:49] your own has to be revealed to you and
[1:01:52] then that gives the faith to go and
[1:01:54] possess. Now, God don't want you observe
[1:01:57] the land, watch the land. God want you
[1:02:00] to possess the land. That is why God
[1:02:03] tell Joshua told us is the men go out
[1:02:06] and and go through the land and come and
[1:02:08] bring a description of the land. The
[1:02:10] description is evidence you have been
[1:02:12] through the land.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; You cannot describe what you did not
[1:02:15] see. You cannot describe what you didn't
[1:02:17] experience. The fact that Joshua asked
[1:02:20] for a description mean these guys walked
[1:02:22] through the land and God want you to
[1:02:24] walk through your land. You have to know
[1:02:26] your scriptures. You have to know your
[1:02:28] promise. That's why Jesus could go
[1:02:30] through the land and find the place
[1:02:32] where it is written
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; the spirit is upon me because he had
[1:02:36] anointed me.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; He had to find the scriptures. But
[1:02:40] Brandham had to find Malachi 4, Luke
[1:02:42] 17:30. Isn't that right? Revelation
[1:02:44] 10:7. He had to find a scripture and
[1:02:46] begin to anoint it. Now when he begin to
[1:02:49] discover it, he didn't manifest the
[1:02:51] scriptures just yet, but he was
[1:02:52] connected to it. He had to believe, I am
[1:02:55] that Malachi 4 scripture. He had to
[1:02:57] believe, I am that Elijah that was
[1:02:59] prophesied. He had to believe the spirit
[1:03:00] of Elijah is upon him. He had to believe
[1:03:03] that.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He had to look back
[1:03:05] and see he was that seven angels
[1:03:08] messenger.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; He had to look in the scripture and see
[1:03:11] he would reveal the son of man. That was
[1:03:14] his scripture. What about your
[1:03:16] scripture?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that
[1:03:18] believe.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; That's your scripture. He shall turn the
[1:03:21] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:03:23] of the fathers. That's your scripture.
[1:03:26] The spirit and the bride say come.
[1:03:28] That's your scripture. The same works I
[1:03:30] do shall you do also. That's your
[1:03:32] scripture. You have scripture also.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; That you have to begin to believe and
[1:03:37] anoint.
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:42] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Do you believe that?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Cain and Abel.
[1:03:59] No rum, no whiskey, no smoke, no ganja,
[1:04:01] no cigarette.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Say
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; brothers growing up.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And God say, "Come and worship me." All
[1:04:09] right. Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Let me see your revelation of who I am.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Cain brought flowers.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Ael brought blood.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; God confirmed Abel's revelation.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And rejected Cain's.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; But in that rejection, God put a door.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; He said, Cain, if you do like your
[1:04:32] brother,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; just follow
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; because he has revelation.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Just follow him. Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; If you do what he does,
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; I'll bless you the same.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the
[1:04:45] house?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; So even if you don't have a revelation,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; you could do like others who have
[1:04:51] revelation
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; and get the same blessing.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; This is brother Brennham. And the only
[1:05:00] way,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; that one was received could have done
[1:05:04] anything different from his brother, it
[1:05:06] was revealed to him. And Hebrews 11
[1:05:09] said, "By faith,
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[1:05:14] sacrifice than of Cain, which God
[1:05:17] testified he was righteous."
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Just the offering of the sacrifice,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; God gave testimony. Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That that's a righteous man.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; The man don't have to do anything. just
[1:05:28] bring a sacrifice and God said that's
[1:05:30] his righteous seed,
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; the seed of Abel.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Blessed is
[1:05:37] the man that God will impute
[1:05:39] righteousness.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Without works.
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When God pronounce
[1:05:48] you are righteous,
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; you are righteous.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Because that's the pronouncement of God.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; No man can change that.
[1:05:56] Your sins can't change that.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; What your family did can't change that.
[1:06:00] What your father, grandfather,
[1:06:02] great-grandfather did can't change that.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's a pronouncement of God.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I want to free you from your past. Free
[1:06:13] you from what the devil told you. Free
[1:06:15] you from what your family did. Forget
[1:06:17] about it.
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:24] That's why Jesus said, "Who does men say
[1:06:27] I, the son of man, am?"
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; They're talking, talking, talking. What
[1:06:31] they saying about me? Some say you are
[1:06:32] John the Baptist. Some say you, some say
[1:06:34] you liar, some say you're this, some say
[1:06:35] you're that. He said, "Who do you say
[1:06:37] that I am?"
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And they got caught. Following a man for
[1:06:43] three and a half years, they don't know
[1:06:44] where he is. A nice man. He's a good
[1:06:46] man. He does do miracles. We know he
[1:06:48] different. He have a higher level,
[1:06:49] higher authority. Who is this man?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, Peter said, "De Christ,
[1:06:55] son of the living God."
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "Flesh and blood
[1:07:00] had not revealed it to you." You didn't
[1:07:01] read it in the book. You didn't get it
[1:07:03] in my email. You're going to get it by
[1:07:04] text. Nobody on WhatsApp it to you.
[1:07:06] Flesh and blood had not revealed it unto
[1:07:08] you, but my father in heaven had
[1:07:10] revealed it unto you. And here we go.
[1:07:12] Here we go now. And upon this rock,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I will build.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Not not this pastor
[1:07:19] going to build. I will build
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; my church. And according to Colossians,
[1:07:25] he's the head of the body
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; called the church.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; So the church is Christ's body.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; The real church,
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; the true church upon this rock. Oh,
[1:07:35] glory.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; We have church buildings, church
[1:07:38] structure. We have pastors and deacons.
[1:07:41] But that's not what he's talking about.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't say some man will build it
[1:07:45] upon this rock.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; What's that rock? Upon this revelation.
[1:07:49] That means he has to reveal himself.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, I will build my church.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Not upon the information. Come on now.
[1:07:58] Not upon the knowledge. Come on now. But
[1:08:00] when the spirit revealed to you, I don't
[1:08:03] care what the devil, you could be
[1:08:04] trapped this morning. You could be in a
[1:08:06] hell hole this morning. But if God
[1:08:09] reveal himself to you, the devil have to
[1:08:12] back up. Back up. The devil have to give
[1:08:14] up. The devil have to put away his guns
[1:08:17] because who does Solomon set free? Is
[1:08:21] free indeed. Of course, there are
[1:08:24] issues. They're supposed to have issues
[1:08:26] in your life. That's what he came for.
[1:08:29] He came to heal the sick. He came to set
[1:08:31] the captive free. He came to bring
[1:08:33] deliverance to them that are bound. He
[1:08:35] came to open the blind eyes. There got
[1:08:38] to be somebody sick. There got to be
[1:08:40] somebody bound. There got to be somebody
[1:08:43] demonpossessed. There got to be a death,
[1:08:45] a blind, a heart, a lame, a dead. There
[1:08:48] got to be somebody that God can't work
[1:08:51] on.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Be seated.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; There going to be an obstacle.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; There going to be a red sea
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; to know that he
[1:09:04] made a way.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; There got to be obstacle. There got to
[1:09:08] be a wall around Jericho that we could
[1:09:10] know that God could bring down the
[1:09:12] walls. That's why That's why there was a
[1:09:14] Jericho that we could have faith in the
[1:09:16] last days. God could make the impossible
[1:09:19] possible. Yes. Yes. Yes. God could open
[1:09:21] up the Red Sea. God could make a way
[1:09:24] there. There's no way. You're going to
[1:09:25] have faith this morning. You're going to
[1:09:27] have the faith to believe for yourself
[1:09:29] that you're going to get out your
[1:09:30] condition. You're going to get out your
[1:09:32] sickness. You're going to get out your
[1:09:34] situation. You're going to preach faith
[1:09:36] into you this morning. Oh, glory to God.
[1:09:38] Give the Lord a shout. I don't care
[1:09:40] what's in your home, what's around you.
[1:09:42] I don't care what messing with your
[1:09:44] husband, what messing with your wife. I
[1:09:46] don't care what messing your mind right
[1:09:48] now.
[1:09:52] [Applause]
[1:09:59] Remember,
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; remember Adam get kicked out.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; the Garden of Eden.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; they got kicked out.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; But that didn't stop Abel from getting
[1:10:15] revelation. Because sons and daughters,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; are you ready?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Have the ability
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; to hear
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; from God
[1:10:25] [Applause]
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; without anybody in between.
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; We preach the word, but we can't reveal
[1:10:38] the word.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; We preach the word, but the Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] is the revealer of what we preach.
[1:10:45] So, you're hearing it, but when it drop
[1:10:48] down like the spirit,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; that's yours.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; You You didn't hear me.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You did not hear me this morning. If you
[1:10:56] heard that, you'll be shouting.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; When we are preaching this morning, the
[1:11:01] word
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; between me and you, the word coming out,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; but the spirit is hanging over.
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. That's why Hebrews
[1:11:13] says the word didn't profit them
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't mixed with faith to
[1:11:18] them that heard it. So even though 2
[1:11:21] million was hearing Moses, it's only
[1:11:23] Joshua and Caleb had divine revelation
[1:11:26] as to what to possess. So it's not the
[1:11:29] multitude, the multitude is always
[1:11:31] mixed. It's the elect, Mr. Multitude
[1:11:34] that could catch divine revelation and
[1:11:36] move by inspiration.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You can hear me this morning. Oh glory
[1:11:42] be in the spirit this morning. You may
[1:11:43] be seated.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Understand this.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was walking on the water,
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Lord, if that you be me
[1:11:52] to come,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus said one word,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; come
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Peter had a choice. I stayed right here.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Getting frightened by the second." Peter
[1:12:04] had a choice. He didn't wait and say,
[1:12:05] "Lord, have mercy upon me, Lord, in the
[1:12:07] name of Jesus. Lord God, sanctify me or
[1:12:09] I don't worthy to walk in this water."
[1:12:10] No, he didn't go down in that premitting
[1:12:12] mode.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; He just hear a word come and he stepped
[1:12:15] out.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; He stepped out and he began to walk just
[1:12:19] like Jesus. He began to walk on the
[1:12:21] water just like Jesus. It wasn't Jesus.
[1:12:24] It was Peter obeying Jesus. And if God
[1:12:27] tell you walk this morning, just walk.
[1:12:34] [Applause]
[1:12:40] Oh my. You be seated. Oh, some of you
[1:12:45] waking to see the walls come down before
[1:12:46] you shout. He didn't tell them that. He
[1:12:49] said, "Shout
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; shout by the walls up."
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; When I
[1:12:57] did you
[1:12:58] shout,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; shout by the tumor. The doctor say you
[1:13:02] have a tumor.
[1:13:04] Shout when the doctor say I resist.
[1:13:07] Shout when the doctor give up on you.
[1:13:10] But don't give up on God.
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; When you could shout before the walls
[1:13:28] come down that prove you have faith.
[1:13:32] When you could stagger not at the
[1:13:33] promise of God through unbelief but
[1:13:35] strong given praise to God and you don't
[1:13:37] have evidence of that child that is
[1:13:39] faith.
[1:13:40] [Applause]
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; When you could tell yourself if you
[1:13:42] could just touch the hem of his garment
[1:13:44] and push between men legs and push men
[1:13:46] aside and press and push and push. You
[1:13:50] can't talk it. You have to walk it. Give
[1:13:53] the Lord some praise people. You could
[1:13:55] talk talk talk talk but when the time
[1:13:58] come to apply your faith to your
[1:14:01] situation that is when it matters.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to everybody inside of
[1:14:06] here?
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said by the Christ upon this rock
[1:14:15] I'll be my church. He said blessed are
[1:14:17] thou son but Jonah flesh and blood never
[1:14:20] reveal it to you. My father which is in
[1:14:23] heaven hath revealed it to you. Upon
[1:14:25] this rock I'll build my church what?
[1:14:27] What? This is prophet the true
[1:14:30] revelation of the word.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; There is the true vine again.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; It have true revelation. It have false
[1:14:38] revelation.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; It have revelation and it have
[1:14:41] intellectual reasoning.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; As I said Thursday night have a bunch of
[1:14:45] ministers now had to call them ticklers.
[1:14:48] They anointed to tickle the ears of the
[1:14:50] people and they have silly woman laden
[1:14:52] with diverse lust have in the ears
[1:14:54] itching to hear new doctrine, new
[1:14:56] teaching, new revelation and the devil
[1:14:58] just have it for them
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; because they don't want to hear it will
[1:15:01] rain
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; because if it will rain you have to
[1:15:04] prepare for it.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; They don't want to prepare for it.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; You if you know it will have dynamics.
[1:15:09] The Holy Ghost is about to pour out.
[1:15:11] You're going to make preparations for
[1:15:12] it.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Because faith, which is revelation,
[1:15:15] brings preparation, brings expectation
[1:15:18] for the manifestation.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see it?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham got a revelation of Isaac
[1:15:26] coming.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Sarah God did not I love what God did.
[1:15:30] He did not talk to Sarah.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. All right.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; So Sarah have no encouragement for
[1:15:35] Abraham.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Abraham. I'm back. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:38] Sarah can't say no. Amen.
[1:15:41] Sarah have a old horror because she's a
[1:15:43] old woman
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; and she has no faith to believe in this
[1:15:47] powerl that Abraham testifying about
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; but God told Abraham through Sarah
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; when Sarah started to believe she
[1:15:58] introduced Abraham to Hagar
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; she had an interpretation with her
[1:16:03] belief
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; but Sarah so Abraham can rely upon Sarah
[1:16:08] so I back because my wife encourage
[1:16:10] Encourage me.
[1:16:12] Is that right?
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; In which Bible you find that?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Not in this one. David say I encourage
[1:16:18] myself.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; You have nobody a shake my hand. That's
[1:16:22] that's cool.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Nobody ain't calling me. That's cool. Do
[1:16:25] you call anybody? You have to do better
[1:16:27] than that. You have to be rugged.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; You have to believe God designed you for
[1:16:30] this hour.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You have to see no weapon formed against
[1:16:33] you will prosper.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; You have to believe when you walk, devil
[1:16:36] is trembling.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that.
[1:16:40] That's your scripture.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; No man
[1:16:43] shall be able to stand before thee
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; all the days of thy life.
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So you're not going expecting defeat.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; You expecting victory
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; every time.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; If defeat come, you deal with it.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; If you fall, you get back up. You dust
[1:17:06] your pants. You dust your dress. You
[1:17:07] dust your clothes. and you get back up
[1:17:09] and you go back in the ring again
[1:17:11] because you supposed to win this fight.
[1:17:13] And if the devil feel you're going to
[1:17:14] pack up, you say, "No, devil. You win
[1:17:17] this one, but I'm coming back because my
[1:17:19] God is awesome.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; My God is real."
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:17:27] God.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:17:34] Like David when David asked God about a
[1:17:36] man that prospering and God David God
[1:17:38] tell David have you consider his end
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; don't let that prosperity fool you
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; forget that it's a race we running
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; are we all coming to a finishing line
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; oh praise God could you let's continue
[1:17:50] so by faith what is faith we keep saying
[1:17:53] this but we want to get on with it
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; what is faith faith is something that's
[1:17:58] revealed to you that is not yet but you
[1:18:03] believe it will be.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, hear the stinger in it. Now,
[1:18:08] faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:18:11] God.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I want to put something onto that. The
[1:18:15] will of God to you.
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Not the church will of God. Well, the
[1:18:22] will of God fa to come to service this
[1:18:24] morning because don't don't forsake
[1:18:25] their destiny together. That that's
[1:18:26] fine. That's scripture. But I'm not
[1:18:27] talking about that. I'm talking about
[1:18:29] amidst the word, God will speak to you.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. about you.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Because faith is not given for somebody
[1:18:38] for you.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Faith is given to you.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You can't lend your faith.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; You could believe for others. You got to
[1:18:47] say, "Hold that. Hold that piece of
[1:18:48] faith." No. I perceive you have faith to
[1:18:51] be healed.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Rise up and walk in the name of Jesus.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; That man have faith inside of him.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; So, you have to look for God revealing
[1:19:00] to you his will. Because once you
[1:19:02] connect to the will of God for your life
[1:19:04] and you do it, you're free.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; When Elijah Faming time, he told woman
[1:19:11] when the woman bake me a cake first
[1:19:16] because God told Elijah,
[1:19:19] I have a w a woman there to feed thee
[1:19:22] there.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; It's family.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And I ordained a woman to feed you.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has studying how he going to
[1:19:30] look and what he thinking in his mind
[1:19:31] and what kind of fight election and that
[1:19:33] you know God say I ordain a will woman
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; to feed you.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; That is the anointing I release upon
[1:19:41] her.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; That is the power I release upon her.
[1:19:44] She doesn't even know it
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; that she's ordained.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; She is fixed for that. She is built for
[1:19:50] that. She could make a good bake.
[1:19:57] she could fix something just right
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; for this man of God.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; So when he get the word from the Lord, I
[1:20:06] ordain this woman to feed you.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; When he come there, he know it's famine.
[1:20:10] He said, "Bake me a cake first."
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Now God have to work on both sides. This
[1:20:19] man is anointed. He know the will of
[1:20:21] God. He know that woman purpose. This
[1:20:24] woman is being tested because she have a
[1:20:26] son. She have the last bit of oil. She
[1:20:29] have the last bit of flour. She was
[1:20:32] thinking that's the last meal. But this
[1:20:34] man of God come and say, "Take me a cake
[1:20:38] first." She put God first because she
[1:20:41] was hearing from God. She got a
[1:20:44] revelation. That's a genuine man of God.
[1:20:47] Oh, the Lord, I shout in the house.
[1:20:51] Oh,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; you may be seated.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And when that woman
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; turned, she had a choice, you know,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; say you old man, I ain't making no big
[1:21:00] for you. Is me and my son and my bacon
[1:21:03] dead.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; But when she turned
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; to obey,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; your flower not going to run down.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Your oil going to not fail until rain
[1:21:15] fall upon the earth. My God, I can see
[1:21:17] that woman when she dip for flour, she
[1:21:20] dip for flour. When she say she want
[1:21:22] some more flour, she add a little too
[1:21:25] much water. So she need some more flour
[1:21:27] to mix up with that water. She don't
[1:21:29] want no sy mixture. When she dip, there
[1:21:32] was flour there. When you dip, there
[1:21:34] going to be power there. When you dip,
[1:21:36] there going to be virtue there. There
[1:21:37] going to be faith there. There going to
[1:21:39] be knowledge and temperance and pain.
[1:21:40] Whatever you have need of, you want to
[1:21:42] just dip, it's going to be there. We
[1:21:45] heard from God. We heard thus sayeth the
[1:21:47] Lord.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; That is revelation.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Revelation doesn't make you behave
[1:22:00] differently.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Look at those four guys, those friends
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; who had the friend
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; and Jesus in a house and they come with
[1:22:08] a friend in a pallet
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and there was a press all around the
[1:22:11] house. They can't get around. They can't
[1:22:13] get back door, front door, crowd all
[1:22:16] around the house. But they come too far
[1:22:19] to turn back now. Too much of faith in
[1:22:21] this. I thought in this problem for so
[1:22:24] long it it could have friends like that.
[1:22:27] Friends that could carry you. When you
[1:22:29] can't carry yourself, God help us to get
[1:22:33] that kind of friend. When you can't
[1:22:35] carry yourself, there are some people
[1:22:37] just give up on you. Some people looking
[1:22:39] for you to fall. They're looking for you
[1:22:41] to fail. forget them. You will not fall.
[1:22:45] You will not fail. You're going to come
[1:22:47] true. Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:22:50] house.
[1:22:58] Hallelujah.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Be seated.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; The rest down the front of the pallet.
[1:23:05] Let me scout around to see how we can
[1:23:07] solve this thing
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; because we are moving.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; You see, faith doesn't take back down.
[1:23:11] Faith doesn't give up. Faith does scout.
[1:23:14] Faith does spy. Faith does walk. Faith
[1:23:18] does look for a way how to move this
[1:23:20] mountain. I don't let the mountain move
[1:23:22] or move through the mountain, but I'm
[1:23:24] not going to give up. I am sick, but I'm
[1:23:26] going to be healed. Praise God. I'm
[1:23:28] bound, but I'm going to be free. That's
[1:23:30] what faith does. Faith is militant.
[1:23:34] Faith doesn't back down. Faith don't
[1:23:36] give up. Oh, the Lord shouters in the
[1:23:38] house.
[1:23:46] Oh, glory.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; One man look up.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; He see roof.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; He see a soul up there.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Friend,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I get the answer.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; We're going up."
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Everybody going around.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; We're going up.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; We going higher.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; And they went higher and begin to rip
[1:24:05] off the roof. And they rip off the roof.
[1:24:07] All of a sudden Jesus is preaching roof
[1:24:09] moving and then the friends start to let
[1:24:11] down their friends. They are letting
[1:24:13] that down. They say, "Oh, you're sick.
[1:24:14] Go and take a doctor." They know that
[1:24:16] they coming for that. They let down that
[1:24:18] man because of the healer is there. The
[1:24:21] pillar of fire is there. They know power
[1:24:23] is there. They know supernatural is
[1:24:25] there. They know manifested son is
[1:24:27] there. And they know Jesus Christ is the
[1:24:29] same yesterday.
[1:24:34] Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] Look at that.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; That man came through the roof.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; And walk out the door.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Give the Lord a shout in
[1:24:48] the house.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Come through the roof.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Walk out the door.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Pick up your bed and walk.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Get out of that depression. Get out of
[1:24:59] that frustration. Open your mouth and
[1:25:02] make some Holy Ghost noise. What
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; you have a noisy bunch?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; You start to make enough noise yet.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Faith is a staggering thing, you know.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:35] It's faith that's faith is something
[1:25:37] else you know
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; faith is what make David said I'll cut
[1:25:40] your head off
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; how man could talk that talk
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; a young shepherd boy with sling
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; and stone
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; what gol I'll cut your head off
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; but that's what faith does
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; faith doesn't make you speak
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; praise God beyond what you
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah I am healed
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I am free
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; look look what the Bible says And let
[1:26:04] the weak say I am strong. Let the poor
[1:26:08] say I am rich.
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; So faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:26:18] God.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; I shall not die but live.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; That angel passing all around. Say go go
[1:26:24] go go take a trip
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; and God gave you a scripture. I shall
[1:26:28] not die
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; but live
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; because I still have a testimony
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; to give for God. That's what Simeon had.
[1:26:36] It was revealed to Simeon. He shall not
[1:26:38] see death until he see the Lord's
[1:26:41] Christ.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That angel waiting for him. And Simeon
[1:26:44] tell that angel, "No way.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; You can't touch me. Right now, you could
[1:26:49] only watch me. But until Messiah come,
[1:26:52] you can't touch me. My life is anointed.
[1:26:55] My life is appointed. My life is
[1:26:57] elected. My life is predestinated. My
[1:27:00] life is ordained. There is a purpose. I
[1:27:02] have to be a witness of Messiah. Messiah
[1:27:06] have to come to the temple.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; So what's something? Simeon can't be
[1:27:12] under expectation in his house with him
[1:27:14] as Messiah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; There is no promised Messiah coming to
[1:27:17] his house. He knows Messiah coming in
[1:27:19] the temple.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; So Simeon set himself up waiting in
[1:27:23] position. Simeon is sitting in place
[1:27:26] every service. He is rocking because he
[1:27:30] know that baby have to come to get
[1:27:32] offered up according to the law. So he
[1:27:35] know one day he don't know which day but
[1:27:39] he know one day Messiah
[1:27:42] going to come into the house. What if is
[1:27:45] today? What if is now? What if is you?
[1:27:50] He is coming to my brother. Oh could we
[1:27:54] shout? Do we shout in the house? And
[1:27:58] there is Simeon.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; God revealed it to him.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; No books,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; no elder.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; No prophet.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; No so-called apostle that they want to
[1:28:08] put themselves to be now.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Not them men.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; revealed to Simeon.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; No Mary, no intercessor, no nothing in
[1:28:20] between.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; re revealed to an old man.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; I like that old man. nearing a little a
[1:28:29] little a little banana peel fall inside
[1:28:31] the grave.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; My Jesus.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Old man
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and a man say I shall not die.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; But live
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; until Messiah come.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; 6 months pass every service. Aha. And
[1:28:46] Messiah will come. Maybe today
[1:28:48] expectation.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; One day
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; little lady
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; named Mary. She was about the 12th or
[1:28:54] 14th or 15th or 16th mother to pass by.
[1:28:57] Condemned there's not one baby born.
[1:28:59] There's many babies coming into the
[1:29:00] temple. And Mary just passing by. And as
[1:29:03] he passed by, watch this. As Mary passed
[1:29:06] by,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Simeon just feel the anointing come all
[1:29:09] over him. Holy Spirit upon him. This
[1:29:13] whole man
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; move now. And he start to move. He start
[1:29:16] to move. It have this mother. It have
[1:29:19] that mother. It have that mother. All
[1:29:21] them lined up with the baby. And he's
[1:29:23] passing this church. He's passing that
[1:29:24] church because he's looking for seven
[1:29:26] thunder baby. Looking for seven voices.
[1:29:28] Looking for seven mysteries. Looking for
[1:29:30] seven seals. Looking for seven spirits.
[1:29:35] Oh, do I hear a shout in the house,
[1:29:41] all these mothers lined up there, he
[1:29:43] went straight to Mary. Why? Why? The
[1:29:46] same spirit
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; that reveal it to him. That's right.
[1:29:49] It's the same spirit that direct him to
[1:29:51] the baby
[1:29:55] seated
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; to confirm it are no flukes.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; No flukes.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Glor
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; because in the mount of two or three
[1:30:05] witnesses
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; let everything be established.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That why you said don't receive an
[1:30:09] accusation against the elder.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; You have two witnesses and the witness
[1:30:13] have betrayed. I see this brother or I
[1:30:16] see this brother so and so and so. You
[1:30:17] have that two witnesses
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; to confirm if that is really so. And
[1:30:20] those two witnesses have to be tried.
[1:30:22] You're not even supposed to receive
[1:30:23] that.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Two witnesses at least.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Here come blind Anna. She's blind. So
[1:30:29] now you you have no excuse.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost could see.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost know exactly where Mary
[1:30:36] is.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Blind Anna. She can't see no baby, no
[1:30:38] mother. But she calling straight. No,
[1:30:40] no, no, no, no, no. Straight.
[1:30:43] straight to Mary
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; to confirm that's the Messiah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; When when when when Simeon finished, he
[1:30:50] say, "Lord, let this depart in peace
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; because the devil harassing me for so
[1:30:54] long. Now time up. I departed in peace.
[1:30:57] Bye-bye.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; My purpose is now accomplished. My
[1:31:00] purpose is now fulfilled. Oh, give the
[1:31:02] Lord some shout.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; God, I call you to give up, pack up, let
[1:31:06] go. God call you to be strong.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; God call you to overcome. Every child
[1:31:12] step on it.
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; I remember the story about the donkey.
[1:31:19] Somebody throw the donkey in a pit, kill
[1:31:21] the donkey and they go and bury the
[1:31:23] donkey and they keep throwing dirt on
[1:31:25] the donkey and the donkey jump up and
[1:31:26] stepping on it. Jumping and step jump
[1:31:29] and step on it. Dump and step on it
[1:31:31] until the donkey come out out the whole
[1:31:33] thing.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; The dirt come and bring leverage to get
[1:31:36] the donkey out. May all the what people
[1:31:39] throwing on may it become leverage.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You're going to shut the
[1:31:42] mouth of the critics.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes we will. Yes we
[1:31:46] will. I believe that with all my heart.
[1:31:49] I can't vindicate myself. God had to
[1:31:51] vindicate his sons and daughters.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and it looked like it was all over.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; But you made a way.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I am standing here,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; not sitting, standing
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; upon the promises of yours.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; I believe God really love you.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You don't know how much God loves you
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; because God chose you in this last day.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You're miserable. Yes. You're contrary
[1:32:27] sometimes. Yes. You're off key. Yes. But
[1:32:30] he still
[1:32:32] love you.
[1:32:35] Here's
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:42] why I have a drop. Am I in the spirit
[1:32:44] this morning?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Because course love is a parental love.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; You have two children, one miserable one
[1:32:50] thing. You love this one, you love this
[1:32:51] one, you love this strong. You're
[1:32:52] telling them you love everybody same.
[1:32:53] That whole talk.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; God love is not parental love.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; His love is elective love.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:04] He love you because he elect you.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; So I don't care what you have been
[1:33:07] through. God fight. Oh good. No God not
[1:33:10] on that.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; By the one of the well didn't fight in
[1:33:14] Jesus.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; How how much how much man you had? Well
[1:33:17] you had five. You want know yours. Okay
[1:33:19] I done. I gone.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; His love is elective.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; His love look for the gene behind the
[1:33:26] flesh.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Behind the spirit behind the short dress
[1:33:30] behind the drinks behind the smokes.
[1:33:32] behind the adultery, behind the
[1:33:33] fornication, behind all the death. He
[1:33:35] looking for the gene.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; So he could tell Peter come. Peter is a
[1:33:39] cusper. Peter is a fisherman. Peter know
[1:33:41] all the swear words.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; But that didn't stop Jesus from saying
[1:33:46] come.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; He was saying come to the sea.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; That seed have flesh on it.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That fear around it. But the seed
[1:33:54] coming.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Andrew come. Phillip come. Matthew come.
[1:34:00] Amen.
[1:34:05] [Applause]
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Now watch whether Matthew like Philillip
[1:34:10] and Philip hate Peter that has nothing
[1:34:12] to do with itise
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; because Matthew didn't call Philillip
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; is Jesus called every one of them.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; So they have to get over it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; They have to get over their issues
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; because God called all of them. It have
[1:34:27] many members
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; but one body.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And we are not the one calling the
[1:34:37] members because by one spirit,
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; we are baptized into that body and that
[1:34:44] body is the universal body of Jesus
[1:34:46] Christ.
[1:34:47] Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; So despite what minister think that the
[1:34:50] bride or the church belong to them and
[1:34:51] is their own and their wife and all kind
[1:34:53] of nonsense and I call it nonsense
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; besides what they think about the church
[1:34:58] my Bible teaches me he's head
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; of the body
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; called the church
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; not I am head he is head
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; it have a local body yes but this body
[1:35:09] that is Christ's body he is the head of
[1:35:11] that
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; and he is coming back for his body
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; he is coming back to connect to his And
[1:35:16] if you belong to the body, you have to
[1:35:18] get inside of there
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; by his spirit.
[1:35:21] [Applause]
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And we have a promise. Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That the church will be rebuilt.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; By the spirit.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; That's our promise.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After the ministry of the
[1:35:34] word, we'll have a time with the
[1:35:36] ministry of the spirit.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; So faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:35:41] God.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; What is faith? There's something that
[1:35:44] revealed to you that is not yet and you
[1:35:46] believe it will be.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation by the of the will
[1:35:50] of God. And the churches today don't
[1:35:52] believe in spiritual revelation. They
[1:35:54] believe in the dogmatic teaching of some
[1:35:58] system. So the people are very proud to
[1:36:01] testify what they believe and to tell
[1:36:04] you well we don't believe the same
[1:36:05] thing.
[1:36:07] A brother tell me what I preach on can't
[1:36:08] take nobody to no rapture. I said I
[1:36:10] never know what teaching taking the
[1:36:12] rapture. I thought was faith and virtue
[1:36:14] and knowledge. I thought was the life
[1:36:15] that God is taking up because magnet he
[1:36:17] say you have to be magnetized to the
[1:36:19] headstone. So when the magnet pass
[1:36:20] magnet picking up word and stone and
[1:36:22] paper the magnet taking what is
[1:36:24] magnetized to it.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; So they have to have a magnetism in you
[1:36:28] when the spirit capstone headstone come
[1:36:30] to pick you up with it.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; So you have to be magnetized to the
[1:36:34] headstone.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't say you have to join a church.
[1:36:36] No, you have to get magnetized. You have
[1:36:38] to get the magnetism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:40] inside of you. And then God when God get
[1:36:43] pick you up.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; There are difference in administration
[1:36:50] but the same spirit.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; My gift is different from other
[1:36:53] brothers.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Same spirit.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Different gifts different man uh
[1:36:59] administration and so on. But it's one
[1:37:02] spirit.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Even as there is one lord
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and one body.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to see the one body today.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Go beyond this group. Go beyond this
[1:37:12] church. See one body
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and see you have to get into that body.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; That is your destination
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; to be placed into the body of Christ.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You can't place yourself and I can't
[1:37:22] place you.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; The God who called you have to place you
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; in that body by his spirit.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And when God places you, nobody could
[1:37:29] unplace you.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; David knew his position.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; That why David could ride the way he

[1:37:38] David wives. He come fighting tired and
[1:37:42] David place burned down. They take the
[1:37:43] wise and go and David men were angry
[1:37:45] with him because they want to know how
[1:37:47] your leaders to fight and what to come
[1:37:49] back your your home get lick up
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; and David went into prayer. Lord should
[1:37:54] I pursue?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Or should I stay and
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; God tell him pursue.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Watch this. God send lightning and kill
[1:38:01] them fellow.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; But this is David property now.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; This is wife. This is family. This is
[1:38:08] inheritance. This is your portion. This
[1:38:10] is the land. God said pursue.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; He tired but he had to pursue.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; He ried whole night. Whole night
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; and then cut themselves off and take
[1:38:18] take them out and bring back his own
[1:38:20] family.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what God want you to
[1:38:22] do.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; David was only an example.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; I say pursue.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Don't give the devil any room.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Don't tell him that small is all right.

[1:44:49] and that's a gift brother Brandham had
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; to step into somebody's sho he was in
[1:44:53] India and the people worship the son and
[1:44:54] so on there was a guy that was blind and
[1:44:56] he had no shoes on his feet
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; and the first thing brother Brandham did
[1:45:00] was to put his foot to see if his shoe
[1:45:02] size could fit him
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; you want to give him his shoes
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; you have to be able to enter into the
[1:45:06] person's suffering
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; that is how you could pray for somebody
[1:45:10] that's why sometime you go through
[1:45:11] suffering yourself that when you hear
[1:45:13] about somebody suffering you could enter
[1:45:14] into him because you have been

[1:45:18] that struggle. You have had that
[1:45:20] condition and you could be empathized to
[1:45:23] that person.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Step into their shoes.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Other than that, sit down and criticize
[1:45:28] and complain about their work. I I was

[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; And I s say Lord have mercy upon me.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just Mr. Sinner. Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that man outside is more
[1:45:46] righteous than the man inside.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; But we need to come back to humility.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The first sign of the
[1:45:51] Holy Ghost is humility.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Because it's God made a way for you.

[1:45:58] you this freedom and his liberty. I am
[1:45:59] free this morning. I have no enemy
[1:46:01] outside. I have no minister fighting
[1:46:03] outside. I have nobody give me a big
[1:46:05] fight. I have I have my own fight, my
[1:46:06] own self. I fight him with it. I have
[1:46:09] nobody out there to give me fight. You
[1:46:11] understand what I'm saying? Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. If anybody is my enemy that that
[1:46:15] that is their business. They make theel
[1:46:17] enemy. But as far as I concerned, the
[1:46:19] enemy is the devil.
[1:46:20] [Applause]
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I am loving this gospel.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And I am loving the brethren.

[1:46:32] right now, if I tell you,
[1:46:36] Lord have mercy. And that's why I
[1:46:38] enjoyed the trial so much.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Because I was pushed into my destiny.
[1:46:43] Oh hallelujah
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; push. I mean push.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:49] No I'm not Joseph. I give him a point.
[1:46:51] Right. When Joseph brethren get in fight
[1:46:53] with him because he's spiritual and he
[1:46:56] father love him. Bible said that make
[1:46:58] him a special coat.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Rainbow kind.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Seven color.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Not one color kind.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Seven.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Seven colors with that loud. You know
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; you know I mean you could see it from a
[1:47:10] mile. You know that that's a loud kind
[1:47:12] of quote. When you see that quote, you
[1:47:13] know Joseph coming.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; That quote alone said Joseph coming not
[1:47:16] one of the brethren like Joseph coming.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; So he was titled labeled positionally
[1:47:21] placed Joseph
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; rainbow coat. When you get that close
[1:47:25] get big fight
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; this is not outside people outside you
[1:47:29] know this is his own brethren
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; get big fight because of revelation
[1:47:33] inspiration vision prophecy upon that
[1:47:36] man's life.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; We had to get rid of this man yet.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Father love expressing too
[1:47:41] much. Father love, Father, I can't help
[1:47:42] it. Father, Joseph represent perfection.
[1:47:46] Joseph represent God. It's too much.
[1:47:49] Decide to sell him out. Okay. They sell
[1:47:51] him out to Egypt. They say they kill
[1:47:53] him.
[1:47:54] They only sell him.
[1:47:57] But they they take the lamb skin and
[1:48:00] come with blood and bring Joseph coat
[1:48:01] and sell the coat bloody and whatnot and
[1:48:03] he dead. He dead. He dead. Oh, they know
[1:48:05] they kill the brother. So they don't
[1:48:06] have no murder in upon the spirit. She
[1:48:08] say you murder the brother.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; We just make him disappear.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; We just make him move out of our
[1:48:15] conscious thinking. We move him out from
[1:48:17] there. So as far as they're concerned,
[1:48:18] the father gather they he won't stop to
[1:48:21] grieve. Father
[1:48:23] heart and joy gone. Joseph balling. He
[1:48:26] can't believe it. Now Joseph horror is
[1:48:28] to believe his own brother's dream.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; So Joseph in a real devastated
[1:48:34] comfort. Yes,
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; he's inconsolable
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; cuz I mean if somebody outside do you
[1:48:39] something that's one thing when your own
[1:48:41] brother take you and throw you out to
[1:48:42] the Egyptian is Egyptian talking about
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; it's is caravan pirates of the desert
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; taking Joseph to send out to Egypt
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; so Joseph afterwards time does bring
[1:48:53] heal hurts and different things
[1:48:55] afterward Joseph settled himself you
[1:48:57] know this is what it is
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; but you see the condition didn't change
[1:49:00] who he was
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; and what he was placed to do
[1:49:05] What the brethren did not understand, he
[1:49:08] was pushed
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; into his destiny
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; by that rejection,
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; by that condition, by that trial, by
[1:49:18] whatever you're going through. So stop
[1:49:20] looking at what you're going through as
[1:49:22] a negative.
[1:49:23] Understand what Romans 8:20 is about.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; For we know
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; all,
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; somebody say all. Oh,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; all things work together
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; for good
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; to them that love God
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; to them who are be called
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Joseph tears,
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Joseph pain is petty and small compared
[1:49:48] to the burdensome task he had to save
[1:49:52] the world.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing you.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Famine is coming.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; No one knows about it.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; You may be seasoned.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; All right. Joseph had the gift to
[1:50:03] interpret dreams
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; because God is a revealer of secrets.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; So God pushed Joseph in that situation
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; waiting for this appointed time.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Joseph not ready yet
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; because he's a for gardener.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; He's not ready yet.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; He had to get a promotion to be made
[1:50:19] ready.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; So he's doing gardening.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Then he get a promotion to to be in
[1:50:25] charge of the house. And Pifer wife
[1:50:27] wanted Joseph to be in charge of her
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; and Joseph run for his life.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; She felt agrieved. And then Joseph end
[1:50:34] up in prison.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; He's getting ready. He's not ready yet.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Watch this. He is sold.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; He gone to Egypt.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; He's an ex-man land. He gone from
[1:50:45] gardener. He's doing well.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; He get promoted. He run from the man
[1:50:49] wife. He's still do. He is in prisoner.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I guess if there was critics
[1:50:54] in Joseph time, dear Joseph,
[1:50:59] what have you done
[1:51:01] to be in the condition you are in? I
[1:51:04] recognize disaster keep following you.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Like you're under a bad luck.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; I think you're under the wrong teaching.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; You know, you could you could imagine
[1:51:17] now David Joseph, he's there, but the
[1:51:20] gift is working. Bottle of baker. Baker
[1:51:23] condemned, butler restored. He tell the
[1:51:25] butler, "Remember me." But the butler
[1:51:26] not going to remember him because the
[1:51:28] time is not yet.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; When the time is right, God give Pharaoh
[1:51:31] a dream that he can remember.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; And then Pharaoh called all the wise men
[1:51:37] to say, "Listen, listen. Come tell me
[1:51:38] tell me to interpret the dream." They
[1:51:39] said, "That's a dream." He said, "I
[1:51:40] can't remember the dream."
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Then they say, "We we can't do that. We
[1:51:46] we need the dream to interpret it." He
[1:51:48] said, "All only asking for time." He
[1:51:50] said cut all all your head off.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; I didn't say I'm a wise man. All you see
[1:51:54] all is wise men. Hallelujah.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; All you see all your spiritual. All you
[1:51:57] see all the ind mysteries of all these
[1:51:59] kind of thing. Come on now. So tell me
[1:52:01] my dream and interpret it too.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Not only he said gather all the wise men
[1:52:06] in the country. That where they pick up
[1:52:07] Joseph.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Gather all the wise men. And that would
[1:52:11] Joseph get caught up in that whole move.
[1:52:12] Jesus tell the king hold on. There's a
[1:52:14] God that reveals secrets.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Give
[1:52:18] me. And then what happened? It unfold.
[1:52:20] It reveal and next minute Joseph is
[1:52:22] promoted
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; to be next to Pharaoh.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Famine in all the land.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Brethren hungry.
[1:52:30] Bre had to go to Egypt.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Joseph next to Pharaoh.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Joseph is the man.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And what happened? They had to come bow.
[1:52:40] Joseph said, "I am Joseph your brother
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; whom you sold.
[1:52:47] Hallelujah.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Then then then listen to these amazing
[1:52:52] words. God
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; sent me ahead.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't say all you nearly kill me.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; I nearly dead on that journey and all
[1:53:01] your too hardness. All your wicked no
[1:53:03] weak for all your No, he didn't talk.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; He said God
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; send me ahead
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; to preserve life.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Now what you're hearing is the right
[1:53:14] spirit. What you hearing is the the
[1:53:17] Christ attitude.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; What you hearing is what we supposed to
[1:53:20] be hearing.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Not oh God, she do me. He do me. No.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; God allow things.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; There's a higher purpose.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; As long as you stay around what this one
[1:53:32] do and that one do, you miss the will of
[1:53:34] God.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; You miss the vision of God.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You see Samson, Samson backside went
[1:53:39] with Elila. Samson eyes dug out. But
[1:53:41] there's a higher purpose behind that.
[1:53:43] God want to place Samson behind the
[1:53:45] enemy lines.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; God want to take out 3,000 Philistines.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Samson always looking up a 10 here, a
[1:53:50] two here. Is 3,000 going to be in that.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; God want to deal with them in a big way.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; So God sent something through a process
[1:53:58] positionally place him. He said one
[1:54:00] small Lord
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; send out your power.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; This is a son on the line.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; These brothers had revelation.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; It wasn't permanently back. Backsliding
[1:54:11] is only temporary. Oh God, you don't let
[1:54:13] me start to preach this morning.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Don't let me start to preach here this
[1:54:17] morning. Backslitting is only temporary.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother,
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; they have no permanent backsliding in
[1:54:28] God. Check that out.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Is that your son? Are you a not a son?
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; If a son always a son.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; God had delivered David. God had
[1:54:38] delivered Solomon. All them brothers had
[1:54:40] the issues Noah all of them but they
[1:54:42] were sons
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; back only temporary you know
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; because Nebuchadnezzar will come for you
[1:54:50] sir hallelujah
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; you didn't get that one
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; when Israel backslide always have some
[1:54:55] king Nebuchadnezzar to take them into
[1:54:56] captivity
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; and then they go cry and ball and then
[1:54:59] go come and deliver them
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; that's the whole story of the Bible
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; God bless them they power and the
[1:55:04] anointing and glory afterward the heart
[1:55:05] get cold
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; when the heart get cold pressure then
[1:55:09] and they backslide, they get lukewarm,
[1:55:11] they get cold, and then some king come
[1:55:12] of Babylon and decide to punish them.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Until they repent.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; God has to wait till he hear the cries
[1:55:18] of the people. They wasn't crying, you
[1:55:19] know.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; They was working for Pharaoh.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; You see, you could be in a condition and
[1:55:24] you're working for Pharaoh
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; because you're not complaining, you're
[1:55:27] not desperate, just doing your thing.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; But then when you get fed up,
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; and they get tired.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; That you begin to groan in your spirit.
[1:55:35] Lord, this is not the way to live. This
[1:55:37] is not a Christian life. This is not the
[1:55:39] way for me to walk and talk and behave.
[1:55:41] Why I am cursing, why I'm doing this,
[1:55:44] why I'm doing things contrary to the
[1:55:45] word and your will. This is not right.
[1:55:47] Lord, I'm crying out unto you. Then he
[1:55:48] go, I heard your cry.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; I'm coming down now to deliver.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; I giving a special service.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm bringing a special
[1:55:55] uncction
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; to get them demons off of your life.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It's happening now.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; It's happening right now.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody's been delivered right now.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; I believe in that. Somebody going free
[1:56:07] right now.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; I believe in that.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody being healed right now.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I believe in that.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We have to come and
[1:56:16] expect the supernatural.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Watch.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about Paul. Paul.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire hit down Paul. was
[1:56:34] Saul and he was fighting the church,
[1:56:36] fighting the revelation, everything else
[1:56:38] and he didn't know he was seed.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; All he know he's zealous for the
[1:56:42] Pharisee doctrine. You go as far as
[1:56:45] concerned this church is a crazy church
[1:56:47] follow this man called Jesus. So there
[1:56:49] is Paul Saul rather riding on his high
[1:56:51] horse pill of fire and knock him off and
[1:56:53] he bought thou Lord right away he know
[1:56:56] who is that
[1:56:58] Paul only knew him by revelation.
[1:57:00] Peter knew him by revelation. He walked
[1:57:03] with him, talked with him. Therefore,
[1:57:06] you can set this word. Now, I've said
[1:57:08] that he was the word. A scholar can sit
[1:57:10] down, listen carefully, and read that
[1:57:13] word till it just tie your mind up in
[1:57:15] any way if he wants to. Smart,
[1:57:18] brilliant, and so on. He said a real
[1:57:20] trained theologian can do that. Brother,
[1:57:21] a Baptist, Presbyterian, he'll make you
[1:57:23] think you don't know nothing. But the
[1:57:26] only way you are saved is to know him by
[1:57:31] revelation.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; If I can take the Presbyterian doctrine
[1:57:35] and tie you Pentecostal up till you
[1:57:37] don't know, I can take the Baptist
[1:57:38] doctrine and show you Pentecostal a
[1:57:39] million things you don't know nothing
[1:57:40] of. That's right. But that is not his
[1:57:42] church.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; So being able to expound scriptures and
[1:57:46] teaching and tie people up, that's not
[1:57:48] the church.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; His church is himself revealed.
[1:57:59] Amen.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; It's not a building.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; It's not a group of people. His church,
[1:58:07] which is the bride, is really Christ. In
[1:58:09] other words, Christ is God revealed.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; The church is Christ revealed.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; So the church really revealed Jesus
[1:58:19] Christ.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; So, so, so that's why you hear me say
[1:58:26] often about write the vision, make it
[1:58:28] plain.
[1:58:29] And that the word as it begin to unfold
[1:58:32] supposed to bring clarity,
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; not more confusion.
[1:58:36] And when you see the real vision, the
[1:58:40] prophetic vision, the real core of the
[1:58:43] message, the rest is filler material.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; And compared to somebody giving you a
[1:58:47] gift in a bag, nice pretty bag and have
[1:58:50] the paper around it and let's say a
[1:58:52] little drink or something like that
[1:58:53] inside. The bag is not a gift. The paper
[1:58:56] around it is not a gift. is a steady it.
[1:58:59] The paper around it is filled material.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; So even though it's there, it looks
[1:59:03] nice, the real thing is in the middle.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; That's what it's about.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; The Jews have their place. I could place
[1:59:10] about Jews and talk about Jews and talk
[1:59:11] about Jews, but that doesn't help me.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; I could talk about Los Angeles, that
[1:59:15] doesn't help me.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I could talk about the pope, that
[1:59:18] doesn't help me.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; There are many things in the scriptures
[1:59:21] that is what God said, but doesn't apply
[1:59:23] to you.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; It have about the tribulation. It all
[1:59:27] about vials. It all about wars. It all
[1:59:29] about wars. It have all kind of stuff
[1:59:31] inside of there. But what we want is the
[1:59:33] promises that become effective to us
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; to face the challenge that is in our
[1:59:39] lives
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; and to face the challenge that is yet
[1:59:42] before us
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; because the devil not sitting still. The
[1:59:45] devil is open up his treasures
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; to looses on the earth.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; When Bar had the Beatles and he said
[1:59:51] hell has been the little of hell have
[1:59:53] uncovered and streams of demon psing
[1:59:55] out. That's right.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; God doing so much more with virtual
[1:59:58] reality and all the televisions and
[2:00:00] baram says when it's time to go mad and
[2:00:01] nuts it's on the television.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; So they putting avenues and channel for
[2:00:05] demon powers to come through that
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; witches and witch doctors and all the
[2:00:09] children story and all kind of stuff
[2:00:11] they pushing inside of that
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; to poison people mind.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Are you with me?
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All the foods and all is to help
[2:00:19] break down the human body. Break down
[2:00:21] the human mind.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yes yes yes. So Baram says we are
[2:00:26] striving to enter the kingdom of God
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; before these plagues strike.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; I hope you get a burden you know
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; I got a burden of the word you know
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; because we have children we have
[2:00:37] grandchildren we have family and so on
[2:00:39] and we see diseases and destruction and
[2:00:41] all kind of things coming
[2:00:44] [Applause]
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; but I'm talking about adopted sons
[2:00:48] pushing back this and pushing back that
[2:00:50] and stopping diseases and stopping
[2:00:51] cancer because it would be necessary to
[2:00:53] do it.
[2:00:55] Because Satan have a mission to kill
[2:00:57] all.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Are you with me?
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; He want to destroy your life.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to Jesus.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, he said
[2:01:10] someone said to me when I come out of my
[2:01:12] great trials after I lost my wife, baby,
[2:01:15] and everything said, "Brother Brandham,
[2:01:16] did you keep your religion during that
[2:01:18] time?" I said, "No, sir. It kept me
[2:01:20] during that time."
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Is what is this for? I can't keep
[2:01:25] Christ. He keeps me.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; It isn't whether I hang on, it's whether
[2:01:29] he held on.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; It's a gift to me.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; And then noticing that people have this
[2:01:34] hard time. There's got to be something
[2:01:36] wrong somewhere. If the Christian
[2:01:38] religion, watch, here we go, only
[2:01:40] consists of a declaration of creed,
[2:01:44] denomination or intellectuals, then we
[2:01:47] don't need nothing but real good, smart
[2:01:49] group of people.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; That's all we need.
[2:01:53] If that's the church, the church is is
[2:01:56] governed by intellectuals.
[2:01:58] Now, intellectual is all right. You can
[2:02:00] receive the word intellectually, but let
[2:02:02] it soak through to the heart and then it
[2:02:05] begin to get re results.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; So, the result is not just hearing it.
[2:02:09] The result is when you allow this word
[2:02:12] to soak through.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:14] Now, if God meant for us to run his
[2:02:18] church by denominationals or by creeds,
[2:02:20] then the only thing we need is the
[2:02:22] intelligence of a man.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Smarter the man, better the church. But
[2:02:28] that's not God's program.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go down further?
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; God's program was for the Holy Ghost to
[2:02:35] run the church.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was given for the church.
[2:02:41] Now, we can't have two faculties running
[2:02:43] the church at the same time.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; If man runs it, Holy Ghost goes out.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; That's a big one.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; That's a massive one.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; If man is running, Holy Ghost gone.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost runs it, usually the
[2:02:58] man goes out.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; It's one or the other.
[2:03:01] [Applause]
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Sometime meet a believer, meet some
[2:03:06] brother, meet somebody, and I'm
[2:03:07] listening. I'm hearing the testimony.
[2:03:11] I'm listening with a keen ear of what is
[2:03:13] the emphasis. And most time the emphasis
[2:03:15] their church and their pastor.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; I'm looking to hear Christ. I'm looking
[2:03:19] to hear the vision. I'm looking here the
[2:03:22] headstone, the target. I'm looking to
[2:03:24] hear beyond denomination, beyond group,
[2:03:25] beyond. I'm looking to hear that.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; No. First question, what church you
[2:03:30] fellowship in? What church you going to?
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Now they're asking that because they
[2:03:33] have a a judgment line on that. So
[2:03:35] according to where you say they react
[2:03:38] and oh you going there oh right right
[2:03:40] right right right right right right
[2:03:40] right right right right right right
[2:03:40] right right right right right right
[2:03:40] right right they off
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; even though they don't say that that's
[2:03:44] the behavior that's the reaction they
[2:03:46] don't want to know about you life and
[2:03:48] brother but Ram says you don't discern
[2:03:49] the church you discern the spirit and
[2:03:51] the man
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; you don't discern the man group
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; you doing the spirit and individual you
[2:03:56] can't judge somebody inside there by one
[2:03:57] person
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; I look at who how they behave
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; you have to judge somebody by the spirit
[2:04:03] in them
[2:04:06] Sometime they tell but ra sister behind
[2:04:08] the organ she just a little short. She
[2:04:10] said but he said but she have a fine
[2:04:11] spirit.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; He bust them
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; because they wash and she dress
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; but they have long dress and terrible
[2:04:18] spirit.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; But they will look and say well she she
[2:04:21] dressed not long enough. You you
[2:04:23] understand what I'm saying?
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; So at the end of it all it has to be a
[2:04:26] discernment. What is the person's motive
[2:04:29] and the person's objective?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. Do you love him? Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; So, it isn't what the church needs. I'll
[2:04:36] tell you what the church needs. It needs
[2:04:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; It needs the power of the living God.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; A revival doesn't go to and make new
[2:04:44] members. A revival means to revive what
[2:04:47] you already got.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Now, now a backslider backslide from
[2:04:51] something. Something was in him and God
[2:04:54] could always activate that.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; So, we have to pray for backsliders.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; We have to pray for their deliverance
[2:04:59] and their breakthrough
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; because his demon powers hold them
[2:05:02] captive. But Ram says what the preacher
[2:05:04] does is cast devils out of people and
[2:05:06] people receive the Lord.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; So understand the people have devils on
[2:05:09] them. Sometime religious devils,
[2:05:11] enticing spirits,
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; but when it get broken off then they get
[2:05:14] free.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Then they could worship. They could
[2:05:16] honor God.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Could you take some more?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Unto the church of Smy, right? These
[2:05:24] things said the first and the last which
[2:05:26] was dead and alive. Notice every time he
[2:05:28] introduced himself, he put forth
[2:05:31] something of his deity.
[2:05:32] of who he is.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; I am God. I change not. I'm claiming who
[2:05:36] I am. I'm the first and the last. This
[2:05:38] is brother Brown. Now watch. Now Smyrna
[2:05:41] means bitterness. It comes from the
[2:05:43] words my first church had lost its first
[2:05:47] love. Ephesians church. The church had
[2:05:49] begun to get a root of bitterness coming
[2:05:51] up in them because the main church, the
[2:05:54] big part, here we go. The majority of
[2:05:58] them was hammering against the Holy
[2:06:01] Ghost ruling in the church.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; They wanted to rule themselves.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; They wanted to set up a priesthood. They
[2:06:10] wanted to act like the Old Testament
[2:06:13] people did. They wanted priests.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; My man,
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; our man of the hour. We know we are it
[2:06:21] because we have this man.
[2:06:24] like one brother claiming to have the
[2:06:25] whole five-fold. It's unscriptural. God
[2:06:29] put gifts, different gifts, different
[2:06:31] gifts, different administration,
[2:06:33] different men and so on. One man can
[2:06:35] have the whole five-fold.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Now, they have to say that in order to
[2:06:39] be it in order to they don't need
[2:06:42] anybody else, but that's not what the
[2:06:44] Bible teaches. Because I'm a hand, I
[2:06:46] have no need of the foot. That can't
[2:06:48] teach that. I'm the eye. I have no need
[2:06:51] of the nose. Because if we begin to
[2:06:53] realize that we are members of that
[2:06:55] body, then we need each other.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; And we cannot do like if we are the only
[2:07:00] pebble on the beach.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; We cannot do like if we are the only
[2:07:04] members of that body.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; We need the nose. We need a mouth. We
[2:07:08] need the ears. We need the eyes. We need
[2:07:10] all the body parts. Even those part that
[2:07:12] are not humbly.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; We need every part of the body.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; So that is why God hates the attitude. I
[2:07:19] am right. You are wrong. I am it. You
[2:07:21] are not. I have it. You don't have it.
[2:07:23] God hates that.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why God hate the nicolatan
[2:07:26] spirit that beats the people into and
[2:07:29] pulverize them just to be in subjection
[2:07:31] to some man
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; for some bishop or some archbishop or
[2:07:35] some pope to take rule
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; because God is the head of the church.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; And you have to recognize yourself as
[2:07:41] the body.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; And as you get in that body, you become
[2:07:44] part of that whole movement.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; And there's a part in that body for you.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; And your part nobody else could take.
[2:07:51] Your part nobody could replace.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; No part nobody can substitute for you.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; You are in God part of God.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; So what happened out from the pagan
[2:08:05] churches they had Jupiter priest Venus
[2:08:06] and so forth and they wanted to bring
[2:08:08] them same thing to make these men. This
[2:08:12] church had began to spring up a root of
[2:08:14] bitterness. Why? It was bitter
[2:08:18] against those who want to continue on
[2:08:21] with the Holy Ghost. The love had faded
[2:08:24] away and they were trying to swap it
[2:08:26] with creeds and denominations getting
[2:08:30] away from Holy Ghost leadership. So you
[2:08:32] swap it for teachings, mysteries, more
[2:08:34] doctrine, more knowledge, more
[2:08:36] information. So I know a whole lot up
[2:08:38] here and that makes me better than you
[2:08:41] who don't have much up here. But yet
[2:08:46] God, here we go, bypassed the Pharisees
[2:08:49] and scribes who were scriptural based
[2:08:51] people.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; To get fishermen who couldn't read and
[2:08:54] write.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Proven when God ready to work, he don't
[2:08:59] need read and write.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; He need a right heart. Hallelujah.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Because God have gifts of knowledge,
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; gifts of wisdom,
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; gifts of discernment
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; that he could give to somebody without
[2:09:16] read and write.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the
[2:09:21] house?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; God could drop down upon you a gift of
[2:09:26] wisdom?
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; God could drop upon you a gift of
[2:09:30] knowledge.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will give you a gift of
[2:09:32] discernment. Yes, sir.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe that?
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; So they watch. Uhhuh. Could we take a
[2:09:38] little more?
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; So watch the root of bitterness start
[2:09:41] creeping in and they thought they were
[2:09:44] right. Right. And they had something
[2:09:45] dignified. The great woman people would
[2:09:47] come in. They had a pope. They had great
[2:09:49] men, cardinals and so forth. They
[2:09:51] dressed fine. They got away from all the
[2:09:54] noise
[2:09:55] and everything. They had
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; very quiet.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and show they were dying.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; That's why I said we don't have enough
[2:10:02] noise.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. When people get away
[2:10:05] from the noise, they get quiet
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; because they're trying to hear and
[2:10:09] they're dependent. They're writing notes
[2:10:10] and writing notes and writing notes. I
[2:10:12] say when you go home, listen back and
[2:10:13] write all your notes you want. When you
[2:10:15] come to church here, worship because you
[2:10:16] want to be in the spirit
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; because in the spirit is where you're
[2:10:20] getting divine revelation.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; If you're not in the spirit, you're only
[2:10:24] hearing intellectually. But in the
[2:10:25] spirit, God could speak to you. Wait a
[2:10:27] minute. Cuz sometimes I be doing
[2:10:29] something, all of a sudden I feel the
[2:10:30] warmth of the Holy Ghost come over me.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel anointed. I don't
[2:10:34] know what it's for yet, but I feel the
[2:10:35] presence of God. Like I just step into
[2:10:37] the room and I feel the anointing of God
[2:10:39] and I know he wants to direct me to
[2:10:40] something and I I see what meditation
[2:10:42] upon my heart. It's the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Afterwards, the Holy Ghost come, the
[2:10:46] Holy Ghost goes. You know, the witness
[2:10:47] of the spirit comes and goes and so like
[2:10:49] that to tell you what to do, what to
[2:10:50] say, how to operate.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometime I'm tired, I go
[2:10:54] take a rest and right as I resting like
[2:10:56] a vision come, like inspiration come and
[2:10:58] I see all what to put where, where to
[2:11:00] put the quotes and everything else
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; and my mind is be totally blown.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; So I come on a while here seeing this
[2:11:06] unfold and I'm stunned
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; to see what the Lord put together.
[2:11:10] Hallelujah.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you something that I
[2:11:12] never tell it before.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; And I avoid telling this kind of thing
[2:11:16] because know why
[2:11:22] scared of people
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; trying to make you a God.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Some people claiming to be God already.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; That just scares me. Oh, hallelujah. But
[2:11:33] Abraham, stop preaching for that, you
[2:11:34] know.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; They're trying to make him Jesus Christ.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; He was so much like Christ. They thought
[2:11:38] he was Jesus Christ. No people claim to
[2:11:40] be the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; It is insane.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. So they got away from the
[2:11:46] noise. They were dying. They were
[2:11:48] dignified. They made a body uh um what?
[2:11:52] But the whole thing was just ical. So
[2:11:54] when they get away from the real
[2:11:55] revelation, you see because Baron says
[2:11:57] revelation brings stimulation.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Revelation can't be you shaking your
[2:12:02] head.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; T of revelation that you hearing.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Faith come by hearing. you're hearing.
[2:12:09] That's mental faith. But when it's
[2:12:11] revealed, aha, you jump out.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; You might walk downstairs and drink some
[2:12:14] water and come back up because it's so
[2:12:16] exciting. You have to stand up. You have
[2:12:17] to do something. You can't sit still
[2:12:19] with revelation.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation make the prophet run a tree.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Because revelation is wine.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Word is water.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; You can't get head from drinking water.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; You can get head from drinking wine.
[2:12:37] Yes, sir.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Because wine brings stimulation.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; That's when the upper room, they were
[2:12:41] staggering
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; like drunk men.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was all over them.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; It was the wine of revelation.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Say it after me. Wine of revelation.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Wine of revelation.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; What was Jesus first miracle? He turned
[2:12:55] water into
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe God could give you a
[2:13:03] miracle this morning
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; and turn what you are hearing into a
[2:13:06] revelation.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; It brings stimulation.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; It have the same effect as natural wine
[2:13:12] on a man.
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Natural man will be eyes glassy and they
[2:13:20] talking and they smiling, smiling,
[2:13:22] smiling.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; They just me vexing hard face and all
[2:13:25] that no wine. He just drink some water
[2:13:27] and the water was wasn't tasting good.
[2:13:29] When a man in wonder the wine anointing
[2:13:32] smiling and talking and want to talk to
[2:13:34] talk scripture and all
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; you know wine
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; when when that wine of revelation hit
[2:13:40] your spirit it raises you up
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; look at Samson look at Samson when
[2:13:47] Samson they say we stand some sport they
[2:13:49] want to make entertainment of all the
[2:13:51] person they bring out is a blind man who
[2:13:52] once had power once destroy the
[2:13:54] Philistine they bring to embarrass him
[2:13:56] and shame him and God is not in that
[2:13:58] you're not going to embarrass Amen.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; You're not going to shame God.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; So here it is. He's coming out now.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Come on out.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; He know all them fellas, the crowd out
[2:14:06] there.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Bring on Samson. A little boy leading
[2:14:09] him.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Leading him.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; And Samson got revelation. He got
[2:14:13] inspiration. But Ram said Samson saw the
[2:14:16] possibility
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; that God could come back upon him.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; That was that was the courage.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; So every step he was going into destiny.
[2:14:27] Amen.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Every step he was going into position
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; to accomplish the purpose of God. Every
[2:14:33] step carefully made
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Samson is walking. He tell the boy,
[2:14:36] "Lead me to the post.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Lead me. Lead me between the pillars.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Put me there." Little boy leading him.
[2:14:43] And when he stand between the pillars,
[2:14:44] they're looking for entertainment.
[2:14:45] Samson put his hands between the
[2:14:47] pillars.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what was coming.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; The Philistine wasn't expecting that.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; A prayer
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; from a son of God.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; That once was backsliden. that's once
[2:14:57] failed,
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; that once fell,
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; that everybody was mocking,
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; everybody was talking about, but he was
[2:15:05] in a different position today.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; He was in a position to call upon God.
[2:15:09] He's in a position to say, "Once more,
[2:15:10] Lord, let me die." Ah
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; with the Philistines.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; He was willing to pay the price. He was
[2:15:18] willing to go all the way. And the power
[2:15:20] came upon that man. And he pushed it
[2:15:23] down. and more died in his death than
[2:15:26] Samson in his life.
[2:15:28] Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord a shout.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; So, don't count nobody out.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Don't write nobody off.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; There is only one body.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; And we are members of that body.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praise out of
[2:15:46] here.
[2:15:49] Hallelujah.
[2:15:50] [Applause]
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:53] Oh, glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:15:56] Hallelujah.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So you got to
[2:15:58] understand now. God don't want no schism
[2:16:01] in the body.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; God want the body wholesome.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; So when people get in conditions, God is
[2:16:06] concerned. But there are people in the
[2:16:08] body and then people out of the body.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; You want to be in the body.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; In the body means being in Christ.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; In Christ, you're a new creator.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; You're a new creation. Everything
[2:16:18] becomes new in Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Your problems get different because
[2:16:22] you're in Christ.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Then you understand Romans 8:28. You
[2:16:25] understand how all things work together
[2:16:27] for good.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; David was anointed to be king because
[2:16:32] God told Samuel, "I have rejected Saul."
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Go and anoint a son of Jesse to be king
[2:16:39] over Israel.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; So when Samuel put the anointing oil
[2:16:43] upon David, he was anointed there and
[2:16:45] then to be king.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; He wasn't ready yet. He wasn't mature
[2:16:49] yet. He wasn't trained yet. He wasn't in
[2:16:52] power yet. But he was anointed.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God have to
[2:16:58] anoint you before you are placed.
[2:17:03] Come on now. Come on. Give the Lord a
[2:17:06] shout.
[2:17:14] Hallelujah.
[2:17:19] Hallelujah.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:17:24] [Applause]
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Before you could be placed,
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; you have to be anointed.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; My God.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; God want David inside the palace.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; The same day David get anointed, evil
[2:17:43] spirit fall upon Saul. They say music
[2:17:45] just send them spirits off,
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; cast the spirit out.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; They say who could play music? They say
[2:17:50] have a man named David. He real good.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; He played the harp.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; All that is God arranging, pulling David
[2:17:57] into the
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; into this whole thing.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; So David comes into the palace.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Playing music for Saul.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; The palace he going to rule in.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; The palace he going to reign in.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; The palace he going to walk in.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; David is in the palace.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Saul is clueless. Amen.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; He's He's retrenched and don't even know
[2:18:17] it.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; He is fired and don't even know it.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; He's still preaching, still teaching,
[2:18:22] but he's fired.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Because God have a David ready.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; It's only a matter of time.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; For that David to come forth.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And it's only a matter
[2:18:33] of time for you to come forth.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; I know you some of you doubting you will
[2:18:37] come forth.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because God relying upon you
[2:18:40] because you doubting you. God relying
[2:18:42] upon the word in you. That's what I'm
[2:18:44] preaching to this morning. I'm preaching
[2:18:47] to that faith inside of you. I'm not
[2:18:49] preaching to your flesh. Your flesh is
[2:18:51] miserable. But that faith inside of you,
[2:18:54] that's that's the real thing. That's
[2:18:57] what God put in you before the
[2:18:59] foundation. That's what make you can't
[2:19:01] give up. That's what make you can't let
[2:19:03] go. You don't even know why you keep
[2:19:05] bouncing back, rocking back, coming
[2:19:08] back. You don't even you can't explain
[2:19:10] it.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; There's something more than you.
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:17] something beyond you.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; How to be something inside of you.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Pushing you.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; What is it? A seed.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; God doesn't watch fail anyway. He watch
[2:19:37] the seed.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; That way he could treat Job the way he
[2:19:40] treat Job.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; He watch the seed in Job. Hallelujah.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; God know is his faith in Job.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Not even Job know is his faith in Job.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Not even Job know is the faith of God in
[2:19:51] him.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; God knows that.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; So God could tell the devil, "Hey, where
[2:19:55] you going?" So have you considered
[2:19:57] myself in Job? They say I going to and
[2:19:59] fro all over the earth.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; God say, "Have you have you considered
[2:20:02] myself Job? Let me get exercise." I see
[2:20:05] idol in wasting time. You call you're
[2:20:08] taking soft targets.
[2:20:10] Job say that devil say that's a hard
[2:20:12] target. You know I see have a hedge
[2:20:13] around him. God says that so. So the
[2:20:16] devil made a boast. He said if I take
[2:20:18] off the hedge I I'll deal with him. God
[2:20:20] say oh yeah I'm going to prove
[2:20:22] something. He tell the devil this. I'm
[2:20:24] going to prove it's not what's around
[2:20:25] that man.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; It's not what that man possess.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; It's what's in the man.
[2:20:31] [Music]
[2:20:32] [Applause]
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; Some people when they get riches they
[2:20:36] get arrogant.
[2:20:38] They above everybody. They don't need
[2:20:40] church. You don't need God. You need
[2:20:41] nothing.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; So sometimes God have to hold back
[2:20:43] riches from some people
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; cuz they can't handle it.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God had to hold back power
[2:20:49] from people. They can't handle it.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Sometime people climb into power and get
[2:20:52] in power and force you in power and when
[2:20:54] they get in power trouble,
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; chaos.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; What happened? Job was stripped. Job
[2:21:04] didn't ask God. Lord, a long time I got
[2:21:06] a trial. Give me one.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; we didn't say pray for trial. I'm saying
[2:21:14] Job didn't ask for it.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; It just came.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Disappointments, conditions,
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; break, uh, you know, dark times, night
[2:21:23] time. It just come.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; How do you deal with it when you're not
[2:21:26] in charge?
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; How you deal with it when the winds are
[2:21:29] contrary?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; And the storms are blowing. You didn't
[2:21:32] start it.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't set it up, but it hit
[2:21:35] your life. It hit your home. Hit your
[2:21:37] house. Hit your family. How do you deal
[2:21:38] with it?
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Job going through. The Lord gave the
[2:21:42] Lord take it away. People think he's a
[2:21:44] secret sinner and all kind of stuff. And
[2:21:46] Job coming through, coming through,
[2:21:48] coming through. I've heard of thee by
[2:21:49] the hearing of the air, but now my eye
[2:21:51] seeth thee.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Though the skin worm destroy my body,
[2:21:55] yet in my flesh, I shall see God
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; for myself and not another.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; He said to see the resurrection. He
[2:22:00] started to see beyond God. Take him
[2:22:02] beyond the veil of his present
[2:22:04] condition. Think about you missed the
[2:22:06] boat. Think about you missed the
[2:22:08] revelation and only seen boils. Oh God.
[2:22:10] Oh God. What he got? God serve him like
[2:22:11] a sick.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; But Job see beyond that. He said listen
[2:22:14] this sickness this is temporary. Yes.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; This this this body business.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; This body if a man die shall live again.
[2:22:21] I I I'll wait till my change come. The
[2:22:24] devil is finished. Devil can't get go
[2:22:27] get Jo to say the wrong thing. I'll wait
[2:22:29] till my change come though the skin
[2:22:31] won't destroy my body yet in my flesh.
[2:22:33] You see you could talk that we could
[2:22:34] talk that scripture. But when you in the
[2:22:36] actual condition when you sitting in the
[2:22:38] in and at your condition could you say
[2:22:40] that when your child come when you
[2:22:43] cannot rise from from your heap as it
[2:22:45] was
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; in your situation that is where those
[2:22:50] word count
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; the Lord give the Lord take it away.
[2:22:53] Blessed be the name of the Lord. When
[2:22:55] you're in the valley let me hear your
[2:22:57] testimony. Let me hear you shouting in
[2:22:59] the valley as you're shouting on the
[2:23:01] mountain top. sharp when you're sick.
[2:23:03] Praise God anyhow because you are going
[2:23:05] to be healed.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil believe that he
[2:23:08] going to capture you and pull you down
[2:23:10] into a sick into debt.
[2:23:14] [Applause]
[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:15] [Applause]
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Are you in the church triumphant?
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Are you in the savior's bride?
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Come and be baptized into the body.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Vision is the most important thing.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; You may be I believe that.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Money is not as important as vision.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; You can have money and no vision.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; But vision could bring you into money.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Vision could bring you into wealth and
[2:23:45] power and so on. Vision without a vision
[2:23:46] the people perish.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's why the vision is the most
[2:23:49] important thing.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture say the vision
[2:23:51] the time was long
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; but the vision was true.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; You see if you know the vision is true,
[2:23:56] you could wait on the time
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; because the vision shall surely come to
[2:23:59] pass. Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[2:24:03] right?
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Elijah said, "Not even due or rain will
[2:24:05] fall till I call for it." He shut the
[2:24:07] heavens up.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; One man
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; take a word and shut the heavens up.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; And when he felt time to come off rain,
[2:24:12] he tell the servants, "Go and look and
[2:24:14] tell me what you see."
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Because he felt in his spirit, "It's
[2:24:17] time for rain."
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The servant run up, run up, run
[2:24:20] up and come and say, "I see nothing." He
[2:24:21] said, "Go seven times."
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Have to have something there.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; That is when you have vision.

[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Look up no man hand run.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; The first sign you see you up
[2:24:38] and your fingers start to move. Shout
[2:24:41] all the other fingers going to move
[2:24:42] also.
[2:24:44] This is breakthrough time. This is
[2:24:46] deliverance time. Run for the Lord has
[2:24:50] given the city. Shout.
[2:24:56] Hallelujah.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; You have more supernatural protection
[2:25:03] and help than you think.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; You have more supernatural assistance
[2:25:06] than you think.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; It's just because you're not seeing the
[2:25:09] other dimension. You can't see it.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; That come like Elijah and his servant
[2:25:13] steering army surround Gazi and surround
[2:25:15] Elijah and the man getting frightened
[2:25:17] frightened. Elijah had enough of it. Man
[2:25:19] complain look look at me.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; He said God open his boy eyes.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; When the boy open the show, he said,
[2:25:27] "But there are more for us and against
[2:25:29] us."
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; That's it, boy.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; That's it, boy. We always have more for
[2:25:33] us than who? Against us.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; You should be shouting on that one.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Creator is he
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; that's in you.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; That he that's in the world.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about external forces.
[2:25:47] We talking about internal forces.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; God put something inside of you.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; That word in you are power.
[2:25:54] That kingdom is the word turn into
[2:25:55] power.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; It may not turn into power yet, but it
[2:25:58] will turn into power.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; That power is always there.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; God put it as a seed that have to pip
[2:26:05] his way out to produce the miracle.
[2:26:07] That's what faith is.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Faith is the seed to push his way out
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; to produce the miracle.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Do you want a miracle this morning? Let
[2:26:17] your faith go to work as that seed to
[2:26:20] produce that miracle. A miracle is
[2:26:22] coming your way. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:26:24] praises.

[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; My my we trudging along so slowly today.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Um page five of 19 pages.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The body of Christ is not an
[2:26:40] organization. The body of Christ, Jesus
[2:26:43] Christ, is the mystical body. It's a
[2:26:46] kingdom.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; That's a spiritual kingdom that is set
[2:26:50] upon the earth by Jesus Christ being the
[2:26:52] king of this kingdom. The high priest to
[2:26:55] offer sacrifice for the wayfaring into
[2:26:57] the kingdom. He is prophet the word. He
[2:27:00] preaches the truth and bring the light
[2:27:02] of God in the kingdom. He is both
[2:27:05] prophet,
[2:27:06] priest and king.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; In this kingdom. And how do we get into
[2:27:12] this kingdom? By denomination. by
[2:27:15] letter, by handshaking, but by one
[2:27:18] spirit.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; We are all baptized into one body which
[2:27:23] is the mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; We are baptized there not by water, not
[2:27:30] by sprinkling, not by pouring, not by
[2:27:33] any kind of water baptism, but by one
[2:27:36] spirit
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 12, we are
[2:27:40] baptized
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:27:44] Isn't that right?
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Are you ready for some
[2:27:47] more stuff?
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Could we give a shout in the house?
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to shout because I don't want
[2:27:53] your eyes shut down on me.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; I want to get excited because we in the
[2:27:57] word now.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; We want to nail it down inside of there.
[2:28:00] When you leave, you must leave strong.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; You must hear the voice of God tell
[2:28:04] Joshua be strong. Please encourage us.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Why would God tell Joshua that? Because
[2:28:12] you have devils to fight you never saw
[2:28:13] before.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; You have Hittites, Jebusite, Philistine,
[2:28:17] all kind of ice.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; So be strong.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Very courageous.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; So I'm talking about this bridge. I
[2:28:24] challenge a builder to build this bridge
[2:28:26] and he had to test all the material and
[2:28:28] so on and he got the best material and
[2:28:30] everything else. Listen to this part.
[2:28:33] When I think that God puts in his church
[2:28:38] the best that he can find.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I want to say church, I'm
[2:28:42] not talking about building. I'm not
[2:28:43] talking about this group here. I'm not
[2:28:45] talking about a particular church. I'm
[2:28:46] talking about the body.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; I wonder when when I hear church, I want
[2:28:50] you think about this bride buddy. Okay.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; All right. When I think that God puts in
[2:28:55] his church the best that he can find.
[2:28:58] Wow. God takes his children and test
[2:29:02] them with acid test.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; First time I bounce up this one. This
[2:29:08] one is a big one. This this is a big
[2:29:10] one. This is not just test.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; You see how quiet they come acid?
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Do not water test.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Only don't raise your hands. All want
[2:29:21] water. Raise your hand. Don't raise your
[2:29:22] hand. I'm not saying only want acid
[2:29:24] test. I'm not saying that. I'm just
[2:29:25] reading this here now.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God puts his church to
[2:29:31] in the best that he can find, God takes
[2:29:34] his children and tests them with a acid
[2:29:38] test.
[2:29:40] Then
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; He places them into the body of Christ
[2:29:46] because they are tested.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; That's 30%. Say amen.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the other 70%.
[2:29:56] acid test
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; then placed
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; into the body of Christ
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; because they are tested.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; Let's take the example seat son Jesus
[2:30:07] holy ghost striking boom fullness of the
[2:30:09] godheaded bodily
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; but he was led
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; by the spirit
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; into the wilderness
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; to be tempted.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus is dry in the
[2:30:22] wilderness.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, turn the
[2:30:25] stone into bread because we know we
[2:30:27] you're hungry. Devil know you hungry.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; What an offer. He had the power. If you
[2:30:31] feel the power, but he not authorized to
[2:30:33] obey the devil.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; So he gives the devil it is written.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hold that word if you want.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. It is also
[2:30:42] written.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; When the devil sees going on in the
[2:30:43] word, devil going in the word too.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Quoting scripture. He say it's also
[2:30:47] written. So you have to you have to know
[2:30:48] the word. Amen.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Then the Bible say Jesus returned in
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; the power of the spirit
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; and then he found the place where it is
[2:30:57] written cuz he had to take that power
[2:30:58] now and put it back in the word.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; So are you with me now?
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Power here. Jesus tested go to the
[2:31:06] temple scriptures and say it's
[2:31:09] fulfilled.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; It's good as done
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; because the anointing is here to
[2:31:14] manifest the scripture that I am placed
[2:31:16] to manifest.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is finished.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; It is done.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; And then he went about to do his stuff.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me?
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; So the bride have to come through her
[2:31:27] dynamics
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; testing positionally placed. Go back to
[2:31:31] the scripture.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Get the anointing and go and do our
[2:31:35] stuff.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Because two seeds is about to release.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; The seed of the council of churches.
[2:31:42] Amen.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; And the seed of God the manifested son.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Oh. About to be released upon the earth.
[2:31:48] The countdown is on.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Every country getting in position.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; All the presidents coming in position.
[2:31:53] Oh yes.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We go there.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; They were time tested.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Okay, I'm going to go."
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Acid test.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; When a man and woman is ready to take
[2:32:05] the test, the acid test. You see, they
[2:32:07] had to go in the fire. And when they
[2:32:08] did, they was in the fire. And the only
[2:32:10] thing that that taking place, the fiery
[2:32:12] test only unlocked the bands off their
[2:32:14] hands. Are you going? Are you ready?
[2:32:16] Hear this now. And many times God let us
[2:32:20] when we get all bound up with the world
[2:32:22] bound up he let the fiery test come upon
[2:32:25] us and where we have to make a decision.
[2:32:30] And when we do that the only thing the
[2:32:32] test can do when a real seed of Abraham
[2:32:36] is standing the crossroads of decision
[2:32:38] and he makes his decision to serve God.
[2:32:42] It can only cut the bands loose and make
[2:32:44] us free. Amen.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; So when you are confronted with issues
[2:32:47] in your life, God will corner you to
[2:32:50] make a decision and based upon that
[2:32:52] decision because thou has chosen the
[2:32:55] fetterss and the things fall off for
[2:32:57] you.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; And you go free.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; He can only cut the bands loose and make
[2:33:03] us free. Satan might give you a disease.
[2:33:06] He might give you one thing or another.
[2:33:08] How you know it's not God you in your
[2:33:10] crossroads to see what kind of decision
[2:33:12] that you going to make? Oh, blessed be
[2:33:15] the name of the Lord. Praise his holy
[2:33:17] name.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. So, was the eyes.
[2:33:21] Isn't that right? He said the next is
[2:33:23] the intelligence. And we have no
[2:33:25] intelligence of our own. We have no
[2:33:27] sight of our own. How can a man for see
[2:33:29] these things? It's becoming to a place
[2:33:31] he's governed the body all the way
[2:33:33] through. Then the complete here we go.
[2:33:36] Body of Christ is revealed in the form
[2:33:40] of a bride that was taken out of his
[2:33:42] side.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So his wife came out of his side
[2:33:45] and that is the body of Christ being
[2:33:47] revealed and you're going to begin to
[2:33:49] see it
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; as it begin to unfold
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; right in front of your eyes. So
[2:33:53] Abraham's election, Isaac justification,
[2:33:56] what Jacob grace and what Joseph
[2:33:58] affection placed. Oh hallelujah. For by
[2:34:01] one spirit, we are all placed into the
[2:34:04] body of Christ positionally. We have to
[2:34:06] get Have you tried it? Oh, praise God.
[2:34:09] Every man or woman here that's a
[2:34:10] Christian know there is something being
[2:34:12] upon your life that's God's election man
[2:34:15] can't take his land I have a healing
[2:34:17] service half he said when I go over
[2:34:19] there in the baptism of the name of
[2:34:20] Jesus Christ the trinity brethren say oh
[2:34:22] he is old Jesus only I can't go over
[2:34:25] there because I divine healing and
[2:34:27] that's divine healing is all right a lot
[2:34:29] of them enjoy miracles and the Lord and
[2:34:31] say well brother Brandham I believe you
[2:34:32] to be a prophet but let me tell you
[2:34:34] something as long as his praise is on
[2:34:35] him he's discerning he's the lord's
[2:34:37] servant but his teaching is rotten. It
[2:34:39] is no good. Who ever heard of such tummy
[2:34:41] rot? It's either of God or isn't God. It
[2:34:44] isn't is all God or non God.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; So how are you going to act? Manis won't
[2:34:49] keep his ground. Ephraim won't keep his
[2:34:52] ground. God won't keep his ground.
[2:34:54] Benjamin won't keep his ground. They're
[2:34:56] all running out there with the
[2:34:57] Philistines all mixed up. How are we
[2:34:59] going to get placed?
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; But we have been born by the Holy Ghost.
[2:35:03] All of us. Is that right? We are born.
[2:35:05] Then after being born, we are
[2:35:07] predestinated into adoption to be placed
[2:35:10] into the body of Christ.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. That's the real church.
[2:35:16] Not mortar and brick and stone and so
[2:35:18] forth. But the real church is built upon
[2:35:20] the revelation of the word and the will
[2:35:22] of God.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; And that has been placed in the body
[2:35:26] since the Ephesians church all the way
[2:35:27] to the Laian age. So do you see the real
[2:35:29] church this morning?
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; The church is you. You could reading
[2:35:32] your Bible, reading the scriptures,
[2:35:33] reading a spoken word book, and God
[2:35:35] begin revelation upon you. That's the
[2:35:37] church. That's the rock. Praise God. You
[2:35:39] don't even have to be in this building.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You could be home and God
[2:35:43] give you revelation. That's the church.
[2:35:45] That's the rock. That's the power inside
[2:35:48] of you. Revelation is prevailing power.
[2:35:50] You need revelation.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. You need
[2:35:53] revelation.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Not just understanding. Revelation
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; because revelation is an anchor.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; So after Solomon dedicated the temple,
[2:36:06] after the building was completed, it was
[2:36:07] an empty building. There was nothing but
[2:36:09] furniture. He was about to dedicate this
[2:36:11] building for the worshippers to worship
[2:36:13] something. And without something there
[2:36:14] to worship, the building would be in
[2:36:16] vain. The building was ready for
[2:36:18] dedication. And when the Levites and the
[2:36:20] priest and thousands of trumpets blast
[2:36:21] the sky, the lamb after lamb dime, the
[2:36:24] Levites took up their position, the
[2:36:26] saraphims touching one another and so
[2:36:28] forth. Watch. And they picked it up from
[2:36:30] its tents and so on. And long came the
[2:36:33] watch. There was this uh they brought it
[2:36:34] to this resting place. This stone a huge
[2:36:37] stone placed set for it. And finally
[2:36:39] come to it resting place. And then it
[2:36:41] finally found rest in place. The shikina
[2:36:44] glory follow those capping stone. Not
[2:36:46] the cornerstone. The capp stone the main
[2:36:48] thing. All other stone was of none
[2:36:50] effect until this came.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all the revelation will
[2:36:55] be on in none effect until the captain
[2:36:58] stone come and the captain stone come to
[2:37:00] put in effect every other stone. What is
[2:37:02] the use of the body without the head
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; the head have to connect to the body and
[2:37:06] the head is the intelligence even the
[2:37:08] voice of the archangel to come upon a
[2:37:10] bride to mount a bride to ride a bride.
[2:37:12] We have been under the ministry of the
[2:37:14] word but our God has promised the
[2:37:16] ministry of the spirit to come upon a
[2:37:18] bride to anoint a bride. I'm not
[2:37:20] finished yet. So ride with me. Oh, give
[2:37:22] the Lord some shout in the house. Oh,
[2:37:24] glory to God. I don't care if you're
[2:37:26] tired. I'm not done yet.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; When I'm done, I'm going to be done.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But there's a bride
[2:37:32] body that the Lord has to mount. You
[2:37:35] become a white horse and he become the
[2:37:37] white horse rider and he going to jump
[2:37:39] on you and ride it down to the
[2:37:41] resurrection.
[2:37:44] [Applause]
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:37:50] All the other stones were of none effect
[2:37:52] until this then this main stone came in
[2:37:55] the headstone took its place
[2:37:57] positionally for it resting place for
[2:37:58] generation. The glory of God filled the
[2:38:01] place where they were sitting and there
[2:38:03] was a shikina glory in the whole
[2:38:05] building and the glory of God was so
[2:38:07] great till the priest could not even
[2:38:08] minister.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say about the
[2:38:10] disciples? They were dry seeds hauling
[2:38:12] stuff in the upper room. They only had
[2:38:14] material. They only had mechanic. They
[2:38:16] only had revelation and they had the
[2:38:18] understanding open to the scriptures
[2:38:20] because Jesus did that in his
[2:38:22] resurrection ministry to give them
[2:38:24] clarity of the seven seas and seven
[2:38:25] thunders that they positionally placed
[2:38:27] to receive dynamics. All of a sudden
[2:38:30] they were in the upper room. All of a
[2:38:32] sudden there was a song from heaven as a
[2:38:34] rushing mighty wind as a kind of glory
[2:38:37] fill all the house. Oh glory to God. And
[2:38:40] they were staging in the upper room.
[2:38:41] They were like drunk men. Oh, this is
[2:38:44] that that the prophet William Brandon
[2:38:46] spoke of. This is that that the prophet
[2:38:48] Joyce spake of. Oh, hallelujah. All of a
[2:38:50] sudden, the dynamics came upon them and
[2:38:53] those dry seeds begin to grow, begin to
[2:38:56] spread. The quickening power, the word
[2:38:59] begin to turn dynamics. The word turn
[2:39:01] into spirit.
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:39:07] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, give the
[2:39:11] Lord a shout. The spirit is here.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; The anointing is here.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; And we are not done yet because the
[2:39:19] glory is promised.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; He promised the glory
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; of the latter house will be more
[2:39:25] powerful than the glory of the former
[2:39:28] house. You are that house this morning.
[2:39:30] You are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[2:39:34] [Music]
[2:39:36] Don't want to fill you with that chicken
[2:39:37] glory. They're not for ministers only.
[2:39:40] That's for whosoever will. Come on. Come
[2:39:43] on. Come on. That's for the sons and
[2:39:45] daughters of God. You can leave him with
[2:39:47] the anointing. You can leave it with
[2:39:49] virtue power.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; You be seated as I was with Moses.
[2:39:58] Brother Brham and the church
[2:40:00] organization has failed
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; and the message denomination
[2:40:04] organization how they nominate this
[2:40:06] message has failed. Seven timeation too.
[2:40:08] Seven seal denomination six six seals
[2:40:11] and so forth. The older certain
[2:40:12] denomination interpretation you have to
[2:40:14] believe it. So
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; you have to believe it's so if you don't
[2:40:16] believe it's so talk and then what?
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it's so
[2:40:23] they say I have to believe it's so you
[2:40:25] say no I not believe it's so. Then what
[2:40:27] you going to do? You punish me.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; You going to take my name out the book?
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Do something.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; Just talk.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; They can't put your name in. They
[2:40:36] putting him out.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; They just talk.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; What they don't understand is by one
[2:40:39] spirit.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; They're not controlling the spirit. They
[2:40:42] have a license in the spirit. God give
[2:40:44] them no legal right over the spirit.
[2:40:46] It's by one spirit. You are baptized
[2:40:48] into one body. Nobody can take power
[2:40:50] from you. Nobody can put you in power.
[2:40:53] The kingdom of God is preached and every
[2:40:55] man press
[2:40:57] their way into it.
[2:41:02] Do I hear a shouting?
[2:41:04] [Applause]
[2:41:07] [Music]
[2:41:08] [Applause]
[2:41:11] Jesus.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; I don't even know what time we finishing
[2:41:13] today.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Because I'm anointed to do this. I'm
[2:41:22] anointed to preach this.
[2:41:26] [Applause]
[2:41:29] [Music]
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:33] Are you in the church triumphant?
[2:41:37] [Applause]

[2:42:40] listen every situation every condition
[2:42:43] in your home in your life all around you
[2:42:44] there's intelligence to deal with it
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; come on now say amen say amen say amen
[2:42:52] on your job in your home in your
[2:42:54] marriage in your life there's an
[2:42:55] intelligent to deal with it.

[2:43:03] [Applause]
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; You may not tap into it yet, but there
[2:43:09] is an intelligence behind it.
[2:43:12] [Applause]
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; There was intelligence in Joseph going
[2:43:17] down in Egypt.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; There was intelligence in Joseph being
[2:43:19] in prison.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; There's intelligence behind that. He was
[2:43:22] in prison by chance because butler and
[2:43:24] baker got to be there because God know
[2:43:26] the butler going up to Pharaoh. So, so
[2:43:28] the butler must have a report of the
[2:43:30] kind of man Joseph is.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; So when the dream come send for Joseph
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; and Joseph come prison to power because
[2:43:36] God want the brethren to come to me
[2:43:38] Joseph.
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; And he had to be in power in Egypt where
[2:43:41] the pyramid is at.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; So God put the pyramid in Egypt and put
[2:43:44] Joseph in charge of the pyramid.
[2:43:48] You didn't hear what I'm saying inside
[2:43:49] of here
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; because a cap coming on it.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; That's where you find Joseph.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; You are not Jacob grace.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; You are truly perfection.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; There is nothing against you.
[2:44:06] I do scream in the house. There is
[2:44:09] nothing.
[2:44:12] You are the blood washed bride of Jesus
[2:44:14] Christ.
[2:44:16] There is one body,
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; many members baptized into that body.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; The church organization,
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; has failed.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, they will not take the church
[2:44:35] over. That's right.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; So, we know that
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; God will raise up a new system,
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; a denominational system by the power of
[2:44:45] God.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Not by ministers and so-called fivefold,
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; not that, but by the power of God.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. The power
[2:44:54] of God.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Not more talk. We had 40 years of that.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; So, we are looking for no more talk.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; In 400 years there was in Egypt. They
[2:45:02] want the next prophet. And I sure had
[2:45:03] somebody playing prophet before Moses
[2:45:04] come.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; But talking prophet now.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; I say unto you, I say unto you, somebody
[2:45:10] has some cuckoo dream or some kind of
[2:45:11] thing like that. They see unto you
[2:45:12] because before Jesus come had bad Jesus.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Don't say somebody for run before the
[2:45:16] real thing come.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; So when Moses come now remember when
[2:45:23] Moses come, Moses have a record already.
[2:45:25] His track record he kill a man and run.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; So people know about that. I mean that
[2:45:30] is 40 years. So he have something
[2:45:31] against him already. Moses come with
[2:45:33] well excuse me I want to apologize Moses
[2:45:35] come with a talk he said just give you
[2:45:37] the word what's the word let my people
[2:45:41] go that's all
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; it's not a complicated thing no no deep
[2:45:45] hidden mystery just just let them go you
[2:45:47] have a choice just let them go or I make
[2:45:49] you let them go
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; he didn't want to let them go so if you
[2:45:53] don't want this sickness this disease is
[2:45:55] either you go or we make you go because
[2:45:57] we have authority by the word in my name
[2:46:00] we shall cast out devils we shall and
[2:46:01] lay hands upon the sick and it shall be
[2:46:03] covered. This is just the word.
[2:46:06] Y shout in the house. You have some
[2:46:08] serious thing to pray for after service.
[2:46:10] So I want your faith to be anointed.
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; And when we begin to pray, we know God
[2:46:14] answered the prayer.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; That's when a man come off of the pillar
[2:46:22] of fire.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; That man is fearless. That man, there's
[2:46:26] nothing against that man. That man is
[2:46:28] free. That man have nothing with critics
[2:46:31] on opinions of others. He just do what
[2:46:33] he has to do and get out.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And Moses, he, you
[2:46:38] know what he did?
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh had to let them go.
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; God wanted more than that. God wanted to
[2:46:43] deal with Pharaoh armies. He wanted to
[2:46:44] strip Pharaoh of that army power. So God
[2:46:47] set up the Red Sea for him. Hallelujah.
[2:46:50] Praise God. God set up the journey, the
[2:46:51] whole journey, you know, because God
[2:46:53] tell Moses bring them down to this
[2:46:54] mountain. You think God has set up your
[2:46:55] journey? Your journey. God know the end
[2:46:57] from the beginning. You not hear what
[2:46:59] I'm saying? So your little trial you're
[2:47:01] going through right now, God, that
[2:47:02] little hump that you going to get over.
[2:47:04] Come on now. I'm Ille.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; I know things rough and tough.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; I wish I could help you.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; You be
[2:47:16] sincere.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; I wish you didn't have to go through. I
[2:47:18] wish I could escort you out of it.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; But then I'll get trouble with God.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; You can't come out. You have to go
[2:47:24] through.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; A lot of you want to come out here. I
[2:47:28] know that. But it's true.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; The Red Sea.
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; God know surfing thing on top of the Red
[2:47:33] Sea and you're surfing and things like
[2:47:34] that.
[2:47:36] &gt;&gt; You had to go through
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; I know you could do with a surfboard and
[2:47:39] the breeze they taking you and you're
[2:47:41] surfing on top things. No, I know
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; you would like that like they gliding
[2:47:45] through. You're holding the rope and
[2:47:46] power power boat just sliding across the
[2:47:49] Red Sea. But whenever they walking
[2:47:50] through and try to be loose,
[2:47:54] sorry, God don't have them kind of power
[2:47:56] thing. You get patience. You got to take
[2:47:58] your time.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; You will get there.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, 25 years for Abraham.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; 25 years for Abraham. 120 years for
[2:48:05] Noah. Two weeks and so in the upper
[2:48:06] room, God have time to wait to be
[2:48:10] patient. It teach you perfection.
[2:48:12] Waiting on God. Waiting for God. It give
[2:48:15] you faith. It give you character when
[2:48:17] you have to wait upon. My soul waited
[2:48:18] upon the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:48:21] He is my rock. He's my refuge. He's my
[2:48:24] strong and mighty tower. Oh, glory to
[2:48:26] God. Here we go. Here we go.
[2:48:29] &gt;&gt; God will raise up an international
[2:48:31] system by the power of God that will
[2:48:34] take the church into the promised land.
[2:48:36] Organizations and denomination has
[2:48:39] messed it up. Each one after their own
[2:48:42] theology. Why people can't receive us as
[2:48:44] Christians?
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; You're in this camp. You're in this
[2:48:51] group. You're teaching this. You're
[2:48:52] teaching this. Oh, Bar say, "How do you
[2:48:54] judge a man?" By how we stay with his
[2:48:56] word. How we stay with the word.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; How people judging me.
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; Am I on the word or I'm off the word? If
[2:49:02] I'm off the word, show me.
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; I ain't like what I see in your church.
[2:49:07] That's like the word.
[2:49:10] God is telling you to light this. What
[2:49:11] you see in your church, you come to see
[2:49:13] what you come to hear and receive and
[2:49:15] act upon what you're hearing.
[2:49:17] &gt;&gt; You don't know who's sitting next to
[2:49:18] you. It could be a saint or a sinner.
[2:49:20] You don't know.
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; And I don't know. Hallelujah.
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; All groups are three kind of believers,
[2:49:24] not some groups.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; You don't want to say amen.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; I would say amen. I'm a true believer.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen?
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't teach that. What I'm for that
[2:49:35] is that unbeliever, make believe and
[2:49:36] true believer.
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; So if you're a true believer, you say
[2:49:39] amen to the word.
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz that is you.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; That that word is you. That attribute
[2:49:44] you connect to that what what you're
[2:49:45] hearing.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; So they me each one after their own
[2:49:47] theology. Each one after their own
[2:49:49] thinking. But God, here we go, will take
[2:49:53] his Holy Spirit and will raise up his
[2:49:56] Joshua
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; that will take the church to the promise
[2:49:59] with no denominational strings tied
[2:50:02] anywhere. He will take the church over.
[2:50:04] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. He
[2:50:06] said, "Brother," he said, "Brother
[2:50:08] clergyman, could you mark this down?"
[2:50:10] Who's signing and crying? He said, "Now,
[2:50:12] brother, let's get back off to the off
[2:50:14] this territory. Let's come back to God.
[2:50:16] Come back to the altar. Rebuild the
[2:50:18] altar again that's been torn down and
[2:50:20] build up your home. Take them cards off
[2:50:22] the table. All them love magazines and
[2:50:24] open up the Bible. Read the Bible and
[2:50:27] pray and don't get down and say, "Bless
[2:50:28] my family, Mary, Jo, and John and all of
[2:50:30] them. Get in bed." No. Stay there with
[2:50:33] God.
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; I'm about to wrap up on your home
[2:50:35] stretch here now. But the Bible says, we
[2:50:38] know the scripture says that Jesus is
[2:50:39] the chief cornerstone. He also is a
[2:50:41] headstone. And we will think for a few
[2:50:43] minutes that the seven church age
[2:50:44] messenger what was to restore the faith
[2:50:48] of the children back to the fathers. In
[2:50:50] other words, rebuild the church again
[2:50:52] under the power of the spirit. So what
[2:50:55] we have seen for all these years is the
[2:50:57] power of the word and revelation. But
[2:51:00] there's a promise that the church going
[2:51:02] to be rebuilt under the power of the
[2:51:04] spirit. And that is what going to bring
[2:51:06] the faith. So it wouldn't be hard up and
[2:51:08] struggling and fighting. No, the spirit
[2:51:11] will be there present to answer your
[2:51:13] prayer to meet your need. Oh, you will
[2:51:16] see God answering your prayer. Isn't
[2:51:17] that right?
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying in other words, rebuild
[2:51:20] the church again under the power of the
[2:51:22] spirit. Not by power, not by might, not
[2:51:25] by organization, but by my holy spirit
[2:51:28] will God bring forth the church in the
[2:51:30] last days.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. National force, but
[2:51:33] Israel in the homeland. National force
[2:51:35] will put the church in the work of the
[2:51:37] churches. But the power of God will put
[2:51:39] the people in the bride. Not some man,
[2:51:42] not some minister, but the power of God
[2:51:45] will put the people in the bride. The
[2:51:49] power of God will baptize them. Will put
[2:51:52] them in the body. Will put them into the
[2:51:55] bride body. Will put them into the
[2:51:56] church body. The real church, the true
[2:51:59] church of which Christ is the head.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the
[2:52:03] house?
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The world forces this
[2:52:10] way. The world forces that way. But God
[2:52:13] forces upward. The spirit of God. Here
[2:52:16] we go. Which is the word of God.
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; My word is spirit and life.
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; This is the problem. People don't want
[2:52:22] to take the word, but the word itself is
[2:52:24] spirit in word form.
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; And God can just flick the switch and
[2:52:28] the word turn to spirit.
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; Because he say my words are spirit and
[2:52:31] my words are life. Amen.
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; So if you want the life, you have to get
[2:52:34] the word
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; because in the beginning was the word.
[2:52:36] The word is with God. The word was God.
[2:52:38] Isn't that right?
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; So watch watch. The spirit of God which
[2:52:46] is the word of God. My word is spirit
[2:52:47] and life will put the bride in her
[2:52:49] place. She will recognize her position
[2:52:52] in the word. Then she's in Christ.
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; Then she's in Christ.
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you cannot say you're in
[2:52:58] Christ and you don't know your position
[2:52:59] in the word. That's why Jesus could find
[2:53:01] the place where it is written. He could
[2:53:04] go to Isaiah 61 and find the exact
[2:53:06] scripture that he could anoint.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; Then he have his position now. The
[2:53:11] spirit of God is upon me because he
[2:53:13] anointed me to bring good tidings, to
[2:53:14] set the captive free, to open up the
[2:53:16] blind eye. Jesus found the scripture.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; Then you are in Christ.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; Go through your land.
[2:53:26] &gt;&gt; See where your boundaries lie. See what
[2:53:29] God has given you.
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; God has given you something, brother.
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; God has given you something, sister.
[2:53:35] Don't let the devil lie to you.
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; It belongs to you.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; The power of God will put the people in
[2:53:47] the bride.
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; The father wanted the work done. He sent
[2:53:52] it to his son. The son wanted the work
[2:53:54] done. He sent it into his church. Amen.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; And he said the same power
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; that rested in Jesus Christ
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; rest in place sons
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; in the body of Christ.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Same power
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; that was in Jesus
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; going to rest on place sons.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; So what God is saying I'm going to place
[2:54:11] some sons. There is my spirit flowing
[2:54:15] freely. A son placed positionally in the
[2:54:18] body. Who's going to fight that? Devil
[2:54:21] can't challenge that. Joy prophesy of
[2:54:23] army being raised up. Oh, give the Lord
[2:54:26] a shout.
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:54:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; What the Bible said, the people that
[2:54:32] know their God shall be strong
[2:54:34] &gt;&gt; and do great exploits.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. Thank
[2:54:41] you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[2:54:46] God. Glory to God. Glory to God. I'm
[2:54:51] almost finished. Come on, please. The
[2:54:54] true church,
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; the bride is so sold out to him
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; and his promised word till the very mind
[2:55:01] that was in Christ is in you.
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; And we find today that the modern
[2:55:05] church, the modern world church and also
[2:55:08] that the spiritual church are both
[2:55:10] pregnantated to give birth to sons.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; One will produce a denominational birth
[2:55:14] that's going to give one day to the
[2:55:16] workings of churches and the other is
[2:55:19] pregnant by the word of God will bring
[2:55:21] forth. Are we ready? Hallelujah. will
[2:55:23] bring forth the body
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; the finished body of Jesus Christ
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; which is the bride
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[2:55:34] &gt;&gt; that's why Baram says when that last
[2:55:36] name is called maybe in Africa the door
[2:55:39] is shut
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; I'm reading I'm reading watch the other
[2:55:44] is pregnant by the word of God will
[2:55:46] bring forth the body the finished body
[2:55:48] of Jesus Christ which is the bride the
[2:55:51] body of Christ isn't finished yet. How
[2:55:54] many knows that a man and woman is one?
[2:55:56] And Christ is one body, the word, and
[2:55:59] the bride will have to be the rest of
[2:56:01] the body.
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; So Christ is not complete without his
[2:56:05] wife.
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:56:08] &gt;&gt; You hear that?
[2:56:10] &gt;&gt; Christ is complete with the body
[2:56:12] &gt;&gt; because he is the head of the body
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; which is the church.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus.
[2:56:18] Thank you, Lord.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus.

[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ is the head of this
[2:56:27] Messiah kingdom. And you cannot organize
[2:56:29] a kingdom in which Christ is the head.
[2:56:32] Oh praise God. Praise God. The real
[2:56:33] church is the mystical body of Jesus
[2:56:36] Christ. And God sent back the Holy Ghost
[2:56:39] to make up this mystical body of Christ
[2:56:41] which will be united by the marriage of
[2:56:42] the lamb. Oh praise God. Amen.
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:56:47] to this one.

[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; Justified.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; Justified as if it never did.
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:57:02] &gt;&gt; I know that has strike many of you yet
[2:57:03] because you need a revelation of that.
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; But listen to this part I want to get
[2:57:06] to.
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; We stand justified in Christ because he
[2:57:10] cannot pass judgment for he already
[2:57:14] judged that body in which I'm part of.
[2:57:19] There is therefore now no condemnation
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk
[2:57:24] not after the flesh but after the
[2:57:25] spirit. Let all standal

[3:19:26] morning. And at the end of that service,
[3:19:28] Beloved was preparing to pray. And the
[3:19:31] atmosphere was right for deliverance,
[3:19:33] for healing, for restoration, and for
[3:19:36] breakthrough. And I don't know what your
[3:19:38] need is this morning, but he is still
[3:19:41] God. He is still the great physician.
[3:19:43] And we have many needs in the church,
[3:19:46] many needs among the body of believers.
[3:19:49] There are many that are sick and
[3:19:50] afflicted, many dealing with issues and
[3:19:54] storms that they have not even
[3:19:55] communicated or even articulated. But
[3:19:58] God sees it all this morning. And he
[3:20:00] sees every hand. So as we approach the
[3:20:02] throne of grace this morning, knowing
[3:20:04] that there's no hard case.
[3:20:07] Let's bow our heads and bow our hearts.
[3:20:09] Heavenly Father, we thank you this
[3:20:10] morning that you are still the great
[3:20:13] physician and you are still more than
[3:20:16] able to take every request. Lord, you
[3:20:19] said we have not because we ask not
[3:20:21] because when we ask we ask a miss father
[3:20:24] Lord by the driven by the own lust of
[3:20:27] our heart. But this morning we come with
[3:20:28] a noble request based on the foundation
[3:20:31] and the word that healing is the
[3:20:33] children's bread. Father, Lord, knowing
[3:20:35] that you already paid the price for our
[3:20:38] healing, Father, Lord, and by the
[3:20:40] confession of our faith, we could stand
[3:20:42] and rest comfortably on the sanctuary of
[3:20:46] the word, Lord, that it is possible that
[3:20:48] the impossible could be made possible.
[3:20:51] Lord, we bring this condition, Lord, of
[3:20:53] Rosi who has given birth, Lord, and both
[3:20:56] she and the baby have an infection. That
[3:20:58] baby fresh from the presence of God. You
[3:21:01] said when a mother gives birth, there's
[3:21:02] a sweet spirit comes over that mother.
[3:21:04] It doesn't matter what her past was,
[3:21:06] what her situation was because that life
[3:21:09] is coming fresh from the presence of
[3:21:11] God. Father, we pray dear God that the
[3:21:13] angel of the Lord will visit both the
[3:21:15] mother and the baby and that infection
[3:21:18] will be completely dissolved, completely
[3:21:21] removed. Satan, we take your authority
[3:21:24] away by the power of God that rest in
[3:21:27] the church of the living God. Satan,
[3:21:29] take your hands off of that mother and
[3:21:31] that baby in the mighty name of Jesus
[3:21:34] Christ. Father and heavenly father, for
[3:21:36] every request, Lord, for every hand that
[3:21:38] was raised, my hand raised also, Father
[3:21:41] God, you know, every need, every
[3:21:43] situation, Lord, every attack that your
[3:21:46] people are going through, may you send
[3:21:48] healing to your children. May you send
[3:21:50] peace to your children. May you send
[3:21:52] comfort to your children. May you send
[3:21:54] confidence and assurance. You said be
[3:21:56] bold and very courageous, Father. So
[3:21:59] Lord, may you strengthen your people.
[3:22:01] May you touch our pastor this morning in
[3:22:04] a precious way in a mighty name of Jesus
[3:22:06] Christ from the crown of his head to the
[3:22:08] soul of his feet. Touch his wife, touch
[3:22:11] the ministers, touch the elders, touch
[3:22:13] the deacons, trust the touch the ushers,
[3:22:16] the trustees, the musicians, the
[3:22:18] technicians, the helps and the
[3:22:19] governments. Father, may you bless your
[3:22:21] people as we prepare to leave from your
[3:22:23] house but not from your presence. May
[3:22:26] you grant us traveling mercies. May you
[3:22:28] bless the rest of this day that we
[3:22:30] dedicate to you. This is the Lord's day.
[3:22:33] It's a beautiful day. It's a wonderful
[3:22:35] day, Lord, to take us apart from the
[3:22:38] hustle and the bustle of life. Father,
[3:22:40] we will continue after we leave this
[3:22:42] service to give you glory, to give you
[3:22:44] praise, to give you thanksgiving, and we
[3:22:47] pledge to serve you all the days of our
[3:22:49] lives. May you bless our going out. May
[3:22:51] you bless our coming in. We ask in the
[3:22:54] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[3:22:57] church says,
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated for a
[3:23:02] few announcements. Can we give the Lord
[3:23:04] one more hand of praise?
[3:23:07] Glory.
[3:23:09] [Applause]
[3:23:11] Amen.
[3:23:13] This morning we like to welcome Charlene
[3:23:16] Rivas. This she's invited by Sister
[3:23:18] Marlene Pikton. That's her daughter, I
[3:23:20] believe. God bless you. Welcome to
[3:23:22] Headstone Tabernacle. Certainly a great
[3:23:24] privilege
[3:23:26] to have you here with us this morning.
[3:23:29] My what a time we're living in, church.
[3:23:31] What a season we're living in. How many
[3:23:34] were blessed by the meetings by brother
[3:23:35] Norris last Wednesday,
[3:23:38] last Thursday and then last Friday? And
[3:23:41] I really want to salute the church. I
[3:23:43] really want to salute brother Norris for
[3:23:46] the burden, for the inspiration
[3:23:49] to have the meetings. We need more of
[3:23:50] these.
[3:23:52] &gt;&gt; We need more of these and we are under
[3:23:54] great expectation for more of these to
[3:23:57] take place. And there were so many
[3:23:58] nuggets that were shared in the service
[3:24:00] and saint to brother you were speaking
[3:24:02] this morning about the different
[3:24:03] administrations of that same Holy
[3:24:06] Spirit. And that's what we saw that
[3:24:10] meeting Wednesday night, Thursday night
[3:24:12] and by the grace of God Friday night we
[3:24:14] saw different gifts operating by the
[3:24:17] same Holy Spirit having an impact on the
[3:24:20] people of God. So we pray that God would
[3:24:22] bless the Norris and the church there in
[3:24:23] Princess Town. It was such a wonderful
[3:24:25] privilege to be able to be there and to
[3:24:27] see the different brethren and the
[3:24:29] believers and the ministers who spoke as
[3:24:31] well. And I really want to thank you who
[3:24:33] connected online and those who made it
[3:24:35] down to the service on Friday. I salute
[3:24:37] you. We felt the fire. We felt the the
[3:24:40] praises, the shouts. We salute you for
[3:24:43] the effort and uh I want to especially
[3:24:45] salute sister Deborah. Bless sister
[3:24:47] Dborah and I think sister Keela. I think
[3:24:50] I you you they were in all of the
[3:24:51] services. So that's a special grace, a
[3:24:54] special strength. You know, it took a a
[3:24:57] a a great effort depending where you
[3:25:00] came from. I was also there physically
[3:25:01] for all the services and it was a
[3:25:03] blessing. You know, we got home 1 in the
[3:25:05] morning, 2:00 in the morning with a
[3:25:07] punch. We are blending from time into
[3:25:09] eternity.
[3:25:11] But Harry says convention, what is the
[3:25:13] extra hour? Where's the extra two hours?
[3:25:15] You know, and I say when you there comes
[3:25:17] a season as you start to come to church,
[3:25:18] time start to fade. When you come to
[3:25:20] church on Sunday, this is the Lord's
[3:25:21] day. You shouldn't be thinking about
[3:25:23] rushing back home. You come to enjoy the
[3:25:24] presence of the Lord. Enjoy the presence
[3:25:26] of the saints. You can't wait to see
[3:25:28] your bedroom because when you get over
[3:25:30] there is a eternal fellowship in
[3:25:34] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere was so sweet that the
[3:25:37] people didn't want to leave.
[3:25:38] &gt;&gt; By the last service, people didn't want
[3:25:41] to leave. And it was just as a time as
[3:25:43] we preached on Friday where Jesus had to
[3:25:45] tell people, "Go back home now because
[3:25:48] the atmosphere is so sweet." And they'll
[3:25:49] come a service friend. It will be so
[3:25:51] sweet we'll fade right into eternity to
[3:25:54] be able to now fellowship beyond who we
[3:25:56] see to to fellowship with David and
[3:25:58] fellowship with Noah and fellowship with
[3:26:00] Moses and fellowship with all those
[3:26:02] through the ages that form this great
[3:26:05] picture that God has placed and painted
[3:26:08] from Genesis to Revelation and the
[3:26:10] church say amen.
[3:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh and uh today as well, Sister
[3:26:16] Seline, would you stand? God bless you.
[3:26:20] Sister Seline S. Bryce has chosen to
[3:26:22] make this church her home church. So,
[3:26:25] Sister Seline, welcome home. We are
[3:26:27] happy to have you church. Be sure to
[3:26:30] give her the right hand of fellowship.
[3:26:32] We love you and we are happy to have you
[3:26:34] a part of this fellowship by the grace
[3:26:37] of God. And may God continue to
[3:26:39] strengthen you as you continue to serve
[3:26:40] him with all that you have. Amen. And I
[3:26:45] also want to solicit your prayers. Uh
[3:26:48] this week by the grace of God I'll be
[3:26:50] traveling to France to minister this
[3:26:53] weekend in brother Jano's youth
[3:26:55] convention. He's having a youth retreat
[3:26:58] and by the grace of God I'll be speaking
[3:27:00] there in France uh this weekend. So
[3:27:02] remember me in prayer that God would
[3:27:04] continue to strengthen and bless and see
[3:27:08] God's people blessed because that's our
[3:27:10] only motive and objective as brother
[3:27:13] preaches one body. There are there's a
[3:27:15] portion of it here in Trinidad. There's
[3:27:16] a portion all through the islands,
[3:27:18] through the Americas, through Europe,
[3:27:20] through Africa and and it's one body,
[3:27:23] one head of that body. We are all part I
[3:27:26] might just be a little small to you, you
[3:27:27] might just be but we are all part of the
[3:27:29] body. And when Christ takes leadership
[3:27:31] of that body, then you respond for duty
[3:27:33] wherever that duty calls. So I want you
[3:27:35] to be so ready that wherever there's a
[3:27:37] next meeting, we say the meeting is in
[3:27:38] princess tongue. Now it's over here. Now
[3:27:40] it's over there all over the world. Once
[3:27:42] the cloud moves, we moving. Hallelujah.
[3:27:45] Can the church say amen?
[3:27:47] &gt;&gt; It's such an exciting time.
[3:27:51] &gt;&gt; My my my
[3:27:52] &gt;&gt; wonderful. I just want to make sure I
[3:27:54] don't forget anything.
[3:27:56] Okay, great.
[3:27:59] So, service continues this coming
[3:28:01] Wednesday here at the tabernacle. And I
[3:28:03] want to encourage you, especially those
[3:28:06] who are on holidays from school.
[3:28:09] I want to encourage you. And for those
[3:28:12] of you who have made different types of
[3:28:15] excuses to not be here on a Wednesday
[3:28:17] night, some years ago, I preached a
[3:28:20] message, no excuses. I feel I need to
[3:28:21] preach it again.
[3:28:24] But I want to encourage you if you could
[3:28:25] be here on Wednesday night, be here on
[3:28:29] Wednesday night. I believe in my heart,
[3:28:31] God has a special blessing in store this
[3:28:33] coming Wednesday. And I believe every
[3:28:35] Wednesday night is a special anointing
[3:28:38] when you make that sacrifice to be in
[3:28:40] the house of God on Wednesday. So I want
[3:28:42] to encourage church, make an extra
[3:28:44] effort. I know with every extra effort
[3:28:47] that Bedova preached last week, you got
[3:28:49] to get started for God to do the rest.
[3:28:51] Get started this week. So I want to
[3:28:53] encourage you this coming Wednesday,
[3:28:55] make an effort to be here at 8:00 p.m.
[3:28:57] If you really have a good excuse,
[3:29:00] still make an effort.
[3:29:02] I know your t is going to say connect
[3:29:04] online
[3:29:06] but if you really have a good excuse
[3:29:08] still make a good effort to be here on
[3:29:10] Wednesday night by the grace of God this
[3:29:12] coming Friday we will have prayer
[3:29:13] meeting online be sure to connect and I
[3:29:16] want to charge the parents it is your
[3:29:19] responsibility you know yesterday I was
[3:29:22] meditating and you know some of you just
[3:29:24] have to take notes because if you don't
[3:29:25] write it down you'll forget it and I
[3:29:27] wrote I want to speak on responsibility
[3:29:29] and accountability it's two different
[3:29:31] things because you as a parent have a
[3:29:33] responsibility but there's also an
[3:29:36] accountability aspect because you have
[3:29:38] to give an account. So when there's an
[3:29:40] online service you can't do as if
[3:29:42] nothing is happening. You have a
[3:29:44] responsibility in your home to create
[3:29:46] the atmosphere to place priority on the
[3:29:49] moving of the spirit to create the
[3:29:52] prayer meeting in your home. There's a
[3:29:54] altar that's supposed to be in your home
[3:29:56] and it's because many of the families
[3:29:58] have broken issues. Because we see the
[3:30:00] issues translate into life into the
[3:30:03] church into the schools because the
[3:30:05] parents themselves have not created the
[3:30:07] environment and also put the foot down
[3:30:10] on what should be. In the old days the
[3:30:12] parents would say a car wear that in
[3:30:14] this house.
[3:30:16] If you want to wear that get your own
[3:30:17] roof.
[3:30:20] &gt;&gt; Anybody in the house
[3:30:23] &gt;&gt; it is either it's right or it's wrong.
[3:30:25] The Bible said children will be your
[3:30:27] oppressors. I scripture you have to
[3:30:29] decide if that is in your house
[3:30:32] &gt;&gt; because that doesn't speak to the bride
[3:30:34] because the bride cutter from a
[3:30:35] different cloth because the children of
[3:30:37] the bride because what's revealed to us
[3:30:39] belongs to us and to our children. It's
[3:30:41] a behavior that we are responsible for.
[3:30:44] Train up a child in the way that they
[3:30:46] should go. That's a responsibility.
[3:30:48] There's an accountability that comes
[3:30:50] from that. So I want to encourage you
[3:30:52] don't underestimate or diminish when we
[3:30:56] have an online service or a zoom
[3:30:58] service. It is your responsibility to
[3:31:01] create an atmosphere in your home so
[3:31:03] that the young children have a level of
[3:31:05] respect to the service. And that applies
[3:31:07] even into the house of God.
[3:31:09] &gt;&gt; As a 5-year-old, I was sharing with my
[3:31:11] wife. I remember the service in
[3:31:13] Shagaramas in ' 87. I was 6 years old
[3:31:15] sitting down in the house of God.
[3:31:18] not running on playing downstairs and
[3:31:20] it's play play play play play play play
[3:31:20] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:20] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play play play play play play
[3:31:21] play play play after service but while
[3:31:23] the service is going on there was a
[3:31:25] level of respect and a sensitivity that
[3:31:28] the word of God is being spoken so these
[3:31:30] are the things that we have to address
[3:31:31] and make clear so that you understand
[3:31:34] you want as for me and my house we will
[3:31:37] serve the lord can the church say amen
[3:31:40] so this coming Wednesday service at 8
[3:31:42] this coming Friday zoom prayer meeting
[3:31:46] and service continues this coming Sunday
[3:31:48] by the grace of God. I want to also
[3:31:50] remind you that on the 31st of August,
[3:31:53] which is an independence day, it's a
[3:31:55] holiday and it will extend of course
[3:31:56] because it falls on a Sunday to the
[3:31:58] Monday is a public holiday. That will be
[3:32:00] a special service. On that service, we
[3:32:02] have a few things happening. We want to
[3:32:04] pray for everyone who's going back out
[3:32:07] to school. If there's a place in this
[3:32:09] hour where our young people are being
[3:32:11] attacked, it's in the school system.
[3:32:13] Whether it's university, whether it's
[3:32:15] preschool, primary school, secondary
[3:32:17] school, they are being hit every day.
[3:32:19] Sometime it's teachers teaching them all
[3:32:21] kind of crazy things. It's the friends,
[3:32:23] it's the peer pressure. It's a nesting
[3:32:25] place for all kinds of stuff. So we want
[3:32:27] to pray for our children that's going
[3:32:29] back out to school at every single
[3:32:31] level. We also want to celebrate those
[3:32:33] that are graduating from the various
[3:32:35] Sunday school levels. We have a few as
[3:32:37] well. And on that very day, Brother has
[3:32:40] decided to have a special meal for the
[3:32:42] entire church as a special thanksgiving
[3:32:44] service. So, we are looking to see every
[3:32:46] member of the church here on that day
[3:32:49] because a thanksgiving service is a
[3:32:51] celebration service and we want to put
[3:32:52] our shoulders to the wheel uh to create
[3:32:55] an atmosphere that our young people
[3:32:57] could be fortified to go into this new
[3:32:59] school year differently. Do we
[3:33:01] appreciate that?
[3:33:02] &gt;&gt; Are we looking forward for that? Are you
[3:33:05] going to pray for one another? Are you
[3:33:07] going to pray for the ministry? Are you
[3:33:08] going to keep your swords drawn? Are you
[3:33:10] going to be in the word? Are you going
[3:33:12] to play the tapes at home? Are you going
[3:33:14] to read your Bible every day? That's how
[3:33:16] you go. Read your Bible and pray every
[3:33:18] day and you'll grow, grow, grow. Last
[3:33:20] and certainly not least, maintainance
[3:33:22] group four. Please meet with brother
[3:33:24] Marlon Alexander after the service. And
[3:33:26] next week, Lord willing, group two is
[3:33:29] carded to serve. May the Lord richly
[3:33:32] bless you, brother Steven.
[3:33:35] [Music]
[3:33:39] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise one
[3:33:40] more time. Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[3:33:47] Thank you, Jesus. Reach across and greet
[3:33:49] your brother and sister. One more time.
[3:33:52] Big smile. Amen. And encourage somebody.
[3:33:54] Amen. Brother Gideon. There shall be
[3:33:57] showers of blessing.
[3:34:01] Amen. Praise God. You appreciate it the
[3:34:03] service today.
[3:34:05] Amen. Amen. Amen. Placed in the body of
[3:34:09] Christ by the baptism of the Holy
[3:34:11] Spirit. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[3:34:14] Let's sing that song as the ushers get
[3:34:17] ready to come forward. Oh, there shall
[3:34:20] be showers of blood. This is the promise
[3:34:23] of love. Promise. There shall be
[3:34:27] seasons. There shall be seasons refresh
[3:34:31] sent from the savior.
[3:34:34] Savior above,
[3:34:37] showers
[3:34:39] of
[3:34:42] showers of blessings we need.
[3:34:45] Oh mercy drop.
[3:34:48] [Music]
[3:34:50] But for the showers we plead.
[3:34:54] Oh, there shall be showers of blessing,
[3:34:59] precious reviving again
[3:35:03] over the hills and the valleyies.
[3:35:08] Sound of abundance of rain. Oh showers
[3:35:15] come out. Oh showers of blessings we
[3:35:18] need.
[3:35:20] Oh, mercy drops round us are falling.
[3:35:25] But for the showers,
[3:35:28] oh there shall be showers of blessing.
[3:35:34] Send them upon us, oh Lord.
[3:35:38] Grant to us now our refreshing.
[3:35:42] Come and now honor thy word.
