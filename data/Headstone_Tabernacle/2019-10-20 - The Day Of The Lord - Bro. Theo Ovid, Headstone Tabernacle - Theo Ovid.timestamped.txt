[45:08] day should overtake you as a thief

[45:23] at sleep sleep in the night
[45:24] did I be talking a drunken in the night
[45:27] I'm a good Isaiah chapter 2 verse 11
[45:35] God speaks the lofty looks of mana be
[45:39] humbled and the haughtiness of men shall
[45:43] be bowed on and the Lord alone shall be
[45:48] exalted in that day for the day of the
[45:52] Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one
[45:54] that is proud and lofty and upon
[45:58] everyone that is lifted up and he shall
[46:02] be brought low Isaiah chapter 13 we're
[46:07] in verse 6 wholly for the day of the
[46:14] Lord is at hand
[46:15] it shall come as a destruction from the
[46:18] Almighty therefore shall all hands be
[46:21] faint and every man's heart shall melt
[46:24] and they shall be afraid pangs and soul
[46:29] shall take a whole of them they shall be
[46:32] in pain as a woman that travail let this
[46:37] shall be Amin is one at another the

[46:57] the land desolate he shall destroy the
[46:59] sinners deal out of it for the stars of
[47:02] heaven and the constellation thereof
[47:04] shall not give their light the Sun shall
[47:06] be darkened in the going forth and the
[47:09] moon shall not cause a light to shine
[47:11] and I will punish the world for the evil
[47:14] and the wicked for their iniquity and i
[47:18] will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
[47:20] cease and I will lower the haughtiness
[47:22] of the terrible let us borrow his
[47:25] heavenly father we read your word and
[47:27] Lord is just such an interjection at
[47:29] this point in time how this message came
[47:31] and what you gave me to say to the
[47:33] people Lord may you inspire take me out
[47:35] of the way and Lord I only speak what
[47:38] you want me to speak in Jesus name I ask
[47:40] it amen amen you may be seated or praise
[47:43] the Lord amen
[47:44] praise God hallelujah glory to God
[47:49] I will contact Scripture version 612 and
[47:52] I beheld and he had opened the sixth
[47:54] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[47:56] and the Sun became black as sackcloth of
[47:58] hair and the moon became as blood title
[48:02] this morning is the day of the Lord
[48:04] that's the title this morning the day of
[48:06] the Lord I feel is the message the
[48:08] warning and God always send warning
[48:13] before judgment but before he sends a
[48:15] warning he always made a provision for
[48:17] us keep whatever is coming because
[48:20] something is fixing to break for
[48:21] something is fixing to take place how
[48:31] can God give power question how can God
[48:34] give more than someone who doesn't know
[48:35] him looking for power but how could God
[48:43] gives someone power who doesn't know him
[48:46] who doesn't have a relationship with him
[48:49] who is not even close to him you know
[48:55] you could go and ask your father for
[48:56] something or your uncle for something
[48:58] but if you have some distance somebody
[48:59] you even talk to them how you gonna ask
[49:01] them for this walking for that or expect
[49:03] me to give you this time to give you
[49:05] that when you have a relationship with
[49:06] them it easy to ask easy for them to
[49:09] give it to you because you're a
[49:10] relationship with them is easy forgot to
[49:13] give you the size of your heart because
[49:14] your relationship with him so how can
[49:17] God give you power when you don't know
[49:18] him
[49:18] when you're not interested in knowing
[49:20] him I don't know him as much as I know
[49:22] the Lord you could only know him by his
[49:24] word you couldn't know him how we reveal
[49:26] how he could be contacted how he could
[49:28] all you could relate and commune with
[49:30] him if you don't go by the word then
[49:32] you're going by the god of the
[49:34] imagination of your own heart and mind
[49:36] the queen by the core of your own
[49:37] thoughts what you think he is what you
[49:40] feel is was a good God all the time and
[49:42] all let me look at phases and sort you
[49:43] going like that but God is not bad God
[49:46] is what we just read here tonight I will

[1:53:14] door and he's bringing a revolution
[1:53:15] inside of here he said this is my mercy
[1:53:18] in Chapter four just in the Ville he

[1:53:23] door he said after the Methodist Church
[1:53:24] age they turn away from it I've said
[1:53:27] before an open door I put an open door
[1:53:29] which is the Holy Spirit hallelujah so

[1:54:36] that door this door was set in heaven he
[1:54:39] looked up towards heaven and he's in an
[1:54:41] open door on the first voice sound like
[1:54:43] a trumpet and all the scenes change from
[1:54:45] Patmos to heaven the voice the voice
[1:54:49] that walk with the seven golden
[1:54:50] candlesticks that same voice didn't
[1:54:52] change but the voice when it was in the
[1:54:55] first time how many remember that I was
[1:54:57] in the spirit on the Lord's Day in the
[1:54:59] spirit isn't that right I was in the
[1:55:01] spirit on the Lord's Day
[1:55:02] I heard behind me a voice of a trumpet
[1:55:04] that song like many waters and that many
[1:55:08] waters is a voice of the ministers the
[1:55:10] voice of the preachers the voice of many
[1:55:12] waters the voice of the people he
[1:55:14] explained what the voice of many waters
[1:55:15] is its cause for all the ages speaking
[1:55:18] the word the people and as they rejected
[1:55:20] the voice to enter judgment Oh glory to
[1:55:23] God remember revelation is still a book
[1:55:24] assembles a lot of things representing
[1:55:27] something else let's continue hallelujah
[1:55:30] and when I tuned and look I saw one
[1:55:31] style missile semicolon stands legs and
[1:55:33] as he showed all the mystery of them
[1:55:35] seven golden candlesticks holding seven
[1:55:37] stands he looked and saw an open door an
[1:55:40] open door into heaven how do you get in
[1:55:42] by Christ Jesus one door one way any man
[1:55:46] can climb one away
[1:55:47] and the other we see him as a thief and
[1:55:49] a robber and in the parable W of the one
[1:55:52] who climb up and was in the wedding
[1:55:53] supper with hope they comment on was
[1:55:55] found guilty was bombed and cast into
[1:55:57] outer darkness only one way I believe I
[1:56:00] preached here not long ago whenever
[1:56:02] somebody gets married in the old country
[1:56:04] he given invitations himself he has to
[1:56:06] furnish the robes and when he met this
[1:56:08] man sitting here how many remember the
[1:56:10] parable he found a man at the supper
[1:56:12] table without a wedding garment on what
[1:56:15] is it the bridegroom stands at the door
[1:56:18] and all who comes up with an invitation
[1:56:20] no man can come to the Father except by
[1:56:23] me and when you come to the invitation
[1:56:25] so that everybody will look alike look
[1:56:28] alike not you better than Who am I
[1:56:31] suggesting who look alike
[1:56:32] watch watch whether they are rich or
[1:56:35] poor bond or free black or white male or
[1:56:38] female they are all one in Christ Jesus
[1:56:40] and the bridegroom stood at the door and
[1:56:42] received the invitation and put the rope
[1:56:44] around his fellow so the rich and the
[1:56:46] poor all look alike that's the way it is
[1:56:48] in the kingdom of God there's no big
[1:56:51] guys and little guys there's only one
[1:56:53] guy one Christ Jesus one in Christ or
[1:56:56] literally that so this money came to
[1:56:59] this back door and the master came as a
[1:57:01] friend how did you get in here when
[1:57:03] Oprah comment on Jesus said
[1:57:06] self he said he called to the port of
[1:57:08] Tainan photon ham he was cast into outer
[1:57:11] darkness where there was weeping and
[1:57:13] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:57:14] that's Christ's own words he was cast
[1:57:16] out because it proved yeah we go without
[1:57:18] the wedding garment he comes some other
[1:57:20] way besides the door because if he come
[1:57:23] to the door he would have received the
[1:57:24] wedding garment he said oh listen to
[1:57:26] this
[1:57:27] then if the wedding garment is the
[1:57:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit how our
[1:57:32] Weaver will be going to be represented
[1:57:34] any other way you've got to come by
[1:57:37] Christ Jesus to me that truth the life
[1:57:40] Oh hallelujah
[1:57:42] but by some join in some church I never
[1:57:45] easy message and a brother branham what
[1:57:47] I sit with at the door
[1:57:48] you only gettin started the Bible he
[1:57:51] said he'd ever believe and tremble Oh
[1:57:52] hallelujah
[1:57:54] let's continue but here's one when I get
[1:57:56] to Revelation 1:10 3:13 I want you to
[1:58:01] notice the voice that he heard speaking
[1:58:02] to him had the clearness of a trumpet
[1:58:04] you know how our trumpet songs that give
[1:58:07] a shrill tone what does a trumpet mean
[1:58:11] question in the Bible what does a
[1:58:15] trumpet mean war any time you see a
[1:58:18] trumpet blow it is war in the by the
[1:58:20] time it is a song in meant a war then he
[1:58:25] went further either a revelation or
[1:58:29] something to take place so identify
[1:58:33] treating a war a revelation or something
[1:58:38] to say please all glory to God
[1:58:41] hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:58:44] wonderful hallelujah praise the name of
[1:58:46] the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah
[1:58:52] praise be to Jesus thank you Lord Jesus

[1:59:23] okay let's continue Honolua come up here
[1:59:27] the war this is the setting of the great
[1:59:30] battle the people that rejected God's
[1:59:33] message rejected the Holy Spirit the
[1:59:36] messenger of the seven churches oh the
[1:59:40] one that had rejected this message of
[1:59:43] His grace has nothing left but judgment
[1:59:46] and that's why with the jubilee trumpet
[1:59:49] song those who don't wanna go free had
[1:59:53] to be bored in their ear so that they
[1:59:56] will have no more effect upon them they
[1:59:59] have to hear it and they can't be
[2:00:01] released from the condition because they
[2:00:03] choose not to go free all glory to God
[2:00:07] that's exactly right
[2:00:08] when it come to that sex pert set
[2:00:11] condition he does fifty-fifty still
[2:00:13] righteous still holy still
[2:00:15] or this is not skim milk Alleluia
[2:00:18] there's one that rejected his message of
[2:00:20] His grace but not only but judgment was
[2:00:21] ready while he was making ready to pour
[2:00:24] the plagues upon it come up here I will
[2:00:26] show you what was taking place
[2:00:27] hallelujah Moses had to act first before
[2:00:31] he saw the miracles did she humor boys
[2:00:35] had to have first before this holy
[2:00:37] fourth man in the fire they had to act
[2:00:39] on the wood so the world is not given to
[2:00:42] sit down just to think about until talk
[2:00:44] about and to explain about and to
[2:00:46] fellowship about the word confusion acts
[2:00:48] on it
[2:00:51] I'm but a short George sent me something
[2:00:54] I guess I think I'm gonna read it
[2:00:55] sometime not a night about a woman who
[2:00:58] came and she was too late for the prayer
[2:00:59] line and she was healed before of some
[2:01:02] disease or something like that and she

[2:01:10] have know or something like that and as
[2:01:12] she got healed
[2:01:12] three months later the miracle was
[2:01:15] performed on her and it brought brother
[2:01:17] George man who would take three months
[2:01:19] it took three months but it was done I
[2:01:21] said well I thought she was a believer
[2:01:23] she believed what the Prophet said Oh
[2:01:24] glory to God because of instant miracle
[2:01:27] and it have span of time miracles
[2:01:29] so what could give your miracle and it's

[2:01:40] blind man he was already healed Oh blow
[2:01:43] it up caught him I take seven days ten
[2:01:45] days who eats one month three months one
[2:01:48] year it doesn't matter your family shall
[2:01:50] be delivered he released your miracle he
[2:01:52] came back your family already raised
[2:01:54] while you're waiting on that miracle but
[2:01:56] you are acting upon what God said thank
[2:02:06] you Lord Jesus
[2:02:06] hallelujah praise God Joshua let's go
[2:02:09] back to this morning he march around the
[2:02:11] wall exactly like the chief captain told
[2:02:13] him the enemy must be was defeated
[2:02:20] because there was inside the wall but
[2:02:22] now he was going to get in how he'll get
[2:02:24] inside idea so he took a little stroll
[2:02:26] to meditate and then he's met a man he
[2:02:31] draw his sword and just what thought
[2:02:33] maybe this might wanted to be the enemy
[2:02:36] or whatever he join us on our you force
[2:02:38] are you against us and he said I am the
[2:02:40] captain of the host and he's told him
[2:02:43] what to do and it's a kind of hard thing
[2:02:46] to think watch that you could blow a
[2:02:48] trumpet and make a wall fall down
[2:02:50] awaiting the mother the instruction
[2:02:54] looking kind of flimsy that you could

[2:20:27] to spread sackcloth and ashes under him
[2:20:29] we don't call this a fast an exceptional
[2:20:33] day to the Lord it's not this the fast
[2:20:35] I have chosen what for to lose the bands
[2:20:38] of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens
[2:20:41] to let the oppressed go free and to
[2:20:44] break every yoke is it not to deal I
[2:20:51] rented the hungry
[2:20:52] that don't bring the poor that are cast
[2:20:54] out to thy house when those here's the
[2:20:56] naked that don't cover him and on a high
[2:20:58] not thyself on my own flesh then shall
[2:21:00] thy light break forth as the morning
[2:21:02] then he'll shall spring forth speedily
[2:21:04] help and thy righteousness shall go
[2:21:07] before thee the glory of the Lord shall
[2:21:09] be your rear award then thou shalt call
[2:21:11] and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry
[2:21:14] and he shall say Here I am
[2:21:16] if thou will take away from the midst of
[2:21:18] thee do you can put it for the finger
[2:21:20] and speaking fancy if thou draw all thy
[2:21:22] soul to the hungry and satisfy the
[2:21:24] afflicted then that shall delight rise
[2:21:27] in obscurity my darkness piaster Lully
[2:21:30] and the Lord shall Kinkaid he
[2:21:32] continually and satisfy thy soul and
[2:21:35] drought and make fat i bones and thou
[2:21:37] shalt be like the water garden like the
[2:21:39] spring of water whose waters feel not
[2:21:41] until I shall be of thee shall build
[2:21:44] always places those shall raise up the
[2:21:46] foundations of many generations and thou
[2:21:48] shall be called the repairer of the
[2:21:51] breach to restorer of paths to dwell in
[2:21:55] we have a great ministry ahead a great
[2:21:59] calling ahead but it's a cost that goes
[2:22:03] with it I'm almost done Ezekiel 33
[2:22:08] reading from verse 1 again the word of
[2:22:11] the Lord came unto me saying son of man
[2:22:12] speak to the share of Israel and said to
[2:22:15] them when i bring the sword upon a land
[2:22:17] if the people of the land take a man of
[2:22:22] their coasts and set him for their
[2:22:26] Watchmen well he see the sword come upon
[2:22:30] the land he blow the trumpet and warn
[2:22:33] the people then whosoever here at the
[2:22:36] strong of the trumpet and take it not
[2:22:38] warning if the sword come and take him
[2:22:41] away his blood shall be upon his all
[2:22:42] here
[2:22:43] he heard the song of the trumpet
[2:22:46] took not warning his blood shall be upon
[2:22:48] him but he had taken warning shall
[2:22:51] deliver his soul but if the watchman see
[2:22:55] the sword come and blown up the trumpet
[2:22:58] and the people be not warned if the
[2:23:02] sword come and take any person from
[2:23:04] among them he is taken away in his
[2:23:07] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[2:23:10] the watchman's and all so this give a
[2:23:15] different perspective now of this
[2:23:17] trumpet to be blown oh if the watch band
[2:23:21] or the trumpet and things happen God
[2:23:25] require at the watchman's hand the man
[2:23:29] saw Solomon so now verse 7 so sodaro
[2:23:33] Solomon I have set thee a watchman unto
[2:23:38] the house of Israel therefore thou shalt
[2:23:42] hear over at my mouth and warn them from
[2:23:45] me when I say unto the wicked a wicked
[2:23:49] man don't shall surely die if thou dost
[2:23:52] not speak to warn the wicked from his
[2:23:55] way that wicked man shall die in his
[2:23:59] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[2:24:02] thine hand nevertheless if the warn the
[2:24:06] wicked of his way to turn from it and he
[2:24:08] turn not from his way he shall die in
[2:24:11] his iniquity but there was delivered I
[2:24:13] saw therefore thou son a man speak under
[2:24:17] the house of Israel
[2:24:18] does he speak sin if our transgression
[2:24:22] of all still be upon us and we pine away
[2:24:24] holy shall we live say unto them as I
[2:24:27] live saith the Lord I have no pleasure
[2:24:28] in the death of the wicked but are the
[2:24:31] wicked till from his way and live turn
[2:24:35] me from your evil ways why will you die
[2:24:37] Oh hopes of Israel so if you see from
[2:24:41] these scriptures whatever burden for
[2:24:43] people to really repent because he wants
[2:24:45] to forgive he wants to restore he
[2:24:49] Steele he wants to bless do you believe
[2:24:51] that Isaiah 21 11 12 the buildin of Duma
[2:24:55] he cornered me or the seer watch man
[2:24:57] what of the night watchman one of the
[2:24:59] night the watchman said the morning
[2:25:01] coming and also the night if he/she will
[2:25:03] inquire in Peyer ye return come and in
[2:25:07] but abandon preach a message watched by
[2:25:09] one a night he says for and the day is
[2:25:12] talking about as soon as we get washed
[2:25:14] up and groomed up talk about people this
[2:25:15] traumatising we will meet at the tavern

[2:25:20] all this to buy body message we here
[2:25:22] today
[2:25:22] watch 100 hour trying to make a tick to
[2:25:24] joy or door life when I tell us there's
[2:25:26] a push in danger because it was finally
[2:25:29] tower he seen something and these people
[2:25:30] want a party they want to drink and what
[2:25:32] not

[2:25:49] any of this stuff that this watchman
[2:25:51] would talk about or rabbis know about
[2:25:53] this or pastors and so on we believe
[2:25:55] that there will be a possible chance to
[2:25:57] Watchmen could be right this warning
[2:26:01] thing and warning thing you know we
[2:26:03] don't have to take that so serious

[2:26:08] there's something about debt that seems
[2:26:11] to have a forewarning of it many times
[2:26:13] that loved ones before pass them across
[2:26:15] the other side a warning comes to them
[2:26:18] hallelujah Watchmen must be on duty at
[2:26:20] all times he was to warn the people of
[2:26:24] approaching dangers that was his duty to

[2:26:34] the books of astronomy and so forth he
[2:26:37] could watch the stars I'm telling the
[2:26:38] time any approaching time of the day he
[2:26:40] could tell it then he was you could see
[2:26:42] further than anyone on the ground he
[2:26:44] could see further he was up higher

[2:26:52] first thing that that was he tall
[2:26:53] first thing so they kept pistol on the
