[9:39] conversation tonight around your holy
[9:40] scriptures
[9:41] lord that you could speak to us and we
[9:43] could see lord perhaps something that we
[9:45] have never seen before in quite this way
[9:47] and lord we come tonight lord lord
[9:50] with different needs different
[9:52] situations different conditions
[9:54] different challenges different
[9:56] struggles different obstacles lord
[9:59] things that we understand things that

[10:40] lord sister donors friend lord and lord
[10:43] by this prayer

[10:50] and if there's anyone here tonight
[10:52] lord who needs a touch lord that the
[10:54] enemy has attacked in
[10:56] some way or the other lord we pray
[10:59] tonight you will touch your people
[11:01] lord may you lift your people up lord
[11:03] may you
[11:04] give clarity of mind clarity of purpose
[11:07] clarity of focus
[11:08] may the dark clouds move back there are
[11:11] dark clouds in the
[11:12] atmosphere right now there are warnings
[11:15] of the
[11:16] the weather and the weather patterns but
[11:18] lord they are also
[11:19] spiritual clouds law that affect people
[11:22] in different ways but
[11:24] lord you looked at the darkness in
[11:26] genesis and said let there
[11:28] be light and the light pushed back the
[11:30] darkness may you push back
[11:32] the darkness tonight by the light of
[11:34] your word the light of your written word
[11:36] lord and
[11:37] that became so illuminated to us by the
[11:40] revealing of the word through your
[11:41] prophet messenger malachi 4
[11:44] lord may you speak to us tonight may you
[11:45] bless those that are here those that
[11:47] would join us those that
[11:48] may hear the tape and may you speak to
[11:50] us tonight in a special way
[11:52] we thank you lord for this opportunity
[11:55] we don't take it for granted
[11:57] lord we have seen how the way
[12:00] we would lord i want to use the word
[12:02] traditionally worship has been
[12:04] interrupted lord and father this is
[12:07] this is what we are doing now and we
[12:09] don't know how long this will last
[12:11] because lord there's coming a time when
[12:13] we would not even be able to do this so
[12:14] we
[12:15] don't take it for granted at all father
[12:17] we we we take this opportunity to be
[12:19] grateful to be thankful
[12:21] lord for how you have made a way for us
[12:24] lord when
[12:24] father lord so much is going on and and
[12:27] to know that one day your prophet said
[12:29] the last song will be sung the last
[12:31] sermon would be preached
[12:32] lord and the door would be shot and lord
[12:35] those that are inner in those that are
[12:36] out lord
[12:38] bible speaks of a time when he who is
[12:40] filthy is filthy still he who is
[12:43] righteous
[12:44] is righteous still and we see the clock
[12:46] ticking down
[12:47] to zero hour to midnight hour lord when
[12:50] there is no time
[12:51] left so as we approach your word tonight
[12:54] may you
[12:55] speak to us lord in the simple way that
[12:57] you
[12:58] would do father lord and lord to see how
[13:00] the great mystery of god
[13:02] could be veiled in the simplicity of the
[13:04] lord jesus christ when he walked the
[13:06] earth all that was complex was made
[13:08] simple
[13:08] lord so simple that the pharisees mister
[13:11] it's so simple the sad you see is misted
[13:13] so simple the theological
[13:16] aristocracy of the day fear to recognize
[13:19] that
[13:20] deity messiah was in their midst law let
[13:22] us not
[13:23] lord fall victim to that but maybe we
[13:25] realize that you are still the same
[13:26] yesterday today and forever
[13:28] may you speak to young and old may you
[13:30] speak to those that are
[13:32] lord working those that are looking for
[13:34] jobs those that are
[13:35] tired those that are strong whatever the
[13:37] need is the situation is may you
[13:39] walk out the pages of the bible lord may
[13:41] you reveal yourself to those who know
[13:43] very little may you reveal yourself to
[13:45] those who may know a lot
[13:47] lord because there's so much more to
[13:49] learn and in our own way may you
[13:51] give us a personal experience with you
[13:53] tonight as we walk along the way in the
[13:55] precious name of jesus christ
[13:56] and the church says amen amen and amen
[14:00] well certainly
[14:01] a great privilege and an honor to be
[14:03] with you tonight
[14:05] and uh to be in fellowship around the
[14:07] word of god
[14:08] and uh to thank him for his mercy his
[14:11] love
[14:12] his grace to us certainly appreciate uh
[14:15] the service last sunday
[14:17] and uh the water was a tremendous
[14:19] blessing and
[14:20] uh brother anthony uh last wednesday
[14:22] night as well
[14:23] uh to see how god is dealing with his
[14:26] children his people in different ways to
[14:28] keep us encouraged to keep us motivated
[14:31] to keep us focused it's
[14:33] so easy to lose focus you know
[14:36] there's so much that's that's going on
[14:38] and it's so easy to lose focus in in
[14:40] in the time that we live in and uh it's
[14:43] important
[14:44] that we we find ways to
[14:47] to stay on point to stay you know
[14:51] you know on the wood and to not fall
[14:53] victim to distractions
[14:55] and everything else the cares of life
[14:57] you know the bible says all that is in
[14:59] the world
[14:59] loss of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[15:01] the pride of life
[15:02] you know and um it's either that or it's
[15:05] it's the influence of god
[15:07] you know and and as we we look to god to
[15:10] speak to us
[15:11] in simple ways it's for us to to to
[15:14] prove that there's something in us
[15:16] uh that is a seed germ that we didn't
[15:19] put there but god pleased there so i
[15:21] i thank you tonight for your presence i
[15:24] thank you tonight for
[15:25] the the the acceptance challenge as it
[15:28] were
[15:29] to report for duty as true soldiers
[15:32] in the army of the lord tonight so i
[15:35] have a little
[15:36] study uh and um i always say
[15:40] one of uh the reason i enjoy
[15:43] bible studies is that it's not preaching
[15:45] um it allows us to sit a while and
[15:48] and kind of have a conversation as if we
[15:51] we in the same house i know we can't
[15:54] physically all be in
[15:55] in one house right now but um this
[15:58] technology allows us to do just that so
[16:00] kind of relax you know and kind of have
[16:04] a conversation
[16:05] uh looking at what we may have seen
[16:07] before but just taking some time to kind
[16:09] of
[16:10] chat about it discuss it kind of slow
[16:12] down a little bit and kind of look at it
[16:14] again and
[16:15] look at ourselves and and even get a
[16:17] deeper level of understanding
[16:19] of how the dots are connected in
[16:21] scripture
[16:23] you know and i realize that uh as
[16:25] believers
[16:26] our fortification is the word we know
[16:28] this our strength is in the word our
[16:31] confidence is in the word our assurance
[16:33] is in the word
[16:34] so the more you get clarity and
[16:37] understanding of the scripture
[16:40] which is the written word and clarity
[16:41] and understanding
[16:43] of the revealed word which shines light
[16:46] on the written word
[16:47] it puts you in a position that it
[16:50] becomes
[16:50] very difficult to move you if not
[16:52] impossible to move you because the word
[16:54] is your protection
[16:55] and the word is your defense but the
[16:58] branham said
[16:59] if eve had stayed behind the word
[17:02] the devil could have never gotten to her
[17:04] so if her defense was not in her
[17:07] knowledge her defense was not in her
[17:08] ability her defense was in one
[17:11] simple principle staying behind the word
[17:14] because the word is powerful enough to
[17:16] defend
[17:17] the world is powerful enough to attack
[17:19] the world is powerful enough to keep you
[17:22] when you cannot keep yourself that is
[17:23] what the word is for tonight
[17:27] so i want to take a little thought
[17:29] tonight and i kind of want to start
[17:32] um our substantive text will be
[17:35] in the book of saint matthew and
[17:38] i'm going to kind of fast forward the
[17:41] book and then kind of
[17:43] rewind the book and then pull a few
[17:45] things um
[17:46] i don't intend to be too long with you
[17:48] tonight um
[17:50] but by grace you want to take a look at
[17:52] this tonight
[17:53] so i actually want to start with
[17:56] just reading uh what should be a
[17:59] very very very very familiar scripture
[18:02] um
[18:04] to kind of put some context
[18:08] and kind of uh i guess i i draw my title
[18:11] from there
[18:12] and it's somewhat of a foundation for me
[18:14] tonight
[18:15] and it is taken from the lord's
[18:19] prayer which is matthew 6 and i'm
[18:22] reading from matthew deliberately
[18:24] uh after this manner this is matthew 6
[18:27] and verse 9
[18:29] after this manner therefore pray ye
[18:32] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[18:35] be
[18:36] thy name and i'm not
[18:39] really trying to teach on the lord's
[18:41] prayer tonight but just to
[18:43] draw reference that the approach
[18:46] to prayer starts uh with
[18:49] worship and um as a
[18:52] as a principle god structures things a
[18:54] certain way many
[18:56] of us when we approach prayer we
[18:58] approach prayer from a
[18:59] petition and ask in position and we see
[19:03] that in jesus teaching about prayer
[19:06] he references god his power his
[19:09] majesty his dominion his authority
[19:12] before he reaches the point to ask for
[19:14] anything
[19:15] he starts off with establishing and
[19:17] acknowledging
[19:19] uh the position that god has his his
[19:22] placement his authority his majesty
[19:24] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[19:26] be thy name and before he
[19:28] meets a request he further goes on thy
[19:31] kingdom come
[19:32] thy will be done on earth or in earth
[19:36] as it is in heaven so now he he still
[19:40] hasn't asked for anything yet
[19:42] he is firmly now giving honor
[19:45] giving praise understanding what god is
[19:49] what he represents
[19:50] what the kingdom is what it represents
[19:52] the authority that god has and that he
[19:54] is now subject to that authority so that
[19:56] will be done in earth as it is
[19:58] and then he comes down to the petition
[20:00] give us is the
[20:01] our daily bread and he goes on and
[20:04] forgive us our debts
[20:06] as we forgive our debtors and lead us
[20:09] not
[20:09] into temptation but deliver us from evil
[20:12] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[20:14] and the glory forever
[20:16] amen now there's one line in there that
[20:19] i want to kind of touch
[20:20] on tonight and it's that and lead us not
[20:23] into temptation and if well it's going
[20:26] to take a little thought around that it
[20:28] will be and lead us not
[20:30] into temptation and i was
[20:34] having a sort of fellowship around
[20:37] this topic of temptation and
[20:40] i was having a conversation with brother
[20:42] ovid about it and i was saying that
[20:45] you know when jesus was teaching
[20:48] this prayer and he was speaking about
[20:52] leaders not
[20:53] into temptation it was not simply
[20:56] a prayer or statement to him
[21:00] because jesus understood what temptation
[21:03] was
[21:05] so there's a gravity to his statement
[21:09] of and lead us not into temptation it's
[21:12] one thing
[21:12] if you say i don't want to have to go
[21:14] through something and you never went
[21:16] through it
[21:17] so you have you know you might have an
[21:19] experience that somebody else went
[21:21] through
[21:21] and it's and by their own testimony you
[21:24] don't want to experience it so somebody
[21:25] say well
[21:26] you know if you if you have to go on and
[21:28] and and
[21:29] and do some type of surgery or something
[21:31] or do some kind of thing
[21:32] you know a rough experience so you know
[21:35] you don't want to go
[21:36] but it's still here see it's still
[21:39] somebody's experience
[21:40] and they tell you well when you go by
[21:42] the dentist and if you have to to pull
[21:44] that that tooting back real hood and
[21:46] then
[21:47] you're right in your mind your your your
[21:51] you're living in that so you say well i
[21:52] ain't going by no dentist because my
[21:54] uncle tell me when he went in a real
[21:56] hood
[21:56] and and your testimony or your decision
[21:59] is based on hearing what somebody else
[22:02] went through or somewhat somebody else
[22:04] endured and based on
[22:05] their negative experience so to speak
[22:09] you know you are taking a position based
[22:11] on their negative
[22:14] experience but this is not that because
[22:17] jesus is saying and lead us not into
[22:19] temptation and this is matthew 6
[22:21] and that's why i say no when you rewind
[22:23] two chapters earlier
[22:25] you reach to matthew 4 where jesus goes
[22:28] through his own
[22:30] temptation so
[22:33] when when people speak and they they
[22:36] they they say things a certain way and
[22:40] they went through certain experiences so
[22:41] don't wait to it all right
[22:43] so now i want to get down to somewhat of
[22:45] our our substantive teaching which is
[22:48] with his matthew 4 is where we will
[22:51] spend our time
[22:52] in tonight's study and we will touch a
[22:54] few scriptures and we'll touch a few
[22:56] things
[22:57] that the prophet spoke about and and
[23:00] speaks about and we'll see to what
[23:01] extent we can get to it tonight
[23:03] again i'm not trying to be too long with
[23:04] you this is just a little bible study
[23:07] to encourage us a little bit through
[23:10] this
[23:10] word all right now matthew 4
[23:14] comes uh you know just
[23:17] when uh jesus was was was just after
[23:20] jesus
[23:21] was baptized and we would have said
[23:23] before that out of the
[23:25] four gospels matthew mark luke and john
[23:28] which are all written from somewhat
[23:31] different perspectives
[23:32] of the very same situation matthew is
[23:35] particularly unique
[23:37] and we saw it how god used paul when he
[23:40] wanted to get an academic
[23:42] he went against saul who became paul
[23:44] because he was an academic he was a
[23:46] writer he was
[23:46] he was a learned man he couldn't use
[23:48] peter to do what paul did
[23:50] because peter wasn't really the kind of
[23:52] the kind of scribe as it were
[23:54] that paul was and when it comes to
[23:56] reading matthew mark luke and john
[23:58] matthew was the tax man he was the man
[24:00] of details he was a man of making sure
[24:02] that the books were balanced
[24:04] and the audits were done so his approach
[24:06] to detail is very very unique
[24:08] you know he what he captures we would
[24:10] have talked about how he captured the
[24:12] genealogy
[24:13] in matthew 1 uh very unique in how he
[24:16] presents
[24:17] you know the view of jesus's life on the
[24:19] earth
[24:20] and the reason i like this particular
[24:22] study tonight
[24:23] it's because ultimately many people have
[24:27] missed this focus of jesus all right
[24:30] people fight for doctrine they fight for
[24:33] church they fight for belief
[24:34] and somehow they miss the jesus in the
[24:37] entire story
[24:39] they miss the fact that we are all
[24:41] trying to be
[24:42] like jesus that he is our example you
[24:46] know and i was sharing
[24:47] with yesterday that when you
[24:50] look and there's so many things moving
[24:52] around and
[24:53] it has to be something in the world that
[24:55] really anchors you
[24:56] you know um there is no substitute
[24:59] for jesus you can go around looking at
[25:03] the life
[25:03] of jesus for the entire of the old
[25:06] testament
[25:07] spoke about jesus the entire of the new
[25:10] testament
[25:11] spoke about jesus the ministry of that
[25:13] elijah that great prophet
[25:15] was speaking about jesus so we should
[25:18] take
[25:18] particular attention to study everything
[25:21] around
[25:21] jesus and not miss anything at all
[25:24] because that's who we want to be like
[25:26] so i want to start before we really hit
[25:29] four
[25:30] uh i want to start from the end of three
[25:32] so we understand the context into four
[25:34] so matthew 3 and verse 16 and jesus
[25:39] when he was baptized went up straightway
[25:41] out of the water and lo
[25:43] the heavens were opened unto him and he
[25:46] saw the spirit of god descending like a
[25:48] dove
[25:49] and lighting upon him and law a voice
[25:52] from heaven saying
[25:54] this is my beloved son
[25:57] in whom i am well pleased and
[26:01] just after that we now meet matthew 4
[26:03] verse 1
[26:05] then so this is a continuation
[26:08] so then the word then means we are
[26:11] continuing
[26:12] then was jesus led up
[26:15] of the spirit this is matthew 4 verse 1
[26:18] into the wilderness to be tempted
[26:22] of the devil now this one verse here
[26:26] is like three services in one because
[26:28] this is a this is a lot
[26:30] this is a lot and i want to kind of
[26:31] tarry here a little bit now
[26:34] life is about testing
[26:38] you don't get a driver's license unless
[26:41] you do
[26:42] a driver's test you cannot
[26:45] get certain jobs unless you do certain
[26:49] tests even if you have no o levels a
[26:52] levels
[26:53] b levels no levels even to take a job
[26:56] interview is a test nobody just
[27:00] hires you unless you will enter some
[27:02] kind of a test
[27:04] even if the test is pick up that here
[27:06] move it there okay you can do that
[27:08] come on work there has to be some
[27:11] way for anybody to assess if you could
[27:15] do
[27:16] what you say you could do so go into the
[27:18] bank
[27:19] and try to make a withdrawal there's a
[27:21] test show me id card
[27:23] somehow or the other there's something
[27:25] that has to be
[27:26] proven there's always about proving in
[27:28] life
[27:30] so at this point in jesus's ministry
[27:33] it is as if he comes to a test the issue
[27:37] is not
[27:37] if he is son because when you read in
[27:40] verse 3
[27:41] we know who he is beloved inside an imam
[27:43] well please
[27:44] but now jesus is being led by the spirit
[27:49] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[27:51] devil
[27:53] a few things in there i want to draw our
[27:54] attention to
[27:56] jesus led of the spirit
[28:01] into the wilderness so
[28:05] this wilderness or the concept of
[28:08] wilderness
[28:09] and i'm just going to take some liberty
[28:10] here
[28:12] wilderness represents dryness
[28:16] it represents barrenness it represents
[28:19] emptiness it represents
[28:21] a lack of something whenever you hear
[28:23] wilderness
[28:24] you don't think of harvest you don't
[28:27] think of fruit
[28:28] you don't think of everything is is
[28:30] great
[28:31] and a wilderness everybody
[28:34] goes through some kind of a wilderness
[28:38] wilderness is part of life so wilderness
[28:42] is not just a physical so i don't want
[28:43] you to see it
[28:44] as jesus in this a desert and it's just
[28:47] that type of wilderness
[28:49] everyone in this room has their own
[28:51] wilderness they go through
[28:54] your wilderness could be in your
[28:56] finances
[28:58] your willingness could be in
[28:59] relationship you could be going through
[29:02] a wilderness on your job
[29:04] you could be going to a wilderness in
[29:05] your health you're going through some
[29:08] place in your life that when you look at
[29:11] it you recognize listen boy this is the
[29:12] wilderness
[29:14] and that's seeing fruit when the
[29:17] disciples went and fished and caught
[29:18] nothing
[29:19] that was like a wilderness so i want you
[29:21] to see the wilderness
[29:23] in the in the context of what it also
[29:25] represents because whenever you
[29:27] type wilderness in scripture it is about
[29:30] this place of hardship
[29:32] there's a tough spot to be in and i want
[29:34] you to see it that
[29:35] and i want you to see it from a deeper
[29:36] perspective as well because we slowing
[29:38] down here
[29:39] that as much as god was pleased with
[29:43] jesus
[29:44] as much as he loved jesus as much as he
[29:47] was
[29:48] identified with jesus it did not stop
[29:51] god
[29:52] from sending him into our wilderness
[29:58] so so i want us to appreciate the fact
[30:00] because many times
[30:02] people talk about are going through a
[30:04] dry spell
[30:06] the only time people tell me that i'm
[30:07] going through a dry spell so you know
[30:08] what they're going through our
[30:09] wilderness
[30:10] the joy i used to have in your spirit i
[30:12] don't have it no more are going through
[30:14] they're not they may not use the word
[30:15] you know but they're describing the
[30:17] attributes of the thing
[30:19] are going through our wilderness i go
[30:22] into a rough time
[30:23] i used to be on fire i used to be
[30:25] shouting i used to be but i find myself
[30:28] in a wilderness and i want you to see it
[30:31] from different contexts
[30:32] no now that we have described and
[30:36] put a tag or a description on this state
[30:39] of being
[30:40] when things are not ideal when things
[30:43] are not what you would like it to be
[30:45] or this is not what you hoped it would
[30:47] be this pandemic that we are in right
[30:49] now is a wilderness
[30:52] i know a lot of people who thought that
[30:54] they were diversified
[30:55] that they were protected that things
[30:57] were going to be all right that they
[30:58] they planned for 2020
[31:00] they started january 1st for 2020
[31:03] talking about how
[31:04] good this year was going to be and we
[31:05] had another detail and they have
[31:07] everything
[31:08] and then all of a sudden they find
[31:10] themselves in a wilderness
[31:12] who lost their job who business have to
[31:15] close
[31:15] what have to happen who end up in a sick
[31:18] bed who
[31:19] healthy people end up in a wilderness of
[31:22] being sick
[31:23] wilderness now i want to make a
[31:26] distinction now because i rewind it back
[31:27] in the same verse
[31:29] and jesus was led up of the
[31:32] spirit into the wilderness
[31:35] so matthew is making a very clear
[31:38] statement
[31:39] that it was not that jesus by accident
[31:41] end up in the wilderness
[31:44] it was not jesus make a bad decision and
[31:47] end up in the wilderness
[31:49] this was god designing it or
[31:52] to use the word here leading him into
[31:55] the wilderness
[31:57] now before we go any further it means
[32:00] now we have to make this distinction
[32:02] this is
[32:02] very simple and i hope it encourages you
[32:04] in some way we have to make a
[32:05] distinction
[32:06] between you planning deliberately
[32:10] strategizing
[32:11] by making bad decisions to end up in
[32:14] your wilderness
[32:15] that is not what i'm talking about
[32:19] so there are people who through bad
[32:21] decisions bad choices
[32:23] end up in their wilderness and you have
[32:25] your spirit leading into the wilderness
[32:27] so you'll hear about over preaching many
[32:28] times
[32:29] you have yet to be led by the spirit
[32:33] into your place of trying you are yet to
[32:35] be led
[32:36] by the spirit into your proving ground
[32:40] because jesus couldn't get to the next
[32:42] step of his ministry without passing
[32:44] through this place of testing
[32:45] this place of trial these this
[32:48] particular situation
[32:49] anybody with me tonight so i want to
[32:51] kind of dig a little deeper in there
[32:54] so there is a difference friends between
[32:56] god
[32:57] leading you into a situation
[33:00] and you finding yourself in a situation
[33:05] most of us are in trouble because
[33:09] we made decisions that put us in a
[33:12] situation
[33:12] and it's not god letters there
[33:16] and when you connect this one verse
[33:19] to the lord's prayer with jesus being
[33:22] led here to be tempted of the devil
[33:24] and now in matthew's secrecy and lead us
[33:27] not into temptation because
[33:28] temptation is not a nice place to be in
[33:33] i want to stick to together but i want
[33:35] to make the distinction again
[33:36] that god is suffering you could pray
[33:40] but god is sovereign enough to know
[33:42] what's best for you
[33:43] what's best for me and he has to decide
[33:46] what he has to take us through so as
[33:50] much as jesus would pray lead us
[33:52] not into temptation god could decide
[33:56] what journey you have to take and it
[33:58] needs to be made clear god is never the
[34:00] one to tempt and there are many
[34:01] scriptures on that
[34:02] so it's not god ever tempting but god
[34:06] could put you in a situation to be
[34:07] tested he could place you in a position
[34:10] to be tried
[34:11] why would he do it because sorry he has
[34:14] to be sure
[34:15] that you can handle whatever has to come
[34:18] your way
[34:19] so it is not for us to be afraid of the
[34:22] test
[34:23] it is for us to understand that the test
[34:25] is coming
[34:26] and many of us we are in a test we are
[34:28] in a trial
[34:29] and i'm trusting and praying to god that
[34:32] you are looking at this
[34:33] from spiritual eyes to see what god
[34:36] wants you
[34:36] to see tonight so we still in matthew
[34:40] 4 verse 1 then was jesus led above the
[34:43] spirit
[34:44] into the wilderness to be tempted
[34:47] of the devil so it's not again i want to
[34:49] make the point
[34:51] and the bible says that we will get it i
[34:52] believe in james we say let no man see
[34:55] is god tempting me so if you
[34:59] go into some type of temptation don't
[35:02] blame god he is not the one tempting
[35:05] all right so let's go now we in
[35:10] canada wrapping up one we might touch it
[35:13] again
[35:14] verse two and when he had fasted 40 days
[35:18] and 40 nights he was afterward
[35:21] and hungry so
[35:25] i was having a conversation about this
[35:27] and i was saying you know
[35:30] temptation is part of life
[35:34] there will always be some temptation but
[35:37] temptation is always amplified
[35:40] when you're in a wilderness and when
[35:43] you're hungry
[35:45] i'm not talking about hungry as in food
[35:47] hungry i just talking about
[35:48] jesus was so hungry after 40 days and 40
[35:51] nights
[35:52] that it's different if somebody comes
[35:54] with food on day one and somebody have a
[35:57] food on day 40 after you go to a period
[36:01] of this level of not having and in this
[36:04] case jesus was
[36:05] fasting how more attractive
[36:10] the temptation would come and i took
[36:13] this
[36:14] whole thought tonight friends because in
[36:17] looking at this whole
[36:18] pandemic in looking at
[36:22] what is happening in the spiritual realm
[36:24] in the governmental realm
[36:26] and these and all these things that are
[36:27] taking place in this time that we're
[36:29] living in now
[36:31] people are forced
[36:34] to be more real than they've ever been
[36:36] before
[36:38] you have a real choice because we have
[36:42] lost the privilege
[36:43] to see you on a sunday so you are who
[36:46] you are when you're by yourself
[36:48] you have a choice how you live how you
[36:51] speak how you dress how you act if you
[36:54] pray if you don't pray
[36:56] what life you live many people
[37:01] the contact on a sunday as it were is a
[37:03] real
[37:04] encouragement to push you to make it
[37:06] through when you see somebody else and
[37:08] you shake a hand and you say god bless
[37:10] you and you feel charged
[37:13] but but that level of interaction is no
[37:15] longer there
[37:16] so when you're by yourself because jesus
[37:19] was there by himself and there was
[37:20] he was indeed another a club around him
[37:22] a support system around him
[37:24] he is there and it's him and his
[37:26] thoughts and a situation
[37:28] and many times in periods of what maybe
[37:31] deem some level of isolation when
[37:33] temptation comes you have nobody to say
[37:35] you shouldn't do that you know you know
[37:39] you shouldn't do that
[37:40] but then again i was looking at it from
[37:42] and and and from from the time we're
[37:44] living in
[37:45] to see how different
[37:48] situations creep up on people
[37:52] when they're in their wilderness and
[37:55] you're hungry
[37:56] things are happening as you would and i
[37:58] was sharing with somebody recently
[38:00] that uh the central bank of trinidad and
[38:04] tobago
[38:05] the fiu the sec the the the
[38:09] the banks the credit unions put out some
[38:12] disclosure recently
[38:13] about some so that they say that they're
[38:16] real susu
[38:17] and they say the problem is and the
[38:19] reason these things proliferate
[38:21] is they thrive in periods of crisis
[38:24] they say under normal circumstances if
[38:27] people have
[38:28] normal jobs and they don't these things
[38:30] don't creep up but
[38:32] in a period of hunger in a period of
[38:34] desperation in a period of where
[38:36] jobs are lost and and people trying to
[38:38] make ends meet
[38:40] then opportunities that people would not
[38:42] ever look at before
[38:43] suddenly become more attractive it's a
[38:45] temptation
[38:47] now the thing of it is when people hear
[38:50] about temptation
[38:51] they default to thinking sexual
[38:54] temptation
[38:55] alcohol temptation they default to
[38:57] thinking
[38:58] only certain categories of temptation
[39:01] but temptation is anything that's taken
[39:04] away away from god you know
[39:06] so a temptation is in you could be
[39:08] tempted to waste your time
[39:11] you could be tempted to not read your
[39:13] bible and consume
[39:14] other material other content that is
[39:17] breaking you down slowly and you're
[39:18] reckoning
[39:18] and and if you don't see it for what it
[39:20] is then you will realize you're being
[39:22] tempted and being drawn away
[39:24] from what your purpose is in life
[39:28] there are some people tonight not in
[39:30] this room and they have no real excuse
[39:32] for not being here
[39:36] and unless it's a real strong excuse the
[39:38] question is what is the temptation
[39:42] oh boy oh boy
[39:45] oh boy
[39:50] so because at the end of the day our
[39:52] decisions
[39:53] are driven and we'll read it it's in
[39:55] scripture it's it's our
[39:57] own desires it's what end up manifesting
[39:59] you know
[40:01] when somebody backslide and say well
[40:02] well it was it was a person or it was a
[40:04] disorder
[40:07] what they really manifested is what's on
[40:09] the inside
[40:12] so your life you live because it's not
[40:15] god tempting but god
[40:17] looking understand his friends he's
[40:18] looking to give power
[40:20] he's looking to give anointing and
[40:22] presence understand these gifts and
[40:24] callings that without
[40:25] repentance so we're not just talking
[40:26] about gifts and calling it's not people
[40:27] with gifts we're not dealing with gifts
[40:29] we're dealing with a time of power and
[40:32] god looking to pour
[40:33] power on sons and daughters who have
[40:36] overcome
[40:37] overcome what the lust of the eyes the
[40:39] lust of the flesh and the pride
[40:41] of life these three wild attacks that
[40:44] all forms of temptation fall into one of
[40:47] these three buckets
[40:50] so i could speak tonight that's
[40:51] something you say but no woman don't
[40:53] tempt me
[40:54] i i i attempted by this that but but
[40:57] then there's a
[40:58] there's a prior life issue that you have
[41:00] dealing with there
[41:02] that don't manifest itself in running on
[41:05] a woman
[41:06] or going and drinking the bar or going
[41:08] on and
[41:09] and and you feeling holier than though
[41:11] and you're wholly an adult
[41:12] turned into into into good self bad self
[41:15] some other kind of self but at the end
[41:16] of the day you can't approach god with
[41:18] that because it's pride of life of
[41:21] pride of life is one of the powerful
[41:23] ones that manifest itself with car
[41:25] repenting
[41:28] car say i'm sorry you reach so high and
[41:31] status and station that nobody can talk
[41:33] to you
[41:34] and you don't realize that that itself
[41:35] is deception
[41:38] or the spirit of popularity there's so
[41:40] many things in there that are temptation
[41:42] that drive people away from the truth
[41:45] because understand this temptation is to
[41:48] draw
[41:49] away from it's to pull you away from
[41:53] so we talk about there'll be a famine
[41:56] not for books and tapes but fairly true
[41:58] word of god
[41:59] so people end up in a wilderness
[42:02] of not hear any word and then the
[42:04] itching ears go after false doctrine
[42:07] and fourth doctrine is attractive it is
[42:10] tempting it sounds interesting
[42:11] it's curious it's it is worthy of debate
[42:16] but we are fighting now to resist the
[42:19] devil
[42:20] resist temptation because it's never god
[42:23] tempted
[42:23] god not trying to god don't need to
[42:26] attract your attention by
[42:27] by suiting you oh boy
[42:31] the method for god to attract your
[42:33] attention is not
[42:35] this deceitful and deceptive i don't
[42:37] know come
[42:38] come come come come that is not god
[42:41] i have a quote to give you no don't
[42:44] that's not god
[42:46] he don't need to resort to the tactics
[42:49] to
[42:49] to attract your attention in that way
[42:52] that is not he's not a he's not a god
[42:54] who's trying to deceive us into
[42:55] something he's a god of truth
[42:58] he's a god of principle he's a god of
[43:00] clarity he's the god of light
[43:02] anybody with me tonight all right so i
[43:05] hope this is helping you somehow tonight
[43:08] because temptations will increase
[43:12] there will be people through this
[43:14] pandemic who
[43:16] god open up the door for church in a few
[43:18] months or whatever
[43:19] you may not see them again because they
[43:20] succumb to temptation during this period
[43:25] that's the reality of it
[43:28] can the church say amen you have young
[43:31] people who
[43:32] go to jobs and we think about it in in
[43:35] youth services
[43:37] the lord bless them with an earth job
[43:38] the gather
[43:40] two pieces of paper to certificate the
[43:42] yellow working thing
[43:43] and and and and they grew up in a nice
[43:45] home behaving their self hunting and
[43:47] and the first day they woke and think
[43:49] they did a tingling thing and after a
[43:50] while
[43:51] slowly slowly slowly they get time
[43:54] let me stay back i have to work online
[43:56] now let me let me you know and
[43:58] and i've seen so many people break down
[44:01] because they couldn't take a stand on
[44:03] something
[44:05] and in order to fit in fitting in is
[44:07] that temptation you know
[44:10] i don't want to look like i i am not a
[44:13] struck up i
[44:13] i s tush so i will i will i will i will
[44:16] lime
[44:17] i'm not gonna drink it i just and
[44:19] whatever it is so i don't know who this
[44:21] is helping tonight
[44:22] but i don't want anybody to
[44:25] to pretend to be holier than thou
[44:28] because
[44:29] jesus for it to be a temptation it meant
[44:31] and by the branham said it
[44:33] jesus was tempted in every way the bible
[44:36] says it and he didn't sin
[44:38] temptation when you are tempted it means
[44:42] that you thought
[44:43] may have run through your mind
[44:46] so mr branham said he said the
[44:47] temptation is not he said is he giving
[44:49] in to it
[44:51] is what his sin is because the
[44:53] temptation is designed
[44:54] to come at you so we talk about the
[44:57] prophet
[44:58] but ibrahim said he hung across in his
[45:00] car and we just
[45:01] laugh about this as as brothers okay say
[45:04] if that was in the
[45:05] 50s and his 60s and were but abram said
[45:07] he hung across in his car
[45:09] so when he see the woman walk the street
[45:11] he would look at the cross
[45:14] how many brothers were most only hiding
[45:16] behind any cameras
[45:17] but only high-end across any car so when
[45:20] that happens
[45:22] and i told you and people yeah so if you
[45:23] have to do it no you need to put across
[45:25] your whole car you block your whole
[45:26] window the back screw in the windscreen
[45:28] because what we have now is not what you
[45:30] have to do with them
[45:32] but i asked myself the question if he as
[45:34] the prophet
[45:35] vindicated prophet proven prophet put
[45:38] something in place
[45:39] i want you to catch enough he put
[45:41] something in place to protect himself
[45:43] who
[45:44] who is you
[45:48] who am i if the prophet in other words
[45:51] he buy an insurance policy
[45:53] here take it for granted yes sir i am
[45:56] the prophet blessed god
[45:58] these hidden filthy women on the street
[46:00] look one there look one there look one
[46:02] there
[46:03] demon demon jezebel jezebel that's not
[46:05] what he did
[46:06] he put a cross in his car so that he
[46:09] don't even
[46:10] look to see who is jezebel and who is
[46:11] not jezebel anybody with me tonight
[46:15] so it means that the prophet he
[46:17] understood
[46:18] his vulnerability i want you to catch
[46:21] that because there would be no need for
[46:23] him to do it
[46:24] if he did not understand his
[46:26] vulnerability
[46:28] and if as believers we don't understand
[46:31] now the bible say that this we are not
[46:33] ignorant of satan's devices
[46:35] we are not ignorant of the the past that
[46:38] satan have to bring thoughts to our
[46:40] minds
[46:43] so you can't move around stupid you
[46:46] can't move around
[46:47] ignorant we know better we understand
[46:49] the attack we understand we're in a war
[46:52] we understand that temptation is real
[46:54] and the devil
[46:55] if it is we are placed into temptation
[46:58] it didn't happen by accident god allowed
[47:01] it to happen
[47:02] so something could be proven
[47:05] and you have to have your systems in
[47:08] place
[47:10] just like the prophet did just like what
[47:13] jesus did that's like all those who
[47:15] stood the test of time did
[47:17] have to have something in place through
[47:19] the word
[47:21] that you can overcome but robert said it
[47:25] like this
[47:25] he said close the doors close the
[47:28] windows
[47:30] don't give room to the enemy
[47:33] close all the spaces that the enemy
[47:36] could
[47:36] try to come into your life
[47:40] anybody with me tonight
[47:43] we still in matthew you see others i
[47:46] tell myself i'm not going too long
[47:47] tonight
[47:48] and the time already moving right so
[47:51] verse 3
[47:53] and when the tempter came to him
[47:56] he said if thou be the son of god
[48:01] command that these stones he made
[48:04] bread now this verse here
[48:07] somebody is sitting on you we read this
[48:09] or no we this is not new to us we we all
[48:11] know these scriptures
[48:13] so i want us to understand that this
[48:16] here
[48:17] is not a demon it's not a devil it is
[48:20] the devil
[48:21] all right so there's somebody saying
[48:23] recently
[48:24] the devil not coming to it's not the
[48:27] devil himself coming to people you know
[48:28] he's little
[48:31] let me say that again i think someone
[48:33] look at that
[48:35] it's not the devil himself some of us
[48:40] a little situation listen
[48:45] the devil have really no time for most
[48:48] people
[48:50] it's a big operation he's running
[48:53] he is not the devil leaving hell to come
[48:56] to your pool it's not a house
[48:57] the devil have imps and little demons
[49:00] and he
[49:00] will talk about when you cast one out
[49:02] you want to bring seven more that's not
[49:04] the devil involved in that yet the devil
[49:06] is running on administration
[49:09] so i want you to understand that that's
[49:11] not a little devil a little demon
[49:13] this is this is this is the chanter
[49:15] himself came to him
[49:18] and he said if thou be the son of god
[49:20] command that these stones
[49:22] he made bread now there are many issues
[49:24] here
[49:25] one issue is the fact that the tempter
[49:29] is not actually trying to get jesus to
[49:32] do something that is sinful enough
[49:34] i want you to catch that
[49:38] from all appearances this request could
[49:41] even pass as a legitimate request
[49:46] because if you're hungry and you are who
[49:48] i think you are
[49:49] then just command it to be read and
[49:52] so it's not as if and this is what i
[49:54] remember brother i think years ago
[49:57] preach it he said the devil is the devil
[49:59] know
[50:00] that cocaine is something you would
[50:02] never take he wouldn't come until they
[50:03] take cooking you know better than that
[50:07] but the psychologists talk about what
[50:09] they call a gateway drug
[50:11] so they talk about things that open up
[50:12] into other things so they say when
[50:14] you're a smoke cigarette you might go
[50:16] onto marijuana you might go onto
[50:17] something else you might do
[50:18] taking anything and then you might end
[50:20] up so it might you're taking a long road
[50:22] to get there something open up
[50:23] until you reach there so here we have
[50:26] the first temptation
[50:27] is not even to go and drink go and smoke
[50:30] go and meet a girl go and do just go and
[50:32] do that the first
[50:33] issue is one of trying to
[50:37] understand if this vulnerability if this
[50:40] weakness can be exploited
[50:43] i know you're hungry if you are who you
[50:45] are
[50:46] just speak and command these stones be
[50:49] bred
[50:51] and but i brown i would go through this
[50:52] and talk about this was actually dealing
[50:54] with the same
[50:55] three while attacks lost in the eye must
[50:57] be first prior to life and he goes back
[50:58] into genesis
[51:00] and if you recall that first great test
[51:02] in genesis
[51:03] where let's see we finally very quickly
[51:08] is this helping anybody tonight
[51:11] lust of the eyelash to the flesh pride
[51:13] of life
[51:14] genesis 3
[51:18] and verse 6 and when the woman saw
[51:22] that the tree was good for food
[51:25] nice lots of the flesh and that it was
[51:28] pleasant to the
[51:29] eyes the rest of the eyes and a tree to
[51:32] be desired to make one wise
[51:34] pride of life she took up the fruit
[51:36] thereof and did it
[51:38] and by the branham type out that these
[51:40] three wild attacks
[51:42] these three things that all as in the
[51:45] world has fallen under one of these
[51:46] three buckets
[51:48] here it was the devil coming and trying
[51:51] to get
[51:52] jesus to bend his will when it comes for
[51:57] this element of his lust of the
[52:00] flesh but jesus
[52:03] but he answered and said it is written
[52:05] man shall not live by bread alone
[52:08] but by every word that proceeded
[52:12] out of the mouth of god
[52:17] first stress then the devil taking them
[52:20] up into the holy city so i want you to
[52:22] watch your progression now
[52:24] it went from flesh it went from
[52:28] something that didn't even seem to be
[52:29] sinful not to ignore
[52:32] the fact that jesus made it very clearly
[52:34] that he word is his defense
[52:36] but the devil take him up into the holy
[52:37] city here take him into
[52:40] the demo prostitutes here take him into
[52:43] where the people linemen are having a
[52:44] party
[52:45] he takes him up into the holy city and
[52:48] setted him on
[52:49] the pinnacle of the temple so i want you
[52:52] to understand here that
[52:53] temptation is not presented in a way
[52:56] at times that is just debauchery and
[52:59] filth
[53:00] that temptation could come to you along
[53:03] the line of something you're interested
[53:04] in
[53:05] that don't even have to look too bad i
[53:07] want you to catch it now
[53:10] the devil knows some people he can't
[53:12] even carry a nearby
[53:20] but here it is the devil take him up
[53:22] into the holy city
[53:24] and set it up on the pinnacle of the
[53:26] temple so not just
[53:28] so i want you to understand the typing
[53:29] you know the holy city on top of the
[53:31] temple
[53:33] that's his spiritual height you're
[53:35] talking about like in front of
[53:36] spiritual people religious people and
[53:39] saying unto him if thou be the son of
[53:41] god
[53:42] cast thyself down no to see how
[53:45] the devil is so subtle and so dangerous
[53:47] and i want you to appreciate
[53:49] the devil keeps saying if thou be the
[53:51] son of god
[53:52] it's it's it's the second time he says
[53:54] it and it is
[53:56] very clear friends that the devil is
[53:58] conscious of who he delivered
[54:00] it is not that he is ignorant of it
[54:02] because his next verse says
[54:03] for it is written he shall give his
[54:05] angels charged concerning thee so the
[54:07] devil is quoting scripture
[54:10] pertaining to this role that he believes
[54:13] he's speaking to
[54:14] and i want us to understand that if the
[54:16] devil not even afraid
[54:18] of going tooth and nail against jesus
[54:21] what puts you in a position of immunity
[54:25] and what would make you be so reckless
[54:28] to not finish life with your word as
[54:30] your protection
[54:32] then you will realize that you cannot
[54:34] approach life without the word
[54:38] and said unto him if thou be the son of
[54:41] god
[54:42] cast thyself down for it is written
[54:46] he shall give his angels charged
[54:48] concerned in thee
[54:49] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[54:52] up
[54:53] lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[54:56] against a stone and jesus said unto him
[55:01] it is written again thou shalt not
[55:04] tempt the lord like god
[55:07] again for the battle but bring her the
[55:09] type it's you would
[55:11] he's defending by the word all right
[55:15] so again with it
[55:18] the devil will take him up into an
[55:20] exceeding high mountain
[55:23] and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[55:26] world
[55:27] and the glory of them and he said unto
[55:30] him
[55:31] all these things will i give thee if
[55:33] thou will fall down
[55:35] and worship me and it's really really
[55:38] something
[55:39] when you look at this it is not as if
[55:41] jesus said but you can't do this sinner
[55:46] so jesus himself understood the power
[55:49] that adam had forfeited
[55:52] that allowed satan to end up in this
[55:54] position
[55:56] and here it was satan is appealing so
[55:59] he's appealing to everything that could
[56:01] possibly attract jesus's attention
[56:05] so i want us to be watchful i want us to
[56:07] be vigilant i want us to be
[56:09] sharp to understand that you each of us
[56:12] let me nail his own
[56:13] have to deal with our own version
[56:17] of this let me say that one more time
[56:20] each of us have to deal with our own
[56:24] personal individual version of this
[56:28] if jesus himself had to go through this
[56:31] on his
[56:31] journey as it were to adoption don't you
[56:34] understand that you have to also go
[56:36] through this
[56:37] don't you understand that this is given
[56:38] to us so that we can take encouragement
[56:40] from this
[56:41] to learn from this and realize that in
[56:44] our own moment
[56:45] when nobody else is around we have to be
[56:48] able to stand
[56:50] and it reinforces because jesus used the
[56:52] word and we're going to read the quote
[56:53] but the bible
[56:54] says it he had to use the word to defend
[56:57] it was not spirit
[56:58] he was using the word because the word
[56:59] is powerful enough
[57:01] so we cannot take chances with this word
[57:04] we can't play games with this word we
[57:07] can't take what we want
[57:08] and what we don't want because we don't
[57:10] know how the act how the attack will
[57:12] come
[57:12] we don't know what we will need what
[57:14] resource what tool what weapon
[57:16] we have to pull from our toolkit to deal
[57:18] with whatever challenge comes our way
[57:20] candidates amen
[57:23] then say jesus unto him
[57:26] get thee and satan for it is written
[57:29] thou shalt worship the lord thy god
[57:31] and him only shalt thou serve
[57:35] then the devil leave with him and behold
[57:36] angels came and ministered
[57:40] unto him the lord had a blessing
[57:43] to the reading of his word and just to
[57:47] kind of
[57:47] share a few more points before we wrap
[57:50] up tonight
[57:51] this thing about temptation is all
[57:53] throughout scripture
[57:55] it's all throughout life
[57:58] as we read in genesis 3 6
[58:02] eve had to deal with temptation
[58:05] and she was unable to resist
[58:09] temptation we read of the struggles
[58:12] of king david and dealing with
[58:16] temptation
[58:17] the temptation of bathsheba and in
[58:20] an attempt to cover his sin he planned
[58:24] to have bathsheba's husband killed
[58:28] we see true scripture samson
[58:32] falling to the temptation of delilah
[58:38] this these things are no surprises to us
[58:40] we are
[58:41] fully conscious of them and yet still
[58:43] centuries
[58:44] after this we still have individuals
[58:48] falling to the temptation what separates
[58:51] them from those who did not
[58:52] or who will not or who protect
[58:54] themselves
[58:56] we have the temptation of wealth or the
[58:59] attraction of goods with acon
[59:02] who after the instruction was given to
[59:05] do not mess with the stuff
[59:06] in jericho would hide the babylonian
[59:11] garment
[59:11] and hide the wedge of gold among his
[59:14] stuff
[59:15] which led to defeat to the churn of
[59:18] israel
[59:19] when god promised them that there would
[59:21] be no defeat
[59:23] that they would lose no men they would
[59:25] lose no soldiers
[59:26] but what is it that push aircon to
[59:29] make a decision to do that he actually
[59:32] yielded
[59:33] to temptation but not only do we have
[59:38] situations
[59:38] of individuals who yielded to temptation
[59:43] but
[59:43] you remember when we studied uh neyman
[59:46] and having to go and dip and we talked
[59:49] about
[59:49] um when when when uh when uh
[59:53] uh elisha was done with him and um
[59:57] he he neymar offered him some money
[1:00:01] and yeah just say i don't want it
[1:00:05] that was a temptation he said but i'm
[1:00:07] not doing it for that and then the
[1:00:08] servant was the one who went after
[1:00:10] because he
[1:00:11] he had a spirit in him that only was
[1:00:13] revealed in that particular situation
[1:00:15] and we spent time going to that so this
[1:00:17] issue of temptation is a real
[1:00:19] situation and of course jesus being the
[1:00:22] prime example
[1:00:23] of being able to stand the test of
[1:00:26] temptation
[1:00:28] and i just want to read a few scriptures
[1:00:31] from
[1:00:32] throughout the bible to speak to this uh
[1:00:35] praying that it would encourage you in
[1:00:36] some way first corinthians
[1:00:39] 10 and verse 13.
[1:00:43] they have no temptation taken you but
[1:00:46] such
[1:00:47] as is common to man but god
[1:00:50] is faithful i want us to say faithful
[1:00:53] god is faithful
[1:00:55] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:00:57] above
[1:00:58] that ye are able
[1:01:02] but will with the temptation also make a
[1:01:05] way of escape
[1:01:06] that he may be able to bear it so this
[1:01:09] is a comfort to us
[1:01:11] that no matter what the temptation is
[1:01:14] god is faithful he will not suffer he
[1:01:17] will not allow you to be tempted beyond
[1:01:19] god is faithful he will not let you be
[1:01:22] tempted beyond your ability
[1:01:24] but with the temptation he will also
[1:01:26] provide
[1:01:27] the way of escape just a quick point to
[1:01:30] that
[1:01:30] he provides a way of escape it's up to
[1:01:33] you to take you in
[1:01:35] can i say that one more time provided in
[1:01:38] a way of escape and you take anyways two
[1:01:40] different things you know
[1:01:42] so he can provide away and also
[1:01:45] make you take it away if a way is there
[1:01:47] but i better preach about god provided
[1:01:49] way
[1:01:50] the way is there the way has been there
[1:01:53] but
[1:01:54] few people are want to actually take the
[1:01:56] weight
[1:01:57] so that still shows as a measure of
[1:01:59] choice
[1:02:00] to you making a decision you know what i
[1:02:03] am going to get out of this situation
[1:02:06] anybody with me tonight all right so we
[1:02:08] just go into a few scriptures
[1:02:10] james 1 and verse 12. if you want to
[1:02:14] take note of these
[1:02:15] blessed is the man that endured
[1:02:18] temptation
[1:02:19] for when he is tried he shall receive
[1:02:23] the crown of life
[1:02:26] which the lord had promised to them that
[1:02:30] love him and the church say amen
[1:02:34] all right so i want us to catch that you
[1:02:36] know uh
[1:02:37] blessed anyone who remains in another
[1:02:39] translation said blessed
[1:02:40] who remains steadfast under trial
[1:02:44] steadfast on the trial
[1:02:48] you have to decide i am not going to
[1:02:50] give in to whatever it is
[1:02:52] what my attempt you may not attempt me
[1:02:53] what my term me may not attempt you
[1:02:55] or somebody else but whatever the trial
[1:02:58] is whatever the test comes
[1:02:59] blessed is the man there's a blessing
[1:03:01] comes from saying
[1:03:02] no i am not going i'm not doing it i'm
[1:03:06] not healing to that
[1:03:07] can the church say amen still reading
[1:03:10] from james 1 and and uh verse 13. and i
[1:03:16] said this point before but i want you to
[1:03:17] show it in scripture because there are
[1:03:19] still many people you say well this is
[1:03:21] is god who is to tempt me and some of
[1:03:23] that but let no man say when he is
[1:03:25] tempted i am tempted of god
[1:03:27] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:03:30] neither tempted he
[1:03:32] any man but listen carefully but every
[1:03:35] man
[1:03:36] is tempted when he is drawn away
[1:03:40] of his own lust and enticed
[1:03:44] and when lust had conceived it bringing
[1:03:47] forth sin
[1:03:48] and sin when it is finished bring it for
[1:03:52] debt do not uh my beloved
[1:03:56] brethren
[1:03:59] let me read that one more time i want to
[1:04:00] read it from another translation as well
[1:04:02] let
[1:04:02] no one say when he is tempted i am being
[1:04:04] tempted by god
[1:04:06] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:04:09] and he himself tempts no one
[1:04:13] but each person is tempted when he is
[1:04:15] lord
[1:04:16] and enticed by his own desire
[1:04:20] so looking at this now i want to pause
[1:04:22] there for a minute
[1:04:24] it means that for jesus to not yield to
[1:04:27] temptation
[1:04:28] it meant that the desire to give into
[1:04:31] what the devil offered was not there
[1:04:34] so there was nothing he could he
[1:04:35] couldn't respond in the way
[1:04:37] that the devil wanted him to respond
[1:04:39] because there was no desire
[1:04:41] he wasn't lusting after all of the
[1:04:44] cities of the world
[1:04:45] he wasn't lusting after the attention or
[1:04:48] the offer of the world
[1:04:50] so i wanted to deal now with this issue
[1:04:52] of the heart because
[1:04:55] each person is tempted when he is lord
[1:04:57] and enticed by
[1:04:58] his own desire so when a sister falls or
[1:05:02] brother falls or somebody backslide
[1:05:04] it is not the devil do them it is what
[1:05:07] was in
[1:05:08] their heart found a connection
[1:05:11] with the offer can i say that one more
[1:05:13] time
[1:05:15] it meant that the issue was the issue of
[1:05:17] the heart
[1:05:19] so whether it is a loss for money but
[1:05:21] i'm talking about lots of big things
[1:05:22] lost for popularity
[1:05:24] whatever it is if that desire or that
[1:05:26] lust is there when the temptation comes
[1:05:28] you will respond
[1:05:29] because it's in your heart
[1:05:32] when somebody gets up in an argument
[1:05:35] when
[1:05:36] when when is he looking for a fight you
[1:05:38] you return
[1:05:39] and you look at the pekka fight it's the
[1:05:41] desire you know the first instance when
[1:05:43] people are going to pick a fight the
[1:05:44] first thing they see that mean you need
[1:05:46] to pick a fight the fight is happening
[1:05:49] you're going to look into pick a fight
[1:05:50] you're looking for reason to blow up
[1:05:52] you're looking by reason
[1:05:53] but it's in their heart
[1:05:56] so this whole issue now of dealing with
[1:05:58] temptation now brings another dimension
[1:06:00] to it
[1:06:01] of what is in your heart and
[1:06:04] what is in your heart is a function of
[1:06:07] what
[1:06:07] you feed in your heart i want this to
[1:06:11] kind of dwell on
[1:06:12] this a little bit because and we
[1:06:15] teach on this already guard your heart
[1:06:19] because all here is heart are all the
[1:06:21] issues of life
[1:06:23] so so if in your heart you
[1:06:27] in your heart decide you know what i
[1:06:28] want to have this or that or whatever it
[1:06:31] is that's the only way when any
[1:06:33] temptation come i want to nail it down
[1:06:34] that alignment takes place so we want to
[1:06:37] break that tonight in two ways you want
[1:06:39] to break it by the word
[1:06:41] but more and even on a deeper level you
[1:06:43] want to deal with the issue of the
[1:06:45] desires of your heart
[1:06:48] what is your desire tonight
[1:06:51] what is your desire tonight let me nail
[1:06:53] it down again
[1:06:55] let no one say when he is tempted i am
[1:06:57] being tempted by god
[1:06:59] for god cannot be tempted with evil and
[1:07:01] he himself tempts no one
[1:07:03] but each person is tempted when he is
[1:07:06] lord or attracted
[1:07:07] and enticed by his own desire
[1:07:11] so when a young sister leave church cut
[1:07:14] her hair
[1:07:15] put on makeup throw on her pants it's
[1:07:17] not the devil do that
[1:07:20] that was in the heart and it was growing
[1:07:23] growing growing until it got so big
[1:07:27] and this is why we say when people leave
[1:07:28] church they don't happen nobody walks
[1:07:30] our children are saying they say today
[1:07:32] i live in church you know
[1:07:35] something was growing in the heart so
[1:07:38] that when the temptation come
[1:07:39] there's a connection building until that
[1:07:42] connection
[1:07:43] becomes so strong they could no longer
[1:07:45] feel comfortable in the presence of god
[1:07:50] friends don't allow this season that we
[1:07:53] in
[1:07:54] to allow the desires of the world to
[1:07:56] grow on your life
[1:07:58] anybody with me tonight each person is
[1:08:01] tempted i want to kneel it down
[1:08:03] when he is lord and enticed by his own
[1:08:06] desire
[1:08:07] let us check our desires tonight david
[1:08:10] made clear his
[1:08:11] eyes he and the heart pointed out to the
[1:08:13] water broke so my heart
[1:08:14] just after thee that was his desire
[1:08:18] we sing this song this is my desire to
[1:08:21] honor you
[1:08:24] lord with all my heart i worship you
[1:08:29] friends if you find yourself young
[1:08:32] brother young sister
[1:08:34] old but a old sister caleb describe it
[1:08:37] however you
[1:08:38] want to because i've seen young i've
[1:08:39] seen all i've seen
[1:08:41] all kind of people lose their zeal for
[1:08:44] the word
[1:08:44] because of what was in their heart
[1:08:49] i mean we try to close this up here but
[1:08:51] each person is tempted
[1:08:52] when he is lord lord means it's like a
[1:08:55] snake an attraction something pulling
[1:08:57] you by your own desire
[1:08:58] then desire listen is a progression
[1:09:01] when it has conceived in other words
[1:09:04] when that you know that conception
[1:09:06] that desire when it is realized
[1:09:10] so what brother branham was doing when
[1:09:12] he put a cross in his car
[1:09:13] he was trying to nip it at the body
[1:09:16] because the bible said when you look at
[1:09:18] the woman to lust after her your heart
[1:09:20] past tense
[1:09:21] already committed adultery in your heart
[1:09:24] so he actually took the whole thing from
[1:09:27] the beginning of the equation
[1:09:29] and not even reached the point to look
[1:09:31] to lust
[1:09:32] to have desire he stop it early because
[1:09:35] this is saying
[1:09:36] each person is tempted i want you to
[1:09:38] catch it when he is lord
[1:09:40] and enticed by his own desire then
[1:09:42] desire
[1:09:43] when it has conceived give birth to sin
[1:09:46] and when sin and sin when it is fully
[1:09:49] grown
[1:09:50] so you see you seen this here so sid
[1:09:52] could actually grow
[1:09:54] and reach a point of full growth
[1:09:57] when sin is fully grown it brings for
[1:10:00] debt
[1:10:01] i want to nail this down friends
[1:10:04] because debt is striking individuals
[1:10:07] right now they're walking wrong
[1:10:08] as dead men
[1:10:12] because their desire has been conceived
[1:10:16] and given birth to sin and that sin is
[1:10:19] growing
[1:10:19] and growing and growing until debt and
[1:10:22] they could hear you would
[1:10:24] they could even believe the word but
[1:10:25] they did because if the devil could
[1:10:27] believe
[1:10:28] and tremble the belief alone is not
[1:10:31] enough
[1:10:31] it has to be a heart change is there
[1:10:34] anybody tonight who wants a heart change
[1:10:38] let's go on proverbs 6
[1:10:42] 28 can one go
[1:10:46] upon hot coals and his feet not be
[1:10:49] burned
[1:10:51] i'll say it one more time can one go
[1:10:53] upon hot coals
[1:10:55] and his feet not be burned
[1:10:59] in other words if you know
[1:11:02] what your vulnerability is
[1:11:05] why would you put yourself in a position
[1:11:08] to get destroyed
[1:11:10] because if you play with fire you're
[1:11:12] going to get burned
[1:11:13] can anybody go on hot coals and not get
[1:11:15] burned
[1:11:19] how are you protecting yourself in this
[1:11:21] season
[1:11:22] and i talk about being fearful i'm
[1:11:24] talking about protecting that seed in
[1:11:26] your soul
[1:11:27] by making better choices
[1:11:30] better decisions i've said it before
[1:11:34] like this i said
[1:11:34] you cannot be praying shouting
[1:11:37] worshipping
[1:11:38] and just switch from that into that
[1:11:39] argument with somebody something wrong
[1:11:41] you was not in the spirit
[1:11:44] it's impossible for you to be tarry and
[1:11:47] sick and you wake up early earlier like
[1:11:49] seek the scripture
[1:11:50] and you get up from your knees and
[1:11:53] having an argument with somebody
[1:11:55] you just came from the presence of god
[1:11:57] you could switch that easily
[1:12:00] so the more you are in the presence of
[1:12:02] god
[1:12:03] it's more your behavior your motives
[1:12:06] your objectives because you're feeding
[1:12:07] on something
[1:12:08] your fees can so if you want an antidote
[1:12:11] to stop
[1:12:11] argument pray just keep praying
[1:12:15] when you're feeling to respond and an
[1:12:18] escalating situation let's say
[1:12:20] i'm gonna pray i just go and
[1:12:23] lock your door lock your window go find
[1:12:27] quantity bed and pray
[1:12:28] until that sweet presence of god comes
[1:12:30] over your life
[1:12:32] and the church say amen let's go on
[1:12:39] matthew 26 and verse 41.
[1:12:43] i didn't even realize this was the next
[1:12:44] one watch and pray
[1:12:46] that he entered not into temptation
[1:12:49] i was just saying it the last one i say
[1:12:51] when you feel it go and pray but look at
[1:12:53] the scripture here
[1:12:54] watch and pray that he enter not
[1:12:58] into temptation his spirit indeed is
[1:13:00] willing
[1:13:01] but the flesh is weak
[1:13:05] so this puts a whole different dimension
[1:13:08] to prayer meetings and your own prayer
[1:13:10] life
[1:13:11] your own prayer life that gives you
[1:13:14] fortification that gives you defense
[1:13:16] i'm not gonna be too much longer with
[1:13:17] you
[1:13:24] and of course we read the scripture from
[1:13:25] the lord's prayer and lead us not in the
[1:13:27] temptation but deliver us from evil
[1:13:29] now i just have a few quotes on the
[1:13:31] prophet just kind of tie this up and
[1:13:33] then one more scripture
[1:13:34] and we will close out in prayer tonight
[1:13:39] from the expression of the seven church
[1:13:41] ages but abraham is speaking about
[1:13:43] revelation 3
[1:13:44] 21 he says to him that overcome it
[1:13:48] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:13:51] even as i also overcame and i'm set down
[1:13:55] with my father in his throne now what
[1:13:58] are we
[1:13:58] to overcome that is the normal question
[1:14:02] to ask here
[1:14:04] but that is not the actual thought of
[1:14:06] this verse for it is not so much
[1:14:08] what we are to overcome listen carefully
[1:14:11] but
[1:14:11] how we are to overcome so but ibrahim is
[1:14:15] saying this scripture
[1:14:16] the logical thing is to ask what are we
[1:14:19] to overcome
[1:14:20] but he said the real thing is really how
[1:14:23] we are to overcome
[1:14:25] now this is logical for what for does it
[1:14:28] matter much what we are doing as long as
[1:14:30] we
[1:14:30] know how we can overcome how how a quick
[1:14:33] look at those scriptures which involve
[1:14:35] the lord jesus overcoming
[1:14:37] will break out the truth of this
[1:14:39] proposition
[1:14:40] in matthew 4 which we read wherein jesus
[1:14:44] is
[1:14:44] tempted of the devil he overcame
[1:14:47] the personal temptations of satan by the
[1:14:50] word
[1:14:51] and by the word only in each
[1:14:54] of the three major trials that
[1:14:57] corresponded exactly
[1:14:59] to the temptation of the garden of eden
[1:15:01] which we touched on
[1:15:02] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:15:04] eye and the pride of life
[1:15:06] jesus overcame by the word eve
[1:15:10] fell to the personal temptation of satan
[1:15:13] by failing to use the word so listen to
[1:15:16] jesus listen to the birth making the
[1:15:18] distinction now
[1:15:19] he said that jesus in each of them
[1:15:23] three major trials that corresponded
[1:15:25] exactly
[1:15:26] to the temptation of the garden of eden
[1:15:28] he brings the parallel which we did as
[1:15:30] well
[1:15:30] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:15:32] eye and the pride of life
[1:15:34] jesus overcame by the word so he
[1:15:36] overcame by the word
[1:15:37] he fell to the personal temptation of
[1:15:40] satan by
[1:15:41] failing to use the word so jesus
[1:15:43] overcame by the word
[1:15:45] he said if even use the word at all
[1:15:48] so jesus used you would eve
[1:15:51] did not use the word and listen adam
[1:15:55] fell in direct disobedience to the word
[1:15:58] so he puts adam in a whole different
[1:16:00] category because eve
[1:16:02] should have stayed behind the defense of
[1:16:04] the world she use it but not adam who
[1:16:07] knew the word was disobedient to the
[1:16:09] word
[1:16:10] i want us to cash out now tonight all
[1:16:12] right so
[1:16:13] but jesus overcame by the word and right
[1:16:15] now so let me say
[1:16:17] listen to brother madam that this is the
[1:16:19] only way
[1:16:20] to be an overcomer also it is the only
[1:16:24] way
[1:16:24] that you can know if you are overcoming
[1:16:28] because that word can't fail can the
[1:16:30] church say
[1:16:31] amen revelation 3 10
[1:16:35] because thou has kept the word
[1:16:39] of my patience i also will keep thee
[1:16:42] from the hour of temptation which shall
[1:16:44] come upon
[1:16:45] all the world to try them that dwell
[1:16:48] upon the earth
[1:16:49] all right we're not gonna kind of skip
[1:16:51] through that here
[1:16:53] but you see now in the message who is
[1:16:54] this manchester
[1:16:56] but you see in order to stand temptation
[1:17:00] you had to bypass the geophony
[1:17:04] you have to come down here in flesh to
[1:17:06] be tempted by sin
[1:17:08] so i want us to see now on a spiritual
[1:17:10] level now
[1:17:11] that this thing we're talking about is
[1:17:13] not about destroying you
[1:17:15] it's not about weakening you it's not
[1:17:17] about you wondering if you want to make
[1:17:19] it
[1:17:19] but god in his great wisdom allowed it
[1:17:22] to be the case
[1:17:23] that you had to bypassed your to your
[1:17:26] authority
[1:17:27] and have to come down here in flesh to
[1:17:29] be tempted by sin
[1:17:31] and then if you stand is there anybody
[1:17:33] who will stand
[1:17:34] is there anybody who will resist and
[1:17:36] overcome anybody in the house tonight
[1:17:39] he said if you stand all the father had
[1:17:43] given me
[1:17:44] will come to me and i'll raise them up
[1:17:46] at the last days see
[1:17:47] you had to be there first so but obama
[1:17:50] was making that connection
[1:17:52] that because you have representation
[1:17:54] because you come from another place
[1:17:56] because you are an attribute
[1:17:58] of god you will overcome and the
[1:18:01] promises to the overcomers the same way
[1:18:03] he
[1:18:04] overcame his sons will overcome his
[1:18:06] daughters will overcome
[1:18:07] the promise of overcoming is upon you
[1:18:10] maybe
[1:18:11] you didn't overcome as much as you
[1:18:12] should have been doing but tonight you
[1:18:14] are being challenged
[1:18:15] that you are stronger than you realize
[1:18:18] there's more
[1:18:19] in you than you realize the seed germ in
[1:18:21] you
[1:18:22] has overcoming built into its encoding
[1:18:25] and it has been the devil's job to
[1:18:27] distract you from how strong you are for
[1:18:29] you to feel you are just like everybody
[1:18:31] else
[1:18:32] but if tonight you can catch a
[1:18:33] revelation that come what me
[1:18:35] whatever temptation whatever trial we
[1:18:38] are here tonight
[1:18:39] to do surgery on your heart that your
[1:18:41] desires could change
[1:18:42] so that when the temptation comes it
[1:18:44] will find no place in you
[1:18:46] to connect oh somebody help me tonight
[1:18:49] and when they try to come when the
[1:18:51] temptation comes
[1:18:52] trying to find somebody who can identify
[1:18:55] because of their desire in their heart
[1:18:57] you would not be the one
[1:18:59] because your desire is for the things
[1:19:00] above your desire
[1:19:02] is for his will your desire is for his
[1:19:05] purpose your desire
[1:19:06] is for the holy ghost and when the
[1:19:08] desire in your heart is for the holy
[1:19:10] ghost when the holy ghost comes by
[1:19:12] not the temptation but the holy ghost
[1:19:14] comes by there's a connection
[1:19:16] between the desire in your heart for the
[1:19:18] holy ghost and the holy ghost itself
[1:19:20] i want to dwell in your heart and
[1:19:22] because there's a deep call into a deep
[1:19:24] there's got to be a deep to respond
[1:19:26] can the church see amen i want to
[1:19:29] connect this now friends
[1:19:30] that the word that we have heard all
[1:19:32] these years
[1:19:34] has come to us to protect us from the
[1:19:37] office of the enemy because every
[1:19:39] temptation every offer of the enemy
[1:19:41] is the people of us to hell it's to pull
[1:19:43] us away from our promise is to pull us
[1:19:45] from manifestation
[1:19:46] satan thought that he could have pulled
[1:19:48] jesus with fantastic
[1:19:50] offers fantastic he said you can rule
[1:19:52] the world if you worship me
[1:19:54] but jesus the desire in him was not to
[1:19:57] rule the world with satan still having a
[1:19:59] seat
[1:19:59] as the ceo of the planet jesus desire
[1:20:02] was to make a way for sons and daughters
[1:20:05] to take his example and overcome also
[1:20:08] and to replace the seat that satan had
[1:20:11] by taking the same book
[1:20:12] that adam lost and using that book to
[1:20:15] now call names
[1:20:16] and to move things and to bring things
[1:20:18] into existence
[1:20:20] and to speak when the seven thunders
[1:20:21] utter am i speaking to anybody tonight
[1:20:25] is there anybody tonight understanding
[1:20:27] that the temptations
[1:20:28] of the coronavirus the temptations it's
[1:20:31] all distractions
[1:20:32] it's all things to pull us to the news
[1:20:34] the news is the temptation
[1:20:36] the the everything is to distract us
[1:20:38] from our high calling in christ jesus
[1:20:40] i want us to fix our compass tonight
[1:20:43] with compass in our heart
[1:20:44] to the not i want us to look i want just
[1:20:46] to turn northwards
[1:20:48] i want us to align ourselves because
[1:20:50] there's a there's a great
[1:20:51] moving of the spirit and in our heart
[1:20:54] it's not
[1:20:55] lust and desires or evil but he promised
[1:20:58] to change our thinking

[1:21:47] going to overcome god didn't put you
[1:21:50] here to feel

[1:22:01] somewhere
[1:22:02] will be in their wilderness and say i'm
[1:22:04] not going to bow down
[1:22:05] those hebrew boys they were given the
[1:22:07] temptation if you're born you're going
[1:22:09] to live but they resisted that
[1:22:11] because it was not in their heart it was
[1:22:13] not in their heart
[1:22:15] caleb said i gave word as it was in my
[1:22:18] heart what's in your heart tonight oh
[1:22:20] god give us a heart to serve him
[1:22:22] give us a heart of worship give us a
[1:22:24] heart for manifestation amen by the pop
[1:22:26] world
[1:22:27] and watch god do great things for us oh
[1:22:30] i'm trying to find a way to close out
[1:22:31] here
[1:22:32] hebrews 4 12 for the word of god
[1:22:36] is quick and powerful and sharper i love
[1:22:39] it
[1:22:41] this description here puts the word in a
[1:22:43] position that is now
[1:22:44] it it doesn't even leave the world with
[1:22:46] one descriptor it it gives
[1:22:48] multiple descriptions for the word of
[1:22:50] god it's quick
[1:22:52] quick the use of quick deal me it's
[1:22:54] faster than you are the enemy before the
[1:22:56] enemy can reach you the world can
[1:22:57] intercept the situation
[1:22:58] before the enemy can come to your house
[1:23:00] the world can get there
[1:23:01] just on time what time was my servant
[1:23:04] healed what got there
[1:23:05] faster than this that he could get there
[1:23:07] it was the world it's quick
[1:23:09] it's powerful and sharper than any
[1:23:11] two-headed sword
[1:23:12] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:23:15] soul and spirit
[1:23:16] and i have the joint and marrow and as a
[1:23:18] disearner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:23:20] the heart
[1:23:21] listen now neither is there any creature
[1:23:24] that is not manifest in his sight
[1:23:26] talking about the word here and all
[1:23:29] things are naked and open
[1:23:31] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[1:23:33] to do
[1:23:35] seeing then listen now that we have a
[1:23:37] great high priest
[1:23:39] that has passed into the heavens jesus
[1:23:42] the son of god
[1:23:43] let us hold fast our profession this is
[1:23:46] powerful
[1:23:46] for we have not an high priest which
[1:23:50] cannot be touched with the feelings
[1:23:53] of our infirmities do you have an
[1:23:56] infirmity tonight
[1:23:58] do you have a situation tonight do you
[1:24:00] have a problem tonight
[1:24:02] do you have a a challenge tonight the
[1:24:04] feeling
[1:24:05] of these infirmities they have the
[1:24:08] ability to
[1:24:09] touch him but was in all points tempted
[1:24:12] like as we are oh yet without sin
[1:24:16] but brandon said jesus had to deal with
[1:24:18] sexual temptation
[1:24:20] jesus had to deal with every temptation
[1:24:22] but jesus stood
[1:24:24] in the midst of every temptation but
[1:24:26] there was no desire
[1:24:27] in his heart so when the temptation came
[1:24:30] there was nothing to connect
[1:24:31] oh come on now there was another connect
[1:24:33] because he
[1:24:34] was not of that oh he was tempted in
[1:24:37] every manner
[1:24:39] yet without sin let us therefore come
[1:24:42] boldly
[1:24:43] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:24:46] obtain mercy
[1:24:47] and find grace to help in time of need
[1:24:51] also import letter to the hebrews
[1:24:54] he knew the people were struggling he
[1:24:57] knew
[1:24:57] they had the infirmities he knew they
[1:25:00] had their situations
[1:25:01] he knew they had their temptations he
[1:25:03] knew they were worrying
[1:25:04] if they're gonna make it how they're
[1:25:06] gonna make it he knew they stumbled
[1:25:08] he knew they fell but he said this high
[1:25:10] priest
[1:25:11] oh that we could go to he understands
[1:25:14] temptation
[1:25:15] he understands your pain he understands
[1:25:18] what these things are because he himself
[1:25:20] had to go to his test
[1:25:24] and in his own prayer he said lead us
[1:25:26] not into temptation
[1:25:28] but if we are to be led into temptation
[1:25:31] trust me
[1:25:32] he give it grace and he give it more
[1:25:34] grace and he will not give you more than
[1:25:36] you could bear
[1:25:37] you could handle it you could handle it
[1:25:39] you have to know you can handle it
[1:25:41] you have to know young brother young
[1:25:43] sister that you could stand
[1:25:45] in the midst of your job in the midst of
[1:25:48] your neighborhood
[1:25:48] in the midst of your business in the
[1:25:50] midst of your family i don't care who
[1:25:52] walks away and okay who backs life i
[1:25:54] don't care who don't believe
[1:25:55] i don't care what people say do it does
[1:25:58] not matter
[1:25:59] all these are distractions all of these
[1:26:01] are temptations
[1:26:02] to take your eyes away from the cross to
[1:26:04] take your eyes away from the rapture to
[1:26:06] take your eyes away from your
[1:26:08] destination and god but tonight we fix
[1:26:11] our face like flint
[1:26:12] tonight we make our focus clear and our
[1:26:15] heart pure
[1:26:16] and our desires right that we want the
[1:26:18] holy ghost we reject
[1:26:20] every form of destruction to the enemy
[1:26:22] we reject every temptation of the enemy
[1:26:24] let us bow our heads for a word of
[1:26:26] prayer oh well gracious heavenly father
[1:26:29] we thank you tonight that you have
[1:26:33] done lord what we have to go
[1:26:36] through you have done it you have
[1:26:38] experienced it
[1:26:39] you have walked the road and you have
[1:26:41] proven
[1:26:42] to us that you understand you
[1:26:45] know you could empathize you could
[1:26:48] sympathize
[1:26:48] you could not identify with what we're
[1:26:51] going through
[1:26:52] because you have gone through it lord
[1:26:55] you understand that
[1:26:56] this could be so great at times that in
[1:26:58] your own prayer
[1:26:59] you say lead us not into temptation but
[1:27:02] we understand the higher mind of god
[1:27:04] lord that that there are some of us lord
[1:27:07] many of us lord
[1:27:08] oh you have to craft through different
[1:27:10] journeys to ensure that we pass the test
[1:27:13] because there's a promise of power a
[1:27:14] promise of adoption a promise of
[1:27:16] manifestation
[1:27:17] and that power cannot be released unless
[1:27:19] sons and daughters have gone through
[1:27:21] their
[1:27:21] place of trying their place of test
[1:27:23] their proving ground
[1:27:25] when they are given offers situations
[1:27:27] opportunities that they need to say no
[1:27:29] that's not it that's not the word that's
[1:27:32] not what i am
[1:27:32] that's not who i am that's not my name
[1:27:35] lord as as moses said that's not my name
[1:27:38] that's not my identification
[1:27:39] temptations they must come they will
[1:27:42] come we understand this
[1:27:43] but we understand also that you promise
[1:27:45] to change our hearts
[1:27:46] you promise to give us a new heart you
[1:27:48] promise to change our desires so that
[1:27:50] when the temptations come
[1:27:51] they can find no place in us they can
[1:27:54] find no weakness in us they can find no
[1:27:56] vulnerability in us
[1:27:57] because just as sin can grow the word
[1:28:00] seed in us can grow also
[1:28:01] grow all the way from faith to charity
[1:28:04] so father
[1:28:04] may you bless your church may you bless
[1:28:06] your people may you bless the believers
[1:28:08] tonight

[1:28:15] temptations will come
[1:28:17] the temptations there's nothing wrong
