[32:05] heavenly father lord as we

[32:11] short encouragement to the people lord
[32:13] may you bless your word father may your

[32:22] instruct them lord may lives be changed
[32:24] father and encourage lord
[32:26] to move on father for that great victory
[32:29] in the love divine in jesus name we pray
[32:32] and ask your blessing in jesus name
[32:34] amen and amen ephesians 1 verse 4
[32:38] and i've taken my little inspiration for
[32:41] that
[32:43] amen and paul is writing here
[32:46] according as he has chosen us in him
[32:49] before the foundation
[32:51] of the world that we should be holy and
[32:54] without blame
[32:55] before him in love amen it was a command
[32:58] of paul
[32:59] that we should be holy and without blame
[33:02] so if it's a command there's a
[33:03] possibility that we are holy
[33:06] and without claim hallelujah and we
[33:09] cannot be
[33:10] holy from our self there's no
[33:12] possibility for that
[33:14] but he is holy and he comes to live in
[33:17] us
[33:18] hallelujah so we can be holy because he
[33:20] is holy
[33:22] how can i walk blameless lord jesus
[33:25] your blood of calvary glances me from
[33:28] all sin
[33:29] daily daily lord you cleanse me
[33:32] from all mistakes and i walk holy
[33:36] holy holy unto the lord so paul says
[33:40] we should be holy without blame before
[33:42] him in love
[33:43] in love means you have you must fall in
[33:46] love with him
[33:47] there's a relationship hallelujah that
[33:49] you have to fall in love with him and i
[33:52] want to pick it up
[33:53] from brother branham when he went behind
[33:56] the curtain of time
[33:58] i want to listen what he says he says
[34:01] there when he was there he said it's all
[34:04] love
[34:05] everything is real brother everything is
[34:07] real sister
[34:08] there's no death there's no sorrow
[34:11] there's no
[34:11] jealousy no nothing nothing can enter
[34:14] there
[34:15] it's just perfection and how can we
[34:17] enter
[34:18] into this perfect place brother brand
[34:21] name in the message curtain
[34:22] behind the curtain of of time
[34:25] he says i'm more than convinced ever in
[34:28] my life
[34:30] that it will take perfect love to enter
[34:33] that place
[34:35] so it's not we have it when we are going
[34:37] there but he said in a state we will be
[34:39] in a state of
[34:40] perfect love and as i said a
[34:43] relationship with our lord jesus
[34:46] individual
[34:47] a relationship we have fallen in love
[34:50] and it's a perfect love
[34:51] and when we have that perfect
[34:53] relationship we have a perfect love
[34:55] and then we will be there on the other
[34:57] side and that's what it needs otherwise
[35:00] it takes
[35:00] but we are predestinated so we gonna
[35:02] have it amen
[35:03] hallelujah there will be a perfect love
[35:06] in the church
[35:07] there will be a perfect love in the
[35:09] marriages
[35:11] there will be a perfect love in the
[35:13] families
[35:14] before we go over there there will be a
[35:16] perfect love it has to be
[35:18] and it will be there between brothers
[35:21] and sisters
[35:22] a perfect love because brother brahm
[35:24] says it has to be
[35:25] and it will be hallelujah even the
[35:28] person that you hate
[35:30] or that hates you the perfect love will
[35:32] drop down
[35:34] and will open your eyes and see that
[35:36] person
[35:37] with a different eyes that's what he
[35:40] makes
[35:41] who is he who is he
[35:45] brother bran says whatever you do
[35:49] he said lay aside everything else
[35:53] means to die to yourself die to your
[35:55] opinion
[35:56] to you what you what what we think we
[35:58] have perfect conceptions
[36:01] but we lay them aside and say lord jesus
[36:04] i just love you and you love me
[36:07] he comes down and he's pleased
[36:12] he says whatever you do lay aside
[36:14] everything else
[36:16] until you get that perfect love
[36:19] hallelujah that's a way hallelujah
[36:23] so where's the connection where's the
[36:26] connection
[36:27] in that message behind the curtain of
[36:29] time brother branham says
[36:32] then the voice spoke to me
[36:35] and said this is what you preached that
[36:38] the holy ghost is
[36:41] this is that what we are preaching all
[36:43] over this years
[36:44] this is that that perfect love
[36:49] we have called it a holiest ghost but
[36:52] it's perfect love in a manifestation
[36:55] in a way where it's living this is that
[36:59] what you call that is the holy ghost
[37:04] so on the other side when we all meet
[37:07] together
[37:08] on the other side we will call it
[37:10] perfect love
[37:12] on this side we call it the holy ghost
[37:19] in question and answers brother braham
[37:21] says he says the same holy ghost
[37:24] that perfect love i say the same holy
[37:28] ghost
[37:29] that came down on those apostles and
[37:31] back in the ages
[37:33] is still in the church today hallelujah
[37:36] it's still there it's still there it's
[37:39] still working
[37:40] it's still achieving its aim hallelujah
[37:43] it's still working
[37:44] hallelujah praise the lord it's still in
[37:46] trinidad
[37:47] it's still in us it's still in africa
[37:50] it's still in europe
[37:51] that same holy ghost that perfect love
[37:58] that same holy ghost radiating
[38:01] in seven different attributes of his
[38:04] holy
[38:05] of his glory brother branham said it's
[38:07] the same holy ghost
[38:09] radiating out in those seven attributes
[38:13] it's the same holy ghost the same
[38:16] perfect love
[38:18] what does it make it comforts you
[38:22] jesus called him the comforter it will
[38:25] guide you
[38:27] in every situation it will lead you
[38:31] personal because you have fallen into
[38:34] this love
[38:36] with jesus
[38:42] in the message perfect face
[38:45] brother brahm says and when we were
[38:46] sinners
[38:48] alienated without god in the world
[38:52] in the mug of the mud as i was
[38:56] and i said it many years ago i was in a
[38:59] state like that
[39:01] brother abraham continues and then god
[39:04] comes to us
[39:07] how does he come individually
[39:11] he starts speaking to you you die to
[39:14] yourself
[39:15] and you start to receive him with the
[39:19] baptism of the holy ghost
[39:21] you receive him and his love
[39:24] god sought you you never sought god
[39:28] and god came down in the muck
[39:31] what was the woman at the well she was
[39:34] in a mucky place
[39:36] in a mucky condition in a mucky
[39:38] situation
[39:39] but jesus came down to her and the love
[39:42] affair started there
[39:44] and she recognized her savior her
[39:46] redeemer
[39:47] easy that and he was
[39:50] he was that for her amen
[39:54] and brother branham continues he said
[39:57] god came down in that mug and sought you
[40:00] out and brought you out
[40:01] that ought to create a perfect love
[40:04] in us when he comes down it brings
[40:08] perfect love to us it creates literally
[40:12] a perfect love to him hallelujah
[40:15] what look what was and look what you are
[40:18] what did that somebody that loved you
[40:23] somebody who else who is listening
[40:27] somebody loves you final quote
[40:30] in the message super sign brother
[40:33] branham said there's got to come
[40:35] a church again where those barriers will
[40:38] be broken
[40:40] and the holy ghost i say the perfect
[40:42] love the holy ghost
[40:44] have the right of way among the people
[40:46] hallelujah it will have the right of way
[40:49] everything else has to go because the
[40:51] holy ghost
[40:52] will have the right of way the perfect
[40:54] love
[40:55] there's a relationship that cannot be
[40:57] broken
[40:58] hallelujah because god said it so
[41:01] and it will be there hallelujah because
[41:04] nothing
[41:05] with this relationship can separate you
[41:08] from the love of god amen when you do
[41:11] you will see the same signs and the same
[41:14] wonders
[41:15] that happen back there in them days and
[41:18] we see them
[41:19] and we see more of them the same signs
[41:22] and wonders
[41:23] amen the holy ghost will have the right
[41:26] way
[41:27] in our lives no more creeds
[41:31] no more depressions no more sickness no
[41:34] more arguing
[41:36] but the love of god is poured out
[41:39] in every heart in heaven

[50:48] uh daniel chapter 2 we want to read from
[50:51] 17 to 23
[50:53] ephesians chapter 4 from 11 to 13
[50:56] and revelation 10 we want to read from
[50:58] one to four and eight to eleven
[51:00] or praise the lord now the daniel
[51:03] scripture
[51:04] we know that uh king nebuchadnezzar had
[51:07] a dream
[51:08] that troubled him he forgot it he asked
[51:09] the magicians to tell him the dream
[51:12] because he he said the dream was gone
[51:14] from him
[51:15] he was going to kill them he wanted to
[51:16] know the interpretation
[51:19] and daniel got word of it and daniel
[51:22] asked for time
[51:23] i know went and sought the lord to get
[51:26] the interpretation thereof
[51:28] we want to read that from verse 17 then
[51:30] daniel
[51:32] went to his house and made the things
[51:34] known to hanaya mishael and azaria his
[51:37] companions
[51:38] that they should desire mercies of god
[51:40] of heaven concerning the seek this
[51:42] secret
[51:43] that daniel and his fellows should not
[51:45] perish with the rest of the wise men of
[51:47] babylon
[51:49] then was the secret revealed unto daniel
[51:52] in a night vision then daniel blessed
[51:55] the god of heaven
[51:56] daniel answered and said blessed be the
[51:59] name of god forever and ever
[52:01] for wisdom and might are his and he
[52:04] changed the times
[52:05] and the seasons he removed kings
[52:08] and set it up kings he gave it wisdom
[52:11] unto the wise
[52:13] and knowledge to them that no
[52:16] understanding he revealed the deep and
[52:19] secret things
[52:20] he knoweth what is in the darkness and
[52:22] the light dwells with him
[52:24] i thank thee and praise the odd god of
[52:27] my fathers
[52:28] who has given me wisdom and might and
[52:30] has made known unto me
[52:32] now what we desired of thee
[52:35] for thou has now made known unto us
[52:39] the king's matter ephesians 4 verse 11
[52:43] and he gives some apostles and some
[52:45] prophets and some
[52:46] evangelists and some pastors and
[52:48] teachers
[52:49] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[52:52] work of the ministry
[52:54] for the define of the body of christ
[52:56] till we all come in the unity of defeat
[52:59] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[53:01] unto a perfect
[53:03] man unto the measure of the stature of
[53:06] the fullness of christ
[53:07] and from revelation 10 i want to read
[53:10] verse 1 to 4 and then 8 11.
[53:12] reading from verse one i saw another
[53:14] mighty angel come down from heaven clue
[53:16] with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[53:18] head
[53:19] and his face was with his son his feet
[53:21] as pillars of fire
[53:23] and he had in his hand a little book
[53:24] open and he set his right foot upon the
[53:27] sea his left foot on the earth
[53:29] cried with a lord voice and when a lion
[53:30] roared when he had cried seven thunders
[53:33] uttered the voices
[53:35] when the seven thunders had uttered the
[53:36] voices i was about to write
[53:38] i heard a voice from heaven seen unto me
[53:40] seal up those things
[53:42] which is seven thunders uttered and
[53:43] write them not and verse eight and the
[53:45] voice which i heard from heaven speaker
[53:47] to me again
[53:48] and said go and take the little book
[53:50] which is
[53:51] open in the hand of the angel they were
[53:54] standing upon the sea and upon the earth
[53:57] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[53:59] him
[54:00] give me the little book he said unto me
[54:02] take it
[54:03] eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter
[54:07] but it shall be thy mouth sweet as and i
[54:10] took the little book
[54:11] out of the angel's hand and ate it up
[54:14] it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[54:17] soon as eaten it
[54:18] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[54:22] dom was prophesy again before many
[54:24] peoples
[54:25] nation tongues and kings let's bow ahead
[54:28] one more time
[54:28] father god i thank you for the
[54:30] scriptures this morning and i pray you
[54:32] become an interpreter of heart
[54:33] you know the time and the season and the
[54:36] challenges that lays before us
[54:38] but we pray that your revealing spirit
[54:40] and reveal and anointing will come down
[54:42] this morning
[54:43] and unfold your word by revelation and
[54:45] inspiration
[54:46] granted father in jesus name i ask it
[54:49] amen and amen god bless you
[54:51] and uh wherever you are church and be
[54:54] seated but we're grateful to god to be
[54:56] here tonight
[54:57] i have a title today the dispensation
[55:01] of another ephesians and this is our
[55:04] inspiration
[55:05] i have a subject the rebuilding of the
[55:08] church
[55:09] by the ministry of the spirit
[55:13] by and through
[55:16] a five-fold ministry
[55:19] have an inspiration charity
[55:23] the archangel's voice the voice of
[55:26] perfection
[55:28] so the title again is the dispensation
[55:30] of another ephesians
[55:31] the subject the rebuilding of the church
[55:35] by the ministry of the spirit by and
[55:37] through a faithful ministry
[55:40] and an inspiration of charity the
[55:43] archangel's
[55:44] voice oh blessed be the name of the lord
[55:47] so we'll see what the lord will do today
[55:51] william branham's seven seal prophecy
[55:55] was the unsealing of the prophetic
[55:57] vision
[55:59] and that was why
[56:02] john wept because the book was closed
[56:05] and the book was sealed
[56:07] and no man was willing to take the book
[56:09] so he was looking for the book to be
[56:11] unsealed john was
[56:13] is that right so this prophetic vision
[56:17] was to be accomplished by gorson and the
[56:20] prophet
[56:21] to reveal every mystery this is to be
[56:24] accomplished by
[56:25] the seven spirits of god the bible
[56:27] called going through all the earth
[56:30] this vision was to be accomplished
[56:33] by the restoration of the entire holy
[56:36] ghost ministry
[56:37] to the bride of jesus christ because
[56:39] that's the ministry that we lost
[56:41] this holy ghost ministry which will be
[56:44] the dynamics
[56:46] to the mechanics therefore
[56:49] this vision of god had to be restored to
[56:53] the bride
[56:54] isn't that right oh glory to god so this
[56:57] prophetic vision
[56:59] is what open up the word
[57:02] and give us the authority to prophesy
[57:06] according to revelation 10 8 11.
[57:09] now the bible talk about go to the angel
[57:12] take the book eat the book and prophesy
[57:17] so part of this message for the fast
[57:20] 50-plus years
[57:22] was under the spirit of prophecy to give
[57:25] us the testimony
[57:26] of jesus according to revelation 10
[57:29] 8-11 so this seven seal
[57:32] message that was released by the prophet
[57:36] wasn't just the content of doctrinal
[57:39] stuff
[57:40] but it was a vision within the structure
[57:44] of what was presented by god from 1946
[57:48] to 1965 whatever length of time the
[57:51] prophet was here on the earth
[57:52] because god told daniel go thy way the
[57:55] book is sealed
[57:56] till the time of the end so the prophecy
[57:59] was hanging over the book
[58:00] was the unsealing and that unsealing has
[58:03] to be the unsealing of this
[58:05] great prophetic vision because the
[58:07] vision is always for appointed time
[58:09] so we're not here by church as a
[58:11] particular doctrine and teaching
[58:13] but we are here by prophecy and by
[58:15] vision
[58:16] where it's going to be unsealed or
[58:18] unfolded
[58:20] now revelation 10 when john heard the
[58:23] seven thunders
[58:24] god told him don't write it seal it up
[58:27] so you get the next seal again
[58:30] to seal up what them thunders uttered
[58:32] but in the days of the voice
[58:34] hallelujah not when the man is here but
[58:36] the days of the voice
[58:38] not when the flesh of malachi voice here
[58:40] but the days of the voice
[58:42] isn't that right praise god that vision
[58:44] gonna be on books and tapes
[58:47] hallelujah the days of the voice isn't
[58:49] that right so in the days of the voice
[58:51] the revelation will be unfolded and you
[58:54] describe it as
[58:55] who god is how he lives all about him
[58:57] his being
[58:58] his person isn't that right now i want
[59:01] to compare this prophetic vision
[59:03] as a full complete
[59:07] architectural drawing of a building
[59:10] or pyramid it is not yet built
[59:14] but is the complete drawings of what it
[59:17] is to be built
[59:19] it is the revelation of what is to be
[59:23] it is to let the main thing be the main
[59:25] thing
[59:26] it is together's focus because that is
[59:29] what a vision does
[59:30] a vision gets you focused so it's not
[59:34] so a prophetic vision then is like a
[59:36] drawing
[59:37] and that drawing keeps you honed as the
[59:40] division of where you are
[59:42] where you come from where you're going
[59:45] what you want to accomplish
[59:47] and what is your purpose that is a
[59:50] vision
[59:51] and that is what a vision is all about
[59:54] oh praise the name of the lord now
[59:56] without a vision
[59:58] it will just be scattered information
[1:00:00] knowledge
[1:00:01] trying to fit things together but the
[1:00:03] vision is constant
[1:00:05] the vision is fixed the vision is a
[1:00:07] picture
[1:00:08] of the complete program just like god
[1:00:10] had it in the back part of his mind
[1:00:12] it was a vision and he let time that
[1:00:15] kink
[1:00:15] called time and eternity unfolding his
[1:00:18] vision to be a redeemer to be the liver
[1:00:20] but the vision
[1:00:21] is already complete and that is why he
[1:00:24] had
[1:00:24] you he said all that the father had for
[1:00:26] known he had already glorified
[1:00:28] oh pooh phony recall who we call it
[1:00:31] justified who is justified
[1:00:32] he has already glorified because the
[1:00:34] vision in god's thinking
[1:00:36] is complete that's the thoughts of god
[1:00:39] that's the thinking of god
[1:00:40] hallelujah now without a vision
[1:00:44] you have confession i believe this i
[1:00:46] believe that
[1:00:47] i believe that but the vision really
[1:00:50] for the bride of jesus christ is a
[1:00:52] vision of perfection
[1:00:54] oh that's the vision a vision of
[1:00:56] perfection
[1:00:58] and that is where we get ephesians 4
[1:01:00] that god promised
[1:01:02] a genuine faithful ministry for
[1:01:05] the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:01:08] work of the ministry
[1:01:09] for the edifying of the body so that is
[1:01:11] all part of this
[1:01:13] prophetic vision oh praise god till we
[1:01:16] come to the unity of the fate
[1:01:18] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[1:01:20] perfect man unto our measure
[1:01:22] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:01:25] so
[1:01:25] again let's repeat that the prophetic
[1:01:28] vision
[1:01:29] is like a full complete
[1:01:32] approved architectural drawing
[1:01:36] with all the details just waiting
[1:01:39] to be given to fightful ministry
[1:01:41] builders
[1:01:43] hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:01:47] waiting to be given isn't that right so
[1:01:49] he promised
[1:01:50] that the seven thunders under the
[1:01:52] seventh seal would reveal
[1:01:54] all these mysteries abba kaku one says
[1:01:57] write the vision
[1:01:58] then make it plain that he that read it
[1:02:01] may run
[1:02:02] so once the vision comes it has to be
[1:02:05] written
[1:02:06] and if it is written it has to be spoken
[1:02:09] for it to be made plain so that you the
[1:02:12] bride could
[1:02:13] understand the vision let's go again
[1:02:15] write division number one
[1:02:17] make it plain number two that he just
[1:02:19] read it may run
[1:02:20] so the prophet came to write the vision
[1:02:23] because he got the vision
[1:02:24] hallelujah he received the vision and
[1:02:27] the vision was written
[1:02:28] and spoken isn't that right and that
[1:02:30] vision that is written must be spoken
[1:02:32] that it could be made plain that you
[1:02:33] could understand the vision
[1:02:35] oh glory to god and according to what
[1:02:37] the prophet prophesied
[1:02:38] he said we are given the understanding
[1:02:40] by the word
[1:02:42] that we are going to understand it
[1:02:43] because there will come an ephesian age
[1:02:45] to it
[1:02:46] so we didn't prophesy ephesians 8 the
[1:02:48] prophet did
[1:02:49] and ephesians age or dispensation of
[1:02:53] ephesians
[1:02:53] or the time of the ephesians is a hidden
[1:02:56] mystery
[1:02:57] it's a mystery because the bible only
[1:02:59] brings us up to laodicea
[1:03:01] so that means god had to call us out of
[1:03:03] laodicea
[1:03:04] into this mysterious slot holy spirit
[1:03:07] slot
[1:03:08] where ephesians lay oh my
[1:03:12] john oh praise god the vision is for an
[1:03:14] appointed time
[1:03:16] hallelujah vision is always from
[1:03:18] appointed time
[1:03:19] and god came down to abraham he said i
[1:03:22] will return unto thee
[1:03:23] according to the time of life a vision a
[1:03:26] purpose a picture
[1:03:28] of her future of where you are going
[1:03:31] and that keeps you going that's what the
[1:03:33] vision does jesus had a vision
[1:03:35] since john 4 34 jesus said unto them my
[1:03:38] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[1:03:39] me
[1:03:40] and to finish the work so jesus wasn't
[1:03:42] operating at a haphazard
[1:03:44] level he was up operating from by vision
[1:03:46] to finish the work
[1:03:48] that the father gave him luke 2 49 he
[1:03:50] said
[1:03:51] to them how is it that you sought me
[1:03:53] wish he not that i must be
[1:03:55] about my father's business so jesus had
[1:03:57] it clean and clear
[1:03:59] that he was about his father's business
[1:04:01] he had a vision
[1:04:02] he had a purpose and that's why he did
[1:04:04] what he did and the way you do
[1:04:07] will vindicate whether or not you have a
[1:04:10] vision
[1:04:11] the way you do whether you have a plan
[1:04:14] whether you have a purpose because god
[1:04:17] don't book haphazard
[1:04:18] he always have a plan he has a purpose
[1:04:21] isn't that right
[1:04:22] he has a purpose for daniel long in
[1:04:23] babylon i went king
[1:04:25] got the dream he couldn't remember the
[1:04:27] dream it was a terrible dream
[1:04:29] he said tell the dream and tell the
[1:04:31] interpretation his wise man said we
[1:04:33] cannot do that
[1:04:34] but god revealed it to daniel isn't that
[1:04:37] right
[1:04:37] because he's revealed secrets to
[1:04:39] servants the prophets
[1:04:41] so everybody in the message has a word
[1:04:43] an interpretation
[1:04:44] an idea an opinion an ophelian and
[1:04:47] feeling and so on
[1:04:48] but when that vision comes it's
[1:04:50] different when a vision it has knocked
[1:04:52] out every interpretation it has not got
[1:04:54] every idea
[1:04:55] isn't that right praise god so we have
[1:04:57] doctrines and teachings
[1:04:59] and angles and i've seen it so and i've
[1:05:01] seen it so but
[1:05:02] where is that vision and that is what
[1:05:06] the seven thunders brought
[1:05:07] a vision of perfection adoption and the
[1:05:10] coming of the lord isn't that right
[1:05:11] oh blessed be the name of the lord the
[1:05:13] lord himself descend from heaven with a
[1:05:15] shout
[1:05:16] and the prophet identified as shout out
[1:05:18] seven thunders
[1:05:20] just as god named the light day he
[1:05:22] called the shout the seven thunders
[1:05:24] the seven thunders is the shout that is
[1:05:26] the message and from the shout there's
[1:05:28] the next phase of it
[1:05:29] the voice of the archangel oh glory to
[1:05:32] god he said i wish
[1:05:33] i had the voice of the archangel to
[1:05:35] bring it to a place where you could see
[1:05:37] it
[1:05:38] so somewhere along the line this
[1:05:40] archangel's
[1:05:41] voice must come forward to bring
[1:05:44] clarity of the vision that the prophet
[1:05:47] brought could we see amen tonight
[1:05:49] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:05:51] therefore
[1:05:52] jacob grace joy perfection becomes the
[1:05:56] prophetic vision for the bride
[1:05:58] the pentecostal got stuck at jacob grace
[1:06:00] but the bribe will go on to draw the
[1:06:02] perfection
[1:06:03] to receive joseph rainbow quote that
[1:06:05] quote of many colors
[1:06:07] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:06:09] god's burden
[1:06:10] i believe was to get people to
[1:06:14] the voice angel in revelation 10 8 11
[1:06:18] go to the angel if they say go to this
[1:06:20] man if they go to
[1:06:22] this bishop or say go to this this this
[1:06:25] this minister it said go to the angel
[1:06:28] and we find out
[1:06:29] i don't think i'll get time to read it
[1:06:31] the manifestation of the holy ghost is
[1:06:32] that angel
[1:06:33] trying to get the people back to the
[1:06:35] word of god
[1:06:37] so after all these years 50 plus years
[1:06:40] it was prophecy upon prophecy upon
[1:06:42] prophecy
[1:06:43] people didn't understand that they're
[1:06:45] looking for manifestation
[1:06:46] but was the time of the vision
[1:06:48] revelation hallelujah
[1:06:50] of these things being made known so we
[1:06:53] are under the anointing of prophecy
[1:06:54] to prophesy every prophecy that the
[1:06:57] prophet already brought
[1:06:58] so we were prophesying our own revival
[1:07:00] we was prophesying our own adoption
[1:07:02] our own perfection prophecy were
[1:07:05] overcoming all of that was prophecy
[1:07:07] isn't that right prophesy prophecy not a
[1:07:10] new prophecy but the same prophecy
[1:07:12] the spirit the prophet and the bride
[1:07:14] will be saying the same thing
[1:07:15] i wanted to see would already be said in
[1:07:17] the word oh my
[1:07:19] in other words when god told the woman
[1:07:21] that the woman sees our brutal sip and
[1:07:23] head
[1:07:23] he did not say how it is going to be
[1:07:25] unfolded and this is the problem this is
[1:07:27] the challenge people have an
[1:07:28] interpretation
[1:07:29] of how god will manifest and confirm and
[1:07:31] vindicate his promises but you have to
[1:07:33] leave it up to god to reveal
[1:07:35] how it will be unfolded how many of you
[1:07:37] will be here for all these years
[1:07:39] how many of you will be under virtual
[1:07:41] convention with coronavirus hanging all
[1:07:43] along
[1:07:44] how many knew that we'd be coming on to
[1:07:45] this spot where he said
[1:07:47] we are striving to enter into the
[1:07:49] kingdom of god
[1:07:50] before these horrible plagues strike and
[1:07:52] what is written for
[1:07:53] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:07:55] when they would stop cancer
[1:07:57] when they were stop diseases when they
[1:07:58] would stop this and stop that
[1:08:00] they will be doing it because we sons of
[1:08:02] god manifested
[1:08:04] in other words so when god says that the
[1:08:06] woman's he will bruise his sip on head
[1:08:08] he didn't say how it was going to be
[1:08:11] unfolded to isaac
[1:08:12] to jacob to mary all done true amen
[1:08:15] to produce jesus christ so when god
[1:08:17] speaks something
[1:08:19] hallelujah listen he speaks it in his
[1:08:22] completeness
[1:08:23] he speaks it in its fullness he speaks
[1:08:26] it
[1:08:26] but we don't know the channel
[1:08:30] of how it will be fully unfolded
[1:08:33] it comes like you know in part and
[1:08:34] you're prophesying that
[1:08:36] because you cannot know exactly how
[1:08:39] it will unfold so he leave that as a
[1:08:42] mystery
[1:08:43] as how it gonna be unfolded even your
[1:08:46] own life
[1:08:47] as a sinner how you could explain to
[1:08:50] people where you come from
[1:08:52] and god snatch you from hell snatch you
[1:08:54] out to different things and you are
[1:08:56] still alive
[1:08:56] you're still striving and still fighting
[1:08:58] your life itself is a mystery
[1:08:59] you don't even understand a lot of parts
[1:09:01] about your life because it's god
[1:09:04] in you is god sees in you that is
[1:09:07] unfolding itself
[1:09:08] and that is why you struggle true that
[1:09:10] is why you're making it true
[1:09:11] it's not right so therefore so god leave
[1:09:15] it as a mystery
[1:09:16] of how it will be unfolded so there's
[1:09:19] going to be a fifo ministry
[1:09:21] operating by the ministry of the spirit
[1:09:25] after 50 plus years of the ministry of
[1:09:28] the word
[1:09:29] what do you mean brother of it well
[1:09:31] listen what the prophet said here
[1:09:33] and hear him our heavenly father we
[1:09:35] tangly today
[1:09:36] that we have the privilege of standing
[1:09:38] in thy presence
[1:09:40] with the ministry of the word of god
[1:09:42] before us
[1:09:43] and we realize that this great solemn
[1:09:46] obligation
[1:09:47] that has been given unto the sons of men
[1:09:50] to park the gospel to all the creatures
[1:09:52] of the earth
[1:09:53] before the reaching of jesus christ and
[1:09:55] then
[1:09:57] an angel of god he said shall we bow our
[1:09:59] heads just a moment
[1:10:00] our heavenly father we are so thankful
[1:10:02] tonight
[1:10:03] for the opportunity to be alive and to
[1:10:06] be here on earth
[1:10:08] listen at the closing of this world
[1:10:10] history
[1:10:11] to see these great things developing
[1:10:15] the words of god being
[1:10:18] materialized and brought to us
[1:10:21] by the ministry of thy spirit
[1:10:25] so here you talk about the ministry of
[1:10:27] the word and the ministry of the spirit
[1:10:30] and how we love thee for this is such a
[1:10:32] privilege to get to
[1:10:34] minister to the people in this last day
[1:10:37] knowing that soon the sun was set for
[1:10:39] this last time
[1:10:40] and jesus shall come and we will see him
[1:10:43] and come to his feet
[1:10:44] and lay our trophies there for for that
[1:10:47] great time
[1:10:48] i could just call humbly up and lay my
[1:10:50] hands on his blessed feet then turn on
[1:10:52] tears of joy i will walk away
[1:10:54] knowing this all is well so therefore
[1:10:57] praise god the ministry of the spirit
[1:10:59] comes
[1:11:00] to manifest jesus christ which is
[1:11:03] another ephesians the promised land
[1:11:07] praise be to jesus so god has to come
[1:11:09] down in dynamics
[1:11:10] to make manifest or vindicate a
[1:11:14] faithful ministry because ephesians
[1:11:17] is the seventh seal of redemption made
[1:11:19] manifest
[1:11:20] or we could see it this way the seventh
[1:11:22] seal of redemption
[1:11:24] is that ephesians made manifest oh
[1:11:26] praise god so in other words
[1:11:28] when the book is revealed or unfolded or
[1:11:31] manifested
[1:11:32] it produces another ephesians i want to
[1:11:35] say that again
[1:11:36] this word saying again when this book
[1:11:38] people talk about the unfolding
[1:11:40] word and their following this mystery
[1:11:42] and unfolding this and their great
[1:11:43] unfolders right
[1:11:44] but watch in when the book is revealed
[1:11:48] or unfolded or manifested
[1:11:52] it produces another ephesians why
[1:11:55] because god sent malachi for to do what
[1:11:57] to turn our hearts
[1:11:58] back to the fate of the fathers what's
[1:12:00] that another ephesians
[1:12:01] because the ephesians was the gold
[1:12:02] standard ephesians what the church that
[1:12:04] god's looking for
[1:12:05] i am alpha an omega that was a sea
[1:12:08] church in the beginning you have another
[1:12:09] features at the ending
[1:12:10] all the delicacies laudisia wretched
[1:12:12] mind miserable
[1:12:13] blind miserable and poor naked but god
[1:12:16] promised to pull right out of that on
[1:12:18] ephesians bride and i believe that bride
[1:12:20] is around the world
[1:12:21] oh praise the name of the lord and they
[1:12:22] will be pulled out amen by
[1:12:24] the ministry of the spirit even
[1:12:26] perfection
[1:12:27] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:12:29] let's hear what bahrain talked about
[1:12:31] unfolding on the seventh seal he said
[1:12:34] now you know
[1:12:35] when the seventh seeded was silent isn't
[1:12:36] that right he said no
[1:12:38] there's a great secret lane under the
[1:12:40] seal and i couldn't make it out
[1:12:42] i couldn't tell but i know it was them
[1:12:44] seven thunders uttering themselves right
[1:12:46] close together
[1:12:46] banging seven different times and
[1:12:48] they're the part i want to get to and it
[1:12:50] unfolded into something else that i
[1:12:53] seen so the prophet
[1:12:57] the prophet went not just under the
[1:12:59] seventh seal and saw the first fold
[1:13:00] seven thunders but he said the tenders
[1:13:03] unfolded
[1:13:04] into something else that i seen oh bless
[1:13:07] said be the name of the lord
[1:13:09] you mean the thunder's unfolding or
[1:13:11] something else yes
[1:13:12] and he saw it i say he saw you bright
[1:13:15] tonight
[1:13:16] he saw the prophet saw you he saw you
[1:13:18] not as a corinthian church
[1:13:20] not as a galatian church not as a baby
[1:13:22] hebrew church
[1:13:23] oh glory not as a filthy corinthian
[1:13:25] church but he saw you as an ephesian
[1:13:27] church
[1:13:27] that is what he saw i believe that it
[1:13:30] unfolded something else another
[1:13:32] ephesians oh blessed be the name of the
[1:13:34] lord
[1:13:34] he said i look for the interpretation i
[1:13:37] couldn't make it out
[1:13:38] and went into other tongues and i am not
[1:13:41] praise
[1:13:41] god hallelujah it went into unknown
[1:13:44] tongues isn't that right but he saw it
[1:13:45] he saw it now i am not talking about an
[1:13:48] inspiration of ephesians
[1:13:50] i am talking about ephesians itself
[1:13:53] where
[1:13:53] you have to cross jordan because
[1:13:56] ephesians
[1:13:57] parallel the book of joshua and which is
[1:14:00] your inheritance
[1:14:01] the promised land so when the prophet
[1:14:03] talked about ephesians
[1:14:04] parallel the book of joshua then you
[1:14:07] begin to
[1:14:07] understand where jordan fits in where
[1:14:10] debt
[1:14:11] fits in not just debt dying but debt
[1:14:14] to good self that is what like job had
[1:14:17] righteous man but he had stuff that god
[1:14:20] had to deal with
[1:14:21] and the only way god could deal with
[1:14:22] that stuff is to turn up the heat
[1:14:25] and that is where job got purged
[1:14:27] cleansed and he was
[1:14:29] a more righteous man praise god at the
[1:14:31] end of his whole experience
[1:14:33] oh praise god and you notice people stay
[1:14:36] away from that they don't want to talk
[1:14:38] about debt
[1:14:39] a dying to self but our pride and
[1:14:41] ambition
[1:14:42] and so on like that but this is part of
[1:14:44] the process in order
[1:14:46] to be in god's program for ephesians
[1:14:49] isn't that right
[1:14:50] oh bless the beginning of the lord so
[1:14:52] let's continue oh praise god
[1:14:54] in joshua every place you put your foot
[1:14:57] is yours that's ephesians isn't that
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:59] he said because that is the book of
[1:15:00] ephesians of the old testament and then
[1:15:02] brother branham says here
[1:15:03] he said no then paradox now you see what
[1:15:06] coming on to the jordan meant
[1:15:08] we are done here now let's cross over
[1:15:12] let's quit playing let's cross the other
[1:15:15] side now
[1:15:16] cause it all belonged to us it's all
[1:15:19] ours
[1:15:20] them vision has never failed they can't
[1:15:23] fail
[1:15:24] because they come from god i believe it
[1:15:26] all is within me
[1:15:27] we are not the highland that will run
[1:15:29] back into the wilderness
[1:15:31] we we will cross jordan this separation
[1:15:33] and then he broke in here
[1:15:35] god break to us the seals that on the
[1:15:38] back of the book
[1:15:39] so you talk more seven thunders god
[1:15:41] break them thunderstorms
[1:15:42] god break to us the seals that on the
[1:15:45] back of the book
[1:15:47] let us enter into that great place for
[1:15:50] joshua divided the to the people
[1:15:52] the inheritance that god had left for
[1:15:54] them
[1:15:55] so if ministers don't want to touch the
[1:15:56] tenders don't want to preach about the
[1:15:57] thunders
[1:15:58] they want to talk to them about the
[1:15:59] thunders how could they cross over to
[1:16:01] jordan
[1:16:01] impossible so any minister fighting the
[1:16:05] thunders
[1:16:06] fighting the revelation seven thunders
[1:16:07] there's no way they could get the
[1:16:09] ephesians
[1:16:10] because the only way to get to ephesians
[1:16:12] is to cross jordan and across jordan you
[1:16:14] have to see the seals that open in the
[1:16:16] back of the book
[1:16:17] oh blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:16:19] have promised
[1:16:20] this is another quote from paradox we
[1:16:22] are promised this is barbara branham
[1:16:23] emphasizing it
[1:16:24] according to revelation 10.
[1:16:28] according to malachi 4 according to luke
[1:16:31] 17 30 and so forth there's got to come a
[1:16:34] ephesians to this
[1:16:36] there is promise it there must come an
[1:16:39] ephesians that these seven full
[1:16:43] mysteries of the word of god must be
[1:16:45] unfolded
[1:16:46] and it's a loud reason age that takes
[1:16:49] this takes place
[1:16:50] so therefore all these things hidden in
[1:16:53] the message
[1:16:53] the thunders and so on must be wrapped
[1:16:56] up
[1:16:57] to produce an ephesians dispensation
[1:17:01] or a period of time where we see
[1:17:04] ephesians made manifest
[1:17:06] oh my hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:17:09] the lord you love him
[1:17:10] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:17:12] praise be to jesus
[1:17:15] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[1:17:18] name of the lord in ephesians is
[1:17:19] heavenly places
[1:17:20] in ephesians you are chosen in him
[1:17:22] predestination
[1:17:23] adoption in ephesians you are obtaining
[1:17:26] inheritance
[1:17:27] in ephesians you are sealed with the
[1:17:28] holy spirit in ephesians you're no more
[1:17:30] strangers or foreigners
[1:17:32] but fellow citizens with the saints in
[1:17:34] ephesians you find one lord
[1:17:36] one's faith one spirit one hope of your
[1:17:38] calling
[1:17:39] one lord one faith one baptism in
[1:17:42] ephesians you find the apostles the
[1:17:44] prophets the evangelists the pastors the
[1:17:46] teachers
[1:17:46] in ephesians they find the perfecting of
[1:17:48] the saints the unity of the fate
[1:17:50] and ephesians you redeem the time in
[1:17:52] ephesians why you submitted themselves
[1:17:54] to their husbands husbands love their
[1:17:55] wives
[1:17:56] and he feeds on sharing will be their
[1:17:57] parents in ephesians we are strong in
[1:17:59] the lord
[1:18:00] in ephesians we wrestled against flesh
[1:18:02] and blood in ephesians we put on the old
[1:18:03] armor of god
[1:18:04] oh glory to god in heaven done all to
[1:18:06] stand we stand
[1:18:08] that is ephesians that's what it's all
[1:18:10] about oh glory to god
[1:18:11] ephesians in the capstone book oh
[1:18:14] hallelujah what we pressing on to
[1:18:16] gordon sent us forward he sent us back
[1:18:18] us back to pick up ephesians
[1:18:20] that's why he sent our prophets to turn
[1:18:21] our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:18:23] fathers and with the faith of the
[1:18:24] fathers we could go to the rapture oh
[1:18:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:18:27] thank you jesus you love him oh blessed
[1:18:30] be the name of the lord
[1:18:31] in ephesians everybody have a measure
[1:18:33] everybody have grace according to
[1:18:35] the gift of christ isn't that right so
[1:18:37] you can take somebody measure i could
[1:18:39] only minister with my measure all the
[1:18:40] brothers have gone forth
[1:18:41] minister with their measure isn't that
[1:18:43] right nobody branham said there must
[1:18:45] come an ephesians
[1:18:47] that the sevenfold mystery will be
[1:18:49] unfolded
[1:18:50] so all those people that battle and
[1:18:52] fight in the inspiration fighting seven
[1:18:54] thunders they cannot cross over to
[1:18:56] ephesians they might have a good
[1:18:57] galatian church
[1:18:58] amen cover intention but not ephesians
[1:19:00] oh hallelujah praise be to jesus
[1:19:04] thank you lord do you believe that oh my
[1:19:07] so what were people looking for the
[1:19:10] bible talk on the last days men will
[1:19:11] have itching ears
[1:19:12] people have itchiness they want teachers
[1:19:15] to bring things that itch their ears
[1:19:17] not promises you know but information
[1:19:20] information
[1:19:21] and revelation is not the same thing and
[1:19:23] that is why the word
[1:19:24] emphasis is these divinely revealed
[1:19:27] mystery truths
[1:19:28] divinely revealed means it comes from
[1:19:30] heaven not from man
[1:19:31] it didn't come from study it come from
[1:19:33] heaven it's a revelation of god
[1:19:35] because daniel couldn't know the answer
[1:19:37] except god revealed to him and when he
[1:19:38] was revealed to him
[1:19:40] god daniel bless god because he is who
[1:19:42] changed the times
[1:19:44] he is who chains kings he who put up and
[1:19:47] put down
[1:19:48] who does that god does that and if god
[1:19:50] come and declare
[1:19:51] ephesians as a season as a dispensation
[1:19:54] then the holy spirit will come to make
[1:19:55] that manifest
[1:19:56] because man can't declare any season and
[1:19:58] god does that
[1:19:59] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[1:20:01] you believe that
[1:20:02] thank you lord jesus oh blessed be the
[1:20:04] name of the lord
[1:20:06] praise god hallelujah so he said the
[1:20:08] seven thunders were gathered right
[1:20:09] together
[1:20:10] seven thunders were shorter by how to
[1:20:12] prepare
[1:20:13] so if there's a five-fold ministry to
[1:20:16] step forward
[1:20:18] with the ministry of jesus christ it
[1:20:20] means that seven thunders have to
[1:20:21] prepare you to receive that
[1:20:23] and to see that because god can't break
[1:20:26] his word the faithful ministry is for
[1:20:28] the perfecting of the saints
[1:20:29] no man can perfect man so it's not man's
[1:20:32] ministry
[1:20:33] it has to be the ministry of jesus
[1:20:34] christ now god
[1:20:36] issue is not about power you know god
[1:20:38] have power to give
[1:20:39] god issues about character and character
[1:20:41] is not a gift
[1:20:42] listen it have gift of preaching gifts
[1:20:44] of speaking all these are gifts
[1:20:46] but that is not character even a man
[1:20:49] have a gift whether it's evangelical
[1:20:50] gift
[1:20:51] a postulate gift a pro a prophetic gift
[1:20:54] whatever it gives the gift have to be
[1:20:56] purged
[1:20:57] the mindset of they get captured let me
[1:20:59] say that again even if the man have a
[1:21:01] gift of pastor
[1:21:02] gifts of evangelist gift of teacher all
[1:21:05] these
[1:21:06] gifts that god put into men
[1:21:09] he said god don't make halfway preachers
[1:21:11] but preachers can be halfway
[1:21:14] god they make that they are halfway
[1:21:16] because they get their lines crossed up
[1:21:19] and they get their lives messed up so
[1:21:21] what we are called to do now
[1:21:23] are not just called to do but god
[1:21:25] released the trials and the testings and
[1:21:27] keep tearing up the heat
[1:21:29] to see what's in us what's in men
[1:21:32] or let's say they say what's in man god
[1:21:35] know what's in man
[1:21:36] dying by the heat is necessary oh
[1:21:38] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:40] how to prepare so i believe there's a
[1:21:43] dispensation of ephesians
[1:21:45] a season of ephesians a time of
[1:21:48] ephesians
[1:21:49] and daniel said he changed the times
[1:21:52] he said blessed be the name of god
[1:21:54] forever for wisdom and might are his
[1:21:57] he changed at the times and seasons he
[1:21:59] removed kings
[1:22:00] and settled up kings he gave it wisdom
[1:22:03] to the wise he
[1:22:04] changed season and i believe the season
[1:22:06] is being changed right now
[1:22:08] i miss this corner virus i miss this it
[1:22:11] can't travel here and car travel there i
[1:22:12] miss all of that
[1:22:13] a superchurch is about to become fought
[1:22:16] in other words the
[1:22:17] word is about to be born into
[1:22:19] manifestation
[1:22:20] let me see it good the word is about to
[1:22:23] be born into manifestation
[1:22:25] first is prophecy just like if a virgin
[1:22:27] shall conceive prophecy for hundreds of
[1:22:29] years
[1:22:29] but then when mary came the prophecy is
[1:22:32] about to become manifested now
[1:22:34] because the body of that prophecy is on
[1:22:35] the earth and this body is on the earth
[1:22:38] to in effect produce a fightful ministry
[1:22:40] not men trying to
[1:22:42] uh uh point people to themselves
[1:22:45] or the churches of this group but people
[1:22:47] that would point people to jesus christ
[1:22:49] amen so listen to this now the spirit
[1:22:52] quickens the word in other words the
[1:22:55] powder that sends the bullet out here
[1:22:57] like it was a powder when david met
[1:22:59] goliath with a slingshot
[1:23:01] see if he only had one place a hit that
[1:23:03] was right between the eyes
[1:23:05] the rest of it was armored but god got
[1:23:07] into that spirit
[1:23:08] what was it he had five stones and a
[1:23:11] slingshot
[1:23:11] look fait ate fate gesus here he comes
[1:23:15] something fixing to happen he said no
[1:23:17] cause there is the word
[1:23:19] the promise here we go and the power to
[1:23:21] sling it
[1:23:23] so a lot of people emphasize the word
[1:23:25] the promise but it have to have
[1:23:26] the power to sling it right he said what
[1:23:29] with the power of the holy ghost behind
[1:23:31] him to press it out there
[1:23:33] watch it come to pass that's god's army
[1:23:37] his word of fire his army all dressed
[1:23:40] with his ever presence of himself
[1:23:42] hallelujah going with us
[1:23:44] i will go with you i will be in you not
[1:23:46] you that speaker the father that
[1:23:48] dwelleth in you he does the works
[1:23:50] here we go listeners here we go are you
[1:23:52] ready he presents his army
[1:23:55] in the form of five offices first
[1:23:58] apostles
[1:23:59] prophets teachers pastors
[1:24:03] evangelists that's his army
[1:24:06] that's his soldiers that's his commanded
[1:24:09] officers
[1:24:10] all with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:14] oh i thought the baptism of the holy
[1:24:16] ghost is not the real thing
[1:24:18] that's not true all with the baptism
[1:24:22] of the holy ghost i taught the seed in
[1:24:24] his soul
[1:24:25] that's correct but that seed and his
[1:24:27] soul has to get a baptism
[1:24:29] of the spirit it's not just a seed in
[1:24:31] your soul peter had a seed in his soul
[1:24:33] too
[1:24:33] but he had to go in the upper room so
[1:24:35] seed in his soul is very good that's a
[1:24:36] great revelation
[1:24:38] hallelujah but we're talking about this
[1:24:40] baptism
[1:24:41] i'm not talking about the 24 hours i'm
[1:24:43] still being lost i'm not talking about
[1:24:45] that
[1:24:45] i'm talking about you as a bright seed
[1:24:48] receiving the holy ghost
[1:24:50] upon the sea that's inside of you so
[1:24:51] here we go
[1:24:53] he's talking about that's his army
[1:24:56] that's his soldiers
[1:24:57] that's his commanded officers all with
[1:25:00] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:02] waiting oh dear to meet the enemy on any
[1:25:05] grounds he comes on
[1:25:06] to meet the enemy with the word of god
[1:25:09] here we go
[1:25:10] each one backing one another
[1:25:13] up not each one chopping one another up
[1:25:17] that is not fivefold that is not the
[1:25:20] ministry talking about
[1:25:21] each one backing one another up why it's
[1:25:24] an army
[1:25:26] a hallelujah watch with him the chief
[1:25:29] captain
[1:25:30] here not out here in front not up here
[1:25:33] above
[1:25:34] not back behind but in them who
[1:25:38] chief captain who was the boss of the
[1:25:41] book of acts
[1:25:41] the chief captain he was with each one
[1:25:44] of them
[1:25:45] so philippe could go here peter was sent
[1:25:47] here
[1:25:48] paul go dear it was never achieved
[1:25:51] general
[1:25:51] overseer some some white horse rider
[1:25:55] in charge of the bride of the book of
[1:25:57] acts that is foolishness
[1:25:58] it has to be the chief captain not above
[1:26:00] them nothing from them
[1:26:02] not behind them but in them or could we
[1:26:05] give the lord some praises
[1:26:06] that's why he said the pillar of fire
[1:26:08] will dwell in the adopted sons in the
[1:26:10] last days
[1:26:11] hallelujah here we go let's say again
[1:26:13] each one
[1:26:14] back in one another with him the chief
[1:26:16] captain
[1:26:17] not out in front up here above back
[1:26:20] behind but in them
[1:26:21] that's the army vindicating but abram
[1:26:24] was
[1:26:24] vindicating what his resurrection by the
[1:26:28] proof of his works
[1:26:29] oh no they don't want to hear about
[1:26:30] signs and wonders you double standard
[1:26:32] wonders don't work pentecostal but
[1:26:34] this army here will be vindicating his
[1:26:37] resurrection
[1:26:38] how by proof of his works he said jesus
[1:26:40] says in john 14 12
[1:26:42] he is quoted he does believe it on me
[1:26:44] the works that i do
[1:26:45] shall do also what is it it is god
[1:26:48] in the church in these five
[1:26:50] predestinated offices
[1:26:52] backing up every word that he said that
[1:26:54] the holy spirit himself in there
[1:26:56] oh glory to god the spirit of truth he
[1:26:58] shall lead you and guide you into all
[1:27:00] truth
[1:27:00] oh glory to god he shall lead you and
[1:27:02] guide you into ephesians what will do
[1:27:04] that the spirit
[1:27:05] of truth oh my hallelujah the prophet
[1:27:08] says
[1:27:09] um he said john when he came on the
[1:27:12] scene
[1:27:13] to prove that he was that ephesians made
[1:27:15] manifest
[1:27:16] john announced it but jesus was that he
[1:27:19] was the word
[1:27:19] manifested so the word manifested is the
[1:27:22] ephesians made manifest
[1:27:24] oh that's so beautiful tonight oh glory
[1:27:26] to god how else could we have a super
[1:27:28] church

[1:28:32] around

[1:28:37] lightning that will shake this world to
[1:28:39] shame

[1:29:35] petty and foolish
[1:29:36] that you have to go through this one man
[1:29:38] or this one line or connected as one
[1:29:40] person
[1:29:40] it's so nonsensical it doesn't make
[1:29:42] sense there's a big god we serve

[1:31:23] that's what the spirit was sent for to
[1:31:25] guide us are passing through corinthians
[1:31:27] and galatians
[1:31:28] all these churches represent different
[1:31:30] spirits and attitudes and
[1:31:32] limitations and so on and all these
[1:31:34] choices were limited
[1:31:35] galatians and legalism corinthians
[1:31:37] instead of sin and so on hebrews babies
[1:31:38] and so on but the
[1:31:40] ephesian church that was the church that
[1:31:42] was the standard oh my god
[1:31:44] and say he talked about a hallelujah the
[1:31:47] love of god had passed
[1:31:48] knowledge oh harlow the love of god had
[1:31:51] passed it
[1:31:52] knowledge and understanding the love of
[1:31:53] god past all of that all the
[1:31:55] intellectual information
[1:31:56] oh the love of god passed into all of
[1:31:58] that oh my hallelujah
[1:32:00] oh praise be to jesus thank you lord
[1:32:03] oh you love him this morning oh glory to
[1:32:06] god to all them who don't want to fight
[1:32:07] for ministry
[1:32:08] who don't respect man of god i blast
[1:32:10] number six i do that a lot
[1:32:12] because men want to present themselves
[1:32:14] instead of presenting god
[1:32:15] man want to point themselves out to
[1:32:17] themselves and their churches and groups
[1:32:19] there is no man between the prophet and
[1:32:21] the faithful ministry
[1:32:22] i want to say it again there is no man
[1:32:24] between the prophet and the fifa
[1:32:25] ministry
[1:32:26] there is no paul between the prophet and
[1:32:27] the bible ministry there's no other paul
[1:32:29] but a branham represented paul
[1:32:32] hallelujah
[1:32:33] after paul angel messenger a fightful
[1:32:36] ministry
[1:32:36] paul wasn't just fifo ministry paul was
[1:32:39] prophet to the
[1:32:40] age hallelujah he was prophet and
[1:32:42] apostle
[1:32:43] all glory because he was higher than
[1:32:44] faithful that that regular prophet and
[1:32:46] fight for ministry but iran wasn't
[1:32:48] fightful ministry he was above that he
[1:32:50] was behold i said you realize that the
[1:32:51] prophet that's different
[1:32:52] we're not getting mixed up at all so
[1:32:54] there is no man ministry
[1:32:56] in between brother branham
[1:33:00] and the ministry of the bride they are
[1:33:02] men that god has called
[1:33:04] that god put used in tremendous way to
[1:33:06] bring a define
[1:33:07] and make more sense to what brand
[1:33:09] brought
[1:33:10] because it has to have people that take
[1:33:12] this word and make more sense to it
[1:33:14] because that's what the revelation does
[1:33:17] that's what inspiration does
[1:33:18] but it doesn't put these men in some
[1:33:21] prophetic realm is some realm that god
[1:33:23] does not exist
[1:33:24] because to find that realm you have to
[1:33:26] find these scriptures
[1:33:27] and they don't have that in the bible
[1:33:29] all your seeds are sought nothing by the
[1:33:30] angel
[1:33:31] come down from heaven crow with a cloud
[1:33:33] christ himself
[1:33:34] coming right down to the seventh angel
[1:33:37] hallelujah
[1:33:38] not seven inches and a half not seven a
[1:33:41] third
[1:33:41] he come right down to the seven angel
[1:33:44] give him a message
[1:33:45] and he dropped the message on the earth
[1:33:46] in the days of the voice
[1:33:48] and then that afterwards i heard a voice
[1:33:50] again say go to the angel
[1:33:52] who gonna go to the angel and say give
[1:33:54] me the book
[1:33:55] the same book that was unsealed give me
[1:33:57] the book and prophesy again
[1:33:59] oh i feel good this morning to know that
[1:34:02] all these years we have been prophesying
[1:34:04] the word
[1:34:04] not our dreams not our feelings not our
[1:34:07] emotion
[1:34:08] saying what god said if you put it back
[1:34:10] in the scripture in genesis
[1:34:11] what could abraham prophesy is that
[1:34:13] coming sarah you're feeling well this
[1:34:15] morning but isaac's still coming
[1:34:16] doctors say don't come back here is that
[1:34:18] still coming nobody has believed it but
[1:34:20] isaac's still coming
[1:34:21] and what happened isaac came oh glory to
[1:34:24] god what's the challenge of michelangelo
[1:34:26] hallelujah got to know the rock of moses
[1:34:30] he said what's the whole stick to the
[1:34:31] vision does he have his ears and that's
[1:34:33] hard isn't it because you see when
[1:34:35] you're cutting a rock
[1:34:36] that is not a a two minutes job
[1:34:40] that is not a two minutes job that is
[1:34:42] years
[1:34:43] and you have to be able to hold the
[1:34:45] vision fixed for years
[1:34:47] and when you're busting and you're
[1:34:49] cutting and you're honing
[1:34:51] nobody understands what you're doing but
[1:34:53] you're caught in according to pattern
[1:34:56] you're cutting according to vision and
[1:34:59] only the person with the vision could
[1:35:00] truly cut it
[1:35:02] so that is why this prophetic vision has
[1:35:04] to be released to the bride of jesus
[1:35:07] christ and then you know what you have
[1:35:08] to go on to and that is why jesus opened
[1:35:11] the understanding to the scriptures
[1:35:13] one two open the word to them it's two
[1:35:16] things
[1:35:17] bring it together the understanding and
[1:35:18] the word when they see the word
[1:35:20] because you could hear the word and you
[1:35:21] don't have an understanding you have to
[1:35:24] see the word get an understanding to
[1:35:26] know what you're going for
[1:35:27] so when he opened the word to them open
[1:35:30] the understanding to them it was quite
[1:35:31] clear
[1:35:32] what they had to receive in the upper
[1:35:33] room so anybody come and say i'm feeling
[1:35:35] led
[1:35:37] i feel it after six days you're feeling
[1:35:40] it
[1:35:41] nothing happened yet hallelujah what did
[1:35:43] the prophecy say
[1:35:44] somebody said what did the prophecy say
[1:35:46] with stammering lips you had some
[1:35:47] ellipse
[1:35:48] no sit down and shut up sit down and
[1:35:51] shut up you have a manifestation of
[1:35:53] dynamics
[1:35:54] or but you spoil sit down
[1:35:58] and shut up you don't know what you're
[1:36:00] talking about
[1:36:02] it's very simple your power challenge
[1:36:04] corona virus
[1:36:06] back up diseases back up the virus show
[1:36:09] much power
[1:36:10] i have don't give me power of words no
[1:36:12] show me power of god
[1:36:13] because paul shake up a snake hallelujah
[1:36:16] demonstrate the gospel
[1:36:18] demonstrate the power if you can't shut
[1:36:21] up and wait
[1:36:22] because that's what they wait for wait
[1:36:24] for power and high now these brothers
[1:36:25] still said power you know
[1:36:27] yes that temporary power but that
[1:36:29] temporary power make people run like a
[1:36:31] frightened man
[1:36:32] make peter deny christ that was
[1:36:34] temporary power
[1:36:35] what was promised was permanent power so
[1:36:37] we're not even talking about well
[1:36:39] somebody got healed last year or last
[1:36:41] week
[1:36:41] and we pray and something i'm not
[1:36:42] talking about that that is temporary
[1:36:45] power
[1:36:45] where permanent power is dead raising
[1:36:48] hallelujah devils cast out
[1:36:51] on the run you doing other layers upon
[1:36:54] the sick
[1:36:54] super church super race why period speak
[1:36:58] these words
[1:36:58] the holy ghost fell upon them but heard
[1:37:00] the word that's his fightful ministry
[1:37:02] not while they talk come never more talk
[1:37:04] no why people speak the word
[1:37:06] death was filled with the holy ghost oh
[1:37:09] give the lord some praises
[1:37:11] and these people was not easily baptized
[1:37:13] these people was not even in the message
[1:37:14] but they were predestinated seed and
[1:37:17] peter was in the body of christ
[1:37:19] he had the seed of god in him he had the
[1:37:21] germ of god in him
[1:37:23] that he could give out life coming out
[1:37:24] of his mouth oh give the lord
[1:37:27] some praises isn't that something
[1:37:30] that life is coming out of peter mouth
[1:37:32] and if life's a couple of minutes more
[1:37:34] debt could come with a man's motto
[1:37:36] have you ever thought about that that if
[1:37:39] holy ghost's life
[1:37:40] could come out of mind's mouth debt
[1:37:43] false doctrine
[1:37:44] false teaching and whatnot could come
[1:37:46] out of my mouth oh my how much people
[1:37:48] deceive
[1:37:49] now talking about i am the holy ghost i
[1:37:51] am holy spirit and life from new which
[1:37:53] doctrine
[1:37:54] deceived and they convinced they are
[1:37:56] right and they are the only one how much
[1:37:58] groups how much people believe they are
[1:37:59] the only bride
[1:38:01] think about it now god i just saved
[1:38:04] only a certain class of people come on
[1:38:07] now
[1:38:08] that's why you from the one other world
[1:38:10] that's why you deal with the woman
[1:38:11] caught in a very adultery
[1:38:12] you're not picking on choosing look at
[1:38:13] the pharisees that's a good pharisee he
[1:38:15] calls that collector he called this one
[1:38:17] he's showing you
[1:38:18] that he is god he is sovereign he could
[1:38:20] pick up who he wants
[1:38:22] change who he wants transform who he
[1:38:24] wants
[1:38:25] when joe was feeling entitled that he
[1:38:27] shouldn't go to that trial he said god
[1:38:29] look at them wicked people out there why
[1:38:30] don't check them out
[1:38:31] why in the fight with me am i right
[1:38:32] chess man
[1:38:34] but there's a point he felt he was
[1:38:36] righteous and entitled
[1:38:38] not to be tested but the bible said
[1:38:40] every son that
[1:38:42] commander god must be tested oh glory to
[1:38:45] god so if you come into ephesians you're
[1:38:47] coming to cross jordan
[1:38:48] to do what to possess what you know is
[1:38:50] your own because the revelation
[1:38:52] identifies what is your own
[1:38:54] so you're going to possess it you're not
[1:38:55] waiting for some minister or some elder
[1:38:57] or somebody or watching what others
[1:38:58] doing
[1:38:59] no i'm a son of god this is my right
[1:39:01] these signs shall not maybe
[1:39:03] not perhaps follow them that believe it
[1:39:05] didn't say preacher it didn't say pastor
[1:39:07] them that believe i'm a believer these
[1:39:09] sign will follow me
[1:39:10] oh give the lord some praises hallelujah
[1:39:13] hallelujah
[1:39:14] so therefore the revelation of the word
[1:39:16] being open to them
[1:39:18] hallelujah and they understand i mean
[1:39:20] open give them that power to stay in the
[1:39:22] upper room
[1:39:23] not one day not two days until the day
[1:39:25] of pentecost has fully come
[1:39:27] and then all who felt they had more
[1:39:28] revelation than this one and that one
[1:39:30] all that got cancelled
[1:39:31] by the holy ghost because the holy ghost
[1:39:33] will cancel that foolishness
[1:39:35] we can't have that the eye can't become
[1:39:37] people he knows and he knows companies
[1:39:38] already moat
[1:39:39] and he is no everybody is part of the
[1:39:41] body so respects
[1:39:42] to all because those who are part of the
[1:39:45] body isn't that right
[1:39:47] oh thank you jesus so regardless of what
[1:39:50] amen as the bible said he came unto his
[1:39:53] own
[1:39:53] his own receive him not but as many will
[1:39:55] receive him to them give
[1:39:57] he power to become and this is the part
[1:40:00] he said
[1:40:00] make yourself a christian god release
[1:40:02] power a portion a measure
[1:40:04] but it's power to become because the
[1:40:06] goal rarely is to get to charity
[1:40:08] that's where this thriving is at and
[1:40:10] until we come to get dear
[1:40:12] we we short of coming into this thing
[1:40:14] called perfection
[1:40:15] because perfection is connected with the
[1:40:17] love of god
[1:40:18] and you cannot have the love of god if
[1:40:20] you can't really even love your brother
[1:40:22] so the love of god is a big extension of
[1:40:25] brotherly kindness
[1:40:26] in a massive way because the sun has
[1:40:28] just shined the rain has just falled
[1:40:30] it has fallen whoever wanted to get wet
[1:40:32] getting wet with that rain
[1:40:34] and our lives have to become like that
[1:40:36] no bias
[1:40:38] no envy no jealousy and people are going
[1:40:40] to pay for the attitudes and the
[1:40:42] behavior
[1:40:43] that is why we use us to strive oh my
[1:40:46] hallelujah
[1:40:48] so jordan jordan jesus himself he had to
[1:40:51] come to jordan there's something about
[1:40:52] jordan
[1:40:53] elijah crossing jordan across jordan
[1:40:55] jesus coming to the jordan
[1:40:56] and after jordan dynamics hit him it
[1:40:59] wasn't jesus's son
[1:41:01] a.g love man must be over my father's
[1:41:03] business seed and soul
[1:41:04] he's a son of god and he knows who he is
[1:41:06] and so on that doesn't
[1:41:07] exempt him from dynamics that doesn't
[1:41:11] exempt him from being baptized in water
[1:41:13] that same son got baptized that same son
[1:41:17] what fallen obedience and that same son
[1:41:19] got endured power from one eye
[1:41:21] but the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:41:23] striking him the dove descended upon him
[1:41:26] and that dove is what led him into the
[1:41:28] wilderness to overcome the lust of the
[1:41:30] eyes
[1:41:30] lust of the flesh pride of life to prove
[1:41:32] he is worthy now
[1:41:34] to be considered into that sonship of
[1:41:36] adoption now he's qualified you overcome
[1:41:38] the devil privately
[1:41:39] now he publicly he's had to demonstrate
[1:41:41] he belonged another kingdom
[1:41:43] and he's at a shake of the devil's
[1:41:45] kingdom just think about it
[1:41:46] devil don't know who this man is or is
[1:41:49] it written it is written it is also
[1:41:51] written
[1:41:51] and when you're watching him and all of
[1:41:53] a sudden he found the place where it's
[1:41:54] written
[1:41:55] the spirit is upon me he's in his
[1:41:57] ephesians now
[1:41:58] he found this scripture now because he
[1:42:00] is about to be the word made manifest
[1:42:02] the spirit is upon me to do what
[1:42:04] to anoint me to open the blind eye death
[1:42:06] then castle devils
[1:42:08] they never know what no devil saw before
[1:42:10] this was the first time that why they
[1:42:11] said this man doing works no other man
[1:42:13] have done
[1:42:14] so they begin to see a power and what
[1:42:16] jesus was doing
[1:42:17] is shaking hell's kingdom because now
[1:42:20] they're seeing a man
[1:42:22] manifesting a power to cast out the
[1:42:25] operation of satan on the earth
[1:42:27] because satan needs bodies to work with
[1:42:30] he needs to find houses to work with
[1:42:32] and he was hiding in lives that jesus
[1:42:34] began to expose
[1:42:36] and boy that make the devil mad oh
[1:42:39] hallelujah and jesus said the same works
[1:42:41] i do
[1:42:42] shall you do also oh blessed be the name
[1:42:45] of the lord hallelujah
[1:42:47] so jesus said the spirit is upon me what
[1:42:48] are you saying the dynamics is upon me
[1:42:51] for he had anointed me which man could
[1:42:53] see that this morning
[1:42:54] which one can say that today because
[1:42:56] this is what ephesians is all about
[1:42:58] a land possessing not looking over the
[1:43:01] land by binoculars and say that is mines
[1:43:03] that is mine that is mine i claim this
[1:43:05] no this ephesians means you
[1:43:07] actually have it as a literal possession
[1:43:10] the type is in the scriptures they came
[1:43:12] out of egypt
[1:43:13] and they had across jordan to walk on a
[1:43:16] land that they never walked on before
[1:43:18] it was a literal land the land of canaan
[1:43:21] and he called that land the land of
[1:43:23] promise he called that land the land of
[1:43:25] the holy ghost
[1:43:26] and that is what ephesians the land of
[1:43:27] the holy ghost holy ghost possession
[1:43:30] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[1:43:32] you believe that
[1:43:33] thank you jesus blessed be the name of
[1:43:36] the lord
[1:43:37] hallelujah so praise god
[1:43:40] so it will really take an ephesians
[1:43:42] church to really produce
[1:43:44] a manifestation of seven thunders he
[1:43:47] said what we see should make a church
[1:43:50] isn't it a prophecy i don't think i ever
[1:43:52] connected like this before
[1:43:53] he said what we should make a church
[1:43:55] that would make a revival
[1:43:56] what kind of church corinthians
[1:44:00] galatians what we see should make a
[1:44:02] church what kind of church
[1:44:04] an ephesians church hallelujah that will
[1:44:06] make a church
[1:44:07] that will make a revival that people
[1:44:09] will find from everywhere and say the
[1:44:11] seven thunders
[1:44:12] that are not written is being manifested
[1:44:16] hallelujah make a church what kind of
[1:44:19] church
[1:44:20] ephesians church is that church gonna be
[1:44:23] yes sir
[1:44:24] is that prophesied yes it has oh will we
[1:44:26] have it yes we will
[1:44:28] it will be our ephesians church around
[1:44:30] the world
[1:44:31] oh glory to god i'm not talking about a
[1:44:33] physical church in that sense i'm
[1:44:35] talking about a bright body
[1:44:36] that connected with the revelation of
[1:44:37] ephesians hallelujah which is a
[1:44:39] revelation of joseph
[1:44:41] perfection the capstone word not jacob
[1:44:44] grace
[1:44:45] barely making it holding on trust in the
[1:44:48] lord
[1:44:48] and you're trusting god see it through
[1:44:50] not that but a revelation of judy
[1:44:52] perfection
[1:44:53] oh where you have direct access to your
[1:44:55] god hallelujah
[1:44:57] direct access because now you have the
[1:44:59] book
[1:45:00] that adam lost oh i find this is so
[1:45:02] sublime
[1:45:03] that this book that was mysterious this
[1:45:05] book that was lost from adam this book
[1:45:07] that no one was found worthy
[1:45:08] is now in the hands of the bride because
[1:45:10] a prophet stood there as revelation 10 7
[1:45:12] and received from version 10 1 mighty
[1:45:14] angel this open book
[1:45:16] and the first thing about seven thunders
[1:45:17] mrs don't want to preach it seven other
[1:45:19] voices
[1:45:19] is for the bride exclusive bridal
[1:45:21] promise they don't want to touch it
[1:45:23] and yet we see it unfold to something
[1:45:24] else and we see what's unfolding too
[1:45:27] so when i talk about thunders it unfolds
[1:45:29] our ephesians bright or you're stopping
[1:45:30] that
[1:45:31] the manifestation will be the
[1:45:32] interpretation it don't
[1:45:34] warrant any explanation and that's what
[1:45:36] he said it will speak for itself
[1:45:38] when the holy ghost begin to move in
[1:45:39] dynamic power it will speak for itself
[1:45:41] give me a scripture the lord himself
[1:45:44] went everywhere with them
[1:45:45] confirming the word with signs wonders
[1:45:47] oh glory to god now they go in here and
[1:45:49] go in there i'm trying to explain this
[1:45:50] here
[1:45:51] and make a point here you see the point
[1:45:53] no no seen a point the lord himself
[1:45:56] went everywhere with them confirming
[1:45:58] that word
[1:45:59] with science following so there will be
[1:46:01] it will take an ephesians church
[1:46:03] to produce a manifestation of the seven
[1:46:05] thunders it will take ephesians to
[1:46:07] produce
[1:46:08] a seven thunder revival oh blessed be
[1:46:10] the name of the lord
[1:46:12] oh glory to god hallelujah so when you
[1:46:15] see the true fivefold step forward
[1:46:17] then you will see a true bride step
[1:46:19] forward because you talk about bright
[1:46:21] material
[1:46:22] bright material not free thinkers bright
[1:46:24] materials is the material that go going
[1:46:26] to use to culture the bride
[1:46:27] and when though god told the prophet
[1:46:29] pick up and write he says
[1:46:31] that out of us of the true seed of the
[1:46:33] word
[1:46:34] god present christ a beloved bride so
[1:46:36] the bride comes out the church in this
[1:46:38] message
[1:46:38] let me say it again the bride comes out
[1:46:41] of the church in this message
[1:46:43] the church in this message is the shock
[1:46:45] that holds the bride
[1:46:47] the church in this message is the shock
[1:46:49] that holds the bride
[1:46:50] the bride is the rainbow coat they're
[1:46:53] going to step out of this message
[1:46:54] they're going to step out of the books
[1:46:56] and the quotes the bride is not books
[1:46:57] and quotes
[1:46:58] the bride stepping out as the vision of
[1:47:00] god
[1:47:01] oh glory to god hallelujah my god from a
[1:47:04] vision
[1:47:06] to a reality oh glory to god amen
[1:47:09] amen amen amen amen praise god like the
[1:47:12] team of this convention like i see it
[1:47:13] the globe and everything else and
[1:47:15] trinidad a picture of vision
[1:47:17] and to see them bring it into reality
[1:47:20] that is what god going to do what in his
[1:47:22] thinking
[1:47:22] was going to be expressed and when moses
[1:47:25] finished with moses
[1:47:26] when michelangelo finished with that
[1:47:28] statue of moses he it was so perfect
[1:47:30] he strikes they speak it was so real to
[1:47:33] him
[1:47:33] and this is what god do it from a vision
[1:47:36] into a reality
[1:47:37] there's a vision of perfection there's a
[1:47:39] vision of a bride it is clean
[1:47:41] it is clear there is nothing to put on
[1:47:43] it you cannot
[1:47:45] wow you cannot have power over others
[1:47:47] let me say this way
[1:47:48] you cannot be given power over others if
[1:47:50] you don't power over yourself
[1:47:52] and the tests come to show what power
[1:47:54] you have over you
[1:47:58] over your tongue over your reaction
[1:48:01] over your behavior power over yourself
[1:48:03] then god could give you power
[1:48:05] over others and other things so they're
[1:48:07] looking for the truth rightful ministry
[1:48:09] that's why we preach there's a 500 yet i
[1:48:11] know people run on cities 500. yes
[1:48:13] that's fine
[1:48:14] they have their mouth they're free to do
[1:48:15] that but i know that when god places
[1:48:18] fifo ministers
[1:48:19] they're going to be identified and god
[1:48:21] not fr is not
[1:48:22] afraid or bashful to identify his sons
[1:48:24] he said he will let it be made known
[1:48:26] among men
[1:48:27] so even trying to walk humble god shall
[1:48:29] come here
[1:48:30] because job was go good you know and and
[1:48:33] and god stopped satan walking two and
[1:48:34] four said come come come come come you
[1:48:36] see this man
[1:48:37] do you see this man that is my man on
[1:48:39] the earth i want to check him out
[1:48:41] so god is in the business of
[1:48:43] identification we identify with his
[1:48:45] message all these years
[1:48:46] but the hour has come when the message
[1:48:48] itself have to be identified with us
[1:48:50] and when he does that that changes
[1:48:52] everything
[1:48:54] oh glory to god peter is one man before
[1:48:56] the upper room
[1:48:57] a different man after the upper room oh
[1:49:00] glory to god amen
[1:49:01] you will be a changed man when dynamics
[1:49:03] take a whole of you or life
[1:49:05] and the minister is going to be changed
[1:49:07] when the spirit the ministry of spirit
[1:49:09] take a whole upon
[1:49:10] dear life oh blessed be the name of the
[1:49:12] lord thank you jesus
[1:49:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:49:18] hallelujah
[1:49:19] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so
[1:49:22] listen
[1:49:23] the lord himself decided to shout isn't
[1:49:26] that right the word
[1:49:27] and jesus come down to redeem us by
[1:49:29] blood first
[1:49:30] redeem us by the word and then redeem by
[1:49:32] power which is
[1:49:33] the spirit so when when they put the
[1:49:37] blood over their doorposts they were
[1:49:38] redeemed
[1:49:39] they were under the blood that they
[1:49:41] couldn't calm down and touch them
[1:49:42] but then to the red sea power come down
[1:49:44] and god delivered them from the hands of
[1:49:46] pharaoh
[1:49:47] and the same way power have to come down
[1:49:48] to deliver us from this mortality
[1:49:51] from this fresh body isn't that right we
[1:49:54] are redeemed we are justified you die
[1:49:56] you go to heaven you die you're saved
[1:49:58] but there's a redemption to with the
[1:50:00] redemption of all bodies
[1:50:01] so they thought it has to have a true
[1:50:03] genuine body change
[1:50:05] and that change comes from inside out
[1:50:06] not outside in the rapture have to be on
[1:50:08] the inside
[1:50:09] give me a scripture a word enoch
[1:50:11] mechanic became dynamic and god took him
[1:50:14] the mechanics was in him but something
[1:50:16] changed on the inside
[1:50:18] hallelujah and that body on the outside
[1:50:20] changed oh glory to god enoch was
[1:50:23] transformed isn't that right oh blessed
[1:50:25] be the name of the lord so god
[1:50:27] has to come down among us the shout and
[1:50:30] jesus does all three to shout the voice
[1:50:31] on the trump
[1:50:32] and that voice of the archangel i
[1:50:35] believe in all my heart is charity
[1:50:37] that's the love of god that's not man
[1:50:38] that's christ himself
[1:50:40] love god come that's that's that's deep
[1:50:42] affection
[1:50:43] that that is what could go after sinners
[1:50:45] in the truest sense
[1:50:46] that is christ reproduced on the earth
[1:50:48] that's what you're not seeing some
[1:50:49] people get saved and they get legalistic
[1:50:51] and so on but you're not seeing that
[1:50:52] power of love
[1:50:53] oh glory to god and this is what you
[1:50:55] need to see that's what the world needs
[1:50:56] to see who could
[1:50:57] who could who could change a drunkard
[1:51:00] who could change a prostitute who could
[1:51:01] change all these sinners wicked people
[1:51:03] who could change their hearts
[1:51:04] and the love of god could do that oh
[1:51:07] hallelujah what is going to be
[1:51:09] a paradox incredible were true amidst
[1:51:12] this gross darkness cover the earth
[1:51:14] not just part of the earth the whole
[1:51:15] earth gross taxes cover the people
[1:51:17] god said rise and shine for that light
[1:51:19] has come what light light in the world
[1:51:21] to show you there's going to be another
[1:51:23] ephesians
[1:51:24] oh glory i don't care what the condition
[1:51:26] you're wiping husbanding
[1:51:28] there's going to be a transformation for
[1:51:29] them to step into ephesians
[1:51:31] in ephesians husband truly love their
[1:51:32] wives that's ephesians manifestation
[1:51:35] another pastor trying to say something
[1:51:37] or hints something no wife subject
[1:51:39] yourself to the husband
[1:51:40] that's in ephesians children obey their
[1:51:42] parents in ephesians they find out
[1:51:43] wrestling against some flesh and blood
[1:51:45] so you stop fighting brother and
[1:51:46] brethren and this one don't like you and
[1:51:47] i wanna you stop seeing that
[1:51:49] and you're seeing the spirit at work
[1:51:51] whether his uncle aunt husband wife is a
[1:51:53] spirit at work
[1:51:54] trying to disrupt your anointing oh
[1:51:56] glory to god spiritual warfare
[1:51:59] right inside your house right inside
[1:52:00] your home right on the job right around
[1:52:02] your neighborhood
[1:52:03] spiritual warfare going on let me see if
[1:52:05] we could wrap up here oh blessed be the
[1:52:06] name of the lord
[1:52:07] from zechariah 4 angel came talking with
[1:52:10] me
[1:52:11] wake me up to sleep say what see us
[1:52:12] though i look to behold a cancer full of
[1:52:14] gold
[1:52:15] with a bowl on the top of it there are
[1:52:16] oven seven lamps there of two olive
[1:52:18] trees by it
[1:52:19] and i answered and speaking to the angel
[1:52:21] that walk with me saying what are these
[1:52:22] my lord
[1:52:23] then the angel walking me answered and
[1:52:25] said no it's not what these things be i
[1:52:27] said no my lord
[1:52:28] then he answered and speaking of me
[1:52:29] saying this is the word of the lord and
[1:52:30] this is a ruba bell
[1:52:31] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:52:34] my spirit see of the lord of hosts
[1:52:36] who at the whole great mountain before
[1:52:38] the ruba bell though shall become a
[1:52:40] plane
[1:52:41] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:52:42] thereof with shouting's crying grace
[1:52:44] grace unto
[1:52:45] it oh my and the message of grace but
[1:52:48] abram said this
[1:52:49] i want you to put on your spiritual
[1:52:50] thinking jackets now this great prince
[1:52:53] had determined to rebuild the house of
[1:52:54] the lord or when he did
[1:52:56] he laid the foundation stone as we read
[1:52:58] further we find out that god says the
[1:53:00] rumor
[1:53:00] had laid the foundation with his hands
[1:53:02] he also shall bring forth the heads to
[1:53:03] headstone
[1:53:04] i want you to notice he never said he
[1:53:06] shall bring forth the cornerstone
[1:53:07] he shall bring for the headstone and we
[1:53:09] know that scripture says
[1:53:11] that jesus is this chief cornerstone he
[1:53:14] also is ahead so now
[1:53:16] and this is where you see
[1:53:19] this is where you need to
[1:53:22] say what the prophets say to get a
[1:53:24] revelation of god's mind and god stored
[1:53:27] this is what you can't explain away so
[1:53:29] he's interpreting this now
[1:53:31] he said no if we will think for a few
[1:53:35] minutes
[1:53:36] the seventh a church is messenger was to
[1:53:40] restore
[1:53:41] the fate of the children back to the
[1:53:43] fathers
[1:53:44] and we know that the seven thousand is
[1:53:47] to do that right
[1:53:48] these definitely right watch he said
[1:53:52] because he said he'll do two things turn
[1:53:54] the house of the turin to the fate of
[1:53:55] the founders and read the thunders
[1:53:56] and his deeds do you finally reveal
[1:53:58] mystic truths is what will literally
[1:54:00] turn the hearts of the children
[1:54:02] back to the fathers but listen how the
[1:54:04] prophet now
[1:54:05] put his magnifying glass over that
[1:54:07] scripture
[1:54:08] i begin to interpret it the seventh
[1:54:10] church's messenger
[1:54:12] was to restore the faith of the children
[1:54:15] back to the fathers
[1:54:16] in other words rebuild the church under
[1:54:18] the power of the spirit
[1:54:20] well you mean the seven thunders
[1:54:24] is to bring on the dynamics to rebuild
[1:54:26] the church
[1:54:28] under the power of the spirit so god
[1:54:30] must release
[1:54:31] dynamics to a fightful ministry
[1:54:34] to make them the rebuilders to bring on
[1:54:37] that perfection
[1:54:38] by charity the voice of the archangel oh
[1:54:41] glory to god because that is what peter
[1:54:43] had
[1:54:44] he said you didn't like our man you lied
[1:54:46] to the holy ghost
[1:54:47] he had charity inside of him he had god
[1:54:51] veiled inside of him so he's interpreted
[1:54:53] he is not
[1:54:54] leaning on seven thunder's these
[1:54:56] defining messages no
[1:54:57] he's bringing a further revelation here
[1:54:59] now watch
[1:55:01] the seven churches messenger was to
[1:55:03] restore
[1:55:04] the faith of the children back to the
[1:55:06] fathers in other words
[1:55:08] rebuild the church under the power of
[1:55:11] the spirit
[1:55:12] what have we been all of over 50 years
[1:55:14] the power of the word
[1:55:15] of course we have the spirit and
[1:55:16] atmosphere but he's not talking about
[1:55:18] that yet
[1:55:19] because to be under the spirit power is
[1:55:21] to be on the spirit manifestation
[1:55:23] and if you're under the power of the
[1:55:24] word you're on the prophecy
[1:55:26] because you have to wait in prophecy
[1:55:28] until the time of fulfillment
[1:55:30] let me say it again you have to wait you
[1:55:32] don't need to prophesy if the time is
[1:55:33] now
[1:55:34] don't must prophesy because the time is
[1:55:36] yet
[1:55:38] you have to wait and you're waiting on
[1:55:40] the prophecy you shall be filled you
[1:55:41] shall be healed
[1:55:42] you shall be delivered because the
[1:55:43] vision is for an appointed
[1:55:46] time dorytary wait for it it shall come
[1:55:50] whole glory to god so watch we build the
[1:55:54] church again
[1:55:55] under the holy spirit and then he quote
[1:55:57] zechariah not by power
[1:55:59] not by might but by my spirit then he
[1:56:03] go deeper not by organization in this
[1:56:05] message
[1:56:06] not by denomination not by charlie one
[1:56:09] man show and who is the man of the hour
[1:56:11] not by that not by who are the lead
[1:56:14] who the lead lead church and lead
[1:56:16] inspiration
[1:56:17] lead minister lead revelation not that
[1:56:19] he said
[1:56:20] but by my holy spirit god will bring for
[1:56:23] the church in the last day
[1:56:25] so not to by all this teaching and talk
[1:56:27] and i'm almost
[1:56:28] up musician can't please watch
[1:56:32] from recognizing this message is i'm
[1:56:34] going to say something
[1:56:36] national force put israel in the
[1:56:38] homeland
[1:56:39] national force will put the church in
[1:56:42] the world kongs of churches
[1:56:44] but the power of god will put the people
[1:56:47] in the bride friends we are here
[1:56:51] i believe we are here in a time of
[1:56:54] ephesians
[1:56:55] but it's a paradox in this stressful
[1:56:58] condition
[1:56:59] where are we on the lockdown where we
[1:57:02] have no audience
[1:57:03] where we have to speak and we don't know
[1:57:05] who we're speaking to
[1:57:07] i miss all of that we could take the
[1:57:09] word and say
[1:57:11] a dispensation of another ephesians
[1:57:14] because we serve a god that cannot lie
[1:57:17] a goder will keep his word a quarter
[1:57:20] will confirm his word
[1:57:22] and bride of jesus christ there's a
[1:57:24] faithful ministry
[1:57:25] that god have raised up just for you
[1:57:28] it's for the perfecting of the saints
[1:57:30] for the work of the ministry which
[1:57:32] ministry the ministry of jesus christ
[1:57:35] so this is not man's ministry that's
[1:57:36] going to be here is going to be god's
[1:57:38] ministry
[1:57:39] so i appreciate the lord and appreciate
[1:57:42] these men that has come forth
[1:57:43] to give witness of jesus christ o
[1:57:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:57:49] hallelujah may the lord bless you
[1:57:51] and write where you are may the holy
[1:57:53] spirit sweep down in a special way and

[1:58:06] soul
[1:58:07] and see what a privileged people you are
[1:58:11] to receive this entire message and to
[1:58:13] get a real revelation of this message
[1:58:16] it's not from man it's not of man
[1:58:19] is of god hallelujah
[1:58:23] oh holy spirit
