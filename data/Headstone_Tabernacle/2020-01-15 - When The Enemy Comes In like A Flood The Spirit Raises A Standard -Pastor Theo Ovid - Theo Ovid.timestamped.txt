[13:57] sooo shall they fear the name of the

[14:02] the rising of the Sun when the enemy
[14:04] shall come in like a flood the Spirit of
[14:07] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[14:10] against him and reading from Acts
[14:14] chapter 4 who is 23 I'm being let go
[14:17] this is after the believers fathers were
[14:22] beaten Peter and all of them and being
[14:24] let go they went to the old company and
[14:27] reported all that the chief priests and
[14:28] the elders had said unto them and when
[14:31] they heard that they lifted up their
[14:33] voice to God with one Accord and said
[14:35] Lord no but God which hath made heaven
[14:38] and earth and the sea and all that is
[14:40] that them is who by the mouth of thy
[14:42] servant David I said why did the heathen
[14:44] rage and the people imagine a vain thing
[14:46] the kings of the earth stood up and the
[14:49] rulers were gathered together against
[14:50] the Lord against his Christ for the
[14:52] truth against thy Holy Child Jesus whom
[14:55] dollars and anointed would Herod and
[14:57] Pontius Pilate but the Gentiles and the
[15:00] people of Israel were gathered together
[15:02] for to do whatsoever I hand and I
[15:04] constantly termined before to be done
[15:06] and now Lord behold at Rickman's grant
[15:10] unto thy servants that with all boldness
[15:13] they may speak thy word by stretching
[15:16] forth thine hand to heal and that signs
[15:19] and wonders may be done by the name of
[15:23] thy Holy Child Jesus and when they had
[15:26] prayed the place was shaken where they
[15:29] were assembled together and they were
[15:31] all filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[15:34] speak the Word of God with boldness all
[15:37] a scripture is from Ephesians chapter 6

[15:44] power of his might and put on the whole
[15:46] armour of God that you may able to stand
[15:49] against the wiles of the devil
[15:50] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[15:52] blood but against principalities against
[15:54] powers
[15:55] against rulers of the darkness of this
[15:59] world against spiritual wickedness in
[16:01] high places where four take unto you the
[16:04] whole armour of God that you may be able
[16:07] to withstand in the evil day having done
[16:10] all to stand stand therefore having your
[16:12] loins gird about with truth having on
[16:14] the bread which is the word of God

[16:57] returned to their own company and told
[17:01] all were the chief priests and elders
[17:02] had said to them and when they heard it
[17:03] they lift up their voices together with
[17:04] one United mind to God said o Sovereign

[17:20] Gentiles become wanton and insolent why
[17:23] did they reach and the people imagine
[17:25] and study a plan vain fruitless thing
[17:28] that will not succeed the king of the
[17:30] earth took their stunning array for
[17:32] attack and the rulers were assembled and
[17:34] combined together against the Lord
[17:35] against his anointed christ a messiah
[17:38] for in this city they actually met and
[17:41] plotted together against your holy child
[17:43] and servant jesus whom you consecrated
[17:45] by anointed both Herod and Pontius
[17:47] Pilate with the Gentiles and the people
[17:50] of Israel to carry out all that your

[18:13] of your holy child and servant Jesus and
[18:15] when they are pray the place in which
[18:17] there was symbol were shaken and they
[18:20] were filled with the Holy Spirit and

[19:22] doesn't deal with the church as an
[19:24] organization
[19:28] God deals with the church as individuals
[19:33] each individual in the church so we
[19:37] can't put the church as this is
[19:38] something and this is it or whatever it

[26:54] and the only way to see him visible is
[26:57] to see his works I'm not hearing you to

[35:03] inside so that is why Jesus was sent
[35:09] after you see the fullness of the Holy
[35:10] Ghost into the wilderness for Jesus to
[35:12] deal with the devil by the word that he
[35:15] could return in the power of the Spirit
[35:16] because once I could get you with the
[35:18] word you could have to come back in the
[35:19] spirit or glory of God no he had the
[35:22] spirit you know but God pull it off in
[35:25] the be contested with the word or when
[35:29] he finished the test in the wilderness
[35:30] the Spirit come back upon him the
[35:32] badness had returned in the power of the
[35:34] Spirit I want to emphasize that power of
[35:36] the Spirit power of the Spirit Holy

[36:05] your neighborhood glowberries a standard
[36:08] in your life you've got to believe that
[36:10] you have got to expect that Oh glory to
[36:13] God hallelujah when Jesus overcame he
[36:16] sat down until as any becoming
[36:17] footstools stretching them to be bowing
[36:21] on the
[36:21] Oh hallelujah so we he said until Christ
[36:26] become visible among us and raises the
[36:29] dead and we go into the rapture three
[36:32] things they Christ become visible
[36:33] because we care is no dead that fight
[36:36] that reason he that is voice of the
[36:38] Archangel thing and she is to all three
[36:40] he does the shout he does the voice he
[36:43] does the Trump Jesus does all tree so
[36:46] that shout voice that falls have to come
[36:48] into the bride so it's Christ in the
[36:51] bride to raise the dead we carry is no
[36:53] dead that's the voice of that engine
[36:54] ministry that's the Ministry of Jesus
[36:56] Christ

[39:17] tribulation Saints by the thousands all
[39:20] over the world no one the rapture could
[39:22] be a few people because it has to be

[40:36] want that I want the word the prophet
[40:38] come to reveal the Bible he has come to
[40:41] bring something outside the Bible he
[40:42] come to reveal what the Bible have but
[40:44] we could go back to by the father's head
[40:46] that's why our heart to be compact
[40:48] enough for the father's Oh glory to God
[40:53] our klutzy they were rugged they were
[40:55] really gutsy man oh my
[40:59] that's right for the rest of the Dead
[41:01] lived not for the space of a thousand
[41:03] years just the Holy Spirit filled people
[41:06] went into the rapture not the people in
[41:09] this church or that church or somebody
[41:12] believes a man or some bishop or some sh
[41:15] Pope no only the Holy Ghost filled the
[41:23] rest is tribulation Saints or we could
[41:30] change it and say only the wise virgins
[41:34] the US has nice foolish virgins precious
[41:38] brother virgin but foolish sister virgin
[41:41] foolish the wise want extra
[41:48] extra oil not extra information exile
[41:54] extra power extra annoying them let's
[41:58] just spirit or glow when they begin to
[42:01] pray and ask for didn't ask for more
[42:03] wood they didn't ask for more mysteries
[42:05] they say our Lord stretch forth your
[42:07] hand bring down some power that we could
[42:11] have clarity and boldness to preach this
[42:15] message fearlessly
[42:16] and while they were praying or glory to
[42:19] God not by they were gossiping not
[42:22] wildly with fellowship in wire they were
[42:24] praying all of a sudden look glory power
[42:28] Oh glory my god I feel old fashioned
[42:31] tonight my god I feeling for this thing
[42:34] tonight this is what this promise man
[42:36] you have to look for we have to preach
[42:39] it for you to expect it if we don't
[42:41] preach it how you expect it if we don't
[42:43] say it holy we'll look for it or glory
[42:46] to God hallelujah praise God I am
[42:49] pointing you to what your eye is
[42:50] promised for you this is your portion Oh
[42:54] hallelujah glory to God the spirit alone
[42:58] could bring revelation that this will be
[43:01] your portion Oh hallelujah praise God
[43:05] hallelujah hallelujah could I continue
[43:10] okay listen to this this is happen
[43:13] before Pentecost he gives them power
[43:14] against unclean spirits
[43:18] so d deciphers our power wasn't internal
[43:22] power wasn't resident power it was
[43:26] temporary power Shoto temporary so Gorka
[43:31] give temporary power who preaching that
[43:39] doesn't sound so nice it because it is
[43:44] exposing a temporary preachers right aha
[43:47] temporary five full
[43:51] what was promised was permanent power or
[43:57] resident power or artesian well power
[44:03] which is the power from within jesus
[44:07] said this with he that believeth on me
[44:08] as the scripture has said out of his
[44:11] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[44:13] this the heat of the Holy Ghost which
[44:16] they have not yet received come on open
[44:19] up to these descriptors this is the
[44:21] scriptures this is the Word of God so
[44:23] yet they were preaching yeah the kingdom
[44:25] is at hand casting out Devils they had
[44:27] temporary power but that is what was the
[44:29] promised because once that column you
[44:32] offer them the backslidden dinner
[44:36] condition the in frustration they in
[44:39] tears the under pressure because the POW
[44:41] is not yet with him they have the
[44:43] potential but has not yet with him Oh
[44:45] glory to God I will not leave you
[44:47] comfortless I will come to you
[44:49] that's a while we'll see at me no more
[44:51] but you want to see me he's not talking
[44:53] about physical don't want to give the
[44:54] Lord a shout
[44:55] he said I'm home for that is with you
[44:57] but shall be in you but I can be in you
[44:59] like this it has to be converted he say
[45:05] if I don't go I just come with that
[45:07] can't come
[45:07] so don't like to hold me here I've got
[45:09] to go
[45:16] so Jesus himself was pointing them to a
[45:22] dead end he was pointing them to the end
[45:25] of self because Moses came to admit him
[45:28] and Joshua crossover Jesus came to a
[45:32] dead end and the holy ghost took them
[45:36] over see you have to come to a dead end
[45:39] because this is not the Tree of
[45:41] Knowledge where you try to
[45:42] intellectualize and figure out
[45:43] everything and explain him everything it
[45:46] has to be the portion known with the
[45:48] Tree of Life that crosses you into the
[45:50] spirit and as many led by the Spirit of
[45:53] God they are the sons of God this is not
[45:56] a letter message this is on the bosom of
[45:59] the Spirit of God the fullness of the
[46:01] Holy Ghost visited the church to reveal
[46:04] all seven seals and the seven seasons of
[46:07] bring back the Holy Ghost itself back
[46:09] among God's people all everybody know
[46:12] God was with William Branham and God
[46:14] usually and random but the Bible said he
[46:16] Shelton has a visitor he had a job he
[46:19] did it he actually restored a fate what
[46:23] has to happen all that faith as we
[46:25] activated in the bride to confirm the
[46:27] restoration of the faith we're not
[46:29] trying to restore it alone
[46:31] the faith has been restored it has been
[46:33] confirmed by a prophet so now we have to
[46:36] get that same confirmation or blow it up
[46:39] God in other words we identified with a
[46:41] message but the others come where the
[46:43] message have to be identified with us
[46:46] that's two different things
[46:52] that's will be fun things I love the
[46:54] profit I love the message I love the
[46:56] word I believe the word all that is you
[46:57] love that and you believe that and you
[46:59] see and that and you unfold that and
[47:01] you're everything like that that's good
[47:02] but when God said this is my beloved son
[47:05] that's a different talk all together
[47:07] that no message talk that no book talk
[47:09] that is the father or glory to God the
[47:13] father's approval the call sons and
[47:16] daughters aside if you see that you
[47:18] could run tonight if you see that you
[47:20] could pray tonight if you see that
[47:22] nobody could stop you from reaching out
[47:24] in the spirit or glory they've got to
[47:27] pull down your portion or glory to God
[47:30] no pastor no Bishop nobody to keep you
[47:32] and hinder you from getting what God
[47:34] promised you because just for represent
[47:37] the Holy Ghost and just raced across the
[47:39] people over into the promised land and
[47:41] God told Joshua every place you put your
[47:44] foot is yours if we don't put our foot
[47:47] and signs and wonders we will not get
[47:48] Sinai wonders if we don't put the foot
[47:50] on the power board we will not get the
[47:52] power of God
[47:53] we have got to put our feet on every
[47:55] promise I want to see every gift back in
[48:00] the church they give for peace wisdom
[48:02] the giver of speaking in tongues they
[48:04] give interpretation of punks because my
[48:05] faith they give up stealing the gift of
[48:07] knowledge
[48:08] every gift different faith got to be
[48:11] back in the church nine gifts
[48:14] [Applause]
[48:15] leave apprecia telecom maybe she said
[48:25] she just say feel good who need give
[48:27] defy formulas she has gifts alone top
[48:29] nine gets at the people
[48:30] Oh hallelujah one difficult all upon you
[48:33] tonight if a decent man could fall upon
[48:36] you differ fate could fall upon you gif
[48:39] of tongues could fall upon you gif of
[48:40] prophecy could fall upon you Oh glory to

[59:19] that is so II that is God's own life or
[59:22] glory to God all my dear friends around
[59:25] this country in the Sin City event only
[59:27] my human voice please into your heart
[59:29] the importance of receiving the baptism
[59:31] of illegal
[59:38] and yet that prophets say you can have
[59:40] the bathroom illegal instead be lost but
[59:43] what is the context of that because you
[59:47] can be baptized in your spirit and not
[59:50] baptized in your soul so the context of
[59:53] that is where you get that baptism so
[59:57] Peter and them didn't say I have
[59:58] received in my soul I don't need no
[59:59] upper room I have a understanding they
[1:00:01] would open up to me and Andy would
[1:00:02] prefer me and my understanding open up
[1:00:04] and I Know Who I am
[1:00:05] and I know my position I know my place
[1:00:07] and God yeah the next time they run
[1:00:11] pizza he run just as fast as Wednesday
[1:00:14] night Jesus Christ because he will have
[1:00:16] will be a man who we will open to he
[1:00:19] understand open but he have no power so
[1:00:22] when I'm Pharisees come with a long
[1:00:23] beard and his tall hats and their long
[1:00:25] booty gongs I'm sad to say he really
[1:00:31] nice Jesus all over again
[1:00:32] with all the understand look because
[1:00:34] when an Fela seelix is going to go on as
[1:00:36] human you're talking about nobody want
[1:00:38] to get blows nobody want to get prison
[1:00:40] nobody want to get lockup that's why
[1:00:42] they come and said behold your chapman's
[1:00:43] they make here after that is power
[1:00:45] inside them brothers behold their
[1:00:47] Trenton's and all they what they're
[1:00:49] doing and why did he rage and why David
[1:00:51] said that them pray no Lahaina prayer so
[1:00:53] then I care why the region I'm carrying
[1:00:55] on you say lord give us power to go back
[1:00:57] oh dear to face them Devils afresh
[1:00:59] I'm going sin dump all over again they
[1:01:02] were filled all over again because a
[1:01:04] refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:06] a fresh baptism fresh baptism a fresh
[1:01:09] anointing a fresh power or glory to God
[1:01:12] we want that fresh thing
[1:01:19] you see if I could only with my human
[1:01:21] voice missing their heart the importance
[1:01:24] of receiving the baptism Holy Ghost it
[1:01:26] will be the most wonderful revelation
[1:01:27] that we ever had in your life to see you
[1:01:30] must do it all glory to God
[1:01:33] so Satan makes sin appealing the enemy
[1:01:37] key is finding a better bait
[1:01:39] he will ship her off a little more I
[1:01:41] make I look naked woman say tanki's
[1:01:43] bring instant in and that was the
[1:01:45] original sin and the same thing as the
[1:01:48] kingdom come in the warfare now watch
[1:01:50] God here we go doesn't have to do
[1:01:53] anything to make it more appealing the
[1:01:57] only thing he has to do is to raise up a
[1:02:00] standard of his own word against the
[1:02:04] enemy and the Bible said when the enemy
[1:02:07] come like a flood the Spirit reads the
[1:02:09] standard what does he do he techniques
[1:02:13] the same word that he already said more
[1:02:18] positive that's how we raise our
[1:02:24] standard
[1:02:25] so the time is not yet I'm the devil
[1:02:29] isn't region in Trinidad and I wrong the
[1:02:32] world he's mad he is hungry he sees
[1:02:37] potential in you and he's trying to hope
[1:02:39] that he's angry understand that no no
[1:02:42] court going to raise our standard what
[1:02:44] does he do make the same word same would
[1:02:45] and make it more positive what did God
[1:02:50] do to Abraham telling me gonna have
[1:02:52] Isaac twenty five years if I'm standing
[1:02:54] alone Sarah clueless because Ibrahim
[1:02:59] couldn't share the revelation with Sarah

[1:05:38] identify that I'm not hearing you I'm
[1:05:42] not hearing you
[1:05:43] that is why Jesus opening understand in
[1:05:45] the scriptures that's right Peter who
[1:05:48] couldn't sign his mentor said this is
[1:05:49] that that the Prophet joy is because
[1:05:51] because Jesus took them in the joy he
[1:05:53] took them in Isaiah or glory of god'
[1:05:56] isaiah 28 with stammering lips somebody

[1:06:34] quickening power Paul was so filled with
[1:06:36] that power that they take clothes off of
[1:06:38] him and the anointing was on the cloth
[1:06:40] that's why the anointing will be on your

[1:07:02] glory of God hallelujah bill alert
[1:07:05] emails continue the message of the last
[1:07:09] day the even like messenger according to
[1:07:12] Malachi 4 will be turn in the house of
[1:07:15] the cheering back to the fathers the
[1:07:18] Pentecostal original message 33:30
[1:07:22] father's a next corty say the
[1:07:25] Pentecostal part a new restoration time
[1:07:29] so in other words the would have been
[1:07:32] restored but we have to come back to the
[1:07:34] pentecostal pad
[1:07:38] which is what is the original the
[1:07:42] Pentecostal part is a power part the
[1:07:45] spirit part
[1:07:46] 19:06 the thought that was the dynamic
[1:07:50] that was only a spiritual weakness
[1:07:53] hallelujah
[1:07:54] we're in the womb that's why the
[1:07:56] mysteries can reveal to them he said
[1:07:59] because they were only begotten that
[1:08:00] maybe Pentecost I was still in the womb
[1:08:04] so William Branham was sent to reveal
[1:08:07] the very person of God which is the
[1:08:10] person of the Holy Ghost so whereas the
[1:08:12] Pentecost in 1906 had the birth
[1:08:14] he brought the very person and revealed
[1:08:16] the person of Christ look at their
[1:08:19] compare from it consists of seven parts
[1:08:22] the very person of God and that is what
[1:08:25] has the commissary you the very person
[1:08:28] of Christ
[1:08:30] so he said you know whenever we come
[1:08:32] like a flood here is that standard
[1:08:33] against that watch and Eden he give them
[1:08:35] his word for the amma just the wood
[1:08:37] spoke then the enemy came in like a
[1:08:39] flood
[1:08:39] he took the wood and made it flesh to
[1:08:42] dwell among us a little stronger he's
[1:08:45] walking on the earth gonna corner hula
[1:08:46] rolling any home first it was spoken
[1:08:49] without he under no here it is
[1:08:51] you could touch it it's made flesh and
[1:08:54] then many enemy coming like a flood he
[1:08:56] poured a word into the prison being the
[1:08:59] form of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:02] so even was just wood today you eat
[1:09:05] thereof that day you die just would
[1:09:06] still be on the wood then he raised his
[1:09:08] standard and bring the wood to become
[1:09:10] flesh this is Jesus then he raised a
[1:09:12] higher standard and bring the word
[1:09:14] inside the people and to do that he had
[1:09:16] to comfort it in the spirit
[1:09:22] so word coming to you is the head
[1:09:24] knowledge is not information it's not
[1:09:27] how much a nobody message and Abadi
[1:09:28] peaks and about this hour he injures a
[1:09:31] holy angel wings went back and so on
[1:09:32] that's not bad
[1:09:33] that not word and you like when you
[1:09:34] could talk that's where they could
[1:09:39] explain but when that word becomes
[1:09:41] spirit that's you that comes into you
[1:09:46] let's continue
[1:09:48] he took the word or callosum so first of
[1:09:51] all it spoken word over yonder here it
[1:09:53] is you could touch then it could become
[1:09:54] a flesh and when he let me come in like
[1:09:56] a flood he poured a word into the person
[1:09:58] be in the form of the Holy Ghost here
[1:09:59] you walk one two tree justification son
[1:10:02] vacation

[1:15:56] about this on valgus with what speaking
[1:15:58] in tongues interpretation and times
[1:16:00] prophecies gives day may seem hard in
[1:16:03] training but brother on the battlefront
[1:16:05] every one of them got to be used every
[1:16:10] one of these gifts have got to be used
[1:16:13] God equips his shoulders exactly is what
[1:16:17] what admitted to use they might say just
[1:16:19] little psychology that won't work
[1:16:21] that's a stillness he brought me to the
[1:16:22] shell of a chicken stuffed a debt that
[1:16:24] is no good we have to have power of the
[1:16:28] Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all
[1:16:31] the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him
[1:16:34] but it's a big one
[1:16:36] when I see this year like I've never saw
[1:16:38] the one before this is what we're
[1:16:40] talking about the Holy Ghost coming upon
[1:16:43] a man with all nine spiritual gifts
[1:16:46] dwelling in him so you can fear to who

[1:17:30] have this thing this thing this thing
[1:17:33] there's no all mysteries new name seven
[1:17:36] thunders that pole or the same unknown
[1:17:39] language trumpets firewalls wannabes
[1:17:47] sudden you name it and don't have
[1:17:51] charity and in this is the Wonder
[1:17:54] discover modular sins
[1:17:56] [Laughter]
[1:18:02] ìin see charity I come to expose sins in
[1:18:06] that way but Charles easy wonders cover
[1:18:10] everyone little boy
[1:18:12] I can see charity gossiping I catch
[1:18:16] charity a classy chassis being selfish
[1:18:18] the Bible's a secret not our own charity
[1:18:25] do rejoice in iniquity so you can
[1:18:30] rejoice over somebody fallen condition
[1:18:33] or trouble condition or situation you
[1:18:35] can rejoice over that that's the charity
[1:18:38] it rejoiced nothing iniquity but they
[1:18:41] rejoice in the truth there here's
[1:18:45] something you believe all things are
[1:18:47] hoping for the best

[1:19:47] let my people go figure out a choice
[1:19:50] respond let them go on what that but he
[1:19:52] do believe because the Bible said God
[1:19:54] had inferior heart because quote want to
[1:19:58] break through and break Egypt to show he
[1:20:01] is gone I raise the fear for that sweat
[1:20:06] moves when God come you see is he is
[1:20:09] easing about it when the churn of God
[1:20:11] backslidden and the camera foolishness

[1:20:31] keep in captivity no once you make
[1:20:33] things right God raised the deal without
[1:20:34] a Syrian hallelujah when the backsight

[1:21:11] what's something the murid is the one
[1:21:13] again we have to have power of the Holy
[1:21:16] Ghost comment upon a man with all that
[1:21:19] nine spiritual gets dwelling in him you
[1:21:22] say I don't just get like to get out I
[1:21:25] don't like to pray all night I thought

[1:21:57] everything you need of this world or the
[1:22:00] world to come lives right in you
[1:22:01] that's the always corner on the
[1:22:03] equipment army he equip his army with
[1:22:05] the baptismal he goes he knew that we
[1:22:08] have to have it I'm a bomb come in the
[1:22:13] era are you ready
[1:22:15] he knew that we have to have it he knew
[1:22:19] that people would reason would go to
[1:22:22] reading this word when it become in
[1:22:25] print out there so he know that this
[1:22:31] world will come into print and people
[1:22:33] would read
[1:22:37] and because they like to read they keep
[1:22:40] on reading but they're not testing and
[1:22:42] hunger and for the baptism of the Spirit
[1:22:45] they're going by what they read I think
[1:22:54] it's what reason again he knew we have
[1:22:57] to have it he knew that people would
[1:22:59] reason would go to reading this word
[1:23:02] when it become imprint oh dear what

[1:23:20] people feed them or kind of vitamins and
[1:23:23] the first thing you know telling them
[1:23:25] that is a miracle is back so we filled
[1:23:27] with mysteries fever information fever
[1:23:29] knowledge are we still in research under
[1:23:33] war many church bench no please no

[1:24:02] Barbossa Abraham start another the
[1:24:04] promise have brought you unbelief what
[1:24:06] was strong in faith giving praise to God
[1:24:09] that that praise short strength of faith
[1:24:12] because faith is what you're hoping for
[1:24:14] fit is not yet but it shall be say it is
[1:24:18] what revealed you and it's not really an
[1:24:20] experience but it's revealed to you in

[1:24:32] victory praise God for the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] praise God for revival praise God for
[1:24:36] the promotion the increase arpaia
[1:24:39] praising God in advance
[1:24:46] God Nord it would take the baptismal
[1:24:49] holy ghost to prove his lack of these
[1:24:51] signs to be an effective witness Satan
[1:24:56] knows that reasoning what reasonable is
[1:24:57] to be an effectual winner of his
[1:24:59] resurrection he nolde
[1:25:01] it would take the Holy Ghost cause man
[1:25:02] kind of do those things do those things
[1:25:05] not talk those things not preach those
[1:25:08] things do those things or give the Lords
[1:25:11] sons praises hallelujah cause man can't
[1:25:15] do those things he equipped his army
[1:25:17] with the Holy Ghost to do those things
[1:25:19] to make known the secrets of the heart
[1:25:21] as he promised you can't do that with
[1:25:23] any kind of a training you've got to do
[1:25:25] it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:25:27] amur of God and this is the even light
[1:25:30] to make Hebrews 13:8 a reality then it
[1:25:34] will take more than a training you can
[1:25:36] read words and read words and read words
[1:25:38] but it will never come to pass until you
[1:25:40] have the Holy Ghost here to manifest
[1:25:41] that I didn't say it he said it three
[1:25:44] times you can read words you can read
[1:25:46] words you can read words but it will
[1:25:47] take the Holy Ghost to take them words
[1:25:50] and make it bigger come to pass that's
[1:25:52] the light put on the whole armour of God
[1:25:54] not just that just only I'm just a fancy
[1:25:57] glory to God I got the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:58] then split in all the power whistle you
[1:26:00] not doing no good put it into action put
[1:26:04] it in feet make it move make it do
[1:26:08] something put on the whole armour of God
[1:26:10] to go out and withstand the wiles of the
[1:26:13] devil or glory to God you think I act
[1:26:16] funny
[1:26:17] maybe I am I've lost my mind to the
[1:26:19] world and front it in Christ let that
[1:26:21] mind was in Christ being you it takes to
[1:26:23] bhakti not only goes the whole armor of
[1:26:25] God not just a shake hands with the
[1:26:27] preacher put your name on the book or
[1:26:28] take some cushion swallow it and some
[1:26:30] priests drink of the wine that isn't it
[1:26:32] but brother stay there until there comes
[1:26:34] out rushing mighty wind how do we don't
[1:26:37] talk about that stay there until the
[1:26:40] hammer rushing mighty wind that fills

[1:26:54] see brother the whole armour of
[1:26:56] is the baptism of the holy ghost with
[1:26:58] the word behind it if anybody says they
[1:27:00] got the Holy Ghost and I deny one word
[1:27:03] it's not the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[1:27:06] Ghost will accept and believe and
[1:27:07] confirm the word okay I'm finished now
[1:27:11] hallelujah
[1:27:13] now the big machine is setting up
[1:27:15] they're ready to move the mechanics is
[1:27:17] already dear they got the mechanical
[1:27:21] system of organization the United
[1:27:22] Nations the nations are united together
[1:27:25] its unite in time I preached it the
[1:27:27] United Nation is nothing but a big
[1:27:29] rubber balloon that's carried about what
[1:27:31] every nations been abducted
[1:27:33] it will bust and blob at anything at the
[1:27:35] can't work neither can the conformed to
[1:27:37] his work is an organization by man
[1:27:40] contrary to this system watch the other
[1:27:44] great churches the Pentecostal kingdom
[1:27:46] the full gospel people how can they
[1:27:48] fulfill the Evangel core teachings the
[1:27:49] very principles is stood for they will
[1:27:51] have to forfeit the evangelical doctrine
[1:27:53] to walk into man who disagree with the
[1:27:55] principle of the Bible there you are
[1:27:58] that's the or we have arrived that
[1:27:59] that's the big machine that setup they
[1:28:03] have got the mechanics they have the
[1:28:05] mechanics so if we listen the only thing
[1:28:08] they have to have is sitting in there
[1:28:11] with the dynamics the force the mocking
[1:28:15] of the beasts whatever we say about two
[1:28:17] services about national force what
[1:28:19] Israel in woman national fossil for the
[1:28:21] churches in the work of the churches but
[1:28:23] the power of God will put the people in
[1:28:25] the bag not a minister not teaching not
[1:28:28] preaching but the power so the power is
[1:28:30] what is promised Oh glory to God we
[1:28:33] believe that hallelujah glory to God
[1:28:37] so know the only thing you have to have
[1:28:39] is Satan India with dynamics so but over
[1:28:42] you mean United Nations the region for
[1:28:44] dynamics 1040 laws
[1:28:46] of course dynamics going to bring the
[1:28:49] past and make manifest everything it is
[1:28:51] when she is forced down then the
[1:28:54] dynamics is working the mechanics is he
[1:28:57] Thea you already caught them let me say
[1:29:00] something to disunite in time to see
[1:29:02] churches lighting niches in item is your
[1:29:05] dining time of God this bride - and I
[1:29:07] say this with reverence and respect I
[1:29:09] believe the Bride of Christ is called
[1:29:11] she is sealed in the kingdom of God so
[1:29:15] he is saying it and his prophesy
[1:29:17] I believe the mechanics is dear they are
[1:29:20] written for the dynamics what the bride
[1:29:23] is waiting for what the bride waiting
[1:29:25] for what about his waiting for he said
[1:29:29] they are waiting for dynamics that will
[1:29:31] take her off he attended glow in the
[1:29:32] rapture I believe it all my heart we
[1:29:34] don't know how he's gonna do it but he
[1:29:36] shall do it oh why because he is the
[1:29:40] dynamics so you mean a bishop is the
[1:29:45] dynamics write a message a person of the
[1:29:49] dynamics
[1:29:49] he is the dynamics we become members of
[1:29:52] the Machine of his body forming
[1:29:56] ourselves into his image and see him 19
