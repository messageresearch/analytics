Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence today may your bless the word that'll be read and may you be magnified and glorified no myths reason I ask it amen before we read the scriptures as Daniel heard the seven Thunders and forbidden John heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back was seen with Seven Seals but in the days of DC used to be open the mystery of God shall be finished in other words God will be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God will be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries were opened to the church because India the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out showing his signs of being alive among us living among us and then we are worshiping the living Christ that's Among Us what a promise the living Christ moving in and out like he moving this morning he can move in this evening moving in and out then you're worshiping the living Christ then you know you're coming into the presence of the Living God not a man God in the midst of the people so this evening two portions of scripture you want to read praise the Lord uh one from Daniel chapter Two I want to read 25-45 and first Thessalonians 4 15 to 18. this is Daniel we're only from verse 35 this is after the king got the dream couldn't remember the dream is All Shook Up and he called his wise men and suit tears and wizards and witches to tell him what the dream was I can't remember it they say well we have to get to know the dream he said well they can't tell me that dream and tell me the information I'll cut all the head off I only have gift for they playing holy spiritual depending on any remedy Spirit you better tell me the dream because forget a dream then somebody says dictate remember Danielle and Daniel went and sought the Lord and God gave Daniel exactly the dream and the interpretation so this is the last part of it verse 35 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken the pieces together became like the shaft of the summer trashing floors and the wind carried him away and no place was found for them and the stone that smoothie image became a great mountain and filled the whole head look look how positive this is this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king dawah king at the King of Kings for the god of Heaven had given the a kingdom power strength and glory and where server the children of men dwell the Beast of the field the Falls of the heaven that he given unto them hand and hat made the ruler over them all dawat this head of gold after the shall arise under the kingdom in fear it is he not the third Kingdom of brass which shall be a rule over all the Earth the the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron break it in pieces and subduate all things and as and that breakth all these shall it break in pieces and Brews whereas thou sowest defeat and tools part of Potter's clay part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of strength of the and for as much as though see us the iron mixed with Maori clay and as the toes of the feet were part iron part of clay so the kingdom shall be practiced strong themselves with the seed of men they shall not cleave one to another is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to another people but they shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms it shall stand forever for as much as those sowest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without the hands that is breaking pieces the iron the brass to Clay the silver the gold the great God had made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is sitting and the interpretation sure first Thessalonians 4 reading from verse 15. for this we see unto you by the word of the Lord that we which Our Lives remains unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which I sleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise Fist and we which Our Lives remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the ear so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these will let's pray father we thank you for your word blessed Lord and Inspire to the house of your children in Jesus I ask it amen may be seated praise God blessed be the name of the Lord I have a title this evening title is the coming of the headstone praise God this morning was The Headstone of the corner but this this evening the coming of the headstone okay now they never put a Capstone on the pyramid it was cut by man's hand it wasn't cut by man's hand it's God hands that cut the stone you see what did he do it hit the image and smite it smack defeat broke it to pieces grung at the powder what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church into Glory so this tone is important this Stone connected to the church going up into Glory watch up when the church in the glory at the Rapture cause it ended the Gentile dispensation God ended it up with the coming of that stone so just as Noah was waiting for water to float his ark the same Holy Ghost Noah was waiting for was going to kill the people this same Holy Ghost going to kill people this same headstone gonna close off the Gentile dispensation not one more Gentile to be saved not one more soul to be saved isn't that right praise God now we are coming right how many knows he said he said you know the primer was never capped the prayer was never capped never did the Capstone put on it they couldn't even find it they don't know what happened to it why why wasn't the Capstone put on it the headstone on the top of it because he was rejected when he come he was the rejected Stone that's right are you ready but it will be kept the payment was never capped but the prophecy is it will be capped no devil could stop it Satan himself could stop it Fallen Angels can't stop it no Minister Association no backslider no sinner no Pastor no Apostle nobody gonna stop it the pyramid gonna be kept Oh Glory to God hallelujah that's right and then here we go those stones that fit around the headstone as you were talking about now Peter called the Lively Stones our dead stones God call you out you have nothing to praise God for you think there's the only world this world is not our home we're just passing through you have to be a Lively Stone grateful to God thankful to God don't despise the day of small things praise God hallelujah if you lose your hands thank God your feet praise God you lose your feet you have hands Hallelujah lose this to lose that you talk like joke the Lord Give the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord praise God I won't be long with you this communion service there we go let's go then the coming of the Lord is so close at hand until the spirit took my spirit from way down here justification Sun vacation baptism of this Holy Spirit no right on into the time of the coming of The Headstone so there's a time for The Headstone to come Hallelujah are you ready the church has got to be so perfectly like Christ not a human business and flesh business no perfectly like Christ immaturity in Revelation in spirit the church perfectly like Christ not like church members that is bridesmaid the bride will be like the groom praise God his wife at mirrors are ready the church will take on the clothes of the word the bride will put on the clothes of the world oh glory to God the church going to be the bride will be like Jesus Christ or maybe believe that not not anointed Trinidadian Jesus Christ okay the Lord some Praises there we go the church might be so perfect like Christ until Christ and the church can unite together the same spirit and if the spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ act the Life of Christ do the works of Christ he that believeth on me what I do you're going to do also he's done right prophecy we have got a Ministry coming ministers don't want to hear this we have got a Ministry coming that's just exactly like the Life of Christ what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord okay the Lord some praises for Glory to God what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord what's the coming of the Lord the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice with the Trump of God that is the coming of the Lord oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God what part of his coming we're going to identify the bride William Branham identified a shout that's the first part the first fall of the coming but the Bible have to identify The Voice Jesus in manifested Sons because Jesus does all three he does the Shout by the gangli he does the voice and he does the Trump so Jesus will come back in manifested Sons oh give the Lord a shout of Praise glory to God do you believe that let's go no this may choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods how many ever know that how many energy has said so the Bible said did not your law see that you are God and Genesis 2 they were gods they had full domain over Dominion of the world he gave them dominion over all things but he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over what are you waiting for manifestation of the sons of God no that's a general statement let's brothers and get up give us the fine print all right waiting for the mindful sons of God then he said waiting for the fullness of time so he's qualifying it manifestation of sons of God fullness of time then he's thinking deeper waiting when the pyramid gets to the top oh you mean the pyramid will be capped you mean the sons of God is manifested when the pyramid comes to the top when you step out from brotherly kindness into the Holy Ghost slot okay the Lord I shout Oh Glory the court or do you catch it do you get it the Holy Ghost is where you have to give fitted in that is where the stones fitting around the headstone or get the Lord some Praises you can't go back to luta they can't go back to Wesley they can't go back to the Pentecostal Church you have to fit in the Holy Ghost luck Oh Glory the Lord that's where you put it inside of there between l-o-v-e and brotherly kindness is a holy spirit and then lgbtq want to take the pyramid and take it as Diaz with the rainbow color they are liars that is our thing that's not their thing that is Lucifer impersonating okay the Lord some praises Hallelujah glory to God lgbqt whatever it is taking the rainbow and putting that as a flag but like there is that a rainbow I know rainbow they know lion blasphemas Satan and meeting he's taking one more ride one more shot because the bride is on the earth now oh God he can't handle us right you know this bike can protect back from the devil all what he took from you you go take it back you go put your foot on the neck of them Kings all them things banging you or pouring that God they're gonna stamp on it oh Gloria gotta be pleasure put your foot is yours you're gonna stamp on the head of devils I believe that I believe that glory to God this Earth belongs to the Sons and Daughters of God they created for Satan sit on your boots and now you end up in the earth Hallelujah he have no flesh they step into man disemboweled spirit spiritual bodies looking for bodies to influence and that's why Satan will be born a thousand years you have nobody could work through with envy and jealousy and Malice nobody could work through then he's done by chains of circumstance and if he can get this church like that nobody will envy and jealous ego and your peace are stinking filthy flesh parade in his beef if we could get rid of all of that then Satan have nobody to use no jealous person no envious person no bad spirited person no person with bad attitude by the attitude nobody are begging you to come to church you could steal what they want this might

the Oh Glory two must have to shake cripples that are sick because the sons of God coming back sons of God coming through all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God was in Bones what's the name again forget your name foreign praise God the devil have to know that there's a power you know what it was all them Devils hiding them people all them years for hundreds of years no Devils casting out no Devils exposed crippled and Halt and blame and blind and then Pharisees only even given court and have they beard and twinkling their beard and a ceremony and Sprint panel thing praise like what did Catholic do today nothing happened and when Jesus come it's the first time you see Endeavors cast out devil Jesus exposed what behind that what behind blindness what behind what behind evil is that the cast them out and rip them out then they recognize the power that they're going in another dimension there's a power that sons of God have access to there's a power that we once had and we are going back to that power Lord Give the Lord a shout in the house he remembered I'm moving and God said Jesus said the same works that I do okay the Lord I pray shall you do also okay the Lord I shout and Jesus said these signs shall shall follow them that believe Give the Lord as short believers Give the Lord a shout the closest thing you had to cast no Devils but David bring

um but I deserves one so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ oh brother my crops are burning out yonder I have not any rain and then the brother said I send you in in the name of the

damn it God already oh give the Lord some Praises your oil down all over or give the Lord some Praises God could restore your joy God can restore your peace God can restore your Christian walk Walker restore your prayer life through the devil's a liar you've got to get back to prayer life you have to take it back all right now watch now remember appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to come now is the appearance he appears in his last days right here with us in the last few years no it's a sign of his coming wait a minute he has to appear among us before he come yes an appearance is a sign of this coming here you see it again that was in term evangelism this is Jehovah Jireh he says the appearing of Christ and then the coming of Christ that is two different things altogether the appearing and the coming he's appearing now working with us in the form of the Holy Spirit making it just perfect the church it has to be they told the Americans see they say watch The Pyramid as it shapes up the church justification sanitation but the Holy Spirit then it's got to be honed Out The Headstone never did come to the pyramid it was rejected just like the Cornerstone but when The Headstone comes I have been to the pyramid to publish it when Christ come to receive his church so Christ has to come to receive the church watch the church will have the ministry just exactly like that and through that Grace will raise the whole thing then go the coming of The Headstone still reading Crying Chris Grace unto it not legalism Grace that's why he said the powers to come Among Us it will be the grace of God not even the prayer of the people the Gentile Church in the loudest and age if the Jews are in their Homeland already there the Gentile apostasy has taken place we have a present like we have we have a nation broke up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangers we have a church that's Luke one all that set in order we have a church of people that pull themselves together as you know you have to pull it together you had to watch yourself anymore and say this is enough this choppiness and the school you just gotta continue you gotta pull it together your car just continue like that and insanities when you're digging the same hole they expecting a different result how long are they getting there something at least partner get nothing foreign and trust God for the Sun and trust God for the right anointing to raise your crap oh get the Lord a shout but they feel lazy lie down on your bed you will get hungry Hallelujah be careful watch we have our ministry patterns the ministry of Jesus Christ to catch the stone when he comes so only the Holy Ghost Ministry could catch the stone so it's not just what we're in church we clap and we sing and no we have to get another place we have to get into a position where Christ can come oh my and I'm going to summarize this I want to wrap up here um we know this but I want to talk about when somebody gets married in those times it wasn't a ring it was a band over the head everyone was caught in adultery they will take her to the temple take out that certain ring that

I ever saw that was in Cairo in prayer and a screen dropped down and I saw the second come of the Lord and that is how I went into this message by Vision I want to connected with this particular scripture I said church this have to be revealed brotherly love and God revealed it 1981. and the spirit poured out after that I remember I remember saying God wanted to see the whole thing this is my inspiration but where is the brotherly kindness God wants to seal it but when you're looking for it looking for honey does stick it look like it wouldn't stick it will stick it will stick as soon as Bradley kind of start to emanate watch the fire of God begin to move in the church well what's the power of God begin to move there are things in your heart you need to get out rock it wouldn't grow

the lyric lion and also win a season of the manifestation of sons of God it has to come together the car closes down because we have books the car closes down because we explaining things being a Pulpit the only way we can shut it off is that we start to resemble Jesus that's the only way because Satan didn't do nothing when they was drunk no alkaline drunk man you know you see when the creeper man walk the devil tell all them demons you have to stop this thing here you know that's why the Pharisees we read this morning had a conference to say shutting them and say listen do more no

times that's right brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him go anyhow somebody said long long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to Assemblies of God and Oneness and all the rest so brother Branham somebody asking around that hear his explanation see he has the virtues in him he said now watch then you see broadly kindness hoping someday patient with him Temperance and strong with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart virtue in yourself to Let It Go with kindness meekness to
