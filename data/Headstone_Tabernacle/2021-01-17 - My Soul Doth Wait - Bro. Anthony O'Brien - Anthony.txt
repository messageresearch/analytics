pastor asked me to speak about this morning and uh just want to kind of endeavor into the scripture here and so uh i have a thought and it says my soul doth wait that's my title this morning my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope that's my subject this morning so i took the title subject amen it's all in there my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope amen and amen hallelujah do you love the lord this morning amen i can't make the promise happen we've got to wait we can't make anything manufacture anything within ourselves we've got to wait on the law wait on his promises wait on his word to be fulfilled in our lives amen isn't that right and i chose for that subject in his word do i hope because that's where my hope is this morning holiday is not in the systems of man that has failed it's not in the economies of man that has failed but in his word do i hope in his word there is an anchor for my soul in his word there's a promise of restoration in his word there's a word hallelujah pray god soon in your life this morning and it doesn't matter what storm what tempest or what valley you're going through i come to tell you this morning that this is only a test that god knows the end from the beginning he brought you through too much to let you go now you mean so much to god that he left his home in glory to come down and to deliver his people hallelujah hallelujah pray he sent his only son to die on a cross i don't care how much times you tell it that story remains true he died didn't he die he bled and died but when he gave his last breath every power in hell was broken the back of satan was broken when he lay upon that cross and for every sin that you ever would commit he broke it he broke it the power of sin is broken this morning and right now in this place right now in this tabernacle you have a right to lift up your hands and say thank you jesus for saving my soul thank you jesus oh for making me whole he loved you that's why he died when you on that cross he you was on his mind when he was on that cross oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh can we praise him hallelujah oh my times is rough this year the doomsday sails are already talking about forecasting our dark shadow on 2021 praise god isn't that right amen makes me think about that scripture arise and shine for that light has come across darkness cover the earth crosstalk discover the people cover the multitudes cover the systems cover the governments they have a promise of darkness but upon you this morning arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of god is getting ready to be seen in your life i don't care what prophecy people have for what's going to take place i know the glory of god is promised to rest upon you this morning i'm not here to talk about the darkness sometimes we give the devil too much credit i'm here to talk about the light that's promised the glory of god that's promised to be seen upon the sons and daughters of god in the last days oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah watchman word of the night the morning cometh and also the night the night cometh for the unbeliever the night coming for the make-believer those who barely hanging in there but i know my god put a faith in my soul this morning he put a faith in your soul this morning and when all else fails when all else crumble when all else is forsaken that faith is what will stand a test the great word tests that's going on right now oh how you were built for this we were made for this we were designed for this age special forces for isaac hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hey many many men you appreciate that message from with isaac he preached it my god we certainly appreciate that principalities powers spiritual wickedness and high places coming to crush coming to cut off the pride hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right but god make a promise that when the enemy cometh like a flood the spirit of god the spirit of god hallelujah don't you be afraid of the spirit of god oh hallelujah isn't that right amen we talk about the word and praise god we preach a word for so many years but what are we looking for in this season is the spirit of god to come upon the word and make it live and make it manifest itself only god could do that that's what i'm waiting on my soul taught wait and in his word do i hope oh hallelujah glory so let's get to it my there's always a period in time in the christian journey when god gave a promise of something and then god makes us wait for that promise hallelujah isn't that right if he didn't make you wait there'll be no need for faith because he just give it to you right away but when he makes you wait the trial of your faith worketh patience waiting on god waiting for god to do as he said he would do you can't make it happen you can't force it to happen it's just got to happen that way amen is not right i remember the one time the prophet was saying something he show a vision of something and i think he shared it with the brother and so on something like that and the brother so only understood what the prophet is saying and and it began to play itself out in front of them and the brother praise god he saw it happening and he just held his silence he held his peace praise god and after a while everything worked out the way it was supposed to work out and the prophet turned to the brother and he said thank you for keeping the vision thank you for not for for not breaking your silence praise god because what was supposed to happen was supposed to happen praise god and it couldn't happen any other way but proving that what god showed a prophet could not fail it had to be done according to the vision and whatever vision god spoke upon in your life all in a cut to come to pass i don't care what the enemy says i don't care what the opposition says i don't care how it looks right now the vision is still true the vision is still to our appointed time through retiree wait for it it shall surely come to pass it will not tarry oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so god makes us wait and i love how he makes us wait he reveals his plan and purpose for our lives and gives us a vision and then goes away leaving us only with the vision of how his word will unfold oh hallelujah isn't that right and when all else fails us when our reasonings fail when our emotions fail when our conscience fail oh when these five senses fail when these five avenues fail the only thing that's left standing is your faith in what god said oh hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah we ought to walk by faith and not by these five senses we come into this world isn't that right sita is feel smelling here that is how we interact with this reality but this morning there's a greater reality that you cannot see with your natural eyes but it's right in front of you this morning there's something more real than this that's taking place right now in front of you that you can't see with your naked eyes but it's right in front of you right in front of you is the presence of god right around you is his angels oh it takes sense to keep charge to keep thee and all thy wage unless you dash your foot against a stone god is here this morning he's been with you even in the dark times even in the dreary times when you felt like you couldn't hold on when you felt like you wanted to give up he was there giving your theophany a charge giving you a charge in your spirit saying come on you can make it come on you can overcome greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh a crater oh hallelujah hallelujah of faith in you greater praise god hallelujah and what this world can declare in a natural crater is a fate that god put in you this morning that's how you're standing we didn't come here by chance no we're not here by accident everything that happened was according to the god's divine strategy according to god's divine plan he woke me up this morning and when he woke me up this morning i didn't have no doubt i was raised up all to destroy the works of the enemy he was raised up to declare the works of the lord the lord had chastened me sore but he had not given me over unto death open to me the cage of righteousness i will go into them and i will praise the name of the lord oh i come to praise him i come to worship i don't know about you i didn't come to look around at who's next to me and who's in front of me praise god i got my eye on the price i got my eye on the holy ghost oh he's leading the charge he's leading the way oh for whatever backward never no retreat no surrender let's blow the trumpet this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah it's called all god's people amen let's get into march amen amen [Applause] when god strips away everything from us the only thing left standing amen that's right it's the word of god the faith in the word of god that's right so god put us in a position where we're tear the stripped off of you you got to come through it can't come around it can't come over got to come through hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah jesus prayed for them sadly you they have come to your word and thy word is truth hallelujah now give them the strength lord bless them father give them bless their faith anoint their faith and spite the challenge in spite of the situation because perilous times will come but he told them he said not a hair on your head shall we touch i'll bring you before great man and i'll give you a word to speak i'll put my words in your mouth to confound the wise oh hallelujah god's gonna have a people on this earth that he could use that's what we come for this morning we didn't bring our intellectuals we didn't bring all smarts and all know hows when god's ready to use a man oh he gets god called man he beats the world out of them he beats all the feelings all the emotions all the cares of this life he beats it out of them doesn't matter how long it takes he beats it out of them you heard me this morning you beat it out of them what you're going through what you in right now some of you in a test some of you going into a test some of you coming out of a test but all of us are being tested this morning some to the waters some to the flood some two great childs but all through the blood oh he brings his sons and daughters all through the weary waters to put something in your soul [Music] hallelujah it all come down to the word because god is very concerned about his word being fulfilled he's not concerned about all this natural stuff we get caught up with all this natural stuff oh but build your hopes on things eternal and hold to god's unchanging hand oh i'm here to hold this morning to god's unchanging hand he says i am god and i change not and my soul taught weight and in his word do i hope isaiah 40 verse 8 says the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is as grass all things all things of the flesh is as grass this morning all your cares all what you what you want and what you feel what you don't like all that is as grass this morning oh hallelujah all riches all powers of this world oh it has crashed this morning oh hallelujah what shall stand the grass withereth and the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand forever forever forever what word he have concerning you this morning it's gonna stand forever i don't care what principality what power what spiritual ruler in high places is against you this morning i'm here to tell you no weapon formed against you is gonna prosper the lord is upon your life you are promised to see the glory of the lord oh hallelujah attach your promise that's your expectation this morning oh hallelujah [Applause] there is great blessing in the weight [Music] there's a great work that's being done in the waiting room and there's a saying that goes i like this he says it's not about the destination but it's about the journey that took you there and i believe this morning that god is interested in our journey because our adoption is not based on not nice things and if people like us so people have elected us or voted us a great man or great woman but but your adoption is based on your conduct and your behavior how you conduct yourself amidst the trials that he in his wisdom permits to come your way oh isn't that right sounds a lot like job this morning oh hallelujah isn't that right god turned to the devil i said have you considered my servant job hallelujah isn't that right and the devil responded said yeah he's a blessed man but that's cause you got a hedge around him i see you got a protection barrier around him everywhere he go you are going with him you dispatch angels to go before and behind oh hannah to cut the enemy off the devil see him long time but he couldn't touch him because god had his hand upon him oh holland that's how you are this morning the devil could watch but he can't touch unless he get permission oh to approach oh hallelujah to come close oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because god got his hand upon somebody this morning you might not feel like it oh you might be able to see it with your natural eye but his hand is there and when you feel like you can't carry yourself he carried you and when you look back at the footprints in the sand there's only one set of footprints that was jesus carrying you when you can carry yourself or somebody preached back to me this morning [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah all my hope is in jesus oh my soul thought wait and in his word do i hope oh is that the way you feel this morning [Applause] it's the journey that takes you there it's a journey that shapes you it is what molds you god finally gets an opportunity to put his hands upon your life when you're in that space of trying when you're in that place of great test of great tempest of great storm that's when he gets an opportunity to put his hand upon your life when you first come to the lord there's an excitement oh you're waiting for service right now and it's 3am saturday you're all excited you want to testify you want to share what the lord has done for you in your life but that's only the beginning that's when they're coming out when they were coming out of egypt brother there was a rejoicing in their hearts they were so happy to leave that stuff behind isn't that right that's how the christian journey is but it gets to a point when god takes you through the long way call it isn't that right he loves to take you through the long road because that road is designed to get the egypt out of you you might have come out of egypt but that egypt might still be there snake in the heart isn't that right sitting there quiet not saying nothing he's still there you're praising god you're coming to church paying attention but that snake is still in there attack fire to take him out take fire to burn him out and take hot childs hot testings thinking not strange the fiery trials oh hallelujah hallelujah oh but that's god's school of character training and development how god trains his man how god shapes his man oh won't he do it but the prophet said only god could train a man like that he'd take him to the wilderness take him to the valley take him to the mountain take him here take him there what is it it's the dove leading the eagles all the way to the adoption oh some to the waters some to the flood what god's gonna bring you through brother oh i'll wait until my change come that's what job said in the midst of his trial hallelujah i know my redeemer living though the skin worms destroyed his flesh but all fleshes as grass anyway why potter why why make why make a fuss holler i'm more interested in my soul's condition april brandon said i'd rather see my soul well then my body well anytime let me die in peace knowing i'm going to my savior if he don't heal my body i want him i need him to heal my soul oh i'm more interested in the condition of my soul this morning my soul has got to be anchored in the heaven of rest oh holland my soul that way and in his word do i hope oh jesus hallelujah [Music] [Applause] all glory [Music] many many many many men proverbs 3 and verse 11 says my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be wary of his correction for whom the lord love it he correct it even as a father the son and whom he delighted if you really love your children if you want them to go right you won't be afraid to correct them to instruct them don't go that way don't go that way oh isn't that right sometimes a mother scolds her children it seem harsh but she know the dangers because sometimes she walked that road before oh hastened to the word of your father your mother hallelujah they know the road oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right they've walked that road before oh isn't that right young young brother young sister hallelujah and if god love his uh if a father love his children so much how much god this morning is interested in your face how much he will correct you how much will he instruct you in righteousness don't be wary of his chasteners oh hallelujah hallelujah but have an open heart have an open amen open up your soul honor to receive god this morning to receive correction to receive instruction all harness that god could deal with you and show you the way because to be honest we don't know the way sometimes we try to act all brave we try to act all coy and like we know what's going on but the truth is we don't know we have not been this way before i never had to come to church in masks but we're in new territory praise god we in a new place god's getting ready to show us something to unveil his glory like never before no eye has seen nowhere has heard what god has in store for you oh hallelujah praise and if you don't know then lord show me where to go what to do give me the right attitude oh holy god the tutor the holy spirit is looking at your attitude in every test isn't that right before the sun comes to adoption he's got to go through tests and the tutor is what is there hallelujah isn't that right and then the natural lift is gone if men's got tutors to look over their sons before they come into position then how much god has got a tutor the holy spirit but this tutor is not limited by time and space no no no he can move anywhere he can be anywhere oh he's right where you are he's with you on the street he's with you in your home he's with you in your car he's listening oh hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah oh hallelujah he hears your cry this morning second peter 4 and 1 to 2 says for as much then as christ had suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh had ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the loss of men but to the will of god amen isn't that right so this suffering in the flesh is to bring into a state of deadness to self-debt to your ideas debt to what you think to what you feel oh if you're dead you're not supposed to be able to respond isn't that right then when the tests come you have no self to defend oh because you reckon yourself ted to the things of the world ted to what they say about you dead to the doubts dead to the fears dead to unbelief oh hallelujah and then god could put his hand in your life god becomes life to you because everything else is dead he beats it out he strips it out he boils it out oh hallelujah whatever he has to go you through to get you ready to be molded in the hands of the maker this morning isn't that right amen little vote down verse 12 says beloved think it not strange concerning a fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoice oh this morning inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy and if you be reproached for the name of christ happy i.e oh hallelujah hallelujah you ought to be glad this morning to be reproached for the name of christ to bear to reproach hallelujah amen amen for the spirit of the glory of god rested upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified amen and the prophet was praying here excuse me prophetess praying he said then he said uh thinking not strange that these trials come they're only working out for all good and to perfect us and bring us into that place these great deserts of experience oh i love that these great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into saints we thank we thank thee for these experiences lord for we would no mean no no wise want to do anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this we'll be brought closer to you isn't that right amen just a few more scriptures and we get on james chapter one says verse two says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations oh hallelujah hallelujah fallen into temptations or if you're in a temptation this morning count it all joy it means god has a hand in your life if you are not being tempted if you are not being tested be very worried because the devil has all oh hallelujah but there's an elect this morning that is on the earth that is being tested that is being tried oh holla he can get all but he can get some but he cannot get all this morning god's got some in his hand oh holla that he is using to shake this world one more time oh hallelujah tempted and tried oh halloween offbeat to wonder but all god is able to deliver he is able to restore he's only testing you to see if you will hold on to see if you won't let go of his promises to see if the faith in you could stand the test of time oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah knowing this that the trine of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that he may be perfect and entire meaning whole and wanting nothing oh isn't that right amen and amen hallelujah glory to god amen so god shapes us and he moves us and he makes us into what he wants us to be isn't that right hallelujah and i wanted to bring out this here what the prophet is talking about on the masterpiece amen and how he was talking about michelangelo amen isn't that right the great sculpture who sculpted that moses uh uh image isn't that right out of the rock and he says here in this masterpiece he had made it he said it cost him something to do that he said he was a great man and it cost a big part of his life talking about the sculpture himself because he was many many years in carving it out oh it don't come for free friends it come at a cost jesus dying for you came at a cost but he was willing to pay that cost because you was worth something you was worth taking the time you was worth looking at you was worth thinking about oh hallelujah he was worth dying for this morning it cost something but it was worth the cost because you are precious in his sight this morning oh hallelujah he loves you this morning don't ever make the devil make you feel like you are worthless this morning why did he die why did he pay all this price why would he do all that he did oh it was not for naught oh but your soul was worth saving oh i thank him oh because he delivered me he didn't have to do it but he did and i'm so glad he did oh hallelujah isn't that right the bible talks about the love of god that covers the whole world that covers all the sin isn't that right isn't that right but then the bible also talks about his elective love his predestinated love that's god's sovereign ability to choose whom he will he said jacob i love esau i hate how you gonna fight up with that that's god's elective love because god saw something in jacob that he loves jacob didn't care about nothing else but the bird right he had a thirst in his soul for the bird right and god's children this morning have a hunger in their soul have a thirst for something real they don't care about natural things they don't care about wild peas and honey they come for the good rights they need the birthright give me what is promised give me what is mine i come for the holy ghost i don't have strength this morning i need your strength i don't have what it takes give me your spirit [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah god's children ain't afraid to cry oh they gotta cry in their spirits a passion to know the word a filth and desire to please god oh hallelujah hallelujah and if you don't have it then pray for it because that's what you need in your soul that's what the young people need that's what the caleb's need that's what the deacon needs that's what the elder needs that what the minister needs we all need it oh hallelujah my soul thought wait and it is further what do i hope all his word is true this morning his word is real this morning oh hallelujah is just as true it will stand shore amidst the darkness amidst the trial amidst the temptation when all else is false all else crumbles when all else fails his word is the only thing left standing [Applause] brother branham said michelangelo had to get a vision in his mind of what he was trying to create before he created it and you know that excites me because i'm an artist i'm a designer amen amen and the way the prophet brought it out amen hallelujah i saw it so real he really caught the mind of an artist because that's what it has to be and it can't be wavering it has to be one vision you can't wake up the next morning and change the vision because five months down the road you get a shape-shifting sculpture isn't that right it's got to be singular single-eye single motive one objective one purpose you're trying to achieve isn't that right and you gotta keep your mind on that no matter what distractions come your way your focus on this one vision and when god created us when god had you in his mind he had one purpose one vision of how he was gonna make it of one vision of how you was going to look god had the end picture already painted in his mind before he even start getting to work oh hallelujah oh i don't want to take too long on this but hear me now now now now now it's it's a difficult thing to do this what he's doing here sculpting because it's like cutting hair like your brothers don't know it if you go to the bar and you cut off too much oh you're in trouble you can't fix it you can't add back peace take a screwball isn't that right so so so that's how it is it's that kind of a technique where he's taken away all that is not the image so that the image could remain so that the vision could remain now if you add in stuff you could feel free because you could add take away it's not but the nature of the thing is such that it's not like that you take away and that's it what's left is the image so you got to really take your time and you got to really know what your next move is every move has got to be strategic every step has got to be ordered otherwise you're going to mess it up and god can't afford to mess this up he's waited too long six thousand years a long time to wait on this masterpiece of a bride that he is making in this last hour oh do you hear me this morning that's why he loves to wait because in the waiting there's patience to know where to go next what to do next where to chisel sometimes he'd sit and stare the sculpture and look at this rock and people think he's crazy but he's just waiting to put the right chip in place to make it more perfect oh hallelujah to make it bad to make it blossom [Applause] this morning and we were sharing some things and and it came out to me you know he said that's how it is because you know even sometimes that sometimes when you're working on something i'll tell you this give it a little tidbit when you're working on a piece of work sometimes it's good to get out of the play get out of the way go do something come back the vision remains true but when you come back praise god the artist it gets a fresh a refreshing of what's supposed to take place and sometimes god seemed to go away for a while in our lives seems like nothing is going on but the artist is getting ready to make his next move and in order to make his next move he's got to be in the right frame of mind hallelujah hallelujah he was perfect the first time so so he's dwelling on it isn't that right hello isn't that right and in that silence you're there and sometimes you feel like you're forsaken like you're abandoned like nothing's going on but god's got his mind on you still oh he might not be where you want him to be but he'll be there on time oh hallelujah don't you worry he'll be there to rescue your soul oh he didn't promise that the road wouldn't get wary he didn't promise that you would meet up obstacles along the way but his promise this morning is to catch you every time you fall oh hallelujah to make a way for you or to see you through [Applause] hallelujah prophet said and when he got it all perfect every corner every place rubbed and the eyes just right every here every beard all the way it was talking about that sculpture he stood off and he looked at it the prophet said i think had many years of labor how he had to hold that same vision all the time in his mind of what he was going to do and just to think that vision on his mind for so many years to make it look just exactly to what it was and then he caught the vision isn't that right and when he got away he perfected it till he really caught perfect prophet said he stood and looked at it and when he finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand he was so inspired when he looked at it because a vision of his mind was standing before him in reality what he had seen and his conception of moses praise god in that the toils the hours and everything else he said write a vision until it's completed the prophet said he took a hammer and he struck that image and said speak oh hallelujah it was so real to him he felt like it could come alive he felt like he could speak but brother there's gonna come a real masterpiece one of these days that when the power of this church rises when the power of the dynamics really strikes his pride or she will speak oh she will speak for god or she'll be in his image she'll be in his likeness oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god do you believe it this morning hallelujah oh my my my my hallelujah from god call man the prophet here says and we thought tonight and we think on that he's talking about revivals and he said and remember that in the midst of all this cry god cannot send a revival until he's got men in shape to take it we cannot have a revival there was his wisdom until we get men god called men god trained men that's not trained up in the schools of theology and of education but rugged men of faith that god has brought up in the school of his rugged training men who are not afraid to face the fire man who has come in the presence of god who knows his power who knows his omnipotence and who knows his healing power oh hallelujah is god's training such a man in this hour in this season oh isn't that right oh holla that's why he's got to take you through so that he could shape you for this great revival if you're talking about revivals then there's got to be a shaping that comes first there's got to be a molding that comes first oh hallelujah isn't that right even though david was anointed he had to be on the back side of the desert a long time i don't know how long he was there but but that's where god trains his men there on the backside in the deserts of the court experiences like the prophet said isn't that right where he trains you where he molds you where you face the lion where you face the bear by yourself ain't nobody around nobody to encourage you but david said i encourage myself oh i'll look at myself in the mirror i tell myself i'm going to church this morning oh hell you stay there i'm going to church this morning i'm gonna lift up my hands i'm gonna praise my god i'm gonna tell him how much i love him doesn't matter how i feel doesn't matter what's going on in my situation god's gonna get the glory in my story don't you worry oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] oh man hallelujah isn't that right some man that's trained to know the living god it's all right to train him by the word he said but the letter kill it the spirit give it life and before we can have this revival god has to call out and train men god trained men to carry this message he said and they don't care what the opposition is they're willing to go to the fiery furnace in defeat or to the lion's den oh i hear me this morning they're willing to go do he slay me yet i trust him it's god that's leading he won't kill you he'll just take the world out of you but go through brother some through the waters you've got to go through oh holla but in the waiting there's a blessing there in the persian in the prison of god's purification that's where god melts you that's where god molds you that's where god shapes you [Applause] david was supposed to be king he might not have looked like it when he was in the desert if you saw the end of david's story you would think how could a king be already in the desert taking care of sheep smelling like sheep huh it doesn't look like the end of the vision but god knows what he's doing god's getting it ready praise god knows how to shape how to mold david went quite to went through quite a journey but when he got to where god wanted him he was fit for the office he was fit for the position he was bright what god needed oh hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right look at joseph amen god give him a dream said amen the sheaves will bow to you isn't that right and the stars and so on and he's telling his brethren because because he's so excited about this testimony and his brothers are not so excited about his testimony matter of fact they jealoused him isn't that right they hated him without a call as the prophet said why did they hate him because he was the word oh and he was bringing them the word oh and they hated him for it oh isn't that right and it turned against him but all that was in god's plan because they sought to kill him and one of the brothers said don't kill him don't lay our hands on our brother let's tell him off to ishmael is not right isn't that right hallelujah praise god and god hallelujah isn't that right working in that plan hallelujah praise god lay not a harm on him i've got a work for him to do in the future oh hallelujah isn't that right and god takes him he ends up in egypt in the house of the captain of the god potiphar isn't that right and i you know in reading this story i realized that that in there the prophet uh the bible says that uh in the house of potiphar he was still blessed in that position even though he was far from home far from everything that he knew even though far away from his mother his father yet where he was god blessed him until potiphar gave into his hand to keep charge over his house and to see about his affairs god still blessed him there isn't that right and even when potiphar's wife came and began to stir up trouble because the bible says she didn't come once you know she came almost every day harassing joseph and he said no and every day she come he said no and he keeps saying nope oh until she was wrought until she sought to grab at him and that's when she ended up with the garment isn't that right the devil is not gonna ease it up on you brother he gone come every day the bible said he's the accuser of the brethren accusing us before all lord day and night bringing up your sin bringing up your past bringing up your sorrows but as fast as he bring it up the blood of jesus is there like a bumper bumping off your sin pumping off your filth oh brother thank god for the blood the blood prevails the blood of the bleed and lamb speaking better things on your behalf oh than even the blood of abel or the blood of bulls and goats hallelujah the blood of jesus christ thank him for the blood oh hallelujah hallelujah and we know the story he ended up in the prison house but even in that situation he was still in charge of things he found favor with the prison the head of the prison and was sent to keep charge over the prisoners there i'm saying all this to say that when god's favor is upon your life even when it seems like you're in a dark place even when it feels like you're in the shadows god's hand is still upon your life oh come on now he never let his seed peg bread oh hallelujah even though you might not have money in your pocket but you know god's been providing for you he bring you food he put clothes on your back he put gas in your car i can't understand it i can't even explain it oh it's just god's favor it's just god's mercy where would i be without his love where would i be without his mercy recognize the hand of god in your life this morning oh and give him praise give him thanks oh he made a way out of nowhere he provided for you he is jehovah jairo he provided for your every need according to his riches in glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh in every situation he makes a way of escape oh he will not give you more than you can bear oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] amen oh amen amen glory to god hallelujah when god gets ready to do something in the supernatural realms he usually gets a man that he can put his trust in and anoints him and sends him out and he's fearless at the job that's the kind of men we need today not polish scholars but men who know god in the power of his resurrection he said for instance there was a man in the bible by the name of moses he got all his training he knew all the theological theology he knew everything he should know but even if even if he would have needed education he could have teach the masters in israel he didn't need one thing isn't that right he could teach their scientists a thing or two isn't that right the prophet said he said but yet it take god 40 years to beat all of that out of him out there in the sands out there in the deserts and when he got all his intellectual conceptions of god beat out of him there in the sands the metal was ready to be molded over he said and that's the way god takes his men and beats out all of their fears all of their intellectuals and the great master potter puts them on the wheel and begins to maul them over again work men worthy oh hallow worthy for the master's use or vessels to be used for the master's use god wants to use somebody the spirit of god is looking this morning for hands that he could use feet that he could use the devil is looking for people and god is looking for people too oh i let the dynamics of this church getting ready to strike our body our bride body on the urge that he could move and say here is my spirit flowing freely i could use him i could use her there is my spirit this is my beloved one in whom i'm well pleased amen but it take a process to get us in there and that's what we're talking about this morning waiting on the lawn for god to perform his work in our lives and make us what he wants us to be amen men that great call that he's upon your life this morning not by chance god gave the vision isn't that right just like he gave to joseph and joseph was doing pretty good in possible house you know he he had a good job i don't know how long he was there but he was working for the captain of the guard he had a little apartment inside there pushing a little chariot it wasn't too bad but that's not where god wanted him and god caused situations god caused strife to come into his life for a purpose because because god wasn't satisfied with with joseph just having a good job no no he needed to promote joseph who already needed to put him early where he needed to be because there was a famine coming there was a famine coming joseph might have his nice job and he had his money to pay for his coffee but but there's a famine coming oh hallelujah and you might be doing all right but there's a famine coming and because there's a famine coming god it's got to put you in position got to put you in place oh hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah when the trials come that when the testing come oh hallelujah when the shadow falls you'll be in position that god be able to use you oh thinking not strange or are you raised up for such a time as this oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah courts call his men god's got his women oh where he needs them to be oh god's getting ready to put his hands oh upon his bible pride in the last days oh she'll be a mighty army she'll be an invincible army brother oh there'll be no sound of retreat there'll be no sound of surrender in this mighty army this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah holiday can face the opposition anytime anywhere under any condition or under any situation if it go to the fiery furnace oh my soul thought wait if i gotta go in the lion's den my soul taught which oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the prophet said she'll have to save the lord or she keeps still oh you don't go by feelings you don't go by intellect we are not being led oh by your human mind this morning our mind is broke up there's nothing that we can rely on nothing that we can hold on to but all our hope is in jesus this morning all of our hope all of our faith is in his word and where he leads me i will follow where he leads me i will go oh he's calling this morning oh he's calling you this morning you mightn't think much of yourself but he's still calling you this morning because he put something inside your soul to stand the test of time and though the winds flow contrary yet in my flesh i shall see god i don't care what the devil says i don't care what my body says i've got to see him i want to be like him i have a desire i have a longing oh in my heart for him this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh i'm getting ready to close out courage prophet said god don't want cowards he can't use you if you afraid to take his word and believe him he wants gallant men won't pay no attention to nothing but what the lord says what what regardless of what what the pastor says the church or whatever he stands for god and for righteousness and his word that's the man we need isn't that right god will send these days for his revival that his people are praying for oh hallelujah a few more and i'm closing god's trying today it took empty the world out of us to get us to empty ourselves out oh hallelujah we try to pack too much stuff on us oh hello trying to get up to the resurrection huh god's trying to empty you out you can't go to heaven in that condition isn't that right i remember a story a old man told one time he said he said one time he said his mother put him outside to get him ready for church he said he made him had him looking real nice he said you wait here we're getting go get ready to go to church and he stood out there sitting out there waiting for his mom and the boys was outside playing in the yard and they said come come and play in the yard with us and he said a little while he he liked it and then he found himself doing it he said after he played he got muddy and when he came up to the door he knocked on the door and he said mama mama and when she opened the door she said son why are you looking like that she said you can't come in my house looking like that and she brought him inside and cleaned him up and he said he said i love my mother in that moment because he said i did she didn't say i couldn't come inside but he said you can't come in my house looking like that and i feel that's the way god feels we can't come in his house looking like that the way you're looking you got to get cleaned up you got to get your soul right you've got to get your garments washed come and me wash in the blood of the lamb don't go in god's house looking like that god's got to empty you out god's got to purge you out god's got to get you ready to go into his house come and go with me to my father's house where there's peace where there's joy where there's a holy ghost in you and abide in it oh hallelujah hallelujah he said to empty yourselves out and be fearless men and women who love god and will stay with god and will cross the separating line of jordan that he could use for his glory oh he's not right he could play something softly this is the hour i want you to think hard he said he said and if you never cross this place if you never come across this line where you say well my mother belonged to a certain church that's all right he said but that doesn't take your place see god is calling men and women today to the battlefront he's not calling them to gilgal he's not calling to peel potatoes isn't that right he's not calling him to jericho or bethel he said they will perish but he's calling him to cross jordan so you can get he can get you out into the school of his own power and make you and mold you isn't that right isn't that right he said what is it it's crossing jordan get alone with god you can stand lay in his own furnace of refinery get on the big masters potter's wheel and let him mold you tonight while we're in prayer we're coming to that place he said lay yourself right over on his wheel and say lord here i am mold me and make me after your own fashion and god will do it may the lord bless you this morning my soul god wait and in his word do i hope can we give the lord of praise just lift your hands right now i'm finished may the lord

morning one more time every head bowed every eye closed our gracious heavenly father lord we are so blessed this morning lord hear these words of eternal life a reminder of how you take time to craft this masterpiece and how you will just walk away to come and take another look and the vision is sure the vision is clear the vision of perfection and this unfolding that takes time that every move is calculated every test calculated every blessing calculated because you are concerned with what this end product would look like and in so many ways lord we see it unfolding in our own lives lord and we could connect to what was spoken this morning and lord we have seen so many requests turn into notes or praises as we have read so many here this morning now lord for our sister mercier who longs
