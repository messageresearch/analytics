[39:25] Lord Jesus to hear you speak to us in
[39:28] these last days Lord that we live in
[39:30] Lord we pray that you would come and
[39:32] breathe life into your word tonight Lord
[39:34] we have a scripture here we have a
[39:36] little inspiration tonight we want to
[39:37] speak on dear God we asking that you
[39:40] would take it Lord into your hands now
[39:41] father and may you use it and bless it
[39:43] Lord and may it be a blessing to your a
[39:46] ministry. Dear God, help us, Lord,
[39:48] tonight to see where you are pointing us
[39:49] to, dear God, to see what you want us to
[39:52] see, Lord. Father, give us eyes to see,
[39:54] Lord. Lord, and speak to our hearts and
[39:57] help us tonight as we have so great need
[39:59] of thee, Lord, in many ways. You know
[40:02] the needs of the people. May you take me
[40:04] out of the way tonight and minister to
[40:05] their needs tonight. We just give
[40:08] everything over to you tonight, Lord,
[40:09] for service. We pray I have your way
[40:12] tonight, Lord, for a few moments as we
[40:14] wait for your presence to come in Jesus
[40:17] Christ's precious name. Amen. And amen.
[40:20] You may have your seats.
[40:23] Amen.
[40:24] So again, we thank God for the privilege
[40:26] to be here. And uh praise God.
[40:34] Praise God. Okay.
[40:37] All right. So just for a title tonight,
[40:40] uh wanted to preach on this subject and
[40:43] it was so interesting because uh I
[40:46] believe brother Gideon administered last
[40:48] last Wednesday and he actually touched
[40:51] on this during the service and it was
[40:52] really wonderful uh how it just flowed
[40:55] right through there with the inspiration
[40:57] that he had and it was such a blessing
[40:59] to us there. But I guess uh uh in a
[41:02] sense we're going to zero in on this
[41:04] scripture here tonight and just kind of
[41:06] bring this thought out. So my title
[41:09] tonight is ye shall serve God upon this
[41:13] mountain.
[41:15] Amen. You shall serve God upon this
[41:18] mountain.
[41:20] You love the Lord tonight.
[41:22] So in this scenario of the scriptures,
[41:25] we find that God's people would have
[41:27] left Canaan.
[41:29] uh they would have left uh uh the desert
[41:32] as it were or the wilderness and they
[41:34] would have made the journey into Egypt
[41:37] and um
[41:40] uh you know so this this all happened
[41:41] just long before Moses and everything
[41:43] else right and um they would have made a
[41:46] journey into Egypt and Joseph and all
[41:50] his house and the people of Israel would
[41:52] have left the desert they would have
[41:54] gone into Egypt and the reason for this
[41:57] was because of as we know the famine
[42:00] There was a famine that was to come, a
[42:03] devastating famine that was to hit
[42:05] everywhere.
[42:06] And if it had not been for the gift that
[42:08] was in Joseph, uh Pharaoh would not have
[42:11] known about it. Egypt, just like all the
[42:14] other nations, would have suffered uh
[42:17] the devastation of this famine. Uh they
[42:20] would have all been consumed by it. They
[42:22] would have all been destroyed by it. But
[42:25] it was just the grace of God upon
[42:27] Joseph's lives that allowed him to
[42:29] interpret the dream that Pharaoh
[42:32] received from the Lord.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; And they didn't know what it was. But
[42:36] God had a man in place uh in spite of
[42:40] the Lord to interpret a dream. And God
[42:43] always has people in place to do his
[42:45] will. God always has someone he could
[42:48] put his hand on and say, "Here's my
[42:50] spirit flowing freely." Throughout the
[42:53] ages, it's always been that way. And we
[42:55] believe tonight without a doubt that
[42:57] there's a people in the land once more
[42:59] that God is going to put his hands on
[43:02] and they are going to be a ministry in
[43:04] these last days. Do you believe it
[43:06] tonight?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; So, Joseph was that man at that time?
[43:10] And he had this gift and he was able to
[43:12] interpret a dream and that's how Egypt
[43:14] escaped the famine. Seven years of
[43:17] plenty, then seven years of famine. And
[43:21] during that time of famine as we know uh
[43:24] uh uh it was it waxed sore upon the
[43:27] land. This is how it was described in
[43:30] the Bible. And because of Joseph's
[43:32] prudence because of his wisdom uh how to
[43:36] deal and manage with the famine and the
[43:39] time of lack or the time of want. Uh he
[43:42] was they were able to have something uh
[43:45] a meal to eat every day. They were they
[43:48] had stored up grain to go back to
[43:50] because someone had the wisdom to put
[43:52] that together.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And so Egypt because
[43:56] of that wisdom that was in Joseph, Egypt
[43:59] is indebted to Joseph because of the
[44:02] gift of God that is upon his life.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; And he is able to predict this famine
[44:06] and store up grain in order to escape
[44:09] starvation and death.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Egypt is actually indebted to this man
[44:15] of God. uh because without him their
[44:19] economy would not have survived, their
[44:22] economy would not have prospered. Uh but
[44:25] because God had a gift in place, Egypt
[44:28] survived the famine. They they survived
[44:30] the economic drought. They survived the
[44:33] time of lack, the time of starvation,
[44:36] the time of want, the time when they
[44:38] could not plant anything. God had a man
[44:41] to give out grain. He said, "Lo, here is
[44:45] seed for you." Isn't that right?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; God always makes a way of escape.
[44:51] Every time the devastation comes, every
[44:54] time the destruction comes, he always
[44:56] makes a way of escape for his people
[44:59] throughout every age. And in this story,
[45:02] we see it is exactly the same. And we
[45:04] know that there's a time of destruction
[45:06] that is also coming upon the earth. and
[45:08] and and we know that God is again going
[45:11] to make a way of escape for his people
[45:14] in the last days. He has again made a
[45:17] way for us to get out of it. He he he he
[45:20] never passes us through anything. Praise
[45:22] God. That is too much that we can bear.
[45:24] But in every trial and in every test, he
[45:27] provides a way of escape for us because
[45:30] he loves us tonight.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[45:33] Psalms 91 and verse1 says, "He that
[45:36] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[45:39] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[45:42] almighty. I will say of the Lord that he
[45:45] is my refuge. He is my fortress and in
[45:49] him will I trust. Surely he shall
[45:52] deliver thee, come on now, from the
[45:55] snare of the fowler and from the noisome
[45:57] pestilence. and he shall cover thee with
[46:00] his feathers, and under his wings will
[46:03] you trust.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Uh he's always made a way of escape.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; For them that love him,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; for them that obey him.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And are faithful to his word.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Praise God. So whenever
[46:17] God God has got his hand on you, uh he
[46:20] will never let anything happen to you.
[46:23] Uh because you are the purchased of his.
[46:26] Isn't that right? You are members of his
[46:29] kingdom. You are royal subjects of his
[46:31] kingdom. And because he is responsible
[46:34] for you, he's never going to let
[46:36] anything happen to you because his
[46:39] testimony is on the line. And his
[46:41] testimony says that wherever you go, his
[46:44] spirit is bound to follow after you.
[46:47] Hallelujah. He's supposed to look out
[46:49] for you, protect you. He will never
[46:51] leave you or forsake you. So in order to
[46:54] keep that word, he has to have angels
[46:57] encamped around you to keep you in all
[47:00] your ways lest you dash a foot against a
[47:03] stone. Oh hallelujah. The devil must not
[47:06] be able to point a finger. Praise God
[47:08] and say God is not able to keep his
[47:10] word. No, he can keep his word. Even in
[47:13] the most dire of circumstances,
[47:15] God in any devastation is able to keep
[47:18] his people.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; And we've seen that happen throughout
[47:21] all the ages. Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; So, we're building up to this here now.
[47:26] So, they going down to Egypt to dwell
[47:28] all the time. They were in Canaan coming
[47:29] through all through the ages. Abraham,
[47:31] Isaac, Jacob, and so forth. When they
[47:33] come down to Joseph and the prophecy,
[47:35] they had to leave that place and go and
[47:38] dwell in Egypt land. Isn't that right?
[47:41] In a strange land. And this was all
[47:43] according to prophecy because God had
[47:45] already spoken to Abraham ages ago and
[47:49] had prophesied that this would happen.
[47:51] that my people would sojourn in a
[47:54] strange land. And so they left that
[47:56] barren desert. Isn't that right? And
[47:58] went into a land that was prospering
[48:00] under the hand of Joseph.
[48:03] Uh uh so they left that far country.
[48:05] Isn't that right? And so I guess to me
[48:06] it was like it was like leaving Trinidad
[48:08] to go live in New York City. you know,
[48:11] leaving Trinidad to go live in London or
[48:13] or Dubai, this megaplex city with
[48:16] business and commerce and industry and
[48:19] people and markets and sheep coat and
[48:22] all these different things that's
[48:23] happening and there was activity and and
[48:25] all these things. Isn't that right? And
[48:28] so they left all that behind and they
[48:30] were actually blessed and the Bible said
[48:31] they actually multiplied in the land of
[48:34] Egypt.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; But this was not their promised land.
[48:38] They were just there to escape the
[48:40] famine. This was not God's ideal idea
[48:44] for them to live in. He had a plan. He
[48:47] had a purpose and he had a place where
[48:49] he wanted his people to dwell. Egypt
[48:52] didn't belong to them. It was just a
[48:55] means of escape for that time.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And so in Exodus 1 in
[49:00] verse 5, it says all of the souls that
[49:02] came out of the loins of Jacob were 70
[49:04] souls for Joseph was in Egypt already.
[49:07] So they came and met Egypt there.
[49:09] Obviously as we know because Joseph was
[49:11] sold by his brethren uh out of betrayal
[49:14] and sent ahead to preserve life. And so
[49:17] when all these things unfolded, they
[49:19] came in in the aftermath and he said
[49:22] that I am sent here to make a way for
[49:23] you. Isn't that right? And so he made a
[49:26] way for God's people. And that was that
[49:30] season. See? And so now all the souls
[49:32] that came out of the loins of Jacob were
[49:33] 70 souls for Joseph was in Egypt
[49:36] already. And the Bible says, "And Joseph
[49:38] died and all his brethren and all of
[49:42] that generation." And now we're going to
[49:45] observe something here. Now notice that
[49:47] an entire generation has died out. God's
[49:51] people have dwelt down in Egypt long
[49:53] enough for an entire generation to have
[49:56] died out. And now a new generation of
[49:59] God's people are dwelling in this
[50:01] strange land. Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Uh this old generation would have been
[50:05] connected to the story of the betrayal,
[50:07] to the story of uh uh uh lying to Jacob
[50:10] their father and saying that their
[50:12] brother had died and really selling him
[50:14] out and all that had unfolded. All of
[50:16] that had unfolded. All the forgiveness
[50:18] and all of the repair of the family and
[50:20] all of the welcoming home and the and
[50:22] the reconnecting back. All of that had
[50:24] already passed out now. And that whole
[50:27] generation that was connected to that
[50:28] old story is is perished. and they are
[50:31] in Egypt now. There's a new generation
[50:34] that are not necessarily connected to
[50:36] that story. They know about it, but they
[50:38] didn't live through that. They are in a
[50:40] new day. Uh they are in a new season and
[50:43] and they are in Egypt land and they are
[50:45] prospering. They are not in a land where
[50:48] God wants them to be in, but they are
[50:50] alive and they are found in the grace of
[50:53] God. They are doing well for themselves.
[50:55] Isn't that right? But they are out of
[50:57] touch with God. They are out of touch
[51:00] with the land that God had called them
[51:02] out to walk in. When he had called
[51:04] Abraham out and said, "Walk before me
[51:06] and be thou perfect." They are out of
[51:08] touch with that now. They are in a
[51:10] different place. They are in a big
[51:12] megalopous city with buildings and and
[51:14] cars and streets and praise God. You can
[51:16] dramatize it. Isn't that right? But
[51:19] God's desire is not fulfilled.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Because this is not the place that they
[51:24] are meant to live in. This was just a
[51:28] temporary situation to save the 70 that
[51:31] came out from starvation to save them
[51:34] from a famine. But this is not the
[51:37] intended place that God has for his
[51:40] people. And so God's desire is not
[51:43] fulfilled.
[51:44] God has to now create a situation to get
[51:48] his people out of Egypt and into his
[51:52] desired place that he has for them.
[51:55] Isn't that right? Into a land of
[51:57] possession. He has to bring them out of
[52:00] this foreign land and back to the
[52:02] mountain where they can properly serve
[52:05] God. Where they can finally meet this
[52:08] God that their fathers met, meet this
[52:10] God that their fathers worship, meet
[52:12] this God and talk to this God and
[52:14] understand this God that called them out
[52:17] to be a separate people. They were
[52:19] separate and they didn't know why. They
[52:21] were called out and they didn't know
[52:22] why. They had lost. they would come out
[52:24] of touch with their fathers in the
[52:26] wilderness and God's desire for them was
[52:29] not fulfilled in Egypt. So he had to
[52:31] create a situation to get them out of
[52:34] Egypt.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says here and the children
[52:37] of Israel were fruitful and they
[52:39] increased abundantly and multiplied.
[52:42] Amen. Isn't that right? Mothers giving
[52:44] forth bringing forth children bringing
[52:45] forth children generation after
[52:47] generation. They're doing well now. It's
[52:49] wonderful. It's a time before Trump,
[52:55] you know, everything's real real swell.
[52:58] And uh they waxed exceedingly mighty.
[53:00] The land was filled with them. The Bible
[53:02] says, "And then verse 8, there arose up
[53:07] a new king over Egypt, which knew not
[53:10] Joseph."
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And that's where the trouble started.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he wasn't connected to that
[53:15] story because Egypt was only prosperous
[53:18] because of these people that were now
[53:20] filling up the land. They were the
[53:22] reason why Egypt had prospered. Egypt
[53:24] was sent ahead. Egypt's economy was
[53:27] thriving while other kingdoms were
[53:29] trying to pick up the slack. They were
[53:31] sent miles ahead. They were they had a a
[53:34] land of of milk and honey and this and
[53:36] that. They had everything they could
[53:37] ever ask for, grapes and and wheat and
[53:40] everything was overflowing because they
[53:42] were set in a situation that set them
[53:44] ahead of many other nations who had to
[53:47] survive the famine and had to come out
[53:49] of it and start from scratch. Egypt
[53:51] didn't have to start from scratch
[53:53] because they were blessed by the hands
[53:54] of Joseph. But there rose up a Pharaoh
[53:57] who was not connected to that story.
[53:59] There rose up a Pharaoh who did not
[54:01] appreciate that it was the people of God
[54:03] that put Egypt in that condition. Oh
[54:06] hallelujah. And because of that, oh
[54:08] hallelujah, they began to see things a
[54:09] little differently. They began to treat
[54:11] with them a little differently. Watch
[54:13] what the Bible says here. And they rose
[54:15] up a new king over Egypt that knew not
[54:17] Joseph. And he said unto his people,
[54:19] behold, the people of the children of
[54:21] Israel are more mightier than we. Come
[54:24] on, he said, let us deal wisely with
[54:26] them. Watch that now, man's wisdom. lest
[54:30] they multiply. And it come to pass that
[54:33] when they they fall out any war that
[54:37] they join also with our enemies and
[54:40] fight against us. So let us get them up
[54:43] out of the land. And in verse 11, he
[54:45] said, "Therefore they did set over them
[54:48] task masters to afflict them with their
[54:51] burdens, and they built for Pharaoh
[54:54] treasure cities of Pitham and Ramses."
[54:58] Isn't that right? And the more they
[55:00] afflicted them, but the more they
[55:02] afflicted them, the Bible said, the more
[55:04] they multiplied and the more they grew.
[55:08] Isn't that right? The more the enemy
[55:10] tried to smite them is the more God
[55:12] bless them. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:14] The more God, the enemy tried to smite
[55:16] you is the more God bless you. Oh,
[55:19] hallelujah. Cuz he can't take the
[55:21] blessing off of you. Oh, the devil could
[55:24] watch you, but he can't touch you. Oh,
[55:26] hallelujah. Pray. He tried to take your
[55:28] life, but God keep blessing you. God
[55:31] keep putting a hedge around you. Oh,
[55:33] hallelujah. Because he's got you in his
[55:35] hands and he will not let you go because
[55:38] of who you are. You are blessed tonight
[55:41] and highly favored. God is not going to
[55:44] let anything happen to you that he would
[55:46] not allow. Oh, how you only dwelling in
[55:49] a temporary land. Oh, but even in that
[55:52] land, God promised to bless you. God
[55:55] brought promise your cup would run over.
[55:58] Surely goodness and mercy uh shall
[56:01] follow me uh all the days of my life uh
[56:04] and I will dwell in the house of the
[56:07] Lord and inquire in his temple because
[56:10] in a time of trouble he shall hide me in
[56:14] a pavilion in a secret place he shall
[56:17] hide me and set me up upon a rock. Oh
[56:21] hallelujah. He puts your foot on a rock.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, and establishes your goings.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So the more they afflicted them, the
[56:34] more they multiplied and grew and they
[56:37] were grieved because of the children of
[56:39] Israel. Oh, the blessing made the enemy
[56:42] upset.
[56:44] When you are being blessed by God, the
[56:46] enemy is confused because what's
[56:48] supposed to bring you down is making you
[56:51] smile. What's supposed to destroy you is
[56:54] building you up. What's supposed to
[56:56] depress you is making you happy. What's
[56:58] supposed to take your joy, take your
[57:01] peace, take your praise, you still
[57:04] overflowing. You still have meal in the
[57:06] barrel. You still have oil in the cruise
[57:09] every Wednesday, every Sunday. And the
[57:12] devil is confused as to how and confused
[57:16] as to where. But my help don't come from
[57:19] the hills. My help cometh from the Lord.
[57:23] The Lord which make heaven and earth. He
[57:27] will not suffer thy foot to be moved.
[57:30] The Lord that keepeth thee will not
[57:32] slumber. The Lord that keepeth thee will
[57:34] not sleep. You could afford to sleep
[57:37] tonight. You could afford to close your
[57:39] eyes and get a good night's rest tonight
[57:42] because he is not slumbering nor is he
[57:45] sleeping. But he is watching, watching
[57:49] for your soul, watching for your going
[57:52] out, uh, watching for your coming in
[57:54] from this time forth. Oh, and even
[57:58] forever more, he is watching over his
[58:01] people.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And keeping you from all sin and shame.
[58:06] Do you believe that tonight?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen.
[58:10] So they were grieved because of the
[58:12] children of Israel. And the Egyptians
[58:13] made the children of Israel to serve
[58:15] with rigor. And they made their lives
[58:18] bitter with hard bondage in mortar and
[58:20] in brick and all manner of service in
[58:23] the field
[58:25] all their service wherein they made them
[58:27] serve with rigor. Amen. So this is the
[58:31] the pressure coming down upon them now.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And God is allowing this situation
[58:37] uh because he wants to get them out.
[58:41] The eagle when she's ready to get her
[58:43] eaglets to fly has to create an
[58:46] uncomfortable situation for them all the
[58:49] time. The nest is cushy. It is
[58:51] wonderful. It is padded. It has a
[58:54] tempropedic mattress. Um it has feathers
[58:57] and it has perfume and fbreze air
[59:00] refreshener. But there come a time when
[59:02] we got to get that stuff out because
[59:04] them boys have got to get their own
[59:06] nests, get their own food, fly their own
[59:09] flights. Isn't that right? And they
[59:11] can't stay where they are. So, she start
[59:13] to flap the nest. Isn't that right? The
[59:15] prophet described that that getting that
[59:17] nest sticky is how we get them birds to
[59:19] fly. Oh, honey. Because if we make it
[59:21] too comfortable, they will want to stay
[59:23] there forever. And these children was in
[59:26] e of Israel were in Egypt in a very
[59:28] wonderful cushy comfortable lifestyle
[59:31] with economies and buying cars and
[59:33] buying houses and selling this and
[59:35] buying that and building big business
[59:37] and fast food restaurants and doing this
[59:40] and doing that. And God say enough. I
[59:42] need you out of that place because that
[59:45] is not the place I have for you. Oh, I
[59:47] sworn to your fathers to give you a land
[59:50] flowing with milk and honey. I sworn to
[59:53] your fathers to give you a land of
[59:55] possession. So therefore, I can't have
[59:57] you stay here in the cushy life. I got
[1:00:00] to get you out. I got to make it
[1:00:02] uncomfortable. And so God, allow task
[1:00:05] masters to come upon the children of
[1:00:07] Egypt. And God allow situations in your
[1:00:10] life. God allow evil to happen. God
[1:00:13] allow trials to come. God allow
[1:00:15] situations to come. not allow
[1:00:17] circumstances to come about to get you
[1:00:20] out of your comfort zone, to get you out
[1:00:22] of your relaxation. Oh, you're too at
[1:00:25] ease in Zion. We need the people of God
[1:00:27] to pray. You need to have a reason to go
[1:00:30] on your knees and cry out to God and
[1:00:33] say, "God, have mercy. God, help me.
[1:00:36] God, I'm fumbling. I'm fumbling with my
[1:00:39] finances. I'm fumbling with my family.
[1:00:41] I'm fumbling with my situation. I need
[1:00:44] you."
[1:00:46] God has to create a situation.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Makes it very uncomfortable
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; to dwell in the land of peace.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or ease in Zion. He has to make it
[1:00:58] uh uh like a rock so that you could go
[1:01:00] to crying out on God. That was the whole
[1:01:02] thing because once they go to crying out
[1:01:04] on God, now God could go into action.
[1:01:08] God could not go into action until they
[1:01:10] cry. But they had to have a reason to
[1:01:12] cry. And it was too wonderful in Egypt.
[1:01:15] So let's create a reason.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; There rose up a pharaoh who knew not
[1:01:19] Joseph.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And that's where the trouble started.
[1:01:21] Isn't that right?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. So the king of Egypt
[1:01:25] spoke to the Hebrew midwives which one
[1:01:27] of name was Shippra, the next name was
[1:01:28] Pua. And he said unto them, when you do
[1:01:31] the office of a midwife, listen to this.
[1:01:33] To the Hebrew women and see them upon
[1:01:36] the stools. He's telling his
[1:01:37] instructions to these midwives, these
[1:01:39] two midwives that are identified in the
[1:01:40] scripture.
[1:01:42] And it's such a lovely sub story. We'll
[1:01:44] just talk on this for a little bit. If
[1:01:47] it be a son, he said, then ye shall kill
[1:01:50] him. But if it be a daughter, then she
[1:01:52] shall live. So they have specific
[1:01:54] instructions that if the Hebrew mothers
[1:01:57] bring forth a boy, that boy is to be
[1:01:59] killed. And if those Hebrew mothers
[1:02:01] bring forth a girl, let that girl live.
[1:02:04] And the whole idea was to de uh I guess
[1:02:10] remove the strength of the people
[1:02:12] because the strength would be in the
[1:02:13] sons to go to war and to work and to and
[1:02:16] to and to labor and so forth like that.
[1:02:18] Isn't that right? So they're trying to
[1:02:19] break the backbone of the society of the
[1:02:22] Hebrews uh uh by letting their their
[1:02:25] their women outnumber the men. Isn't
[1:02:27] that right? That that's the strategy
[1:02:29] they're trying to do. But the Bible said
[1:02:31] here in verse 17, the midwives feared
[1:02:34] God. And they did not as the king of
[1:02:37] Egypt commanded,
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; but save the men and children alive. And
[1:02:42] the king of Egypt called for the
[1:02:44] midwives. And he asked them, he said,
[1:02:46] "Why have you done this thing, and have
[1:02:47] saved the men and children men alive?"
[1:02:50] And the midwives said unto Pharaoh,
[1:02:52] "Because the Hebrew women are not as the
[1:02:54] Egyptian women, for they are lively, and
[1:02:58] are delivered air. the midwives coming
[1:03:00] in unto them. And the Bible said here
[1:03:03] now God dwelt with the well with the
[1:03:06] midwives and the people multiplied and
[1:03:09] waxed very mighty. It was the will of
[1:03:11] God upon these two midwives here in
[1:03:14] scripture that they let these men live.
[1:03:16] Amen. Isn't there let the children live
[1:03:18] and so on and multiply because they were
[1:03:20] the ones to see about it. Pharaoh wasn't
[1:03:22] looking at every child that was born. He
[1:03:24] put these two women in charge. But God
[1:03:26] inspired these women to still let these
[1:03:28] men children live. Isn't that right? And
[1:03:31] God dwelt well with the midwives. And
[1:03:33] the people multiplied and waxed very
[1:03:34] mighty. And the Bible said, "It came to
[1:03:36] pass because the midwives fear God that
[1:03:39] he made them houses."
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And here is our here's the shout in the
[1:03:44] text
[1:03:46] that just because you're living under an
[1:03:48] evil regime doesn't mean you have to be
[1:03:51] evil, too.
[1:03:52] Just because you're living under tyrant
[1:03:55] regime or living in a regime where evil
[1:03:58] is being administered does not give you
[1:04:00] an excuse. These two he uh Egyptian
[1:04:04] women did something remarkable in
[1:04:06] scripture. They stood for God. They were
[1:04:09] inspired by God in spite of the regime
[1:04:13] that they were living under. They were
[1:04:15] living under a tyrants. Oh, who wanted
[1:04:17] to kill and destroy. But they saw the
[1:04:20] purpose of God and put the purpose of
[1:04:22] God above the tyrants. They put the
[1:04:25] purpose of God above this dictator above
[1:04:28] this administrator. And whenever you are
[1:04:31] inspired of God, oh to do the will of
[1:04:34] God and you put that above man. God will
[1:04:38] bless you. God will make a way for you.
[1:04:42] God will see you true
[1:04:44] because you put God's word
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; above every other man's word. Let every
[1:04:50] man's word be a lie.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Let God's word be true.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; If you're a police officer and you're in
[1:04:58] the police service and the police
[1:05:00] service is corrupt, that does not give
[1:05:02] you an excuse to be corrupt like them.
[1:05:05] If you know better, you should do
[1:05:08] better. If you're in a job and the job
[1:05:10] is corrupt and they're teifing and
[1:05:11] they're lying and they telling this and
[1:05:12] they doing that, it doesn't give you an
[1:05:14] excuse to do differently. You know the
[1:05:17] Bible, you know what it stands for, you
[1:05:20] know the word, you will be judged by
[1:05:22] this, not what your employer does, not
[1:05:25] what your ruler does, not what some man
[1:05:27] does or what some woman does. You are
[1:05:29] going to be judged by this. So let this
[1:05:32] be your guide. Let this be your
[1:05:34] benchmark. Let this be your measuring
[1:05:36] stick. Let this be your absolutes. Let
[1:05:39] this be the code that you live by. And
[1:05:42] God will bless your actions. Oh,
[1:05:45] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Some people do things a certain way.
[1:05:56] Say, "Well, my boss did it like that, so
[1:05:58] that's how I do it."
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That sounds okay. That sounds reasonable
[1:06:02] on this level. But go explain that to
[1:06:05] God.
[1:06:06] Go tell God that same story and see if
[1:06:08] it ring in the same way. You understand
[1:06:10] what I'm saying? You're going to be
[1:06:12] judged by this. If you know that
[1:06:14] forgiveness, the Bible teaches
[1:06:16] forgiveness and you don't do it, then
[1:06:17] you'll be held responsible for the
[1:06:19] things that you know and don't do.
[1:06:21] Praise God. Isn't that right? You know
[1:06:23] better. Praise God. Hallelu. So, don't
[1:06:25] let anybody sway you.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; I love this this this story because
[1:06:29] these two midwives were real pioneers.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were uh willing to do uh
[1:06:36] right in spite of wrong. Amen. And so
[1:06:39] God blessed them. Bible said God blessed
[1:06:41] them. Give them houses. Amen. Give them
[1:06:43] a place to dwell in. My my He made a way
[1:06:46] for them. And God will make a way for
[1:06:49] you when you do right. God will make a
[1:06:51] way for you when you choose right in
[1:06:53] spite of the circumstance. Choose right
[1:06:55] in spite of the situations. Choose right
[1:06:57] in spite of every example that you see
[1:06:59] in front of you. Let Christ be your
[1:07:02] example. Amen. is not right. Let
[1:07:04] forgiveness be example. Amen. Love, joy,
[1:07:07] peace, longsuffering.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let that be your your guidance and
[1:07:12] teach it. Let it show you how to treat
[1:07:14] with not just yourself but with others.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; So that you could live Christ to them
[1:07:19] cuz that's the whole purpose. Isn't that
[1:07:20] right? Amen. Amen. Okay, that's little
[1:07:22] point there I want to bring out. All
[1:07:24] right. The 11 tonight. Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Said so so so the people of Egypt
[1:07:30] are in bondage now. So the situation has
[1:07:32] changed. They're no longer in this
[1:07:33] blessed place. They're now in bondage.
[1:07:35] And God changes the season on them. And
[1:07:38] now someone might say, well, why would
[1:07:39] God allow God's people to come under
[1:07:41] such hardship? He can't deliver them.
[1:07:44] The public the reason is he can't
[1:07:46] deliver them until they needed
[1:07:47] deliverance. Isn't that he can't bless
[1:07:50] them until they they needed a blessing.
[1:07:52] They can't he can't answer their cry
[1:07:54] until they cry for something. And so God
[1:07:57] had to send his promised deliverance
[1:07:59] pray because there was a need for
[1:08:01] deliverance. Isn't that right? He had to
[1:08:03] send his promise that he made to their
[1:08:05] father Abraham. Isn't that right? Glory
[1:08:07] to God that he would bring him into our
[1:08:08] own land, a land of possession and so
[1:08:10] forth. Isn't that right? And now God
[1:08:12] sends his deliverance by way of Moses.
[1:08:15] Amen. And we know the story. Isn't that
[1:08:16] right? Moses went down to Pharaoh said,
[1:08:19] "I have a message not from any man, but
[1:08:22] from the I am that I am." He had a
[1:08:25] message for Pharaoh. You have held my
[1:08:28] people captive long enough, but the hour
[1:08:31] of God's deliverance is come. Oh, let my
[1:08:34] people go. And as the Bible said, he
[1:08:37] said, "Let my son go." This was God's
[1:08:39] words. "Let my son go that they may
[1:08:41] serve me in the desert." Isn't that
[1:08:43] right? But if you do not let my son go,
[1:08:45] then I will kill your son. Isn't that
[1:08:47] right? Hallelujah. And when God ready,
[1:08:49] when God was ready, he caused an
[1:08:51] attraction on the mountain. It all
[1:08:53] started on a mountain tonight. And Moses
[1:08:56] said, "I will turn aside to see what is
[1:08:58] this attraction that is on the
[1:09:00] mountain." And when Moses made that
[1:09:02] decision, God's plan of deliverance
[1:09:05] begin to unfold right there. Isn't that
[1:09:08] right? God was getting ready to enforce
[1:09:10] his deliverance for his people tonight.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And the prophet
[1:09:15] said here on restoration of the bright
[1:09:16] tree, he said, "Enforce." He said, "Then
[1:09:18] we have the privilege tonight to enforce
[1:09:22] upon Satan the claims that God will give
[1:09:25] us. For God has a law and his word is
[1:09:29] law." And God in his word made certain
[1:09:32] claims for the church. Therefore, we
[1:09:35] have a right tonight to force these
[1:09:37] claims upon Satan and say, "Give it
[1:09:40] back." And he has to do it. Oh,
[1:09:44] hallelujah. Hallel joy belongs to you.
[1:09:46] Peace belongs to you. You deserve to
[1:09:48] have your own land, a land of blessing,
[1:09:51] a land of prosperity. You can ask for
[1:09:54] your inheritance tonight. He said, "Give
[1:09:56] it back." And he has to do it because we
[1:10:00] take God's agent, the Holy Spirit, and
[1:10:02] go right to our knees. The prophet said,
[1:10:05] and we say, "It's thus sayeth the Lord."
[1:10:08] And the prophet said, "The devil has got
[1:10:09] to give it up." That is because the Holy
[1:10:12] Spirit is there to make him do it. Oh,
[1:10:16] who is the Holy Spirit? The enforcer. He
[1:10:18] is there to make sure to enforce your
[1:10:21] claim. If you want deliverance, lift up
[1:10:23] your hands and claim deliverance. The
[1:10:26] people of Israel begin to claim their
[1:10:27] deliverance. Oh, they said, "God, you
[1:10:30] promise a deliverer. Where is our
[1:10:32] deliverance?" And when God heard the
[1:10:34] cries of his people, he knew he had to
[1:10:37] send an enforcer to get his people out
[1:10:40] of Egypt. And that's what the burning
[1:10:43] bush was all about. It was God's
[1:10:45] enforcer. It was God's angel in the form
[1:10:48] of a fire to go down and tell those
[1:10:52] people, "Let my people go." He went down
[1:10:55] to Egypt land. And I don't care what
[1:10:57] devil you are facing tonight. I don't
[1:10:59] care what demon, what darkness, what
[1:11:01] confusion in your mind. The enforcers on
[1:11:04] the air tonight. The Lord himself
[1:11:06] descended on earth with a shout, with a
[1:11:09] voice of the archangel. Isn't that
[1:11:10] right? He come down with a pillar of
[1:11:13] cloud, rainbow upon his head, his feet
[1:11:16] as it were, pillars of fire, one foot
[1:11:18] upon the earth, one foot upon the sea.
[1:11:20] The enforcer has already come down. Uh,
[1:11:23] according to Revelation 10, uh, that
[1:11:25] angel is on the earth. Uh, the prophet
[1:11:27] is no longer here, but the enforcer is
[1:11:30] here tonight. And we have a right
[1:11:32] tonight, oh, to claim any scripture
[1:11:35] tonight and enforce the the law of God
[1:11:38] upon the devil tonight. If you want the
[1:11:41] Holy Ghost, God can enforce that power
[1:11:43] tonight. God can enforce that claim
[1:11:45] tonight. If you want deliverance, God
[1:11:48] can enforce it tonight. If you need
[1:11:50] healing, God can enforce it tonight. If
[1:11:52] you need salvation, he can enforce it
[1:11:55] tonight. He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:11:58] and forever. And his power is here
[1:12:00] tonight. His pillar of fire is here
[1:12:03] tonight on the earth moving things
[1:12:06] around enforcing his law, enforcing a
[1:12:10] time of deliverance upon the people of
[1:12:12] God.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Isn't that right? You
[1:12:16] believe it?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. At that time, Michael shall stand
[1:12:19] up everyone that is found written in the
[1:12:22] Lamb's book of life and my people shall
[1:12:24] be delivered. God in the form of an
[1:12:26] angel to make sure you get delivered.
[1:12:29] Now make sure your family get delivered.
[1:12:31] Make sure your household gets delivered.
[1:12:33] Claim that promise tonight. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:36] Says uh he has to give it up. Isn't that
[1:12:38] right? The law of the land is to
[1:12:39] enforce. It's by the law the land is by
[1:12:42] the land for the land. Prophet said and
[1:12:44] by the law the spirit of God is to force
[1:12:46] Satan to give up that which he has
[1:12:47] unrightfully deceitfully taken from God.
[1:12:50] Souls of men that he took from God,
[1:12:52] souls of women, sickness and so forth in
[1:12:54] the body he placed upon people. Praise
[1:12:56] God. Amen. And the church is given the
[1:12:57] rightful legal rights by the Bible to
[1:13:00] take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[1:13:02] upon him. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:05] Hallelujah. And so the enforcer came
[1:13:08] down. So you know the story. Moses went
[1:13:10] out there with a message to Pharaoh. Let
[1:13:12] my people go. Amen. Of course, it wasn't
[1:13:16] easy. It was a journey. Praise God.
[1:13:18] Hallelujah. He came, he kept coming
[1:13:20] back. Plague after plague. Let my people
[1:13:23] go that they may serve me. But Pharaoh
[1:13:26] hardened his heart against Moses. And
[1:13:28] God drop another plague on them and
[1:13:30] another plague and another plague. And
[1:13:33] Moses come again and said, "Pharaoh, be
[1:13:35] reasonable. God is not going to let it
[1:13:37] off easy. He wants his people out. You
[1:13:40] have to let them go." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo
[1:13:44] Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo
[1:13:44] Mo Mo Mo Phara uh Moses and and they
[1:13:47] grew up together. But this was no play
[1:13:49] talk. This was a war talk. Praise God.
[1:13:52] This was h
[1:13:54] negotiation happening. Praise God. And
[1:13:56] God was not about to negotiate. Amen. He
[1:13:58] wanted his people out of there. Praise
[1:14:00] God.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses was only a spokesperson
[1:14:03] telling Pharaoh, "Be reasonable." Praise
[1:14:05] God. But he didn't want to hear it. And
[1:14:07] God knew that. See, told Moses, he said,
[1:14:09] "I'll harden Pharaoh's heart against
[1:14:10] them." But to get them out, he wanted to
[1:14:13] prove himself. Praise God. But how Egypt
[1:14:16] had risen risen up in pride and
[1:14:17] arrogance thinking that they were the
[1:14:19] ones that blessed themselves not
[1:14:21] regarding the story of how they even got
[1:14:23] blessed in the first place. Disregarding
[1:14:25] the hand of God in their lives that
[1:14:27] brought them to the point that they are
[1:14:28] at now.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; They forgot all about that. They they
[1:14:31] they got puffed up in themselves and
[1:14:34] thought themselves to be a great nation.
[1:14:36] And that was their great downfall. And
[1:14:39] God brought them down. The same God that
[1:14:41] raised them up is the same God that
[1:14:43] brought them down. He raised up kings
[1:14:46] and he bringeth down kingdoms for his
[1:14:49] name's sake and for his word. You better
[1:14:52] line up with the word. Don't you line up
[1:14:54] with a kingdom. Don't you line up with
[1:14:56] some king somewhere. You line up with
[1:14:58] the word of God because heaven and earth
[1:15:00] will pass away but my word shall never
[1:15:03] pass away.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; His word is what will stand.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what what happens. Praise
[1:15:10] God. Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So, this is the place where God wants to
[1:15:14] meet you. Let's head to Texas and get
[1:15:16] out of here. Amen. Bring the people back
[1:15:18] to this mountain that they may serve me
[1:15:21] upon this mountain. That was God's
[1:15:23] words. And there's a place where God
[1:15:25] wants to meet you. Isn't that right? He
[1:15:26] told Moses, he brought the people out of
[1:15:28] Egypt to serve God upon this mountain.
[1:15:32] God wants his people to love him. Isn't
[1:15:34] that right? He wants his people to serve
[1:15:36] him. But you've got to make the journey
[1:15:39] up the mountain to meet with God. God is
[1:15:42] not going to stay down there where you
[1:15:43] are tonight. You have to go up where he
[1:15:46] is in order to meet with him. Isn't that
[1:15:49] right? God's desire is to bring you
[1:15:52] back. Back to the Bible, back to your
[1:15:56] inheritance, back to true worship, back
[1:15:58] to true sunship, back to sanctification,
[1:16:02] back to uh Amen. justification. Is that
[1:16:04] right? Back to holy living, back to the
[1:16:06] Bible. Isn't that right?
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Prophet said on the father, he always
[1:16:10] come. He said the time has come for the
[1:16:12] signs to follow the believers. He said
[1:16:15] we are at the end time. We are in the
[1:16:18] latter rain. We are at the time when men
[1:16:21] will be heavy and high-minded. Lovers of
[1:16:24] pleasures more than lovers of God. Truce
[1:16:26] breakers, false accusers, incontinent
[1:16:30] and despised of those that are good,
[1:16:32] heady, and high-minded. The prophet
[1:16:34] said, "The time has come when they are
[1:16:37] teaching doctrines of devils, perverting
[1:16:40] the Bible, teaching into theories and
[1:16:42] theologies to draw groups of people away
[1:16:45] to them. But the time has come that God
[1:16:49] will gather his church together soon
[1:16:52] under one great banner of the Lord
[1:16:54] Jesus, and he begin to pour out his
[1:16:57] powers among them, and great signs and
[1:17:01] wonders will take place." The prophet
[1:17:04] said, "The time has come." He said, "The
[1:17:06] time has come for the Pentecostal church
[1:17:09] to make his stand." He said, "The time
[1:17:11] has come to circumcise the church and
[1:17:14] call off this foolishness." He said,
[1:17:16] "The time has come to go back to the old
[1:17:19] landmark." Oh, the time has come, he
[1:17:22] says, for the outpouring. The time has
[1:17:25] come for the gathering of the people.
[1:17:27] The time has come for Jesus to come. the
[1:17:30] time will be here soon to give out the
[1:17:33] rewards. He says, "Brother, be careful
[1:17:36] that your crown isn't set on someone
[1:17:38] else's head." He said, "Because the time
[1:17:41] is come," he said, "and we're at the end
[1:17:43] time. If we're ever going to do
[1:17:44] anything, brethren, we're going to do it
[1:17:47] now. Because the time is at hand." Amen.
[1:17:50] Isn't that right? Oh my. Psalms 24 says,
[1:17:53] "The earth is the Lord and the fullness
[1:17:55] thereof, the world that dwell therein."
[1:17:58] Verse three says, "Who shall ascend into
[1:18:01] the hill of the Lord?" Talking about
[1:18:03] that mountain, isn't that right? Or who
[1:18:04] shall stand in his holy place? This is a
[1:18:07] condition. He that had clean hands and a
[1:18:11] pure heart, who had not lifted up his
[1:18:13] soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully,
[1:18:17] he shall receive a blessing from the
[1:18:20] Lord, and righteousness from the God of
[1:18:23] his salvation. Oh, this is the
[1:18:26] generation of them that seek him, of
[1:18:29] them that seek thy face, oh Jacob. Lift
[1:18:32] up your heads, O gates, and be lift up.
[1:18:35] He everlasting doors, and the King of
[1:18:38] glory shall come in. Who is this king of
[1:18:41] glory, the Lord strong and mighty, the
[1:18:45] Lord mighty in battle? Lift up your
[1:18:47] heads, O ye gates, and be and even lift
[1:18:50] them up everlasting doors and the King
[1:18:53] of glory shall come in. Who is this king
[1:18:56] of glory? The Lord of hosts. He is the
[1:19:00] King of glory tonight. Isn't that right?
[1:19:02] Oh, hallelujah. God met Abraham upon the
[1:19:05] mountain and God told Abraham after he
[1:19:07] had waited for a son for 25 long years,
[1:19:11] God told Abraham, "Offer that son up to
[1:19:13] me." Oh, and it was a test of obedience.
[1:19:15] Isn't that right? But in order to God
[1:19:17] obey God's command, he had to take a
[1:19:20] long journey up the mountain because
[1:19:23] that's where he had to meet God. Oh,
[1:19:25] hallelujah. He told his men, I and the
[1:19:27] lad go up and I and the lad come back
[1:19:29] down. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] Hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, he went up there and while he was
[1:19:37] making his journey up, God was making
[1:19:39] his journey up also. They was going to
[1:19:42] meet on behalf. Oh, h but you've got to
[1:19:44] press your way. There's something you've
[1:19:46] got to do tonight. Just as God called
[1:19:49] his people, Israel, out of a land of
[1:19:51] bondage, into a land of possession, he
[1:19:54] brought them back to the mountain, back
[1:19:56] to the typost, back to the absolutes,
[1:19:58] back to the shortity of God's word, back
[1:20:01] to his commandments, back to his love,
[1:20:03] back to his peace, to walk after God, to
[1:20:06] be free to worship, to be free to praise
[1:20:09] God. Oh, we've got to make the journey
[1:20:11] tonight. We've got to come out of Egypt.
[1:20:14] We've got to come out of confusion.
[1:20:15] We've got to come out of where we are.
[1:20:17] Come out of bondage and walk before God
[1:20:20] and be perfect and meet God upon that
[1:20:24] mountain. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:28] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Oh, glory,
[1:20:31] glory, glory, glory, glory. You've got
[1:20:32] to be convinced tonight about your
[1:20:35] mountain. God wants to meet you there.
[1:20:38] You have to have a desire to meet your
[1:20:41] Lord. My God. Oh, he said, "And now,
[1:20:43] behold, the Lord had kept me alive as he
[1:20:46] had said these 40 and 5 years since the
[1:20:49] Lord spake the word unto Moses." Oh,
[1:20:52] hallelujah. Now I am this day, four
[1:20:54] score and 5 years old. And I am just as
[1:20:57] strong this day as I was in the day that
[1:21:00] Moses sent me. My strength is then, so
[1:21:04] is my strength now for war to go out and
[1:21:07] to come in. Verse 12, now therefore give
[1:21:10] me this mountain. And he says, "Whereof
[1:21:13] the Lord spake in that day? For thou
[1:21:15] heard that the Anakims were there, and
[1:21:17] the cities were great and fenced." And
[1:21:19] he said, "If so beh the Lord be with me,
[1:21:23] then I shall be able to drive them out
[1:21:27] as the Lord had said, God's going to
[1:21:29] give you power tonight to drive out the
[1:21:32] inhabitants of the land because that
[1:21:34] mountain belongs to you tonight. Who art
[1:21:37] thou, oh great mountain before
[1:21:38] Zerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain uh
[1:21:41] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:21:44] which shouts crying grace grace grace
[1:21:48] unto it. There is a mountain tonight
[1:21:51] that we have to possess. There is a
[1:21:54] mountain that God is bringing us back
[1:21:56] to. Uh he's bringing us out of doubt,
[1:21:58] bringing us out of fear, bringing us out
[1:22:00] of confusion. Everything the devil tried
[1:22:03] to do to you is going to fail. It's
[1:22:05] going to fall. The kingdom of heaven
[1:22:08] hell is crushed tonight. Oh, the kingdom
[1:22:10] of heaven is at hand. Oh, let's go on to
[1:22:14] possess our individual inheritance.
[1:22:17] Let's go on. Let's get out of here. Hey,
[1:22:19] get out of Egypt. Praise God. And
[1:22:21] possess our mountain tonight.
[1:22:24] Oh, to meet God up there. Hallelujah.
[1:22:26] Isn't that right? And we know that that
[1:22:28] scripture says Jesus is the chief
[1:22:30] cornerstone. He's also the headstone.
[1:22:32] And we're getting ready to ring up here
[1:22:33] now. And if we think for a few minutes,
[1:22:35] you think that the he said that the
[1:22:37] seven church messenger was to restore
[1:22:39] the faith of the children back to the
[1:22:41] fathers. In other words, he said,
[1:22:43] "Rebuild the church again under the
[1:22:46] power of the spirit." Oh, not by power,
[1:22:50] not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth
[1:22:53] the Lord. Not by an organization, not by
[1:22:56] a denomination, but by the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:59] God is going to bring forth the church
[1:23:01] in the last day. Oh, so God is going to
[1:23:04] release his Holy Spirit one of these old
[1:23:07] days. What's the purpose? To rebuild the
[1:23:09] pyramid. What's the purpose? To come
[1:23:11] back to the mountain. Oh, we've been
[1:23:14] journeying for all these years. We've
[1:23:16] been going through this and through
[1:23:17] that, but the time has come to turn
[1:23:19] northward tonight. Let's go on to
[1:23:22] possess. Let's go on to what we know is
[1:23:24] our own tonight and get back to the
[1:23:27] mountain.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] Isn't that right? God wants to meet us.
[1:23:32] Praise God. In a special place, a place
[1:23:35] of worship tonight. Isn't that right?
[1:23:36] That's the way the body of Christ should
[1:23:38] be. So cut by the Holy Spirit by God's
[1:23:41] great instrument and tool that we be
[1:23:42] joined as one person. He said we're not
[1:23:45] divided. We should not be we should be
[1:23:47] one person. He says, and it goes to show
[1:23:49] that no machinery can do that that way.
[1:23:51] It take God to do that. No mechanics of
[1:23:54] organization, no lodges, none of these
[1:23:56] things could ever do it. As good as
[1:23:58] their intentions are, they could never
[1:24:00] do it because that it takes God to do
[1:24:02] this. The Holy Spirit. Amen. Isn't that
[1:24:05] right? Oh, praise God. Musician can get
[1:24:07] ready to come. All that God was, he
[1:24:10] poured into Christ. All that Jesus was,
[1:24:12] he pours into the church. God wanting
[1:24:15] his work done, he sent it into his son.
[1:24:18] And the son wanting the work done, he
[1:24:20] sent it into the church to continue to
[1:24:22] work. Isn't that right? He said, "And
[1:24:24] that day you shall know I am in the
[1:24:25] Father, the Father in me, and I in you
[1:24:27] and you in me." He said, "And at that
[1:24:29] day, because the same power of God was
[1:24:31] in Jehovah, God rested in Jesus Christ."
[1:24:34] He said, "And the same power, praise
[1:24:36] God, that rested in Jesus Christ, rest
[1:24:39] in the place sons on the body of
[1:24:41] Christ." Isn't that right? He said,
[1:24:42] "Place him of a son. Take him out to a
[1:24:45] certain place. Have a ceremony before
[1:24:48] angels. Place him positionally what he
[1:24:51] is in the body of Christ. And then that
[1:24:53] person has the authority." And the
[1:24:56] prophet said, "Let me say this. If you
[1:24:58] count me a fanatic from this night on,"
[1:25:00] he said, that very same thing that I'm
[1:25:02] speaking of will be done. He said
[1:25:06] there'll be a power put into the church
[1:25:10] and now is coming in that the Holy
[1:25:12] Spirit will so anoint the people until
[1:25:15] they speak the word and it'll create
[1:25:18] itself right there. He said we haven't
[1:25:20] seen powers like it's coming into the
[1:25:22] church now. He said I know it for a
[1:25:24] fact. Oh, he said to this mountain be
[1:25:27] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:25:30] believe that what you've said shall come
[1:25:32] to pass. you can have what you said. He
[1:25:35] said the placing of the church in
[1:25:37] position where the fullness of the power
[1:25:39] of the Holy Ghost comes into the church.
[1:25:42] He said, "And then the critics's mouths
[1:25:44] will be shut." He said, "It'll be a
[1:25:46] short time. Jesus come right off the
[1:25:48] mountain and went straight to CH
[1:25:50] Calvary." Notice it won't last long, but
[1:25:53] it will be here. Amen. Many men. Praise
[1:25:58] God. And then the prophet said, "I'm the
[1:25:59] only building. The hour is close at hand
[1:26:01] when you're going to see something
[1:26:03] happen. When something is going to take
[1:26:05] place and all of this background here
[1:26:08] has only been laying a foundation for a
[1:26:10] short quick message that will shake the
[1:26:13] whole nation. Isn't that right? Amen and
[1:26:16] amen. Praise God. Amen. Last quote and
[1:26:18] I'm finished. Prophet said, "Now we know
[1:26:20] that Christianity has been growing in
[1:26:22] the grace of God through the years." You
[1:26:23] could play something softly. Martin
[1:26:25] Luther was the first reformer of the
[1:26:26] dark age and he preached justification
[1:26:28] by faith. How many knows that? And then
[1:26:30] the church was like like a pyramid. It
[1:26:32] was down there. Great. Anybody ever seen
[1:26:35] uh professor to be a Christian? Uh it
[1:26:37] was dangerous of being killed. See, if
[1:26:39] anybody has ever been in Egypt, he said
[1:26:41] those stones are so closely fit together
[1:26:43] till you can't place a razor between
[1:26:45] them. That's where the mystery. How do
[1:26:47] they get them up there? He said they fit
[1:26:48] perfect. And now the headstone, it'll
[1:26:51] have to be stones that's made up here at
[1:26:53] the top ready for the headstone. It'll
[1:26:56] have to be so honed perfectly until when
[1:26:59] it comes it'll have to fit just exactly
[1:27:01] with it to make that building complete.
[1:27:04] Is that right? And so the church, he
[1:27:05] said, now if the headstone come in
[1:27:07] Luther's time, it would have been an
[1:27:08] outway place. It would have been. And he
[1:27:11] said, look, if it come in Wesley's time,
[1:27:13] it would have been outway. Isn't that
[1:27:14] right? It's God. He said, it will come
[1:27:15] in its own predestinated time all the
[1:27:18] way at the top. See, but the church will
[1:27:20] be honed in such a condition until the
[1:27:22] church's ministry will be so close.
[1:27:24] Listen to this. And be just exactly the
[1:27:27] same kind of a ministry. Oh. Huh. That's
[1:27:30] what he's calling us back to. For the
[1:27:32] church to be just exactly the same kind
[1:27:34] of a ministry that Jesus had to make it
[1:27:37] all fit together for the rapture. He
[1:27:40] said like the head knows more than the
[1:27:42] feet. See, the eyes are more used than
[1:27:44] the feet. The eyes is a profit of the
[1:27:46] church for it foresees. See, and all
[1:27:48] these things come in the head in the
[1:27:50] head part. He said, "But now I believe
[1:27:52] that there's a church coming into that
[1:27:55] perfection, that ministry of perfection
[1:27:58] where the offices where apostles and
[1:28:00] prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists
[1:28:03] for the perfecting of the church, you
[1:28:05] begin to stand them pastors, teachers,
[1:28:06] and so forth will be so with the word
[1:28:10] until the whole thing will work right up
[1:28:11] into the coming of the Lord." He said,
[1:28:13] "I believe that, and I believe that
[1:28:14] we're nearing that time now. I believe
[1:28:16] it is so. May the Lord bless you. I'm
[1:28:19] finished tonight. Oh, let us go on to
[1:28:22] perfection. Oh, hallelujah. Let us come
[1:28:25] out of Egypt. Oh, hallelujah. And back
[1:28:27] to that mountain. Back to the Bible.
[1:28:30] Back to where God is calling us to. Back
[1:28:32] to our inheritance tonight. May the Lord
[1:28:35] richly bless you. Praise God. Oh,
[1:28:38] hallelujah. Thank you. Let's just praise
[1:28:39] him. Lift your hands and worship him
[1:28:42] tonight. Oh, hallelujah. Give him glory.
[1:28:44] Give him praise. Please give him honor.
[1:28:47] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:28:50] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you
[1:28:52] father. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:56] Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. As brother
[1:29:00] Steven comes and sing you out. God rich
[1:29:02] you. Bless you. Oh hallelujah.
[1:29:05] He will make a way.
[1:29:08] God will. Oh God will make a way. Oh,
[1:29:14] God will God will make a way.
[1:29:19] Oh, hallelujah. God bless.
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:25] He works and ways.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, he cannot see.
[1:29:32] He will make a way for me.
[1:29:37] He will be my guide.
[1:29:41] Hold me closely too
[1:29:45] with love and strength.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; For each new day,
[1:29:53] he will make a way.
[1:29:58] God will make a way. Sing it tonight.
[1:30:03] Oh, God will make you believe that
[1:30:05] tonight. Yes, Lord Jesus. where there
[1:30:08] seems.
[1:30:10] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, he works in ways we
[1:30:16] cannot see.
[1:30:19] He will make a
[1:30:23] He will be.
[1:30:26] Hallelujah.
[1:30:27] Oh yes. Hold me closely to his side.
[1:30:34] Oh Lord. Oh Lord.
[1:30:39] Oh, I'll go with him.
[1:30:43] With him
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] all
[1:30:48] the way.
[1:30:51] Where he leads tonight. Sing where he
[1:30:54] leads.
[1:30:57] Mia. Oh, he's leading up the mountain
[1:30:59] tonight. Oh yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] Oh, where he leads
[1:31:09] me, I
[1:31:12] will follow.
[1:31:16] Oh, where he leads
[1:31:20] me. I
[1:31:23] will follow.
[1:31:26] Yes, Lord. Oh, I'll go with him.
[1:31:32] with him
[1:31:35] all
[1:31:37] the way.
[1:31:40] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Give the Lord a
[1:31:42] hand of praise tonight. Thank you,
[1:31:44] Father. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
