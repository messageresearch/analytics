moved because I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is able tonight oh he is able to heal he is able to deliver he is able to restore he is able to baptize you with the Holy Holy Ghost and Fire when you are not able he is able oh when you can't do it when you run out of strength when you are weak that's when he is strong his strength is made perfect in your weakness oh hallelujah oh somebody give the Lord a shout of praise tonight oh hallelujah oh we are beli unto God tonight God told the prophet if you could just get the people to believe not try to figure it out not try to work it out uh but believe get the people to believe when you pray not even cancer will stand in your way oh hallelujah hallelujah oh God is able God is able he is able oh Hallelujah I'm so glad tonight oh that somebody tonight is able somebody tonight is worthy to take the book and to loose the seals who is able to take the book oh but I saw one oh Hallelujah coming out praise God a lamb bleeding and bloody he was bleeding he was he was sacrifice but he was that one who was able and he is that one who is able tonight oh he always was he always will be oh no matter what the circumstance he is able to heal isn't that right he is able to make a way out of no way he is able why because he is above everything oh he's above time he's above your human elements he's above your situation he's above your circumstance he said my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts get up tonight rise up in faith and believe on the god of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob uh the god that spoke and said let there be that God is here tonight he's here to meet your need uh he's here to set the captive free uh he's here to break the band of wickedness the bands of evil there is a God tonight who is able oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah he's above matter he's above time he's above space he holds time in his hand oh in his hand all the Deep places of the earth oh Hallelujah all the mountains all the hills the Earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof oh there's nothing he can't do tonight put your confidence in the god that is able oh you can laugh in the face of Satan tonight because our God is able oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah oh I feel good in my soul I'm not going to do it on my own but I know somebody who can oh he's already got the Victory and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world tonight amen and amen oh I feel him I feel him I feel [Applause] him he is able tonight he is [Music] able he he he can he can actually do it I need you to believe tonight that he is capable of doing what he said regardless of how it look regardless of how the devil make it look he is still able able to do it man run on for a long time with his own abilities but when he run out of abilities hallu God is just getting started and able what is abble mean it speaks to Ability the abilities isn't that right and abilities are attributes likenesses characteristics it is the power to perform or to do something that's what an ability is isn't that right Genesis 1:6 on God said let us make man Hallelujah in our image and after our likeness after our own abilities hallu the same power that God had he gave it to man and said let that man have dominion over the power of the air over the fowls of the air isn't that right over the fish in the sea and over everything that creepeth upon the Earth the abilities that man possessed that man that God created it come from God it was God's ability in man that gave man the ability oh Hallelujah to be like a God on the earth and when he walked on the earth he walked in Dominion when he walked on the earth he walked in Triumph when he walked on the earth he walked in Victory he was not a defeated man but he was a man positionally placed by God and made in the likeness of God with the very abilities of God whatever the animal name that he Nam was a name thereof he could speak to the trees he could speak to the fowls he could speak to the beasts of the field and they had to obey because here was a being walking on the earth that was unlike any other being at that time because God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness therefore that man had the ability to walk like God to talk like God to live like God to reflect God on the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Glory isn't that right tonight amen and amen glory to God hallelujah amen oh my the ability so why do we need God to be able why do we need him Hallelujah to be able we need him to be able because we had a problem after that after God placed man in the Garden of Eden amen and gave him all these abilities that same man fell from his state of power from his state of Glory from his positional place that he was at when God placed him Hallelujah he fell from that place and because he fell from that place he no longer possessed the ability to do the things that he could have done he was now Running Scared whereas before in the Garden of Eden he he had power over everything now he was brought low into a position where he didn't have power over anything he had to run from his life he had to run from the lions run from the Tigers run from the Bears imagine that a man who God placed in power and plac in position is now running and when the presence of God dropped down in the Garden of Eden when the weight of his glory came down that man got scared and actually ran from the presence of God oh Hal isn't that right he ran out of sight he was so out of sight until God had to cry out and say Adam Adam Where Art Thou why are you hiding who told you you are naked where are all those abilities that I put inside of you oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right he come into a lowly State isn't that right so we need God to be able because mankind now had a problem that we needed to be solved and the problem wasn't identifying the problem we already know what the problem is man has fallen from his condition isn't that right the problem was finding a solution to the problem and no one was able to solve the problem because we needed someone who was able we needed somebody who could do it but every man that was born oh of a sexual birth after Adam was created out of every man that was born since that time none of them were able to do it none of them were able to redeem none of them were able to restore they were just types they were just Shadows oh Hallelujah that God used throughout the ages but not one of them could do it oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh Hallelujah he was driven out because of sin isn't that right we had a problem but no one was able to solve that problem man himself couldn't save himself oh Hallelujah but he needed someone who was able to do it revelation five says I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders sayth unto me weep not behold because the lion of the tribe of Judah oh that's the one that is here tonight that's whose presence you feel here tonight he is a lion of the tribe of Judah the root and The Offspring of David ha Prevail to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne in that book lay your healing tonight in that book lay your deliverance in that book lay your fam's deliverance in that book lay The Inheritance but because no one was able to wory John said I wept much but here come a lamb oh bleeding bloody and he took that book out of his hand oh and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of old ERS which are the prayers of the Saints oh keep praying tonight your prayers are about to be heard your prayers are about to be answered whatever you are praying for God has not forgotten you but the prayers which are the fils are full of the odors uh a sweet smelling savior unto the Lord oh and they sng a new song s th are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof uh for thou are slain oh and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation we shall reign on the earth do you believe it tonight oh hallelujah oh my he is able he is able he's coming it's

it's coming it's coming a holy ghost Revival a seven tunder Revival oh Awake My Soul awake Suter and hop I myself shall awake early and I will praise the name of the Lord oh I come to praise him tonight I come to worship him tonight H why because he is able oh hallelujah hallelujah and the glory oh no wonder God told Moses tell the people I am that I am sent you if you want to know who's going to make it out in this time tell them I am that I am I am that I am the Eternal one he is the end he is the beginning he is the first he is the last you've got to put your promise in there in between that I am that I am you've got to put your promise in there I am your healer that I am I am your deliverer that I am I am a way maker that I am oh and the doctors don't know what to do when they give up on you tell the devil there is an I am tonight I am your healer I am your creator remember your creator in the days of th youth oh he promised to restore your youth like the eagles they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint seven tunder Revival to they that wait until the seven tunders utter their voices to that group who can take the word of God and hand it there and chop Goliath's head off in this message oh Hallelujah slay the intellect and let the faith of God come R and through heal every sick every py every disease everything that Jesus did this prde will do Under the power of the spirit God will rebild build the church again and she'll be a mighty marching army they shall run like Mighty Men oh you are mighty man and woman tonight give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah oh Victory in Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my that's right the Philadelphia Church age 1960 oh let's read a quote h s amen Prophet said how can it be How can any man know he is Christ until he's revealed himself to him How can any man know you can't reveal it to yourself but he is able tonight to reveal himself to whosoever he will as brother Isaac over preach here on Sunday he revealed himself to a little woman at the well a little ill famed woman oh my oh God bless you for that message brother Isaac amen how many appreciated it a little ill famed woman oh who didn't look like much to look at but she had something in her soul it was hidden underneath all the dress underneath all the filth underneath all the piles of dirt that the devil tried to throw on her he couldn't depreciate her value he couldn't hide her it didn't matter how much she did she had an appointment with the Supernatural and Jesus keeps all his appointments he said I have needs pass through Samaria they're trying to start a church banal they're trying to say I baptize people let me go on from here I got somewhere to be but before I get there I have to pass through Samaria to start a little Revival with a little ill Fame woman who nobody want to talk to who nobody want to look at who nobody wants to regard but that is who God called God hide himself behind bad your skins God hide himself in Simplicity God left potentates he left the powers of this world he left Trump he left Obama he left ke Rowley he left all of them and he come to you tonight because he reveal himself to whoever he will aren't you glad in this little old heart of mine I found a Manger fit for the Christ aren't you glad tonight in this manger of mine I found something without T without Penny without [Applause] price oh the devil didn't give it and the devil cannot take it away it is God that give it and we thank God for God tonight because he is able to do whatever he wants to do he is Sovereign which means you can't tell him how to do it he will do it how he wants to do it and he usually does it in a way to confound your human wisdom to confound your human understanding because if he does it the way you think it's going to happen then you could say it is by your might It Is by your strength It Is by your but God always like to find some people who might not be too educated or have too much degrees he always reveal himself Among The Humble among the simple among those that are willing to be broken for his name so that he could come down in Simplicity and reveal the awesomeness and reveal his power and reveal his glory in a way that you would not have known in your own mind and not have known in your own human Spirits you can't figure him out tonight all you've got to do is believe when you call on his [Applause] name oh you can't figure him out just believe God is too big to fit in this tiny brain of ours this little mind we have that we think we're so smart but God is too big for that he's too vast his his knowledge is so high we cannot attain unto it he must reveal himself isn't that right the prophet says here paragraph 150 see he reveals himself he has the key he can open it or leave it alone see he choose to do that amen I have the key he says to the door the prophet said I am the door Jesus says I am the way I am the truth I am the light oh I am the alpha he says I am the Omega I am the first and the last I am the father I am the son he says I am the Holy Ghost I am that I am Jesus is that's who's speaking tonight isn't that right not I was or will be he said but I am that I am he said that said the whole thing I am not I was or will be but I am he said that means living presence for eternity in other words I am now tonight I am I am tomorrow I am the next day and the next day he is your Pres do help in time of trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea we are living in the presence of the I am and when you're living in that presence there is no reason to fear oh just like but Gideon over said last week fear not perfect love cast out all fear amen do you believe it oh there's no reason to be afraid cuz I am is here tonight not I will be but I am right now whatever you have need of if you have a need tonight reach out to the I am that is here tonight oh to meet that need oh to answer your cry oh Hal he has ears and he can hear you tonight oh Hallelujah he has a voice and he can speak tonight don't be afraid oh just know that he is able tonight know that now Faith is Faith is right now whatever you have need of right now you could be healed right now you could be delivered right now you could be restored oh Hallelujah though you don't see the sun that doesn't mean that it's not still shining somewhere you might not see it right now oh but ass sure us there's a God somewhere that Sun is going to be rising in East in the morning and that true son the s o n of God is getting ready to rise tonight the Son of God with healing in his wings Healing For You Tonight Deliverance breakthrough for your family he is here tonight and there's a people in the land tonight in the Church of God tonight who know that without a shadow of a doubt and I believe those people are here tonight amen so God bless you as we continue amen says I am that I am see always always will be I am now as always was and always will be see he's just I am Hallelujah Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God Must Believe two things two things have been identified here what you have to believe when you come to God one you have to believe that he is I'll say that again but without faith is impossible to please him for he he that cometh to God must believe that he is that's it and the other part is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him oh so when you come to God tonight or anytime you come to God you must believe that he is he is whatever you have need of he is alive he is a available he is present tense he is Jehovah shama he is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah Rafa he is tonight whatever you have need of but you must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen amen isn't that right you're not seeking until you're tired you're seeking until you find that which you have lost there's a burden in your soul for that which you have lost amen because your husband is coming in the morning and you need to find what you have lost before the day break isn't that right and if it take all night long you have to believe isn't that right you have to find it seek it with all your heart he said you will find me when you search for me with all of your your heart amen that's true amen so we talking about he is able tonight isn't that right so if he is able then that means he has abilities then let's talk about tonight about God's abilities he has many abilities isn't that right Amen in scripture he's known as a Shepherd isn't that right our precious Brother D ad amen preach that message about the shepherd's business it is his business to take care of his sheep oh the Sheep are there to serve a purpose and it's the shepherd's business to take care of his own oh my sheep know my voice A stranger's voice they will not follow oh we are not seeking after strangers tonight but we know the call of the master tonight he put that call in our hearts before the foundation of the world and when he makes the sound a certain sound and when that sound goes out you're something in your soul that he put inside of you before the foundation of the world there's not enough devils in hell that can stop you from answering that call tonight oh my soul says yes yes to his promise yes to his word yes to that certain sound oh Hallelujah seven tunders seven voices seven Church ages it's a certain sound oh and we hear the sound of it oh and in that Jubilee a when you hear the trumpet sound all God's people must go free when you hear the sound of the chofar oh going war war drop your hole drop your axe you are no longer slaves tonight lift your hands God has set you free uh because you heard a sound of the abundance of rain oh he promised to pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh he promised to fill you he promised to seal you he promised to anoint you and I know that he is able to do it tonight he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all

of confusing your Channel with God you have to make your your pipeline uh without blockage without any hindrance so that the flow of God's inspiration could come to you and the only way that could
