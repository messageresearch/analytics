[50:42] bus you know the scripture already so
[50:44] just goes through it the same day when
[50:47] Jesus went Jesus out of the house and
[50:51] sat by the seaside and great multitudes
[50:55] were gathered together unto him so that
[50:58] he went into the ship and such and a
[51:01] multitude stood on the shore and his
[51:04] book managing sponsor them in parables
[51:07] saying behold a sower went forth to sow
[51:11] and when his sword some since fair by
[51:14] the way side and the fowls came and
[51:16] devoured them up so there upon stony
[51:20] places where they had not much hurt of
[51:24] what weights they sprung up because they
[51:26] had not dip lest they have no deepness
[51:28] of earth and when the Sun was up they
[51:32] were scorched and because they have no
[51:35] root they withered away as some fell
[51:39] among thorns and the thorns sprung up I
[51:42] shoved them but others fell into good
[51:45] ground glory and brought forth fruit
[51:49] some a hundredfold some sixtyfold some
[51:53] thirty who have ears to hear let him
[51:57] hear
[51:57] and the disciples came and said unto him

[52:03] he answered and said unto them because
[52:06] it is given unto you - not a mysteries
[52:09] of the kingdom of heaven but to them it
[52:13] is not given for whosoever hath to him
[52:17] shall be given Elisha have more
[52:20] abundance but whosoever hath not from
[52:24] him shall be taken away even that he
[52:27] heard the app was big I to them in
[52:29] parables because they seeing see not and
[52:33] hearing they hear not neither do they
[52:36] understand and in them is fulfil the
[52:39] prophecies of Isaiah which said by
[52:42] hearing ye hear you shall hear I shall
[52:45] not understand I've seen you shall see I
[52:49] shall not

[53:00] have that they have closed lists at any
[53:03] time they should see with your eyes and
[53:07] hear with their ears as you understand

[53:32] righteous men have desired to see those
[53:36] things which you see and have not seen
[53:38] them and to hear those things which hear
[53:42] and have not heard them
[53:44] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[53:46] service or when anyone here in the world
[53:49] of the kingdom and understandeth it not
[53:52] then cometh the wicked one and catcheth
[53:55] away that which was sown in his heart
[53:58] this is he which received seed by the
[54:02] way side but he that received the seed
[54:05] into stony places the same is he that
[54:09] heareth the word and anon
[54:11] joy with joy receiveth it yet had he not
[54:16] root in himself but dureth for a while
[54:20] for when tribulation or persecution
[54:22] arises because of the word by and by he
[54:27] is offended he also that received seed
[54:30] among the thorns is he died here at the
[54:33] ward and the cares of this life of this
[54:36] world and it is for deceitfulness of
[54:39] riches choke the word and he becometh
[54:43] unfruitful but he died received seed
[54:47] into the internet good ground is the
[54:50] same die here in the world and
[54:54] understanding it which also bring up

[1:05:52] get real hearts where they should I Sun
[1:05:55] began to shine upon the seed I will
[1:05:58] begin to get real hot
[1:06:00] they can stand a fire they can stand the

[1:06:16] the word test no they cast habits but
[1:06:20] this bride this similar good grounds
[1:06:23] this scene in a good cloud it's pretty
[1:06:27] isolated never to fail this break and
[1:06:31] never will just can't it's impossible
[1:06:35] for the brightest well forget about it
[1:06:39] the delica say that but if there is a

[1:08:00] seeds we read a denominational harvest
[1:08:04] that's exactly that's what we have done
[1:08:07] if you'd notice the word there in the
[1:08:12] Hebrew for man
[1:08:13] a little rain from a rain from a rain
[1:08:20] means so you ran and then when the
[1:08:23] spirit falls that you fall and if just
[1:08:27] and unjust good ground solid ground
[1:08:35] stony ground Westside all kinds of
[1:08:40] grounds and then you don't know who is
[1:08:42] who
[1:08:43] because everybody is a seat it received
[1:08:46] its in the other grounds glory but it
[1:08:51] depends on a kind of ground where the
[1:08:53] seed fell into because a seed on the
[1:08:58] west side is a good seed the seed or the
[1:09:01] stony ground is a good seed the seed on
[1:09:04] the stony ground is a good seed and a
[1:09:06] seed on the good ground is also a good
[1:09:09] seed but if it lays on the ground that
[1:09:12] the seed fell into
[1:09:16] this message cannot crocoduck there was
[1:09:18] not Church they can never do what about
[1:09:21] the does not want us know this message
[1:09:24] must fall into the good cloud
[1:09:25] predestined method crown and that's what
[1:09:31] we have at this witness for we are
[1:09:33] pruned annoyed him for the west side

[1:09:37] account and we'll pull it out of the
[1:09:39] Tony cloud I will present the whole team
[1:09:42] in a good crowd but this will brief for
[1:09:45] the price revival hallelujah I tell you
[1:09:50] that nervous in trouble Satan is in real
[1:09:53] trouble because the bride is color
[1:09:56] frauds by a manifestation glory now we
[1:10:04] notice here glory is that if we stood
[1:10:08] motionless seeds we just we will read
[1:10:13] the national harvest the matchless seed
[1:10:17] gives the nomination of forgiveness
[1:10:20] that's exactly right
[1:10:22] God said let the world beat up the is
[1:10:26] kind and so it is that's right oh
[1:10:29] brother
[1:10:30] the scripture is true you believe it
[1:10:33] you believe it and apply say Amen you
[1:10:39] know that's our language Anna well that
[1:10:41] which is amen praise the Lord glory to
[1:10:45] God hallelujah see we noticed that the
[1:10:49] fossil of a seed of the scream passive
[1:10:52] was branded a devil and we know it was
[1:10:56] in Genesis one they will find out and
[1:10:59] offer here in a book of Mathew data ten
[1:11:01] chapter Jesus were brand any discrepancy
[1:11:06] to his ward as being the devil anything
[1:11:10] that shows discrepancy contrary to the
[1:11:14] written word of God or put any private
[1:11:18] interpretation to it is a seed of
[1:11:21] discrepancy
[1:11:23] God will not honor it God will honor his
[1:11:29] Lord God will honor that to receive in a
[1:11:33] good ground
[1:11:34] everything was been right not some
[1:11:37] patent rights and so far wrong not 99.99
[1:11:41] if it is god is good all the way and
[1:11:45] everything must be right
[1:11:48] the ground was the right that was
[1:11:51] there a good seed that what his spirit
[1:11:54] must be the right kind of water the
[1:11:56] right atmosphere that's why in a message
[1:11:59] you can put it with forgiveness you can
[1:12:01] put a rebuttal kindness because it said
[1:12:04] that when the charge look that
[1:12:07] determination the church has a bride
[1:12:09] vice is brotherly love
[1:12:12] when the church finds is holding

[1:13:14] touch the siege God letter with a seed
[1:13:18] but trouble with a seed nearly the way
[1:13:21] that God said it and at the manifest is
[1:13:24] a time the manifestation will be the
