[53:24] church has found the Holy Ghost for
[53:27] under nearly two thousand years under
[53:30] martyrdom down there it's been wrong not
[53:33] at the river Euphrates we have seen the
[53:35] river is but not a believer it is but at
[53:38] the door of creeds and dogmas that the
[53:41] Holy Spirit can work in the church
[53:43] because of manmade system so once you
[53:46] put the plumbing with madman system Holy
[53:48] Spirit can walk to it because man set up
[53:51] the own thing set up the own lines and
[53:53] pipe and that's where quarter walk you
[53:55] that quarrels doing his own plumbing God
[53:58] has run his own line God has make his
[54:00] own connection and when God put his life
[54:03] and pull back the switch full power
[54:05] same works I do shall get walls same
[54:09] annoys him

[54:13] Omega and if the alpha produce Ibaka
[54:16] rocks so help me God me a couple we must
[54:20] it is absolutely necessary and

[54:35] padishah book not some textbook not some
[54:40] mystery book the some writing book not
[54:42] some message book but the book of Acts
[54:45] the acts of the Holy Ghost in men and
[54:48] woman who became a living book who
[54:51] became a written mystery a little
[54:54] mystery in mystery manifested mystery of
[54:58] God may be seated
[55:01] the Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[55:04] denomination rivers for almost 2,000
[55:07] years but is to be loosed so talk loose
[55:10] loosed by the evil time message where
[55:14] remember always the meanest even time s
[55:16] is the looser Holy Ghost how the tablet
[55:19] touch stop and loose Holy Ghost that
[55:21] Holy Ghost or care that Holy Ghost don't
[55:24] run Devils out the Holy Ghost us heal

[55:40] nobody oh there's a lot of shock or
[55:43] glory of God something on the floor
[55:45] something on her floor something on her
[55:48] floor let me season but I'm not a
[55:53] preacher this morning I'm just
[55:58] make it yes let's make an away for this
[56:02] preacher that gun ended up all right
[56:08] from United I'm a sign he's in ever
[56:10] since the days of the early church reach
[56:12] that ever see the things we have seen
[56:14] today and this was only made possible
[56:16] when God sent the seven seals and give
[56:20] us a sign buy it and send seven angels
[56:22] down from heaven and come to bring back
[56:24] that scattered wouldn't any nominations
[56:26] and tie it back in the Word of God again
[56:29] to bring down the Holy Spirit so the
[56:31] plumbing of God the wiring of God was
[56:33] scattered shortages so wanted to pick up
[56:35] all the wires all the connections and
[56:37] tie it together to bring down the Holy
[56:41] Spirit because with the restoration of
[56:43] the word come the restoration of power
[56:45] let me hit when I said again with the
[56:47] restoration of the will come the
[56:49] restoration of power so quarters and
[56:51] seven angels and line up all this word
[56:52] philosophy beat and argue and discuss
[56:55] it's the power back in the church so
[56:58] your expectation this morning is for the
[57:00] power of God the commented attached to
[57:03] prep rejoice Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah
[57:06] do you see you may be seated at time by
[57:10] the tongue is Vinny's coach how many
[57:12] years back sitting you say I wouldn't
[57:14] admit that but a brand that's why I say
[57:16] it so fast but look if that dove of
[57:21] meekness it's gone from you brother
[57:25] there's something wrong top of what
[57:28] missus as our word people don't like too
[57:31] much because they attribute mixes with
[57:33] weakness but meekness is not weakness
[57:38] weakness could be power in control our
[57:41] let's continue there is something wrong
[57:44] there we go when you can't be with one
[57:47] another when you can't forgive every
[57:50] person from the depths of your heart no
[57:54] matter what they have done or what they
[57:58] have said if you can't forgive them from
[58:00] the depths Jesus said if you don't
[58:03] forgive every man is trespasses from
[58:05] your heart
[58:06] neither does your heavenly Father
[58:08] forgive you if you can't forgive you are
[58:12] in trouble
[58:13] big time because faith is based on
[58:17] forgiveness if you want to have fear for
[58:20] your healing gate for your breakthrough
[58:21] every deliverance you have to forgive
[58:24] just drop it
[58:26] just leave it get on your hands let's
[58:30] just let it go get out you have released
[58:32] a person let them go free free to shout
[58:36] free to praise God let that court deal
[58:39] with them
[58:39] oh don't judge them let go deal with
[58:42] them let it go let it go let it go let
[58:45] it go and I believe prophecy that the
[58:53] Church of the Living God is moving to a
[58:55] sphere now that's going to shake the

[1:09:24] the vine except it abide in the vine no
[1:09:27] more can ye except ye abide in me I am
[1:09:31] the vine ye are the branches he that
[1:09:34] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:09:36] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:09:39] ye can do nothing if a man abide not in
[1:09:43] me he is cast forth as a branch in other
[1:09:47] words he is separated as a branch he is
[1:09:49] cut off as a branch he is no longer
[1:09:51] connected and his withered and men
[1:09:53] gather them and cast them into the fire
[1:09:56] and they are burned if he abide in me

[1:10:11] disciples as the father hath loved me so

[1:10:17] if he keep my Commandments you shall
[1:10:21] abide in my love even as I have kept my
[1:10:24] father's Commandments and abide in his
[1:10:27] love these things have I spoken unto you
[1:10:30] that my joy might remain in you and that
[1:10:34] your joy might be full this is my
[1:10:37] commandment that you love one another as
[1:10:40] I have loved you greater love hath no
[1:10:43] man than this than a man lay down his
[1:10:45] life for his friends
[1:10:47] ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:10:51] command you
[1:10:52] henceforth in other words because of
[1:10:54] this I call you not servants for the
[1:10:57] servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth
[1:11:00] but I have called you friends for all
[1:11:02] things that
[1:11:03] I have heard of my father I have made
[1:11:06] known unto you he have not chosen me but
[1:11:09] I have chosen you and ordained you that
[1:11:12] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[1:11:14] that your fruit should remain that
[1:11:16] whatsoever you shall ask of the Father
[1:11:18] in my name he may give it to you
[1:11:21] may the Lord at a blessing to the
[1:11:23] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:11:25] this morning hallelujah blessed be the
[1:11:28] name of the Lord are you happy to be in
[1:11:31] the house of the Lord this morning Amen
[1:11:34] or what a time we are living in we have
[1:11:36] a tremendous time with the young people
[1:11:38] yesterday is speaking on proverbs 4:23
[1:11:41] to guard your heart for out of it are
[1:11:45] all the issues of life every issue that
[1:11:48] you go through every issue that you have
[1:11:51] gone through every issue that you will
[1:11:53] go through comes out of what is in your
[1:11:57] heart and we are challenged we are
[1:11:59] instructed we are admonished by
[1:12:02] scripture to guard it with all diligence
[1:12:04] so it's not just God it's sometimes but
[1:12:07] with all diligence to guard your heart
[1:12:11] because out of it are all the issues of
[1:12:14] life and we are speaking about different
[1:12:17] scriptures love the Lord with all your
[1:12:18] heart with all your mind with all your
[1:12:22] soul with all your strength that all is
[1:12:25] a hundred percent so that love is a
[1:12:28] hundred percent of your heart a hundred
[1:12:30] percent of your mind
[1:12:32] a hundred percent of your soul a hundred
[1:12:35] percent of your strength and love is an
[1:12:37] action word so if you love God in your
[1:12:40] mind a hundred percent in your heart a
[1:12:42] hundred percent in your soul a hundred
[1:12:45] percent in your strength a hundred
[1:12:47] percent there's no room for the devil to
[1:12:48] to move in there it's impossible to
[1:12:51] backslide
[1:12:52] if you are loving God with all of your
[1:12:54] heart all of your mind all of your soul
[1:12:57] and all of your strength the problems in
[1:13:00] our Christian journey are connected to
[1:13:03] when that degree of love moves from a
[1:13:05] hundred percent in 99 to 97 to 98
[1:13:09] percent for summit down to four percent
[1:13:11] for some it's 14 percent and different
[1:13:13] levels are percentages so as we can
[1:13:16] it's back to the word and back to the
[1:13:18] spirit is to reconnect us to that great
[1:13:20] love can the church amen and our guiding
[1:13:26] of our heart is an everyday thing that's
[1:13:28] why it's with all diligence it's not got
[1:13:30] it on a Sunday it's with all diligence
[1:13:32] it's got it every single day got it on
[1:13:35] your job got it in your home got it in
[1:13:38] your marriage got it in the church got
[1:13:41] it when you're about to pray you're
[1:13:43] guarding it because in your heart has a
[1:13:45] seed in your heart as a sea that was
[1:13:48] placed there before you knew this gospel
[1:13:50] in your heart as a sea that was placed
[1:13:52] there before you knew about worship in
[1:13:55] your heart in the sea that was placed
[1:13:56] there before you knew about the blood
[1:13:58] but now that you know about the blood
[1:14:01] now that you know about this gospel now
[1:14:03] that you know who God is who the devil
[1:14:05] is and who you are now you have a
[1:14:08] commission to God that seed because in
[1:14:10] that serious life in that serious power
[1:14:13] in that seat is potential in that series
[1:14:16] adoption in that seat is perfection in
[1:14:19] that seat is your healing in that seat
[1:14:22] is your family in that seat is your
[1:14:24] deliverance in that seat is the promise
[1:14:27] in that seat is your purpose in that
[1:14:29] seat is your mission in that seat is
[1:14:32] what God has planned for you that he
[1:14:34] locked up inside of you that the devil
[1:14:37] doesn't know about so he's trying to
[1:14:39] attack that seed but we are commanded to
[1:14:41] guard our hearts up to protect that seed
[1:14:44] from every attack of the enemy to
[1:14:46] protect that seed from the enemies that
[1:14:48] are outside any enemies are within can
[1:14:51] the church say man you love the Lord
[1:14:54] this morning blessed be the name of the
[1:14:57] Lord so our title this morning my title
[1:15:01] is the greatest connection the greatest
[1:15:05] connection and I have a subject I am the
[1:15:08] vine and you are the branches and an
[1:15:11] inspiration there is my spirit flowing
[1:15:14] freely you know where I'm going this
[1:15:17] morning right so we live in a connected
[1:15:19] world from the beginning of time man has
[1:15:23] tried to stay connected try to stay
[1:15:27] connected by rights and messages
[1:15:29] others to see scraping it on the walls
[1:15:31] then as a man learned to write he tried
[1:15:34] to stay connected by writing letters
[1:15:36] so if you're going somewhere take this
[1:15:38] letter with you because I'm not
[1:15:40] physically in the proximity of the
[1:15:42] person that I want to see connected to
[1:15:44] so I'm sending a letter to them are you
[1:15:46] with me this morning then we evolved to
[1:15:48] the telephone so even though you can't
[1:15:50] see somebody you could call them on the
[1:15:52] phone to stay connected can the church
[1:15:55] say man and then we had email so you can
[1:15:58] stay connected even faster you can send
[1:16:00] an email it off to wait three weeks with
[1:16:02] a letter to get to somebody all these
[1:16:04] are attempts to see connected and then
[1:16:07] we enter with mobile phones and
[1:16:08] satellites and Technology and whatsapp
[1:16:11] and social media all of this we live in
[1:16:13] a connected world with the information
[1:16:16] superhighway and the Internet and
[1:16:18] everything is about connection and and
[1:16:20] connectivity they even see now if you
[1:16:23] want to know how many people at home has
[1:16:25] turned off the Wi-Fi and you'll find
[1:16:27] people coming with the rooms you didn't
[1:16:29] know they oh you didn't realize it was
[1:16:30] but who turned off the connection what
[1:16:33] happens at a Wi-Fi connection because we
[1:16:36] are we are we are living on a connected
[1:16:38] world they're people by instinct that if
[1:16:40] phone is not the issue we talk about
[1:16:42] people that one of the first things they
[1:16:44] do is pick up the phone if that phone
[1:16:46] has no Wi-Fi nobody picks up the phone
[1:16:48] somebody talk to me this morning it's
[1:16:50] because of the connection because there
[1:16:52] is a connection to the phone now data
[1:16:55] could move now communication can happen
[1:16:58] you can know what's going on you can
[1:17:00] know what's happening because of
[1:17:01] connection and the church say man we are
[1:17:05] connected by technology we are connected
[1:17:08] by geography
[1:17:09] had it not been for the fact that we
[1:17:11] were born on this island you may have
[1:17:13] never seen me I mean I've never seen you
[1:17:15] so our connection is also by geography
[1:17:17] our connection is also by history but
[1:17:21] there's also spiritual connections that
[1:17:23] are above all of these natural
[1:17:25] connections they are connections in
[1:17:28] nature they are connections in our body
[1:17:30] that doctors still are trying to figure
[1:17:32] out how this works of every thought you
[1:17:35] have is a connection that's taking place
[1:17:37] in your brain it's a chemical connection
[1:17:40] the doctors call it
[1:17:42] synaptic connection a biochemical
[1:17:44] connection so their connections in the
[1:17:47] science there are connections in the
[1:17:49] spirits Rob and before there was a world
[1:17:51] before there was a moon before there was
[1:17:54] a star before anything core existed
[1:17:56] alone and he longed to have connections
[1:17:59] by himself he could not have any kind of
[1:18:03] a connection it's impossible to have a
[1:18:05] connection if you are standing alone so
[1:18:08] God created angels and he started to
[1:18:11] connect with the Angels and when the
[1:18:13] angels worship Him he got some feedback
[1:18:15] from the worship and where the pranam
[1:18:17] said that's what made him caught up
[1:18:19] because God is the object of worship but
[1:18:22] what created that worship and that
[1:18:24] relationship of God was a connection
[1:18:26] between the angels and LLR Elohim so
[1:18:30] when they started to connect and praise
[1:18:32] and worship and the attributes of God
[1:18:34] was activated because of the connection
[1:18:37] but there were certain ports there were
[1:18:39] certain available sockets in God for
[1:18:42] some additional connections that the
[1:18:45] angels could not relate to they were not
[1:18:47] compatible with because God had the
[1:18:49] capacity to have connections to release
[1:18:52] healing he had the capacity to have
[1:18:55] connections up to give deliverance he
[1:18:57] had the ability he had the capacity
[1:18:59] through his connections to bring
[1:19:04] Redemption so go along for connections
[1:19:07] so when Adam came it was the first time
[1:19:10] that a different connection started God
[1:19:15] were coming in the cool of the evening
[1:19:16] he loved his connection so much that
[1:19:20] every day in the cool of the evening he
[1:19:22] will come now to connect with Adam Adam
[1:19:24] how was your tea
[1:19:25] talk to me Adam let's fellowship let's
[1:19:29] get connection people want to connect on
[1:19:31] Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram God
[1:19:34] loves to connect to have you connected
[1:19:36] with him have you accepted his
[1:19:38] connection requests dear ones Adam Adam
[1:19:41] look forward for that connection Lord I
[1:19:43] named this animal to swing and move this
[1:19:46] mountain to swing and good love the
[1:19:48] connection he looked forward for the
[1:19:51] connection
[1:19:51] every evening he come down until 1:00 me
[1:19:58] you may be seated sim came and broke the
[1:20:01] connection I'm Gordon see Adam where are
[1:20:04] you you're not on my network I'm trying
[1:20:07] to find you and I can't find new the
[1:20:10] connection is not working how it did
[1:20:11] yesterday Adam what happened Adam where
[1:20:14] are you and the connection was broken
[1:20:16] and from that day on God has been trying
[1:20:19] to re-establish the kind of connection
[1:20:23] that he had not only you may be seated
[1:20:32] was man was caught trying to
[1:20:34] re-establish a connection but the man
[1:20:37] also knew he was missing something
[1:20:39] because when you read the Bible and the
[1:20:42] building of the Tower of Babel man knew
[1:20:45] that there was a power source somewhere
[1:20:47] and man tried to build his power to
[1:20:49] connect to the power source the power
[1:20:52] source was not on it man knew the power
[1:20:54] source was somewhere about and God said
[1:20:57] they were united in their mission and
[1:20:59] their purpose to reconnect to the power
[1:21:01] source and the church see man and when
[1:21:07] God saw how they were trying to use
[1:21:09] technology to make this connection
[1:21:12] he said because they are united in their
[1:21:15] purpose they will actually achieve it
[1:21:17] but that's not how I want to be
[1:21:19] connected I don't want to connect on
[1:21:21] your terms I want to connect on my terms
[1:21:23] I don't want you to live one way and try
[1:21:26] to be connected because that's what they
[1:21:28] wanted to do they want to have their
[1:21:29] form of religion their form of
[1:21:32] understanding but the Branham said live
[1:21:34] like Devils and run up by me good taste
[1:21:37] of the presence of God but live any way
[1:21:39] they want to can the church say man we
[1:21:43] are talking about connections this
[1:21:44] morning
[1:21:45] life is about connections somebody
[1:21:48] looking for a job you want to know who
[1:21:49] you know what connections you have
[1:21:52] you know anybody in your bank I'm
[1:21:55] looking for a connection because I want
[1:21:56] to get alone trying to get a host you
[1:21:58] know anybody who needs you see I want
[1:22:00] looking for a connection life is about
[1:22:02] connection
[1:22:03] if your heart disconnects from your body
[1:22:05] with a George you know what happened
[1:22:14] connections are necessary but it's about
[1:22:17] the right type of connection there's a
[1:22:20] connection between labor and reward can
[1:22:24] we talk this morning a little bit there
[1:22:26] is a connection between actions and
[1:22:28] consequences you can't separate these
[1:22:30] things these connections exist there's a
[1:22:33] connection between how much you study
[1:22:34] and the results you get at your
[1:22:36] examination halle-loo here is a
[1:22:41] connection between what you eat and how
[1:22:42] you feel there's a connection between
[1:22:45] joy and your strength because my Bible
[1:22:47] tells me the joy of my lord of the Lord
[1:22:50] is my strength so the more joy you have
[1:22:52] there's a natural because of the
[1:22:54] connection you have more strength so if
[1:22:57] you don't have strength this morning
[1:22:58] maybe something is up with your
[1:23:00] connection can the church say man
[1:23:03] there's a connection between prayer and
[1:23:05] revival there's a connection between
[1:23:08] fasting and amplifying your prayers
[1:23:11] there's a connection between the Alpha
[1:23:13] Church and the Omega church that here
[1:23:15] without us cannot be made perfect
[1:23:17] somebody preach back to me this morning
[1:23:19] there's a connection between attending
[1:23:22] church services and the coming of the
[1:23:24] Lord because he said forsake not the
[1:23:26] assembling of yourselves together even
[1:23:28] as the day approaches there's a
[1:23:30] connection between the word and the
[1:23:31] spirit there's a connection between so
[1:23:34] and everything oh come on now there's a
[1:23:36] connection between the prophet and the
[1:23:39] prophecy there's a connection with you
[1:23:41] and the predestinated seed in your soul
[1:23:44] that the devil cannot touch there's a
[1:23:47] connection with where was now when I lay
[1:23:49] the foundations of the earth and the
[1:23:51] morning stars sang together there's a
[1:23:54] connection between the seed and the
[1:23:56] fruit because every seed must spring
[1:23:58] forth after its time come on now come on
[1:24:05] now there's a connection between a momma
[1:24:07] and her daughter that's why the Bible
[1:24:10] can see the promise done to you and your
[1:24:12] children
[1:24:13] God respects the connection he's a God
[1:24:16] of connection it's because there was a
[1:24:19] connection that's how we can find you
[1:24:25] you may be seated
[1:24:29] I'm not gonna be too long with you this
[1:24:31] morning but it's a connection building
[1:24:34] sacrifice connection between saving and
[1:24:38] having the connection between the
[1:24:40] physical exercise and how your body
[1:24:42] feels that's it the next to me between
[1:24:45] what effort you put in your marriage and
[1:24:46] the quality of your marriage there's a
[1:24:49] connection between how you talk to your
[1:24:50] children and the relationship between
[1:24:52] parents and children there's a
[1:24:54] connection with how children speaks to
[1:24:55] parents because the Bible says obey your
[1:24:58] parents honor your parents or your life
[1:25:00] to be long so long life is connected to
[1:25:03] how you live in your house there's a
[1:25:05] connection to your attitude coming to
[1:25:07] service and what you get out of the
[1:25:09] service there's a connection between how
[1:25:11] you look at things and what you get out
[1:25:13] of it because when you look what do you
[1:25:15] see it depends on what you're looking
[1:25:17] for there's a connection between how
[1:25:19] much of the word is in you and how much
[1:25:21] you grow 44:24 6404 it's connected
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:36] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:25:45] hopefully this helped somebody this
[1:25:47] morning I pray this helps of money
[1:25:49] there's no accident it's about
[1:25:52] connections when you get upset with
[1:25:54] somebody you pass exams they did
[1:25:56] something to pass the exam there's a
[1:25:58] connection
[1:25:59] somebody successful in business there's
[1:26:01] a connection between the effort I said
[1:26:03] to the young people yesterday you could
[1:26:04] say what you want the people who have I
[1:26:07] know people who get up 4:00 a.m. every
[1:26:09] morning they're at their desk working
[1:26:11] and when they have you cough actually
[1:26:14] when you enter work at 8 or 10 and at
[1:26:19] 3:45 you ready back up they had work at
[1:26:22] 4:00 a.m. and leaving at 9:00 p.m.
[1:26:24] there's a connection between what you
[1:26:26] put into anything and what you get out
[1:26:28] of it and God valued this connection
[1:26:35] which is bright so much that he invested
[1:26:38] everything he could he gave His only
[1:26:40] begotten Son that was a sacrifice he
[1:26:43] took to ensure that this relationship
[1:26:45] that this connection will here to
[1:26:48] results you may be seated
[1:26:54] this encouraging you this morning and we
[1:26:57] trying to get to the greatest connection
[1:26:59] these are all connection we ever reached
[1:27:00] a greater connection yet huh so I
[1:27:03] stumbled upon something and but the
[1:27:05] Branum spoke about Einstein about
[1:27:08] 30-plus of so time but a random refer to
[1:27:11] Albert Einstein and Albert Einstein
[1:27:13] coined a paper and wrote something about
[1:27:18] some quantum entanglement and he said
[1:27:23] when two particles will kindly connect
[1:27:28] however briefly it is called
[1:27:31] entanglement a connection takes place
[1:27:34] quantum entanglement which Albert
[1:27:38] Einstein called spooky action at a
[1:27:40] distance
[1:27:42] because he couldn't wrap his mind around
[1:27:45] all of it is how Albert Einstein
[1:27:48] famously derided the concept of quantum
[1:27:50] entanglement where objects can become
[1:27:53] linked and instantaneously influence one
[1:27:56] another regardless of distance so when
[1:28:01] this entanglement takes place with a
[1:28:03] punch no matter how far the particles
[1:28:05] separate because they had that contact
[1:28:09] before because they had that connection
[1:28:11] because they had that entanglement at
[1:28:14] some point no matter how far the
[1:28:16] platicas goes it will always behave in
[1:28:19] correlation to the other particle it
[1:28:20] interacted with no matter how long ago
[1:28:22] it happened no matter how far apart it
[1:28:26] becomes quantum entanglement is a
[1:28:29] phenomenon that scientists trying to
[1:28:32] figure out let me read it
[1:28:34] this is science I'm reading an and you
[1:28:36] tell me this sounds familiar
[1:28:37] anyway where objects can become linked
[1:28:40] and instantaneously influence one
[1:28:43] another regardless of distance no
[1:28:45] researchers suggest that this spooky
[1:28:48] action in a way might work even beyond
[1:28:50] the grave with its effect felt after the
[1:28:56] link between objects is broken so
[1:28:59] scientists seen the exists this
[1:29:01] phenomena where once two particles
[1:29:04] interact with one another despite how
[1:29:07] long ago it was despite how far it was
[1:29:10] despite even every particle with me
[1:29:12] grief always considered dead that it
[1:29:15] doesn't change the impact that one
[1:29:17] particle could have any other particle
[1:29:19] so I was thinking about this connection
[1:29:22] that existed before there was a moon
[1:29:24] before there was a stop before there was
[1:29:26] a molecule there was some entanglement
[1:29:29] that took place in the realm that we
[1:29:32] don't yet fully understand and that
[1:29:34] entanglement has existed all along even
[1:29:38] when you ain't in that quantum
[1:29:40] entanglement
[1:29:41] that spiritual antenna
[1:29:44] it could not be broken you may be seated
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:51] could it be I'm a scientist but could it
[1:29:54] be that when Lazarus died that that
[1:29:58] entanglement he had before he was born
[1:30:01] even though he was dead in the grave
[1:30:03] that entanglement could still connect to
[1:30:06] his cells because Jesus said Lazarus
[1:30:09] come forth and a man who was in another
[1:30:11] dimension in another realm he had been
[1:30:14] dead for a few days but distance and
[1:30:17] separate him time didn't separate him
[1:30:20] being dead in separated because he was
[1:30:23] connected can we continue the science
[1:30:36] class I had intended to put this up on
[1:30:41] the PowerPoint and the person in the
[1:30:43] back were with him for the presentation
[1:30:45] but I search and I get up to standard to
[1:30:48] show these things but I see this quantum
[1:30:51] entanglement thing is so powerful I just
[1:30:52] want to read one more description for
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:54] quantum entanglement is a physical
[1:30:56] phenomena phenomena is when something
[1:30:59] it's out of his out of normal
[1:31:02] explanation right that uncursed when
[1:31:04] Pierre's or groups of particles are
[1:31:06] generated interact or share special
[1:31:09] proximity so you commonly see him space
[1:31:15] it is interact with Jesus and your life
[1:31:17] is only see me something has decreased
[1:31:20] it has come it is presence for a brief
[1:31:24] moment at that brief what is enough you
[1:31:26] went to a meeting one night and maybe
[1:31:31] you stumble maybe you fell but that
[1:31:33] meeting one night that connection cannot
[1:31:35] be broken you lost you ever yes but that
[1:31:39] meeting one night somebody helped me
[1:31:44] this morning
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:46] or shear special proximity in ways
[1:31:50] listen such that the quantum state of
[1:31:53] each particle cannot be described
[1:31:56] independently of the state of the others
[1:31:59] in other words once they static interact
[1:32:04] you can't separate them you can describe
[1:32:07] one without talking about the other you
[1:32:09] can't talk about this one without
[1:32:11] talking about the next one anybody with
[1:32:17] me anybody with me this morning so the
[1:32:21] moment you talk about God talking about
[1:32:22] you the moment I talk about you to talk
[1:32:25] about God because you are connected
[1:32:27] oh come on somebody reach back to me oh
[1:32:30] that's why the Prophet said the moment
[1:32:33] the bride gets to know she is it's
[1:32:35] finished do you realize that you
[1:32:37] couldn't be here this morning unless
[1:32:39] there was a connection and because
[1:32:42] there's a connection you must be in a
[1:32:44] rapture because of the connection you
[1:32:47] must be healed because of the holy laws
[1:32:50] you must make the rapture oh somebody
[1:32:53] give God a shout of praise you may be
[1:33:00] seated
[1:33:01] hallelujah the prodigal son he left his
[1:33:05] home unless his family went to a far
[1:33:07] country and even in his law moment the
[1:33:10] connection came back to him that he had
[1:33:12] his father that is a simple concept he
[1:33:15] came to himself that connection he had
[1:33:18] just came back to him he said wait a
[1:33:20] minute the servants in my father's house
[1:33:22] get better treatment than this and he
[1:33:26] particles in him saying let me go back
[1:33:27] home and the father is also looking for
[1:33:30] the son because the particles in him
[1:33:32] know he has a son out here somewhere
[1:33:34] he cannot be separated the Blackson
[1:33:39] condition cannot change the connection
[1:33:41] that has already existed no one that the
[1:33:44] Bible says who he foreknew he called her
[1:33:46] who we call he justified he will justify
[1:33:49] he has already glorified
[1:33:51] [Applause]
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:59] [Applause]
[1:34:01] and I like it you may be seated
[1:34:03] the scientists are the ones seen even
[1:34:06] when the practicals are separated by a
[1:34:09] large distance this thing working I'm a
[1:34:17] scientist
[1:34:18] but listen anything that science trying
[1:34:21] to scratch it's just a little small
[1:34:23] fraction of the economy you're Gordon oh
[1:34:25] and if scientists trying to figure out
[1:34:28] these kind of connections brother I'm so
[1:34:31] excited
[1:34:31] mama papa I don't care how far your son
[1:34:34] is how far your daughter is I don't care
[1:34:37] how far your health went away from your
[1:34:39] body it's connected your health has got
[1:34:43] to come back
[1:34:44] your son has got to come back your
[1:34:46] daughter has got to come back your mind
[1:34:49] has got to come back your joy it's
[1:34:51] connected to you your joy has got to
[1:34:54] come back your peace has got to come
[1:34:56] back
[1:34:57] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[1:34:59] maybe you listen oh you ain't seen it
[1:35:03] for a minute if you've ever been in a
[1:35:05] revival before you already interacted
[1:35:09] with it it's got to come back to you we
[1:35:12] talk about what happened in 83 if you
[1:35:15] were there it's coming back for you oh
[1:35:17] come on somebody came in now listen
[1:35:23] let's take it higher this morning maybe
[1:35:25] seated
[1:35:26] but the Branham said I'm identified he
[1:35:29] said I was there back in the day of
[1:35:31] Pentecost he said I'm identified with
[1:35:33] what happened back there
[1:35:34] but abandoned where's our mother Alma he
[1:35:37] was a relevant angle meant when he went
[1:35:39] there so if we had a Pentecost there
[1:35:42] that's why the Prophet that say the
[1:35:43] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:35:46] real today as it was we are been there
[1:35:49] before
[1:35:51] [Applause]
[1:35:55] you may be seated
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:03] anybody in the house this morning
[1:36:05] anybody in the house this morning
[1:36:07] anybody in the house this morning you
[1:36:11] may be seated
[1:36:14] the Bible says the devil comes steal to
[1:36:20] kill to destroy the devil could only see
[1:36:23] what you have so if the devil at your
[1:36:26] door even if you don't know it you have
[1:36:28] something even if you don't know what
[1:36:31] you have even if you don't know what you
[1:36:33] have the devil knows you have something
[1:36:35] that's why you come to steal that's why
[1:36:38] you come to kill that's why I come to
[1:36:40] destroy the problem is most of us don't
[1:36:43] know what we have but the devil sees it
[1:36:45] he recognizes that he knows you were
[1:36:48] there you ever seen it for a minute
[1:36:57] that's why when Cho was in his lowest
[1:36:59] moment quad reminded you of his
[1:37:03] entanglement he telling where were you
[1:37:05] before the morning stars sang together
[1:37:09] because he was there your restoration is
[1:37:13] coming because you were there come on
[1:37:20] you spiritual scientists come on you
[1:37:23] spiritual scientists your healing is
[1:37:25] guaranteed your raptures parentid your
[1:37:28] adoption is guaranteed your
[1:37:30] perfectionist guaranteed
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:37:39] you may be seated
[1:37:44] let's talk a little more the wood itself
[1:37:49] its power the wood itself is life the
[1:37:54] wood itself is light so when you hear
[1:37:57] the would you get entangled in the wood
[1:38:00] and that's why the Bible said my words
[1:38:02] cannot return void because it drop on
[1:38:05] somebody it entangles so there are young
[1:38:08] people they might be in a bar right now
[1:38:10] but they entangled because a maritime
[1:38:13] meter the military service when you
[1:38:16] breathe its entanglement because prayer
[1:38:20] changes situations break a copy on where
[1:38:23] you are and reach somebody you may be
[1:38:25] seated for a minute these are laws
[1:38:29] unbreakable laws the top of the front of
[1:38:35] the school brother brother brother's car
[1:38:36] but if I said let's pray and it's better
[1:38:40] brethren pray it something came over the
[1:38:43] driver the world of pray backed by power
[1:38:46] encountered him and entanglement took
[1:38:49] place and distance didn't stop the
[1:38:51] effect but the Branham is older
[1:38:53] countries here before the doctors and
[1:38:54] touches my wife the tumor will go down
[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:10] this sense is nothing to God I'm not
[1:39:13] just talking about physical distance
[1:39:16] spiritual distance there people are
[1:39:19] physically here and spiritually
[1:39:22] somewhere else spiritually they've gone
[1:39:25] for a walk spiritually they have walked
[1:39:29] on the beach because I don't want to
[1:39:32] confront the issues of life what that
[1:39:36] distance cannot stop God David ended up
[1:39:45] with a broken connection because this
[1:39:49] connection broke he changed his prey
[1:39:52] said Lord restore unto me the joy of my
[1:39:58] salvation David was asking for a
[1:40:01] reconnection his line had been cut but
[1:40:06] if Adam said that God doesn't walk away
[1:40:08] from us he said we are the ones who walk
[1:40:11] away if you want to find God go right
[1:40:15] back where you left him he'll be
[1:40:16] standing right there
[1:40:18] anybody in the house is Smalley and the
[1:40:25] beautiful thing about God because man
[1:40:27] has been progressing to try to break
[1:40:30] into God's laboratory you know
[1:40:31] yes ago our microphones had cords no
[1:40:35] they do have cords anymore he has forgot
[1:40:37] to connect to the internet you have to
[1:40:39] get a physical phone line now there is
[1:40:42] Wi-Fi because God don't need no physical
[1:40:45] line to connect and I think Burrillville
[1:40:47] said it last week when you connect to a
[1:40:49] Wi-Fi connection one of the amazing
[1:40:52] technologies is if you connected Wi-Fi
[1:40:54] in your house and you fly all the
[1:40:56] country and you come back a year later
[1:40:58] once you reach back to your house your
[1:41:02] phone does carry connect one time enough
[1:41:03] because that is your network
[1:41:07] there's your network unless he passed
[1:41:10] what gene sighs your network and no
[1:41:12] matter how you mess up once you come
[1:41:14] back into the presence of God it
[1:41:16] reconnects to the network because you
[1:41:19] have been entangled before the username
[1:41:22] and password has already been put into
[1:41:24] your soul and that's why the devil
[1:41:27] fights you to come to church fight you
[1:41:29] to make it the Promethean fight you to
[1:41:32] open the world because when you open the
[1:41:33] scripture because of the sealing your
[1:41:36] soul there's a password and know you
[1:41:38] could be inspired and would always read
[1:41:40] to read the inspired Word of God can the
[1:41:43] church say man
[1:41:49] when Samson sinned he broke his
[1:41:52] connection there was also a connection
[1:41:57] between Samson's choices his decisions
[1:42:01] and his consequences Samson was annoying
[1:42:06] city was blessed he was a Nazarene foul
[1:42:08] on him but he broke a contract with God
[1:42:13] he broke a fall with God and no matter
[1:42:16] how anointed you are how cold you are
[1:42:19] how inspired you are how set aside you
[1:42:22] are won't you break the contract with
[1:42:24] God there will be consequences but
[1:42:27] within the consequences was also purpose
[1:42:31] because while Samson was in prison
[1:42:34] paying for what he did milling at the
[1:42:37] mill he started to reflect on the
[1:42:40] connection he used to have he started to
[1:42:43] think about when he was connected he
[1:42:45] started to think about when the lion
[1:42:47] came and he established a connection how
[1:42:51] power started to flow through him become
[1:42:53] better Brannon said he wasn't a muscular
[1:42:55] man he was a small man but when he went
[1:42:57] but - but when he got connected there
[1:43:00] was a strength that he couldn't
[1:43:02] replicate on his own when he left up the
[1:43:05] kids all he had to do was connect and he
[1:43:08] can lift up the gate
[1:43:11] what are you connected to this morning
[1:43:15] as Samson was led to the pillars without
[1:43:19] his eyes he saw the possibility that he
[1:43:23] could be reconnected to court the court
[1:43:26] has always had some great connections
[1:43:28] you know what it used to be ever pull
[1:43:30] something like even good that's
[1:43:34] something special you know direct
[1:43:38] connection with God by George when
[1:43:41] Corliss chocolate Jeremiah and it's very
[1:43:44] difficult because when you read
[1:43:45] scripture you have to understand it I
[1:43:46] don't want to say it like God has
[1:43:48] favorites but when you look at it is
[1:43:50] only one man Issei is a man after my own
[1:43:51] heart
[1:43:52] who want to get a fight with that you
[1:43:54] get a fight with that but I was David
[1:43:55] title you complex with that God is
[1:43:59] sovereign he give every man his portion
[1:44:02] you could handle David trials people
[1:44:05] want David title but it don't want David
[1:44:07] trials people won't even run but I don't
[1:44:10] want any problems many are they increase
[1:44:12] the trouble me many didn't rise up
[1:44:14] against me many I didn't see of my soul
[1:44:18] there is no help for him in God is no
[1:44:20] help with him outside of God but donor
[1:44:23] shield from me gave his life and
[1:44:27] character earned him the designation of
[1:44:30] a man after God's own heart the pain he
[1:44:36] went through the sacrifices he for the
[1:44:38] rejection the jealousy the animosity the
[1:44:41] assassination attempts on his life all
[1:44:44] of it came together to define his
[1:44:46] character
[1:44:47] to be worthy of the title of man after
[1:44:49] God's own heart and David had a
[1:44:55] connection with God
[1:45:00] outside er me he had a connection at all
[1:45:02] the solace didn't have I was with the
[1:45:07] lion and I was tending the Sheep and a
[1:45:10] lion came and I slew the lion I was
[1:45:14] there with his sheep and I beat him and
[1:45:16] I stood up here and the connection I
[1:45:18] have with God if you want me to tickle
[1:45:20] his Goliath I will take him out nobody
[1:45:23] else had that testimony because nobody
[1:45:26] else at that type of connection what is
[1:45:33] your connection with God but the Branham
[1:45:36] talked about a time there was an area
[1:45:38] where there was no water I don't if you
[1:45:39] remember it and he said that there was
[1:45:41] this man who came out to pray and he
[1:45:44] said whenever man he longed to pray you
[1:45:45] could see this one man was a man who was
[1:45:47] used to praying he said the moment he
[1:45:49] started he City new readers gonna come
[1:45:51] because they noticed my had a connection
[1:45:53] with God when people see you do didn't
[1:45:57] know they have a connection with God
[1:45:59] when the sons of ski four were preaching
[1:46:01] trying to cast out Devils those Devils
[1:46:03] say listen Paul I know we know about his
[1:46:07] connection pizza I know we know what his
[1:46:09] connection are you connected do you have
[1:46:13] a connection anybody with me this
[1:46:18] morning so we see God has different
[1:46:26] level of connections huh
[1:46:27] and we read it in the scripture it's
[1:46:29] parallel he throws the seed on good
[1:46:31] ground and some bring forth 64 summer
[1:46:34] 104th why everybody bring a hundred food
[1:46:37] and how do you think God would treat
[1:46:39] those who bring for 100 food but listen
[1:46:43] to this in Jeremiah 15 verse 1 go tell
[1:46:46] the Prophet Jeremiah that even if Moses
[1:46:49] and Samuel were to stand before him you
[1:46:53] know we say I am connected to them
[1:46:55] brothers I'm connected even if Moses and
[1:46:57] Samuel were to stand before me his heart
[1:47:00] would not be with these people so great
[1:47:02] was their sin so he said them people
[1:47:04] give so much trouble that even if Moses
[1:47:07] who he was connected with and Samuel
[1:47:08] come on plead for them be not sparing
[1:47:09] them to speak of the level of the
[1:47:12] connection where George god have a
[1:47:14] Moses and Samuel in ezekiel 1414 go to
[1:47:19] Ezekiel that even if Noah Daniel and job
[1:47:23] were to pray for them people he would
[1:47:26] Odin deliver know Daniel and job and not
[1:47:29] delivery people read the Bible because I
[1:47:34] respect my connection with a member then
[1:47:36] people give him too much trouble if Noah
[1:47:40] Daniel and job come together to bring
[1:47:42] with them to deliver them
[1:47:43] I will deliver Noah Tournament rope if
[1:47:45] it is connected but he arrested them in
[1:47:47] trouble what is your connection with God
[1:47:54] how connected are you with God but the
[1:48:04] Branham said God's connection with
[1:48:06] Joseph in the New Testament Joseph and
[1:48:09] Mary his connection to the listener
[1:48:11] prophets were in court hiding himself in
[1:48:13] simplicity then revealing himself in the
[1:48:15] same he said and Joseph there's none of
[1:48:17] somebody Israel the Lord came to him by
[1:48:19] night saying Joseph you're a son of
[1:48:21] David don't fear to take unto you Mary
[1:48:23] your wife for that's nothing bad but
[1:48:25] that is what the Holy Ghost that settled
[1:48:26] it that man Joseph with such connection
[1:48:30] with God till God to speak to him are
[1:48:37] you working to have such a connection
[1:48:39] with God that God to speak to you
[1:48:42] anybody in the house this morning
[1:48:45] I'm not talking about connected to
[1:48:47] church collected any message I told
[1:48:49] being connected with God you may be
[1:48:57] seated for a minute and people have the
[1:49:00] audacity to want to define who you're
[1:49:03] supposed to be connected with if you
[1:49:07] connected with this church if you're on
[1:49:09] this hookup which ministry is connected
[1:49:11] with I don't care about no connection of
[1:49:13] any ministry I care about one connection
[1:49:15] I want to be connected with God
[1:49:18] [Applause]
[1:49:24] there's no scripture that tells me to
[1:49:27] connect with any ministry my Bible says
[1:49:29] I am the vine and you are the branches
[1:49:31] God made provision for a direct
[1:49:34] connection direct connection but a
[1:49:38] tangle a direct connection God has you
[1:49:41] already socket and you ready to go -
[1:49:43] nobody taken extra sauce
[1:49:47] somebody say man you may be seated
[1:49:52] I tell God I went Calvary to please the
[1:49:55] veil of partition the veil of separation
[1:49:59] between the historical priesthood was
[1:50:02] broken when the veil was rent from top
[1:50:04] to bottom because before that you had to
[1:50:06] go through the priesthood but when
[1:50:08] Christ died he abolished the system of
[1:50:10] the priesthood and say you can come if
[1:50:12] you want to come you can connect if you
[1:50:14] want to connect you can draw power if
[1:50:17] you want to draw power if you abide in
[1:50:19] me and my words abide in you you can ask
[1:50:21] what you will not just a preacher but
[1:50:24] you can ask what you will and it shall
[1:50:26] be done we are talking about this -
[1:50:34] greatest connection and to make it clear
[1:50:44] believers can unplug themselves you know
[1:50:50] they get disconnected in the super
[1:50:55] semi-random said Jehoshaphat was a
[1:50:57] believer out of connection with his God
[1:51:01] and you know when people connected and
[1:51:03] see the decisions because by the fruits
[1:51:06] you know it is that because you can have
[1:51:08] no froofy reading scripture it's only
[1:51:10] through the vine the branch could bring
[1:51:13] forth fruit so if you are fruit looking
[1:51:16] like admin G don't blame divine honor
[1:51:22] blame the connection because the vine is
[1:51:26] pure divine have no mistake with it
[1:51:30] divine don't make mistake divine is
[1:51:32] perfect but he said if a branch air
[1:51:35] produce the only branches cut off
[1:51:38] because the connection was right and
[1:51:40] it's thrown any man carries and burn it
[1:51:43] but if you start to produce then he
[1:51:46] pulled you he take it through some more
[1:51:49] child's or God helped me this morning
[1:51:51] take it to some more testings so you can
[1:51:54] bring forth more fruit and he put it to
[1:51:57] some more tires and some more character
[1:51:59] development more processing so you bring
[1:52:03] what much fruit anybody with me this
[1:52:06] morning so we still creature and how
[1:52:08] this here we are leave the channel we we
[1:52:11] still inside a channel hallelujah so we
[1:52:19] are talking about the currents about
[1:52:20] connection so there are different kinds
[1:52:23] of connections there people that want to
[1:52:25] be connected and Apostle people are
[1:52:28] collectively Church they've no they do
[1:52:29] not a doctrinal but this is my choice
[1:52:31] you go into a war we could have healthy
[1:52:35] Church they will connect with a prophet
[1:52:36] they not connectivity message they go to
[1:52:38] war and they have no connection with God
[1:52:41] because they had a connection with God
[1:52:42] they'll behave different because but a
[1:52:44] brand behave themselves in a way like I
[1:52:47] said to them I was having a comment I
[1:52:50] said if this message was the Mafia
[1:52:54] drive-by shooting every other nail
[1:53:02] and that's not holy prophet live because
[1:53:05] the Prophet was connected with God
[1:53:08] because of the brofist connection with
[1:53:11] God he could sit down and hear a
[1:53:12] preacher who didn't have his depth of
[1:53:14] revelation and he can still support a
[1:53:16] meetin somebody helped me this morning
[1:53:18] that's the depth of his connection
[1:53:22] whatever our day we need to get more
[1:53:25] connected so good people don't want to
[1:53:30] shake your hand but when it connected me
[1:53:34] Cody could shake anybody's hand what did
[1:53:38] it say what the Prophet you couldn't
[1:53:39] tell his friends from his enemies
[1:53:41] because of the quality of his connection
[1:53:43] with God let's bring it to your house
[1:53:49] how you talk to your wife speaks to the
[1:53:54] quality of your connection with God how
[1:53:58] you speak to your husband speaks of the
[1:54:00] quality of your connection with God how
[1:54:03] you talk to your boss on the job even
[1:54:05] though he's an unbeliever speaks to the
[1:54:07] quality of your connection with God how
[1:54:10] do you sweetie a neighbor even if they
[1:54:12] play music all night long speaks of the
[1:54:17] quality of your connection with God how
[1:54:20] your deal reigns I'm gonna give you a
[1:54:22] bad drive speaks of the quality of your
[1:54:27] connection with God because the more
[1:54:33] perfecting connection then the fullness
[1:54:36] of the life that's in the vine that now
[1:54:38] flow to the branches and Korra's long to
[1:54:41] be able to see there's my spirit flowing
[1:54:43] free
[1:54:46] freely freely you may be seated for a
[1:54:53] minute
[1:54:55] this spirit does move is very moving you
[1:54:57] know but is it free Ness is what we
[1:54:59] talked about back angrily because you
[1:55:02] feel his presence but for the oldest
[1:55:04] goat-face move freely there has to be
[1:55:06] nothing blocking any block is never
[1:55:08] undefined the block is any branches the
[1:55:12] block is because it agrees he promised
[1:55:14] he teachings your own belief your own
[1:55:16] what your thing should be that is very
[1:55:18] plucking is but once all them things get
[1:55:21] it upon destroyed and thrown away then
[1:55:23] the Holy Ghost and the power divine turn
[1:55:26] our loose loose and then this branch
[1:55:29] could produce the fruit of faith virtue
[1:55:32] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:55:35] brotherly kindness even charity the bond
[1:55:38] of perfectness God help us this phone
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:45] anybody in the house this morning who
[1:55:52] are you connected with this morning
[1:55:53] there people who trust their family
[1:55:56] connections more than connecting with
[1:55:58] God unn social media new connection
[1:56:05] requests that's all linking write it you
[1:56:07] have a new connection request so it's
[1:56:09] not just you do an external connection
[1:56:11] if you people trying to connect with you
[1:56:14] as a youngster starting or sister Anna
[1:56:16] said yesterday only first thing they
[1:56:18] want to do - Gary hard is not a lot of
[1:56:19] people who not your friends not I mean
[1:56:23] not your family another Fernando meaning
[1:56:24] they are your so see it's because Jesus
[1:56:27] say I call you my friends because you
[1:56:29] keep my Commandments so your friends are
[1:56:32] those who keep the commandments don't
[1:56:35] tell me about your school friends and my
[1:56:37] work friend my friend from how do you
[1:56:39] become friend because many of us is
[1:56:45] these external connection that get us in
[1:56:47] trouble because compromise or compromise
[1:56:52] or belief compromise or prayer life can
[1:56:56] the church say man I'm not going to be
[1:56:58] too much longer with you but
[1:56:59] his foodie singer this morning I don't
[1:57:01] know about you but I I eaten it because
[1:57:05] I want to be so connected and lived
[1:57:08] through that scripture that he is the
[1:57:10] vine and we are the branches is we are
[1:57:13] not the same we are connected we are not
[1:57:17] the same
[1:57:17] I'm not divine I'm a branch there's a
[1:57:21] difference between what the vine can do
[1:57:23] and what the branch can do the vine
[1:57:26] cannot produce fruit the vine needs the
[1:57:30] branches to produce the fruit that's why
[1:57:34] the Branham said God could only prove
[1:57:35] his word by believers he needs somebody
[1:57:38] to work through and God put a clause in
[1:57:42] there to make sure this happens all the
[1:57:43] time he said grow will at least have one
[1:57:44] witness so in every time he always have
[1:57:49] one with wet just one with this so I
[1:57:52] believe in my heart I am one so if it's
[1:57:55] one person on this island
[1:57:57] I believe it's me do you believe is you
[1:58:05] you you have to listen if you don't
[1:58:13] believe in yourself they look at I of
[1:58:14] Allah you have to know who you are and
[1:58:17] you can only know who you are by good
[1:58:19] and check this source that describes
[1:58:21] what everything is because you have to
[1:58:22] find yourself in the world you have to
[1:58:24] find yourself in the scripture Jesus
[1:58:26] never going to find himself in the
[1:58:27] scripture when he when I read the Spirit
[1:58:29] of the Lord is upon me he was fine and
[1:58:31] what was describing him so he could know
[1:58:34] his position and he could take his place
[1:58:37] can the church Shaymin
[1:58:39] so let me drop in a few quotes I'm
[1:58:42] already halfway through so we returning
[1:58:45] only higher a conflict between God and
[1:58:47] Satan the true bride must be unified or
[1:58:50] connected same thing you know soul
[1:58:52] unless please the would with any context
[1:58:54] the true I must be connected or unified
[1:58:57] by the wood now remember if she is a
[1:58:59] part of Christ she has to be the word of
[1:59:01] Christ in order to be the word of Christ
[1:59:04] you have to be baptized into Christ and
[1:59:06] when you in Christ you believe Christ
[1:59:08] and Christ is to it
[1:59:09] the bride must be unified
[1:59:13] the church not the message believers but
[1:59:15] unified together by the word my sheep
[1:59:17] hear my voice and this is his voice on
[1:59:20] printed wood all right you unified by
[1:59:22] the word she meets herself ready not
[1:59:24] with the regular Creed like Esther when
[1:59:27] Esther was to be chosen to stand before
[1:59:28] the king she did not dawn herself with
[1:59:31] all the things but she adorned herself
[1:59:32] with our sweet meek spirit that's what
[1:59:36] the bride is adorned herself with let
[1:59:39] that arrogant spirit not abet in a new
[1:59:42] spirit not we have its spirit because we
[1:59:45] have nothing unless God gives it he said
[1:59:47] you cannot do nothing unless the vine
[1:59:49] does it
[1:59:50] you have nothing unless the vine giving
[1:59:53] you strength to do it so you can't claim
[1:59:55] credit we can't claim credit for
[1:59:59] anything is the vine as a source the
[2:00:01] vine is our strength the vine is our
[2:00:03] inspiration the plan is our power can
[2:00:06] the church Haman that's what the brides
[2:00:14] are doing herself with with all of the
[2:00:17] fruits of the spirit following it so
[2:00:19] this year you see the type is a branch
[2:00:20] with the fruit what she's got assembling
[2:00:23] together in the Fellowship of the word
[2:00:24] fellowshipping of the wood sitting
[2:00:26] together in heavenly places in Christ
[2:00:28] she's just one Accord one place one
[2:00:30] spirit one mind one hope one chord one
[2:00:33] purpose Amen see there you are fruits of
[2:00:37] the spirit what she's got what are the
[2:00:39] fruit of this pursuit this is what the
[2:00:41] vine is supposed to be producing in our
[2:00:43] lives I with me this morning what is the
[2:00:46] fruit that is where joy joy of a heart
[2:00:48] knowing that he's coming soon a joy to
[2:00:54] know he's coming soon and when you see
[2:01:00] what's happening and I read the
[2:01:01] scripture for them let me just put it in
[2:01:03] context because after why they said
[2:01:06] nothing would surprise you and any
[2:01:07] seedings happening and when you read the
[2:01:09] news in the country and different things
[2:01:11] and want to know what is going on I read
[2:01:14] this video on people yesterday in
[2:01:19] Proverbs 4 from verse 14 enter not into
[2:01:24] the path of the wicked and
[2:01:26] not in the way of evil men avoid it
[2:01:29] passed not by it turn from it and pass
[2:01:32] away listen to this verse verse 16 for
[2:01:35] the asleep not except they have done
[2:01:38] mischief so that people who can sleep
[2:01:41] unless they do mischief and listen to
[2:01:45] the scripture and they and their sleep
[2:01:48] is taken away unless they cause some to
[2:01:51] fall so why are you looking for a good
[2:01:57] rest when it might come yeah people who
[2:02:00] can't sleep unless it goes on trouble
[2:02:01] somebody the caste fellows are going to
[2:02:03] rob somebody they can't sleep on it look
[2:02:04] one is when he went to kill and do
[2:02:06] mischief they could go and sleep and in
[2:02:11] this world you don't have joy because
[2:02:13] he's coming soon brother I am so happy
[2:02:17] that he's coming soon I am so happy that
[2:02:21] he has a reward for us I am so happy
[2:02:24] that we are leaving this place I'm so
[2:02:26] happy that we have a way of escape I am
[2:02:29] so happy that there's hope for us I am
[2:02:31] so happy our redemption Troy at night
[2:02:34] I'm so happy and we gonna lock up Inori
[2:02:39] time to enjoy at night joy of a heart
[2:02:43] knowing he's coming soon amen amen
[2:02:46] yes peace of mind what peace of mind
[2:02:49] know what no matter what comes or what
[2:02:51] goes listen to the Prophet let the ship
[2:02:53] rock let the storms come let the
[2:02:56] lightning flash the Thunder roar
[2:02:58] whatever takes place don't make a bit of
[2:03:00] a difference atomic bombs could fall you
[2:03:03] can pill Rock shelters bomb shelters
[2:03:05] whatever you want but she'll still say
[2:03:07] amen amen amen why she is fortified what
[2:03:10] fortified and what in the world the
[2:03:13] world what made flesh dwelling among us
[2:03:15] watching him move among us in our
[2:03:18] assembly see ya years so what difference
[2:03:20] does it made me come let the conflict go
[2:03:23] on hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:27] I just wanna drop this in here you say
[2:03:30] here in Jesus and Ananias would so you
[2:03:32] say you connect to the divine and then
[2:03:35] you deny his word something wrong
[2:03:37] he always says Amen to his own
[2:03:40] you know that assembling for fellowship
[2:03:42] joy one of the fruits of the spirit like
[2:03:46] I said if you're law and enjoy skills
[2:03:49] check your connection you might be any
[2:03:51] wrong network assembling for fellowship
[2:03:59] if you have promised assemble for
[2:04:01] fellowship check your connection joy one
[2:04:06] of the fruit service with peace of mind
[2:04:08] and faith in the wood the peace joy feed
[2:04:10] long-suffering patience gentle and speed
[2:04:13] what kind of feel what kind of way you
[2:04:15] use using a fear to fight the conflict
[2:04:17] are you gonna use your faith and some
[2:04:19] theory or some reasoning something if
[2:04:24] the church don't preach every word of
[2:04:26] that Bible then II meant every word of
[2:04:28] it believe every time believe everyone
[2:04:30] the scene I'm working right there and
[2:04:32] get away from it no matter how big or
[2:04:34] little it is I am the vine and you are
[2:04:38] the branches
[2:04:39] what are you connected to this morning I
[2:04:43] you so connected to your job now you
[2:04:46] have no time which is connected to your
[2:04:49] job you have no time for the kingdom so
[2:04:52] connected to your job that you have no
[2:04:54] time to testify to anybody you know
[2:04:57] where the bottom said if you don't
[2:04:58] testify you're find yourself back sit in
[2:05:00] one day so it means that testifying to
[2:05:04] people is a sign that you are connected
[2:05:06] because if you end up back sittin it
[2:05:08] means it is connected so let's make all
[2:05:11] the right connections it's our
[2:05:13] responsibility to testify
[2:05:14] it's our responsibility to encourage
[2:05:17] these are all evidences if I could say
[2:05:21] that of being connected to divine divine
[2:05:25] is not selfish so the branch cannot be
[2:05:27] selfish divine gave everything and you
[2:05:30] want to give nothing but because a true
[2:05:34] branch is connected a True Vine it gives
[2:05:36] up itself and produces fruit and the
[2:05:39] fruit is not for your benefit come on
[2:05:41] now the food is not for your benefit
[2:05:44] the food is to help others can the
[2:05:46] church say man
[2:05:52] sending me along a few things in the
[2:05:54] message paradox well around said wasn't
[2:06:00] a strange thing in the days that with
[2:06:01] King Ahab was king of Judea and of
[2:06:04] Israel rather Jehoshaphat the righteous
[2:06:06] man king of Judea how I believer can get
[2:06:08] connected with a mig believer so very
[2:06:12] Branham true is message warning us of
[2:06:13] the kind of connections we will end up
[2:06:15] with that take them away from connecting
[2:06:17] with divine sometimes man gets in that
[2:06:21] kind of a fix today mix themselves up
[2:06:24] with people who don't believe the word
[2:06:25] and yet they are bound to them with such
[2:06:28] ties they they can get all they are free
[2:06:29] to accept it
[2:06:30] we have enough horizontal connections we
[2:06:37] need to get more vertical connection in
[2:06:39] the seed of discrepancy but the banner
[2:06:41] cries our God give us man who's the
[2:06:44] connector is nothing but God honest with
[2:06:46] that'll tell the truth about it that's
[2:06:48] exactly what we need and where the
[2:06:51] Branham goes in to pray and a message he
[2:06:53] was to pass this way I pray that you
[2:06:56] will visit each one and give to them the
[2:06:59] reality that it is to be a real
[2:07:01] Christian and no matter how much the
[2:07:03] world tries to discourage us and how
[2:07:05] much that others try to discourage us
[2:07:08] let us know that it's a fight to get
[2:07:10] there it's an effort we have to put
[2:07:13] forth but when connected with something
[2:07:15] that's genuine real it changes us then I
[2:07:18] pray that you will change every heart
[2:07:20] Lord and make everyone in divine
[2:07:23] presence at this time but the Holy
[2:07:25] Spirit in their life to be as much
[2:07:28] Christian as the mother there was a
[2:07:29] mother she was born
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:36] love the Lord is spawning in the message
[2:07:42] show us the father and it'll satisfy us
[2:07:44] and I think of that today brother
[2:07:45] when Jesus was willing the son of God to
[2:07:47] come from the ivory palaces of glory
[2:07:50] down here and take a disgraceful name
[2:07:53] and humiliate himself in human flesh and
[2:07:56] be called a Holy Roller or religious
[2:07:59] fanatic and walk up there and bleed
[2:08:01] Dyer's a curse on a treat and you
[2:08:03] ashamed God have mercy on the people
[2:08:05] have mercy and your shame to connect
[2:08:07] yourself with his people and the world
[2:08:11] is falling apart what we need to do is
[2:08:12] get connected that's all right now get
[2:08:15] connected with Christ our lives of our
[2:08:19] emotion the lives of our mind connected
[2:08:25] to lead to this greatest connection of
[2:08:29] deere's my spirit flowing freely the
[2:08:32] restoration of the full word through the
[2:08:34] Prophet messenger of Malachi 4 made a
[2:08:37] way for a perfect connection because the
[2:08:40] word is a conductor of the Spirit so the
[2:08:43] husband man the Lord Himself sent the
[2:08:45] prophet to reveal every mystery the tie
[2:08:48] up the loose ends to give access that
[2:08:51] the branch could effectively connect
[2:08:53] with divine imperfection but it has had
[2:08:56] time not time is this little loop it
[2:08:58] loops down Jesus was from eternity to
[2:09:00] eternity but he stepped into the tiny
[2:09:03] space and was made flesh and come
[2:09:05] through here in order to sanctify or put
[2:09:08] a streak of blood all across this place
[2:09:10] to redeem it and listen to connect it
[2:09:13] back with God again for all eternity you
[2:09:15] see it that's all time is what is the
[2:09:20] Holy Ghost but if Adam said now the
[2:09:21] Spirit of God has willed under
[2:09:23] justification under Luther scientific
[2:09:26] ation on the Wesley the baptism of the
[2:09:28] Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it
[2:09:30] is in the last day performing and doing
[2:09:32] the same very things that it did when it
[2:09:34] was in Christ what is it the church and
[2:09:36] Christ has become one and as soon listen
[2:09:40] as they connect together that last link
[2:09:43] she'll go to the sky shorten up will
[2:09:47] come Wesley Luther and all the rest of
[2:09:49] them black indoors dear here so where
[2:09:52] the Branham is speaking of a connection
[2:09:54] that is yet to come
[2:09:55] not a connection in the message but the
[2:09:58] connection between Christ and his bride
[2:10:00] and when that connection takes place
[2:10:03] this greatest connection then whew as
[2:10:08] soon as they connect together
[2:10:12] soon as it happens but a brand of
[2:10:14] clothes at that last link there have
[2:10:17] been many links through the ages where
[2:10:19] there's a last link and the moment that
[2:10:21] link takes place the moment a connection
[2:10:24] takes place up welcome wear sleep I will
[2:10:26] come loose look I will come with a
[2:10:28] random I will come the sleeping seats
[2:10:30] and we leave shouting they will come the

[2:12:07] bunch of your nominations but God don't
[2:12:09] want you filled with that God be the

[2:12:54] Creed's you're only building yourself a
[2:12:57] Babylon that's going to fall if you fill
[2:12:59] yourself up with a muddled world and you
[2:13:01] can substitute this with connection if

[2:23:06] connection there's no power without
[2:23:09] connection he said I am the vine you are

[2:23:14] branches getting the perfect connection
[2:23:17] watch the sign seek please watch the
[2:23:19] wonders take place and that's why church
[2:23:24] we are fighting to place the word where
[2:23:28] it should be because without the word in
[2:23:32] perfect position the spirit cannot flow
[2:23:35] freely gotta be part wood can it be our
[2:23:40] interpretation can it be our idea can be
[2:23:43] man's idea that's why God sent the
[2:23:46] Prophet we would have one profitable
[2:23:49] there's no profit prevalent half some
[2:23:52] secondary profit some profits of no
[2:23:54] there's only one messenger
[2:23:55] we're before the beginning God put seven
[2:23:59] stars in his hands and they were
[2:24:01] connected to him forever
[2:24:02] Paul arenas Latin Columba loser leslie
[2:24:06] stars and then a great stop
[2:24:11] so greater when John saw this stop he
[2:24:15] bow to worship and the stasi I'm just a
[2:24:18] prophet like you my revelation may have
[2:24:21] insider you don't have but worship God
[2:24:26] the Prophet was so connected that the
[2:24:32] prophet of God back in Abraham's day and
[2:24:34] described it was a dusty day when these
[2:24:38] men came walking up to Abraham that
[2:24:40] buffeted walk and
[2:24:42] that's how connected he was he can look
[2:24:46] at this a hottie right and discern and
[2:24:48] see whatever you asked you could have it
[2:24:51] that prophet was so connected that he
[2:24:55] could look there he said one day the
[2:24:56] Messi will look washed up but I see a
[2:24:59] bride called I see a bride all somebody
[2:25:02] help me this morning greatest connection
[2:25:17] and just think you may be seated the
[2:25:20] connection that supposed to happen it's
[2:25:23] never happened before what did I process
[2:25:30] it a little bit sister Melissa the
[2:25:33] connection that's about to happen
[2:25:35] has never happened before
[2:25:43] what is the first time that people will
[2:25:46] walk the earth and their bodies will get
[2:25:49] changed
[2:25:51] Enoch was one man but in this day it's a
[2:25:54] whole bunch of people the devil and no
[2:25:59] what about the air terminal everything
[2:26:01] determine I got a headache when Jesus
[2:26:02] died because Jesus said
[2:26:07] [Applause]
[2:26:13] if God wanted Jesus gonna finish it ever
[2:26:16] then and if God wants it but he didn't
[2:26:19] one that he said listen I didn't need to
[2:26:21] finish it I can send my wife to finish
[2:26:22] it
[2:26:22] I don't even finish it
[2:26:28] I'm gonna let my bride come and kick you
[2:26:31] here kick you here but I bounce it is
[2:26:34] more pointy little finger in this bribe
[2:26:36] in her little finger but a Branham said
[2:26:38] you can't make this stuff up but a
[2:26:40] little finger is more power than
[2:26:42] auditable as God has confidence in this
[2:26:46] bribe to defeat cancer
[2:26:49] God has confidence in this pride the
[2:26:52] cancer diseases court has confidence in
[2:26:55] this bride to bring on the resurrection
[2:27:04] I'm looking for that day I'm looking for
[2:27:07] that day I'm looking for that day the
[2:27:09] greatest connection you may be seated
[2:27:16] I'm trying to close out where we are
[2:27:19] and even think be this wrong it's a lot
[2:27:26] more food and all this thing is
[2:27:27] inexhaustible inner whatever I say I see
[2:27:30] they approach we become a super Church
[2:27:32] as we nearly have stole the Mirren is
[2:27:35] waiting for the connection I know as
[2:27:37] you're near your super Church imagine
[2:27:40] when they connect I don't know what you
[2:27:41] call a church beyond a super church
[2:27:42] because he's he'll be a super church as
[2:27:44] an eerie headstone when they connect you
[2:27:46] beyond super but it was any power base
[2:27:53] so greatest Wilcock continent if Albert
[2:27:57] Einstein was here he would say this is
[2:27:58] different this is not just quantum this
[2:28:00] yet even a new name for his level of
[2:28:02] entanglement because the chemical
[2:28:04] explosion will take place when this
[2:28:06] bride comes into power you imagine the
[2:28:09] greatest connection take place and we
[2:28:11] just have to walk in the hospital rooms
[2:28:12] if pizza wasn't part of the greatest
[2:28:16] connection he was part of a great
[2:28:18] connection because the Alpha Church was
[2:28:20] just a taste of what the Omega judgment
[2:28:23] and people were healing Peters shadow
[2:28:25] brother you walk in from the hospital on
[2:28:28] your way to work and sick people just
[2:28:31] get healed people that's what we're
[2:28:36] talking about
[2:28:36] listen you may be seated you know in
[2:28:39] Azusa Street revival that wasn't
[2:28:42] greatest connection you profit hadn't
[2:28:43] even come yet and in Azusa Street time
[2:28:46] people as their bandit corner start to
[2:28:48] get convicted fell to their knees
[2:28:50] surrender to God didn't even make it to
[2:28:53] the building yet and it was a great
[2:28:54] connection how much were the greatest
[2:28:56] connection that the world has ever seen
[2:28:59] when Christ unites with his bride unite
[2:29:02] with his church give the Lord a shout of
[2:29:04] praise I'm finished musicians could come
[2:29:08] [Applause]
[2:29:13] last few coats position get ready we are
[2:29:16] united then as one we weren't first no
[2:29:19] more all this fussing what quote what
[2:29:21] quote what quote what scripture who
[2:29:23] writes who are you back said it
[2:29:25] addressed who only francelina said who
[2:29:26] ended I said who is disease as a all
[2:29:28] emphasis born because when Christ unites
[2:29:37] with this bride
[2:29:38] it'll speak for itself you don't need to
[2:29:40] explain it you need to what is it it's
[2:29:46] fulfilled and you'll see it you will see
[2:29:49] the signs you see the wonders will act
[2:29:52] like man I want a pair will act like my
[2:29:54] not being born me to make you a man you
[2:29:56] know but this great connection but I say
[2:29:59] we act like man we'll just like man only
[2:30:02] when he creeps again I tend to be really
[2:30:04] just like a man
[2:30:05] we may not even know what that really
[2:30:06] means yet but I think that we'll just
[2:30:07] like man then come on now
[2:30:09] we'll just like women sons and totally
[2:30:11] what our character our conduct our faith
[2:30:14] will proof when court says anything will
[2:30:17] say Amen to it if the Bible says for us
[2:30:21] to do certain things we'll do it we
[2:30:23] won't argue back we just go and do it
[2:30:27] that's what God wants us United on oh
[2:30:30] how we ought to act in this present day
[2:30:34] oh my my my my my last few coats you can
[2:30:44] really play something softly God will
[2:30:46] have a church it's not far down the road
[2:30:49] we will be one our purpose will be one
[2:30:53] like the Great Temple when it went
[2:30:55] together there wasn't a buzz of the saw
