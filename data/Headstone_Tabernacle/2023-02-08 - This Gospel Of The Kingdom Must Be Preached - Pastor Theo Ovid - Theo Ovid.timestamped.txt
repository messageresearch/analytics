[31:09] pillar of fire rest on my shoulder and
[31:11] speak out to your people tonight in
[31:13] Jesus name I ask it
[31:15] scripture
[31:21] uh Matthew 24 I want to read verse 1 to
[31:24] 14 Luke 16 16.
[31:27] and have a contextual you sit down and
[31:29] I'll read it afterwards but uh Matthew
[31:31] 24 reading from verse 1. and Jesus went
[31:34] out
[31:36] and departed from the temple and the
[31:38] disciples came to him for to show him
[31:40] the buildings
[31:41] of the Temple
[31:43] and Jesus said unto them see not all
[31:46] these things
[31:47] very relation to you they shall not be
[31:49] left here one stone upon another
[31:52] thy shall not be thrown down
[31:54] and as he said upon the Mount of Olives
[31:56] the disciples came under him privately
[31:58] saying tell us when shall these things
[31:59] be one two what shall be the sign of thy
[32:02] coming three and of the end of the world
[32:06] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[32:08] take heed
[32:09] that no man deceive you
[32:12] for many shall come in my name saying I
[32:14] am Christ shall deceive many you shall
[32:17] hear the Wars rumors of War see that
[32:20] he'd be not troubled for all these
[32:22] things must come to pass but the end is
[32:26] not yet
[32:27] for nation shall rise against Nation
[32:29] Kingdom against Kingdom they shall be
[32:32] famines pestilences and earthquakes in
[32:35] diverse places
[32:36] all these at the beginning of Sorrows
[32:39] then shall deliver you to be afflicted
[32:42] shall kill you and he shall be hated of
[32:44] all Nations for my name's sake and then
[32:46] shall many be offended and shall
[32:49] betrayed one another shall hate one
[32:51] another and many false prophets shall
[32:54] arise dishes that have deceived many
[32:57] and because the iniquity shall abound
[33:00] the love of many shall Works whole but
[33:04] he that shall endure until the end the
[33:06] same shall be saved and this Gospel of
[33:09] the Kingdom
[33:10] shall be preached in all the world for a
[33:13] witness unto all nations and then shall
[33:17] the End come amen I read in Luke 16 16
[33:21] familiar scripture the law and the
[33:23] prophets wanted John
[33:25] since that time the kingdom of God is
[33:27] preached and every man presented me God
[33:30] blesses what you may be seated
[33:32] praise the Lord
[33:34] and I have a context scripture and that
[33:36] can take scriptures from Luke chapter 11
[33:38] 1 to 13. I want to read it no just to
[33:41] follow within what we want to share
[33:43] tonight what God put Upon Our Hearts so
[33:45] Luke chapter 11 verse 1 says and it came
[33:47] to pass
[33:49] as he was praying in a certain place
[33:51] when he exists
[33:54] one of the disciples said unto him Lord
[33:56] teach us to pray as John taught his
[34:00] disciples
[34:01] he said unto them when you pray see Our
[34:04] Father which art in heaven
[34:05] Hallowed be thy name
[34:07] thy kingdom will come thy will be done
[34:10] as in heaven so in Earth give us day by
[34:14] day or Daily Bread
[34:15] forgive us our trespasses forgive us our
[34:18] sins for we also forgive everyone that
[34:22] is indebted to us
[34:23] and lead us not into temptation
[34:26] but Deliver Us from all evil note no
[34:29] arrogance no I am bride and this and you
[34:33] know no no no no no no no no no
[34:36] he says
[34:38] and lead us not into temptation but
[34:40] Deliver Us from all evil he said unto
[34:42] them now right after this prayer he said
[34:46] unto them which of you shall have a
[34:48] friend
[34:49] so so in other words he's bringing adept
[34:53] of in prayer
[34:55] that is hidden in a story
[34:59] a mystery hidden in a parable like a
[35:02] story he said now which of you shall
[35:05] have a friend and shall go on to him at
[35:06] midnight and send him friend lend me
[35:09] tree loose for a friend of mine is in
[35:11] his journey is come to me I have nothing
[35:14] set before him and he from within shall
[35:16] answer and said trouble me not the door
[35:18] is now shut and my children are with me
[35:20] in bed I cannot rise and give thee
[35:23] I say unto you though he will not rise
[35:26] and give him because he's his friend you
[35:29] know he's like what a friend we have
[35:32] in Jesus
[35:34] though he's a friend watch this he said
[35:37] now yet because of his opportunity or
[35:42] persistence or perseverance or nagging
[35:46] or not something knocking he said he
[35:49] will rise and give him as many as he
[35:50] needed and I say unto you
[35:53] oh that's how we bring the prayer I say
[35:56] unto you this is all you're going to do
[35:58] it this is how you're gonna get through
[35:59] ask
[36:01] and it shall be given unto you seek ye
[36:03] shall find knock and it shall be open
[36:05] unto you then you drain long deeper for
[36:07] everyone to ask it receive it you say
[36:10] acts 1 ask it receive it he that Seeker
[36:13] shall find and he that knock shall be
[36:15] opened to you Hallelujah for everyone
[36:18] that has got receive it he that seek it
[36:19] final and hinder knock it it shall be
[36:21] open
[36:24] a lazy man is totally messed up
[36:28] he ain't knocking he ain't asking he had
[36:31] seeking he just looking for handouts
[36:35] feeling entitled in the message because
[36:37] he have some books and tips
[36:39] but in further the next verse Jesus said
[36:42] no this is deep
[36:44] and it's not like we don't know this now
[36:45] we know it but I'm trusting the Lord
[36:47] bring a fresh
[36:49] oil on this tonight to you
[36:51] forever what if a son shall ask bread of
[36:55] any of you that is a father will he give
[36:56] him a stone
[36:58] or if he asks a fish could he give him a
[37:00] fish a zipper or if he has an egg with
[37:03] him a scorpion if he then being evil
[37:06] know how to give good gifts unto your
[37:09] children how much more shall your
[37:11] heavenly father give the Holy Ghost to
[37:15] them that
[37:16] ask him
[37:17] and he said how to ask ask it
[37:20] seek it knock it hold glory to God so
[37:23] Jesus put it inside of here you want to
[37:25] make the Rapture you want to get the bro
[37:27] you want to be part of the Bride you
[37:28] have to get the oil the oil is the
[37:30] spirit you have to get the spirit the
[37:32] spirit of the Holy Ghost you're going to
[37:33] get it if you're getting the atmosphere
[37:35] of it you won't get it if you don't ask
[37:37] for it he said how much more the
[37:39] heavenly father will give the Holy
[37:41] Spirit to them that ask him this
[37:43] scripture can't lie this scripture can
[37:45] fail this is the truth you could you
[37:48] could rest your soul on this we could
[37:50] close off here tonight oh glory to God

[44:25] Hallelujah this Gospel of the Kingdom
[44:29] must be preached let's go let's go
[44:32] tonight
[44:33] let's get to work tonight all right
[44:36] let me go
[44:38] the gospel
[44:40] commonly believed
[44:42] is the word of God
[44:45] and that is true in one sense
[44:47] but the word of God
[44:50] is not gospel alone
[44:53] the word of God is the seed that
[44:57] produces
[44:58] the gospel
[45:00] remember what the prophet said I would
[45:02] just want to lay the seed
[45:04] I hope men rise up to break more sense
[45:07] to it and people are stuck there and
[45:09] think it's a set of nonsense
[45:11] he said I hope they raise up and bring
[45:13] more sense to it I am just going to lay
[45:16] the seed he didn't stop there and I hope
[45:19] they make it come to life
[45:23] so I seed by definition of a seed is
[45:26] dead
[45:31] foreign if it's hard if it's dry you can
[45:35] put it here you could store it for five
[45:36] years six years ten years how much years
[45:38] is a seed
[45:39] when you put it in the right
[45:40] circumstance and environment and the
[45:42] rainfall and break it up you see Life
[45:43] come out the seed I hope
[45:47] that they could make it come to life
[45:49] and when they said they just let the
[45:51] passage of ministers everybody
[45:53] in other words we have to become the
[45:54] Living Word
[45:55] if I've written word if I have Living
[45:57] Word it's not the same thing you read
[46:00] the Bible it's the word it's the written
[46:01] word when the word become flesh is the
[46:04] Living Word
[46:05] because they started Living you and the
[46:07] world become flesh by the spirit oh give
[46:09] the Lord a shout when the spirits had to
[46:12] activate and work through You by you in
[46:15] you then that's the word become flesh
[46:17] then you yourself become the Living Word
[46:19] could we continue so the word of God is
[46:22] the seed that produces the gospel
[46:27] so Jesus said a sorrow and fought to sow
[46:29] seed and some fell in the Stony places
[46:31] some fell on the wee side the Falls of
[46:33] the edifawed them some fell on Stony
[46:36] existed ground and went over and brought
[46:38] a hundredfold
[46:40] now the seed you people here who are
[46:42] farmers every seed we produce if it is
[46:44] the right kind of ground and every
[46:46] Divine promise of God in the Bible will
[46:49] produce if it is met in the right kind
[46:51] of a heart it will produce the promise
[46:57] the entire messenger and message should
[46:59] meet the end time conditions
[47:01] should meet
[47:02] because we have in time conditions
[47:05] don't you think so
[47:06] this message could not have been
[47:08] preached 40 years ago no the entire
[47:11] message and messenger has got to meet
[47:13] back there in them days they had
[47:14] probably would have worked but it got to
[47:16] quote the end time conditions
[47:19] be converted believe the gospel sign
[47:21] that's the message of the day wash your
[47:24] souls in the blood of the Lamb believe
[47:26] the gospel that the end time signs are
[47:28] here the seed of the Gospel has been
[47:31] taking place
[47:33] the seed of the Gospel have been taking
[47:36] place we couldn't preach the gospel
[47:38] without his seed because the originals
[47:40] he come to our prophet
[47:41] so the Pentecostal couldn't really
[47:42] preach the the seed they have they
[47:44] rejected the prophet and the seed common
[47:46] books and tapes to call it a bride to
[47:48] receive seed what's the secret the word
[47:51] is in the bride so the word have to come
[47:52] into the bride which will be the seed
[47:54] hearers of the entire Bible
[47:57] that God that's what the conflict on the
[47:58] preach in you tonight have a pyramid in

[48:27] said my word shall not return unto me
[48:29] void it shall accomplish the purpose I
[48:32] sent it for to accomplishment Oh Glory

[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:06] they just want to survive
[1:01:09] that's what I mean I mean one time he
[1:01:13] said very good he said no way
[1:01:15] did they eat somebody who's hungry and
[1:01:16] then he said way up to nothing here
[1:01:19] under here
[1:01:20] women and sleep
[1:01:25] no guidance no future no decision no
[1:01:28] prophecy nothing
[1:01:30] what a waste of life
[1:01:32] live and die like I never lived
[1:01:38] God's kingdom is not of this Earth
[1:01:42] God's kingdom is in our hearts
[1:01:45] it's a spiritual Kingdom and we are born
[1:01:47] into it
[1:01:48] Jesus said the kingdom of God comes but
[1:01:52] not without violence
[1:01:55] who said that
[1:01:57] Jesus said that
[1:01:59] look at all violence the violent take
[1:02:01] advice
[1:02:02] Force
[1:02:06] so they learn the kingdom to watch hey
[1:02:08] are you going I'm watching
[1:02:11] I'm watching Holy Queen
[1:02:13] some people say another music
[1:02:20] we hiding nothing
[1:02:21] look look keep watching
[1:02:23] you could see or we moving the kingdom
[1:02:26] is preached and every man
[1:02:32] that word is missing in the message
[1:02:35] so I had to press it as stressful it is
[1:02:39] terrible is devastating because people
[1:02:42] are spiritually contented by what they
[1:02:44] know intellectually
[1:02:46] they are I say this way they are
[1:02:48] intellectually satisfied
[1:02:50] but their soul is empty
[1:02:59] the Holy Spirit God's kingdom moving in
[1:03:01] the man and governing and controlling
[1:03:04] him that's the kingdom
[1:03:09] listen closely First Corinthians 4 20
[1:03:12] says the kingdom of God is his word made
[1:03:16] Power
[1:03:18] if you want to put that down first
[1:03:20] Corinthians 4 20 the kingdom of God is
[1:03:23] God's word made Power
[1:03:28] other than that you're teaching patient
[1:03:30] message
[1:03:31] the Christian Bible you're preaching
[1:03:33] seed but the kingdom
[1:03:36] what's up with Kingdom
[1:03:38] is the word
[1:03:40] made Power what is the kingdom of God
[1:03:43] it's within you the kingdom in you and
[1:03:46] when the word comes in dear what does
[1:03:48] this word begin it turns itself into
[1:03:50] Power making it see just exactly what it
[1:03:53] said
[1:03:56] so the word said the spirit of God
[1:03:58] anointed me to do this that and the
[1:04:00] other that was written in Isaiah 61
[1:04:03] Jesus found the place where it is
[1:04:05] written he came to the temple read the
[1:04:07] scripture and said this day what you're
[1:04:09] reading here is present tense

[1:04:21] of these days that same thing gonna
[1:04:23] repeat it wouldn't be a text it wouldn't

[1:20:20] the water
[1:20:21] because the preachers have a channel to
[1:20:23] open up that the Holy Spirit can move in
[1:20:26] so they reject the preacher they reject
[1:20:27] the water
[1:20:29] that's why we have to have the gifts and
[1:20:31] people bringing inspiration and
[1:20:33] Revelation and the guest being being
[1:20:34] unfolded all right let's continue now we
[1:20:37] want to help you he never said this
[1:20:39] gospel he didn't say go teach the word
[1:20:41] but preach the word there's a lot of
[1:20:43] difference the gospel is the power and
[1:20:46] demonstration of the word
[1:21:03] artificial intelligence and all the
[1:21:05] explanations
[1:21:10] I haven't preach and they say nothing in
[1:21:11] the message I told him

[1:21:15] Prophet if I don't hear all that
[1:21:17] information you're peddling without
[1:21:18] anything from this message then God

[1:23:21] Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:23:24] watch
[1:23:25] [Music]
[1:23:26] the holy spirit being poured out in the
[1:23:28] last days
[1:23:30] you believe it's been poured out
[1:23:32] poured out somebody is sowing seeds to
[1:23:36] bring forth this Latter-Day crop you
[1:23:39] know what Joel said the Holy Spirit has
[1:23:42] reported on what on seeds
[1:23:46] he know these seeds will have a Harvest
[1:23:48] Time Oh Glory to God Amen am I just
[1:23:51] stick inside of here talking about
[1:23:53] there's the guy this was preached after
[1:23:55] the starting perfect man he said don't
[1:23:57] forget now that these are the things
[1:23:59] that build the servant of Christ
[1:24:00] faithfuls don't vote you but remember
[1:24:03] the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building
[1:24:05] of God until these things are operating
[1:24:07] by the spirit
[1:24:09] so you put a qualifier here not
[1:24:11] operating by Revelation but by the
[1:24:13] spirit that means the spirit itself have
[1:24:15] to come to work the virtues
[1:24:17] not the Revelation that people choose
[1:24:19] not that
[1:24:21] Spirit has itself have to operate
[1:24:24] virtues
[1:24:27] now if we don't see these things we
[1:24:29] can't be shooting them if we don't catch
[1:24:31] this thing we can see they don't you
[1:24:32] know you have to see this this is the
[1:24:33] word now you know there's an eye
[1:24:34] preacher for 40 years what is that
[1:24:38] do you understand when Moses come and
[1:24:40] say take the blood and take the lamb all
[1:24:41] them post them fellas had with something
[1:24:43] and that Revelation and they serve on
[1:24:44] something like that that become null and
[1:24:46] void
[1:24:48] a man say yes he didn't let upon your
[1:24:50] blood because you're in a long time in
[1:24:51] the church and what doesn't think and
[1:24:52] Moses can come and tell them that he had
[1:24:54] taken that is
[1:24:55] eating self
[1:25:02] because you can't go back to you and
[1:25:05] claim some kind of historical thing you
[1:25:07] have to see what was present tense I'm
[1:25:09] presenting with lamb blood apply it
[1:25:11] because when I see the blood not man
[1:25:13] talk when I see the blood I will pass
[1:25:16] over you and today when you see the
[1:25:18] spirit operate him which is the token
[1:25:21] oh give the Lord some Praises you know
[1:25:23] where you're going I'm gonna pass when I
[1:25:24] see when you see I have books and tapes
[1:25:26] that's a lie and if he's just saying
[1:25:28] that they're lying to the people get out
[1:25:30] from them leave them
[1:25:33] and people run from the group somewhere
[1:25:34] and run out today get it past 30 days to
[1:25:36] repent if you don't repent we run for
[1:25:38] your life
[1:25:39] all right watch
[1:25:42] so watch
[1:25:44] until these things are operated by the
[1:25:46] spirit no matter what you do now those
[1:25:48] are the things that builds the body of
[1:25:50] Christ now don't forget that now foolish
[1:25:53] your faith virtue knowledge so forth it
[1:25:55] should be added to it until the complete
[1:25:58] status crisis made manifest
[1:26:00] then
[1:26:01] the Holy Spirit comes upon it
[1:26:05] and seals it as one body
[1:26:08] these things must be
[1:26:11] therefore Jesus said by their fruit they
[1:26:14] are known see fruit you could not bear
[1:26:17] fruit without these things they buried
[1:26:19] in you
[1:26:20] and then when all this takes the place
[1:26:23] of williness and ungodliness and so
[1:26:25] forth then all unbelief is cast out then
[1:26:29] all the things of the world is passed
[1:26:30] away then there's nothing but a new
[1:26:32] creature in Christ then Ephesians 4 30
[1:26:35] says grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:26:37] whereby you are sealed to that day of
[1:26:40] your Redemption see healed into the
[1:26:42] kingdom of God so now the introduce a
[1:26:46] new word
[1:26:47] sealed in the Kingdom
[1:26:49] you press
[1:26:53] when you got silly and they know
[1:26:56] sealed into the kingdom
[1:26:58] he called out you become a seal
[1:27:01] seal of the Lord God
[1:27:02] when you have these virtues in you then
[1:27:05] the sons have Vindicated and placed
[1:27:07] oh then they become Vindicated sons and
[1:27:10] Vindicated daughters not just I believe
[1:27:12] the message no Vindicated Sons
[1:27:14] syndicated daughters this is my beloved
[1:27:16] Son in whom I'm well pleased here I am
[1:27:17] because I'm with him
[1:27:19] I'm vindicating him really imagine
[1:27:23] oh my God that could be trouble
[1:27:27] keep that in mind now
[1:27:29] take these things first
[1:27:32] talking about these virtues right then
[1:27:34] the ceiling is the Holy Spirit
[1:27:38] now we have faith with your knowledge
[1:27:39] Temperance patience Godly spiritually
[1:27:40] kindness top of that half Holy Spirit
[1:27:42] slot the ceiling is the Holy Spirit the
[1:27:47] cup
[1:27:48] that seals us into the body
[1:27:51] what must we come out of
[1:27:53] doctrines that make the word of God of
[1:27:56] no effect
[1:27:58] people teaching but it have no effect on
[1:28:01] the people
[1:28:02] for change work or change life
[1:28:05] Matthew 15 79 Jesus busted them he said
[1:28:08] you Hypocrites well did his eyes
[1:28:11] prophesy of you saying these people join
[1:28:13] nigh unto me with their mouth
[1:28:15] and honor me with their lips but the
[1:28:18] heart is far for me
[1:28:19] what in vain do they worship me teaching
[1:28:23] for doctrines
[1:28:25] the Commandments of man
[1:28:27] Prophet said he said no the bride has
[1:28:30] another Revival yet
[1:28:32] there have been a Revival there to no
[1:28:34] manifestation of goddess to the bride so
[1:28:36] he tied Revival with manifestation of
[1:28:39] God
[1:28:40] not Revelations
[1:28:42] not messages
[1:28:44] but but manifestation of God and this
[1:28:47] time with what he said he said what we
[1:28:48] see should make a church that will make
[1:28:50] a Revival people flying from everywhere
[1:28:52] he said the seven Thunders as being
[1:28:54] manifested
[1:28:55] yeah we say you know see Watch the Bride
[1:28:58] has not Revival yet they know you're
[1:28:59] ever there no manifestation of gods to
[1:29:01] the brain we are looking for it
[1:29:07] so if they're not preaching that day
[1:29:08] people look at it they hear every other
[1:29:10] thing about this we are looking for it
[1:29:14] it will take those seven Thunders back
[1:29:17] there to wake up again he
[1:29:19] will send it
[1:29:22] if you look for it you ain't gonna get
[1:29:24] it he said he will send it watch watch
[1:29:27] he was send it he promised it
[1:29:30] now what she was dead talking about the
[1:29:32] bride now if the churches would forget
[1:29:34] their greeds right now tonight forget
[1:29:36] their dogmas and take the Bible
[1:29:40] and plead the promise then it would
[1:29:43] become effective to them
[1:29:44] so once they get a promise and they say
[1:29:46] Lord you promise to heal me you promise
[1:29:48] to deliver me you promised to refine me
[1:29:50] you promised to fill me the Holy Ghost
[1:29:51] you promise and you can't lie Lord you
[1:29:53] have to keep your promise you are guilty
[1:29:55] until you bring your promise to pass
[1:29:58] foreign
[1:30:00] [Music]
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:02] God are feeling weak but you promised
[1:30:04] the people that know their God shall be
[1:30:05] strong and do good experts Lord

[1:30:22] pressing on on on I will glory to God
[1:30:25] I'm confessing I'm Climbing Jacob's
[1:30:27] Ladder from Faith to Virtue the
[1:30:29] knowledge the tempers the patience the
[1:30:31] calling us the brotherly kindness I am
[1:30:32] pleading a promise I'm not saying I'd
[1:30:34] like a dumb dog in Israel I'm saying
[1:30:36] nothing I'm keeping silent I'm claiming
[1:30:38] my promises Oh Glory to God I'm eating

[1:30:44] promise you breakthrough I am prophesied
[1:30:46] hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:30:49] Glory
[1:30:51] if the churches would forget their
[1:30:53] Creeds forget their dogmas and take the
[1:30:55] Bible and plead the promise it will
[1:30:57] become effective to them but Jesus said
[1:31:00] you with your Traditions make the word
[1:31:01] of God of non-effect Oh Glory to God
[1:31:05] hallelujah glory to God praise God
[1:31:08] praise God we are good tonight I'm on

[1:32:09] else this might have a big dog in front
[1:32:11] he hopes this man a protection and a
[1:32:13] steel gate and all kind of protection I
[1:32:15] can't go there's right here going and he
[1:32:17] stayed there so God I had to get rid of
[1:32:19] this man you know Mommy wants to take
[1:32:21] that take that hold that take that and
[1:32:23] don't come back that's okay I have it
[1:32:25] for I want and Jesus call that
[1:32:27] importunity call that persistence call
[1:32:29] that perseverance call after the bride
[1:32:32] shall not God avenge his elect who cried
[1:32:35] day and night after him when the Solomon
[1:32:38] cometh shall we find faith on the earth
[1:32:40] oh give the Lord some Praises somebody
[1:32:43] gonna press somebody gonna ask somebody
[1:32:45] gonna seek
[1:32:47] Glory
[1:32:48] press into the kingdom not just the same
[1:32:51] the kingdom is here but to get into it
[1:32:54] brother Branham they always hear people
[1:32:57] the time is here I see this you can
[1:32:59] brand me a fanatic if you wish to I
[1:33:01] believe that this indicates the second
[1:33:03] coming of Jesus Christ for there will be
[1:33:05] signs and wonders and the thing of it is
[1:33:06] if you are not in the kingdom of God
[1:33:09] press into it
[1:33:11] surely I would have some knowledge of
[1:33:12] what I'm speaking of God would never
[1:33:14] honor my prayer to do what he does and
[1:33:16] you outside the kingdom seek Christ as
[1:33:18] your Refuge while it is time while you
[1:33:21] have the opportunity the kingdom
[1:33:23] desperation when those secrecy without
[1:33:25] all thy heart then I'll hear you the
[1:33:28] kingdom he said the law and the prophet
[1:33:30] until John since that time the kingdom
[1:33:31] of God is preached and man presented you
[1:33:33] don't just turn around and say pick me
[1:33:35] up by the color Lord push me in you
[1:33:37] presented you get desperate between life
[1:33:40] and death Noah's family seeing that the
[1:33:43] father good man was spawning away his
[1:33:44] sons his daughters-in-law so far
[1:33:46] compound away with him behind the report
[1:33:48] of the word you always have to do that
[1:33:49] the kingdom of God doesn't come without
[1:33:52] trials
[1:33:56] if you don't want trials walk out go
[1:33:58] back forget our Holy Kingdom the kingdom
[1:34:01] of God doesn't come without trials men
[1:34:03] press into it into the kingdom of God
[1:34:05] not observation
[1:34:11] so that's the positive part
[1:34:13] we want to go to the negative part
[1:34:15] because Gospel of the Kingdom have two
[1:34:16] parts in it
[1:34:18] it have the power to save to deliver to
[1:34:22] redeem to get the last name on the book
[1:34:25] but there's another part which is to
[1:34:28] preach to the Eternal loss the same
[1:34:30] gospel of the Kingdom
[1:34:32] people that cannot change
[1:34:34] people who have crossed the line people
[1:34:36] who cannot be saved have to hear
[1:34:39] this gospel
[1:34:44] maybe not only here they're going to see
[1:34:46] it
[1:34:47] they might see it live on the internet
[1:34:49] you must eat some tape
[1:34:50] the gospel you can't kill the ministry
[1:34:53] it lives on
[1:34:55] you could put the messenger to sleep but
[1:34:56] you can't put the message
[1:34:57] it is on notice the third pull of his
[1:35:00] ministry the first was healing second
[1:35:02] was rebuking the organization and
[1:35:04] prophesying
[1:35:06] so prophecy
[1:35:08] comes under the second Pole
[1:35:11] Revolution can eat go to the angels give
[1:35:15] me a little book take it easy
[1:35:17] almost prophesy again prophecy is under
[1:35:21] the second pull
[1:35:25] his turtle was when he preached a loss
[1:35:27] that couldn't be saved no more they were
[1:35:29] done there big painted eyes preached to
[1:35:32] the souls in hell that did not accept
[1:35:34] mercy and there were eternally separate
[1:35:37] from the presence of God but yet they
[1:35:39] had to recognize it what he was because
[1:35:41] God was him that's there I wonder if
[1:35:44] this ministry climbs out the same way in
[1:35:46] this last day
[1:35:47] as my father sent me so send that you
[1:35:49] the works that I do shall do also
[1:35:51] he healed the sick
[1:35:54] his second Ministry he was prophesying
[1:35:58] his third Ministry was preaching to his
[1:36:00] laws
[1:36:01] what do we say the faithful Ministry is
[1:36:05] the ministry of Jesus Christ in the form
[1:36:08] of Pastor teacher Prophet evangelist
[1:36:10] apostle
[1:36:11] it's not man's Ministry it is Christ
[1:36:15] Ministry and Christ's Ministry had a
[1:36:17] first pull a second pull and a turtle
[1:36:20] so when Jesus said this gospel is going
[1:36:22] to be preached he himself will preach it
[1:36:26] it could be Jesus Christ back again in
[1:36:29] bright form
[1:36:30] okay the Lord some praises
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:35] it was Jesus saying the spirit is upon
[1:36:38] me it was Jesus stopping in the middle
[1:36:39] of the sentence to preach the acceptably
[1:36:41] of the Lord and it will be Jesus
[1:36:43] continuing to declare to the offensions
[1:36:45] of our God through our pride of Jesus
[1:36:47] it'll be Jesus doing that
[1:36:49] this same gospel
[1:36:53] one of these days
[1:36:56] if you haven't already
[1:36:58] you will cross that line
[1:37:00] you will never desire no more to do what
[1:37:02] is right
[1:37:03] did you hear what I just said
[1:37:05] brother sister do you realize what's
[1:37:08] been said
[1:37:09] you will cross that line
[1:37:11] you will never want to do it you will
[1:37:14] still hear the gospel sure you would
[1:37:16] never accept it you can't accept it but
[1:37:19] the gospel will be preached to the
[1:37:20] doomed
[1:37:21] those that are eternally lost
[1:37:23] can't get saved no more
[1:37:26] you already in that spot and don't know
[1:37:28] it you think you are living in pleasure
[1:37:30] I'm dead while you're alive
[1:37:32] what was amazing me I had this message
[1:37:33] prepared
[1:37:35] and I took a rest took a rest before
[1:37:37] coming up and so on and as I woke up
[1:37:40] this came to me that I have to put this
[1:37:42] in
[1:37:42] and ashamed of my wife I said it's
[1:37:45] amazing I was able to take a rest I want
[1:37:48] to get up just getting up and she put
[1:37:50] this eternal loss inside of here because
[1:37:53] this is fact this is completed about
[1:37:55] this gospel to be preached because it's
[1:37:57] showing you who is preaching to
[1:37:59] oh hallelujah praise God listen all the
[1:38:03] order
[1:38:04] the gospels preached the Doom first
[1:38:06] before they went no one shut up with the
