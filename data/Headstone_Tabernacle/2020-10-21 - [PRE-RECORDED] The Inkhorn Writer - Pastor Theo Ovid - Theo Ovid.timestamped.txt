[29:02] to be here
[29:04] amen isaiah 66
[29:09] 8 who had heard such a thing
[29:12] who has seen such a saying shall the
[29:15] earth be made to bring forth in one day
[29:18] or shall a nation be born at once for as
[29:21] soon as zion traveled
[29:24] she brought forth her children
[29:27] ezekiel chapter 9 reading from verse 1.
[29:31] he cried also in my ears with a lord
[29:33] voice saying
[29:35] cause them that have charged over the
[29:38] city
[29:38] to draw near even every man with his
[29:42] destroying weapon in his hand
[29:44] and behold six men came from the way of
[29:46] the higher gate
[29:48] which lie towards the north and every
[29:50] man a slaughter weapon in his hand
[29:53] and one man among them was cruel with
[29:56] linen
[29:57] with a writer's incorn by his side
[30:01] and they went in and stood beside the
[30:03] brazen altar
[30:05] and the glory of the god of israel had
[30:07] gone up from the cherub whereupon he was
[30:10] to the churchill of the house and he
[30:12] called to the man clothed with linen
[30:14] which had the writer's incorn by his
[30:17] side
[30:18] and the lord said unto him go
[30:22] to the midst of the city through the
[30:25] midst of jerusalem
[30:27] and set a mark upon the foreheads
[30:31] of the men that sigh and that cry
[30:34] for all the abominations that be done in
[30:37] the midst thereof
[30:39] and to the others he said in my hearing
[30:42] go ye after him to the city and smite
[30:46] let not your eyes spear neither have
[30:50] utterly old and young
[30:55] boat maids and little children and
[30:58] women but come not near any man
[31:02] upon whom is the mark and begin at my
[31:05] sanctuary

[31:09] were before the house
[31:11] our last scripture is from revelation
[31:13] chapter seven
[31:14] you want to read from verse one and
[31:17] after these things i saw four angels
[31:19] standing on the four corners of the
[31:20] earth
[31:21] holding the four winds of the earth that
[31:24] the wind should not blow on the earth
[31:26] nor on the sea nor on any tree
[31:30] and i saw another angel ascending from
[31:32] the east
[31:33] having the seal of the living god and he
[31:36] cried with a loud voice to the four
[31:37] angels to whom it was given
[31:39] to her the earth and the sea
[31:42] saying hood not the earth neither the
[31:44] sea
[31:45] nor the trees till we have sealed the
[31:48] sevens of god
[31:50] in their foreheads and i heard the
[31:52] number of them which were sealed
[31:54] and they were sealed a hundred and forty
[31:57] and four thousand
[31:59] of all the tribes of the children
[32:03] of israel may god bless his word

[33:46] think the lacking is
[33:48] is no soul travail the people
[33:52] are not broke up enough
[33:55] listen to those words the people are not
[33:58] broken up enough there is no burden

[34:06] tall about lost souls
[34:09] that they cry and are wanting a revival
[34:13] so bad till they can hardly eat
[34:16] they simply can't they can't continue
[34:19] if you would read the history of the
[34:21] world and religious history
[34:24] you will find out it always take that
[34:26] kind of spirit
[34:27] to bring a revival what kind of spirit
[34:30] brokenness
[34:32] broken spirit broken hearts
[34:35] you're feeling uh uh to pour out
[34:38] you want to repent you want to make
[34:40] things right
[34:42] you want to be reconciled to god you
[34:44] want to humble yourself to the cross
[34:46] you want to lay at christ's feet it
[34:48] takes that kind of spirit
[34:51] to bring a revival not arrogance not
[34:54] pride
[34:55] not you and your own self and you do
[34:57] your own thing people not caught up
[34:59] and and have a burden about jesus christ
[35:03] when you fall in love with the lord you
[35:06] want to do the things that pleases god
[35:08] so not your children for it's not the
[35:10] family first not what you feel first is
[35:12] what god
[35:12] first what jesus want first so jesus
[35:15] become the team of your life
[35:18] jesus become the center point of your
[35:19] life everything is wrong we run around
[35:22] jesus
[35:23] not this is me no this is though it's
[35:25] about jesus
[35:26] it's not about you oh hallelujah
[35:29] so let's see that's right and then he
[35:32] quote the scripture he read when zion
[35:34] travail
[35:35] and i think uh i i
[35:38] i when zion travail i think it's a
[35:41] better word
[35:42] why there's a big echo here when zion
[35:45] travail
[35:47] why she brought four children you have
[35:50] to be tore
[35:50] up the atmosphere or anything you have
[35:53] to be torn up
[35:54] so sometimes god allow things to happen
[35:57] to break our spirits
[35:58] to embarrass and shame us and mash us up
[36:02] so when we get broken we could cry
[36:05] because if god leave you intact you are
[36:06] fine
[36:08] everything is everything everything
[36:09] working out how your money are your
[36:11] house you have your car you have your
[36:12] land
[36:13] everything we're gonna find you you
[36:15] don't need god
[36:16] because things were going on nice with
[36:17] you but then god have to crush that
[36:20] break that something has to happen
[36:23] to break your spirit and if your spirit
[36:26] is not broken he will break it
[36:28] because there is going to be a revival
[36:30] praise god do you believe that
[36:33] there is going to be revival and you
[36:35] will have to get
[36:36] in that spirit to get into the revival
[36:40] oh praise anyone do you believe that but
[36:43] iran said you get a wrong way there are
[36:44] arguments
[36:45] you get into the type of atmosphere if
[36:48] there's something in the church
[36:49] someone who is disobedient and acting
[36:52] ugly in the church and causing trouble
[36:55] you will
[36:56] never be able to have a revival as long
[36:59] as that kind of atmospheres are wrong so
[37:01] all the rocks that
[37:03] offend god will move out all the people
[37:06] that want to be
[37:07] ugly go going to move them out run them
[37:09] out
[37:10] squat them out because god's going to
[37:12] have a right atmosphere
[37:14] for a revival oh glory to god he will
[37:17] bust the rocks on off his holy mountain
[37:20] because god going to have a glorious
[37:22] church without
[37:23] spot without wrinkles and no human ever
[37:25] stop that church
[37:27] hallelujah no pastor human no elder
[37:30] human
[37:30] no deacon human no office on human no
[37:33] believer human
[37:34] no human spirit went to stop that church
[37:37] from coming forth because the mount of
[37:39] the lord had spoke on it
[37:40] oh praise the name of the lord do you
[37:42] believe that
[37:44] so so watch if somebody acting ugly in
[37:47] the church and causing trouble
[37:48] you will never be able to have a revival
[37:51] as long as that kind of
[37:52] atmospheres are wrong you have to have
[37:54] everybody if you notice
[37:56] when the holy spirit came on pentecost
[37:58] they were all in one place
[37:59] in one accord waiting for the promise
[38:02] and when we get like that the revival
[38:04] will be there there
[38:05] oh praise god hallelujah and the reason
[38:09] i think we have just had protracted
[38:11] meetings instead of a revival
[38:12] because we do not have a revival nation
[38:14] as yet we have revival like they did in
[38:17] the wesley revival
[38:18] scotland all these revival days of
[38:20] wesley they had great breaking up
[38:23] on worldwide revival by john wesley
[38:25] that's when i take care of a revival
[38:27] i notice in my ministry and this is
[38:29] whatever i'm talking now
[38:30] the people will spiritual people and yet
[38:33] they will watch what god will do
[38:35] and signs and something that he will
[38:36] perform and the people
[38:38] sit and say well that's very fine and
[38:40] you'll notice go will do something
[38:41] else now and they will say that's very
[38:43] nice we appreciate that
[38:45] god is a good god well it's your duty
[38:47] god you did this as a duty
[38:48] no real burden you just take it for
[38:50] granted god blessing you you have health
[38:53] and strength you take god for granted if
[38:55] they got flattened and they're lying on
[38:56] a hospital bed flat then you recognize
[38:58] oh god
[38:59] what you're taking for granted that's
[39:00] why you ought to have a attitude of
[39:02] gratitude
[39:03] let me say it again you have to have you
[39:05] should have an attitude of gratitude
[39:07] you don't need to complain because you
[39:09] have faced the b
[39:11] system yet ufc faced depressed yet
[39:14] you are gone in the wilderness yet the
[39:16] devil take you all day yet
[39:18] so right now you should have an attitude
[39:19] of gratitude that god will
[39:22] open your eyes to see this end time
[39:24] message
[39:25] oh glory to god to see if you will stay
[39:27] with the world until your time comes
[39:30] hallelujah you're going to wait till
[39:32] your time comes we only waiting you know
[39:34] but one day the tea gonna turn the clock
[39:38] is
[39:38] ticking down you know time is running
[39:40] now oh glory to god there's going to be
[39:43] a revival
[39:44] hallelujah just when the worst
[39:48] earthquake to strike america struck the
[39:50] revival holy ghost in azusa
[39:52] that's true hallelujah 1906 i believe it
[39:56] was
[39:57] yes i think it was 1906. hallelujah was
[40:00] a great earthquake
[40:01] and people was blaming god for that it
[40:03] was a great destructive earthquake
[40:06] with many fires but there was another
[40:07] earthquake
[40:09] in the spiritual realm that was littered
[40:11] up a different kind of fire
[40:13] it was holy ghost fire it was a bonfire
[40:17] it was the association revival and i
[40:19] believe tonight there's gonna be another
[40:21] earthquake
[40:22] but this time will be the bright revival
[40:25] it's going to be a holy ghost revival
[40:28] he said what we see should make a church
[40:30] that would make up revival
[40:32] that people will fly from everywhere
[40:34] saying the seven thunders of revelation
[40:36] 10.
[40:37] that is not even written it's being
[40:39] manifested
[40:41] all glory to god so i am under great
[40:44] expectation tonight
[40:46] oh glory to god amen do you believe that
[40:50] brother branham says now if there really
[40:52] was a revival in the air
[40:54] when those things would take place every
[40:56] soul will grasp it quickly
[40:58] there will be no end to it it will just
[41:00] go from one to another
[41:02] from one to another it will keep moving
[41:04] of course you know
[41:05] i'm american like you are but in africa
[41:08] down here
[41:09] where they're supposed to be heathen
[41:10] land it will kinda wouldn't make us feel
[41:12] ashamed of ourselves
[41:14] to see how they receive the gospel when
[41:16] they see
[41:17] one supernatural thing performed thirty
[41:20] thousand received christ
[41:21] as christian savior at one time that was
[41:23] he means
[41:24] 20 000 there's no question it was just
[41:27] over that's all
[41:28] and i will tell you listen to this
[41:30] brother brown i think our people has
[41:32] relied too much on education
[41:34] and theology and so forth and has let
[41:37] it take the spirit's place
[41:42] so now it's the message loaded with
[41:44] knowledge and information and revelation
[41:46] and understanding and topics
[41:47] and discussion and fellowship and people
[41:51] have no faith no atmosphere
[41:54] loading with theology and the theology
[41:57] is
[41:57] end up a substitute for the spirit
[42:00] that's supposed to be here present
[42:02] for the spirit that's supposed to be
[42:04] working oh hallelujah
[42:06] let me drop this to you i believe in
[42:08] ezekiel the 9th chapter that's what we
[42:10] read i'm pretty sure
[42:11] i may be wrong i know i'm quite sure
[42:13] ezekiel 9 chapter when the holy spirit
[42:15] went forth
[42:16] first it was a man when fought
[42:19] from behind the gates with slaughtering
[42:22] weapons to destroy
[42:24] so this is these angels was coming to
[42:26] destroy
[42:27] is one among them was that one with the
[42:30] ink on
[42:31] with the right side isn't that right and
[42:33] that was of course
[42:34] scripturally applied was before the
[42:37] destruction of jerusalem
[42:38] and there was a man came forth with a
[42:40] white robe
[42:42] and an incorn by his side and the
[42:44] commission was given to him
[42:46] by god to go through the city now listen
[42:49] to this
[42:50] and set a mark upon the forehead
[42:54] and he call it he say it here i'm
[42:55] reading i'm still reading the sealing
[42:57] of the holy spirit they're not
[43:01] understanding and getting a revelation
[43:03] and you know the word come to me
[43:04] you're not talking about that now he's
[43:06] talking about a man
[43:09] do you have that mark you're talking
[43:12] about a mark
[43:14] this is not i say you should have this
[43:16] or a pastor say no no this is the
[43:17] scriptures now
[43:18] he says now go through listen set a mark
[43:21] upon the forehead
[43:22] the ceiling of the holy spirit a mark
[43:24] upon the forehead of
[43:26] every man or woman that sighed and cried
[43:29] for the abomination dead in the city
[43:33] so that's the quality of spirit that's a
[43:35] quality
[43:36] attitude sighing and crying
[43:39] for the abomination now i want to ask
[43:42] you
[43:43] if he was coming to chicago tonight
[43:48] how many places would he find tonight
[43:52] that in the home they are laying
[43:56] sobbing for revival just in
[43:59] such a travail of soul
[44:02] that they can't stand it any longer
[44:06] they just don't know what to do i wonder
[44:09] how many would he mark
[44:11] in chicago tonight of this city of
[44:14] almost 5 million people in it
[44:17] what would he mark i imagine you could
[44:20] cong them on your fingers hardly don't
[44:22] you think so
[44:23] the people with that type of burden and
[44:26] yet
[44:27] that was exactly he wasn't a mark
[44:30] no one but that type
[44:34] are you that type do you want to become
[44:37] that
[44:38] type do you want god to come and put
[44:41] that burden on you
[44:44] that you want to be signed and crying
[44:48] and groaning and travailing
[44:51] according to the scripture we read when
[44:53] zion travail
[44:55] zion brought forth if there is no
[44:58] travail
[44:59] nothing coming forth therefore god have
[45:01] to bring on a travail of soul
[45:04] a travail in your spirit beyond where
[45:07] you just have your needs met and and
[45:09] things being met and things working out
[45:11] for you
[45:11] something have to go beyond that that
[45:14] you could grasp the burden of god
[45:16] oh hallelujah praise god
[45:20] you see people individuals inside i have
[45:22] the individual interests and burdens and
[45:24] conditions
[45:25] we who in ministry not fortunate to be
[45:28] in your position
[45:30] amen because we have the burden of the
[45:32] entire church
[45:35] so when you study you and your family we
[45:38] can study our own family
[45:40] we have to study the entire church the
[45:44] burden is different
[45:45] the responsibility is different the
[45:48] weight
[45:48] is different
[45:52] amen hallelujah so you can't look for
[45:55] all the individual attention
[45:57] if this was a thousand people how much
[45:59] hand we will shake
[46:02] how much people will go home by and
[46:03] fellowship with

[46:36] when you leave here
[46:37] you have a hungering in your soul that

[57:12] singing heavenly
[57:14] music and different things listen to
[57:15] this especially the enchanted strange of
[57:17] the so-called heavenly choir
[57:19] or him sung under the evident direction
[57:22] of the holy spirit
[57:23] both as to words and tune trill my whole
[57:26] being is a testimony from azusa street
[57:28] it was not something that could be
[57:29] repeated at will but supernaturally
[57:32] given for each
[57:33] special occasion and was one of the most
[57:36] indisputable evidences of the presence
[57:39] of the power of god perhaps nothing so
[57:41] greatly impressed people as this singing
[57:44] at once inspiring by a holy oar
[57:48] or feeling of indescribable wonder
[57:51] especially the hearers were in devote
[57:53] attitude
[57:54] this one i get to divine love
[57:58] was wonderfully manifest in the meetings
[58:02] they would not even allow an unkind word
[58:05] said against the opposes or the churches
[58:09] the message was the love of god it was a
[58:12] sort of
[58:13] face love of the early church
[58:16] returned it was a sort of first love
[58:20] of the early church return the baptism
[58:23] as we receive it in the beginning
[58:25] did not allow us to talk about the
[58:27] baptism of the holy ghost
[58:29] did not allow us to think speak
[58:32] or hear evil of any man
[58:36] that was repeated that that's what
[58:37] repeated the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:41] did not allow us to think speak
[58:44] or hear evil of any man the spirit
[58:48] was very sensitive and tender as a dove
[58:52] [Music]
[58:53] [Applause]
[58:55] how do you like that hidden mystery
[58:57] that's a real mystery
[58:59] oh hallelujah not arrogant and proud and
[59:02] lose your lip and say where you're going
[59:04] and this is me talking this is not that
[59:06] the spirit
[59:08] sensitive as a dove
[59:11] one man said i would rather live
[59:15] six months at that time than 50 years of
[59:19] ordinary life
[59:22] i have stopped more than once within two
[59:24] blocks of the place
[59:26] and prayed for strength before i dare go
[59:28] on
[59:30] the presence of the lord was so real two
[59:33] blocks
[59:34] and he asking for god for strength to
[59:36] reach the place
[59:38] because the power of god is upon him
[59:41] let me read on here now the presence of
[59:43] the lord was so real
[59:44] scores of people were seen dropping into
[59:47] prostrate position in the streets
[59:50] before they ever reached the mission
[59:52] they would
[59:53] would get up speak in tongues without
[59:55] any influence from jesus people
[59:57] god had accomplished his will g h lange
[1:00:00] reports that some who came to
[1:00:02] investigate
[1:00:03] were baptized in the holy ghost in their
[1:00:05] legends
[1:00:06] scores of personal and eyewitness
[1:00:09] accounts attest
[1:00:10] that men who came to ridicule the
[1:00:11] meetings were
[1:00:13] knocked to the floor where they seem to
[1:00:15] wrestle with unseen opponents
[1:00:17] sometimes for hours these are the people
[1:00:20] coming to ridiculousness
[1:00:22] they will come you know oh yes
[1:00:25] when the spirit falls it raises up other
[1:00:27] spirits and satan will send every
[1:00:30] crackpot to see if he can disrupt our
[1:00:32] genuine holy ghost
[1:00:33] revival so listen to this these people
[1:00:37] okay these people generally arose
[1:00:40] convicted of sin
[1:00:41] and seeking god one foreign-born
[1:00:44] reporter
[1:00:45] had been assigned by his paper to record
[1:00:48] his circus-like atmosphere
[1:00:51] in a comic relief fashion so he come and
[1:00:53] looking for kicks
[1:00:54] he coming to give a report he attended a
[1:00:58] nighttime meeting sitting finally back
[1:01:02] in the midst of the meeting a young
[1:01:04] woman began to testify
[1:01:06] how god had baptized her with the holy
[1:01:08] spirit
[1:01:09] when she suddenly broke into tongues
[1:01:12] after the meeting
[1:01:14] the reporter sought her out and asked
[1:01:16] her where she had learned the language
[1:01:18] of his native country
[1:01:20] she answered that she didn't have any
[1:01:22] idea
[1:01:23] what she had said and that she spoke
[1:01:25] only english
[1:01:26] he then related to her that she had
[1:01:29] given an entirely accurate account
[1:01:31] of his sinful life all in the language
[1:01:35] of his native tongue oh blessed be the
[1:01:38] name of the lord
[1:01:39] so it wasn't a game in those days now it
[1:01:42] wasn't that play thing and but ram says

[1:06:27] oh my my patience
[1:06:33] now to see whether this message we got
[1:06:35] is connected with it or not
[1:06:37] the very hour that israel was signing to
[1:06:40] be a nation
[1:06:41] is the very same hour the very same day
[1:06:43] the very same month
[1:06:44] i was at green mill indiana and the
[1:06:46] angel appeared to me and sent me out on
[1:06:49] the field with this
[1:06:50] he met me down the river and told me
[1:06:52] that would take place
[1:06:54] then commissioned me 11 years later at
[1:06:56] the same hour
[1:06:57] that israel was signing a nation it is
[1:06:59] all connected together
[1:07:02] amen the in then he made a statement and
[1:07:04] let me keep preaching something like
[1:07:05] that
[1:07:06] the angel of the lord is unhooked now he
[1:07:08] is moving around
[1:07:09] fixing everything for the coming of the
[1:07:11] lord
[1:07:13] now 1914 the world went to war there
[1:07:15] have been never had been peace since
[1:07:17] contrary swinging swinging swinging in
[1:07:19] and they're doing the very same thing
[1:07:20] yet and they was doing what holding he
[1:07:22] said oh god have mercy
[1:07:23] holding that great thing that i saw in
[1:07:26] the vision
[1:07:27] the whole team become a destruction
[1:07:29] holding the atomic hole in the wars
[1:07:31] that they don't destroy themselves until
[1:07:34] the team come to destroy it until israel
[1:07:35] returns back
[1:07:36] and get herself together and then the
[1:07:38] messenger will go to israel
[1:07:40] and she'll be sealed with the seal of
[1:07:42] the holy spirit
[1:07:43] after the gentiles is called out the
[1:07:46] people for his name's sake
[1:07:47] then israel only receives a three and
[1:07:50] six
[1:07:51] three years and six month message daniel
[1:07:54] said so
[1:07:55] there's given a space is given for the
[1:07:58] gentiles when it comes to this age
[1:08:00] he called it the times of the gentiles
[1:08:03] not even fixed
[1:08:04] just ecologists the times of the
[1:08:06] gentiles and when that time of the
[1:08:08] general is over
[1:08:10] the door is shut not one more gentile to
[1:08:12] be saved
[1:08:13] and then god go over to the jews oh my
[1:08:16] hallelujah
[1:08:17] could i read a little bit then there's
[1:08:20] three and a half years left for the jews
[1:08:22] now if we get over version 11 we'll pick
[1:08:24] it up at the end of that elijah and
[1:08:26] moses returns again
[1:08:27] and preached to the jews two men
[1:08:29] anointed with that spirit or maybe them
[1:08:31] themselves they never died so they
[1:08:33] killed them
[1:08:34] and they lay in the street called sodom
[1:08:35] where our lord was crucified jerusalem
[1:08:37] and after three days the life spirit
[1:08:40] came into them
[1:08:40] and they went up and raised up and then
[1:08:45] about a third of the earth was blown to
[1:08:48] pieces at that time
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:56] you mean this is real you mean this is
[1:08:58] going to happen
[1:09:00] he said a third of the earth was blown
[1:09:02] up to pieces at that time
[1:09:05] now here the jews that come in to preach
[1:09:07] to the world cannot will not blow up one
[1:09:09] another or kill one another or
[1:09:10] destruction come
[1:09:11] until the jews come down to that place
[1:09:14] and here sets the bible
[1:09:15] he saw four angels and watch what they
[1:09:17] got to receive they have got to receive
[1:09:20] the holy ghost
[1:09:22] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:09:25] ephesians 4 30 the holy spirit sealed
[1:09:28] until the day of your redemption
[1:09:30] and they cannot do nothing until those
[1:09:32] jews return
[1:09:33] oh praise god hallelujah i love him
[1:09:36] tonight
[1:09:37] the last evening we picked up and find
[1:09:39] out that the first church how it started
[1:09:41] off it was tired of
[1:09:42] pentecost where the holy spirit was
[1:09:44] poured out upon believers
[1:09:45] and we saw the reaction of these
[1:09:48] believers
[1:09:49] and how they acted upon them nobody
[1:09:51] talks about that
[1:09:52] they explain where the holy ghost but
[1:09:54] they had an action
[1:09:59] and they did and signs and ones follow
[1:10:01] them we find out at the closing church
[1:10:04] age
[1:10:04] about 300 years they sprung up a heresy
[1:10:06] among them
[1:10:07] that doctrine was the induction of the
[1:10:09] nicolaitan
[1:10:10] we find out it was deeds to begin with
[1:10:13] in the next churches become a doctrine
[1:10:15] then they become persecution in the dark
[1:10:16] age then the other side
[1:10:18] it come protestant church martin luther
[1:10:21] watch
[1:10:22] and he's seeing the spirit of god lead
[1:10:24] him out instead of
[1:10:25] letting the people stay free he
[1:10:26] organized a church
[1:10:28] and made an image liking unto the beast
[1:10:31] you showed any spirit around what god
[1:10:33] seeing people say that church
[1:10:35] god's seen an image on to the beast
[1:10:38] and let's let's go further a political
[1:10:41] power lightning
[1:10:42] onto it instead of letting the people
[1:10:45] walk as god gives light
[1:10:47] they organize under a discipline that
[1:10:50] they have to stay to that discipline
[1:10:52] what happened in the message what
[1:10:53] happened to churches people are doing
[1:10:55] doctrine and teaching
[1:10:56] and people following doctrine and
[1:10:57] teaching hallelujah and that
[1:11:00] and and that is supposed to put them in
[1:11:01] the bride like i'm like i said on sunday
[1:11:03] there is no private bride
[1:11:05] nobody can take a church outside and
[1:11:07] like guide the brother jesus christ and
[1:11:09] then minister to the brethren jesus
[1:11:11] christ that that doesn't exist
[1:11:12] the bride of christ is a body by one
[1:11:15] spirit
[1:11:16] you are baptized into that one body
[1:11:18] nobody can hijack that bride and have
[1:11:20] that bride and a father look at hijack
[1:11:22] choose members any time
[1:11:23] you can have thousands of church members
[1:11:25] but that ride that jesus right
[1:11:27] first thessalonians 4 the lord himself
[1:11:30] descended from heaven with a shout
[1:11:32] to get that right he sent a message to
[1:11:34] get that bride
[1:11:35] oh glory to god if god called you by
[1:11:37] this message oh glory to god you are
[1:11:39] you are privileged you are privileged
[1:11:42] because the bride will not be manhandled
[1:11:45] then brighton will be flesh of his flesh
[1:11:48] word of his word spirit of his spirit
[1:11:51] oh glory to god amen
[1:11:54] god listen listen god moved right out
[1:11:58] into the methodist church
[1:11:59] the methodists had a revival that struck
[1:12:00] the world the holy spirit was with them
[1:12:03] teaching sanctification and the first
[1:12:05] thing you know they organized the church
[1:12:06] and made an image unto the beast
[1:12:08] a political organized power to bind the
[1:12:11] people
[1:12:13] that is what that anointing does it
[1:12:15] binds the people
[1:12:16] to assist them and not the holy ghost
[1:12:19] that is what we are fighting
[1:12:21] hallelujah systems binding is a power
[1:12:24] you know
[1:12:25] it's making them fall along and pack out
[1:12:27] there's no power because buying the
[1:12:29] people

[1:12:56] the first thing you know when they did
[1:12:57] that they organized the church made an
[1:12:58] image unto the beast that's right a
[1:13:00] political organized power
[1:13:01] to bind the people of god to a creed
[1:13:05] instead of being free to worship and
[1:13:07] walk in light
[1:13:08] as light was thrown in their path did
[1:13:10] you realize christian friends
[1:13:12] that the antichrist which is the mark of
[1:13:14] the beast

[1:14:05] not written
[1:14:06] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:14:08] foundation of the world
[1:14:10] oh glory to god we are crazy we're not
[1:14:13] crazy
[1:14:14] oh glory to god we are not crazy this is
[1:14:17] the message
[1:14:18] this is the word back to the bible
[1:14:22] back to pentecost back to the holy ghost
[1:14:25] back to dynamics and we are emphasizing
[1:14:28] dynamics
[1:14:29] we're emphasizing the spirit
[1:14:33] oh my god do you realize christian
[1:14:36] friends
[1:14:37] that the antichrist which is the mark of
[1:14:38] the beast the antichrist everyone knows
[1:14:40] that
[1:14:40] the antichrist there that his mark is
[1:14:43] his power
[1:14:46] a beast is a power there is a power
[1:14:49] in the catholic church
[1:14:53] i want you to understand what the saying
[1:14:55] here there is a power
[1:14:57] in the battle in this church so it's not
[1:14:59] like they have no power you know
[1:15:00] it's what kind of power because the
[1:15:04] catholicism of millions
[1:15:05] is a power keeping them people inside
[1:15:07] the idea that's right with the two our
[1:15:08] father entry healing mary
[1:15:12] it's keeping them there you know they're
[1:15:14] not moving
[1:15:16] every sunday morning
[1:15:19] final divine have them under control
[1:15:28] church here but iran that is the beast
[1:15:31] power
[1:15:32] the baptist church is the same the
[1:15:35] pentecostal church
[1:15:36] driver witnessed all of them it's peace
[1:15:38] power you can't
[1:15:40] change up a jehovah witness unless the
[1:15:43] name on the book the stand your witness
[1:15:45] because that doctrine that bind them the
[1:15:48] following juvenile witness
[1:15:49] the following baptists tie tide ahead
[1:15:51] ring the bell that is it
[1:15:55] it's a power hallelujah but we have to
[1:15:59] get our power too
[1:16:08] our power have to be the same power
[1:16:12] that peter had because his one lord
[1:16:16] is one fate and is one baptism
[1:16:20] oh give the lord a show one lord
[1:16:24] one fate one baptism it's the holy ghost
[1:16:28] baptism
[1:16:29] and those guys had it you wouldn't have
[1:16:32] it
[1:16:32] because there's only only one it's not
[1:16:36] true it's one
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:41] don't let nobody fool you
[1:16:44] it's not peter had a kind and we really
[1:16:47] modern age
[1:16:48] and and we have a kind to no no no the
[1:16:51] words say
[1:16:52] one lord one faith one baptism
[1:16:56] that's why brother branham didn't come
[1:16:58] and bring a new faith he came to turn
[1:17:00] your hearts
[1:17:01] back to defense because there's only one
[1:17:03] faith
[1:17:04] oh get the lord assault that's the fate
[1:17:07] of god
[1:17:08] abraham had it all glory to god
[1:17:12] the early church had it only one faith
[1:17:16] going back to that faith oh hallelujah
[1:17:19] praise god praise god
[1:17:21] amen amen amen oh glory to god
[1:17:25] hallelujah
[1:17:26] praise god but abraham and this is the
[1:17:30] way i get
[1:17:31] whoo get the inspiration from if i could
[1:17:34] say that man
[1:17:36] seal of antichrist but abraham god bless
[1:17:38] you i love you
[1:17:39] and if you want to see our real genuine
[1:17:42] gifts
[1:17:43] are not impersonation if you want to see
[1:17:45] real
[1:17:46] solid christians walking so salty
[1:17:49] till the earth is twisting for them to
[1:17:51] be like them
[1:17:52] you can't go down on the street and tell
[1:17:54] what is christian anymore that's right
[1:17:56] they all go down the street they all act
[1:17:58] the same they talk the same all time
[1:18:00] around cracking all kind of jokes
[1:18:01] everything like that
[1:18:02] when god said you'll give a kong for
[1:18:04] every idol word that you speak
[1:18:05] what happened because brother you are
[1:18:08] letting the devil come in and put it
[1:18:10] over your eyes the first thing you know
[1:18:13] prophecy the time will come
[1:18:18] when god will give a message and you'll
[1:18:21] be sealed in
[1:18:22] or out the kingdom of god
[1:18:28] not join church people joining by the
[1:18:31] thousands
[1:18:32] he said a message going to come and that
[1:18:35] message going to either actually seal
[1:18:38] you in
[1:18:39] or seal you up that's right
[1:18:42] he said we need the old-fashioned gospel
[1:18:44] back in the church
[1:18:45] back to the word of god a lot of this
[1:18:47] nonsense and foolishness cut off
[1:18:49] oh my around the country the things
[1:18:51] that's done here in our country
[1:18:53] something coming here not long ago you
[1:18:54] can't even mention pentecost around our
[1:18:56] country anymore
[1:18:57] of account of it coming with a thousand
[1:19:00] times thousands of dollars taken from
[1:19:01] the poor people to buy airplanes and so
[1:19:03] forth
[1:19:04] never was a little airplane bought and
[1:19:05] all kind of stuff and get up on the
[1:19:07] platform
[1:19:08] bringing air floppers hanging down
[1:19:09] enough jewels on their fingers to send
[1:19:11] four missionaries across to the sea
[1:19:12] and preach the gospel then poor people
[1:19:14] they're starving to hear the word of god
[1:19:16] or we call ourselves christians he said
[1:19:17] brother there is something wrong
[1:19:19] we have time for everything else no time
[1:19:22] for prayer meetings
[1:19:22] the home is all butchered up the girls
[1:19:24] and boys are all going around lacking
[1:19:26] around the country
[1:19:27] mothers and fathers is unconcerned yet
[1:19:29] pentecostal
[1:19:30] what we need tonight is a home altar in
[1:19:32] the house a place where god
[1:19:34] where the bible is read and the children
[1:19:37] are taught the word of the living god
[1:19:39] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:19:42] so the wise virgin going to be in
[1:19:45] travail
[1:19:46] oh glory to god the wise virgin will be
[1:19:49] in travail
[1:19:50] to get the extra oil because the foolish
[1:19:52] version they're all going to run out
[1:19:54] oh glory to god they get a temporary
[1:19:56] blessing he said the holy spirit oh
[1:19:58] glory to god amen
[1:19:59] what what what what what what they come
[1:20:01] to do lamb chill in time
[1:20:07] what is that the lumbar will weaken it
[1:20:09] part dipping oil and pat on fire
[1:20:13] if but george if they don't have the
[1:20:15] pattern fire they can't see nothing
[1:20:18] so you have to be the weak part of you
[1:20:20] an oil and an expert on fire
[1:20:23] that could give light isn't that right
[1:20:26] but after a while the
[1:20:27] the lambda suit up they shade the suit
[1:20:31] up then you would long time when we have
[1:20:33] lamp here they do you take the lamp
[1:20:35] and you take the newspaper and clean it
[1:20:37] out
[1:20:38] you trim the lamp you clip the wick
[1:20:42] and then light it over fresh you get
[1:20:43] nice light good light salam treatment
[1:20:46] time you have to
[1:20:47] sickly clean the lamp and cut the wick
[1:20:50] oh god lampshaming time all that part
[1:20:53] that shoot up in your life
[1:20:55] and smoking up your life that you can't
[1:20:57] give the light you're supposed to give
[1:20:59] that's how they get cleaned out all
[1:21:01] glory to god but your life had to be in
[1:21:03] oil
[1:21:04] and you had to be on fire fire on one
[1:21:07] end
[1:21:08] oil in one end isn't that right
[1:21:11] hallelujah
[1:21:12] glory to god do you believe that
[1:21:14] hallelujah
[1:21:16] so i'm talking about it's heading up to
[1:21:18] two great things coming to the end time
[1:21:20] the mark of god and the seal of the
[1:21:22] beasts isn't that right on the seal of
[1:21:24] god any minister no
[1:21:25] is a baptism of the holy ghost remember
[1:21:27] what the mark of the beast is the mark
[1:21:29] of the beast is
[1:21:30] carnal esau reject that birthright
[1:21:32] didn't he so we bitterly
[1:21:34] trying to restore that with right again
[1:21:36] but there was no place of repentance
[1:21:37] when you reject the holy ghost you seal
[1:21:40] yourself outside of god's mercy
[1:21:42] no you say brother branham you if you
[1:21:45] can tell us our diseases and so forth
[1:21:47] you are prophet well i am still the same
[1:21:50] person that's right
[1:21:51] i still got the scripture said it's
[1:21:53] exactly right it's the truth
[1:21:54] it's hearing people say there'll be a
[1:21:56] mark
[1:21:57] it's already marked just reject the holy
[1:22:00] ghost and you are marked
[1:22:02] receive the holy ghost and you are
[1:22:03] marked that's right receive it once and
[1:22:06] see what take place
[1:22:07] receive it once that's the mark of god
[1:22:10] and you are
[1:22:11] sealed to your eternal destination like
[1:22:14] the cow out on the road
[1:22:15] the inspector comes and i know if you
[1:22:17] didn't get the holy ghost last night
[1:22:18] that went in there check up the night
[1:22:20] the inspector of the holy ghost is here
[1:22:22] inspecting you over i used to work at
[1:22:25] the pennsylvania railroad
[1:22:26] we load a car with cans the inspector
[1:22:28] comes around
[1:22:29] shake everything to see if there was any
[1:22:31] looseness
[1:22:33] and that's the way god does his church
[1:22:35] he shake it to see what's the matter
[1:22:37] with it
[1:22:38] to see if there's any looseness in you
[1:22:41] before he pours his spirit into you
[1:22:44] and if the church is a little shaky he
[1:22:46] won't pour his spirit into it
[1:22:48] if you still love the world and want to
[1:22:49] do the scene of the world you will never
[1:22:51] get the holy ghost upon that
[1:22:52] you might get a confusion you might get
[1:22:54] stammering lips you might get speaking
[1:22:56] in tongues but you still that don't mean
[1:22:58] you have got the holy ghost when you got
[1:22:59] the holy ghost you are sealed
[1:23:01] by god to your eternal destination
[1:23:05] when the inspector come and check that
[1:23:06] don't go a good that car
[1:23:09] you shut the door and put a seal on it
[1:23:11] and when god sees you are ready
[1:23:13] so lord for him he fills you with the
[1:23:15] holy ghost you are sealed by the holy
[1:23:17] ghost
[1:23:18] until your destination oh praise the
[1:23:21] name of the lord hallelujah
[1:23:23] hallelujah praise god praise god so we
[1:23:26] are waiting for the finishing of the
[1:23:27] seventh seal
[1:23:29] to prove who we are oh glory to god the
[1:23:31] bride get caught up at the finishing of
[1:23:34] the seventh seal
[1:23:35] and the foolish version will be exposed
[1:23:37] for the three and a half year
[1:23:38] tribulation period
[1:23:39] oh glory to god resisting the holy ghost
[1:23:41] and they will not even know it until the
[1:23:43] tribulation hit them
[1:23:44] hallelujah dance and jamborees
[1:23:46] tribulation go hit them the resistant
[1:23:48] right room
[1:23:49] oh my hallelujah glory to god that's the
[1:23:52] reason
[1:23:53] i spoke against the church there's only
[1:23:55] one church and that's the body of christ
[1:23:57] but these lodges that is called churches
[1:23:59] blasphemous name
[1:24:00] why blasphemy it is to be contrary or
[1:24:03] speak against what god said
[1:24:04] and god said come and be born and they
[1:24:06] say come and join and when the baptism
[1:24:08] of the spirit is forced he took over
[1:24:10] for water away from the catholic church
[1:24:12] he said and the protestant church an
[1:24:14] emotion
[1:24:14] in the pentecostal church instead of the
[1:24:17] person of christ
[1:24:18] coming in with all that building
[1:24:20] material
[1:24:22] instead of the person of christ coming
[1:24:24] in with all that pyramid building we had
[1:24:25] the other day after your faith virtue
[1:24:27] and spiritual knowledge
[1:24:28] peter said these things glory that's the
[1:24:31] holy ghost
[1:24:32] faith and virtue and knowledge and depth
[1:24:34] that's the holy ghost
[1:24:36] oh give the lord some praises that is
[1:24:39] what the pentecostals
[1:24:40] was short of oh my let's continue
[1:24:43] quickly
[1:24:44] the green angel of the covenant jesus
[1:24:46] christ thought not rabbiting equal with
[1:24:47] god
[1:24:48] the first exodus he brought him from a
[1:24:50] natural land to a natural land from
[1:24:51] egypt to kingdom land the second exodus
[1:24:53] he brought him out of a spiritual
[1:24:54] condition
[1:24:55] into the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:24:57] this third one now he's bringing up from
[1:24:59] the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:00] to that eternal line in the millennium
[1:25:02] it has to come from the holy ghost
[1:25:04] baptism to the land of the millennium
[1:25:07] he said come out of chaos come to the
[1:25:08] living god come to the word
[1:25:10] and the word is made flesh and dwell
[1:25:11] among us so praise god
[1:25:14] talking about the virgins here five were
