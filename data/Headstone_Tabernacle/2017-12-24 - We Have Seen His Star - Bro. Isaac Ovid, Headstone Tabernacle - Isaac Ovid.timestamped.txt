[1:12:11] you brother Anthony thank you musicians
[1:12:16] Matthew chapter 2 reading from verse 1
[1:12:23] now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[1:12:28] Judea in the days of Herod the King
[1:12:31] behold they came wise men from the east
[1:12:34] to Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[1:12:37] born King of the Jews for we have seen
[1:12:40] his star in the east and are come to
[1:12:43] worship him when Herod the King had
[1:12:46] heard these things he was troubled and
[1:12:48] all Jerusalem with him and when he had
[1:12:52] gathered all the chief priests and
[1:12:55] scribes of the people together he
[1:12:57] demanded of them where Christ should be
[1:13:00] born and they said unto Him in Bethlehem
[1:13:02] of Judea for thus it is written by the
[1:13:05] prophet and thou bethlehem in the land
[1:13:08] of Judah at thou art not the least among
[1:13:11] the princes of Judah for out of thee
[1:13:14] shall come a governor that's a rule my
[1:13:16] people Israel then Herod when he had
[1:13:19] privily called the wise men inquired of
[1:13:22] them diligently what time the star
[1:13:25] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[1:13:27] and said go and search diligently for
[1:13:30] the young child and when he had found
[1:13:32] and when he have found him bring me word
[1:13:33] again that I may come and wish of him
[1:13:36] also when they had heard the King they
[1:13:39] departed and lo the star which we saw in
[1:13:41] the East went before them till it came
[1:13:43] and stood over where the young child was
[1:13:46] and when they saw the
[1:13:47] star they rejoiced with exceeding great
[1:13:50] joy and when they will come into the
[1:13:52] house they saw the young child with Mary
[1:13:54] his mother and fell down and worship him
[1:13:57] and when they had opened their treasures
[1:13:58] they presented unto Him gifts gold and
[1:14:01] frankincense and myrrh and being warned
[1:14:05] of God in a dream that they should not
[1:14:07] return to Herod they departed into their
[1:14:09] own country another way and when they
[1:14:12] were departed behold the angel of the
[1:14:14] Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream
[1:14:15] saying arise and take the young child
[1:14:17] and his mother and flee into Egypt and
[1:14:20] be thou there until I bring the word for
[1:14:22] Herod will seek a young child to destroy
[1:14:24] him and when he arose he took the young
[1:14:27] child and his mother by night and
[1:14:28] departed into Egypt and there was and
[1:14:32] was they until the death of Herod that
[1:14:34] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[1:14:36] of the Lord by the Prophet seeing out of
[1:14:38] Egypt have I called my son then Herod
[1:14:42] when he saw that he was mocked of the
[1:14:43] wise men was exceeding wroth and sent
[1:14:45] forth and slew all the children that
[1:14:47] were in Bethlehem and in all the coasts
[1:14:49] there are from two years all and under
[1:14:51] according to the time which he had
[1:14:53] diligently inquired of the wise men may
[1:14:56] the Lord had a blessing to the reading
[1:14:57] of his word you may be seated so I have
[1:15:02] a title this morning for Christmas
[1:15:05] encouragement or Christmas message and
[1:15:07] my title is we have seen his star we
[1:15:11] have seen his star and for subject the
[1:15:15] voice of the sign and an inspiration the
[1:15:19] identification of the true worshipers
[1:15:23] you know and we know from the message
[1:15:25] and we know through studying Scripture
[1:15:27] but the Branham brought it out so many
[1:15:29] times that December the 25th is not the
[1:15:32] day that Jesus would have been born and
[1:15:34] that date would have evolved from
[1:15:36] mixture of trying to mix Romanism with
[1:15:40] Christianity and paganism but the
[1:15:43] reality is as brother Branham said he
[1:15:45] said whenever people are speaking about
[1:15:47] Christmas the real Christians have a
[1:15:49] responsibility to bring up the truth of
[1:15:52] the birth of Jesus Christ because if
[1:15:55] Christ was not born there would be no
[1:15:57] salvation and if Christ was not born
[1:15:59] there would be no redemption
[1:16:01] and if Christ was not born there would
[1:16:03] be no restoration and if Christ was not
[1:16:06] born there would be no deliverance and
[1:16:08] if if Christ was not born there would be
[1:16:10] no healing so the celebration of the
[1:16:13] birth of Christ is something that we
[1:16:15] ought to celebrate every day it is not
[1:16:17] just in December it is not on a
[1:16:20] certainty it is a celebration because it
[1:16:22] is connected directly so who we are
[1:16:25] because if he did not come he could not
[1:16:27] have died if he did not come he could
[1:16:30] not have walked on the water and God
[1:16:33] rich in His grace and mercy promised a
[1:16:36] king he promised a governor he promised
[1:16:39] a ruler and he brought a baby so when
[1:16:44] the devil is looking for a king and
[1:16:45] looking for a governor and looking for a
[1:16:47] chariot and looking for a horse here
[1:16:49] comes a baby and God slips a baby right
[1:16:52] under the devil's nose and that and that
[1:16:54] baby is born right there in a manger can
[1:16:57] the church see men
[1:16:59] so I greet you this morning and on
[1:17:01] behalf of brother over than the ministry
[1:17:03] we want to wish you a blessed or Merry
[1:17:06] Christmas and I want to quote the
[1:17:08] Prophet in a message says we would see
[1:17:10] Jesus you say god bless you not exactly
[1:17:12] a Merry Christmas but God's blessings of
[1:17:15] Christmas be upon you Meter Christ of
[1:17:18] Calvary hide you in himself blanket you
[1:17:22] so wrap you and in strode you in his
[1:17:24] wood till his wood will be made flesh in
[1:17:27] you is my prayer and that is our prayer
[1:17:29] that is our desire for every believer
[1:17:32] here this morning can the church say man
[1:17:35] so we are going to be in a word this
[1:17:38] morning I'm excited about what is
[1:17:41] happening and I'm so happy to see the
[1:17:43] believers who made it out here today
[1:17:46] you know christmas is a time is a
[1:17:49] special time Christmas means anonymously
[1:17:52] a number of things it means a time for
[1:17:55] family it means a time for connecting it
[1:17:58] means a time for for for ham a time for
[1:18:01] for Turkey a time for for different
[1:18:04] people it means it means the friending
[1:18:06] the time the share gifts the time to
[1:18:08] connect with friends or time to break
[1:18:10] diets it's a time
[1:18:14] it's a time of a lot of different things
[1:18:17] and you always say we have to always
[1:18:19] remember the real reason for the season
[1:18:22] and as brother Branham would speak about
[1:18:25] this he would speak to the church he
[1:18:27] said I can tell you how to raise your
[1:18:28] children you know but Christmas is not
[1:18:31] about Santa Claus he said if you lie to
[1:18:33] them about Santa Claus one natal one no
[1:18:35] one else you lied about so tell them the
[1:18:37] truth the real truth about Christmas
[1:18:39] that and it's not about the gifts and
[1:18:41] it's not about the standard Claus but
[1:18:42] there was a gift because God so loved
[1:18:44] the world and He gave His only begotten
[1:18:47] Son and and that I call the first great
[1:18:50] gift and by the manaman preaching would
[1:18:52] say but there's another gift it's it's a
[1:18:54] gift of the Holy Ghost that's that's the
[1:18:56] real gift that he wanted to give his
[1:18:58] people and he would always say the best
[1:19:01] Christmas gift you could ever get is
[1:19:03] that eternal life the gift of the Holy
[1:19:06] Ghost and he would preach to the people
[1:19:08] that when he have a Christmas message
[1:19:12] that my desire for you is if I could
[1:19:15] give it to you myself I would but he is
[1:19:18] the giver of the gift and he is still
[1:19:20] giving the gift of the baptism of the
[1:19:22] Holy Ghost and fire and his promise is
[1:19:25] just as real as it was when he was here
[1:19:29] a can - amen oh so we gonna talk about
[1:19:37] Jesus this morning is that's okay is
[1:19:39] that okay with you for a few minutes
[1:19:42] that talk about Jesus because we have
[1:19:45] seen his star and because we have seen
[1:19:48] his star we have come to worship up the
[1:19:51] star woke us up this morning the stock
[1:19:54] hoard our attention and brother branham
[1:19:57] said that that stock expressed a message
[1:20:01] because the star itself was a signer
[1:20:04] this now was not the endgame the star
[1:20:07] was pointing to something that was
[1:20:09] happening this towers a prophetic
[1:20:11] message the star had a voice the star
[1:20:15] raised questions can the church here and
[1:20:18] I'm already leaving my notes this
[1:20:20] morning where that's all right
[1:20:23] for 400 years
[1:20:26] there was no spiritual move that's what
[1:20:28] the Prophet said prophecy had hung over
[1:20:31] a cheering of Israel hung over the Jews
[1:20:34] the last prophet Malachi had already
[1:20:37] left the scene and he he took me whole I
[1:20:39] will send you Elijah before the Great
[1:20:42] and dreadful to him all those prophecies
[1:20:44] were overing and for 400 years there was
[1:20:47] silence but when the Branham taught us
[1:20:50] and scripture tells us God to do nothing
[1:20:53] in the spiritual unless there's a sign
[1:20:56] so before is a spiritual happening they
[1:20:59] has got to be a sign and God had to
[1:21:02] place the sign with enough notice
[1:21:05] because there were some Gentiles who had
[1:21:08] to see the silent and they had to ask
[1:21:10] questions but the Branham said these
[1:21:14] were wise men these were studied men
[1:21:17] these were spiritual men you see I can
[1:21:20] imagine and brother Branham would paint
[1:21:22] a picture that every day every time they
[1:21:25] will get up into the tower and they
[1:21:27] would look out to the stars but the
[1:21:29] Brenham said these men you or every star
[1:21:32] meant you know whatever east I was
[1:21:34] connected to didn't know every movement
[1:21:36] meant they understood what everything
[1:21:39] was a powder but all of a sudden one
[1:21:41] there they saw something they never saw
[1:21:43] before they saw something they could not
[1:21:46] explain and but the problem said maybe
[1:21:48] they went to their master he said when
[1:21:52] you go back to the Book of Daniel when
[1:21:54] Daniel was here he was their master over
[1:21:57] in Babylonian because all the sages and
[1:22:00] the wise men would come and discuss the
[1:22:02] Stars and disgusto ever and discuss
[1:22:05] science and discuss and you see there's
[1:22:07] nothing we have to explain this sign
[1:22:10] this sign is a different kind of sign we
[1:22:13] have seen stars we have seen
[1:22:15] constellations we have seen things
[1:22:18] before but this one is different and it
[1:22:24] got them so curious it got them so
[1:22:27] excited but the brown said they may have
[1:22:29] look to their own scriptures and found
[1:22:31] nothing
[1:22:32] but the Branham said maybe they went
[1:22:34] back to the Book of Daniel and phone
[1:22:37] with Daniel wrote about a stone cut out
[1:22:40] without the hands of man and he started
[1:22:42] to connect the pieces theologians
[1:22:47] describe these men as the kingmakers
[1:22:51] because for centuries it was the Magi
[1:22:54] and the sages and the wise men that
[1:22:57] would confer together to anoint kings
[1:23:00] thousands of years ago so when her
[1:23:03] father was dying and leaving his throne
[1:23:06] to his son or one of his sons
[1:23:08] the wise men would be summoned to look
[1:23:12] at the Stars and look at the signs and
[1:23:15] let the King know that's the right Sun
[1:23:17] and when the King passed on they were
[1:23:20] coming and knowing who was gonna replace
[1:23:22] the King so God had some Gentiles who
[1:23:28] were the problem said they were also
[1:23:29] believers because they believed in one
[1:23:31] God but their hearts were pricked to say
[1:23:35] we have seen something and we have to
[1:23:37] investigate but the man said it took
[1:23:39] about two years two years of cold two
[1:23:43] years of rugged Road and two years of
[1:23:46] camels and didn't give up but they
[1:23:49] Brandon said that's how the character of
[1:23:51] the Christian is more little to the
[1:23:53] hardship it wasn't a one-week journey it
[1:23:55] wasn't a drive to church on Sunday
[1:23:57] morning it was two years two years of
[1:24:01] pushing two years of pressing two years
[1:24:04] of fighting I'm gonna Brandon said under
[1:24:07] way to Bethlehem they had to pass
[1:24:09] through Jerusalem the city that was the
[1:24:13] spiritual city holy Jerusalem and when
[1:24:16] they got there when the terrans they
[1:24:18] came in a revival because they knew they
[1:24:21] were near to what they were looking for
[1:24:22] they came excited
[1:24:25] he came excited where is he where is the
[1:24:29] king must is Messiah Mia no where are
[1:24:33] all the miracles where's the king of
[1:24:36] kings
[1:24:37] oh and amid so much noise that the
[1:24:43] officers of the day brought these men in
[1:24:45] front of Herod and the Bible said Herod
[1:24:48] was troubled and all of Jerusalem not
[1:24:51] part of Jerusalem all of Jerusalem was
[1:24:54] troubled
[1:24:55] and then Herod : ministers meeting he
[1:24:57] said brother's ministers scribes tell me
[1:25:01] what it says about the Christ and the
[1:25:03] Bible says they found where it was
[1:25:05] written so it was not that they didn't
[1:25:07] have it it was not that they didn't know
[1:25:09] it but they had forgotten about it
[1:25:12] because they were caught up in the
[1:25:13] rituals or they were caught up in the
[1:25:15] traditions up But Here Come tree Manor
[1:25:18] who were not from their City not from
[1:25:21] their town not from their church not
[1:25:23] from their establishment but they came
[1:25:26] at the desire because God let them see
[1:25:29] this time Oh hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:25:36] Herod and it's so beautiful because you
[1:25:40] see the clear this difference between
[1:25:42] what a man says with his mouth and what
[1:25:44] he says with his heart he said when you
[1:25:46] find him bring back word to me because
[1:25:50] I'm also a worship because I want to
[1:25:52] worship him too and these wise men left
[1:25:55] feeling that that was the right thing to
[1:25:57] do but we read the scripture God had to
[1:26:00] give them a dream to let them know pass
[1:26:03] the other way don't pass through D by
[1:26:05] pass don't pass back to Jerusalem take
[1:26:08] the other Road and and head back home
[1:26:10] with your rejoicing because Cara's
[1:26:12] motive is not right can the church
[1:26:14] Seaman and we're gonna get to it later
[1:26:18] in the message but our worship is based
[1:26:21] on a sign the start was a sign it was
[1:26:26] pointing to the Messiah a prophet is a
[1:26:29] sign because the Prophet is not to
[1:26:31] identify himself and brother Branham
[1:26:33] taught us that in the right hand of God
[1:26:36] he plays seven stars and these stars
[1:26:39] were to attract the people in their age
[1:26:42] and in their time to see that there was
[1:26:44] Messiah to reveal word
[1:26:46] on the earth at that time so Paul he was
[1:26:50] a stop and those who saw the staff had
[1:26:53] to follow the voice of the sign to see
[1:26:55] what the message was Paul did not point
[1:26:58] people to himself but he was pointed to
[1:27:01] Jesus and he said if an angel come down
[1:27:04] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[1:27:06] let him be accursed but I'm pointing you
[1:27:09] to Jesus I'm pointing you to the Messiah
[1:27:13] I'm pointing you to the King of Kings on
[1:27:15] and Paul was a star in the right hand of
[1:27:18] God
[1:27:20] anybody in the house this morning
[1:27:23] anybody in the house this morning we're
[1:27:26] gonna get to the real meaning of
[1:27:27] Christmas we're gonna get to the real
[1:27:29] meaning of what is this all about but we
[1:27:31] have seen his staff that is what has us
[1:27:35] excited of we have seen his table God
[1:27:38] Himself please a star to catch our
[1:27:41] attention but some of us has been two
[1:27:44] years up we've been on the journey the
[1:27:46] sum has been 40 years up on the journey
[1:27:49] but we will see the Lord's Christ up we
[1:27:52] will see Messiah we will see the King of
[1:27:55] Kings up we will see that great governor
[1:27:57] we will see it we shall see the king oh
[1:28:02] we are walking in the light this morning
[1:28:05] or you may be seated
[1:28:08] Oh hallelujah so I'm bringing some types
[1:28:15] of spawning those wise men they saw a
[1:28:18] natural star but we didn't see that
[1:28:20] stuff we were not there when they saw
[1:28:23] what this saw but we have also seen a
[1:28:26] star because the messengers of the seven
[1:28:29] churches but the Branham said they asked
[1:28:31] us in the right hand of God and in our
[1:28:34] team we have had a star in our time we
[1:28:37] have had a star in our generation we
[1:28:40] have had a star and that star has been
[1:28:43] pointing at the Messiah that star has
[1:28:46] been pointing to the revealed Word
[1:28:50] we have seen his star Oh hallelujah and
[1:28:55] we are walking in that light we are
[1:28:57] walking in the light of that star this
[1:28:59] morning we are walking in the light of
[1:29:02] that message you may be seated
[1:29:04] I want to make sure this gets home this
[1:29:06] morning when that star appear to the
[1:29:09] wise men
[1:29:10] that's our seeing something that's our
[1:29:12] seeing a king is coming a king is coming
[1:29:15] a king is coming a king is coming
[1:29:18] Messiah is coming the king of kings is
[1:29:21] coming
[1:29:21] redemption is coming deliverance is
[1:29:24] coming the kingdom is coming power is
[1:29:26] coming listen whatever the Magi is had
[1:29:29] whatever they had over there they
[1:29:31] realize that that sign spoke of
[1:29:34] something more more than they had before
[1:29:36] more than they knew before more than the
[1:29:39] experience before because if what they
[1:29:41] had was enough they didn't need to
[1:29:43] follow the stop but when they saw that
[1:29:45] shine they recognize there's more
[1:29:48] there's more to waking up in the morning
[1:29:50] I'm going to work there's more than
[1:29:54] waking up and baking a ham there's more
[1:29:56] than bacon turkey Messiah is on the
[1:30:00] earth the whole creation the whole of
[1:30:02] nature is groaning for deliverance Oh

[1:30:22] was never a king like this king
[1:30:24] there was never there was never a king
[1:30:28] like this king there was never a lord
[1:30:30] like this Lord somebody preached back to

[1:30:48] keep on your spiritual hat this morning
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:52] and when they came and they saw a young
[1:30:56] child they testified not just with words
[1:30:59] but he they brought a gift to identify
[1:31:03] that they had a revelation of what the
[1:31:06] star was pointing to
[1:31:07] they brought gold to identify his
[1:31:10] kingship their fourth frankincense to
[1:31:14] identify his priesthood and they brought
[1:31:16] mother to identify that he was the
[1:31:18] sacrifice and these men who were not
[1:31:21] from Jerusalem they were not from the
[1:31:23] tribe of Levites they were not from the
[1:31:26] tribe of Israel but God to minister to
[1:31:28] them and find them where they were and
[1:31:31] give them a deeper revelation that
[1:31:33] Messiah was on the earth tub Hera didn't
[1:31:36] know it the priests didn't know it the
[1:31:38] minister's didn't know it the whole of
[1:31:41] Jerusalem the Bible says they were all
[1:31:43] trouble but not these men what was their
[1:31:50] testimony
[1:31:51] they didn't even see a miracle did you
[1:31:55] saw the stuff they didn't see a sign or
[1:31:59] a wonder did you saw the star and that
[1:32:01] star give them enough feet to believe
[1:32:04] the impossible to believe that Messiah
[1:32:07] could be on the earth now can the church
[1:32:09] say Amen oh we're talking about Jesus
[1:32:14] this morning I'm not gonna be too long
[1:32:17] with you but ride with me for a few
[1:32:19] minutes this morning but the Branham and
[1:32:21] the message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:32:23] revealed said he is four talking about
[1:32:25] Jesus is the principal theme of the
[1:32:28] Bible he was in the prophets he was in
[1:32:31] the sounds he was in the history of the
[1:32:33] Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's
[1:32:36] a historical book it's a book of love
[1:32:38] it's a book of songs it's a book of life
[1:32:41] and in there you find Christ he was in
[1:32:44] the prophets he was in the Psalms up he
[1:32:47] was in the history and he
[1:32:49] so in the Bible is the things that is to
[1:32:52] come so he was before until after what
[1:32:55] does that make him then the same
[1:32:56] yesterday today and forever and to us
[1:33:00] this morning he is showing us here
[1:33:02] yesterday the seem too deep and the same
[1:33:05] forever can the church say men Oh
[1:33:10] hallelujah I'm gonna paint a picture of
[1:33:14] the different things that are happening
[1:33:16] around is this birth of Jesus Christ for
[1:33:27] all of the Old Testament but the Branham
[1:33:30] said it's spoke of Jesus he said if you
[1:33:33] read the Bible and if you read a verse
[1:33:35] and don't see Jesus in every verse go
[1:33:37] read it again because he is a principal
[1:33:40] theme of the Bible
[1:33:42] every prophet every messenger every
[1:33:46] apostle every teacher and every believer
[1:33:49] what unites us is not Church or doctrine
[1:33:51] it's Jesus that is what brings us
[1:33:55] together it's because of Jesus whenever
[1:33:58] we lose sight of the Messiah we lose
[1:34:00] sight of the whole picture come the
[1:34:02] church say Amen so the picture is
[1:34:06] painted and God is about to unveil his
[1:34:10] masterpiece we have preached before
[1:34:13] there was so much locked up in God he
[1:34:16] could release it all at once through the
[1:34:18] Old Testament so the attribute in God of
[1:34:22] being a shepherd he used David to
[1:34:26] display the Shepherd attribute of God in
[1:34:30] God was locked up prophet so he used
[1:34:32] Elijah and the prophets to display that
[1:34:35] attribute in God was locked up the
[1:34:37] warrior he will fight your battles when
[1:34:39] God was was he used Joshua to display
[1:34:42] that attribute in God was the attribute
[1:34:45] of a deliverer
[1:34:46] so he used Moses for a small part of his
[1:34:51] story to show he could he could open up
[1:34:54] barren wounds he took Sarah who was
[1:34:57] dried up and opened her womb so short he
[1:35:00] could change any situation
[1:35:03] that he was the resurrection he is the
[1:35:07] resurrection he is the life throughout
[1:35:13] scripture even before Jesus got here we
[1:35:16] see Elijah praying for the boy was dead
[1:35:20] and that boy came to life
[1:35:21] we saw lepers healed we saw miracle I'm
[1:35:25] sorry the axe float we saw men who
[1:35:28] didn't even have the Holy Ghost but
[1:35:30] because they were expressions of his
[1:35:32] attributes he could not help but display
[1:35:35] what was locked up in God they made
[1:35:38] mistake they feel but they could not
[1:35:41] help be an extension of the attribute of
[1:35:43] God because God was fighting the gap
[1:35:46] what was locked up in him expressed it
[1:35:49] it could not have helped him God doesn't
[1:35:52] need healing for himself he doesn't need
[1:35:54] to be delivered he doesn't need a
[1:35:56] miracle it is for people who need the
[1:35:59] healing and need a miracle it makes no
[1:36:02] sense of the God to have it locked up
[1:36:05] I'm nobody can access it
[1:36:07] oh you don't hear me this morning the
[1:36:11] ability of God to open the blind eyes is
[1:36:14] not for his benefit because he is not
[1:36:17] blind you don't hear me this morning
[1:36:20] there the ability of God to make the
[1:36:22] cripples walk is is not for his benefit
[1:36:25] because he is not crippled is his hand
[1:36:28] is not too short that he could oh you
[1:36:30] know him it is morning can we preach a
[1:36:36] little bit so it's been God's business
[1:36:39] to get his attributes to be expressed up
[1:36:42] but when the Branham taught us that God
[1:36:45] needs a vessel he needs somebody to walk
[1:36:48] through it he doesn't want to walk
[1:36:50] through the the nature he wants to use
[1:36:52] somebody so in every age alien the
[1:36:56] mighty man of Valor disorder his
[1:36:59] strength is made perfect in your
[1:37:01] weakness well when Gideon lacked
[1:37:03] confidence and didn't lack self-esteem
[1:37:06] Gideon lack that his strength could be
[1:37:10] made perfect in weakness
[1:37:12] or you don't hear me this morning
[1:37:14] anybody in the house oh and when your
[1:37:19] back is against the wall
[1:37:20] a man like shunga who put the brandon
[1:37:23] described as a farmer with his little
[1:37:25] outfit when your back is against the
[1:37:28] wall in god had the attribute to say
[1:37:32] enough is enough I'm not taking this no
[1:37:35] more
[1:37:35] I'm not taking pressure from the devil
[1:37:37] no more I'm not taking the attack of the
[1:37:40] enemy no more I've worked too hard I've
[1:37:43] struggled too long
[1:37:45] I've given too much I've invested my all
[1:37:50] you don't hear me this morning and when
[1:37:54] shunga saw the Philistines coming shunga
[1:37:57] look around and he took the UPS quota it
[1:38:00] was not shunga it was not the outscored
[1:38:03] but God said that's the attribute of
[1:38:06] when your back is against the wall and
[1:38:08] you need to know it could be done look
[1:38:10] at shunga draw strength from him because
[1:38:13] true Shanga I surely attribute that's in
[1:38:16] me to fight when your back is against
[1:38:19] the wall
[1:38:23] hallelujah hallelujah anybody in the
[1:38:27] house this morning so God is unfeeling
[1:38:31] himself he's unfeeling himself he is
[1:38:34] slowly if my people will humble
[1:38:36] themselves and pray he is using profits
[1:38:39] he's using little boy since you said
[1:38:41] King she's Judy he's using woman he's
[1:38:43] using Hannah I'm the temple who is
[1:38:45] crying out and they are all expressing
[1:38:48] Jesus they're all speaking about Jesus
[1:38:50] they are not living for themselves
[1:38:51] they're not acting for themselves in
[1:38:54] their own little way you're speaking
[1:39:01] about Jesus and then the time came and
[1:39:05] the season changed then the hour came
[1:39:09] and caught had to find a way to slip the
[1:39:12] King onto the it without fanfare without
[1:39:18] attention because it's an infiltration
[1:39:21] because brother branham preach that the
[1:39:24] devil is a corner this evil age so he is
[1:39:27] kind of running things on the earth so
[1:39:28] God wants to bring a nuclear weapon and
[1:39:32] slippered through eternity into time to
[1:39:36] deal with this aberrant issue of Lucifer
[1:39:40] and his fallen angels
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:47] but the law of God requires two
[1:39:51] witnesses for everything to be
[1:39:53] established so he's setting things up
[1:40:00] and he starts off and he starts off with
[1:40:03] a priest who is that kinda half time
[1:40:06] priest he's not a full time priests name
[1:40:07] is Zakaria honest it's his requirement I
[1:40:10] think it's a fortnight in the year once
[1:40:12] in the year he has to go on and offer
[1:40:15] incense while the believers are praying
[1:40:18] he's offering incense to God and he is
[1:40:22] praying for the people but he also
[1:40:25] hasn't me because his wife Elizabeth has
[1:40:27] not had a child and it's been in their
[1:40:29] marriage in their relationship in this
[1:40:31] situation so he has a burden in his
[1:40:34] spirit in his Solem and while he's here
[1:40:36] doing his duties he has a visitor
[1:40:39] straight from the presence of Almighty
[1:40:41] God God sent a secret agent because all
[1:40:45] of the pieces have to be in position
[1:40:48] because the Messiah is coming somebody
[1:40:51] have to roll all the red carpet in
[1:40:54] secret because the devil can know it's
[1:40:57] happening so God sends Gabriel Gabriel
[1:41:00] Hamlet and Gabriel comes to zechariah
[1:41:06] zechariah your prayers have been
[1:41:09] answered
[1:41:10] you've been praying for a long time I
[1:41:12] just want you to know God has heard your
[1:41:14] prayers and I've come to let you know
[1:41:16] what a message to know you've been
[1:41:19] praying and sighing and crying
[1:41:23] Zakaria point incense and he's here Lord
[1:41:26] my wife Lord my house Lord our people
[1:41:29] and the angel Gabriel comes and say your
[1:41:31] prayers answered your wife is gonna have
[1:41:35] a child and Gabriel he disappears but
[1:41:38] he's on a mission because a few months
[1:41:41] later he has another visitation to do a
[1:41:44] little lady named Mary and spouse a man
[1:41:48] called Joseph I know you know the story
[1:41:50] but it's good to talk about Jesus but
[1:41:53] the parents and when we talk about him
[1:41:54] he comes near he loves when we
[1:41:56] about him me we could talk about
[1:41:58] the church we could talk about Jim I
[1:41:59] will talk about Jesus oh he loves to
[1:42:01] come there when you talk about him he
[1:42:03] loves to be the center of our attention
[1:42:06] he loves to be the center of our joy he
[1:42:09] loves to be the reason of the season not
[1:42:11] just in this chamber but in January in
[1:42:14] February in March on Sunday and Monday
[1:42:17] on Tuesday every day with Jesus it's
[1:42:21] sweeter than the day before
[1:42:23] can I just talk to you a little bit I'm
[1:42:26] gonna leave the notes we just wanna just
[1:42:28] talk about Jesus a little bit so here
[1:42:30] comes Mary
[1:42:31] everybody knows the prophecy a virgin
[1:42:35] shall conceive and people don't
[1:42:37] understand it and you know it's called
[1:42:39] talking because whenever Adam said it's
[1:42:41] unusual it's unusual when God talks is
[1:42:45] unusually much don't add up and it's not
[1:42:48] supposed to add up because here from my
[1:42:50] toes are not your thoughts neither I
[1:42:52] want my ways like your way so when I'm
[1:42:54] planning stuff it's all to confuse the
[1:42:56] enemy don't try to figure it out so a
[1:42:59] virgin shall conceive and here comes
[1:43:03] Mary doing what she's normally doing and
[1:43:06] that's usually how it is you go and
[1:43:09] about your normal routine you live in
[1:43:11] your normal life and then something
[1:43:13] interrupts your normal schedule to get
[1:43:16] your attention and here comes this
[1:43:21] Archangel Gabriel here Mary
[1:43:23] so what highly favored blessed art thou
[1:43:27] among all woman and Mary not buying the
[1:43:30] story yet said what you're talking about
[1:43:33] he ever say you're gonna have a child
[1:43:35] and it's his name shall be called
[1:43:36] wonderful his his name shall be called
[1:43:38] counselor his name shall be called and
[1:43:41] Gabriel is describing this think it was
[1:43:43] excited because with for centuries and
[1:43:46] for thousands yes sir three committees
[1:43:48] at the time this has been what they've
[1:43:50] been waiting for and then Mary asked one
[1:43:53] question how shall this thing be and
[1:43:57] give us said the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:44:01] Ghost is going to overshadow you and in
[1:44:04] the message we have seen his time come
[1:44:06] to worship
[1:44:07] but they Branson the Holy Ghost is the
[1:44:08] father so the child is the father's
[1:44:12] child so Mary's exposed to Joseph but
[1:44:19] she's excited because she has this
[1:44:21] message I'm gonna have a baby I'm gonna
[1:44:23] Branham dramatizes and she runs to
[1:44:25] Elizabeth it wasn't a walk and but the
[1:44:29] Branham described he said maybe they hug
[1:44:31] one another how you doing
[1:44:32] hoodie baby coming along and and
[1:44:35] Elizabeth says I'm not too sure you know
[1:44:37] this is about the Branham he says the
[1:44:38] baby hasn't moved it's been six months
[1:44:40] and you know normally by three to four
[1:44:42] months the baby should at least move
[1:44:43] something I'm gonna promise said that
[1:44:48] Mary see what I have something to tell
[1:44:49] you I'm having a baby too so but the
[1:44:54] Branham said Elizabeth I why I didn't
[1:44:55] invite Betty wedding I know you was
[1:45:00] engaged to Joseph but I didn't get Hoke
[1:45:02] I'm your cousin
[1:45:03] oh I didn't invite me I'm Mary see well
[1:45:08] I get to marry him yet I'm gonna Branham
[1:45:14] described you said and Elizabeth it's
[1:45:15] like what you telling me what you're
[1:45:19] talking about you uses to marry you you
[1:45:22] know you livin right you what you're
[1:45:24] talking about
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:28] I'm gonna pranam said Mary's as I
[1:45:31] described her experience with the angel
[1:45:36] and she's describing it and the angel
[1:45:38] told me this and he angel told me that
[1:45:41] and the angel told me and then she got
[1:45:43] to the pot and the angel told me his
[1:45:45] name will be called and she started
[1:45:48] calling him names and be the Planum said
[1:45:51] when the name of Jesus was spoken John
[1:45:54] in his mother's womb who hadn't moved
[1:45:56] before but the prams had the Holy Ghost
[1:45:59] filled John in his mother's womb he was
[1:46:03] filled with the Holy Ghost he was born
[1:46:06] from his mother's womb with a black ism
[1:46:08] after Holy Ghost at the name of Jesus
[1:46:12] there's still power in the name of Jesus
[1:46:21] hallelujah
[1:46:22] we know the story I'm not gonna be too
[1:46:25] long but we love talking about Jesus so
[1:46:28] everything is getting into place because
[1:46:30] John has to forerun the coming of Christ
[1:46:34] somebody has to roll out the red carpet
[1:46:37] for the King to walk on it come on now
[1:46:40] so John has a mission to foreign the
[1:46:44] coming after Messiah meanwhile why this
[1:46:51] is going on the wise men are walking all
[1:46:56] of this happening the wise men on their
[1:46:57] journey before the first visitation the
[1:47:00] wise men already left because but around
[1:47:03] say it takes about two years so then
[1:47:04] fellas to get there so Mary no gain
[1:47:08] would be wise men already know because
[1:47:10] they have seen this sign
[1:47:11] they have seen his star in the east and
[1:47:14] they're coming on the expectation for a
[1:47:18] perfect timing can the church say Amen
[1:47:20] oh can we give the Lord a hand oh praise
[1:47:24] [Applause]
[1:47:36] glory hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory
[1:47:45] but the Branham is so wonderful in this
[1:47:48] message he say how Mary would have told
[1:47:49] me is it but he looked so pretty but if
[1:47:51] Adam describes you whole thing and where
[1:47:55] the random goes on to speak about how
[1:47:57] God moves things around for his purpose
[1:48:00] and he brings out in the same message
[1:48:03] and when you got time he could read it
[1:48:05] how God uses visions and uses dreams and
[1:48:10] he speaks of how a prophet is able to
[1:48:13] combine his subconscious and his
[1:48:15] conscious together so with his eyes open
[1:48:18] he could see a vision but unless you're
[1:48:20] a prophet God has to wait until normal
[1:48:24] man goes to sleep and his consciousness
[1:48:26] is asleep for his subconscious to be
[1:48:30] active for God to present himself in a
[1:48:32] dream so Joseph's brother Branham said
[1:48:35] is an honorable man he's wondering how
[1:48:38] to handle this situation how to deal
[1:48:40] with a situation with this Mary and
[1:48:43] Aqaba lead you you can imagine the
[1:48:45] turmoil how a handle in this situation
[1:48:47] and then God visits Joseph in a dream
[1:48:50] and say Joseph don't be afraid to take
[1:48:54] your wife because what is in her is of
[1:48:58] the Holy Ghost and God use a dream with
[1:49:01] her God is a dream with the wise men and
[1:49:04] God is fixing things around because this
[1:49:07] has to happen in perfect order Jesus is
[1:49:12] about to be born
[1:49:13] and harrogate inspired ezd government
[1:49:15] inspired to raise taxes because the law
[1:49:21] have to change the drive Mary to have
[1:49:23] the baby where he baby is supposed to be
[1:49:26] born and but the Branham says it was not
[1:49:30] easy for Mary I'm Bella Branham
[1:49:32] dramatized the conversation he said Mary
[1:49:34] will be saying to Joseph Joseph don't
[1:49:35] worry we're gonna make it we're not
[1:49:37] gonna be only ones on your road is other
[1:49:39] people after go to if we get in trouble
[1:49:42] we will get help when you wrote somebody
[1:49:43] will help a pregnant I'm gonna run
[1:49:46] described is a donkey that they would
[1:49:48] have gone on what
[1:49:49] donkey that was to carry the King I want
[1:49:52] you to go back the echo back had time
[1:49:54] with me to see this whole thing
[1:49:55] unfolding and to see the journey with
[1:49:58] Mary going through the night and brother
[1:50:01] Brandon said imagine Mary with ax Joe
[1:50:03] said do you want to take a ride on the
[1:50:04] donkey now because I've been on the
[1:50:06] donkey whole time and Joseph say no no
[1:50:07] no you stay there because you're
[1:50:09] carrying a baby and by the Branham is
[1:50:11] revealing this whole thing as it unfolds
[1:50:14] and falls and falls over time my mom
[1:50:17] says when God allowed the taxes to be
[1:50:20] raised God will do whatever he needs to
[1:50:22] do and will allow what the devil does to
[1:50:25] get him praise also so every action or
[1:50:28] reaction to you is for his purpose and
[1:50:31] for his honor
[1:50:32] and for his glory can the church say man
[1:50:35] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:50:40] but the madam said while he was thinking
[1:50:42] on these things he was a good man he
[1:50:44] didn't want his own name Maude
[1:50:45] but the balance said Joseph was thinking
[1:50:47] about being a shield for her and brother
[1:50:49] branham goes on and on and he's bringing
[1:50:51] out his whole beautiful Christmas story
[1:50:53] can the church say man glory glory glory
[1:50:59] glory glory and he said I went God
[1:51:02] reveal himself to Joseph he said when a
[1:51:04] man can reveal that Jesus Christ is the
[1:51:06] same yesterday today and forever no
[1:51:08] matter how many Creed tried to turn it
[1:51:09] back you're glad to be a shield so he
[1:51:12] said Joseph became a shield for Mary
[1:51:14] you're happy to be a shield
[1:51:15] let them say whatever you got a big
[1:51:17] she'll updated not the fiery darts off
[1:51:19] he said I hope I don't get too loud for
[1:51:22] them out there let them hear it too they
[1:51:24] ought to notice it you're happy to be a
[1:51:25] shield you're a doormat whatever wants
[1:51:28] to be it doesn't matter it's been
[1:51:30] revealed to you by the Lord and the Lord
[1:51:32] of Shirdi you by his word is the truth
[1:51:34] and confirm it to you to make it live
[1:51:36] again yeah it is mine nothing to go on
[1:51:38] can the church see man Oh glory glory
[1:51:42] glory can the church say man glory
[1:51:48] hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah but
[1:51:53] a random said I went Christ was being
[1:51:55] formed and Mary quickly come the Kings
[1:51:57] commandment all you people just as she
[1:51:59] was the Christ was becoming a baby ready
[1:52:01] to be delivered right then the
[1:52:03] persecution but this is coming in the
[1:52:06] last days when the completeness when the
[1:52:08] fullness of the Godhead when the
[1:52:10] fullness of Christ is to be manifested
[1:52:12] among his people he promises in his word
[1:52:14] and when that full as you see there is
[1:52:16] unusual things begin to happen that he
[1:52:18] promised that's the reason or a great
[1:52:20] social lives and things can't understand
[1:52:23] it
[1:52:23] it's foolishness to them now watch their
[1:52:25] formula council of churches just the
[1:52:28] time when the church is beginning to get
[1:52:30] to its feet where the supernatural is
[1:52:32] going to begin to work now they all went
[1:52:35] into that group and they're gonna try to
[1:52:36] stop his stuff so but the Branham is
[1:52:38] seen as Mary's about to have the baby
[1:52:40] all the persecution begins to rise up
[1:52:43] but Brown said this we see when you're
[1:52:45] praying and your boat a breakthrough
[1:52:47] that's the hottest pot just before you
[1:52:49] break through just before your blessing
[1:52:52] that's when the persecution begins Oh
[1:52:55] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:58] hallelujah my on Easter dear and brother
[1:53:01] branham is dramatizing he said Mary
[1:53:03] wasn't pain and after a while he comes
[1:53:05] out at the top of the hill and once
[1:53:07] again they look over into the city when
[1:53:09] they were both born over in Bethlehem
[1:53:10] the lights of the city many was there
[1:53:12] places was crowded people on the outside
[1:53:15] sleeping underground out along in the
[1:53:17] fields and the question perhaps the
[1:53:20] first time it struck Joseph what will I
[1:53:21] do if I can't find a place because this
[1:53:25] baby might be born tonight she's been in
[1:53:28] peeing all day so what if the baby is
[1:53:30] gonna be born tonight and but the
[1:53:31] Branham is dramatized and he said
[1:53:33] they're looking down across the valley
[1:53:35] wandering his eyes happen to look over
[1:53:36] sideways and he saw a strange sight you
[1:53:40] know it's usually right in time of
[1:53:41] trouble when supernatural things happen
[1:53:44] and he looked over there and he saw a
[1:53:45] star he had never remembered seeing one
[1:53:48] so big it looked so low like it was
[1:53:52] hanging right over Bethlehem and he
[1:53:54] looked up on etern after he helped Mary
[1:53:56] up on a rock to rest a little while he
[1:53:58] turn around to say dear did you ever
[1:54:00] notice and he could even see his
[1:54:02] reflection listen to the Prophet he
[1:54:04] could see the stars reflection in her
[1:54:06] pretty black eyes it's as if the problem
[1:54:09] is standing right there watching this
[1:54:11] whole thing unfold and look smiling dear
[1:54:13] isn't that strange he said Joseph honey
[1:54:15] I have
[1:54:16] that's in the Sun went down I've been
[1:54:18] watching that stuff somehow another I
[1:54:20] feel really strange tonight that
[1:54:23] something is fixing to happen
[1:54:25] he said it's usually that way you know
[1:54:27] you have that strange feeling as you
[1:54:30] begin to watch the star enjoys it the
[1:54:31] little mule taking his rest breeding and
[1:54:33] they watch the sir it had an odd action
[1:54:35] to it it didn't act like the rest of
[1:54:38] stars it it seemed to be Restless moving
[1:54:40] it was waiting for something watching
[1:54:42] for something to happen
[1:54:43] Oh glory glory glory glory and whenever
[1:54:47] I said no let's leave our little couple
[1:54:48] right here on the rock for a minute so
[1:54:52] but abandon leaves them on the rock and
[1:54:53] travels on the way back over to India to
[1:54:57] speak about the wise men and how God
[1:54:59] declares his doings in the heavens
[1:55:02] before he does it on it and he speaks of
[1:55:04] these wise men came from the line of
[1:55:06] wise men and Daniel was the Prophet he
[1:55:08] was their master and God is no respecter
[1:55:12] of person so he could use anybody and
[1:55:15] these men believed that there was one
[1:55:17] Gordon they would study the night and
[1:55:19] study the Stars and it would burn fire
[1:55:21] at night and the watch and the worship
[1:55:23] and every night they would climb up
[1:55:25] there as soon as the Sun went down and
[1:55:26] study these things just like we get
[1:55:29] together at conferences and study the
[1:55:30] Bible and word by word
[1:55:32] they knowed every move of them Stars and
[1:55:35] one night where they were obvious
[1:55:37] tutting and no wonder it was most
[1:55:38] alarming when a visitor appeared among
[1:55:40] them a stranger they had never seen that
[1:55:42] study for didn't know what was this was
[1:55:45] there no wonder they were alarmed they
[1:55:47] didn't know what to do about it
[1:55:48] it was a phenomena so it caught the
[1:55:50] attention has done something caught your
[1:55:53] attention to bring you to this great
[1:55:55] gospel to bring you to this great
[1:55:57] message to bring you to this great
[1:55:59] moment Oh hallelujah hallelujah brother
[1:56:04] Branham goes on I'm going to skip
[1:56:05] through it because I've already touched
[1:56:06] it but when the man said divine healing
[1:56:08] is for the believers the Holy Ghost is
[1:56:11] to them that believe not to the
[1:56:13] unbelievers and the only journey with
[1:56:16] their gold and frankincense and myrrh
[1:56:18] Oh hallelujah can we give the Lord a
[1:56:21] hand up praise
[1:56:25] I'm gonna balance ed on their journey
[1:56:27] they watched he said they never took
[1:56:29] anybody's would they didn't go down and
[1:56:32] consult any bishop or anything God gave
[1:56:34] them a sign they'd seen it it was the
[1:56:36] truth they took out after it it left
[1:56:39] away it was the one the scripture
[1:56:41] predicted to and friends that's what's
[1:56:44] needed today it's a revelation from God
[1:56:46] to follow the sign what is our sign
[1:56:49] annuity is the prophets message because
[1:56:52] he was a star in the hand of God for our
[1:56:54] day and he didn't point him to himself
[1:56:56] he said I'm his ability nomination
[1:56:59] I made the popular people to myself but
[1:57:01] I'm pointing to the resurrected Christ
[1:57:03] I'm pointing to Jesus Christ the same
[1:57:05] yesterday today and forever and that's
[1:57:09] the message that we hold to our hearts
[1:57:11] today Oh hallelujah but if I said nobody
[1:57:16] outside but he's men saw it he said
[1:57:19] nobody saw the light that Paul saw when
[1:57:22] it struck him on the road to Damascus Oh
[1:57:24] hallelujah
[1:57:26] oh he said but when you are looking for
[1:57:30] it when you are ready to receive the
[1:57:32] real Christmas present the real
[1:57:34] Christmas give God's Christ give the
[1:57:36] Holy Spirit you're looking fit you see
[1:57:38] it's a heaven light send down from God
[1:57:40] out of heaven to be a record of Jesus
[1:57:42] Christ they didn't take anybody else
[1:57:45] word for it in the tea time it was
[1:57:47] Restless to see oh I just can't wait I
[1:57:49] don't know how much longer we'll go we
[1:57:50] will probably go to Jerusalem remember
[1:57:52] the light only shines in darkness it's
[1:57:54] the only way it's recognized if we live
[1:57:56] in the dark time so where the my name is
[1:57:59] Brainard in the daytime they couldn't
[1:58:01] see the star so they would be rested but
[1:58:03] at night when you see the star come out
[1:58:04] they would be able to follow it on down
[1:58:07] through the rivers through the sandbars
[1:58:09] and everything else and by the random
[1:58:10] types all of this as true your struggles
[1:58:12] through your trials through your journey
[1:58:15] to your situation you are following the
[1:58:17] revealed Word you are following Jesus
[1:58:19] Christ the light of the world straight
[1:58:21] to your promise hallelujah brother
[1:58:27] Branham said and I just want to get his
[1:58:28] words in it and look Bethlehem was
[1:58:31] exactly in line with Judea from where
[1:58:33] they and Jerusalem was in line with
[1:58:35] Bethlehem or what
[1:58:36] symbol if you can catch it here's
[1:58:38] Bethlehem and Jerusalem is up here and
[1:58:40] from where the Magi was coming they had
[1:58:42] to come to the ruslan first because
[1:58:44] before coming to Bethlehem I'm not gonna
[1:58:46] be too much longer do you get it the
[1:58:48] great big self-styled anomaly National
[1:58:50] Headquarters yes sir Jerusalem where all
[1:58:53] the denominations met together the Great
[1:58:55] Council met there so when these men they
[1:58:57] came and they come to this city and they
[1:59:00] taught there it is if anybody will know
[1:59:03] about this and can explain this great
[1:59:05] mystery light to us there's all the high
[1:59:08] priests here there's a doctors of
[1:59:10] divinity here there's all the PhD and
[1:59:12] elderly Oh brethren Jerusalem is in
[1:59:14] sight here we go we'll have it right
[1:59:16] into the streets there bull said where
[1:59:18] you going we got a great message where
[1:59:20] is it we see that's born King of the
[1:59:22] Jews who is this mystery light up there
[1:59:25] but Abraham said the cry goes out and
[1:59:29] nobody responded nobody knows what's
[1:59:33] going on they are sitting on with all
[1:59:36] the scrolls from the prophet Moses they
[1:59:39] have all the books and tips and they
[1:59:42] have no idea because they were not
[1:59:45] looking for the sign
[1:59:46] oh hallelujah glory
[1:59:51] hmm he said what's the matter what you
[1:59:55] see but ever I said it didn't have the
[1:59:57] answer and what I believed and said they
[1:59:59] haven't got it today they don't know
[2:00:01] what these things are where they ought
[2:00:03] to know it where the great heads of
[2:00:05] churches ought to be aware of these
[2:00:06] things but God always works in the
[2:00:09] minority and so humble that it goes
[2:00:12] right over top of them they don't know
[2:00:14] it but he fulfills his would like that
[2:00:17] that's it we get our own self twisted up
[2:00:20] in these great big things and we can't
[2:00:22] move God cut us free from them things
[2:00:24] then we can see what our we're living in
[2:00:27] if God has to walk through a dream again
[2:00:29] he can reveal it to you sure he said
[2:00:33] they had not the answer of them as
[2:00:35] serious like they didn't know they
[2:00:36] didn't have it at the headquarters
[2:00:37] neither do they have it today so what
[2:00:40] did they do they call for the Word of
[2:00:42] God he said that's the idea
[2:00:43] this says let's look up in the will of
[2:00:45] God and final where these things are and
[2:00:48] when they call for the
[2:00:49] word of god the Magi was smarter than a
[2:00:51] lot of people today the Magi saw
[2:00:53] according to the Word of God and it
[2:00:55] didn't have it and wasn't going to get
[2:00:56] it the phone know that there wasn't even
[2:01:00] the city that wasn't even a place he was
[2:01:01] to be born in Bethlehem of Judea of the
[2:01:04] least the humblest among all of them the
[2:01:06] little bitty tiny place not the big cell
[2:01:09] sty the wise men seen right quick the
[2:01:12] Word of God revealed it and I didn't
[2:01:14] have it and wasn't going to get it so
[2:01:15] they got out of that mess if we could
[2:01:18] just do the same get out of the mess
[2:01:21] where the random said after the girls
[2:01:23] are the mess then the supernatural
[2:01:25] appeared again so when around said while
[2:01:28] I were in Jerusalem trying to find out
[2:01:30] where Christ was gonna be born to start
[2:01:32] hid himself the star disappeared but
[2:01:35] when it came out of Jerusalem there the
[2:01:37] star appeared again there it was he said
[2:01:40] after they got cut loose from those
[2:01:42] things after they got out of all them
[2:01:44] conglomeration of their fussing arguing
[2:01:47] and everything down there with all the
[2:01:48] big headquarters was and the big high
[2:01:50] priests and doctors of divinity and and
[2:01:52] then walked around and what's the matter
[2:01:57] with these crazy people so they turned
[2:01:59] their cameras and got away from it but a
[2:02:03] man said as long as you tied up with a
[2:02:04] bunch of unbelievers I don't believe
[2:02:06] these things you'll never be able you'll
[2:02:07] be as blind as a bat
[2:02:09] cut yourself away from everything
[2:02:12] said of his mother father sister brother
[2:02:15] denomination or whatever it is
[2:02:17] he said he that won't forsake his own
[2:02:19] and come after me it's not even worthy
[2:02:21] to be called mine but a man said it
[2:02:24] means just what it says the Bible said
[2:02:26] is of no private interpretation if it's
[2:02:29] black is black and white as white as a
[2:02:31] prophets would it's the ultimate
[2:02:33] it's the absolute and every man that's
[2:02:35] born of the Spirit of God is tighter
[2:02:37] that no matter nothing will separate him
[2:02:40] from it he's tied to that word because
[2:02:42] it's Christ Christ is the word and
[2:02:44] Christ kind of lie about his word for he
[2:02:47] is the word and you and you say well I
[2:02:50] know he said that but he said there
[2:02:51] ain't no but and nothing about it he
[2:02:54] just said it that way and that's what it
[2:02:57] is he cannot change it he can't he's
[2:02:59] unchangeable
[2:03:00] he said heaven and earth will pass away
[2:03:02] but my words shall never pass away can
[2:03:05] the church say a man so I just want to
[2:03:09] touch on our star and we begin to wind
[2:03:11] down but the random said in exposition
[2:03:15] of the seven church it is the sedition
[2:03:16] churchy so we see that the seven spirits
[2:03:19] actually refer to the one Spirit of God
[2:03:22] working out the will and would have
[2:03:25] caught in different generations I would
[2:03:27] like to illustrate that from the word
[2:03:28] the spirit of god was mightily upon
[2:03:31] elisha
[2:03:32] then that same spirit came upon elijah
[2:03:36] in a two-fold effect then centuries
[2:03:39] later the same spirit which we call a
[2:03:41] spirit of Elijah in order to describe
[2:03:44] its ministry came back upon John the
[2:03:46] Baptist one day that seems per
[2:03:49] identified by the same manner of
[2:03:51] ministry will come upon a man for the
[2:03:54] end of the Gentile church age he's
[2:03:56] speaking about himself now again the
[2:03:58] scripture says that God anointed Jesus
[2:04:01] of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
[2:04:03] power and he went about doing good
[2:04:05] healing all that was oppressed of the
[2:04:07] devil as Jesus went away he told his
[2:04:09] side was a Terry until Pentecost at
[2:04:13] which time the very same spirit that was
[2:04:16] upon him we'll come back and fall upon
[2:04:18] them and fill them then that called out
[2:04:22] body the church would be in his stead
[2:04:24] upon the earth taking his place and
[2:04:26] because that same spirit that was in him
[2:04:29] would be in them they were do the very
[2:04:31] same works and any people that is truly
[2:04:35] the body of Jesus Christ the true church
[2:04:37] will manifest the same works as did
[2:04:40] Jesus and the Pentecostal church because
[2:04:42] the same spirit will be in them any
[2:04:45] other Church that does not have the
[2:04:47] spirit and the manifestations is going
[2:04:49] to have to account to God it also says
[2:04:52] here that these seven stars or seven
[2:04:55] messengers to the seven church ages are
[2:04:58] in his hand he is holding them you know
[2:05:01] right away that if they are held in his
[2:05:03] hand they are associated with his power
[2:05:06] that is what the hand signifies it
[2:05:09] signifies the power of God and authority
[2:05:12] of God not one of them came in his own
[2:05:14] power
[2:05:15] and authority that is what Paul said no
[2:05:18] man would dare to it takes the authority
[2:05:20] of God and the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:22] the gospel is preached by the authority
[2:05:25] of God in the power of the Spirit these
[2:05:28] men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost
[2:05:30] they all stood up to the world they
[2:05:32] could do that they were full of God they
[2:05:34] were sent o authorized by God not myself
[2:05:36] or other men and in the pathways vision
[2:05:40] last major quote but Abraham said the
[2:05:42] mystery of the seven stars in Revelation
[2:05:45] which thou sawest in my right hand and
[2:05:47] the Seven golden candlesticks the seven
[2:05:50] stars are the angels or messengers of
[2:05:52] the seven Church Ages and the seven
[2:05:55] candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[2:05:57] seven churches we have already
[2:05:59] discovered the truth of these two
[2:06:01] mysteries oh we haven't revealed who
[2:06:03] these seven messengers will but by the
[2:06:05] help of God we will and that miss you
[2:06:07] will be accomplished the seven ages we
[2:06:09] know they are listed in the world and we
[2:06:11] will deal with each so as to come up to
[2:06:13] this last age in which we live but in
[2:06:16] one last closing glimpse of this chapter
[2:06:18] see him as he stands there in the midst
[2:06:21] of the golden lampstands with the seven
[2:06:23] stars in his right hand oh it is
[2:06:25] breathtaking to see him standing there
[2:06:28] it is supreme deity he is the judge the
[2:06:31] priest the king the eagle the lamb the
[2:06:33] lion the alpha to Omega the beginning
[2:06:36] and the end the Father Son Holy Ghost he
[2:06:39] which was which is which is to come the
[2:06:42] Almighty they all in all they he is the
[2:06:45] author and finisher worry is that lamb
[2:06:48] he proved his words as he brought our
[2:06:51] salvation by himself
[2:06:52] no he stands in all of his power and all
[2:06:56] of his glory all things committed unto
[2:06:58] Him as church yes they stands amidst the
[2:07:02] lamp stands with the stars in his hand
[2:07:05] it is night for that is when we use
[2:07:08] lamps for the light and that is when the
[2:07:10] stars are seen shining and reflecting
[2:07:13] the light of the Sun and it is dark the
[2:07:16] church is walking by feet in the
[2:07:18] darkness her Lord departed is all but
[2:07:21] the Holy Spirit still shines out through
[2:07:23] the church giving light it is all sink
[2:07:26] first world and those stars reflect his
[2:07:29] light also and the only light they have
[2:07:31] is his liked how dark it is how
[2:07:35] spiritually cold yet when he comes into
[2:07:37] the midst of it his light and warm the
[2:07:40] truth is empowered and through him does
[2:07:42] the works that he did oh that he might
[2:07:45] get a glimpse of him as did John what
[2:07:47] manner of people we ought to be standing
[2:07:50] before him at that day but the random
[2:07:52] now begins to sweetie said if you
[2:07:54] haven't already given your life to him
[2:07:56] may you tell in your heart to go this
[2:07:58] moment and kneel down right where you
[2:08:00] are and ask his forgiveness for your
[2:08:02] sins and surrender your life to Him can
[2:08:05] the church say ma'am and I love in the
[2:08:09] same message we have found we have seen
[2:08:11] his star and come to worship but there
[2:08:13] Branham after speaking about all of this
[2:08:15] she begins to switch and a musician can
[2:08:17] play softly he said I got a good
[2:08:20] business I know it's flourishing he's
[2:08:22] saying that's what somebody might say
[2:08:24] brother do you know one of these days a
[2:08:26] heart attack might take you at 4:00 in
[2:08:27] the morning and you have to leave that
[2:08:29] business then where you're going after
[2:08:31] that he said when you love to have that
[2:08:35] wouldn't that be the greatest Christmas
[2:08:36] present anybody could get the gift of
[2:08:39] eternal life God so loved the world he
[2:08:42] gave His only begotten Son that
[2:08:43] whosoever believeth in him should not
[2:08:45] perish but have everlasting life we have
[2:08:48] seen his star in the east and have come
[2:08:51] to worship Him
[2:08:52] civilization has traveled with the Sun
[2:08:55] from the east coming west we are in the
[2:08:57] West Coast now East and West has met we
[2:08:59] can go no further the oldest
[2:09:02] civilization is China plumb back the
[2:09:04] other side of the will remember is gone
[2:09:06] and sinners travel with civilization
[2:09:09] every thought of man is continually evil
[2:09:12] is just like it was in the days of Noah
[2:09:13] till it even grieve God that he ever
[2:09:16] made man but he has a little church that
[2:09:19] he wants to take he's got many thousands
[2:09:22] laying sleeping in it first watch second
[2:09:24] watch third fourth fifth six and this is
[2:09:26] the seven watch remember that's when he
[2:09:28] come in the seven watch and in that
[2:09:31] watch he found wise virgins and which
[2:09:33] that had the oil out of their lamp oil
[2:09:36] is a symbol of the Holy Spirit if you
[2:09:38] haven't found that
[2:09:39] your lamb today my brother sister why

[2:10:25] outside wasn't very much but all the
[2:10:28] inside is eternal life won't you let

[2:10:32] strike your life tonight and lead you to
[2:10:35] eternal eyes

[2:10:40] over the building you can stand to your
[2:10:45] feet we're getting ready to close that
[2:10:46] and I'm gonna continue reading what the
[2:10:50] Prophet said on that message he said in
[2:10:52] the quietness of this moment this little
[2:10:55] chopped-up if I call it a Christmas
[2:10:56] message one of them if you really
[2:10:58] believe it to be the truth and you've
[2:11:00] never yet found that eternal life you've
[2:11:04] never let the Great Holy Spirit lead you
[2:11:06] to that light would you just speak just
[2:11:09] now in your heart and say Lord Jesus I
[2:11:10] want to find that light I don't care

[2:11:43] have to look to the world you know God's
[2:11:44] great gifts always meek man exchange
[2:11:48] look at Moses a great theologian great
[2:11:51] scholar but one day he met a light on
[2:11:53] the backside of the desert he took off
[2:11:55] his shoes a man 80 years old and
[2:11:57] whiskers hanging down to his waistline
[2:11:59] put his wife and his baby in a moon and
[2:12:01] a mule and went down to Egypt we got a
[2:12:04] whole army to take over for him that's a
[2:12:09] little thing friend that's twisting at
[2:12:10] your heart tonight he had found a flight
[2:12:13] that's the supernatural at the light of
[2:12:16] the day won't you let it lead you to
[2:12:18] Jesus Christ which can only give you
[2:12:20] life
[2:12:21] is there one listen to the prophet that
[2:12:24] hasn't raised their hands would say
[2:12:26] remember me brother Branham in prayer
[2:12:28] now god bless you another another is
[2:12:32] there anybody else who hasn't raised a
[2:12:33] man say I wanna fall I want to follow

[2:12:38] and find my Jesus this day I want to get
[2:12:42] away from all this here Christmas tinsel
[2:12:44] and things because someday it's going to
[2:12:47] be burnt with unquenchable fire and all
[2:12:50] those who are in tolerating with it will
[2:12:53] be burned with it the world a sinner
[2:12:55] will punished and it will perish with
[2:12:57] the world the woody loving people will
[2:12:59] perish with the wool and if you have
[2:13:01] those tell the love of the world in you
[2:13:03] you want to sell yourself completely

[2:13:18] what difference does have made by the
[2:13:20] Branham
[2:13:20] I'm ready madam said raising your hand
[2:13:22] is the difference between death and life
[2:13:26] he said if that hand went up like that
[2:13:29] and you really meant that there's
[2:13:31] something by you what is it that's the
[2:13:33] light I'm talking about that's a light
[2:13:35] that tells you I've been wrong there's
[2:13:37] will in me I don't want it anymore I'll
[2:13:40] raise up my hand that's a testimony
