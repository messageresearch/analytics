said that God does not have to destroy man man will destroy himself you see and we see that the destruction that has taken place but at the same time is just a sign to us all that the bride is getting herself ready amen I remember a bishop a Pentecostal bishop with a very thundering voice friend of brother Coleman amen he spoke a few words in the old church and was Becky was it on behalf of grandma Coleman the funeral and he was just saying a few words and he said well bless God goodbye world and good morning glory and and it's just the way he said that Amen it just kind of took me over to the other side and we're saying goodbye world good morning glory amen again Omegas dark shore is getting darker and darker and darker we all know that but you know just before the rising of the Sun Amen we know how brother Branham spoke that it gets dark darker and darker but there's a new day coming that is why I'm so happy amen if you're not happy to be a Christian today I feel sorry if you're if you're in this message and you don't have something to be happy about I feel sorry for you I pray for you and we have so much to thank God for oh you asked me and I will tell you you ask me why I'm

with all my heart with all my soul with all my mind you may be seated praise the Lord I'm sorry I just had to get that out of me amen let us enter into his courts with praise as the Bible says and Thanksgiving amen and that's the reason we are here we're so happy to be back this morning and I'm so anxious for a part - Amen hallelujah how many were blessed last night praise this wonderful name you know I the Bible says in Proverbs you see a word in due season how good it is anyone can speak a word you know and is though but in due season how good it is and this is why I feel good because the word was spoken in season last night amen so therefore if you have any word in you you've got to feel good how good it is Amen I appreciate my good friend brother Theo but we all do amen hallelujah as I said last night he has taken time to from his very busy schedule to drop in and be a blessing to us from which we are so thankful for him too you know he leaves his family he leaves his church and just trying to be a blessing to God's people everywhere no one really knows really what a minister goes through there's a lot of mountains is a lot valleys but when a man of God is called God call men very different than just men but God called Abraham said he cannot even send a revival unless he has men ready to carry out that revival so therefore as sure as he has promised a revival he's preparing men to carried out a man and we all know there's so much has been spoken about the FIFO ministry and who is this and who was that brother Graham said if you love me call me brother man you see the fivefold ministry is the business of God amen God has put in a church some apostles teachers evangelists and so forth and you know he will anoint his men with a certain anointing that it will speak for itself I remember I had a very interesting conversation with a with a another brother one time and I we were debating whether this person should be called this and that the title was over they said you know if I said he is or he's not it doesn't make him any less I said my word doesn't make him bad God has put in a church amen and it'll speak for itself say Amen so we see the revival and the move of the Holy Spirit around the world is because God has trained his men amen through the fire through the struggle through the battles and that is all to mold character because he wants one day to put his men in position and we realize without you no power without character what would we do look like Joseph Amen he come out finally out of the prison and he was even we see him in the next scene on the right hand of Pharaoh he had power but he had to meet his brethren he could have now if he acted any other way the history of the Bible certainly would have been very different today but I believe with all my heart he went through all that he had to go through for a purpose to mould character amen amen before because he could have done great damage to his family but when he recognized his family you know what did he do he he sob and he cried and he saw how can I have anything against you I mean I mean the whole thing was a plan anyway you didn't know it was a plan I didn't even know it was a plan but God's purpose will be fulfilled Amen even if there are many things that we don't even know I'm going to tell you something God is leading us somewhere but before we arrived we've got to go through certain things we've got to go through certain problems we've got to go to certain fiery trials and we wonder why why why is because amen well Joseph remain in jail not one day longer a one day earlier until God knew that he was ready so don't try to rush God out of your trial he knows when to take one and when to call you out Amen praise God so I appreciate these God called men and I want to on behalf of the church here apologize for I think we had some technical difficulties with the streaming online I think the sound went off about 3/4 into the message or so but we got the entirety but we copied the DVD so it's I'm going to send it to brother Isaac to have them put about to put it up on the on YouTube and we are committed now to really upgrade our system to make sure that these things don't don't happen again because the world is dying the world is longing for reality for so long we have heard so many is it so many wonderful messages you know it's blessed us but at the end of the day the life has got to end up in you and I I was so blessed when brother Theo was sharing with me about a message that was preached by a minister about power power and for the very beginning in Genesis as long as God was in the human heart and that man was given power over the elements over whatever you see but today everybody wants power but what is lacking is that man on the throne that's the only way anything outside of that is his control its control control control you control that control this church control that jerk you can't go you know people become members of church and they they check in and they can't get out that's not God's church amen the Church of the Living God is free with one body praise the Lord and love one another so with that revelation you see the power will be there I believe in the church and in the manifest manifests his sons of God but we must remember the key thing you'll have Authority and you'll have power and you'll have control as long as he is in your throne that's the way it was in the beginning anything else outside of that was not so from the beginning praise this wonderful name god bless you richly so I want to welcome you off to the original faith Gospel Tabernacle we are a small Church here in New York where we love the Lord Jesus and doing our best to hold the banner up high of his endtime message this is a big city and we all know that people often say here we live to work and work to live very few moments to really take a breath and pull aside and to just think about the things of God and things like that but we in New York is we're tough we have to be tough if not then the devil really will take advantage and I think the bride today we have got to have an attitude Devlin I'm sick of you I mean the devil bombard you with thoughts mind battles all kinds and we don't say anything back hey man I like what brother a brother from Nigeria told me one time their favorite saying in Nigeria said Do You Know Who I am perhaps hey Do You Know Who I am they may not be anybody but Do You Know Who I am amen Do You Know Who I am and that death question right there just like makes the other person amen but you have to tell that that would you know who I am I am the son of a king a man not only you're saying that Amen but you're manifesting that glory be to God and he should be more afraid of you than you are of him so we're so thankful I didn't get a chance to get all the names and so forth that were here yesterday and but I want to I want to greet where the Nick Edmonds god bless you richly from Pennsylvania rather femi penny and sister virtue God blessed from Nigeria god bless you and and brother are you the one from Ohio yes and you ivory Coles you live in Ohio you took about bus about ten hours or so God richly bless you amen [Applause] and there's a family in the back there god bless you richly you're welcome amen I see my friend I have I can't say my good old friend brother Mike mail he's really hot trying to hide behind by the eyes yeah thank you I see him clearly now amen been around a long time and brother Dean Julian walk up plac'd is in the house in sister Porsha god bless you welcome we love it each and every one of you and I'm ready for the word are you a man I'm ready for the word and I told her the feel over this pulpit is his pulpit let I mean speak whatever is on your heart amen and he was speaking yesterday regarding a kingdom but there's a quote that come to my mind and I just want to read it real quick before we have our brother because in the seat of discrepancy brother Branham says here now now we live through Luther's age Wesley's age the Methodist age all down through the ages and the Pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the word each age is given a promise of the word see and they have to come up to that promise of that word even though it may be a lot lower than what our word is of course it was and the people of that age that manifested that promise word is the see of that age hey men so remember the people that manifested amen the seed of that age amen the promise were for that eight is a cedar hey you want to know who is C well it's not just saying I'm C amen it'd have to be manifested amen and those that manifest that word is the seed of that age oh it's manifesting time I better not start singing I like to sing amen the seed of that age according to what Jesus said right here they are all children of the kingdom that's right now listen this is it the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seed of the kingdom at that age so whenever you see the Holy Spirit operating Amen among his people those are the seeds of the kingdom glory be to God so they don't question or or a wonder why are people shouting and glorifying God and why the Spirit of God is moving we are manifesting the seed of our age glory be to god I'm so thankful Eamon I will never be ashamed of this gospel amen because it's the power of God unto salvation call me crazy amen amen is too late amen hallelujah listen listen I paint criticize ostracize everything light up on it doesn't matter those things don't affect me no more Harvey cause you know why I have my eyes on the prize amen amen let me manifest the Holy Spirit ayman and i want to be a part of the seed of that kingdom amen that brother auger was preaching about let's stand to our feet everybody Amen as we welcome the man of God a real man of God who has really been a real blessing and as I said it's not many people that I really have confidence not men I don't say that there's that many good friends of mine and I do have confidence and but there's a unique confidence and brother Theo of it because I see the hand of the Lord upon him and not only that I see where the Holy Spirit is trying to get his people amen he spoke about a vision last night a man we know the vision without a vision people perish number line we have to have a vision and not only that and then there's got to be a road map how to get to the vision see and eventually we'll be living in division you see so therefore I believe very shortly amen that God by His grace amen will help us enter into that place well we can dash into the Holy Spirit amen into that presence of God amen and every promise everything that we desire we can go in and possess that and remember it's Ephesians when they crossed over the Jordan brother branham said that the miracles and things could not be made it was couldn't be done in the wilderness Israel didn't possess anything in the wilderness couldn't be done in Egypt but as soon as Joshua crossed over who did he meet a man he met the angel of the Lord a man he could do those things things that he could never do in the wilderness son stands a man he didn't have that premeditated in his mind he had a knee and then the enemy was running and he knew that if the enemy would run away he had a chance to regroup and he had a knee and he just spoke at Sun stand still hey man and that's where amen you'll see the miracles take place is in Ephesians which is the message of the hour amen do you love him Amazing Grace how sweet the sound will get the preacher on to the pulpit take your time he asked me how long do I preach typically on a Sunday

that chest and this morning I'm gonna speak in it and the title is the tilde well strange typer the to it well the subject disputed rights they come an inspiration crossing Jordan by the spirit of forgiveness into the land of Ephesians oh praise the name of the Lord crossing Jordan by the spirit of forgiveness in the land of Ephesians and and Paul prayed the prayer in Ephesians for this cause I bow my knees in to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ from the whole family in heaven and his name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might in his spirit in the inner man saying as the inner man is a autumn an but he want you to be strengthened in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by feet and that he be rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length the depth the height at the little love of Christ which passeth knowledge that he will be filled with the fullness of God filled with the fullness of God praise God and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge and all my my knowledge shall increase but we have to get into the love of Christ which passeth knowledge is not right because we could know all things we could know all mysteries but if we don't have this charity we are nothing and this is what I referred to last night dear Jesus but I'm praying from a man running from the President the Lord you said help us tonight in these few words as we wait upon thee and we pray that your grease and moosie will be with us and tender hearts move back the shocks the thorns the t-cells let the Blessed sunshine of God falling upon the word Lord and may be of such a meet until there will not be an unsaved person among us all the children will be

receive it father here we go may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord be unveiled to us that we that we will see the plainness of God so that we know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bring in the members of our body into the discipline of the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the apportion of the Lord Jesus so the purpose of the ravine of the mysteries wasn't the education wasn't the information was for us to seek this is God to see the cleanness of God to bring you into our God consciousness because remember we lost our block consciousness because we were born in sin shape mean akuti like we said there's children born into monarchy in England they are born into a certain environment they have to take the child and place the child and groom the child in that environment then the chance consciousnesses I'm royalty so when they only come on a truck chariots the chariot on day I don't know what I call the carriage and so on and people we even they expect that if nobody waved the horn will miss my royalty can always this is a princess and a princess that nobody really know even anybody want to weave and flat so that is what is supposed to do because that's royalty but you are royalty that is what you come here to get into a consciousness and awareness and that's a restless night the Bible said you

journey we went good pitch 30 not the 30 just as something more Peter sorry all right there are three stages of the journey and there are treaty that is Jenny but we are justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus and so that Israel in the wilderness Joonas no place of rest traveling night and day fallen a pillar of fire but finally they come to the promised land with this settle down Israel had not received their promise but they were on their journey so what can't give inheritance on your journey the journey is like a wilderness walk talk and life you could only get your inheritance in the land that is why jewelry we could tell them when your point in the land take my bones with you don't leave it here put it in that land oh praise God amen hallelujah you love it praise God Saban says but the believers and the killin was just outfit that was going on to the promise they move over into the land and took the land as a possession let's not go on to the back to the Holy Spirit let's not stop it even Lord Jesus being baptized but we wanted up [Music] world believed in our Lord Jesus yet if we have to go that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was stood with Pentecost hold a groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom then God has set in the church apostles and prophets and son like that oh praise the name of the Lord glory dog or demon God is trying to please his church and position to manifest himself manifest himself so all these sermons and teaching like you know people like to talk about teachers and teachers and their preachers you know the speechless sinner and an evangelist to talk to his sinner and teachers does positionally please the believer and I ask myself what are the believers being pleased for you have to be pleased for power so it comes right back to the spirit it's not just teaching to be taught and preached and evangelism this endtime is not irregular evangelism he save angel' itll is shipping stones so evangelists endtime evangelism is not regular evangelism endtime evangelism is cotton and shipping you to fit into God's program that is what that is about so God is trying to place his church a position to manifest himself getting one you can work through like this and say dance my spirit flowing freely adopt him please and manifest and take him out there and visit him with an angel tell him [Music] after second Peter won four to seven isn't that right and the other church the other crop going to be second Timothy 3:1 tonight all glory to go having a form

God we can't help but worship we can't help but shout give the word I have no praise what can we say this morning we appreciate the service and now we have some technical challenges but the devil is a liar at that word that was spoken can never return for it that would now listen when Jesus was here there was a Centurion that came to Jesus you know the story he said my servant is sick but I recognize that when I say to one go he goes and if you see the wood you just need to speak the word you don't even need to come to my room now where the servant was located he couldn't physically hear what was spoken but because the word was spoken 1 the word leaves the Mount of God it must produce the purpose for which it was intended so even though we lost the connection from time to time the word that was spoken is still on target every single time every one of prophecy we were not here when the Prophet was here but every one he spoke is till dead on target that's why we could say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished hallelujah - why I'm not worried about your children I'm not worried about your loved one because this word cannot return for it it must accomplish the purpose that court intended hallelujah even before we close out we do have some notes of praises and a prayer requests know the praise
