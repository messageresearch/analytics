Bible is Josh chapter 1 John chapter 3 and Jude chapter 1. so we have three jeans this morning Joshua Jewel and we have Jesus okay Joshua chapter one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he came the pastor Joshua to speak unto the Lord speaking the Joshua Moses Minister sin most of my servant is dead now therefore arise go for this Jordan doll all his people unto the land which I do give to them into the tune of Israel every place at the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I be given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and to this Lebanon EMA to the Great River the river of Euphrates all the land of the hittances unto the great sea towards the going on of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before the holidays of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not feel enough for sake they be strong watch these words now be strong have a good courage foreign which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong it is again and be and be very courageous very encourages the town May subserve to do according to all the law which the Moses my servant commanded thee so the blessings is in obedience observed to do that's where your blessing lies okay turn not from it to the right hand or the left the domains Prosper whatsoever though go as this book of the law shall not depart out of

success be strong have a good courage Be not Afraid neither without this need for the Lord thy God is with thee with the servant thou goes then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people command them that's an order command the people not a suggestion it's a command command the People Sing prepare your Victors for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan to go into possess the land which the Lord your God give it to possess it and to the reubenites and to the garage and to have trouble Man and say speak Joshua saying remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you saying the Lord your God had given you rest and had given you this land your wines your little ones your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan but you shall pass before your brethren armed all the Mighty Men of Valor and helped them until the Lord had given your brethrenal rest as he had given you and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them then he shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which Moses the Lord's servant give you on this side of Jordan towards the Sun rising Joel chapter 3 next scripture reading from verse 9. Proclaim he this among the Gentiles prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let all the men of War draw near let them come up beat your plushies into swords you're pruning hooks into Spears let the weak say I am strong assemble yourselves and come I stop right there and last scripture Jude 1 3 familiar scripture beloved when I give unto diligence write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for defeat which was once delivered under the Saints let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for people got it here we thank for the atmosphere that we feel and Lord we could never overemphasize that we come too far on the road to have debt Services Drive Services no anointing services on just spew not out of the humanistic realm but we pray that the holy spirit will drop down here with divine revelation and speak Liberty to your people in Jesus you may ask it amen amen God bless you may be seated or praise but pray from your heart oh get some pain here but God is good it's good to be here in the house of God so I have a title Warriors of defeat that's the title here so if you think I was getting a Christmas message no Warriors of the faith this is my word to you coming here Warriors of the feet and I have an inspiration to wake up the Mighty Men praise God all the men who are asleep wake them up before we go into war we go into a fight you tell them get the amen them that you are strong and have failure Valor and courage get their men to cross over to fight in the land you can't send weak men to fight the castle box is meant to fight you have the cafe men who not experience the fight it's not right they want Warriors of the feet prepare Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles prepare War wake up the Mighty Men that's where they got the inspiration home wake up the Mighty Men I want to thank God for last Sunday service praise the name of the Lord what a powerful message to my souls to my spirit I'm brother Anthony on Wednesday night the spirit of forgiveness and I could see why God gave him that Wednesday night and Anthony stood it like a soldier he sang he preached he closed off and everything else praise God that's what we do praise God we don't back down because we don't have this and don't have that if there's no musicians we will sing praise God if we have no song either we will sing We will sing without music we will sing with music we will sing we're not praise God if there's nobody in the church we will still preach okay the Lord has shout in the house we will preach somebody out there to here we are coming to waste time we come here because there's something about the Break Forth praise God hallelujah praise God praise God in other words Shake Yourself let the men of War join here all in one battle all who want to fight all the winner recognize their Christian Soldiers come to fight every day is a fight everything is a battle the devil hung the hell is after you you have to fight back if you don't fight back then will clever you and I will pack you out but God have put us in his last day they get tackled by no devil they call us to fight right back Peter plushes into swords you're gardening a farm in a long time time for war get some shots Oh Glory to God get some ammunition glory to God that pulls a warfare that's what you come to church for Glory to God could somebody say Amen hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Lord Jesus time things are going to race woods and time men killing himself getting Pulpit long long hours seen talking along and saying nothing praise God hallelujah praise God I got into that praise God so we can see what brother Anthony what the Holy Spirit trying to speak on Wednesday night because you cannot contend for the faith without a revelation of Brotherly kindness unforgiveness praise God because right and Jude is set on a sum of compassion making a difference between group peace and them that are staying by the flesh so you cannot even begin to contend until you have the spirit of forgiveness because the spirit of giveness authorize you to to fight this battle because as the blood for the age Oh Glory to God so if the church is ahead that blessed is then we had started yet the grumbling under the anointing of the nominational spirit the spirit of forgiveness bear to you into the bright age okay the Lord I shout you see everybody kindnesses on top of Brotherly kindness is Holy Spirit replaced or get the Lord and Shout glory to God so that message on Wednesday night had to come before this one here oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God God look at the Warriors of faith not Warriors you're worried about this and you're worrying about that and you're worrying about that and if they go there just know and the warrior go what not Warriors Warriors don't worry about nothing pray and go take on nobody monkey now a lot of people only take on people monkey or people business they're jumping in your back and you're riding one monkey somebody coming something like two monkeys on your back and then somebody comes with something you have three monkeys and afterwards you that monkey you're a monkey woman you're a monkey man taking me stop that take on nobody monkey you have enough problems on your own praise God hallelujah praise God let's get the burden that God gave us and you're gonna see what that burden is glory to God hallelujah praise God assemble yourselves and come so you cannot contend for the Fate without a revelation of Brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness thank you brother Anthony that was inspiring praise God that was solid word like to see them young men take their shot I like how they preaching under the preaching Jesus I love that preach Jesus look on preach our ideas and thought your dream last night and you're feeling something like that go bring your feelings out of here throw that out and preach the word of God praise God here's why the spirit of forgiveness God put that in June you know what Judas before the Book of Revelation so before Revelation the word open up to you you have to come to Jude to contend for the fate and have some of compassion okay the Lord I shall look at me starting here you know because this is the message of Yahweh brother George praise God this is the message of your Oh Glory to God hallelujah and I see people fight up in the humanistic realm praise God and it's just three Realms humanistic Define revelation and vision and to get into the realm of the divine revelation you have to get in the spirit all them people watching football this morning they may just watch it easy here goal there's Google they are the energy receipt they're watching who are you know who playing pool

warrior is you start to look up and check what a warrior is awaria is someone who is courageous and strong and fights for a Cause or goal not your personal grievances ain't no worry I think historically a warrior is someone who has extensive skill in Wolfie and combat foreign boots you know cleaning the weapon and stuff a warrior have to have experience so that's why when David stepped forward he said when I will see him about my sheep I'll beg him a lion king and an unconquered live with the lion and a deal with that Lion and the call that delivered me from that Lion and the god of the woman told me that from that bill he is one unable to deliver this Goliath into my hands because he had experience you see to have genuine Faith you have to have genuine experience okay the Lord has shout I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you he'd come back here in the wood but you've got to get experience shout out experience I know them intellectual ministers don't like it but we shout to not experience we want to meet that Pillar of Fire we want to meet a praise God the same God that Moses met on that mountain you want to meet that same God change your life historically the warrior is someone who has extensive skin and Wolfie and come back often a soldier for a shoulder-like figure in modern terms the terms has come to refer to anyone who exhibits strengths and courage in a variety of situations not one situation a community service like discourage then everybody who Services more happily courage that is not Correctional this is where you get you get armed when you go on the job when you're going Family Life husband wife children when you get the challenges then that barrier anoint him that is how you end up dealing with confrontation and conflict you can't be no soul you're afraid of conflict I want to conflict with nobody your cushioning another Christian I stand for something you know I won't tell my son you get right up write them up knowing because [Applause] later on deal with it amen [Applause] I said preaching again yes see him yet but becoming big and bold too send me a man to fight me you could pray how much you want for gulate heart attack he ain't dying so brains no you have to front your issue issue your challenges your situations you have to confront it and you cannot defeat what you're not prepared to confront okay the Lord has shown I hope you're hearing me how you hearing me Church are you hearing what I'm preaching this morning you cannot defeat what cannot be better confront a lot of us con adopt confrontation but sometimes we have to do it and whatever we're going forward on the closing this year but razak said there are certain things we have to leave back look at things in the past leave that back pressing towards the mark let's get there oh yes dying we have to fight isn't that right Warriors there we go are determined confident Fearless encourages you heard what God tells Joshua be strong he never crossed Jordan before be very courageous because strength is not enough courage is putting your strength on the line you see what she's on Mother's day yesterday she is very courageous just about a year plus ago she was there she was crying because husband passed away not in a testimony she never talked about her husband she's laughing praise him because she's talking about how coven almost killed her and how God brought the truth she never said a word concerning her husband going on because she's telling the doctors who say how long you'll be here she has some jealousy about so when I'm doing leave here doctor says she don't know he's there but I know you're not better I know you know because she's seen people dying here and people dying and people dying here and she probably want to know the devil said but you were the next and she knows she's that next and you are a taller level you are not next go give the Lord some Praises come on come on you have to get great courage a man was 90 and 9 you know oh Gloria don't let the cut off he accepted something and he did something you could go 1992. what's wrong with that God make her God make more God made liver God make kidney he can replace he can repair he can heal he can deliver God made eyes God made his come on now God made knees foreign [Applause] [Music] like Sarah she told did what Abraham said Hallelujah but God said it he can't take it back he said by Sarah he will have that son she owes she passed child but if God said it there's no devils in hell to stop it from happening in your life if God said you could get that personal Revival today then of course they wake up the Mighty Men we're going to wake up we're gonna destroy up we got the Shaker or glory of God wake up that woman wake up them man hallelujah praise God Warriors are determined confident Fearless courageous they fight persistently in the face of adversity and never give up Oh Glory to God and what never give up Oh Glory to God that's why job said oh he slay me yet I'll trust

the ground they will eat you up mess you up Lick It Up tap you up but God said he gonna pull you up from there and no devil could stop you know Ain't No Stopping Us Now Okay the Lord I shout turn your wife against you turn your husband against you then you're chilling against you don't judge people against you that will stop in you if the Lord I shout my God what a powerful testimonies is appalling him yesterday Paul for Testimony they caught a pay cut her salary like only Christmas before she was out of money to buy groceries and she didn't know somebody in her job was watching her and on the job she's singing she praising God when she go in the bathroom she's singing she playing tape and somebody washing her and the woman come up to her when she had a need she said spoiling she said you know if I tell you the Lord they lay upon my heart to give you something you believe it she said yes I believe that she's I've been watching you and God lay upon her heart she got two thousand dollars or what she needs to buy she groceries because somebody watching her prison blessing and she Under Pressure she under Financial pressure but she ain't complaining coming to town please I'm trying to pump this no she praising blessing God I miss a child circumstance okay the Lord something God must honor that God is make a way for that only the God will tell me there's no power and praise there is power and praise there is power and given God glory oldest power hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus you fought your way to be here let's fight or no for the glory and Kingdom of God thank everybody moving for making it out his wife here for me Arrow praise God praise God hallelujah Glory Warriors confident Fearless courageous they fight persistently in the face of adversity never give up Warriors also possess to possess a strong sense of loyalty and Justice and strive to protect those who cannot protect themselves they have a way that's looking up for the brother looking out for his sister you know God love you and you love his children more than him [Music] when you have loved one for another you know how God loves to see we love one another see you love your brother God love to see that you know you think it doesn't like to see that writing bitterness has come and Watchers come and grudges come and people renewing their odd vowel like it really likes every year every year they renewing it they want to fight they want to another fight any devil alone they're upset they upset no it's already breath really they're mad vets the investment they want sin they advance for their own failures no they put somebody upset them you know why they want somebody to blame they want to get it off of them they want to see themselves in the mirror so they say she he them the pastor and like how we say it and this and that and all kind of foolish excuses when you get rid of that God listen God every Moses dying he said Joshua no more than my servant is dead no death Joshua come and take them people over poor Joshua Joshua is that the terminal so when just to recognize the weight of responsibility that's gonna hit him he shall be shown foreign [Music] my servant Moses is dead now you take them people over I can see Joshua foreign they don't like when things break around them and God are we are cracking things around your Zone that you could step forward we are not ordinary people so when Joshua stepped forward so he said be strong a good courage no money sitting there to back him up no man shall be able to stand before the all the days of thy life as I wasn't a legend or is Joshua talking to you know as I will make Moses so I'll be with you oh I will not fail thee praise God every place you put your foot is yours so get moving brother or give the Lord a shout you are a warrior o glory to God you are a fighter God don't stand still and church after the service don't you stand still get to do something get to pray and get the past and get the seeking get the beatle get the witness and testify to somebody invite them to church invited the service do something about your life what don't Joshua then when those are the problem should be strong be courageous but isn't that she will be fine writing now this word here this word here don't go with your own humanistic Spirit don't forget you you're anointed no no no don't go with that put it here I want you to meditate on it day and night because I could come down in the channel of my word right down into your heart but if you're not on the woodwork I'll reveal to you that the sky is blue you do nearby for that you could look up and see that you're not even really blue anyhow so what Warriors possess a strong sense of loyalty Justice and try to protect those who cannot protect themselves and ask something to hear the trillion of a warrior is a process of optimizing physical mental and spiritual discipline I think a Japanese have what you call um forget the name Samurai Japanese how we call it Samurai they go to training damage is one man sword Army thing when you lose one Samurai you take another Village like that them fellas and I'm treating a certain way you just up and say I have to be a warrior this morning you know and you go that one hour and doing so you get killed your goose Coke up right they can't send you so that is why you come to get trained to follow instructions to take commands and some people don't want commands because they're getting their own revelation some people only say Amen because they come from the dream that last night and what God showed them they missed the program of God why God put somebody by the pulpit to bring truth because true they were going to free you so what so the process of optimizing physical mental spiritual discipline in order to achieve Peak Performance they can include physical training martial arts mental exercises and so on visualization the warrior mindset also stresses Inner Strength Focus self Mastery and courage that's how we pop up the self-mastery and what the Bible talk about Paul said he that have to go into the fight and battle must be a master over himself must be disciplined that is not discipline formed by legalism of the church that is self-discipline that is internal discipline and that is what you have to have with him so God kind of sent a Revival until he's got man and to take it we cannot have a Revival until we get God called men not man called man but God trained man here we go that's not trained up in the School of Theology and education but rugged men of Faith Rocket Man of Faith watch this that God has brought up in the school of his rocket training men who are not afraid to face the fire human you face the fire your friendly fire fire

the word it is written you can't tell him it is written if you don't know what is written okay the Lord has shouted you got to meditate on the word day and night that you could know what is in that world you fight the Devil with the word you feed the Devil with the word you overcome the Devil by the word you can Victory by the word say it is the victory that overcomes the world foreign men who has come into the presence of God and knows his power and knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power some men are trained to know the Living God it's it's all right to treat them by the word but the letter kill it but the spirit give it life and before we can have this revival God has to call out and train men god-trained men to carry this message and they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go in the fairy fullness in defeat or to the Lions then or wherever it may be they are ready to go because they have been in the presence of God and know that he is whether it is the victory or defeat they stand the same the kind of training God does star man oh God Joe wasn't afraid of of his test on trial he said I know my redeemer limited I know the last I shall see you

blood God leads people two great trials to purge them fires The Purge who them who God's people oh glory to God and sometimes it take years to do it that's for me myself tonight I believe right now God is training such men to meet the front line and have backline period potatoes to that front line facing the enemy okay the Lord has shout the Warriors of the faith will be called to the front line God church is calling you to the front line how many want to say Amen to that [Applause] you know Moses went through that that's already and what friends tell you you know I can't talk because it will make a business I can I can't I can't I can't I'm gonna finish what they can because I still call you I still choose you didn't choose Helena I want to show you are not in my Christian by your desire it's a big one you are Christian by God's desire that's a big one you know I don't think you'll get that yet it's not your desire you know it's God's desire [Applause] to God and can't he's all that the father had given me will come Pat past tense you have to be in God's thinking to receive the call of God upon your life oh give the Lord a shout that's why the woman of the well Jill had no issue the fact that she passes you on Hell or Mad Men she was with I know she was living the fact was she had something inside of her that she did not know until he came and lose it and show her your name is on that book he lost and live like a hug you don't have to live like a dog oh give the Lord a shout you can live higher than that you make man Lord and the angels not above the animals okay the Lord's home Praises Give the Lord I shout in the house you can live higher than that you can press more than that [Applause] say God is training man to meet the front line men who are going through time ship under their feet sometimes look at the whole thing is falling but yet in the midst of it all they know that Living God and keep their face forward oh my hallelujah praise God when people was called he said no watch them we need something we need what we need tonight is somebody else who knows what where they are at what we need tonight is men and women know their position in Jesus Christ he said when the devil make that big boss he said we still got goliance but we still have David's too he made a big post it fell on the ears of the wrong fellow a little old fellow walking around here he'd look up the Seas a man like that but he knew that he was elected by God so watch you can see from two sides not just David commandering you know but David had a Consciousness and awareness he was elected by God do you have that Consciousness are you aware listen before David David Goliath he knew God was with him [Music] and I saw you can remember even before you came to the Lord how God has been with you can over your life you know when your child Angels was working with you do you know you have an angel working with you to bring you into salvation to bring you into the way go protect from accidents from disaster from all kind of conditions God protected you that this message could get to you [Applause] that's why it's difficult to understand how people communication is dead it's difficult to understand how people come to church without the praise upon the heart but other praise upon their lips it's difficult to understand that [Applause] David was called by election he was elected called anointed and pleased elected by God called from sheephooden to be king anointed and possession in place and how God anoint David when he gets fed up with Saul and he tells Samuel he said forget Soul you know why I'm only for him so I finish with him pink slip let him go home he's fired still on his shoulder fired he said go on anoint one is under Jesse and when all them passed by he said but isn't there one more is he sent for David I ain't sitting down light come small guy yeah he just come and when he come the whole this is the one and amidst his brothers which were older than him supposed to have it that's my right you know is who he elected school years ordained take the honor oil and pour it on David right there anointed king now David can't be foolish and say Ice King no it will be thrown you have to understand the principles of things work yeah the anointing doesn't put you in the position immediately the anointed put the calling and the placement of where you're going to be so it is a destiny in the anointing that God put upon you Oh Glory to God but from where you are the way out the Gap is fire is tiles his Battle Is War I never studied the book of David you'd recognize praise this book of Samuel and so on you reckon how David fought his way to get to that throne even though he was anointed king David see Rel helion or relatan you know and he had some Mighty Warriors around him Mighty gentle Warriors who glory to God Men of War and that's what we want to call out this day wake up the Mighty Men oh Hallelujah Gideon say me give me yes though Mighty Man of Valor you have courage more than you think you have faith more than you think you have ability more than you think the devil's a liar don't let the devil tell you this until you're negative God said you are Mighty God said wake up oh glory to God there's a Revival coming to wake up the bright that Jesus Christ he said the bride had no Revival yet it will take them seven Thunders to wake up that Pride if the Lord I shout in the house in that bright as a mighty men as a mighty warrior as a mighty evangelists and pastors and teachers and Prophets who grow an apostle Give the Lord a shout Mighty faithful Ministry not press play okay the Lord I shout there's a mighty faithful Ministry and there come the Press Play they come to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ according to the commission that Jesus gave go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature whole glory to God hallelujah glory to God Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Abraham election Isaac Justice Jacob Grace Julie Perfection nothing against Joseph first thing you were elected you was elected then when God electedly called you then he called you and you heated to the call then he poured the anointing of oil upon you the Holy Ghost and he poured the oil upon him it went all over him a whole oil full of it not sparingly he didn't Sprint it upon David or the oil was he was yeah all the oil went right on down he's not right and when the anointing struck him he was positionally placed as king he couldn't pick up his role yet Jesus already paid for us you know they come like you go by courts I go by one of them big uh furniture store and you pay them on on your furniture I need to come home yet you have the receipt you have the evidence of purchase and they have to deliver to your house Jesus already paid for us but they're coming to pick us up that's what the Raptor is about when he died at Calvary pay the price for your Redemption you pay a price for your deliverance so since you was in the devil's shop say she was in the devil's Kingdom he paid for you and one day the gospel come walking to you and pick you up and that's how you get baptized in Jesus name that's all you find yourself in church because our price was paid okay the Lord I shout hallelujah eyes I'm coming back if I go to prepare a place I will come again and I will get you oh he coming to get us there's

killing time in church glory to God some who went to sleep but we who are alive and remain shall not hinderella okay the Lord I shall we all of them who are alive and remain Hallelujah hear this one Abraham election Isaac justification praise God Jacob Grace he said and Joseph Perfection placed that's a big one so you mean placing is under truth Perfection yes because God is perfect and your father when you walk through Perfection so God was trying all the time to get the church into this position of being Joseph she said yeah you are you know where he was standing he was a man of Faith to murder David he believed God God was in him he knew he was anointed and you know the same thing you Christians if you if God hadn't elected you to be a Christian you would not be a Christian it is God's choice not yours because no man seeks God no man sees God at any time you haven't sought God but God sought you and you responded to his calling upon your life [Applause] so [Applause] you are one in a million Millions were lost when you were saved hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God hallelujah Glory so Joshua he was a lead he was in the wilderness isn't that right and Joshua was elected of God and when he crossed and Moses died then he was called of God God called him out and give him a vision now as I was with Moses I'll be with you no man shall be this time before the orders of your life be not dismayed need to be discouraged why does he have to say that why is that automatic well God tell me I'll take the lion no he's a human you have his own fears yeah you have his own challenges just like us this morning humans you have your doubts they have a question you have your fears and God is dealing with that with Joshua amen with words because the Devil comes with his thoughts you know he began torch to your mind to bring fears and doubts to question God promised to your life amen amen and especially when you know you feel and when you fail and you sin and whatever it is you play with it anymore you say God wouldn't bless you because you did this go and bless me because you did this you lie here you do this here whatever whatever that's his job he had to do that but Jesus stated all not some all all when he paid the price he paid the price he paid the full price because we couldn't get out if we tried so God himself took up expert make a mad body there for God Jesus and that was the body of the pillar of fire so the same Pillar of Fire that was even children of Israel get Flesh on it and the person of Jesus Christ and him was that book and him was our names so when he walked the Earth he had the full book was dear that's why you can say Peter come John come Philip come they had to come because the name was in him Oh Glory that God had to respond to the cause he said leave your Fisher fishing and I'll make you Fishers of Men Oh Glory to God and when God call you you've got to respond if you have something in you to respond if you don't have it you can't respond but if there's something in you you've got to respond oh that the father had past tense given me Will Come Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so he had to tell Joshua don't be discouraged told me this maid I won't break you where does whoever you go is see if you're not feeling then he's still there if you're not seeing him he's still there I know I love about God but I was trying to do it in my own life and just do try to do the hard thing for his hardest things first the rest becomes different and mentally we tend to try to do the easiest thing ah that's a big job but you see when you look up the big job all the other job just fall in line what's the first task that God gave Joshua Jericho all the hardest place to conquer were also high chairs riding on the wall that shops on the wall I've been that big cage closing and how you're taking that that was an offense teaching as a wall City you know and God said Jericho I'd give them into your hands I give the king all them people said the only Warriors I give them away to your hands oh Hallelujah let's continue here now and after the vision was over what happened Joshua shakuni showed a knight shot from his sword are you forced against us a man moving there he said no no I'm the captain in other words I am your boss I come to give you instructions how to take Jericho oh my the captain I like Joshua you know he wasn't playing games you know he wouldn't say you know I mean um yeah yeah yeah it was some juice your coffee you don't lose the enemy you know coffee draw sword first and if it's not all right then they put on your sword if you if you want to do entertainment industry Hallelujah Hallelujah no short first why you need land there's enemy in the land anybody want to kill you and keep you out of your land take away your joy take away your peace are you with me so then Joshua being the warrior elective children of God when he met this man standing near the wall of Jericho he was positionally pleased then when I talk about faithful Ministry being pleased and is the Minister of Jesus Christ I'm talking about the encounter with Michael the encounter with the angel the uncomfortable the Unseen captain man have to get an encounter not with a church overseas or some headquarters are encounter with the captain of the horse so when he get that encounter he become a warrior you get anointed to fight anointed to give instructions so that he could tell the people listen when I visit the show showed um shut your mouth you can't shout until they get to shout he said when I visit the show Daniel will shout follow instructions walk around Jericho once a day somebody feel to walk again trouble you have to follow instructions once a day the seven day seven times I want to build it and Shout to help I mean we wanna we know what happened when they shouted the walls come down all we have to do is obey God walls you think are walls God will bring them down if you come into obedience obedience is where the blessing lies and in this service God will speak to you and tell you what you need to do oh praise God Amen praise God one day while strolling around the Wilderness along Jordan of Jericho he said a man he said a man stood on his Jewish Soul just a man look like a man doesn't say but he said no watch he said I'm the captain of the host of The Lord of Israel the captain of the host who was this captain of the host Joshua reached down on loosen his shoes fell in his face before him and say what will the Lord have me to do so when Joshua recognized who it was he said what will the Lord have me to do he said God called man needs what God can what God called man needs is a holy spirit behind him to back him up you stand alone today we won't do it we stand as an organization we stand as a move we stand this that the other but God wants men to be individuals that is why God hate control by headquarters over churches bishop and this one over this one because when they have all these men lined up over it cuts off the Holy Ghost but what God wants is that whatever man it is five people in the church that man can hear from God not here from foreign hear from God that's why I have the sovereignty of the local church Oh Glory the God today no man in between there is the operation of the holy spirit all right let's continue he said we can have Gatherings across the country we can have great stadiums full of people we can have all that kind of things going on it will never help until God speaks individually to the human heart the only thing that could change man God have to speak to you may God speak to you today Daniel 11 32 said and such as the wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by factories but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits who the people that know their God shall be strong and the Bible said let the weak say I am strong did we read that oh my Hallelujah beat your plow shares into swords you're pulling hooks into Spears let the weak say I am strong when you say I am strong with your mouth God will send the strength to make you stronger Oh Glory to God let not weak say I am weak no let the weak say directly opposite I am strong and God drops strength behind you to back up your confession oh of strength isn't that right oh my Hallelujah glory to God So Daniel said the greeting in the last days when these things come to pass the great exploits will be the people then what the men of faith will do in that day when Daniel saw a vision of that he said though that they do wicked and shall do wicked in the last days and that they know they don't do but they that know their God shall do exploit the last day speaking of this time no

Hallelujah could you take some more are you enjoying the wood this morning if Russia accepted the Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia they would not have been Communists today 75 years ago they had a great retirement in Russia God come among them they had revivals away in this Iberia what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone the churches can have church only under permission they are doomed in the Judgment has gone off in this wild tangent of Communism solo to the devil so what happened the Holy Ghost fell in Russia they

bride will have to stop preaching for the Beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach is granted so there's a prophecy one day church will close down we can't we wouldn't be able to preach this gospel freely because a system will demand that we form join his Union and whatever it is right and they'll be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot now remember here we go Moses was born for a certain work and he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work he had to go out in the desert and wait there until God's appointed time so in a certain sense it might appear when Moses ran out but in another sense it wasn't time so Moses got a 40-year break for it to make up the time which is God's appointed time so you may find God taking too long but there is an appointed time Hallelujah are you with me there has to be a certain fear on the throne and the people had to be crying for the bread of life before God could send him back this is true for our tea Moses I cry just no people had must be burdened enough to cry to God for deliverance and then you say I paid the cries of my people these message people they're too comfortable yeah they're too normal they're too ordinary some of them sung asleep and we're taking sleeping tablets the song I sleep goes to wake them up pick them up because something fits in the happier hallelujah what what do we have in our day I'll skip that [Applause] okay molecules are working Sciences until we have a generation of

not be deceived how can you tell the spirit apart question answer just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are the evil one but the Lord show me and the Lord you know I'm seeing it so on no no what did the Bible say yeah see what as the evil one deceived the first two Brides he will try to receive the bride in his last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself to Creeds or just plainly children from the world to any sign of Sutra God here we go never play Signs ahead of the word signs follow the word he told Elijah told one big me a cake first isn't that right now this last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is the end time now as all we know for Israel is in our homeland anytime now you will come according to Malachi and whenever you see him he'll be dedicated to the word he'll be Vindicated version 10 7 go with vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as Elijah did for the Mount Zion many will misunderstand him not few many because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they considered to when they come against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God Truth by deceivers but this Prophet will come as a foreigner to the first coming cry Behold the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world Behold the Lamb of God come into Glory he will do this for even John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is this one the last Messenger to the elect and the word bride the elect and what the word born brand version 2 13 I know that works and where thou dwellers even where Satan sitters the whole is fast my name has not denied my faith even those days where in Antipas my faithful matter who was seen among you were Satan developed amen amen listen to this breakdown now yeah this is what I get to I Know Thy works these are the identical words uttered to each of the seven Messengers relative to the people of God in each age as they are spoken to the two Vines true and Falls they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group and they ought to strike Terror in the hearts of the others for though we are saved by grace apart from Works true salvation will bring forth works or deeds that will please God First John 3 7 little children let the man deceive you either do it Wicked righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is foreign that's a big one what a man does he is James 311 at the same place Sweet Water and bitter Romans 6 2 how shall we that our dead doesn't live any longer therein matut Pearl says 33-35 either make the tree good and his food good always make the tree corrupt and his food corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit he said what generation of Fighters how can you be an evil speak of things for out of the abundance of the heart the most speaks a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringing forth good things either man or an evil treasure being for evil things now if a man is born of the word being born again none of corruptible seed but of incorrupted by the word he will produce the word the fruit or works of his life will be the product of the kind of sea that is in him his Works therefore will be scriptural I Know Thy works the word of Truth was the Criterion then it is the criteria no there isn't another standard there isn't another Plum line I Know Thy Works he stood there with the word examining their lives in the light of the blueprint he has laid out for them he must have been pleased in the goodly measure for a day like others who have gone on before were enduring let me let's go the persecution of the unjust and still joyfully cleaving unto the Lord difficult though it was a time to save the Lord yet they serve him and worship him in spirit and in truth but the force Vine it was not so they repudiated the life that is built upon the word and we're now going further and further away from the truth the action for witness to the depths in which they are sunk now here we go Acts 3 16. when Peter was asked remember Peter said man walk right when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle are taking place upon the one of the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his Jesus name true faith in his Jesus name had made this man form a crypto strong the faith which is by from him Jesus had given him the man this perfect songness in the presence of Your World there it is Jesus name Jesus fate brought the miracle Peter here we go there's a bum Peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed it was his own name he said it was Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus perform that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 2 13 it was his feet it must not fit in him it was his own fate that he had given to the Believers [Applause] you see it it's not your faith is his fate that he gave to you oh glory to God his faith is going to be in you Hallelujah Romans 12 3 according as God had dealt to every man according to the verse the men The Measure of Faith Ephesians 2 8 by grace are ye saved through faith and that faith is not ourselves it is the gift of God James 2 1 notice my brethren have not the Fate the fate of not in our lord Jesus but respect our persons says the fate of Jesus isn't right in the programian age where man was humanizing salvation haven't turned from the truth that salvation is of the Lord having classified adoption of election and opened the church wide door to their Fellowship to any and all who subscribe to their tenants never mind the word in this age of Rapid degration there were still the few who had the measure of that feet of our Lord Jesus Christ and not only use that faith and acts of power but which to those who dare to say that they will save simply on the grounds of joining the church so you were saying it was more than just an active Faith doing something one doesn't know but with stone what what we're standing them liars and deceivers and satanic workers was in the church these guys are Stitch members they knew that no man could truly believe until eternal life and righteousness of God apart from The Measure of Faith of the Lord Jesus Christ himself today church at his bomb is filled with mental believers that's not my word that this church is filled with mental believers who endorse the Virgin put the shed blood going to church taking communion and are not reborn at all so in that church it was the same problem human faith wasn't enough then it is not enough no it takes the very fate of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made to his hands Oh Glory the godson the human said care work then a coworked now oh praise God praise God this was a living faith I live by the faith of the Son of God that's what Paul said isn't that right Paul did not say he lived by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God that was given him life and kept him living in Christian Victory Oh Glory to God give the Lord some praises foreign [Applause] and they were blessed by the Lord this is the part I want to get to I was accounted worthy for him we're Satan sitters are you ready the reason that this part of the eulogy of the spirit is because these brave soldiers are you ready these brave Soldiers of the Cross will overcome in Satan right in the midst of his own throne room they were winning the battles through the name and fate of Jesus Christ in the camp of the leaders of Darkness what a tremendous like the Mighty Men of David who invaded the camp of the enemy to bring David to his quenching water so these Giants are fate and Faded the Realms of Satan Earthly stronghold and by preaching an exhorting brought the water of Salvation to those who live under the shadow of death Oh Glory to God who is that Warriors of defeat and stronghold step on him oh glory to God heal he's not guarding you you are budding him you're taking the water the enemy or give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah as much as these words considering the throne and Realm Of Satan are part of God's praise for his elect they actually set the stage of the announcement of the evil that was against Supremacy in the church almost coming true you know but the brand I'm in a measurable contest he said let's raise our hands let us pray in our own way as we make our confession you
