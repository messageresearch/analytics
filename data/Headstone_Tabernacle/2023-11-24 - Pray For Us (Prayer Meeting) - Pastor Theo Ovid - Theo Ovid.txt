opportunity to come together in this virtual room to call upon your name father God May what be said May inspire people and open up to them a Channel of prayer here answer them Lord may they see the elected will cry out granted father bless this s prayer session tonight in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome to each and every one of you tonight and um tonight I have an thought to share with you and the title of it is pray for us and um I need your prayer Wednesday night I I I was very in lots of pain and I thought that it was a back back problems and stuff but then it was my kidneys acing up and it was the pain was just you know was terrible so much that my wife told me it's best to send up a tape that they play I said no I I have to be there so I craw into the church but by the time I got by in the Pulpit it was different and then I'm still under some uh some little difficulties but God is good so I want you to pray but that is not uh I just so happened that I sort of present a pray request tonight for me but I really want you to pray for us meaning the ministry I want to share something about that tonight so uh I want to go straight into it tonight but I have a Psalm I like to read from Psalms 34:1 and it reads th Come Ye children haen unto me I will teach you the fear of the Lord what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil thy lips from speaking Gile depart from Evil and do good seek peace pursue it here we go the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry so what that tells us the righteous will cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth verse 17 this of Psalms 34 the righteous cry and the Lord Hearth and deliver them out of all their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that have a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit I find this a powerful Psalm tonight it tells us what the righteous will do the righteous would cry and Ezekiel 9:4 says the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof so these two scriptures I give you for your consideration you can M on it I want to turn to 1 Thessalonians 5 reading from verse 12 1 Thessalonians 5 reading from verse2 it reads and we beseech you Brethren to know know them which labor among you I want to drive slow on these scriptures because in this age of where the spirit of entitlement is so prevalent that people take things for granted sometime ago I saw a son killed his father that's in the States because he didn't want to work and the father was breaking down his allowance from for 4,000 a month or 3,000 or 2,000 and he was so unhappy he killed his father and it's a a testament of this entitled generation that feel like they deserve this uh they ow this they should have this they demand this and they want this but Paul saying here I beseech you Brethren to know them which Le among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you so you have to know who is over you who is laboring among you who admonish you verse 13 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves so he's talking about respects talking about order verse 14 and we exalt you Brethren warn them that are unruly and in going forward this headstone Tabernacle this we will do warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient towards all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and all men Rejoice ever more one two pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast to that which is good the Bible exalts the church to prove all things we're not supposed to take crap on anything somebody say and claim as a fact prove all all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil not some all just the appearance and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless un the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it and verse 25 is where I get the thought from Brethren pray for us and I want you to pray sincerely for the ministry as you realize that now I'm emphasizing about this 54 Ministry about leadership about God plac and his sons and where it have to start it has to start it has to start acts 4 this is after um the beat disciples after Peter raised that CP man and so like that and they went into a prayer meeting and they gathered together because they want them to stop preaching in Jesus name and verse 29 of Acts 4 says and now Lord to the pr behold your threatment Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed now these are men that are filled with the Holy Ghost these are Apostles these are God's Warriors of the faith at that time when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost which is a refilling is acts for and they spake the word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart of one Soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common there was no selfishness among them it was a selflessness verse 33 and with great power give the Apostle witness not text not teachings not Revelations not Mysteries but with great power this is scripture give the Apostle witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all okay brother BR I'm toal Deliverance if our heart condemn us we want complete deliverance we don't want to be halfway church now he's not talking to Sinners here he's not talking to unbelievers here he's talking to church folks okay we don't want to be halfway we want to be a real church or no church at all he says this this way God will make halfway Christians but Christians can be halfway go don't make halfway preachers but preachers can be halfway so here where we go now we want to be real Christians or no Christians at all we want Total deliverance from our habits our sins from our evil thinking from our evil doing from our negligence whatever we have done we want Total Deliverance so why why so that when people come into this church to be prayed for there will be just this little group maybe not over 100 or two sitting here but they'll be completely in the hands of God and when we pray then God will hear from Heaven God wants somebody that he can hold in his hands somebody that he can say I got confidence in I can send my sick servant of brandham Tabernacle jonville and that group of people are in one Accord something will happen well look at what he does for us in the condition we're in and I say this to you when my wife told me maybe I had to send a tape I was in such pain and I told her to come it was very strenuous and painful but I knew that the Lord give me certain things to say the message about rejection the rejection of the Holy Ghost if you haven't listened to it go back and listen to it it is and that other message um gets into the person Christ Jesus two important Junction message and people don't understand and if you go over the story with Saul how in Simplicity just by simple instructions wait seven days and I'll come and I'll offer up and that what Samuel told Saul and Saul couldn't do it he went and do it himself and then do not himself he kick out the Holy Ghost and he begin to govern and Rule and many ministers they find themselves in that gear of governing ruling manipulating controlling influencing and they are in charge they are the chief they are the chief in charge God is outside somewhere but God doesn't want that so God wants us to be under the direction of the Holy Ghost and he's saying here in verse 78 in in paragraph well look what he does for us in the condition we're in what would he do if we were in one heart and one Accord the only way we can do that here we go the only way we can do that is to unify our hearts together with brly love that's the core brothery love Spirit of forgiveness brothery love putting yourself in your brother's place under the matter brothery love taking off your shoes and putting your foot in your brother's shoes before you criticized and condemn him so with BR love and then next step Next Step BR love obey the officers of the church and the pastor and the pastor obey God that's how it's supposed to flow then he get it right here now then God works through the pastor through the board down into the church and all together one unit to the kingdom of God then God will hear when we have a unified group let nothing bother you don't be dismayed of anything now what's the kind of person that God ordained to take the land Moses was complete he was a man that wouldn't compromise if there were stews and fers and so forth he wouldn't compromise that is what God wants us now Pharaoh War are agree and said Moses you can go but leave your children behind leave some of your cattle back there and then how brother types this that's the way the devil wants a Christian to come so the devil don't mind you go to church that's not a problem devil be message not a problem here's theion it'll be all right for you to join the church but don't you never forgive Jones it'll be all right if you can bring if you don't have to give up smoking drinking lying stealing F finding backbiting you don't have to give that up just join the church but Moses wasn't a compromise he wanted complete deliverance he said we will not leave a ho behind we will take everything that belongs to us and we go and Worship the Lord that's the way the church ought to be we will take righteousness we will take Holiness we will take the Holy Spirit we will take a unified group when we go to the Altar and hear this now we will leave nothing behind you know people can pray in such a way till the devil will have to give in and that's the way Moses and his group did they got over there and they got under the blood you notice until they got under the blood there was no total Deliverance Moses himself he was unified with God but Israel wasn't there was still sin and they mured against Moses they said why do you do this you bring more trouble Upon Us Moses he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there were still murmuring among them one night when God ordained that a lamb should be killed a type of Christ and the blood was dipped in his up just weed and put over the lindle of the door and on the post that is when Israel become completely delivered and that is when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking when you're gambling when you're cheating when you're stealing when you're lying when everything is brought under the blood there'll be a total Deliverance yeah we you have wronged somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't stay you can't bring it something won't let you do it here we go now when yourself is completely and totally under the blood there'll be a total Deliverance then you'll have a freedom like you have never known before when everything is brought under the blood brought in submissive to the kingdom of God then there'll be real Deliverance so friends says you have to have a heart for the kingdom the kingdom of God that's what you want to submit yourself to we're almost done God wants his people to pray when Israel got so taxed in such a condition that they could not go any further their time was fulfilled their burdens was laid further than they thought then they begin to pray and when the people begin to pray then God begin to hear it was time for God's word to be fulfilled after isn't this now after Moses had been recognized and then he switch after the people rather know that they needed a leader they begin to pray so now there are those who try to annal the F4 Ministry and say play tapes like the men is irrelevant they just watching a prophet and that's a prophet they're not even concerned about the prophet's prophecy but that's what hop on and stick with Prophet prophecy but watch this the people had to know they needed a leader to begin with and then they begin to pray then to begin to pray to God to send them a leader or someone to bring them out and he sent them a man a prophet that was his sign now you know I beat number six I beat number man but I'm I'm changing now to present to you you that there's going to be a genuine fightful that the bride body have to see the need for these men that God has that ordained to be placed positionally step forward in other words it will take God to empower them with the ministry of Jesus Christ to step forward to take the bride over let me just continue brother isn't it strange that God wants the people to have pattern to it when Jesus looked out upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe the laborers are few you pray the Lord of the Harvest that was him you pray to me that I will send laborers when I say a fold Ministry into my Harvest it is some part you have to do God is waiting for his church to call on him he always did it God is waiting today for the people to call his servant into action I know we read this many times but I trust at this time it is different because of our point of emphasis now concerning the ministry God is waiting for the people to call his servant into action and the servant can't get into action till the people pray so in other words the ministers could preach till all the black hair turn gray and all the gray hair fall off the head he's not talking about preaching talking about getting into action and the servant can't get into action until the people prays Israel could not get into action down there with signs and wonders until they fell on their face and prayed for a deliverer God had his deliverer God had a prophet hanging up in the wilderness kept him there for 4 years waiting for them to get right to pray but when they got right and start praying then God sent the deliverer God will do the same thing today if the people will just get together get to praying all right I'm closing 2 Thessalonians 3 1-3 Paul speaks finally Brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free cuse and be glorious even as it is with you and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not Fai but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil big Apostle Paul saying pray pray for us and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not Fai brother brandom as we close final quote he said I don't want Justice I don't want the Lord I want his Mercy he said oh Lord Don't Judge Me by no law I'll be condemned I can't stand I I I don't give don't give me Justice I I I ought to go to hell because I'm a sinner but Lord Give Me Your Mercy Your Love Your Grace God said this is my beloved Son here him not Moses not Justice not the law but he him he's got Mercy he's got gifts for you he has said on high he's quoting part of Ephesians 4 and give gifts to men and God did just exactly what he did with his son when he adopted him there now and otherwise don't hear me no more I'm God but I've adopted my son no man can come to the father but by my son he him oh my how God wants to take his church today and adopt it he gave it birth now he wants to adopt it but we just won't stand and still if it raises up among the methodists the Baptist will have nothing to do with it it raises up among One Church the other one have nothing to do with it it's a Twist and a twirl why a mixed multitude the same thing today and this is the last quote we have what we need today is a coming together and a prayer meeting and to stay there until God sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit brings the Holy Ghost down and places in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors that is what we need now I know many ministers now think that they are place and that is the position and all of that they on drama that is not what the prophet taught what he thought when they born and positionally born then God sets in his church yeah he is saying we need a prayer meeting to stay there until God sends the adoption of the Holy Ghost brings the Holy Ghost down and places in the church these five offices and the Bible self teaches for God sets in the church not a man voted in not a man the people fig he's the best man to talk and preach and or whatever it is not that not somebody appoint a man or say he's the man no when go God sets God sets and God promises sets he said that is what the church needs it won't compromise it will stay with the word a church that won't flirt with the world a church that will have nothing to do with sin that will turn its back on sin that will walk in Holiness and beauty of God living for God live or die what different does it make as long I'm for God what different does it make let us bow our heads tonight heavenly father I thank you for this is what you lay upon my heart to share with your people father oh God that they will pray for us that they will pray for the ministry that they will pray that God would send down the holy ghost that pray that go would positionally place his sons that we could be channel of communications for inspiration to flow through father God it is getting to where that we say the tire hits the road and all those disrespectful and grumbling and bad attitude people in the church Lord that have fought the ministry for years they will be exposed because this is the only way you will work and father some of them Lord they bad talk they Grumble they carrying all kind of stuff and it has affected their own families and their children and their whole lives and they fail to recognize it father you demand respects for your servants God and the prophet taught us if we cannot respect the man respect the office that he holds father you put each one of us in different positions that you could use us For Your Glory it was not one nose or one eye or one mouth or or just just the whole body is not a mouth the whole body is not an eye or ear it's a complete body that have eyes and ears and and and neck and and everything this and we need each part the little finger every man to take up his place father God may this be a stirring tonight in the hearts of your people may they realize just as you said behold I send you Elijah the prophet and that was the word just as you spoke that Ephesians 4 a fivefold Ministry is also the word and that word will become flesh Pastor will become flesh that word Pastor evangelist will become flesh Apostle Prophet teacher will become flesh Lord we invite you we ask you we plead we cry out unto you that you would come and confirm your word among us Lord Lord send down the Holy Ghost place your sons place the ministry and I put out a request tonight to pray for us there's a leadership issue oh God in the land and father we want the Holy Ghost to be the leader the Holy Ghost to be the guide oh granted father to tonight as the people pray may you freshly anoint them may they see father and may they believe that we are directed by God that we are directed by the Holy Spirit and may they see that you will confirm your own word granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen so I trust this exaltation to you tonight would be helpful to you and that you would see that is not a game it's not a pleting god going to to conf his word
