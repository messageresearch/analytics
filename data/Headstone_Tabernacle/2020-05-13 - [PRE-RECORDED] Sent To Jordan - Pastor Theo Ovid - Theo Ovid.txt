John chapter 12 when I read from verse 20 and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was abysses of Galilee desired him seen so we would see Jesus and Philip commit and tell it Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus jesus answered them saying they always come at the Son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corner we'd fall into the ground and die it abideth on but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit let's bow heads once more father we thank you for your presence and we pray that you would come along in your word speak life speak to our hearts transform us even as we wait on you in Jesus and we ask it Amen on Eamon you may be seated or praise the name of the Lord notice the cry in every age he that hath an ear to hear let him hear the group was never addressed a bunch of people was never addressed it has always been to the individual so this Redemption message is not to a group or to a church or to a denomination or organization it's to the individual so this morning a title sent to Jordan another subject the debt of a corn of wheat a corn of wheat hallelujah not corn the corn that's you that's the individual hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and I got that text from the Scripture we read where Elijah told Elijah tarry here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan he was sent to Jordan it represents that being sent to die you don't bury a green seed you bury a right Lucy a mature seed so once you become ripe sure you are being made ready to be sent to Jordan not the church you not everybody you ready amends them alright you didn't end the show this morning you had a shot you know because this is this is the word now Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord from the resume of the ages what about from our studies we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known the truth spoken of and spoken to in this book nor does it refer to the pure ecclesia the elect the body of Christ the bride listen but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called Christians whether they are true or merely nominal as all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians thus we learn that the church is made up of two vines the true and the force the two vines have you are motivated by two kinds of spirit one is the holy spirit while the other is endued with the spirit of the Antichrist yet danger CH both claim to know and be known of God both purport to speak for God both believe certain very basic truths and define others but since both bear the name of the Lord being watch called Christians and by such name Biron obviously claim a relationship to him God calls it marriage God now holds them both responsible to him and therefore speaks to each because of their claim God speaking to all are you with me we further learned that these two vines were grow side by side until the end of the ages here we go when both would come to purity and both will be harvested the false vine listen carefully would not overcome and destroy the true vine that's out of it that have no provision for that God didn't make no provision for no false line to destroy true vine that's not going to happen oh could be here gets out in that one and then neither would a true vine be able to bring the false vine into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ so don't even try because the cow in them they get plugged into Jesus because the bride will be plugged into her husband her mate the reveal word do you know why your husband is your husband is the reveal word butter brown call that your meat so you must know many hearing from your husband you'll be hearing the reveal word if you're hearing something other than what your husband said is not your husband because the word is God isn't that right say if your husband gonna send your word it has to be his word which is the reveal word or the Bible was a sealed book but it was unsealed so the book that we have now is now a revealed book because God sent a prophet to reveal the whole mystery of God for the wrapkin of the church he didn't reveal the mystery for us to be educated he revealed a mystery for us to be clouded because about us and his wife at Minister Freddie what's the use you know and you're not being made ready you know what's coming on you made no preparation the reason that you know what's coming is that you might be pure so we learn the most amazing truths that the Holy Spirit could fall upon the Unruh generated false vine Christians and manifests powerfully in various signs and wonders Eamon Judas had a definite ministry in the Holy Ghost though he himself was pronounced to be a devil but these principles in mind we start to trace the church to the various seven ages the birth of church was at Pentecost the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God was undefiled for a briefs man so was Christ the last Adam give my bright beyond fresh at Pentecost she remained separate and only five for some time and there's no man joined himself to them but God added to the church such as would be saved that was the bride nobody didn't join to them God sent them God said additions to the church hallelujah he kept a pure he kept it clean he kept it righteous he judged the wicked unjust evil to protect that church that was his bride or could we give the Lord a show acts 5:13 and the Lord added daily such as would be saved acts 2:47 AHA right and how long discontinued we do not know but one naeema's Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit spirit and this is the spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard of and even now is already in the world first and for 3 and Jesus said considering his prize in this first age I have somewhat against thee because I was left I first love remember where folk where dull had fallen and repent the church was in the first age already a fallen woman a Satan had gotten to II before Adam even know Satan's he'd used the church the Bride of Christ before the might sup of the Lamb but what specifically was in her midst that caused the fall what what revelation 2 6 prophetess is reviewing it the deeds of the Nicolaitans already the first age had tuned from following the pure Word of God I like that I like how that is freeze do it it up your word I have mixtures where people add in and take an event subtract and shaking it up and then presenting it to the people they turn from God's demand of a church absolutely dependent on him that was costs the man to depend upon him because he was God of the people he was always one of the people but what came in was spirit a man to conquer the people and inject you have God but you need a man to God plus intellect God was human God was the injection of an organizational sprit of men depending entirely upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government that were that means the nickel it isn't Nick elitism which is all a human government within the church which all governments do the legislate for the people they did exactly what Israel did they took the experiencee of human government instead of the word and spirit so Israel had pillar of fire they had profit and they come and tell the profit and we want a king he said what you're talking about I'm working is God what you want is a well the other all nations have King then got all the profit they have not rejected you they are rejected me give him a king they want a man take one and that's how they got sure but David was coming but they didn't want to wait dynamics is coming but they didn't want to wait the holy oceans coming but they didn't want to wait Oh hallelujah so God give them a substitute don't take a substitute it have real the Holy Ghost is just as real as well Peter received it as well although speedily ill-received [Applause] for the Menem who if anything was made in my image it looked like me if something I made in the image of the church it would look like the church something was made in the image and to the piece which was loo tourism metal ISM is I know we not get in that just yet it's almost too good to be true that this is oh god see see when God looked down upon the mother Hallett and see blasphemous names those names is represented by Baptist Methodist Pentecostal do with all those names are blasphemous names that's all it is in the spirit realm you see nice church a nice building under there 50 years and a hundred years when God looked dongs if blasphemous names in the junk to the Beast enemy of God hallelujah for the Antichrist spirit you don't want to be in that channel you want to be a channel for the holy spirit all of them isn't forming an organization I mean an image like unto the Beast do you see them but a brand I'm all Catholics Methodists or Baptists are going I didn't see that there are thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of born-again Christians in those churches but in their organization they are trying to try them to a Creed and they won't stand for it because when our church organizes it comes under a creed you could only organized under a creed or doctrine you cannot organize Christ because as a life you could build systems along it but you kind of organize the life the light will pop out and break out and move out Oh hallelujah that's why Jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church he had the village church on something that cannot fail he had to build it in a shuang car so he put it on revelation that only the spirit that bring the mother can stop you from getting revelation the person in front of you can't stop you from getting revelation not even your sins could stop you from getting revelation because God is sovereign revelation is sovereign he receiveth whomsoever he will that's the God that we serve [Applause] so do you get it now organizational spirit must come under a Creed but the brightness last day she has no Creed but Christ amen no book but the Bible the Bible has become open by a seven C seventh on the message it opened the word to her that you could know take the wooden apply to your own life but abandon there's a common her time up in this nation the way this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beasts had before it which was taken Rome revelation 13 plainly explains it the lamb come out of the earth the other beasts come out of the water tickets and multitude a lamb represent freedom of religion but afterwards received power and spoke like a dragon Roman denomination as a mark would test any nomination and imogen to the Beast and it will be a power here we go that will force all put tests on like a union you'll have to be this conquerors or you will receive no fellowship we know the story the Easter story it has Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees here come Jesus humble man manifest in God he's in the second reason the dead all of a sudden all those guys who couldn't be in how many form a council called ISA heejun council because they had to deal with Jesus because Jesus affected them to the left of the right to the north of the south to the east of the West he affecting them all around he was rocking their world this Messiah or glory was brought on the bride once more the world will hear tyreq from God you are going to thunder not with your mouth but the devil's Kingdom will get shut up [Applause] don't think you can hide you can't hide there's a light over you and all those demons hear you not even seen it but this unit you are mocked by God on the dinner table with his mark on you you are ready mark you already mad you are marked to be sealed you are marked to be filled you are marked with baptize with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost glory glory you may be seated hallelujah remember every name on the book it's not the same as the problem it's not the adultery fornication is a problem the pressure question is is your name on the book that [Applause] is my important than adultery drinking smoking jobs you name it that is the important thing is your name on the book [Applause] may be seated because if your name is on the book nothing gonna stop you from connect him to your name on that book no drugs no pass nothing present nothing to come no glory to God no wonder John shouted no wonder John scream no one that John said all in heaven I praise God because he saw his name he saw his name he saw him be redeemed he said we shall reign on the earth hallelujah you may be seated that's why when Jesus met the woman of the world he'll get no fight when she said I have no husband he said you have five and he won your little is not yours that wasn't his problem you know he said we'll talk about that some other time well I want you to know right now this morning is that your name is in the book and I come to call your name right from under the book because what you see is the book he was saying I am the book and I come to release your name that woman and that woman shouted that woman rejoice that woman was so happy because she was free [Applause] Gouri [Applause] if the devil could bind you to your sins magnetic past - the feeling he'd get you because he will always have his finger at the point that's brought a ward and said when you see a do dis to do this he say yes you do wanna say no wonder mr. look look at a laiá laiá laiá you did this yes did it that yes you finish no awesome or continue and when he finished he said but but Jesus took my charges and this was my case get behind me Satan the Bible said you accused of the bridge newscast on [Applause] [Music] mr. he come back usual his office is accused of the original that's his title little [Music] Unitarianism morning that's his title keys of the bedroom [Applause] he supposed to [Applause] finish look oh there's a lot of show yeah you can tell that devil look look look look that get Cowdery brother price was paid for me [Applause] but Branham is practically that way now you can go to church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification and places like ourselves we're gonna be cut off for that all together we won't the one be able to do it do it it's a tightening and when that time comes and the press comes to a place where your presto then watch I'm fixing to tell you what's the triple then it will be for the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church from recognizing this message he said now Israel back in the homeland she didn't know how she got back there she was automatically put back there national force put her in her place so then when Israel was scattered by God's judgment my scene is blood be upon us on all children at Calvary and he judge them and scattered them because that they come back Hitler Stalin Mussolini all him was anointed to drag his people back to droop traductor I'm the Israel force put them back there first put them back there yes some persecution and pressure go for the churches together to because when the demons had a movie I said we believe we believe we believe no you just seen a light over all of them look like that light come from this star seven staff and they have a light shining upon your life deficit owed them that's why the devil will be so furious when the bright leave alone oh he go war with the remnant of the woman seed I've been warned about that remnant I want to mix in the bright rays God I don't wanna be part of that remnant virus a fiber wise fiber foolish praise God you want to be a pastor that wise Bunch we're gonna make yourself ready isn't that right I'm gonna say something national force but Israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the workings of touches but here we go the power of God will put the people in the pride what if every minister preached that hallelujah the power of God will but not some minister no not some pasta some prophet or teacher depicts the power of God yes we have no power we are finished it will take power but we have a promise he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you that's our promise you maybe see that if Jesus didn't know ya a poet he could say this for this body and cheese Ariza myself he know

lie down and the bull coming how much Shh breast brakes turn along and go back and laid on oh that's Adam back on the earth that's what Adam had in Genesis that's what Adam had in the Garden of Eden this what was demonstrated that is what we gonna have something gonna come over you [Applause] something got to come over you you may be seated you don't need our whispering posture you need to hear the truth you gotta truth it all gonna set you free Jesse you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free praise God and have doors in nominations just as bad enough private poops it's time not in Africa ministers who have nothing good to say but more the minister did not tell the people they are right general the same this one wrong this one wrong that one wrong that one or that one wrong that not wrong that one gotten wrong and the people will deduce well my pastor is right I said I'd be an intellectual idiot that think I'm the only man that God could use this omnipotent God all could uses english-speaking people I don't accept that it mean no French no Spanish neutral man no in not only english-speaking people go to the Englishman sorry he bigger than X but Iran say God knows where every flight butters I every flight not your two flights live in your house every fly give no one every five by the eye and this omnipotent all-powerful a mission god she's hands a short that he can't heal but he can deliver as I preached one time he wanted to demonstrate he's a deliverer three loose Moses to bring these people out to prove he's a Gordon's bringing out a wall John preached he didn't get no spoken word in Yemen fellas only Jacob and spoken word it's what O'Neill's given to Moses and Genesis and Exodus because it was for redemption Redemption by blood retention by power you need a spoken word let there be and if we going back to Redemption we need the spoken word oh my my my I was so tremendous Oh glory so therefore the power of God would put the people might say task me the power of God will put the people in the bride standing in the power of God would put the people in the bride don't you forget that so what do you come to church for you come to church to connect with the power of God hallelujah praise God so therefore these Greeks came to see Jesus script to be read and they came to his disciples and these disciples they pull them aside and said here what we will tell you all you need to know about him and the pull of this Greek society know that there's not an environment when they acts we will see Jesus disciples took them straight to Jesus no side shows we need people to be pointed to Christ not to a group not to a church not to a man but Jesus Christ and when they came to Jesus he said don't even look at me have a place I want to point you to he said SEPA corner we'd fall into the ground and die it abideth alone so he's pointing to the cross he's pointing them to where they will really see him he's pointing them to Jordan [Music] he was sending them there hallelujah so therefore is one thing to get a revelation that your corner wheat that's the first thing you are bought corn of wheat all seven hundred seven virtues seven voices seven revelation that make you God's porn God's corn of wheat hallelujah but then the next step is you got to die because you remain alone but God want much fruit and the process for much fruit means purge and put it more and so on to bring forth much fruit you see here is my father glorified how must go be glorified in us by signal and say we believe no we have to be fruit Darrin where does food come from it start off with the seed this see doesn't look like a fruit the fruit doesn't look like a seat but the seed is planted and your weight on it the seed is planted and truly process of time it pushed for the chute and everything else and bring forth fruit this is what God did he plant the seed in there Pentecost and it represent a church a book of Acts he knew that Alpha and Omega will be the same so God promised just as was the Alpha Church will be the Omega church same science same wonders same miracles same life isn't that right they were adopted they had the person of the Holy Ghost dad a personal Christ but they couldn't be translated because wasn't a seasoned time for that but we have to go back and pick up what they hand so we can go forward without picking up what they had because they had the held in they had the original put somebody say Amen so course and a prophet to pack us to point us back to the original what Peter had what Paul had is one spirit you know is that two spirits and is one spirit you know and they had it so we have the one pick up what they have and then come back and then go forward Oh glory to God because it was the coming of the Lord there should have gone on to the rapture but God had seeds that did not yet come God had seven ages to be unfolded so the early church happens to go down the upcoming looter come Wesley up company cuss and now here come you [Applause] so Gaurav Oh Dean you to be the cap of the ages so you are known the capstone bride or the headstone bride Hebrews 11 yeah without us and not made perfect God or something better for us that we got them or pull them or draw them out we are going to be the cap magnet to pull them out of the ground it's gonna be a power coming to the church [Applause] that it will raise the dead [Applause] you may be seated Jesus already demonstrate resurrection power upon Lazarus Mun stinking man dead four days God make sure it was a deterioration and sure what restoration power by the voice of the Archangel what that will do that nothing will stop God's word upon your life of restoration I don't know fire you have drifted I don't have fire you are floated God's Word to your life will deliver you nothing to stop you Jesus and Lazarus comfort I know Jesus didn't say Lazarus all the dead was gonna come for um no come on now same as somebody yet the specifically called Lazarus by name no Lazarus was gonna get all and die I'm this time very properly but he proved a point that the dead could be raised that he could snatch his soul and bring it right back to a point that this is not the only life now when you leave here is another dimension in somewhere else this is not the end of it there of we have another life we have another house we have another world we are not from here all glory to God amen hallelujah praise the Lord in there Laurie it's all message Testament Jesus Christ he said I'm go up Calvary dogma Christ Dominic move it out scene I wonder why they're little specks was all over it it gets bigger one big bloody garment I hear they're slapping around his legs what was it it was the Lamb of God was going to carry to be sacrifice he had to die for only out of Death Comes life did you hear that only out of death Lisa corner wheat falls in the ground it abides alone if it dies it produces life and Jesus had to die to produce eternal life nor listen closely Christian friends unless you die to yourself and your feelings and act on God's Word you will never have life forget your feelings that's our order turn to somebody and tell them just that forget your feelings I [Applause] am feeling this out forget that so I am feeling the worship forget that for sure I asked you to stand up forget that you stand up I am feeling the give God praise forget that forget to feel it they get your feelings and take what God said and plant that seed into your life of your own debt or your own death and life we produce out of the out of there and you shall live Jesus wasn't easy and when Jesus called him with the bread and fish after all he's had a drop some bumps and let me know accepting for sick mother father brother and follow me not good yummy so as you get in the crowd and then you just drop the word on them you see if you don't wanna forsake all you're not weary of me then forsake all is that condemning a separation mother against daughter father against son a condemning a separation what he's always talking about the stripping down to the individual it could be hiding the group we hide in the family we hide in the crowd going to pick you out telescope hidin hallelujah we hide and make excuses we hide and we blame others don't want you to kill all of that go glory to God let's go a little further now today we try to find him in everything try to find him in church building try the funny man denomination try to find him in a Creed we keep trying to find him i certain days obey certain rituals but we cannot find them till we come to Calvary dear we are crucified fall into the dust of the earth and die to ourselves and be reborn again and then we find Jesus so many tried to hold their selves I mean they know what either I've got my way of it I believe this but you cannot find Christ until you die to yourself so sometimes you too big for your own good it still have too much are you so go out to put a steamroller sometimes and just and you tell us that it's not coming it not coming all things work together for good you close the eyes but it is coming because that sounds so big it's not a normal roller for that is he heavier ones I never see a big steamroller it doesn't move left and right and left right now it has grown extreme part I'm going some let me get you call that you in one part and you can't move unless in his team ruler coming who is coming for it's coming for thee [Applause] hallelujah what is it sent to Jordan I want to say Amen when I hear that anytime you strike the title boy Ellen [Applause] nobodyís walking on this road I know I go a grown-up Windham daughter no you what happened but he likes you following Neal angel' itll I didn't tell about Jordan but sure done it cool if I push it that way maybe like some others do but you know what he felt if a power and he was following with his powers leading when Jesus got baptized he felt power but that power led him into the wilderness I'm not hearing you this morning so that power is what Elijah was following and this man Elijah trying to discourage this young man I said stay here stay there the last thing was the Lord had sent me to Jordan they the last chance that your daughter died out big last chance and it go back and sit around watch movie after movie have more last chance that you could love the world and do whatever last chance but after this is different I'm giving you option today's a turning point the days a junction where are you gonna cross on that the Lord have sent me to
