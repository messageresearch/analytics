whereof we are witnesses and his name through faith and his name have made this man strong whom you see him no yield of faith which is buying him had given him his perfect sonís in the presence of you all and no brethren I wot that through ignorance you did it as did also your rulers but those things which God before had showed by the motive his prophets that Christ should suffer he had so fulfil repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord Elisha sent Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive there we go until the times of the restitution or the restoration of all things which God had spoken by the mount of his holy prophets since the world began Ephesians 1 we did from verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ were blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before Middle Earth having predestinated us on the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had appointed to watch us in all wisdom and prudence having been known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which and heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who look at all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and the last scripture from George after to 4,000,000 scripture reading from verse 23 be glad the Nichiren of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former in moderately and he will come to condone for you the rain the former rain and the latter in in the first month and the floor shall be full of weeks and the fact shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker woman the caterpillar and the prama womb my great army which I sent among you you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God not a 12-1 is liberty and my people shall never be ashamed that's a promise and he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel that's a promise that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit that's a promise upon all flesh and your young men shall see visions the old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon their hands in those days when I pour out my spirit that's the promise and I will show wonders in heavens and the blood fire pillars of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord and shall come shall come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for among Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord had said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call it's pre Heavenly Father we thank you for your word give unction to speak your word Lord he functioned to receive it to hear your word and bring deliverance and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles for we are in the season of signs miracles granted Father in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you can be seated who praised God thank you lord we have a title this morning the if he fission is the bridge to glory land or praise the name of the Lord I have an inspiration I will restore see the Lord and the new ax is talking about whom the heaven must receive until the restitution of all things in law was has enough to hold Jesus until everything be restored God we have a promise a full restoration and we know the conquer woman a caterpillar a Palma one they eat them watch tree but cause say I will restore we believe that and the first thing that demon was eaten was the fruit the Prophet talked about that devil porn sitting in front like a grasshopper greedy T comma world he come to eat of brotherly love they ever know what to do the first thing we attack was the fruit of brotherly love because once brother love is killed then you can't have the faith because faith is based on forgiveness so once you kill godly love the fit is not there so he almost make the church paralyzed because the faith is not yet to break out so therefore pearly cannons have to be restored for the faith to be restored look like what put brotherly kindness just below Holy Spirit or glory to God faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness the Holy Spirit or glory that ghost of branding kindness is the window is the door to access the spirit because it is this upon forgiveness we could never emphasize that God put you in the age of brotherly kindness therefore you need a show people the searcher say wears a voucher but you have to be dead so that you can respond you have a see somebody in a coffin you can watch them you could cry beat them at the flower beat them in the rows did not move it you know why be dead if you see that moving you know they're around you know something wrong that person's supposed to be dead well quad cab area manual life hallelujah buddy push something had your foot come up push on your foot your hand come up get out of that coffin you are not dead become Barry you got one dead man get to themselves that today ideas dead of what you take this river is supposed to be today all blowing up Gloria disappointed because it wasn't expecting but over to speak you have your favorite speaker get to all and act all glory dog or well I thought he was gonna be this way and that way no look get that all I that you just want what God want to speak to you God will speak direct to you stop looking at anybody else hallelujah not looking for your neighbor and what they need Matt that they know you're looking for you you want to know how to be empowered that rippln is man's come on bring a bit court when you're coming and as the preacher preaches put it in his pocket put in this bucket put some bums here put some guns here you're just loading up because when you leave here in warfare or give the Lord a show the nerves or you with no pen I you have to leave it with equipment heavy equipment go glory to God you think Russia them keeping the same all thing they'll use forty

this is such a fun little Jubilee ho glory to God amen oh listen to my pleas what a punch oh that was fast Oh glory to God this is the court we get inside of some but the balance says here how do you do sir we are strangers to each other I don't know you as far as I know is the first time I've seen you for me to know you but you know why this is taking place it's His grace permitting it that I will bring these four countries of God not knowing nothing about you not even knowing you know we just a strange man has come here no it would be absolutely a paradox with something to happen to know what's wrong with you but something you had done or something you ought not to have done something you should have done or who you are or something about - it would have to be a paradox there's no way for anybody to know that outside of some revelation of the unseen so that's right now if he will do that for you between you and I sooner the audience this is not for sure but they might see the Ephesus is here and that this is the thing that bridges between the nomination and glory line he promises that it might be assured that what we are telling the truth so here he's asking God to manifest himself not for a show but the prove that he was in his emphasis and Ephesians is the bridge that clean up that process from the nomination the glory line so here it is we're coming to the
