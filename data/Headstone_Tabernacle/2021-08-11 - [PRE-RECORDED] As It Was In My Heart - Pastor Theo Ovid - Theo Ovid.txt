amen so this night we want to go into the scriptures uh we want to read joshua chapter 14. i want to read from verse 6 to 14. ezekiel chapter 36 you want to read from verse 24 to 27 and proverbs 23 wanna read one booster verse seven reading from joshua chapter 14 reading from verse six then the children of judah came unto joshua and giggle and caleb the son of jeffrey the killer night said unto him don't know it's the thing that moses said unto me that the lord said unto moses the man of god considering me and thee in kinespania 40 years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kinespania to inspire the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god and moses sway on that day saying surely the land where thy feet have trotted shall be dying inheritance and thy children's forever because thou has holy followed the lord my god now behold the lord had kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord speak this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day four score and five years old and i am yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war were to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where of the lord speak in that day for thou whodest in that day all the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and joshua blessed him give unto caleb the son of jeffernaire hebron for inheritance hebrew and therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephthah the kisses knight unto this day because he wholly faltered the lord god of israel ezekiel chapter 36 reading from verse 24 to 27 and i will take you from among the hidden and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land you can underline own land then while i sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your idols and will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away this tony hat out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes you shall keep my judgment and do that last scripture from proverbs chapter 23 1 verse verse 7 for as he think it in his heart so is he let us pray father we thank you for your word interpreted us tonight and blessed and lord may fire fall upon the people tonight that they'll be still in faith and you'll weaken them to righteousness granted lord in jesus name i ask it amen and amen will be seated welcome tonight to our wednesday night service thanks for coming out it's good to see all of you here tonight are we looking to see what the lord will do tonight amen praise god our title tonight as it was in my heart as it was in my heart this is joshua's this is caleb's testimony he brought word as it was in his heart okay let's go there's something to the exodus but a man the spiritual man can look down in egypt and see persecution rise and see joseph taken away in order that persecution could rise the prophet said that and this here referring to is there raise up a pharaoh who knew not joseph now remember joseph saved egypt by his vision an interpretation of the vision that that the pharaoh had he actually saved egypt and his family came and got blessed and everything else now joseph was taken out that the prosecution could rise hallelujah and joseph will be removed and brother banham type joseph as freedom of religion and all this america which is revelation 13 she was founded on freedom of religion isn't that right and we know that the b system going to be activated where the saints going to become persecuted or pressed this is our promise that we're going to have a press come down and at that time you're going to see the table in effect and brown give testimony what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in its fullness so there's a manifestation to come but i want you to notice what god did when they came out of egypt he gave testimony to them go into the land these 12 brothers these 12 ministers these 12 whatever you want to call them of the 12 tribes go into the land and bring back evidence to the people of what i promised so you can't just this talk this thing it have to have evidence of this thing you have to taste this thing you have to experience this thing you have to feel this thing it's not a book thing a talk thing a written thing it's a manifested thing it's real grapes hallelujah when god tells them the land full of milk and honey he wasn't the imagination it was a reality so these brothers had a testimony the land is the good land but it's just we can't take it because too much a giants in the land oh glory to god but caleb had something in his heart and tonight you have to have something in your heart oh glory to god he said i holy follow the lord he wasn't thinking about a giant he wasn't thinking about his condition he wasn't thinking about his sickness he wasn't thinking about nothing around him hallelujah all he was thinking about what god promised and friends we have to come to that spot oh glory to god i was a young man coming to this message and look i'm green and getting old heading out of here sometime oh glory to god but listen to this caleb said i was young oh glory to god are just as strong as when i first started out and this promise is so real we just as strong and when we first started out we are well able to possess that land this land of promise oh glory to god and these backsided people these slackers god said i'm going to call you out from and bring it into your own land and i will clean you oh glory to god because you are god's people that's why you find you you know you're fine you can leave your dirty unfilthy he'd bring you out to clean you he said a new heart i'll give you with your heart you can't agree with this one you can't agree with that one your blood can't take this one your blood can't take that one i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit i'll give you a heart towards me i'll give you a spirit that you could agree with the word oh glory to god that rebellious heart he angry with nothing here like what the preachers say yeah you're fight with the preacher fight with this one and fight like your own old spirit but i'll give you a spirit that you can live with peacefully with your neighbor that you can behave yourself and then i'll put my spirit inside your spirit and then you're going to walk like me they're going to talk like me they're going to act like me because i'm going to be in you give the lord a shout this is your promise you are you born in sin shape iniquity but he promised you a new heart he promised you a new spirit he promised you his spirit so don't feel bad at night he promised let's negotiate don't your sins be a scarlet they shall be white as wool white as snow come on let's let's talk about it let's discuss this thing oh hallelujah so i want to see that now watch so for persecution to rise he said joseph had to be taken away in order that the position will rise something have to take place because barbara says they're going to close down these kind of churches now i know i know we're hearing that here but overnight you will show things just change suddenly overnight there's no game here this is prophecy you know remember the devil controlling all nations including trinidad on all all the laws they're setting up is to come against the christians you know the devil is a judge there you know barbara says they're waiting for dynamics and the united nations to enforce the law so their witness dynamics are we waiting on dynamics dynamics will bring in effect all things because dynamics is the spirit to bring the seeds to life los angeles thinking there's a seed that was spoken of a prophet but that spirit coming behind that sea to make it manifest in its season and time you being filled with the holy ghost is a seed your deliverance is a seed your healing is a seed and the spirit comes behind the seed to make it manifest in your life the question is if you believe it because sin is unbelief it's if you believe it because sin is not smoking and drinking sin is unbelief because if god is speaking and you believe it that's it you could have it tonight let me say that again if you hear it receive it and believe it and act upon it you can have it so balarama says uh how we can see the wheels and the weeds moving god great plan moving everything back up to this exodus to this time when he would call his people back into the land again back in the place in position where he could bless them and place among them the one he had promised they had to be in their land remember they had to come out of the land they were in to get into the land of the promise before the promised messiah could ever come so you're saying that messiah jesus can come in egypt he can come in the wilderness that'll go in the kingdom land that is the promised land and the bride have to come into her land to see the promise of the hour that god promised you know we have a land to go to you know god called you the baptist a methodist not to say i come out i come out i come out you come up you come out yesterday come on no no what you're going into because redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into you come out you come out you come out but you have to go into come on now say amen you're coming that's good you went long just that's good your fear is clean that's good you're saying lord that's good you come out but you have to go into oh glory to god hallelujah and the journey was just a journey to the promised land so you have battles you have fight you have upset that is part of the journey but yeah reach yet hallelujah you have to get into your land into your promise into your anointing to your blessings your inheritance your individual inheritance because caleb wasn't ready for anybody else he was saying give me my individual inheritance i ain't asking for nobody i'm talking about you have no tribe or no group or no family give me my mountain oh glory to god i have a revelation this mountain is mine and when you come to that spot when you see what is yours you fight for him you're not looking if sister scissors are taking it or brother brother taking it no you're not looking mother sister sister or brother brother you want to know what is yours and you're determined [Music] they had to be in their land remember that they come with the land that they were in to get into land of promise before the promised messiah could ever come and the church has to do the same thing get out the bunch group of rejecters people rejecting me servants rejecting seven thunders rejecting me by their promises people have to come out of that because they're meeting them in that foolishness god has sent a prophet to open this to open all seven seas for people to be in unbelief all seven seas open the end time series the seventh seal and underneath they have seven thunders that is the guys that they bright together they're just bright exclusive by promise only the bride could respond to that you know what that'd be bright invitation only to break and hold that ticket exclusive by promise seven thunders oh glory to god hallelujah let's continue he said no watch and the church has to do the same thing get out that group of rejecters over into the promise before messiah can ever be manifested you see it congratulations say amen then hear this bummy drop the life of the messiah manifested making a church ready a bride you see no teacher teaching that he has no mysteries revealing that he has no explanation talking that he said the life of the messiah manifested is going to make a church ready not talking fested manifested this is not talking this is this god to come to pass life of the messiah then what is the life of the messiah it's faith it's virtue it's knowledge it's temperance it's patience it's godliness it's probably kindness that is the life of the messiah [Applause] oh give the lord a shout on that these virtues here this is the life of the messiah that have to be manifested oh glory to god that's what i'm saying the rapture is not outside in the rapture is inside out you have to have the rapture in you oh give the lord a shout that's a powerful thing you know when you see that you will understand you can't bribe the rapture you can't pay some brother to the rapture you can't hold on to the past the han and go on the rapture it have to have it inside and no man could put that inside of you but in ezekiel he said i'll give you a new heart so i want to give you a new spirit i will put my spirit inside a deer oh glory to god hallelujah something have to start within you oh give the lord a shout it has to start within you have to have a testimony from within you have to bring a word like caleb as it was in my heart give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god i want your head that's why what abram says the woman of the world she had five man the one she lived wasn't shown and burum said she was clean and insane and dirty outside the pharisees was clean outside and dirty inside and god reject one which is the pharisee and accept the other which is the one at the well because she had an honest heart when he said go call your husband she said i've none she's he spoke the truth yeah these devious yeah coming up on the hunting hallelu that's why god asked jacob who are you the angel who are you the guy i mean because i say i'm a smart man i just trick people i just rip people i'm a ripoff man i'm a con man jay was a con man you know or smarting anybody family friend relative you name it it doesn't matter he ripping him off but he came to his waterloo he came to his cross he came where he had to be changed and he didn't want no kind of touch and come with a blessing and say god bless he wanted to change walked hallelujah changed talk a changed life he didn't want some show as a blessing hit him he wanted a transformation and you know he had to wrestle with the angel and he wrestled all night long it was not two minute prayer it wasn't a half an hour prayer he was wrestling all night long you can't wrestle with the injured and you're sleeping the car wrestling you're tired and you're giving up no no he was wrestling the angel wanted to go he said not yet not tonight until you give me a new walk and you talk then you could go but i will not let you go until you bless me oh glory to god and jacob russell so much that he name and all change hallelujah he seemed to israel then he had 12 sons then they get the 12 tribes of israel look at the nation of israel because a man wrestled with god and the blessing begins to flow from out of his loins oh give the lord i shout i feel good tonight oh glory to god hallelujah praise god amen you may be seated he said a woman marrying a man disagree with him it will be first continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend he's exposed are in perfect harmony like one soul and one man because they're going to be one flesh then so he's making a reference and then coming back to the church then when the church can get in such harmony with god until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they won't be one praise god i don't want to hear about wisdom being the greatest gift we had that for 50 years that is not like not no scripture greatest gift is to fit the word together oh yeah they would fit in together a long time we fitted so we fitted so we fitted so we fitted so it fit fit fit no the harmony with god until until what more revelations more mysteries until the manifestation of the bridegroom began to start to work into the pride he even said with the thunders he said then you are worshiping the living christ when them thunders begin to roar and manifest among the people then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out all glory to god are giving you the promises this is your promise your promises are no man on your own that's a promise if i dead any morning this is still truth this is what you have to look for there are three stages of the journey and there are three stages of the journey we are justified by faith believing in the lord jesus christ forsaken land of egypt come out sanctified by the offering of his blood washed from our sins and so and then we are seeking a land a city that's coming or a promise so did israel in the wilderness they were just types sojourners no place to rest traveling night after night following a pillar of fire so today up the mountain along the valley challenge of wilderness this happened to you that happened there you're journeying some people give up in your wilderness they know the land oh god it's hot it's hot i'm tired yes it's wilderness we want air conditioned breeze is wilderness a thirsty are thirsty we are finding water it's really nice whatever spring somewhere after you pass through a dry spell you come to church and the water will just break up on you my god your soul gets refreshed you all get revived you're going through a journey it's a personal journey it's not a church thing you know think that you're taking a retake everybody going through the same thing they're not 10 commandments the video movie you know they know that you know this is individual you know you're going to your own stages but you have a lambda promise oh hallelujah praise god so watch no place to rest traveling night after night watch following the pillar of fire but finally come down to the promised land where they settle down that is where the believer comes you first have to recognize he's a sinner then he's separated by the waters the washing of the water by the blood and by the word rather believe in the lord jesus being justified by faith and then what he becomes a journal he's on a journey to what a promise god made israel had not yet received the promise and they were on their journey please do understand that is where you nazarina and primaguni so forth fell because israel when they come to the spot of kenish baniya when the spies went over and said the land is great some of them come and say we can't take it because the cities are walled up and so forth but joshua caleb stood out he said we are more than able to take it now all here in the same gospel you know all of me and the same talk from prophet moses you know but these guys these joshua and caleb guys them saying them talking different from the rest of the ministers all them fellas and one man and one accord we can't take it the negative about the promises of god hallelujah to take the easy road of mechanics mechanics until they mechanically spirit me say it again this is easy to do nowhere now talk about the prophet what you probably speak before the doctrines and touching my wife the children will go down and this and that and that and his historic history because they're afraid to believe what god promised [Music] i don't want no false manifestation i want no impersonation i want a false manifestation i want to really promise that listen listen them guys could i say they're taking it by faith you know but he said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endured powerful and high he tell them that after mysteries open after understanding open brother george after the word open he leave nothing unopened you know everything was open you know he said we had to wait for this thing my father have to send this thing hallelujah if i know god the comforter will not come so i can't give this to you this is god have to bring this down oh glory the god and then went in the upper room and there was praising and blessing god continually every service they worshipping because they know what they promised they know what they believe didn't know what to expect and only god could set dynamics no man could bring long dynamics in that sense it take god to send them he said do all that you can do get your heart right get your mechanics right and if you get your heart right get the mechanics in order then only he can set up the dynamics oh glory to god once you catch that your job is to stay sanctified your job is to stay into worship you're stopping to stay in the word and you come to church and worship and watch firefall upon your life oh glory to god this is your promise because you created an atmosphere they did it in the upper room you've got to do it here you can sit here and expect the preacher to bring some wafer there ain't no catholic priest preaching to you or give the lord a shout oh you have to fight like caleb i am just as strong as i was oh you think i'd be preaching i could do all your work and you're nothing you're sitting about hallelujah the wise virgin saw something that the foolish version did not see the wise version was willing to do something was not willing to do the foolish virgins was willing to be ordinary christians ordinary church members or believers the wise virgin wanted something extra so then they come to barely make it barely hold on in church this will give me more you have more of that y'all more where that come from my cop feeling empty tonight i want you to film a cup of lord pour that in lay that word in i want power on my job i want to see the power [Music] and when i see when i talk about power i'm not on what silent one is you know i'm done with power of life life that you could see overcoming you don't need to see no miracle you know what you want to know you're overcoming the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life a power to have life [Applause] may be seated like you are what you are waiting by yourself when you're in church you could play holy you can play righteous you can wear long tie wear long dress is it when you leave church is doing that same thing and behaving yourself that's what he told me it's how you live after you leave the church so the power are you talking about his power to live a holy life power to say i am sorry for what to say that's paul you know some people can't repent they can't even say i'm sorry i was wrong it's easier to say no mistakes were made [Music] and all things work together yeah but when you're wrong you're wrong when you're wrong you can't be right and wrong at the same time we were all wrong we were all born in censorship inequity that's why we all needed blood price paid and [Music] so i am fighting for more doctrine i'm not teaching no more mysteries and i want the mysteries and nutrition and reduction but i fight him for life there is something in me calling for something that i know god have there's a deep in me calling for something that god have man can supply that apostle prophet teacher pastor can't supply that i will think about that [Music] when you realize that the mancus applied that then you reckon wait a minute the man is a channel by which the word comes to me to go and get what god promised oh not even moses crossing to the land moses carry on and god said listen watch and don't touch you're not going across shut him down behind her because his behavior was kind of troublesome to god and moses was prophet and god said as is you okay moses is it a cabinet sophomore yeah crossover they cross over read your show right now read yourself one verse one moses my servant is dead not let me have some money for moses you know moses my servant is dead now joshua we have to go into ephesians no joshua you have to manifest and type because in the new testament we'll have a book called ephesians no joshua [Music] no appearing to preach no of hearing the preach hallelujah because joshua was typing the book of ephesians [Music] and ephesians is where the faith was anchored manifested ephesians was the standard the standard bearer of the age of ephesians where the light alpha light where the original apostolic church was at and we come to the last age we have gosh and a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the father or give the lord a shout so the faith is to come right back to joshua or give the lord a shout right back to this caleb joshua of it to say give me my mountain [Music] how much pastors have the church fighting with next churches minister fighting with other groups i say we have no fight with no church might fight and wrestle with the promise you think i could let some other church or somebody where all the crazy stuff and productions of devils stop me from getting my promise right the only hindering that i have is me nobody can hinder you is you hindering you if you wanted you could fight for it you could press for it if jacob wanted to say you see i pray halfway already i ain't praying again yes if the angelic coming of the not gonna say same thing too you're praying looking for a breakthrough danica said you know what i'm tired yes i i'm done think about it angel almost reach you and you you give up the injured shaking hearing about good lord all that distance i have the cover boy for this man and at this time but they're not all the believers i believe believers really believe when dany's had a whole lot in prayer so he ain't stopping he couldn't stop there's a soldier there you know he's caught up you know he is burdened you know you see time running out you see revelation 10 time shall be no more and people laid back just as prophesied people getting cool off just as prophesied people falling away just as prophesied and he's getting desperate because you see things closing in oh glory to god god already said he could put the hook and goggle magog and pull him down oh glory to god russia get pulled down to syria oh hallelu all them lining up close to israel is war going on you know oh his war is next and then 200 000 loose against the bride trying to cut you off in the resurrection by trying to cut you from perfection and perfection is going back to that spirit oh glory to god which was before the word oh harlow in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was the spirit fountain of spirit we have to go back to that oh give the lord a shout i know [Music] i know what i'm looking for and nobody can get my eyes off of that they can preach whatever they preach some now seeing angels seeing this have this angel and gabriel and all kind of stuff crazy stuff have nothing to do with the promise of the power all glory things imagine imagination and how can you like that they're making the god of their own thoughts i want the god of this word god sent a prophet for me to roll dice and say could it be what if it is could it be that could it be this what if it is the moon come out the star come out saturday i don't want to be could it be nothing i want to see the lord nothing else i don't want my own dream my own thoughts ideas i i want what god said but i said a dream doesn't mean perfect so don't let no dream tire you dream this dream this he said why you need an interpreter for the dream a dream is not accurate unless it's a direct thursday nothing but he said a dream you need that's why when people come to tell by around the dream he will tell them what they leave out yes tell them fellas tell let me dream he said you can't remember he said no man can do that he said listen i'll take off all your hair dinner all you're playing all these wise men and all i could all just see me you know kind of better always see me even better with this than you know because this dream was terrible and i can't remember it you see which man could do that then they remember daniel i mean joseph sent for joseph jerusalem have a god let me let me talk to my god let me talk to me lord and when he come back he could tell him exactly what to dream and this is the dream and this is the interpretation you can't fight that this is a dream this interpretation god said behold i sent you elijah by scripture when branham come there's the interpretation of malachi he fulfilled that some character want to say he's not that it's not that oh glory to god them jokers they're too late now back sitting people trying to say that prophet falls and this falls and we fall and the teaching falls and this falls it's too late we're already pregnant with messiah hallelujah hallelujah we're already pregnant with god what were you gonna produce we got must produce god you're pregnant with god you're gonna produce god you're not pregnant with a man's idea you're pregnant with god who is god hallelujah living word living word the logo spirit oh hell let's continue oh my lord my lord my lord hallelujah so they believe in two words of grace justification sanification that bunch and they could move any further listen that whole generation perished in the wilderness but two that went over into the promised land and brought back evidence that was a goodly land so god let them fellows taste it and then they couldn't go further judge them with 40 years making turns in the wilderness hallelujah then instead of the people going on receiving the holy spirit speaking with tongues reaching the power you know people though you believe in tongues number ones receiving holy ghosts and healing and whatnot anytime you talk about sangha one is the one pentecostal spirit there you have a sign and you wonder what's going on with them no signs no wonders but as soon as you talk about signs and wellness and power they have a problem just always speaking and they go tell me they go tell me do you want pedicles but in the gift of

praise and worship god i am grateful for the grace god give me this human is power you tell me i can't shout i will shout praise my god i'll get excited about this message [Applause] [Music] in the upper room i ain't reading your opponent but shaking handed walking step normal normal normal god bless you go and walk me step normal gotta hold some of them walking like drunk many people were startled you said holding fellas and lickers early in the morning it's too early to be tight it's too early people don't don't eat the bars open at that time what are they drinking up there he said they knew this is this is a new wine this is this is why i don't have all glory they've got their customers wine the customer drunk people didn't know how young people has behaved and they were acting like junk men they were drunk in the spirit when last year when i said i see that when i see somebody drunk in the spirit i ain't talking about drunk with the head top and i saw that stuff drunk in the spirit soaked down with god baptized with the holy ghost right there like they're sprinkling the message boy back lines like they're sprinkling they're going back like catholic or sprinkling spirit sprinkle i don't want to get sprinkled i want to dip in this thing i want water to swim in oh god help me tonight all glory this is terrible hallelujah i want to get wet done with this holy spirit you call it a baptized with the holy ghost not not sprinkled with the holy ghost baptized god take it and dip you inside of it when he dickens or you come up soak up oh glory to god you're dripping you're dripping and dripping over you're dripping with the holy ghost every devil knows something is upon you oh glory to god no weapon form against you could prosper oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god fire fire fire upon your life i feel that fire tonight oh glory to god amen you're fighting for this thing my god i am start to go where i want to go tonight let's continue my god but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit are like that that was going on to the promise they moved over into the land took the land settled down in the land as a possession before they get it as a possession they had a profession that god promised us that they could say over there that's my land across there but when you see the god over this is a possession now now i could cut the grass i could put my house i could put my balcony i could put my shed i could plant my vine i could plant my fig i could do all of that because i'm knowing the land you can't plant no figure no wilderness you can't count down in the wilderness you can't build no house in the wilderness you're dreaming in the wilderness because you're going on to our promised land oh glory so don't put your stake down where you are right now get into the promised land and you'll find out what it is just now hallelujah so i'm saying let's not stop believing on the lord jesus being baptized let's not stop because they clean us up from the life of sin but now we press on into a position i like that the teacher is supposed to teach the people to get their position what position opposition to a promise of the baptism holy ghost so i don't know what the educational message is about if it not taken us to the baptism of the holy ghost he said to press on into a position because that is a position a position watch to a promise of the bible he goes for peter said that there of the dead pentecost for the promises unto you and your children and then that are fire off even as many as the lord of god shall call so therefore ephesus ephesus here says it's like joshua positionally you notice joshua and cross you know into the land taking the land he divides the land if from here manas are here this one here god here he divided the land and notice it just burns our hearts each one of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in a labor pains that they will be positioned in the promised land so in her giving birth her birth pains cry named where they be placed so you are placed by labor pains [Music] do you hear that being preached i can't give you liberal pains i mean i'm in midwife liverpool's come on automatically when you're trying to bring forth when zion travailed zion broadford when you come to full term the baby have to come to maybe not resident in saturday it's a temporary place the baby holding on to come out so so therefore the whole world is travailing to give birth to the new world we have we have world war one world war ii gone just one month ago john already saw a new revenue earth so with another new thing you already saw it is in the bible but you have to get in your new world too a transformed life so he said a new heart a new spirit and i put my spirit within you and his spirit consists of seven parts oh don't get me started tonight i ain't talking about the baptism part are talking about them seven parts you're going to lay them several parts inside of you that you become a living moving monument you'll be a god on the earth [Applause] so ignorant man like peter when he knew what was in him he could say silver and gold i don't have but what i have what he had he had seven mysteries he had seven voices he had seven rainbows he had seven virtues oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god what was the mystery christ what's the mystery that was in peter he said rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ and the manchester united what was in him power in him oh god he could give it to anybody he could handle it to anybody oh hallelujah jesus never did that you know jesus it will not be made whole will not be made perfect jesus asked him you want to be healed you know but peter say rise up and walk look at look at peter when peter got to the house of cornelius god didn't tell peter what was going to unfold he didn't want to go to those hebrew hiddens those gentiles and why jesus had to talk he just has to talk to the world talk to the world talk the word holy spirit fell oh my oh my oh my god and her little testimonial sources talk about it uh she didn't say ingrid in the store he was talking about the lord and talking things and holy spirit fell and when the holy spirit fell among them there was nobody in the store at that time oh hallelujah spirit of god move among them yeah two sisters whatever gossiping whatever those back talking somebody they was talking things about the lord and the spirit of god came down for 10 15 minutes until one had to hold the other you talk about power now danielle fellas one dead brother i'm saying you know the blessing but not the power i have them young people who struggling with it what telephone look them down you see you hold up yeah yeah only trouble getting fights with the world and fight fight one pillar of fire come and just pack it in the corner there afterwards they come out stunned you want you want to wait wait we [Music] [Applause] when moses with a consciousness of his calling with an awareness from an intellectual conception that he's called for deliverer when he killed a man so you run through life you know possibly each of 40 years he ends up buying his newspapers he didn't want to text know what's up he wanted nothing but all he done he didn't want to hear no news or when god had enough for him which is her tempered wife when he gets flat out enough god sent him on top of the mountain by sending the pillar fine up burning bush i mean god finished with moses moses was done not even your wife could stop him changed man you know so he said abraham said ask where you're going he's down to egypt we're going on four he says to take over he might have risen but he know he's going to take over you know why because he had the word you say who shall i say sent me because they want to know who was telling me the people are ready moses can authorize himself then people beat him and run him out when he said tell him i am saying let me go and say i am that i am no you can't just talk that's here i am sending you and there's no manifestation i am who who's in you again show me the proof so when moses started to drop miracles so they know i am sending him because they know mankind do that even pharaoh thought it was just man doing the thing because favorable customers made me yellow over your business something so they're cutting their camera and they're doing the business and doing the business turn second to too this is a snake contest moses said there was you know did he starting if you forget to see me the meeting let me go to the next round when boys had a peppermint runs after wrongs and flees and flies and frogs and when he started hitting so say take your people take your flock stay take your plagues take everything and go just just get out and god could put such heat upon that demon that devil that was over you that god peppered him so much that he said release it like i go on i go and i gone let you go let your family go let your house go that's what we're talking about man that's staying with the word of god don't give up oh my hallelujah oh glory to god amen oh god how god has said some of the church through their liver pains or they get tremendous sometimes when a church is growing under the persecution of the outside world believing on the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost is just too real to us i want to i don't want no lesser holy ghost you see in the upper room they fulfilled three steps they were justified they were sanctified they received the holy ghost and they were adopted in the upper room when come to us we get four steps little justification where's the signification pentecost the baptismal holy ghost and brethren by the word but once the fullness of the word be restored we are going to go back to three steps why peter yet speak these words oh god yeah yes sons will be in the kingdom and after sons born into the kingdom placed positionally then through their mouth life going to be speaking out from the mouth of sons of god you talk about a genuine typhoid ministry it would be christ in these men christ in the form of an apostle christ in the form of a prophet christ in the form of a pastor christ in the form of a teacher cries in a former evangelist god filled god called man not politicians not message poops but god called man burden for the kingdom he said you will hear from them yesterday they will take over you will hear from the pastor you would hear from the prophet you would hear from evangelists so no group could go open the corner and talk about this bride that is cult you hear what i'm saying no man can take no change aside and say he's not a promise god will call her to the side apart that is that man wife must be that my group no no that's not working you know there's one body and by one spirit we are baptized into one body there's going to be one church which will be the body of christ that's the mystical body of jesus christ and no man could control that no man could have that no man could govern that you could be working in that but you can't control that christ is the head of the body called the church okay the lord i shout let me say again christ is the head of the body called the church not some ministry somewhere christ is the head of the body the cap coming to the pyramid the coming of the headstone oh my you could take a little more you have to tell the truth tonight i didn't get started yet he said when our church is grown and under the persecution of the outside world believing in the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost just as real to us and was a pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born one and positionally born to into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he give into their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gives healing americans so the whole package is included the whole package fifo ministry and the gifts of the spirit isn't that right oh glory to god now what is the land of promise to the new testament believer the promise is there's some adoption the holy spirit for it shall come to pass i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your son and daughter shall prophesy your heart may shall see revision and so on they left egypt was the world did you notice before they get in the promised land skip that night no skip the line all right now there's some questions and answers but all right today the church has come through justification through luther and through signification through the methodist and known to the land now listen to the time of the promise luther wesley and now the time of the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit [Music] no he's not talking about pentecost 1906 he's not talking about that let's continue now watch the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised all to the old testament and new too the promise is behold i send the promise of my father upon you peter said that on the day of pentecost this that that is the promise the promised land here we go is to live in this land of the holy spirit church is out this is the holy spirit now this is not coming to church this is living with your husband living with your wife living with your children living on the street living in when you go to the grocery living in this land of the holy spirit listen that is god's promise for the church is to live here we go in the power of the spirit it's another world i love that the first thing is another world it's another land you have to come out of the condition you've been in to come out and live in this from islam hallelujah so just as the promised land was promised in the old testament to the children of israel which was canaan land we have a promise also which is the land of the holy spirit so what did he said he said means just from eternity for what he says he's standing for some angels he said to gather all the scattered words to tie it back into the word to do what to bring down the holy spirit let me say it again he sent some angels to gather all the scattered word to tie it back into the word to bring down the holy spirit because with the restoration of this word comes a restoration of the spirit because the word and spirit is one and the word was captured through seven ages so we have to bring the scattered word to bring back the fullness of the holy ghost in this hour to produce the ministry of the sons of god but the manifestation of the sons of god when born sons filth and speak and the word is created just like that oh give the lord a shout glory to god and the holy ghost being loosed in the last days because he released the word in the last days so god loosed the holy ghost in the form of bridal promises and when you receive them by their promises you receive the holy ghost in word form oh give the lord a shout you receive the mechanics of the pyramid in you in word form because the secret is the word is in the bride the word tonight is in you the mechanics already in you oh glory to god and the mind of christ is charity the holy spirit elohim the capstone coming upon you to quicken and make it alive oh hallelujah praise god could we give the girl some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord glory it's another world it's another land you have to come with the condition you've been in to come to live in islam and to receive the promise remember you cherish the performance after this the holy spirit upon you afterward that is not looter that is not wesley that is not pentecost that is the person of the holy ghost himself which came in the evening time the problem came to introduce the person of christ because the pentecostal they don't have him oh give the lord a praise offering do you see that now so power is promised when after the holy ghost it's come upon you watch this he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him the damn give you power to become it doesn't mean you're adopted it's power to become its power to climb its power to grow its power to move the ladder of this pyramid or glory to god some little miracle and somehow miracle and your feeling tops among them somewhere you don't get them started that's why the prophet came to term the pentecostal all these tongues and speaking in tongues you know getting started but you're going to be co-placed in a place of trying to be tested to be approved as a son the right kind of a son oh give the lord a shout hallelujah there's gonna be sons placed positionally into our position of power because of the character because of their life [Music] so that is the backdrop of what i wanted to say tonight wanna punch that just keep curtaining no getting started hallelujah jesus is not going to ask me if i was a methodist lutheran baptist he's going to judge me to what i was in my heart that's right that is what he will judge us all by amen so you see after all he shouts amen you have to know what's in your heart because from the abundance of the heart the mouth speak if any heart corrupt corruption come out your mouth if you have evil evil come out your mouth oh you say out of the heart proceed adulteries and fornication all things inside comes out of our manhattan that's why i offer a new heart tonight new spirit [Applause] and his spirit amen hallelujah [Music] now don't think it's just one church we represent all the churches and many of the people that come into the line that is baptist catholic i have never seen one that come but what was healed when they come upon the basis of faith [Music] so it wasn't like catholic not being healed methodist not being healed no no no no no let's continue i wouldn't go on that i have seen people come that were renowned christians and stand there and be told the reason that they couldn't be healed and i see street workers prostitutes people of in fame come off the street and be healed of crippled blindness and everything else sinners no you don't have to be a christian to be healed he's a big one you know [Music] i like that it's true you don't have to be a christian to be healed but you have to be a christian to stay healed because from the bible jesus go and say no more police are worse than come upon you so to keep the healing you had to become a christian but god healed everybody who have faith to receive it they get it so you don't mean an angry god in that way he just let the sun shine that the son of righteousness arises here in his rings [Music] but abraham he's in the prayer line i believe my dear friend my enemy become like a flood god raise the standard against it you read these magazines and things how satan's a rampage god there is no standard don't worry do you believe that he's always on the right side he's always above the enemy all the time do you believe that lady sitting right there yes you had more faith than you thought you had faith is a subconscious thing lady faith is not a mental act it is something that you subconsciously do it people try to look to the intellect for faith when faith doesn't lay in there reasonably is there faith lays in the soul [Music] and i said that's what penicillin is it kills the flu germs but it doesn't patch the cells that are being torn god has to do that so he's the only healer god is the healer and then it's your faith in god and many people have faith subconsciously and doesn't know it you mean you could be sitting here with a whole big bunch of faith tonight i don't even know it yeah yeah because it's at the subconscious level let's continue you're talking about a woman there was a little german woman she got instructions on a little prayer cloth i think he was crippled it says here to call in your friends or your pastor if you can if not one of your neighbors confess all your wrongs and ask god to heal you and place it on you and then believe that was the instruction on the preclude the little german woman it was amazing she put it on an underneath garment like it was instructed she had the neighbors come in and pray she confessed all her wrongs and when she got it on there she put a hand over her heart and said no old man devil you get over me and right up she got and went walking across the floor after being in a wheelchair for 20 some odd years [Music] it is that simple you know there are many times we try to reach out for something for a certain kind of a fate and you don't have to have some kind of super fate to be healed the only thing you have to have is just the faith that you got now you know in the bible the blood was applied to the doors by hyssop and it was ordinary you don't have to have a super fate how did you come here how do you know you're going to leave how can you drive your car how do you move your hand you do it subconsciously because you believe that you can do it that's the way you believe for your healing it's just settled it doesn't take some high education some super duper something it takes common faith in god just believe it like you would if your mother would say to you some get something just believe it like that they took blood ordinary hyssop dip it in blood and pass it on the door he said i will take the stony heart give you a new heart the heart is the dwelling place of the holy spirit i will give you a new spirit i want you to watch the order many people get mixed up here they think they got the holy ghost but they just get a new spirit i'll give you a new heart a new spirit then i'll put my spirit now the new spirit god give you a new spirit and that new spirit god gave you so you could get along with the holy ghost that's good that's good that's good that's good the new spirit is for you to get along with the holy ghost we go without a new spirit you're gonna fight the holy ghost with the old spirit you couldn't get along with your neighbor you couldn't get along with yourself so you know you couldn't get along with god so god gave you a new spirit and many times under enthusiasm if you watch the life that it bears i hope i'm not hurting but i hope i'm uncovering a lot of times you think you have the holy spirit you said i sung i spoke in tongues certainly being that close say it might do all that but that is no spirit yet the holy spirit bears record of jesus christ he give you a new heart give your new spirit then he puts his spirit his spirit in you it's like you don't have to go around pretending you're a christian man the new spirit brings new life the holy spirit in your new heart your new heart new spirit and the holy spirit goes right in the center of your new spirit oh glory and your new spirit goes in the center of your new heart new hack in your new act new spirit in your new spirit his spirit that's the main spring and when you receive the holy spirit it goes into the middle of the dispens dispositions of yours you say i quit drinking i quit smoking i feel like i live in a person oops wait a minute you just got a new spirit but the holy spirit comes in the middle of that spirit and when he come he make every main motion every intellectual everything agreeing right into this middle of the wheel god says if the days are miracles if jesus is the same yesterday forever the holy ghost will be a record and say amen oh do you believe that and when you have the little temper fits and you fly out and your taillights and your presser light and your jump fences and you're so selfish with your organization and you're so now reminded you can only hear you cannot hear another minister you mean that here boy yeah yeah yeah yeah let me read it again when you're so selfish with your organization that you're so narrow-minded you couldn't hear another minister just remember the holy spirit isn't ticking inside of you so anytime somebody looking to a man looking at it only my embarrassment here they messed up big time because your spirit holy spirit and you want to hear the word oh glory to god so the holy spirit will make every movement like christ it will make you christ-like the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith all those things are whole controlled by the holy spirit so you can't say we don't know what's going on but you and this person a long time long time it is ought to grudge you had to drop it you have to forgive and hug the person and move on yes yes you have to do that you have to love you have to love enemies you have to look god has a blessing with enemies to love let me say that again god bless you with enemies that you could love i hear teaching that jesus teach that love your enemies if all you have christian believers we are no enemy challenge did their enemy come in your feeling more spiritual than everybody else because they're not in your group or not in your circle or not in your love your enemies mean just that so that means you ain't supposed to fight with nobody our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that a shindig will bring that to you music or something i think so could be somebody get to tap in the foot just like the music in church i shouldn't think we'll do better than you well here what are you saying here you say enough but the holy spirit brings you into operation or in control of god that you walk in peace and in love and joy with long suffering and gentleness you see it isn't something you do it is something the holy spirit does in you remember you could stop smoking a subject and that what you stopped doing but when you get the operation of god that takes it out that's different because if you can stop everything you don't need holy spirit you just need to be you need to be the stopper you stop cutting in here you stop smoking you stop drinking you stop lying you stop thinking in the smaller wine on the side and the fun things and stuff all other stuff it's up high many scriptures here oh why didn't good for you buddy or something and have a drinking anointing underneath that see devil deceive receive you stop all of that see so therefore you'll recognize this god's operation in your life then you want more of him you worship him you're grateful to him praise god amen so what you see it is no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's here we go it's a subconscious movement of the holy spirit yeah but i wish i could shout the praises of god around the world to that he said you wish he could shout the prisoner a little more again there are many times we have put emphasis too much on i think on one season thing we put too much emphasis on emotions um because a group of years here tonight i feel very much at home in this puppet i'm very welcome and i know i love you and that's why i say those things we have put too much emphasis on our emotions perhaps maybe we feel as long as we are shouting and praising the lord that's fine i think that's good you say but in this philadelphian church just receive me as god's servant let me you you would like to know what i think is the greatest need of the church today what i think where i think is lacking is no soul travail the people are not broke up enough there is no burden seemingly you give me someone that's so tall about lost souls they just cry wanting a revival so bad they could hardly eat people are so selfish they wouldn't even testify the people about the lord they wouldn't invite somebody to service as far as they can send this save and i said it's like the hell everybody go to hell there's no travel of soul but when you're broken right now i have my sons and grandchildren and so on like that and i as as a grandparent would want the children to be filled with the holy ghost be granted to be filled with the holy ghost i have to pray for them i have to be concerned about them i just say well you know because they are my children or grandchildren and take it for no no no i have to believe god that god will do something special for them because what what what they need i can't give them god alone could give them so then you have to pray with a burden and and say same thing with the church if i could have give it to you guilty already wha why hold him about four uh every service i come holding back i don't want it i share i'm feeling selfish no the bible said the kingdom is preached and heavy man [Music] let's continue every man uh-huh i thought the preacher bringing bring and bring in bringing because he said no minister could bring a revival we have for 45 years and we're ready rival he said the people have to bring it so i always understood the vision have to be transferred to the people and when you see the vision nobody could stop you no pass it could stop you i'm worshiping no nobody can stop you from approaching your god [Music] like we say the president of america or even prime minister trailer their children when the children come they'd rather wait uh waiting or eating my child everywhere you know that a man child i come and see daddy that opening door oh your son is here to you your daughter's here to you so when you in your condition go to the father angels had to say like a son come and look at baxter as everybody coming see life she life terrible but she's coming there's you're right there's the father you're going to he can be president of the country he could be the ceo he could be whatever he is he could be not meeting he said daddy i want to talk to you sign a meeting this is an emergency he said okay he will stop the meeting because you have that son that your daughter so that was having us that's almost shut down for one sinner [Applause] when i say not come to repentantly hold him rejoicing they say oh they hear that look she's repenting only hear that look at repenting he will leave the 90 and nine to go after one that's heaven's behavior and said when the last name coming how do you not know your neighbor is not the last one door is shut everything is fixed after that you have to keep reaching out for christ up today i got an article i was sharing my wife they were seeing people they see they had some experiment with thousands of old people over 60 those who give money and those who give service and he said the people that give service to others live longer than those who just give money those are helping each helping this one and they go into this home helping this one help in other words the joy of being selfless the joy of serving the joy of doing this extending life than just passing the books yesterday science community what brought them to life is living for others so when you as you you yourself and myself and i you know what's going on there your life's shortening don't let the gospel i just see it all right let's go you can say a little more tonight let me stretch a little bit now just a little bit if you notice the subconscious is where you live that is where you yourself live and that's the reason it's hard for them to have feet they say yes i could fit but down here some literally it's not for you you hear any words so you can go free yeah i know i know i know but don't you say no you can't go free because you have a conscience i never subconscious you're conscious hearing the word and your conscious want to agree with the word your conscience want to receive the word you can't just want to agree and work with the word but you're subconsciously in something else but you don't know what going through watch that's it friends oh just keep doing it many times in the meeting i noticed in the meeting watching these tips they will come back to the lines for the of this interment the people will be sitting there look like they are million miles away they don't think they're not even thinking about healing it's not their intellect is their subconscious working then he said your subconscious is your soul body spirit soul and that is why when somebody dies their human spirit breaks up and that human spirit is where you have cxe gc doctor degree ceo all your position your nice house your nice car all that's inside that spirit here when that breaks up now this soul comes up what you really are at the subconscious level the subconscious is really you the subconscious is really where the heart is at as a man think in his heart or his subconscious who is he see if you think you can't make it you can't if you think you could make it you could make it because that's in your heart hallelujah and caleb said i brought wood as it was in my heart so those other ministers couldn't deceive him because he had an awareness and a consciousness of the promise of god that was more powerful of any enemy any giant david also had the same thing he never met goliath before he shall cut your head off even without a sword he was so convinced because he was operating at the subconscious level on the subconscious level already no victory oh glory to god i just love it tonight david no one stone will do but you take up five and he ran to me goliath just won he needs it nobody take up five but he ran to me goliath he was operating on the subconscious level we get into something oh glory to god hallelujah brother branham says um no no not long ago to show a perfect god word is the bible says a man taken in his heart is that right the old time infidel users say no isn't that crazy there is no mental faculties in a manner little pump that bloods blood but last year he said the big hairline science found this listen to this as found in the human heart there's a little compartment that doesn't even have blood cells in it it isn't in the animal it's only in the human it's the occupant of the soul so when a man does think from his heart god was right oh glory to god so therefore there has become a consciousness i'm gonna be healed i'm gonna be delivered tonight is my night [Music] it is amazing and this is subconscious i i decided to take a walk from where i lived arima to go up you know instead of driving and sit down walk think about 20 minutes and i'm walking i'm walking i want to walk up and i want to walk back down so i walk up into the bank come back down when i started coming right inside the fall i hadn't seen the rains on a wonderful field to complete to go back to walk back as rain falling and reaching a taxi stand where i could take attacks and go home i had a choice take attacks and go home or keep walking i keep walking i ain't going like you and after i pass like 80m around there not knowing i said look at that now boy what if i jump in that car i break my whole spirit i want to do this thing because my body need it i feel good i say look at that in life sometimes the choices you make i had a choice the taxi sun is there rain is falling wasn't falling hard but there's a choice i could come heavy something i mean come over here you know you'll come here you know rain drizzling it'll come heavier you know but i forget that i decide i want to walk i gonna keep on walking and i just walk straight through that you know what doing that is the level of the subconscious at work there if you're consciously watching the rain oh god ring go forward whether you had umbrella open up and whatnot i am not i'm walking many times that happen you go past your consciousness it's not what your eyes see it's what you deserve from what your eye sees not what you hear is what you deserve are we talking about delilah what samson didn't see is how the devil usually like you know she nice she good she look pretty everything else here you know and she's a nice person of good intention but the demon behind she had no good intention he intend to strip samson and the demon seed is a channel he could use so keep on fellowship and keep on going he will cut your head off don't be fooling a word flick like i don't know like oil but you lead into hell okay so watch so right all right so we're almost done thank you lord again i think we're almost done no tomorrow night you do you come and listen a while because you want to take our time and lay that word out so close that the devil won't even have a little speck of room to move and when you let your faith run to its end till hear this you begin to believe and let your subconscious go to acting then the fate of god will back it up so you come you let your feet run out until you come to the place where you begin to believe like i love the words he used he said when abram came to the fullness of believing so there are different degrees of believing you come into the fullness of belief and this promise is yours that when you understand you're not a serpent seed you're not a devil child then you are son your daughter and you cannot be denied even the backstage cannot be denied even if you're full you cannot be denied you have to understand it by revelation so when you say father coming home you're coming home you know because you know who your father is because your faith won't do too much he said your subconscious has to move in the direction your faith is moving and then god move faith moves behind him and confirms it the reason of a lie detector is because man wasn't made a lie so when they put the instrument on you and ask your question and what not on your and muslims have to do what kind of thing so they know like because your body wasn't made to lie why because it's picking up it at the level of your subconscious here this one i'll just hit the highlights here now that subconscious is where faith lies so then you can see different intellectual faith and spirit faith hallelujah somebody being messaged and the only under intellectual but the subconscious is where the real faith lies oh my i have to cut it down now my lord hallelujah i want to ask you was there many times that you people in here many of you have seen times where you just know something's going to happen it looked like it was impossible for it to but you just know it was going to happen did you ever have that that is faith that is a conscious working when you go past your own feelings and explanation you know you're going to work out oh hallelujah it settles you oh glory to god hallelujah i am done play something for me hallelujah if you want to receive the holy ghost let me tell you something my dear sister i don't remember them either he said he said now what must i do for my family use the same fate that you're using for yourself for your family commit them to the lord believe with all your heart that you're going to be saved don't let it come down from your natural thinking here let it jump down read on inside your subconscious you have a lot of stuff about getting in harmony with god and not even you having the holy ghost but the holy ghost having you and you surrender into the spirit it takes us to another level of the consciousness of god and the awareness of his presence around your life he promises and his angels are wrong you can come around you those
