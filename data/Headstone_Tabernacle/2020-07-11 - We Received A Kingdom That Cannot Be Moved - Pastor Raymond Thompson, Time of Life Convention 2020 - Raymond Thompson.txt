and such trusty have we through Christ to God one is talking about the trust we have through Christ God one not that we are sufficient of ourselves and I that is not by our power we are not sufficient in ourselves to think anything as of ourselves this has nothing to do with answers the sufficiency is not ourselves we are not sufficient in ourselves not not to think us of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God then look at verse 6 who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the Spirit gives life and the good

Chema's law recall where we have thorough this week honest applied Odessa and wash us from every sin in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen now on this where the theme on this way to theme the time of life has to do with the vindication of the promise that God has given us through Malik Alpha from 1953 up to 1965 Malakai first message was a message of promises the salmon Thunder message is a message of promises many promises he left on the tapes and the books for the bride and he told us that every promise in the Bible every promise in the Bible belongs to us every line in the Bible belongs to us every verse in the Bible belongs to us every chapter in the Bible belongs to us every every line every verse every chapter every blessing every every promise in the Bible belongs to us but now this is just a letter form we have the promises in letter form through Malachi 4 1953 to 1965 through his his 7 Thunder message he brought to our God brought us all these promises but now for the sponsors to be manifested for this promises to be come alive for this promises to be actualized for this promises to be fulfilled for this process to put on fresh and walk in Amira's for this promises to become material we need the Spirit of God as he has told us here because these promises are in a word phone in a letter phone but verse chapter 3 verse 5 disease not that we are sufficiently or give us hope and such trusts have we through Christ to God one not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the speed for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life so now we have all these promises in later phone any written form on that tips and spoken or body books manner promises statue of the perfect man alone he tellus is we see the promises he gave us there he said number one we sure we shall be who shall be an affliction of Jesus Christ before the rapture takes place number two in that message city of the perfect man he says we shall be not only the reflection of Jesus Christ but the number two he says we shall be a powerhouse and then he goes on to say and he says we shall be a living monument of the Living God and living movie Idol on earth a monument is always used to remind the people of some important person who is not visible that's why they put monuments in different cities of the world about great men like Churchill great men like King Nelson Mandela but men like samurai Michelle a few years about five years ago I was in Mozambique and I found in every biggest city they had they had monuments of Samara Michelle the man that lady named in the walk a chemist the Portuguese in order for Mozambique to attain its independence so in order to remain to remind him you know to remind the name of someone else Michelle who died in a plane crash they had to put monuments everywhere but now God also in the stretch of the perfect man he says the bride who will be a living monument of the Living God which unmeaning says we shall be a living item and living I know of God on earth and then he says we shall be a powerhouse who shall be any fraction of Jesus Christ comedies have great promises in the pond attempts and in the spoken white book they are in later phone and then he goes on to say we shall be a living temple of the Living God God and which God dwells through which God walks through which God speaks through which gold wax we shall be a living temple of the Living God through in which God dwells in which God speaks in the mythical works let's submit a name of the Lord and then he goes on and says we shall be a living we shall be a manifestation in one mess extent of the perfect man it brings all this function we shall be a manifestation of the Living Word of the Living God then when we go to the seven churches blessed be the name of the Lord in the center changes back to 50 he says we shall be in God we shall be in Gordie's he stayed on earth which shall be the one taking his place on earth then peg to 439 and 240 he says we are the elect and wish we shall be the ones that truly manifest the Lord on earth but these are own promises this is all in the letter firm on that tapes and spoken word ebooks in order for them to become material in order for these promises to be manifested in order for this process to be vindicated to be actualized to be materialized to come to come to pass we made it a spirit and the Spirit is the type of life they dynamics the quickening power to live them that word to quicken that word to give life to that Waja to those promises so negative 3/14 Sancho Genesis talks about the bride as the Enoch he talks about the bride of the city as the ones that will truly the one who as the ones that would truly manifest the Lord the private video who do not only be the elect of this day but don't be the ones that truly manifested the Lord can you believe that the bride will be the one that truly manifested a lot in these closing hours from now to the rapture in between there we have to manifest the launch to the world the world has to come to a realization that if there is God God is no way is he's with us and then he calls on to say Oh blessed be the name of the Lord it goes on to say we shall be and goes up to say that we shall be his body we shall revisit boys and we shall perform his works we shall be his body we shall perform his OSB we shall be his body we shall be his divorce we shall perform his works and in the same some interchanges and the penguin chat egg he says we shall be a super church a super race PEGI 3 4 again he says that we shall be we are we are we are another people he speaks about us as another people in the land who under their messenger shall be the final voice to the final a therefore my brother my sister but it detects the sphere these promises this is the mechanics this promises and the seed the seed 1 the mechanics what will mean is the dynamics and the coming of the dynamics that is the time of life to quicken those promises to live in those promises to make those promises and life to give those promises life in order to manifest so brana's the Spirit is given to quicken the word may the Lord bless you mightily thank you thank you god bless you and they may we have a wonderful

that need encouragement may they be encouraged Lord we pray the Holy Spirit every sway Lord as I commit myself into your hands father in me when we come to the end of the service we won't forget to give you all the honor the praise in the glory for we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen so are we staying in I have three portions of scripture to read Genesis 18 12 to 14 first Thessalonians 5 1 to 5 Hebrews 12 25 to 28 so I'll start with Genesis 18 and we read from verse 12 and we all know the story this was when Abram was sitting with his back to the tent and when he discerned therefore Sarah loved within yourself saying after him works all shall I have pleasure my lord being old also in the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh say inshallah I of a surety pay a child which I'm old verse 14 is anything too hard for my lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life in Sarah shall have a son amen then we go to Thessalonians chapter 5 and we read from verse 5 Thessalonians [Music] but of the times and of the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly there the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but he brethren are not in darkness there this day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not over the night know of darkness many Bruce chapter 12 and we read from verse 25 see that it refused not him that speaketh if he they if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also even in this word yet once signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of those things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain this is my title wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear make order a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so I'd like to take a title tonight so I just remove my jacket as I take it title tonight we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved and I got a subject tonight you got to know the hour that we are living in and then I have a subject is anything too hard for the Lord in the time of life and I trust that the message will be a blessing to you so I've got a POTUS to open up and I'm gonna read quite a few quotes so I trust it you will stay with me and then God that God will bless you he says yeah and unbelief does not in the God a very short quote he says in the last days what is it gonna take it's gonna take a stand to take a stand is a scriptural train Church right on the line so that's what it's gonna take for the church to be stayin in this last days is a scriptural trained church train so listen to that then it says here in modern events made clear by prophecy he says this word and is posi pray Mia he says and father as we open this word now speak to us directly out of this word that we might know the hour that we are living in he says if we know the are we loving in then we can prepare for that hour but if we go in blindly not knowing what away then we don't know how to prepare so father we pray that you'll let us see the ark there and the door open and the Machine colic and the message calling us in granted through Jesus Christ's name Amen that's what he says so he says here now Lord how can we prepare we need to know how show us God he says if we do it we're gonna do it blindly not known way to go but show us the hour and that is my point and just just to if read John 17 verse 1 Jesus was speaking and he was princes his father the hour has come now to me Jesus narrowed it down to the hour and what's so important friends if you see we know our dispensation we know our age we live in him but we got to know the hour in the agent in the dispensation how far are we up in the hour Jesus says my hours come he never spoke there before but when he knew the time was drawing eyes his father that always come and friends I want to say we have narrowed it down God is narrowed it down to the hour that has come he says here in modern events made clear by prophecy it says and you can be ever so sincere but until you know what you are doing you are fighting the air come back into the Word of God and get lined up then you know like a soldier he don't know what to do until he gets orders to do it we must be Christian soldiers and get orders from the Bible for the hour this is a prophet narrows it down to the hour now not the charge of yesterday the charge the day before but the charge for today he says we got to know the charge for today not the one of yesterday not one of before but the charge of the very hour find out that our a comes again that we live in in these modern events is helping by so swiftly and one day we're gonna find out that we are left behind without nothing and be caught sealed in the with the mark of the beast before we even know it so he says these modern events is slipping by so fast that he says one day we're gonna find out who I left behind because we didn't take note of the events that is happening so I say again let's zero in on the hour that we are living in he says here and with with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that spin almost every one of them must be fulfilled in its age hallelujah he says and you look at God's Bible and see what age we living in we're not living in the Methodist age all the Baptist age we're living in the pride age hallelujah brothers can we say that again we living in the pride age the calling the bringing back to God through the channel he promised to bring it back in he promised to do it so God is calling us out into the pride age we're not in the Methodist age we're not even in the latest in church age between the pride age and it says here again in mid-morning events made clear by proxy this Bible foretells the prophecy what day that we live in in and what time we live in in what kind of events watch what he says what kind of events ought to be taking place it foretells it exactly to the letter and it's not miss one age all the time not one time has it ever must it won't for we are predestinated to see it those that are predestinated to see it will see it so brother sister is come exactly right down to where the Bible says that every event that's gotta take place it's gonna happen right to the letter and not one time as it must and he says those that are predestinated to see it they are gonna see and I wanna encourage you and tell you you're not gonna miss it God called you God chose you God predestinated you to see the hour that we are living in hallelujah can we give him a shout of praise hallelujah even if you wanna clap your hands in the room wherever you just do something but give him praise hallelujah what is it he says the predestinated is is for its predestinate receipt will see it is the word joining were the word it can't do nothing else we know it and that's the day we are so in the season where the whole world has changed we have come he says we have not come this way before so we must stay behind the arc that's what I said with with like opening greeting friends the whole world has changed this whole virus has changed the world they call it covert 19 it's changed the world it's brought the world to a stain store so we didn't come this way before so the only way for the believer is to check it in the word and he must stay behind the word in order to come out right stay behind the word hallelujah stay behind the arc now the Bible says and God provided way and I know you know the scutes but I'm reading it for a purpose to show you the hours that we are living in and many times we overlook it because provided way of healing but look friends the time is coming that when there is rising up a church if we can't have faith for divine healing how are we gonna have faith for the rapture so you he says if we don't have he says we've got to move out I like this friends we've got to get out of this old slow Church condition that we in step out launched out cut the Soul lines and get get into somewhere where you are loose when you lose all senses of fear and doubt out there where all things are possible hallelujah promises are just as free as it can be you got your sails set towards heaven and nothing can stir you no way you gone that way that's all nothing can harm you so we got to come to a place where we cut the show lines we are free from the things of the world anything that ties us down cut the show lines cut the lines so that we are free he says and what happens set your sail what's heaven and nothing can stir you once you got your eyes on heaven your goal your focus brother sister nothing can stop you hallelujah says nothing can harm you now that's the kind of church is going to be one of these days according to the Bible so that must come brother sister and he says listen with the angel poured out his wrath diseases broke out and men even rotted in the flesh where they were staining the fowls of the air came down each of these shoulders eat the flesh of chief captains great men presidents warriors the

got the mark was on how much kind of teachers have we got to be present to get the church in in order to be in that condition where the immune says where they get them in that condition immune he brings the condition again so there's a certain condition believers as to to that place within the condition that the enemy can't touch them brother and sister we not immune from sickness we not immune from disease one of the blem says the enemy is one touch and that's still the flesh but the soul that's in our hearts he cannot touch brother we are too full being one to suffer want to have sickness one to die won't we have sorrow but is another part that the enemy cannot touch and that's the soul that's in that's a seed that's of God that's in your soul so you have a right to rejoice you have a right to be happy you have a right to praise God Alleluia he says here in adoption how're you gonna do it stand store God is wanting to place his church the sons and daughters of God God let me love to see it is my prey so close to like I just I can feel it with my hands almost he wanted to love to see it he says look like it's right there that's what I've longed to see the Prophet longed to see what you and I have seen he says I I just wanted to I long to see it waiting for the time when you walk down the street and there lays a crippled Lane there from his mother's womb and you will say survey and gold have I none o waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God brother there's got to come a time when the sons of God is going to be manifested when there be a coupling

they'll stop diseases hallelujah he says you think cancer something the Bible said has come in a time when man will rot in the flesh he a comes again and the Buzz's will eat of the carcasses before they even die cancers a toothache - what is coming but remember the horrible thing was forbidden in that to touch those who had the seal of God yet it comes again that plague was forbidden to strike anyone that had the seal of God that's what we are striving for now to get in and be positionally placed hallelujah into the kingdom of God before this horrible plague strike so we got to strive we gotta press we gotta fight we gotta enter we gotta put everything in Lord positionally place me get me in that condition when I become immune and this place cannot strike me hallelujah the dispensation of time the fullness of time my so he goes on here the uncommon stones he says I'm told in the Bible that there would be a time come for those who are not in this wonderful sunlight watch that the fowls of the air so now he's bringing a difference and we read the scripture in Ephesians we are not children of darkness we're children of light yeah a brother in says I am told in the Bible they would come a time for those who are not in this wonderful sunlight that the Falls of the air will eat of the flesh of them there the Jesus on the road that the doctors would never be able to stop it's the plagues of God and and right now scientists are looking doctors everyone is looking to find a remedy a cure for this covert 19 whatever they call it and and nothing is helping all across the world and brother Branham says here he says here that he says and that the doctors will never be able to stop it it's the place of God he says yeah then Jesus came diseases are happening and everything is taking place well we don't know what to expect the doctors don't know what to call the disease so they see saying they say it's a virus what is a virus also doctor it's something that he doesn't know nothing about he just says it's a virus that's all they is he says now what's this words there's little old bug demons that's flying now you look at the scar on the violence it's fine right in the air yeah brother branham save it and I mean this was what he did he bridges 57 already he preaches he says these are little old bugs demons so this covert 19 is nothing else but demons the scientists can't find the remedy they don't even know what it is they can't put it down and every time they don't think they have it it breaks into something else and promises is demons fine that man never heard of before no one heard of this before everything is on the move everything we trying to curb it were the nets of things but when we try to do this it breaks out into something else isn't that what is happening actually we can almost say this day this prophecy is fulfilled hallelujah he says you give a man penicillin for this and set him up something else and you give him this he says you just will you just all out of the way of out of the way God is a way we might as well get into it that is the baptism of the holy spirit trying everything it won't help you all the medicine all the scientists all the doctors together he says you might as well just come God's Way that's the Lord Jesus Christ tonight hallelujah he says in the same book we see the newspapers the oncoming storms why you go home tonight do me a favor don't go to bed till you have read revelations 8 chapter you see the oncoming place the storms that hit the earth and the thunders and lightnings are going to shake heaven wars are going to pass over the nation men will rot in the flesh he is it again diseases will strike them doctors knows nothing about but remember hallelujah here it comes again before that took place there was a saline angel that went for brother and death and the death angels and the place was commissioned by God hallelujah don't come near any of those that has a seal of God and a forehead the seal of God is what the baptism of the Holy Spirit don't come near those that has the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's your answer tonight that's your answer you looking for people are panicking people are committing suicide people are under depression people is a spirit of fear but I'm yet to tell you tonight there's only one answer get the seal of God which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit and your life will never be the same again and those angels are commissioned by God not to come near you and he says what is the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption no matter how hard the ark rocks speaking of Noah's Ark no matter how many times the lightning flash and struck close to it ten thousand cellphone on the right and thousand on your left but it will not come now you why because you are predestinated right in the time of this plague right in the time of all this happening nothing will shake you it might hit your body but it can eat your soul brother those bodies are not redeemed yet but our souls are redeemed but so your flesh might be sick or your flesh might take a knock but your soul that belongs to God then the enemy cannot touch and that's what we are praising God for tonight hallelujah praise God he says yeah I read of a pale horse rider going out which is called death and hell followed him a black horse rider with a balance in his hand and a measure of wheat for a penny two measures of barley for a penny but don't here it comes again come near the wine in the oil why is the gain wine in the oil white wine speaks of stimulation of Revelation hallelujah his church is built upon Revelation and the oil speaks of the Holy Ghost the bærum don't come near the brother so satan better leave his hands all of them he better leave his hands off you are you're a child of God I hear the Bible God on coming judgments where sickness and troubles and disaster will strike the nation's every nation will break to pieces I read that in the Bible hallelujah my now listen to the spoke friends this was preaching accepting God's provide away at the end now I want you to listen to this code and see brother Branham didn't see this day he says and so some of them said well now if the plague force will just go into hospital if the plague happens to fall you know what we'll do we'll get dr. Jones and you'll know how to take care of it it didn't work yet they were smart well if the plague falls will just go down beneath the ground in a cave and shut the door down that doesn't work a bit of good well we'll stay in the house and put on a mask my is there a mosque nearby put on a mask we'll stay in the house put on a mask over our face and put some disinfectant on it he didn't do a bit of good hallelujah this is a quote here that brother Branham says they put on masks the whole world is wearing masks the whole world is walking with sanitizers and the prophecies in 1964 it's not gonna work these brother branham's see this day 2020 yeah we are living it we see any brother it's not working the doctors don't have an answer why he says God made a provided way hallelujah and it was what the blood of Jesus Christ oh there's the provided way today brother sister coming to Jesus accept him as your Savior he says the only place he says here God made a provided way and that was the blood God provided it as simple as it is seemed it takes the blood of a lamb to sprinkle on the door and yet God says he says yeah and in that way he honored it and all out from the blood died the firstborn and that's Exodus chapter 12 verse 13 when Israel slew lamb in there to apply the blood what was it that was God's provided way to protect them from the plague they had the token which was an assurance that they had nothing to worry about no matter how many plates talk whatever else says they were sealed away hallelujah and Israel coming out of Egypt as I said of humans goods a type of the bride coming out of the church when Moses begin his ministry Israel gathered together in one place in Goshen and begin to play because they note that the hour was at the end works he comes back to the hour comes right back to the hour and says because they knew the hour was at hand you see they were 400 years in captivity in Egypt but they knew there was coming a time they're gonna leave so it came down to the hour and write that our God required the token and that's when they were safe brother I want to say again we've come down to the hour the only thing is gonna save us is the token let's stay under the blood hallelujah and brother member cezzah all those who are identified in Christ by the token well God take listen well God take with him when he comes so you need the token when he comes he's coming for the Holy Spirit and he says all those that has the Holy Spirit will leave with him my isn't that beautiful and he says today that token is the Holy Spirit that we've been pardoned the case is closed and every woman and man that's truly received the best of the Holy Ghost and has been tried he is identified with his attorney with his church with his sacrifice with a token and he holds it as a possession to show that the troop is paid to glory hallelujah can you say Amen can we give the Lord a hand of praise hallelujah your price has been paid hallelujah by the token Amen he says here and then he says he will only recognize the token that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive he brother he says and God says yeah look any person outside of the token God was not responsible and God is not responsible for any person big or small popular unpopular rich or poor bond or free male or female he is not responsible for anybody that's from under the token the Covenant he is not responsible so the only way for yourself today is to come under the token the blood and that's where you'll be safe come back under from under the blood God is not responsible for anybody amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah isn't God wonderful don't you love him amen he says that he says signs of his coming should through every member of Christ into desperation now about our souls about a well for welfare Hereafter well what are we gonna amount to if we gain the whole world what are we what are we living for what do we work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for to live what are you living for to die and you are not fit to live not until you fought to die so friends nothing of this world can pacify we see it falling apart all the money the government sees fail economies is failure nothing has can save you I help you keep you but the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah the days that we live in him should cause the church to go completely into desperation I believe it ought to throw the entire congregation not just the past the Deacons but the entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough we went to church long enough they even closed church so it's not even church anymore but we went to church long enough we got to do something he says church pinch your conscience get desperate or perish that's the only thing we can do now nothing is going to help us or money Oh our bank balances our buildings our NGO anything it's failing friends but there's one thing that can't fail one thing that's ever lasting and that is Jesus Christ once you ever mean your life is there for eternity hallelujah praise the name of the Lord

Branham saying everything is shaken we are the end of all things but yes my title we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved steadfast unmovable always abounding in the mercies of God he says oh I love that I'm so glad tonight to be a Christian I don't know what I would have done if I was in a Christian I'd probably be a suicide case if I was in the Christian look at the Prophet he knew that these times are going to be so bad people will take their lives they don't know what to do friends people are attacking themselves off buildings he says but listen man we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved unshakable unmovable always abounding in the mercies of God he says I don't know what I would have done if I was in a Christian and the same with you if you weren't a Christian man what would you have done he said he would have been a suicide case but thank God we have an anchor that holds within the veil hallelujah blessed be the name of Lord see it's coming as close as it is then it

my voice with these voice run for your life run to Christ get desperate don't give up don't become disillusioned but still lift up those the Bible says left of those feeble knees those weak arms that hang now lift it up please God they were you standing in your room just stand on your feet praise Him and give Him praise why hallelujah he says there's a king of thieves come and the Bible Syria we have no continual City but we seek one that is to come and God has given us the kingdom that cannot be moved my this one is in uncertain sound everything on earth is movable shaking shake over is falling everything is the king everything loving Easter is in a dying world everything is dying trees are dying class she's dying flowers are dying cities are dying the world is dying you dying everything is then I'm dying everything is dying he says there are certain raisin assets and stuff that's in the air listen that chemicals in the air what's he doing he says that's the thing that's

heartaches no pain no sorrow why it's a kingdom it's eternal in the heavens yeah is no continuous city hallelujah he shook Mount Sinai one time but they come and shaken again that he wouldn't only shake Mount Sinai but he'll shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of the scripture we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved hallelujah everything that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake listen out to this quote heavens will shake the earth will pass away but the word shall never pass away the word of Almighty God will never pass away the spoken word that the Prophet brought will never pass away brother heavens and earth will pass away he says here ever then earth will pass away but the Word of God will never pass away for upon this rock I'll build my church his church is built upon this rock and the gates of hell will never prevail against it everything that can be shook won't be shaken was it so he already said governments are shaking the world is shaking he says everything that can be shook will be shaken but what's the difference now we receive a kingdom which cannot reach is the word of God himself and God is his word now the next words he don't shake himself hallelujah so if God is in you is the word he's gonna shake heaven he's gonna shake earth but the Word of God can't be shaken and in the Word of God is in you God can't shake himself brother so nothing can touch you nothing can harm you God can't shake himself amen oh my but we receive a kingdom that's unmoved its unshakable so today you can walk with your head I put back your shoulders yo you got the Word of God in you God is gonna shake the whole world is already doing it but you as a son and a daughter of God predestinated by God cannot be shaken why because the word in you and God cannot shake himself you say brother Eamonn where do you get it we can look at rape she asked for the true token and she hung it out of a wall and that day when the Death Angel came through the land and while the walls were stumbling she had a whole home in there brother and brother as his could look out of this window and see that walls crumbling and falling and homes falling and she looked the side homes and houses are falling but her house - brother you know why she had the token God couldn't shake himself hallelujah and I'm yet to save you have the token God cannot shake you brother because the token is God himself he's the word and he cannot be moved so I say again today get under the blood get into Jesus Christ receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and say God for me with your spirit because God cannot shake himself her house stood out of all the homes of Jericho house was the only a house they stood why because she had the token there hallelujah so if you have the babson the Holy Spirit God cannot shake himself the kingdom of God is in you hallelujah yeah brother sister if you haven't got the best of the Holy Ghost this morning running to the kingdom of God as quick as you can the same time is on the enemy has come in like a flood he's raising a standard against it the trauma said the church is going home just as certain as anything you haven't got always to wait friend you haven't got always time to wait you better come in now you better make it today that's right while today's today make it now so in other words when you hear this message don't put it off for another day he says today when you hear my voice make it today and I'm saying today if you hear me preaching this message make it today see God go on your knees get your family together pray with him and say Lord today as a family we shall reign in our lives and we claim the batsman the Holy Spirit we claim our unsaved children we came and say mother and father we claim those that are not under the blood Lord bring them under the blood hallelujah the church is going home and I haven't got all the time make it today hallelujah he says yeah Jesus he says he said the kingdom of God will be within you so therefore the legions and the pose and the backing of the Angels hallelujah is in you this morning so you not just loaned allegiance he says angels are encamped round about you they come with their tents you not alone in this battle you have angels with you it says here this morning by the deity of Christ by the baps of the Holy Spirit who are you this morning who is Christ Jesus he is in you as much as you will let him be he is pressing trying to get into you to move in to you today so as much as you think you want it Christ wants to get into you more than what you want him friend so let's give you my hand appraised first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power hallelujah the kingdom of God is in word me the king of God is the word made power what is the kingdom of God it is within you the kingdom is you is in you and when the word comes in there what does the word begin it turns itself into power making it say exactly what it said so the kingdom comes in to you the word and what does it do it turns itself into power so brother you not just walk in there he says the kingdom of God is not in word only but it is in power so when the word comes in power comes in you and that word in you turns itself into power and you're gonna see later when we strike Abram when the word came with him it turned that word that was enemy into power the word in you then that's why the Bible says the raptures already in you adoption is already in you that's the word of God it's gonna turn itself into power and Wonder you be adopted one day you be raptured wonder you be changed you'll be healed the word in you turns itself into power hallelujah Oh beautiful easy brother oh yeah I believe she's ready to strike that final climate yonder to bring forth afraid a tour wraps of the church into glory and she's laying in the messages we're really at the end time now listen what he says we talked about it and everything but the thing is moved upon us now so in other words we spoke about these times coming preachers will remember they preached about it you can play back tapes that you preached way back so many years he says we talked about it and everything but the thing is moved upon us we can see now with us virus with us cover 19 we can see it's moved upon us now the thing we spoke about it now it's time for manifestation now God must come on the scene you know friends to have apostolic times we must have apostolic conditions we must have episodic times so I believe this God allowed it to happen to get the brides attention so that we can become more desperate more sincere more make our calling and election sure to make sure that we are in the faith and I believe he says here that this thing has moved upon us now here we are the end time the red lights down fresh coming of the Lord is at hand the endtime message should meet endtime conditions so no matter what state the world comes or gets into the endtime message must meet endtime conditions so he said agreement is so bad I don't know what to know the message will meet the endtime conditions no matter how frothy becomes it raises a standard all the time and you raise with the standard hallelujah he says yeah we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we are living in and after years promises we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the conference that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need so this message will meet the need of the hour and I believe we have the standard with us hallelujah now I'm gonna strike my final my inspiration God made an unconditional covenant with Abram and he told him you're gonna have that baby now watch friends I don't know go to all the scriptures and I'm sure that other ministers will be doing that so I'm just gonna eat it and he may it says after he made the promise to Abram he says every morning Abram he believed God so much that when he woke up in the morning he said when he shook his hair I said Sarah how do you feel this morning there was this ain't nothing honey he says April say praise God we're gonna have that baby brother Abram the Bible says staggered not through unbelief but was strong in faith giving praise to God there's a difference of having faith you can have faith but its weak faith when the Bible says Abram was strong in faith now I'm speaking of strong faith that even if it didn't happen you still ain't God praise God I'm we gonna have that baby you might be sick praise God I'm gonna be healed tomorrow morning you wake up which so there I am and praise God I'm gonna be here hallelujah I'm gonna be delivered I'm gonna be set free you know you have strong faith like Abram because you the royal seed of Abraham hallelujah every morning you wake up how do you feel honey please nothing praise God we're gonna have that baby that's the royal seed of Abraham we're gonna have that promise every promise in the Bible belongs to you and me my then he came to Abram this was now after 25 years look at it and like I say if you read the whole story many people know it but Genesis 17:1 he came to Abram and the Bible says Abram was 99 years old and 9 in other words was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him like this woods I am The Almighty God Oh hallelujah this is three things that impressed me first he's telling Avram Abram you 99 now it's 25 years is gone it's older it's more impossible for the promise to come to pass but now he tells a rimless and Abram I'm the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect hallelujah what the promise at 99 years old he comes to Abram and it seems impossible Abram waited so long the critics mocked him they they criticized him they made fun of him but yeah God appears him at the ripe old age when you think nothing is going on don't you worry Elohim will come your way friend and he says Abram I'm Almighty God and brother says if that meant El Shaddai he was the breasted one in other words Abram lay on my bosom and nurse yourself to a new body he says that's what it meant ever met to nurse himself just lay on my bosom be at rest I know you're old I know it seems impossible but you lay on my breast and nurses that's all we gotta do at this time don't panic don't worry what's gonna happen what's gonna take place next lay on the bosom of Elohim and nurse yourself to a new body hallelujah what was the next words walk before me a listen friend what a beautiful story don't walk before men people like to walk before men he says walk before me Abram don't you worry about your friends don't you worry about your church members don't you walk before the bishop you walk before me hallelujah friends we gotta walk before God don't worry about your friends don't worry about your church members don't worry about the bishop you walk before goddesses and the Almighty walk before me and be thou perfect hallelujah what how could a broom ever be perfect but you see God already in Genesis 15 made a covenant with him and he says Abram you slay those animals it was a heifer it was a goat it was a sheep in two turtledoves and that night when Abram fell asleep a white light came right through it Bible says what was doing he was confirming the unconditional covenant that he made was Abram not what you do Abram not what what anyone can do of us but what I've already done he made an unconditional covenant friend that Abram will be saved Abram will be a father of many nations and he was confirmed in the Covenant why he says Abram be perfect how could it be perfect because he already made a covenant with him so our duty is to walk before Almighty God hallelujah I'm the Almighty walk before me and be thou perfect so friend just know your walk is poor before your friends many times in the churches we have groups we have cliques and we try to impress one another we're not supposed to do that our walk is vertical it is not horizontal that's the way we walk friend we walk with God every man in this world walks with God alone hallelujah and be thou perfect Christ gave us a perfect sacrifice so that's how perfection he says here and he made an unconditional covenant hallelujah is not what you gonna do Abram is what I have done I made your father of many nations and these action was in was already in Christ in God a perfect lamb unconditional company says yeah a perfect lamb has died nice place that's it that God made with the people it's not what I am Who I am is the perfection of Jesus Christ in God that died in my place to make me what I am it isn't whether I can stand I can't it's whether he stood in my place hallelujah so I want to say again we can give the Lord a hand of praise it's not me holding on but Christ holding on to me it's not whether I held on it's whether he held on it's not whether what I can do it's what he done friend so this covenant that God made with Abram comes right over to the Royal Seal of Abram which Christ died for and now we are perfected by his blood and we stand perfect in his sight hallelujah my said yeah oh god made what the people might say this God appear team right yeah he says it in the name of el-shaddai the bosom right in the seventeenth chapter of Genesis and the name of el-shaddai means the bosom in other words the priesthood one like the woman and he said Abram I am your bosom you may be old your strength is gone Sarah's whom is dead but I'm El Shaddai I'm the bosom I'm the president not one he says not one but two double-breasted listen what his next words he says one is for salvation hallelujah and the other one is for healing so double-breasted brother if you want salvation you nurse on one breast if you want healing Eunice on the other breast hallelujah that's how else would I know see yourself to healing last yourself to a new body hallelujah he says yeah I'm the Prince well now you just lean upon my promise nurse and I will satisfy you like a baby being satisfied and bring you back to your strength again he nursed himself to a new body hallelujah now he says yeah now like this is anything too hard for the Lord the message while the age old Saint sitting there with his head down praying no doubt it was then when he loved it up his eyes now this was 99 and brother BAM says right there he made a promise to Abram walk before bill our perfect next best thing he says he has the old Saint sitting he says he is praying no doubt it was then when he loves it up his eyes and he saw three men coming towards the tent or why he jumped up quickly it must have been the spotter they said go to them hallelujah listen he says in that same day Sarah must eat she was miserable she was complaining about Lot's wife dressing so smart having Egyptian hairstyles he said but Abram knew they was coming a visitation an angel visitation listen friends get ready for an angel visitation don't sit there all grumpy and droopy get ready for a visitation from the angel of God he says you know I like this there's something about sportful people he says they recognize the presence of God and I know he says I don't know why it is but it must be they got something in them that magnetizes them to the Spirit of God and he recognizes there was something coming hallelujah there's something in spirit for people that knows the presence of God and Abram knew no matter how Sarah was complaining how she was performing but he knew that they say he's gonna get the visitation and he was making ready for the brother/sister we got to prepare we can't sit back and just think it's gonna happen we got to prepare for what is coming there's a blessing coming there's a rapture coming this adoption coming this perfection coming these healings their signs in one but we must prepare for it as I read the quoted we must get in condition bring yourself in a condition where God can deal with you hallelujah and it says about the year later he says here later God comes on the scene again and he says and you remember how we listened Sara why did you laugh but before we see the promise over if I said Whitey's hid a laugh but what's his next words Genesis 18 verse 14 is anything too hard for the Lord in other words you laughing I made a promise and I said you have a baby and she loves because she couldn't believe God could perform the impossible and people in a message they are doubtful that God can perform right in the midst of this crisis this trying time does virus God can perform the impossible and he said to her is anything too hard for the Lord and I want to challenge every believer is anything too hard for God in the season then our God came to brother that he can bring to pass right in the face of this crisis right in the face of this demons flying in the air God can come right to you and visit you and tell you is anything too hard for my god that's what he said to her and then he made a promise at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have their baby hallelujah yes Abram and the next what is the next Junction hallelujah the natural and the supernatural angels came down they look like men glory stood by a broom the Prophet and told him Abram God will perform the supernatural about this time next year what she's making a promise now according to the time according to life I'll visit you your wife a hundred years old and you'll bring forth a child I'll show you my power is anything to our God God wanted to demonstrate his power then they know nineteen nine years old hundred years old you mean a couple is gonna have a baby God wanted to demonstrate his power and I'm saying now friends to you that hear this message nothing is too hard for my god he wants to demonstrate his power the kingdom that we have chief is the word of God in us that turns itself into power hallelujah so nothing says I'll visit you and I'll show you my power divine healing I'll change you I'll turn you back to young man again I'll change share and make a different person you make it a young woman I'm the miraculous watch hallelujah I'm open up attend I do the miraculous amen I'll show you my power Abram who at the end of a junction of time evil spirits are down yonder in Sodom yes they working among the world down there but I'm yes as Elohim to show you my power while the spirits are working in Sodom they out in ladles here the Holy Spirit is on the earth to demonstrate this power let them carry on with what they doing but there's a purple in the land who under their messenger brother will be the final voice to the final age so while Sodom and Gomorrah is having their time there was a Abram they got a visitor and we had a visitor son of man that the brother spoke omnipotence so now what are we waiting for the miraculous to take place hallelujah Abram I'm gonna show you my my power and he says they working right down there my he says uncertain sound as he said according to the time of life I'm gonna visit you to do the - promise - the promise that I made you he know that sound was certain you see there's many uncertain verses today but we don't have to listen to this one voice and that's the voice of God the voice of his word and the voice of the revealed word and listen man he says here what happened immediately after the angels left listen I'm closing Sarah become a young woman beautiful shook right back showing that what is going to do to every seed of Abram right after the angels left oh my god I hope you catch this revelation their bodies change Sarah become a young beautiful woman imagine 90 years old Abram hundred years old he's gonna do it to every seed of Abram that old grandma become a young woman Abram the hump went out of his back the white beard went away and he was young again hallelujah listen what I'm saying friends he changed their bodies and listen what blue Brenham says yeah I'm busy close the unconditional covenant god made with his people we know that God had to do something to the womb anyhow Oh Sarah didn't he she'd been barren all these years nearly a hundred years old and was barren well he says here in order it's a mixed audience but he says you listen to your doctor I'm your brother in order to do something to make this he had to recreate something in that woman's womb to make her fertile hallelujah is that right in order to do that here to stimulate the heart because she couldn't go into labor like that Oh 100 years old is that right couldn't do that all right yes another thing what about the mug veins he didn't didn't do a patch up anything he made Sarah a new woman Oh hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand the praise he had to change your body he had to give her a new one he had to give her a new heart he had to give a new frog veins because an ideal woman's heart will never be able to stand those bird Queens so brother says he changed them back to young or right another thing what about the mug rains God doesn't pay off he made them young beautiful woman again and Abram a young man he just turned them back to show what is going to do to do to us in the rapture now it takes life Abram he goes right through the rapture with this man oh I hope you'll listen to this and brother brems says listen he changed their body so he says he changed the body of Sharon and Abram next after the message in after the message he changed their body after the mess in order to receive the promised son that's what he has done to the Church is brought through the same thing hallelujah listen so we change Abram he says he couldn't take them back to young woman and a young man again because they were unfertile there so he says it wouldn't have helped he had to give them a new body because when they were young they didn't have children so he created a new body new heart new friends new whom why because to prove that is the all powerful God says Abram I'm the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect God wanted to prove that he can change their bodies friends and he says that's what is gonna do to every royal seed of Abram did not only take them back to be young but gave them a new body and you're gonna see why we need a new body now the next thing is a change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you know what I say just after Abram he says and that's what is done to this church who brought it through the same thing now the next thing is the change in a moment there's a rapture in a twinkling of an eye and we will have we'll have to have a change body and we'll have to have a change but in our Sharon Abram in that kind of body could not receive the promise on there were 100 years old he had to change their body no turn them back so much is too young which he did but also change them because they they'd been like they was in the first place so they would still be barren he changed their body in such a way then they could receive the Sun and now we find the next thing in order for the church is a change body no no table but the church is a change body hallelujah he says here a change but in such a way that they could receive the Sun now we find the nesting in order for the church is a change body not as all people go back to be young so much but we will be there Young Justice but we got to have a change body in order to receive the Sun because we're going to meet him in the air the rapture will come and change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye so we can't just change our bodies and we remain on the earth he says no you know why changing your body because we must meet him in the air so we're not just gonna be changed and remain on the earth no but we're gonna be changed and we're gonna be meet with all those those that died in the Lord and together we're gonna meet the Lord in the air that's the purpose of change in your body to receive the Sun you be in the air we meet him in the air but before we can meet him our bodies has to be changed hallelujah aren't you glad brother this whole peace house is going to be changed this whole house of humiliation is going to be changed God promised what they did to Abram he's been a do to you and me so we're gonna have a body hallelujah one of these days God change a body turn them back listen what he says and I wanted this in Feast of Trumpets a powerful quote God change the body God change the body turn them back it's a mystery what there's to reveal now investing but this was 1984 in this day by the son of man see the evening message so in other words brother Branham had to reveal the mystery of the changing of the body this mystery has to be revealed in this day by the son of man the evening message he does the evening message see turn back that was the last time that they seen what that the discernment before the change of the body remember he said with his back to the tent discern the thoughts and the nesting he disappeared 28 days after that he says I'm gonna visit you according to the time of life we know that's the cycle of a woman and we are mixed audience but you know you read between the lines I'm gonna visit you and when he came back he didn't come in body form again he went over the scene but the next time he came he came in dynamics first time brother sister hallelujah I feel excited man I feel like running around this room man listen he is coming in dynamics to change your body it's not gonna be a person again but it's gonna be the spirit and he says the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the baptism of the holy spirit and these bodies will change it's a mastery that Scotty will reveal by the Son of man the evening message so did brother Branham reveal the mystery or masih come back brother he can't come back that mystery of the changing on the body is already on the earth he already revealed it brother the muscly hallelujah has been revealed and he goes further and before we can ever receive the Sun what happens the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first it says a new body and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye hallelujah and shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air the secret listen has been made known the seals are opened has already come forth why the seals are open the revealing of this mystery is upon the face of the earth there's only one people in the land that has that mystery and that's the pride of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my and you know what that mysteries you know what gives you absolute faith many people is afraid to say but I'm not brother he says the seven thunders will give you refuge faith that mean the same the seventh angel messenger gave us a revelation of how the bodies will change he says the seven thunders will prepare you for great translation faith it will show you how to go it will gather the bride it will be the primary fiber we'll take her out of here so brother it's essential that we preach that part of the promise because they he tied it to the changing of Abraham's body to the changing of the bride's body hallelujah listen what he says here injunction of time what happens when to up lipid ins meet when God and man comes together to up lipid and something is gonna shake whatever you say with a creative power of open importance of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word and he creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass since things that is not it makes them as though they are because to omnipotence have met they he stands isn't he wonderful oh isn't that beautiful so he says when table Putin's meat here is Christ they had stone coming down and here's the bride hallelujah Oh blue Putin's he says and when the to meet something is gonna shake brother's gonna be so powerful that when omnipotent speak the miraculous will take place hallelujah the earth is gonna shake the graves are gonna shake and those that are dead in Christ will rise to life everlasting brother why because to omnipotence has met blessed be the name of the Lord he says yeah I'm busy close you know and this is the junction of all junctions just think of it this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at end so you can expect open opponents to speak listen to that you can expect of Louboutins to speak hallelujah and you can expect the great Andhra mightiest miracles that ever happened on the earth will happen in the next few years to come if Jesus Terrace it will be then watch for Satan to rise up is to now watch the trooper forces I'm closing please when all Evan turns loose all listen when all heaven turns loose all hell turns loose when all hell is loose all heaven turns loose also when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises up a standard against it and those two forces he's always shoot at the junction now he said this is the last Junction that's why the enemy why you think the world is in so estate the enemy knows that all heaven is here the enemy knows God is gonna fornicate his bride so what's he doing his brain all his forces together to try and get rid of the bride but at that time all heaven is on the earth and the same pine brother so he depends on you what are you focusing on are you going to focus on all hell or are you gonna focus on all heaven to me brother I'm looking at all heaven I'm looking at all the angels of God let the devil do what he does but I'm looking for God to deliver his bride right in these trying times he's gonna make away and he says the greatest miracles we ever saw will take place in verse 9 times hallelujah one place he says don't look at the squeeze but what's the third pour it depends on you tonight what are you focusing on the squeeze are you focusing on the third pool are you focusing on death or are you focusing on life and you focusing on hell are you focusing all heaven brother to me I wanna focus on the third full power that will demonstrate itself right at that time hallelujah he's omnipotent power what was it hallelujah he says how much more will he do if he done it before how much more will he do it ever end of this Junction hallelujah my I'm gonna skip a few things and I'm going to close out he says yeah and today he says we need divine Lili worse than ever needed as the days go on and on so will it be more and more needed it will come to pass after a while but unless man is sealed with the Holy Ghost it's hard to tell what is ladies have opened to all kinds of things come not nigh any of those that there is a seal of God in there for when them tremendous plagues begin to fall we add the junction the crossroads now so he says when you see this happen then you must know we're right here there so I got one more quote two more and then I'm closing he says yeah and I believe listen to me Church if you must the whole message I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest fornication of omnipotence that the world has ever known that has been so we right on the threshold we right on the peak we're right on the edge don't give up don't backslide don't go back to the world don't become discouraged don't give up we on the threshold the threshold mean we're right on the edge God is ready to pour out the greatness power he says we on the threshold of the greatness fornication of open opponents that the world has ever known brother in other words that's what brother Branham wanted to see this is what he said he wanted to feel so we standing right on that and I want to encourage you tonight please don't give up run through the horns of the holt and say God give me that I need hallelujah praise God so I'm telling you friends I want encourages I'm closing now hallelujah don't give up there is a power coming on the earth and you can only you gotta
