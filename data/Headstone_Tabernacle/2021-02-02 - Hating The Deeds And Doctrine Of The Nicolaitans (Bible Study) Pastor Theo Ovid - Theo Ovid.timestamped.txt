[11:42] pain and um
[11:43] i'm just grateful to god tonight so
[11:46] i want to share something with you
[11:49] tonight
[11:50] and i trust the lord that he will bless
[11:52] you and and inspire you
[11:54] and to let you know that um we do have a
[11:57] day of prayer and fast
[11:58] on friday and we're going to climb max
[12:00] that with the zoom permitting
[12:02] on friday that announcement was sent out
[12:05] so if you have your bibles tonight i'd
[12:07] like you to turn to revelation chapter
[12:08] two
[12:09] we want to read one to six and we will
[12:11] read verse 15.
[12:13] know what exactly i've been in
[12:14] revelation and um
[12:16] you just take a break and i will just
[12:18] step in the gap to fill this gap here
[12:20] now
[12:20] but i want to reflect on some things
[12:23] that were shared
[12:24] and spoken from this book of revelation
[12:26] so far
[12:27] so we only look at revelation chapter 2
[12:29] verse 1 to 6 and then we go to verse 15.
[12:34] it says unto the angel of the church of
[12:36] ephesus right
[12:38] these things yet he that holds the seven
[12:40] stars in his right hand
[12:42] who walk it in the midst of the seven
[12:44] golden candlesticks
[12:45] i know thy works and i labor unlike
[12:47] patience
[12:48] i hold out cancer bear them which are
[12:50] evil and ours tried them which said they
[12:53] apostles and are not
[12:55] and has found them liars and as born
[12:58] and as patients and for my namesake has
[13:00] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[13:03] i have somewhat against thee because
[13:06] that was left thy first love
[13:07] remember therefore for when's the what
[13:09] fallen and repent
[13:11] and do the first works or else i will
[13:14] come unto thee quickly
[13:15] and will remove that candlestick out of
[13:18] his place
[13:19] accept or repent but this thou hast
[13:22] that thou hate us the needs of the the
[13:25] deeds of the nicoletan
[13:27] which i also hate and verse 15
[13:30] says so as though also them that all the
[13:33] doctrine
[13:34] of the nicolaitan greetings i hate may
[13:37] god bless
[13:38] his word and tonight i want to look and
[13:42] call this hating the deeds the doctrine
[13:46] of the nicolaitans a bible study a view
[13:49] of the ephesians the early church
[13:51] dealing with the seeds of
[13:52] ruination and the key you know sunday we
[13:56] spoke about
[13:57] the two spirits within the free milk of
[13:59] the church we spoke about
[14:02] not only must you know what you are
[14:05] fighting for
[14:07] but you must also know what you are
[14:09] fighting
[14:10] against that's this is very important
[14:14] because if you are not conscious of what
[14:16] the works of the enemy and how he
[14:18] operates
[14:19] you could be deceived you could be
[14:21] fooled it could be trapped
[14:22] but once you know it's coming like a
[14:24] getting revelation of
[14:26] who god is who you are and who the devil
[14:30] is
[14:31] and this is what this is about um god
[14:34] told joshua told the children of israel
[14:37] they come into our land this land
[14:39] is not a clear land it appetizer
[14:41] jebusites a land that is already
[14:43] occupied
[14:44] but the question was or the thing was
[14:47] it belongs to them it was given to them
[14:50] so the
[14:51] challenge was to go and possess it so
[14:54] tonight
[14:55] i want to share something with you
[14:58] on hitting the ds of the nicoleton
[15:01] the d's and the doctrine of the nicolas
[15:04] now the very name ephesus has a strange
[15:06] compound
[15:07] meaning amat and relaxed the high
[15:09] aspirations on this age
[15:11] had begun with the fullness of the
[15:13] spirit the depth of god
[15:15] and whereby they were amen at a high
[15:17] calling of god
[15:18] began to give way to a less watchful
[15:20] attitude
[15:22] a less ardent following of jesus christ
[15:24] begin to manifest itself
[15:26] as a omen that in the future ages the
[15:29] physical vehicle called the church
[15:31] would sink to the awfulness of the depth
[15:35] of satan
[15:36] it had become relaxed and was drifted
[15:39] already the age was backsliding
[15:41] it had left it through his love and
[15:45] there's tiny sparks
[15:48] as i left his first love and the tiny
[15:51] seed planted at that ephesus age
[15:53] would one day grow in the spirit of
[15:56] error
[15:57] until all the false birds of the ear
[16:01] would roost in his branches o blessed be
[16:05] the name of the lord
[16:07] and that is where we find out first
[16:09] identify the spirit of error
[16:10] until the falls both of the air would
[16:12] loosen it branches so inoffensive to
[16:14] human reasoning
[16:15] would that little plant appear to the
[16:18] new eve the new church
[16:19] that again she will be received by satan
[16:22] the ephesians age had presented to her
[16:25] the opportunity for god's best and for a
[16:28] while she prevailed
[16:30] and then relaxed and in that unguarded
[16:33] moment
[16:34] satan planted the seed of complete
[16:37] ruination so therefore
[16:40] satan operates in the same principles
[16:44] and laws that god does
[16:46] planting a seed and then seeing that
[16:49] seed grow
[16:50] and blossom be a fruit okay
[16:54] so here we go proverbs 6 16 to 19. if
[16:58] your bible's getting a mean to proverbs
[17:00] chapter 6 verse 16 to 90.
[17:03] we read
[17:07] these six things that the lord hit
[17:11] ye seven are up an abomination unto him
[17:16] a proud look a lying tongue
[17:20] hands that shed innocent blood a
[17:23] heart that divides that wicked
[17:25] imaginations
[17:27] feet that be swift and run into mischief
[17:31] a false witness that speaketh lies
[17:34] and he let sweat discord among brethren
[17:38] now that part is very important that
[17:40] last one
[17:41] he that sued discord
[17:44] among brethren god hates that
[17:48] let me see it again god hates that
[17:53] so god is not in this going behind
[17:55] somebody back and planting this and no
[17:57] no
[17:58] he's a soul of the good seed and the
[18:01] seed is the word
[18:02] the seed from god's mouth or prophets is
[18:06] always original let me repeat that
[18:09] the seeds that comes out god's mouth
[18:13] of god's prophet is always original
[18:17] because the original seed is the spoken
[18:19] word
[18:21] and the first man to catch god's word
[18:23] because the bible
[18:24] teaches that uh surely the lord god will
[18:27] do nothing about three seven but reveal
[18:29] it as secrets
[18:31] to serve as the prophets and like
[18:33] brother isaac brought out
[18:35] that we were so far from the sun so to
[18:37] speak god needed seven stars
[18:39] to bounce the light off the stars that
[18:42] we could get
[18:43] access to light so we didn't get it
[18:46] direct
[18:47] we get the light to seven stars
[18:51] seven church ages now understand this
[18:55] when john was seeing the seals white
[18:57] horse redhorse pelos black horse
[18:59] and and suzanne marie alter judgment
[19:02] earthquake and then the seven seal
[19:04] it was symbols john
[19:07] and the enemy looking on or whatever
[19:11] couldn't understand the mystery behind
[19:14] the elect
[19:15] being sealed away in every age i want
[19:18] you to get this
[19:19] in every age the elect was called out
[19:22] and sealed away
[19:23] the devil couldn't get no none really
[19:26] under the ox anointing millions of
[19:29] christians died
[19:30] in the dark ages but that debt
[19:33] was also being sealed away under the
[19:36] anointing of the ox
[19:38] god released the eagle anointing his
[19:40] last day to call out an end-time bride
[19:42] which i believe that we are part of okay
[19:45] so therefore it is important to
[19:48] understand
[19:49] where that seed of discord come from
[19:51] that comes from the enemy
[19:53] this this the seed and if we want to
[19:55] take on the next scripture
[19:56] matthew 13 and we want to look at verse
[20:00] 24 to 30
[20:02] and we read matthew 13 24 24-30
[20:06] another parable he put forth unto them
[20:08] saying the kingdom of heaven
[20:10] is likened unto a man which sowed good
[20:13] seed in his
[20:14] field but while men slept
[20:18] his enemy came and saw tears among the
[20:20] wheat went his way
[20:22] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[20:24] forth fruit then appeared
[20:26] tears also so the servant of the
[20:29] householder came and said unto him sir
[20:31] does that not so good seed and i feel
[20:34] from whence then
[20:35] at it tears he said unto them an enemy
[20:38] had done this
[20:39] the servant said unto him well down then
[20:42] that we go and gather them up
[20:44] but he said knee lease while he up the
[20:47] tears
[20:48] you root up the wheat with them let
[20:51] boat grow together until the harvest
[20:55] one and in the time of the harvest
[20:58] i will say to the reapers gather ye
[21:00] together
[21:01] first the tears bind them in bundles
[21:03] burn them guarded the wheat
[21:05] into my ban and jesus completed this
[21:08] parable in matthew 13 go down to 36
[21:11] to 43 then jesus this is verse 36 of
[21:14] matthew 13
[21:16] sent the multitude away went into the
[21:18] house
[21:20] and the disciples came unto him saying
[21:21] declare unto us the parable of the tears
[21:24] of the field now remember this parable
[21:27] speaking in parable is jesus taking
[21:30] common stories and hiding mysteries and
[21:32] stories
[21:33] he was a storyteller telling a story
[21:35] telling a parable
[21:37] hiding truths written a story
[21:40] so they said declare unto us the parable
[21:43] of the tears of the field
[21:45] he answered and sent to them he that's
[21:47] what the good seed is the son of man
[21:49] the field is the world the good seed
[21:53] are the children of the kingdom so we
[21:55] convert that there
[21:56] not just seed but they could see that
[21:59] the children of the kingdom
[22:01] and the tears at the churn of the wicked
[22:02] one the enemy that saw them as the devil
[22:06] the harvest is the end of the world and
[22:09] the reapers
[22:10] are the angels as therefore the tears
[22:13] are gathered and burn in the fire
[22:15] so shall it be in the end of this world
[22:18] the son of man
[22:19] shall send forth his angels they shall
[22:21] gather out of his kingdom
[22:23] all things that offend and them which do
[22:26] iniquity
[22:27] and shall cast them into the furnace of
[22:30] fire
[22:30] there shall be wailing and gnashing of
[22:32] teeth then shall the righteous shine
[22:34] forth as a son
[22:35] in the kingdom of their father who had
[22:37] ears to hear let him hear
[22:40] so brother branham by bringing taking
[22:44] this scripture
[22:45] preach a message called the seed of
[22:47] discrepancy which you identify
[22:50] is a friends that has happened from
[22:52] throughout every age
[22:54] all the way from the beginning it
[22:55] started the very same thing
[22:57] the seed of god is the word of god and
[23:00] then
[23:01] the word is a seed and every seed will
[23:03] bring after its kind
[23:04] now if the christian the children of god
[23:07] the children of the kingdom has become
[23:09] the seed of god
[23:10] then they must be the word of god the
[23:12] word of god manifested in the age that
[23:14] we are living in
[23:16] for the promised seed of that age god
[23:18] gave his word at the beginning
[23:19] and each age had its seed its time
[23:23] and its promises and the people of that
[23:25] age that manifest that promised wood
[23:27] is the seed of that age according to
[23:29] what jesus said
[23:30] right here they are the children of the
[23:32] kingdom
[23:33] so therefore this bright age we call it
[23:38] it is not written in the scriptures
[23:41] about a bright age it's one of the
[23:44] hidden mysteries
[23:46] all they have is seven ages up to
[23:48] laurissia but then here we
[23:50] are talking about another ephesians
[23:53] talking about a prophet who was given a
[23:56] message
[23:56] to turn our hearts back to the fate of
[23:59] the fathers
[24:00] the fate of the fathers in other words
[24:02] we have to go back
[24:04] and pick up what they had so brother
[24:06] branham said this way
[24:08] he talked about uh the lust for
[24:10] knowledge
[24:12] that loss that's what eve ended up
[24:14] having
[24:15] desiring and so on and he said the last
[24:17] call is going to catch the bride before
[24:19] she gets into that
[24:21] he said before the mark of the beast and
[24:23] get doomed
[24:24] come out from among them my people
[24:27] hatred and death and eternal separation
[24:29] from god
[24:29] in this eden of lust filth and
[24:32] perversion
[24:33] by sowing the wrong seed so he said the
[24:36] thing of it is today
[24:38] we don't try to establish the word of
[24:40] god in people's hearts
[24:42] we try we are trying to establish
[24:45] ourselves
[24:46] churches here we go are trying to
[24:49] establish
[24:51] the doctrine of the church in the
[24:54] person's heart
[24:56] let me read it again he said today
[24:59] we don't try to establish the word of
[25:01] god in people's heart
[25:03] we are trying to establish ourselves
[25:08] churches are trying to establish
[25:11] the doctrine of the church in the
[25:14] person's heart
[25:15] but we are commanded to establish the
[25:18] word of god
[25:19] and paul said i didn't come to you with
[25:22] enticing words of man
[25:23] that your faith might rest up in the
[25:25] knowledge of man
[25:27] but i come to you in the power and the
[25:29] manifestation of the holy ghost
[25:31] that your faith might rest in god there
[25:33] you are
[25:34] so man mustn't establish yourself this
[25:37] is about abraham
[25:38] we find it let go do something for a
[25:40] person send them out every
[25:42] man trying to impersonate that they are
[25:44] trying
[25:46] to establish themselves every man i did
[25:49] this
[25:49] me i my my denomination me
[25:53] this establishing themselves
[25:56] what are we preaching about ourselves
[26:00] or the kingdom of god establish
[26:03] the word of god take the out the
[26:06] unbelief
[26:07] and establish the kingdom of god in a
[26:10] man's heart
[26:11] and that kingdom of god cannot be
[26:14] established in a man's heart unless god
[26:16] made a man dust
[26:18] remember the deceitful part is a way to
[26:21] seem right unto a man
[26:23] every intellectual being seem right
[26:26] so here we go what the prophet said
[26:30] is what we see today men trying to
[26:34] establish themselves
[26:36] men trying to establish their slanting
[26:38] message or their doctrine or their
[26:40] teaching
[26:40] what should have the word of god
[26:43] uncompromised
[26:44] uh pure original
[26:47] just comment the prophet's mouth that we
[26:50] could take and apply to our lives and
[26:52] ourselves
[26:53] now paul in acts 20
[26:58] right in the bible in acts 20 20 to 31
[27:01] paul was about to leave and paul
[27:05] brought a prophecy and that is where
[27:07] we're going to connect with
[27:09] to get further into the tortoise bible
[27:11] study tonight
[27:13] paul in acts 20 talking to the church
[27:16] from verse 28. he said take heed
[27:20] therefore unto yourselves unto all the
[27:22] flock
[27:23] over which the holy ghost had made you
[27:25] overseers
[27:26] to feed the church of god which had
[27:28] purchased with his blood
[27:30] for i know this that after mighty
[27:33] pattern
[27:34] shall grievous wolves enter in among you
[27:38] not sparing the flock also
[27:41] so he's talking about outside folks but
[27:44] then he's showing them
[27:46] about the inside folks you say also of
[27:49] your own self shall men arise
[27:51] speaking perverse things
[27:54] reason to draw away
[27:58] disciples after them therefore
[28:02] watch and remember that by the space of
[28:05] three years
[28:06] i cease not to warn every one of you
[28:09] everyone night and day with tears
[28:12] so paul was prophesying
[28:16] the condition that would come where
[28:19] not only wills will come but right in
[28:22] his message
[28:23] the message of the gospel at that time
[28:26] men would raise up
[28:28] and they would preach and teach and do
[28:30] whatever it necessary
[28:32] to draw people to themselves so we find
[28:35] man
[28:36] is still man man has not changed
[28:39] he's still there with his greed with his
[28:42] lust for power
[28:43] with his lust for position and because
[28:46] the heart is corrupt
[28:47] corrupt it put man in a position
[28:50] where he is accessible to
[28:54] fallen angel spirits let me say that
[28:56] again
[28:57] because man heart is corrupt it put man
[29:00] in a position
[29:02] where he is accessible to fallen angel
[29:05] spirits
[29:06] and evil spirits nobody branham let's
[29:08] continue
[29:10] he said this church talking about
[29:13] branham
[29:13] tabernacle the church itself is built
[29:15] upon
[29:16] the sovereignty of the local church
[29:20] the church itself that's what built on
[29:22] therefore
[29:23] i have nothing to say moving this pastor
[29:25] or putting one in
[29:26] you all are the church
[29:29] you people are the one who control
[29:34] you are the church yourself and the
[29:37] church
[29:38] the holy church of god is
[29:41] here we go the sovereignty of the holy
[29:44] spirit in that church
[29:46] now remember what jesus told peter right
[29:48] he said thou art peter
[29:50] and upon this rock i will build my
[29:52] church
[29:54] is not just flinging a brick here and
[29:56] flinging a stone here and flinging a
[29:57] piece of steel here
[29:58] nobody builds a building uh by
[30:02] you know just by his thoughts and fancy
[30:06] they have to have a plan they have to
[30:09] have a vision
[30:10] they have to have a program as how
[30:14] you're going to build if you're building
[30:16] a house you're building a
[30:17] a business or whatever you're building
[30:20] it has to have
[30:22] a map a plan a vision or
[30:25] order in order to build so when jesus
[30:27] said upon this
[30:28] rock i will build my church he was
[30:31] clearly defining
[30:32] an order and a plan of how he wanted
[30:35] that church to be built
[30:36] so brother brown was saying here the
[30:38] holy church of god is the sovereignty of
[30:40] the holy spirit in the church
[30:42] and the church elects their own pastor
[30:44] now
[30:45] being a baptist you remember
[30:48] the reason i kind of stuck with the
[30:50] baptist church
[30:51] was the sovereignty of the local church
[30:55] which i think is apostolic i repeat that
[30:58] he stuck with the baptist church because
[31:01] the baptist church at that time believed
[31:04] in the sovereignty of the local church
[31:06] the baptist church is not a denomination
[31:08] it's not supposed to be
[31:09] it is now but it was not supposedly
[31:12] nomination
[31:12] it's a brotherhood and it's the
[31:14] sovereignty of the local church
[31:16] and if god is ever going to get a
[31:19] message to his man
[31:20] his elder which is according to the
[31:22] bible the highest
[31:24] office of the local church is the elder
[31:28] and and so forth so therefore if god
[31:31] have to speak to that
[31:32] man there's no hindrance it ought to
[31:34] pass through another man
[31:35] worker talk directly to that man
[31:38] therefore
[31:39] there is no one person has nothing to do
[31:41] in this
[31:42] it is the majority of the people now
[31:45] this is ephesians now
[31:47] this is original now this is how it's
[31:49] supposed to be
[31:51] if 20 votes for him and 21 votes against
[31:53] him he goes
[31:54] vice versa that's it it's the
[31:57] sovereignty of the local church
[32:00] each one of the members
[32:03] has a say so in the church anything goes
[32:06] wrong
[32:07] they can come right around and the only
[32:09] thing they have to do is to be before
[32:11] god
[32:11] that they are see that nothing hinders
[32:15] the movement of the church this is the
[32:17] consciousness
[32:19] that all of us must have is not brother
[32:22] over church it's not my church i don't
[32:23] want a church in san diego
[32:24] it's jesus christ we're talking about i
[32:26] serve in that church i'm a servant in
[32:28] that church just like everybody else
[32:30] if god had called me to be in the front
[32:32] pew to be praising and shouting god i
[32:34] will be doing that
[32:35] go call me to minister and preach the
[32:37] word and i do my part
[32:39] i have no part if there's no people to
[32:41] preach to
[32:42] in other words every person in the
[32:44] assembly every person in the church have
[32:46] a power to play
[32:47] because it's god's kingdom we talking
[32:50] about
[32:50] so he said therefore he said now watch
[32:54] so you must ensure that nothing must
[32:57] hinder
[32:58] the moving of the church but the full
[33:01] and complete authority of the church is
[33:03] the pastor
[33:04] if you read that in the bible see that's
[33:06] not bible order there is no one
[33:08] above the elder let me repeat that there
[33:11] is no one
[33:13] above the elder so sovereignty of the
[33:15] church means
[33:17] that the church should not be influenced
[33:21] by any external forces
[33:25] or people or ministry or minister
[33:29] if it's a local assembly based upon the
[33:32] structure
[33:33] and the order presented by that prophet
[33:35] that man who's the local elder
[33:37] or pastor he has to be hearing from god
[33:41] and he has to be speaking as he hears
[33:43] from god to god's
[33:44] people so brother branham says here if
[33:47] there's anything wrong in the church
[33:49] that you ever know
[33:50] or some individual or some person or
[33:52] anything you are duty-bound
[33:54] i will answer before god if you don't
[33:56] clear that thing out
[33:58] you the church now remember it's not on
[34:01] my shoulders it's on yours
[34:03] anything wrong in the church god will
[34:05] make you answer
[34:06] it that's right that's the way he runs
[34:09] his church
[34:10] that's the way it is in the bible that
[34:14] is the
[34:14] order of the bible the sovereignty of
[34:17] the local church
[34:19] the pastor is the head now coming to
[34:21] this blessed will message here
[34:23] i want you to know that this is tip
[34:25] recorded
[34:26] and the tape recorders of the church the
[34:28] orders the rules of the church is untip
[34:30] recorded
[34:30] that's according to the bible we don't
[34:32] run it there's nobody in head
[34:35] no all are we the same we got a leader
[34:39] and listen how we phrased it we got a
[34:41] leader
[34:42] that is the pastor as long
[34:45] as he's led by the holy ghost
[34:49] let me repeat that let me repeat it
[34:50] again we got a leader
[34:53] that is the pastor as long
[34:56] as he is led by the holy ghost
[35:00] praise the lord so how
[35:03] i pray god that it'll be edifying to you
[35:05] tonight
[35:06] and helpful for you tonight that you're
[35:08] seeing your rule
[35:10] and we want to get to something so let's
[35:11] continue for the brand
[35:13] i believe in the supreme
[35:16] authority of the local assembly
[35:20] let each church be its own
[35:24] choose its pastors its deaton whatever
[35:27] it is
[35:28] and in that way the man
[35:31] in deer has no bishop over him
[35:35] the holy spirit wants to speak something
[35:37] to that church
[35:39] they don't have to ask anybody
[35:43] about whether they could do this or that
[35:46] it is the individual in contact with the
[35:49] holy spirit
[35:51] show me in the bible what is greater in
[35:52] the bible than a local elder
[35:54] to a local church that is right the
[35:57] sovereignty of the local church each
[35:59] church
[36:00] in itself now brotherhood that is
[36:02] wonderful
[36:03] all churches ought to be embraced like
[36:06] that
[36:06] for the seventy of the local church
[36:10] so i wanted to put this as a backdrop as
[36:12] we continue luke 22.
[36:15] i want you to find this one if you have
[36:16] a bible luke 22 verse 24 to 27
[36:19] we want to read that one this is
[36:22] this is important luke 22 and you will
[36:25] see all the disciples were just like
[36:27] the people that we have no this year
[36:30] 2021
[36:32] who's 24 luke 22 and there was strife
[36:34] among them
[36:36] which is the disciples this is the
[36:37] disciples driving remember
[36:39] there is a room here they have no holy
[36:41] ghost yet they
[36:42] just get anointed they associate with
[36:44] jesus so therefore they have access to
[36:46] miracles powers and what not but here is
[36:48] a piece of a piece of confusion a piece
[36:51] of even going on among them
[36:52] there was strife among them which of
[36:55] them
[36:55] should be haunted the greatest could you
[36:58] imagine that
[37:00] could you imagine jesus jesus
[37:04] is the lord he's the boss he's the king
[37:06] and then among the
[37:08] who who's the greatest who who you think
[37:11] higher than who
[37:13] these men have the holy ocean these men
[37:16] just called
[37:17] anointed and this is let's continue
[37:22] and he said unto them the kings of the
[37:24] gentiles
[37:26] exercise lordship over them
[37:29] and they and they that exercise
[37:32] authority upon them
[37:33] are called many factors in other words
[37:36] if they are a good man you look up to
[37:37] them because they
[37:38] they are the bosses and whatnot he said
[37:40] but he shall not
[37:42] be so now understand this he has
[37:46] preached he is speaking this to the
[37:47] ministers
[37:48] he is speaking this to these apostles to
[37:51] be
[37:52] you're speaking this to these men who
[37:56] have to get the holy ghost to get these
[37:57] foolishness out of them it's striving
[37:59] and who's the greatest all that nonsense
[38:01] you're speaking to them and saying
[38:04] look at the gentiles look how they does
[38:09] be on top one another and they have the
[38:11] authority of one another
[38:12] he said you shall not be so but he that
[38:15] is greatest among you
[38:17] let him be as the younger and he that is
[38:20] chief
[38:21] as he that does serve for whether it's
[38:24] greater he that sitteth that meat
[38:26] or he that serve it is it not he that
[38:29] sits in that meat
[38:31] but i am among you as he that servant
[38:34] so jesus is telling them listen man i'm
[38:37] the boss
[38:38] i'm in charge and here it is my role is
[38:42] one that serves so this is the backdrop
[38:46] now
[38:47] of where we go into tonight about this
[38:50] nikolaitan this deed and this deed
[38:54] which is the beginning before it became
[38:56] a doctrine
[38:58] and the doctrine becomes flesh and
[38:59] becomes a life
[39:01] it starts with little things little
[39:03] seeds
[39:04] and this deed began the birth of
[39:07] organization and the reason that the
[39:10] church is where it is right now
[39:13] and what we are going through is because
[39:15] of this here
[39:16] this very thing here you see remember
[39:20] in the church age when we opened the
[39:21] first church back there we found out
[39:23] that the holy spirit was against a
[39:25] certain thing that they started in the
[39:26] church age
[39:28] that was called the deeds of the
[39:29] nicolaitan you remember it
[39:32] nikkei means to conquer laity means the
[39:35] church
[39:36] nikolaitan then was to conquer the laity
[39:40] take the holy spirit out of the church
[39:44] and give it all to one holy man let him
[39:47] be the boss of all of it
[39:50] we went through it nicoletan was a
[39:52] saiyan in one church
[39:53] it become a doctrine in the next church
[39:55] age and by the two church age it was an
[39:58] enforcement
[39:59] they had a nice year council let's go
[40:02] out about it again
[40:03] first was i saying you know easy mana
[40:05] dia
[40:06] you know nobody is speaking like him you
[40:09] know wow
[40:10] he's our man and afterwards it was a
[40:13] thought a saying an
[40:14] expression then it becomes a doctrine of
[40:17] course he is the man
[40:18] yeah when he had to get the word to him
[40:20] that is what it comes next
[40:22] and afterwards it was the enforcement at
[40:25] the united council
[40:26] it was made the doctrine of the church
[40:29] and that was the first thing happened
[40:31] an organization from it today
[40:35] he is under the disguisement of the
[40:36] white horse this was on the first scene
[40:38] watch how he changes
[40:39] from the white horse he doesn't only
[40:42] become a white horse and become a beast
[40:44] with many heads
[40:44] and horns the white horse he's a
[40:47] receiver now
[40:48] and that's the reason the people hasn't
[40:50] known it all this time but it's going to
[40:52] be revealed
[40:53] by the scripture now when there's
[40:56] nikolaitan
[40:57] so he's talking about future now when
[40:59] the nicolaitan
[41:01] see the antichrist is finally
[41:04] he is incarnate in a man then he is
[41:06] crowned
[41:08] when he starts off as a nicolaitan
[41:10] spirit in the church
[41:11] he's a spirit you can't crunch
[41:15] a spirit but 300 years later
[41:19] he become a pope and they crong him
[41:22] he had no crown to start with but he got
[41:25] a crown
[41:26] see that is when the spirit become
[41:29] incarnate he become a man nikolaitan
[41:33] the doctrine become a man then they
[41:36] could crumb him
[41:37] they couldn't do it because it was a
[41:38] doctrine so in other words
[41:41] this thing went from deed to doctrine
[41:46] to become incarnate then it could be
[41:49] crown
[41:50] is not something and then brother
[41:52] branham flip the script
[41:54] and bring it on the positive side so
[41:57] watch
[42:00] glory notice when this holy spirit
[42:03] that we have become incarnate to us
[42:07] the one that's in our midst now in the
[42:09] form of the holy ghost become incarnate
[42:11] of us and the person of jesus christ
[42:13] we call him king of kings and lord of us
[42:16] could we give you a hand of praise for
[42:17] that
[42:18] oh praise the name of the lord blessed
[42:19] be the name of the lord you love him
[42:21] tonight
[42:22] blessed be the name of the lord so
[42:24] brother branham quote the scripture
[42:27] and you say my over in john little
[42:29] children i would not have you ignorant
[42:31] for you to know about the antichrist
[42:33] spirit which is already come
[42:35] and is working in the churning of
[42:37] disobedience
[42:39] the antichrist spirit then was beginning
[42:41] to form
[42:43] in the nicoletan spirit to make
[42:46] an organization and this nicolet and
[42:49] spirit
[42:49] the object of it the purpose of it
[42:53] is to conquer the laity
[42:56] because once the ladies conquered listen
[42:59] to this
[43:00] the spirit can move oh hallelujah
[43:03] oh glory to god do you understand that
[43:06] do you understand once the lady is
[43:08] conquered
[43:08] the spirit can't move because they
[43:11] switch
[43:12] the operation of the spirit from the
[43:15] people
[43:16] to the manbini pulpit oh glory
[43:19] hallelujah and the prophet said god is a
[43:22] god of the audience
[43:24] i wanted to get remember it wasn't about
[43:27] moses you know moses was about getting
[43:30] all god's people
[43:31] it has always been about god's people it
[43:34] wasn't about abraham
[43:35] it was abraham's seed it has always been
[43:39] god's people
[43:40] he said they were the children of god
[43:42] and when they came out of egypt
[43:44] they become the church of god so i want
[43:46] to show you
[43:47] that the burden of god is for his people
[43:51] when he say if my people that are called
[43:54] by my name
[43:55] shall humble themselves and he's not
[43:56] talking about pastor and teacher
[43:58] he's not talking about dating he's
[44:00] talking about my people
[44:02] all this past and teacher evangelist was
[44:05] the purpose of that
[44:06] for the perfecting of who these saints
[44:09] which is you
[44:10] oh give god some praises tonight the
[44:13] object of god sending a prophet behold
[44:15] i send you elijah the prophet there's
[44:18] nothing like you to star
[44:19] and take pictures and see what he's
[44:21] actually prophet
[44:22] he shall do something he shall turn the
[44:25] hearts of who
[44:26] you the children that's the object of
[44:29] this whole message
[44:31] the object is to get us back to defeat
[44:34] which is back to the original and the
[44:36] original
[44:37] had no pope had no bishop had no man in
[44:40] the hour
[44:41] it did not have that in the original so
[44:44] now we're gonna get down
[44:46] to why god says i hate it
[44:50] i hate it i hear the deeds i hate the
[44:53] doctrine
[44:54] i hate it i wit you on that i know your
[44:57] fellow from your first love and i know
[44:59] you're struggling
[45:00] know you have works i know this about
[45:02] you i know that but you see i'm with you
[45:04] i wish you on that one we on the same
[45:07] page
[45:08] you hate the deeds of the nicolaita and
[45:11] you hear the doctrine of the neglect
[45:13] i with you on that well hear what this
[45:15] last day bright church
[45:17] going back to fullest love and going
[45:18] back to hating the deeds of the
[45:20] nicolaitan and reduction in nuclear we
[45:24] will not accept anything
[45:25] are going to conquer the laity and press
[45:27] the people that is why you should be
[45:29] praising god tonight that you are free
[45:32] oh hallelujah you're free to worship
[45:34] you're free to praise him you're free to
[45:35] honor him
[45:36] oh hallelujah because you escape oh
[45:39] you're one of the escaped ones
[45:41] oh blessed be the name of the lord all
[45:43] right
[45:44] let's take some more here now
[45:48] the true vine hated
[45:52] the formal deeds of the nicoletas so did
[45:56] god
[45:57] what was this in the ephesians church in
[46:00] the church of ephesians
[46:02] became the doctrine in the programmers
[46:04] church
[46:05] in the ephesus the first church it was a
[46:08] deed
[46:09] in the next church become a doctrine can
[46:11] you hear it can you understand it now
[46:13] it was a deed in ephesus and in pyramus
[46:17] it becomes a doctrine it started in baby
[46:20] form
[46:21] now let's break down the word and he
[46:22] break down the word we know it nico to
[46:24] conquer or overthrow
[46:26] nicolet and still conquer over to the
[46:28] lady
[46:29] what they were trying to do here
[46:33] was trying to take the church where god
[46:36] had pastors
[46:37] and the spirit of god moving by the
[46:39] gifts in the church
[46:40] of the living god oh hallelujah
[46:45] and they were having a doctrine start
[46:48] that they were going to have
[46:49] some priests and bishops
[46:52] and popes so you see all this
[46:56] slighting of the gifts of the spirit
[46:57] gift of wisdom if of healing
[46:59] gift of tongues if of interpretation
[47:01] that is not pentecostal you know that is
[47:03] our thing
[47:04] let me see it again all the nine
[47:07] gifts all the ninefold gifts have to be
[47:09] back in the church
[47:11] so it's not just gifts of pasta teacher
[47:13] profit on a mandated pulpit
[47:15] no it have gifts to move among the
[47:17] people because god wants to show he's
[47:20] the god of israel the god of my people
[47:23] he wants to show his god among his
[47:24] people
[47:25] do you believe that tonight and i want
[47:28] you to be under great expectation
[47:30] to expect all those gifts to come back
[47:32] into the church
[47:33] tongues interpretations prophecies
[47:36] healings
[47:37] all these things it's supposed to be
[47:38] operating among god's people
[47:40] but i'm calling this way mark 16 in
[47:44] action
[47:45] and brother stephen struck it aboard the
[47:47] church near any headstone
[47:48] superchurch super race as they near the
[47:51] headstone
[47:52] this is what this is all about oh
[47:54] blessed be the name of the lord so i
[47:56] trust
[47:56] that it refreshes you tonight to see
[47:59] what god is seeing in this last day
[48:01] he said no so therefore they wanted to
[48:03] have this poop and program
[48:04] he said in other words take all the
[48:06] sacredness
[48:08] all the power from the church
[48:11] and put it on priests let the
[48:14] congregation live the way it wants to by
[48:16] the priests of what he wants
[48:17] taking the holy ghost away from the
[48:19] people with signs
[48:21] wonders following them now let me just
[48:23] say this back again
[48:24] what did the bible say these signs shall
[48:26] follow the pastors
[48:28] no the bible said these signs shall
[48:30] follow who
[48:32] them that believe which is you
[48:36] can you give us some praises for that do
[48:38] you understand that signs
[48:39] supposed to follow the believers it just
[48:42] said these signs
[48:43] shall follow the pastors these signs
[48:45] shall follow the mandarin
[48:46] pulpit no it said these signs shall
[48:49] follow
[48:50] them that belief
[48:54] in my name they shall in my name they
[48:56] shall in my name they shall
[48:58] give the lord some praises so it doesn't
[49:00] have it
[49:01] okay so let's let's back up a little bit
[49:04] old testament
[49:06] levitical priesthood one man
[49:09] oh no one man going once a year to offer
[49:12] sacrifice
[49:13] special man high priest iran high priest
[49:16] once a year israel under tension waiting
[49:19] for this man
[49:19] to come out got to put some rope on him
[49:22] in case he didn't walk right and talk
[49:23] right and he dropped down dead his head
[49:25] that they told him because nobody got
[49:27] one rescue
[49:28] this is a a one-track team that'll be in
[49:31] order
[49:31] bell's ringing anointed right perfume
[49:34] right what you all the drama
[49:36] to go to offer and sprinkle the blood
[49:39] seven times eastward upon the mercy seat
[49:41] oh hallelujah make them feel inspired
[49:42] night hallelujah
[49:44] because the blood was covering sin so
[49:47] you had to wait till the man come
[49:48] victory god gave us
[49:50] a a a sign off for one more year and
[49:52] people had victory
[49:54] when jesus died and the veil was from
[49:57] the top to the bottom
[49:58] and god bust that whole ceremony
[50:00] everything up
[50:01] because the real sacrifice was not on
[50:03] the cross
[50:05] he dismissed this one-man show
[50:08] and this one man going once a year and
[50:10] people don't know the mystery and reveal
[50:12] because the veil was there on calvary
[50:13] cross giving you
[50:15] direct access somebody said direct
[50:17] access stick it back to you
[50:19] direct access not to mary not to joseph
[50:23] not surpassed the holy ali or prophet
[50:25] muhali or teacher holy ali
[50:27] or apostle reality or evangelist holy
[50:29] ali not to none of them
[50:32] but direct access to the blood of
[50:34] calvary
[50:36] that's what he did so therefore the new
[50:39] testament in his
[50:40] blood gave us the passcode
[50:43] to access his presence whereas was debt
[50:46] to go in
[50:48] nor with debt to be out of the presence
[50:50] so the object
[50:52] of you the people is to bring you into
[50:54] presence
[50:55] this is the object of the message to
[50:57] bring you into presence but bring you
[50:59] into church
[51:00] where you come to church and go back
[51:01] home but you're coming to presence
[51:04] where you could be quickened and get
[51:08] active change in your life i like that
[51:11] not just change active change every day
[51:14] something taking place
[51:15] hallelujah oh glory to god you're seeing
[51:18] progress
[51:18] you're seeing improvement you're seeing
[51:20] things changing you're seeing old leaves
[51:22] falling off and new leaves coming in
[51:24] trying to explain how they can't explain
[51:27] when you're growing
[51:28] you're maturing you're writing you're
[51:30] handling trial and testing
[51:32] differently why because you're coming
[51:34] into presence
[51:35] and that's why paul could say i come not
[51:37] with enticing words but i come
[51:39] with the power and demonstration that
[51:40] your faith may not lie on my gift that
[51:42] could bring knowledge and wisdom and
[51:44] revelation to you
[51:45] but that your faith will rise and
[51:47] connect to the power of god
[51:48] or give him praises tonight bless his
[51:50] wonderful name
[51:51] oh hallelujah so watch
[51:54] so therefore taking the holy ghost and
[51:57] swapping it for peace do you see what it
[51:58] was
[51:59] it finally it was deeds and this place
[52:01] had become a doctrine
[52:03] ty tyra it took over luther came out and
[52:05] so on we went right on with that
[52:07] now here's what the prophet said now
[52:10] the pentecostal power or a church that
[52:13] was on pentecost
[52:14] it was quite large at the beginning
[52:17] but they started a denominational spirit
[52:19] coming among them
[52:21] trying to denominate the church which
[52:24] was called
[52:25] the deeds of the nicolet okay
[52:28] and that's the overthrow the the lady
[52:31] and the only one to give the interpreter
[52:33] okay and
[52:35] it was trying to overturn the lady and
[52:37] put all the blessing on only
[52:39] one to read the bible and only one to
[52:42] give the interpretation
[52:44] and would be the bishop or some great
[52:46] head
[52:47] person of the church then we find out
[52:51] the second church age will begin to
[52:52] squeeze me out
[52:54] and then in the third age program
[52:55] pentecost was almost squeezed out
[52:57] but the doctrine of denomination it
[53:00] becomes some days into a doctrine
[53:02] and he says this group here had
[53:05] overpowered the pentecostal group
[53:09] so in other words the original church is
[53:13] a pentecostal church or give the lord
[53:15] some praises
[53:16] your original church the church on the
[53:18] dynamic power
[53:19] the original church is a church like if
[53:22] somebody dropped dead in your church
[53:23] you don't call for bear goes for a home
[53:25] you raise the dead
[53:26] and you continue preaching no it's the
[53:29] calling for belgrus
[53:30] they're calling for some funeral home to
[53:31] pick up the dead that fallen church
[53:33] before i'm saying but the original
[53:35] church which is the church we had to go
[53:36] back to
[53:38] it was a church with power with tongues
[53:41] prophecy with signs with wonders with
[53:44] miracles
[53:45] with healings with visions now
[53:48] you you say i'm saying that from a
[53:50] general perspective
[53:51] but when you're going to jewel what did
[53:53] god prophesy it shall come to pass
[53:56] afterwards that i will pour out my
[53:59] spirit
[54:00] and young men shall see visions all men
[54:03] shall dream dreams
[54:04] upon my handmaidens into commando fight
[54:06] for ministry you're talking about
[54:07] i report my spirit upon all flesh so the
[54:11] promise
[54:12] still is the spirit pouring out the
[54:15] problem was
[54:16] when dynamics fell on pentecostals
[54:19] 1906 all they could have produced was
[54:21] gifts
[54:22] because they didn't have the word
[54:24] because you would come into a prophet
[54:26] so therefore the real adoption power
[54:30] the real manifestation with sons of god
[54:32] couldn't be at that time
[54:34] because the word to produce character
[54:37] wasn't released
[54:38] yet from the monk of that prophet let me
[54:42] say it again
[54:43] dynamics came long in 1906 you know but
[54:46] the world was not there
[54:48] the dynamics that came down in 1906
[54:51] could only release tongues and healing
[54:54] and all kind i guess
[54:54] no life because only you would have life
[54:58] and that dynamics that came in 1906 was
[55:01] really the dynamics
[55:02] that in effect was bringing about the
[55:05] restoration
[55:07] of the bright tree god was restoring to
[55:10] bring back
[55:10] another original branch oh hallelujah
[55:14] so you're not pentecostal you're not
[55:16] baptist or methodist
[55:17] you belong to this original thing
[55:21] alpha and omega first and the last
[55:24] first church and the last church is the
[55:26] same church you must want nothing
[55:28] less than that oh blessed be the name of
[55:31] the lord do you see it tonight
[55:32] trust to see it tonight so they started
[55:35] with this domination thing
[55:36] and afterwards now they only have one
[55:38] man to give the word
[55:40] interpretation the word and so on and he
[55:42] said this group here overpowered
[55:44] that pentecostal group overcome what the
[55:47] laity
[55:48] when all the holiness goes into some man
[55:50] just some man alone
[55:52] he's the only one and the church can
[55:54] live any way they want to make
[55:56] confession to him
[55:57] the holy ghost is for whosoever laity
[55:59] and all it isn't god you will for it
[56:01] just to be a holy man
[56:03] it's the holy ghost among people
[56:07] so when a narcissist came into the
[56:09] church
[56:10] it wasn't just peter dear it was the
[56:12] operation of the holy ghost
[56:13] the bible said the lord added to the
[56:15] church such as would receive
[56:17] it wasn't just men trying to snatch
[56:19] people off the street like
[56:20] fine fire them inside the church it was
[56:22] god himself
[56:24] putting upon people's heart to get to
[56:26] that church to get under that anointing
[56:28] to get in that group when emphasis gets
[56:30] licks after manifesting poor god
[56:32] the pressure comes down on them and they
[56:34] put licks on them to stop it
[56:35] because they say licks you know human
[56:37] being already you gotta licks
[56:38] you take a timeout instead of taking a
[56:40] timeout you church gather together
[56:42] and they might have prayer meeting oh
[56:44] glory that a holy ghost time premature
[56:47] and the power of god will rock them they
[56:49] get a fresh baptism the bible call it
[56:51] they were
[56:51] refilled with the holy ghost and the
[56:53] prophet said the dynamics of this church
[56:55] will be a refilling of the holy ghost i
[56:57] don't know if you are the elix
[56:59] but one thing i know a good very filling
[57:01] of the holy ghost
[57:02] that's the dynamics it will be refilling
[57:04] of the holy ghost
[57:06] this is what and he said that the
[57:07] churches in that time had so much of the
[57:09] holy ghost
[57:10] and they acted like they didn't have he
[57:12] said if churches no don't have
[57:14] i like to do okay we have to get more
[57:16] hungry
[57:17] we have to get more thirsty we have to
[57:19] get more on the expectation
[57:21] to get back to where we're supposed to
[57:23] be because
[57:24] while abraham came to turn our hearts
[57:27] back to his feet
[57:28] of the fathers back to another ephesians
[57:30] trust tonight you get excited
[57:32] i trust tonight you see it this is
[57:33] what's programmed so listen to this
[57:36] it's taking the power out of the laity
[57:40] and put it upon a minister so wait
[57:43] better over
[57:44] you mean the ladies supposed to have
[57:45] power come on now give me a shout on
[57:47] that one
[57:49] what the scriptures say in acts 1 8 you
[57:50] shall receive power when
[57:52] after the holy ghost come down upon you
[57:54] or after some minister come and share a
[57:56] word with you
[57:59] is after the holiest come upon you the
[58:01] message we have received in books and
[58:03] tips
[58:03] is letter that would have to come alive
[58:08] that would have to come flesh jesus is
[58:10] not coming for books on tapes
[58:12] we could have books from from from the
[58:13] ground to the ceiling
[58:15] that is not really rapture come and you
[58:17] stay among the books you could
[58:18] you can make a book close a book jacket
[58:21] a message pants
[58:23] yeah somebody designed a message shoes
[58:24] for you and all that's not going rapture
[58:27] what going in the rapture is the spirit
[58:29] life and you the magnetism of the holy
[58:31] ghost
[58:32] that's what we have to have because the
[58:33] big rapture magnet coming to pick up
[58:35] those
[58:35] that are connected that are quitting at
[58:37] our life and no man could quit than you
[58:40] think about it think about it the holy
[58:42] ghost alone is the revel
[58:43] revealer of the revelation of jesus
[58:45] christ that is why
[58:47] a man without education could get
[58:49] revelation
[58:50] because it's not man teaching them that
[58:53] is the holy ghost revealing to him that
[58:54] that is why god could bite us
[58:56] all them tribal pharisees and call
[58:58] fishermen
[58:59] and put them in charge of the church
[59:01] mend that guy write their own name
[59:03] put them in charge of the church because
[59:06] they're not operating by intellect
[59:07] they're operating by the pillar of fire
[59:09] wrestling on their shoulder speaking out
[59:12] do you have a lighter man you're like a
[59:13] god sylvan gold have i known peter i go
[59:16] and say
[59:16] i have a training classes yeah how to
[59:18] tell them that oh how would you say this
[59:20] thing
[59:20] it wasn't peter was the hotest agent
[59:22] peter just watched the man
[59:24] look on him oh glory hallelujah you look
[59:26] on him
[59:27] and then the next day he said i perceive
[59:29] you are fit to be healed
[59:31] these guys was breaking into this
[59:32] element i perceive
[59:34] you are fair to be healed rise up and
[59:37] walk in the name of jesus christ
[59:39] because they were doing things jesus
[59:40] didn't even do
[59:42] because he has accepted will you be made
[59:44] whole will you make perfect peter talk
[59:46] that talk
[59:47] peter says sir don't go i want to give
[59:48] it to you
[59:50] i want to give it to you tonight i want
[59:52] to share it with you
[59:54] rise up and walk in the name of jesus
[59:55] christ be free be delivered
[59:58] come out of the darkness come out of
[1:00:00] blindness
[1:00:02] this is this is what this is about oh
[1:00:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:05] so watch this here it is take nepal to
[1:00:08] the lady put it upon a minister of
[1:00:09] bishop
[1:00:10] whatever it might be watch the deeds of
[1:00:12] the nicolaitan
[1:00:14] overcome the laity and watch i think in
[1:00:17] a meeting like this it give god a chance
[1:00:19] to work
[1:00:20] through the laity and see this is
[1:00:22] brother branham
[1:00:23] see the power of god work
[1:00:26] through the laity oh praise the name of
[1:00:29] the lord
[1:00:30] so no man here we go no man on the
[1:00:34] platform
[1:00:35] has got a right to say
[1:00:38] he is the only one that has got the holy
[1:00:41] ghost
[1:00:42] and he is the only one got a say so in
[1:00:46] it the holy spirit
[1:00:49] is is the whole entire body of christ
[1:00:53] oh dear where there are tongues
[1:00:55] interpretations gifts and manifestation
[1:00:57] holy spirit
[1:00:58] so no man on the platform have a right
[1:01:00] to say he's the only one
[1:01:02] anytime a man say that you know there's
[1:01:03] problems
[1:01:05] that is problems big time oh my
[1:01:08] hallelujah
[1:01:09] you love him tonight so this is the core
[1:01:11] here i'm going to
[1:01:12] speak here to you what are these
[1:01:14] nicolaitans
[1:01:16] he said again the two words nico which
[1:01:19] means to conquer leos which means the
[1:01:21] laity
[1:01:21] in plain fact somebody was doing
[1:01:24] something in that early church
[1:01:25] which was conquering the laity and if
[1:01:28] the late he was being conquered then it
[1:01:29] must have been some authority doing it
[1:01:32] what was it that god hated
[1:01:35] that was happening to that church what
[1:01:38] was going on then
[1:01:39] and is no going on today
[1:01:43] is exactly what the word nicoletan
[1:01:46] means the people here we go
[1:01:50] the people were being subjected
[1:01:53] somehow in a way that was absolutely
[1:01:57] contrary to the word of god
[1:01:59] you know the bible talk about the famine
[1:02:00] right in the last days not for books on
[1:02:02] tips not for bibles not for preachers
[1:02:05] but for churches they're mortals than
[1:02:06] ever more barriers than ever
[1:02:08] more messy people than ever but for
[1:02:10] hearing the true word of god
[1:02:12] i ain't talking about but ram tips which
[1:02:15] we know is that he's not still only
[1:02:16] prophet
[1:02:17] i'm talking about people that presented
[1:02:20] the word the gospel
[1:02:22] original gospel and he said they will
[1:02:24] run to the east they will not hear it
[1:02:26] he said why because of the same
[1:02:29] organizational spirit the people will
[1:02:31] not be able to hear it
[1:02:33] the hearing of the word
[1:02:37] away think about that there are bibles
[1:02:40] there are preachers but you're not
[1:02:42] hearing the word it'll be staffed oh
[1:02:45] they wouldn't hear the jubilee trumpet
[1:02:47] the freedom you wouldn't understand
[1:02:48] it's not the church going in the rapture
[1:02:50] it's yuri individual
[1:02:52] rapture and the rapture have to be in
[1:02:53] you for you to go in the rapture
[1:02:56] rapture is not external you're acting
[1:02:57] internal something has to happen on the
[1:02:59] inside
[1:03:00] something supernatural has to happen
[1:03:02] with your life
[1:03:03] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:05] praise god let's continue
[1:03:08] so what was it that god hated the people
[1:03:11] was being subjected somehow
[1:03:13] in a way that was absolutely contrary to
[1:03:16] the word of god
[1:03:18] he said the two vines make the church
[1:03:20] they are like wheat and tears
[1:03:22] growing up side by side but one is true
[1:03:26] the other one is false so here we go
[1:03:29] this might blow your mind now god will
[1:03:31] speak to each one
[1:03:34] and he will talk about each one he will
[1:03:38] call
[1:03:38] them the church but only the elect
[1:03:42] will really know which is the true
[1:03:44] spirit
[1:03:46] so when he said let the spirit say it
[1:03:47] unto the churches he'd have a true
[1:03:49] church
[1:03:50] and a false church god sent one prophet
[1:03:53] to boot
[1:03:55] i wait think about that
[1:03:59] both claiming profit both claiming the
[1:04:02] hearing
[1:04:03] both came in they believe in but one is
[1:04:05] true or one is false
[1:04:08] are you with me so this is not skim milk
[1:04:11] this is serious stuff he said i read it
[1:04:14] again
[1:04:16] now god will speak to each one and he
[1:04:19] will talk about each one
[1:04:21] he will call them the church but only
[1:04:23] the elect will really know which is the
[1:04:25] true spirit
[1:04:26] only the elect will not be deceived by
[1:04:28] 24 24.
[1:04:30] for there shall arise false christs
[1:04:31] false prophets shall show straight
[1:04:33] sounds and wonders and so much
[1:04:35] it will that that will be very possible
[1:04:37] they shall be seized very like
[1:04:39] so way back here in the early church a
[1:04:42] very short period after pentecost the
[1:04:44] false
[1:04:44] vine got to entwine itself
[1:04:48] around the true vine and refine
[1:04:51] these deeds of the nicoletanes and that
[1:04:53] spirit
[1:04:55] is going to be found fighting the true
[1:04:58] vine
[1:04:59] until it is destroyed by god now have
[1:05:02] you got it
[1:05:04] no it had left its first love leaving
[1:05:07] its first
[1:05:08] love of the word of god was revealed to
[1:05:10] us as having fallen from its origin
[1:05:13] which was tempting in plain english that
[1:05:16] means this church
[1:05:17] was in danger of being taken away from
[1:05:19] the leading of the holy spirit
[1:05:22] or the control of the spirit this was
[1:05:24] exactly what took place after moses led
[1:05:26] israel out of egypt
[1:05:28] the way of god was to lead them by the
[1:05:30] cloud of fire prophetic utterance
[1:05:33] miracles signs god gave him wonders i
[1:05:36] think that's worth reading again
[1:05:37] the way of god to lead him was by cloud
[1:05:40] of fire
[1:05:42] prophetic utterance miracles
[1:05:45] signs god given wonders this was to be
[1:05:48] accomplished by
[1:05:50] here we go god selected god ordained
[1:05:54] god equipped and god sent men
[1:05:58] with the whole camp being dominated
[1:06:01] by a holy ghost move so brown went back
[1:06:05] in the old testament
[1:06:06] to identify the church back here
[1:06:10] what it was being governed by cloud by
[1:06:13] day
[1:06:14] pillar fire by night prophetic utterance
[1:06:18] signs wonders miracles
[1:06:21] so that shadow was a type
[1:06:24] of what was supposed to be the real
[1:06:26] thing do you see it tonight
[1:06:29] so that was the original intent of god
[1:06:32] and that is what god wanted for his
[1:06:36] people
[1:06:37] but listen to this he says then they
[1:06:40] wanted a king
[1:06:41] and brother isaac spoke about that they
[1:06:43] wanted to be exactly like the world
[1:06:46] and went into complete apostasy and
[1:06:48] oblivion that is exactly
[1:06:50] how the food stream started it will get
[1:06:52] worse and worse
[1:06:54] until the holy spirit is completely
[1:06:56] rejected and god must destroy the people
[1:06:58] so this is prophecy right here he said
[1:07:00] will get worse
[1:07:02] and worse until the holy spirit is
[1:07:04] rejected because man believed that they
[1:07:06] are god
[1:07:07] you see always starting early church it
[1:07:08] was called deeds then become a doctrine
[1:07:11] it became the standard it became the
[1:07:13] unbending we
[1:07:15] it finally took over and god was pushed
[1:07:17] aside it started so small
[1:07:20] so quietly so inoffensively it looks so
[1:07:23] good
[1:07:23] it seems so sung then it caught a hole
[1:07:26] like a python
[1:07:27] snake it squeeze out the very breath and
[1:07:30] kill all these spirits uh spirituality
[1:07:32] in the church that false vine is subtle
[1:07:35] it's like an angel of light
[1:07:36] until it gets a hole in you now i want
[1:07:38] to say
[1:07:39] that i believe in leadership but it is
[1:07:42] not the leadership of
[1:07:43] men i believe in i believe in the
[1:07:46] leadership of the holy ghost
[1:07:48] coming to the word i believe also that
[1:07:51] god has sent
[1:07:52] men in the church men who are gifted by
[1:07:55] the spirit
[1:07:56] and they will keep the church in order i
[1:07:58] believe that and i believe also
[1:08:00] that the church has ruled over amen and
[1:08:03] god sends that god sends the big church
[1:08:06] but that rule is by the word
[1:08:10] so that is not men really ruling but the
[1:08:12] spirit of god
[1:08:13] or the word and spirit of one praise the
[1:08:16] name of the lord
[1:08:17] but you see what was happening back
[1:08:18] there that false
[1:08:20] vine was getting a hole it was teaching
[1:08:24] that rulership by man was right it
[1:08:26] taught that the church had to be
[1:08:28] governed
[1:08:29] it brought a control over the people
[1:08:33] but instead of doing it god's way
[1:08:36] they simply took authority and vested
[1:08:39] all the spiritual power in their own
[1:08:41] hands and came out with a holy
[1:08:43] priesthood
[1:08:44] standing between god and the people
[1:08:48] how much time you're here you have to go
[1:08:50] to this man to pass through this man
[1:08:52] if you come to sweden make the bride you
[1:08:54] alter the bride cut you off you're
[1:08:55] shocked yours this and that like that
[1:08:57] and brother branham is saying clearly
[1:09:00] there is no man between you
[1:09:02] and your lord there is no person between
[1:09:03] there at all let me say it again he says
[1:09:06] and watch and and came up with the holy
[1:09:09] priesthood standing between god and the
[1:09:11] people
[1:09:11] they went right back to the old aeronic
[1:09:14] system
[1:09:15] they became antichrist for the disposed
[1:09:18] of his mediation and imposed their own
[1:09:21] god hated that the ephesians
[1:09:25] hated that and any true believer will
[1:09:27] hate that too
[1:09:28] we would have to be stone blind not to
[1:09:31] see
[1:09:32] that the same thing at work all to the
[1:09:33] ages and right now
[1:09:35] it is worst of all what it was it was
[1:09:37] organization
[1:09:39] that separated the people what separated
[1:09:42] the people
[1:09:44] organization when somebody say i am
[1:09:45] right everybody else is wrong you say we
[1:09:48] have this image i know that is wrong
[1:09:50] it cannot be that because it's not a
[1:09:52] church it's a kingdom
[1:09:54] it's not a church it's a bright body
[1:09:56] it's not one man
[1:09:57] it's a many member body that god is
[1:09:59] anointed and inspiring
[1:10:01] at this particular time okay so when you
[1:10:03] homostretch
[1:10:05] god's people are supposed to be one by
[1:10:08] one spirit
[1:10:08] are all baptized into one body
[1:10:12] and every one is to be moved upon
[1:10:15] by the holy ghost everyone
[1:10:18] is to participate in the worship of god
[1:10:21] and repeat that again
[1:10:23] everyone is to be moved upon by the holy
[1:10:26] ghost
[1:10:26] and everyone is to participate in the
[1:10:29] worship of god
[1:10:31] but men wanted the preeminence
[1:10:34] so they took over control and bishops
[1:10:37] become ash bishops
[1:10:39] at which imposing titles they bypassed
[1:10:41] the word of god and taught their own
[1:10:43] doctrines
[1:10:44] they got the people to obey them until
[1:10:48] time came that their way of worship
[1:10:51] did not in any way resemble the early
[1:10:53] church after pentecost
[1:10:55] these deeds were the beginning of
[1:10:58] apostolic succession
[1:10:59] on pop sex succession it was one easy
[1:11:03] and quick step
[1:11:04] to church membership as a means of
[1:11:06] saving grace
[1:11:07] the word was reduced to a creed
[1:11:10] antichrist spirit by his spirit
[1:11:12] was predominating the church my
[1:11:17] so watch you may recall that i brought
[1:11:20] out an ephesians age that word nicoleta
[1:11:22] to conquer the lady now why is this such
[1:11:25] a terrible thing
[1:11:26] it is terrible because god
[1:11:29] has never placed his church in the hands
[1:11:32] of an elected
[1:11:33] leadership which moves with political
[1:11:36] magnus
[1:11:37] he has placed his church in the care of
[1:11:40] god ordained
[1:11:41] spirit-filled world-living men who
[1:11:44] lead the people to feeding them the word
[1:11:47] he has not separated the people into
[1:11:49] classes so that the masses are led by a
[1:11:51] holy priesthood
[1:11:52] it is true that the leadership must be
[1:11:54] holy but then so must be the whole
[1:11:56] congregation
[1:11:58] further there is no place in the world
[1:12:01] where priests
[1:12:02] or minister or such many immediate
[1:12:04] between god and the people
[1:12:06] let me read it again there is no place
[1:12:08] in the world
[1:12:10] where priests or minister
[1:12:14] mediate between god
[1:12:17] and the people how in jesus name
[1:12:21] could a man have a key to your life that
[1:12:23] is
[1:12:24] insane that is
[1:12:27] madness how in the name of god
[1:12:30] could a minister have the key to your
[1:12:34] life
[1:12:37] god holds the key to your life as you
[1:12:40] look to him
[1:12:41] he revealed to you what you need to know
[1:12:43] further there is no place right
[1:12:46] there's no place in the world where
[1:12:47] priests are minister or such means
[1:12:48] reading gone people
[1:12:49] nor is there a place where they are
[1:12:50] separated in their worship of the lord
[1:12:53] god wants all to love and serve them
[1:12:55] together nikolaitism
[1:12:57] destroyed those precepts and instead
[1:13:01] separates the ministers from the people
[1:13:06] and makes the leaders overlords
[1:13:09] instead of sylvans that would repeat and
[1:13:12] again
[1:13:13] nikolaitism destroyed those precepts
[1:13:17] and instead separates the ministers and
[1:13:20] the people
[1:13:21] and make the leaders overlords instead
[1:13:23] of servants
[1:13:24] this doctrine started in the first age
[1:13:28] where and what you saw happen it appears
[1:13:31] that the problem lay in two words elders
[1:13:33] and overseers which were bishops those
[1:13:36] scriptures show
[1:13:37] that there are several elders in each
[1:13:39] church some began to teach
[1:13:41] that the idea of a bishop was one of
[1:13:44] preeminence or authority
[1:13:46] and control over the elders now the
[1:13:48] truth of the matter is the word elder
[1:13:51] signifies who the person is
[1:13:54] while the word bishop signifies the
[1:13:56] office of that same man
[1:13:58] the elder is the man the bishop is the
[1:14:02] office of the man
[1:14:03] the elder always has and always will
[1:14:05] refer
[1:14:06] simply to the man's chronological age in
[1:14:09] the lord
[1:14:09] he's an elder not because he's elected
[1:14:12] ordained
[1:14:13] but because he's older he is more
[1:14:15] seasoned
[1:14:16] trained not a novice reliable because of
[1:14:19] experience
[1:14:20] and long-standing proof of his christian
[1:14:22] experience but no
[1:14:23] the bishops did not stick to the epistle
[1:14:25] of paul but rather
[1:14:27] they went to paul's account so they take
[1:14:29] a paul story
[1:14:31] of the time he went and called the
[1:14:32] eldest of ephesus the military in acts
[1:14:34] 20
[1:14:35] in verse 17 the record state elders were
[1:14:37] called and then in verse 28
[1:14:39] they are called overseers bishops
[1:14:42] and these bishops no doubt political
[1:14:45] minded
[1:14:46] and anxious for power insisted
[1:14:49] that paul had given the meaning that
[1:14:52] overseers
[1:14:53] were more than local elder with the
[1:14:56] official capacity
[1:14:58] only in his own church to them bishop
[1:15:00] was not
[1:15:01] one with extended authority
[1:15:04] over many local leaders such concept
[1:15:08] apparently so the bishop that they took
[1:15:10] up was one
[1:15:11] not only over their own churches but
[1:15:13] over many local leaders
[1:15:15] such a concept was neither scriptural
[1:15:18] nor historical
[1:15:19] yet even a man of the statue of polycarp
[1:15:22] lean to what such organization
[1:15:23] but isaac spoke about that in his last
[1:15:25] surface
[1:15:26] thus what started as a deed in the first
[1:15:30] age
[1:15:31] was made a literal doctrine and so it is
[1:15:33] today
[1:15:34] bishops still claim power to control men
[1:15:37] and deal with them as they desire
[1:15:39] placing them where they
[1:15:41] so will in the ministry this denies the
[1:15:44] leadership
[1:15:44] of the holy ghost who said separate me
[1:15:47] paul and barnabas
[1:15:48] for the work we're into i have called
[1:15:51] him
[1:15:52] this is andy wood and antichrist
[1:15:55] and brother i'm quote this beautiful
[1:15:56] scripture matthew 20 verse 25 says
[1:15:59] and jesus called unto them and said you
[1:16:01] know so this is the
[1:16:02] next scripture that parallel to one i
[1:16:05] spoke early on
[1:16:06] you know that the princes of the
[1:16:07] gentiles exercise dominion over them
[1:16:10] and they that are a great exercise
[1:16:12] authority upon them
[1:16:13] but it shall not be so among you but
[1:16:16] whosoever will be great among you
[1:16:18] let him be your minister and whosoever
[1:16:20] will be chief among you
[1:16:22] let him be your servant even as
[1:16:25] the son of man came not to be ministered
[1:16:27] unto
[1:16:28] but a minister to give his life a ransom
[1:16:31] for many
[1:16:32] matthew 23 8-9 be not be called rabbi
[1:16:35] oh one is your master even christ your
[1:16:38] old brethren
[1:16:40] so in order to clarify
[1:16:43] you will recall in revelation 13 3 it
[1:16:45] said i saw one of the
[1:16:46] heads it was only to death and his
[1:16:48] deadly wound was healed we know he's a
[1:16:50] catholic church
[1:16:51] woman empire that head rose again
[1:16:54] she divided and conquered that was the
[1:16:56] seed of rome
[1:16:57] divide and conquer the iron teeth tore
[1:16:59] and evolved
[1:17:00] whom she tore and devoured could not
[1:17:02] rise again and as she destroyed
[1:17:04] carthage and sowed his heart assault the
[1:17:07] same
[1:17:08] iron seed remains in her when she arose
[1:17:11] as the false church
[1:17:13] and the policy has remained the same
[1:17:15] divide and conquer
[1:17:17] that is nikolaitism and god hits it
[1:17:22] now it is well known you know what if it
[1:17:25] wrap up now
[1:17:26] it is well known historical fact that
[1:17:29] when this error crept into the church
[1:17:31] men began to vie for the office of
[1:17:34] bishop
[1:17:35] where the result that this position was
[1:17:37] being given
[1:17:38] to the more educated materially
[1:17:41] progressive
[1:17:42] politically minded men human knowledge
[1:17:45] and program began to take over divine
[1:17:48] wisdom's place
[1:17:49] and the holy spirit no longer controlled
[1:17:52] this was indeed a tragic evil
[1:17:54] for the bishops began to maintain that
[1:17:57] is no longer
[1:17:58] required a transparent christian
[1:17:59] character to minister
[1:18:01] either the word or the right of the
[1:18:03] church for it was the elements and the
[1:18:05] ceremony had counted
[1:18:07] this allowed evil men see juices to
[1:18:09] render flock
[1:18:11] but man-made doctrine on the elevation
[1:18:13] of bishops
[1:18:14] to a place not according to them in the
[1:18:15] scripture the next step was the
[1:18:17] handling out of greedy titles that built
[1:18:20] up into religious hierarchy
[1:18:22] for soon there were archbishop over
[1:18:24] bishops cardinals over archbishops and
[1:18:26] by the time bonnie faced the third there
[1:18:28] was a pope
[1:18:29] overall all the pontiffs
[1:18:32] let me talk about message pope i'm
[1:18:35] closing this
[1:18:37] off let's come back to you the believers
[1:18:40] no a minister cannot bring a revival
[1:18:43] there is no preacher can bring a revival
[1:18:46] he doesn't pack it with him the only
[1:18:49] thing he can do is be loyal to god and
[1:18:51] to his word
[1:18:52] but the revival has to come by the
[1:18:55] people
[1:18:56] in your home and in your life and here
[1:18:59] you are right now tonight
[1:19:01] you are in your home and here's a
[1:19:03] prophecy hanging over you
[1:19:05] here's a direct word that a minister can
[1:19:08] revive no man of the hour no this one
[1:19:12] it takes revival enough to come by the
[1:19:15] people
[1:19:16] so i always believe that the vision of
[1:19:19] god
[1:19:20] has to be transferred to the people if i
[1:19:23] hold the vision
[1:19:24] and i am the man and the only man and
[1:19:26] whatnot
[1:19:27] what you have what you have to see
[1:19:30] when you get the revelation that you are
[1:19:33] the people of god
[1:19:34] hallelujah peculiar people come out all
[1:19:38] the darkness into this
[1:19:39] marvelous light where god put the keys
[1:19:41] in your hands
[1:19:42] to start a seventh on the revival right
[1:19:45] inside your house
[1:19:46] right inside your home even tonight even
[1:19:50] this week
[1:19:51] let us speak be a special week let
[1:19:53] tonight be a special night
[1:19:55] where the blessings of god could come
[1:19:56] upon your heart and life when you don't
[1:19:58] look
[1:19:58] inside and just look at yourself your
[1:20:00] failures your short comments your
[1:20:01] weakness
[1:20:02] but you look at the promise of god what
[1:20:03] we speak in the night is what god
[1:20:04] promised
[1:20:06] i you know one of the bible sessions i
[1:20:09] really enjoyed when it was
[1:20:11] um but isaac was speaking about
[1:20:13] neighborhood
[1:20:14] and jezebel and about rehab
[1:20:20] and he lusting after the man feel and
[1:20:23] jesus will come and
[1:20:24] set it up to kill the man to take me
[1:20:26] back for you and this god receiver is a
[1:20:28] just god
[1:20:30] that might matter be poor that might
[1:20:32] might mean no king assistant to no
[1:20:33] recognized person
[1:20:35] but because of the even wickedness god
[1:20:37] sent elijah
[1:20:38] to deal with that whole situation we say
[1:20:41] but just gone
[1:20:42] you go wrong you get in trouble and
[1:20:44] whatnot you repent that just god
[1:20:46] come to help you and deliver you because
[1:20:49] you're willing to repent
[1:20:50] you're willing to make things right
[1:20:51] you're willing to correct on the streets
[1:20:53] of your ways he said if my people
[1:20:54] whoever forget that
[1:20:55] shall humble themselves until i would
[1:20:57] heal the lamb
[1:20:59] is that man talking that is god talking
[1:21:02] god is just he wouldn't let this bride
[1:21:05] just
[1:21:05] suffer he going to bring her through and
[1:21:08] i'm telling you
[1:21:09] the one who started working you need to
[1:21:10] finish what you hear
[1:21:12] he's able to complete it give him
[1:21:13] praises tonight open your mouth and give
[1:21:15] god some praises
[1:21:16] we're going to be finishing here now
[1:21:18] brother branham

[1:25:49] you're not saying what paul's preached
[1:25:51] you're not saying what paul spoke
[1:25:53] you're there for your faults so these
[1:25:55] believers were anchored
[1:25:56] by the word that came out from paul's
[1:25:58] mouth because paul said if i angel come
[1:26:00] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[1:26:02] let them fly back then go back where you
[1:26:04] come from let them be a curse
[1:26:06] they were standing for the word and for
