[11:43] Father we thank you for your mercy and
[11:46] the grace you have extended to our lives

[11:56] but they don't and we pray help us
[11:59] tonight we thank you that in our hearts
[12:02] tonight there's a longing there a desire
[12:04] there a hungering a thirsting after
[12:06] righteousness father God may you st us
[12:09] up tonight as we prepare to pray in
[12:12] Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God
[12:15] bless you and thanks so much for being
[12:20] here I want to read two portion of
[12:22] scriptures from Luke chapter 18 1 verse
[12:25] verse
[12:26] one and also I wonder read
[12:29] psalms
[12:31] 42
[12:33] 1-3 Psalms 42
[12:36] 1-3 let's read Luke 18 verse1 Jesus
[12:41] talking about Jesus and he spake a
[12:43] parable unto this
[12:45] end that men ought always to pray and
[12:50] not to feain let me give that an
[12:53] emphasis that men ought always to pray
[12:57] and not to faint it says also Jesus told
[13:00] them a parable to the effect they ought
[13:03] always to pray and not to turn
[13:07] coward
[13:08] faint lose heart or give up Psalms 42
[13:15] 1-3 and David
[13:17] speaks as the heart panted after the
[13:21] water
[13:22] Brooks so panted my
[13:25] soul after thee Oh God my
[13:29] soul thirsted for God for the Living God
[13:35] When shall I come and appear before God
[13:39] my tears have been my meat day and night
[13:43] while they continually say unto me where
[13:45] is thy
[13:46] God and the Amplified it says as the
[13:50] heart PS and loans for the water broke
[13:54] so i pant and long for you oh God my
[13:58] inner self thirsts for God for the
[14:02] Living God When shall I come and behold
[14:05] the face of God my tears have been my
[14:08] full de and night why men say unto me
[14:11] all day long where is your god you know
[14:15] we were born in sin and shaping
[14:18] iniquity and we born we born having
[14:22] desires all of us different desires and
[14:26] you know I was reading something that
[14:27] the more desires people have is the more
[14:31] unfulfilled because you cannot fulfill
[14:33] all the desires you want to do this you
[14:35] want want to do that and you're speaking
[14:39] about I think it's Mari Curry and you
[14:41] have different people who work on
[14:43] diseases and getting Solutions and cures
[14:45] and like Albert Ein different
[14:48] ones they had few
[14:51] desires and because they had few
[14:55] desires they could be successful in a in
[14:58] a realm that made them
[15:02] Geniuses and the ultimate spot of Desire
[15:05] is when you have a single
[15:07] desire and that is what Jesus
[15:10] demonstrated a desire to please God a
[15:14] desire to do the will of God it happens
[15:17] that when people have a lot of
[15:19] desires they are
[15:22] unsatisfied they get angry quickly they
[15:26] calm down quickly up recently I was
[15:27] hearing somebody says about this person
[15:30] could curse you up and carry on and then
[15:33] next day if they need something from you
[15:35] they'll ask you normal normal as if they
[15:36] never did anything to you their
[15:40] emotional uh rhythm is up and down and
[15:43] in and out they are consumed by their
[15:46] own
[15:47] emotions it is hard for them to
[15:50] focus now John
[15:53] 737 Bible says in the last day that
[15:56] great day of the feast Jesus stood him C
[15:58] right saying if any man
[16:01] thirst let him come unto me and
[16:04] drink now a desire to
[16:08] drink and thirsting to drink is two
[16:11] different
[16:12] things and this is the point right here
[16:15] where I want to get to tonight talking
[16:17] about this
[16:20] desire many people know the Bible is
[16:24] right God is true God is not dead
[16:29] but they don't have a
[16:31] thirst
[16:33] and if tonight you don't have that
[16:36] desire or thirst I want to encourage you
[16:38] let's start right there with that you
[16:40] could pray God give you that desire and
[16:44] thirst Jesus even said blessed are they
[16:46] that hunger and thirst after
[16:48] righteousness that they shall be
[16:50] filled note he didn't say blessed are
[16:53] they that know the word blessed are they
[16:56] that you know understand understand the
[16:58] message understand the Bible no hunger
[17:02] and thirst and have to do
[17:04] with the
[17:05] heart condition what kind of heart you
[17:10] have when you hear somebody say I don't
[17:13] care watch them that's a dangerous
[17:18] person because the prophet taught us we
[17:21] care about the Milkman we care about the
[17:23] garbage man we care because we want to
[17:26] have respect we want to show God we have
[17:29] respect because God demands respect for
[17:33] his servants and his people and that why
[17:35] Jesus talk about don't bring offense you
[17:38] know don't go and trouble God's people
[17:40] or treat them badly because you could
[17:44] interfere with God and God will deal
[17:46] with
[17:47] that so understand when Jesus If any man
[17:51] thirst he was separating those who had
[17:55] an
[17:56] interest from those who had
[17:59] a
[18:01] desire now a desire dictionary desire is
[18:04] a
[18:05] urge it's a
[18:07] longing it's a
[18:09] craving it's a thirst it's a
[18:13] hunger it's a passion it's an
[18:18] appetite it's a
[18:20] un you see when David said I was glad
[18:23] when they said unto me let us go in the
[18:25] house of the Lord you could see David
[18:28] with excitement you could see David with
[18:30] enthusiasm David can't see that and walk
[18:32] his Le you know why he is ined about
[18:37] going into the house of God he's
[18:40] committed he is an excitement for him
[18:42] it's a joy for
[18:44] him do you have that
[18:47] Joy when Anthony s longing for Jesus I
[18:50] have a longing for him he didn't know
[18:52] what I was going to share tonight but I
[18:54] just connected to that song about having
[18:56] a strong dis desire a longing a
[19:02] craving there are people who craving for
[19:04] other people husband other people
[19:07] wife there are people craving for other
[19:09] people's
[19:10] job there are people lusting for what
[19:13] they don't
[19:15] have and it brings emptiness on the
[19:19] inside because The Thirst that God put
[19:22] within us that a desire is to be filled
[19:25] not with money popularity woman wine and
[19:27] song but is to be filled with
[19:30] him the devil throws things into US upon
[19:34] us to quench that thirst to quench that
[19:38] desire and when David said as the heart
[19:41] pant after the water book so my soul
[19:43] pant after the Living God but theam
[19:47] dramatized that as the heart being
[19:50] wounded and running for its life because
[19:53] the animal is behind it and if it only
[19:56] get that drink of water it will get
[20:00] revived and if there's a hour when we
[20:03] need to be revived is now we need to get
[20:05] revived one two and stay revived because
[20:09] listen everything going to fight the
[20:12] Revival everything going to fight your
[20:14] passion for God everything will will
[20:16] fight your thirst for God that's why it
[20:18] have if not movies it have sports if not
[20:20] Sports it have all kind of things to
[20:23] take up your time friends but have
[20:25] friends is Facebook is Facebook is
[20:27] WhatsApp is this
[20:28] the devil makes sure the options are so
[20:31] vast and wi that he could keep you
[20:34] busy not in God's plan or program but I
[20:37] say this way doing your own
[20:39] thing the problem is we could actually
[20:43] live a fairly successful life without
[20:45] God and without prayer because this is
[20:48] how God set it up you don't need to talk
[20:51] to him you need to call upon him but
[20:52] there's a reason that he placed this
[20:55] thing that men ought to pray and not to
[20:58] faint in other words don't give up don't
[21:01] be weak don't be a coward regardless of
[21:04] how the situation I know a sister what
[21:06] was drinking and a drunk and she prayed
[21:09] for 20 something years and eventually he
[21:12] was saved both of them going on to be
[21:14] with the Lord now but it shows that
[21:17] prayer works and sometimes because we
[21:19] don't see our prayer in operation we get
[21:22] frustrated we feel to give up we feel no
[21:24] longer it doesn't matter God know all
[21:27] things and we throw everything up into
[21:29] heaven and we leave it up to God it
[21:31] doesn't work that way Jesus in teaching
[21:33] them to pray said thy will be done on
[21:35] Earth as it is in heaven so somehow
[21:39] Heaven and Earth have to connect in a
[21:41] way where we understand our prayer
[21:44] actually have a connection with things
[21:47] operational in
[21:49] heaven and to prove that the prophet
[21:53] said that when Daniel was praying and
[21:55] the angel was coming if Daniel stopped
[21:57] praying the angel to stop coming so
[22:00] prayer was an effect in affecting things
[22:05] at in the Heavenly realm the Bible call
[22:08] it the prayers of the Saints the Bible
[22:10] call it like our prayers like incense
[22:13] they light some incense in your house or
[22:15] some sweet smelling something and it
[22:16] perfume the house or you you spray
[22:18] something in your room and it smell nice
[22:21] and so like that right well this is what
[22:24] prayer comes in the nostrils of
[22:26] God
[22:30] desire comes before
[22:33] prayer desire goes after
[22:37] prayer desire follows
[22:41] prayer without
[22:43] desire we just going through form we
[22:46] mumbling words we just saying
[22:49] things desire is
[22:52] silent that's in the
[22:54] heart prayer is
[22:56] heard
[22:58] prayer is a verbal expression of
[23:02] Desire I need help oh God you are my
[23:06] help you are my rock you are my shield
[23:09] you are my strong and mighty tower David
[23:11] said I look unto the hills for when
[23:13] cometh my help my help comes from the
[23:16] Lord
[23:18] desire is what goes before prayer
[23:22] Hebrews 1166 says
[23:24] this but without
[23:26] faith it is impossible to please it here
[23:30] we go part when get toight for he that
[23:33] come to God like tonight like
[23:36] tonight you I all of us for he that
[23:41] cometh to
[23:43] God must believe he
[23:46] is and that he is a
[23:49] rewarder for them that diligently seek
[23:53] him or energetically seek him or
[23:56] enthusiastically seeking or passionately
[24:01] seeking God want you to know he
[24:07] rewards did you get
[24:09] that he is a
[24:11] rewarder of them that diligently
[24:16] seeking Jesus said it even this way pray
[24:20] to the father who SE it in the secret
[24:22] and the father who e in secret shall
[24:26] reward you openly in other
[24:29] words the blessings of God would be seen
[24:33] upon you the blessings of God will be
[24:37] evident around you are you willing to
[24:40] get there
[24:42] tonight so prayer is asking
[24:45] God prayer have to be
[24:49] expressed I believe the deeper the
[24:52] desire is stronger the pray the prayer
[24:56] to pray
[24:58] there we go whether we feel like it or
[25:01] not so if you're not feeling to pray you
[25:04] still pray you pray regardless you pray
[25:07] past your fears you pray past your
[25:09] doubts you pray you're reaching
[25:13] out so if you don't have that desire
[25:15] tonight or don't have the intensity of
[25:18] that desire tonight ask God because God
[25:21] can increase your
[25:22] desire and with your desire you can
[25:26] increase in prayer won't be long
[25:28] a short
[25:29] explation let me say that again so if
[25:33] you don't have that desire you're
[25:35] watching people in church you're
[25:36] watching people elsewhere and they say
[25:38] know that one blessed that one blessed
[25:40] and you don't even know how they're
[25:41] being blessed you don't even know what
[25:44] sacrifice that they're making behind the
[25:45] scenes you don't even know the channel
[25:48] of prayer because of the desire and the
[25:50] thirst for God and you know what says
[25:53] usually people who yeah it takes a
[25:56] burden to pray and usually those people
[25:58] who pray gets the burden so it's like
[26:01] how to say it like a cycle you pray you
[26:03] get a burden and then you get a burden
[26:05] it gives your unction to pray no burden
[26:08] no prayer a light superficial life full
[26:12] of desires it remind me of how the Bible
[26:14] talk about silly woman Laden with
[26:17] diverse lust ever learning and never com
[26:22] to the knowledge of the truth hear in
[26:23] this they hear in that hear in that it
[26:26] is here there every
[26:29] never really focused note the right
[26:33] Brothers even this guy El musk all the
[26:36] people that has great achievements have
[26:38] been people who have been
[26:40] focused they focus on a certain thing
[26:43] they can't have all kind of crazy
[26:44] desires because you cannot be Ting
[26:48] yourself out with trying to fulfill this
[26:50] and fulfill that and D why Jesus himself
[26:53] says my meat is to do the will of him
[26:55] that sent me and to finish the work it
[26:57] was specific God in service to die gold
[27:01] frankincense and Mer the gifts of the
[27:03] wise men identify Jesus purpose you have
[27:07] a purpose where is your
[27:09] purpose do you think about that have you
[27:12] asked God about that it come make
[27:15] somebody interested in a wife what and
[27:17] they wouldn't pray and you pick up some
[27:19] kind of thing and then there a
[27:20] problematic
[27:21] afterwards these things are serious
[27:23] things and Jesus they going and pick up
[27:26] no no body for bride he want a bride
[27:30] that is qualified flesh of his flesh
[27:32] bone of his bone so in our hearts we
[27:35] must want God's desire all right so let
[27:39] wrap up again
[27:42] get first Thessalonians 5:17 says pray
[27:45] without
[27:46] ceasing that's a command in other words
[27:50] don't let nothing stop you from praying
[27:53] said it this way we could sing too much
[27:54] talk tooo much laugh too much eat too
[27:56] much but we can never pray
[27:58] so praying is the will of God and we
[28:02] know this story and I want to close with
[28:04] this
[28:07] here don't be formal in
[28:10] praying no feeling no real desire no
[28:13] heart ined it just going through the
[28:16] emotions and Jesus encountered this with
[28:18] the Scribe and the Pharisees he hated it
[28:21] they was just going through motions
[28:23] formality so when they saw the discip
[28:25] wasn't washing their hands that a big
[28:27] issue with them because how come your
[28:29] disciples not doing this and this foral
[28:32] so when Jesus came they were wrapped in
[28:36] message
[28:38] formality they were met wrapped with
[28:40] thoughts and traditions of the elders
[28:43] and Jesus was a child or a son or a
[28:46] youth of that time and he wasn't
[28:48] bothering with the with the with the
[28:50] teachings of the elders or what the
[28:52] elders Tau about it he said if you
[28:54] believe Moses they going to believe me
[28:56] you know words faith was going to point
[28:58] you to a living expression of God not no
[29:02] dead letter
[29:05] word all right so men ought to pray and
[29:09] not to F maybe I could just close up
[29:12] this one here and there one we know when
[29:15] God told Isaiah Hezekiah and and Isaiah
[29:19] told him thus here the Lord set that
[29:21] house in order Thou shalt not die Thou
[29:23] shalt die and not live then he turned
[29:26] his face to the wall and PR unto the
[29:27] Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord now
[29:30] this is a man that accustom talking to
[29:33] God this is a man that know how to
[29:36] pray the God come and say you shall not
[29:38] live but you will die and he say okay
[29:42] bring the box no he decid to turn his
[29:45] face to the wall and pray unto the Lord
[29:47] saying I beseech you oh Lord remember
[29:50] now how I have walk before thee in truth
[29:53] and with a perfect heart so this man has
[29:56] some money and have done that which is
[29:58] good in thy sight this is from 2 Kings
[30:01] 20 reading from
[30:04] 1-6 and I've done and he said she said I
[30:07] beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I
[30:09] have walked before thee in truth and
[30:11] with a perfect heart and have done that
[30:13] which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah
[30:15] WEP
[30:16] so so it was not his head talking his
[30:19] heart was there he was broken it came to
[30:23] pass a four Isaiah was going in the
[30:26] middle court
[30:28] that the word of the Lord came to him
[30:29] saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the
[30:34] captain of my people thus say the Lord
[30:37] the god of David thy father I have heard
[30:41] thy prayer I have seen thy
[30:45] tears behold I will heal thee on the
[30:50] third day and thou shall go into the
[30:54] house of the
[30:55] Lord what a blessing it will be
[30:59] tonight in Simplicity for God to come
[31:02] down in your home and tell you I have
[31:05] heard thy
[31:07] prayer but what if he not
[31:11] praying what will he hear or you think
[31:14] about
[31:15] that
[31:17] desire should drive you to prayer prayer
[31:21] is a verbal expression don't sit down in
[31:23] your house or KNE long and you have
[31:25] nothing to say you could talk to Aunt
[31:27] your uncle your sister your brother you
[31:29] could talk to this one on the phone talk
[31:31] to this one on WhatsApp and when you
[31:32] come to the lord it's like you're run
[31:34] out you're M tired you don't know what
[31:37] to
[31:38] say I am saying to you you have to be
[31:42] able to have an expression to God that
[31:45] he could come and said I have heard your
[31:48] prayer you have enemies pray for them
[31:52] you have family pray for them you have
[31:54] loved ones pray for them you have people
