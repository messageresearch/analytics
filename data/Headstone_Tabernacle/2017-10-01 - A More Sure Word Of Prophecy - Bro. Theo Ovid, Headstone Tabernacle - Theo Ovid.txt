John chapter 1 we want to be from 29 to 37 2nd Peter chapter 1 warning from 16 to 21 and said mark chapter 16 15 to 20 oh praise God just keep remembering prayer for those believers that importer rico who after two weeks now like new lights and water and everything else it's terrible situation we trust Court be their guide and comfort and help and shield amen praise God so read ins in John chapter 1 verse 29 the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me come at a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but he that should meet manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and be a record that this is the Son of God again the next day after John stood and two other disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked he said behold the lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus second Peter one wanna read from verse 16 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we would he were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you may take heed as unto a light that shine it in the dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost last scripture we're gonna have mark 16 was 15 to 20 Jesus is speaking and he said unto them going into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he has received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following him and they got blessed his word you may be seated oh praise God hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord blessed be the name of the Lord there's a song I sing true hallelujah true I learn to trust in God you love it true it all I learned to depend upon his word [Music] so what you can do well I thank God for the mountains I got for the valleys and got for the teens I'll be true if I never have a problem or if I never had I never know that God can sum them I never know what fee in this word can the swabby sag true blew it all milah trust trust in Jesus alert trust in God true Oh to him are you going to depend upon his word this morning [Applause] praise God this morning our title a title is a more sure word of mercy a more sure word of prophecy of a subject changing from the Prophet to the prophecy another an inspiration the Lord Himself oh praise God the Lord Himself of a context scripture and you're not to find it is on 1st Thessalonians 4 it says but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep talking about people that have died on and go on before loved ones that we sorrow we sorrow not as others who have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which alive remains shall not hinder them or prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord comfort one another with these words comfort one another with these words this is not the only world we are leaving here ready or not this is not the only world we're gonna be out of here oh praise the name of the Lord that's how I feel left our sake soon we'll be out of here a thousand years is as one day in a sight so 70s SB it's like a myth Oh hallelujah your feet are here for a long time right you're not here for a long time hallelujah so do what you're supposed to do when you have the strength to do it do all that you can do right because they choose to do right when others do you're wrong still right forgive because you choose to forgive love when the hate you still know when you feel that only service still do it do what's right do what's good do what true amen given a contract or give the Lord some praise as people hallelujah glory to God this is brother Branham for message experiences you know when the angel of the Lord speaks like that there is nothing can stand before it it is absolute my faith will I know it's going to happen there's no need of seeing any more of it it's got to happen if that person had been dead and in the grief of twenty years and he said Gordon and speak I believe all ever would shake out of its orbit before that prayer would be refused from being answered God will do it though that is really when it is dusty at the Lord so when a word is pronounced over your life Tashia the Lord I don't care what the doctors say what your mother said what your father said what the neighbor said what the boss say it has nothing to do not even your sin to stop it it's us here the Lord your failures can stop it your fears your weakness gosh stop it what happened last night last year last twenty years nothing gonna stop it he said this word he said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I set it forth to accomplish could be gives a lot of praise offering [Music] hallelujah when we come to these meetings I detect vibrations sometimes I can ask the vibrations and God will honor my prayer he will send it away that's true but if there's anything between you and God and you don't make it right it's your feet that is weak you're just waiting for a slow line for that to be cast away now if your feet isn't right it will return right back to you I have moved out to a place for I prayed for them and I've kept this back from you but I pray for them coming to the line and set them down somewhere and walk back in 15 minutes time to check them and I'll be back on them again so in the spirit realm what a man has talked about praying for people and tell them sit right in it it leaves them 15 minutes is a check is back on them again your feet is the only thing that can do you any good your belief your faith in God see what I mean without fear is impossible is that true no you believe it with all your heart and when you come true you're going to be well and you will get well if you don't believe it it won't get well no matter what happens you won't be healed unless you believe it with all your heart oh praise God how many one to believe this morning with all your heart what can heal your body what can you your spirit and God can heal your soul could somebody say Amen I want to see that here again because I'm your sick second buddy second spirits they can mind second half

praise the rock is done right and praise God let's serve it up and look 22:32 Jesus told Peter the devil wanna see if you like wheat but I prayed for you that's your faith filner because fear is the currency that purchase everything from God not your long tears not your land and beaten up that doesn't move God if you have faith behind the tears that's fine if you have your emotions that is also fine but the thing I'm gonna move God is your faith when God look in the answer you look at the currency of go on you're serving the Lord I can do with that you could be whatever once you have faith

that's make you his subjects and the whole thing is God Himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled that is what that is the whole thing the people say interpretation I'm speaking here not long ago in a meeting among several Brannen you have the wrong interpretation you don't interpret that right we go to the Methodist say the Baptist or interpret it right the pinnacles are doing and so one is gonna song God is his own interpreter he don't need anybody to interpret for him he does his own interpreter isn't that right no Peter said when God said let there be light and there was light that's interpretation to it when God said anything it was manifested then that is God's in repetition so that the Quarian question too much just see what God said and see how its interpreted right now people agony over scripture over words and so for over dictionary and Greek and all that but that is not clear manifestation the manifestation is the interpretation so that is where the seed which is you come into being oh praise the name of the Lord so God does need anybody interpreted when God speaks and it's manifested that's the interpretation of his word but before it is manifested he sends out it as a prophecy a footage shall conceive is hang in there four hundred years staying right there they could read it they're speaking it it's got to come to pass that prophecies written for Mary that prophecy is sickling Haller that prophecy can drop down until Mary come on the scene when Mary come the prophecy hangs over Mary where does she go the prophecy going that's the version she's got ready when she's nine years old she's not ready when she's 11 years old she's has to be ready when she's ready shame and somebody and when you are ready you are ready for your prophecy which is your word there's a prophecy for you or do you believe that do you believe there's a prophecy for you so when Mary time came means I had the company have to come not the Joan not the John look at this one on that one Mary Hail Mary that was highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women you have been elected you are being selected loving chosen to bring forth Messiah there's only one Mary there's only one bride there's only one you give the Lord some praise as people [Music] now interesting Trinidadian get nothing you know the other translate with me

Sewell Azul and Jesus is in lane here breaking - I am Jesus a general who I know ordinary man but two years old 12 years 18 years of silence from 12 to 8 18 years of Jesus in the scriptures no science no wonders no vindication no fire no nothing just an ordinary man and he's just walking down to the Jordan John see him unless that I have need to be baptized as a because you see the sign the sign said there's one upon whom see the spirit descending and remaining that's the one the less free-spirited jump on because I'm not a wolf an idiot at this rate rock rock chip threat go on so you're looking for something that remains that's Jesus it remains on the lam it remains when I see faith virtue knowledge temperance patience cotton is public kindness charity the love of God the token the spirit dynamics the capital of remain that's a house that's a temple that's the cap or give the lots of praises people hallelujah let's go a little further my so long is it all you say when God makes a promise he is lots of this would teach each what and God always sends on the scene down to the Old Testament new prophets on the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet and how does it do it it manifests the Word of God God's manifestation tells when it is right or wrong nobody has interpreted the word interprets itself God promised it and they it happens notice here from C the discrepancy an angel in verse 14 the two-spirited be so close and last days he could not depend upon some signature to separate them so he said the angels to separate them an angel is coming to bring the separation between right and wrong and no one can do that but the angel of the Lord notice he said the swords were and what the seed was the saw was the son of God who enforce wind seed an enemy came behind him which has a devil and saw the sea of discrepancy so this is a different problem now from the skiers and it's not ets the choking of the seed and so on for them and good groans and so on this is different this is where the Son of man saw the seed and the enemy came and so seed in the field and then boat jump up looking for in the fall and then I'm one sec shall we cut down no no leave them alone leave them alone and grow together until time a Havas let them grow together let them shout and say Amen together until the time of harvest isn't that right Oh Chloe no the seed of God the Word of God the word is a seed and every singer before of this kind now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the age that they're living in so he is prophesied the children will become the seed and that money cheering becomes the word so you becomes the word no you can understand how the spirit and the bank will see come because the brain will be the width and the spirit will come upon the prey to give the rider voice there Brian have to be given a voice not just

prophesied about the calming voice or cloning of God hallelujah you will see the appearing of the Lord right here among us live Allah see signs one of the Merkel I can't stop it you can't stop it no man could stop it God's pocket so shall it be oh right no you on the prophecy all these yes your common is not in vain we have to be leaders no no we have a sword a prophecy we have to believe in them it shall surely come to pass Oh glory not caught in an but Noah came he was the seed of one of the of God the wood for each when Moses came he could not come at Moses noise message he wouldn't work he was a seasoned that time now we have lived to loot as H Westley H Pentecostal age each age has his promise and the people of the age that Manny says that promise word is the cedar age so our ears have a word of brotherly kindness forgiveness that must be manifested not just revealed but manifested the people have manifests that but we love the other seed of the edge because brother love is the thing that attract the Holy Ghost that's right right after brotherly kindness is that floodwall Holy Spirit and even when a woman is gonna bring birth giving birth to our baby in the book we tell you read thing that had to be he's a sweet spirit comes around a woman because she's about to get another spirit for that baby Oh holic she said I don't know mean the woman is all evil a woman is when

the Holy Spirit operating true his children is those seeds of the kingdom of that age a manifestation of the Holy Spirit upper region and the Holy Spirit cannot behave in one person and misbehave in another the Holy Spirit makes you conform to its nature to its behavior one of the signs of the Holy Spirit is somebody able to repent and make things right and humble themselves the first sign of the Holy Ghost is humility like you fighting up and carrying on the prove your point and defeat and argue the prove all right you are know and the Holy Spirit come it makes you humble yourself isn't that right what abandom says the date last day the true bride will come to the headstone will be a super race as she nears a headstone they will be much like him so much like him that they were being his

brother Branham said the seven mysteries watch has done in here the seven thunders I was forbidden John who the voices and the book was sealed I skipped on this watch in other words the mission gotta be finished in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God will reveal and when that was completely revealed then seven mysteries would open to the church because India here we go the church is his prophecy would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out showing his signs of being alive among us and then we are worshiping the Living Christ that's among us that's the prophecy there was no argument for that the manifestation of that will be the interpretation or Chloe does call them seven thunders that's
