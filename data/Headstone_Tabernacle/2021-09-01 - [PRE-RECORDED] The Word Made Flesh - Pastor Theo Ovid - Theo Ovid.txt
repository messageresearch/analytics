god we are grateful to be here this morning we are privileged to be called in this last time while the whole world is surrounded by this coronavirus and its environment and all the things connected with it you are calling and preparing an anointing and inspiring a bride for jesus christ father i pray this morning you will come down in a special way and speak life lord speak life until your

miracle your honda power move here this morning heal them in their spirit heal them in their body heal them in your souls may there be a restoration father may it be a tortured and complete deliverance father middle seraphs with a course among the altar with fire from of the altar but those seraphs he sent in here this morning i mean your word that's invisible become visible to the people this morning confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name ask it amen and amen god bless you it's so good to be here this morning and see all of you out and this morning we want to go straight into the scriptures i it's in john chapter one i want to read verse one and then we go verse 10 to 14 uh from one book reading from this morning o praise the name of the lord i um okay saint john chapter one we're going to read first verse and then we go down to verse 10. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god verse 10. he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as receive him to them give you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwell among us we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's buy it one more time father these are weighted words and this is what was in the beginning lord and the word became flesh father may you come among us this morning and take me out of the way and may spirit spoken would be spoken granted lord and jesus may ask it amen you may be seated praise god this morning our title the word made flesh with made flesh of a subject three realms humanistic divine revelation and vision another inspiration the invisible become invisible now [Music] let's go so i i know sometimes people find or say it's a bit short or whatnot but what you get is concentrated stuff um i try not to have wasted words and and in the light of the timing that we have have been allowed we try to keep everything compact we have no we will to waste and no time to kill butler branham he's talking about preparation before we go to fight a war we have to prepare for that war if you're going to get married while you prepare for that time you have to have preparations before you come to church you made preparations he says and god is always he always prepares the people for the offense that just about to happen and may i stop here a minute and i believe that the people are in preparation for the last great destruction this world has ever known they are in the spirit of the last days and god here we go cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction so in other words before you could even get into the coming of the lord you have to get in the spirit of the coming of the lord just as the people have to get in their spirit you have to get into your spirit that's how we know that time is drawing near not because something happened in america or happening in south america or happened in europe or some place no but because you're getting in the spirit and that is witness to you that you are nearing the coming of the lord oh glory to god so before destruction could be effected the people that they get in the spirit of rejoice destruction because destruction itself is a seed that was sown and came on the mount of a prophet hallelujah los angeles sinking is a word that came on the mount of the prophet and there's a rain to fall upon that seed for that to be manifested and your word also came on the mote of a prophet and your word gonna remain manifest in your season in your time that's why you couldn't miss it if you try you had to be here this morning this is a special service oh glory to god this is a special time oh glory to god you hear what i said this is a special service you're in this morning oh glory to god hallelujah you don't know what's going to happen in this service you don't know what god decreed for this service let me say it again you don't know what god decreed for you being here in this service this morning but one thing i could guarantee you he said my word shall not return unto me void one thing i can guarantee you god will never speak a word that cannot bring it to pass he is not a man that would lie every word that come out of his mouth must be fulfilled [Applause] your word of healing your word of deliverance your word of sealing your word of life is i come that you might have life and have it more abundantly [Applause] all right let's go if we know the word we know where we are living we know the hour that we're living in we know what lays ahead we see what we have passed and the book of god is the revelation and then his promises as is to come so all of his promises are true god cannot speak any word without it being confirmed so his word must be confirmed he says so shall my word be that god out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void i don't know how long it take it can't return on me boy i am talking about the god that brought the flood i'm talking about the god that opened the red sea i'm talking about the god that tell moses take the blood and apply it and when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over i'm talking about that god that came down in the pillar of fire that is 20th century prophet to speak the same of the lord there's going to be a pride your past can stop it your failures can stop it [Applause] you are going to be delivered you are going to be healed and you're going to be sealed too glory glory glory ah i wanted to receive every word this morning we leave everywhere this morning we had a powerful promethean on friday we're sharing with them that faith levels the playing field you don't have to be educated to have faith you don't have to be a degree to have faith you don't have to have come here any pulpit to have faith you don't have to be an elder a dignity officer to have faith a prostitute could come inside your fate the centurion was not christian but he had faith only speak the word of my servant shall be healed them leprous wasn't christians but they had faith don't tell me you don't have it you come this morning it said you opened your door this morning it said you went into the car oh glory to god you're here by faith this morning you're praising my faith this morning you have faith [Applause] okay just like your boat just like you're both here god knew you would be here and now you know even things that your parents done now people think that isn't visited from generation generation but it is you own hebrews paul said abraham paid tithes to melchizedek when he was returning from the slaughter of the king and he said levi who was in the loins of abraham when he met merchandise coming from the slaughter and he was reckoned that levi paid tights and levi was two generations do you think god not concerned about you you know how god sees you this morning as the seed of the righteous knowing that the serpent seeds on the earth all them evil wicked spirits in flesh walk in the earth looking for bring about destruction and god see gross darkness cover the earth covering the people but light coming to you in such a time as this there shall be no frogging face there should be a thanksgiving and a praise to god for his mercy and his grace [Applause] let me see he reckoned levi paying tight also when he was in the loans of abraham his great great grandfather and he visit the sins of the people upon their children from generation to generation that won't keep his word what about her blessings from generation to generation you were all preplanned by god don't watch me say amen you believe that nothing happened by chance [Music] nothing nothing romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them what he called according to his purpose oh glory to god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned for many generations so you could be here tonight did you know that [Music] so god saw my grandchildren before i was born that's a big one let me say that again god saw my grandchildren before i was born so god knew you would be here today god arranged all your life to bring you to the spot today [Applause] and you're going to hear why now watch let's continue just think about that at one time you was in your father in the dream of your father he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but then you see you were put in the bedding ground in the womb of a mother to holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father and then you have fellowship now that's the only way you can be a son or daughter of god because you have to be to have it in a life and there's only one from eternal life and that's god's life there's only one from eternal life that's god so to be a son of god you have to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god that's what you are this morning i don't care if your mother was a prostitute and the father was a drunkard i didn't have your grandfather was this and whatever it is god predestinated you to come forth as a gene on the earth a gene of god all kind of conditions he disguise you so satan wouldn't recognize to cut you off before time you were beaten pan you were hidden smoking drinking devil thought was you was one of his family only to find out when the world hit you you have to stagger out of what you're in to stagger into the world itself like that great mother eager you always was an eagle there never was a chicken even though he was in the chicken bun he had but when that mother eager scream over you something in you start to praise god hallelujah [Applause] you are expressed and after his word comes into you to light up this age you are expressing good life in you because you are son and daughter of god therefore you get what i mean you are now mead you are setting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate and wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever have eternal life it always was eternal life and god before the foundation of the world knew you that you would be here and when the word or the water or the washing of the water of the world fell on you it was expressed in a being i know you are fellowship with your father god just as you have with your earthly father you are children sons and daughters of god let us strike you this morning not son of your father and mother natural sons and daughters of the living god he said whose son am i now hallelujah i was the son of charles and elle branham but who shall am i now oh glory to god i'm a gene of god a thought of god that must be expressed by the word of god or give the lord a shout do you see who we are this morning you are a gene thought that must be expressed by the word you can't come to connect with nothing else let me be seated here we go jesus was the fullness of god manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore are you ready when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh you were in him then because he was the word and in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so your genetic connection was there in the beginning when the word came and that word came and become flesh oh glory to god hallelujah you were locked up in him let's continue hallelujah the word of the flesh therefore you walk with him when you were in him when he was on earth you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and you are risen with him all glory to god what a fear to take a hold upon that your flesh can't hold up you know because your flesh declares what is in the humanistic realm [Music] it's just only three realms you know the first realm is where people really live the human is sick realm frustrated husband frustrated wife first with the neighbor quarrel carry on and victorious one upset with this one and get in a situation and you can't handle it and you're fed up and what like this is humanistic that is that god program when when they issue the commandment that everybody have to come into the city to take census and mary pregnant with joseph they had a choice i ain't bothering with the government i don't care what he got men see if they had gone that way where jesus was going to be born because jesus wasn't in position according to scripture and to get him in position herod had to call taxation and and sign up and write up and and check up on all that so joseph had to take mary and check the donkey and get down into bethlehem because the bible said out of bethlehem you're not hearing me this morning are you hearing me this morning nothing is by chance oh god i have to rock this here god had to send orders here god had to level it here it's not about herod it's about you okay the lord has shout it's not about no press and the world comes to the churches this is about the bride of jesus christ [Applause] glory he said setting in heavenly places already raised resurrected to new life settling in heavenly places in christ he said that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in jesus christ now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds if you are attribute of god the other comedy baptist methodist pentecostal you're calling by creed you can't be like to our father entry healing you can live like that because you could only connect to the world that is why jesus could boldly say all that the father had given me shall come and satan had to take her in the pipe and smoke it because he cannot stop all that the father had already given so you are not no coming to the lord wake up this morning he foreknew you that's why he called you in otherwise he was thinking about you before that is why things are pre-planned and god arranged oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah is almighty god that arranged that my mother get baptized at the age of 92. whatever age after being a catholic for all these years but she knew hallelujah that one day she had to hit the waters and when that time come she hit the waters and you know what she did she until none of the other family members because she knew they all thought that was going to come so they were stunned when she hit the waters and get baptized in jesus name but god arranged all of that he will confound the wise and the prudent all glory to god hallelujah he will take the weak things to confront the things that are strong all glory to god he will take the people that doesn't look like his people and make them his people here's why he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him to dare me give power power forward to become the sons of god oh we are not trinidadians we are sons and daughters of the living god [Applause] [Music] maybe seated therefore we must be that word bride what is that word bride what is that word by question the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that has been expressed in this hour that we are now living in oh my god so he said it in the beginning was the word and the word was with god he said in the beginning was elohim an elohim became the word and the word was elohim and the word was made elohim that is him unfolding so elaine was what self-existent one was even god yet he alone could be self-existent function of spirit but then he projected himself into the logos word and that word is what came in the beginning and in the beginning god said let there be let there be he couldn't do anything else but speak because a word is a taught express so therefore the thought had to be created by the word so you can't just think it you have to express it and that's where the word coming to speak it oh glory to god hallelujah so in him was taught he wanted to become material oh glory to god you can't see material that material he was thoughts could you see a thought no it has to become material and the the channel become materialist by by coming through the channel of the word so the thought is here in the mind of god in the intelligence of god in the awesomeness of god in the invisibility of god but that invisibility that thinking have to have a channel by which it could come because he wanted to become material this was his burden how could i come from thought where they can't see me as invisible that i could become visible so he had to use the channel of the word and when he pressed his way and become loma's word that word became flesh nobody could handle him now we could see him now he he can be touched oh glory oh forgive me this morning he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities [Music] what our loving god we have what a savior we have he didn't say mysterious all sealed up in the back on stage in heaven he came down himself to become one of us oh glory to god hallelujah praise god isn't that something else but the name was thoughts he wanted to become material what did he do then he spoke a word and the word was materialized and hear this that's the whole picture from genesis to revelation that's the bible there there's nothing wrong is elohim materializing so he can be touched and feel so now we find out god and o people god so he know that we will come to the place to read write a repetition so he put the word in print that we could catch the word and find where age is written but that is not god's purpose to stay in print no he always wanted to become material a virgin shall conceive that's on print because that came with him out of a prophet but when god say a virgin shall conceive and that was put on print god always knew was mary he knew her name he knew her village she knew her city she knew he knew what generation she would be born in she know he know who will be married parents so when he said virginia conceived is already done in his thinking but in the unfolding of it it took a time for the history to be unfolded so that word could only circle the earth until mary came on the scene and once mary stepped on the scene nobody else could pick that up that power that revelation that inspiration only one woman could pick that up and this bride come on now you oh them seven thunders glory the god is only one woman on the earth could pick up the exclusive bright promises but american preacher ton lord of stuff people could preach anything they want to preach but there are some exclusive promises for this bride of jesus christ and we pump in one to you this morning an exclusive promise where the word will become flesh and whose flesh come and give the lord whose flesh your flesh my flesh your own flesh i ain't talking about in your head i am talking about in your flesh i am talking about in your head and your heart and your flesh and your flesh itself oh glory to god this word we are preaching is going to when the blending tire with us call it again synchronized oh um forget is the word is used vulcanize yeah this will go to vulcanize with you afterwards when people bunch of the bunks in the wood oh glory to god when you lay hands upon people is the word lame hands if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover oh glory to god after a while you have supernatural escorts because angels associate themselves with you to protect you a long life's journey no devil can move unless you get permission to move nothing could stop you no weapon form against you could prosper oh god god put the hedge around you oh glory to god because there is a purpose for your life no car coming the bombshell no roofing falling on your head you're dying by no accident what give the lord our prayers offering oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah be too fat on the road there will be no mistakes may be seated so watch who am i in the millennium elohim would be honest sitting on the throne and all his subjects around him he brought the estimated before the front of the world he said like a man building chimes to make chimes the moulder each bell had to have a certain ring from the other the same material but so much iron so much steel so much brass to make it to give it the thing and that's the way here we go that's the comparison that's the way god did he bred this one to that one to that one this one until he get exactly what he wanted and that's how we come down god unveiled himself in a pillow fire down to the prophets then into the son of god which was god see it's the same god bringing out exactly it was the same god formed in a man called a prophet and the word of the lord came to this man so it wasn't the prophet the prophet was the veil but the word was god the prophet was what the veil but the word was god so there the bible said let every seed bring forth after this kind is that right and the sea was in the earth right and there was darkness upon the earth but the spirit of god prevented brood over the seas all glory to god so he brewed over the prophets he pulled over moses he put over sect he keep brewed and he keeps brewed and he keeps prudent until finally one came that he blew over and that was jesus christ that was the perfect son of god oh what was he doing he's trying to bring back the image that was lost in the garden of eden because when adam was standing that perfect image the whole image fell up it fell on the ground so god began to brood bring back you have set replace enable and keep it going down one after the other of the other or glory to god what he's doing he's coming back to the image and when jesus came he was the statue of a perfect man the image and likeness at last was restored by the second adam this second atom was not going to fall this second atom was not going to fail out of the mouth of the second adam what's going to come other sons oh glory to god did you hear what i said out of the mouth of the second adam was going to come other sons all glory to god from his very body he said receive the holy ghost he was speaking life over the seeds of god oh give the lord a shout and today life is being spoken you shall receive the holy ghost oh receiving the holy ghost life is being spoken your life is going to change oh my hallelujah hallelujah jehovah as a baby jehovah is a captain son jehovah as a teenager jehovah as a young man jehovah in the temple jehovah read in the book hallelujah my god so each age has been given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifest the promised word is the seed of the age so all this talk and talk about ice bride and when bride because he's taken a church this morning hearing about a prophet that's not what he's saying here he said the people of the age that manifest the promised word is the seed so if you want to sit back and be a choice member that's your choice but if you want to be seen you should see something this morning and say you know what i want that i want to manifest that or you can say this way i want that to be manifested in me or you can say it this way i want the word to become flesh in my flesh come on now come on now you have to say all of it you have to say all of it you can't just by the word made flesh because that's in the bible but when you say in my flesh like job said in my flesh i shall see god for myself another another oh glory to god oh my so he said the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children is the seed of the kingdom of that age now watch you said if you said it's fate right you said glory to god preacher he said i don't believe in all this stuff if you got real fate here we go it will declare your works your works will declare you say this way your works will declare what your fate is so it is coming now beyond confession beyond saying i believe no your works will vindicate or prove what you're confessing he says your works will declare what your faith is a boy told me not long ago if god judges me according to my faith i am saved but if you judge me according to my morals i am lost you see what you do there he's saying he's a believer right but he do know all kinds of crazy stuff you see if he's faith and believing i said but if i check my works on my life i lost listen what the prophet answered him he says i said your morals testify of your faith so in other words that crazy life you're living there it shows the faith that you think you have you don't have there's a lot of unbelief in certain that are there oh glory to god hallelujah so watch he said you know you've got to get the living word in you to have the living god in you because the word here is god when it is made flesh in you means spirit so when the word is made spirit in you that is the word becoming flesh because the spirit takes you out of the humanistic realm into the realm of divine revelation oh glory only spirit could do that other than that you're operating at the mental level so if at the mental level they come here believe the word and somebody telling something negative about but afterwards you get a mental fight because you see that's about me that's in your head that is in your mind but if you have a revelation and you hear any word that have nothing to do with you you want to know what's the objective of somebody tell your negative you follow what i'm saying now and that's how people can be tossed to and fro because they have no anchor they go to this church they go to this church they go to that group they go to that group and they're still not satisfied because they never encountered the person of christ oh glory to god because once you encounter him it doesn't matter god could put you in rome but you could be in the vatican that'll change who you are that have changed your name on the book that's a change that's mighty god who you're serving oh glory to god hallelujah there could be a servant in the papal village and so pope francis that they change who you are and what you call on to give the lord a praise this bride is ordained to defeat the devil anywhere any place under any condition why you think god choose you in this hour why didn't god choose you for this age because you know it'd be a messed up tied up tangle up but he chose you anyhow oh my hallelujah so here we go so you've got to get the living word in you to have the living god in you because the word here is god when it's made flesh in you means spirit and life in you when it goes when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life then you are a living example so you move from being a professor to being a possessor hallelujah you move from professing to believe to actually having a possession because the word has become life in you the world has become in your flesh and faith not just in your fate alone but in your flesh too and your flesh means the word is active so as hostility was your husband that changes who started was your wife that changes upset and carrying on that changes because now that word is effective in your flesh so it affects your behavior it affects your attitude it affects how you see things and how you see others oh glory to god you have oats and grudges but when that word hits you it affects it you in your flesh that you know you can't hold that ought if you hold it god holds it against you oh glory to god you have to forgive your brother and as you release him god release you oh glory to god and faith is based upon forgiveness as you release all those you have ought against your faith has to go higher higher higher and it brings in an atmosphere where you can receive your healing deliverance and sealant some people are not delivered because of the condition of the heart oh glory to god hallelujah you have to have faith my god amen all right let's continue you say then you become when it goes into your flesh and your fate and becomes alive then you will live an example you're an epistle of god read of all men you won't have it like christ not the fullness because it's divided up until they are pentecos so the bride will not be a denomination so look into a church or a group that forget about it it will have to be the word manifested to be the bread of christ so the bride is christ who word talked no word expressed no word explained no word revealed no word manifested that's the bride she's what word manifested oh glo you have my time for talking every time explanation jesus was in the temple age 12 isn't that right and he was confounding those pharisees but just would alone he wasn't allowed that child could speak so he's about my father's business and for 18 years he was silent no manifestation from 12 to 30 18 years of silence and he's going to hear them preaching things that they don't even know what they're talking about he had them in two person words they don't know what they're talking about and when his time come after the holy ghost fell upon him power inside of him he slap up and tap up the devil and set him running take him take a holiday take off and jesus returning the power of the spirit into the tabernacle and he took up the scripture from isaiah the spirit is upon me cool and cucumber hallelujah precious as ever and he took the book test the book sat down and said this day the scripture's fulfilled decided to argue they start to fuss they start to carry on and he'll leave them the argument i start to kill the sick cast or devils oh glory to god you have to manifest the works and shut them up this bright girl shot the mortal the critics yes yes yes we silent for years but god the word will become flesh and the invisible will become visible in you okay the lord i shall preach back to me now all glory to god hallelujah all glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that woman who was crying at jesus feet who stole the party and passed away back though because you see jesus fit duty making the cry and wipe us here and all them should shoot and see if you know what kind of woman that is and all them grumbling drama he's saying a word he's silent you won't even know what if you're doing right or wrong what what's going on she's just doing him as service and then all of a sudden jesus broke the silence say simon i have a word for you are you here to talk now give them chance to think and talk and lie and twist and all kind of thing and look at that look at that warm i am he's like coming here and nobody washed my feet this woman who sins are many so don't think i don't know her don't think i don't know about her sins but guess what simon her sins are forgiven i don't know about yours i see that woman there she free her sins are forgiven oh glory to god she get baptized in jesus name she i hit one church service but jesus said you see but when jesus said something you better watch that when jesus speaks something you better watch that he said i sense what many forgive him you go and tell the woman i'm a sincere now because glory glory my god you know what happened there for that woman she broke out to the humanistic and she broke into revelation that the same thing happened to women in the world that's why she run that's why she could shout because she out of the human she going back to the same people she ducking and hiding from she said come see a man who told me all that i did she was free from the liars free from the criticizers free from the self-righteous free from this who played holier than no she was free from them talking talk but we go walk this talk give the lord some praises [Applause] hi i'm excited because i'm now beginning to see how this thing is about to unfold i'm now beginning to see how the critic's mouth will be shut i'm now beginning to see how the bride will interpret the word itself so when people talking and arguing debates and the bride have nothing to argue they're just doing my father work and i will also give the lord a shout hallelujah oh glory to god what they say you can't do you'll be doing. [Music] you know jesus started with low miracles and went up higher higher higher first miracle was watching the wine he didn't say with the water let me tell him why no he was a guest and he went in wine right now they come to him he said what have they do with that and they just say whatever that man said do it he said draw waters and pour it out and then they recognize this is the best wine jesus turned water to wine he bypassed the person of the graves he bypass all the procedure all the three for six months to have the grapes fermenting he bypassed all of that and just flipped the water into wine so he could bypass all your troubles all your trials all your plastic bypass and flip your water in [Applause] i'm not hearing you all your intellectual flipping gymnastics in your head he can flip that and turn it into something in your heart turn water into the wine of revelation that you'll be inspired all glory to god and being inspired changes you you can't beat a man who's inspired you know the copy the mechanic was inspired a doctor was inspired a woman who's inspired a sim stress farmer whoever you can't beat a man who's inspired he just gets it right why he's inspired oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you lord hallelujah like that man it was a drought well i'm talking about a man an old man went in the middle street and kneeling in the street and say lord god i serve you all these years people know where the hand went up rain coming god will respect that old man with fate he went to the middle of the street he ain't gonna corner i don't know any ministry lord i save you all these years we need rain and everybody know rain was coming because god waiting for somebody that would break through you must bust through it or you will die oh yes yes yes yes yes i know you have to comfort you know i know catholic priest you know you boss you or die nobody here come to holy and pampas and rocky and nursery with butler and shake it you know no you bust you or you die you break through beyond the veil oh give the lord a shout nobody pushing you into the kingdom you know the kingdom is preached and every man pressed your way into it oh give the lord a shout come on you're gonna die out to yourself yes yes yes yes yes every evil spirit every unclean spirit every wicked spirit all glory to god remember god elected you before them spirits come on the earth my god there are three elements a man follows there are three elements that a man follows first is humanistic second is divine revelation third is vision and that's thus here the lord so many times we are down here never climb into this your dong dear cast your hopes to the veil and okay he says now when you're down here you said um okay mary couldn't understand how she could have a baby not knowing no man what mary was on divine revelation she knew what god said she all she had one question oh shall these things be he said holy ghost all over shadow that was finishing me that's what mary needed to hear she needs to feel pregnant and feel the belly something moving no she ran immediately that was fate make your door fate becomes active and mary ran straight into this against i'm gonna baby his name before jesus elizabeth have john inside her belly already and join her move yet and when she said jesus jumps at the shop and job oh glory to god hallelujah now what if mary didn't go she couldn't get any testimony john couldn't hear jesus but when here john yeah jesus don't know already he coming to introduce this man that's why he comes six months before oh glory to god because you can't introduce yourself john had to introduce him oh glory to god could we give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah so the first one is humanistic where we are done here we see i'll pray for that person i'm hoping that they get well next is divine revelation that's when something done in your heart anchors it and say it's going to happen then something is going to happen then the third element is vision or the word of the lord made manifest and that's thus here the lord there's no feeling in that that is vision and the bride going to have to see the lord or she keeps still so he's actually prophesying the bible would break into that tale level which is vision which is the prophetic vision and that we're still locked in write the vision and make it plain because you know the vision is is thus you the lord notice when you have a vision you can fit everything into it because the vision gives you the whole picture you can fit every part into it oh glory to god isn't that right so christ didn't send people to build churches and seminaries no he sent under preaching gospel and the gospel isn't word only but through power and manifestation of the holy spirit which will produce the signs of mark 16. the message will they want to hear that they want to hear more mysteries and more talk and we wrongly wrote past 50 years now since god took the prophet off but the gospel is not word only but the gospel is power and manifestation of the holy spirit that would produce the science of mark 16 when he said go on the one and preach the gospel right the word itself is dead here we go until it becomes interaction and produces life so man of word but he went dead you'd have to take quickness power it have to take the life of the world jesus himself said the word and i speak their spirit in their life they'll just take it as word only because god said let there be nothing happen it could take a hundred years a thousand years but then and there was light oh glory to god don't let the time element fool you all glory to god wants is the word and it's god it has to come to pass oh glory to god that's why faith could work with patience once it's spoken [Music] when god told abraham you have a son god didn't have a fight you know the doctors had a fight syria had a fight abram had his questions but abraham had a revelation because god spoke to him so he was not in the humanistic realm he couldn't laugh like serious it wasn't human instagram but abraham was under divine revelation oh glory to god and that divine revelation gave him a divine expectation for the manifestation he had so much revelation he had to believe for himself and for sarah too that her flesh would be changed because no old woman having no baby oh glory to god so abraham had to believe in god transforming power and so help me god oh glory to god we can produce nothing who we are we have to have faith in this transforming power oh glory to god before you go raptor you have to be changed on the inside brother the raptor is inside out because your flesh be caught up to meet him in the air your inside has to be caught up that's what this gospel is all about that's what dynamics is all about my goal let's continue oh glory i see cancer trembling i see tumor trembling i see blindness i see death and shaking as the sons of god step into the anointing and step into the fate that was once delivered to the saints you talk about the super church you talk about the super race you talk with an anointing to strike the church of the living god glory hallelujah it has to be the right condition and he said chicken could hatch under a dog put an egg on that dog is the atmosphere it has to have an atmosphere for things to break out isn't that right hallelujah he said did you notice moab on the mountain israel holy ruler dung in the valley and both of them are seven altars seven sacrifices both of them seven blocks both of them seven rams speaking of the common christ but the brethren where balaam failed to see was the signs and wonders following the believers down here so both had lambs both had rams both had seven both have alters one have signed one i have none and one without science sketches has anyone with signs listen but i have predicted they had a submission rock that abrasive on the pillar supernatural was with them and so it has been all along and predicted as janice and jambres which stood moses so will this in the last day but listen to this prophecy now but i've got better hopes for you brethren here this morning that you will be men of god who will stay with the word of god and let everything else fall right to left but still right with that word don't move no matter if you are dormant out there be a good doormat and there's a part i like it don't try to compete with someone else or do this just stay right with the word stay right there and god will positionally place you into this kingdom i love that tell my wife we have no competition you know why we don't compete we don't come people know church we don't compete with our group we just do the best that we can in the spirit of excellence because we want to move on to perfection glory to god hallelujah so i am fighting no pastor fighting no church fighting not this and fighting all that we have a goal to hit devil laughing at church wars laughing at this past like in this past in the church against church they go laughing at that because they have nothing to do and you have to keep on keep on defending them keep on finding the flames of of coral and fussing and things like that and where is the manifestation of god coming onto christmas time three wise men come down to jerusalem where is he bunking the jews them everybody excited it's two years them talking about this thing two years of bringing gifts and and passing through all kind of bandits and rubbers aren't escaping them you've got to see we have seen this tiny east we come into worship when they come to jerusalem jesus i'm dead as i don't know everybody just in the business who you're looking for but he stopped saying where is he could he recognize them fellas dead like i don't know but they call so much eruption with the where is he that the king doesn't hear about what is this about but i'm king very nervous when they're here next kingdom come in ain't nobody coming them think they put you know putin and all them guys aren't thinking they empowered it don't forget today forever you know they're not thinking that the god won't pull the rock just nowhere and these don't caught up with their hands they might see the kingdoms coming coming down you know them them setting yourself up to stay forever so when they hear king he said well bring me wood when you're finding them i hold them down in school to find out what they're supposed to be born oh my god i won't miss that scripture they say yes next minute they get a dream together they quickest because when they're king here and they seem coming as a kill that's all they know the goddess to disguise you in satan's kingdom god disguise you you're looking moxie you're looking strippity you're looking like if you're no sense in your head you're looking fanatical you're looking like you're looking you is bright what kind of way you were making all that whole noise and this happened that happened you're praising go like it's not happening and you know very what happened but you're still praising god anyhow devil don't know if you're coming or going you don't know if you're done or up you don't really press your frustrated because you're coming with a little face oh god of the prayer said you're hanging ahead no you're praising him and you know and a good time you praise his name and the bad time you do the same get the devil confused so they are keeping an atmosphere that everyone know who is this who is this oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah get the devil confused who is this you're praising him regardless you're praising me in advance for your deliverance like i paul he was in prison what a place to be in locked up for the word of god but at midnight the time when you're supposed to take a sleeping pill and go and sleep at midnight paul said make me some coffee there or when he hit that coffee at midnight he began to sing and praise god hallelujah with man looking to sleep and have it easy for the for the thunky he's had a singing bunny ears and when he started saying the anointing come down and god open up the prison path you know where to be free you praise him before you get free give the lord a praise offering oh glory to god hallelujah you are waiting for jericho walls to fall down and then shout your shout before the fall you shout before the walls fall you shout before the walls fall when thy shout show [Applause] this is your time to shout this is your time to praise your god hallelujah [Applause] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory what abram says you said a lot of things you say all of them has the right mechanics but one of them has dynamics you see you might know the mechanics but they take the dynamics to start off the mechanics to make them work oh glory to god where's the point having an executive car and you're pre-shining and they're shining and polish down or whatnot and when you say take me for a spin you say it can't start every day you're polishing a vacuum in there you put a new steering wheel you only have nothing shiny stuff and things like that it's well polished down everybody's taking pictures and posting by the car but the guy is not opposed opposite is taking one spot to the next part you're you're the nicest guy in the whole street and your car can't move i have a cannon dynamic it missed any battery so you push you push you can't start that you need dynamics to start it and a man looking for a real ride and i'm gonna order pick up i go over here because your nice car only posing on the street and we are here to pause we are here to take pictures we have to get down the road down to the resurrection and they will take mechanics and dynamics to do that all glory to god we have this mystery that mystery that hidden mystery that machine on that machete side that machine on top the mastery in between all the power itself become a mystery oh glory to god we don't want that give me the power and then talk about the mystery i want to talk oh give the lord a shout [Applause] [Music] jesus opened the mysteries of the old testament to his disciples he opened the word to them you open the understanding here tell them they're good with that hold that and move that if they only hold let them walk away they can you run for their life why didn't you when you're woman close your doors because i was brave there was fear hiding because they had no power they only had books and tips no only power with no power peter with them too mary with them do mary magdalene with them all of them church past the prophet everybody inside of there pulpit people ministry people believer people all them in the same upper room where's everybody the same promise none of the other peter phil let her leave that he in trouble you have to stay until you undo it perform on high all glory of god as many as receive him to them to them to them oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory notice when the fire fell in the upper room and the battery get charged up and that car tumble and they walk all day rumbling with that v8 engine oh glory to god peter said these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that weird fear no man because the anointing of the land of the cyber judah was upon them brothers oh glory to god they were ready for the press they was ready for the consul he was ready for beatens yes they were ready for pressure now because they had the power give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah come on now come on now lori listen to this listen to this but ram says when when there was praise and worshiping god did there somebody come and tell the devil shouting up they know he said he showed him making noises he said they're having a good time forget them they are not them just over-excising satan even recognized what happened here because you see they ran him in he have no discernment to see the fire in their souls he taught us a bunch of jumpy cool lucky happy people that in the upper room getting excited and because that old noise and walking a little drunk but when peter went to the wanted the gate called beautiful and that crippled man was there that everybody knew he was crippled and peter says silver and gold have i none such as i have given them to you rise up and walk and then demons went down the hill and said satan a man walk you know and jesus not even wrong the same peter who denied christ that same man if you know what happened appalling from him see they said what we can't let this happen he called the congressman them don't call me since you know devils anoint them he said we have to stop this thing then they beat them and say don't preach in jesus name don't do this thing you're doing oh hallelujah jesus was doing that you doing that too yes the same works i do shall you do also could we give the lord some praises this is what the devil don't want you to see come on and preach back to me the same works the same works you will do because god said so hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory thank you lord all right let's head to home stress here now the church should be he said okay looter martin luther had mechanics and dynamics john wesley had mechanical dynamics pentecost had them what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to meet christ with the manifestation of every blessing he promised in the bible operating in that one great body where he promised he would meet them and be worshipped in his gracious of his oh my hallelujah thank you lord it's a word is a manifestation of a thought isn't that right first he taught it he spoke it then the word was made manifest and every word in the bible is god torts laid in seed form and if receiving that human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the bible it brings things to pass isn't that right so therefore here we go are you ready he said let there be a world before the before it could be a word it had to be a thought so god and creation created the world by his thought first then spoke it so the creation was in his thinking and to break that to come to life he had was to speak it so the word become the expression of what one is mine let there be light let there be let there be literally oh my hallelujah praise god in him so here's bob now and if that same spirit that said that there'd be light and there was light let there be trees and there was trees if that's his mind that was in christ being you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone there's a weak amen boy this thing should be you should be busting the roof we should be repairing this roof next week that same spirit that same anointing let there be no cancer cancer going on [Music] let the blind eyes be open and it would be so glory to god and jesus says you shall say to this mountain and amen and believe in your heart what the things you say it shall come to pass you say what power has been given to the church no you can express it by mental conception that's humanistic as mental realm but if it becomes a real revelation of god then you see it before it happens that is divine revelation now oh glory to god because you see it before it happens so you break out of the humanistic realm you break out the mental fate and you're going to spiritual faith a rock revelation not a democrat movie after that oh glory to god like that old bomb the doctors finally said leaving me all you go there just no he said he said he's nobody i am somebody said a talk you're on the hospital bed he said if i was nobody jesus was going to die for me because i am somebody i'm trying to diss him and make him feel like he's a nobody's i am somebody because jesus died for me oh glory to god you can't do that you can't go there oh hallelujah isn't that right all right so watch if your heart and your mind is so in filled with god's spirit until your thoughts become historic there you are when your mind your leading your guidance becomes a direct place a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that's moving in your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very holy spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the holy spirit has you so built until your thoughts your being is god's spirit expressionism through you what kind of church are we to be what kind of people ought to be to be this morning if this random tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of god notice what you're talking about filled everything not mysteries enough if this brand of tabernacle could be so clear with the person of god why when you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't even have no alternative of your own just to be led by your spirit then he said this you know when the human element moves out and the spirit of god fills that vacancy see that is when you are willing to let go of your past let go of your fears let go of your failures you just let it go and let the spirit move in watch this and when you empty yourself and and then will be when the church is in its power of the resurrection of the lord jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what i mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material that is when the church will be in its power so that's not human when they came in line in church with their money and all kind of stuff and peter's telling them you didn't lie to a man you lied to the holy ghost peter wasn't controlling that it was the spirit that was there it was the holy ghost that was there and that is going to return because the holy ghost will be back in the church in his people come on now so you cannot point peter and said he denied christ therefore he is not you don't go there because you could see a brother or sister and do whatever they did but you don't know when god do for them you know what a brother did last week but you didn't know what god did fame last night could somebody say amen human know what somebody did last week but you don't know what god did for them last night so they only begin to prophesy i believe it's on its road when the church will be so wrapped in christ the holy spirit mankind's away from themselves till they don't see themselves he said they taught but to serve god and their thoughts move on and they refuse the things of the world they move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the claws of christ then the love of christ in the human heart moving in the holy ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity here we go because deity will be revealed in the human beings by the holy spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind now any man could speak a word but when the word is confirmed then you see god you see all these modern line prophets just want to fix the prophecy after they see it prophesy i lie and say could go so go say god showing me and it come to me and it never does it illusion it's always coming to them there's a lying demon coming to all of them do you feel what i'm saying but when a prophet speak he don't speak he came to me no and the word of the lord came unto elijah saying go tell ahab specific things and the word of lord came under jeremiah say go and do specific things oh glory to god and the word of lord came to us by a prophet oh glory to god hallelujah we have those say the lord because we heard from that elijah oh give the lord some praises [Music] [Applause] so then christ then becomes your makeup amen he's in full control then your torch will be clean your thoughts your heart will be clean isn't that right my god hallelujah praise god as a man think in his heart so it has to become a thought before it can become a word and the word express materializes i believe in my heart that i am a christian okay because i have accepted the lord jesus christ if i don't cry if i don't move if i don't do a thing in my heart first i believe that christ died for me in my stead i accept it as a christian i believe it as a christian then in my heart then i express it in a word i am a christian you have to say it you have to actually speak that i am a christian if you don't speak that then you do all kind of stuff because you're really not a christian you don't believe you're a christian but when you receive the word and you receive the lord you start to tell people i'm a christian when i go on my job i just like to tell people that because i tell them that and they will hold me accountable this will say and you say he's a christian so i used to put my testimony up front i'm a christian you know that means i'm not smoking i'm not drinking i'm not partying i'm not lying don't ask me to do something i'm a christian so you know up front what i am saying and i am but when you don't say that people play games because it's not people you know it's a spirit anointing them yes to see how much you could compromise yes because once you compromise you take your covenant off and your blessing fall off and it's not that god i want the blessing you know be covering over you he cannot be blessed and can't fall through that because you're compromising but when you put your testimony out i'm a christian your boss through demons powers oh glory to god you put your testimony on the line oh glory to god hallelujah so he's promised another comforter i'm going to finish how long are you going to be abide for you forever he said what is the word of god what is our comfort today is when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of the living god lives in us and with the word of the god living we stand that word is made flesh and well among us now that same word that was made flesh and well among us has become our flesh [Music] did you hear that we read it and the word became flesh that same word has become our flesh that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when it was made flesh because your flesh holds it your flesh holds it oh glory to god hallelujah so jesus was god tabernacle made flesh on the earth and the bible said and the word was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible so what's the problem today with all these so-called boosters and claimers and whatnot oh my if the word become flesh it'll be invisible the invisible become visible and they say when omnipotent speaks the miraculous take place so god can be veiled alone only talking mysteries jesus when lazarus was sick he's telling me good not great lazarus dead he says sleep it i go with him what is jesus in the realm of vision are you with me so he is not in humanistic he's beyond the revelation he's vision now he said go wake him the man dead and stinking i go wicked no he ain't going say wait wait wait i wanna wake up he come among them and they had a biscuit on the coffee and whatnot and a week look if he had been here my brother had not died yeah i know it i mean i missed it i missed the timing i wasn't here when he was sick and he was dying no he's dead and then the sister said even now now if she didn't say even no he couldn't go further you know even though true men are geared even now then he had to go i promise the man did not manage sick he said i am the resurrection and the light she's out open the last days you know you're raised and you said i know the one last day singing i am resurrection i am the life now last days last days last days last day but today is the day oh glory to god i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yes shall he live then he hit him up stunner where have you laid him nice trouble that is trouble the human is sexy but lord is thinking does not do with it with man is impossible but really god could be given some praises things that are impossible with man it's possible with god where have you laid him oh glory to god i can't operate and i don't know where he is tell me where he is he's a roller with his stone if you have faith that i could change the situation whatever is blocking it up loose it roll it hallelujah your situation might be stink on the inside the stone that blocking it roll it what can the lord have praise off roll away that stone because deliverance is coming healing coming resurrection coming voice of the archangel coming roll away that stone of unbelief glory brother branham he said and through his sacrificial debt at calgary and his resurrection positionally places church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the word visible so don't tell me it cannot be done it can be done don't tell me this pastor and this church are doing that that's what i'm going to do with us oh glory to god we see the word of how we are to become what we have to line up with he said i've often wanted to come to a church i've longed to see it i guess where i could walk into the back door front or wherever and look across the audience see a perfect church see men and women sitting under the power of the holy spirit and the spirit of god moving perfectly moving this someone had done something wrong in the congregation they would confess it quickly that is the church of the living god oh my poor heart it's getting all i've longed to stand and see a church like that oh my and all that you are all that you ever will be is based upon faith in this world isn't that right so hear what that really is you know as we close museum coming please a change of the heart not of this physical thing but the heart of your soul that something anchors to your torch that his way is dull you don't see that no more you just see the lord jesus you see righteousness you see holiness you see purity and love and grace that is when you are changed and your torch your habits your being have been changed from a sinner to a christian first thing you know in your heart then you express it with your lips and then it materializes so then your words become weighted words you don't have to talk about gossip and old talk and lying and hearing back and island confusion no you want god taught when you speak you're speaking words words that could produce life now if you think of it and you imagine you think it and you express it and it doesn't materialize then you're on the wrong road you get it you if you imagine you're a christian you speak it with your lips but you find out that you're not you better get your thoughts changed get your heart changed because it doesn't be a record it doesn't be a fruit oh my you must say what you think not be a hypocrite that is where you're getting lined up now you stop being hypocritical you stop being dishonest whatever you speak is very sincere because they're getting now into speaking terms with god and they're coming to speak in terms that you could speak the word so you don't speak something that you really don't mean in your heart you have started practice speaking from your heart oh glory to god then you let that your thoughts be pure your expressions pure you live pure you be pure all right i'm i'm finishing here now christ is the word right god dwelt with us in flesh he was the word and before it's word it's a thought and a thought has to be created god taught here we go become creation when it was spoke by a word and when he presented to you as a thought is taught it's revealed to you divine revelation so you break past humanistic realm you break into divine revelation it's revealed to you but it's still a thought until you speak it oh you mean we really have to speak this thing yes hallelujah i am healed i am delivered i am free you have to speak it yes that is why moses will know to pray that pill of fire around him he said go hold your stick and say and call for flies there was no flies and he went out and said i said let there be flies so even though god no flies is the channel to terrorize pharaoh moves at the speak fit or flight flights they're coming oh glory to god to think about it the bride must prophesy again so you can express it by a mental conception but it becomes a real revelation of god that you see it before it happened and express it in the word form and that word takes a whole and become material a taught express there are three elements that a man follow it's humanistic second divine revelation to this vision you could play something verse even and then the third is vision is thus yet alone and the bride will love thus says the lord this service today was thus saith the lord because it's the word it's your word and you know i was challenged to preach this this morning i can't really say all the way the holy spirit you know deal with me to bring this message but i guess just as i was challenged you will be challenged also to believe that this word has to come into your flesh liquor jacob jacob was a deceiver he was a trickster because he wasn't converted it was his nature but his gene was of god his attribute was of god and so much that before he was born he said jacob i love you so i hid because he saw it wasn't jacob but yet that same jacob had to hold on and wrestle until he was changed and to show he was changed he was walking different he's walking with a limp because the injured touches
