Spirit be with us and be with them in their homes that you would visit them that the anointing of God will be with them in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome tonight and if you have your Bibles I you to turn to Genesis chapter 32 want to read from 24 to 30 and Ephesians 6 you want to read verse 12 Ephesians 6 vers 12 Genesis 32 reading from verse 24 speaking about Jacob here and after he parted his wise because he had issues with his brother Esau and we want to just look at that again tonight and Jacob was left alone Genesis 32 vers 24 and Jacob was left alone and sometimes we want we don't want to be alone we are busy whether on Facebook whether with friends whether with family we are very very busy we don't want to be alone alone give us time to think alone give it time to meditate alone give it time to consider and review your walk your life Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day break it and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince H has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name he said wherefore is it that thou asks after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place pennyel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved Ephesians 612 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let me read it again for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places may God bless his word and uh may God be with us tonight it's good to be here uh it's great to be in sath on Wednesday night if you have Wednesday night message you should the junction message is an important message uh the two spirits in the framework of the Christian church and tonight this what I get up on my heart and our titled two words we wrestle we wrestle and um you know brother Anthony was singing that song and everything give him thanks just the other night I was in some pain and um it test to me and everything else and I Su myself raising my hands and praising God amidst the pain and I recognized that um the little acts of Fai that we do like in everything give him thanks nobody wants to be sick nobody body wants to feel unwell is not something we we cherish as such but this is part of this thing called life and is what we do when we are faced with it I cannot preach to you give him thanks in the good times and bad times and when my bad times come I can't give them thanks we have to begin to apply the word to our lives that it can become effective you don't want to be like doing religion then you don't want to be like coming to church and going back home and it's not been applied to you you want to have a sense that this means more that you're coming to something that is greater more powerful than you that God want you to be a part of not in ritual because after a while the Scribe and Pharisees they were caught up in rituals um that's is why they question Jesus about why his disciples not washing hands because washing hands wasn't a scriptural Duty in that way and they had a ceremony of washing of hands and every every time they go to do something they wash their hands wash hands and that washing hands was to make sure nothing unclean Gentiles this that and another and that they were above those things but Jesus said you with your Traditions make the word of none effect so what God wants God want the word to be effective God doesn't want the word to be used as like a a good luck Chan when you're ready to wrap your word around you because you want to be lucky you want a job you want a wife you want a husband you want a car you want a whatever whatever God is not that's not what the word is for the word supposed to be something we surrender to that he could find the preeminence Jesus short circuited the whole list of people to call by getting these uneducated men because they were more how you say they had the ability to be submissive to the word that why he could use them now I used to think that intellectual means somebody with plenty head you know education and like that but intellectualism is actually a spirit so somebody could be read and write and they intellectual intellectual have to do with reasoning so somebody could have zero education but they have an intellectual spirit and that intellectual Spirit hinders them from operating at a faith level because anytime you reason Faith get thrown out of the books so you have to able to to cast on reasoning and let Faith have its way and when Faith Works and instead operate you recognize it's God at work then you see five l two fishes God is at work what are these among many that is sight that is reasoning that is intellect at work looking with eyes and saying you know what fire Los and two fishes that's a tough call but when Jesus took it and blessed it and said yes share it that's fi that that that that is fi he didn't multiply it and have 10,000 fishes and 10,000 bread no he just take it bless it share it that that is the act of faith and we want to come back to that Simplicity of believing exactly what God said because at the end of the day and I want you to see the structure of the scripture we read Tonight We R not against flesh and blood but against one principalities two Powers three rulers of Darkness four spiritual wickedness in high places so Satan kingdom is structured it is not anything go it have principalities it have powers it have rulers of Darkness so this man have generals and lieutenants and and and captains and and so on like that and it start at the top because remember all the kingdoms of this world belongs to him so all the presidents of the world the prime ministers of the world they are being influenced by principalities they are influenc to make laws and what everything I want you to see it in a panoramic if God could just pull us up in a in like a helicopter and look down and see in the panoramic this world is not for you if you believe you're Christian this world is not for us this world is Antichrist really this world is not even ours as it is this is Satan's Eden we trying to pass through this Satan Eden to get back to God's Eden and we needed the restoration of the word by this end time Prophet Messenger to be able to do that so tonight I want you to see it this way we wrestle we wrestling every day I would like to show you that in wrestling you cannot go in a wrong weight category you have small 150 pound wrestlers itd have 300 pound wrestlers 600 pound wrestlers so God wouldn't line you up and you are 150 pound with a 600 pound God will not give you more than you can be so anytime you in your battle you are to understand it is designed for you it could be rough it could be tough but God will not be unjust so God wouldn't let you line up unfairly he has prepared you and you have to understand in your heart there is a way out of what you are being challenged with there's a way out of what you are faced with right now amen so praise God that's a little introductory of what we want to share tonight okay so we read it we are battling not against family not against and this is where a lot of carnal church members miss the vot you know like people who think like brother and church and they fighting me and they fighting the ministry and the fighting and the kind and the Flesh and what they do now they take that disrespectful spirit and put it on their family on their children and the children carry on with that Spirit too now here what they don't understand and here what a lot of don't understand it's a spirit world we live in the natural but the reality is a spirit world the battle that was of angels and now the Battle of men so when we temper and we get involved with the wrong influences we don't know how much it affects our family and our lives for instance the woman who came to Jesus and said uh can to Jesus and said about um my daughter is vexed with a devil that's a spiritual condition she know these Pharisees and scribes they have no power they only have argument and talk and ritual so them on books tapes and and Revelations and Mysteries and all kind of stuff but they have zero power so she know Jesus have the power to deliver a daughter Jesus say it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs now she could have get Vex angry and walk away from that man but she stood a ground and say even the dogs it Crumbs from off the master table now watch this she said the right thing not only that Jesus himself said for this saying so in other words her words of respect her words to God her words to what was challenging to her was so powerful it had a spiritual boomerang if I could use that she actually activate a spiritual boomerang that deliver the family so what I'm saying just as her words could activate a boomerang to deliver her family the reverse is also true you could say things that bind your family you could say things that affect your family in a negative way and you would wonder why things are not working out as you want it to work out and and it's all come back to you you who sit in a position of influence as mother as father as grandmother as grandfather as husband wife whatever especially parents when you sit in that position of influence over your children and your action and attitude they get the Vibes off you if it is negative the children grasp a negative fact you don't have to even talk it's the spirit atmosphere that they catch and then it begins to unfold in such different ways but tonight I want to challenge you the battle is not flesh and blood this is the Bible not your uncle and aunt and this one who like you and what no is Spirits behind people this service last Wednesday night was an astonishing one for me I was blown in my mind the way let me say this way the message was crafted and I know in myself I couldn't just do that humanly I know it was by the holy spirit that it was fitted together and when I begin to see like on a different level then I begin to see principalities and power standing with ministers G looking for control understand this the nicolan spirit is a spirit that binds theity is a spirit that want to control others it's a controlling spirit it's a very influential and God want sovereignity God wants the independence of the local church God wants you to be able to be led by the Spirit by the word and yet the devil looking at opportunities how to get in to your life let's let's let me say this now now they are DOs and dos and they back door and if we live wrong we open open doors to Spirits to influences to come into our lives into our homes and affect us and that is why we have to begin to close the gap and close the doors now the Jesus taught that when a devil is cast out he is roaming because he doesn't have a house so he come like I wouldn't say vagrant but he homeless he's Kicked Out the Devil is harmless until he get somebody to use we have to ensure and you have to ensure you are not the one devil using let me say that again you should ensure you are not the one that the devil is using because your will be exposed you have to want to be one that God is using because God himself is like harmless or until he gets a body that he could use so God want a body which is a temple and the devil want a body which is a temple so therefore there are influences and every single day we're in a battle because his family saying this is this one saying that is the boss is the neighbor is Brethren and whatnot and if you look at it there are spiritual influences behind all these things and if you stay with the word you recognize you have to like I said keep away from bitterness keep from Holdings all these are doors you you hold ORS and become a door you know a door that hinders you from getting your prayer answer because it affect your faith because faith is based on say it out loud faith is based on forgiveness so if forgiveness is not de and you know you're still a Christian you're still talking word you're still fellowshipping but the faith is not dear to get your prayer answer so here what I want to share with you tonight I long 2 Corinthians 10 3-6 here here Paul for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty true God to the pulling down of strongholds and here we go verse five casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ now this is deeper Christianity this is not comment this is God saying that we in this spiritual warfare is not carnal weap and we have to bring every thought into captivity into Obedience of Jesus Christ because fooling and running doesn't just ups and start you know before somebody fall in sin or fornication or adultery it does just start it doesn't overnight thing it starts with a thought it starts with a thought and it goes down into desires and then lust and then it goes to the ACT and that is where sin makes it climax do you get what I'm saying now so things start with thought and if we begin to bring our thought into captivity to bring it in obedience to Christ's words then we on our way to tremendous Victory so it's an effort it's you being conscious that the word is saying that our weapons are are not caral the weapons of a Warfare have to do with casting down imagination it has to do with bringing every High thought everything has exalted itself into the knowledge of of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Jesus Christ get this man and having a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now this verse six in is an astonishing scripture listen and having a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now let's go over that we amplify it a bit for we walk and live in the flesh for though we walk Live In the Flesh we are not carrying on our Warfare according to flesh and using me mere human weapons for the weapons of our Warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood but they are Mighty before God for the overthrow and destructions of strongholds in as much as as we refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of God and we lead every thought and purpose a way captive into Obedience of Christ the Messiah the anointed one here is one the last ver being in Readiness to punish every insubordinate for his Disobedience when your own submission and obedience as a church are fully secure and complete this is MIND buling in other words it's saying here that when the church is submissive and obedient to God then discipline could be correctly effective so in other words I can't be trying to discipline you and I am a slacker do you get that do you understand that I am trying to to and my my discipline is not do you get that now so it come like um you know OB say cified Pastor how the children will live above the parents so everything come right back to the to the home if the mother will be respectful if the wife will respectful if the wife will be respectful to the husband and the husband respectful to the wife and there's respect to the family then you'll get the children respectful when the parents are not respectful you get the children not respectful do you understand so if we want to get a respectful house change have to begin with me with you before you want to see change in others see the change in you tonight we wrestle not all your wrestle we all of us every day every day is a p i driving through you know the ARA today and it's it's sights to behold it's not right here and I'm seeing my goodness there just satanic influences people looking at flesh and blood and clothes and walking and whatnot now in the Christmas spirit looking to shop and buy and everything else you know what it be it's a spirit it's not the Holy Spirit the Christmas spirit let me tell you one time the Christmas spirit is not the holy spirit because if that the Holy Spirit everybody have it and we know that not true the Christmas spirit is a spirit is a atmosphere you see and people get caught up in it be careful the season is that atmosphere that they end all right so therefore being in Readiness to punish every in subordinate for his Disobedience when your own submission and obedience as a church are fully secured and complete now remember I told you about weight classes in wrestling actual wrestling you get to wrestling just want to finish quickly wrestling are grouped into weight classes to ensure fear competition 1 Corinthians 10:13 they had no temptation taking you but such as is comeon to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Dear it so what this is telling us is that those people in church who have excuses they are lying you cannot say this is too much you cannot say um this is unfair because the Bible God can't lie and if the Bible say he will not give you something more than you can bear he is true and he is faithful do you believe that tonight come on say Amen want to hear shouting in your own house all right now the Amplified of that for no temptation no trial regarded as enticing to sin no matter how it comes or where it leads has over has over taken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man that is no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and the Bible exorts us resist the devil that that is not adjusted and adapting and belonging to Human Experience but such as man can bear but God is faithful to his word and to his compassionate nature and he can be trusted not to let you be tempted and tried and ased beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure but with the Temptation he will always provide the way out the means of escape to The Landing place that you may be capable and strong and powerful to Bear up under it patiently now if you receive that if you receive this in your spirit you wouldn't talk in frustration and you f up and you can't that's the devil that's the devil want you to get F frustrated once you get in that M of stressed out and you and you can't handle it then the devil get you there get you in a mood you can't get this Mind Of God you can't get the sensitivity of God and you crash now if when whatever you're confronting you start to begin to look what is the way God have as a landing place that I could be positioned to manage what is happening to me they come like they come like somebody not doing well and you know in terms of Finance call it survival mode they can't study planning for next five years or 10 years they want bread today they want bread tomorrow they want bread next day they not studying a week a month a year because they in Survival Mode God don't want you in that kind of w God want you to vision and purpose God want you to have a picture that because you are not transformed overnight thing takes time transformation takes God want you to know that that he who began a good work in you is able to complete it but if the devil could frustrate it you may even forget the work he started in you and God is the one who started the work in you you call yourself you didn't bring yourself to the Lord God call you and yet you condemn yourself you wipe out yourself and you try to give up sometimes and the devil saying yeah give up let go go leave yeah give up and devil trying to promp you and sings singing some some Christmas HS to you then right in a kind of Christmasy way to encourage you to leave the people out in the world frustrated they fed up they can't handle what they're handling they just drinking they just smoking they just weeding and cooking and everything else to manage their issues and here we as Christians knowing there's an intelligence and that we have been elected and selected before the foundation of the world for this battle come on Saints you can make it you're sold of the Cross you could handle it I know it's difficult I know it's challenging but it will be glorious because this is the age that God going to show for his hand and show what his power and show for his glory and and the Bible said it so sweetly I reckon that the prevent sufferings of this world is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed where in US in US that's all we have to see all right let me see I wrap up here my God this is something else to wrestle is to take part in a fight either as a sport or in earnest that involves grappling and of one's opponent and trowing to to to and trying to throw or force him to the ground wrestle is also struggling with a difficulty or a problem you could wrestle with issues wrestle in your mind wrestle in problem but we still wrestle and Jacob had to wrestle with that angel so it wasn't easy for Jacob to know it wasn't boxing you know it's wrestling wrestling is holding Letting Go slipping through getting back his foot and when when you think he get away hold your hand and roll you over and whatnot that is what wrest is about so it's not like it's a distant opponent it's a near opponent he's right there and you're wrestling with it you're wrestling with your thoughts you're wrestling what to do how to do it all right so therefore condition for success I have here Joshua one God telling be strong of good courage unto this people shall all inheritance only they were strong and very courageous here the condition that thou May observe to do watch all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not him the right hand and to the left that thouest Prosper whatsoever thou goest this book of the Lord shall shall not depend from thee day and night and then sh th shall have good success so he was showing that meditation on the word and yielding to obedience to God brings that full success and give me a preacher I'm almost done give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything and I show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put before him he seeks God first in closing I want to read a poem for you in closing are you ready the poem is I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord and I'll read it I am a soldier in the army of the Lord the Lord Jesus Christ is my commanded officer the Holy Bible is my code of conduct Faith prayer and the word are my weapons of war I have been taught by the Holy Spirit trained by

am more than a conqueror I will always Triumph I can do all things through Christ Devils cannot defeat me people cannot dis disillusion me weather cannot weary me sickness cannot stop me battles
