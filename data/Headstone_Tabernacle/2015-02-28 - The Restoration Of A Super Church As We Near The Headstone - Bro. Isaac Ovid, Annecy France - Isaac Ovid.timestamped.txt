[45:52] Judges and the Book of St Mark

[46:10] two and reading verse
[46:19] 23 and the Bible says be glad then ye
[46:23] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[46:25] your God for he hath given you the
[46:27] former rain moderately and he will cause
[46:29] to come down for you the rain the former
[46:31] rain and the latter rain in the first
[46:46] month and the floors shall be full of
[46:48] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[46:50] wine and
[46:54] oil

[47:00] the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and
[47:03] the caterpillar and the Palmer my great
[47:05] Army which I sent among
[47:16] you and shall we go to the Book of
[47:20] Judges uh
[47:24] 16 and reading from vers
[47:38] 27 now the house was full of men and
[47:40] women and all the Lords of the
[47:42] Philistines were there and there were
[47:44] upon the roof about 3,000 men and women
[47:47] that beheld while Samson made
[47:54] sport
[48:04] and Samson called unto the Lord and said
[48:07] oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and
[48:09] strengthen me I pray thee only this once
[48:12] oh God that I may be at once Avenged of
[48:15] the Philistines for my two
[48:24] eyes
[48:34] and the last scripture reading from the
[48:35] book of St
[48:38] Mark
[48:40] 16 verse
[48:54] 17
[49:02] Mark 16 and verse

[49:23] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[49:25] not H them they shall lay hands on the
[49:27] sick and they shall
[49:35] recover so then after the Lord had
[49:38] spoken unto them he was received up into
[49:40] heaven and sat on the right hand of
[49:46] God and they went forth and preach
[49:48] everywhere the Lord working with them
[49:50] and confirming the word with signs

[50:18] your people
[50:19] tonight may you take me completely out
[50:22] of the
[50:23] way Lord and may the word be prayed
[50:26] with such power Lord that the sick would
[50:29] be

[50:49] are under expectation
[50:51] tonight you promised to pour out your
[50:54] spirit we are under expectation
[50:57] tonight Lord may you speak to your
[50:59] people
[51:00] tonight take me out of the way bless the
[51:03] word to the hearts of the
[51:05] people in the precious name of Jesus
[51:07] Christ and the church says amen amen
[51:11] amen Give the Lord a hand of
[51:22] Praise amen well you may be seated
[51:24] tonight
[51:29] amen so I have a title
[51:30] tonight the
[51:33] restoration of a super
[51:35] church as we near The
[51:38] Headstone the
[51:40] restoration of a super church as we near
[51:44] The
[51:46] Headstone my
[51:47] inspiration once more
[51:50] Lord once more Lord is that your prayer
[51:54] tonight once more Lord and we read that
[51:59] scripture in the Book of Judges now the
[52:02] house was full of men and
[52:04] wom and all the Philistines were
[52:08] there they were having a
[52:10] celebration because they had finally
[52:12] caught
[52:14] Samson and brother brandham
[52:17] said it's all right to have
[52:20] celebrations it's okay to have a
[52:23] celebration but not this type of
[52:26] Celebration because a Son of God had
[52:30] been broken a Son of God had been
[52:34] trapped a Son of God was in
[52:37] prison Samson was born for a
[52:41] purpose Samson was born for an
[52:44] objective but on this day it wasn't
[52:47] looking good for
[52:49] Samson the Bible says the whole house
[52:52] was
[52:52] full there were 3,000 people
[52:56] in the VIP
[52:58] section who were looking down at
[53:01] Samson and brother Bram said they must
[53:04] have had some preliminary
[53:07] events different things to entertain the
[53:11] people but the main
[53:14] event was going to be
[53:16] Samson all of the Philistines they had
[53:20] heard about
[53:21] Samson at the very name
[53:24] Samson they All Shook and
[53:27] trembled those in the VIP
[53:29] section they were happy to be in the VIP
[53:33] section because they did not want to be
[53:37] too close to
[53:38] Samson because Samson had a
[53:41] reputation wherever Samson
[53:44] went wherever Samson
[53:47] went something was going to go
[53:50] wrong for the Philistines so those in
[53:53] the VIP section
[53:56] they were happy to be there but they
[53:58] were very
[54:00] nervous because they told them they
[54:03] caught
[54:04] Samson but they didn't really
[54:07] want they did not really want to be
[54:10] close to
[54:11] Samson because Samson was a dangerous
[54:15] man Samson was like a nuclear
[54:19] weapon that they did not want to
[54:22] explode and I say tonight the devil is
[54:25] playing with
[54:27] explosives is playing with
[54:29] explosives because in this room
[54:32] tonight we have some
[54:34] explosives we have some weapons
[54:37] tonight that God is going to use you may
[54:41] be
[54:43] [Applause]
[54:45] seated I'm just building a foundation
[54:49] tonight you see Samson had
[54:53] stepped had moved moved from behind the
[54:57] word and because he moved from behind
[55:00] the word that's how he got
[55:04] caught if he had stayed behind the
[55:07] word his hair would have never been
[55:10] cut strength would have never left him
[55:13] but what Samson did not
[55:15] know his
[55:17] mistakes and his
[55:21] failures what he did
[55:23] wrong had pushed
[55:26] him into his
[55:29] Destiny it actually pushed him right
[55:32] where God wanted
[55:34] him because God wanted to put
[55:38] Samson in the middle of the enemy's
[55:41] Camp so he can do Maximum
[55:45] Destruction so God allowed
[55:49] situation in Samson's life situation he
[55:54] could could not understand situations he
[55:58] could not explain and he found himself
[56:02] surrounded by the
[56:04] Philistines he didn't know what was
[56:07] about to happen but in God's
[56:10] mind God said he is right where I want
[56:15] him he is right where I need him he is
[56:20] right where he is supposed to be and
[56:24] tonight you are right where you are
[56:26] supposed to
[56:27] be oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody say
[56:32] amen God doesn't make
[56:34] mistakes God doesn't make mistakes there
[56:38] is no accident with
[56:39] God you are not an accident it is not by
[56:43] chance that you are here tonight you are
[56:47] here tonight and Satan's
[56:50] Eden to be a weapon to tear down the
[56:53] works of the devil
[56:56] for a long time for a long time God has
[57:00] waited to bring you to this spot and it
[57:05] looks as if you are
[57:08] weak looks as if you are
[57:11] defeated it looks as if you're
[57:14] backsliding you may be
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:22] seated blessed be the name of the Lord
[57:25] this was the same
[57:27] Samson one time they sent a whole team
[57:30] to get
[57:32] Samson five men not 10 men over maybe a
[57:36] thousand men and they say we got enough
[57:39] men to get Samson Samson looked around
[57:43] him he didn't have a sword he didn't
[57:46] have a shield I don't know where he was
[57:49] but there was a dead donkey
[57:51] somewhere and my Bible tells me he
[57:54] picked up the
[57:56] Jawbone of a
[57:59] donkey and when he looked at the
[58:01] Jawbone and he looked at the man and the
[58:04] men looked at him they started to laugh
[58:06] at Samson because the
[58:09] mathematics was not going to add
[58:12] up it was not going to add up it was
[58:16] supposed to be impossible for him to win
[58:18] this
[58:19] fight but when the spirit of the
[58:22] Lord Came Upon Samson something happened
[58:25] to that
[58:27] ja the little thing he had took on a
[58:30] different power and he began to kill men
[58:34] who had
[58:36] swords men who had weapons Samson began
[58:39] to swing to the left he began to swing
[58:42] to the right because the spirit of the
[58:44] Lord had come upon Samson what do you
[58:48] think is going to happen when the spirit
[58:50] of the Lord comes upon this group comes
[58:54] upon this church you may be
[58:57] seated you may be seated when Samson was
[59:02] in the spirit Samson was a super
[59:06] church when Samson was in the spirit
[59:10] Samson was a super race when Samson was
[59:15] behind the word no devil could stop him
[59:19] devil could defeat him they tried to C
[59:22] Samson
[59:23] in move the
[59:26] gate because nothing can stop you when
[59:29] the spirit is upon you when you have the
[59:32] word in you you may be seated can the
[59:36] church say
[59:38] amen hallelujah hallelujah I'm just
[59:41] building a
[59:43] foundation God has always been
[59:47] interested in doing something beyond the
[59:51] ordinary he loves to do things
[59:55] that's just
[59:56] different in the beginning there was
[59:59] just
[1:00:00] darkness there was just
[1:00:02] chaos there was just confusion and God
[1:00:05] looked at it and said let there be light
[1:00:09] and there was light out of nothing he
[1:00:12] made something God loves to come into
[1:00:15] the middle of a
[1:00:17] situation when everything looks all
[1:00:19] messed
[1:00:20] up change things
[1:00:23] around and God had to have certain
[1:00:27] people at certain
[1:00:30] times represent him but the problem was
[1:00:35] every Super
[1:00:37] church had to come to an end because God
[1:00:41] had to unfold a certain
[1:00:44] picture so Samson a type of a super
[1:00:48] church he ended up being broken he ended
[1:00:51] up
[1:00:53] broken
[1:00:55] ended up
[1:00:56] weak Samson needed to be
[1:00:59] restored he needed his strength to come
[1:01:02] back he needed the same power that he
[1:01:06] had before so he said lead me to the
[1:01:10] pillars me to the
[1:01:12] Post lead me to what's holding up this
[1:01:15] world
[1:01:17] system and a young boy let Samson right
[1:01:21] where he was supposed to
[1:01:23] be and Samson began to
[1:01:26] pray and he said Lord Lord I messed
[1:01:30] up but avenge
[1:01:32] me of my two
[1:01:35] eyes in other words I made mistakes but
[1:01:39] the devil had no right to take out my
[1:01:43] eyes I failed you but the devil had no
[1:01:47] right take out my
[1:01:50] eyes the devil didn't give me these
[1:01:52] eyes the devil not supposed to take his
[1:01:55] eyes so he said Lord avenge me my two
[1:02:00] eyes and that prayer hit heaven and
[1:02:05] Samson cried out once more
[1:02:08] Lord and that prayer brought a
[1:02:12] restoration to Samson and tonight I am
[1:02:16] preaching tonight that there will be a
[1:02:20] restoration of a super church as we near
[1:02:25] head Church Say
[1:02:28] Amen you may be
[1:02:35] seated
[1:02:37] Hallelujah he may be seated so let me
[1:02:40] get to my message
[1:02:42] tonight Jesus came to have a super
[1:02:46] church and that super church was formed
[1:02:49] on the day of
[1:02:50] Pentecost but before the spirit could
[1:02:53] even pour out
[1:02:55] they had to have a word
[1:02:57] Revival and that's what we're doing this
[1:03:00] weekend having a Revival around the word
[1:03:04] because in the upper room they were in a
[1:03:07] word
[1:03:08] Revival they were praising God
[1:03:11] continually nobody had to tell them to
[1:03:14] shout nobody had to tell them to worship
[1:03:18] because the word was open to them the
[1:03:21] word was real to them the word made
[1:03:23] sense to them the word was present tense
[1:03:26] to them the same word that they had all
[1:03:30] along was more positive they were sealed
[1:03:34] by the word and the devil he hated them
[1:03:38] for
[1:03:39] it but he wasn't bothered he wasn't
[1:03:43] worried when they had the
[1:03:45] word but when the spirit fell on the day
[1:03:48] of
[1:03:49] Pentecost and connected with that
[1:03:52] word that's when the problem
[1:03:55] the devil's
[1:03:57] Kingdom started again because Jesus was
[1:04:01] the biggest
[1:04:02] problem that the devil ever
[1:04:05] had when Jesus died the devil was
[1:04:12] like on the day of
[1:04:14] Pentecost Satan wasn't even too
[1:04:18] worried because he did not understand
[1:04:21] what was going on but when Peter walk
[1:04:25] by the gate called
[1:04:28] beautiful and he said silver and gold I
[1:04:30] don't
[1:04:32] have but such as I have I give unto you
[1:04:36] Peter was represented the super church
[1:04:41] can the church say
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:49] hallelujah you may be
[1:04:52] seated but that church
[1:04:54] it fell into the
[1:04:56] ground that church had to die and
[1:05:00] understand this
[1:05:02] friends the devil cannot attack the
[1:05:06] spirit his only means of
[1:05:11] attack is against the
[1:05:14] word because Satan knows that when word
[1:05:17] and Spirit come
[1:05:19] together he is
[1:05:21] powerless Satan knows that when
[1:05:24] mechanics and
[1:05:26] Dynamics come together he is
[1:05:30] powerless so when that Alpha church when
[1:05:33] that super Church fell to the ground
[1:05:37] Satan he was rejoicing because the word
[1:05:41] was lost brother Bram taught
[1:05:44] us that the word is the
[1:05:47] conductor of the spirit so the
[1:05:51] conductor was
[1:05:53] damaged broken when the church fell but
[1:05:57] we thank God for the seventh
[1:05:59] angel Malachi 4 Revelation
[1:06:05] 107 Luke
[1:06:07] 17 because his ministry was to gather
[1:06:11] the scattered
[1:06:12] words and rebuild the
[1:06:15] conductor so that once more the spirit
[1:06:19] you didn't hear me tonight once more the
[1:06:23] spirit
[1:06:24] can move through the
[1:06:26] conductor so God had to wait for a
[1:06:31] people who would be the Omega word bride
[1:06:35] who would be the Omega word
[1:06:37] Bride for that
[1:06:40] people a super Church you may be
[1:06:53] seated Hallelujah why are you saying all
[1:06:56] of this brother
[1:06:57] Isaac I'm saying this tonight because
[1:07:01] the devil has no problems if you go to
[1:07:04] church the devil has no problem if you
[1:07:08] stand up the devil has no problem if you
[1:07:13] Clap the problem the devil has is when
[1:07:17] you
[1:07:17] have the same
[1:07:19] signs the same wonders the same power
[1:07:24] The Same
[1:07:25] Spirit the same anointed the devil has
[1:07:29] no problem if you lift your hands but
[1:07:32] there's coming a day when you will speak
[1:07:36] and what you say will come to pass there
[1:07:39] will come a day when you will lay hands
[1:07:43] on the
[1:07:44] sick they will recover there's coming a
[1:07:47] day butam said right now we lay hands on
[1:07:52] the sick when we have a super Church you
[1:07:56] command the
[1:07:57] demons you will command the demons get
[1:08:01] out get out get out that's the super
[1:08:05] church I'm talking
[1:08:07] [Applause]
[1:08:09] about Hallelujah Glory you don't hear me
[1:08:12] tonight you may be seated the devil has
[1:08:16] no problem when we have a convention but
[1:08:20] if you leave this
[1:08:22] convention with the bapti of the Holy
[1:08:24] Ghost then it will be a
[1:08:27] problem we are here this
[1:08:29] weekend we are here tonight to create a
[1:08:34] problem for the kingdom of the
[1:08:36] devil hallelujah hallelujah this is
[1:08:40] what came
[1:08:42] for amen
[1:08:46] seated oh

[1:08:52] God hallelujah Hallelujah you may be
[1:08:55] seated let me nail this down again the

[1:09:03] has no problem if you reading the books
[1:09:06] listening to tapes if it stays just
[1:09:10] there but there's coming a day when it's
[1:09:13] going to change the ministry of the word
[1:09:17] to the ministry of the spirit when the
[1:09:20] spirit connects to the word something
[1:09:23] happen
[1:09:24] happen something has to happen something
[1:09:27] has to happen you may se you may SE I
[1:09:32] feel like I'm in Nigeria

[1:09:39] an anointing
[1:09:41] here may be SE hallelujah hallelujah

[1:10:19] now one's the word one's the word
[1:10:24] is in your heart the devil is in
[1:10:30] trouble I don't care what clothes you
[1:10:34] have in your
[1:10:36] closet I don't care what's going on in
[1:10:39] your
[1:10:39] school the fact that you are here
[1:10:43] tonight makes you
[1:10:45] dangerous because once the word is in

[1:10:51] word said the Holy Ghost comes to give
[1:10:55] you power the Holy Ghost gives you power
[1:10:59] to overcome the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:11:02] give you power over what you are
[1:11:04] struggling with over what you are
[1:11:09] fighting be
[1:11:10] [Applause]
[1:11:12] seated the
[1:11:15] mistake the the mistake the devil made
[1:11:20] was to let you come to this convention
[1:11:25] the mistake the devil made was to let
[1:11:29] you come to this meeting because the
[1:11:32] word is being preached and the word has
[1:11:36] a
[1:11:37] seed the word is a
[1:11:39] seed it can only bring
[1:11:41] forth after its
[1:11:44] kind so the seed word you have received
[1:11:47] this
[1:11:49] weekend only produce the same
[1:11:51] life could only produce the same sign
[1:11:55] could only produce the same wonders
[1:11:57] could only produce the same Miracles and
[1:12:00] the devil cannot stop
[1:12:03] it somebody say
[1:12:05] amen he may be
[1:12:08] seated hallelujah hallelujah you may be
[1:12:12] seated hallelujah hallelujah I've
[1:12:14] already left my
[1:12:16] notes Let me say something
[1:12:20] tonight you may be seated the devil has
[1:12:25] proven that he is not as
[1:12:28] smart he's not as intelligent as he
[1:12:32] thinks he
[1:12:33] is he keeps making the same
[1:12:37] mistakes if the devil
[1:12:39] knew what was going to happen if he put
[1:12:44] Samson in the middle of the
[1:12:46] Philistines the devil would have left
[1:12:48] Samson in the
[1:12:51] prison but the devil messed up
[1:12:54] he brought
[1:12:55] Samson in the middle of
[1:12:59] Satan's and he started to laugh at
[1:13:02] him if the devil only
[1:13:04] knew what was going to
[1:13:06] happen when Jesus
[1:13:09] died he was never going to let one drop
[1:13:12] of his blood
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:14] spill he was never going to let no blood
[1:13:19] spill he would have kept Jesus
[1:13:21] alive and I say t
[1:13:24] if the devil only knew what would happen
[1:13:27] after this
[1:13:28] weekend if the devil only knew the power
[1:13:32] the Dynamics the spirit that was going
[1:13:36] to follow you because the spirit has to
[1:13:39] follow the word the spirit must follow
[1:13:43] the
[1:13:47] word hallelujah hallelujah you may be
[1:13:50] seated that is why it is so
[1:13:54] important to say what the tapes
[1:13:57] say that is why the devil fights a word
[1:14:01] so
[1:14:02] much you may be seated that's why I love
[1:14:06] what brother oid said this
[1:14:08] morning all of the tests and all of the
[1:14:11] trials and all of the problems and all
[1:14:14] of the situations are to do one
[1:14:17] thing take you away from the
[1:14:21] word so if you you can make it through
[1:14:25] whatever you are going through if you
[1:14:27] can make it through whatever you're
[1:14:30] going through and stay on the word
[1:14:33] you'll be all right so I want to
[1:14:36] encourage you don't look at the problem
[1:14:40] don't look at the
[1:14:41] situation don't look at your husband
[1:14:44] don't look at your wife don't look at
[1:14:46] your son don't look at your daughter
[1:14:50] because there's a power coming into the
[1:14:52] church
[1:14:53] you will be able to speak and your son
[1:14:57] will have to come you will speak and
[1:15:01] your daughter will have to come you will
[1:15:04] speak and the sickness will have to
[1:15:08] go there will be there will be a
[1:15:13] restoration of a super church as we near
[1:15:16] the
[1:15:18] head you may be
[1:15:22] seated
[1:15:29] Hallelujah you may be seated
[1:15:36] tonight we're going to get to the
[1:15:38] quote but I love this
[1:15:41] quote as we near The
[1:15:44] Headstone students of brother brandom's
[1:15:48] [Music]
[1:15:50] message would know that we are to Unite
[1:15:53] with the
[1:15:55] headstone we have to connect with the
[1:15:58] headstone but what is
[1:16:01] powerful but theam said we would be a
[1:16:04] super
[1:16:05] Church near The
[1:16:07] Headstone in other words before we
[1:16:11] Unite with the headstone there's a
[1:16:14] special power in the
[1:16:16] church in other words every day that
[1:16:20] passes brings me closer to the
[1:16:24] so every day that
[1:16:26] passes I'm getting more
[1:16:29] powerful so Satan should have killed me
[1:16:33] yesterday should have killed me
[1:16:35] yesterday because today I'm more
[1:16:39] powerful than yesterday and tomorrow
[1:16:43] I'll be closer to the
[1:16:44] headstone and next week be closer to the
[1:16:48] head I can almost feel it I feel it
[1:16:51] calling me why we are
[1:16:55] magnetized to The Headstone and we are
[1:16:58] getting closer we are getting closer we
[1:17:01] are getting more
[1:17:04] powerful glory to
[1:17:09] God you may be seated pleas just
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:15] one everybody feeling
[1:17:19] fine in the
[1:17:22] message
[1:17:23] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:27] forever brother Bram said we are living
[1:17:30] in the end
[1:17:32] time and I believe it's time for the
[1:17:34] restoration of the
[1:17:36] church that was promised that God would
[1:17:39] send in this last
[1:17:41] day and I believe that this is the
[1:17:44] day that when the word has been preached
[1:17:49] and the day is getting dark and so
[1:17:52] evil till according to God's
[1:17:56] word he was going to
[1:17:58] restore all that the caterpillar had
[1:18:02] eaten the Palmer worm had eaten will be
[1:18:06] restored back
[1:18:07] again in the message the restoration of
[1:18:10] the Bride
[1:18:11] tree brother Bram said now that's the
[1:18:15] tree that Joel spoke about he said it
[1:18:18] cannot
[1:18:19] die the worms eat it down but it
[1:18:23] couldn't
[1:18:24] die it root in its
[1:18:28] root it had the predestinated
[1:18:32] truth in other words no matter what the
[1:18:35] devil did he eat away
[1:18:39] everything but he couldn't kill the tree
[1:18:42] it looked
[1:18:44] broken but it was not dead can the
[1:18:47] church say Amen am hallelujah
[1:18:51] amen in the church age
[1:18:56] book brother Bram said now it says God
[1:19:00] is going to
[1:19:01] restore the Lutheran age did not restore
[1:19:05] the
[1:19:06] church it started a
[1:19:09] Reformation W age did not restore the
[1:19:13] Pentecostal age did not restore but God
[1:19:18] has to
[1:19:19] restore for he cannot deny his word
[1:19:24] brother Bram said this is not the
[1:19:26] resurrection of the
[1:19:28] church it is the
[1:19:31] restoration God will take the
[1:19:33] church right back to the Pentecost of
[1:19:36] the
[1:19:37] beginning the church say
[1:19:39] Amen all these years of being in the
[1:19:43] message was to prepare a people to be a
[1:19:47] super church just as it was in the day
[1:19:50] of
[1:19:51] Pentecost but this time was going to be
[1:19:54] different because the church the first
[1:19:58] church already went into the
[1:20:01] ground this
[1:20:03] church is the same church it's the same
[1:20:06] grain it's the same seed it's not going
[1:20:10] to go down again this church is the
[1:20:13] church to give the devil the final
[1:20:17] knockout
[1:20:18] punch you didn't hear me tonight this is
[1:20:22] the church
[1:20:23] to give the devil the final knockout
[1:20:27] punch in other words when this church
[1:20:31] takes its
[1:20:33] place the devil is
[1:20:35] finished can the church say
[1:20:39] Amen you may be seated
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:46] from with the ROM said in the same
[1:20:50] quote now notice in verse 25
[1:20:54] it tells why we need
[1:20:58] restoration said the
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:02] Locust the
[1:21:05] can the
[1:21:07] caterpillar and the pmer
[1:21:10] worm have eaten all but the root and a
[1:21:12] small bit of the
[1:21:17] stem thank
[1:21:19] you and a small bit of the stem uh
[1:21:26] um now we are told that all these
[1:21:29] insects
[1:21:31] uh are all one and the
[1:21:35] same in different stages they are the
[1:21:39] Antichrist
[1:21:41] spirit
[1:21:42] manifested and listen to what brother
[1:21:44] Brom said in
[1:21:47] organization denomination and false
[1:21:51] Doctrine through the the
[1:21:53] ages so listen to what the brother Bram
[1:21:56] is saying these four insects are the all
[1:22:00] the same in different stages it's the
[1:22:03] Antichrist spirit
[1:22:06] manifested in
[1:22:08] organization now listen he's not talking
[1:22:11] about in the
[1:22:13] world he's talking about in the church
[1:22:16] manifested manifest in organization
[1:22:19] organ denomination and false Doctrine
[1:22:23] Through the Ages and that poor little
[1:22:26] root and St is going to be
[1:22:30] restored but BR said God isn't going to
[1:22:34] plant a new
[1:22:36] church but is going to bring his
[1:22:39] original
[1:22:41] planting back to Original
[1:22:45] Seed doing it by the teaching of former
[1:22:51] rain
[1:22:53] next will come the Harvest rain or
[1:22:55] rapturing fate
[1:22:57] amen next will come the Harvest rain or
[1:23:06] rapturing can the church say
[1:23:09] Amen
[1:23:11] now there are only two
[1:23:16] influences they are not three influences
[1:23:19] they are not five influences there are
[1:23:21] only two
[1:23:23] Inu there's God there's the devil
[1:23:27] there's the Holy Ghost and there's the
[1:23:28] Antichrist Spirit can the church say
[1:23:31] Amen so when you walk and you wake up
[1:23:34] every
[1:23:35] day to know what's influencing
[1:23:38] you because what is influencing you will
[1:23:43] manifest itself a certain
[1:23:45] way so if whatever you're
[1:23:48] doing is leading to false
[1:23:51] Doctrine
[1:23:53] holding
[1:23:54] ons no
[1:23:56] forgiveness jealousy Envy that's the
[1:24:00] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost has a
[1:24:04] certain
[1:24:05] Behavior and the Holy Ghost in one
[1:24:09] person operates the same
[1:24:12] way another person the Holy Ghost cannot
[1:24:16] fight
[1:24:17] itself the Holy Ghost doesn't cause
[1:24:21] confusion
[1:24:23] the Holy Ghost does not break up
[1:24:25] families the Holy Ghost
[1:24:31] [Applause]
[1:24:34] doesn't can the church say amen
[1:24:39] amen only two
[1:24:43] influences in the message taken sides
[1:24:45] with
[1:24:46] Jesus
[1:24:50] M brother Bram say said that this
[1:24:54] message would fall into the
[1:24:58] hands of the
[1:25:00] predestinated so you didn't find this
[1:25:03] message this message found
[1:25:06] you you didn't walk into this church
[1:25:09] tonight you were called into this church
[1:25:11] tonight because Jesus said all that the
[1:25:15] father has given me they must come so if
[1:25:19] you belong to him
[1:25:21] tonight you didn't have a choice I don't
[1:25:24] care what you were doing last
[1:25:26] week what you were doing last month
[1:25:30] something on the
[1:25:31] inside just kept pulling you just
[1:25:34] pulling you what was that it's the Holy
[1:25:39] Ghost because the Holy Ghost will never
[1:25:42] lead you to do the wrong thing you may
[1:25:45] be
[1:25:46] seated can the church say Amen am
[1:25:49] everybody feeling
[1:25:51] fine
[1:25:55] just let me kneel down a few
[1:25:57] things and I'll be out of here but the
[1:26:00] brandom said four enemy
[1:26:04] agents attack the
[1:26:06] tree the
[1:26:09] P but theam said the
[1:26:12] Palmer attacks the
[1:26:15] fruit brother Bram
[1:26:17] said the first thing the first fruit he
[1:26:20] took off uh
[1:26:23] was brotherly
[1:26:25] love that's the first thing that's the
[1:26:28] one thing butam
[1:26:30] said that kills the church right
[1:26:33] there in the message the restoration of
[1:26:36] the Bride
[1:26:38] tree butam said here now the first he
[1:26:43] got to eating on the fruit of the
[1:26:46] tree and Bram said let's picture a big
[1:26:51] tree
[1:26:53] of God's
[1:26:54] tree it's bearing nine spiritual
[1:27:00] gifts they're Healing The
[1:27:02] Sick they're speaking in
[1:27:05] tongues they're casting out Devils
[1:27:08] they're doing great
[1:27:10] works and preaching the unadulterated
[1:27:13] word of
[1:27:14] God no denomination to tie them
[1:27:18] down they are free doing a great work
[1:27:23] butam said so in come this little old
[1:27:28] devil setting up with his two
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:34] horns out in front like a
[1:27:40] grasshopper and with his little old
[1:27:41] greedy
[1:27:46] teeth that's the Palmer wor he come to
[1:27:50] eat off the brotherly love
[1:27:53] then brother Bram goes on he says he
[1:27:56] wanted to eat the fruit of
[1:27:58] Faith then he eat the fruit of the joy
[1:28:01] of
[1:28:03] Salvation brother Bram said that's when
[1:28:06] they say sh you making too much
[1:28:10] noise is the
[1:28:12] Palmer that has churches dead in the
[1:28:15] message the Palmer worm has the churches
[1:28:19] dead in the
[1:28:21] message
[1:28:24] because there's no joy there's no fruit
[1:28:28] can the church say Amen so the Palmer
[1:28:31] wor eats out the fruit then brother Bram
[1:28:35] said the
[1:28:35] Locust he eats out the
[1:28:41] leaves and the leaves represent
[1:28:45] Fellowship but Bram said that the
[1:28:49] Locust breaks up the fellow ship among
[1:28:52] the
[1:28:54] church you can't you can't talk to this
[1:28:57] one you can't talk to that one you can't
[1:29:00] greet this one you're not supposed to
[1:29:02] talk to this
[1:29:03] one if you want to know who is
[1:29:07] responsible for breaking up the
[1:29:10] fellowship the Locust form of the
[1:29:12] Antichrist
[1:29:15] Spirit who tells
[1:29:18] you that you can't shake a Brother's
[1:29:21] hand
[1:29:22] that's a locust and you could tell them
[1:29:25] I said
[1:29:29] so but I didn't say it but the Bram said
[1:29:34] it can the church say
[1:29:43] Amen the
[1:29:44] Locust loc destroys the
[1:29:48] fellowship breaks up
[1:29:50] Fellowship breaks up the communion can
[1:29:53] the church say Amen brother Bram said
[1:29:57] when there's Fellowship he said the
[1:29:59] leaves they make it
[1:30:01] cool make it
[1:30:03] comfortable nice
[1:30:05] atmosphere he say it makes somebody who
[1:30:07] is
[1:30:09] Simple
[1:30:11] anybody it doesn't matter where you come
[1:30:13] from the spirit is so beautiful you
[1:30:17] shake anybody's hand they don't have to
[1:30:20] agree with you but the atmosphere is
[1:30:22] just right you can shake anybody's hand
[1:30:26] because there's Fellowship can the
[1:30:28] church say Amen but I'm saying tonight
[1:30:32] God is going to
[1:30:33] restore all that the Palmer eat all that
[1:30:37] the Locust eat God is going to restore
[1:30:40] the God is going to restore the
[1:30:43] fellowship you may be
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:50] seated
[1:30:58] he may be seated then the next one is
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:04] cankerworm and the
[1:31:06] cankerworm attacks the covering of the
[1:31:09] tree or the bark of the
[1:31:11] tree and when the covering is
[1:31:14] removed it results in dogmas and
[1:31:19] Creeds and organization
[1:31:22] wrong
[1:31:25] teaching so if you want to understand
[1:31:28] where the wrong teaching come
[1:31:30] from that's a cankerworm
[1:31:33] spirit canor
[1:31:37] form of the Antichrist
[1:31:40] Spirit and the church say amen and the
[1:31:44] last one is the
[1:31:48] caterpillar but also
[1:31:50] said woman take away the baptism of the
[1:31:53] Holy
[1:31:55] Ghost because brother Bram said as long
[1:31:59] as you're going to have the Holy
[1:32:01] Ghost it's going to shed light on that
[1:32:06] wood so the devil had to attack the Holy
[1:32:10] Ghost because the church with the Holy
[1:32:13] Ghost always shine light on the
[1:32:16] word could find the
[1:32:19] promises could always find the seed
[1:32:22] can the church say amen and the last one
[1:32:25] is the
[1:32:27] caterpillar it attacks the
[1:32:30] life it takes the life out the
[1:32:34] church the church say Amen brother and
[1:32:38] why I am a Holy
[1:32:40] Roller he said I could
[1:32:43] imagine that Jo took a
[1:32:47] binoculars and he looked into the
[1:32:50] future and he looked and seen every
[1:32:54] insect eating down the
[1:32:57] tree but he preached out I will restore
[1:33:00] say the
[1:33:02] Lord Jo he saw the church at
[1:33:06] Jerusalem he saw the Holy Ghost pour out
[1:33:10] he seen the Dark
[1:33:12] Ages he seen the tree come down to a
[1:33:17] stump he seen a tree come down but he
[1:33:20] prophesied I will
[1:33:23] restore butam said you might be able to
[1:33:27] kill the
[1:33:28] branches but the life is still there can
[1:33:31] the church say
[1:33:32] amen and brother Bram said in Mary's
[1:33:38] belief that he promised in the last
[1:33:42] days that the church would grow so
[1:33:47] close from the days of Luther to the
[1:33:50] days of Wesley
[1:33:52] to the day of Pentecost right into the
[1:33:56] headstone and we'll be getting closer to
[1:33:58] unite with the
[1:34:00] headstone so tonight if the
[1:34:04] stump had a voice that voice would speak
[1:34:08] tonight and say I don't have my branches
[1:34:11] yet but I will restore say of the
[1:34:15] Lord I don't have my leaves yet but I
[1:34:18] will restore say the Lord I don't have
[1:34:21] my
[1:34:22] yet but I will
[1:34:25] restore is there anybody feels that way
[1:34:28] tonight the church
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:40] hallelujah and this is where I got my
[1:34:42] title
[1:34:43] tonight from the message of spoken word
[1:34:45] is your Original
[1:34:48] Seed brother Bram said these last days
[1:34:53] true church Bride Comes To The
[1:34:57] Headstone will be the Super
[1:35:00] Church a super race as they near the
[1:35:03] great
[1:35:04] headstone they will be much so much like
[1:35:08] him they will be in his very image in
[1:35:12] order to be United with
[1:35:14] him they will be one they will be the
[1:35:19] very
[1:35:20] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:35:22] God denominations could never produce
[1:35:26] this went on then from a little
[1:35:30] group of the true seed of the
[1:35:33] word God will present Christ a beloved
[1:35:36] bride and I believe tonight the word is
[1:35:40] in the bride and the mind of Christ to
[1:35:43] know what he wants done with the
[1:35:45] word to know what he once done with the
[1:35:50] word can the church say amen
[1:36:00] amen so God has waited a long time for a
[1:36:05] super Church why a super Church would
[1:36:10] have to do what no other people could
[1:36:14] do all through the Bible every Prophet
[1:36:19] every judge the alpha Church
[1:36:22] even when brother Bram was
[1:36:24] here the devil was Waging
[1:36:26] War the devil was fighting a
[1:36:29] battle and the battle has been going on
[1:36:31] and on and on and on but God has reached
[1:36:34] a
[1:36:35] spot where is no be no more
[1:36:38] war the war is going to come to an end
[1:36:42] and a mighty
[1:36:43] conqueror it's going to be veil in the
[1:36:46] people can the church say amen God has
[1:36:49] waited a long time to finish the devil
[1:36:52] once and for
[1:36:54] all this time there will be no recovery
[1:36:57] for the
[1:36:58] devil this time the Egyptians you see
[1:37:02] today you will see them no
[1:37:05] more this time the darkness you see
[1:37:08] today you see no more can the church say
[1:37:13] Amen this super church will pull back
[1:37:16] the
[1:37:18] backsliders this super Church you cannot
[1:37:21] stay sick in a super Church you cannot
[1:37:25] stay dead in a super Church in a super
[1:37:30] Church

[1:37:54] power God is coming for a church signs
[1:37:58] with wonders with Miracles God is coming
[1:38:01] for a church where someone could walk
[1:38:04] into the door and they don't know Jesus

[1:38:10] God is coming for a church that's

[1:38:38] you may be seated tonight so all that we
[1:38:42] have seen over all these years have just
[1:38:46] been signs and indications to us when
[1:38:50] brother PR said sister hat you right I
[1:38:54] give you your two boys remember the said
[1:38:58] little fish I give you back your life
[1:39:00] all these were signs of what was
[1:39:03] manifested in a temporary way coming a
[1:39:07] season where it will no longer be
[1:39:10] temporary it will be permanent because
[1:39:13] the church is getting
[1:39:15] ready for a short quick
[1:39:18] message shake the whole nation
[1:39:21] this country is going to
[1:39:23] shake France is going to shake Germany
[1:39:27] is going to shake Africa is going to
[1:39:30] shake America is going to shake a super
[1:39:34] Church a super Church coming into Power
[1:39:38] you may be seated when it looked when it
[1:39:42] looked like Samson was knocked out when
[1:39:45] it looked as if Samson had no strength
[1:39:49] you may be seated what the devil didn't
[1:39:52] realize that Samson's
[1:39:54] here have been growing back all
[1:39:57] along but I want you to understand
[1:40:00] something the power was not in Samson's
[1:40:04] here what Samson's here
[1:40:07] represented Nazarite
[1:40:10] vow and the Nazarite vow was a vow to
[1:40:14] stay with the
[1:40:16] word because the Nazarite vow was a vow
[1:40:20] to maintain a certain practice or
[1:40:24] discipline we have a certain
[1:40:27] practice and we have a certain
[1:40:31] discipline Samson because he flirted
[1:40:34] with the
[1:40:35] world Samson lost his
[1:40:38] discipline instead of staying with the
[1:40:41] word Samson began to mix up the
[1:40:44] quotes he to mix up the
[1:40:47] teaching Samson lost his
[1:40:49] eyes he couldn't see with the natural
[1:40:52] eyes
[1:40:53] anymore he was forced to look with
[1:40:55] spiritual
[1:40:56] eyes all of a sudden the courts began to
[1:41:00] line back
[1:41:01] up because he couldn't look at the world
[1:41:03] no more he couldn't look at the Styles
[1:41:06] anymore he couldn't look at the Fashions
[1:41:09] anymore he couldn't look at what this
[1:41:11] preacher was
[1:41:13] preaching was locked up in
[1:41:16] prison he didn't know what was going on
[1:41:18] on the
[1:41:19] outside knew is what he heard a long
[1:41:23] time
[1:41:24] ago before he messed up before he made
[1:41:28] mistakes all Samson could have
[1:41:31] remembered was the old time
[1:41:34] religion Samson could have
[1:41:37] remembered old time Holy
[1:41:40] Ghost could
[1:41:43] remember old time
[1:41:47] Revival so while Samson was in prison
[1:41:51] the devil
[1:41:53] thought being in prison was going to
[1:41:56] stop the
[1:41:57] power whenever a man connects with the
[1:42:02] word the devil cannot stop the
[1:42:05] power because the spirit will always
[1:42:08] follow the
[1:42:09] word you may be
[1:42:12] seated while Samson was in
[1:42:15] prison here begin to grow back
[1:42:18] out while Samson was in prison
[1:42:22] he began to take back the
[1:42:24] shape the condition that he was in in
[1:42:27] his original condition you may be seated
[1:42:30] for a
[1:42:32] minute you don't hear me
[1:42:37] tonight you may be seated I want to make
[1:42:40] it real
[1:42:42] simple Samson at the beginning of his
[1:42:46] ministry brother brandom said Samson
[1:42:49] didn't have big muscles
[1:42:52] because God likes to be
[1:42:54] glorified when the odds are against you
[1:42:58] when the odds are against
[1:43:00] you so God likes to take a nobody and
[1:43:05] use his
[1:43:06] power make that nobody into
[1:43:10] somebody all samon had to do was obey
[1:43:14] the
[1:43:15] word don't cut your ha amen don't cut
[1:43:19] your ha
[1:43:21] all Samson had to do was stay with the
[1:43:25] word all Samson had to do was say what
[1:43:29] the tapes
[1:43:30] say all Samson had to
[1:43:33] do was stay with the
[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:40] word you may seated for one Samson
[1:43:45] wasn't supposed to have his own
[1:43:48] interpretation was not supposed to have
[1:43:50] his own own
[1:43:51] idea how does a man who God used so
[1:43:56] mightily God used so
[1:43:59] powerfully reached the point where he
[1:44:02] could go against God's
[1:44:04] covenant and cut his
[1:44:06] ha if you took a
[1:44:09] picture of Samson at the beginning of
[1:44:11] his
[1:44:12] ministry he had his long
[1:44:15] here if you took a
[1:44:17] picture of Samson when he was messing
[1:44:20] with the world
[1:44:23] when he was with the world
[1:44:28] with his picture was a different
[1:44:32] picture he had a different Facebook
[1:44:37] profile he changed it to one
[1:44:42] mature he didn't look the
[1:44:45] same he didn't worship the same he
[1:44:48] didn't feel the same he end up in
[1:44:51] prison but while he was in prison he
[1:44:54] started to look like his original
[1:44:57] profile
[1:44:58] picture and the devil didn't understand
[1:45:02] that when you look like how you're
[1:45:04] supposed to
[1:45:05] look God is going to do something about
[1:45:08] it can the church say
[1:45:11] Amen so there is
[1:45:13] [Applause]
[1:45:15] Samson you may be seated he lost his
[1:45:19] eyesight he can't see the world no
[1:45:22] more he doesn't see the worldly
[1:45:25] music he doesn't see the worldly
[1:45:27] Temptation he doesn't see what the young
[1:45:29] people are
[1:45:32] wearing he doesn't see what the young
[1:45:34] people are
[1:45:34] doing he's not worried about what
[1:45:37] another church is
[1:45:38] doing he is just
[1:45:40] focused take me to the
[1:45:43] pillars take me to the spot I don't want
[1:45:46] to be just anywhere but take me to the
[1:45:49] spot
[1:45:51] and what the devil didn't realize butam
[1:45:54] said everything was there and all he
[1:45:57] needed to do was
[1:45:59] pray once more Lord and Samson said he
[1:46:04] saw the
[1:46:06] possibility that he could have the same
[1:46:08] power that he had before and tonight I
[1:46:13] see the
[1:46:14] possibility that the Church of the
[1:46:16] Living
[1:46:17] God could have the power cend day of
[1:46:22] Pentecost tonight I see the possibility
[1:46:26] that the cripples could
[1:46:28] walk tonight I see the possibilities
[1:46:32] that the blind eyes could be
[1:46:36] open tonight I see the possibility that
[1:46:40] the
[1:46:41] backsliders could be restored tonight I
[1:46:45] see the possibility that you could
[1:46:47] receive the Holy Ghost tonight I see the
[1:46:51] possibility that you could have the
[1:46:54] prophecy of God
[1:46:58] manifest hallelujah hallelujah somebody
[1:47:01] say amen I believe tonight I believe
[1:47:05] tonight the same God the same God the
[1:47:09] same God the same God who wrote the word
[1:47:14] is more than able bring it to pass you
[1:47:17] may be seated God could not have a super
[1:47:22] Church in Paul Martin arus in those
[1:47:28] ages because the word had been lost so
[1:47:31] God had to send a
[1:47:33] prophet to make sure that the right
[1:47:39] people were in the right place at the
[1:47:42] right time words no matter how bad the
[1:47:46] situation
[1:47:48] was Samson could could not go to see the
[1:47:52] Philistines until God allowed his hair
[1:47:54] to grow
[1:47:56] out the
[1:47:57] church so for all these years what we've
[1:48:01] been waiting
[1:48:02] for is for the hair to grow up but I
[1:48:06] look at you tonight and I see all things
[1:48:09] are
[1:48:10] ready Lord Let the Fire
[1:48:12] Fall all things are ready you are in
[1:48:16] your
[1:48:17] place the pope is in his place the
[1:48:20] governments are in their place the VIP
[1:48:23] lounge is in its
[1:48:25] place the devil is right where he's
[1:48:27] supposed to
[1:48:28] be let's tear the devil's Kingdom down
[1:48:33] tonight can the church say
[1:48:35] Amen
[1:48:38] s is this the time for that great
[1:48:43] outpouring is this the time for the
[1:48:46] Dynamics to connect with the
[1:48:49] mechanics
[1:48:51] had the
[1:48:52] mechanics but he needed
[1:48:54] Dynamics we have mechanics we have all
[1:48:57] the work every mystery has been revealed
[1:49:01] every promise is Over You Lord let the
[1:49:05] fire can the church say amen amen
[1:49:09] hallelujah hallelujah oh I'm getting
[1:49:11] ready to close
[1:49:12] [Applause]
[1:49:16] out musicians can get ready you may be
[1:49:19] seated for a few
[1:49:22] minutes hallelujah hallelujah in the
[1:49:25] message of revelation of Jesus
[1:49:27] Christ brother Bram said let me show you
[1:49:31] another
[1:49:34] reason why Satan
[1:49:37] hates this book of the revelation of
[1:49:39] Jesus
[1:49:42] Christ in the
[1:49:44] church listen
[1:49:46] carefully he knows that Satan
[1:49:51] he knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:49:54] yesterday and today and forever now I
[1:49:58] want you to catch something friends the
[1:50:01] devil knows that Jesus Christ is the
[1:50:04] same yesterday he's the same today and
[1:50:07] he's the same forever so the devil is
[1:50:10] nervous and we know that Jesus Christ is
[1:50:14] the same yesterday the same today and
[1:50:17] the same forever and we are excited
[1:50:21] because if God did something a certain
[1:50:25] way the first time he has to do it the
[1:50:29] same way the second time because God
[1:50:33] does not change if you meet the
[1:50:36] requirements for what your need is God
[1:50:40] has to meet your
[1:50:41] need Church Say
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:49] Amen
[1:50:53] you may be seated he knows that Jesus
[1:50:56] Christ is the same
[1:50:59] yesterday and
[1:51:01] today and
[1:51:03] forever and he changes not brother Bram
[1:51:06] said he knows that a whole lot
[1:51:10] more than do 90% of the
[1:51:13] theologians
[1:51:18] um
[1:51:22] he knows that since God is immutable in
[1:51:24] his
[1:51:29] nature that he is just as immutable in
[1:51:32] his
[1:51:36] ways thus Satan
[1:51:38] knows
[1:51:40] assuredly that the original church at
[1:51:44] Pentecost with the power of
[1:51:47] God St Mark 16 in action
[1:51:51] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:51:54] his
[1:51:56] own all else is
[1:51:59] false in other words the true church the
[1:52:03] super Church would have seen Mark 16 in
[1:52:08] action in the true church in the super
[1:52:11] Church the sick cannot stay
[1:52:15] sick in the true church you will see
[1:52:18] miracles
[1:52:20] you will see signs you will see
[1:52:23] wonders listen
[1:52:25] carefully brother Brandon was so
[1:52:28] troubled that he blasted the
[1:52:32] preachers spoke against the
[1:52:34] preachers who did not preach about
[1:52:37] signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:52:42] brother Bram was
[1:52:43] troubled because
[1:52:45] prostitutes people who were not even
[1:52:48] Christians would walk in into his
[1:52:51] meetings and they would be
[1:52:54] healed and people who sat in the
[1:52:57] church were not healed and brother
[1:53:01] brought
[1:53:02] out that
[1:53:04] healing that being healed healing is not
[1:53:08] a merit of your
[1:53:10] salvation healing is a merit of your
[1:53:13] Fai if you have faith
[1:53:17] tonight you could be healed tonight
[1:53:20] you f God can restore you tonight I
[1:53:24] don't care what condition you came in
[1:53:27] here
[1:53:28] tonight you may be seated I don't care
[1:53:32] if this is the first time you are in
[1:53:35] church in 5
[1:53:37] years if you have faith that this word
[1:53:40] is
[1:53:42] real and Jesus Christ it's the same
[1:53:45] yesterday the same today the same
[1:53:48] forever God could give you a new
[1:53:52] heart God can heal you
[1:53:55] tonight of whatever
[1:53:57] sickness disase I don't care what it is
[1:54:02] you may be
[1:54:04] [Applause]
[1:54:08] seated listen friends I will close with
[1:54:12] this I believe that when God took
[1:54:16] brother Bram
[1:54:18] home
[1:54:20] Jesus never
[1:54:22] left I believe when God took his Prophet
[1:54:27] home Angel never
[1:54:30] left I believe that when that great
[1:54:34] Elijah went home the one with the swep
[1:54:38] back
[1:54:39] Wings he never left I believe that when
[1:54:43] our
[1:54:44] Elijah left that the spirit of
[1:54:48] Elijah rest upon
[1:54:51] Elisha and I believe tonight that the
[1:54:55] manifestation of the holy spirit is that
[1:54:58] angel and he is here tonight to give you
[1:55:01] whatever you need he is here tonight to
[1:55:05] heal the sick to raise the dead you the
[1:55:08] Holy Ghost Church there will be there
