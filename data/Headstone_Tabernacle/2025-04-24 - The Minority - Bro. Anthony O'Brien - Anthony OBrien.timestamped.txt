[27:34] your Bibles, we'll just read a portion
[27:36] of Psalms here from the Psalm
[27:41] 98. Psalm 98 and verse one.
[27:47] And it says, "Oh, sing unto the Lord a
[27:50] new song, for he hath done marvelous
[27:53] things. His right hand and his holy arm
[27:56] hath gotten him the victory. The Lord
[28:00] hath made known his salvation, his
[28:02] righteousness hath he openly shued in
[28:06] the sight of the heathen. He hath
[28:08] remembered his mercy, and his truth
[28:10] towards the house of Israel. All the
[28:13] ends of the earth have seen the
[28:16] salvation of our God. Make a joyful
[28:19] noise unto the Lord. All the earth, make
[28:22] a loud noise, and rejoice and sing
[28:25] praise. Sing unto the Lord with the
[28:28] harp, with the hop and the voice of a
[28:31] psalm, with trumpets and sound of
[28:34] cornet. Make a joyful noise before the
[28:36] Lord the King. Let the sea roar and the
[28:40] fullness thereof, the world and they
[28:42] that dwell therein. Let the floods clap
[28:45] their hands. Let the hills be joyful
[28:48] together before the Lord, for he cometh
[28:52] to judge the earth with righteousness.
[28:55] Shall he judge the world and the people
[28:58] with equity? May God add his blessings
[29:02] upon his holy word tonight. Let us bow
[29:05] our heads. Almighty God, we are thankful
[29:07] to be in your presence there, God.

[29:45] due season, dear God. Give us a praise

[41:09] will be his will. Amen. Well, praise
[41:12] God. Uh certainly happy to be in the
[41:13] house once more. If you have your
[41:15] Bibles, let's turn to a portion of
[41:17] scriptures. We want to read from the
[41:18] word of God. One portion of scripture we
[41:21] have for our
[41:24] um praise God. our little message
[41:27] tonight and it's taken from 1st
[41:29] Chronicles chapter 16. We'd like to read
[41:32] from verse 15 to 22 inclusive. So that's
[41:37] 1 Chronicles chapter 16 we'd like to
[41:41] read
[41:42] from and uh at this portion of the
[41:45] scripture we see
[41:47] David and uh he is uh reciting this a
[41:52] psalm before the Lord and before the ark
[41:55] of the covenant and just in the prior
[41:57] chapter we would read where David dances
[42:00] before the ark and it finally comes into
[42:02] view and they are worshiping and
[42:05] celebrating God and his testimony before
[42:08] the people. As we know, God is a God of
[42:12] testimony. And David is giving testimony
[42:14] in this psalm of how he had brought them
[42:17] out uh of a mighty long way and made
[42:20] them a peculiar people, a chosen people
[42:24] for his name's sake. And here's what it
[42:26] says. 1 Chron 1 Chronicles chapter 16
[42:30] verse 15. It says, "Be mindful always of
[42:33] his covenant, the word which he
[42:36] commanded to a thousand
[42:38] generations." Now, of course, this can
[42:40] also be found in Psalms 105. It's the
[42:42] same
[42:43] Psalm, but we wanted to take into the
[42:45] context of David here and his his praise
[42:48] that he's giving to God for for
[42:50] recognition for what God has done for
[42:53] his people. Amen. Verse 16 says, "Even
[42:57] of the covenant which he had made with
[42:59] Abraham, Amen. and of his oath unto
[43:02] Isaac. Hallelujah. And hath confir
[43:04] confirmed the saint uh to Jacob for a
[43:07] law and to Israel for an everlasting
[43:11] covenant, saying unto thee will I give
[43:14] the land of Canaan, the lot of your
[43:17] inheritance,
[43:18] when ye were but few, even a few, and
[43:24] strangers in it.
[43:26] And then they went from nation to
[43:28] nation, from one kingdom to another
[43:31] people. He suffered no man to do them
[43:35] wrong. Yay. He reproved kings for their
[43:39] sakes, saying, "Touch not mine anointed
[43:43] and do my prophets no harm." May God add
[43:46] blessing to the reading of his his holy
[43:48] word. Let's just bow our heads one more
[43:50] time. Almighty God, we are happy to be
[43:53] in your presence, Lord. We feel honored,
[43:56] Lord, that that we could come at your
[43:58] feet, Lord, and hear what you would have
[44:01] to speak to us tonight. Lord, we just
[44:03] prayed out that you take me out of the
[44:05] way, Father. Take everything out, Lord,
[44:07] that you don't want. Flush it out, kick
[44:09] it out, Lord, dear God. You put in there
[44:12] only what you what your will is tonight,
[44:14] Father. What you once said, oh God, we
[44:16] just surrender to your mighty will,
[44:18] Father. There's none like you in all the
[44:20] earth. And we look to you now. Our eyes
[44:22] are upon you, Lord Jesus. what you would
[44:25] speak to us, Lord. What you would say to
[44:27] us, Father. Your at thy word, Lord, we
[44:30] would go as you command, Father,
[44:31] tonight. May you anoint your word and
[44:34] inspire it. Breathe life into it as only
[44:37] you can do, dear God. And help us
[44:39] tonight for we are much need of thee,
[44:41] Lord. Inspire us, Lord. Inspire us to
[44:45] pray. Inspire us to action. Whatever
[44:47] your will is tonight, Lord, we just pray
[44:49] that you come and have your way tonight
[44:52] with us and in us in Jesus Christ's
[44:54] precious name. Amen. And amen. You may
[44:57] be seated.
[45:02] Hallelujah.
[45:10] Okay. Wonderful. Well, it's good to be
[45:13] here. Amen. Amen. And
[45:17] uh we thank God for his grace. So
[45:19] tonight, just have a message of
[45:22] encouragement for you. And I know we're
[45:25] coming out of the Easter weekend which
[45:27] we had such a tremendous time and again
[45:29] we thank God for what he has done among
[45:31] us. Amen. We are grateful to God. Amen.
[45:36] Praise God and certainly appreciate all
[45:38] the helps and governments that helped it
[45:40] make it possible.
[45:42] and uh you know just we couldn't do it
[45:45] alone. Amen. Uh we need all the help we
[45:47] can get and so everyone putting their
[45:49] shoulder to the wheel. Such a real
[45:50] blessing and we thank God for all of us
[45:53] and all of you and as we continue in the
[45:56] in the in the uh in the Christian way.
[45:58] Amen. Let us uh continue to serve where
[46:00] we can. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, praise
[46:03] God tonight. So, I have a thought and
[46:05] certainly want to
[46:07] uh and this just was whispered to me
[46:10] just during the weekend. something
[46:12] whispered to me and the the title of it
[46:15] was the minority.
[46:18] The minority.
[46:20] And so I I only got recently be able to
[46:22] put pen to paper for this and uh this is
[46:25] how it came out here tonight. So just
[46:27] trust in the Lord that he would fill in
[46:29] the blanks
[46:31] and uh help us tonight to bring this out
[46:33] in a way that would be encouragement to
[46:35] your heart.
[46:37] But this is the title I have tonight.
[46:39] It's what what I just got by the grace
[46:42] of God, the minority.
[46:45] And
[46:46] um and I like to start with my key
[46:49] objective. And tonight we want to prove
[46:51] and show how God has always worked with
[46:56] and will continue to work with a
[46:59] minority
[47:01] to bring his word to pass. Amen. I
[47:04] believe throughout the ages we could see
[47:06] a pattern emerging out of the scripture.
[47:10] Yes, sir. And there's many places where
[47:12] brother Brandham talks about that
[47:14] minority group,
[47:16] that little group that God's going to
[47:18] call out in the last day and so
[47:21] powerfully anoint them and shake the
[47:24] whole world with them. uh that is undeni
[47:27] undeniable at this point that that this
[47:29] is what the reality of the scripture is
[47:32] showing us that uh the glory of the
[47:35] crowd and the beauty that the world puts
[47:38] on great and enormous things
[47:41] um is not where God's mindset is at all
[47:45] when we consider the end times. As a
[47:47] matter of fact, while I was reading the
[47:49] scripture just now, I don't know if you
[47:50] could see it, but but but even in this
[47:53] scripture, we could see how God was
[47:55] glorifying that little church down there
[47:57] in the book of Acts. Few in number, but
[48:01] he suffered no man to do them wrong.
[48:03] They were few in number, but he reproved
[48:06] kings for their sakes. Touch not mine
[48:09] anointed. Do my prophets no harm. Amen.
[48:13] Amen. Hallelujah. God will not take you
[48:15] out before your time. You will stand
[48:18] there for a testimony and let the whole
[48:21] world know that he is real. That God is
[48:24] alive. That he still heals the sick.
[48:27] That he still raises the dead. That he
[48:30] is still the greatest power that this
[48:33] world has ever known and will ever
[48:35] known. And by and through the bride will
[48:38] be fulfilled all that was promised in
[48:42] the book. Isn't that right? Praise God.
[48:45] Hallelujah. So, it's all happening in a
[48:48] minority.
[48:50] It's a very it's a very paradoxical
[48:53] thing. It's a very strange thing. Uh and
[48:58] God has a way of doing that because
[49:00] because God always wants to do opposite
[49:03] to what man is doing. That's the best
[49:06] way he can show how much of God he is.
[49:09] Anytime man's mind is in a certain
[49:12] direction, usually God is in a
[49:14] completely opposite direction of
[49:17] thinking from where man is. And that is
[49:20] how God finds a way to hide himself in
[49:23] his agenda because he is doing it in a
[49:25] way that man does not expect and man is
[49:29] not looking for God. And that's exactly
[49:33] where God is. Isn't that right?
[49:37] you know and uh and how this thought
[49:39] come to me. I was thinking of how great
[49:42] God is. He is mighty. He is powerful. He
[49:46] is vast. You know, if you take this
[49:49] building, this floor plan and multiply
[49:52] it a million times that way and multiply
[49:54] it a million times in this direction and
[49:57] in this direction and in this direction,
[49:59] you still couldn't contain God. He's
[50:02] still outside of that. Uh there's no
[50:05] house that you could build for him.
[50:07] There's there's no place that you can
[50:08] contain him in. He's just greater than
[50:11] anything you've ever known. The finger
[50:14] of God can shift galaxies. And in those
[50:17] galaxies are billions of stars. And in
[50:20] those galaxies are millions of planets.
[50:22] Planets that might look just like this
[50:24] one. But somehow in all of those
[50:26] millions of planets, God chose this
[50:29] planet to move in and to create and to
[50:32] and to put man in and to look after and
[50:35] to glor be glorified in to manifest
[50:40] himself to and make himself known to oh
[50:44] the wonders of God. He is great and
[50:47] powerful. He is above all things, all
[50:50] planets, all galaxies. Our mind can't
[50:53] even begin to fathom.
[50:55] uh when we go out beyond our universe,
[50:58] it it begins to get very blurry for us.
[51:01] Uh the math and the science is just is
[51:03] not not enough. They move in quantum
[51:05] leaps. Uh it's humanly impossible to
[51:08] reach that far. And yet beyond that
[51:10] point, God is there.
[51:14] Beyond a point that you don't even can't
[51:16] even calculate anymore, God is there in
[51:19] all of this vastness. Amen. In all of
[51:22] this greatness, in all of this
[51:25] omnipotence,
[51:26] and yet with all this greatness that God
[51:29] is, yet with all of this power that God
[51:32] has, yet with all this omnipotence and
[51:35] all this omniscence that he is, there's
[51:39] one thing about God that still astounds
[51:41] the people today. And it is this, that
[51:45] God has always shown a keen interest in
[51:48] little things. Amen. As big as he is and
[51:52] as powerful as he is, as as glorious as
[51:55] he is, he somehow has always found a
[51:58] keen interest in little things. He's
[52:01] always found a keen interest in simple
[52:04] things. Even though the decree of God
[52:06] goes out, even though the love of God
[52:09] covers everything, he takes care of
[52:12] every little detail. Right in that
[52:15] grace, right in the measure of his love,
[52:19] encoded in his love is him, his care for
[52:23] you and for me and for every bird in the
[52:27] in the air and every beast of the field
[52:29] and every fish in the sea and everything
[52:31] is taken care of. Hallelujah. When you
[52:34] go down into the depths of it, into the
[52:36] details of it, yet at the blanket
[52:39] statement we could say God loves us and
[52:41] his love covers the world. But when we
[52:43] go drill down deeper, we see love over
[52:46] here. We see love in a blade of grass.
[52:49] We see love in the petal of a flower. We
[52:51] see love in the wings of a butterfly. We
[52:54] see love in the laugh of a baby. God is
[52:57] interested. He is encoded. He is in
[53:00] involved in every little thing. The
[53:03] little details about our lives that that
[53:06] if we look closely enough, we'll see God
[53:09] because God love you so much. He
[53:11] wouldn't let harm come to you. He loved
[53:13] you so much that he took care of you
[53:15] even when you weren't looking. He took
[53:17] care of you when you weren't paying
[53:19] attention. He was looking out for you to
[53:22] make sure that you could come to your
[53:24] time. That you could come to your
[53:26] season. That you could come to your day
[53:28] of fruition. That no weapon formed
[53:31] against you will prosper. God made sure.
[53:34] The Bible said he set his angels charge
[53:37] over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[53:40] unless you dash thy foot against a
[53:43] stone. God loves you so much that he
[53:46] doesn't want your foot to dash against a
[53:49] stone.
[53:50] And that's just us here tonight. Think
[53:52] about the thousands and millions of
[53:54] people just like you that he is also
[53:57] taking care of.
[53:59] Uh but he knows it all and he's in
[54:01] control of it all. Amen. Yet he loves it
[54:04] all. Even the littlest thing. Even the
[54:07] smallest thing. Isn't that right? Every
[54:10] member of the body is important to God.
[54:12] Even brother Bannon was making that
[54:14] reference that I wouldn't want to lose
[54:16] my little toe. I wouldn't want to lose
[54:18] my little finger. I may not use it much,
[54:21] but I don't want to lose it. It belongs
[54:23] to me. It's a it's a part of me. Uh uh
[54:26] it's precious to me. And if I could keep
[54:28] it, I would. I would keep it. Praise
[54:30] God. As long as I could. And that's the
[54:32] way God feels about every little part of
[54:35] the body. To some people, it may not
[54:37] feel significant. To some people, it may
[54:40] not feel like something that's great.
[54:42] Praise God. Amen. Or glorious. To some
[54:44] people, it might just be a fiveminute
[54:46] ministry. But no matter how short it
[54:48] might seem, no matter how insignificant
[54:51] you might feel, you are very important
[54:54] to God, doesn't matter how small the
[54:57] world makes it out to appear, it is
[54:59] still very important to God because he
[55:02] is interested in every little thing.
[55:06] He's interested in every little personal
[55:09] because they all play a part, a vital
[55:12] and key role in the economy of God. and
[55:16] how things move and how things happen
[55:19] and everyone has a contribution to make.
[55:24] Amen. Isn't that right?
[55:27] So with even with all this greatness,
[55:29] see, he's still interested in the little
[55:32] things. He's always found pleasure and
[55:34] worked with and hid himself in those
[55:37] very little things. Hallelujah. What God
[55:39] calls wise, man calls foolish. And what
[55:43] God calls foolish is called the wisdom
[55:46] of men. Isn't that right? And human
[55:49] beings by nature we are usually in awe
[55:52] of great things. We are in awe of
[55:56] vastness of something that is great or
[55:58] big or enormous. Uh we live in a world
[56:02] where they're always trying to do the
[56:03] next big thing. Isn't that right? We are
[56:06] greatly impressed by it. Everyone
[56:09] thought the Empire State Building was
[56:11] one of the biggest, most to power
[56:13] powerful, biggest towering uh uh
[56:15] buildings in the world at that time when
[56:18] it was built, I guess, in the 1930s or
[56:19] whatever. Until they built something
[56:21] bigger than that until now, the biggest
[56:23] building is not even in America. It's
[56:25] now in Dubai. It's called the Burj
[56:27] Khalifa. The tallest building in the
[56:30] world. And and they just keep going
[56:31] taller and taller and taller. Isn't that
[56:34] right? And bigger. Isn't that right? Man
[56:37] is usually in in awe of greatness.
[56:39] Greatness tends to overwhelm us. We want
[56:42] the biggest houses. We want to drive the
[56:45] biggest cars. We want to swim in the
[56:47] biggest swimming pools, own the biggest
[56:48] yachts, build the biggest stadiums,
[56:50] build the tallest massive tower, build
[56:53] the biggest mall. Isn't that right? More
[56:55] and more shopping, more commerce, more
[56:57] industry. When we think of God as
[57:00] great as well, we should. But whenever
[57:03] God wants to do something, especially
[57:05] when he wants to do it in secret, he
[57:08] hides it in something very simple. He
[57:12] hides it in something so humble that you
[57:15] would pass by you if you're not looking
[57:17] for it. Hallelujah. It would just bump
[57:20] you on the street and keep on going.
[57:22] There goes a man that God can use. So
[57:26] simple, but yet so great and so
[57:28] powerful. All the big distractions of
[57:30] the world could get you caught up in the
[57:32] spirit of that and miss and see what God
[57:35] is doing today right among the people.
[57:38] You could miss what God is doing right
[57:40] among us if you're not in the spirit of
[57:43] it to see what God sees. Amen. Praise
[57:47] God. It's not right. But we're here to
[57:48] see what God sees tonight.
[57:51] God wants to fix our eyes upon Jesus
[57:54] Christ. He wants to fix our mind to let
[57:57] the same mind that was in Christ be in
[57:59] us. That we could love the way he loves.
[58:02] That we could forgive the way he
[58:04] forgives. That we could see each other
[58:06] the way God sees us. That God is with
[58:10] the little person. He's with the big
[58:12] person. He's with the medium shot. He's
[58:14] with the rich and the famous. He's with
[58:16] the homeless and everybody in between.
[58:19] Because at the end of the day, we are
[58:21] all God's children. and he still loves
[58:24] all of us the same. And no matter what
[58:27] your bank account looks like or what
[58:29] kind of shoes you're wearing or or what
[58:31] kind of social status you've got, God
[58:34] still loves you. And God wants to put
[58:36] that love in our hearts that we could
[58:39] reflect him. When we live and we act and
[58:43] do amen.
[58:45] Amen. We could reflect God. I believe
[58:48] that's the purpose. And Barham said,
[58:50] "Eternal life is living for others." And
[58:54] that's what we want to be tonight. Amen.
[58:56] Amen. The prophet said, "Hey, God keeps
[58:58] his word." The church of God has always
[59:00] been in the minority.
[59:02] Until Jesus comes, he said, "Fear not,
[59:05] little flock. It's your father's
[59:07] goodwill to give you the kingdom."
[59:10] That's right. We are in the minority. He
[59:14] said, "But that's all right.
[59:16] As long as God is there, it's still a
[59:20] majority to me. He said, "And I know it
[59:23] is to you. For if God is with you, then
[59:26] who can be against you?"
[59:30] Many, many men. So, if you're in the
[59:31] minority tonight, that's all right. As
[59:34] long as God is there, you're still in
[59:37] the majority. Even if you're in the
[59:40] minority because God makes up the rest.
[59:43] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Where the twos
[59:46] and trees are gathered, there he is in
[59:48] the midst. Where the twos and trees are
[59:51] gathered, as long as he is there, he can
[59:54] fill the void. Do you need healing? He
[59:57] can be the healer. Right in that
[59:59] minority. He can be the sealer. He can
[1:00:02] be the deliverer. He can be the
[1:00:04] restorer. He can be the reclaimer. He
[1:00:07] can be the baptizer. He can raise you
[1:00:09] up.
[1:00:12] Oh, he can become something.
[1:00:15] when the when the opportunity is
[1:00:17] presented
[1:00:18] for him to become something in that
[1:00:22] environment. And I believe that's the
[1:00:23] beauty of the minority. Hallelujah. Most
[1:00:26] times the people are just in a certain
[1:00:28] mindset. They they they're not great in
[1:00:30] number. They are not looking for numbers
[1:00:33] to win the battle. Uh because if they
[1:00:36] look to numbers, they will fail. If they
[1:00:38] look to their own resources or their own
[1:00:40] power or their own skill sets, it's just
[1:00:42] a few of them. what can they do? And
[1:00:44] when they turn their eyes towards God,
[1:00:47] when they begin to turn their eyes
[1:00:48] towards the Lord and say, "Lord, we
[1:00:50] don't have enough. We need more. We need
[1:00:53] something or else we're not going to
[1:00:55] make it." Then in that
[1:00:57] desperation, God can now reach down and
[1:01:00] fill a need that is there. But when the
[1:01:03] numbers are there, people get more
[1:01:04] confident in their numbers. They get
[1:01:06] more confident in their ability to raise
[1:01:08] funds. If each one of us throw $50, we
[1:01:10] could raise enough funds to do this. and
[1:01:12] we could do enough to do that. And they
[1:01:14] have the money and the financial backing
[1:01:16] and the social status and they have
[1:01:18] favor and people in high places. But
[1:01:20] when you don't have much to work with,
[1:01:22] that's when Jesus becomes your
[1:01:24] everything. When you don't have a lot to
[1:01:27] go on, that's when he becomes your all
[1:01:29] in all. When you run out of things to
[1:01:32] do, when you run out of things to say,
[1:01:35] when you run out of ways to help
[1:01:37] yourself, when you run out of money and
[1:01:39] the doctors don't have an answer, that's
[1:01:42] when he becomes everything because you
[1:01:45] recognize how much of a nothing you are
[1:01:48] and how much of God you need.
[1:01:52] The world needs to come back into that
[1:01:54] place. They ever want to find God again.
[1:01:57] Amen. They have to turn away from all
[1:01:59] this science and civilization and
[1:02:01] technology that they have hinged their
[1:02:04] lives upon and they have to begin to
[1:02:06] rest their souls upon Christ in order to
[1:02:09] see a real difference. Amen. Many are
[1:02:12] called but but few are chosen to do
[1:02:14] that. Blessed are you tonight. Happy are
[1:02:16] you tonight. You are chosen by God to
[1:02:20] see what you see and to hear what you
[1:02:22] hear. That your heart could be allowed
[1:02:24] to be convicted.
[1:02:27] to turn the corner and to turn your eyes
[1:02:30] upon Jesus.
[1:02:32] Amen. We are a blessed people tonight.
[1:02:35] Amen. Praise God. So, and so there's
[1:02:39] something called the herd mentality. I
[1:02:40] don't know if you or the herd instinct.
[1:02:42] I don't know if you know about it. Um
[1:02:45] but it's something that's built into
[1:02:46] your DNA as a human being. It's a
[1:02:49] natural response. Whenever we see a
[1:02:51] large crowd of people going or standing
[1:02:53] in a particular direction or they're
[1:02:56] doing something, usually it causes an
[1:02:59] attraction to you, the individual. You
[1:03:02] see a large crowd like the one there is
[1:03:04] tonight down by the rally. Yeah. Look
[1:03:07] all looking in this direction to see
[1:03:09] what's taking place over there. What's
[1:03:12] all this noise about? What all the music
[1:03:14] about? You know, what's all these crowds
[1:03:16] of people about? And usually it draws
[1:03:19] the attention away. You know, uh uh uh
[1:03:22] people want to know what's going on down
[1:03:23] there. Uh there are social experiments.
[1:03:26] There are social experiments, I'm sure
[1:03:27] on the internet, maybe YouTube, you
[1:03:28] might have seen them where they would
[1:03:30] get a a whole crowd of people, like
[1:03:32] about 100 people, like a mass crowd, and
[1:03:35] they would just do this experiment where
[1:03:36] they would get them to run down a
[1:03:38] street, you know, and just to see what
[1:03:40] people will do, what what their response
[1:03:42] would be. Nine times out of 10, the
[1:03:44] people would look in the direction the
[1:03:46] crowd is running away from to see what
[1:03:48] they're running away from. And then they
[1:03:50] might run along with the crowd. Even if
[1:03:52] they don't know what's happening,
[1:03:54] they're still running with them. Amen.
[1:03:57] And this is something that is just
[1:03:58] encoded in us as people because we tend
[1:04:01] to follow the crowd. We tend to go with
[1:04:04] the crowd even if we don't have a
[1:04:06] reasonable explanation for what's
[1:04:08] happening, why people are running, why
[1:04:11] people are shouting. Uh but we just do
[1:04:13] it. It's something we do. We we as human
[1:04:16] beings, we are drawn to the crowd.
[1:04:19] Whether it's out of fear or whe it's out
[1:04:21] of excitement or whatever it is, we are
[1:04:23] drawn to it. Isn't that right? And I can
[1:04:26] only imagine how the crowd was when
[1:04:28] Jesus was was being accused of uh uh uh
[1:04:32] this crime that he said he'd committed.
[1:04:34] Uh and they brought him out before the
[1:04:36] people and they said, "Who do you want
[1:04:39] uh uh to lead uh uh to be uh set free?
[1:04:41] Do do you want this Jesus praise of
[1:04:44] Nazareth or do you want uh called the
[1:04:46] king of the Jews or do you want Barabus?
[1:04:48] Praise God. Isn't that right? And they
[1:04:50] began to say, "Give us Barabus. Give us
[1:04:52] Barabus." And the whole crowd went after
[1:04:55] them. Sure, it probably was a few angry
[1:04:58] Pharisees who started up the crowd, but
[1:05:00] pretty soon everybody got on the train
[1:05:03] and started shouting, "Give us Barabus.
[1:05:05] Give us Barabus." 90% of them don't even
[1:05:07] know what they're saying. Amen. But they
[1:05:10] are but they are they are they are
[1:05:12] slowly but surely finding themselves in
[1:05:14] the throngs of of evil and death uh
[1:05:17] because they are denying Jesus Christ in
[1:05:20] that moment and they are exonerating a
[1:05:23] murderer uh they exonerating a criminal
[1:05:26] as it were and no wonder can Jesus could
[1:05:29] come while he was on the cross and say
[1:05:31] father forgive them for they know not
[1:05:35] what they do. There's a lot of people
[1:05:37] tonight that are following the crowd and
[1:05:40] they don't know what they're actually
[1:05:42] doing. There's a lot of people that are
[1:05:44] following the crowd tonight that are
[1:05:46] running to the people in droves where
[1:05:48] the people are, where the crowds are,
[1:05:50] where the noise is. Hallelujah. They are
[1:05:53] going and trying to do what they think
[1:05:54] is supposed to be right, what they think
[1:05:56] is instinctually right. And yet they
[1:05:58] don't know what they are doing tonight.
[1:06:00] Many of them are lost. Many of them are
[1:06:03] misguided. Many of them don't have a
[1:06:05] leader. Many of them are running and
[1:06:07] going uh hellbound into hell. Isn't that
[1:06:10] right? Praise God. They're running.
[1:06:11] They're breaking all of the red lights,
[1:06:13] going straight to hell, following the
[1:06:16] crowd. When Jesus said, "Straight is a
[1:06:18] gate and narrow is the way. Few there be
[1:06:22] that find it." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] And that word straight doesn't mean a
[1:06:29] straight gate like a straight line, but
[1:06:31] it's something peculiar. It's something
[1:06:33] you'll miss if you're not looking for
[1:06:35] it. You'll miss that turn if you're not
[1:06:38] looking out for the gate, praise God,
[1:06:40] that leads to righteousness. There are
[1:06:42] very few that are going to go out there.
[1:06:45] But I'm so happy tonight that God tapped
[1:06:48] us each on the shoulder. And while we
[1:06:50] were heading in the crowd, while we were
[1:06:53] chipping down the road, while we were
[1:06:55] hellbound, someone tapped us on the
[1:06:58] shoulder and said, "Have you noticed the
[1:07:00] straight gate on your left?" Oh,
[1:07:02] hallelujah. Why don't you come aside
[1:07:04] with me? I want to show you something. I
[1:07:07] want to reveal something. I want to tell
[1:07:09] you something that you you have heard
[1:07:11] before because before the foundation of
[1:07:14] the world, there was a seed inside your
[1:07:16] soul. You don't know that now, but you
[1:07:19] knew it then. And when the sons of God
[1:07:22] were sen together, you were there in the
[1:07:25] beginning. You were there before the
[1:07:28] beginning. Oh, hallelujah. And God wants
[1:07:30] to reconnect with you and take you
[1:07:33] through that straight gate. Pass you
[1:07:36] through that narrow way. That narrow way
[1:07:39] that leads to repentance. That narrow
[1:07:41] way that leads to salvation. That narrow
[1:07:43] way that leads to forgiveness. That
[1:07:45] narrow way where men pow before the feet
[1:07:48] of God. When men go through the desert,
[1:07:51] go through the wilderness with God and
[1:07:53] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:56] That narrow way that changes you. That
[1:07:58] narrow way that transforms you. That
[1:08:00] narrow way that burns all the filth,
[1:08:02] burns all the muck, burns all the evil
[1:08:05] out of your life, puts forgiveness in
[1:08:07] your soul, puts charity in your heart.
[1:08:10] It's a narrow way. Oh, it's a road less
[1:08:13] traveled. But it's a road we got to take
[1:08:15] tonight. It's a road that leads to
[1:08:17] Calvary. It's a road that leads to the
[1:08:19] cross. It's a road that leads to our
[1:08:21] debt. It's a road that leads to our
[1:08:23] burning, to our sacrifice.
[1:08:27] And then a crown
[1:08:30] would be laid up for you
[1:08:32] when you pay that price.
[1:08:35] Amen. And amen.
[1:08:38] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] So we don't want to be doing the natural
[1:08:44] inclination
[1:08:45] cuz that's just human nature. See,
[1:08:48] following the crowd, what it gives us a
[1:08:50] sense of security, a sense of community,
[1:08:53] a sense of belonging that you naturally
[1:08:55] would like. That's something you want,
[1:08:58] you know, and the devil knows that. He
[1:08:59] knows you want to feel like you belong
[1:09:03] somewhere. And so he presents the crowd
[1:09:06] as an idea, as something to follow. Look
[1:09:08] how many people there is. You know, it
[1:09:10] can't be wrong if there are so many
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:13] people. Huh? Nobody goes by the doubles
[1:09:17] man who hardly have anybody standing
[1:09:18] next to him. Everybody want to follow
[1:09:21] the crowd. I have to be tasting good if
[1:09:24] there's so many people at his stand and
[1:09:27] there's none on the other side. I think
[1:09:30] I'll go where the people are cuz it
[1:09:33] sounds like look like he have the taste.
[1:09:36] Isn't that right? And the devil is like
[1:09:38] this. He He's like the candyman. He
[1:09:41] makes the world taste good and he has
[1:09:43] the crowd going cutting the price in
[1:09:46] half. Keep them coming. Isn't that
[1:09:48] right? Praise God. But it's death.
[1:09:50] People say this is life. Brothers used
[1:09:53] to say it, you know, people say that's
[1:09:54] how life is. No, that's death. That's
[1:09:57] how death is. They calling it life, but
[1:10:00] it's really death. Disguised as a crowd,
[1:10:03] as an attraction. Praise God. But God
[1:10:05] has a different attraction tonight. A oh
[1:10:08] so humble attraction, a peculiar
[1:10:10] attraction, but it's his attraction
[1:10:12] tonight. Amen. And it's attraction of
[1:10:15] his word. And that's what we want to
[1:10:17] follow tonight. Amen. It's nothing that
[1:10:19] anybody would desire in themselves, but
[1:10:22] it's something God put in our hearts to
[1:10:24] reveal to us. And it give us a gladness,
[1:10:27] a joy, a wonder, an amazement when his
[1:10:30] revelation pours down in you. Amen.
[1:10:32] Amen. All of a sudden, begin to do
[1:10:34] things that people don't normally do.
[1:10:36] You begin to follow the lesser crowd
[1:10:38] that people wouldn't normally follow.
[1:10:41] But it's because God has influenced your
[1:10:43] life and you're doing something very,
[1:10:46] very different. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] Isn't that right? Praise God. Amen. So,
[1:10:51] so, so that's that's what goes on. The
[1:10:53] crowd doesn't make it right. Isn't that
[1:10:55] right? Following the crowd where the
[1:10:59] purpose is wrong, if you follow a crowd
[1:11:01] where the purpose is wrong, then the
[1:11:03] crowd is wrong, too. Following that
[1:11:05] crowd doesn't make you right. If the
[1:11:07] purpose is wrong, isn't that right?
[1:11:09] Isn't that right? So, so, so, uh, it's
[1:11:13] about the objective. It's about what
[1:11:15] we're trying to achieve. And it's about
[1:11:17] who or what is leading that crowd. It's
[1:11:21] about who or what is leading that
[1:11:23] audience. Where they are pointing the
[1:11:25] people to. Nothing wrong with a crowd if
[1:11:28] the objective is right. That's right. If
[1:11:30] the purpose is right. There was a big
[1:11:31] crowd following around Jesus. He was the
[1:11:33] only one who could heal them. Sure,
[1:11:35] there's a time for a crowd then. Praise
[1:11:37] God. But even in that crowd, there are
[1:11:39] chosen few who really have faith to pull
[1:11:42] from Jesus the things that they really
[1:11:44] want to get. So, it's still not about
[1:11:46] the crowd so much, but it's about the
[1:11:49] individuals in the crowd. And that's who
[1:11:52] God works with. He always works with
[1:11:55] individuals who have a personal
[1:11:57] revelation, who have a personal
[1:11:59] understanding.
[1:12:01] And that is what can work the things of
[1:12:03] God. That is what can tug on the
[1:12:06] heartstrings of God because they see
[1:12:08] something. They see God in the midst of
[1:12:11] all that is happening in the natural or
[1:12:12] whatever it is, but they could see
[1:12:14] something that's real. There it's almost
[1:12:16] like they could grab God's arm in spite
[1:12:18] everybody's they can't look around. They
[1:12:20] look around. They can't see God
[1:12:21] anywhere. But these people to whom the
[1:12:23] word is revealed have a revelation. They
[1:12:26] could see God in every little thing.
[1:12:29] Praise God. Amen. They don't take prayer
[1:12:31] for granted. They don't take praise for
[1:12:32] granted. They don't take church for
[1:12:34] granted. They don't take worship for
[1:12:35] granted. No. Everything to them is an
[1:12:37] opportunity to get through the door.
[1:12:40] They didn't come by chance. They didn't
[1:12:42] come to occupy a space. They didn't come
[1:12:44] to take up time. No, no, no. They didn't
[1:12:46] come to waste. No, no, no. They come to
[1:12:48] get something from the Lord. And that is
[1:12:51] who God could work it. That is the kind
[1:12:53] of faith that shakes God. That'll shake
[1:12:56] him and bring him on the scene. Praise
[1:12:58] God. And that's the kind of people he
[1:13:00] wants today. When the Son of Man cometh,
[1:13:03] shall he find faith on the earth? Faith
[1:13:06] that moves God into action. Oh,
[1:13:09] hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's what we
[1:13:11] need tonight. A faith like we never
[1:13:13] known before. Amen. An anointed faith.
[1:13:18] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So, nothing
[1:13:20] wrong with the crown, but it all depends
[1:13:22] on where it's leading them. See, and
[1:13:25] what they're trying to actually achieve.
[1:13:27] Isn't that right? And there's an
[1:13:29] argument that says that uh the Roman
[1:13:31] Catholic Church and it's just so funny
[1:13:33] that the the last pope has just passed
[1:13:36] away. They've been going through
[1:13:37] transition. Isn't that right? And uh you
[1:13:40] see the millions of people coming to see
[1:13:42] the body and the go flying to Rome. Is
[1:13:46] that right? To to see what's happening
[1:13:48] out there, to see the death of this pope
[1:13:50] and to mourn and so forth. And when you
[1:13:53] just look at it, it's amazing. millions
[1:13:55] of people around the world, different
[1:13:57] places, North America, South America,
[1:13:59] Latin America, you know, Europe, Asia,
[1:14:01] they come from everywhere, you know, and
[1:14:04] uh and uh it's amazing. And they and
[1:14:05] they say, well, look at the Roman
[1:14:07] Catholic Church. Some people might say
[1:14:08] we follow the Roman Catholic Church. One
[1:14:11] maybe because they're one of the oldest
[1:14:13] religions in the world. It's an argument
[1:14:14] people like to make. Praise God. They've
[1:14:16] been around a long time, so they must
[1:14:18] know what they're doing. Another
[1:14:20] argument they make is because they have
[1:14:21] so many members across the world, so
[1:14:24] many prominent people in society are
[1:14:25] devoted Catholics. Surely there must be
[1:14:28] something right about it if so many
[1:14:30] people are following in it. But that's
[1:14:32] not how God thinks. That's not how God
[1:14:35] acts. He don't need a crowd. He doesn't
[1:14:38] need a big religion. God works with
[1:14:41] individuals tonight. Isn't that right?
[1:14:44] Praise God. Let's take up a story. God
[1:14:47] calls Noah. Isn't that right? Amen. In
[1:14:49] Genesis 6 and 1, it says, "And it come
[1:14:51] to pass when men begin to multiply on
[1:14:53] the face of the earth." Look at the
[1:14:54] condition in that
[1:14:56] antidian age, the world was multiplying
[1:14:59] at a rapid pace. I don't know how many
[1:15:01] children there were per family, but it
[1:15:02] was getting kind of out of hand. Isn't
[1:15:04] that right? And the line of Lemch was
[1:15:06] coming to its end. Noah and his family
[1:15:08] was almost the last of it. Isn't that
[1:15:10] right? And God calls Noah and he said,
[1:15:13] "Come to pass when the men begin to
[1:15:14] multiply upon the face of the earth and
[1:15:16] the and daughters were born unto them."
[1:15:18] The Bible said, "The sons of God saw
[1:15:20] that the daughters of men were fear and
[1:15:23] they took to them wives which he had all
[1:15:24] chose. And the Lord said, "My spirit
[1:15:27] shall not always strive with man. For he
[1:15:30] also is flesh, and yet his day shall be
[1:15:34] 120 years." Amen. So God already set a
[1:15:37] time limit for when this thing is going
[1:15:39] to run up to. It's not going to run into
[1:15:41] your year 121. No, no, no, no. They're
[1:15:44] going to be a different world at year
[1:15:46] 121. Isn't that right? Praise God. 120
[1:15:49] years. That is the border that man
[1:15:51] cannot pass as far as the antilian world
[1:15:54] is concerned. Isn't that right? My and
[1:15:57] verse four, it said there were giants in
[1:15:59] the earth in those days. And also after
[1:16:01] that, when the sons of God came into the
[1:16:03] daughters of men, they bare children
[1:16:05] unto them, and they became mighty men
[1:16:07] were old and men of renown and so forth.
[1:16:10] And God saw that the wickedness of man
[1:16:12] was great in the earth and that every
[1:16:15] imagination of the thought of their
[1:16:17] heart was only evil continually. Oh my,
[1:16:21] what a condition. Amen. More people,
[1:16:23] more problems, more situation, more
[1:16:25] evil. Isn't that right? And it repented
[1:16:28] the Lord that he had made man on the
[1:16:31] earth and it grieved him at his heart.
[1:16:34] And the Lord said, I will destroy man
[1:16:37] who I have created from the face of the
[1:16:40] earth, both man and beast, and the
[1:16:43] creeping thing, and the fowls of the
[1:16:45] air, for it repented me that I have made
[1:16:48] them. But Noah, verse 8, found grace in
[1:16:53] the eyes of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:16:56] God found grace in one man. One man
[1:16:59] called Noah. And that man represented
[1:17:02] his family. Oh, hallelujah. Noah and his
[1:17:05] family, glory to God, found grace in the
[1:17:08] eyes of God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:11] What a picture tonight. Oh, I can only
[1:17:13] imagine God looked down at the earth now
[1:17:15] and God is looking for hearts who would
[1:17:18] serve him, who would love him in this
[1:17:20] untoward and wicked generation. There's
[1:17:22] so much evil, so much technology, so
[1:17:24] much this and so much that. Pray the
[1:17:26] people kick God out. They kick him out
[1:17:28] of their homes. Kick him out of society.
[1:17:31] Kick him out of the church. Kick him out
[1:17:33] of America. God is on the door knocking.
[1:17:36] Oh, hallelujah. Open somebody would open
[1:17:38] the door. And yet in all of that, God
[1:17:40] has found a people tonight. God has
[1:17:43] found you tonight. Individuals that he
[1:17:46] could veil himself in. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:17:49] Hallelujah. You might look like much,
[1:17:51] but you will have God inside of your
[1:17:54] flesh, inside of your hands, inside of
[1:17:57] your feet. You might be few in number,
[1:18:00] but touch not my anointed. Do my
[1:18:03] prophets no harm. Oh, God's going to
[1:18:05] have his anointed ones in the end time.
[1:18:08] They're going to heal the sick. They're
[1:18:10] going to raise the dead. They're going
[1:18:12] to cast out devils. They're going to
[1:18:14] walk with power. They might look like
[1:18:16] much. Humble women, simple men, but God
[1:18:20] will fail in you. The mighty God that
[1:18:22] created the earth will be speaking
[1:18:24] through your lips and out of it will
[1:18:26] flash like lightning. Rainbow glory. Oh
[1:18:30] h whatever you say will be bats because
[1:18:33] you'll be adopted and perfected and set
[1:18:36] in the book of life. Oh hallelujah. And
[1:18:39] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[1:18:43] living water. Somebody give the Lord a
[1:18:45] shout of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah.
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:53] Oh, revive us once more. God will have a
[1:18:57] church full of the Holy Ghost. Oh,
[1:19:00] hallelujah. Hallelujah. He'll do it. Oh,
[1:19:05] hallelujah.
[1:19:07] He can do it in one year.
[1:19:09] All that they failed to do in thousands
[1:19:11] years, in a thousand years, God could do
[1:19:15] it. Hallelujah. In less than no time.
[1:19:17] Amen. Praise God. Cuz he's God. That's
[1:19:21] what he can do. Amen. Noah found grace
[1:19:24] in the eyes of God. That's wonderful.
[1:19:27] And we found grace in his eyes tonight.
[1:19:29] Isn't that wonderful? He said, "These
[1:19:32] are the generations of Noah." Noah's
[1:19:33] just a man perfect in his generations.
[1:19:35] And Noah walked with God. What a
[1:19:38] testimony. I believe that's what God
[1:19:40] wants to hear of you tonight. He walked
[1:19:43] with God. She She walked with God. Amen.
[1:19:46] enter Scotia Bank. She walked with God
