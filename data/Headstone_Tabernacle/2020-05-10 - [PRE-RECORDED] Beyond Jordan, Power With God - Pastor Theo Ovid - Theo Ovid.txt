reason that we live today we have a lot to be thankful to God for the health and strengthen a knee men so we want to give him praises and and glorify his name and acknowledge his Lord this morning or give the Lord a shout in the priest Holmes amen all glory to God so this morning our summing up on my heart that a bit law believe the Lord gave me to share with you this morning we want to go straight into the word we have no comments so copy style we want to look at 2nd Kings chapter 2 wanna read verse 6 to 15 we also want to read from Genesis chapter 32 we didn't found those 22 to 30 we didn't 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 6 to 15 and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan and he said as this as the Lord liveth as I so livid I will not leave thee and they went to Dundee to went on and fifthly of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view far off and they stood by Jordan Elijah took his mantle wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground came the pass when they were gone over and Elijah sent Elijah asked what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee letter the proportion of thy spirit be upon me and he said DARS asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold appeared a child of fire horses a fan patted them but a son Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven Elijah soil and he cried my father my father charit of Israel and the horseman thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah the fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah when he had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elijah went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah dot rest on Elijah and they wake him to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him Genesis chapter 32 we're gonna read from 22 to 30 this is Jacob on his way to meet his brother gonna meet the angel first 22 and he rose up that night this is a Genesis chapter 32 verse 22 he rose up that night took his two wives his two woman servants his eleven sons and passed them over the ford shabak and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had was 24 I love this verse Jacob was left alone and they wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day break it and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me he said unto Him what is thy name he said Jacob he said thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince has dog power with God and with men and has prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I proceed I named he said wherefore is it that thou ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place Peniel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved let's pray father how we thank you for these anointed scriptures this morning and we pray that your anoint each and every one of us to hear your word anoint me to speak your word I mean life Lord the seed go to taking on life come and confirm your would with signs wonders and miracles are not porn of your spirit granted father in GSM I ask it amen and amen you may be seated go praise Lord oh praise God we'll have a title this morning beyond Jordan power with God and have an inspiration power with God I want to really tongue the Lord whereas Stephen Oliveri give me a scripture and was so fitting and we exhorted on it for the Promethean on Tuesday and I want to read back that scripture from Luke chapter 951 you don't have to find it but it says that it came to pass is about Jesus now when the time has come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem so when Jesus recognized the time is drawing near for him to be crucified he he set his face steadfastly towards Jerusalem you have to fix your position towards your destination you have to get focused on where you're going that's what Jesus did earlier on when they tried to grab him he said you can't touch me he's a my always not yet come but when his time was upon him he's in my all is come but the Son of Man be glorified he knew the time and the season but notice he didn't duck it he was facing towards it and we have ducked this part we go into this morning a long time you can't duck it no more you can't hide from it no more you can't run from it just no more this is a special service we are not dealing with any external enemies you're not dealing with your neighbour your boss your husband your wife you're not dealing with some church out there some pasta in the deccan there was nobody out here it's just you going down to Jordan you sent to Jordan you cross and Jordan and you have to go beyond Jordan to receive what you must receive those could be say Amen this morning so Jesus was looking towards his Jordan looking towards Calvary now this is Balarama God called man and I wanted Ruth's I want you to think about this it's six words God requires Jordan in every life God requires Jordan in every life every life every life have to come to its end called waiting for you to come to the end of your own self all your efforts and all your skillset have to

said God he from one man Elijah God has a manically huh no he could only find one man then but now it's more than one man now he has many men that he can lay his hands on because we are coming down to the gathering time or a harvest time so the one man show is over just want to announce that in case people didn't know the one-man show is over because it's harvest time and gathering tank God has many men that he can lay his hands on all glory to God happy to be here this morning or we can have a special time in the Lord okay from Feast of the trumpets notice revelation 10 1 2 7 all the

cash quince no signal in church does not kill the balloon kill a bull does me in church yesterday altar meet him so you expect to come to church drive and worship and then go home and get courted rapture I'm going to meet him in the air is that how you expect to go because sealless I didn't think that was part of my plan and understanding you know but a man said after a bag will be a hunted persecuted group and after a short Display of power she'll be taken off the earth who hunt in you who looking for you and I'm sure custom I criticize you forget that shut up holy peace you're uglier this is too tall you're too short to do this let me see what they want is the par with them its power with God [Applause] powered God open doors that was formally closed did you get that that goal was

got power and that's my brother madam said the world will bow at the feet of men and women who cross Jordan not just cross Jordan but cross Jordan go beyond Jordan and coming back because when he lies I came back the school that the Prophet said the spirit of Elijah but rest upon Elijah then oh he was coming back in power come on shame and somebody you may be seated but ask me he went across a son and he came back a manifested son did you understand that just across over yonder halves power the change and transform you from being a son into a manifested son where is a lot thought of Elijah and

same works he cast out Devils we cast them out also heal the sick [Music] how many gotta say amen to that some people are still not saying it you maybe season you see when you look at yourself you don't want to say Amen because you're telling yourself you're not ready for that but God don't deal with where you are acting God deal with where you will be so Jesus could see what Peter was going through and said the devil wants if you're like wheat I see what the develop to but I pray not to get you out of your stuff but in the smiths of your stuff I pray that your feet don't feel because if your feet only feel all fall down because we live my feet we walk by faith your Christian life is my feet if they get delivered you're keeping deliverance by fit yes I keep a healing by fate if you let yourself drop the disease come back the product in your bind you comes back its next day to keep off the devil they can say to keep your healing deliverance I'm still walking and slackness it this time come on reach back to me somebody you need a hostage it is the currency of God that God respects all that I am all that I ever will be is based upon faith in this world that's God's currency so somebody could be a Christian there for 30 40 years and have no faith and somebody walk in a building may be a sinner maybe a whatever it is and they have faith and they receive and Warhawk jesus never asks the blind man how long a blind how long you believe in me no may be seated Jesus the blind man recognized no traffic on this street they say they say why you say what was happening what is

here you know what kaesong 10-4 yes you say hallelujah you better know are you saying hallelujah that's the universal word of praise I wanna shout hallelujah right now that sounds good that song like the walls of Jericho coming down Lauria glorious feel the vision is being transferred I feel at the television it's not your mother is that your father is not your daughter your foo your father is and you're missing your mother for a long time and you have this complex and that complete forget all in complexes shut up all the peace this timely shutting up complexes we shuttin up depression until

to get beyond Jordan [Applause] all them Devils troubling you slapping you packing up in a corner that's because they're gonna be unsure on yet when you come past Jordan with them damage them Devils take it off power coming back I said that power place caught the devil the devil no power never go unrecognized Paul I know these I know well I know Chloe that caught or give the Lord a shout in the halls maybe season the Bible call it power from on high you know doctors for past a point a man's Ronnie man Walker a poor boy poor he's a deacon support he's look at the lot of people in church looking to harass people by their hogs and do this all these ice power because I'm and put that man in power that's not power with God send that police amigo la that's a wolf not me somebody else Pau with God I want you to focus on man Machias by try no no I don't wanna study trials this morning my situation don't study that study what the power God will do for you in your situation notice notice Moses in his intellectual condition kill a man and run that is having an understanding of his calling intellectually with no power he just had a power to fight Amanda if I time and on kill a man and I recognize where listen this trouble you know run so he had read in power without power notice when he got in contact with the pillar of fire he was alone wife not with him children not with him deep not with him alone this power thing is the loop thing [Music] and a lot of people caught up the cause they want the group support they want group v saved when Moses met eternal fire and God finish with him I like that he was ready to face anything you write the face what he ran from question what are you running from Moses couldn't run from his past Aquila man not only record book he couldn't say let me be struck off by a news history but that had changing what God think about Moses that doesn't change what God purposes has a Moses life and whatever you have done that does not change God's about your life the past I can't stop it the elder can stop it he can't ah stop it your past I'll stop it your sins can't even stop it because God said my world shall not return unto me void so once he sentences without it's good as done thy word is separate forever in the heavens God set up word concerning you the devil is finished this morning you gonna get a breakthrough I feel it gonna be now right now the service the devilish finish this morning are gonna come into your life I believe it that's why I'm preaching it he has to get it [Applause] oh let's go further I can't believe this after believe it who we were speaking about all the mysteries not to reveal to the Brian when he went down the road he said know how anybody got a revised version of the Bible is that the eagle the messenger of the loudest and church age Russian 10 1 2 7 he said he come down he put one foot upon the land one foot upon the sea and then time shall be no more when it did seven thunders uttered a voices I when the seven thunders of the divorce is John said I water right is it on righted he sealed it is the power I wanna get to someone say well that seven seas then but I Branham talked about Sam thunders that seven seas speaking about what you see talk about there seven others will reave in the last days are you ready some great mystery how we get closer to God that's a question here the answer no sir it can't be it's whosoever shall take one from the Bible or other one water it is possibly take not from the book of life what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there it's already wrote but it's to reveal what has already been written that is what the Tundra's is about now the reason I presented that to you is to identify that the revelation of the seven thunders is not the key how to get closer to God in that sense so in ours the thunders doesn't make you bypass Jordan [Music] he had a question again dem seven seals will be reveal some great mystery hall we get closer to God he said no it's a reveal was it what's written that's what that is about but God has revealed how to get closer to him by faith by virtue by knowledge by temperance by patience by Jordan so none of what the seven thunders can make you bypass dead people believe sins haven't under 700 fada what that what that means no Jordan that means not there no dying out no crucifixion when God took a prophet and God took away his wife God took away his shyer God took away the anointed caught up a black sheet over him and he was that Elijah if God could take a son to true all of that and when but Iran was preaching adoption he was say he was just testing me going through it it doesn't look like tests but he was just testing me because they Elijah got about 10 years to fit into the mantle God not cut any mantle to fit you God cut in you to fit the mantle the mantle have the size cut shape already if you have to get cut it took Elijah some time to grow to meet the mantle that is why that particular time ago said praise God stay here stay here stay here to see what's in that man to see if he will cope a stay here stay here stay here I am not staying until I meet up to what God purpose and predestination for my life I am not staying anywhere [Applause] notice there was no friends around him there was no family with him there was no brother sister mother husband oh no that's Elijah alone and that is horror must come to him you gotta be caught alone like Jacob Jacobs and his family here his wife here this one here that one year is property here all his things yeah and he was caught alone God wanted that and some of you is still not alone her cellphone ringing and he texted Texan I mean what's up message keep coming so you're not alone yet you're busy engaged as he as we living in people fully engaged and God want to catch you and Samantha do that quarter to bring some problems some big ones the make sure we can even really wonderful ring Coco on Twitter to pray and everything are they so busy a kinda to break this one calling this one Texan or the joy of not havin a smartphone near you at times as I said at the city whole thing whoa the ARIMA followers outside and you're gonna sit down god I said I see an eye hearing if you don't make time that won't come you have to say this is time time off lop it off shut it off it is a half an hour hour you got to do it to make time to connect with your God we need that connection we need that empowerment you see this B's system making magic if the people from long ago come now and they see what's happening you know what I will say which graph you put a car in a machine and Monica move that's witchcraft you take some military air and put it on talking to somebody as miles away which graph that will be a mystery for somebody 200 years ago come back and see you talking on the phone what's that do you smoke signals long time one smoke mean yes maybe to smoke me no I don't know maybe three smoke means how are you it had no faxes had no phone so what they will see know is like we're doing magic well that is what the B system is supposed to do profuse miracles powers relying on science and technology there is no need for God [Applause] long time you need translation power to move five this senses like Philip no you can take a taxi or maxi or Evelyn long time was different it was power that was the test needed it was power that was calling for not man power woman hi not man of the hour coming to bring some revelation we are 40 plus years of that it's the power of God and Paul Paul said this way when I come among you I come here with weakness and fear and trembling that your faith may not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so he didn't want them to get get caught up in his intellectual capacity to Brazil mysteries and word he wanted him to be get caught up in the God that was behind the intellectual stuff that he was presenting that when he walk away they will have faith in the God that he presented by the word because the power wasn't God understand is all these think of me preach without power all the mysteries could be preached without inspiration it could be spotty and just plain intellect humans speaking but when God began to move the Bible talk about men of all moves by the Holy Ghost that's different [Applause] I would hate to think that I'm doing this not inspired just intellectual just studying a man reading understand what the presets do college etiologies do breaking on Greek and walking all kind of mystery something inside of it and they will come and lecture and so on you ever went to a Catholic sermon and a funeral very polished and then they have this sacrament that Nadezhda sacrament and is smoking up on the smoking up when the fear is there it looks so classy but I just been intellect God not in that coordinate inspiring that but we have to see God coming to inspire the word to us that's why you need to be in the spirit that the Spirit could reveal himself to you and bring revelation to you when you leave there your leader will prevail in power it doesn't change the situation at home it doesn't change whatever it is but it changes you because you had the object of God to change the devil trying to get your side shows that's why I hate blaming I like when people own up notice what the angel asked Jacob what's-her-name who are you Jacob Salma I'm a businessman very well do you want that you know I deserve a break no he didn't say that he was a schemer I don't think people understand yeah but Jacob and Jacob and Jacob but you do know how much people do the scheming mother father brother he's keep everybody if if you're ready understand Jacob you didn't want to talk with a man because you'll be watching the pocket you'll be watching it kill you you capture him because he will rip you off which eyes open nice Jacob and God said check out my love we're not going on Esau he hit we're not going there we just stickin with the reading Jacob I love what did God see in Jacob he had a desire for the boot right so do you understand you cannot bypass the life of Jesus Christ by mysteries by knowledge by information by teachings you still have to get to the life because the Prophet said that's the Thunder that shakes the devil not not the coach no no the light that's the Tunde because he Satan get in contact with power already you know and it sends him when Jesus gave his fault he can I forget that you ever get pushing hand in a socket and a shock there's some people no don't like to touch anything electrical because it was shock before that's what Satan got from Jesus he was shocked with a fault from it is written he caught that and he canceled it again that's why he'll be so mad at those who remain because the bride will give him a shock he don't understand who you are he don't even believe who you are how could you believe it Jacob you trickster you how could you believe a few have already changed [Music] you are a history that he knows but you have a history that God knows which history is right your history is already in God [Applause] Oh glory hallelujah don't let the devil open his history book boo back in God's book that's why the angel came by the open book to reveal who you really are not your flesh history your genetic God history when you come from God he went back to God listen with the power of God you would slap up those trials you would crush the things that on he would walk on water you would walk on your situation you will stop feeling weak weak weak and say I am strong strong strong we stopped that Oh hallelujah okay let's one forward we're going slow but sure I'm not hurry I'm fine I'm fine four miles of the land are you ready so many say

they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down you see she has made herself ready I like that you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us all the other end and let's say blessing is here overcoming you are nothing to overcome he just push you true but you have got to make decisions yourself I have to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respect to God I love decisions because decisions put you where you could be or where you should be or where you want to be by your decisions you could choose your friends choose to let go this don't go here don't do this that's your choice and you could stand by your choice because we find out people do what they want to do you see on a Friday people like to go online I'm

P is your day Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh let's take Alfred ah Martin Luther saw it he come out the Catalan ISM what did they do they built a little fence we are Lutheran's this is it the better fence then West become what they say the Bella fence this is it and the light move on then because I was what what they do Wesley on all and build fences he said we cannot do that we cannot do that we have got to follow there we go are you ready we got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we have got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we get on an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy remember organization is mark of the beast and that's what I tell you people talking on behalf of the church they have a church life they don't have a real Christian life because the Christian life you take up your cross dearly not Sun daily I know that's not a word not monthly but daily not Sunday that the cross on my time ago long stairs the cross off your back no you'll follow him daily analyze that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy a man as a Christian on Sunday then goes to church and set back I think he owns the church because he does this that the other I'm under a stealing lying woman I report on the public beaches I'm upon the streets and moral clothes on they take the spirit of the world that don't belong

deliver the brain out of the spirit of man number six because the bride has to get the word from a husband oh jesus here we go love this a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving that's not a Christian a Christian is to be christ-like and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ come into the man the life of Christ in him then it produces the life of Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about a personal relationship to Christ you come to church but do your relationship with Jesus Christ because that makes the whole difference it changed the whole perspective that you are not alone you are connected to God Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord please so there's only one way to get into the church that is by both Christians you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a son of God you must become relations to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only as sons and daughters are saved not the members of the church but sons and daughters there's only one thing that can produce that and that's the new birth and if you are born again your entire nita is changed and God himself what you become a prisoner to him now you become a love prisoner other men can smoke the work and laugh make fun but you are prisoner to Christ other men can smoke and drink and carry on if they want to Collins have Christians deacons in preachers but not you your prisoner your prisoner to notice God making himself known we are not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government dying by hunting books and tapes and we bringing people to the Lord and what not watch he said no watch but by the revelation that Christ is in you and God was in Christ and God was in Christ and Christ is in you and what God in Christ Christ does in you so we're not even supposed to make converts by government we supposed to make convert by revelation isn't that right not by legalism look what you're here don't do this don't do this we had that for 40 plus years what has it brought about churches but where is the power of God manifested or praise the name of the Lord we believe that what is it is being filled with the spirit him having the preeminence 'yes that's what cords achievement that's God's purpose to do that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together the Holy Spirit the same thing revealed it to Christ revealed here the supernatural creative power now listen close nor the church nor the sign nor the fellowship nor the government nor the testimony nor decreed no denomination is accepted outside of this God except nothing else but Christ in you may God help us here this morning to see the burden of the world that what God really trying to get his Christ in you the hope of glory you see God is not in this bishop fruiting a bishop over his people God in the purifier coming inside of you hallelujah remember the pillar fire before God identify God above us then God with us in Christ then his purpose was because in us the object was caught to come in his people not man ruling over man but court ruling in man you've been a powered son so God come and put a power generator inside of you and you begin to light up others others from your mouth others be empowered and then the whole kingdom being revolutionized by sons of God because that's what God was originally let us make man and multiply and replenish is not right how Dominion and multiply is not right upon the earth so Adam was to reproduce other sons so we have a kingdom of sons but then the devil injected himself and that's where we get the battle that we have this morning Oh glory to God so Balaram says and God accept nothing about Christ a new group of glory the only thing that God recognizes no fellowship no church no creed no denomination it is dead it is fragment

out in his presence too after Jacob rest all night and confessing his sins he called a place penny on penny tell the whooping yell and the Hebrew means the feast of Almighty God Jacob had his name was Jacob which means a planter that's a deceiver I run all of his life are we from God you hear that he run all his life are we from God now if that was a Jacob in our own that we know we say oh he you know the seed he ain't comin in here on a running watch but he got a hold upon God I won't even lose God we need more Jacobs he held on to the face of God in the presence of God he steal until it was son of God said let me go the son is arising he steered in the face of God he went away justified and saved what a great thing it was to know he and Russell true that he had seed signs of God he are not dreams about God but this was one time he was in the face of God in the presence of God think of it friends as we hurry up in the presence of God - change Jacob was change no he could walk with God he was a different man that when he went up there the battle was now over yes sir he began to build altar he hadn't been used to building altars you know I tell you when you come in the presence of God you want bill an order somewhere you want to find somewhere you can pray now Jacob was changed from Jacob to Israel a prince having power with God that is what happened to Jacob the deceiver are you ready the unrighteous the unholy the deceiver he deceived his brother stole the birthright from his brother and a little dirty way of doing it such a deceiver he deceive his father-in-law put popular sticks and mixed pack of cards when the calls be impregnated come here and look at it he deceive his mother he deceive his daddy he deceive his brother he was running everywhere he went always on a run from God he was on the run from his brother but when he come into the presence of God he recognized he was a sinner what did he do what did he do he's seen his opportunity he had met something he didn't even think about before and he stayed there until all sins was gone God manages a way to get men in their presence and they made the decisions some of them run from him some run to him and if their predestination life they believe it they hang on to it the guy that confessed his sins shall have pardon if you hide your sins you not prosper so Jacob you know the next day he met his brother Esau he didn't need no help from him then he didn't need our means he was in the business of building altars he wasn't afraid of Esau no more Oh hallelujah that contact with the angel that Rossler with God he didn't need no support no human support I need this one I need that one I need that I need that no you need God and God will bring on unfold all what you have need of David said I have set the Lord before me sounds sixteen eight that's a good thing to do I've set the Lord before me he wanted to be conscious of his presence so David said I have set the Lord always before my face watch that's a good lesson for us tonight set the Lord before face be conscious of his presence put him first but first before you why then you want sin when you realize that you are constantly in the presence of God when you realize God is are wrong you'll watch what you see a man many think God is gone Hira cuss he would lust after woman he will steal he will cheat he would lie he will do anything when he think that God don't see him but bring him in the presence of God he will stop it right now and David said I have put the law all before me that's a good thing no wonder no wonder God said he was a man after his own heart man will do anything when God is near but when you realized that God near and so forth Oh hallelujah so he said Jacob he watched all Jacob held on to all night he

take faith to keep that deliverance that breakthrough that keep whatever God bless you it to keep that if I take fate the car go back and do the same thing and it's not legalism really is if you break the laws of body gets in trouble God want to keep your bless so you don't want to go here you don't want to do this you don't want to do that in order for you to be blessed it's not God trying to regulate you in that sense what trying to say listen I have certain laws if they keep within those laws your best feelings flow freely the precursors lost you get in trouble Oh blessed be the name of the Lord let me see if I can wrap up here praise God is so much oh my so David when dear that's the matter today gorg another sheep that gone astray the organization and things are stole em out and

word and the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we can sleep every giant on the field that's all we need today the word and the Holy Ghost and every giant and the field gonna be challenged I'm insane so today we know we need a revival we know we need a stir in amongst the people it will not take a doctor of divinity it will take a week hallelujah that will take the Word of God in the poor the resurrection of Christ and slitted sting if they're being Christ to the country it will let them see he can still opened up eyes of the blind heal the sick raise the dead he God as a conqueror we need a David untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that just a poor boy some little guy which took shoulders not much to look at come walking on the road with the power of God hallelujah how many ministers could God use this morning if they'd only let God bind them with his word how would his power lose them from the strength of the denomination and organization how many sincere people in the city this morning that goes to great organization churches how many could be filled with the Holy Ghost and set the country afire with the gospel and the power if they'd only taken lose themselves from the power to have them bound by his spirit to be like Paul was a love sister God got to Paul I mean a sliver to him bond him to himself send him to the Gentiles which he hated you hear God take his power bind Paul his power and sent him to the Gentile which he hated but you see here we go he had to be loosed from his ecclesiastical power to be bound to the power of God do you understand that these churches all they bought in the message and all the message have a power but rank was an ecclesiastical power that binds the people but a power is coming to unbind them oh my way he had to lose his strength and become weak and nothing in order to receive the strength of God to be bombed to God to do what God would tell him to do he ever something to console us he has something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people developing a motive if we ever get to heaven if you ever stand on the presence of God in His Church we will stand in a bunch of people I mean weak rejected cast out of the world and no nothing a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite the land can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but a sheep stand helpless that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient then God can take that person begins to mold himself into that person make his highness do what God would have hands to do make his lips speak what God lips would speak because they are not his they're gods he began to build a character and begin to take his weakness and to make his own self go outside as weak and humble that's what opportunity that's what we have gettin to us is when we are weak said it again preacher that's God's opportunity that is God's way of gettin to us when we are weak see elegant preacher that's cause opportunity that's course we have gets into us when we week we get something then the problem is we are too strong so Court have to do something to break you come on and weaken you that he could get to you Oh glory to God praise God this encourages of course cause God whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people then when you get that kind of way your image Kingdom the case is roughly not too weak we are too strong we are too strong headed we are too strong in our head we know too much that's the problem this message just know too much we have to heal ourselves oh my oh my you say Lord I've been school for 40 years I'm an intellectual student I could cook my the Bible with my eyes closed God can't use that you said I belong to the biggest Church in the country I am this I own Pentecostal I receive all goes another night I know you want to make me strong so whenever you know what God can't use that are you with me I'm not done yet so keep riding with me now whenever you get licked and realize you're licked and then come on back and humble yourself and get weak and find out your human or glory hallelujah you have to know your get lit you have to know your lit and find out your human get weak and there are none of the intellectuals can do that human weaknesses will never be used of God God here we go by human weaknesses pours himself into you then he uses himself and you become an instrument so young weakness can call an opportunity to pour himself inside of you [Applause] your weakness being a crack or a space or opening on opportunity for something that you kind of do say for my room white blood issue the Bible said how money ran out is there money ran out what should any money going to the doctor long as they come again next month
