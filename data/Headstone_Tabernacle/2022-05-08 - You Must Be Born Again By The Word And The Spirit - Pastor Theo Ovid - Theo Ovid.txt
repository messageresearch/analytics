that you're moving up in a special way today and to take me out of the way and speak to people's hearts and lives and may lives be changed because that is what we're here for that our lives be affected infected by your word by your spirit by your power won't you come among us in a special way we confess we are needy people and we wait upon you in jesus name so god bless you if your bibles i'd like you to turn to sin john chapter one we want to read from verse 30 11 to 13. we want to read in john chapter 3 we want one to eat and we want to read acts 1 verse 8. certainly appreciate the permitting and the exhortation on friday it was a tremendous blessing to you amen so reading from sin john 1 we want to read from verse 11. he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god this is clear that this boot that he's talking about as many as receive him to them give you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe in his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god so in john chapter 3 i want to read from verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews he came that came to jesus by night said unto him rabbi we know now what a teacher come from god for no man could do these miracles that now does except god be with him so nicodemus identified the miracles as the confirmation that this man is the teacher from god jesus answered himself to him very very less unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not what i see unto thee you must be born again the wind blew it wait listed and thou hearst song thereof and can't not tell when's it cometh and whether it goes so is every man one that is born of the spirit last scripture acts 1 8 but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea in samaria on the uttermost part of the let's pray once more father we thank you for your word and these are scriptures laying here and take the holy spirit and make it alive make it real we invite you to come and breed upon the word lord and may the people's mind be taken up lord out of their own issues out of their own challenges i mean they hear the word as thus saith the lord this morning granted father and jesus may ask it amen our name and you may be seated and give the lord a shout and praise as you said donghan amen it's good to be here this morning it's good to be in the house of god i'm glad to see all of you out praise and even god are you ready for the word this morning praise god that's all we have to give just a word man shall live by bread alone and by philosophies and men's ideas but man shall live by the word that comes out of the mouth of god and the mouth of god are his prophets so regardless of what song nice and what song philosopher and what song good is the word alone of life because the word itself is spirit given or spirit spoken now man in his philosophical thinking whether it's confucius or buddha or whoever it is have nice talks and you know nice quotations and stuff that's from the human spirit that's some humanist realm because man was supposed to be a god man was supposed to be a certain realm so a man can still tap into certain things and certain principles but the word is god now the scripture we read this morning before that it says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the devil has tried to make it as if this would have no effect but men does twist the word that it doesn't have effect but the word itself is powerful it is sharper than the two-edged sword the world could come down and dissing you and design your knees and design your condition and minister to you this morning praise god i have a title you must be born again by the word and the spirit o praise the name of the lord you must be born again by the word and by the spirit now let's go our foundation is the bible we believe the bible they begin follow the word of the living god let a christian know find this with this scripture and that we have no problem with no scripture every scripture is called breathe every scripture is inspired of god this bible have all the answers we want all the answers we need praise god this bible have all the answers to what is the condition today praise god hallelujah praise god amen do you believe that our foundation is the bible we believe the bible to be in fatherhood of god of the living god we believe that everything that must that's done must come from the bible all teaching must be based on the bible now when the old testament had a way of knowing whether a prophet or a dreamer spoke the truth the other yeriman tamim many of you ministers you sunday school teachers know of it when a dreamer dream a dream or a prophet prophesy they had to take them to the temple and there was a breastplate that went over aaron's breasts and there was some birthstone of each head of the tribe of the 12th of israel and when this prophet was prophesying no matter how real his prophecy seemed to be if there wasn't a light that flashed over that a supernatural light while the prophet was prophesying they turned it down as wrong because it was god recognizing the prophet's prophecy so you said bring them into the temple you have a dream you have a prophecy come and say it in front of the breastplate of eren and you talk a dream and talk a dream if nothing happen they say forget about it keep on walking oh praise the name of the lord but when you speak that dream or speak that vision or speak that prophecy and a light start to glow around there they know that it's god because god himself is witnessing that this prophecy of vision comes from me oh glory to god hallelujah so god has sent his witness back the supernatural because god himself is supernatural oh glory to god so what you're looking for this morning is the supernatural witness to you praise god as a human being you can listen to another human being but we're not talking about human to human we're talking about what is born not of blood not of the will of man not for the will of the flesh but of god you must be born again or give the lord a shout born by the word and born by the spirit we have had the word for so many years but the spirit has to come upon that word that god put in you what give the lord i shout that word not outside of you when you come to church and come to fill up your gas tank word on top a word on top of word on top of word but he said you shall receive power after the holy ghost it'd have to come upon you we'll give the lord a shout after you're here and you're here and you're here and you're here and you're here and you're here it has to come upon you something have to come upon you i feel like to say it this morning something have to come upon you it has to actually come up on you the preacher hallelujah oh glory to god [Applause] has to come glory glory this was a leader of the jews nicodemus he was a head honcho asking jesus can i oh man old man get back his mother my second time i hear i don't want his bone again thing let's continue did you notice it was done by the supernatural always god is supernatural where god is supernatural things taking place i know people like to say the word openly supernatural and saying yeah that's fine prophet open word you're the only supernatural opening words like supernatural that's more like impersonation are you saying things the prophecy that's not the actual experience hallelujah all the old testament was prophecy scriptures kissing the scrolls this is some joke for god god said so it's laying there dormant whatever came unto this one whatever came into this one and this happened and this happened that the scriptures might be fulfilled go out there guessing where to push them knobs you know every number is a direct hit it looks like he going so but he's going so too you know you need pushing so to get so you know i don't think you're going wrong so you know you're going to go so oh glory to god how much time god demonstrate that in your own life when you think you're going this way he cut you off this here to get you into position here it's called one to bless you god want to prosper you god wants to pour his oil upon you god wants your cop to run over could i shout in the house if they never hear it you're hearing this morning he wants your cup to run over [Applause] hurry the gun [Music] you know some people don't believe that you know that going when they come to run over you take god wants you to be suffering and and short and whatnot david said my cup running over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me david wasn't guessing about it you know why the full statement answered everything the lord is my shepherd oh glory to god what the shepherders do what shepherds take care of his sheep i shall not want he leaded me the path of righteousness for his name's sake oh glory to god though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil the lord is with me and i run and staff that comfort me don't be paris a table for me in the presence of my enemies my cup oh glory the god oh hallelujah praise god we're going to believe god this morning god is supernatural god is omnipotent god could change all things around you what could change your situation in your home in your life on your job you'll meet your family all them devils they have parading on top the roof of your house they could leave while you're leaving here all inside your house are wrong your house all them demon assign to interfere and disrupt and interrupt your life god could break god could bring your enemy to get in harmony with you or give the lord a shout in the house be serve a living god the battle is not yours the battle is the lord's when the enemy coming like a flirt the spirit of god is a standard and that spirit is here this morning god bless standing among his people nothing is by chance all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are they called you are not here by chance this service is not by chance you are going to be born again of the word and of the spirit oh give the lord a shout when peter was speaking the word while period spoke the word the holy ghost fell upon them and they were filled with the holy ghost you are going to be filled with the holy ghost don't just look at me i'm not yet elected you i'm here to preach the gospel or give the lord a shout in the house he said go and preach the gospel oh and that gospel is nothing word only oh hallelujah thank you jesus my god let me be seated hallelujah oh glory welcome to paint your mind and paint your head i'm painting with philosophy i'm painting with vein talks i don't care to talk about putin i ain't talking about ukraine oh that i always cause i'm here to talk about that this is some promises he's had here to do what he had to do and he will find out why putin is as he is it because he rejected the holy ghost and god gives him over to a communist spirit that is why russia is where it is and they have satan one and satan two and all the missiles and bomb that they have is because they rejected what we preaching this morning they rejected the holy ghost you challenge your power after the holy ghost come upon you but there's a bunch of gentiles going to receive this holy ghost going to receive this seal going to receive this baptism oh give the lord some praises this morning may god set your soul of fire may god set your soul a hunger and this world is not the only world this world is not your home we just a passing through we are pilgrims we are strangers [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me be seated did you notice it was always done by the supernatural god is supernatural where god is supernatural things take place and if god has always been supernatural he always will be supernatural therefore but the supernatural must be vindicated by god because there's all kind of mysticism there's all kind of different theories and sensations everything in the world today by the midst of it all there still remains are true and living god here we go if israel 2000 years ago would accept the invitation that they were given they wouldn't be where they are today two thousand years ago israel turned on the invitation to come to the wedding supper they turned it down and went into judgment but jesus said this stone killed the prophets that was sent to them by making excuses the excuses they made in each day now when jesus he didn't affiliate with any of them when did this man get his learning what school did he was from is not the carpenter's son isn't his mother called mary his brother joseph and james and so forth isn't his sisters with us then where did this man get this authority to do this thing in other words he didn't affiliate with them so they said he's baseball he's a samaritan he's got a devil he's mad he's a man that's got an evil spirit on the line of religion that drove him crazy he's out there like a wild man don't pay any attention to him we know what happened to israel they screamed out and he says let his blood be upon us and upon our children you see our words are powerful that's what they cry out let his blood be upon us and our children and they blight themselves for generation and god scattered them throughout all the world with the prophecy that in the last days he's going to bring them back [Music] so that is why the palestinians and them was there for hundreds of years and when israel started to come back 1946 and the 40s they'd come like like if they have a deed for the land and they say we're coming back for home that's why they've packed us up you know because it's abraham's sons through ishmael and isaac it can't stop now this battle started way back in genesis you can't expect it to stop now and god cut off israel to connect with us so now we're going to cut off the gentiles to connect back with israel or give the lord a shout right now we have one million jews in ukraine one million jews in ukraine bet your bottom dollars have some tribe inside idea i had to head back to israel is 144 thousand of the elected gonna be sealed according to revelation 7 oh glory to god and every day so many are sealed oh glory to god and we want the gentiles we want you in this church to be sealed it doesn't matter what you have or what you don't have or will worship the beast oh you're worshiping rich you're worshipping bond you're worshiping free you're worshiping accept those whose names written and if your name is written you're going to hear your name by the word i couldn't call myself i was a catholic i didn't know nothing about god nothing about this word but this message for me and it's the best thing god could have set my way now i know i'm not a baptist i'm not a methodist i'm not a catholic i'm a son of god he came unto his own his own rejected him the jews rejected him and then they turned to the gentiles and we received him and as many as receive him who is that the person of christ the person of the word faith virtue knowledge temperance patience goggins brotherly kindness charity that's christ receive him to them only to them only to them who is them those who receive him let them give you power to become that means you're not born into this thing you're hallelujah and then jump into this thing your first bit doesn't give you this thing god give your power to start power to grow and while you are shouting that power to claim power to add did you hear that power to grow power to claim power to add power to move up you need power you could sit there dull and dead if you want but you need power and power comes from god power comes from the holy ghost that's how your great power with the holy ghost and the holy ghost is not a very thing it has to come upon you [Applause] i'm gonna be seated let me see if i could switch it a bit the devils that are vacting you looking to compound people you looking to possess the people who you think why didn't you have them call her clothes and economically or something right now is that devil inspired people you know who eating influence in putin who thinks influence and biden who the influence in the government you heard a messenger on sunday we talking with somebody in the folly some spirit drop on somebody to give them a call to confirm the error and confirm the folly and the thinking is god some liar calling them their spirit sinner they see you in trouble you see again depressed and some spirits tell somebody is called i'm calling now are you thinking there are confirmations by a confession of what god pulled nobody fully he's always said get out come out your country come on i watch you and go to everything stay here stay there god they don't ever talk that kind of talk you say i will bless you i'll bring you out i'll make a way for you all the work we walk in is by faith you know what you have you know what you have been in and you don't know what you're going into and god's saying step out break out i want your comfort zone what you have watch your normal normal living step out you never raise your hands before you're raising your hands you never say amen before you're saying amen you never sat up in church before you stand up why are you breaking out you have body with nobody have nothing to do with anybody you're feeling good about you nobody in carnival is saying i'm watching mo pencil saying longer dipping the chances cricket they're carrying on and football gold they're carrying on and cheer people saying like i have a quote you know he said we are welcoming the conqueror you know not some dead god we are worshiping the mighty conqueror we want to conquer that hell on the grave you can be dead is he coming look he's conquering which conqueror is that [Applause] [Applause] oh glory to god your comforter he is coming oh glory to god give the lord some praises my god you talk about worship worship that the devil couldn't get worship for the king lamb they're gonna be a genuine king lamb worship elders worship him the four beasts worship him the twenty-four elders worship him and then thousand times thousands they worship the lamb that was worthy to take the book and to loose the seven seas thereof oh we are somehow thank god for thank you for your salvation thank you for delivering you thank you for healing you thank you for restoring you thank you for reviving you thank you for putting a taste and a hunger in your soul oh bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me [Applause] [Music] they killed the prophets or you either got to say in this this is god's will and god desire either something else that and you can crop up but now you take you say watch the bible said the word of god is no private interpretation no one else is supposed to put an interpretation to it it's written just the way god wants it interpreted and that's the way it is that's supposed to be just take it the way it wrote now watch if russia had accepted the pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the holy ghost fell in russia do you know the holy ghost fell in russia let me say again the holy ghost fell in russia you know they wouldn't have been communists today 75 years ago they had a great revival in russia god come among them and they had a great revival way up into siberia and siberia is a place we'll be 70 degrees below zero what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone the churches can't have church only under permission they are doomed into judgment has gone off on a wild turn jump of communism and solo to the devil fifty years ago the holy ghost fell in england fell the message don't talk about that now there's only words and mysteries i'm talking about the holy ghost fell i know mystery for long enough because you said my words are spirit and my words are life so the word is also spirit spirit is also word so you can get word spirit in word form but word is also spirit so when he said the holy ghost fell in russia what is he talking about when he said the holy ghost fell in england what is he talking about while the holy ghost has to fall in trinidad what is he talking about kept the lord i shouted in the host when we said the holy ghost going to fall and treated that what are we talking about that has nothing to do with no man nothing to do with no minister no a person not prophet no evangelist no teacher no pastor that has to be the holy ghost itself [Applause] [Music] 50 years ago the holy ghost fell in england just after africa and that after that come george jeffrey's ff buzzword charles price smith wiggles wood those great wires of the faith 50 years ago and offered england the holy ghost revival what did they do they laugh at them put them in jail call them crazy thought they had lost their minds the churches refused the people to come hear them and they healed the sick the castle devils done great works and because england as a nation rejected the gospel her sins is known throughout all the world there is hardly a more apostate nation in all the world including roman france than england she's the mother of apostasy that english spirit mother of apostasy right where finney and many of the great men preached and he market and charles finney and wesley all done she turned it on america 15 years ago when the great healing revival country owned from pentecost broke out in the nation the revival in the capital washington dc the president by president great people governors greeting takes in place and we're here like congressman upshaw have been crippled for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them and they turn it down and tonight that's the reason this nation is doomed there is no hope for it at all she has crossed the line between judgment and mercy i became a spirit meeting they have got to hear in the prayer because the prophet spoke that they crossed the line between judgment and mercy that's why america going down they can't help it you know they're not downward slide them sliding down into hell oh glory to god but it's a bride to be called out from around the world out of different peoples and tongues and nations nothing will not stop that bride god our entire message hope to gather the bride together that's what the thunders were sent to do to show the right how to be pure that's what the thumbnails were said to do to give the bride's head that was the thunders were sent to do they don't want a preacher tell us we will preach it we will keep it we will dress ourselves with it oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the bragg seventh yet he will send it he promised it if the people will forget what the thinking and the feeling and preach the promises this will become effective [Music] them people crazy and grandy yeah yeah yeah we crazy you see nothing yet we are about to get crazy wait till the holy ghost come upon us wait tell the white horse rider oh glory to god monk that bride where till the spirit come upon the brain and give the bride a voice even the voice of the archangel the spirit and the pride said come right till them seven thunders after their voices the dead group who could take the word and hand it dear it was slice and cut oh they're no game they're not playing with words guys that semantics that's not verbal gymnastics you wait tell them seven thunders oh glory to god be on that promised brethren yes we under promise we on the promise [Applause] hallelujah [Music] talk about america she's rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything i can think of and at that time when bahrain was our wrong speech and this it didn't have lb eg ump whoever they have it didn't have all them letters the moles of the nation is lower than anything i can think of and the religious system is rotten than the morals these religious right conservative hypocrites talking about abortion and what kind of thing like that and i know what kind of thing i didn't anything they might recognize your rights were not taken away they might recognize their own rights that's why they probably prophesy you know they were close that's done you know if you don't be long you know understand this the devil season power you know according to prophecy the bees have an image power was given to the image god have an image too that image has to be in you and power have to come to that image is the image of god in you versus the image of the beast both have to get power [Applause] [Music] and if the b system have to get power you mean the bride wouldn't get power you maybe just sit down and explain and talk and explain and talk you shall receive more talk after mortal come to you that's not what god said you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you time for the holy ghost to be poured out [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when the holy ghost poorer than russia they was called to the feast of pentecost spiritual feasts they turned it down england the holy ghost spotted upon them they turned it down america holy respond upon them detailing them he bit them three times he sent out they wouldn't listen he said go and compel those to come the table has got to be set the table is ready there is still more room and i believe whether his next few months or something or a year whatever it is god is going to send another shaking across the country because there is still somebody out there if all these years we covered books voice of god god tons of books in english friends spanish all kind of language and what that that is shaking nothing they're just books going out the shaking coming when the holy ghost began to move in power god can't read people can't reject what they haven't seen manifested he came unto his own his own receive him not jesus come just talking no he said his spirit is upon me for he had anointed me to preach this gospel every time they're hearing word word word from the pharisees he come and said the spirit is now upon me hallelujah to pray in other words to fulfill what only reading all these years this prayer is upon me today to fulfill what you're reading then he said this day this scripture i don't have to wait i tell you in advance this day what you hear reading here is fulfilling your ears then they push him out and he becomes the rejected stone and then he's going to cast our devils he's got to heal the sick he's got to raise the dead and the devil was mad because when jesus did that he was exposing satan's invisible kingdom did you hear that he was exposing the kingdom of the devil because the devil was hiding behind pharisees and scribes harambee and false teachers and false doctrines and all them along wrote people hiding behind humor and blindness and death so when jesus come about death here dumb speak crippled work then the people understood that spirit was there and just cast it out oh give the lord a shout he was making sure the world know we're in the realm of the spirit now this is not physical thing this is peter dealing with demon powers intellectual powers spirit business oh give the lord a shout you shall reject power oh glory may be seated whoo prophecy another shaken across the country marry all with new doctrine and revolution after all these years we have with something new fight man again you new here called god calling for the old thing the fate of the father the same old faith to the fathers another faith in the future you know faithfully fathers [Applause] [Music] the faith of the father the old faith they had with our old fear they raised the dead without old fear there were no devils that old thing demons following paul and paul waited on our timing to cast them out without old faith paul a snake him and snake was to kill him in a few minutes he just shake it off in the fire and that faith was he so snake proof pray there was drunk proof there was jail proof without faith that all fit the prison bars open up oh glory going back to that same old fate i wonder give me that old time sing at all times shouting old timeway [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right let's go the same holy ghost that fell under pentecost which we all know that was the bullet of the new church if that same holy spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you've got a different holy spirit than what that was well i'll receive it when i receive the word yeah the baptist are message baptists if the same holy spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you got a different holy spirit than what that was exactly if it don't make you live a sacrificial life and a life of full of joy and pleasure and the baptist spirit leading you into signing one of the miracles and things something happened jesus said these signs shall form you fall in and i believe samuel here we go i'd prove that he was a civilian of god he proved that the holy spirit was with him and he said i'll take you record to this day have i exposed anything to you in the name of the lord what will welcome the past you know why this was addressed right they saw they tell samuel this is israel telling samuel all the nations have a man in front of them leading them in the battle we want a man and samuel grieve he's oh god will you are you gonna ask for that you different from other nations god is a king you say but we have a man in front of you riding horse big bomberman thing that is women so simon i tell them have i said anything in the name of the lord but welcome the past how do i come and beg and bomb money from you all these things they said no you haven't done that but we want to have it the way we want it and then god told samuel they have not rejected you they rejected me hallelujah we find out here we go when a man rejects the leading of the holy spirit you know what god did for saul he gave him an evil spirit to lead him now how about that he give him an evil spirit god give him an evil spirit to lead him so when a man rejects the legion of the holy spirit or any person rejects the leading of the holy spirit you've got a devil on you to lead you and when he said lead he mean legionnaire follow me a devil to direct you if a man is led by the spirit of god god will make himself known to that person god promised so in doing that we know that the holy spirit leads the people and go take care of it i'd like to say another thing you've seen it again that evil spirit began to lead soul it led him and today when the holy spirit is rejected it wants what will it do you will get an evil spiritually you know listen i don't want to hurt you i want you to get this just as it was in them days so it is today they don't want the holy spirit to lead them so they get an evil spirit what takes place with an evil spirit the evil spirit wants to lead them and know what they don't want god to be their judge and people today don't want the holy spirit to judge them and that's the reason they turn samuel down because his judgment was of god it was scriptural they don't want to be led by the spirit and they turn it down for an ecclasical man what did they get an evil spirit to lead them if they don't want the holy spirit to judge them no excuses god won't listen to your excuses he didn't listen to saul he would listen to you you have got to compare with what the bible says i'll hear this bomb god knows what's truth what is best samuel tried to tell saul that god knows what is best but saul said well the people want me but when someone will come and say i hear blitzing in the back there i thought they were supposed to kill everything he said well you know what i mean i keep the best for the lord best for the people you know the people watch this as long as he could get somebody to follow him so that's what he wanted he used samuel's name and get somebody to follow him that's all he wanted and today they're used by the brahman name and get people to follow them but they're not preaching by the banner's message they're preaching their own revelation their own thoughts their own ideas their own inspiration and yet that prophecy say with the tipsy because that i say in it it's him that is saying it the words are spirit given words that's why we are resting on the prophetic utterance that was released by malachi 4. i could rest my soul on that well i could give you that and no i give you dust say of the lord oh glory to god let me read it again as long as he gets somebody to follow him that's all he wanted he used samuel's name and get somebody to follow him that's what he wanted they don't want to read it the real gospel they don't want the real truth they don't want the holy spirit to guide them they'd rather have an intellectual pastor with seminary experience of the uh on a theological experience seminary experience instead of the baptism of the holy ghost done in him to make him shock the height off oh my so let me wrap up this part here i will continue so when god sent the holy ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down so it means god has come knocking yes i want to fill you he said he want to fill you more than you want to receive the feeling hallelujah god when he sends the holy ghost and looks on a man's door and the liberty is down sometimes you're going to turn it on for this last time and you won't be a privileged character you can set in church listen to the gospel agree with the gospel you might do so much and say i know it's right but never put a finger on it to help yourself you listen to it i believe it's right just sympathizing with it this morning please don't sympathize with it get your get your fingers on it get a hold of it if you're not to sin and hungering ask god so created me start from there i'm hungering and artistic right now i'm not hungry i'm not but create it in me lord i'm leaving your hungering and twisting after righteousness hallelujah and if we ever expect this word to ever come to pass if we ever expect god to keep his word we have got to stay with it just the way god wrote it and that's the reason if you stay with it the way god wrote it there will be all kind of things happening among you every word will be fulfilled i'm on the expectation still reading just now myself i've seen a shaken power come that will shake the nations pretty soon people talk about shaking you know talk about russia shaking this one shaking the bombs coming in to shake on everything shape what were you charging again i told my bride a power he said i'm waiting a short quick message that would shake the whole nation what about that shaking you think god is going to stand and shake it when the brice are the rocks of the pentecostal welcome we shaken up oh glory to god hallelujah praise god do you think god will let him penetrate escape with all the money gospel and all the gimmicks and stuff god will have a bride they're going to manifest jesus christ [Applause] [Music] understand this when johnny baptist came there was no miracles you know he was giving them wood mountains going in low crooked places straight he said there's one among you whom i can't even on loose is the latch on shoes he shall baptize you with what the holy ghost and with fire he's a fire coming if you think i'm hot somebody hunted on me coming fire coming john prophesied fire coming holy ghost on fire fire to burn is i come with the accent to the root i come to make a way for fire i come to make a way for messiah i come to make a way for revival i come to make a way for dynamics oh give the lord a shout i only come with mechanics but dynamics coming oh give the lord a shout glory to god no signs no wonders no miracles just a blasting of the word a cutting of mountains hallelujah bring forth fruit meet the repentance john just blast blasted them oh glory to god challenging them and when jesus come he come with spirit now you see the spirit is upon me oh glory to god he was reading scripture but it was real oh glory to god oh hallelujah did you get that he found the place where it was written so he was harmony in harmony with the scripture in isaiah 61. in isaiah 61 the scripture declares the spirit is upon me so he was real himself he was reading his own scripture he was reading his word he was reading his fulfillment their thought was another text they taught with another sermon but he was actually saying this is happening right now watch when did the spirit come upon him after he got baptized in water when john baptized him spirit like a dove descended upon him and then the spirit led him not an evil spirit the spirit of god led him into the wilderness to manage lucifer because only three things lucifer could tackle it lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life every other thing is connected to those treatings it's just treating this type people up is either lost in the eyes that's the flesh and pride of life oh glory to god wednesday night service i was you heard on the message god come to promise to supply your need not your greed and your greed is generated by lust and lust can't be satisfied the people have money more money more money they can have enough hallelujah land land land landed they have enough land they can't even plan the land they can't keep the land but they want more land it's a loss that is there hallelujah god promised to apply your need not your greed oh glory so jesus that was to overcome lucifer in the wilderness by himself no deep nobody encouragement god knows he called me he was the example son you know where i'm open we're crying for you you're in your trial you're you're testing and he beat the devil in every test he was hungry and the devil they never knew what's going on sometime in the boy he knew he hungry you know he said if don't be if don't be the son of god you see them stone the timing of the bread the son of god supposed to have power devil not strip it son had god had nothing at all he asked jesus he said if don't be the son of god i know you had a power if you're a son of god you can't just be you're talking son you're just talking talking you're chatty you're fellowshipping son i sound like you talk plenty he said don't be the son of god i know sons have power turned these stones into breath and he could have done it i want you to get that he could have done it but he's a man shall not regret alone but by every word i proceed out of the mouth of god oh glory to god should he drop a bomb on the devil boom he dropped the word on him should never say aha he's going into the world now so he's had to sing don't give you the word now curry lust of the flesh hallelujah praise god and they know he's trying to push jesus onto the scriptures though shall keep thyself if you dash yourself against a stoner high mountain jump jump display yourself you want you know man like attention that way there are pinky already here blue here what kind of thing the attention they're looking for they find people are looking at everybody black here so all kind of crazy ties and sound is attention they're looking for he said jump and jesus gave him the word this is also written the final test is when they'd ever bring out this big screen hallelujah lcd screen man hallelujah and how much 4k or 8k whatever k they have bright lights he showed them new york he showed them america england all aboard the place he scanned the whole world you see all these kingdoms i'm mine to give whoever i want you don't have to go to calgary you don't have to pay the price you don't have to suffer just bow down and worship me and you will be a manager and i'll be your supervisor oh hallelujah do you say get behind me satan we got your boots up there we go get your boots down here oh give the lord a shout get behind me glory glory when jesus went into the wilderness spirit hit him when he when you don't even listen it's written it is written he's going through it is also written and when you come back out here spirit chop on him oh glory is fired up he is charged up he went to the temple the inviting people to read raise up his hands my time my turn all the time you keep going he ain't saying nothing oh glory to god he keep going he keep going to servicenow you are missing a service here missing a beat he ain't already preaching about him that falls that wrong and off key he know they're off the revelation off the beaten path watch them twitter in their beard and and fixing it they talked to all topey hat fixing the self when he ready found the place was written declare scripture and walk out the ball is not this joseph's son what did you say about this bride but i know this man he was backstage 15 years ago you're a count you know what that's 15 years ago you're talking about his boxing five years ago that's five years ago you don't know but in six months you dropped me last night oh give the lord some praises oh god don't get me started this morning you can't fix anybody in a box you say peter denied christ man just the other day he's the night two sixty days a day few days ago tonight but peter staggered these people are not drunk as you're supposed but this is that and people watching peter cannot fight that he might be like christ you you're the only ghost you you fuss with peter he denied christ and you you have a book he's now he cried tick nine three times you could write tick tick tick put 100 ticks on that does that change what god say about you don't don't get tired with people's voice in them don't get tired but your mother say your father say your sister say the devil say anybody say what you want to know what god say about you and if god say you are my son this day have i begotten you oh give the lord doesn't matter what you have done or will [Applause] do this is too much for me right now i'm on expectation now myself i've seen a shaken power come that will shake donations pretty soon god can ever get a people under his own control if he would get a man or woman that won't compromise on his word and will stand there like the rocker ages i'll believe every word of it and believe it that he's behind it a man who believes it you must act like it if you don't act like it then you don't believe it so if you're starting to line up with the word and believe the word act like it act like it if you want a revival create an atmosphere that god could meet you your praise and god in advance not because you do have problems you know but because you're showing god faith that you believe he's going to work it out everybody have problems including me not one is escape of problems challenges but your prayer is god because god's going to work it out glory to god nobody looking for trial nobody looking for sickness nobody looking for a correlation i said come i'm waiting for you nobody doing that but sometimes the winds blow contrary oh give the lord some praises it's not because you're sin it's not because you do this and do that sometimes the winds just blow contrary what do you do when the winds are going contrary god give us that voice peace be still oh help me somebody hallelujah all right and a man who believes it you must act like it if you don't act like it then you don't believe it but if you believe it act like it and you can put it to work and the word will be in you we lost all her in heritage because we compromise when we compromise we cannot expect god to keep his promise to us because we broke in upon a sacred trust and defile the trust that god has given us let us keep that trust keep it sacred keep it holy keep every word of it and compromise nowhere take god at his word and believe it act like it stand in it don't move that's what we must do that is what god is looking for church do you understand what god's looking for because i was still locked into the wood and said god you said so i'm not compromising with it i'm holding to it what we need today is not pray for more power the flip side of it now you got enough power to make a new earth what you need is faith to use that power what you need is is to control that life and live such a godly life that when you ask god anything you know we have confidence we know if we keep his commandments he withhold no good thing from us because of what the controlled life they had one thing to do he said what um what they they had but one thing to do they had but one thing to do stay straight on course not one over here one over there but still of course the church has got one thing to do stay on the course had a pillar of fire they had to keep themselves in course by following the pillar of fire that's what led them the object was they could see the pillar fire they were they seen as working through moses they know he was the leader today we got the word we follow the word we see the word working on the believers we know it so god is working with us confirming the word with signs following we stay with the word the word produces results and here what i've told you about i was going to read for you now now what could we do if we can realize and find out that jesus is still alive if we find out what that jesus is still alive why today we go to service we act like we're going to a funeral service instead like you're going to pay under the dead instead of worshiping and healing a conqueror you see what god in the message no i said that dead people you passed that dead and people did too it's a funeral a funeral and under the funeral against mysteries christ conquered debt he conquered hell he conquered a grave he conquered sin he conquered sickness we are healing a conqueror not somebody died thousands of years ago that live a good life but christ has raised again is the same yesterday to the end forever so when you come to church you come to worship and i live in christ a resurrected christ you come to honor him by saying lord i worship you i believe you you are here now the prophet is gone but the angel ain't gone the prophet gone by the spirit ain't gone oh give the lord some praises hallelujah glory could we take some more all right no when jesus rose from the dead notice before he died he was feeling a multitude and preaching to thousands and thousands and multiplying bread and fish and so on but when he rose from the dead he did not appear to the people in public with a private ministry to his elect to the believers okay what he inside closed doors he did something that to make them know it was he after talking with them all day long hearing him preach for three years he was on it then after resurrection hearing him preach and did not recognize him until he did something so he was among them and they didn't recognize him until he did something could you imagine that they live and walk with this man for three and a half years he died rose from the dead among them and they didn't know jesus listen to what the prophet said now this is beautiful isn't it strange thing that it takes something on the side of the supernatural to make us understand that it's him that teaching itself won't do it so i don't understand the lust for all these teachers the bible talk about the last days people have itching ears for new revelations and they will keep to themselves teachers because you see in your mind intellectually you want an explanation for why this happened why this happened what is happening why are you moving so why putin move into white people why are you ukraine why this and why this all the wise and the question about why you having the holy ghost yet do you want to talk about it why we don't have power we're not talking about it we're talking about england russia there's that the trilateral council illuminati the gold standard we could go on and on and on and all our room doing and already lgbtq doing and what are we doing what we doing what are we doing they're doing their do what are we doing saddam was having a great time you know salam was saddam you know god appeared to abraham and break some sea you say abraham that he gonna judge him god concerned was about luck and his family down in saddam lot didn't understand his decision would affect his family that way he thought was his own choice and decision and so on he didn't see there were secondary consequences to his decisions and many times you don't look far enough to see the consequences of our decisions secondary consequences lord had gumption he had ancient yet gumption the colon righteous man and so on like that but then when abraham said lord if there are ten righteous we do the truth he said no and abram acting under the spirit of christ and deceit for his brethren because he had a burden do you have a burden there's some person i've been listening to they like like a feather if you breathe take them to float away don't be like that you know get a burden get a burden because burden pushes you into prayer a burden pushes you to help others a burden pushes you to reach out without a burden you just go very light some people never burn for themselves which is selfishness but a burden extends beyond you hallelujah i go to the lost sheep of the house of israel a burden to get the word out a burden to witness they love one of our burden for your family and loved ones look lot a hills man treat abram who is meant ruffiano lot made a decision to pitch his time to watch southern you know so it's not that abraham had it so easy and the end of the day even though lot made a decision and got himself in trouble abraham is he one who bring deliverance abraham is the one who pleads on behalf of a god and say please plea on behalf of lot and then because of abraham pleading god can send angels down there oh glory to god angels and brother isaac bring it out mrs lott heard the angel testimony heard what has been preached heard of being said and she choose to look back choice what overthrow her own heart the lust that was in her heart all what what that giveaway just don't look back oh my hallelujah so watch so watch let's say again isn't it strange that it takes something on the side of supernatural to make us understand it is him that teaching itself won't do it he never commissioned his church to go and teach the word he said preach the gospel or or manifest the gospel people don't like to talk about that they find we're not talking mysteriously enough our brother tell me already are not deep enough i said god lord help me jesus is he pray for me right i pray for me i really want to get deep but he said not to teach the word but preach the gospel or manifest the gospel and the gospel comes not in word only but to the power and demonstration of the spirit now in truth there's the teaching part of the word and the manifestation part of the word or teaching is the seed part of the word and the gospel is the spirit part of the word both are the same one you have to have seed so jesus said that you must be born again of the word and the spirit or the water and the spirit or the word and the spirit is saying to you you have to be born again of the incorruptible seed of the word and when you get the word in you then the spirit come behind that to bring that word alive you have to put a pumpkin seed on your you have a hose of water waiting ground expecting pumpkin you know what you're expecting right he's making grass to grow on that to get pumpkin you have to put seed in there the seed is not the pumpkin the seed has the potential to produce pumpkin but the seeds have all the things in it the seed has to go in the ground well the seed is the word he said the word is a seed and the seeds are coming to you god know you were born in shape iniquity that is why you say you must be born again we are old seed or life born in sin and new seeds have to be introduced into us to start a spiritual work or a supernatural work the word have to come into you and then that word become to turn into spirit and then you have the holy ghost or give the lord or the kingdom glory to god so therefore the preaching the gospel is to manifest the word isn't that right let's continue now now let me skip there jesus i'm overcomer i'm the one that come to give life and through my debt to pay the penalty of what you've done to my life will be given to you to flow over you and you'll be sons and daughters of god as long as the seed isn't there so jesus was saying i come to die and pay the price for ease i breathing that my spirit life can flow over you to make you into a son of god as long as the seed is in there what's the secret the word is in the bride so the secret is god put the word in you and the devil don't know nothing about it because he cannot go into your heart to see what god put inside of you oh give the lord a shout he could mess with your spirit mess with your flesh he can't mess with your soul because that is where you put that seed give the lord a shout in the earth that is why god have confidence in you not so much you but the seed in you give the lord some praises on that let me drop the bomb on you one time you are not the believer the word in you is the believer so the word in you is believing god's own word god himself put it inside of you not your father not your mother not your uncle not your husband not your wife god put that inside of you [Applause] here we go this is important all of god's sons must be the same way to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to spoken word again hallelujah so god said let us make man imagine like this image and likeness spoken word son adam step out spirit man hallelujah hallelujah genesis 1 genesis 2 god 4 man out of the dust of the earth that way we get the wrong skin from dust of the earth but the first man was spirit man second man dust man where in spirit oh glory to god hallelujah praise god are you with me hallelujah then adam who god pulled the rib out and produce eve he wants to speak for a son just like god spoke for him adam wants to speak for a son let me say it again just like god spoke for adam i must speak for your son let there be set let there be a bell evils to conceive by spoken word to produce a baby oh glory to god but because we fell it fell into sex hallelujah but it was supposed to be spoken word but when jesus came he said you must be born again by the word by the spirit you must another suggestion you must it's got to happen humerus it's got to happen oh give the lord i shall you must you must must must be must born again so by the wind and spirit bring you back into sonship bring you back into our adamic seat son oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah do you see how god is here to you all right so watch this all of god's sons must be the same to be born of the wood and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in john 3 so he tied it with the script that we read to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do it brings you right back into the place where you should have been at the beginning that's why we're going back into adamic state that's why we're going back to eden we're going back to before there was a fall that is why you use the word justified justified as if you never did it only god could justify you it is god that justify it who is he that condemn it which person could accuse you of sin oh give the lord some praises this is clean gospel this is clean word you can't break this [Applause] justified the adultery fornication line what kind of thing and god come and justify you are you derek accused that you're looking looking you have all the records you can go back in the box's history book burn that book we have a new book lamb's book put blood on it and when god take your sins drop it in the sea of forgetfulness there will be a fish and go up with that no fish inside here you can't fish and bring about your sin not before god he said i died for them i paid a price for them i dropped their charges i dismiss their case nothing against you [Applause] [Music] it's good that justify it so don't look for your justification for man man all what you do all right sin or where you feel don't look for man to justify you man will never justify you not too much of jealousy and envy but david said my cup pronounced over surely goodness and mercy he said he prepares a tale for me yet yet yet he prepared a table for me in the presence of my enemies tablecloth cup hallelujah hallelujah praise god pps not just put a table you know you'll be prepared when parrot sit down you put on your napkin hallelujah knife and fork okay go get me started this morning he prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies [Applause] [Music] in the enemy's presence god himself paint a table for you [Applause] glory i could see your super church i could see your super race i could see a super seed [Applause] [Music] i ain't seen no dead bride i see no back seating right now he's gonna have that bride hoping to make it trying to escape the beast and

world and stay loving jesus and try to save the lord and save god's people i'm looking for drama i know i know i'm a king so i i understand the battle is not it is coming down the road i understand it's a long time and i know we cannot face the enemy with what we have now we have to have something more i wouldn't get time to read it but i'm talking about saul under that leadership of soul and that evil spirit leading yeah just up and just imagine anything you know spirit direction he says i want the biggest armies you know well polish young you know and go out of the way of but you see you set up your own kingdom you got away with certain things to to challenge it so when saul set up his whole army and all them fellas polish down and whatnot god arranged that goliath stepped forward send me a man to fight me anybody polishing and do they do like they're hearing are the chaplain saw the pollution boots sharpened spear polishing spear what not send me a man to fight me they're here

color clothes and so on nobody abided but god have a man a better man god have a son a better son his name is david here idiot but he's anointed he ain't ready yet but oil on him yeah idiot but the holy ghost already poured upon him the oil of the prophet samuel oh glory to god david don't even know he's been directed by the spirit his father in the spirit the spirit tell his father go and give that to your brothers they were going ordinary happy go lucky kind something for his brothers and so on and the brothers see him you could know they have battles among their own family issues why you come here for all they come and say they're battling all kind of issues they're trying to jam david they say okay brothers are going all right david heard goliath where send me a man to fight me as soon as david automatic reaction automatically familiar he said who is that uncircumcised phillies time defying the armies of the living god who is that i like that but i said who is that the privacy

prophecy they must have cut your head off without a sword oh glory to god brett tell them seven thunders utter their voices to that group that group there's a dark group oh glory to god slice and cut because it's the word of god coming from the mouth of god and the bride will be the final voice to the final age the bride will have that voice [Music] goliath hallelujah when they were finished with

that privately does your name and soul say that oh hallelujah david still coming to be king and this bride will be giving the devil's smoke in his face before we leave here this bride is going to come into power that means this holy ghost going to mount this pride oh glory to god you hear me this message will see nothing yet all these years 50 plus years a message talk there see nothing yet where tell the holy ghost mount this bride oh glory lord wait till we begin to see the manifestation of the sons of god when porn sons feel sons anointed son speak and the word is created just like that you haven't seen power but it's coming glory glory creeper going to walk we prophesy blind going to see we prophesy death gonna hear we prophesy i'm gonna speak we prophesy dead could be raised up we prophesy there's gonna be a bride revival in trinidad we prophesy nothing gonna stop it no minister nominees association no one believes nothing nobody gonna stop it i don't care what military they have nothing gonna stop it i the lord had planted i the lord started either will finish it is a rumor well gonna finish it not by mate not by power but by my spirit saith almighty god oh glory to god by his spirit he'd bring forth the church in the last days not by some minister i don't have to even be here i'm not talking about me it's not me is the prophecy this i'm not doing me you know there's nothing that god said that's why i could preach this way because god can't lie if god said greg won't be revival revival god can't lie oh glory to god there's going to be a revival in trinidad [Applause] i'm believing they're going to start now yes why wait for tomorrow when it gets that no why even next time when they can start this year [Applause] why are you for anybody when they can start with you oh give the lord a shout no minutes that's a bigger revival reach back to me preach back to me no minutes i could be a revival 35 of the combined people [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anytime you're ready for it we can have it [Music] [Applause] okay to be born of the water and spirit what does it do then it brings you right back into the place where you should have been at the beginning that's the reason of christ's debt it brings us right back again to where sons of god hallelujah and that's the way any person claims to believe god don't believe his word we'll take our inaudible creed and breathe with the word you are not of god you are dead you can't be dead in our life at the same time so even the word of god don't even grow you're just playing the part of a hypocrite let it go for bishop priest cardinal who it might be it's got to be the word or you are dead we notice the spoken word then we are god's word made manifest that's how god wants his church to manifest himself not manifest to you not manifest his own tabernacle we have nothing to do with that what god wants to do is manifest himself it is back to sins we would see jesus not see this church this church is not what god's coming to see he want to see himself that's why he said this being this faithful knowledge when it's completed it's the servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture it could also be said this way if this is not completed he will be part of the tribulation says [Applause] the minister is not going to the rapture without that being completed so the battle is not the pastor behind the blessing the battle is dead you have to get that in you you're fighting for that those virtues to live oh my god [Music] believers of the word and spirit must be one believers the word and spirit are absolutely one you don't do your own thinking you don't use your own mind the mind of christ is in you and the mind is in christ you take the word like he did excuse me with this thing i get tired quickly so yes [Music] so watch here we go let's watch yourself so the bible is manifested again like it was in the end of christ because are you ready you are a predestinated seed just like christ was yes that that amen is light you have to believe this this is the word now he's saying you are a predestinated seed just like christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the holy spirit falls false let me say again false the holy spirit have to fall i don't care what mysteries what revelation what teaching what unfolding the holy spirit of all after the mysteries after the teaching [Applause] then he says when it fell on those seeds that jesus said he chose them before the foundation of the world and they were predestinated seed is that right peter seed was in his soul but he couldn't walk out before the upper room and say my seed in my soul he said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you endure with more books more mysteries more revelations more informations more explanations no tyrion television power from one height the world is power from where on high not just from where it coming from online that means nothing below not from caesar not from pilot not from the roman government but from high they don't never experience that before you prophesy i will not give you comfortless i will come to you hallelujah a little while the world see at me no more but you're going to see me there's nothing about what you're talking about you only prophesying over at that day you shall know i'm in the father you and me and i and you he's prophesying oh shall this be and my father will manifest myself to those who follow my commandments those who love me will keep my commandments and i my father will manifest myself to them so they're going in your room waiting for something something bigger than them something more powerful than them something unexpected in the upper room mary magdalene is there along with mary mother of jesus but mary's are there oh glory to god both mary's are predestinated one was a prostitute one was virgin mary but both of them are same oh give the lord some shouts in the house all right god we can make him feel like dancing right now oh glory to god hallelujah look at the bartender and the prostitute with funny eye are you playing holy virgin mary that kind of work you know everybody had to hit the upper room oh glory everybody have to get this word and spirit this power this anointing this dynamic this spirit look at the lord i shout oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god oh my hallelujah all right so watch you said no when it fell on those seas that jesus chose before the function of the world they were predestined to see this is not right and they haul themselves up in the upper room these seeds the word the world was laying there without life in it all of a sudden there comes some heaven as the waters begin to gush down we can't preach waters man we can preach wood but the waters have to gush them you understand what we're doing there there were the word the word was in them but they need water they said no life was laying in there just a word inside these brothers but the breath of the water to explode they're waiting for water to show the title d the abstract title deed they're waiting for water to manifest the virtue of christ they're waiting for the waters to say silver gold have i none what a high i could give without them waters they can't give nothing because of waters is the power behind it jesus said it is where he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall float rivers of living water this spare key of the spirit which was not yet released oh okay the lord has shout because jesus had not yet died so that's water he prophesied was prophecy that the spirit will come artesian well he that believeth on me as the scripture out of his belly his belly his belly not somebody as well his belly shall flow flow flow flow blessed is the man that walketh not on the consequent godly nor stand in the way of the sin of sinners nor seat of the seat up sit in the sea of the scornful but isn't is he light in the law of the lord and in that law shall he merit a day and night he shall be like a tree [Music] i want to plant you by the water your leaves will not wither and whatsoever you do it sheltered prosper so talk loud i don't hear you loud enough prosper hey man give the lord a shout our praise whatever you do will not pass you [Music] you will see god hand upon your life amen all right the haulings of the upper room all of a sudden they came outside from heaven as the waters began to gush down it actually fill all the house where they were sitting and the seeds began to grow it began to manifest itself the word of god being manifested so watch all the power peter and him had cast no devils and doing work with jesus was temporary that is only because they are suicidal jesus he gave them a lick of the fire upon them but it wasn't in them they didn't know what spirit they were of he told them that when they had issues trying to call on fire trying to stop somebody from preaching he said listen all the people are seth now they know you know what spiritual earth shall be calling for fire like elijah they feel they could speak all kind of thing no they have no holy ghost area they have a temporary blessing for ministry to work with jesus same as when god gave you the new spirit to work with your own spirit your new spirit is to get along with the holy spirit because you're spiritual corrupt and the only reason upon you is trouble so you say i'll give you a new spirit to help you walk along with the holy spirit see all right all right so let's continue here don't put it back see how the all right let's get down here i sk i skip this you talk about um men want i i believe in the leadership i believe in the leadership of the holy ghost coming to the word i believe also that god has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order i believe also the church is ruled by men that god sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that there's not men really ruling by the spirit of god for the word and spirit are one see remember them which have ruled over you who have spoken unto you the word and whose fate follow considering the end of the conversation but kelly so thank you for that letter that you sent but see what was happening back there that false vine was getting a hole it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it god's way they simply took authority vested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between god and the people this is the issue right here there is no fight for ministries to establishing god and the people that is not wanted for at all you see that the holy priesthood standing between you and god you had to go to the priest to get to god that the ironic thing see hear what he said you know he said they went back look he said right here he said they vested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with the holy priesthood standing between god and the people they went right back to the old ironic system they became antichrist for the dispose of his ministership imposed their own god hated that the ephesians hated that and any two believers hate that too we would have to be stoned blind not to see the same thing at work all through the ages and right now it is worst of all what it was was organization that separated the people god's people are supposed to be one by one spirit they're all baptized into one body and everyone is to be moved upon by the holy ghost oh god this song is so good everyone is to be moved upon by the holy ghost isn't that right right and he says now watch okay and everyone is to participate in the worship of god but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control bishop become archbishop and with imposing titles they passed the word and got and taught their own doctrines they got the people to obey them until the time came their way of worship did not anyway resemble the early after pentecost these deeds would be given to the apostolic succession from apostolic succession it was one easy and quick step to teach membership as a means of saving grace the word were reduced or creed antichrist by his spirit was predominate in the church and people didn't recognize it lucifer take over the church lucy for playing priests lucifer playing pastor prophet teacher evangelist and works my here we go home stretch you must be born again but i'm saying that was the first doctrine of jesus you must be born again he said you search through the subject it's a very deep one we find out there are so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all the churches will say you must be born again but each one of their different interpretations are what you must be one again so when you said he didn't say you ought to be born again he said you must now we english-speaking people understand what the word must means it is absolutely you got to do it it's must not you ought to you'd be better off if you did but you must be born again and if you can just take that word this morning and break it down what it means how it is totally impossible it's essential and great it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until you are born again there's not one person here want to go to torment there's nobody here drive hundreds of miles shake people's hand and so on like that and there's duties of pastors to see that this flock is fed and so on like that right i'll skip down a little bit now now watch no matter how much we try to think we are right insane a creed or joining a church you are still what you were until you were actually born again of the spirit of god it doesn't change you your creed so all this confession i believe this i believe this i believe this i believe that that is engineer something that happened to change you watch it doesn't change you your creed joining church changing your ideas or good intentions although as good as it might seem is still not right there's something got to happen see happen something after what something have to happen the new boot is an experience say after me the new birth is an experience people don't like to talk about the experience because it's word word word right but the new birth is an experience something have to happen the word is happen jacob had money jacob had wives jacob had money and wealth and everything else but something happened to him when he knew he had to go back to his hong kong to hometown he was fighting and jacob no fear inside of him so he can't play that he can't sing a song and say okay oh how i love jesus he still fighting and he fighting so much as he said god you tell me come here but look this is my oh kill me you know i am fighting and jacob wrestled all night long until something happened his testimony wasn't his testimony wasn't he made the angel you know no he's testimony angel touch him and he started to walk lymph no no all time he had his strength working good he was afraid no you're walking limp and you're not afraid you're walking slower but you're not afraid there's something happening something happened that isaky had changed it's not about eso so it's not about your enemy you see you think about your enemy and this one and that one you think about them is about you you have to change you after something happened to you yeah you think if this move and that movement this change that they no no you you are the problem don't say amen it's still you after keep quiet to steal you after making excuses it's still you it's all about you when you change everything i'm wrong you're going to change oh give the lord a shout jacob knew his name was changed nobody else knew it was jacob hallelujah your name no longer gonna be jacob gonna be israel he must change god wants you to change all right so watch you join in church changing your ideas your good intentions although as good as it might seem still not right there's something going to happen a new body is an experience something that takes place so it is not that that brings a new book now different churches say well you accept this or believe this but that isn't it so no matter how much we think we are right saying or creed and what not you say you must be born again in order to be born again here we go jesus said you must be born again all to be born again is letting yourself go and die and the spirit of christ coming to you and you're no more yours it's christ in you see the holy spirit paul said i die daily daily yet i live not i but christ live it in me count please and if i told you that the spirit of john dillinger was in me i've had guns here and be outlawed because that was his spirit in me if i told you the spirit of as an artist you expect me to paint the pictures about this if i tell them a christian and the spirit of christ is in me or in you then we do the works of christ and jesus said in saint john he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also but abound if the tree was holy his branch is holy the original tree because they disbelieved the pentecostal message that paul was preaching god cut them off took a wild olive tree the witches of the gentiles grafted us in that we might live off the substance of that tree now how much more in this day when we are rejecting the pentecostal message that come down to the church ages how much more is god able to take the old wild tree off of it anyhow and let the other one come in because he will reject it because of unbelief now you know where we are standing now don't you we are the end time for the taken away of the gentile church the rapture for it the issuing in of the holy ghost to come upon the jews and jesus then begins to have known to the seal 144 thousand there you are bringing back the original tree back into the blessed israel again jesus ain't going to stand outside of your door and knock all the time there's a time when he will get enough and turn away then you will do the knocking you will never find him come while it is time come while there's a knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the holy ghost like they got at pentecost with the same type of water baptism the same thing i did back there don't you let nothing put anything in your heart less than that may the lord bless you let's all stand i begin to give god some praises
