[8:20] God only knows.
[8:25] I'm glad you see
[8:30] through eyes of love.
[8:34] I was a hopeless case,
[8:40] an empty space
[8:44] if not for grace.
[8:48] Oh, where would I be?
[8:53] God only knows.
[8:58] I'm glad you see
[9:03] through eyes of love.

[10:02] I'm glad you see.

[10:25] A heart like yours
[10:29] is my desire.
[10:34] A heart like yours

[11:20] Full of compassion.
[11:24] Nothing wrong with it.
[11:29] Please help me Lord. Give me a heart
[11:34] like
[11:35] yours.
[11:43] Hallelujah.
[11:52] Amen.
[11:54] As Pastor Stephanas gets ready to come
[11:57] forward, let's do the song.
[11:59] They will all
[12:02] pass away,
[12:05] but there's something
[12:09] about
[12:12] that name. Oh, every hand lifted up.
[12:16] Let's sing to Jesus. You are Jesus.
[12:21] Sweet Jesus,
[12:25] you are Jesus.
[12:31] There is something
[12:35] about
[12:37] your name.
[12:44] You're my master
[12:48] savior.
[12:50] You are Jesus.
[12:56] Let all heaven
[13:00] and earth
[13:02] proclaim.
[13:09] Kings
[13:12] and kingdoms.
[13:14] They will all
[13:17] pass away.
[13:20] But there's something
[13:24] about
[13:26] that name. Oh kings and kingdoms.
[13:31] Oh
[13:33] kings
[13:36] and kingdoms.
[13:39] They will all
[13:42] pass away.
[13:45] But there's something
[13:49] about
[13:51] that name.
[13:58] There is something
[14:01] about
[14:04] that name. Let's sing it one more. Kings
[14:07] and kingdoms.
[14:09] Kings
[14:12] and kingdoms.
[14:14] They will all
[14:17] fade away,
[14:21] but there's something
[14:25] about
[14:27] that name.
[14:31] Amen. Amen.
[14:34] Amen.
[14:37] Amen.
[14:40] Isn't it something?
[14:43] Kings and kingdom will all fail away.
[14:49] But you serve a king. You are living in
[14:52] a kingdom that will never pass away.
[15:00] What our brother Wickley for speaking
[15:03] a spiritual revelation.
[15:07] When that kingdom becomes open to you
[15:10] personally
[15:12] and you personally get a revelation, you
[15:15] are a part of this kingdom that will
[15:17] never fail away. Only the spirit can
[15:21] reveal it to you.
[15:24] A revelation about the kingdom of God.
[15:31] I want to say that before we move on.
[15:35] You say, "But Stephanus,
[15:38] how can I get more revelation about this
[15:41] kingdom and about my calling and about
[15:44] what I am? How can I get more of that?
[15:47] Don't you want to have more about it? Or
[15:50] do you want to have revelation about
[15:52] things in the world? Do you want to
[15:54] understand the things in the world and
[15:56] the things in your friends life and
[15:57] things in there and things of the
[15:59] problems? I don't have to understand the
[16:01] problems. I know they are there.
[16:04] I don't have to analyze the problems. I
[16:06] know they are there.
[16:08] But I want to have a revelation.
[16:11] If you want to have spiritual revelation
[16:14] by the spirit of God,
[16:16] the Bible tells me, he says,
[16:20] "Knock
[16:22] and it will be open.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Search
[16:27] and you will find."
[16:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will supply all your needs.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Everything that you need."
[16:39] And I love what brother said yesterday.
[16:42] He says, "Revelation
[16:44] by the spirit gives you a vision.
[16:48] And when you have a vision, you shall
[16:50] not perish.
[16:52] But you know where your stand is, where
[16:54] you go
[16:56] and what to do."
[16:59] Peter had a revelation
[17:03] who the son of God is.
[17:06] But when the day of Pentecost was fully
[17:08] come,
[17:12] his revelation
[17:14] turned into a manifestation by the
[17:17] spirit.
[17:19] And Hebrews 13:8, THOU art the SON OF
[17:22] GOD. BUT NOW THE SON OF GOD IS IN ME
[17:26] &gt;&gt; turned into power,
[17:28] &gt;&gt; turned into life
[17:30] &gt;&gt; and turned into a light.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; And it shook the world.
[17:36] So I pray this morning as we invite our
[17:39] precious brother over it the second
[17:40] time. Father make us one.
[17:44] Make us one with your vision.
[17:47] Make me one with the vision that God has
[17:49] for my life. Make me one with your plan.
[17:53] Make me one with your spirit. And then
[17:56] when you're one with him, we can be one
[17:59] one another. Father, make us one. For
[18:04] what? The spirit CAN COME DOWN. 10 days
[18:06] they were together in the upper room. 10
[18:08] days with a revelation, but then the
[18:11] spirit turned it into life
[18:14] and a manifestation of Hebrews 13:8.
[18:17] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[18:19] forever in their personal life
[18:22] become a manifestation.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; You can never be too little
[18:29] &gt;&gt; for the spirit of God.
[18:32] It's rather you can to be big that God
[18:34] has to pull you down
[18:36] to be able to work with you.
[18:40] I'm looking for meetings. I don't know
[18:42] if it's today,
[18:44] but I'm looking for meetings and I have
[18:46] the face while Peter yet spake the word.
[18:51] The Holy Ghost comes down himself
[18:55] &gt;&gt; and he serves you.
[18:59] Preacher cannot preach anymore.
[19:02] Whenever is expect him,
[19:05] expect him to do the impossible because
[19:08] we serve a god as is in the impossible.
[19:10] He makes all things possible.
[19:14] God bless you.
[19:21] the make
[19:24] us one.
[19:29] Close your eyes and sing it with hands
[19:31] lifted up.
[19:44] Father,
[19:47] make
[19:49] us one.
[19:55] That the world
[19:58] may know
[20:00] that thou has sent
[20:04] your son in me. Father, father,
[20:11] make
[20:13] us one. And this atmosphere, I want that
[20:17] you greet each other
[20:20] as we sing it one more. Go to your
[20:22] brother. Go to your sister with a
[20:25] burning into your heart. Say, "Father,
[20:27] make us one. Make us more one, Father.
[20:44] as the world
[20:47] may know.
[20:50] Thou has sent
[20:53] your son.
[20:57] Father
[21:00] make
[21:02] us one.
[21:08] Oh may
[21:11] sing great
[21:15] how sweet
[21:19] the sound
[21:22] that has this is your personal
[21:24] testimony. He has saved me. A wretch
[21:28] like me.
[21:34] I once
[21:38] was lost
[21:41] by now.
[21:44] I found.
[21:47] Was blind.
[21:51] I now
[21:54] I see. Let's sing a verse before we move
[21:58] on. Oh, it was grace.
[22:03] Let
[22:06] my heart
[22:09] to fear
[22:13] and grace
[22:16] my fears
[22:19] really
[22:25] how graious
[22:32] that Praise
[22:35] appear.
[22:41] I first
[22:45] be
[22:50] through
[22:54] the day
[22:58] choice
[23:00] andess
[23:03] I have
[23:07] already Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus. I've
[23:10] come through it, Lord. Father,
[23:14] all this grace
[23:19] that brought
[23:22] me save
[23:25] this far
[23:28] and grace
[23:31] will lead. The Holy Spirit is the grace
[23:35] to you. He will lead you home. His grace
[23:38] be with you. Oh, then when we
[23:44] been there,
[23:49] we're going to look back one day. Yes,
[23:52] Lord. Bright shining
[23:57] as
[23:59] the sun.
[24:06] We've no
[24:09] less
[24:12] to sing
[24:15] God's praise
[24:18] than when
[24:21] we first
[24:25] beg. And that's why we all everybody of
[24:28] us can sing Amazing Grace.
[24:32] me.
[24:34] Sing great
[24:38] how sweet
[24:41] that sounds
[24:44] that have saved
[24:47] a rich
[25:16] And there's something in me that says,
[25:18] "Praise God."
[25:21] Oh, praise God.
[25:25] Praise God.
[25:35] Hallelujah.
[26:08] Praise the Lord.
[26:16] Let us have a word of prayer.
[26:19] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[26:21] presence this morning. We feel that we
[26:24] are in your divine will, your in divine
[26:26] order. And I pray that you would speak
[26:29] to us this morning. We need to hear from
[26:32] you. Take me out of the way and may be
[26:36] glorified in our midst. Come down,
[26:37] Father, and visit your children. This is
[26:40] such a critical hour, Father. Uh there's
[26:42] things going around the world that tells
[26:45] us the time is near. The time is ending.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Lord. Revelation 10, the angel cried
[26:51] out, "Time shall be no more. Even time
[26:54] itself runs out."
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[26:56] &gt;&gt; God. We are running out of time. Time to
[26:58] make it right. Time to get it right.
[27:01] Time for the Holy Ghost.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Time for that breakthrough and
[27:04] deliverance.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Time is ticking, Lord. Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; And just as natural time, whether we
[27:10] lazy, whether we are tired, whether
[27:12] weary, time keep moving on.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; We cannot stop time. We cannot harness
[27:18] time. We cannot prevent time.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Time just keep ticking, Lord.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; And the clock of your promised word is
[27:25] ticking.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; That clock to fulfill your promised
[27:28] word. Father, come here today and may
[27:30] each one receive a revelation of their
[27:32] purpose, a revelation of their calling.
[27:35] give them vision, inspiration, and Lord,
[27:37] may you lead us this morning by your
[27:39] spirit and may the angel drop down here
[27:42] in our midst in Jesus name I ask it.
[27:45] Amen and amen. God bless you. If you
[27:47] have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn
[27:49] to two portion scripture. One, we want
[27:51] to read I'll read this one first in John
[27:53] 14. We want to read verse 15 to 21 and
[27:58] then we want to read Ezekiel 9
[28:01] 1-6 and then verse 11. So we want to
[28:05] turn to John chapter 14
[28:08] reading from verse 15.
[28:14] And whatsoever. Okay. If you love me,
[28:16] keep my commandments.
[28:20] And I will pray the father and he shall
[28:22] give you another comforter that he may
[28:25] abide with you forever.
[28:28] Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world
[28:32] cannot receive, because it seeth him
[28:34] not, neither knoweth him. But he know
[28:37] him, for he dwelleth with you, shall be
[28:40] in you.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[28:44] come to you. Yet a little while, and the
[28:48] world seeth me no more, but he see me,
[28:51] because I live, he shall live also. And
[28:54] at that day he shall know that I am in
[28:57] my father and ye in me and I in you.
[29:01] He that hath my commandments and keepeth
[29:04] them. He it is that loveth me. But he
[29:07] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[29:10] father and I would love him and will
[29:13] manifest myself to him. Ezekiel chapter
[29:16] 9
[29:18] reading from verse one.
[29:21] He cried also in my ear with a loud
[29:23] voice, saying,
[29:25] cause them that have charge over the
[29:27] city to draw near, even every man with
[29:32] his destroying weapon in his hand. And
[29:36] behold, six men came from the way of the
[29:38] higher gate, which lith towards the
[29:40] north, and every man a slaughter weapon
[29:43] in his hand. And one man among them was
[29:46] clothed with linen with the writer's ink
[29:50] horn by his side. And they went in and
[29:54] stood besides the brazen altar. And the
[29:56] glory of the God of Israel was gone up
[29:58] from the cherub whereupon he was to the
[30:02] threshold of the house. And he called to
[30:05] the man clothed with linen which were
[30:07] had the righteous incorn by his side.
[30:10] And the Lord said unto him,
[30:14] "Go through the midst of the city,
[30:17] through the midst of Jerusalem,
[30:19] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[30:22] men that sigh and cry for all the
[30:26] abominations that be done in the midst
[30:28] thereof."
[30:29] And to the others, he said in my
[30:32] hearing, "Go ye after him through the
[30:36] city, and smite. Let not your eyes peer,
[30:40] neither have you pity. Slay utterly old
[30:44] and young, both maids and little
[30:47] children and women, but come not near
[30:51] any man upon whom is the mark,
[30:54] &gt;&gt; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they
[30:58] began at the ancient men which were
[31:02] before the house. And verse 11 says,
[31:05] "And behold, the man clothed with linen,
[31:08] which had the ink on by his side,
[31:09] reported the matter, saying, I have done
[31:12] as thou had commanded me." May God bless
[31:14] his word. You may be seated. Praise the
[31:16] Lord.
[31:28] This morning I have a title,
[31:32] the sealing angel.
[31:34] That's the title this morning. The
[31:37] sealing angel.
[31:39] I have an inspiration.
[31:42] Seal those who sigh and cry.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; I have a question.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Have you been baptized
[31:50] &gt;&gt; into the body?
[31:53] Now,
[31:55] &gt;&gt; what we will share this morning
[31:59] has nothing to do with the element of
[32:00] man. As I said last night, we're not
[32:04] here to talk about Ukraine or Russia.
[32:07] We're not here to talk about the
[32:08] economy. We're not talking about finance
[32:11] and all the world troubles. We are here
[32:13] to focus
[32:16] &gt;&gt; on what God has promised for this hour
[32:19] &gt;&gt; and what we supposed to have and
[32:21] possess. Amen.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; And what God is expecting of us.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; You see, not only must we have
[32:27] expectations,
[32:28] &gt;&gt; but we have to understand God himself
[32:31] have expectations.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; He have expectations of us.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[32:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, he has expectation that
[32:40] we will do what he said we will do.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Because he made promises that he cannot
[32:45] change.
[32:47] Now, that stone we spoke about last
[32:49] night,
[32:50] that stone that was cut out without the
[32:53] hands of man that Daniel saw, listen to
[32:56] these words. The coming of that stone
[33:00] up went the church into glory at the
[33:03] rapture because it ended the gentile
[33:06] dispensation.
[33:08] God ended it up the coming of that
[33:10] stone. So this stone, this dynamics,
[33:14] this holy ghost is what going to close
[33:15] off the gentile dispensation.
[33:19] The Gentiles have no certain time. It is
[33:22] called the times of the Gentiles or
[33:25] until the fullness of the Gentiles come
[33:28] in.
[33:29] What we don't know is when that last
[33:32] name will be called because one of these
[33:34] days this last name that is written in
[33:37] the book
[33:38] &gt;&gt; will be called. Isn't that right?
[33:40] Brought into redemption and then the
[33:43] book is closed.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; No more to be saved.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; The prophet said the bride will be here
[33:48] a while preaching to the eternal lost.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Not the lost, the eternal lost. In other
[33:54] words, the witness of the gospel still
[33:56] have to go forth.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus himself said when you hear of
[34:01] wars and rumors of wars,
[34:03] &gt;&gt; the end is not yet.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Earthquakes, the end is not yet.
[34:07] hurricanes and all kind of disasters.
[34:09] The end is not yet. He said this gospel
[34:13] must be preached
[34:14] &gt;&gt; and then the end shall come.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; So our signs is not earthquakes and
[34:18] hurricanes and all these different
[34:19] things around. We have to see this
[34:21] gospel
[34:22] &gt;&gt; and this gospel is not in word only.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; This gospel has to be in power
[34:28] &gt;&gt; and demonstration
[34:30] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Do you see it now? So all the teachings
[34:36] &gt;&gt; and mysteries revealing
[34:38] &gt;&gt; and unfolding. He's not saying this
[34:41] gospel must be taught.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; No, this gospel must be preached.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; It have a teaching part. It have a
[34:49] preaching part. It have a teaching part
[34:51] which he call it the former rain to sew
[34:53] the seed. And it have the latter raining
[34:55] to manifest what the s the former rain
[34:58] has seeded down inside of you. This
[35:01] manifestation part is the gospel.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; The gospel is the word made manifest or
[35:08] the word confirmed or the word
[35:10] vindicated. That is the gospel.
[35:14] Hallelujah. That is what brother Branham
[35:16] had. That is what brother Brandham
[35:19] produced. He would preach. He say you
[35:21] know what I'm waiting on? I'm waiting on
[35:23] the angel. Then he say he is here. I
[35:26] take every spirit under my control
[35:28] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. And he manifested
[35:32] Jesus Christ. He manifested the gospel.
[35:35] And Jesus said, "The same works I do
[35:39] shall you do also." That's a promise.
[35:43] Hallelujah.
[35:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You be seated.
[35:49] And the same pay or the same salary that
[35:52] Peter received, we have to receive. It's
[35:55] the same penny. The same penny the early
[35:57] church had. We have to have. We don't
[35:59] want less than that. Isn't that right?
[36:01] So therefore, the stone
[36:04] comes out to close off the gentile
[36:06] dispensation
[36:07] because why? God have to go back to the
[36:10] Jews because there's 144,000
[36:14] to be sealed. And in the book of
[36:16] Revelation chapter 7, the Bible talk
[36:19] about the four winds being stopped. And
[36:22] verse two of Revelation 7 says, "And I
[36:25] saw another angel."
[36:27] This is not a man. Now, not a man from
[36:30] America, a man from Europe, a man from
[36:33] Africa. No, I saw another angel
[36:37] ascending from the east having the seal
[36:42] &gt;&gt; of the living God.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; And he cried with a loud voice to the
[36:46] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[36:48] the earth and see, "Hurt not the earth.
[36:51] hurt not the sea or the trees till we
[36:54] have sealed the servants of God in their
[36:57] foreheads.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; So there is a sealing.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Then he said he said and I heard the
[37:04] number of them that were sealed and the
[37:06] number was sealed 144,000 of the tribes.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; So we know by the scriptures
[37:14] 144,000 Jews will be sealed.
[37:17] But this just bring a confirmation or
[37:20] vindication before they are sealed.
[37:23] There's a bride
[37:25] &gt;&gt; to be sealed.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; And the sealing angel is already here.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[37:33] Hallelujah.
[37:36] Let's go, brother.
[37:40] Now, many times I don't really quote
[37:41] where I'm getting the message from, but
[37:43] this is from the seal of the Antichrist.
[37:45] He said this, "The first thing you know,
[37:49] the time will come when God will give a
[37:53] message and you will be sealed in or out
[37:57] of the kingdom."
[37:58] &gt;&gt; He is prophesying
[38:00] &gt;&gt; of a message coming,
[38:02] &gt;&gt; a message in the message,
[38:04] &gt;&gt; a sealing message.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; That people would either be sealed in or
[38:09] sealed out.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Of the kingdom. He said, "Dear brother,
[38:14] if you haven't got the baptism of the
[38:16] Holy Ghost this morning, run into the
[38:19] kingdom of God as quick as you can.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; The sealing time is on."
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, William Brham
[38:28] prophesied there's going to be a sealing
[38:31] time. Do you know we have to be sealed
[38:34] from faith all the way up to charity?
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Those virtues are seven seals. Those
[38:43] virtues represent a finished work
[38:46] &gt;&gt; because when the work is completed, you
[38:48] put the seal on it.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Grieve not the Holy Spirit.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Whereby you are sealed until the day of
[38:55] your redemption.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:02] Hallelujah.
[39:04] The sealant time is on.
[39:07] The prophet
[39:09] in one of the seals he was saying we are
[39:12] now
[39:13] in the time of
[39:16] the revelations of these things being
[39:19] made known.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; So for the last 50 years
[39:25] we have been in the time of
[39:28] the revelation
[39:30] of the things being made known. But
[39:33] after that time is over,
[39:35] it transitions or shifts into the
[39:38] manifestation
[39:40] of the revelation
[39:42] &gt;&gt; of what was made known.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; So for 50 plus years, serpent seed,
[39:47] pope, mism, vials, woes, thunders, new
[39:51] name, all kind of revelations and
[39:52] mysteries being made known by teachings,
[39:56] by former reign, by people being
[39:59] positionally placed. And I ask a
[40:01] question. They like to say the quote,
[40:04] you know, the teacher positionally
[40:07] places the believers. But what are you
[40:10] placed for?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; You are not placed to be dead.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; You are not placed to be dull.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus rose from the dead,
[40:20] he had a private ministry with his own
[40:22] disciples. Jesus didn't go on no
[40:24] mountain and feed no multitude. know he
[40:27] had a special private meeting with his
[40:30] disciples and he opened the word to them
[40:33] and he opened their understanding. In
[40:36] other words, he positionally placed them
[40:38] to receive something and he breathed
[40:40] upon them receive ye the Holy Ghost. So
[40:43] they were placed positionally to receive
[40:46] power. They were placed positionally to
[40:48] receive spirit. You are not placed
[40:50] positionally to warm a nice church
[40:52] bench. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[40:56] You are placed
[40:58] to receive something.
[41:02] Give the Lord a shout.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; God is NOT PLACING YOU JUST TO PLACE
[41:09] YOU.
[41:11] You may be seated.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; That's why when Samson asked to be
[41:14] placed, he said, "Lead me
[41:17] &gt;&gt; between the two pillars. I want to be in
[41:21] my position
[41:23] &gt;&gt; before the power strikes. because the
[41:25] power could you imagine Samson is
[41:27] nowhere and he's in the middle of the
[41:29] field and the power strike him and he
[41:31] just jumping
[41:33] &gt;&gt; nothing happening.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; So he said lead me
[41:38] &gt;&gt; between that two polars.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; So he could stand there and say Lord
[41:42] send your power and when the power
[41:44] struck him he could push
[41:46] &gt;&gt; like he never pushed before.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO YOU HAVE TO BE
[41:52] positionally placed
[41:54] &gt;&gt; to receive power.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL, NOT MAYBE, NOT PERHAPS, NOT
[42:03] I'M WONDERING. YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER
[42:07] &gt;&gt; AFTER THE HOLY GHOST.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; NOT LUTHER, NOT WESLEY, NOT THE
[42:12] PENTECOSTAL.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; After the Holy Ghost itself,
[42:16] &gt;&gt; the person of Christ
[42:17] &gt;&gt; going to come upon you.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[42:21] Hallelujah.
[42:22] Hallelujah.
[42:25] Praise God. Praise God. He said the
[42:27] sealing time is on. Praise God. Jesus
[42:32] in Matthew 11,
[42:35] he was given a type.
[42:37] And Jesus said these words, "If a son
[42:41] shall ask bread of any of you that is a
[42:44] father, will he give him a stone?
[42:48] or if he asks a fish, will he for a fish
[42:51] give him a serpent? Or if he asks an
[42:54] egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
[42:57] Then he said this, "If ye then being
[43:02] evil, know how to give good gifts unto
[43:05] your children,
[43:07] how much more
[43:09] &gt;&gt; shall your heavenly Father
[43:11] &gt;&gt; give the Holy Spirit
[43:13] &gt;&gt; to them that ask him?"
[43:17] Oh, brother Oid, we have to ask for it.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[43:22] &gt;&gt; we have to know it is promised.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; You can't ask if you know it is
[43:25] promised. This Holy Ghost is promised
[43:28] and you have to ask for it
[43:30] &gt;&gt; to get it.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[43:33] Hallelujah. Do you believe that this
[43:35] morning?
[43:38] Brother Brandham in the 10 versions he
[43:40] said these words talking about the two
[43:42] spirits so close it will deceive the
[43:45] very elected. Listen to these words.
[43:49] These two spirits
[43:52] are marking their people for future
[43:56] judgment.
[43:57] So tonight right now in this service you
[44:02] are being marked.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Marked for the Holy Ghost.
[44:11] Do do you understand? It's two spirits.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Mark of the beast
[44:16] &gt;&gt; or the seed of God.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; He says these two spirits
[44:21] &gt;&gt; are marking their people for future
[44:24] judgment.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; What is the judgment of the bride? The
[44:27] reward.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; What is your judgment? The token.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost itself. Amen.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; But go in the midst of the city
[44:37] &gt;&gt; and put a mark.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; PUT A MARK. MARK THEM.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; THIS ONE HERE.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; This one here.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; And look INTO THE HEART. THIS ONE HERE.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; PUT A MARK.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; UPON THOSE THAT SIGH and cry. So God is
[44:53] marking his people even this morning.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Woo. You may be seated. Do you know
[45:04] revelation marks you?
[45:07] &gt;&gt; But Abraham say it's not a mark on your
[45:08] forehead. It's not a physical mark. He
[45:11] says mark on your head and your hands.
[45:13] He said your head is your revelation and
[45:16] your hands is what you do about it.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; That is the mark. I'll say it again. The
[45:20] mark is the revelation and the hands is
[45:23] what you do about the revelation.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; What did Habac say? Write the vision.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandon is.
[45:33] Make it plain. That's what a five-fold
[45:36] ministry is supposed to do.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; That he that readth may run, not walk,
[45:42] &gt;&gt; not sit,
[45:43] &gt;&gt; but get into action.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:50] So, Brother Brham
[45:52] wrote the vision and a fifold ministry
[45:56] was supposed to come behind the prophet
[45:57] and echo and clarify and make known the
[46:01] vision. Because the vision OF TO GET TO
[46:04] THE PEOPLE.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE MINISTER'S VISION. THIS
[46:10] IS THE VISION OF THE BRIDE.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE VISION OF THE BODY.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[46:19] Listen, the prophet said no minister
[46:22] could bring A REVIVAL.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; THE REVIVAL HAVE TO COME BY the people.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS SOMEWHERE THIS VISION HAVE TO
[46:30] BE TRANSFERRED. FROM THE PULPIT TO THE
[46:33] PEOPLE.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; God love you so much. He promised to
[46:51] send a five-fold ministry
[46:54] &gt;&gt; for the perfecting of the saints,
[46:57] for the work of the ministry, for the
[46:59] edifying. He concerned about you so
[47:01] much. He didn't send you for a fivefold,
[47:03] you know. Think about it.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; He sent a five-fold for you.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; His concern is you, your health,
[47:12] &gt;&gt; your strength,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; your power. Because God is a God of the
[47:16] audience.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; The reason we fell in the early church
[47:22] is because they took God from the people
[47:26] and put it on a man.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAY, "I HATE THAT.
[47:33] YES, SIR.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; I want to get that to you.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; THE TOOK THE GOD THAT WAS IN THE MIDST
[47:39] of the people. He said, "I will be your
[47:41] people. I will be your God. You shall be
[47:44] my people. I would walk among them. I
[47:46] would wipe your tears. I will do this
[47:48] for you. This is the God we serve him."
[47:51] HE WAS A GOD OF THE PEOPLE.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; They took the spirit.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; They took the God in their midst. And
[47:56] they end up with a pope.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; A message pope. A man poop
[48:02] &gt;&gt; our pastor our man man of the hour main
[48:06] man only manes message man
[48:10] &gt;&gt; God say I hate that
[48:13] &gt;&gt; because that is nicolating spirit
[48:15] &gt;&gt; that conquers the ley and if the ley is
[48:18] conquered the spirit can't move because
[48:21] a man is dominating your spirit
[48:23] dominating your mind dominating what you
[48:25] hear dominating but he says say what the
[48:28] tape say so if we say what the tape See,
[48:30] YOU ARE DOMINATED BY THE WORD OF GOD
[48:33] BECAUSE the spirit AND THE PROPHET AND
[48:36] THE BRIDE WILL SAY THE SAME THING.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[48:47] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. WE DON'T HAVE OUR
[48:51] OWN MESSAGE.
[48:53] IT'S A ONE-MAN MESSAGE.
[48:56] OH, give the Lord some praises. It's a
[48:58] one-man message. That man is William,
[49:01] Marian, and Panam. GOD SENT, "BEHOLD, I
[49:03] send you Elijah." He sent Elijah with a
[49:05] message. And we are echoing that message
[49:07] this morning.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 4
[49:15] verse 17 says,
[49:17] "For the time is come that judgment must
[49:21] begin at the house of God. And if it
[49:23] begin at us,
[49:26] what shall the end be of they that obey
[49:30] not the gospel of God? And if the
[49:33] righteous scarcely be saved, where shall
[49:35] the ungodly and the sinner appear?
[49:39] Note six angels.
[49:42] These were judgment angels. God says
[49:46] destroy. Out of the six, one have the
[49:50] inhorn.
[49:52] God said, "Before you strike, put out
[49:56] that inkorn writer
[49:59] &gt;&gt; and let him put a mark
[50:01] &gt;&gt; upon those specific group, those that
[50:05] sigh
[50:07] &gt;&gt; and those that cry."
[50:09] outside of that group. Slay children,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; women,
[50:15] men, boys, girls, everyone without the
[50:20] mark.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Where to begin?
[50:24] In my sanctuary.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Do people still believe this message?
[50:29] &gt;&gt; People still believe this Bible. They
[50:31] believe the God of the word.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; This is not we are trying to say
[50:35] something to you. You know this is what
[50:37] the Bible said. Judgment will begin
[50:41] &gt;&gt; in the house of God. Anas and Safara
[50:45] very interesting. Brother Anas and
[50:48] sister Safh
[50:50] is living with him. My problem are not
[50:52] so much brother brother anas you know
[50:55] because he was a tricky guy. He was not
[50:59] living right. His wife knew him and she
[51:03] didn't have to go the way he went. They
[51:05] offered to sell their goods and they
[51:08] came to Peter and be said, "Is this
[51:10] all?" He could have said, "No, this is
[51:13] not all. We kept back some."
[51:15] &gt;&gt; That was open. That was honest. That was
[51:17] no lie. He said, "Yes." He said, "But
[51:18] you lie to me.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; You lie to the Holy Ghost." But Peter,
[51:21] you deny Christ. That has nothing to do
[51:23] with it.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; PETER, YOU DENY CHRIST THREE TIMES. That
[51:29] has nothing to do with it. The past of
[51:33] Peter had nothing TO DO BECAUSE FIRE
[51:36] BOMBED OUT THAT DEMON OUT OF PETER.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; FIRE
[51:41] WAS IN PETER'S HEART.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Peter had the pillar of fire
[51:48] &gt;&gt; in his heart.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; You be seated.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I know him.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Do you really know him? Do you know what
[51:56] God did for him last night?
[51:58] &gt;&gt; You don't know him. You could look at
[52:00] somebody and last week they are one way
[52:02] and last night something happened to
[52:04] them. You don't know them. You don't
[52:06] know what the Lord has done for them.
[52:09] You don't know what THE LORD HAS DONE
[52:11] FOR ME. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LORD IS
[52:14] ABOUT TO DO FOR YOU THIS MORNING.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:25] HALLELUJAH.
[52:29] You may be seated.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; That's why I said
[52:33] not because he is hidden, he is absent.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Don't mistake God hiding from God being
[52:41] absent. Because those people thought
[52:44] that was just Brother Peter. We know
[52:45] him. We went to school with him. We eat
[52:47] bread with him. We fellowship with him.
[52:49] We went by his house and drink coffee.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; But God was veiled in that man. Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And the lie got called right out.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; We know the story. A casual attitude
[53:03] about God
[53:04] &gt;&gt; is in this message.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; A casual attitude about this me in this
[53:10] message. A casual attitude about God's
[53:12] wrath and God's judgment. And that's why
[53:16] I said last night, the same God that
[53:19] brought out Israel, the same God that
[53:21] killed them, he was angry with them. He
[53:25] tolerated all their issues, their
[53:27] complaints until they get to the
[53:29] promised land. And when they got to the
[53:31] promised land, he said, "Get your best
[53:33] men. Get these ministers. Let them go
[53:36] out. Let them cross over. Let them bring
[53:39] back evidence that I am true. You have a
[53:42] land full of milk and honey." Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want my people to say I
[53:47] am. I want my people to see that I am
[53:50] faithful.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I am true.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; What I say I promise, I am keeping that
[53:55] promise. Go and bring back evidence.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; 10 ministers
[54:01] came back very quickly. They went,
[54:04] they saw the grapes, they saw the land,
[54:06] and they came back very quickly. And
[54:08] their testimony was, "We have seen
[54:10] giants." Now, if you were to interview
[54:13] these men, you saw giants. Did they see
[54:15] you?
[54:18] No. No. No. They didn't see us. And And
[54:22] we can't take it. Watch the effect of
[54:25] that. That negative testimony affected
[54:28] the whole congregation.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; It affected everybody. So negative could
[54:32] affect, negative could destroy, negative
[54:35] could bring judgment. GET AWAY FROM
[54:39] NEGATIVE.
[54:44] HALLELUJAH.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:48] A dark You may be seated. A dark gloomy
[54:52] spirit came over the congregation. The
[54:55] people didn't GO OVER. THE MINISTERS
[54:57] WERE SUPPOSED TO go over and BRING
[55:00] TESTIMONY. THE MINISTERS WERE SUPPOSED
[55:01] TO GIVE a witness of this Holy Ghost,
[55:05] &gt;&gt; OF THIS HOLY GHOST LAND.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE MINISTERS WAS TO
[55:10] GIVE A WITNESS THAT THIS LAND IS REAL.
[55:13] THIS LAND IS TRUE. THIS LAND is
[55:22] &gt;&gt; so the 10 men brought back. The Bible
[55:24] call it an evil report.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; See God doesn't interpret things how we
[55:30] interpreted him.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; God different. You see the man who
[55:34] buried the talent. One had two he
[55:36] produced two. The one that had four
[55:37] produce four. The one that bury it. You
[55:39] know what? God call him a wicked man.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; The same thing you give me Lord. Look at
[55:46] here. For 10 years God give you
[55:48] something and you add nothing to it. You
[55:50] say add to your faith virtue. And to
[55:51] virtue add knowledge. At least put it in
[55:53] the bank to get some interest.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; You take THE MONEY, YOU BURY IT. YOU DID
[55:58] NOTHING WITH IT. GOD GAVE YOU A GIFT.
[56:00] WHAT YOU DOING WITH IT? COME ON, PREACH
[56:01] BACK TO ME. COME ON. GOD GIVE YOU A
[56:03] TALENT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT?
[56:14] CALEB AND JOSHUA,
[56:17] they came back late because they were
[56:19] enjoying the grapes. So Caleb white gong
[56:24] was red,
[56:27] grape juice all over his mouth. He saw
[56:30] giants, that wasn't a problem. That this
[56:32] my land is my land. He saw tall giants,
[56:34] wasn't a problem. This land is my land.
[56:36] I'm eating big grapes this morning. This
[56:38] land, this land is my land. God, give me
[56:41] this land. Oh God, I thank you for
[56:43] giving me this land. This is my land.
[56:46] I'm going to take it. Come on. Come on.
[56:49] Preach back to me. HALLELUJAH.
[56:52] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO
[56:55] TAKE IT.
[56:58] Be seated.
[56:59] These two brothers, Joshua and Caleb,
[57:02] the amazing thing is, Brother Brandham
[57:04] said, these were the only two guys who
[57:07] positionally knew what they were.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; They understood their position.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And when they came back only to meet a
[57:17] negative atmosphere, oh God, you know
[57:19] when somebody depressed your head down.
[57:23] They say, "What happened? What is going
[57:25] on here?" Well, these ministers, you
[57:28] know, they high up in the message, they
[57:30] they long in the message and they say,
[57:32] "We can't take it."
[57:35] &gt;&gt; The irony of this whole thing is this.
[57:37] Caleb was the shortest man in the camp.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know about that?
[57:43] &gt;&gt; This shorty, we call him shorty. Shorty
[57:46] Bum say he took a box cuz he was too
[57:49] short. Nobody would hear him.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; And he stand up on the box
[57:52] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "WE ARE WELLABLE.
[58:02] GOD is amazing.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; This short man
[58:06] &gt;&gt; on a box
[58:07] &gt;&gt; talking about we could take giants.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; He's not the big man in the in the
[58:11] congregation. He's a short guy
[58:13] &gt;&gt; SAYING WE ARE WELL ABLE
[58:15] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE IT.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; They wanted to stone them.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; The people was in such a negative
[58:23] atmosphere. They're ready to fight
[58:25] against truth. FIGHT AGAINST LIGHT. YOU
[58:29] HAVE LIGHT.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET NOBODY STOLE IT.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET NOBODY OUT IT. DON'T LET
[58:36] NOBODY COVER IT.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; WALK IN THAT LIGHT.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:42] You may be seated.
[58:44] Watch the judgment of God now. What's
[58:47] God's judgment? God said only Joshua and
[58:51] Caleb all those people going to die.
[58:55] And for 40 years funeral service after
[58:58] funeral service 40 years Caleb seeing
[59:02] friends and family and this one dying
[59:05] and he's there you know what God was
[59:07] doing waiting for the next generation
[59:11] &gt;&gt; the young people of their generation.
[59:14] Since they were leaving Egypt God know
[59:16] they would fail. So he was looking for
[59:18] every pregnancy. He was looking for the
[59:20] whole generation that being born. Every
[59:21] time God sees somebody pregnant, he say
[59:23] hallelujah because I'm going to keep my
[59:24] word. That generation going to fail, but
[59:26] the next generation will not. You can
[59:28] fail.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. YOU CANNOT FAIL. GOD
[59:33] CALL YOU TO SUCCEED. GOD CALL YOU TO
[59:35] SURVIVE. GOD CALL YOU TO OVERCOME. GOD
[59:38] CALL YOU TO POSSESS. GOD CALL YOU TO
[59:40] FIGHT.
[59:43] COME ON YOU CALEBS. COME ON YOU YOUNG
[59:45] PEOPLE. COME ON YOU JOSHUA.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; We are more than able.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:05] THIS IS OUR LAND. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO IT.
[1:00:08] WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HOLY GHOST. WE HAVE A
[1:00:10] RIGHT TO SIGNS, WONDERS, MIRACLES. THAT
[1:00:14] IS OUR RIGHT. YOU
[1:00:24] may be seated.
[1:00:27] There's a lesson to learn
[1:00:29] from that experience with Joshua and
[1:00:31] Caleb and the giants.
[1:00:34] The giants didn't see them.
[1:00:37] They saw the giants. And that affected
[1:00:40] their fate.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Is what your eyes choose to look on.
[1:00:45] Don't no let no one put limitations on
[1:00:48] you.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Don't let anyone put limitations on
[1:00:53] where God want you to go.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said he want to stop
[1:00:58] great man from entering into the places
[1:01:01] like this
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; talking about the seven thunders. He
[1:01:04] don't want men to step into that
[1:01:06] platform. Don't speak on this. Don't
[1:01:08] talk about this. Don't preach this. No,
[1:01:11] we preach whatever God put on our hearts
[1:01:12] to preach. We say what God put on our
[1:01:15] hearts to say
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FOOLING YOU will not set you
[1:01:21] free.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Tricking you would not set you free. The
[1:01:24] truth is what set you free.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And you have to know the truth. You may
[1:01:31] be seated.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Let me just finish that little piece
[1:01:34] here. When they cross over into the land
[1:01:37] because Kale had three things to do.
[1:01:38] Just three. Not not 16, not seven. Just
[1:01:41] three. cross over, conquer, and divide
[1:01:44] the land. You cannot divide what you
[1:01:46] have not conquered.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; The land wasn't like a binoculars land.
[1:01:50] You're spying. That's 99 line across
[1:01:52] there.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; No. God don't want you to spy. Have a
[1:01:56] long lens and you're looking my mountain
[1:01:59] there. No. He tell Joshua every place
[1:02:01] you put your foot. Not Not every place
[1:02:03] you look.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; You have to put your foot on it. You
[1:02:06] have to put GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU
[1:02:09] HAVE TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT.
[1:02:15] Not because you see it as IT'S YOURS.
[1:02:17] BECAUSE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT. PUT YET
[1:02:20] YOUR FOOT ON IT.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S YOURS.
[1:02:25] You be seated. If you're sick, put your
[1:02:28] foot on healing. I'm the Lord that heal
[1:02:30] thee of thy diseases. Oh, glory to God.
[1:02:33] If your child sick, put your foot on the
[1:02:34] pray. They shall lay hands upon the sick
[1:02:36] and they shall recover.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:02:41] Hallelujah. If you have financial
[1:02:43] trouble, you could put your foot on that
[1:02:45] something. They had to pay taxes. Jesus
[1:02:47] told THEM, "GO GET A FISH." AND THEY HAD
[1:02:49] MONEY. THEY HAD GOLD IN THAT FISH TO PAY
[1:02:51] THE TAXES. GOD COULD GIVE YOU MONEY TO
[1:02:54] PAY WHATEVER YOU NEED TO PAY. WELL, GIVE
[1:02:55] THE LORD A SHOUT. HE IS GOD THAT WILL
[1:02:58] SUPPLY all your needs.
[1:03:04] You may be seated.
[1:03:07] Caleb
[1:03:08] note when they came to the land and they
[1:03:11] conquered the land to divide the land,
[1:03:14] Caleb stepped forward. Note what Caleb
[1:03:17] did. He doesn't look around and say who
[1:03:18] is asking for anything. He wasn't coming
[1:03:21] on behalf of the tribe. He said Joshua
[1:03:24] you know what Moses said about me. And
[1:03:26] if the Lord be with me,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; he's old now.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; He is 80 years old now. Caleb said, "I
[1:03:33] am just as strong as WHEN I FIRST
[1:03:37] STARTED OUT, and if the Lord be with me,
[1:03:40] I SHALL BE ABLE
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; TO DRIVE THEM OUT."
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not even looking for assistance.
[1:03:47] HALLELUJAH. I'M COMING UP.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING UP A MOUNTAIN, AN OLD MAN.
[1:03:56] HALLELUJAH. AN ELDER MAN. HE SAID, "I'M
[1:03:59] COMING UP TO GET YOU, YOU SONS OF
[1:04:02] ANOCH." AND THE BIBLE SAID he expelled
[1:04:04] them.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe seated.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; You know what expel means? You know,
[1:04:10] some people have coffee with the devil.
[1:04:12] They drink. Say, "Satan, could you
[1:04:13] please
[1:04:16] not negotiate with the devil? You know,
[1:04:17] Satan, um, take this lollipop or take
[1:04:20] this chips or something like that. Could
[1:04:22] you could you leave?"
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; No, NO, NO. JES,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; THROW THEM OUT.
[1:04:28] RUN THEM OUT. CAST THEM OUT.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Caleb
[1:04:35] expelled. That's to kick out the boots
[1:04:37] to run them out. Those giants WERE
[1:04:39] RUNNING AND CALEB RUNNING BEHIND THEM.
[1:04:41] GET OUT OF HERE.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I COMMAND every
[1:04:45] foul spirit to LEAVE HERE. I COMMAND
[1:04:47] EVERY SICKNESS TO LEAVE HERE. I COMMAND
[1:04:49] EVERY DISEASE TO DRY UP. WE DRY UP
[1:04:52] TUMOR, CANCER, FEMALE CONDITION,
[1:04:54] WHATEVER YOU HAVE INSIDE OF HERE, WE
[1:04:56] CURSE IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS. OH, GLORY
[1:04:59] TO GOD. LEAVE HERE WHOLE. LEAVE HERE
[1:05:02] WELL. LEAVE HERE HEALED.
[1:05:08] GLORY, GLORY,
[1:05:11] GLORY, GLORY.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:05:16] They cross over. They conquer the land.
[1:05:19] And you know what Caleb said? Give me
[1:05:22] our mountain. No, he wasn't talking
[1:05:24] behalf of no hour. He said, "GIVE ME MY
[1:05:28] MOUNTAIN." GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. Listen
[1:05:30] friends, you have got to take this as an
[1:05:33] individual. You got to possess this as
[1:05:35] an individual. YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT IT'S
[1:05:38] PROMISED TO YOU. THIS HOLY GHOST LAND IS
[1:05:40] PROMISED TO YOU. THIS HOLY GHOST
[1:05:42] REVIVAL, IT'S PROMISED TO YOU. THE
[1:05:44] CEILING.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Come see.
[1:05:56] You may be seated. This angel
[1:06:00] has the power and authority to speak and
[1:06:04] instruct the angels of destruction.
[1:06:08] In Revelation 7, stop the winds. Hold
[1:06:12] it. Hold it. Stop the wars. Hold it. Ask
[1:06:15] some to be sealed.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; And God stopping everything to make sure
[1:06:19] you are sealed.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; God will change governments.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; God will change world system to ensure
[1:06:26] that you are sealed. Brother from the
[1:06:29] preach. Listen to this. The book is
[1:06:33] sealed and you are sealed with the book.
[1:06:37] This book
[1:06:39] has more to do with you than you think.
[1:06:42] A lot of people don't understand that.
[1:06:44] That is why go John represented the
[1:06:46] bride and the voice told John go to the
[1:06:49] angel and say angel you think you think
[1:06:53] I'm worthy to have the book. It didn't
[1:06:56] say that. It says go to the angel and
[1:06:59] say give me
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; the book. Note when the angel said who
[1:07:04] is worthy to take the book when the lamb
[1:07:06] stepped forward the lamb didn't go to
[1:07:08] the throne and said could you give me
[1:07:10] the book please? No, the Bible said the
[1:07:12] lamb went and took the book. That's an
[1:07:14] authority. So when Jesus died from the
[1:07:17] Pentecostal side or the Pentecostal
[1:07:19] version, they said people Jesus died to
[1:07:21] save my soul. What they don't
[1:07:23] understand, Jesus died to get the book.
[1:07:26] His death made the way for him to go and
[1:07:30] take back the book of redemption to call
[1:07:33] you and I.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Because when Adam lost the book, the
[1:07:37] book went back in the hands of the
[1:07:38] original owner. God himself kept the
[1:07:41] book waiting for this last day. Here's
[1:07:44] Genesis on this side here. The book went
[1:07:46] up and here is the last day the book
[1:07:48] have to come back down.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. So God have
[1:07:52] to have a prophet on the earth and
[1:07:54] Revelation 10 said, "I saw another
[1:07:56] mighty angel come down from heaven with
[1:07:59] the book open and with this open book,
[1:08:01] seven thunders, throw their voices out."
[1:08:04] Now seven thunders is the only exclusive
[1:08:06] bride promise. The seven thunders
[1:08:08] gathers the bride together. The seven
[1:08:10] THUNDERS GIVE THE BRIDE FAITH. THE SEVEN
[1:08:12] THUNDERS IS THE BRIDE REVIVAL. THE SEVEN
[1:08:14] THUNDERS SHOW HOW TO PREPARE. OH, GLORY
[1:08:16] TO GOD. THE SEVEN THUNDERS IS FOR THE
[1:08:19] BRIDE.
[1:08:21] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. NOBODY ELSE.
[1:08:25] THAT'S BRIDE STUFF. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S
[1:08:28] BRIDE WORD. THAT IS PRIDE REVELATION. WE
[1:08:31] CAN'T DENY IT BECAUSE WE WILL DENY
[1:08:33] OURSELVES. THAT'S OUR NAME. THAT'S THE
[1:08:36] COVENANT. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE SEALED WITH
[1:08:39] THE BOOK.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:45] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So listen, you may be
[1:08:50] seated. 1946,
[1:08:53] steal an angel came down. The angel of
[1:08:55] the Lord came down upon the earth to
[1:08:57] give the prophet three pulls by which to
[1:09:00] call a bride. first pull, second pull,
[1:09:04] the third pull was to get that bride.
[1:09:07] And he said the when the bride is taken
[1:09:10] up, he says the dragon will make war
[1:09:14] with the remnant of the woman's seed.
[1:09:16] That's the scriptures. And that remnant
[1:09:18] of the woman's seed, he said here in
[1:09:20] question and answers 1954, that remnant
[1:09:23] is the sanctified church without
[1:09:26] receiving the Holy Ghost, the ones you
[1:09:28] make war with. So in this message going
[1:09:31] to be nice message people sanctified
[1:09:34] people without the Holy Ghost. That is
[1:09:38] who the devil will go after because the
[1:09:40] devil will be so upset he missed the
[1:09:42] bride.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; He lost this bride. He'll be angry and
[1:09:46] he'll be going after church members. But
[1:09:49] the Brandham said this here are the ones
[1:09:52] that is sanctified and refuse to get the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost. the church, the Roman
[1:09:57] church, and them will persecute them.
[1:10:00] But the bride is already raptured in
[1:10:03] heaven.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; So the 144,000 are Jews, God's servants.
[1:10:08] And when the Holy Ghost is preached to
[1:10:10] them, here we go. And they receive the
[1:10:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Just exactly
[1:10:15] like they did at the beginning. What is
[1:10:17] he speaking about?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; When I believe the message, I have the
[1:10:20] Holy Ghost. That's Baptist doctrine.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; That is not what they had in the
[1:10:23] beginning.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Watch something. People said
[1:10:27] they use a quote the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:30] Ghost is not the real thing because you
[1:10:32] could have the baptism 24 hours and say
[1:10:34] be lost. The question that should be
[1:10:36] asked baptize where
[1:10:40] you could be baptized in your flesh. You
[1:10:43] could be baptized in your spirit or you
[1:10:45] could be baptized in your soul. So some
[1:10:47] people say that Peter had the seed in
[1:10:50] the soul or how brother say the seed in
[1:10:54] the soul is the real thing. So Peter had
[1:10:56] the seed in the soul. He could have said
[1:10:58] I don't need the Holy Ghost. I have the
[1:11:00] seed in the soul. I am brother Peter. I
[1:11:03] have revelation.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; But guess what?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; He was going to have no power. The whole
[1:11:10] understanding, the whole vision that
[1:11:13] Jesus presented to them in his
[1:11:15] postresurrection ministry was to get
[1:11:18] them to the upper room. He called it the
[1:11:20] promise of my father. Behold, I send the
[1:11:24] promise of my father upon you. Try in
[1:11:28] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:11:31] endued with power from on high.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Let's back up a little bit. These
[1:11:36] ministers or brothers or believers, they
[1:11:39] shared in Jesus ministry, but they did
[1:11:42] not have the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; They did signs and wonders and cast out
[1:11:46] devils, but they did not have the Holy
[1:11:48] Ghost. To work with Jesus, he gave them
[1:11:50] an anointing to work with him. But when
[1:11:55] he came to this postresurrection
[1:11:57] ministry, he told them, "Stop preaching
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; because the promise is not to be around
[1:12:02] you or over you. The promise is to be in
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; at that day.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; You shall know. I'm in the father. The
[1:12:11] father in you. I in you. You in me.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; So he was telling them if I don't go the
[1:12:17] comforter will not come. I have to go
[1:12:20] for the comforter to come. You may be
[1:12:22] seated. Note that when Jesus died,
[1:12:26] disciples were in tears. They were
[1:12:28] worried. They was depressed and sad. But
[1:12:31] when he opened the word to them and
[1:12:33] opened their understanding, no more
[1:12:35] tears, no more worry. Jesus is taken up
[1:12:38] and they're saying bye-bye. Bye-bye,
[1:12:40] Jesus. Because now what? The heart
[1:12:41] filled with joy. They said they return
[1:12:43] to Jerusalem not with a smile with great
[1:12:45] joy. That's different. Smile and joy is
[1:12:47] two different thing. Smile, you can
[1:12:49] smile, you get a new car, smile, you got
[1:12:50] to raise a pay, smile because you have a
[1:12:53] baby, whatever. Smile. That's smiling.
[1:12:55] But joy, that's different.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; That that is very contagious.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Great joy. And they were ra praising God
[1:13:01] on Fridays. No, continually every
[1:13:04] service, hands up in the air. The pastor
[1:13:06] was a beggar to praise God. They were
[1:13:08] worshiping a revelation. They were
[1:13:09] worshiping under expectation. They were
[1:13:11] worshiping because they were expecting a
[1:13:13] manifestation.
[1:13:15] You may be seated. So revelation brings
[1:13:18] you under expectation.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; So that's why people sit in church
[1:13:23] quiet.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They have no revelation. Revelation
[1:13:26] brings simulation. Do you know
[1:13:27] revelation is wine?
[1:13:30] This is water here, right? This guy get
[1:13:33] it drunk, you know. But you see wine.
[1:13:36] You ever see somebody drinking wine and
[1:13:38] the the car walk straight
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; because they have wine. You know Jesus
[1:13:42] turned water into wine.
[1:13:44] The same word that you're hearing, God
[1:13:47] could turn it into revelation.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It will give you a
[1:13:50] stimulation.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; I've never seen that. Wow. Look at that.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But Abraham says when it hit him, he run
[1:13:57] a tree. He run around the car. Why?
[1:13:59] Revelation is striking. Revelation is
[1:14:01] wine. Hallelujah. And Jesus said, you
[1:14:04] cannot take new wine and put it in old
[1:14:07] bottles. It wasn't the physical bottle
[1:14:09] like this. It was a wine skin. It was
[1:14:12] animal skin. And if it skin is too hard,
[1:14:14] the wine will pop and purse because the
[1:14:16] wine have energy in it. The wine does
[1:14:18] bubble. The wine does expand. So you
[1:14:20] have to have oil in your skin.
[1:14:22] Hallelujah. You have to have new skin. I
[1:14:24] trust this morning we have some new
[1:14:26] skins inside of here because this thing
[1:14:28] GOING TO BUBBLE. THIS THING GOING TO
[1:14:30] BURST. THIS THING GOING TO EXPLODE. This
[1:14:32] thing is the Holy Ghost. It's the Holy
[1:14:34] Ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive
[1:14:38] keeping me alive keeping me alive. It's
[1:14:41] the Holy Ghost and fire. Oh, glory to
[1:14:43] God.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; See this old man run up and down.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; I was 17 years old when God called me
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; and the fire is still there.
[1:14:55] Hallelujah.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; The devil didn't start it and the devil
[1:15:00] can put it out.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. I AM JUST AS
[1:15:04] STRONG AS WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT.
[1:15:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Praise God. So
[1:15:11] this Holy Ghost, 140,000, they going to
[1:15:15] receive the Holy Ghost like in the
[1:15:16] beginning. Then he said these words, the
[1:15:18] Gentile church is finished. The church
[1:15:21] is sealed away. The rapture is come. The
[1:15:24] gospel has been preached. You don't hear
[1:15:27] no more crying, no more groaning, no
[1:15:30] more sign for the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:32] Spirit. These are the prophet's word.
[1:15:34] People talking all kind of mysteries,
[1:15:36] all kind of revelations, but they're not
[1:15:37] crying
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And yet he says, God give the Holy Ghost
[1:15:42] to them that ask.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Now, the Jews have got
[1:15:46] to receive the Holy Ghost and be
[1:15:48] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:15:50] along. And the gentile church, watch.
[1:15:53] And as soon, here we go. As the Holy
[1:15:55] Ghost is presented to them, they receive
[1:15:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:16:00] Gentile church is raptured. And those
[1:16:02] who refused and just walked under
[1:16:05] justification, the dragon, the Roman
[1:16:08] power, which this is something I never
[1:16:11] saw before, the Roman power spurts the
[1:16:13] water, which will unite with communism.
[1:16:17] That one blew my mind. and take the
[1:16:20] church into persecution. He is saying
[1:16:22] the Roman power will unite with
[1:16:25] communism and take the church into
[1:16:28] persecution. The gospel goes back to the
[1:16:30] Jews.
[1:16:32] 144,000 into the kingdom of God will be
[1:16:35] sealed by the sealing angel.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Wait, brother O, there is something
[1:16:41] called the sealing angel. Yes, the angel
[1:16:44] from the east. The angel in Ezekiel 9.
[1:16:48] The ceiling angel is the same one with
[1:16:50] the inkorn writer.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; So as soon as that sealing angel
[1:17:00] here we go begins to seal that 144,000
[1:17:05] the gentile church door is closed.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; So where are we at now?
[1:17:13] We are coming down to the fullness of
[1:17:15] the Gentiles or until the times of the
[1:17:18] Gentiles be fulfilled. We are coming
[1:17:20] down to Daniel's vision and prophecy of
[1:17:24] the stone cut out without hands where
[1:17:26] the kingdoms of man fell and then the
[1:17:29] kingdom of God established on the earth.
[1:17:30] We are coming down to the finishing
[1:17:32] listen of the seventh seal.
[1:17:36] That's where we coming down to the
[1:17:38] finishing of the seventh seal. Now you
[1:17:40] cannot go back into history. first seal,
[1:17:42] second seal, third seal and whatnot. The
[1:17:45] sixth seal is judgment. The fifth seal
[1:17:47] is Jews, souls under the altar. So we
[1:17:49] have to have a connecting seal that
[1:17:51] speaks of us. And our connecting seal is
[1:17:54] the seventh seal. That seal under they
[1:17:58] have the seven thunders all connected to
[1:18:00] the bride. The seven thunders not from a
[1:18:02] man. The seven thunders you find that
[1:18:04] written in revelation 10. Christ himself
[1:18:07] come down with those seven thunders. So
[1:18:10] seven telling on a man it's God himself.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind those voices.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind God speaking
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; because when God speak something about
[1:18:19] to take place is not man speaking. It's
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; God speaking.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham. What is the Holy
[1:18:26] Ghost? The Holy Ghost is your assurance.
[1:18:27] It's your protection. It's your witness.
[1:18:30] It's your seal. It's your sign that I am
[1:18:33] heaven bound.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; What the Holy Ghost is, you should want
[1:18:37] it. I couldn't go on without it.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brown, let us pray. He
[1:18:43] said, "Blessed heavenly father, tonight
[1:18:45] at the beginning of this revival, our
[1:18:48] time was swept up here tonight at these
[1:18:50] as 20 hands went up in the building and
[1:18:52] they needed, oh Lord, it's their souls.
[1:18:55] The spirit he's praying the oil is just
[1:19:00] about burnt out. There won't be much
[1:19:03] more. When that last drop is gone from
[1:19:07] the bucket or the container,
[1:19:10] there will be no more oil put in lamps.
[1:19:13] They realize that in the last days,
[1:19:16] there's not a hope on earth for outside
[1:19:19] of Christ. I pray tonight Lord that
[1:19:21] somehow in the somnness of this moment
[1:19:24] the solemnity that you will now send the
[1:19:27] Holy Spirit that made them raise their
[1:19:29] hands and save them from a life of sin.
[1:19:32] So the prophet described it as a bucket
[1:19:35] who the oil is going down and one of
[1:19:38] these days there'll be no more oil in
[1:19:41] the bucket or the container. Then in the
[1:19:44] date of Christ, he said these people who
[1:19:46] are formal in these formal churches is
[1:19:48] rising up against the move. And that
[1:19:51] move he's talking about, brother
[1:19:52] Stephanos, is a holy ghost move. He said
[1:19:54] they are taking their stand. Communism
[1:19:56] taking their stand. Now watch. And I'm
[1:19:59] seeing he said and that the church has
[1:20:01] taken a stand. I mean the Holy Ghost
[1:20:03] church. Now that's all I'm interested in
[1:20:07] friends. When I'm here out there, I'll
[1:20:09] pray for the sick. But in here I'm
[1:20:11] interested in one thing. I am not
[1:20:14] interested in bylaws and deacons and so
[1:20:16] forth or orders of the church. I am
[1:20:19] interested in the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:21] Ghost upon the church for this day that
[1:20:24] we are living in.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; So the prophet himself was interested in
[1:20:28] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; upon the people.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The seal of God is the
[1:20:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And all that
[1:20:38] was not sealed by the Holy Spirit took
[1:20:40] the mark of the beast. So don't get
[1:20:42] worried about am I going to take the
[1:20:43] mark of the beast or the mark of the
[1:20:44] beast. No. Understand this. If you get
[1:20:46] the seal of God, mark can't touch you.
[1:20:48] You're free from that.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost. Forget the mark of
[1:20:53] the beast. All that was not sealed by
[1:20:56] the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Not some. All.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; The devil deceived all except
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; those names written in the Lamb's book
[1:21:04] of life. He deceived bishops, popes,
[1:21:07] doctors, lawyers, prime ministers,
[1:21:09] everyone on the earth except. So if you
[1:21:11] are one of those whose names are on the
[1:21:13] book, you have to be praising God this
[1:21:14] morning, thanking God for this
[1:21:16] opportunity to hear what you hear and
[1:21:18] see what you see. Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Watch the mark of the beast. What it is
[1:21:24] is rejecting the Holy Spirit. Here we
[1:21:26] go.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Jubilee year. When the year of Jubilee,
[1:21:30] so there a prophecy, a freedom time
[1:21:32] coming, a jubilee time coming. When the
[1:21:35] year of Jubilee or the blast comes, the
[1:21:38] people are receiving the Holy Spirit and
[1:21:40] you willfully turn it down. God is not
[1:21:43] under any more obligation to speak to
[1:21:45] you anymore. You are marked off to
[1:21:48] reject Christ to turn him down. He
[1:21:50] knocked on your door. You're in the
[1:21:52] danger line of being bored in the air.
[1:21:55] So if the seed of God is the Holy Ghost,
[1:21:57] then without the Holy Ghost is the mark
[1:21:59] of the beast. Note, he's not talking
[1:22:01] about who have books, who have tapes,
[1:22:04] who listen to message, who put the Bible
[1:22:06] under the head and sleep in it like a
[1:22:07] pillow, or who make a hat out of the
[1:22:08] Bible and make a Bible hat and say
[1:22:10] you're wearing the word, who put the
[1:22:12] Bible and quote all over your chest all
[1:22:14] about. I am not talking about that the
[1:22:16] devil coming for you. Mark of the beast
[1:22:18] coming for you. You got to get the Holy
[1:22:20] Ghost.
[1:22:22] We have got to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Watch. If the seal of God is the Holy
[1:22:31] Ghost, then without the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:32] the mark of the beast. And the Bible
[1:22:34] says that the two spirits be so close it
[1:22:37] would deceive the very elect of
[1:22:39] possible. Now we know,
[1:22:42] listen to this now. How we how we going?
[1:22:45] All the ones that were in captivity
[1:22:47] didn't have to pay a price. So if you
[1:22:49] were enslaved in captivity and that
[1:22:51] jubilee comes, you could go free. You
[1:22:54] don't have to do anything. You don't
[1:22:55] have to pay a price. You don't No. God's
[1:22:57] provided grace was the jubilee that with
[1:23:00] the gospel. So no. So you understand
[1:23:02] what Jesus did with the woman at the
[1:23:03] well. Do you understand what Jesus did
[1:23:05] with the woman in adultery? He freed
[1:23:07] them. You know, as I told him in France,
[1:23:10] when he spoke to one of well, she had
[1:23:12] five and the one she live in wasn't
[1:23:13] hers. He didn't come to address that
[1:23:15] issue. You know, he didn't come and say,
[1:23:16] "How much man you living with? how much
[1:23:18] boyfriend you had and no he didn't come
[1:23:19] to talk about that you know he came to
[1:23:21] call her name in the book
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; that was his issue
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; she don't know who she is
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; because when you don't know who you are
[1:23:29] you live anyway
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; you do anything you want but if you get
[1:23:33] to know who you are you're raised to a
[1:23:35] higher level
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; so he came to free her from her past
[1:23:41] free her from her present free her to
[1:23:44] see so when she ran and said COME SEE A
[1:23:46] MAN oh gosh another She said, "No, not
[1:23:49] that kind of one. There's a perfect one.
[1:23:52] There's a different one." Hallelujah.
[1:23:54] This one spoke life to me.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a praise.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When Jesus come, things are
[1:24:02] different.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS COMES, LIVES ARE CHANGED.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; So once, so watch. If the person didn't
[1:24:13] want to go free,
[1:24:15] he says that would be compared to the
[1:24:17] mark of the beast. They take them and
[1:24:19] put a thing in the air and that was to
[1:24:22] remain bound forever. He said now when
[1:24:24] you hear the jubilee sound and if you
[1:24:26] didn't want to go free then he had to be
[1:24:28] sealed. And today when men and women
[1:24:30] hear this marvelous gospel of the Lord
[1:24:33] Jesus Christ and the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:35] Ghost, you have to make a choice. So if
[1:24:38] people want to be content that their
[1:24:40] pastor is the best thing after sliced
[1:24:42] bread or their pastor is the best thing
[1:24:43] in the world and they believe that they
[1:24:45] in the right church and the only church
[1:24:48] and they can't leave that church. They
[1:24:49] have to leave the church. Some of them
[1:24:50] you know they have to leave because the
[1:24:53] churches have built walls. They have
[1:24:55] built cemeteries and walls. Dead people
[1:24:58] inside of there. Just wall them up
[1:24:59] inside of there. Some of them can't hear
[1:25:01] the Jubilee trumpet. But there are
[1:25:03] people the spirit of God will go out
[1:25:05] right here in Germany. right here from
[1:25:07] this tabernacle around the world. The
[1:25:09] spirit of God will go out and call from
[1:25:11] the east and the west and the north and
[1:25:12] the south. The people will hear the
[1:25:14] voice of the spirit. He said the bride
[1:25:16] will follow the spirit wherever the
[1:25:18] spirit is. Wherever the spirit leads,
[1:25:20] the bride will follow the spirit. Not a
[1:25:22] man, but the spirit of God. Oh,
[1:25:24] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I feel the
[1:25:27] spirit here right now. When there was
[1:25:28] chaos all over the earth, you know what
[1:25:30] God did? God didn't argue with chaos.
[1:25:32] God didn't say chaos, how long you
[1:25:34] chaos?
[1:25:35] How long you in trouble? How long is
[1:25:37] darkness? He just said, "Let there be
[1:25:39] light." He addressed the chaos with the
[1:25:41] word. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:25:44] Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] God spoke to chaos and and there was
[1:25:50] light. Oh, h no argument. We're not
[1:25:53] going to argue with darkness. We're
[1:25:54] going to say, "Let there be light." Oh,
[1:25:56] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[1:26:00] seated, brother. From fellowship by
[1:26:02] redemption. When the ceiling angel
[1:26:06] crossed through the country, he was
[1:26:08] commanded to put a mark upon those who
[1:26:11] sign and cry for their permission down
[1:26:13] the city. I say this with reverence now
[1:26:16] and with respect. Don't get mad at me,
[1:26:19] angry rather. But if the sealing angel
[1:26:23] crossed this nation today, where would
[1:26:26] he find men so deeply consecrated to God
[1:26:30] for the sins of this crumbling nation?
[1:26:32] till they cry day and night. Where would
[1:26:34] he mark the church that fast and pray?
[1:26:38] Lord Jesus, where would he find that
[1:26:40] person? The message will have become
[1:26:42] content. They have become satisfied. And
[1:26:46] worse than that, they have become
[1:26:47] entitled. Now, when you get entitled or
[1:26:50] get an entitled spirit, you feel you
[1:26:52] don't have to work for it. You don't
[1:26:54] have to earn anything because you are
[1:26:56] dear. You are entitled to the rapture.
[1:26:58] You entitled to the coming of the Lord.
[1:27:00] You are entitled. That is wrong.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; You know what you're entitled to do?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You're entitled to fight.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That is what you're entitled to fight.
[1:27:12] Because God sets it up that way that you
[1:27:14] have to fight. Listen for what you know
[1:27:16] is your own.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Right. Write with me now. Come ride with
[1:27:24] me now. You have to fight
[1:27:26] for what you know is your own. So the
[1:27:31] revelation of the word come to reveal
[1:27:33] what is your own.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And the prophet say I claim my healing
[1:27:37] that's mine. I claim joy that's mine. I
[1:27:40] don't claim depression. That's mine.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; I don't claim frustration. That's not
[1:27:45] mine. I claim deliverance. That's mine.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I claim a Holy Ghost baptism. That's
[1:27:51] mine.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What you doing? You're
[1:27:54] making claims. You are fighting for your
[1:27:56] portion. You are fighting for your life.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:04] You may be seated. The woman whose
[1:28:06] daughter was vexed with the devil and
[1:28:08] Jesus say not fit to take the ter bread
[1:28:10] and cast it a dog. She knew this and
[1:28:12] Pharisees can't help her. They can't do
[1:28:13] no nothing. They can't heal. They can't
[1:28:15] cast out devils. So she stood there and
[1:28:17] she be to think what he's saying. Oh, he
[1:28:20] called me a dog. Then she said, "What
[1:28:22] does the dog see?" She see the dog. She
[1:28:24] see the dog eating the crumbs. So she
[1:28:26] said, "Ah," she said, "Lord, even the
[1:28:28] dog eat crumbs." Jesus said, "Go that
[1:28:30] woman. Your daughter is here. I I I
[1:28:32] can't. This is too much for me. Go go
[1:28:33] go. This is too much for me."
[1:28:37] The centurion,
[1:28:39] he did the same thing. Lord, come. Uh,
[1:28:42] don't come under my roof. Let's speak
[1:28:43] the word and my servant shall be healed.
[1:28:45] You know what Jesus said? I never even
[1:28:47] see faith like that in all of Israel.
[1:28:48] That was a gentile.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That was like you and I. He said, "I
[1:28:52] have never seen faith like that." Just
[1:28:54] speak the word because I recognize you
[1:28:56] are under authority. Hallelujah. I
[1:28:59] RECOGNIZE YOU are a man under authority.
[1:29:01] You are not all the man. You are under
[1:29:03] authority of your father. And you have
[1:29:05] authority when you're under authority.
[1:29:07] Oh, give the Lord A SHOUT. THAT'S WHY
[1:29:09] brother Brandham
[1:29:14] this is good. That is why when brother
[1:29:15] banham say I don't know if he come I
[1:29:17] don't know if he's here and he say he is
[1:29:18] here. And once he say that he recognized
[1:29:21] that he's under authority now. He said I
[1:29:22] take every spirit not brother he know
[1:29:24] the person who authorized him is there.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; So he said I take every spirit under my
[1:29:29] control cuz that's what God want him to
[1:29:31] do. Oh glory to God.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Brother can tell the angel do it do it.
[1:29:35] He has to do it. He has to say I take
[1:29:37] every spirit under my control. And then
[1:29:39] the angel will be there to energize him
[1:29:41] TO ANOINT HIM TO INSPIRE HIM TO SPEAK.
[1:29:46] may be seated.
[1:29:48] Brother Brandham, look at here. That
[1:29:50] inkorn marker, that inkorn writer, that
[1:29:53] marker, Brother Brandham, see was none
[1:29:55] other than the Holy Spirit. So get
[1:29:57] something, the sealing angel, the ink on
[1:30:01] writer and the Holy Spirit is the same
[1:30:04] person.
[1:30:06] The sealing angel. He says, "Notice, if
[1:30:09] he come to Jessville tonight to the
[1:30:12] Brinham tabernacle or to any other
[1:30:15] tabernacle in the city or in the church,
[1:30:17] who would he put a mark upon?"
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Who is so sincere and so honest before
[1:30:23] God that the weapon cry day and night?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; So the inkan writer is the ceiling angel
[1:30:30] is the Holy Spirit. People reject the
[1:30:32] Holy Spirit in this message because they
[1:30:34] don't want the Holy Ghost to lead them.
[1:30:36] They want to lead themselves. They have
[1:30:38] their own thoughts about ideas and so
[1:30:40] on. God let badam get lost
[1:30:44] in in the forest wherever it was to show
[1:30:47] bad brotherham I am your guide.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; But Brana was a natural guide guiding
[1:30:52] people. He knew how to survive. But God
[1:30:54] make sure he came to an experience where
[1:30:57] he understood he was lost. He made a
[1:31:00] circle and come right back. The Indian
[1:31:02] call it the death walk. You make a
[1:31:04] circle and find yourself back in the
[1:31:06] same position he was in. You're not
[1:31:07] going anywhere. And he had was to
[1:31:10] confess, "Lord, I am no guide."
[1:31:14] So he couldn't rely on the human element
[1:31:17] of his ability to lead himself out of
[1:31:20] what he was in. God had us to show him
[1:31:24] what to do and God led him. He saw the
[1:31:26] tower and he got out and so like that.
[1:31:28] But what I want to show you is this.
[1:31:29] Even in his natural gift and ability as
[1:31:33] a guide, God stripped that
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; that he wouldn't have the confidence.
[1:31:37] Hey, I'm a guide. I know my dad can
[1:31:39] north, south, look up the sky and all
[1:31:41] that time you have a
[1:31:44] we call a compass right now. All of that
[1:31:46] failed because God want to introduce
[1:31:48] himself as the guide. And then brother
[1:31:51] Brandon preached that on a message
[1:31:52] called a guide and he said how the Holy
[1:31:55] Ghost ought to guide us to a wonderful
[1:31:58] glorious baptism.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; That is where it's supposed to take the
[1:32:01] church.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; 50 years of mysteries. How much how much
[1:32:04] more we could talk about mysteries.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Sometime preachers preach and it's so
[1:32:08] mysterious you scratch your head. You
[1:32:10] don't even know what you have to find
[1:32:11] out afterwards what the man say.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; That is not how it's supposed to be.
[1:32:16] Yes.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Every time the vision supposed to be
[1:32:19] clearer and clearer.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; God loves clarity.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Because God was so mysterious, he had a
[1:32:30] problem. How do I reveal myself when I
[1:32:34] am so mysterious?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; So that is how he revealed himself in
[1:32:37] Christ.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to get an idea of who
[1:32:41] I am, what I'm about.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Understand this. When they came out of
[1:32:45] Egypt, God told Moses, "Bring them to
[1:32:47] this mountain. Those people don't know
[1:32:49] me.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I know you. I call you. I spoke to you.
[1:32:53] I sent you to deliver them, but they
[1:32:55] don't know me. Bring them that I may
[1:32:57] reveal myself to them."
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; So when Moses brought them out by the
[1:33:02] mountain and Moses went up to get the
[1:33:03] commandments, the people start to dance
[1:33:05] and party and drink and carry on.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; That's a human element. These are the
[1:33:10] same people that deliver me. Oh Jesus,
[1:33:13] I'll deliver me. He deliver you and then
[1:33:14] what?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; He call you out and then what? That's
[1:33:18] the problem in the message. People come
[1:33:19] out but they haven't gone in.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Redemption is in two parts.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Coming out of and going in. You can't
[1:33:25] just be happy just to come out. You come
[1:33:27] out a Baptist. You come out a Catholic.
[1:33:28] You come out a Lutheran. You come out of
[1:33:30] this church and that church or that
[1:33:31] group. But you have to go into the
[1:33:32] promised land.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; You can't build any house on the
[1:33:38] journey.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; The journey is the journey. you could
[1:33:43] build on your land.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; God fed them with mana AND BREAD. GOD
[1:33:47] FED THEM WITH THIS ON THE JOURNEY.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And right now we are journeying to a
[1:33:51] promised land. Our land is adoption. Our
[1:33:53] land is perfection. Our land is the Holy
[1:33:55] Ghost itself.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR LAND.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; WE ARE STILL JOURNEYING
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN'T GET TIRED.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Remember, each day ends
[1:34:10] a generation.
[1:34:13] Each day ends a 40-year period from some
[1:34:15] for somebody.
[1:34:17] Each day, here we go. So many is sealed
[1:34:20] away into the kingdom.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; One day that last day would arise.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; But is this just a quote or this is
[1:34:28] real? Every day close a generation.
[1:34:32] Every day somebody being sealed. Right
[1:34:33] now somewhere past the world, God is
[1:34:34] sealing somebody. It could be you this
[1:34:37] morning.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; God could seal you.
[1:34:39] He said, "Don't you rest there night
[1:34:41] until that quickening power has brought
[1:34:43] you from the things of the world into
[1:34:45] the kingdom of God." And you are truly
[1:34:48] brought into the kingdom of God and
[1:34:50] quickened by the spirit of God. How
[1:34:52] happy with tears of joy we should be on
[1:34:54] our knees day and night thanking God for
[1:34:56] what he has done. Now, the reason, this
[1:34:58] is a bomb here, the reason the Virgin
[1:35:01] Mary had to go up at the day of
[1:35:03] Pentecost and receive the baptism of the
[1:35:06] Holy Ghost just like the rest of them
[1:35:09] did because she was born here as a
[1:35:11] mortal
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and had to be born again before she
[1:35:16] could go to heaven.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; So, Mary couldn't rely on I'm the mother
[1:35:21] of Christ. Are you mother Mary? No.
[1:35:24] Upper room. Yes.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Do you see how vain it is in the message
[1:35:28] now that people feel that entitled?
[1:35:31] People feel that because they believe
[1:35:32] the books or they press play and they
[1:35:34] have the tapes and they had no all of
[1:35:36] that it entitled them. That is not
[1:35:38] right.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Luke 17:30
[1:35:44] was the son of man been revealed. Luke
[1:35:47] 18 right after that Jesus asked the
[1:35:48] question when the son of man cometh
[1:35:50] shall he find faith on the earth?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Look, look, Luke 17, son of man
[1:35:54] revealed himself. Luke, Luke 18, when
[1:35:57] the son of man cometh, will he find
[1:35:59] faith in the earth or will they out that
[1:36:02] fate? We have to say he will in my
[1:36:04] heart,
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; he will. You're going to find here in
[1:36:06] Germany, he will. He'll find it in you.
[1:36:08] You are the one to answer that question.
[1:36:11] When the son of man cometh, if you're
[1:36:12] going to find faith on the earth,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; oh, praise God. So Mary had us to go up
[1:36:17] in the upper room because she's a
[1:36:19] mortal. She had to be born again
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; by the spirit.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; There's some question and answers. Mary
[1:36:27] Magdalene didn't realize the spirit that
[1:36:29] was on her. Now, when you kind of get
[1:36:32] that spirit on you, men, you get out
[1:36:35] here start lusting for women. You say
[1:36:37] it's human nature. Not like that. It's a
[1:36:39] spirit. The Bible said is a spirit. So,
[1:36:42] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you
[1:36:44] from lust and passion called
[1:36:47] sanctification. Now the word
[1:36:49] sanctification means to be cleansed and
[1:36:51] set aside for service. Now that lost
[1:36:54] spirit leaves you under sanctification.
[1:36:58] Let a little lady goes to church. She
[1:37:00] sings in the choir. She has to mow her
[1:37:02] grass. She a little a short song. Let
[1:37:04] her get sanctified one time and put her
[1:37:06] on. Here we go. Listen prophet going
[1:37:09] deep. You are not sealed by
[1:37:11] sanctification.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; So you see what he did there? He show
[1:37:15] you could lose lust under
[1:37:16] sanctification. You could stop wearing
[1:37:17] shorts under the sanctification, but
[1:37:19] you're not sealed under sanctification.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; And yet, you're more Christian-like.
[1:37:23] You're behaving yourself. You come to
[1:37:25] church, you're worshiping,
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; but you are not sealed by
[1:37:28] sanctification. You are sealed by the
[1:37:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; So, just as you are baptized in water,
[1:37:38] the preacher take you and dip you down
[1:37:40] and come back up. God will take you and
[1:37:41] dip you in the spirit and take you back
[1:37:43] up. Yes,
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; you are baptized
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; A ceiling is the completing of the work.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; It has been the Holy Spirit all along. A
[1:37:54] portion of the Holy Spirit. All right.
[1:37:56] So, Luther had a portion of it. Wesley
[1:37:58] had a portion of it. We have a greater
[1:37:59] measure. But the true bride, here we go,
[1:38:02] will be made up of thousands time
[1:38:04] thousands of people. It will be the
[1:38:07] elect of every age. Every time a message
[1:38:10] went forth and the people believed it
[1:38:13] and accepted it or the light it was,
[1:38:15] then they were sealed away until the day
[1:38:18] of redemption. So this sealing we
[1:38:20] talking about is not new. It's not now.
[1:38:22] In every age, the people were sealed
[1:38:24] away.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Seal angel came and sealed them under
[1:38:27] justification, seal them under
[1:38:28] sanctification. It was a measure of the
[1:38:30] Holy Ghost. And now we have to seal you
[1:38:32] with the token itself. We have to have
[1:38:34] the literal life of Jesus Christ. I've
[1:38:37] been going to that. Praise the name of
[1:38:38] the Lord.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus died, brother Abraham says
[1:38:41] his soul was his spirit ascended into
[1:38:43] hell. God put his body in the right hand
[1:38:46] of glory and sent back, here we go, the
[1:38:48] Holy Ghost as a covenant. Don't fall
[1:38:51] short of that, brother. Without the
[1:38:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit, you are
[1:38:54] lost. But if the spirit of God is in
[1:38:56] there, the spirit of God will unhinge
[1:38:58] those doors. His soul, Jesus soul
[1:39:01] returned back in the form of the baptism
[1:39:03] of the Holy Ghost that comes into every
[1:39:05] believer to sanctify, clean up the mind,
[1:39:09] clean up the heart and leave a portion
[1:39:11] of the Holy Ghost in there. So when the
[1:39:13] Holy Ghost sweeps through you, clean up
[1:39:14] your mind, clean up your heart and
[1:39:16] leave, leave, he call it a little light
[1:39:18] in you like a button.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And as you die out to yourself, that
[1:39:22] button expands. As you die out of
[1:39:25] jealousy and envy, the more you die out,
[1:39:27] the more that little light in you expand
[1:39:29] until it expands through your whole
[1:39:31] body. You are filled with the Holy
[1:39:33] Ghost. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] Hallelujah.
[1:39:40] Praise God. Praise God. So you had seven
[1:39:42] golden candlesticks, a rainbow, a
[1:39:44] covenant that God made through Abraham,
[1:39:46] through Isaac, through Christ, through
[1:39:49] the church by the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:51] Ghost. The robe of seven colors that was
[1:39:55] upon Joseph
[1:39:57] that was upon Jesus is upon the church
[1:40:00] today.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He call it the robe of seven colors. It
[1:40:03] was upon Joseph. He was perfection. It
[1:40:06] was upon Jesus. He was the perfect one.
[1:40:08] Is upon the church today.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; That robe is the common cover you're
[1:40:12] being.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; That's your wedding garment. That's the
[1:40:15] Holy Ghost all around you. Oh, give the
[1:40:17] Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:40:21] All right.
[1:40:23] We on the home stretch brotherham but
[1:40:25] Judas Judas preached with them but when
[1:40:28] it come to Pentecost to receive the
[1:40:30] baptis of the Holy Ghost he refused it
[1:40:33] and betrayed Christ that was the
[1:40:35] antichrist and the spirit today will
[1:40:38] come right down and teach justification
[1:40:40] by faith and everything move right on up
[1:40:42] to the bapts.
[1:40:45] So Judas show his colors by not
[1:40:48] receiving the Holy Ghost. He didn't go
[1:40:50] in the upper room. He made it all into
[1:40:52] Christ ministry and he avoided and
[1:40:55] bypassed the upper room. That's how he
[1:40:57] end up betraying Jesus. You said,
[1:40:59] "Brother Brandham, I don't go to dances.
[1:41:01] I don't go to shows." That's the moral
[1:41:03] thing. Unless there have been a
[1:41:05] supernatural, not because you shouted,
[1:41:07] not because you spoke in tongues, but
[1:41:09] something supernatural has to happen in
[1:41:11] here, then you are sealed away in God.
[1:41:15] You are anchored. Okay, we on the home
[1:41:18] stretch here. He said, "I'm saying
[1:41:20] tonight, my Christian friend, no matter
[1:41:22] what church you belong to, as in the
[1:41:24] message in groups, wherever you are, if
[1:41:27] you are not into the kingdom of God by
[1:41:30] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, bringing
[1:41:33] you into the body of Christ, you press
[1:41:35] in now, for you don't know what hour he
[1:41:38] is coming." Acts 5:32 says, "And we are
[1:41:42] his witnesses of these things, and so
[1:41:44] also is the Holy Ghost, whom God had
[1:41:48] given to them that obey him.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; So right now through this message, words
[1:41:54] will be coming to you. God thoughts will
[1:41:56] be coming to you, things to make right,
[1:41:58] things to correct, things to follow
[1:42:00] through, things to adjust. And as you
[1:42:02] respond to the Holy Spirit, who in your
[1:42:04] heart as you obey him, he will take you
[1:42:06] to the Holy Ghost. He will take you into
[1:42:08] your baptism. He gives the Holy Ghost to
[1:42:10] them that obey him.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the Bible says, watch,
[1:42:16] what is the kingdom of God?
[1:42:19] How do we get into the kingdom?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is the word of God
[1:42:23] made back into power.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He say here we are the end time coming
[1:42:27] from the east and west, north and south.
[1:42:28] What are we doing? Getting ready for the
[1:42:30] rapture. Getting ready holding ourselves
[1:42:33] steady for a few minutes till every
[1:42:35] fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; That's how you're going to rapture. Not
[1:42:38] with a book and tape. You ain't walking
[1:42:40] to the rapture. Where's my Bible? I'm
[1:42:42] going to rapture. No,
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; you're going to rapture by the Holy
[1:42:46] Ghost. Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Remember Peter and them
[1:42:49] had no Bible. You know,
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; they were the living word.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; So, I'll say this to you. It have
[1:42:54] written word,
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; have spoken word,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; it have living word.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; The most powerful one is the living
[1:43:02] word.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; The word itself became flesh.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was the living word.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Some people could speak word
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; but I ain't know the life behind that.
[1:43:11] But the living word that's different all
[1:43:13] together. Are you with me? Oh my. I'm
[1:43:16] going to skip down. Oh, we're almost
[1:43:18] there. Music, please. Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Dynamics,
[1:43:24] Easter message, dynamics and mechanics
[1:43:26] together. The mechanics without dynamics
[1:43:28] no good. Needles dynamics without the
[1:43:30] mechanics. It only work if it come
[1:43:32] together. He says, so one will sit still
[1:43:35] and the other one will go up. No matter
[1:43:38] how good the mechanics is, until the
[1:43:41] dynamics come, nothing going to move.
[1:43:43] Then he said this this morning. In the
[1:43:45] church of the living God this morning
[1:43:48] lays the power to heal all sicknesses.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; In the church of the living God lays the
[1:43:53] power to overcome all temptation. In the
[1:43:56] possession of the church of the living
[1:43:57] God this morning lays the power to take
[1:43:59] change sin and throw it away and receive
[1:44:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh,
[1:44:04] praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:44:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:44:10] Praise God. Praise God. And then he
[1:44:13] began to pray a prayer in this uh this
[1:44:16] is where I'm finishing in the faith of
[1:44:19] the saints. I believe it is. He said,
[1:44:20] "How many ministers are in here that
[1:44:23] believe that the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:25] Spirit is for the believers today?"
[1:44:27] Raise your hands. Ministers of the
[1:44:28] gospel, would you walk right up here
[1:44:30] around here with these people? He's
[1:44:31] talking to them. Do you believe who are
[1:44:34] standing here seeking the baptism of the
[1:44:37] Holy Spirit? I'm very grateful to you.
[1:44:39] I'm grateful for that little ministry
[1:44:41] the Lord has given me here to be
[1:44:42] effective. He's standing here right here
[1:44:45] now. Begin to play something softly.
[1:44:48] He's standing here right now and he will
[1:44:51] give each one of you the baptism of the
[1:44:53] Holy Spirit. Now remember, it's a gift.
[1:44:56] It isn't a faith. It's a gift. You say,
[1:44:59] "Well, I believe I've got it." That
[1:45:00] won't work. It isn't that. It's a gift.
[1:45:03] Unmmerited gift. God just gives it to
[1:45:05] you. Not because you believe it, but
[1:45:06] because God gives it to you and you come
[1:45:08] asking him for it. Blessed are they that
[1:45:11] hung on after righteousness, for they
[1:45:13] shall be filled. God will give you the
[1:45:15] Holy Spirit. I want you to open your
[1:45:16] heart and say, "Father, dear, I'm a
[1:45:20] believer. I am your child." Let's all
[1:45:23] stand. I now want the Holy Spirit to
[1:45:27] come into my heart. I lay all the world
[1:45:29] on the altar. I lay everything on the
[1:45:33] altar. And then but I don't want to talk
[1:45:36] about the Holy Spirit is here. He say
[1:45:38] here's the angel of God standing right
[1:45:40] here. It isn't five feet above their
[1:45:43] head right now. The very angel you see
[1:45:45] on the picture standing right here above
[1:45:48] them right now. You feel the spirit of
[1:45:51] God pointing to your heart. Then when
[1:45:53] you raise your hands and thank him for
[1:45:55] it, say, "Lord, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:45:57] I'm so grateful that you give me the
[1:45:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit." You'll feel
[1:46:01] the power of God search through your
[1:46:02] body. You'll be a different person from
[1:46:04] time on. Hallelujah. That's what we
[1:46:07] supposed to do. Lay our hands on them
[1:46:10] who are seeking the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:12] Spirit. He said, "Father, I pray knowing
[1:46:15] this very hour millions of prayers
[1:46:17] around the world is coming into your
[1:46:18] ears. You hear every one of them. That's
[1:46:20] not way from you to fail, but hear every
[1:46:22] one of them. Lord, the dear poor
[1:46:25] children coming up. I pray for mercy. Oh
[1:46:27] God, send your blessings. May the Holy
[1:46:30] Ghost that's hanging right over this
[1:46:31] people now may he fall upon them just
[1:46:33] now. Then he said these words. Now
[1:46:35] Satan, you lost your authority. You lost
[1:46:38] your power and the Holy Ghost is here to
[1:46:40] take over and to bless these people and
[1:46:43] to fill them with God's goodness. Let's
[1:46:45] pray. Father, we thank you this morning.
[1:46:47] We thank you for your presence, Lord.
[1:46:49] May you pour out your spirit upon your
[1:46:50] people, seal them into the kingdom of
[1:46:53] God. May you fill them with the Holy
[1:46:54] Ghost. Fill them with your love. Fill
[1:46:56] them with your power. I pray in Jesus
[1:46:58] name I ask it. Amen and amen. May the
[1:47:01] Lord bless you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:04] Glory to God.
