[29:21] possibility and I'll tell you why there
[29:23] was a man named Abraham you may be see
[29:25] was a old man he couldn't have any
[29:27] children
[29:28] his wife was Barren and the Bible said
[29:31] against hope he believ in hope when
[29:34] there was no hope when the doctor would
[29:37] have turned his back on that man the
[29:39] Bible said he believed God that's the
[29:42] difference when you come to the spot
[29:45] when everything seems to be failing
[29:46] around you and you choose to believe God
[29:50] for your deliverance to believe God for
[29:52] your healing to believe God for your
[29:55] breakthrough to believe God for your
[29:58] Revival my God I see old people could
[30:01] get revived I see old Eagles come back
[30:05] young again I don't care if you
[30:08] up I don't care if in a wheelchair

[37:33] the midst of Israel that I am the Lord
[37:35] your God and none else and my people
[37:36] shall never be ashamed and it shall come
[37:38] to pass afterwards that I will pour my
[37:41] spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your
[37:43] daughter shall prophesy your old men

[37:46] see visions and also upon my handmaids

[37:58] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[38:00] darkness the moon into blood before the
[38:02] great and terity of the Lord let us pray
[38:04] father we thank you that you have
[38:05] promises for the bride elect before the
[38:08] great and terrible day of the Lord
[38:10] father when you come down tonight and
[38:11] begin to manifest your promises pour out
[38:13] your spirit upon your people we are
[38:15] needy and we are wait upon you in Jesus
[38:17] name we ask it amen you may be
[38:22] seated praise God what have a title the
[38:26] restoration of the faith
[38:28] and I have a inspiration the promis Holy
[38:31] Ghost baptism to the bride oh blessed be
[38:34] the name of the lordu the promised Holy
[38:37] Ghost baptism to the bride now but
[38:40] Branham brought one message one
[38:43] inspiration and we are all in it it is
[38:46] an inspiration of Seven Seas and seven
[38:48] tunders to prepare the people to leave
[38:51] this earth to prepare people to get the
[38:53] extra oil to get ready to be as the wise
[38:57] virgins amen do you believe that yes sir
[39:00] now there can be no real faith without
[39:04] manifestation because works is Faith
[39:08] expressed so when we speak about
[39:10] restoration of the faith it cannot be
[39:13] without
[39:14] manifestation because works is evidence
[39:18] of faith if you have faith you will have
[39:20] a manifestation to express the Fai that
[39:24] you say that you have isn't that right
[39:27] and the prophet said there have been no
[39:28] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[39:32] so what he is saying is that Faith have
[39:34] to come forward to produce a
[39:36] manifestation of God and that
[39:39] manifestation is what will awake stir
[39:43] excite Insight the bride in other words
[39:47] it can't be Revelation only teaching
[39:50] only it's got to be power and
[39:55] demonstration of the spirit so when we
[39:58] talk about the restoration of the faith
[40:00] we are speaking about the restoration of
[40:02] Power with signs wonders and miracles
[40:07] that is what we are talking about could
[40:09] we give the Lord a shout of Praise And
[40:11] there have been an absence in this
[40:14] message of that power but Joel said I am
[40:18] going to restore I'm not hearing you
[40:21] tonight all the years that it was absent
[40:26] all the years you didn't see it and
[40:29] taste it and experience it I am going to
[40:33] restore and my people shall be
[40:37] satisfied my people they're going to
[40:40] praise me my people shall not be
[40:47] ashamed oh Hallelujah are you with me
[40:51] tonight what is he saying you'll be
[40:54] redeemed from your sin from your past
[40:59] from your failures from your mistakes
[41:02] you'll be justified all way you're
[41:04] feeling condemn God promis to apply
[41:08] blood upon your life God promis to look
[41:12] at you as if you never did it never did
[41:16] it God promis to justify you not just
[41:21] forgive you come on now help me somebody
[41:25] help me somebody I'm excited now I'm not
[41:29] talking about forgiveness I am talking
[41:32] about
[41:33] justification as if you never did it you
[41:38] can't sit there and believe that you got
[41:41] to shout you got to
[41:52] Rejoice my people my people he separated
[41:57] from other people he said my people my
[42:00] very own people the called by my name my
[42:05] people Mrs Jesus come on Oh Glory Give
[42:08] the Lord a shout my people you know who
[42:12] you are when you hear my people you
[42:16] better say Amen you better shout like
[42:20] how John
[42:25] shout hallelujah
[42:33] I like how God to talk I call you by
[42:36] name before your mother conceive you
[42:39] before your mother had you I ordain you
[42:42] to be a profit into the nation before
[42:45] she even know she pregnant orain the
[42:48] seed to come forth nothing will stop the
[42:53] mystery of who you are from unfolding
[43:03] so therefore brother B said there have
[43:05] be no manifestation of God Amen to stir
[43:08] the bride it will take those seven
[43:11] tunders to produce it to produce what to
[43:16] produce a
[43:17] manifestation not Revelation only but a
[43:23] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[43:28] because you are not really bride yet
[43:31] until you come into an experience with
[43:34] your mate your husband with Charity with
[43:37] the Holy Ghost is only then you get
[43:41] connected with your husband his wife
[43:45] have made herself ready so God want to
[43:48] contact you God want to touch you God
[43:52] want to connect with you oh Hallelujah
[43:57] Glory do you believe that so you must
[43:59] have an experience with the person of
[44:02] the Holy Ghost isn't that right the
[44:05] person of Christ so the calling out time
[44:09] which we have had for 50 plus years of
[44:13] teaching and Revelation is about to
[44:17] change the season is going to change
[44:20] right before your eyes the time of the
[44:24] ministry of the spirit the supernat
[44:27] natural and omnipotent speaking even sin
[44:31] being called out it will be changed
[44:34] right in front of your eye Power is
[44:38] coming to block out the spirit of man
[44:41] that's right you see when Peter James
[44:43] and John saw Jesus with that Glory
[44:46] around him they said let us make three
[44:48] Tabernacles and the power shut them up
[44:51] the power said shut
[44:53] up here ye him don't come with your
[44:56] human IC thought don't try to build no
[44:59] Tabernacle to make no man no glory at
[45:02] the end of it Christ only Christ only
[45:07] Jesus only not even
[45:12] fivefold not pastor and evangelist and
[45:14] Prophet no
[45:16] Jesus only when they look there was only
[45:19] Jesus No Moses no Elight and not Jesus
[45:22] only have to come back to Jesus only it
[45:25] got to come back to Jesus Jus only
[45:28] Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[45:31] and forever so power I believe that the
[45:35] time has come for the power of God to
[45:39] follow the word the power is going to
[45:42] change you there's got to come a
[45:44] resurrection power among the bride isn't
[45:48] that right and the first thing that
[45:50] power going to lead to is to the Cross
[45:53] where you are crucified with Christ oh
[45:55] give the Lord some praises oh hallelujah
[45:59] hallelujah not not power to show off not
[46:03] power to say I am right you are wrong no
[46:06] power to die Oh Glory to God because
[46:10] that is where Jesus conquered Jesus
[46:12] didn't conquered casting no Devils he
[46:14] didn't conquer raising and Healing The
[46:16] Sick that was the easy PA the path where
[46:19] he conquered is when it looked like
[46:21] nothing happening when he on the cross
[46:24] when he says finish
[46:31] oh Hallelujah it didn't look all the
[46:34] dramatic it was painful but it was there
[46:37] he
[46:38] conquered in suffering that's right in
[46:41] crucifixion in price being paid friends
[46:45] this gospel has to become real if Christ
[46:48] suffered so must we if he went through
[46:51] we got to go through also you you just
[46:54] have to bless God to escape the terrible
[46:57] day of the Lord but before that terrible
[46:59] day come a day of Darkness gloess a day
[47:02] of Blackness a day that you wouldn't
[47:04] even want to think about before that day
[47:06] come he promises to send Elijah the
[47:09] prophet and he had a job to do he's
[47:12] going to turn not the head of the people
[47:15] back to the faith of the fathers no not
[47:17] not the head he going to turn the heart
[47:20] somebody say heart yes I want heart God
[47:23] want heart your heart that's the real
[47:27] you your heart from the abundance of the
[47:30] heart the mouth speak when your heart
[47:32] turn back you speak where your heart is
[47:37] at oh you have some powerful things to
[47:40] say tonight Hallelujah I'll say a little
[47:43] hint to you the Holy Ghost cannot behave
[47:46] in one man and misbehave in
[47:49] another because God behavior is his
[47:51] person Hallelujah so when God say turn
[47:54] your heart back to the faith that's just
[47:55] what he means that's right your heart
[47:58] not not not you had to go to some church
[47:59] your heart you see the devil is fighting
[48:02] watch the rock of Revelation to the
[48:09] individual so what the devil introduced
[48:11] the people to to church and group so the
[48:16] people end up with group
[48:18] [Applause]
[48:20] think but once you catch that the Father
[48:24] in Heaven he alone is the reveal
[48:27] then that frees you from group church
[48:32] group think group Revelation group
[48:36] interpretation men's
[48:43] ideas then you would realize God will
[48:47] have young Sons older Sons and different
[48:51] kind of sons no it's it's
[48:54] sons in other words a son of God serving
[48:57] God for the last 30 years is same as a
[48:59] son just came in 5 minutes
[49:03] ago somebody drunk just give the heart
[49:07] of the Lord 3 minutes ago they are just
[49:10] as much sun as somebody 40 years coming
[49:14] to
[49:23] church you see the problem is your human
[49:26] IC realm where you seeing who spiritual
[49:30] who more holy who more righteous but
[49:33] when God bring his binoculars he said
[49:35] all have
[49:39] sinned and if you have sinned you're
[49:41] born in
[49:44] it in other words you're born in it you
[49:48] do it so stop playing righteous we will
[49:51] expose you tonight because there is none
[49:57] righteous no not
[50:01] one shake somebody hand and tell them
[50:04] there is UN
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:14] righteous oh you could give the Lord a
[50:22] shout now watch I was a Catholic but my
[50:26] name was in the
[50:27] I was even my
[50:30] acolyte that a serving
[50:35] Catholic but God called
[50:39] me the whole family stayed but God
[50:42] called me and I made a choice to give up
[50:46] my sins and repent and get baptized in
[50:48] Jesus
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:50] name next year going to be 40 years
[50:53] since I made that choice
[50:57] and a
[50:58] feeling a
[51:00] feeling just as
[51:02] strong as when I first started out don't
[51:06] let the gray hair bother you because
[51:09] it's not bothering me I just as strong
[51:13] my soul on fire I'm under
[51:16] expectation I ain't looking to die now
[51:19] I'm looking to start to live because
[51:22] Jesus said I come that you might have
[51:26] life and have it more
[51:29] abundantly I want the Abundant Life I
[51:32] want God's joy am M trying
[51:38] [Applause]
[51:46] circumstances so all of you who want to
[51:50] express your dose of
[51:51] tiredness because you're waiting long
[51:54] cut it out because he come down
[51:58] according to first Thessalonians 4 the
[52:01] Lord himself already come down I have
[52:04] news for you shocking news oh shocking
[52:08] news yes you see but the BAM says the
[52:11] seven angels come from eternity to
[52:13] gather up the scattered word to tie back
[52:16] into the word to bring down the Holy
[52:20] Ghost so they brought down the Holy
[52:23] Ghost but we wasn't ready yet for the
[52:25] Holy Ghost
[52:27] in that measure so the Holy Ghost came
[52:30] down as the word because Jesus said the
[52:34] words that I speak they are spirit and
[52:38] they are life so God take his spirit and
[52:42] hide it as the word which is the
[52:45] revelation of the son of man the sore of
[52:50] the seed so we had us to live under the
[52:54] anointing of the ministry of the word to
[52:57] be seated down because the Holy Ghost
[53:01] have to fall in such a way upon planted
[53:06] W that it will
[53:08] restore that will be the
[53:12] restoration of the
[53:18] faith watch this how could the faith be
[53:21] restored and we can't do what Peter did
[53:26] [Music]
[53:29] Peter didn't have Seven
[53:30] Seals seven Church ages all the
[53:34] Mysteries but he had the
[53:38] faith you see the faith is
[53:42] Christ the Holy Ghost in you the
[53:49] person not just the baptism but the
[53:52] added life
[53:58] so that is why Peter could say Silver
[54:00] and Gold Have I None I have something
[54:04] and I could release it I have it I could
[54:07] give it he actually had the germ of
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:15] God resident in him and because the gym
[54:20] was in him he could speak for other
[54:25] Sons and bring them into
[54:28] manifestation what Adam was supposed to
[54:34] do Adam was to bring Representatives
[54:39] like him that's right but when man fell
[54:42] it went into the sex way instead of
[54:44] spoken word which was word and spirit so
[54:48] when Jesus came his first message was
[54:51] you must be born again of word and
[54:54] spirit amen so it had to bring back word
[54:58] in order for you to get back to Spirit
[55:01] but the word was lost so God s a prophet
[55:06] to restore the word that was lost so we
[55:11] could come back the word and
[55:22] spirit so before the appointed time
[55:24] comes he had was to have the calling out
[55:27] time which you in right now so even
[55:30] though people want to cut people off and
[55:31] to people off God's still calling that's
[55:34] right whosoever will come come quickly
[55:36] spirit in the bright sck come come come
[55:37] take the word come hold the ticket
[55:42] come the ticket is the token the ticket
[55:45] is the word when you buy a bus ticket
[55:48] the D the conductor don't want to see
[55:49] your
[55:50] money he want to see the ticket if you
[55:53] don't have a ticket he say go and byy
[55:58] go and get some oil and then come
[56:01] back the bus is ready to go everybody's
[56:05] in line have a ticket you have your
[56:07] money you could have a million dollars
[56:09] he is authorized only to take the ticket
[56:12] you said conductor hold $100 bill he
[56:14] said no
[56:15] ticket where do you get it you have to
[56:17] go to the count and buy it and while
[56:19] they went to buy the bus take
[56:24] off don't be caught like that
[56:27] you want your ticket your ticket is
[56:29] evidence you pay a
[56:31] [Music]
[56:32] price I'm not hearing you I'm not
[56:35] hearing you so when you see a
[56:39] man with the power of God you know that
[56:43] man paid a
[56:46] [Applause]
[56:50] price amen are you with me yes amen
[56:54] remember Christ in the true church is a
[56:57] continuation of the book of Acts The
[56:59] Book of Revelation shows how the
[57:01] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[57:04] church and defile
[57:07] it that's prophecy what preacher you got
[57:10] to be giving me the church yes that
[57:13] Satan
[57:14] visiting he not visiting the panyard and
[57:16] theal T no he visiting the church to
[57:20] defile it why because he understand that
[57:24] if we get things in order the power of
[57:26] God going to be here to destroy his
[57:29] works his imps and his
[57:32] demons so he want to affect and inflict
[57:36] and mess up the church to affect the
[57:39] power from flowing freely in other words
[57:42] nobody supposed to walk in here sick and
[57:44] stay sick I want to declare that tonight
[57:48] I want to say a certain way
[57:51] tonight nobody should walk in this
[57:53] building sick and walk back out

[1:07:10] them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:15] hallelujah you see the thing about it is
[1:07:17] this as humans we feel sorry as humans
[1:07:21] we want to extend ourselves and Care in
[1:07:22] a certain way but God doesn't operate
[1:07:26] as a human does his eyes see it
[1:07:30] different and we have to go with the
[1:07:32] eyes of God that's why Jesus always
[1:07:34] looking for the seeds looking for the
[1:07:36] sun look at the sons of zebede with the
[1:07:39] fish and neck and the business and he
[1:07:40] watch them all follow me how you will
[1:07:43] interpret that business know at a boom
[1:07:46] you need your boys and this man with
[1:07:50] beard come and say follow me and the
[1:07:52] Bible said they drop their Nets
[1:07:56] Amen to follow a
[1:07:59] NAD a man who had no place no
[1:08:02] Hotel no
[1:08:06] business no salary check to write out
[1:08:09] for them he said follow me and I will
[1:08:12] make
[1:08:14] you fishes of
[1:08:16] men and that's what the gospel is about
[1:08:19] fishing for men to understand that they
[1:08:24] are going to be Sons
[1:08:29] so ignorant man fisherman can't write
[1:08:32] his name can't read called by God to
[1:08:36] follow Jesus Jesus know only man can't
[1:08:38] read can write but Jesus dropping
[1:08:41] promises upon Him same works I do shall
[1:08:43] you do
[1:08:45] also if he shall say to this mountain be
[1:08:47] move and don't doubt you could have what
[1:08:49] you say Jesus dropping Promises by
[1:08:52] Spoken Word
[1:08:56] into their Spirits into their soul and
[1:08:59] one time he released an anointing upon
[1:09:01] them he said behold I give you power and
[1:09:04] my God is start to cast out Devils they
[1:09:06] come back rejoicing saying Lord devils
[1:09:08] are rejoicing Rejoice devils are
[1:09:11] subjected ourselves to us he said don't
[1:09:13] Rejoice for that Rejoice because your
[1:09:15] names is written because he knew they
[1:09:18] don't have character yet he knew it's a
[1:09:21] taste of power to show them what is
[1:09:24] possible
[1:09:27] I want you to say a big Amen on that
[1:09:29] because many preachers have a taste of
[1:09:31] power that God only show what is
[1:09:33] possible but he must have character and
[1:09:36] character is not a gift character is a
[1:09:39] victory you have to go through stuff you
[1:09:42] have to go through
[1:09:44] [Applause]
[1:09:46] something so stop looking down and out
[1:09:49] because you fail and you fall and
[1:09:50] whatever forget that it's a good thing
[1:09:52] you fall you know how you fall
[1:09:56] and you don't have to fall again because
[1:09:58] God could Empower you tonight the power
[1:10:01] of his word and upon that the power of
[1:10:04] His Spirit don't tell me it can't happen
[1:10:06] because Samson didn't have the Holy
[1:10:08] Ghost but the spirit Came Upon him I'm
[1:10:11] not hearing you and he did something
[1:10:14] when the spirit Came Upon him Peter
[1:10:16] didn't have the Holy Ghost but he walked
[1:10:18] on
[1:10:19] water I'm not hearing you I'm not
[1:10:21] hearing you I'm not hearing you even
[1:10:24] without the the Holy Ghost he was in the
[1:10:28] Supernatural Jesus he said Jesus if that
[1:10:30] is you beat me to come and Jesus said
[1:10:33] come one word come
[1:10:37] am what would make a normal man walk out
[1:10:40] a boat to walk like Jesus I'm not
[1:10:44] hearing you Jesus was walking on water
[1:10:47] and Jesus said if you be me to come just
[1:10:49] say come I ain't coming if you don't say
[1:10:52] come if you say come I'm coming amen
[1:10:55] because I know you are the
[1:10:57] [Applause]
[1:10:58] boss that is when they could really
[1:11:00] trust God that's when they can really
[1:11:03] have faith in God and Peter start to
[1:11:05] walk as he was watching Jesus of course
[1:11:07] the devil get a fight because the devil
[1:11:09] seeing potential and anytime the devil
[1:11:11] he potentially want to kill it so he
[1:11:13] whip up some waves and Peter took his
[1:11:15] eyes off of Jesus and looked on the
[1:11:18] waves and he begin to sinking but you
[1:11:20] know what I love about him you say try
[1:11:22] to make back stroke and front stro and
[1:11:23] he's a s man and he don't want how you
[1:11:25] look among my brethren he said Lord I'm
[1:11:29] seing and I kind of like that no P could
[1:11:33] swim he's a fisherman all fishermen
[1:11:35] could swim but Peter wasn't taking no
[1:11:38] risk why take risk and Jesus is
[1:11:46] there yeah yeah you could swim but Jesus
[1:11:49] he could pull you up pull you out oh
[1:11:52] glory to godall so we talking about

[1:13:14] worse Jesus in the boat he's tired devil

[1:18:28] matter of the church it's a matter God

[1:28:12] your condition at your sick
[1:28:15] condition blind batim you know the story
[1:28:18] am he was begging every day and that day
[1:28:21] nobody on the street he want to know
[1:28:22] what what happening I'm getting no
[1:28:24] nobody to support me and then somebody
[1:28:26] said Jesus is on the next rate Lord have
[1:28:28] mercy upon me he began to cry out not
[1:28:32] sick out not depressed out not sad out
[1:28:36] because Jesus is not there near him he
[1:28:39] begin to cry out cry out watch that
[1:28:44] crying out was a symbolism of the faith
[1:28:46] inside of him because Jesus couldn't
[1:28:49] hear his cry literally but that faith in
[1:28:53] his soul hit heaven and Heaven touched
[1:28:56] Jesus and Jesus couldn't help it he has
[1:28:59] to walk wherever fate is wherever faith
[1:29:02] is Power is coming and seven tunders
[1:29:07] give faith and Faith with leaders to
[1:29:10] power and power will take us to the
[1:29:13] promise to manifest the promise and the
[1:29:16] Bible is the road map of God's power and
[1:29:20] Faith must lead
[1:29:26] how many could sh in that
[1:29:33] one say it again brother brother R said
[1:29:35] that the road map you may be seated is
[1:29:37] the Bible and Faith leads you to power
[1:29:42] and power leads you to the promise you
[1:29:45] see we're born in sin shape iniquity so
[1:29:47] we born defeated so we have nothing to
[1:29:49] boast about our boasting is in the blood
[1:29:52] our boast is in the C cross because
[1:29:55] Jesus Come To Die to redeem us and the
[1:29:58] word to redeem is to bring us back so he
[1:30:01] didn't come to do a halfway job I come
[1:30:03] to redeem them but I I can't make now
[1:30:05] because things hot boy things really
[1:30:07] pressure no he released the Redemption
[1:30:10] by releasing the book it was the book of
[1:30:13] redemption now if the book is sealed you
[1:30:15] don't know for sure you're there because
[1:30:17] your name is sealed up but once that
[1:30:20] book is unsealed you have the
[1:30:22] opportunity to connect listen to who you
[1:30:25] really
[1:30:29] are you thought you was a sinner you
[1:30:32] thought it was a Baptist and Methodist
[1:30:33] jewi Witness Catholic you thought that
[1:30:35] but when the book
[1:30:38] open then you recognize that you are son
[1:30:42] and daughter of God not of your mother
[1:30:45] and
[1:30:49] father your mother only father only give
[1:30:52] you physical characteristics but you are
[1:30:56] the physical manifestation of the
[1:30:59] attribute that you are in God so God put
[1:31:02] a germ in you in the
[1:31:05] Dust In Your
[1:31:07] Dust the devil can't see that germ
[1:31:10] because he don't have
[1:31:12] discernment of germ of
[1:31:19] God and addition the Bible said the word
[1:31:21] alone is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:31:25] am and intense of the heart so the heart
[1:31:29] is uh no trespasses please for the devil
[1:31:34] and no trespass sign over your heart so
[1:31:37] the devil can come and trespass what God
[1:31:39] have as a hidden Mystery inside of you
[1:31:42] which is the germ now because it's
[1:31:45] inside of you Jesus could plainly say
[1:31:48] all that the father hath given me will
[1:31:52] come
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:58] Jesus is not in pain tonight oh God you
[1:32:01] sure he go come no no he's not in that
[1:32:05] all the father not now giving me hat
[1:32:10] given me past tense you're not now
[1:32:14] [Applause]
[1:32:18] saved you're getting a revelation of the
[1:32:21] blood that bought you
[1:32:24] but God put your gym in the book and
[1:32:29] when we preach the word we are preaching
[1:32:32] your
[1:32:38] name that is why you could Shout at the
[1:32:41] word that is why you can get excited
[1:32:44] because when you hear the word yes you
[1:32:46] have your struggle in your flesh yes you
[1:32:48] have battles in your mind you're
[1:32:50] supposed to have the battle
[1:32:54] if you have no back for something
[1:32:55] [Applause]
[1:32:58] wrong so God allow the loosen spirit
[1:33:02] Spirit the god up the Loose Ends the
[1:33:05] spirit people that loosen their life you
[1:33:06] see because the foolish versions are
[1:33:08] really free
[1:33:11] thinkers you know some people don't like
[1:33:13] discipline right don't like correction
[1:33:14] they want to do their own thing if you
[1:33:16] talk to them and correct them they get
[1:33:17] veex they don't like you say you like
[1:33:19] how you say it they don't like what you
[1:33:20] say they don't like this free thinkers
[1:33:24] but God have a
[1:33:25] pattern a sress work with a pattern a
[1:33:28] sress can just watch you and say okay
[1:33:30] you're looking like size 18 give me the
[1:33:32] cloth give my my scissors let me
[1:33:37] go you know don't go back there that is
[1:33:42] trouble somebody say okay just give me
[1:33:44] the cloth and give me the scissors I get
[1:33:46] you no measurement no pattern no nothing
[1:33:49] that's dangerous she could give you a
[1:33:51] sack and you had a tire Rob WR it so so
[1:33:54] so so so you just don't do that well God
[1:33:57] have a pattern there it
[1:34:04] is so when God scissors come out God can
[1:34:08] say oh you don't like it
[1:34:10] so how you how you like
[1:34:13] it God himself can't do that because I
[1:34:17] will make him not God he said I am God
[1:34:20] and I change not my pattern change not
[1:34:24] it's Faith first virtue second knowledge
[1:34:28] third gain Temperance D patience then
[1:34:32] you now coming to Godliness then you
[1:34:35] have to have forgiveness because faith
[1:34:37] is based
[1:34:39] [Applause]
[1:34:44] on
[1:34:45] wory
[1:34:51] wory now watch the devil know faith is
[1:34:55] based upon forgiveness because that's
[1:34:57] what being preached so his job is to
[1:35:00] make sure it have some solid ODS and
[1:35:04] some concrete
[1:35:07] Grudge long standing for years Family
[1:35:12] Feud for years and the devil tell them
[1:35:15] go to church but do not forgive at
[1:35:19] all say Amen say Amen say hallelujah say
[1:35:22] Glory Glory Glory
[1:35:24] raise your hand raise hand and wave wave
[1:35:26] wave wave but when you go home don't
[1:35:32] forgive because if you only forgive God
[1:35:35] will come
[1:35:39] down I can't afford
[1:35:45] that so have church Wars this pastor
[1:35:48] against that Pastor this believer
[1:35:50] against that believer husband fighting
[1:35:52] with wife why fighting with children dog
[1:35:55] fighting with cat everybody
[1:36:01] fighting no
[1:36:03] forgiveness because once forgiveness
[1:36:07] start to be
[1:36:08] effective you put yourself in a position
[1:36:12] to be like
[1:36:13] God because he smiles on the just and on
[1:36:18] the unjust and the rain just falls on
[1:36:22] the tomatic tree and the marijuana

[1:37:10] it kind a god kind a Godly kind a kind
[1:37:14] of holy kind a righteous kind every seed
