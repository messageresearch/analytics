Jesus Christ Christ and the church says and the church says am amen well this evening we have our communion service and uh before we do that how many appreciate the service this morning appreciate our pastor Restoration in the time of judgment amen what a message what a masterpiece what an inspiration to us this evening and um God's Prophet brother bam believe that it's it's really critical it's important to start the new year with the Lord's Supper in fact uh brother Bram sometimes would have communion service for his old years night on New Year's Eve service and it's very striking to me as I've been meditating on the word that the very last message that brother brandham preached before he went on to be with the Lord was communion you know and I said God doesn't make mistakes but God could have had brother brandham to speak on anything but he led him to speak on communion um as his parting words to us so today we want to just speak a bit about communion before we approach this sacred ordinance this evening so if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 certainly want to greet everyone this evening happy New Year and greet all on the internet so 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he Breo it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup which he had SED when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup he do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come shall we pray once more heavenly father as we prepare to approach this sacred service Lord and father may you bless the reading of the word and bless the hearing of the word father for the next few minutes to set the tone for Lord this first communion service of this year Lord may you speak to every heart and may such a sincerity and honesty father sacredness dropped down here tonight to realize that what we're about to do is a very serious undertaking father may you bless your people may you bless those that would participate may you bless the Lord God the ministry and the Believers Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated so just for a few minutes before brother Steven comes back to lead us in communion I have a thought this evening do this in remembrance of me you know Memories We we all have memories good memories bad memories short memories long memories happy memories sad memories one thing we all have in common our memories but this scripture raises some spiritual alarms because it suggests that somehow we can live our lives and forget about Christ we can come to church and forget about Christ we could sit in the message and forget about Christ but here it is in this passage of texts Jesus is saying do this in remembrance of me having a bad memory may have its advantages because some of us or all of us we may have things that we would rather forget but there are times when having a bad memory can have serious consequences one of the great fears in scripture for a Christian is forgetfulness not the Casual type of forgetting your keys or forgetting something but the kind of forgetfulness that can get you killed the kind of forgetfulness that creates problems with God it's a forgetfulness of the Lord where we forget the purpose forget why we are here sometimes we forget out of panic things in our lives may be going in so many different directions that it seems all that we could do to survive is focus on the present situation and how we going to get out of the problem and in doing so we forget about Christ on the other hand things might be so good so blessed so powerful you so get caught up in what we eat and drink and work and succeed at the end result of it is we end up forgetting Christ one time Paul says to Timothy remember Christ Jesus or remember Jesus Christ this message would not be necessary or this encouragement or this word would not be necessary if we always remembered Christ and the real deeper question this evening is how can we forget the one who called us how could we forget the one who took us out of the Miry clay how could we forget the one who saved us how could we really forget the one who called us and loved us when we were lost and in the condition that were we in but yet it is Jesus is saying to his disciples do this in remembrance of me it is amazing how easy it is to forget the most important things in life sometimes you spend so much time focused on the insignificant things until there is no strength to deal with the significant things and if we would all admit it to tonight the truth is all of us are guilty in some way of forgetting Christ the mornings you woke up and forgot to pray the mornings you got up and forgot the scriptures the days you got up and forgot to pick up a spoken word book the days you forgot to acknowledge that you are alive because of him the truth is we forget about Christ sometimes and to think in scripture when Jesus was here Mary and Joseph one time the Bible said they went to a feast and they got so caught up in the feast brother Powell that they forgot Jesus they were so caught up in the feast that it took three days before they realized that Jesus was not with them they got so caught up in the tradition of doing what they did that they assumed that Jesus was with somebody else in the crow and they had to retrace themselves and it was only then they found Jesus was in the temple expounding on the scriptures they had forgotten Jesus the truth is if we are really completely sold out to God we would spend all day all night talking about him thinking about him am looking for him amen but I thank God for this Most Holy reminder today do this in remembrance of me we remember songs we remember remember scriptures we remember words but do we really remember Jesus but for the next few minutes I want to present something here it is Paul in the book of Corinthians he is writing to the Corinthians and he's saying Jesus asked all of his followers to participate in this Holy Communion this special meal in remembrance of him and I'm sure those words would have sounded foreign to the Corinthians as they might to some of us today because how could you remember somebody you never saw how could you remember somebody you never talked to how could you remember somebody you never listen to because Jesus never went to Corinth the Christians they had only heard of him how could Jesus say do this in remembrance of me like today just as it was in Corinth the Christians had a lot of issues in that day the Christians in that Corinthian Church had many issues some like Apollo some like Paul some feel Peter should come and preach and Paul in the midst of that in that 1 Corinthians chapter 11 Begins by talking about follow me as I follow Christ amen and as he begin to address certain issues of what was taking place in the church he brings them to a spot where he says I am giving you something the same way God give it to me and he begins to tell of what Jesus did and he presents a context because for you to understand the context of what Jesus was saying of of of do this in remembrance of me you have to understand the scenario at the time Jesus was at the end of his ministry he had finished all of his altercation and clashes with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they were out to just get him and here it was he was about to participate in the Feast of the Passover Hallelujah with his disciples this was no strange Feast this was a feast that every single Jew was used to particip ipating in because this was the one time of the year they would remember what happened when they came out of Egypt Hallelujah GL Moses had commanded them always remember this day how God took you out of Egypt and how the death angel passed over you and they would celebrate with a feast that's right some of you may know that during the Feast of the Passover it's a tradition so there are certain things that must take place and and among the things that take place brother the popular is the youngest child would ask the oldest person in the room in every house under Feast of Passover they would ask the question what makes tonight different from every other night what makes this meal different from every other meal I'm not going to meet too long with you we're about to prepare for communion what makes tonight so special and what is amazing is the oldest person in the room has to say it a certain way and if there's only one way to say it you cannot say I want to tell you what happened to them when they came out of Egypt according to the Jewish law it has to be a firsters recollection so you must say this is what the Lord did for me when he took me out of Egypt that's why this night is special and that is the situation the backdrop of what was taking place that night now understand understand this the disciples did not know what to expect that night they were just expecting a usual Passover feast but here it is something different is taking place it was their custom to have unleavened bread it was their custom to have lamb and to have wine and bitter herbs because that's what Moses instructed them to do years ago but this time was different because here it is Jesus Takes the bread and breaks it and said this is my body Lord do this in remembrance of me and the same wine that they would have as their custom he said this represents my blood and I wonder what was happening that night that was so different from every other night it was supposed to be different but this night was another kind of difference Jesus before their very eyes was redefining the Passover he was red refining their understanding of what that night meant because whereas many many years before they had slain a lamb and the blood was put in the door poost here it was the lamb was in the room with them and as he spoke of his body being broken they didn't even realize that just a couple days later his body was going to be broken for them it was a different kind of night prise God he said this cup that is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood he was bringing something serious to them something different communion feet washing and water baptism are three ordinances given to us in scripture water baptism only needs to happen once when you are baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that just needs to happen once but God instituted a way to always remember him by saying do this in remembrance of me tonight we stand here or today we stand here just like the Corinthians who did not know Jesus after the flesh we never saw his feet when he walked on this Earth we never saw the hands that comforted the weary we or the eyes that could see through your life and see what's going on in the depths of your soul amen but we must remember him Hallelujah we never heard when he said the words peace be still or when he cried Lazarus come forth but yet we are required to remember him Hallelujah we cannot speak of how he smiled or how he dressed or when he rebuked the Pharisees for we do not know him after the flesh but we know him as the word and we know him after the spirit tonight and in the same way we can know him as much as Peter Paul or John knew him because when you have an experience with the Holy Ghost you have an experience with Jesus amen hallelujah do this in remembrance of me brother brandom in the message communion as he ended his ministry he spoke of how people brought the ordinances of God as tradition where it just became something to do and that's why I really want to caution the church tonight to really take this and bring it to life in your heart in your mind in your very being that as you do this it's really an opportunity for us to really remember Jesus to remember the pain the Suffering The Agony the tears the cries remember Gethsemane remember the battle of wills as he had to yield his will to say Lord father not my will but ding be done hallelujah if you could picture for a minute the drops of blood that were at Jesus's feet because the Bible says his sweat turned to blood this was not the blood of a wounded man this was the blood of a man who was yet to be wounded but what manner of love it was that he would stand there for us and yet he requires us this evening to do this in remembrance of him with the random in the message communion I'm almost getting ready to close out he says what are you you are a Christian you live before everybody as a Christian and if you take this talking about communion and don't live as a Christian you're not Discerning the Lord's body you're putting a stumbling block in somebody else's way now in other words don't just come and take it as I said a while ago but what the Jews had sacrificed it was wonderful but it got to a place where they didn't do it in sincerity in reverence and in order it became a Sten in Gods knows now the same thing is by our coming to take the Lord's Supper that we must come knowing what we are doing just like when you go into the water to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ this is the prophet you know what you're doing you putting on to the church what God has put in you Christ and when we take this it shows to the church that I believe every word of God I believe that he is the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven I believe every word that he says is truth and I live by it to the best of my knowledge God being my therefore before my brothers before my sisters I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows it and bears me record therefore before you I take the pel of his body to know that I am not condemned with the world see there you are then it's a blessing the musicians going to come up I'm about to close as but deing is ready to come but I challenge you this evening before we even switch over over to begin to pray in your heart the scripture said t one for another meditate on Jesus when you do this remember he died for you amen remember he called you remember he elected you remember he sent a prophet for you remember he revealed every mystery that's why he says do this in remembrance of me do this in remembrance of me because I am Alpha and Omega I am the beginning and the end do this in remembrance of me because even though you see me and you know I'm going to die I'm not going to stay dead I'm going to be raised from the dead I'm not going to leave you comfortless but do this in remembrance of me because the same works that I do you are going to do also Hallelujah do this in remembrance of me to jolt you back into the reality that this is a serious undertaking amen you do show the Lord's death until he comes we have come to the spot where we don't even acknowledge that he died for us and church has become such a tradition if we just come and shout and put our hands up put our hands down and go back home and there's no change in our Behavior that's all right but tonight I see as a night of refreshing Amen to really remember where he is supposed to be in your life in your heart in your mind in your being and to forget everything else if the choice is to remember your school or remember Jesus we have to remember Jesus remember where you live or remember Jesus I rather have Jesus because if you have Jesus that's all that you need it's amazing the things that we spend on times trying to acquire to learn and to remember and somewhere Jesus ends up on a shelf or we just know it as a Bible on the Shelf somewhere and there is no attraction there's no Focus there is no attention but I thank God tonight that he gave us something to remember him that whenever we gather together to take the Lord's Supper it's a moment when we could look into the mirror of the word and ask ourselves the question Lord am I doing all I can do to remember what you did for me because I didn't deserve it Lord there's nothing I could have done to deserve it amen when I was at my lowest point you reach down and peel me up you can be here today if it wasn't for his grace if it wasn't for his love and all he is asking you today is to do this in remembrance of me don't do this to impress anybody don't do this because people expect it of you don't do this because it's a tradition to do it don't do it because it's expected to do it but you're doing it for a purpose that you can acknowledge that he's the same yesterday the same today the same forever doing it because if it was not for the grace of the Lord where would we be but the B I'm use that very statement in the message if it had not been for the grace of the Lord where would we all be this evening because we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity and that's why sometimes we forget him because we get so caught up in the attractions and the distractions but God said when you come to the spot of the Lord's Supper forget everything else and remember me amen hallelujah you could take the whole world but give me Jesus you could have all the money in the world but give me Jesus you can have all the education in the world but give me Jesus amen amen one of the most solemn of ordinances that we could raise beyond our feeling our emotions our fears and come with sincerity saying Lord I'm putting you back in your right place in my heart right place in my mind I've I've been distracted amen you haven't been remembered I got up every morning this week and didn't pray I got up every morning this week and didn't read the Bible I got up every morning this we so caught up in life and work and distresses that really I I never remembered you Hallelujah I didn't spend much time thinking about you it's an honest question how much have you remembered the Lord lately we read books and we don't remember Jesus we listen to tapes and we don't remember Jesus but as we approach this Psalm you can begin to play something softly do this in remembrance of me can we bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord this Lord exhalation to set the communion in order Lord to search ourselves Lord the scripture says let every man examine himself Lord your prophet in that message communion on December 12th 1965 he said Lord the worthiness is not because of our our worthiness but you are the worthy one when we should have been dead you took our place and Lord we are so sorry to have forgotten that Lord when we should have been dead a long time ago we have life today because you live we are alive and Lord some of us have forgotten that we have held on to church and traditions and we have forgotten the real meaning of what this is all about that Jesus you are the reason for everything oh God help us today Lord forgive our past bless our future Lord may you reach into the sucket of every heart Lord as we search and examine our own lives Lord our commitment our Zeal our prayer lives our meditations Lord the way we wake up in the morning the way we go to bed at at night do we practice your presence all day long when the world is caught up in their music and their Styles and the news and the Fashions we can't be caught up in that world because we are not of this world Lord help us to remember you oh God bless us today as we approach Lord this sacred moment father Lord God may you forgive our sins Lord our failures or falling short Lord May the peace of God drop down in every life every heart Lord Lord as we approach this communion and wash one another's feet with humility just as you taught us to do Lord and your prophet he brought it so clear father Lord that this is something that we must do because father you said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you father bring us to the spot where the desire is so real in us to have life Lord so realing us to not just be a church member but to be so Christlike Lord God you set such a supreme example for us Lord we want to be that example we don't want to emulate man we don't want to follow man we want to follow you Christ Jesus Lord we want to remember you every moment of every day Lord Lord when it's so easy to get upset or angry we want to Remember You Lord that our
