[12:30] thank you so much brother anthony
[12:32] with a
[12:34] presence what's an anointing in this
[12:36] place
[12:37] can we just bow our heads
[12:39] for a word of prayer tonight
[12:41] and uh if you have a need
[12:44] you
[12:45] hold that in your heart and let us
[12:47] approach the throne of grace together
[12:51] can we just bow our heads we would have
[12:53] prayed our gracious heavenly father we
[12:55] thank you for life
[12:57] we thank you for strength
[12:59] we thank you for your grace we thank you
[13:01] for your love
[13:03] we thank you for your mercy
[13:05] great is
[13:07] your faithfulness
[13:09] lord we don't have the words to express
[13:12] our gratitude
[13:14] for bringing us to this spot
[13:16] lord not simply this room but this spot
[13:19] in our lives
[13:20] and this great intersection of our
[13:22] journeys
[13:24] that you have seen fit to bring us
[13:26] together
[13:27] under the canopy of life
[13:30] lord under the covering of your blood
[13:32] that could speak better things for us
[13:35] and the very best of our expressions
[13:38] could ever say to you
[13:40] we thank you for your blood
[13:42] we thank you for the truth that has been
[13:44] revealed to us
[13:46] that has us
[13:47] with such a confidence in the midst of
[13:50] our trials
[13:51] with a hope
[13:53] in the midst of our pressures
[13:55] lord there are so many afflictions and
[13:57] the bible says many
[13:59] are the afflictions of the righteous
[14:03] we have grown to understand that it is
[14:06] part of the process
[14:08] but father we all need more grace and
[14:10] more strength to deal with the
[14:13] many trials we have to deal with so i
[14:15] pray tonight you strengthen your people
[14:17] through your word
[14:19] lord i don't have any thoughts it's your
[14:21] word
[14:22] your love letter your expression of your
[14:24] thoughts that you have left with us all
[14:25] these years
[14:27] we have it in our homes we have it on
[14:29] shelves we have it on mobile devices
[14:32] but lord i pray tonight you would walk
[14:33] out the pages of the bible
[14:36] lord that this written word
[14:39] when in combination with the revealed
[14:41] word
[14:42] lord fire could speak into it into our
[14:44] lives that
[14:46] it becomes a living reality to us so
[14:48] father we commit this
[14:50] bible study into your hands may you
[14:52] bless those that are here bless those
[14:53] that would join us and at the end of
[14:56] this service may we be better christians
[14:58] may we be better men better women
[15:01] lord may we become more mature more
[15:03] sensitive to the still small voice and
[15:06] we'll put away childish things and
[15:08] irrational behavior and impulsive
[15:10] behavior to be more measured christians
[15:14] where we think before we speak and we
[15:16] pray before we act father so we give
[15:19] this service over to you and we thank
[15:20] you for a finished work lord that you
[15:23] have already done you've already seen
[15:25] this service before it even took place
[15:27] and you know the outcome so father we we
[15:29] want to surrender our will to your will
[15:31] tonight and the lord we give you honor
[15:33] we give you glory and we give you thanks
[15:35] in the precious name of jesus christ
[15:36] amen and amen amen
[15:39] so greetings tonight in the precious
[15:41] theme of jesus christ it's a great
[15:43] privilege and an honor to be back in
[15:45] fellowship one more time
[15:46] um in this bible study and i trust that
[15:50] you are having a wonderful day that you
[15:53] having a wonderful week
[15:55] and that
[15:57] you were able to take advantage of the
[15:59] holiday yesterday
[16:00] if you had the opportunity to have the
[16:02] holiday
[16:04] and to
[16:05] to break the routine of work and the
[16:06] schedule of life and maybe relax and
[16:08] take a pause
[16:10] a sailor it's so important
[16:12] to take that opportunity to rest and and
[16:14] there's nothing wrong with resting
[16:17] nothing wrong with taking a break
[16:19] jesus had to rest
[16:20] but random love to go and hunt and do
[16:22] different things to just just get you
[16:25] away from the hustle and the bustle
[16:27] you know it's so easy to get caught up
[16:29] in a
[16:30] in the race
[16:31] some people call it the rat race
[16:33] and the the living of life in a schedule
[16:36] and a piece and these things so
[16:38] these interruptions allow us to pause to
[16:40] reflect to think to meditate to ponder
[16:43] to ask questions and i trust that this
[16:46] interruption tonight
[16:48] is such that we'll ask a question and
[16:50] we'll pause and we'll reflect and we'll
[16:51] think and reconsider certain things so
[16:54] by the grace of god i want to connect to
[16:57] the message from on sunday and i trust
[16:59] that it was a blessing to you
[17:02] um the transformation of peter and what
[17:05] it means for us
[17:06] i was sharing with brother over after
[17:08] the service
[17:09] that
[17:10] it is really a mind-blowing thing
[17:12] because growing up and this is my
[17:14] personal experience
[17:16] as much as you hear that the prophets
[17:19] and those who went before were normal
[17:22] we never really accepted it as normal at
[17:24] least for me
[17:25] you always felt that peter and all these
[17:28] men
[17:28] were just a bit
[17:30] very special we we know everybody
[17:32] special you know but they were just you
[17:34] just couldn't see
[17:36] you know you and them in the same
[17:38] category you know men of like passion
[17:41] and men who went through their own ups
[17:42] and downs and their you know their own
[17:44] struggles but as you go deeper
[17:47] into studying all of these characters in
[17:49] scripture
[17:50] you realize that
[17:52] every one of them had their struggles
[17:55] every one of them had their challenges
[17:58] every one of them were confronted with
[18:00] situations that they didn't even know
[18:02] how to respond and
[18:04] and um
[18:05] you know even today i was just thinking
[18:07] back about peter and
[18:09] you know the message on sunday and what
[18:11] he went through so i kind of want to
[18:12] connect with that kind of talk a little
[18:14] bit before i get into the substantive
[18:16] text tonight because by going to the
[18:18] substantive text it sort of
[18:21] has a different meaning when you
[18:23] understand how god used the man and what
[18:26] the man had to go through you know where
[18:29] ibanum speaks about forgot to do
[18:31] something you have to have men in place
[18:32] to do certain things you have to have
[18:34] men in shape to do certain things so
[18:37] god takes you from your background your
[18:40] family your job your profession
[18:42] you know when you see how god operates
[18:44] very bad i'm typed out that when god
[18:46] wanted to express himself in all the
[18:48] letters in the new testament he had to
[18:50] find a writer and that writer was paul
[18:53] paul was an educated man who was able to
[18:55] express certain things and when you go
[18:58] through scriptures even the four gospels
[19:00] you know and you read the book of
[19:01] matthew i was having a conversation on
[19:03] this you know that that the lord's
[19:06] prayer when you look at the way matthew
[19:08] expressed it you know he he said forgive
[19:10] us our debts and then and and in another
[19:13] book is forgive us our sins but machi
[19:15] was a tax collector he used the language
[19:18] that he was familiar with
[19:20] you know as a financial mind um and even
[19:24] in all of the books the the the the
[19:26] story of the talent is only found in
[19:28] matthew because that's that's the
[19:30] reference that
[19:31] maybe resonates with him in such a way
[19:33] because and all of the parallels are
[19:35] tied to how god used individuals in
[19:38] their sphere of life
[19:40] you know where god plays them and that's
[19:42] why when the prophets say god will adopt
[19:44] a housewife he will he will adopt the
[19:46] farmer he will abduct and it really in
[19:48] whatever place you are at
[19:50] you have to realize that there's no
[19:52] accident with god and god placed your
[19:54] diet for him to get the glory and for
[19:57] you to be a manifested son or a
[20:00] manifested daughter in the middle of
[20:02] your neighborhood
[20:04] when nobody else could have stood there
[20:06] you have a certain something to stand in
[20:09] your job in your family whether you are
[20:12] one of 29 people there's just something
[20:15] about your makeup your constitution your
[20:17] dna
[20:18] that has you standing and and that to me
[20:21] is what resonates when you look at
[20:24] the unlikely people who made it you know
[20:26] by the brand when they get to the other
[20:27] side you can see people who
[20:29] you want to know how they made it over
[20:32] because you know they may have been
[20:34] unlikely to succeed you know when you
[20:36] when they go to school and in your last
[20:38] year school you have teachers so say
[20:40] well this student is most likely to
[20:41] succeed and then you have those who you
[20:43] just say a prayer for them
[20:45] because you already don't know where
[20:47] they're going to end up you know but i
[20:49] thank god that many of us who maybe they
[20:51] said a prayer for us because they were
[20:53] not sure where we would end up by the
[20:55] grace of god the third pull is for the
[20:57] weaker ones so by coming to our little
[21:00] conversations around your word it's to
[21:02] reinforce and for us to pause and to
[21:04] think
[21:05] you know about these characters in
[21:07] scripture because every scripture is for
[21:09] encouragement every scripture is for
[21:11] correction every scripture is for us to
[21:13] get advice and for us to reference the
[21:16] fact that there is a precedent
[21:18] and precedent in law means a matter took
[21:21] place in the past that was acceptable in
[21:24] the court that could not be referenced
[21:26] to defend your position
[21:28] that's why when a when a judge makes a
[21:31] new ruling that has not been ruled that
[21:33] there was no ruling of that nature
[21:35] before and it now becomes accepted as
[21:37] pressing and it's such a careful
[21:39] decision because anybody in the future
[21:42] can reference that precedent to defend
[21:44] their case can i give that can i talk
[21:46] about that again one more time i want us
[21:49] to understand this whenever a judge
[21:51] makes a ruling on a matter for the very
[21:54] very first time there is no record of it
[21:57] your honor i want to present this case
[21:59] but there is no precedent there's no way
[22:02] you could deal with it a certain way but
[22:03] when that judge
[22:05] now makes a ruling that no is now
[22:08] admitted as a new president
[22:10] everybody who comes after could
[22:13] reference that ruling
[22:15] as a foundation for their defense
[22:17] so when we can look through scripture
[22:19] and see what david went through and what
[22:22] joshua went through and what moses went
[22:24] through and what peter went through and
[22:26] how god dealt with them
[22:29] and the precedent that was established
[22:31] with how god dealt with them it gives us
[22:33] faith courage and confidence that if god
[22:36] could do it for peter and for david and
[22:39] for john and elijah he could do it for
[22:41] me too
[22:43] can the church say amen if them brothers
[22:45] could make mistakes and god could redeem
[22:47] them
[22:48] my
[22:49] you mean god to redeem me too
[22:52] that to me is a great encouragement
[22:55] so i was
[22:56] there there was something that didn't
[22:57] get to express
[22:59] in sunday service and
[23:00] the lord had it that i just want to kind
[23:02] of touch some of it a little bit
[23:04] and the way i like to approach things
[23:07] with scripture is just kind of think it
[23:09] through
[23:10] and look at it
[23:12] as if i was there
[23:15] you know and you look at
[23:17] and i'm just going to take a few
[23:18] highlights before i get to it but i'm
[23:20] just trying to think and i want this to
[23:22] drive with me a little bit to
[23:24] when they came to get jesus
[23:28] and peter draw his sword
[23:31] and chop off the man is
[23:34] now this was not brother clarence in the
[23:36] beginning of peter's journey with the
[23:38] lord
[23:40] so before i even deal with the fact that
[23:42] peter chop all the man is i still trying
[23:44] to understand why peter still
[23:46] think he need to carry a weapon
[23:49] when he is coming
[23:52] to
[23:52] when he is under just think of it after
[23:56] you've seen
[23:57] you seen all kind of miracle you've seen
[24:00] what manner of man is this that even you
[24:02] win and he see obey him
[24:04] but peter still feel he need to be
[24:07] carrying a shank carrying a knife
[24:10] carrying a weapon
[24:12] was it for trying to process
[24:15] what is going through peter's mind
[24:17] that morning that peter decided to get
[24:19] up put a blade in his waist to head to
[24:22] service with jesus after three and a
[24:24] half years
[24:25] and that the instinctive response
[24:28] when they came for jesus
[24:31] was not pray for the brother not try to
[24:33] reason with a man not try to have a
[24:35] conversation with a man but peter
[24:37] decided to draw a sword
[24:39] and chop off the man ears
[24:43] and he realized the humanness of the man
[24:45] and
[24:46] as i'm studying it i'm saying but wait a
[24:48] minute
[24:49] the issue with peter is it it is almost
[24:52] like a child
[24:54] expressing themselves
[24:56] so so so the child say lord if you bid
[24:59] me to come and for that moment of glee
[25:01] and excitement and and and i really
[25:04] wonder how the other brothers used to
[25:06] view peter and what is the processing
[25:08] because it is significant and the reason
[25:10] i'm highlighting it again
[25:12] is throughout all of scripture
[25:15] the stature of a perfect man is a
[25:17] foundational truth for us
[25:20] god didn't have paul preach that message
[25:24] he didn't have matthew who preached that
[25:26] message he didn't have he reserved that
[25:29] message to this rock called peter to
[25:31] preach his message and i wanted to see
[25:33] how god worked through the man and more
[25:36] importantly i call it the maturing of a
[25:38] son
[25:40] because the version of peter that was
[25:43] going through these things and these
[25:44] stages one would think
[25:46] that after a month with jesus this is
[25:48] not a month with brother within him this
[25:50] is not a month with a with the prophet
[25:52] in him this is jesus one would think
[25:54] after a month two months six months a
[25:56] year
[25:57] in a program even at university degree
[25:59] is three years
[26:01] four years in some cases
[26:03] one would think that at the end of jesus
[26:06] ministry which is the point when they
[26:08] came to get jesus that
[26:11] peter would have ironed out certain
[26:13] rough parts
[26:16] anybody with me
[26:18] and it just resonates to me
[26:21] how much
[26:22] people think they know about themselves
[26:24] under pressure
[26:27] i want to just ponder this a little bit
[26:30] how much people think you know they all
[26:32] say you don't know how you will respond
[26:36] in certain situations and i realized
[26:39] that you know what brother branham said
[26:40] the devil will make you prove every one
[26:42] of these witches
[26:45] so you have the devil testing it and you
[26:47] have god approving it i want us to
[26:49] appreciate the fact that this thing is
[26:51] already a life you know
[26:53] and what peter's life unfolded
[26:56] prior to the upper room
[26:58] was a life that required more change
[27:06] so every day now i'm seeing lord what
[27:08] change
[27:10] is required of me
[27:14] and that should be something that drives
[27:16] us all because the moment you accept
[27:19] your present situation as the equal sign
[27:22] of the destination you lost the examiner
[27:24] you feel
[27:27] because it's a daily work of improvement
[27:29] now i want us to appreciate this and by
[27:32] the branham titus oh he said it was the
[27:34] age of the
[27:35] horse and buggy it was the age of the
[27:38] car it was the age of the airplane is
[27:40] the age of the astronaut and he said the
[27:43] whole world is making progress but the
[27:46] church these spiritual beings want to be
[27:49] moving in a previous level of operation
[27:52] we have made statements before in this
[27:54] same bible study
[27:56] that if you don't know something
[27:59] there is no excuse to not learning
[28:02] there is no excuse to not growing
[28:05] there's no excuse to not changing but it
[28:07] takes a desire in us to want more
[28:10] if we
[28:12] are not inspired to want more there's
[28:14] something wrong with our christian work
[28:17] because every scripture is tighter
[28:22] more grace
[28:23] closer walk
[28:24] deeper desire
[28:26] better experience blessings of the lord
[28:29] and the reality is as is in the natural
[28:33] and in the spiritual whether branham
[28:35] said it like this we are living under
[28:37] our privilege
[28:39] so i'm looking at the fact that peter
[28:42] one thing about peter peter wasn't
[28:44] afraid to try
[28:46] i just having a conversation
[28:48] so peter see jesus walking
[28:51] and what resounds apart from the fact
[28:54] that he had the faith to go out there
[28:56] peter was willing to try
[28:59] and he wasn't even sure of the outcome
[29:01] but he was willing to try
[29:04] so it is not just that peter had fear to
[29:06] know
[29:07] but are you willing to try
[29:11] to try and try again
[29:14] are you willing to take the risk and do
[29:16] what you have not done before
[29:18] are you willing to pick up a book and
[29:20] read willing to it is many things i'm a
[29:23] quiet person i'm a disc i'm a dad and
[29:26] many of us live trapped
[29:29] and peter
[29:30] was not living well i already know these
[29:32] certain things peter was consistent
[29:36] in his approach to being willing to take
[29:39] risks
[29:41] i want us to appreciate that but imam
[29:44] speaks about being reckless in your feet
[29:47] and the recklessness and faith is not
[29:50] doing irrational things and jumping off
[29:52] a building and no no no no no but it's
[29:54] putting fear to the test
[29:56] to be able to try god
[29:58] plead for your family
[30:00] find new words to speak to your children
[30:03] you never tried before anybody with me
[30:05] tonight
[30:06] i just laid i just pulling still from
[30:08] the life of peter to see
[30:12] maybe get to see another side of it
[30:15] because the pizza that started and
[30:17] evolved and repeated and wrote first and
[30:19] second peter is just a mind-blowing
[30:22] transformation
[30:24] mind-blowing transformation
[30:27] from the way he spoke and the way he
[30:29] acted and the way he walked to a measure
[30:32] it's almost like he took a random person
[30:34] and turned him into that sniper
[30:36] because by the time you read first a
[30:38] second peter there's no misplaced words
[30:42] it is very deliberate
[30:44] he has gone through some stuff
[30:47] that you can't move him anymore
[30:50] anybody with me he has been pleased he
[30:53] has been shaped he has been horned
[30:56] that even when his wife didn't cook for
[30:58] him he just went and lay down and
[31:00] meditate and god open up himself to him
[31:03] that was uncharacteristic of the man
[31:05] peter before his transformation anybody
[31:07] with me
[31:15] brother peter
[31:19] in every aspect of his life i'll go back
[31:21] to my transfiguration i'm just touching
[31:22] a few of these points before i get to my
[31:24] substantive scripture tonight
[31:27] i told myself i wasn't going to be too
[31:28] long
[31:31] peter sees jesus no i try to stand up
[31:35] there
[31:36] if i was there
[31:37] he sees jesus
[31:39] moses
[31:42] elijah
[31:44] and peter
[31:47] with the best he could face you know
[31:48] what this is spiritual you know this is
[31:50] something happening
[31:53] let us make a tabernacle
[31:56] but you know what not one
[31:58] not two let me make three whole
[32:01] tabernacles
[32:03] and i'm trying to understand now in
[32:05] principle
[32:07] peter was trying to reconcile
[32:10] the spiritual happening
[32:13] with his understanding
[32:15] i want us to appreciate this
[32:17] and i said on sunday lord willing the
[32:19] lord jesus ignored his statements
[32:22] but peter himself is trying to come into
[32:24] terms with
[32:26] what is happening around him
[32:29] and i say but why didn't god say peter
[32:32] the wrong doctrine why why didn't jesus
[32:34] punish him for saying that that
[32:35] statement
[32:37] and i tell i realize you know god
[32:40] when god is honing you and training you
[32:42] and it is not always be beat he allows
[32:45] us to make mistakes and it's okay to not
[32:47] know
[32:50] you know some of us parents parents feel
[32:52] they need this they're supposed to know
[32:56] but many times it is okay to say you
[32:58] don't know you know
[33:01] i hope this frees somebody
[33:04] it is okay to sometimes not know because
[33:07] peter didn't know he trying to make
[33:09] sense of his world
[33:13] last one before we get into these
[33:14] substances
[33:18] last supper
[33:20] all the brothers
[33:22] go on upstairs
[33:24] it did not delegate somebody to wash
[33:26] feet
[33:28] anybody could have done it
[33:31] nobody did it
[33:35] everybody with me
[33:38] jesus decides
[33:39] to start to do it
[33:42] now the fact that jesus start to decide
[33:45] to do it will make anybody uncomfortable
[33:49] because this is now close to the end of
[33:51] his ministry it's like a shocking thing
[33:52] to see so but i starting to feel a
[33:54] little guilty and thing
[33:56] because if jesus doing it
[33:59] maybe i should already do it you know
[34:02] when jesus gets to peter
[34:05] peter say lord i'm not worthy for you to
[34:07] wash my feet
[34:09] and you know and
[34:11] based
[34:12] at that point in time what peter said
[34:15] make sense to him
[34:17] i'm not worthy
[34:19] i know who you are
[34:21] and when jesus said if i don't do this
[34:24] if you don't allow me to do this if you
[34:26] don't
[34:27] be part of this thing
[34:31] when peter hear that
[34:33] because they were lord hear them even so
[34:36] don't just watch my feet you know just
[34:39] build me just pour this thing in
[34:41] and i'm just watching
[34:43] the
[34:44] child like call it childlike fear the
[34:46] child like understanding the childlike
[34:49] attitude
[34:50] the willingness
[34:51] in every single situation i realized
[34:54] peter
[34:55] whether he was right or wrong
[34:58] he was all in
[35:01] can we just appreciate that for a minute
[35:04] whether he fully understood or he didn't
[35:06] understand the significance the
[35:08] importance of it he was all in
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] i mean i've shared it before in this
[35:14] bible study some time ago about the
[35:16] story of hermann cortes
[35:20] hermann cortez for those who study
[35:22] history
[35:23] was one of these spanish explorers
[35:26] who came into south or central america i
[35:29] believe it was into mexico or whatever
[35:30] it was
[35:32] and
[35:34] when he landed he told his captains
[35:36] here's what go burn the boots
[35:40] because if you're burning boats and
[35:43] there's no way to get back to where we
[35:44] come from the men now have no choice
[35:48] but to go forward
[35:51] and the reality is when you really
[35:53] understand and i look at this thing
[35:55] called all in
[35:56] and a hundred percent
[35:58] and
[35:59] really whatever you're doing whether
[36:02] it's your business your marriage your
[36:04] family serving the lord
[36:06] there's a huge difference in the outcome
[36:09] when you do 40 percent 50
[36:12] or you go all in
[36:16] and the one thing i admire about peter
[36:18] there's so many things is pizza was a
[36:20] all-in kind of person
[36:23] i'm tired of people who always ready to
[36:25] give up
[36:29] right the training tower you know what
[36:31] the reason is and this is what roman
[36:33] cortes
[36:35] identified and it's also tied to peter
[36:37] because when you read luke 5 when peter
[36:41] said he left everything the bible said
[36:43] and follow jesus
[36:45] he had no backup plan it was follow
[36:47] jesus and leave everything else behind
[36:51] command court has created a situation by
[36:54] shutting down the opportunity for
[36:57] retreat
[36:58] it focused all of their attention on how
[37:01] do we win
[37:04] sometimes you have to figure out how to
[37:06] close the retreats
[37:10] how to blow up the bridge behind you to
[37:13] force you to figure out what the next
[37:15] step looks like
[37:17] i will close all this part by saying
[37:19] this
[37:19] god didn't tell adam a play-by-play ball
[37:23] by ball commentary advisory on how he
[37:26] should do and what decisions he should
[37:28] make and all these things
[37:30] adam's job was to figure it out
[37:34] walk by faith and figure it out it is
[37:37] impossible for us to know everything
[37:39] but if you walk by feet and figure it
[37:41] out you'll achieve something
[37:45] everybody feeling fine
[37:47] few little thoughts to encourage you a
[37:48] little bit so let's go first peter 1.
[38:00] first peter 1 verse 1
[38:02] we're gonna spend some time in the book
[38:04] of first peter tonight
[38:06] and we'll see how much the lord will
[38:08] have us do peter an apostle of jesus
[38:10] christ
[38:12] to these strangers scattered throughout
[38:15] pontus galatia cappadocia asia
[38:19] bithya
[38:21] elect
[38:22] according to the full knowledge of god
[38:24] the father
[38:25] through sanctification of the spirit
[38:28] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[38:32] blood of jesus christ
[38:33] grace unto you and peace be multiplied
[38:38] this right in here is not the fisherman
[38:41] who on citizen of himself
[38:44] this is some solid salutation
[38:48] i want to read those first two verses in
[38:50] the amplified peter an apostle
[38:54] special messenger
[38:56] personally chosen representative of
[38:58] jesus christ to those elect
[39:01] both jewish and gentile believers
[39:04] who live as exiles
[39:07] scattered throughout pontus galatia
[39:10] cappadocia asia minor and bithyo who are
[39:13] chosen according to the full knowledge
[39:15] of god the father
[39:17] by the sanctifying work of the spirit
[39:22] i want to suggest that by the
[39:24] sanctifying work of the spirit to be
[39:26] obedient
[39:27] to jesus christ
[39:28] and to be sprinkled with his blood may
[39:31] grace and peace
[39:34] that special sense of spiritual
[39:37] well-being
[39:38] do you have a special sense of spiritual
[39:41] well-being it is it is well with my soul
[39:44] anybody with me tonight
[39:47] he said may grace and peace that special
[39:50] sense of spiritual well-being be yours
[39:53] in increasing
[39:54] abundance you see what i'm talking about
[39:56] increase and growth
[39:58] as you walk closely with god that is
[40:01] that peace be multiplied
[40:03] so i want us to understand grace unto
[40:05] you and peace be multiplied so the grace
[40:08] and the peace
[40:10] that
[40:11] peter is speaking about that he's
[40:13] extending as greetings
[40:16] is not something that is even fixed in
[40:20] time or fixed in quantity or fixed in
[40:23] that moment
[40:24] but he is saying let it be multiplied in
[40:26] other words let the peace that comes
[40:29] through this gospel be ever increasing
[40:32] let the grace that is associated with
[40:35] this gospel be ever increasing that's
[40:37] why as believers it is unacceptable for
[40:40] you to be walking around sad and
[40:42] depressed and frustrated and you don't
[40:43] know where you're going because grace
[40:45] and peace is supposed to be multiplying
[40:47] in your life
[40:48] anybody with me
[40:50] verse 3
[40:52] blessed be the god and father of our
[40:54] lord jesus christ which according to his
[40:57] abundant mercy
[41:00] hath begotten us again
[41:02] under a lively hope
[41:04] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[41:07] the dead
[41:08] i'm going to read it and i'm just going
[41:09] to keep going verse by verse
[41:12] and i want to capture it in the
[41:13] amplified and i want you to begin to see
[41:16] yourself
[41:17] and see now this transformed the peter
[41:20] as he's beginning to build up into this
[41:23] great
[41:24] expression of the revelation of his fate
[41:27] that he would have had by virtue of
[41:30] being under jesus ministry
[41:33] being there in the upper room being his
[41:35] own trials and testing on his honing so
[41:37] let's go blessed gratefully praised and
[41:41] adored be the god and father of our lord
[41:43] jesus christ
[41:44] who according to his abundant and
[41:47] boundless mercy has caused us to be born
[41:50] again
[41:51] that is to be reborn from above
[41:54] spiritually transformed
[41:57] now you see this is this is his that's
[41:59] that that's what i've said peter's
[42:01] writing is also his testimony
[42:04] that is to be reborn from above
[42:06] spiritually transformed renewed and set
[42:10] apart for his purpose my
[42:12] to an ever living hope and confident
[42:16] assurance through the resurrection of
[42:18] jesus christ from the dead that's was
[42:20] three
[42:22] verse four to an inheritance
[42:25] incorruptible
[42:26] and undefiled and that faith is not a
[42:29] way
[42:30] reserved in heaven for you
[42:33] who are kept by the power of god through
[42:35] faith unto salvation ready to be
[42:38] revealed in the last time
[42:41] wherein he greatly is rejoice though now
[42:45] for a season if need be here in
[42:48] heaviness through manifold temptations
[42:52] so in the amplifier it says in this you
[42:53] rejoice greatly
[42:55] even though now for a little while if
[42:58] necessary you have been distressed by
[43:00] various trials is there anybody been
[43:02] distressed by various trials
[43:05] so peter wrapping that all up and saying
[43:08] in this you rejoice graciously you know
[43:10] you'll greatly rejoiced because of the
[43:12] shielding of the power when you read the
[43:15] amplified from verse 4 born anew into an
[43:18] inheritance which is imperishable
[43:22] the amplified says beyond the reach of
[43:24] change so it means your inheritance
[43:26] can't even change oh you don't hear me
[43:28] tonight
[43:30] your inheritance cannot even change
[43:32] the promise of god about you can't even
[43:35] change what god have in store for you
[43:37] can even change
[43:38] hallelujah an undefiled and unfeeling
[43:42] reserved in heaven for you
[43:46] peter is just this is a foundation this
[43:48] is the pa even gone into the people
[43:50] thinking yes or no he just talking about
[43:51] what is reserved for you
[43:53] who are being protected and shielded by
[43:56] the power of god through your faithful
[43:59] salvation that is be that is ready to be
[44:02] revealed for you in the last time
[44:05] in this you rejoice greatly even though
[44:08] now for a little while if necessary you
[44:12] have been distressed by various trials
[44:15] verse seven
[44:17] let's go that the trial of your fate
[44:20] this should be an encouragement to you
[44:22] who have been holding on you who have
[44:24] been fighting
[44:25] that the trial of your feet
[44:28] being much more precious than of gold
[44:31] and perish it though it be tried with
[44:33] fire might be found unto praise and
[44:36] honor and glory at the appearing of
[44:39] jesus christ let's read that in the
[44:40] amplified
[44:42] so that the listen to these words now so
[44:44] that the genuineness of your faith
[44:48] how genuine is your faith
[44:51] so now peter is talking about the
[44:52] quality of your feet
[44:55] now you remember when peter walked under
[44:57] water
[44:59] jesus asked him why i'm to your face you
[45:00] know why did you doubt
[45:03] so it shows that faith could be a
[45:04] resource that has declined fear could
[45:07] increase
[45:08] faith could be there for a minute and it
[45:09] fleets away so pretty saying here so
[45:12] that the genuineness of your feet
[45:16] which is much more precious than gold
[45:18] which is perishable
[45:20] even though tested the testing of your
[45:23] feet and purified by fire
[45:26] may be found to result in your praise
[45:28] and glory and honor at the revelation of
[45:31] jesus christ
[45:32] now i like verse eight
[45:35] whom having not seen
[45:37] he loves
[45:39] you you you you catch that we'll get it
[45:41] amplified shortly in whom though now you
[45:43] see him not yet believing
[45:47] this he no writing like no fisherman
[45:48] here
[45:49] in whom having not seen ye love
[45:53] in whom though now you see him not yet
[45:55] believing let's catch that in the
[45:57] amplified though you have not seen him
[46:00] you love him
[46:02] and though you do not even see him now
[46:05] you believe and trust in him it's not
[46:07] what faith is not your testimony
[46:09] anybody with me
[46:11] hallelujah
[46:12] so whom having not seen your love so
[46:14] yeah you haven't seen him but you love
[46:16] him
[46:17] even now
[46:19] you see him not yet you believe
[46:21] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[46:24] full of glory
[46:25] receiving the end of your faith even the
[46:28] salvation of your souls
[46:31] you greatly rejoice and delight with
[46:34] inexpressible and glorious joy receiving
[46:38] as the result the outcome the
[46:40] consummation of your faith and salvation
[46:43] of your souls
[46:44] verse 10
[46:46] listen to this now peter is preaching
[46:48] jews and gentile alike this is a message
[46:51] he preaching for us
[46:53] and i'll show you of which salvation the
[46:55] prophets have inquired
[46:57] and searched diligently
[47:00] who prophesied of the grace that should
[47:02] come unto you
[47:04] let me read it again regarding the
[47:06] salvation in the amplified the prophets
[47:08] who prophesied about the grace of god
[47:12] that was intended for you
[47:14] searched carefully and inquired about
[47:17] this future way of salvation
[47:21] so peter was saying now with an
[47:23] authority all them prophets who go on in
[47:25] the past been searching for this way
[47:27] that i'm talking about here now
[47:29] anybody with me
[47:31] verse 11 searching what
[47:34] or what manner of time
[47:36] the spirit of christ which was in them
[47:39] did signify
[47:41] you see how deep peter's teaching is
[47:44] so peter is saying
[47:46] searching what or what manner and the
[47:48] spirit of christ was in them that
[47:50] signified when it testified beforehand
[47:53] the sufferings of christ and the glory
[47:55] that should follow let's read it to me
[47:57] amplified
[47:58] seeking to find out what person or what
[48:02] time the spirit of christ within them
[48:04] was indicating
[48:06] as he foretold the sufferings of christ
[48:09] and the glories they're starting to
[48:11] follow
[48:13] verse 12
[48:14] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[48:18] themselves
[48:20] my lord
[48:21] so peter is making it clear to them that
[48:23] they're prophets of old
[48:25] they were trying to figure out if it was
[48:26] for them
[48:28] and that's why i said when i preached
[48:29] about paul and paul was saying we who
[48:32] are alive and remember paul thought he
[48:34] was in that to them
[48:36] not even realizing that he was speaking
[48:38] about us to come
[48:40] so peter is saying all them prophets
[48:42] will go on before we're trying to figure
[48:44] out what what men what manner of time
[48:47] and people saying it wasn't even for
[48:48] them
[48:50] and peter said it's not for that group
[48:52] here
[48:53] let's go
[48:55] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[48:57] themselves but unto us did administer
[49:00] the things which are now reported unto
[49:01] you
[49:02] by them that have preached the gospel
[49:04] unto you with the holy ghost sent from
[49:07] heaven
[49:08] which things that the angels desire to
[49:11] look into my lord help us
[49:14] everybody feeling fine
[49:18] i want to read verse 12 really amplified
[49:19] i hope you're riding with me
[49:22] it was revealed to them that their
[49:24] services their prophecies regarding
[49:26] greece were not meant for themselves and
[49:28] their time but for you in these things
[49:32] the death resurrection and glorification
[49:34] of jesus which have now been told to you
[49:38] by those who preach the gospel to you by
[49:40] the power of the holy spirit who were
[49:42] sent from heaven into these things even
[49:45] the angels longed to look
[49:49] so peter was looking peter was actually
[49:52] tying up mysteries
[49:54] from before his time to show that those
[49:56] prophets were all pointing to now
[49:59] pointing to their future they didn't
[50:01] even understand what they were speaking
[50:03] about
[50:04] and just to think peter paul and all of
[50:07] them in their era were speaking
[50:10] also thinking that what they were
[50:13] speaking was going to be present tense
[50:14] because faith is always present tense
[50:17] not even knowing that they were all
[50:19] still pointing to this last great
[50:21] dispensation this gentile anybody with
[50:24] me
[50:25] you see the grace that god has kept all
[50:27] these years short every age and time to
[50:29] bring it to us now
[50:32] so after all of that now
[50:35] peter now ready to preach because he has
[50:37] no later foundation so verse 13 is the
[50:40] first time he starts to give an
[50:42] instruction to them
[50:43] he laid a foundation from verse 1 to
[50:46] verse 12 and now in verse 13
[50:49] he now says wherefore give up the loins
[50:52] of your mind
[50:55] you see where you start with you're
[50:57] thinking
[50:58] good up the loins of your mind in the
[51:01] amplified it says so prepare your mind
[51:03] for action friends when you get up in
[51:06] the morning you have to prepare your
[51:09] mind for action
[51:11] you can't go to work and not be prepared
[51:13] for action you can't go to prayer not be
[51:15] be for action you can't be distracted
[51:18] and and and this move bother you and
[51:20] your mind all over the place and it
[51:22] can't focus on
[51:25] so after all of the foundation that
[51:27] peter laid upon them in verse 13 he now
[51:29] for the first time begin to
[51:32] exhort them on certain anyway say
[51:34] wherefore give up the loins of your mind
[51:38] wherefore good at the loins of your mind
[51:40] be sober
[51:42] and hope to the end
[51:44] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[51:47] you at the revelation of jesus christ i
[51:50] want to read that one more time this is
[51:51] an encouragement to us friends wherefore
[51:54] girl of the loins of your mind one
[51:57] to be sober
[51:59] thirdly and hope to the end
[52:02] for the grace in other words don't don't
[52:04] stop hoping
[52:06] don't ever give up hope that's what you
[52:08] say you know don't stop believing don't
[52:11] stop holding on for the promise whatever
[52:13] you do
[52:14] anybody with me
[52:17] i want to read that in the amplified so
[52:19] prepare your minds for action
[52:22] be completely sober in spirit
[52:25] steadfast
[52:27] self-discipline
[52:28] spiritually and morally alert fix your
[52:32] hope completely on the grace of god that
[52:35] is coming to you when jesus christ is
[52:38] revealed
[52:40] out of this is lessons and lessons that
[52:43] you need to sit down go to this again
[52:46] many of you have not sat down and go
[52:47] verse by verse into his picture
[52:50] but i wanted to bring us a spot that you
[52:52] look at this transformed man who was an
[52:54] uneducated so to speak fisherman
[52:57] a rough man rough around the edges
[52:59] had his fault had his issue but when god
[53:02] changed him look we're still in the
[53:04] first chapter
[53:06] of first peter and the amount that peter
[53:08] already said here tying back to the
[53:10] prophets time back in the predestination
[53:13] time back into election time back into
[53:15] the new birth all of that
[53:17] optimus 13. let's go verse 14
[53:21] as obedient children
[53:24] could you be obedient are you obedient
[53:27] not fashioning yourselves
[53:30] according to the formal lusts in your
[53:32] ignorance
[53:34] now that's powerful
[53:35] let me read that i want to spend another
[53:37] time here live as obedient children of
[53:40] god in the amplified do not be conformed
[53:44] to the evil desires which governed you
[53:48] in your ignorance before you knew the
[53:51] requirements and transforming power of
[53:54] the good news regarding salvation
[53:58] i want to read that one more time
[54:01] because if you really believe the truth
[54:03] and you really believe this is right
[54:06] then
[54:07] what driving you is
[54:09] as obedient children not fashioning
[54:12] yourself so so this is beyond saying go
[54:14] backslide this is beyond saying don't
[54:16] follow the world of them
[54:18] peter is saying here do not be conformed
[54:21] to the evil desires
[54:24] which you used to operate with when you
[54:27] didn't know
[54:29] in your ignorance
[54:31] it's one thing if you didn't know there
[54:33] were many things peter didn't know there
[54:34] were many things peter didn't understand
[54:36] there are many things peter say and do
[54:38] and act in his ignorance anybody with me
[54:41] but it cannot be a sit down at this
[54:43] level and have this kind of conversation
[54:45] and then go back to
[54:48] the former lost
[54:50] anybody with me tonight
[54:54] are we riding i i forget to check your
[54:56] time yes how are we doing
[54:58] but but but the current i would have
[54:59] making me time because i i'm so focused
[55:02] on this thing i ain't even looking at
[55:03] the clock
[55:04] so i want us to appreciate friends
[55:07] there has to be a line because peter
[55:10] could speak
[55:11] with firm assurance of that separation
[55:14] between the old man and the new man
[55:16] anybody with me the old loss and the new
[55:18] desire the old behavior and his new
[55:21] behavior his old walk and his new work
[55:24] so he's seen as obedient children
[55:27] not fashioning so this fashioning
[55:31] in the king james version which is do
[55:34] not be conformed in the amplified
[55:37] means that and i want us to appreciate
[55:39] this when the holy ghost when the power
[55:41] of god come upon your life you actually
[55:44] have to fashion yourself or conform to
[55:47] go back into the old cell phone
[55:51] only appreciated that
[55:54] is as if a chicken break out of an egg
[55:56] and you there trying to go back in the
[55:58] egg
[56:00] so you're twisting and you're turning
[56:02] and you're trying to fit back into the
[56:04] old self
[56:06] but you come out
[56:08] what you doing living in the old way
[56:11] when
[56:12] that hallway
[56:14] was 4k when he was in ignorance
[56:17] but the 19 ignorance
[56:20] tonight you know better
[56:23] so why you want to live as if you don't
[56:25] know when you really know
[56:27] that's why when we preach we say you
[56:29] don't need us to tell you where you're
[56:30] doing wrong you know what you're doing
[56:31] wrong
[56:33] and you they're trying to fit yourself
[56:36] back in the world
[56:38] but you don't come out
[56:40] you know you know too much
[56:42] you see too much you feel too much of
[56:44] the anointing you've been in too much
[56:46] services and your spirit move and touch
[56:48] your heart a certain way
[56:50] and yet still
[56:52] you have to be reminded
[56:56] to be obedient and don't fashion
[56:59] yourself
[57:02] you're going to wear clothes you're not
[57:03] supposed to wear because you're trying
[57:05] to go back the way you were when you
[57:07] were ignorant you know better you know
[57:09] nobody in this room can tell me they
[57:11] don't know when they put on you wrong
[57:12] clothes you wrong clothes
[57:16] nobody had to tell you the wrong music
[57:18] you know you know is the wrong music
[57:22] anybody with me
[57:25] nobody can tell you when you say the
[57:27] wrong thing you know you say the wrong
[57:28] thing
[57:29] because the experience of whatever level
[57:32] of transformation you have had has
[57:34] exposed you to a new truth and you could
[57:37] no longer operate in ignorance so peter
[57:40] is calling them out on it and he's
[57:42] speaking to believers notice this entire
[57:46] letter is that written to a church
[57:48] members or backsliders or unbelievers
[57:50] you know
[57:51] this is clearly addressed
[57:55] to the elect according to the
[57:58] foreknowledge of god the father through
[58:00] sanctification of the spirit unto
[58:03] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[58:05] jesus christ grace unto you and peace be
[58:08] multiplied this is not your members he
[58:10] is talking to people who've been through
[58:12] some spiritual experiences anybody with
[58:15] me
[58:16] but he's not reminding them get your
[58:19] mind right
[58:20] the pastor can get your mind right for
[58:22] you you have to get your mind right
[58:26] you have to bring your body under
[58:28] subjection you have to understand and
[58:30] identify the formal lust the former
[58:33] appetite the former desire when you
[58:36] didn't know we're not saying it wasn't
[58:38] that way we wasn't saying you didn't
[58:40] know but now you know better
[58:43] let the night be a line of separation
[58:46] hallelujah between that all walk
[58:49] and this conversation we are having
[58:50] tonight anybody with me
[58:54] can we go on a little bit
[58:57] as obedient children
[58:59] i want the nearest thing no no not
[59:02] fashioning yourselves
[59:04] so keep putting a level of work to the
[59:06] signal people working to try to fit into
[59:08] the world you know
[59:11] you're working
[59:12] you're trying to use the language and in
[59:14] the conversation and
[59:21] i remember
[59:22] in school i think it was from one up on
[59:24] two or something i don't even know if i
[59:26] tell that on them this
[59:28] we had no tv in the house
[59:32] but
[59:34] your boy
[59:39] listening to them talk body tv show and
[59:41] thing now
[59:43] but i want to come across as if i'm
[59:46] watching it too
[59:48] so i'm a good student there so
[59:50] i listen i listen until i know all the
[59:52] characters
[59:55] i see tv show yesterday
[59:57] but i must really be characters better
[59:59] than them
[1:00:00] because i had to study it to have a
[1:00:02] conversation with them about the tv show
[1:00:05] you have to know the characters
[1:00:07] so by time
[1:00:09] we they're talking hey boyer see what
[1:00:12] joe do boy
[1:00:13] i say but joyce something that you
[1:00:14] remember when he did so and so and so
[1:00:16] and i could go and recall
[1:00:18] joe from the episode five time ago i
[1:00:20] wasn't in
[1:00:22] but in my own way i didn't want to be
[1:00:25] excluded from the conversation
[1:00:29] but it's real work
[1:00:32] to try to be included in them
[1:00:35] so i want us to appreciate the fact that
[1:00:38] when you look at your life
[1:00:40] and how it had to fit in on your
[1:00:42] workplace and among your family
[1:00:44] gatherings and around different
[1:00:46] situations when you know better
[1:00:49] something has to bolster your back your
[1:00:52] spine to say listen
[1:00:55] the person you know know
[1:00:57] is not the same person who is a hungry
[1:01:00] years ago you know
[1:01:02] and you don't have to even explain
[1:01:03] yourself you have to justify yourself
[1:01:06] you just have to know where you stand
[1:01:07] okay let's go
[1:01:12] we're 16.
[1:01:14] actually actually
[1:01:16] let's go back we still have 14 sorry so
[1:01:18] as obedient children not fasting
[1:01:20] yourself according to the formal loss in
[1:01:21] your ignorance was 15 but as he
[1:01:25] which had called you is holy now this is
[1:01:27] a tall order
[1:01:29] this is when peter gets along it's a
[1:01:30] serious serious thing you know
[1:01:33] but as he would have called you is holy
[1:01:36] so be holy in all manner of conversation
[1:01:42] daddy
[1:01:43] mommy brother sister
[1:01:47] take that in a little bit
[1:01:50] in the amplified
[1:01:55] but like the holy one who called you
[1:01:58] be holy yourselves in all your conduct
[1:02:02] be set apart from the world by your
[1:02:06] godly character and moral courage
[1:02:11] there must be no difference
[1:02:15] in your character
[1:02:18] when you're in church when you're at
[1:02:20] home
[1:02:21] when you're at work
[1:02:23] when you're going to this shop
[1:02:25] it can't be your temper under control
[1:02:27] when you're wrongly bedridden
[1:02:30] because when you're only bedridden
[1:02:31] you're temperance it is true any time
[1:02:32] tamron's gamer
[1:02:34] yes yes you just find that gear when
[1:02:36] you're among your bedroom he's able to
[1:02:38] throw it in let's show it in yes
[1:02:40] yes use all your strength to true in
[1:02:42] that gear
[1:02:43] and
[1:02:44] but when you're not around the bedroom
[1:02:46] and you're in the workplace
[1:02:48] and somebody
[1:02:50] going to your locker somebody thinking
[1:02:52] the temperance gear just do-going
[1:02:54] you're trying your best to but
[1:02:57] the the you that come out
[1:02:59] is like peter when you still have shank
[1:03:01] is peter when he under pressure is peter
[1:03:04] in the old man come out now
[1:03:06] anybody with me but he look at the
[1:03:09] challenge
[1:03:11] peter not saying they're not called
[1:03:13] peter not saying you're not calling not
[1:03:15] elected you're not blood washed peter
[1:03:18] not accusing him of that no but he's
[1:03:19] saying i still want to push you higher
[1:03:22] after you already know the truth about
[1:03:25] who the lord jesus christ is and the
[1:03:27] fact that all the prophets of all were
[1:03:29] pointed to this aid and when they
[1:03:30] thought it was for them it was ready for
[1:03:32] you he went through all of that with
[1:03:33] them and he still come and say to them
[1:03:35] listen
[1:03:37] because it is written be holy for i am
[1:03:39] holy
[1:03:43] everybody with me
[1:03:50] let's go
[1:03:51] let's go to
[1:03:54] the next verse
[1:03:56] let's go to verse 17 and if you call on
[1:03:58] the father
[1:04:00] who without respect of persons judge it
[1:04:03] according to every man's work
[1:04:06] past the time of your side journeying
[1:04:09] here
[1:04:10] in fear
[1:04:14] in the amplified it says if you address
[1:04:16] as father the one who impartially judges
[1:04:20] according to each man's worked book
[1:04:24] conduct yourselves in reverent fear of
[1:04:26] him that fear is of him
[1:04:29] and with
[1:04:30] profound respect for him
[1:04:33] throughout i like this the time of your
[1:04:35] stay on it
[1:04:38] i love it i love it
[1:04:40] it's as if you're in a hotel this this
[1:04:42] is like a hotel you know
[1:04:44] you're just here you're staying here you
[1:04:46] have a room
[1:04:48] a little room here in this hotel called
[1:04:51] and during his stay he's saying be
[1:04:53] reverent
[1:04:56] have godly fear
[1:04:58] and because of the godly fear
[1:05:00] and because of the reverence it makes
[1:05:02] you respectful it makes you honorable it
[1:05:05] makes you conscious of what you do and
[1:05:07] say i remember saying young people years
[1:05:10] ago
[1:05:10] live
[1:05:12] as if jesus right next to you
[1:05:14] and if he is right next to you all the
[1:05:17] time and you are conscious of his
[1:05:20] presence
[1:05:23] your life will be different you know
[1:05:26] just think about it friends
[1:05:28] think of you walking into your lunch
[1:05:30] room on the job or going to the
[1:05:32] supermarket or you're going to the bank
[1:05:34] and they tell her they're wrong you know
[1:05:36] but jesus next to you
[1:05:39] i'm sure you can find a better way to
[1:05:41] say it
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:44] i'm sure you could put the words
[1:05:45] together in a different structure
[1:05:48] that they could express you what you
[1:05:50] need but you're not coming across like
[1:05:51] somebody in the world anybody with me
[1:05:58] verse 18
[1:05:59] for as much as he know
[1:06:02] again peter is building on what they
[1:06:05] have been taught
[1:06:08] he said for you know in the amplified
[1:06:11] that you were not redeemed from your
[1:06:14] useless
[1:06:15] spiritually unproductive way of life
[1:06:19] inherited by tradition from your
[1:06:20] forefathers
[1:06:22] for as much as you know that you were
[1:06:25] not redeemed with corruptable things as
[1:06:28] silver and gold from your vain
[1:06:30] conversation received by tradition from
[1:06:32] your fathers
[1:06:34] your redemption is not based on your
[1:06:35] family line is that based on your
[1:06:37] achievement is it based on what you have
[1:06:39] done or earned
[1:06:41] but verse 19
[1:06:43] but with the precious blood of christ
[1:06:45] he's reinforcing things they already
[1:06:47] know
[1:06:49] he keeps reconnecting to foundational
[1:06:52] truths so he could push them to become
[1:06:55] better christians
[1:06:58] verse 19 but with the precious blood of
[1:06:59] christ as of a lamb without blemish and
[1:07:02] without spot
[1:07:04] who verily was for ordained before the
[1:07:07] foundation of the world but was manifest
[1:07:10] in these last times for you
[1:07:12] who by him do believe in god that raised
[1:07:16] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[1:07:18] that your faith and hope might be in god
[1:07:23] verse 22
[1:07:25] seeing ye have purified your souls
[1:07:31] in obeying the truth
[1:07:33] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:07:37] of the virgin
[1:07:42] see that you love one another with a
[1:07:44] pure heart fervently
[1:07:46] verse 22
[1:07:48] since by your obedience to the truth
[1:07:52] you have purified yourself so when
[1:07:54] people say to me
[1:07:56] it's a hard life and believe in a
[1:07:59] christian i find myself you know
[1:08:01] struggling with this and have you been
[1:08:03] obedient are you taking this thing to
[1:08:05] heart and saying lord i really want to
[1:08:07] cut all these things i want to stop
[1:08:08] being i want to close the windows
[1:08:11] because the windows and the doors that
[1:08:12] are open to the enemy is what's
[1:08:14] infiltrating your house
[1:08:17] go out there come and i close the window
[1:08:19] and door for you you have to close it
[1:08:22] whether it's music books movies
[1:08:24] conversation relationships friends
[1:08:27] whatever it is
[1:08:28] it can't be we having all these services
[1:08:30] and you still want to receive
[1:08:32] foolishness and expect god to be able to
[1:08:35] bless you a certain kind of way because
[1:08:37] he is holy
[1:08:39] light and darkness can't live in the
[1:08:41] same house
[1:08:42] what are you prepared to give up to make
[1:08:45] jesus comfortable
[1:08:48] that's a reality or question
[1:08:51] accent could you pass your phone to the
[1:08:53] lord and say jesus use my phone
[1:08:59] could you check every you take whatever
[1:09:01] you want to check
[1:09:03] and friends if you had to think twice
[1:09:06] about that you need to look at your life
[1:09:10] could jesus turn on your car and
[1:09:12] wherever you playing on your radio and
[1:09:14] you driving with jesus and you write her
[1:09:16] well
[1:09:16] you know you go by some people and say
[1:09:18] well excuse place there or excuse the
[1:09:20] musica or excuse me they have an excuse
[1:09:22] if you're excusing something excuse this
[1:09:24] excuse that the excuse they say excuse
[1:09:26] me
[1:09:29] could we reach a point where there are
[1:09:31] no more excuses
[1:09:33] that your life becomes transparent what
[1:09:36] you see is what you get that is peter
[1:09:39] whatever steve peter was in peter had no
[1:09:42] deception
[1:09:44] what you see is what you get peter
[1:09:46] believed he need to tabernacle he said
[1:09:47] tree tabernacle james look at him john
[1:09:50] look at them they say we don't even know
[1:09:51] what to say they say nothing
[1:09:54] he's just transparent
[1:09:56] let's go
[1:09:58] since by your obedience to the truth
[1:10:01] god help us to be more obedient
[1:10:03] but i like when brothers say this i like
[1:10:05] him but i said i like him
[1:10:07] but that other thing i do really i
[1:10:09] really take it i don't take it on too
[1:10:11] much you don't take it on too much
[1:10:15] when we know full obedience see the
[1:10:17] entire world entirely usually token you
[1:10:19] are taking it on too much
[1:10:21] you still want to do something in your
[1:10:22] way well it's really it's it's in my
[1:10:25] house and you have all kind of excuses
[1:10:27] and god is looking at that not the
[1:10:28] pastor god looking at that
[1:10:33] since by your obedience to the truth you
[1:10:36] have purified yourselves
[1:10:39] so obedience is tied to purification
[1:10:43] only seen that there
[1:10:45] obedience to the truth is tied to
[1:10:47] purifying yourself so every time you
[1:10:50] obey you would
[1:10:51] you're actually cleaning out your life
[1:10:53] in them
[1:10:56] i hope that resonate in your home i hope
[1:10:57] the young children get to the hobby
[1:10:59] grandparents getting i will be mamas and
[1:11:01] the fathers and the believers the church
[1:11:03] rallies are wrong this thing here
[1:11:06] what word are we obeying tonight
[1:11:08] is what we are doing in obedience to
[1:11:10] god's word our actions
[1:11:13] disobedient to god's word
[1:11:16] will god be pleased by this
[1:11:18] some of us more interested in what your
[1:11:20] boss
[1:11:22] like and don't like than what god like
[1:11:24] and don't like
[1:11:26] you're up late at night during report
[1:11:28] your update all kind of thing you're
[1:11:30] doing for natural man
[1:11:32] and god
[1:11:35] wants to be pleased to say this is my
[1:11:38] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[1:11:42] that pleasing that statement that
[1:11:45] was part of what peter experienced
[1:11:49] untransfiguration witness the adoption
[1:11:51] of christ
[1:11:53] is only obedient sons getting that in
[1:11:55] them
[1:11:56] oh come on now only obedient daughters
[1:11:58] get in that not attendance in church or
[1:12:01] reading books or listening to tapes or
[1:12:03] shouting it's a product of obedience
[1:12:08] let's go still in verse 22
[1:12:11] since by your obedience
[1:12:14] to the truth you have purified
[1:12:17] yourselves
[1:12:18] for a sincere love of believers of the
[1:12:22] believers
[1:12:25] he's now driving further down the road
[1:12:27] i'm reading any amplified see that you
[1:12:29] love one another from the heart
[1:12:35] always
[1:12:36] unselfishly seeking the best
[1:12:40] for one another
[1:12:44] not god bless you
[1:12:47] and you're already not seeking the
[1:12:48] well-being it is a performance i always
[1:12:51] say he introduced
[1:12:53] if they really really want to do the
[1:12:55] what is the oscars for acting if you
[1:12:57] really want to really get the best
[1:12:58] actors you have to come here
[1:13:04] because people can act apart
[1:13:06] so
[1:13:07] this unfailing love of the virgin he
[1:13:10] said love one another from the heart
[1:13:12] always unselfishly seeking the best for
[1:13:15] one another
[1:13:16] going to verse 23 being born again not
[1:13:20] of corruptible seed
[1:13:24] but of incorruptible verse 23 by the
[1:13:26] word of god
[1:13:28] which live it and abide it forever
[1:13:32] for all flesh is as grass
[1:13:35] and all the glory of man as the flowers
[1:13:38] of grass
[1:13:40] and the grass wither it
[1:13:42] and the flower thereof fall it away
[1:13:45] word of the lord
[1:13:47] endure it forever
[1:13:49] and this is the word which by the gospel
[1:13:52] is preached unto you
[1:13:55] let us jump into
[1:13:57] chapter two
[1:13:58] we have a little more time we want to
[1:14:01] keep driving down the road
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:04] first peter two verse one
[1:14:07] again i want us to
[1:14:09] underscore
[1:14:11] reinforce and remind us who this is
[1:14:14] addressed to we're not going to be too
[1:14:15] much longer
[1:14:16] he is not speaking to random people on
[1:14:18] the street
[1:14:20] he is addressing believers
[1:14:22] but he is challenging them
[1:14:25] just as brother branham's own experience
[1:14:28] with the lord when he realized he had to
[1:14:30] be more sincere
[1:14:32] the issue was not the gift the issue was
[1:14:35] not the anointing the issue wasn't the
[1:14:37] revelation the issue wasn't the
[1:14:39] understanding of the word the issue was
[1:14:41] non-relational it's about a sincerity
[1:14:43] it's about a closer walk is about a
[1:14:45] better behavior about a better conduct
[1:14:48] peter could look back and see how he
[1:14:50] changed
[1:14:51] i'm not what i used to be but are still
[1:14:54] trying to be something more so
[1:14:56] first peter two
[1:14:58] so put aside every trace you see that
[1:15:01] word trace
[1:15:04] trace is not a thing itself you know
[1:15:08] trace is the evidence you think was
[1:15:10] there
[1:15:13] anybody hear me tonight
[1:15:16] he said put aside every trace
[1:15:19] so in other words the male is gonna know
[1:15:24] but i have a little trace you know when
[1:15:25] i see a slug on the ground
[1:15:28] and you see the little remnant that he
[1:15:30] was there
[1:15:31] anybody know what talking about
[1:15:33] he slapped no longer there believer in
[1:15:35] the mark he never traced that he was
[1:15:37] there
[1:15:39] so
[1:15:40] peter is now going deeper into the
[1:15:43] hearts
[1:15:44] and saying
[1:15:45] the malice i know he might let's go on
[1:15:47] nobody have a little
[1:15:48] a little cheese a little a little
[1:15:50] remnant the little thing that has flare
[1:15:52] up from now and then
[1:15:53] i'll get ready to close up so put aside
[1:15:56] every trace
[1:16:04] let me just fix this
[1:16:15] we're folding aside all malice in the
[1:16:17] amplified so put aside every trace of
[1:16:20] malice
[1:16:21] and all guile
[1:16:23] and hypocrisies
[1:16:25] and envies and all evil speakings
[1:16:29] in the amplified so put aside every
[1:16:31] trace of malice and all these seats and
[1:16:35] hypocrisy and envy and
[1:16:38] all slander and hateful speech so in
[1:16:40] other words as a believer
[1:16:43] hateful speech and slander and envy and
[1:16:48] hypocrisy and deceit and malice and the
[1:16:51] trace of these things should not exist
[1:16:57] verse two
[1:16:59] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:17:02] of the wood
[1:17:04] that he may grow thereby
[1:17:08] in the amplified like newborn babies
[1:17:11] you should long for the pure milk of the
[1:17:14] wood
[1:17:16] so he's bringing a
[1:17:17] analogy an example uh a way to compare
[1:17:21] the way to look at at how your conduct
[1:17:23] is supposed to be
[1:17:24] so this whole concept in the message of
[1:17:26] people who sit there as if they were
[1:17:27] taking something and if by ten year any
[1:17:30] messages seniority and a guarantee of
[1:17:32] something if you're like newborn babies
[1:17:35] you should long for the pure milk of the
[1:17:37] word so that by it you may be nurtured
[1:17:40] and grow in respect to salvation
[1:17:43] ultimate fulfillment
[1:17:45] verse 3 if so be he have tasted that the
[1:17:48] lord is gracious
[1:17:51] so he said
[1:17:52] this is conditional or based on
[1:17:56] a previous experience if in fact you
[1:17:58] have already tasted the goodness and
[1:18:01] gracious kindness of the lord so he's
[1:18:03] now appealing he said because maybe this
[1:18:06] is not for you you know it's a real
[1:18:07] preaching you know he said but if you're
[1:18:10] if you would have experienced and tasted
[1:18:12] the goodness of the lord you should be
[1:18:14] able to identify with the fact that you
[1:18:16] should be operating like a newborn babe
[1:18:19] that the world never gets boring to you
[1:18:22] but it's this word that feeds you that
[1:18:24] no matter what situation you're going
[1:18:26] through in life you can find reference
[1:18:28] can be word to keep standing to keep
[1:18:31] your foot firmly planted anybody with me
[1:18:33] tonight
[1:18:38] we almost finished to whom coming as
[1:18:41] unto a living stone
[1:18:43] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:18:46] god and precious
[1:18:48] let's read that to the amplified
[1:18:52] come to him the risen lord as to a
[1:18:56] living stone which men rejected and
[1:18:59] threw away but which is choice and
[1:19:02] precious in the sight of god verse 5
[1:19:06] ye also as lively stones
[1:19:09] and i broadly type on sunday how peter
[1:19:12] was identified as stone or rock
[1:19:14] unshaped
[1:19:16] and he's now preaching about lively
[1:19:17] stones stones in action
[1:19:20] stones that are moving stones that are
[1:19:22] alive
[1:19:23] ye also as lively stones have built up a
[1:19:27] spiritual house
[1:19:29] and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:19:32] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god
[1:19:35] by jesus christ so there's so many
[1:19:38] things to unpack here in verse 5 but
[1:19:39] let's read it in the amplified first
[1:19:42] you believers
[1:19:44] like living stones are being built up
[1:19:47] into a spiritual house
[1:19:49] for a holy and dedicated priesthood to
[1:19:52] offer spiritual sacrifices that are
[1:19:55] acceptable and pleasing to god truly
[1:19:59] through jesus christ so i want to
[1:20:00] underscore something here
[1:20:02] you can make a sacrifice that is not
[1:20:04] acceptable to god
[1:20:10] jesus himself when he was on earth say
[1:20:12] in vain do they worship me
[1:20:15] that's a scary thought
[1:20:17] that's a scary thought friends
[1:20:19] in vain you're in church
[1:20:24] because your sacrifice
[1:20:26] not being accepted
[1:20:31] you see how serious and grave
[1:20:34] this
[1:20:35] priestly responsibility is on us
[1:20:38] because the priest was instructed
[1:20:41] to bring the sacrifice a certain kind
[1:20:44] away a certain kind of sacrifice in a
[1:20:46] certain kind of order
[1:20:52] getting ready to close out
[1:20:55] verse 6 wherefore also it is contained
[1:20:58] in the scripture
[1:20:59] behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone
[1:21:02] elect
[1:21:03] precious
[1:21:04] and he that believeth on him shall not
[1:21:07] be confounded
[1:21:14] in the amplified behold i'm laying
[1:21:16] inside a chosen stone a precious honored
[1:21:19] cornerstone and he who believes in him
[1:21:22] whoever adheres to trusts in and relies
[1:21:26] on him will never be disappointed in his
[1:21:29] expectations
[1:21:31] friends this gospel we preach is the
[1:21:33] only thing that has satisfaction
[1:21:35] guaranteed
[1:21:38] everything else you do in life you need
[1:21:40] a warranty
[1:21:43] think about five years they give that
[1:21:44] two years a year ten years and then
[1:21:47] the best thing you get
[1:21:49] you have a time limit in it
[1:21:50] but this thing is eternal
[1:21:54] he said never be disappointed in the
[1:21:56] expectations verse seven
[1:21:58] unto you therefore which believe
[1:22:02] and i believe tonight
[1:22:03] i'm speaking to believers
[1:22:05] and we're closing out here
[1:22:08] we're going to close it out of his heat
[1:22:11] until you therefore which believe he is
[1:22:13] precious
[1:22:15] but we know that not everybody believes
[1:22:18] we accept that we have family members
[1:22:20] who don't want to hear this we have
[1:22:21] friends who don't want to hear this you
[1:22:23] have people who left church who don't
[1:22:24] want to hear this they are up to their
[1:22:26] own devices and it is only the grace of
[1:22:29] god that we can see it
[1:22:31] so we cannot judge them and rail on them
[1:22:34] it is the grace of god to us
[1:22:37] and we have to see it from the
[1:22:39] perspective that if it wasn't for the
[1:22:41] grace of god to take the scales of our
[1:22:43] eyes we would be like anybody else
[1:22:45] so we are no better than nobody
[1:22:48] so but unto you therefore which believe
[1:22:50] he is precious
[1:22:53] but unto them which be disobedient
[1:22:56] the stone which the bill is allowed the
[1:22:58] same is made ahead of the corner
[1:23:01] in the amplified this precious value
[1:23:03] then is for you who believe in him as
[1:23:05] god's only son the source of salvation
[1:23:08] but for those who disbelieve the very
[1:23:10] stone which the bill has rejected has
[1:23:13] become the chief cornerstone and verse 8
[1:23:15] and a stone of stumbling
[1:23:18] and a rock of offense
[1:23:21] even to them which stumble at the wood
[1:23:24] my that's a serious one
[1:23:26] we closer with that one
[1:23:31] even though it's something like the word
[1:23:32] being disobedient where unto all so they
[1:23:34] were appointed
[1:23:36] now
[1:23:37] let me read the number five and a stone
[1:23:38] of stumbling and a rock of offense for
[1:23:40] they stumble because they disobeyed the
[1:23:44] word of god
[1:23:45] and to this they who rejected my savior
[1:23:48] were also appointed in other words he is
[1:23:52] separating now peter
[1:23:54] those who just don't believe
[1:23:56] from those who are given the opportunity
[1:23:59] to believe
[1:24:01] but they fear to obey the word
[1:24:05] or they catch that
[1:24:08] a stone of stumbling on a rock of
[1:24:10] offense so people say well well they
[1:24:11] church people or they believe this and
[1:24:13] they have all the issues
[1:24:14] yes we have that
[1:24:16] we're not really trying to talk about
[1:24:17] that right now we're dealing here now
[1:24:19] with a deeper issue
[1:24:21] even to them which stumble afterward now
[1:24:25] being disobedient where unto all so they
[1:24:28] were appointed
[1:24:32] they were given an opportunity to walk
[1:24:34] this walk
[1:24:35] talk this talk
[1:24:37] live this life and just as in the
[1:24:39] teaching and adoption where the tutor is
[1:24:42] dispatched to see the conduct of the sun
[1:24:46] before approving for adoption
[1:24:49] to see if you're a real son
[1:24:51] or you're a vagabond
[1:24:53] remember the prophet brought it out if
[1:24:55] you could sign the father's check
[1:24:59] but the whole adoption ceremony the
[1:25:02] hearing him your secretary's gravity
[1:25:04] father was based on obedience
[1:25:07] so to this point when you compare
[1:25:09] chapter one and this point up to this
[1:25:12] one at chapter two peter was really
[1:25:15] kneeling down a deeper sense of
[1:25:17] obedience of god's word
[1:25:21] because when you know seed as obeying
[1:25:23] god's word all of a sudden you don't
[1:25:26] have issue with the pastor saying
[1:25:27] something or the assistant pastor or the
[1:25:29] elder or the deacon because if it's
[1:25:32] god's word your natural immediate
[1:25:35] instinct factory resetting response is
[1:25:38] yes lord
[1:25:41] i want to dress right i want to live
[1:25:43] right i want to do the writing if i have
[1:25:45] to repent i need to repent
[1:25:48] whatever it is i want to obey
[1:25:50] everybody feeling fine
[1:25:52] so we'll pause here for tonight i trust
[1:25:54] this little
[1:25:57] exhortation bible study would be an
[1:25:59] encouragement to you
[1:26:01] feel free to keep reading
[1:26:03] we're going to spend some time on peter
[1:26:07] by the grace of god by the time we
[1:26:09] finish here you will not only know peter
[1:26:11] the man because we're going to keep
[1:26:12] touching his life
[1:26:14] but the message of the man
[1:26:17] and what measure god gave him
[1:26:19] because every character in scripture god
[1:26:22] gave them a measure and a purpose we
[1:26:24] were not blessed to physically meet
[1:26:26] peter but thank god there's enough in
[1:26:29] matthew mark luke john acts even paul
[1:26:32] speaking about peter and peter speaking
[1:26:34] about paul and then peter's own books
[1:26:37] for us to see this unique character that
[1:26:40] i said within the context of the new
[1:26:42] testament is like a david
[1:26:44] that we could see so much of his life as
[1:26:47] a young man all the way to him saying
[1:26:49] lord
[1:26:50] if i have to get crucified not like my
[1:26:52] lord

[1:27:42] you took a son
[1:27:43] a unlikely apostle as it were a man who
[1:27:47] wasn't readily qualified but you
[1:27:48] qualified him by virtue of a great
[1:27:51] transformation in his spiritual and
[1:27:54] unnatural
[1:27:55] lord we can look back and see what he
[1:27:58] went through and see
[1:27:59] fractions of our lives
[1:28:01] when we didn't know and maybe we tried
[1:28:03] and maybe we gave up and maybe we let go
[1:28:05] but we could also see the outcome the
[1:28:08] expected end the planned end the result
[1:28:11] of predestination the result of election
[1:28:14] the result of calling the result of
[1:28:16] training the result of tutoring the

[1:29:12] the purification
[1:29:13] as a
[1:29:14] blessing and a benefit of obedience and
[1:29:17] see him talking about the stone that is
[1:29:19] rejected by those who just don't believe
[1:29:22] but even lord those who were appointed
[1:29:24] to believe but struggle with the word
