[46:21] you this
[46:22] we thank you we give it a praise we give
[46:25] it a glory Lord we pray a special
[46:27] blessing and every believer that's here
[46:28] this morning those that are on the
[46:30] internet alone me you bless them also
[46:32] those that when he had a deep today
[46:34] repair special blessing on our pastor
[46:37] knock pastor's wife as in Lord of
[46:40] convention in West Palm Beach Florida
[46:41] Lamia continued to be with them under
[46:43] believers over there and may you bless
[46:46] us here today we committed service in
[46:48] their hands in the precious name of
[46:50] Jesus Christ amen amen and the church
[46:53] says
[46:55] amen amen so it happened to be the house
[47:00] of the Lord today happy Davina's
[47:02] presence Amen so this morning we
[47:07] actually gonna go back to the convention
[47:09] you appreciate the convention what a
[47:12] tremendous blessing
[47:14] a man would steal us and you know many
[47:18] times we are doing so many different
[47:20] things during the period of the
[47:21] convention that we might miss one or two
[47:24] things so we don't want to miss anything
[47:25] at all so this morning we're gonna go
[47:27] back your PC but pressured by the Peter
[47:29] Chandler day man it's been a blessing
[47:33] time and time again so but before we get
[47:36] too steep but it's gonna share a few
[47:38] things with you this morning so if you
[47:40] have your Bibles will you turn with me
[47:42] to Ephesians for a reading from verse 1
[47:46] Ephesians 4 and reading from verse 1
[48:02] I therefore just Paul speaking the
[48:07] prisoner of the Lord beseech II that he
[48:10] walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
[48:14] are called I wanna see that again I
[48:19] therefore the prisoner of the Lord so he
[48:22] understands that he has constraints he
[48:25] understands that he has limitations and
[48:27] he's happy to be call a prisoner of the
[48:29] Lord because a prisoner cannot do what
[48:32] he wants to do a prisoner has to exist
[48:35] within the rules the regulations the
[48:37] structure of the prison that he is in
[48:40] and Paul is happy to be a prisoner of
[48:42] the Lord so he doesn't count the
[48:44] constraints that he is in as a problem
[48:47] but he cannot behave any way he wants
[48:49] because he's a prisoner of the Lord he
[48:51] said I beseech you that he walk worthy
[48:53] of the vocation so there's a vocation
[48:56] where he'll call and you have to work
[48:57] worthy of it and he gives the conditions
[49:00] of how that is to be done with all
[49:02] lowliness and meekness with
[49:04] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[49:08] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[49:11] the Spirit in the bond of peace there is
[49:15] one body and one spirit even as ye are
[49:18] called in one hope of your calling one
[49:20] Lord one faith one baptism one God and
[49:25] Father of all who is above all and
[49:27] through all and in you all may the Lord
[49:30] and a blessing to the reading of this
[49:31] word you may be seated for a few minutes
[49:33] just before we play by the Chandler's
[49:35] message this morning and if I were to
[49:38] have a very brief title for this few
[49:41] words before the tape it'll be unified
[49:44] by the word can the church say man
[49:47] unified by the word not unified by
[49:51] movement not unified by pastor not
[49:54] unified by church not unified by group
[49:57] not unified by affiliation not unified
[50:01] by identification but unified by the
[50:03] wood because when we are unified by the
[50:06] word God is pleased can the church say
[50:09] Amen
[50:09] - always had a desire to be United
[50:12] see that the false unity that existed
[50:15] when they try to build the Tower of
[50:17] Babel and we know that man got together
[50:20] and they were unified for one purpose
[50:22] but but abandom said i was a false unity
[50:24] but we need to be united on the one hand
[50:27] united under the word united under the
[50:30] holy ghost' united under the spirit
[50:32] because it's one body and it's one holy
[50:35] spirit and in every church have three
[50:37] kinds of believers so no one Church can
[50:39] see they have it no one should can see
[50:41] the ayats
[50:42] because within that church is three
[50:44] kinds of believers no make believers the
[50:48] unbelievers and the true believers can
[50:50] the chit's amen so we are seeing
[50:53] something happening around the world and
[50:54] we're seeing believers gathering
[50:56] together and it's and it's not something
[50:58] that is force is called doing something
[51:01] when God starts to do something it's not
[51:03] man's activity but God putting a pull on
[51:06] the heart to see let's get together
[51:08] let's do something with the kingdom of
[51:10] God because it's one buddy and it's one
[51:12] spirit it's not man doing and it's not
[51:14] because of who this person is or who
[51:16] that person is but it's because God is
[51:18] doing it can the church say Amen so I

[59:17] hiding for fear of persecution but even
[59:21] though they had external situations and
[59:24] external problems didn't take away the
[59:26] worship that they had in the upper room
[59:27] because the promise was real to them and
[59:30] with the Branham said in his prophetic
[59:32] ministry that the promise of the Holy
[59:33] Ghost is just as real today as it was on
[59:37] the day of Pentecost it's it's not 98%
[59:41] real he said just as real if not 82%
[59:46] real is that it's real for some people

[1:01:40] treat it like we're forced to do it we
[1:01:41] pray because now it has become we have
[1:01:44] become slaves of love you know prisoners
[1:01:48] of love you know when God say worship is
[1:01:51] not like a for stewardship we don't have
[1:01:52] we have because we have been

[1:02:59] different
[1:03:00] Paul wasn't always that way when he was
[1:03:03] all he wasn't that way when he was when
[1:03:05] he thought he was doing right he was
[1:03:07] going any letter of the law and saying I
[1:03:09] don't understand these these people who
[1:03:11] talk about this Christ this Jesus Christ
[1:03:14] thing and he said the persecuted
[1:03:16] brothers he was there feeling good about
[1:03:20] himself when when Stephen E Deacon was
[1:03:22] stoned
[1:03:22] isn't that right but when Cora's ready
[1:03:25] to arrest him somebody say arrest me

[1:03:59] I'm almost wrapping up here now in the
[1:04:03] message to conflict between God and
[1:04:05] Satan but the parent said the true bride
[1:04:08] must be your night unified by the word
[1:04:11] that's where I got the tiger from
[1:04:13] unified by the word there's been many
[1:04:15] kind of unity and unification and
[1:04:17] movements and and if you're not in
[1:04:18] you're out and if you're not here you do
[1:04:22] but it's by the wood now remember if
[1:04:25] she's a part of Christ she has to be the
[1:04:28] word of Christ in order to be the word
[1:04:30] of Christ you have to be baptized into
[1:04:32] place and when you're in Christ you
[1:04:34] believe Christ and Christ is the word

[1:04:59] to stand before the king she didn't
[1:05:01] adorn herself with all the things that
[1:05:03] it offered her she are doing herself

[1:33:02] time inspiration and I'm calling it seed
[1:33:05] in the Sun man it sounds good it sounds
[1:33:10] happy but let's talk about it amen
[1:33:12] because it is the seed that's in the Sun
[1:33:15] and brothers you could just go to the
[1:33:18] next slide
[1:33:19] pretty much when I turn my papers you
[1:33:21] can let's start over here a harvest time
[1:33:22] and I wanted to talk about this great
[1:33:24] great subject as Noah and Moses and
[1:33:29] David reflected the coming of this
[1:33:33] perfect bridegroom so has Russa
[1:33:38] Pentecost and wisly and Pentecost
[1:33:42] reflected the coming of a perfect bride
[1:33:46] isn't that real clear a man as those
[1:33:51] reflectors reflected G he was a
[1:33:55] masterpiece so is the bride and
[1:33:57] identified masterpiece hallelujah and it
[1:34:02] came on like that and God is depending
[1:34:05] on you to be cut by the hammer by the
[1:34:11] chisel he's depending on you to stand
[1:34:14] there and say Lord cut me Lord shake me
[1:34:20] Lord take away everything that's not me
[1:34:25] hallelujah he's depending on you to
[1:34:29] stand there say Lord I'm already to be
[1:34:31] cut hallelujah somebody once said we
[1:34:35] love the surgeon but we don't like the
[1:34:38] knife
[1:34:39] we love the surgeon which is the Lord
[1:34:42] Jesus Christ but we don't like the knife
[1:34:44] the knife hurts but we give God glory
[1:34:46] he's chipping chipping chipping chipping
[1:34:49] everything away that we can become a

[1:35:33] up coming over here now it's in the in
[1:35:36] the shuck form almost like at the
[1:35:38] Pentecostal age but the real mystery is
[1:35:43] hidden inside hallelujah that's where
[1:35:47] your fighter inside there you can't just
[1:35:50] rejoice with the shock the shock is just
[1:35:53] doing a job hallelujah but inside is the
[1:35:57] mystery that is sealed up I guess that
