[1:24] 6 reading verse
[1:26] 15 know ye not that your bodies are the
[1:29] members of Christ shall I then take the
[1:32] members of Christ and make them the
[1:34] members of ANH halot God forbid what
[1:38] know you not that he which is joined to
[1:40] an halot is one body for two say he
[1:44] shall be one flesh but he that is joined
[1:48] unto the Lord is one Spirit flee
[1:52] fornication every sin that a man doeth
[1:54] is without the body but he that
[1:56] committed fornication sinth against his
[1:59] own body
[2:01] what know ye not that your body is the
[2:04] Temple of the Holy Ghost which ye which
[2:09] is in
[2:10] you which ye have of God and you are not
[2:14] of your own for you are bought with a
[2:17] price therefore glorify God in your body
[2:20] and in your spirit which are Gods acts 7
[2:24] reading verse
[2:27] 47 but Solomon built him an house
[2:30] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[2:33] temples made with hands as sayth the
[2:37] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[2:40] my foot stol what house will you build
[2:43] me seeth the Lord or what is the place
[2:46] of my rest ha not my hand made all these
[2:49] things on the last scripture reading
[2:51] some Hebrews
[2:52] 10:5 it says wherefore when he cometh
[2:55] into the world he sayith sacrifice and
[2:57] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[3:01] has thou prepared me let's bow our heads
[3:03] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[3:05] word we thank you for those gathered
[3:07] here tonight we pray a hand of mercy and
[3:09] Grace be upon them bless them bless
[3:11] those who are connected live that your
[3:13] spirit might have the prominences and
[3:15] among us tonight God we are needy people
[3:17] and just one word from you would make
[3:20] all the difference so may you come down
[3:23] and speak to us I make myself available
[3:25] to you and I pray each one of us would
[3:27] be circumcised Lord to hear the word and
[3:30] to receive the word and circumcise me to
[3:32] speak your word granted God in Jesus
[3:35] name I ask it amen and amen God bless
[3:37] you may a seat praise God it's so good
[3:40] to be here tonight is always a great
[3:43] blessing to be in the house of God we
[3:45] will not have all we will not always
[3:47] have this privilege and while we have
[3:49] this privilege let's take advantage of
[3:51] it so I have a title this tonight the
[3:55] Temple of the Holy Ghost your
[3:58] body that's title the Temple of the Holy
[4:02] Ghost your body and have an inspiration
[4:05] glorify God in your body which is to
[4:09] honor God and bring glory to him in your
[4:13] body I'm talking about your physical
[4:15] body and I have a context scripture from
[4:17] 2 Timothy 2 verse1 15 says study to show
[4:20] thyself approve of God a Workman that
[4:23] needed not be ashamed rightly dividing
[4:25] the word of truth but shun profane and
[4:27] vain babblings for they will increase
[4:29] unto more godliness I'm going to skip to
[4:31] little but nevertheless verse 19 the
[4:34] foundation of God standed sure having
[4:37] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[4:40] his and let everyone that nameth the
[4:43] name of Christ depart from iniquity not
[4:46] some everyone that name the name of
[4:50] Christ depart from iniquity but here
[4:52] this part but in a great house there are
[4:55] not only vessels of gold and silver also
[4:58] of wood and of Earth and some to honor
[5:00] and some to dishonor and this is the
[5:02] fine print now if a man therefore Purge
[5:06] himself from these he shall be a vessel
[5:09] unto honor Sanctified and meat for the
[5:14] Master's use and prepared unto every
[5:17] good work flee also youthful lust but
[5:20] follow righteousness Faith charity peace
[5:24] with them that call on the Lord out of a
[5:27] pure heart oh Blessed Be the name of the
[5:30] Lord amen so we have an exaltation right
[5:32] there to depart from iniquity and purge
[5:36] yourself ourselves and to become a
[5:38] vessel of Honor so we are not
[5:41] automatically vessels of Honor but we
[5:44] become vessels of Honor do you believe
[5:46] that tonight all right Revelation 10 in
[5:49] the days of the voice of the seven Angel
[5:50] when he shall begin to song The Mystery
[5:52] of God shall be finished as he had
[5:54] declared to his servant the prophets
[5:56] there it is he is sending a Vindicated
[5:59] prophet prophet he is sending a prophet
[6:01] after 2,000 years he's sending someone
[6:04] who is so far from organization
[6:05] education the world of religion watch
[6:08] and he will hear only from God and he
[6:10] will have thus sayith the Lord and speak
[6:13] for God he will be God's mouthpiece he
[6:17] as it is declared in Malachi 4 will turn
[6:19] the hearts of the children back to the
[6:21] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[6:24] the last day and they will hear a
[6:26] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[6:29] as it was with Paul he will restore the
[6:32] truth as they had it and those elect
[6:35] with him here we go in that day will be
[6:39] the ones who will truly manifest the
[6:41] Lord and be his body and be his voice
[6:48] and perform his Works who the elect with
[6:51] him oh give the Lord some Praises just
[6:55] as the prophet was elected this bride
[6:57] will be elected and the elect with him
[7:00] will truly manifest the Lord and be his
[7:03] body and he is the head of the body
[7:05] called the church that's how he sees the
[7:08] bride as a designated body that he can
[7:11] work through oh give the Lord some
[7:12] Praises Hallelujah he said God sent
[7:15] Luther with the Earth he said God sent
[7:18] Luther with the word Lutheran spoke for
[7:19] God at a time they organized against
[7:22] against the pure was lost for
[7:24] organization tends towards dogma and
[7:26] Crees and not simple word they could no
[7:28] longer speak for God
[7:30] then God send wle so what what we
[7:32] getting here God wants
[7:35] somebody that could speak for
[7:40] him he wants somebody that could be his
[7:44] voice on the earth in other words he
[7:47] wants a
[7:48] body he wants a temple he wants a
[7:51] tabernacle he wants a house Heaven is my
[7:55] throne and Earth is my foot stol what

[14:45] what you want leaving out what you don't
[14:47] want you are not interested in living it
[14:49] but debating it oh my let's
[14:56] go depart from iniquity

[15:03] wrong house cleaning time you know the
[15:07] story which woman having a lost coin

[15:10] floors and sweep the cobweb and and the

[15:16] coin her husband is coming if she
[15:18] doesn't have that coin they will put her
[15:19] like an adultery and adulter and stone
[15:21] and something like that so she's
[15:23] sweeping the floor she's doing something
[15:25] to get that that coin she not saying I
[15:27] lost the coin I lost the coin you know
[15:29] lost the coin pray for me I lost the

[15:47] you cry out to God you want back your
[15:50] joy you want back your peace you want
[15:52] back Assurance you already open the gate
[15:54] for Devils to come in and you have to
[15:56] shut those doors now and get them Devils
[15:58] out you open those Gates you open those
[16:01] doors by how you do by how you act by
[16:03] iniquity by sins and whatnot and you
[16:06] give a opening for the enemy to
[16:12] comeall she swept the floors she clean
[16:15] out the cobwebs she kept on until she
[16:18] found what she has
[16:19] lost the revelation of the seven seas
[16:22] and seven Thunders was to bring the
[16:25] bride Church into true sanctification
[16:29] to
[16:30] waiting on the Dynamics to the
[16:34] mechanics not just to stay in
[16:36] justification that you are called and
[16:39] God open your eyes with I Sal that you
[16:41] may see this message of the hour but to
[16:43] move
[16:44] further real sanctification by the blood
[16:48] of Jesus a separated life unto
[16:52] God let's
[16:54] go even the foolish virgins did not make
[16:57] the Rapture and they were
[16:59] Sanctified
[17:01] holy
[17:03] clean let me say tonight there is no
[17:05] Rapture for the
[17:08] unsanctified Hallelujah we know the
[17:10] Raptor is for the Holy Ghost filled but
[17:12] I want to bring it real to you tonight
[17:15] the
[17:16] clean foolish virgins did not make it
[17:20] how dare you be
[17:21] unclean if you're talking about the
[17:24] Rapture depart from iniquity
[17:29] Sanctified in the message goes
[17:32] where you are not even in the message
[17:35] outside the blood of sanctification of
[17:36] the age which is brotherly kindness the
[17:39] blood for this age is brotherly kindness
[17:41] real brotherly kindness the world will
[17:43] sanctify you because brother what what
[17:45] what does Jesus say forgive us as
[17:48] we forgive those because you cannot
[17:52] approach god with
[17:54] condemnation and your forgiveness from
[17:57] God is based upon you forgiving other
[18:00] and God set it up that way that there
[18:02] will be issues in people's heart Minds
[18:05] lives they'll be jealousy and envy and
[18:07] all kind of mischief and so on and God
[18:09] testing you to see if you will drop it
[18:12] or if you'll keep happing about it and
[18:14] yapping about it and gossiping about it
[18:16] talking about it if you will let it go
[18:17] and you move
[18:20] onall because in the separate dream what
[18:23] happened they pour out the water and it
[18:26] leak right out and Prophet said nobody
[18:28] could hold you Holy Ghost no church
[18:30] could hold the Holy Ghost but then the
[18:32] man came with a big bucket of honey and
[18:33] poured into the Rock box and he said yes
[18:35] he could hold that the honey look like
[18:37] it wouldn't stick but it will stick you
[18:39] could get honey in a group you could get
[18:41] honey honey in a bunch of people praise
[18:44] God but the Holy Ghost you cannot hold
[18:46] that because no church could hold the
[18:49] Holy Ghost amen so sanctification is to
[18:53] be made holy clean apart s see people in
[18:57] the message say I believe message I I
[18:59] bride I bride not because you say that
[19:02] you it's so you know you just talking
[19:04] talking you don't be a m Ching you know
[19:05] you have to me God requirement that's
[19:07] right justification sanctification Holy
[19:10] Ghost just three stages three steps
[19:13] because because the resurrection fell
[19:15] into four stages God brought four stages
[19:17] back justification salification Bap to
[19:20] Holy Ghost Prophet brought the word once
[19:22] the word restored we go back to three
[19:24] steps now justification sanctification
[19:27] Upper Room Holy Ghost the token the
[19:29] person of Christ in Peter and them they
[19:31] didn't go to baptism what the Pentecost
[19:33] had they had the token itself silver and
[19:35] gold such as I I don't have but such as
[19:37] I have I give I have the person I could
[19:40] release it because I am in the body
[19:42] itself oh give the Lord a shout in the
[19:44] house then then Cornelius can't stand
[19:46] for nobody outside the body Oh Glory to
[19:49] God he had to stand for a man who was
[19:51] part of the body who was in the body Oh
[19:54] Glory who blood the blood of Jesus was
[19:56] flowing through his body send for Peter
[19:58] oh give the Lord I shout in the
[20:03] house there was a group who preaching
[20:06] heavy heavy word but they here about the
[20:08] Holy Ghost when Paul said what we
[20:11] baptize unto John he said John baptized
[20:13] in Repentance and so like that he said
[20:14] they said we have not even heard about
[20:16] this thing called Holy Spirit we heard
[20:20] about word on top of word on top of word
[20:23] we heard about Mysteries upon Mysteries
[20:24] upon Mysteries we heard about Deeds
[20:26] Divine reveal mystery truths
[20:30] but we never hear about Holy Spirit
[20:33] baptizing you wave after wave after wave
[20:37] baptism after baptism after baptism ah
[20:40] we haven't heard about this thing called
[20:41] the refilling of the Holy Ghost oh you
[20:44] have heard about it but the prophet said
[20:46] the Dynamics of this church will be more
[20:48] Mysteries no he didn't said that the
[20:50] dynamic of this church will be word on
[20:52] top of word on top word he didn't say
[20:53] that it will be a refilling and the
[20:56] refilling acts 4 but it can't be
[20:59] refilled if it never was
[21:00] filled that's acts
[21:02] two oh give the Lord a shout in the
[21:05] house Oh Glory to God if Luther had
[21:08] mechanics and Dynamics Wesley had
[21:10] mechanics and Dynamics the Pentecostal
[21:12] had mechanics Dynamics you think we
[21:13] going to be short of that we are going
[21:15] to have
[21:16] mechanics and Dynamics and we are
[21:19] expecting it if the rest of the message
[21:22] will don't want to expect it that is
[21:23] their business but I am under
[21:25] expectation for the Lord to come
[21:27] suddenly to his Temple amen Oh Glory to
[21:30] God I'm on expectation for my
[21:33] Dynamics Oh Glory to God we become
[21:36] members of the machine of his body you
[21:39] become a member of his body and when the

[28:30] Jesus never said now Peter you and John
[28:32] and all the rest of you got the
[28:33] Revelation the whole church is saved no
[28:36] he said personally I say unto thee not

[29:05] fornication every sin that a man doe it
[29:07] is without the body but he that commit

[29:14] Temple of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah your
[29:16] body itself is a temple is a tabernacle
[29:20] is a house that's how God see it Oh
[29:23] Glory to God that's how God see your
[29:26] body your physical body as a house as a
[29:29] tabernacle as a temple and what you
[29:31] think the devil sees people as as a
[29:33] house as a tabernacle the devil want to

[30:38] Amplified and all sexual looseness flee
[30:42] from impurity in thought word or deed
[30:47] any other sin which a man commits is one
[30:49] outside the body but he who commits
[30:51] sexual immorality sins against his own
[30:55] body and that's why the devil have all
[30:57] the woman
[30:58] all the lust all the porn all of that to
[31:01] actually get people to sin against their
[31:02] own body you were bought with a price

[48:18] standard money will become almost

[59:55] you need need him God let this sing deep
[1:00:00] begin to play something let this
[1:00:02] thinging deep in the hearts the word of
[1:00:05] God has no right to be preached out of
[1:00:07] an Unholy
[1:00:09] mouth it should not be preached out of a
[1:00:12] mouth of a man that would say that Jesus
[1:00:14] Christ at once one thing and now
[1:00:17] something else it must be preached by a
[1:00:20] power of the Living God through
[1:00:22] Sanctified lips that is dedicated to the
[1:00:26] service of the
[1:00:27] Lord no man has a right to preach the
[1:00:30] gospel without first being Sanctified
[1:00:32] from the cares and things of the world
[1:00:35] I'm going to
[1:00:36] close God wants to work through
[1:00:39] Sanctified
[1:00:41] vessels in the Pentecostal age he worked
[1:00:43] through
[1:00:45] men some of them was gifted men Spirit
[1:00:48] upon them prophecy tongues healing and
[1:00:52] they with somebody El's wife they're
[1:00:54] living unclean lives and God using these
[1:00:56] men his Spirit was at
[1:00:59] work God sent a prophet word amen and
[1:01:02] the secret is the wood is in the bride
[1:01:06] so what God has done now he put wood
[1:01:08] into his sons and now he's going to use
[1:01:13] that word that's in you he going to
[1:01:15] shape that word that is in you and he
[1:01:19] going to shape you brother
[1:01:22] Bram somebody was speaking and they
[1:01:24] interpret something and this was part of
[1:01:26] the interpretation I've anointed my
[1:01:27] servant to bring you things that you
[1:01:29] ought to
[1:01:30] know but Ram
[1:01:32] says I've sent him to many nations to
[1:01:35] many peoples this same message and I'll
[1:01:38] speak to you this morning take heed to
[1:01:40] it he said for anointed him and sent him
[1:01:45] oh God what is it here we go the Holy
[1:01:48] Ghost the true witness of God what is it
[1:01:53] deity Tabernacle in men

[1:01:59] deity God Tabernacle in men here we go
[1:02:04] I'm I'm
[1:02:04] closing it's more than a
[1:02:07] sensation it is more than speaking in
[1:02:09] tongues it is more than shouting in the
[1:02:12] spirit it is more than weeping it is
[1:02:15] more than joining Church it is God
[1:02:17] living in men deity God himself
[1:02:23] tabernacle into that person when he can
[1:02:26] speak is just the same as God speaking
[1:02:29] that's the Church of Jesus Christ that's
[1:02:31] the way the First Apostolic Church went
[1:02:33] forth what we need today is not a
[1:02:35] Revival a breaking out of Salvation like
[1:02:37] the days of the wealth Revival when the
[1:02:39] people in the shops fell under
[1:02:40] conviction crying and and join and
[1:02:41] bootle joints and pleasure and so on we
[1:02:44] need a day of weeping and
[1:02:47] mourning waiting until God sends the
[1:02:50] Holy Ghost his witness not an empty
[1:02:54] shell not an empty
[1:02:56] denomination but Dey Tabernacle in men
