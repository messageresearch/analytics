[16:41] be in the house of God this morning we
[16:43] want to go straight to the word if you
[16:45] have your Bibles and I can return to
[16:46] Luke chapter 17. we want to read verse
[16:49] 20 to 30.
[16:51] we want to turn after the first
[16:53] Corinthians chapter four one verse 20.
[16:57] and we want to read Mark 16 verse 15 to
[17:00] 20.
[17:02] so Luke chapter 17
[17:05] reading from verse 20.
[17:09] and when he was demanded of the
[17:11] Pharisees
[17:13] when the kingdom of God should come
[17:15] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[17:18] God commit not with observation
[17:22] neither shall they say Lo here or Lo
[17:24] dear for behold the kingdom of God is
[17:28] within you
[17:30] and he said to his disciples the days
[17:33] will come
[17:34] when you shall desire to see one of the
[17:38] Deeds of the son of man and he shall not
[17:39] see it
[17:40] and they shall say to you see here see
[17:43] there go not after them not follow them
[17:46] for as the lightning that lightened out
[17:48] of one part on the heaven shine it unto
[17:51] the other part of the heaven so shall
[17:52] also the son of man be in his day
[17:55] but fist must he suffer many things and
[17:58] be rejected of this generation
[18:01] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[18:02] shall it also been the days of the son
[18:04] of man did it eat they drank they
[18:07] married wives they were given in
[18:09] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[18:11] into the ark and the flood came and
[18:14] destroyed them all
[18:15] likewise also as it was on days of lot
[18:18] they did eat they drank they bought they
[18:21] sold they planted they build it but the
[18:24] same day that what went out of Salam it
[18:27] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[18:28] and destroyed them all
[18:31] even thus shall it be in the day when
[18:34] the son of man
[18:36] is revealed
[18:38] and First Corinthians chapter 4 verse
[18:41] 20.
[18:43] for the kingdom of God
[18:46] is not in Word
[18:48] but in power let me Delegate for the
[18:51] kingdom of God
[18:52] is not in Word
[18:54] but in power
[18:55] our last scripture from Mark 16 15 and
[18:59] he said unto them go into all the world
[19:00] and preach the gospel to every creature
[19:03] he doesn't believe in US baptized shall
[19:05] be saved he does believeth not shall be
[19:07] damned these son shall follow them that
[19:09] believe in my name they shall cast out
[19:11] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[19:13] they shall take up serpents and if they
[19:15] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[19:16] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[19:18] and they shall recover
[19:20] and soon enough to the Lord had spoken
[19:22] unto them he was received up into heaven
[19:24] and sudden on the right hand of God and
[19:26] they went forth and preached everywhere
[19:28] the Lord working with them and
[19:32] confirming the word with signs following
[19:35] may God bless his word let's pray one
[19:37] more time father we have read your word
[19:38] and any man can read scriptures Lord but
[19:41] to take the Holy Spirit to come and
[19:42] breathe life into it Lord we pray the
[19:44] bread of God will bring life into your
[19:46] people Lord that they stand like a
[19:48] mighty marching Army granted Lord in
[19:51] Jesus amen you may be seated and I just
[19:53] sit down give God some praises
[19:57] thank you
[20:03] welcome again it's good to be the host
[20:06] of God always good to be in God's house
[20:10] this is more important than your job
[20:13] home family this is where you get Divine
[20:16] instructions this is where you come
[20:18] under Covenant this is where you get the
[20:20] connection with the supernatural with
[20:22] the protection with the word with a
[20:25] directive of the Lord into your life
[20:27] all glory to God not everybody is
[20:29] ordined to speak into your life but God
[20:31] have Ministry to speak into your life by
[20:34] the word of God the right things that
[20:36] you must hear coming into your life do
[20:39] you believe that
[20:40] we'll have a title this morning call
[20:41] back to the original Faith the bride
[20:44] that's the title call back to the
[20:46] original Faith the bride and have an
[20:48] inspiration faith is the key that luck
[20:51] unlocks every treasure in the kingdom of
[20:54] God
[20:56] faith is the key that unlocks every
[20:58] treasure in the kingdom of God
[21:00] Hallelujah now the scripture we read
[21:03] First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 and
[21:05] the Amplified it was scripted read for
[21:08] the kingdom is not a word but in power
[21:10] but in the Amplified is written for the
[21:12] kingdom of God consists of and is based
[21:16] not on talk
[21:18] but on power
[21:20] moral power and Excellence of soul
[21:24] Hallelujah that's why we talk about the
[21:26] kingdom of God
[21:27] John was preaching the kingdom of God is
[21:29] at hand Jesus was preaching the kingdom
[21:32] of God my kingdom is not of this world
[21:35] so he was presenting people another
[21:37] kingdom that they never saw they never
[21:40] heard about they never experienced and
[21:43] he was about to introduce to them this
[21:45] thing called the kingdom of God
[21:48] because they were living in the Kingdom
[21:49] of this world but he was talking about a
[21:52] higher level a higher order a higher
[21:54] world called the kingdom of God Amen
[21:58] no
[22:04] misread back here
[22:08] so describing Pharisees they demanded of
[22:11] him when the kingdom should come
[22:14] this Kingdom wait when it should come
[22:15] and Jesus said the kingdom cometh not
[22:17] with observation
[22:19] so what you're looking for you're
[22:21] looking for a cloud you're looking for
[22:23] you look at what what are you looking
[22:24] for
[22:25] you're looking for this you're looking
[22:26] for that what what are you looking for
[22:28] you see he said behold the kingdom is
[22:32] within you
[22:33] oh my Hallelujah so he was dismissing
[22:36] all the physical and notable things the
[22:39] people said the kingdom of God coming
[22:40] and he said this Kingdom had to be
[22:42] within you but that itself is a
[22:44] revelation how does the kingdom come
[22:46] into someone because God's object is to
[22:49] get the kingdom within you and we find
[22:51] out God was above us pillar fire and
[22:54] Moses time God With Us in Jesus Christ
[22:56] and then the holy ghost coming to you
[22:58] and Jesus told them I if I don't go the
[23:01] comforter will not come
[23:02] and I am the comforter which is the
[23:04] power which is the Dynamics is not with
[23:06] you but it shall be in you
[23:08] so I have to get somewhere to reconnect
[23:10] you to the power that's supposed to
[23:11] commit in you you don't have it no but
[23:14] you have that to get
[23:15] you don't have it now but you have a
[23:17] promise of it you don't have it yet but
[23:19] you're gonna get it because there is
[23:21] something in you to receive it you can't
[23:24] get it if there's nothing you need to
[23:25] receive it you have to have the ability
[23:27] to receive so God put the receiver
[23:30] inside you first
[23:31] and cover that receiver with dirt with
[23:33] mud with filth with unbelief with all
[23:36] kind of things around that but it's
[23:38] still inside of you you went through
[23:40] hell you went through trials you went to
[23:42] tribulation but it's still there you
[23:44] fall sick but it's still there somebody
[23:46] could go crazy but it's still there
[23:48] nothing can't change that because if God
[23:51] put that seed in your soul and the devil
[23:54] don't have the authority to go inside
[23:55] your soul you can mess with your mind he
[23:59] can mess with your body but he can't
[24:01] mess with your soul that seed is
[24:04] predestinated that seal is elected
[24:07] oh
[24:08] [Applause]
[24:12] let me see it again
[24:14] he could fool with your body
[24:17] he could fool with your spirit but he
[24:20] cannot fool with those soul
[24:22] because only the word is a designer of
[24:25] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[24:27] the devil is not the word he cannot go
[24:30] inside of your heart and mess up inside
[24:33] a deer God put that germ inside of there
[24:35] that's why you don't know who you are he
[24:38] didn't know who Jesus was he keeps
[24:40] saying that though he is Dolby and Dolby
[24:42] he watching your stinking flesh and
[24:45] misinterpreting who you are because of
[24:47] what you was because what you're doing
[24:49] right now but he's not seeing what you
[24:51] have to become
[24:52] [Applause]
[24:56] he's trying to nail you by your failures
[24:59] he's trying to nail you by your sins
[25:01] he's trying to nail you by your past but
[25:04] God already consider
[25:06] your future already done so he chose you
[25:10] before the foundation of the world and
[25:13] he's not going down and choose you he's
[25:15] not going to Hallelujah
[25:23] maybe season
[25:25] he's not going to undo his choice before
[25:28] there was even born he said Jacob I love
[25:30] he so I hate Oh Glory to God because he
[25:33] knew what they will do and God knew what
[25:36] you're gonna do
[25:39] yes you know you're gonna make things
[25:41] right you know you're gonna say I am
[25:43] sorry forgive me you know all of that
[25:45] before he even glory to God hallelujah
[25:48] [Applause]
[25:51] Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God
[25:55] hallelujah
[25:58] God
[26:00] fire is in the building
[26:06] you may be seated
[26:08] you think God didn't see your life
[26:09] messed up tied up tangled up and wrapped
[26:11] up and all kind of foolishness you think
[26:13] God didn't understand that why you think
[26:15] your life gets so messed up and tied up
[26:17] they never want to finish you a long
[26:18] time
[26:19] there's ever always try to cut off
[26:21] potential
[26:22] because once they get into maturity he
[26:24] is finished
[26:25] Oh Glory to God that's why he killed all
[26:28] them babies two years and under kill
[26:29] what is the potential but once you come
[26:32] into maturity is finished because here
[26:34] the prophecy hanging over you at that
[26:36] day Saint John 14 20 you shall know I am
[26:41] in the father you and me and I in you
[26:43] the devil don't want you to come to that
[26:46] day
[26:46] that bear is coming for you oh give the
[26:49] Lord a shout the devil don't want you to
[26:52] come to that day
[26:56] [Applause]
[26:58] because that day brings you from partial
[27:01] realization into perfect realization
[27:04] that day brings you know an impact
[27:08] that you will know
[27:10] you are known
[27:12] okay the Lord
[27:14] [Applause]
[27:17] may be sit you may be seasoned
[27:20] [Applause]
[27:22] amen
[27:24] the way God knows you is not how your
[27:27] father know you
[27:28] your mother know you or your husband
[27:30] know you or your wife know you the way
[27:32] God know you is different people see you
[27:34] as sinner but when Jesus was praying he
[27:36] said father Oh Glory to God you they
[27:39] were with me before the world was keep
[27:42] them
[27:43] keep them keep them oh give the Lord our
[27:47] soap Revelation is breaking in this

[39:03] whose name was Simeon
[39:04] the same man was just an evout waiting
[39:08] for the consolation of Israel
[39:10] and the Holy Ghost was upon him
[39:15] and it was revealed unto him
[39:17] by the Holy Ghost
[39:19] that he will not
[39:21] will not until the Lord see the Lord's
[39:23] Christ
[39:24] this Revelation brought faith which
[39:28] brought an expectation
[39:30] for manifestation so faith is not talk
[39:33] her faith what that's supposed to do
[39:35] a revelation brings expectation
[39:38] for something
[39:40] faith is the key to get you to where
[39:43] you're going the Bible says faith is the
[39:45] substance of what you're hoping for so a
[39:49] lot of things people think they have
[39:50] they really don't have because Faith
[39:52] make you act different talk different
[39:54] live different see different
[39:58] amen
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:03] [Music]

[40:07] amen
[40:08] [Music]
[40:14] there must be faith
[40:17] to accompany expectation
[40:20] and there are only two elements in the
[40:23] world that controls the world tonight
[40:27] fear and faith
[40:31] Russia is trying to get everybody to
[40:33] fear them
[40:34] and we are trying to get everybody to
[40:36] have faith in God that's the difference
[40:38] that is the Two element control Nations
[40:42] control all people control all churches
[40:47] control individual it is fear
[40:52] of faith
[40:53] [Music]
[40:55] I wanted to do it today but it was just
[40:57] I just didn't want to do it put a glass
[40:59] here for you
[41:00] and put it halfway with water in it
[41:03] and asks you what you see
[41:06] so could you imagine a glass here and
[41:08] it's halfway
[41:09] and I asked what do you see
[41:12] and some will say I see a glass
[41:14] half full
[41:16] and somebody will say I see a glass half
[41:19] empty
[41:21] psychologists will say
[41:23] the person who say half empty is
[41:26] negative base
[41:28] the person will say her full
[41:30] is positive based
[41:33] but both of what they're seeing is right
[41:36] they have empty person seen as halfway
[41:38] done to finish
[41:40] they have full personal scene is halfway
[41:42] down to full to get to the top
[41:45] what do you see
[41:47] it comes a question of perspective
[41:50] so if your perspective in life is
[41:52] negative it affects your marriage
[41:56] it's the fact how you view the world
[41:58] it affects how you see others because
[42:00] your base is negative
[42:02] Jesus had us to get these guys until one
[42:05] base
[42:06] which is under the promise of God
[42:09] which is always positive
[42:12] I will not leave you comfortless

[42:18] world see at me no more but you shall
[42:20] see me and because I live shugly also

[57:33] to go back so far Israel knew all what
[57:36] God did they went back in the history
[57:37] openly Red Sea the openness they're
[57:40] talking and sharing the historical data
[57:43] of their tribe and their nation was

[58:15] your man to fight me it was the
[58:18] historical fate that was required it was
[58:21] not fair that God did something back
[58:23] there if this present tense

[58:30] it needed a no faith because there's no
[58:33] problem
[58:36] your care faces are no problem with the
[58:39] historical faith

[1:06:18] God will do it oh hallelujah praise God
[1:06:23] there's got to be a bride called back to
[1:06:26] the original set the apostolic faith the
[1:06:29] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:06:30] Saints
[1:06:31] oh Hallelujah
[1:06:33] you may be seated praise God so he was
[1:06:36] talking to sanctified people preserved
[1:06:39] in Christ Jesus called he said you say
[1:06:42] the faith I was wonderful to the Saints
[1:06:43] not just if it some people say that's
[1:06:46] against my feet there's only one fate
[1:06:48] there's only one Lord there's only one
[1:06:50] baptism no people say well I have a
[1:06:52] faith and I go to my own church but
[1:06:54] that's not what Jude is speaking of here
[1:06:56] he is talking to the people that the
[1:06:59] content for the faith
[1:07:01] don't forget it not ace hate not message
[1:07:04] hate become a debate that was once
[1:07:07] delivered to the Saints you have to
[1:07:09] contend faith and fight Faith now if we
[1:07:11] can only find out there we go what
[1:07:13] defeat is then we can earnestly contend
[1:07:16] for that fate is that right Hallelujah
[1:07:19] if we can find out what what defect is
[1:07:22] then we can earnestly content for that
[1:07:25] fate what defeat now the Fate was once
[1:07:29] delivered to the scene so if you go back
[1:07:30] to where they were called Saints and
[1:07:32] find out what kind of Faith they had we
[1:07:34] will know more or less what they contend
[1:07:36] for now when the church was called Saint
[1:07:38] they were called sanctified
[1:07:40] Hallelujah say it means clean pure holy
[1:07:44] unadultered and so forth that was the
[1:07:46] beginning of the another when it was
[1:07:48] inaugurated under their Pentecost so
[1:07:50] let's look what they had back there what
[1:07:53] the church contended for
[1:07:55] no Jude wouldn't be talking about the
[1:07:57] Old Testament on the levitical laws he
[1:08:00] is a Christian he was talking about when
[1:08:03] the church was set in order
[1:08:05] was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:08] now we will notice what kind of faith
[1:08:10] that they had they had a faith here we
[1:08:13] go in a resurrected living Christ
[1:08:16] someone who rose from the dead and was
[1:08:19] living among them
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:22] that wasn't a man unveiling teachings
[1:08:26] and revelation
[1:08:28] to live in Christ
[1:08:30] resurrected among them they knew he was
[1:08:33] among them

[1:14:08] look for your life to be changed
[1:14:16] you won't a change life
[1:14:20] you don't want to be blessed you want a
[1:14:23] transformation
[1:14:24] when Jacob you may be sitting
[1:14:27] Jacob tricking everybody mother-in-law
[1:14:29] father-in-law you name it he could trick
[1:14:31] because that is nature
[1:14:34] he's a real reporter but he's a son it
[1:14:38] have some rip of artists who are Sons
[1:14:40] now if you watch the Artistry and you
[1:14:43] watch the behavior you will close the
[1:14:45] eyes and say no
[1:14:47] but God don't see us man see
[1:14:49] so that's why when you have strange eyes
[1:14:52] you don't like this one your blood
[1:14:53] categories one you need help
[1:14:55] you need Deliverance you need that not
[1:14:58] like a demon to be cast out because God
[1:15:00] love you
[1:15:01] as you are but he's not really letting
[1:15:04] you remain as you are he is changing you
[1:15:07] from what you are to what you are to
[1:15:09] become
[1:15:10] Oh Glory to God and his purpose and
[1:15:13] desire is that you be conformed to the
[1:15:15] image of his son you have your nature
[1:15:17] and he of his nature you might be a a
[1:15:19] man like Peter was an aggressive man a
[1:15:22] bowl man Lord if that you beat me to
[1:15:23] come there are people who are aggressive
[1:15:25] there's people who are quiet there's
[1:15:26] some people who are shy that's your
[1:15:28] nature but he have his nature and all of
[1:15:31] us have to be partakers of his divine
[1:15:33] nature so his nature after coming to you
[1:15:36] and that's why take out your shyness
[1:15:38] that will take out this that will take
[1:15:39] out your anger and temper because you
[1:15:41] are surrendering to his nature
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:46] and his nature is a nature of Power Man
[1:15:49] was destined to have power man is
[1:15:52] supposed to be in power Oh Glory not
[1:15:54] power over one another but Power very
[1:15:56] creeping things over sickness over
[1:15:58] Devils over diseases man one power over
[1:16:01] man Oh Glory to quarter before God gave
[1:16:04] power you have to show power over you
[1:16:08] come on say Amen somebody you have to
[1:16:10] have power over you
[1:16:12] [Applause]
[1:16:17] and the first stage of getting power
[1:16:20] over you is when you could own your
[1:16:23] behavior
[1:16:28] let me say it again
[1:16:31] when you could own up
[1:16:33] to your
[1:16:35] Behavior because decisions produces
[1:16:38] actions and actions of consequences
[1:16:42] and when you reap the fruit of your
[1:16:43] consequences based upon your actions
[1:16:46] then you have a decision whether to make
[1:16:48] excuses or own up
[1:16:51] the prodigal son was not wrong in asking
[1:16:53] his father for money
[1:16:55] Hallelujah
[1:16:56] that was his right
[1:16:58] he was a son
[1:17:00] he had access to the father and what was
[1:17:02] his own he said give me my portion now
[1:17:04] I don't want to wait till you're dead
[1:17:05] just give me no
[1:17:08] I feel I could be responsible for what
[1:17:10] you give me
[1:17:11] he was not ready
[1:17:13] he was not mature
[1:17:15] he went a far country deliberately so
[1:17:18] nobody can monitor or give account to
[1:17:19] his behavior and actions
[1:17:21] he spent his money widely
[1:17:23] and then he find himself in the picture
[1:17:25] still
[1:17:27] because you couldn't pay no more rent
[1:17:30] he broke
[1:17:33] he tell people now where he's living
[1:17:35] they see in the big mansion they're
[1:17:37] seeing the hot
[1:17:39] they're seeing the farm behind the house
[1:17:44] so as far as the friends concerned he'll
[1:17:46] live in a bigger house he just said come
[1:17:47] on spending these days
[1:17:49] that time money is done
[1:17:52] money is finished no more pizza
[1:17:55] no more KFC
[1:17:57] no more outside dining they just not
[1:17:59] seen him he said he's taking a
[1:18:01] sabbatical
[1:18:03] you take an arrest
[1:18:05] that time is they gonna lodging any big
[1:18:07] style eating pig slop
[1:18:12] and he was so proud that the padders
[1:18:14] Kill You The Pride
[1:18:16] he was so proud he didn't pick food for
[1:18:19] a while but still
[1:18:20] maybe blessing it and put some ketchup
[1:18:22] in it but eat and take food until
[1:18:25] he came to himself
[1:18:27] until he came to himself and begin to
[1:18:31] accept responsibility
[1:18:34] for the fruit and consequences of his
[1:18:36] action he said I will arise I will say
[1:18:39] unto my father I have sinned oh God are
[1:18:43] coming back are coming back I'm coming
[1:18:44] back oh give the Lord a shout
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:57] this is the problem here
[1:18:59] I know personally many people don't
[1:19:03] accept their behavior
[1:19:06] you have no acceptance
[1:19:08] see you are responsible
[1:19:13] and the first response
[1:19:16] who did the devil did it money
[1:19:21] I remember talking
[1:19:23] up in New York about the time when I
[1:19:25] opened my radiator
[1:19:27] and it blew up and I get burned still
[1:19:30] have things from it
[1:19:31] and I was saying I was responsible for
[1:19:34] that
[1:19:35] child
[1:19:39] the devil a whole
[1:19:42] I mean I didn't want to but the devil
[1:19:44] hold my hand no no no I know devil in
[1:19:46] that
[1:19:47] that is me and folly
[1:19:51] and I got burned for my fault because I
[1:19:53] know better than that
[1:19:55] before you touch that poor water on it
[1:19:57] before you touch that have a cloth to
[1:19:59] open that
[1:20:00] that was foolishness and I was
[1:20:03] responsible and paid for that
[1:20:06] see if I come and says
[1:20:14] I touched that radiator and Lucifer
[1:20:18] don't know where it came from
[1:20:20] I got burned pray for me
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:24] and Lucifer saying I was not there
[1:20:26] I did not touch him I did not tell him
[1:20:29] to do that he did it on his own
[1:20:33] foreign
[1:20:39] because he's a liar to begin with
[1:20:43] because because I am lying if I say that
[1:20:46] I know better than that and you know
[1:20:48] better than that too stop lying
[1:20:51] be honest with yourself accept
[1:20:54] responsibility for your behavior till
[1:20:57] the Lord I shout
[1:20:58] [Applause]
[1:21:07] and whenever you begin to accept
[1:21:09] responsibility for your behavior that is
[1:21:12] the first step for you to be changed
[1:21:16] [Applause]
[1:21:17] how you're gonna be
[1:21:20] change
[1:21:23] accept
[1:21:24] you may feel as a wife
[1:21:26] it's not really a failure you do what
[1:21:28] you know
[1:21:29] you may feel as a husband it's not
[1:21:32] really a failure or a father
[1:21:34] or our mother
[1:21:36] maintain the try the best there's no
[1:21:39] school of motherhood there's no school
[1:21:40] of fatherhood there's no school of
[1:21:42] husband and wife there's none
[1:21:44] you do your best you say the way I
[1:21:46] understand you didn't say it right and
[1:21:48] whatnot but if you get the tools you
[1:21:49] would have done better
[1:21:52] and you have to forgive yourself
[1:21:54] but there's another problem people have
[1:21:56] people can't forgive their own self you
[1:21:59] have to come to a spot where you could
[1:22:01] forgive you
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:04] because if you can't forgive you the
[1:22:06] devil will wipe you out
[1:22:09] because you will always walk under our
[1:22:11] condemnation but there are no
[1:22:13] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[1:22:15] Jesus will walk not after the flesh but
[1:22:17] after the spirit
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:22] this morning
[1:22:25] [Applause]
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:35] be honest
[1:22:37] with your actions
[1:22:39] when you start to accept responsibility
[1:22:41] then you can say Lord change me why why
[1:22:43] why do I say that Jacob his nature was a
[1:22:47] rip-off thing
[1:22:48] he's tricking everybody and until he
[1:22:51] came to the end game because all these
[1:22:52] have an end you know
[1:22:54] people don't understand that I don't
[1:22:56] know when I Was preparing the streets
[1:22:57] are telling me I said look at that young
[1:22:59] people they don't know next 40 years
[1:23:00] from now
[1:23:02] that tall Spike issues that they were in
[1:23:04] that I figured they had a balance and
[1:23:06] play gymnastics with it
[1:23:08] they went Flats
[1:23:10] next 40 years perfect Flats
[1:23:12] because if they don't wear them flash
[1:23:14] they will fall
[1:23:15] when they fall they go in hospital
[1:23:18] and at that age a bones to men that
[1:23:20] normal
[1:23:22] so right now they're on stills
[1:23:26] and because they have youth in the bones
[1:23:28] they could balance and them Stills that
[1:23:30] they're working on
[1:23:31] but all that comes to an end 40 50 years
[1:23:33] from them
[1:23:34] still not seeing that so Jacob when he
[1:23:37] met the angel because afterwards he
[1:23:39] recognized his fear ESO

[1:27:57] living Christ
[1:27:58] someone who rose from the dead and was
[1:27:59] even among them just the same as he was
[1:28:01] before he ever died they wasn't
[1:28:03] contented for something through a color
[1:28:04] fear oh god what the history
[1:28:14] like I know when I go overseas and
[1:28:16] preach overseas and son is a blessing to
[1:28:18] those across there but how you listen to
[1:28:20] that I can explain how Firefall in
[1:28:23] Africa and the blessings of God here but
[1:28:25] then you are your problems
[1:28:27] you can connect with what happened
[1:28:28] across there
[1:28:29] you have to connect with what happened
[1:28:30] right here
[1:28:31] so I will talk about all them things
[1:28:37] up there like Superman
[1:28:39] and you know I am normal man no keep
[1:28:42] no s
[1:28:46] ense I supposed to come with a big cape
[1:28:48] and a big S here Superman you say who is
[1:28:50] he again
[1:28:53] so I you know I am not Superman and I
[1:28:56] know I'm not Superman
[1:28:58] Superman
[1:29:00] because Superman have to have star you
[1:29:02] have to have cape
[1:29:04] and do a lot of stuff but when you know
[1:29:06] who Jesus is
[1:29:08] that he is the Superman and you want him
[1:29:10] Among Us Then whether I am here or not
[1:29:13] here you're looking for him
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:21] you understand that whether I am here or

[1:29:37] continue
[1:29:39] you see they wasn't contended for some
[1:29:41] historical Affair but they were
[1:29:42] contending for the living Christ a
[1:29:44] resurrected one who was in your midst
[1:29:47] so what good will you do to tell people
[1:29:49] where we come from in Cairo and the
[1:29:50] history of the church and all the trials
[1:29:52] we went through and how we tries to
[1:29:54] build this to us and then everybody knew
[1:29:56] everybody knew to come we have to inform
[1:29:58] them the whole history
[1:30:00] they know what the Bible says a parable
[1:30:03] of men who work in the field some in the
[1:30:05] morning they say penny Penny Penny Penny
[1:30:07] and then the last time last holiday they
[1:30:09] see some fellow Slackers they say no I'm
[1:30:11] doing nothing they say you want to work
[1:30:12] one more hour to work Penny you see I'll
[1:30:15] be going on work they made by the way
[1:30:17] who was working holiday
[1:30:19] whole day once
[1:30:21] accepted penny when come to pay they
[1:30:23] start with the last
[1:30:25] answer to pay them penny holy ones
[1:30:27] looking for penny plus
[1:30:32] Master the same but you agreed over
[1:30:38] the same pay Peter had the same pay Paul
[1:30:41] had we're going to have
[1:30:45] God they're cheating us I'm saying all
[1:30:47] again are sent and I'm gonna Penny the
[1:30:49] same paid game had we have to have
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:56] such as I have I give it unto you rise
[1:31:00] up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:01] they have it we have to have it
[1:31:08] that's what we're talking about
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:15] what a brand name says
[1:31:18] you shall see me the church the believer
[1:31:20] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:31:22] of the world now that was the apostles
[1:31:24] believe they believed that he was in the
[1:31:26] flesh he was also more in the spirit
[1:31:29] that is what they taught that is what
[1:31:31] they believe that is what they practiced
[1:31:34] that is what God confirmed he was in the
[1:31:36] flesh now he is more in the spirit
[1:31:38] that's what they believe that when your
[1:31:40] family walk inside of here the very full
[1:31:42] service don't work inside of here the
[1:31:44] anointing the presence the power but do
[1:31:46] something for them that they will know
[1:31:48] God is dealing with their hearts you
[1:31:50] don't have to tell a word
[1:31:52] the spirit speaking to them directly
[1:31:54] Give the Lord a shout
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:59] I have no doubt your love will be
[1:32:01] delivered
[1:32:02] okay right now or the smoking tampi and
[1:32:05] the smoke in my one and on drugs God
[1:32:08] will deliver them he's going to prove he
[1:32:10] is God and your faithfulness and your
[1:32:12] faith and God is not in vain
[1:32:15] you have been believed in them
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:24] he said you know I like this that is
[1:32:26] what they believed that is what they
[1:32:28] practiced that is what God confirmed but
[1:32:30] during this time this 33 years of laughs
[1:32:33] there became many false brethren not few
[1:32:38] many false Brethren who raised up and
[1:32:41] brought in heresies and brought people
[1:32:43] of the Theology and different things
[1:32:45] like that
[1:32:47] and all them are the private Revelation
[1:32:48] because they want to get big up they
[1:32:50] want to get high up they won't be
[1:32:51] receiving a certain way so therefore the
[1:32:53] exercise of their knowledge people say
[1:32:54] oh I never hear it so I never see it so
[1:32:56] never see it come so
[1:32:58] but these disciples
[1:33:01] the Lord was working with them when they
[1:33:04] speak God confirmed they don't know no
[1:33:06] explanation of that the manifestation
[1:33:08] was the interpretation it had nobody to
[1:33:10] explain or the government walk well you
[1:33:12] know the fire went on the mouth and this
[1:33:14] and that no no no
[1:33:16] I remember when a man Jesus healed and
[1:33:19] they say God he will say God was blind
[1:33:21] no he's here
[1:33:22] he just is a sinner
[1:33:24] so two says he's healed you say God heal
[1:33:26] you Jesus said I don't know
[1:33:30] but this one thing I know I once was
[1:33:32] blind but now I see
[1:33:34] explain that to me
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:38] all this in a talk and Senator and
[1:33:40] you're off the word and
[1:33:43] hear the of the word
[1:33:44] but I was not blind but now I see amen
[1:33:49] those people see his contrary
[1:33:52] not because they know Arsenal not
[1:33:54] because they hear what we're preaching
[1:33:55] to know because somebody tell them that
[1:33:59] no full silence no firsthand information
[1:34:02] they think we off like one man challenge
[1:34:04] myself
[1:34:05] listen we have over how much tips on
[1:34:08] YouTube I say finding one message just
[1:34:11] one where I preach of the word
[1:34:14] that's one
[1:34:16] I said all the messages
[1:34:19] it's on YouTube
[1:34:20] item we're not hiding and saying
[1:34:22] anything until nothing no we've seen it
[1:34:24] unedited it's right there for anybody to
[1:34:27] listen to it and see if we preach in the
[1:34:29] word or we're not preaching the word
[1:34:31] oh Hallelujah I couldn't say nothing
[1:34:32] after that oh glory to God all these
[1:34:35] years that that's why I stayed in the
[1:34:36] world you know that's why I like to
[1:34:37] quote the word I am a reader I call to
[1:34:40] this thing I call it a preach by this I
[1:34:43] am a reader Hallelujah
[1:34:45] only reason you know what they're doing
[1:34:47] here are bringing promises because I
[1:34:50] have a revelation Peter said by these
[1:34:52] promises you become partakers I can
[1:34:55] spend four hours explaining things I'm
[1:34:57] not here to explain I'm here to bring
[1:34:59] promises and bring it so clear and real
[1:35:02] because so many enemy come like a flood
[1:35:04] the spirit of God would raise a standard
[1:35:06] by taking the same word and making it
[1:35:08] more positive for my responsibility to
[1:35:11] drop the world on you and make it more
[1:35:13] positive

[1:37:18] expectation I want to have a desire in
[1:37:20] your heart a grown in your spirit you
[1:37:23] mustn't be normal like everybody else if
[1:37:25] every other Church dead you kind of
[1:37:27] thought to be dead because there will be
[1:37:29] a church called back to the original
[1:37:30] Faith the shout of the king will be in
[1:37:32] Camp he said I checked with Jesus Christ
[1:37:34] walking on it I am not Jesus he's not

[1:37:41] Lord I shout there will be a church with

[1:37:47] king will be in the camp
[1:37:52] yeah
[1:37:53] amen amen
[1:37:56] so during the time there became many
[1:38:00] forced Brethren who raised up and
[1:38:02] brought in heresies and what people of
[1:38:04] the Theology and everything he said God
[1:38:06] help us to have that kind of credential
[1:38:08] today let us contend for the feet the
[1:38:11] true feat that was once delivered to the
[1:38:13] Saints the Saints believed in the debt
[1:38:15] burial and Resurrection they believe in
[1:38:18] the baptism of the holy spirit let me
[1:38:21] pause here a minute the prophet said you
[1:38:23] can have the baptism 24 hours every day
[1:38:25] I'm still be lost
[1:38:28] foreign
[1:38:30] what is he talking about
[1:38:33] you can be baptized on your spirit
[1:38:35] you could be baptized in your flesh or
[1:38:38] you could be baptized in your soul so
[1:38:40] that 24 hours being lost is not for the
[1:38:43] soul
[1:38:45] [Applause]
[1:38:48] so teachings are going out to sit in
[1:38:49] your soul you don't need it baptism of
[1:38:51] the Holy Ghost because the baptism goes
[1:38:53] is not the real thing he says because
[1:38:55] you are son you're going to receive the
[1:38:57] spirit
[1:38:58] the spirit not making you a son the
[1:39:00] spirit is empowering you as a son but
[1:39:03] Peter didn't bypass the upper room and
[1:39:05] say I've seen in his soul I don't need
[1:39:06] the upper room he needed the upper room
[1:39:09] he
[1:39:10] needed to be activated he needs the
[1:39:13] anointing you need this power
[1:39:19] let me say it again you need it
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:25] you know what this power is this is
[1:39:27] power to pray power deliver holy life
[1:39:30] power to overcome power to forgive power
[1:39:34] to make things right or glory to God
[1:39:37] power to live power to add the rest of
[1:39:39] the life
[1:39:40] foreign
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:46] scriptures as many receive him
[1:39:50] to them
[1:39:51] give you power not more letter power the
[1:39:55] kingdom is not in letter power Oh Glory

[1:40:10] everybody in the Kingdom Oh Come and
[1:40:13] preach back to me somebody

[1:46:06] to forgive
[1:46:08] yourself

[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:19] Jesus himself said behold I stand the
[1:46:21] door and knock
[1:46:22] If any man would
[1:46:24] open

[1:46:28] the inside
[1:46:29] he's not going to break down your door
[1:46:32] you are going to choose to love
[1:46:35] you are going to choose to forgive it's
[1:46:37] a choice
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:39] I have in my heart
[1:46:41] to share some things with you I didn't
[1:46:43] plan to do it today about certain
[1:46:45] principles and what has kept me over the
[1:46:46] years and to share some tips if I could
[1:46:49] call it or whatever it is
[1:46:52] oh what has helped me over the years
[1:46:54] I like the power of choice I like the
[1:46:57] power of decision
[1:46:58] I see the fruit of decisions with
[1:47:00] actions and the consequences of that
[1:47:03] when you choose to love and choose to
[1:47:05] forgive it it changes everything you're
[1:47:08] not looking for reward I scratched my
[1:47:10] back I scratch your back because I want
[1:47:12] you to scratch my eyes no no we're not
[1:47:13] talking about that I scratch my your
[1:47:14] back because your back needs to be
[1:47:15] scratched
[1:47:16] I help you because I want to help you I
[1:47:19] choose to help you so there is no report
[1:47:20] oh God like I help him I help her I look
[1:47:23] what she's doing now no you have none of
[1:47:25] that
[1:47:25] you do it because you want to you do it
[1:47:28] because you choose to because when God
[1:47:30] was helping you he did it because he
[1:47:32] wanted to
[1:47:33] he reached you they're stronger self
[1:47:35] when he reached on his hand for me I was
[1:47:37] lost and undone without God or his son
[1:47:40] when he reached on his hand for me
[1:47:42] Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:47:45] how could you forget that
[1:47:47] oh could you forget where God brought
[1:47:49] you from
[1:47:50] Hallelujah don't you ever forget that
[1:47:57] and usually when people get blessed to
[1:47:59] forget God
[1:48:01] you get a little more money order and
[1:48:03] more this and more that and they forget
[1:48:05] God but God wants to raise you so much
[1:48:08] God wants somebody the more he get
[1:48:12] blessed is the more humble he becomes
[1:48:14] it's a tough combination because
[1:48:16] normally when people get blessed to get
[1:48:17] puffed up
[1:48:18] to get oversized they don't care no more
[1:48:21] when God when they was in tears when
[1:48:23] they forget when when when when the
[1:48:25] others was driving them to service when
[1:48:27] they get the car they do want to pick up
[1:48:29] somebody they bring them to church but
[1:48:31] they forget when other people was giving
[1:48:32] them a ride to service but when they get
[1:48:34] a card they have the nose up in the air
[1:48:35] and they're making Style
[1:48:37] I ain't even knock anybody or me to see
[1:48:39] it I had showing words for Yami to say
[1:48:42] it you have to remember where you come
[1:48:44] from Oh Glory to God he brought me up
[1:48:47] the man really clear he set my feet upon
[1:48:49] a rock to stay he put a song in my soul
[1:48:51] today
[1:48:55] Oh Glory to God
[1:48:58] Hallelujah
[1:49:00] I remember look what a George right here
[1:49:01] he will never forget that
[1:49:03] I was in Belmont
[1:49:06] he had a pump pump gas lamp in those
[1:49:09] days go to the well and get water
[1:49:12] and and before we even build this model
[1:49:14] wooden church was up in a house pumping
[1:49:16] gas stamp and praying his right updates
[1:49:18] where I saw my first vision
[1:49:20] I had a day travel walk into kaiwell
[1:49:23] I had about three people in service
[1:49:26] tell me you say why why didn't steal
[1:49:29] you will leave quite from Belmont around
[1:49:30] 323 people
[1:49:31] and I told them I said when you repent
[1:49:33] Google forgive you
[1:49:37] and he repented next day
[1:49:39] because I didn't come to treat people I
[1:49:42] came to push the word
[1:49:44] it didn't matter it were three people
[1:49:45] well from them three people we have a
[1:49:48] group here now
[1:49:49] at church here now
[1:49:51] you see we don't know why God will take
[1:49:53] us
[1:49:55] when we broke into broadly kindness 1981
[1:49:57] it was a vision it was a prayer meeting
[1:49:59] and I showed his vision and I saw a
[1:50:02] sheet dropped down and in words the
[1:50:04] second comes the Lord
[1:50:05] and I went to find that message to find
[1:50:08] out if there was a message preached by
[1:50:09] Brother Brahman was and then that
[1:50:11] message you see when the church finds
[1:50:12] his bloody love when the children and I
[1:50:14] said church this have to be revealed and
[1:50:16] God broke the Revelation and then poured
[1:50:18] his Spirit on top of it
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:22] listen carefully God broke the
[1:50:24] Revelation and put the spirit on top of
[1:50:26] it changed my life completely
[1:50:29] and I can't hold a ought against anybody
[1:50:31] I could bust it to your face I could
[1:50:34] tell you like it is but there's not one
[1:50:36] ought behind that I could slam you on
[1:50:38] the ground and roll on the floor with
[1:50:40] you but there was not one ought behind
[1:50:41] that I still love you
[1:50:45] but I will tell you the truth
[1:50:47] I wouldn't fool you I wouldn't mind my
[1:50:50] guy here I will tell you the truth
[1:50:51] because the truth alone was set you free
[1:50:53] so I'm not going to set you up if I
[1:50:55] can't tell the truth I may as well get
[1:50:57] all the pulpits because if I can't be
[1:50:59] honest with you I can't be honest with
[1:51:00] god oh give the Lord some praises
[1:51:04] Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:51:06] so certain things are like part of me is
[1:51:09] green inside of me
[1:51:11] I hope that I could impact and share
[1:51:13] some of it with you a long life Journey
[1:51:15] that you could be empowered in your
[1:51:18] marriage in your as a husband as a wife
[1:51:20] as a father as a mother that you could
[1:51:22] be effectively empowered to deal with
[1:51:24] your challenges and issues
[1:51:25] Oh Glory to God Amen see I can't tell
[1:51:28] you love your wife and I know loving
[1:51:29] Minds
[1:51:32] you're gonna have a problem with
[1:51:33] Brothers talking Knights and sisters and
[1:51:35] bitching their sisters nice and they
[1:51:36] catch you their wife nice that's a
[1:51:37] problem that's a serious problem because
[1:51:40] charity big is at home so that love had
[1:51:42] to express love is not talking
[1:51:45] son
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:51:51] so love is the talk
[1:51:53] till you ring it it may look like a bell
[1:51:56] but you don't have nothing inside to
[1:51:57] make the noise
[1:51:59] yeah
[1:52:01] a stronger than a song till you sing it
[1:52:04] it could be a poem
[1:52:06] love is not love until you could give it
[1:52:10] away love wasn't given for you to stay
[1:52:12] love was given for you to give it away
[1:52:14] so you have to give love
[1:52:17] you're looking for love looking for love
[1:52:18] when you find it
[1:52:20] any wrong person come to introduce you
[1:52:22] to love
[1:52:25] don't look for love receive love
[1:52:28] receive God's love
[1:52:30] be empowered love get off your
[1:52:32] selfishness and as soon as you begin to
[1:52:34] look out for others God will look out
[1:52:37] for you
[1:52:39] I don't know why I'm saying all this
[1:52:40] thing about a punch
[1:52:42] I don't know why I'm inside of there
[1:52:44] this morning
[1:52:45] but as soon as you begin to look out for
[1:52:47] others Google look out for you
[1:52:49] oh look out for your brother local for
[1:52:51] your sister don't talk them down they'll
[1:52:53] talk them out there are people inside
[1:52:55] here I know in conditions but I know God
[1:52:56] will deliver them
[1:52:58] and I am prophesying for them I am
[1:53:00] preaching because I believe in God for
[1:53:01] them I know they will set you free
[1:53:04] because you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:53:05] God your spirit messed up
[1:53:10] that has nothing to do with that
[1:53:12] predestinated see that God sit in your
[1:53:15] soul
[1:53:18] you may be seated
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:27] there's a reason why we never cross the
[1:53:29] light
[1:53:31] there's a reason why
[1:53:34] I never said other person there's a
[1:53:35] reason why we don't bad talk and blast
[1:53:38] other ministers and churches and groups
[1:53:40] it has always been this way
[1:53:43] it's not no we're living like that we
[1:53:45] have always lived that
[1:53:48] one time I didn't want nobody from
[1:53:50] another messages coming to this church
[1:53:54] I used to express that and that's why we
[1:53:56] went on the fees I said prefer go and
[1:53:58] win sinners
[1:53:59] to the Lord
[1:54:00] and I mean I know I said it before and I
[1:54:02] see it again and one time I was doing
[1:54:04] some Evangelical walking me out there
[1:54:05] and afterwards people wasn't coming I
[1:54:07] said Lord if nobody come next week I'll
[1:54:09] stop in it and I stopped it
[1:54:11] I remember kindly asked me about
[1:54:13] congoose
[1:54:15] he said we could do that
[1:54:17] I said totally know that and after six
[1:54:20] months the Lord spoke to me and let me
[1:54:21] go back now
[1:54:22] and we have baptism after baptism after
[1:54:24] baptism
[1:54:25] what's the right time
[1:54:27] you know why I didn't want people on the
[1:54:28] changes because it's too complex they
[1:54:31] come from a certain background and they
[1:54:32] taught a certain way and you have to
[1:54:34] almost until teach them and say listen
[1:54:35] don't don't come with your stuff
[1:54:39] so when Sinners come I could just Jam
[1:54:40] the word on them and see them transform
[1:54:43] and so many people on me out they're
[1:54:44] still here today
[1:54:46] God bless them
[1:54:48] it was a god-inspired move
[1:54:52] so anybody say that people select they
[1:54:54] are liars
[1:54:56] sit on top of the tongue
[1:55:00] and if God kept us
[1:55:03] kept us we don't press the lighting why
[1:55:05] don't try the person like now when I
[1:55:07] know the power coming
[1:55:08] and the elect will follow the spirit
[1:55:11] When the Spirit Fall you can't stop the
[1:55:14] EC from going toward them duck like
[1:55:16] water you know you send them
[1:55:19] look into water you know
[1:55:22] when that rain began to fall duck will
[1:55:24] find the water
[1:55:25] God waiting to lose the spirit
[1:55:28] that is going to be a Revival in
[1:55:31] Trinidad
[1:55:38] I don't know when I close any here
[1:55:40] because up to no one look at the watch I
[1:55:41] don't even notice that
[1:55:44] right now
[1:55:46] it's a purpose right I ain't looking at
[1:55:47] it what's tonight

[1:59:06] around the world but the gospel is not
[1:59:09] the Bible altogether Paul said the
[1:59:12] gospel came to us not in word only but
[1:59:15] truth power and demonstration of the
[1:59:18] Holy Ghost and in order to preach the
[1:59:20] gospel before you can make the gospel
[1:59:23] preach you've got to have the power
[1:59:25] and demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:59:28] to prove the gospel the letter kill it
[1:59:31] but the spirit make it alive it is not a
[1:59:34] ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a
[1:59:37] real living reality of the resurrection
[1:59:40] of Jesus Christ living among men

[2:00:04] that
[2:00:06] power of the Gospel will deal with every
[2:00:08] necromancy obia Spirit demon assignment
[2:00:11] cancel it reverse it send it backward
[2:00:14] come from the power of the Gospel or
[2:00:17] glory to God loosen this last day is to
[2:00:20] free you from all witchcraft from all
[2:00:22] torment Oh Glory to God all Spirits

[2:00:37] up here
[2:00:39] bring back the
[2:00:40] back to the word now what is this
[2:00:42] messenger of Malachi fought to do
[2:00:44] restore back
[2:00:46] the original fate
[2:00:48] yet the resurrection Faith what is that
[2:00:51] fate that the sin Jesus after he was
[2:00:54] raised from the dead seen him working
[2:00:57] among them
[2:00:59] they were men of few words they went
[2:01:02] forth and preached the word oh my and I
[2:01:04] come to the last quote and I wrap up
[2:01:06] this image right here this is the part
[2:01:07] there is some condemnation by
[2:01:09] representation and he was praying he
[2:01:12] said let us pray now you think it's over
[2:01:15] they can play something something
[2:01:17] he said uh
[2:01:19] Lord knowing that I'm a mortal
[2:01:22] and soon I shall go
[2:01:24] my days are getting many now
[2:01:26] soon I'll be 52 years on this Earth and
[2:01:29] Lord I want to be faithful
[2:01:31] I want to be true to the end
[2:01:33] around the world Many Many Nations
[2:01:35] peoples tongues races seeing many Creeds
[2:01:37] and seeing them how they mix them up and
[2:01:40] all their different faces and
[2:01:42] frustrations when in those places there
[2:01:44] are many true children many men and
[2:01:46] women in those places over in that
[2:01:48] hybrid field there that truly don't want
[2:01:51] to be there
[2:01:52] they think they are doing God's will
[2:01:54] I pray thee father this morning to take
[2:01:57] away all doubts from my little group
[2:01:58] here today
[2:01:59] and from those who will be listening
[2:02:01] unto the tapes that you will take away
[2:02:03] all the man-made Creeds as Jesus when he
[2:02:06] came the first time he found them
[2:02:08] teaching things that wasn't from the
[2:02:10] beginning
[2:02:11] father so it is now at the near coming
[2:02:13] of Jesus again just like the vine if the
[2:02:16] vine put forth a branch and that Branch
[2:02:18] was a Pentecostal Branch filled with the
[2:02:21] Holy Ghost and signs and wonders of
[2:02:22] fruits fall in that Branch if that vine
[2:02:24] ever put forth another Branch it will be
[2:02:27] the same kind of Branch we know that
[2:02:28] father by Nature itself but we do know
[2:02:31] that you can graft any fruit that's
[2:02:33] pertaining to that into the vine and
[2:02:36] will live by Divine and we know that we
[2:02:39] can take orange tree and grow citrus
[2:02:40] fruits of different kinds seven or eight
[2:02:43] we can put the lemons on it and it'll
[2:02:45] grow right in citrus fruit it will grow
[2:02:47] grapefruit and many others tangerines
[2:02:49] and so forth but if that tree brings
[2:02:51] forth its own Branch it will be orange
[2:02:53] Lord
[2:02:54] it's been like the first one was here we
[2:02:57] go and this is where I get the
[2:02:58] inspiration from for this morning and we
[2:03:00] believe there is to be a church in these
[2:03:03] last days
[2:03:04] that will receive both former and
[2:03:06] lattering it will be scattered
[2:03:08] throughout the world in this loud
[2:03:10] Eastern Church age it will be a church
[2:03:12] that is called back to the original
[2:03:14] faith in God it will be a church that
[2:03:16] have Jesus Christ walking in it
[2:03:18] manifesting himself and the shout of the
[2:03:21] king will be in it may the Lord bless
[2:03:24] you as we want to stand and worship
