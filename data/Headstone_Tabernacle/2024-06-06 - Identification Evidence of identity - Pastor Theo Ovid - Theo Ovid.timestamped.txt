[32:56] it's good to be here in the house of God
[32:58] tonight we're reading from verse 13 of
[33:02] Luke 24 we read and behold two of them
[33:05] went that same day to a village called
[33:07] Emos which was about uh uh from
[33:10] Jerusalem about three score full arms
[33:12] and they talked together of all these
[33:14] things which had happened it came to
[33:16] pass that while they commune together
[33:18] and reason Jesus came himself Drew near
[33:22] and went with them and their eyes were
[33:25] Holden that they should not know him and
[33:27] he said to them what manner of
[33:29] communications are these that he have
[33:31] one to another as he walk on Assad and
[33:33] one of them whose name was Copus
[33:35] answering said unto him art thou only a
[33:37] stranger in Jerusalem Hast not known the
[33:40] things which are come to pass in these
[33:42] days he said unto them what things and
[33:44] they said unto him concerning Jesus of
[33:46] Nazareth which is a prophet Mighty in
[33:48] deed and word before God and all the
[33:50] people how the chief priest and our
[33:52] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[33:55] death and have crucified him and we
[33:56] trusted in it had been he which should
[33:59] have redeemed Israel and besides all
[34:01] this today is the third day since these
[34:03] things were done yeah and certain woman
[34:05] also over company M astonished were at
[34:09] earlier the SE Falon and when they not
[34:11] they had found not his body they came
[34:13] saying they have seen visions of angels
[34:16] which said he was alive and certain of
[34:17] them which were with us went to the SE
[34:20] Fula and found it even as the woman had
[34:22] said but him this one not then he said
[34:24] unto them oh
[34:25] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[34:29] the the prophets have spoken ought not
[34:32] Christ have suffered these things and to
[34:35] enter into his glory and beginning at
[34:38] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[34:40] unto them in all the scriptures the
[34:42] things concerning himself reading from
[34:46] verse
[34:48] 44 and he said and he said unto them
[34:50] these are the words which I speak unto
[34:54] you while I was yet with you that all
[34:57] things must be fulfilled which were
[34:59] written in the law of Moses and in the
[35:02] prophets and in the Psalms concerning me
[35:06] then open he their understanding that
[35:10] they might understand the scriptures we
[35:12] go down to verse
[35:16] 49 and he's speaking this promise to
[35:18] them now and behold I send the promise
[35:21] of my father upon you but tiing the
[35:24] seity of Jerusalem until you be inw
[35:27] power from high and he led them as far
[35:29] as out as far as to Bethany and he
[35:32] lifted up his hands and blessed them and
[35:34] it came to
[35:35] pass while he blessed them he was parted
[35:38] from them and carried up into heaven and
[35:40] they worshiped him and returned to
[35:43] Jerusalem with great joy and were
[35:45] continually in the temple praising and
[35:47] blessing God Amen let's pray once more
[35:49] father we have read your word and we
[35:51] thank you for your word your word is
[35:52] truth your word is light your word is
[35:54] life we are depending upon this oh God
[35:57] feed us tonight and bless your word and
[36:00] confirm your word with signs wonders and
[36:01] miracles and outpour your spirit upon
[36:04] the seed in the people's heart and upon
[36:06] their lives in Jesus name I ask it amen
[36:08] you may be seated oh blessed be the name
[36:10] of the Lord oh praise God and I know uh
[36:13] you were blessed by the service on
[36:16] Sunday and and and I didn't get I
[36:18] haven't heard it but but God I know God
[36:20] has blessed you and and tonight amen and
[36:25] tonight I have a title um
[36:30] identification evidence of identity and
[36:33] I know about Isaac spoke about the
[36:34] mystery of a spiritual identity but I
[36:36] have something
[36:38] identification evidence of identity and
[36:41] I have an inspiration an
[36:44] identification identifying that this
[36:47] person has been
[36:48] redeemed that's inspiration an
[36:51] identification identifying that this
[36:53] person has been
[36:55] redeemed identification is the act of
[36:58] identifying or the state of being
[37:02] identified identification evidence of
[37:04] identity who are you not so much what
[37:07] you do but defining who you are your
[37:11] actual
[37:12] existence so sometime you ask who are
[37:14] you not what your job is not what your
[37:18] profession is but you could be
[37:20] identified by profession also and and
[37:22] other matters but we just speaking about
[37:24] the who are you part and who are you
[37:28] it speaks to your character it not speak
[37:31] to your position or office or what
[37:33] position you could be a president you
[37:34] could be a CEO you could be a boss you
[37:37] could be a principal you could be a
[37:38] doctor it doesn't matter what you do as
[37:41] a profession but who are
[37:43] you so we're not talking about your
[37:45] social identity professional Identity or
[37:48] whether your father mother relationship
[37:50] identity talking about who you are now
[37:53] your character is not your reputation
[37:58] reputation is what people think about
[37:59] you assume about you think that this is
[38:02] so in in in in words that identify a
[38:05] reputation it refers to the collective
[38:08] perception or estimation of an
[38:11] individual sometimes people reputation
[38:13] is do in harmony with their character
[38:15] people think they are that but not that
[38:17] they have a reputation to be that but
[38:19] when they Mark bus as we just say in
[38:22] local terms is a different thing
[38:23] altogether am so what we look at now as
[38:27] to who is not your reputation yeah you
[38:30] have some what you call white color
[38:32] Crooks white color criminals um but the
[38:36] the reputation is not that good the
[38:38] reputation is fine to society but the
[38:40] character is not right here okay now
[38:42] listen to this now if God go acted any
[38:48] one time on a certain
[38:49] circumstance and if that same
[38:52] circumstance rise again he's got to act
[38:55] the second time like he did the first
[38:56] time or he's unjust no matter how bad
[39:00] you are in sin how stupid you may be
[39:02] become he's got to act to you like he
[39:06] did that Fallen woman or he acted wrong
[39:10] there do you believe that and here it
[39:13] here it is now because he's got to act
[39:17] to you like he did that Fallen woman or
[39:20] he acted
[39:21] wrong God's behavior is his person I I
[39:27] think a revelation needed about that
[39:29] about God's Behavior it expresses the
[39:33] person of God not what you think not
[39:36] what you feel so he's saying God's
[39:38] Behavior to this woman caught in
[39:40] adultery God Behavior to this woman at
[39:43] the well is his person oh give the Lord
[39:46] some Praises I don't think you get
[39:49] that so he can't behave to one person
[39:52] and then when the same situation come he
[39:53] behaved differently God's Behavior has
[39:56] his person his behavior have to be
[39:58] consistent because he is God oh glory to
[40:02] God good could we give the Lord some
[40:03] Praises you
[40:06] [Applause]
[40:07] now the prophet we living in a days of

[41:43] Prophet our
[41:46] character molds us to the image of what
[41:49] we
[41:50] are our character of life that's in us
[41:55] and if you take that Little Gym of life
[41:57] life it'll produce a bird or wheat or a
[42:00] corn or whatever it is the life that's
[42:05] in it molds the character of it now this
[42:08] is deep tonight this is
[42:12] not Corn Flakes and
[42:14] milk all
[42:16] right then we find out like the life of
[42:19] a cancer a germ a cancer germ it molds a
[42:24] cancer it's an evil life that life of a
[42:27] tumor with mold a tumor you see our
[42:31] characters is molded by what's on the
[42:34] inside of us and our outside only
[42:39] expresses what on the
[42:41] inside No
[42:44] Excuses so when people act they act out
[42:47] or the spirit get called out or the
[42:49] spirit live out and try to explain it I
[42:52] mean no no no you have no explanation
[42:54] you acted out because something on the
[42:56] inside
[42:59] and whatever on the inside will come on
[43:01] the outside despite what your mou
[43:04] talking besid what your words are
[43:08] saying all right so our characters is
[43:11] molded by what on the inside of us and
[43:15] our outside only expresses what's on the
[43:18] inside what we are how we walk no matter
[43:22] what we say our life speaks louder than
[43:26] our word does
[43:27] we might say I'm a Believer in God well
[43:29] I would say well do you believe all the
[43:30] Bible I don't know well you see that's
[43:33] your lips your very life is speaking
[43:35] louder than what your words would be if
[43:37] you say I'm a Christian and you believe
[43:39] what God Said is the truth then live any
[43:42] kind of life after that your life speaks
[43:44] louder than what your testimony does one
[43:46] of the greatest hindrance what the
[43:47] Church of God has The Bootlegger The
[43:49] Gambler we all know what which way they
[43:52] are headed they know themselves but the
[43:54] fellow that professes to be a Christian
[43:56] the woman that profess to be a Christian
[43:58] then lives and something different is
[44:00] the greatest stumbling block that's the
[44:02] outside world has got and there there is
[44:05] in the outside world anywhere it's worse
[44:07] than anything the world can produce is a
[44:08] person that's supposed to be a Christian
[44:10] and then live some something different
[44:12] from that lying stealing cheating doing
[44:15] things that he ought not to do is a
[44:17] discredit or test testimony and when you
[44:19] take people and to do those things and
[44:21] they say our and that's why he say our
[44:24] character is molded in dear by the life
[44:28] that's in us now we would say Jesus came
[44:31] to save that which was lost that's what
[44:33] he did now there had to be something to
[44:36] save this lost it had to be a different
[44:38] character so watch how we approaching
[44:40] this right now a character have to save
[44:43] what was lost a different kind because
[44:46] when God diping dip from us now all have
[44:48] sin and come short to Glory he dip his

[50:57] displayed and how to make a character
[51:01] that could redeem this woman it had to
[51:03] be something greater than her to redeem
[51:06] her you can't be in the water struggling
[51:09] for your life and trying to save

[51:19] because you you you struggling for life
[51:23] you both struggling and you think this
[51:26] person you could prop you prop pushing
[51:28] them deep in the hole in water so you
[51:31] have to come out of
[51:33] that you have to come into the place and
[51:35] you have to see yourself in that
[51:40] position mentally
[51:42] first a lot of people they they
[51:46] paralyzing the
[51:48] head they need a brain
[51:51] transplant a thinking transplant the
[51:55] Bible talk about the renewing of your
[51:56] mind
[51:57] if your mind don't change you Ain
[51:58] changing nothing because the word come
[52:00] to affect or infect your mind and your
[52:06] thoughts and that is the same thing the
[52:08] devil does infect your mind and thoughts
[52:11] to produce unbelief but once you see you
[52:14] your mind get infected with faith and
[52:16] the thoughts of God it changes your
[52:24] thinking but the Gideon s us a story
[52:27] of a young man who wasn't s in
[52:30] school and somebody say why don't you
[52:34] take the SAT
[52:35] test and he did it and out of, 1600 he
[52:39] get
[52:41] 1470 his mother tell him I sure you
[52:44] cheat cuz she know that capable of that
[52:47] he said cheat she said momy I didn't
[52:49] cheat and he's had to tell himself
[52:51] suppose I really bright
[52:54] boy Fleck the strong
[52:57] 10 years later he's very successful he
[52:59] went and Friends he he get better
[53:01] friends and and went to college and
[53:03] school and graduated and become very
[53:04] successful 10 years later the S people
[53:07] call
[53:08] him and tell him some people get errors
[53:12] the wrong
[53:13] result you really didn't get
[53:16] 1450 you get
[53:20] 740 now here what he said the guy said
[53:23] he said his life changed when he got
[53:25] that score of 14 something or when he
[53:28] begin to
[53:30] think that he got that score his mind
[53:34] changed and now based upon the score he
[53:38] thought he
[53:39] got success was just waiting for him to
[53:42] step on
[53:44] it now that they tell him you really
[53:46] get4 words he
[53:48] FL that is
[53:50] irrelevant because my mind already
[53:53] succeeded
[53:57] so you are what you think you
[54:00] are as a man think it in his heart so is
[54:05] he or so he is if you think you're going
[54:07] to fail you will fail if you think
[54:10] you're going to fall you're going to
[54:11] fall but what if you think you're
[54:12] overcoming what if you think you'll get
[54:15] Victory what if you think God will
[54:17] multiply and act to you and make a way
[54:19] for you and give you the wisdom and
[54:20] knowledge and understanding to manage
[54:22] the challenges that is yet before you oh

[1:07:03] one like a Dy
[1:07:06] battle bunch of
[1:07:08] foolishness ministers arrogant as ever
[1:07:12] we have it here and them and those hallu
[1:07:16] continue I want to go there
[1:07:18] tonight Hallelujah that's that's right
[1:07:22] he said watch a token is what you use in
[1:07:24] a bus ride airplane your ticket is your
[1:07:26] token take your token you're redeemed
[1:07:28] the blessing the Holy Spirit and then
[1:07:30] Satan try to push something on you you
[1:07:32] show him this that is your
[1:07:36] identification Oh Glory to God you
[1:07:38] identify in the resurrection of Christ
[1:07:40] you identify in his death when you die
[1:07:43] you identify in his resurrection and by
[1:07:45] that it identify you that you were with
[1:07:48] him before the foundation of the world
[1:07:50] cuz you are redeemed Glory Hallelujah
[1:07:54] Hallelujah
[1:07:56] that's brought back all the father had
[1:07:58] given me will come notice he was sinless
[1:08:00] to take the place of the sinful the
[1:08:02] antidote he was without sin that he
[1:08:04] might redeem Sinners and brother Bram
[1:08:07] now this was the perfect lamb Christ was
[1:08:09] and went through the shed of shed of
[1:08:11] this lamb the natural lamb in Egypt the
[1:08:13] blood was applied then it was it stood
[1:08:15] for token and that would be the blood of
[1:08:17] this lamb stand for and listen the token
[1:08:21] that we are dead to ourselves and
[1:08:23] identified with our sacrifice
[1:08:26] then the lamb the blood and the person
[1:08:29] become identified together so that's why
[1:08:31] when they killing the lamb you have to
[1:08:32] put your hand on it you can't say God
[1:08:36] blood that taking your life you that you
[1:08:40] know you was to die you know the lamb
[1:08:42] DED in your stead so you put your hand
[1:08:44] on the lamb and the priest cut the neck
[1:08:47] and you feel when the life the spirit
[1:08:48] life leaves the lamb and you know you
[1:08:50] should have died and that lamb taken
[1:08:52] your place therefore you identify maybe
[1:08:54] a hand get blood than it but you
[1:08:56] identify with that lamb there that
[1:08:58] sacrifice isn't that right the sacrifice
[1:09:00] and the believer you identified in his
[1:09:02] life by your sacrifice then the blood
[1:09:04] was a token of identification the blood
[1:09:07] identify that the worshipper had slain
[1:09:09] the lamb accepted the lamb and applied
[1:09:11] the toen to himself he was not ashamed
[1:09:14] he didn't care who saw it he wanted
[1:09:16] everybody to see it it was placed in a
[1:09:18] position that everybody passing by could
[1:09:21] see that token there's no private
[1:09:22] Christianity there's no private believer
[1:09:25] there's no private you want nobody know
[1:09:26] nobody see you have to understand your
[1:09:29] testimony has to become public so stop
[1:09:31] sining in
[1:09:34] private because all would have private
[1:09:37] had to come
[1:09:38] public so many people want to be
[1:09:40] Christian they want to do it secretly
[1:09:43] nobody would think that they're
[1:09:44] Christians they associates they run with
[1:09:46] think well I I want to be a Christian I
[1:09:48] don't want so and so to know about it
[1:09:49] see Christianity has to display its
[1:09:52] token publicly in public life at the
[1:09:55] office on the street when troubl is
[1:09:57] around anything in church everywhere
[1:09:59] else the blood is the token the token
[1:10:01] must be applied even the Covenant is not
[1:10:04] in effect now listen to the part I want
[1:10:06] to get to the blood we get inspiration
[1:10:09] from the blood was a token or an
[1:10:12] identification identifying this person
[1:10:14] who has been redeemed and the blood now
[1:10:17] is the Holy Ghost so the token which is
[1:10:20] the entire life from Faith all the way
[1:10:22] to charity is an identific oh
[1:10:27] wo one man brother Bram he had
[1:10:31] that he had the full atonement and
[1:10:34] that's why when the woman come up to him
[1:10:36] on deep the deep and she bunks and she
[1:10:37] feel that presence he said that just his
[1:10:40] presence because a Life Tabernacle

[1:15:36] voice without a life a voice without
[1:15:38] being a live voice it's just words a man
[1:15:43] could talk and I talk understand when
[1:15:46] Jesus told the devil it is written it
[1:15:48] wasn't a human natural man with
[1:15:51] words he had a life behind that as it
[1:15:53] written
[1:15:55] yes hallu you get it now so it really
[1:15:59] take a little voice does the T that

[1:16:21] exal say and everything else and devil
[1:16:24] say oh oh forget it that's your
[1:16:26] reputation that's not his character
[1:16:29] because I met that character before I
[1:16:32] met It Through the Ages I saw the
[1:16:34] character in Peter I saw it in William
[1:16:37] Brown Hallelujah and when I see it in a
[1:16:39] bride I will know because I encounter
[1:16:42] that oh give the Lord a shout you're not
[1:16:45] here to impress me I'm not here to
[1:16:46] impress you we have to impress God he
[1:16:49] said that God can see faith and virtue
[1:16:51] and knowledge operating in us that God
[1:16:54] must see that the pastor God hallelujah
[1:16:58] that God can see these things operating
[1:17:00] in us
[1:17:03] myall so much he was the word full the
[1:17:06] word flow through him so freely that he
[1:17:09] could speak the word it would create
[1:17:11] that show he was who can create but God
[1:17:14] no other nature could do it no other
[1:17:15] nature could no character nothing in
[1:17:17] heaven nothing else that's why he said
[1:17:19] who is worthy to take the book Angels
[1:17:22] nobody has had the character except
[1:17:24] Christ man when he was bornn in sin
[1:17:26] shape iniquity comes into the world
[1:17:27] speaking lines is that right there's
[1:17:29] nothing in him at all so you see if he
[1:17:31] was in God's thoughts watch how we
[1:17:33] connect this that brother George man sin
[1:17:36] iniquity speaking lies but if he was in
[1:17:39] God's thoughts when he come to the world
[1:17:43] he come in God thoughts at the beginning
[1:17:45] to display his attribute do you follow
[1:17:47] me listen to these words then Jesus came
[1:17:50] to break the clouds back so the
[1:17:52] attribute could display itself
[1:17:55] so we born in s we smoking drinking
[1:17:57] fooling wrong and whatnot right all
[1:17:59] right Jesus come to break the clouds
[1:18:02] that the attribute which is the thought
[1:18:04] could display itself and our display is
[1:18:07] through the word now we bypass the word
[1:18:10] part so we come from thought to flesh
[1:18:13] that's drama the drama in thought and
[1:18:15] flesh is plenty drama because now you
[1:18:17] could face Temptation and trials and
[1:18:20] testing and whatnot what we did not know
[1:18:23] is that the tempt and nral testing was
[1:18:26] the means by which God will form us to
[1:18:31] the word
[1:18:32] image so your trials and testings is
[1:18:35] more important to you than you think you
[1:18:38] seen it as pressure pressure pressure
[1:18:40] but God SE is are shaping shaping
[1:18:42] shaping oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:18:44] come on now give the Lord a
[1:18:47] shout glory to God I'll say it again
[1:18:51] your trials and testing means more to
[1:18:54] you than you think you feel you were
[1:18:56] dead you will not die oh give the Lord
[1:18:58] some Praises this go kill me it will not
[1:19:01] kill you God trying to do something to
[1:19:04] you for you through You by
[1:19:16] youall He Is God expressed word nothing
[1:19:20] else could be manifested other the other
[1:19:22] characters were Fallen he came as a
[1:19:24] redeemer and Redeemer means to bring it
[1:19:26] back okay it was God's T you think

[1:25:10] mustard seed that grew into a tree
[1:25:12] wherein large the fs of the a at her
[1:25:15] head will be the Antichrist the mystery
[1:25:18] of iniquity all this is true and if this
[1:25:21] is true then it must also be true that
[1:25:24] that the bright church here we go will
[1:25:28] mature and her rightness here we go
[1:25:31] shall be an
[1:25:34] identification with her Lord by means of
[1:25:36] the word and her head who will come to
[1:25:40] her is the mystery of godliness which is
[1:25:42] Christ and as the false church with all
[1:25:45] cunning and diabolical power made up of
[1:25:47] political force physical Force Demons of
[1:25:49] Darkness come against the True Vine the
[1:25:51] True Vine with the fullness of the
[1:25:53] spirit and the word will do the very
[1:25:56] acts of power that Jesus did then as she

[1:26:03] bride and groom will be United
[1:26:05] forever but what I want to get you is
[1:26:07] that her
[1:26:09] rightness her ripeness shall be an
[1:26:12] identification with the Lord Hallelujah
[1:26:14] by means of the word hallelujah you say
[1:26:16] ripe Hallelujah then you could take the
[1:26:19] word Oh Glory to God because the word is
[1:26:22] going to identify how righte you are
[1:26:24] when that word bust on you and break on
[1:26:26] you and your response to it the word
[1:26:29] will testify whether you are ripe or
[1:26:31] notu all right let me hit the home
[1:26:33] stretch here now let me see uh page
[1:26:35] seven now going to page eight we just
[1:26:37] have 12
[1:26:38] pages but BR scripture we read Jesus
[1:26:43] appear among his disciples walking he
[1:26:46] withhold himself from them from him
[1:26:48] knowing him so the thought was just a
[1:26:51] man so Jesus said what going on said but
[1:26:53] you know what going on
[1:26:54] The Stranger In This Place Jesus of
[1:26:56] Nazareth crucified and long testimony
[1:26:58] and S and Jesus busted them he call them
[1:27:02] fools where some people call them fool
[1:27:04] they leave the church one
[1:27:06] time last first and last service call
[1:27:09] them fools nothing that he call them
[1:27:11] slow of heart all your dull you I mean
[1:27:15] your mind dull three and a half years
[1:27:17] are talking his word to you and know you
[1:27:20] seey you
[1:27:22] know slow of heart to believe all what
[1:27:25] the prophet said watch him this is
[1:27:28] Brother BR he refers right back to the
[1:27:30] word of God he never come right out and
[1:27:33] told them don't you know me I'm the
[1:27:35] Messiah that's resurrected he never said
[1:27:38] that so when pastors go in par the
[1:27:42] beef sh muscles and
[1:27:44] parading Jesus never did that Hallelujah
[1:27:47] he never said that he just give them the
[1:27:49] scripture like John did who are you are
[1:27:52] the Messiah voice of one CR of
[1:27:54] wilderness go and read your
[1:27:56] Bible John never sees that he just voice
[1:27:59] one CR go read the scriptures I sh you
[1:28:02] the approach they had to pick that out
[1:28:04] themselves they had to judge for
[1:28:06] themselves judge for yourself fool slow
[1:28:09] of heart to believe all that the
[1:28:11] prophets have said come to pass what a
[1:28:13] rebuke to them that claim they knew him
[1:28:16] notice here we goang how he approached
[1:28:19] the subject he never come right out and
[1:28:21] said uh well don't you know I'm your
[1:28:23] mist Messiah for this age don't you know
[1:28:26] that I am he the real servant of God
[1:28:31] never Clarance never identify himself
[1:28:35] that way the scripture identify who he
[1:28:42] is this is thus sayth the
[1:28:46] Lord he called your attention to what
[1:28:49] the prophet said what took place oh
[1:28:51] fools slow of heart not to believe all
[1:28:54] that the prophet said about the Messiah
[1:28:57] so he as John let the word of the Bible
[1:29:00] identify what he was to them oh give the
[1:29:04] Lord some
[1:29:06] Praises so brother Bram is a total
[1:29:08] separation we are not to go back in the
[1:29:10] world no more he said or have anything
[1:29:12] to do with the world but cleave to God
[1:29:14] Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a
[1:29:16] church that is separated from the things
[1:29:18] of the world or the cares of the world
[1:29:19] she is separated from the Fashions of
[1:29:21] this Modern Age We Liv in she's
[1:29:22] separated only to God
[1:29:24] and he is the word and as husband and
[1:29:27] wife is one so does the bride and the
[1:29:29] word becomes one for the word is living
[1:29:33] through the bride that's her credentials
[1:29:36] that's her identification what's
[1:29:38] identification I I believe
[1:29:42] trumpets what what's I have a book
[1:29:44] called

[1:29:48] picture of the Prophet with clo over
[1:29:50] your head
[1:29:57] what's our identification the
[1:29:59] word
[1:30:01] living through the bride why don't the
[1:30:04] ministers tell the people
[1:30:07] that why do they tell the people that
[1:30:09] what is being preached and what they
[1:30:11] have is better than anybody
[1:30:14] else this word living in the bright is
[1:30:16] for everywhere you know that not a local
[1:30:19] thing you know that not a Trinidad thing

[1:33:52] character what's ins the person let me
[1:33:54] see I can finish
[1:33:55] here let's strike this here how to
[1:33:58] finish
[1:33:59] this brother brandham talking about
[1:34:02] Joseph Pharaoh made Joseph his son and
[1:34:05] Christ makes his prisoners of love his
[1:34:08] sons he give them power in John 14:12 I
[1:34:12] want to skip quickly notice Joseph
[1:34:15] before he came out he had to be taken
[1:34:18] out and shaved a few things had to be
[1:34:21] shaved off before he could meet his King
[1:34:23] and God sometimes takes his people out
[1:34:26] like that and shaves a few of their own
[1:34:29] Wills
[1:34:32] off this is personal now to show them
[1:34:36] they can't do just what they wanted to
[1:34:40] do now you hear me of times say a man
[1:34:43] conviction is more powerful than the
[1:34:47] word you will hear people talking about
[1:34:49] a standing from
[1:34:50] conviction but conviction off key
[1:34:54] the word say so but you stand for
[1:34:56] conviction I dream this and this dream
[1:34:58] mean that who said so God tell you that
[1:35:01] have Prophet interpret your dream
[1:35:03] suppose you dream backwards suppose you
[1:35:05] see it the wrong way you I'm saying yes
[1:35:08] you're going on with dream but what did
[1:35:09] the word
[1:35:10] say that some Dre I just come open my
[1:35:13] eye and just
[1:35:14] walk I'm not a prophet I can interpret
[1:35:18] it so instead of i t myself oh Json
[1:35:21] whatever it is whatever it is I that
[1:35:23] what God says that that is it I sure is
[1:35:26] I ain't sure the dream but you see what
[1:35:28] this word say here I guarantee this car
[1:35:30] fail I guarantee it know if could it be
[1:35:34] what if it's so what if it's not so is
[1:35:36] Lotto is
[1:35:39] playway I have no time with that so you
[1:35:42] have to shave off a few of our own
[1:35:43] wheels off shows them that they can't do
[1:35:47] just what they wanted to doall could we
[1:35:50] mature enough to come to this spot where
[1:35:52] you really want to surrender your
[1:35:55] will in in so much that you will go
[1:35:58] where God where you don't want to go but
[1:35:59] God sending
[1:36:01] you that's a tough one you know that
[1:36:04] family that Aunt that family you don't
[1:36:07] talk with and what God say go to them
[1:36:09] and you talk to last 20
[1:36:12] years and God telling you go to them
[1:36:15] because God want to do something through
[1:36:17] you for
[1:36:19] them but because is your family and
[1:36:22] because you have no words with them you
[1:36:23] stand by Spirit trying to push you and
[1:36:27] you're
[1:36:29] resisting we have to come to that place
[1:36:32] where God can lead us listen where we
[1:36:34] don't want to
[1:36:35] go but isn't that what God told
[1:36:38] Peter that another would lead you where
[1:36:40] you don't want to go led by the
[1:36:43] spirit that's another level you know
[1:36:46] that's not communication going back home
[1:36:47] you know that is God directing your
[1:36:50] heart the leading of the Lord
[1:36:54] he said shaves a few of our own well
[1:36:56] time going so fast shows them they can't
[1:36:58] do just what they wanted to do you know
[1:36:59] what I mean they're not in Liberty to do
[1:37:01] what they wanted to do before you could
[1:37:03] come into full power
[1:37:06] prophecy when the Press come down what's
[1:37:08] the third P then okay before the all of
[1:37:10] that people like talk that talking when
[1:37:13] the Press come down what you listen to
[1:37:15] this before they could come into full
[1:37:18] power this is what attracts me these are
[1:37:20] the coach that has connect with me
[1:37:22] because I seeing how you say the process
[1:37:26] then because you could see the big
[1:37:28] contract and whatnot but the process to
[1:37:30] get to where you're supposed to be the
[1:37:32] fine print here before they could come
[1:37:35] into full power and be a love slave to
[1:37:39] Christ they have to be shaved off and
[1:37:42] then presented he didn't stop there he
[1:37:45] continues sometimes he takes them to the
[1:37:47] desert Amen to do that Amen to shave
[1:37:52] them off and that desert might be a
[1:37:54] literal desert you that desert might be
[1:37:56] a desert experience in your
[1:37:59] life you know what is to being a desert
[1:38:01] in the spirit realm where you're not
[1:38:04] feeling anything when it is dry when it
[1:38:07] is hot where it is
[1:38:11] burning and it seem like God don't even
[1:38:13] hearing your prayer but you're in a
[1:38:16] desert to do what to be
[1:38:21] saved Hallelujah save amen
[1:38:25] Somebody hallu Sometime he takes them to
[1:38:28] the desert to do that to shave them off
[1:38:30] and then bring them out the anointed one
[1:38:34] to fulfill the purpose that he ordained
[1:38:36] them to be you see what I mean we are
[1:38:39] the
[1:38:40] Brethren
[1:38:42] remember all of the times what he's done
[1:38:44] he always had to take a man and make a
[1:38:47] prisoner to him forsake his own he had
[1:38:49] to forsake everything that he know
[1:38:51] forget all of his trainings everything
[1:38:52] in order to the will of God and to
[1:38:54] follow God he can't follow anything that
[1:38:57] man has got to do and God at the same
[1:38:59] time you can't be going east and west at
[1:39:01] the same time you can't be going right
[1:39:03] and left at the same time you can't be
[1:39:04] doing right and wrong at the same time
[1:39:05] you can't be following man and God at
[1:39:07] the same time either following God or
[1:39:10] following man that if you are following
[1:39:13] God and have submitted yourself to God
[1:39:15] then you become a prisoner to God and to
[1:39:17] the word and to what will no matter what
[1:39:20] anybody else says you become a prisent
[1:39:24] I'm going to finish we on page 10 head
[1:39:27] to 11 we only have 12
[1:39:29] Pages God is known God is not known by
[1:39:37] education that's a fact he is not known
[1:39:41] by how to explain
[1:39:44] it and boy could explain it in his
[1:39:47] message you talk about explain
[1:39:49] it they could explain it God is known by
[1:39:53] Simplicity and of revelation of Jesus
[1:39:56] Christ to the most illiterate person
[1:40:00] upon it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:02] Upon This Rock I be my
[1:40:04] church no other rocks accept it no other
[1:40:07] Protestant Rock no other school but
[1:40:09] exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:11] through the new birth he's born in there
[1:40:13] he injects his own life and your life is
[1:40:15] gone and the life of Christ is projected
[1:40:18] itself through you with the
[1:40:23] and works and signs and wonders he did
[1:40:26] here we go by lack of this Revelation is
[1:40:30] why we have so much different divisions
[1:40:32] Among Us so Revelation doesn't bring
[1:40:35] division lack
[1:40:37] of let me say it again Revelations don't
[1:40:41] bring divisions the lack of Revelation
[1:40:44] and Revelation is God thoughts revealed
[1:40:46] that's Revelation is not you study
[1:40:48] because Peter just spoke it that the
[1:40:50] Christ and Jesus said Flesh and Blood
[1:40:52] hath not feel is unto you but my Father
[1:40:55] in heaven and Peter wasn't educated it
[1:40:57] came from the father straight down into
[1:40:58] his heart it confess it with his lip it
[1:41:01] was God that's Revelation Oh Glory to
[1:41:04] God Hallelujah by lack of Revelation
[1:41:07] that's why we are so much divisions
[1:41:08] among us so much mockery so much
[1:41:10] division Among Us is because the people
[1:41:12] lack that Revelation they lack the
[1:41:15] Revelation the
[1:41:16] teachers so if the teachers lack
[1:41:18] Revelation what they teaching with
[1:41:20] knowledge information they don't have re
[1:41:23] reation the mighty teachers in the
[1:41:25] message lack Revelation and they still
[1:41:28] teaching and they will continue teaching
[1:41:29] straight to the tribulation because
[1:41:31] Revelation is Faith I take Faith to be
[1:41:33] translated you I Rapture in faith not
[1:41:35] Raptor in knowledge Rapture in faith not
[1:41:38] Raptor in knowledge Rapture in fith all
