[42:58] seed that the light has to fall on
[43:01] somewhere in the world the nation itself

[43:33] whole element by Oxford and so forth and
[43:35] they cut out all these Stones all around
[43:37] the world

[44:06] and they cut out all these Stones all
[44:08] around the world and they come together
[44:09] and it was perfect mystery and in 40
[44:12] years in building of the temple there
[44:14] wasn't a buzz or a saw or the song of a
[44:18] hammer every stone went one was cut this
[44:21] way one was cut that way one was cut
[44:24] back this way every one of them went
[44:27] together they started laying the thing
[44:29] putting the building up getting along
[44:31] fine and they found a funny looking
[44:33] Stone
[44:35] they didn't want the thing they said
[44:38] they don't belong here and they kicked
[44:40] it out they throwed it over the weed
[44:42] pile come to find out they build on and
[44:45] on and on come to final the very stone
[44:47] that rejected was received Cornerstone
[44:50] Oh Glory to God are tonight pray under
[44:53] the section have the funny Stone Oh
[44:55] Glory to God hallelujah and today the
[44:58] Methodist the Baptist the Lutheran the
[45:01] Pentacles are everywhere if you don't
[45:03] watch out friends the real Cornerstone
[45:05] you're rejecting it and the Cornerstone
[45:07] in the building of this spiritual house
[45:10] is the Holy Spirit
[45:11] as the Cornerstone
[45:13] a stone that will start from
[45:16] Hallelujah
[45:18] you afraid of it
[45:22] and I believe people afraid of it you
[45:25] are afraid of it you're afraid of
[45:26] fanaticism
[45:29] I know we got a lot of old scarecrow and
[45:31] mockery why if there wasn't that it
[45:33] wouldn't be a real one there's a genuine
[45:36] article of the holy spirit in the
[45:39] baptism
[45:41] let me say it again there's a genuine
[45:43] article of the holy spirit in the
[45:46] baptism
[45:47] that's true no they have rejected it oh
[45:49] we can do that well we can't have that
[45:52] brother Branham watch he said if this
[45:55] Christian religion is to take its first
[45:58] film stand upon the ability of
[46:01] intellectuals then we don't need the
[46:03] Holy Spirit
[46:04] that's right if the Christian faith
[46:07] exists upon educational programs upon
[46:10] the nomination and so forth and the
[46:11] building of big buildings whatever we
[46:13] have today then we do not need the Holy
[46:15] Spirit to run the church but brother
[46:18] this great new spirit that we are
[46:21] speaking about is this new church that
[46:23] Ezekiel Saw was not to be run upon by
[46:26] intellectuals it was to be run by the
[46:29] Holy Spirit
[46:30] that's why they thought about Peter a
[46:32] man and learned
[46:33] filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:35] Oh Glory to God they were unlearned but
[46:38] they were
[46:40] held with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah a
[46:43] man on land but he got the key to the
[46:45] kingdom
[46:46] okay the Lord I shout in the house glory
[46:49] to God
[46:50] and write on the deer is where the
[46:53] brother Brahm said that we said it last
[46:54] service Sunday you cannot bring a
[46:57] message of this brand new Holy Spirit
[46:59] baptism into a dry formal greedy Church
[47:04] you just can't do it you can't hardly
[47:07] get the message to the old former
[47:08] believing and Jesus spoke of that a long
[47:11] time ago
[47:12] when did Jesus talk about that how did
[47:13] Jesus talk about that you know when you
[47:15] talk about that the parable of the new
[47:17] wine in all bottles Oh Glory the God he
[47:20] said cannot put new Holy Ghost wine in
[47:23] dry message bottles oh Gloria God did
[47:26] you hear me tonight you can't put Holy
[47:28] Ghost Wang and dry 40 50 years in the
[47:33] message bottles glory to God he said you
[47:36] put new wine in all bottles well I
[47:37] thought what difference does it make
[47:39] today here we go
[47:41] is he had to go back to the context that
[47:43] Jesus was speaking of to understand that
[47:45] all right it context he said now today
[47:48] he said we have glass bottles but
[47:50] whether it is New or Old it does make a
[47:52] difference but when I visit Eastern
[47:54] countries the Orient I found out the
[47:56] water bottles of that day was made of
[47:58] animal skin
[47:59] and when the animal skin was fresh new
[48:02] skin and when it got all and dry set to
[48:06] take new unfermented wine and put a deer
[48:09] with new wine on fermented with the germ
[48:12] of life in it when it begins to ferment
[48:13] the old butter was so Seth set and stiff
[48:17] there was an explosion
[48:19] it couldn't hold it so Jesus gave the
[48:21] parable you can't put new wine into all
[48:24] bottles the fresh skin or the new skin
[48:26] have oil in it and the oil make it
[48:28] flexible oh God you could stretch you
[48:31] could raise your hands you could say
[48:33] hallelujah they could jump a little bit
[48:35] you could walk a little bit you could
[48:37] dance a little bit Oh Glory to God
[48:40] because it's Holy Ghost this holy ghost
[48:42] that I have the world doesn't give it to
[48:44] me the world and give it the world can't
[48:46] take it away
[48:47] or give the Lord some Praises tonight
[48:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[48:52] how far are we in the message from the
[48:55] scriptures but upon
[49:00] people said dry before they even get you
[49:02] wine do they get new oil
[49:04] to get his skin a little flexible
[49:06] because I'm all in your skin in my ball
[49:08] Hallelujah you might you might even show
[49:10] okay man yes your hand might even go up
[49:13] you might even stand up
[49:15] Oh Glory to God because it's a new
[49:17] bottle depends on you wine these people
[49:21] are not drunk as you suppose Or Glory
[49:23] they're covering the Holy Ghost selling
[49:25] them in the upper room Peter step out
[49:27] and say these people are not drunk as
[49:29] you suppose but this is that wine that
[49:32] the prophet Joel speaker they shall come
[49:35] to pass afterwards I'll Port my spirit
[49:38] and God sent a prophet to turn our
[49:41] hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers
[49:44] back to the faith of the fathers back to
[49:46] that new Wayne back to new wine skin oh
[49:49] give the Lord some Praises glory to God

[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:19] brother Brown
[1:02:20] if the Baptist tell me no
[1:02:22] the methodists the Pentecostal upon the
[1:02:25] initial evidence speaking in tongues
[1:02:26] being the Holy Ghost that's the reason
[1:02:27] we are not Pentecostal we don't believe
[1:02:30] that speaking with tongues makes you
[1:02:31] feel with Holy Ghost no more than we
[1:02:33] believe living in a band would make you
[1:02:34] a pig
[1:02:36] no sir
[1:02:39] or if you have four wheels in our garage
[1:02:42] could be a lot more
[1:02:46] can't see that
[1:02:48] no more than believing enough King's
[1:02:49] Palace will make you a king you could be
[1:02:51] a servant
[1:02:52] you could be anything
[1:02:54] are you ready
[1:02:56] We Believe
[1:02:59] not better overbelief
[1:03:01] he said We Believe
[1:03:03] that you receive the Holy Ghost by an
[1:03:07] experience
[1:03:10] that don't need no interpretation that
[1:03:13] really amazing business
[1:03:20] after all that beat on me according to a
[1:03:22] word
[1:03:26] foreign
[1:03:31] all right let's continue
[1:03:33] We Believe
[1:03:34] that you receive the Holy Ghost by an
[1:03:37] experienced not by mythical intellectual
[1:03:41] conception of the scriptures
[1:03:44] but by an experience that you alone know
[1:03:49] and if you want to know whether it was
[1:03:52] the Holy Ghost watch how your life
[1:03:54] patterns after that
[1:03:56] and it will tell what kind of spirit
[1:03:58] coming to you
[1:04:00] or give the Lord some praises
[1:04:02] so that's a defining statement we reveal
[1:04:05] the Holy Ghost not when you believe
[1:04:10] but by experience
[1:04:12] the other 120 brand new sheepskin
[1:04:16] bottles
[1:04:17] not good skin sheepskin
[1:04:19] it makes the best
[1:04:21] 120 green bottles were setting up a room

[1:13:43] towards the word of God is what wind you
[1:13:46] up with the Holy Ghost if you're taking
[1:13:49] God's word hallelujah I believe the
[1:13:52] Pentacles of church has got the back of
[1:13:53] the Holy Ghost so it takes a baptism
[1:13:56] Holy Ghost to come into the human heart
[1:13:58] to make the thing run right the love of
[1:14:01] God is love and unless each one of these
[1:14:05] gifts is put right in the center of love
[1:14:08] it will become selfish and indifferent
[1:14:11] and pull itself off an isolate itself
[1:14:13] and cross over and first and stew but
[1:14:15] when it's anchored right into the middle
[1:14:17] of love it is fellowship everywhere
[1:14:20] that's exactly what we need the church
[1:14:23] is dying for love brother
[1:14:25] Dying For Love notice what do you say

[1:19:46] when the stone that's rejected
[1:19:51] you mean this don't have to be rejected
[1:19:53] that's right
[1:19:55] then they found the fault where the man
[1:19:57] who was the word
[1:19:58] now the refining fault with the word
[1:20:00] working through the man
[1:20:03] so the stone has to be rejected
[1:20:06] then that rejected stone is what will
[1:20:09] become
[1:20:10] The Headstone
[1:20:12] whoa
[1:20:13] so you mean the brand will be Joseph
[1:20:15] yeah
[1:20:18] Abraham fit
[1:20:20] Isaac love
[1:20:22] Jacob Greece to the perfection
[1:20:25] so you mean a Joseph Perfection bride
[1:20:27] going to be rejected
[1:20:31] that's our portion
[1:20:33] oh glow that's the brightest portion
[1:20:35] Hallelujah that's serious
[1:20:38] I could imagine the timing of it yeah it
[1:20:41] is when that main spring begin to tick
[1:20:44] when the stone that's rejected
[1:20:47] when the love of God is brought back
[1:20:49] amongst the people of God then you're
[1:20:52] going to see the Church of God all
[1:20:54] fellowshipping with one another without
[1:20:56] any friction at all
[1:20:59] do I hear a shout
[1:21:01] on this here
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:04] friction going you know when they come
[1:21:07] back to me in Spring friction getting
[1:21:09] boots when it come out to love of God
[1:21:12] coming back among the people you mean
[1:21:15] have to come yes because of iniquity
[1:21:17] will abom the love of many gonna watch
[1:21:20] call but the prophet prophesy there'll
[1:21:22] be no love left except
[1:21:24] among the elect
[1:21:26] only the elect go have love you can't
[1:21:29] get love outside the elect the elect
[1:21:31] belongs to love because he let go into
[1:21:33] the Land of Love
[1:21:36] praise God praise God could we continue
[1:21:39] just a little more now you remember when
[1:21:42] the service in the Bible said our Lord
[1:21:44] delay is coming
[1:21:45] that's a prophecy too what's the
[1:21:47] evidence of that then they begin to
[1:21:49] devour one another and fight and fast
[1:21:51] and stew that's ministerial Wars no
[1:21:55] so when Minister clinging inside and
[1:21:57] bringing the congression in the fight
[1:22:01] that's that evil
[1:22:03] so then the whole congregation now
[1:22:04] against this man here that they never
[1:22:06] met they never Fellowship where they
[1:22:08] don't know he have an issue with that
[1:22:10] Minister and he bringing sword and
[1:22:11] climbing sword and sowing seed
[1:22:14] killer murderer
[1:22:16] breaking the effect of announcement
[1:22:19] my
[1:22:20] and what that life and behavior speaks
[1:22:23] the Lord delay is coming
[1:22:24] the law taking long to come so we could
[1:22:26] fight one another the bride will say the
[1:22:28] Lord already said what a shout
[1:22:29] so we have no fight because we had to
[1:22:31] get a love to get over here
[1:22:32] if we don't get love all of us say
[1:22:34] marketing revelation
[1:22:37] after 50 years adoption
[1:22:40] meeting
[1:22:46] that makes no sense
[1:22:47] somebody at the professor don't worry it
[1:22:50] will be there all right yeah watch the
[1:22:52] beginning of our one another and bite
[1:22:54] and fuss and stew and the Lord came and
[1:22:56] caught them that way
[1:22:58] they had their lamps but no oil in them
[1:23:01] and they were cast into outer Darkness
[1:23:03] brother why take a substitute when the
[1:23:05] genuineness here at hand when you get
[1:23:07] the mainspring working within you
[1:23:10] so now they love come back in the church
[1:23:12] I like what but I'm chilling down you
[1:23:14] know you're talking about it booking
[1:23:15] within you now
[1:23:18] when you get the mainspring working
[1:23:19] within you Christ the love of God in
[1:23:22] your heart working within you then it
[1:23:24] will begin to express these kind of tick
[1:23:27] love
[1:23:28] joy peace long-suffering ticket wait
[1:23:33] ticking you're taking love
[1:23:35] Joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:23:38] gentleness patience Faith we'll see a
[1:23:42] tick right reduce
[1:23:44] oh my Hallelujah almost done
[1:23:48] all right
[1:23:49] so this materials that was brought from
[1:23:51] different lands but I'm talking about
[1:23:53] here now it fits so perfectly in the
[1:23:55] space of 40 years from musliman Temple
[1:23:58] and take him to put a construction up
[1:24:00] there one stone had to be restored there
[1:24:01] wasn't a buzz or saw not one stone had
[1:24:04] to be restored there wasn't a buzz or a
[1:24:06] saw or Sangha hammer for 40 years you
[1:24:08] talk about mystery architecture
[1:24:09] no that showed that when we are doing
[1:24:13] anything and doing it in the pattern
[1:24:16] that God has set for us now many of
[1:24:19] those stones look very odd and there was
[1:24:21] a place in the temple for every odd
[1:24:24] peculiar Stone
[1:24:25] God had a place for them
[1:24:28] our Ministries which is a beautiful type
[1:24:31] here or anti-type to it shows in our
[1:24:34] peculiarity
[1:24:35] our way of worship yet when the temple
[1:24:39] the real Temple that we will come to in
[1:24:41] a few minutes come together there will
[1:24:43] be a place for every odd acting person
[1:24:50] we may look a little funny to someone
[1:24:52] else
[1:24:53] and act Alfani but remember it's the
[1:24:56] place there for us
[1:24:58] and God is cutting out his church
[1:25:01] and every little Stone has its place to
[1:25:05] fit exactly to it
[1:25:06] now remember it was cut away from the
[1:25:09] place it will be put together at
[1:25:15] so this was not International this was
[1:25:18] God cutting in this country cutting in
[1:25:20] that country and cutting in that country
[1:25:21] and cutting that country but one day it
[1:25:23] will be assembled together
[1:25:26] do you get that
[1:25:28] it was cut away from the place it would
[1:25:31] be put together at but when it come
[1:25:33] together it didn't even need honing
[1:25:36] it was already honed
[1:25:38] God made it so it fit perfectly into its
[1:25:42] place
[1:25:44] what a type
[1:25:46] and here we find of the spiritual how
[1:25:49] that every gift of God every odd Act of
[1:25:52] born-again Christians
[1:25:54] in their peculiarity yet it got its
[1:25:58] place it fits in the body
[1:26:01] it goes to its right place now many of
[1:26:03] us we will try and say no that's not of
[1:26:05] God a good holy consecrated soul of the
[1:26:08] Cross and we say now we stood in the
[1:26:10] church the other night we heard such and
[1:26:11] such and such that can't be of God but
[1:26:13] if it is in line with the pattern if
[1:26:16] it's in line with the Scripture it may
[1:26:19] be odd but it's going to have its place
[1:26:21] it will fit right in it won't even need
[1:26:24] honing or polishing it's got to its
[1:26:26] place for the great architect Christ is
[1:26:28] dependent or odd one to the other
[1:26:31] now we notice in the building down here
[1:26:33] the next chapter in this building there
[1:26:35] was one stone that was actually too hard
[1:26:38] to fool with
[1:26:39] so the bill has rejected it and they
[1:26:41] pitch it over in the corner that stone
[1:26:43] was used actually two are to be used
[1:26:45] there's no such a place now remember it
[1:26:47] was the builders who should have known
[1:26:49] different
[1:26:50] and Jesus spoke of it come to find out
[1:26:52] they build the building so high until
[1:26:54] they missed the stone they didn't know
[1:26:56] where their Stone was they might have
[1:26:58] searched all their ships they might have
[1:26:59] run down every Ox cart they might have
[1:27:01] sent Messengers to Joppa and has another
[1:27:03] load come in did you lose one on the
[1:27:05] road there is something wrong we just
[1:27:07] can't find that stone in this place and
[1:27:09] when they couldn't find it nowhere else
[1:27:10] come to find out it was right on the
[1:27:11] ground
[1:27:13] it was the Chief Cornerstone
[1:27:15] but the bill is rejected
[1:27:17] and Jesus spoke of it and said have you
[1:27:18] not read of the stone that the bills
[1:27:20] reflected was the Chief Cornerstone the
[1:27:22] head of it all where the rest of the
[1:27:24] building rested upon and I think that
[1:27:27] the building today
[1:27:28] of the spiritual house that God
[1:27:31] worshiping I think there's been a great
[1:27:33] big failure today among the builders we
[1:27:36] have come to our denomination we have
[1:27:38] laid out with sincerity we have sent our
[1:27:40] boys to school educate them speak well
[1:27:42] before the congregation learn psychology
[1:27:43] Bible History we did everything the fine
[1:27:46] pews made high tower Steeples deliver
[1:27:48] music but we find out there is something
[1:27:51] wrong we try to build out a man-made
[1:27:53] material what education could produce
[1:27:56] what seminaries could produce but as the
[1:27:58] ability begin to materialize they
[1:28:00] realize that all was left the Odd Stone
[1:28:02] fitted to the Dutch and that is where
[1:28:04] the spiritual building is today that is
[1:28:06] why the bride building of Christ is not
[1:28:09] ready for the big room
[1:28:12] who said that
[1:28:14] Prophet said that that is why the bride
[1:28:17] building of Christ is not ready for the
[1:28:19] bridegroom it's because the builders
[1:28:22] has rejected the Chief Cornerstone that
[1:28:26] was laid on the day of Pentecost
[1:28:28] which is the baptism and of the Holy
[1:28:31] Spirit
[1:28:32] it's odd
[1:28:34] act funny Oh Glory to God give the
[1:28:39] give the Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:28:41] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:28:45] Oh Glory
[1:28:47] Lori we find out when they come down to
[1:28:50] the actual building All We Got Is Morton
[1:28:52] Rock the building did not go on they
[1:28:55] rejected the way the stone that God had
[1:28:57] prepared for it they rejected it
[1:29:00] oh my Hallelujah
[1:29:03] no we already have the stones the stones
[1:29:06] got 14 we have got them all the way from
[1:29:08] efficans to loudicia we are only waiting
[1:29:11] now for The Headstone that the builders
[1:29:13] rejected
[1:29:14] waiting for the coming the captain Stone
[1:29:18] brother Brian I'm almost done you know
[1:29:20] you know the great things he may be set
[1:29:23] here 40 years trying to get enough money
[1:29:24] to buy in some crutches
[1:29:26] but he couldn't do it
[1:29:27] but right
[1:29:29] in the most unexpected place
[1:29:33] and the unexpected time
[1:29:35] and the most unexpected insufficient
[1:29:38] people he got what he wanted
[1:29:39] I am so glad that God does it
[1:29:42] then he giving his own testimony here by
[1:29:44] the Stephen he's saying a bunch of
[1:29:46] little so-called Holy Rollers one night
[1:29:49] I found what I wanted
[1:29:53] that money could not buy
[1:29:55] in a bunch of illiterate uneducated
[1:29:57] poorly dressed people Negroes to begin
[1:30:00] with
[1:30:01] out yonder in an old converted Saloon on
[1:30:04] the floor
[1:30:05] I found the price a jewel when that old
[1:30:10] ducky looked in my face and said have
[1:30:13] you received the Holy Ghost
[1:30:14] since you believe it was something that
[1:30:17] I wanted
[1:30:18] I didn't expect to find it among those
[1:30:20] people
[1:30:21] but they had what I needed or give the
[1:30:24] Lord a shout in the house glory to God
[1:30:27] brother could thank God when that man
[1:30:31] said have they received the Holy Ghost
[1:30:33] since you believe
[1:30:35] oh my
[1:30:37] Hallelujah a Roman comes over here he
[1:30:40] scratches his head that's what America
[1:30:41] is talking about a German comes over
[1:30:43] here America goes there why you got
[1:30:46] spirits of them countries you come from
[1:30:48] and that's what makes us so different to
[1:30:50] the world
[1:30:51] you are born you are citizen of another
[1:30:54] kingdom
[1:30:55] that is what the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:57] to make you a citizen of the kingdom of
[1:31:00] God
[1:31:00] and if you are citizens of the king of
[1:31:02] God how does it make you act
[1:31:04] like God does in his kingdom what does
[1:31:07] God do in his kingdom it is Holiness it
[1:31:10] is righteousness it is purity of thought
[1:31:12] purity of mind it is power and love
[1:31:15] going to the laws here in the sick
[1:31:17] performing Miracles doing great things
[1:31:19] then to the world you look crazy them
[1:31:21] guys are off their head but you are a
[1:31:24] citizen
[1:31:25] of the Kingdom
[1:31:26] Oh Glory to God hallelujah do you
[1:31:30] believe it
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:32] one more scripture if you want to write
[1:31:34] it down John 12 24 let me quote it to
[1:31:36] you right quick Jesus said if a corner
[1:31:38] wheat falls into the ground and die
[1:31:39] it's a bite alone
[1:31:41] right it cannot bring forth Another Life
[1:31:43] One closing remark remember then for the
[1:31:46] brown it is absolutely no to you people
[1:31:49] it is absolutely essential unnecessary
[1:31:53] and compelling and compulsory that you
[1:31:57] receive the Holy Ghost now for if you
[1:31:59] don't you can't come in the resurrection
[1:32:02] Oh Glory though there's a prophet
[1:32:04] exalting us tonight it is absolutely
[1:32:06] essential and necessary and compelling
[1:32:10] and compulsory that you receive the Holy
[1:32:13] Ghost now if you don't you cannot come
[1:32:16] into the resurrection
[1:32:18] and from what is the Holy Ghost
[1:32:22] he said upon this place we wish to
[1:32:24] approach a subject which is I think
[1:32:25] outstanding subject today what is the
[1:32:27] Holy Ghost what is it no you the reason
[1:32:30] I have taken this subject in lying like
[1:32:32] this here's why
[1:32:34] you cannot come
[1:32:36] and receive the Holy Spirit unless you
[1:32:39] know what it is
[1:32:40] that's one
[1:32:42] you cannot receive it
[1:32:44] if you know what it is
[1:32:46] unless you believe
[1:32:48] it is given to you
[1:32:50] so it's unfair to the people when a
[1:32:52] minister tell them you can have it 24
[1:32:54] hours a day and be still be lost there's
[1:32:57] a quote he can say if it is baptized in
[1:33:00] their flesh
[1:33:01] in their Spirit or their soul you just
[1:33:03] use that outer context and the people
[1:33:06] believe they don't need to have it
[1:33:07] because the seed is in their soul
[1:33:09] now if they even want to challenge
[1:33:11] themselves intellectually and see what
[1:33:12] we've done in it because he wasn't his
[1:33:14] soul why did that go to your room
[1:33:15] white Peter couldn't walk up by faith he
[1:33:17] preached already he he preached he
[1:33:19] healed the Second Son why did Jesus tell
[1:33:22] them go in the upper room because he
[1:33:24] can't break the word Ezekiel say a new
[1:33:26] heart a new spirit and then my spirit
[1:33:30] the reality is Peter didn't have his
[1:33:32] Spirit just yet until he rented me up a
[1:33:35] room he said as my father sent me so
[1:33:38] send are you the father that sent him
[1:33:40] was in him and God wanted to come into
[1:33:42] Peter and for God to come into Peter
[1:33:44] he's breed up on him he said receiving
[1:33:46] the Holy Ghost it was a breath it was a
[1:33:49] presence it was a power it was an
[1:33:51] anointing that breathed upon them that
[1:33:53] they could come under expectation for a
[1:33:56] manifestation if you don't know it's for
[1:33:58] you you cannot expect it okay the Lord
[1:34:00] some Praises so that in context here he
[1:34:02] said you cannot know what it is you
[1:34:05] can't receive it until you believe it's
[1:34:07] given for you and it's for you and you
[1:34:09] cannot know whether you got it or not
[1:34:11] unless you know the results it brings so
[1:34:14] if you know what it is and who it's to
[1:34:16] and what action it brings when it comes
[1:34:18] then you will know what you got when you
[1:34:20] get it
[1:34:21] I'm closing praise God
[1:34:23] are you ready
[1:34:25] and the cap of this message tonight for
[1:34:27] my message after the Holy Spirit and
[1:34:29] there's a prophecy right here this is I
[1:34:31] believe
[1:34:32] one of these glorious days when this
[1:34:35] United Confederation of churches goes
[1:34:37] together
[1:34:37] and a new pope is brought out of the
[1:34:41] United States and put over there
[1:34:43] according to prophecy then they will
[1:34:47] form the image like unto the Beast
[1:34:50] he said when
[1:34:54] the car closes on before time they can't
[1:34:57] come out the timing
[1:34:59] the prophecy had a watch
[1:35:01] then they will form an image under the
[1:35:03] Beast and I tell you here we go there's
[1:35:05] a prophecy here now the True Church of
[1:35:07] God will be droved together
[1:35:09] the real true believers this is not the
[1:35:12] builders nowhere
[1:35:14] they believe us
[1:35:16] the realtor Believers out of Methodist
[1:35:18] Baptist Presbyterian that is them that
[1:35:20] time now we're saying all the different
[1:35:21] message groups
[1:35:24] all right whatever they will be will go
[1:35:26] together and be cemented by the love of
[1:35:30] God
[1:35:31] that will make the body of the Lord
[1:35:33] Jesus Christ all the Believers
[1:35:36] and the agnostics and shallow-minded
[1:35:39] will be cast to one side they will go
[1:35:41] into the confederation of churches
[1:35:43] so you go take pressure you know it will
[1:35:45] take something to get the crap out of
[1:35:47] this message
[1:35:49] Hallelujah it will take more than
[1:35:51] argument and debate and explanation and
[1:35:54] who have Revelation you go take more
[1:35:55] than that if we really take the love of
[1:35:57] God and brother Branham had it he
[1:35:59] demonstrated it God tested him with
[1:36:01] forgiveness brotherly kindness to be
[1:36:02] American love in church and go tell him
[1:36:04] whatever he will say visit that is dead
[1:36:06] whatever you say honey say I forgive you
[1:36:09] he was contaminated woman and he had to
[1:36:11] come to the experience and say I forgive
[1:36:12] you I was wrong to condemn you because
[1:36:15] God forgive me isn't that right I'm
[1:36:17] closing with these scriptures here first
[1:36:18] Peter 2 4 says
[1:36:22] to whom come in us until Livingstone
[1:36:23] it's not a dead stone it's a living
[1:36:25] Stone disallow the need of men but
[1:36:27] choose not quite unprecious he also has
[1:36:30] Lively Stones Lively Stones not dead
[1:36:32] stones that's how you have to be in
[1:36:34] church that's how you have to be as a
[1:36:35] Believer as an individual you also has
[1:36:37] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:36:40] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:36:42] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:36:44] by Jesus Christ but see if we could play
[1:36:46] something wherefore this containing the
[1:36:48] scripture behold I lay inside our Chief
[1:36:50] Cornerstone elect
[1:36:52] precious
[1:36:54] he doesn't believe in him shall not be
[1:36:55] confounded unto you therefore which you
[1:36:57] believe he is precious but if the damage
[1:36:59] be disobedient the stone
[1:37:02] with the villages allowed the same is
