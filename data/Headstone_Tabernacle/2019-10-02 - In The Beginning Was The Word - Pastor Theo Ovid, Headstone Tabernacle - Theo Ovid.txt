section the evening section the pad section or glory look good hallelujah I basically deceive all that they have a great and small so many were church members pretended Christians he received all whose names were not written not in the church book but in the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundation of the world the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word he said Christ the sacrifice to buy or to redeem that same whom that I wrote the names in the book of life so Jesus come to buy and retain the group no wonder you can say with them seven thunders uttered the voices does that group guys the group whose names are written of course might who could stop them Oh glory to God who could stop them they couldn't stop luta the curtains up Wesley come on who could stop them hallelujah

offering because this is what - the rock your feet whenever you've completely opposite to what the devil's expected they have expected me frustrated because this happen yesterday and their ability pressed because that happened last night and that's his expectation he weight and fit he say yes come on now you know he's encouraging you on few dong yes nobody nobody see you all alone look at you buggy like a surfer when he run off in like a glider and exact still makin pancake or making beacon some kind of thing mommies around just finishin Luis ting his coffee and slicing sigh something

there is more for us than against I know we have all that bucket [Applause] we are plenty backing you know it's the whole company of angels around here this binocular or you feel as he launches in here Lord hallelujah angels or chlorine apart baptism only goes to make you a candidate for the supernatural and for the angelic visitations okay the Lord I shall be not talkin crazy stuff this is the way or call if this is the word hallelujah but a pranam I love this part he said then then then then be therefore perfect even as your heavenly Father is perfect how can you be when it is not my perfection it is not your perfection it is his perfection of his world and he shows you in you never chose him he brought you into Christ and you are secure with Jesus Christ just as perfect as Christ was before God so it's not your perfection is might not like my profession its perfection by his word or glory of God so God became from God to become me the take my sin upon him that he might make him me him back to this great purpose of son and daughters of God for he is the eternal father the attribute was in him so he had to be split so you see the whole tree fall purpose to express himself he has to express himself in a man to become a savior so first spirit thought Elohim then logos well theophany would buddy and then this word became flesh Jesus Christ Jesus came from thought to word the flesh he said we came from taught the flesh bypass this your funny world hallelujah won't be going back to work hallelujah no before the world began in the beginning before the beginning was the word and the word spoke let her be let her be let her be but before all them let there be was the word Oh glory to God hallelujah we're going back to the beginning hallelujah in the beginning was the

the tips of the seven churches if you mentioned that Judas have been justified sanctified what is genuine is it as a good one experience of grace that he received you also many other jewelers had his name and on the book of life and yet we know he went to Hades and was lost how can a person have their name on the book of life I said be lost or why does that God put a person name on the book of life when he knows that will be lost at the end he said that's a good one isn't it I think I will leave that one but the point about it every life is recorded in the book but your own is a new blood section that cannot be erased and that is enough to make you walk only Church skipping that's enough your name canopy with [Music] Satan says I'm trying to do so Lucia Lucia here tonight I am still there they have a seal on that man you see me in a meadow but he carries it that was stealin that name God seal your name he said father I have what they work with me before the world began them
