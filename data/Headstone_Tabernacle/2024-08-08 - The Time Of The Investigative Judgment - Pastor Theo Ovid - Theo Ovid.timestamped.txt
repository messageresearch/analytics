[27:10] the thing which I do seeing that Abraham
[27:13] shall surely become a great and mighty
[27:16] nation and all the nations of the Earth
[27:18] shall be blessed in him for I know him
[27:22] and he will command his children and his

[27:28] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[27:31] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[27:33] Abraham that which he had spoken of him
[27:37] and the Lord said because the Cry of
[27:40] Sodom and gomorah is great and because
[27:44] their sin is Grievious I will go down
[27:48] now and see whether they have done all
[27:51] together according to the Cry of it
[27:54] which is come unto me and if not I they
[27:58] will know Ezekiel chapter 9 reading
[28:01] verse one he cried also in my ear with a
[28:05] loud voice saying cause them that have
[28:08] charge over the city to draw near even
[28:11] every man with a destroying weapon in
[28:14] his hand and behold six men came from
[28:18] the way of the higher gate which lie
[28:20] towards the North and every man has
[28:22] Slaughter weapon in his hand and one
[28:24] among them was clothed with linen with a
[28:26] rightous incor by side and they went in
[28:29] and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and
[28:32] the glory of the god of Israel was gone
[28:34] up from the Cherub where upon he was to
[28:37] the threshold of the house and he called
[28:40] to the man clothed with linen which had
[28:42] the writers incor by his sight and the
[28:45] Lord said unto him go through the midst
[28:47] of the city through the midst of
[28:49] Jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads
[28:52] of the men that sigh and that cry for
[28:55] all the Abominations that be done in the
[28:56] midst thereof and to the others he said
[28:59] in my hearing go ye after him through
[29:01] the city and smite let not your eyes
[29:04] spear neither have ye pity slay utterly
[29:07] old and young with Maids little children
[29:09] women but come not near any man upon
[29:12] whom is the mark and begin at My
[29:16] Sanctuary then they began at the ancient
[29:19] men which were before the house he said
[29:22] unto them defile the house and fill the
[29:24] courts with the slain go ye forth and
[29:27] they went and fought and slew in the
[29:29] city came to pass while they were
[29:31] slaying them I was left and I fell upon
[29:34] my face and cried and say ah Lord God
[29:37] will thou destroy all the residue of
[29:39] Israel in thy point out of thy Fury upon
[29:42] Jerusalem then said he unto me the
[29:44] iniquity of the House of Israel and
[29:47] Judah is exceeding great and the land is
[29:50] full of blood and the City full of
[29:52] perverseness for they say the Lord had
[29:55] forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth
[29:58] not as for me also mine eyes shall not
[30:01] spear neither will I have pity but I
[30:03] will recompense their way upon their
[30:06] head and behold the man clothed with
[30:09] linen which had the inkor by his side
[30:12] reported the matter saying I have done
[30:16] as thou Hast commanded me let's pray
[30:19] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[30:20] word Lord and I pray that your presence
[30:23] would come upon it and speak to us as we
[30:25] wait on you in Jesus name we ask it amen
[30:28] amen and amen God bless you may have a
[30:42] seat now Ezekiel to come to Ezekiel
[30:45] 9 we have Ezekiel 8 I wouldn't read all
[30:49] of it but Ezekiel was talking about as I
[30:54] sat in my house and the Elders of Judah
[30:56] sat before me the hand of the Lord fell
[30:59] upon me and then he said that the spirit
[31:04] Lifted Me Up Between Heaven and Earth
[31:06] and brought me to the visions of God to
[31:09] Jerusalem to D the inner
[31:12] gate that look at to was the north where
[31:15] there was a seat the Bible call it of
[31:18] the image of jealousy which provoketh a
[31:21] jealousy and behold the glory of God of
[31:24] Israel was dear according to the vision
[31:26] I saw it in plain so this is Ezekiel
[31:30] being transported to see something that
[31:32] God wanted to see and this is verse five
[31:34] here then said he unto me son of man
[31:37] lift up thine eyes now towards the north
[31:39] so I lifted up my eyes towards the North
[31:40] and behold northward at the Gate of the
[31:43] alter this image of jealousy in the
[31:47] entry he said furthermore son of man
[31:50] seest thou what they do even the great
[31:53] Abominations that the house of there God
[31:55] people here now that the house of Israel
[31:58] committed here and I I should go far off
[32:01] from My Sanctuary but turn the yet again
[32:04] thou shall see greater Abominations he
[32:07] brought me to the door of the Court when
[32:09] I looked Behold a hole in the wall he
[32:11] says son of me son of man dig now in the
[32:13] wall when I had dig in a wall Behold a
[32:15] door he said go in Behold The Wicked
[32:18] Abominations that they do dear I went in
[32:21] Saw behold every form of creeping things
[32:24] abominable beasts all the idols of the
[32:26] House of Israel portrayed upon on the
[32:28] wall round about and there stood 70 men
[32:31] of the Ancients that is where that the
[32:34] let's start at the ancient in the church
[32:37] 70 men of the ancient of the House of
[32:40] Israel in the midst of them stood and he
[32:43] identify a name here jazia the son of
[32:47] shapan which every man with sensor in
[32:49] his hand thck cloud of incels went up
[32:52] then he said unto me son of man hast
[32:54] thou seen what the Ancients of the House
[32:56] of Israel do in in the
[32:58] dark every man in the chamber of his
[33:01] imagery for they say the Lord seeth us
[33:05] not the Lord had forsaken the Earth he
[33:08] said unto me turn yet again and thou
[33:11] shal see greater Abominations so God
[33:13] showing him room after room after room
[33:16] then he brought me to the door of the
[33:18] Gate of the Lord's House which was
[33:21] towards the North and there sat woman
[33:24] weeping for tamuz not a god another man
[33:29] another Pastor another Minister weeping
[33:32] for tamuz and then said he unto meast
[33:34] thou seen this oh son of man turn the
[33:37] yet again and thou shalt see greater
[33:40] Abomination than these and he brought me
[33:43] into the inner Court of the Lord's House
[33:45] and behold at the door of the Temple of
[33:48] the Lord between the porch and the altar
[33:51] with 5 and 20 men with their backs
[33:53] towards the Temple of the Lord and their
[33:56] faces towards the east and they
[33:58] worshiped the son towards the east then
[34:00] he said unto me hast thou seen this oh
[34:02] son of man is it a lighting to the house
[34:05] of Judah that they commit the
[34:06] Abominations which they commit here for
[34:08] they have filled the land with violence
[34:10] and returned to provoke me to anger and
[34:13] they put the branch to their nose
[34:15] therefore will I deal in Fury my eyes
[34:18] shall not spear neither will I have pity
[34:21] and thou they and though they cry in my
[34:24] ears with a loud voice yet will I not

[35:10] of this investigating Judgment of
[35:13] God I believe we are right in the day of
[35:17] it we don't want to be radical we don't
[35:21] want to be fanatical we just want to
[35:23] approach it as SE as the Bible would
[35:26] speak it here
[35:28] praise the Lord now in doing this we
[35:31] hear so much people talk about the mark
[35:32] of the beast it is a long time what is
[35:35] it who does it who going to have it what
[35:39] is going to do to them could it harm you
[35:42] is there any harm to it we want to find
[35:44] out from the word of God if there's a
[35:47] mark of the be spoke of the Bible and
[35:49] the next thing what age will it pertain
[35:51] to who will be the people that will have
[35:54] it what would you do could you have it
[35:56] and not know it and so forth those
[35:59] questions like that and to the best of
[36:01] my knowledge this would be one of the
[36:03] most vital two subjects I could think of
[36:05] in the Bible the mark of the beast and
[36:08] the Seal of God now Revelation 149 says
[36:13] and the third Angel followed them saying
[36:15] with a loud voice if any man worshiped
[36:17] the Beast and His Image and receive his
[36:19] Mark in his forehead or in his hand the
[36:22] same shall drink of the wine of the
[36:24] wrath of God which is poured out without
[36:26] mixture into the cup of his indignation
[36:29] he shall he shall be tormented with fire
[36:31] and brimstone in the presence of the
[36:33] Holy Angels in the presence of the lamb
[36:36] and the smoke of the torment ascended
[36:37] forever and ever they shall have no rest
[36:39] day nor night who worship the Beast and
[36:41] His Image whosoever receive the Mark or
[36:44] his name here is the patience of the
[36:46] Saints here are they that keep the
[36:48] Commandments of God and the faith of
[36:50] Jesus I Heard a Voice of Heaven s unto
[36:52] me right blessed are the dead which die
[36:54] in the Lord from hence forth y say the
[36:56] spirit that they may rest from their
[36:58] labors and their Works to follow them
[37:00] and I looked and behold a white cloud
[37:02] and behold upon the cloud Sat one like
[37:04] the son of man having his head a Golden
[37:06] Crown and his hand a sharp sickle and
[37:09] another angel came from the temple
[37:11] crying with a lord voice to him that sat
[37:13] in the cloud said trust in thy sickle
[37:14] and reap for the time is come for thee
[37:18] to reap for the Harvest of the earth is
[37:20] ripe and he had sat in the cloud
[37:23] trusting his sickle on the Earth and the
[37:24] Earth was reaped so understand this
[37:29] Sunday was a reminder and a warning that
[37:33] we are actually in the end times and
[37:35] sometime we could get little
[37:37] dull
[37:38] cold ordinary flat without an awareness
[37:42] and a consciousness of how far down the
[37:45] road we are the prophet came at the end
[37:47] of Lisa age not at the beginning at the
[37:51] end so in other words there are no more
[37:53] ages left there's only one age that God
[37:56] placed there bright age which is
[37:59] something Supernatural that the devil
[38:00] know nothing about that so you have been
[38:02] called out of laia into this bright age
[38:06] isn't that right so here the prophet now
[38:08] this is the third Angel's message to the
[38:11] world Hallelujah and you know what the
[38:14] third Angel's message is going forth now
[38:17] in this day this is the flying of the
[38:20] third Angel's message if you are a Bible
[38:23] reader there are three words that follow
[38:25] it World War One second one World War II
[38:29] and we know what next World War I the
[38:32] Earth is groaning crying for the day of
[38:33] sweet release when Jesus shall come back
[38:36] to earth again sin and sorrow pain and
[38:38] death of this Dark World shall cease and
[38:40] the Glorious reign with Jesus A Thousand
[38:42] Years of Peace the Bible said they ruled
[38:45] and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years
[38:46] a millennium this third Angel's
[38:51] message just before the coming of the
[38:54] Lord when the seal and Mack was put on
[38:58] so he is saying the third Angel's
[39:01] message brings on this sealing Mark and
[39:05] there's going to be a great Roundup now

[41:26] another sign in heaven great and
[41:27] marvelous seven angels having the seven
[41:29] last plagues for in them was filled up
[41:31] the wrath of God and I saw as it were
[41:34] the sea of glass mingle with fire and
[41:37] them that had gotten the victory over
[41:38] the Beast over his image over his Mark
[41:42] over the number of his name stand on a
[41:44] sea of glass having HS of God rians 161
[41:48] and2 I heard a great voice out the
[41:50] temple saying to the seven angels go
[41:52] your ways and pour out the vials of
[41:54] wrath of God upon the Earth regard how
[41:57] much people pray fast they could have

[42:24] entire world this prophecy going to hit
[42:27] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah

[42:32] out of the temple saying to the seven
[42:33] angels go your ways and pour the vials
[42:36] of the wrath of God upon the earth and
[42:37] the first went and poured his V upon the
[42:39] Earth and there fell a noisome and
[42:41] Grievous sore upon the men which had the
[42:44] mark of the beast and upon them which

[43:07] of Jesus and for the word of God which
[43:10] had not worshiped the Beast neither his

[43:18] thousand years oh give the Lord some

[48:56] great wonders to make fire come from
[48:58] Heaven the atomic bomb hydrogen smart
[49:03] intelligent nation and so forth
[49:04] deceiving the nation by these things he
[49:07] deceived them that dwell on the Earth by
[49:09] means of those Miracles which he had
[49:11] power to do in the sight of the Beast
[49:13] saying unto them dwell on the earth that
[49:14] they should make an image to the Beast
[49:16] which had the wound by sword and that
[49:18] live and he give power to give and he
[49:21] had power to give life unto the image of
[49:23] the Beast that the image of the Beast
[49:25] should both speak and cause that as many
[49:27] as should not worship the Beast of
[49:29] should be killed remember what I said
[49:32] before that Satan have never given up of
[49:35] wanting to be

[49:39] was that is sealed in his heart he told
[49:42] Jesus Bow Down and Worship me and all

[49:51] Superman you have to have the Antichrist
[49:53] man you have have some man that he could

[50:14] thr their things to fight communism and
[50:16] it's exactly playing it the hands of
[50:17] what God Said right here and you
[50:20] Protestants Lan y sng asleep reading
[50:23] love magazine story instead of your
[50:26] Bible out gathering around somewhere to
[50:28] some kind of party instead of a prayer
[50:30] meeting somewhere fussing at one another
[50:33] with little old Petty things that don't
[50:36] matter
[50:39] much examine what you're fussing about
[50:41] you
[50:43] know what does it
[50:49] matter how much does it matter somebody
[50:52] boun on your plant and you

[51:01] book no food in the house because the
[51:03] wife cook on
[51:09] time you ought to be on your knees
[51:12] somewhere this what about to read to you
[51:14] blow my mind because seen the type the
[51:18] type is in Daniel Daniel had become a
[51:20] great man and before King Nebuchadnezzar
[51:23] and Baza and so forth when he become a
[51:25] great man what much King Nebuchadnezzar
[51:29] made an image of gold and set it up in
[51:31] the field and said everybody would have
[51:33] to B that
[51:35] image that's the
[51:37] type did you ever notice the innocence
[51:40] of it who that image was made of it was
[51:44] Daniel so he made an image of Daniel for
[51:47] Daniel and the boys to
[51:50] worship if Daniel was some of these
[51:54] message he feel good and proud know
[51:57] look at mean the king the king coming in
[51:59] the
[52:00] message look you have a picture of
[52:08] me it was Daniel the image of a man
[52:11] didn't he say the spirit of the Gods and
[52:14] as they today got three or four them the
[52:16] spirit of the god lived in him and they
[52:18] made an image to Daniel and said all
[52:21] that won bow to that image will be
[52:22] thrown in the fiery
[52:24] furnace same thing that's when the Press
[52:27] come that's when the boycott come that's
[52:29] when the pressure coming on the church
[52:30] because a image will be presented a
[52:32] system will be presented that will have
[52:33] to be rejected so right now our only job
[52:38] is to get oil get marked get sealed get
[52:43] placed get
[52:47] ready words get ready and stay ready oh
[52:50] give the Lord some
[52:52] Praises do you understand that but the
[52:54] Bible said his wife had made said ready
[52:57] it doesn't matter when he coming you
[52:58] know is as long as you get ready for
[53:00] when he comes it doesn't matter when he
[53:01] comes he could come tomorrow he could
[53:03] come next week next month next day
[53:04] doesn't matter when he comes you know
[53:05] but if he comes you're not ready you're
[53:07] messed
[53:08] up you waste time you waste time coming
[53:10] to the church 40 years wasting
[53:16] time you notice Daniel off the scene at
[53:18] that time get what I mean and ever who
[53:21] would not bow to that image would be cut
[53:22] to Pieces thrown into the lion's den
[53:25] burnt into the firment fiery furnace a
[53:28] punishment that is the way the Gentile
[53:32] dispensation begin with a pagan form of
[53:35] religious worship with a persecution to
[53:37] make them about it and the Bible
[53:39] predicts it will end that same way a
[53:42] holy man Jesus Christ an image to him to
[53:45] worship and so forth right now look I
[53:47] want you to notice something how did the
[53:49] Babylonian Kingdom
[53:51] breakup one night they were got the holy
[53:55] vessels of God begin to drink and have a
[53:57] big time bunch of woman concubines
[53:59] dancing reing and handwriting coming the
[54:01] world many many teing upass and they
[54:04] went and got their Chans their smart men
[54:06] the luk church members none of them
[54:08] could read it but there was a man there
[54:10] who could read unknown tongues could
[54:12] interpret it and it was your F ways in
[54:15] the balance and F wanting we know that
[54:17] right he said that is the way here we go
[54:20] she is going out now so in other words
[54:23] she was showing that the interpretation
[54:26] of the writing of the wall was closing
[54:28] off the Babylonian system and that holy
[54:32] ghost power that interpret the writing
[54:34] on the wall will be back in the
[54:36] church he said that's the way she's
[54:38] going out now with the power of the Holy
[54:40] Ghost on the people who is filled with
[54:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost who has
[54:44] power and signs and wonders there goes
[54:47] the Gentile Church there's the remnant
[54:48] The Remnant they walk around the books
[54:50] and tapes oh give the Lord some praises
[54:52] the remnant is walking out with the
[54:54] power of God hallelujah National Force

[54:58] churches but the power of God will put
[55:00] the people in The Bride oh praise the
[55:02] name of the Lord National Force to put
[55:04] the churches in the work of the churches
[55:06] isn't that right all right watch that's
[55:08] how it come in that's how it goes out a
[55:10] bowing a forcing to a half hiden
[55:13] religion and God is stepping in The
[55:17] crucial hour and writing an unknown
[55:19] tongues and the man interpreted he could
[55:22] interpret he didn't know that language
[55:24] nobody has know it but he had the holy
[55:25] ghost that let
[55:27] interpret and that same Holy Ghost is in
[55:29] the church today you're going to find in
[55:31] a few minutes what the mark of the devil
[55:33] is and what the Seal of the devil is the
[55:34] mark of the beast whosoever speak
[55:36] against the Holy Ghost will never be
[55:39] forgiven him in this world or the world
[55:41] to come so you see God God have been
[55:45] letting things hang oh praise God
[55:47] because the Holy Ghost is coming to
[55:49] manifest itself all the warnings is
[55:51] there in the word so first God unveiled
[55:54] the word to call us out you couldn't
[55:58] stay in your Baptist Church your
[55:59] Catholic Church the word unveiled to you
[56:01] you a reached nowhere yet you know the
[56:03] unveiling of the word was to get you out
[56:05] when you come out then he has more to
[56:07] unveil to get you in just as Redemption
[56:11] is in two parts coming out of and going
[56:13] into so people come into the message but
[56:16] they haven't got into what they're
[56:17] supposed to get into Oh Glory to God
[56:21] hallelujah praise God as I was standing
[56:23] some Bren divine revelation mixure you
[56:26] humble because it is God revealing
[56:29] himself to you it is not your study it's
[56:32] not your learning it's the grace of God
[56:34] so then if you want more you keep humble
[56:36] and God gave more Revelation Revelation
[56:38] is God's sovereignity go Revelation is
[56:40] God's thoughts coming to you so even
[56:43] though I'm speaking the word that I know
[56:45] I'm not revealing the word to you the
[56:46] word could come out but the Holy Spirit
[56:49] have to reveal it to you and when it
[56:51] drop into your system that's a
[56:52] revelation that's the rock Jesus talk
[56:55] about Upon This Rock I'll build my
[56:56] church Oh Glory to God so we can speak a
[56:59] thousand words and one word becomes a
[57:01] rock Revelation that's that that what
[57:03] the church built on the built the church
[57:05] not built upon all the other 99 in your
[57:07] head it builts upon the rock inside your
[57:09] heart that is what the devil can't touch
[57:12] that is what the devil cannot overthrow
[57:14] that is what the devil can't defeat what
[57:16] is inside of you so you already put the
[57:19] gene which is the potential inside of
[57:21] you and you are the thought Gene coming
[57:23] to connect with your word oh give the
[57:25] Lord a shout you understand there's a
[57:28] connection with what's inside of you to
[57:30] what's coming to you the gene thought is
[57:33] inside of you and the word coming hit in
[57:35] that Jean thought Oh Glory to God
[57:37] because you your thought going to be
[57:39] expressed by the word that's why your
[57:41] name is in the book that's why when we
[57:42] preaching you could hear your name you
[57:44] could catch a revelation of the word and
[57:46] you hear your own name and that cause
[57:47] you to react a certain way oh give the
[57:49] Lord I shout you get freed up oh God
[57:52] grace coming to you praise God to unfold
[57:54] your name to you hallelujah hallelujah
[57:58] watch the first church what they done
[58:00] watch out about the second Church you
[58:02] should seal yourself what you could seal
[58:07] yourself out of the kingdom of God and
[58:10] into the
[58:12] devil where there is no forgiveness in
[58:14] this world nor the world to come be
[58:17] careful he says so be TR he say so be
[58:20] careful walk reverently be careful what
[58:23] you do for you do not know what will
[58:27] take
[58:28] place you are only saved when you are
[58:31] truly baptized with God's spirit by the
[58:34] Holy Ghost United with him in the power
[58:37] of Resurrection going forth with signs
[58:39] and wonders following that Spirit
[58:42] wherever it goes he said this bride will
[58:44] write another book of Acts if that
[58:47] original tree puts forth another
[58:50] original Branch because All Through the
[58:52] Ages was branches that was grafted in so
[58:54] that's why you get no true pretention of
[58:56] Christ Baptist grafting Methodist
[58:58] everybody grafted in Pentecostal
[59:00] grafting but that tree is pushing up
[59:03] amen and when that tree put forth an
[59:04] original Branch it must have the
[59:06] original Fruit it must have a people
[59:08] with signs one of the Miracles it must
[59:10] have another day of Pentecost it must
[59:12] another Acts 2 acts 5 praise God got to
[59:15] write another book of Acts before the
[59:17] coming of the lord we can't leave here
[59:20] dry we can't leave here dead we can't
[59:23] leave our people not delivered we can't
[59:25] leave here in blind St blind death death
[59:28] it can't be
[59:31] that that's why he said there will be a
[59:33] church Glory with Jesus walking in it
[59:37] the shout of the king will be in the
[59:38] camp Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise
[59:42] God a church that he could be proud of
[59:44] Amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah blessed
[59:48] be the name of the Lord
[59:50] hallelujah so therefore in Genesis God
[59:53] came down to Abraham praise God he he
[59:56] was he come like God come down now and
[59:58] investigating you want and you know I
[1:00:00] remember I was hungering for God 19 was
[1:00:03] 19 um
[1:00:06] 74 hunging for God ending there December
[1:00:09] hungry for God hungry for God I want to
[1:00:11] know and I remember praying Lord I don't
[1:00:12] know who you are could you reveal
[1:00:14] yourself to me this year at 1975 is when
[1:00:16] I get baptized so there was a cry inside
[1:00:19] of me calling for something that's when
[1:00:21] I get to meet the message I was calling
[1:00:23] for a reality and God check that out and
[1:00:25] say yes this brother serious so when I
[1:00:27] got my mother told me I cannot go to
[1:00:29] that that church that was obliquely
[1:00:30] opposite me you know where house where
[1:00:32] my house is you she said no no no he
[1:00:34] Catholic can't I hear noise and people
[1:00:36] shouting and in message and I say I have
[1:00:38] to get back to this and God arranged it
[1:00:41] that I apply and I get to permission to
[1:00:43] go pter Spain to go John joh Johnson
[1:00:45] Technical Institute to do electrical
[1:00:47] engineering technician and and that
[1:00:50] pulled me away from South that pulled me
[1:00:52] into the north away from parents
[1:00:53] everybody and that is how I end up with
[1:00:55] the gospel so God know what he's
[1:00:57] doing when he separate you to get you
[1:01:00] aside to deal with you God have to do
[1:01:02] that sometime you know separat you
[1:01:04] because you're tied up you Tangled Up
[1:01:06] nothing in Jesus you're Tangled Up In
[1:01:07] organizing and God have to cut this off
[1:01:09] and cut that off to get you a sight to
[1:01:12] deal with you glory to God hallelujah
[1:01:15] praise God so God want to know if you
[1:01:17] want him do you want me who is me the
[1:01:20] word oh give the Lord I shout could you
[1:01:22] imagine investigating judgment in this
[1:01:24] message pastors the own Revelation the
[1:01:27] own inspiration by the kangi and God is
[1:01:29] still asking do you want me the word
[1:01:31] you're reading the spok word books
[1:01:33] you're not seeing what in the spoke word
[1:01:34] books in the church and you're still
[1:01:36] accepting
[1:01:39] that if you believe a lie accept a lie
[1:01:42] you are you are part of that whole thing
[1:01:44] you know you can't see a lie and keep
[1:01:46] staying with it you
[1:01:49] know you are supporting something that
[1:01:51] is false that is wrong he said be
[1:01:54] separated amen and come out from among
[1:01:56] them my people you can't see things off
[1:01:59] the word and stay you have to run for
[1:02:01] your life oh give the Lord a shout God
[1:02:04] can't bless lot and his family and Sodom
[1:02:07] he had to get them out because judgment
[1:02:09] is about set to get Sodom out get get
[1:02:11] toward
[1:02:16] s we we don't know if God leave a space
[1:02:20] of half an hour to see all people W the
[1:02:23] word giving God grace all the 70s the
[1:02:26] 880s just the word because he have his
[1:02:29] time we can accelerate God's
[1:02:32] clock because over the years so much of
[1:02:35] people get exposed and hypocrites and
[1:02:37] all kind of characters and God just take
[1:02:39] them off the scene so because God come
[1:02:40] and filtering notice the pyramid white
[1:02:42] at the bottom you know look at
[1:02:45] it it broad you know plenty people at
[1:02:48] the bottom there you know but as it go
[1:02:50] up it
[1:02:51] narrows it Narrows that's what happened
[1:02:54] right now it have to be home owned
[1:02:57] shaped to be fitted into God's program
[1:03:01] you have to be willing go in forceing
[1:03:03] you you want to stay as you are God will
[1:03:05] leave you as you are if you want to be
[1:03:07] shaped will dou be made perfect
[1:03:09] Hallelujah you have to want that you
[1:03:11] have to hunger for that be therefore for
[1:03:13] perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[1:03:18] perfect so therefore the investigating
[1:03:20] judgment is to investigate to see what
[1:03:23] you want
[1:03:26] and sometime God give people what their
[1:03:27] heart is a brother say all the time in
[1:03:30] his heart he want to hear about the
[1:03:31] Trump so when his brother start about
[1:03:32] the Trump he leave the church because he
[1:03:34] he want to follow
[1:03:35] Trump next brother ahead voice shout
[1:03:38] voice Trump he ahead I said brother I
[1:03:40] trying to catch up trying to catch up as
[1:03:41] fast as I
[1:03:43] can they
[1:03:46] ahead God has give people to what they
[1:03:49] heart to the people watch outside and
[1:03:51] they say everybody have a kingu in front
[1:03:53] of them who come
[1:03:56] they have pillar Fire by Night
[1:04:00] cloud cloud by day and they want a
[1:04:04] man God with them but they want a
[1:04:07] man and and
[1:04:10] Samuel God what money from
[1:04:13] you God say Samuel they reject
[1:04:17] you it's me they want a man give them a
[1:04:22] man and that's what all day give them
[1:04:25] somebody just like
[1:04:26] them Soul a compromising man a man are
[1:04:30] will start off okay and then things will
[1:04:33] go off key
[1:04:35] because my God Isaac Shar a quote I tell
[1:04:39] he must for a quote to me but brandham
[1:04:41] shared something was so powerful and
[1:04:43] Isaac Shar the C on ministers that
[1:04:47] Satan
[1:04:50] have I do not have the exact wording of
[1:04:52] it but it comes like this the effect of
[1:04:54] it is like this Satan have level of
[1:04:56] access to the councils of
[1:04:59] God so he knew that God wanted a
[1:05:04] king he knew that a king was coming so
[1:05:08] Satan set it up for they to desire to
[1:05:11] get one in advance of the one that was
[1:05:13] supposed to be which was
[1:05:17] David so when you look at it
[1:05:20] closer he was second in command in
[1:05:24] heaven he wasn't called Satan he was Luc
[1:05:29] Lucifer so he had a lot of PR a lot of
[1:05:33] sealed
[1:05:37] stuff and and and and mystery
[1:05:40] information so when he drop down on the
[1:05:42] earth he have
[1:05:45] things I tell brother George know when
[1:05:47] them them guys who off the word hit the
[1:05:49] mother Lord of of interpretation and
[1:05:51] Revelation Satan have lots of stuff to
[1:05:53] give them you know when you think they
[1:05:55] give up on this is a more coming you
[1:05:57] know from the pit and bubbling up
[1:06:00] bubbling up is it coming from up you
[1:06:01] know com from
[1:06:03] up that way they could come with I am
[1:06:05] the holy
[1:06:06] ghost that way come with all kind of
[1:06:08] cuckoo Revelation just pop on the pit of
[1:06:10] Hell just bubbling up bubbling up they
[1:06:13] have to do that you know because Satan
[1:06:14] have Insight a Lon Spirit come and say
[1:06:18] permission please let me drop on them
[1:06:20] 400 prophets one Spirit hitting 400 of
[1:06:24] them to cause them to to to break the
[1:06:27] word a line spirit I like how sometime
[1:06:30] you say all have stand
[1:06:32] up out one
[1:06:36] time you said they cast them in
[1:06:39] groups all who have had trouble
[1:06:42] stand yeah because you sometime you see
[1:06:44] Devils on this side calling for help and
[1:06:46] support from the other
[1:06:47] side and if they get support they going
[1:06:50] you know so he said all you have this
[1:06:52] stand up and then
[1:06:53] bam send them all them one time but we
[1:06:56] want to come back to that call them
[1:06:59] spirit and slam them out no
[1:07:01] negotiation what a church what a church

[1:20:50] through the air Faith come by hearing
[1:20:53] hearing the word of God and and God will
[1:20:55] put a blind over your ears that you will
[1:20:58] never be able to understand no more you
[1:21:00] will do no more than criticize the
[1:21:02] gospel as long as you live and die be
[1:21:04] lost forever while it is Jubilee time
[1:21:07] while the doors are open did you realize
[1:21:09] that this same is B of spirit Oh Praise
[1:21:14] godo I'm trying to hit this home stretch
[1:21:18] here in the last days there going to be
[1:21:20] two kind of people one of them going to
[1:21:22] have the seal one mark of the beast then
[1:21:25] he said the Seal of God is the Holy
[1:21:27] Ghost then without the Holy Ghost is the
[1:21:29] mark of the beast and the Bible said the
[1:21:31] two spirits will be so close together it
[1:21:33] will deceive the very
[1:21:35] elected if it were possible so no matter
[1:21:38] who you are woman man boy girl whoever
[1:21:41] you are Christian not Christian if you
[1:21:43] just believe with your whole heart and
[1:21:45] do this much tonight just to let God
[1:21:47] know that you are sincere look you say
[1:21:50] I'm a Pentecostal you say I'm this
[1:21:51] whatever you are I profess the dance in
[1:21:52] the spirit but brother Bram I as long as
[1:21:55] we had that we had it you haven't if you
[1:21:57] believe me to be God's Prophet you
[1:21:59] listen to my words that's a deception in
[1:22:02] this day didn't the Bible said it'll be
[1:22:04] so close we see the very elected
[1:22:06] possible the elected down to the soul
[1:22:08] but if you dance in the spirit still
[1:22:10] with the things of the world there's
[1:22:11] something wrong if you speak with
[1:22:13] tongues I can speak with tongues I'm an
[1:22:14] angel and still not be saved I can do
[1:22:16] all the emotions I can have faith I can
[1:22:18] preach the gospel I can give all my G
[1:22:20] ofy the poor I can carry the word in
[1:22:22] missions Fields I am nothing listen to
[1:22:26] this inside of the
[1:22:28] inside your spirit breaks up when you
[1:22:32] die and we always talk about that so
[1:22:35] you're doctor lawyer businessman
[1:22:38] whatever it is you have a fancy car
[1:22:40] fancy house I used in pool and whatnot
[1:22:42] right when somebody dies all
[1:22:45] that
[1:22:47] qualifications and titles and reputation
[1:22:50] that breaks up you know so your spirit
[1:22:53] begin to break
[1:22:55] up and your soul come up after that
[1:22:58] which is the real
[1:23:00] you so if that soul is sinful that were
[1:23:03] hitting God you
[1:23:05] know that's why I'm to the person in the
[1:23:07] hospital you know she didn't want to
[1:23:09] reject the pastor trying to tell she
[1:23:10] about repentance I'm saved and saved and
[1:23:12] when her spirit had to break up and her
[1:23:14] soul start to come for she said I'm
[1:23:17] lost because the soul coming up now the
[1:23:20] human Spirit had to break up the soul
[1:23:21] coming forward I'm lost I'm lost then
[1:23:23] they give injection
[1:23:25] her she
[1:23:31] lost your spirit breaks up and you die
[1:23:35] it takes its flight but your soul lives
[1:23:39] look at yourself really are you a
[1:23:41] genuine Bible Christian full of the love
[1:23:44] of God remember the Bible said in the
[1:23:47] last days when this time take place a
[1:23:49] marking Angel went through the
[1:23:53] churches I want wonder if the mark
[1:23:55] angels went to Trinidad what that Mar
[1:23:57] angel will see I'm not trying to neg any
[1:24:00] church you know I talk about including
[1:24:01] this church every church is no Markel I
[1:24:05] with my brother to you but you need him
[1:24:07] to come here how you get
[1:24:10] Mark but the commission is to Mark
[1:24:14] those not mark
[1:24:16] them Mark those that sigh and
[1:24:20] cry is a hard condition
[1:24:27] a mark and Angel went to the churches
[1:24:29] went to the cities seal only those who s
[1:24:31] and cried for the Abomination that was
[1:24:33] done C is that right Ezekiel 9 we know
[1:24:35] that's truth the marking Angel went
[1:24:38] forward and put a mark on the head for
[1:24:40] it seal them then s cry after that come
[1:24:43] the slaughtering angels of the four
[1:24:45] corners of the Earth so I am seeing that
[1:24:48] God has
[1:24:49] allocated if I could see this with his
[1:24:51] permission and guidance a season
[1:24:56] that people will sigh and
[1:24:57] cry you must see that before the
[1:25:01] Judgment Angels begin to
[1:25:04] ride the slaughtering angels on their
[1:25:06] way in out of that Bunch had a man with
[1:25:10] incor writer that God commission put a
[1:25:13] mark because the question that Abram was
[1:25:15] asking God will you destroy the
[1:25:17] righteous or the
[1:25:18] wicked that was the that was the issue
[1:25:21] with Abraham you know because he know
[1:25:23] judgment coming to son
[1:25:25] he know investigation is going on he
[1:25:27] know that God Wrath and fury is towards
[1:25:29] that kind of filthy light living shall
[1:25:33] you destroy the righteous with the
[1:25:35] wicked and when he plead God dispat
[1:25:38] angel to get Lo
[1:25:40] out and inside of it there's an
[1:25:42] expression by itself Lot's wife lot's
[1:25:44] environment and lot's history of
[1:25:46] pitching his towards Sodom he may have
[1:25:49] be able to handle it not his
[1:25:51] family so sometime we make decisions and
[1:25:54] it cost the family because you might be
[1:25:57] able to handle it but we're not sure
[1:25:59] about the
[1:26:02] family so some decisions we make have
[1:26:04] secondary
[1:26:05] consequences be careful make wise
[1:26:09] decisions make guided decisions because
[1:26:13] your family could be at
[1:26:19] risk after that come the S angels on for
[1:26:22] of the earth which come right away we
[1:26:24] see come in Wars move right in that will
[1:26:26] kill the old o there was nothing they
[1:26:27] couldn't touch them that had that Mark
[1:26:29] is your heart so concerned about the
[1:26:31] Sinners and the way that the church and
[1:26:33] the people are doing till you can sigh
[1:26:35] and cry about it day or night if not I'm
[1:26:40] wondering did you notice something
[1:26:42] church member and you who claim to have
[1:26:44] the Holy Spirit he said don't seal
[1:26:45] listen he phrase it different now don't
[1:26:49] seal any of them but them that sigh and
[1:26:52] cry for the Abomination
[1:26:55] why is anybody so burdened about the
[1:26:57] world now and his conditions and this
[1:27:00] year exposes the selfishness of
[1:27:03] so-called message
[1:27:05] Believers the selfishness that they
[1:27:07] would even testify they would even
[1:27:09] witness they wouldn't give not spoken
[1:27:10] with book they would even tell anybody
[1:27:12] is like they and God Alone they they in
[1:27:14] a
[1:27:15] channel how did the gospel come to
[1:27:19] you is because somebody witnessed to you
[1:27:22] somebody witnessed to me that give me an
[1:27:24] opportunity who do you witness to who do
[1:27:26] you share the word with who do you get
[1:27:28] testimony to the easiest thing you could
[1:27:30] do is tell them get
[1:27:31] connected look the website go and listen
[1:27:35] for
[1:27:37] yourself that the least you could do
[1:27:40] some people can't even do
[1:27:42] that brother
[1:27:45] Bram I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist so
[1:27:47] what difference does it make not that
[1:27:49] constant burden for the loss that
[1:27:51] sweetness don't never let anything rise
[1:27:53] up and put bitterness in your soul no
[1:27:56] matter how bad anyone ever treats you or
[1:27:58] anything don't never don't be guilty of
[1:28:01] letting that thing anchor in your soul
[1:28:03] it will grieve the holy spirit away from
[1:28:06] you it certainly will praise the name of
[1:28:09] the Lord he says watch he says the
[1:28:11] conference we need tonight in America

[1:29:10] things out there that's going on in the
[1:29:11] world do you know the SE angel said put
[1:29:13] a mark upon those who sigh cry for the
[1:29:16] Abomination while the investigation
[1:29:18] judgment is going on to see who is
[1:29:21] worthy to escape the rat the angel was
[1:29:24] to seal only those who cried and sighed
[1:29:27] for the
[1:29:29] Abomination my God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:34] praise God almost
[1:29:38] done if Einstein only had the spiritual
[1:29:41] application that he had the physical
[1:29:43] application he studied laws of light and
[1:29:45] so forth he could have told us something
[1:29:48] when I heard his message on the great
[1:29:49] Center somewhere into the skies ever
[1:29:51] contacted with that Center you could
[1:29:52] create Earth and do anything he said
[1:29:54] he's seen that you see the little
[1:29:56] pockets going to the air called sorer so
[1:29:58] forth he he said I better leave that
[1:30:01] alone hear them people go missing you
[1:30:02] don't hear from them they're standing
[1:30:04] there and they're not there that's the
[1:30:05] way the Rapture is going to be one of
[1:30:08] them will drop right down and this
[1:30:10] terrestrial body will take on a
[1:30:12] Celestial body and the hair and Bones
[1:30:16] left will be transformed in a moment of
[1:30:18] time dropping right out of space taking
[1:30:21] home that and the Pentagon wondering
[1:30:23] about these lights and Mystic likes and
[1:30:25] everything else he said they don't worry
[1:30:27] children they going to pick you up on of
[1:30:29] these days don't worry what happened
[1:30:32] just before Sodom God came down with
[1:30:34] some angels and they had an
[1:30:36] investigating judgment he said I've
[1:30:37] heard a cry so sinful so great I've come
[1:30:40] down to find out where is all together
[1:30:42] truth you say why the church it can get
[1:30:45] to a spot I I'll skip that praise the
[1:30:47] name of the Lord all
[1:30:50] right all that was not sealed took the
[1:30:54] mark of the
[1:30:54] beast all that had not the spirit of God
[1:30:57] had the mark of the beast the Seal of
[1:31:00] God is the Holy Spirit the Bible says so
[1:31:02] every place in the scripture speaks of
[1:31:04] it is the mark of God it's the Seal of
[1:31:07] God begin to play
[1:31:08] something what
[1:31:11] BR the first thing you
[1:31:13] know the time will come when God will
[1:31:17] give a message and you'll be sealed in
[1:31:21] or out of the Kingdom
[1:31:25] my Lord
[1:31:29] jesusall he
[1:31:31] prophesied about this stone that Daniel
[1:31:34] saw the cap Stone they never put a
[1:31:37] Capstone on that pyramid it wasn't cut
[1:31:40] by man's hand it's God's hand that cut
[1:31:43] the stone you see it what did it do it
[1:31:46] hit the image right smacking his feet
[1:31:48] broke it to Pieces ground it to powder
[1:31:50] what happened at that time the coming of
[1:31:52] that stone up when the church the glory
[1:31:54] of the Rapture because it ended the
[1:31:56] Gentile dispensation God ended it up
[1:32:00] with the coming of that stone that
[1:32:02] Capstone ends the Gentile dispensation
[1:32:06] the prophet asks a question is this the
