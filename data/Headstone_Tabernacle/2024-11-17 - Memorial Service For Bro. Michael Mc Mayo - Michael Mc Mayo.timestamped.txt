[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:40] amen amen now we want to pause we have a
[1:12:45] special speech from the family by Gary
[1:12:48] mcmo so we want to invite him up to the
[1:12:50] stand to give us that speech
[1:13:02] when I came in and
[1:13:04] I there and I looked at the program I
[1:13:08] recall the program said a
[1:13:11] memorial for Michael right and I guess
[1:13:15] probably I made the one I only one here
[1:13:20] would have that experience to know him
[1:13:22] from way backward so
[1:13:25] you so you would have a long time
[1:13:28] here
[1:13:30] but and you see back then is black here
[1:13:36] he died when it was gray so check it out
[1:13:40] but
[1:13:40] anyhow
[1:13:43] um what I looked at you know in
[1:13:57] yeah what I looked at
[1:14:00] um in thinking of what I should see how
[1:14:04] to express it to you I thought
[1:14:08] of a burial the burial has
[1:14:11] gone it's gone one year already but what
[1:14:15] you're looking at you want to honor him
[1:14:17] in what he did what is life represented
[1:14:20] to you and to me I looked at it how he
[1:14:25] lived his life now in everyone's
[1:14:28] life there'd be good things there are
[1:14:31] things that we like to shout about the
[1:14:34] things we would not want to
[1:14:37] discuss right but and I look back and
[1:14:42] see you know you look things that you
[1:14:44] would not want to discuss and that is
[1:14:46] not new you will look back at in Psalm
[1:14:52] 25 you're going to see David say Lord
[1:14:56] don't remember the sin of my youth and I
[1:14:59] think we'd all know why don't remember
[1:15:02] it but it's what we did once we came to
[1:15:05] that point of knowing
[1:15:08] Christ our walk would have changed so I
[1:15:11] can look at it with Michael for you
[1:15:16] brother Mark however you call him once
[1:15:19] he came to that point of knowing Christ
[1:15:23] his life was changed forever
[1:15:27] and this is what I would focus on more
[1:15:30] so how it
[1:15:32] impacted you and I and many others as he
[1:15:38] went
[1:15:40] along there times had look back one
[1:15:44] thing you know as we look then as I look
[1:15:48] then we had lots of lots of discussions
[1:15:51] particularly in the early years when
[1:15:54] heed
[1:15:55] on his journey
[1:15:57] there
[1:15:59] and in those discussions many times
[1:16:02] you'd see to me Gary you have one foot
[1:16:05] in and one foot out and I would say
[1:16:08] that's okay my fet would both will be
[1:16:11] standing the same place at some time
[1:16:14] right and um years
[1:16:18] later you know I got him not the message
[1:16:22] that he's in but coming to know CH
[1:16:26] also and I had a discussion with him
[1:16:29] once and this is what I share with you
[1:16:32] here now you know just in that
[1:16:34] discussion then and we talking whatever
[1:16:37] it was and I gave an
[1:16:41] impression my thoughts on him and he
[1:16:44] said to me Gary you're you're on track
[1:16:48] but you know what you want to understand
[1:16:52] the Bible you want to understand God's
[1:16:54] love for you start again start from
[1:16:58] Genesis
[1:17:00] 1 and read continually read from 1: one
[1:17:04] to
[1:17:06] Revelation and you know over the years I
[1:17:10] begun doing it right and every time you
[1:17:14] read through it is more and more and
[1:17:19] more you can see what is what it's all
[1:17:23] about you can see
[1:17:25] how much God loves each one of us and
[1:17:29] this is what Michael was demonstrating
[1:17:32] in his life always that it's not so much
[1:17:36] about him it's about God in your life
[1:17:40] how much God loved each one of us all
[1:17:45] right and as time went on yes he had
[1:17:50] challenges sometimes you
[1:17:53] disagreed yes but when we disagreed we
[1:17:57] can sit we can talk and discuss we spent
[1:18:01] many many
[1:18:06] hours many many hours discussing issues
[1:18:11] challenges that he
[1:18:13] had and during those times me we went
[1:18:16] back long I'm in Toronto Canada he's in
[1:18:19] New York and probably we talk as often
[1:18:24] as possible but some of the longest
[1:18:26] conversations we have is when he bought
[1:18:29] he got his first
[1:18:32] computer and that was a big challenge
[1:18:35] for
[1:18:35] you and my wife had always I just can't
[1:18:40] understand how you could do
[1:18:43] this he be lying in your bed Michael
[1:18:47] called and he said
[1:18:50] Gary A B C D E and you can down and no
[1:18:56] do a do B look here you're going to see
[1:18:59] this do that do that and just work and
[1:19:02] you don't have a screen in front of
[1:19:04] you right and this was this was the sort
[1:19:07] of relationship that we had as we
[1:19:10] came but with that being so
[1:19:16] um I think big challenges where you saw
[1:19:20] his grace more and more is
[1:19:23] when he was at
[1:19:25] hospital he spent spent quite a while at
[1:19:30] hospital right and we travel often as
[1:19:33] often as you possibly can to be with
[1:19:38] rosan and the others there while she was
[1:19:42] at
[1:19:43] hospital and there were times when
[1:19:47] questions were
[1:19:49] asked why is he
[1:19:52] suffering what
[1:19:55] or whatever his mind was wavering not
[1:20:00] when I say wavering not in his faith but
[1:20:03] wavering in thought was sort of losing
[1:20:06] his memory the early Inception of um
[1:20:10] dementia
[1:20:13] and as that went on and questions are
[1:20:17] being asked I say what he's suffering I
[1:20:21] don't know I don't know what he's in
[1:20:23] pain I don't know I can't say he's in
[1:20:27] pain but what I can see is that God is
[1:20:30] with him where he is and God is bringing
[1:20:34] him through he may not be in pain but
[1:20:37] his life here on while he's on the bed
[1:20:41] here's what he's doing there to all
[1:20:44] those who attend to him nurses doctors
[1:20:47] or whoever he can be ministering to them
[1:20:50] even at that stage right and that is
[1:20:53] something I mean really I looked
[1:20:58] at doctors or the nurses some of them
[1:21:02] knew him and you know you joke with them
[1:21:05] and so but they
[1:21:08] understood yes there's something
[1:21:10] different about him when he could sing
[1:21:13] out at times just blast out a song
[1:21:18] praising
[1:21:21] God what I
[1:21:29] so so that is um that's you know the
[1:21:34] memory that he left behind with a lot of
[1:21:37] people out there and his walk wherever
[1:21:41] he went I recall in the early years just
[1:21:45] to jump back a bit the song was played
[1:21:49] by arita
[1:21:51] Franklin s arita Franklin song and that
[1:21:56] song is
[1:22:01] um give their life to
[1:22:04] Jesus and that I recall was the
[1:22:09] first I think that is 1974 75 Michael
[1:22:14] gave me a copy of that song give your
[1:22:18] life to Jesus and to me you know even
[1:22:22] though I walked outside I walked
[1:22:25] but the point is coming yes that
[1:22:28] happened give your life to Jesus and I
[1:22:31] think that for him to is when he gave
[1:22:35] his life to Jesus and he shared that
[1:22:38] with me all right so it's a song every
[1:22:42] time I hear it yes that's what he shared
[1:22:45] that's what he gave for us to follow
[1:22:49] where he'd be now I don't know but what
[1:22:53] I do know the scripture that was read
[1:22:56] early on when he started up in John
[1:22:59] 14 right you look down he stopped at
[1:23:03] three but if you go down further it's
[1:23:06] see they talked about
[1:23:11] um I go to prepare a pleas for you if it
[1:23:16] was not so I not tell you and you would
[1:23:19] know you can read the balance of that
[1:23:21] verse so I believe in all my
[1:23:25] that he has gone to the place God went
[1:23:29] to prepare for him his life is his life
[1:23:34] has left indelible marks on quite a
[1:23:37] number of people
[1:23:39] and you being here present it has left a
[1:23:42] mark on you it has left a mark on us as
[1:23:46] family members that's what I share with
[1:23:53] you amen amen that was
[1:23:57] wonderful now we have our precious

[1:33:17] advisor family counselor so much more my
[1:33:21] understanding of the entire message of

[1:33:25] dedicated and consecrated life that
[1:33:27] brother Michael lived before me how much
[1:33:29] we need more live voices like his to
[1:33:32] inspire the younger generation I feel
[1:33:34] truly blessed to have had someone like
[1:33:36] brother Michael in my life as a young
[1:33:38] man just starting my Christian Journey
[1:33:40] for many years especially when I first
[1:33:42] came to the Lord his family became like
[1:33:45] my adopted family I spent countless
[1:33:47] hours and weekends at their home and the
[1:33:49] love I experienced there was unparallel
[1:33:52] I will never forget how special mother
[1:33:54] mcmo made me feel she always reserved a
[1:33:56] little room for me creating a sanctuary
[1:33:58] where I could escape and find peace I
[1:34:01] loved her delicious food and the special
[1:34:03] cup of tea she just prepared just for me

[1:34:59] Blackman I first met brother Michael MCM
[1:35:02] affectionately called brother ma in 1982
[1:35:05] when as a newly baptized member of pisp
[1:35:07] church I went to cyw along with the
[1:35:08] brothers to assist in painting of The
[1:35:11] Tabernacle and there is where he
[1:35:13] encountered uh he talk about account of
[1:35:16] his FY for the Lord even as a Catholic
[1:35:19] 1984 as part of the trainer contingent
[1:35:22] traveled to USA to attend the rapturing
[1:35:24] fate convention hosted by brother Dave m
[1:35:26] in Tulsa Oklahoma I was privileged to
[1:35:28] experience another facet of brother Max
[1:35:31] spiritual personality Our Guest the
[1:35:33] Tulsa required us to fly from Brooklyn
[1:35:35] to Texas and then drive overnight from
[1:35:37] Texas in a minibus with brother ma as a
[1:35:39] driver and Navigator in Texas we spent
[1:35:42] several hours resting and refreshing
[1:35:43] ourselves at the home of one of brother
[1:35:45] Ma's relatives but Ma had put together
[1:35:48] every aspect of this trip on behalf of
[1:35:50] the local contingent while we were yet
[1:35:52] in Trinidad apart from travel
[1:35:55] Arrangement this also included
[1:35:56] coordinating with the US team
[1:35:57] responsible for convention in Trinidad I
[1:36:01] had the Good Fortune to share a
[1:36:02] quadruple room with brother Mack and two
[1:36:04] other brothers descend the trend with
[1:36:06] brother Mack and me for the US
[1:36:08] convention following years and in one
[1:36:10] instance and pin Harris we room together
[1:36:13] through these various interactions but
[1:36:16] Ma and I grew deep bond and over the
[1:36:18] years no trip to the US by Me was
[1:36:20] complete without a visit to heon health
[1:36:22] store where I pick up my gallon of pure
[1:36:24] apple juice and consult with bar Mack on
[1:36:26] the latest Health Products that were
[1:36:28] available for purchase in all of this
[1:36:30] what shun through was b m complete and
[1:36:33] utter dedication to the ministering to
[1:36:35] the needs of the Saints both natural and
[1:36:37] spiritual a prime example was brother
[1:36:40] Ma's insistence on driving on relief for
[1:36:42] hours and in to and from conventions as
[1:36:46] well as carrying us visitors a shop and
[1:36:48] and and ssea on the spiritual time of of
[1:36:51] things I clearly remember one instant
[1:36:53] old night service in manah Hamry
[1:36:54] princess town when the pulpit was open
[1:36:56] for attending ministers to speak Inc
[1:36:59] coming to speak after a newly converted
[1:37:00] brother who was also started ministering
[1:37:03] with exuberance and very along
[1:37:05] legalistic lines but a mar in the spirit
[1:37:07] of maturity and yielding himself to the
[1:37:10] guidance of the Holy Spirit brought
[1:37:11] balance with this Spirit of wisdom and
[1:37:13] maturity brother Mar as a true Elder
[1:37:16] gently schooled all those present in the
[1:37:18] correct approach in dealing with the
[1:37:20] wife of the lamb as an elder he also
[1:37:22] became a counselor times to put my wife
[1:37:25] and me when we needed answers to various
[1:37:27] questions that besiege new Believers but
[1:37:30] the max Temperance was phenomenal one
[1:37:33] incident while we roomed together still
[1:37:35] stands out of my memory brother ma ask
[1:37:36] me to remove a tag from his jacket his
[1:37:38] new suit which we already DED at the
[1:37:41] time we were running a bit late and in
[1:37:43] my Hast I cut a small hole in the cuff
[1:37:45] of his new suit I could have seen the
[1:37:48] disappointment that immediately flashed
[1:37:50] across M Mar's face but just as quickly
[1:37:52] it was gone as he was more concerned
[1:37:54] about my anguish at the damage I had
[1:37:56] inadvertently caused to make matters
[1:37:58] worse I found out it was an expensive
[1:38:00] suit but a Max's genuine and effortless
[1:38:03] self-control in that situation has
[1:38:05] always been and continues to be an
[1:38:07] inspiration and guide when I find myself
[1:38:09] in situations similar situations but I'm
[1:38:12] ma an elder who left footprints in the
[1:38:14] sands of time an elder worthy of
[1:38:17] emulation brother Mike Blackman praise
[1:38:19] the Lord
[1:38:21] amen the third one is from CIA Charles
[1:38:24] it is easy to conceive it isn't easy to
[1:38:27] conceive a world without our precious
[1:38:30] brother Michael MCM he was in many ways
[1:38:32] a constant Staple in our lives but a ma
[1:38:34] was very still and steady never a bad
[1:38:36] word of conflict he was always kind
[1:38:39] generous gracious many of us were able
[1:38:41] to attend conventions abroad because of
[1:38:43] his Hospitality his willingness to host
[1:38:45] Us in his home and shuffer us to the
[1:38:47] destination year after year he served
[1:38:50] God's people with unwavering commitment
[1:38:52] but a would brother max if brother Max
[1:38:54] said he would collect you at 2: p.m. to
[1:38:56] head to P Harrisburg he would fetch you
[1:38:58] at 6:30 p.m. and while you would be
[1:39:01] stressed out and worried he would
[1:39:03] casually put your bags in the car and
[1:39:05] ask if you're ready to go very
[1:39:06] unbuttered but nobody could stay mad at
[1:39:10] brother MCM for long his heart and love
[1:39:13] for God's people is unsurpassed I wanted
[1:39:16] to remember him today for many years I
[1:39:18] worked alongside him at heon where he
[1:39:21] helped people improve their health with
[1:39:22] the same passion and fervor as he did
[1:39:24] helping people to cist I thank him for
[1:39:27] the confidence he placed in me to manage
[1:39:28] the local arm of the business and that
[1:39:30] all I learned from him and his kindness
[1:39:32] to me and my daughter hadassa May rest
[1:39:34] in peace and we will see him again in
[1:39:36] the morning sister cyia

[1:39:55] Church his work was later carried on by
[1:39:57] brother George and brother ID at that
[1:39:59] tender age I accepted Jesus as my savior
[1:40:02] and the baptized by Brother mcmo
[1:40:03] alongside a group of other believers to
[1:40:05] me he was like Moses a deliverer from
[1:40:07] the life I had known at 21 I married
[1:40:10] chat Ali it was brother mcmo who
[1:40:12] officiated our ceremony he was also our
[1:40:14] witness at the red house which where
[1:40:16] were where marriages were conducted in
[1:40:18] those days over the years he began
[1:40:20] traveling back and forth to the United
[1:40:22] States but his heart always remain with
[1:40:24] a little flucking cywell brother mcmo
[1:40:26] was a soldier in the army of God he
[1:40:28] seized every opportunity to share the
[1:40:30] gospel leading Conquest souls to Christ
[1:40:33] a man full of patience humility and
[1:40:35] simplicity he never sought recognition

[1:40:41] word of God and encouraging us to remain
[1:40:44] steadfast in our faith his support for
[1:40:46] the Ali family was unwavering I remember
[1:40:49] that many times he prayed for us
[1:40:50] especially during illness and life
[1:40:52] trials where it was a tractor accident
[1:40:54] involved with my husband our estate
[1:40:56] being ravaged by bushfires or my son's
[1:40:58] head operation one memory that stands
[1:41:01] out during a period when I was battling
[1:41:03] depression and isolated myself from
[1:41:05] others but M came to Trinidad found us
[1:41:08] at our camp on the estate and prayed for
[1:41:10] us he encouraged us to rise above the

[1:41:16] comforting meal of Bo casava with butter
[1:41:18] his love and guidance lifted us from
[1:41:20] that dark time I also remembered when
[1:41:23] Christmas when he spent the night in a
[1:41:24] humble home sleeping contentedly in a
[1:41:27] room made of mud and grass and a fiber
[1:41:29] mattress his Joy was contagious his

[1:44:04] girl as both my family and the mcmo
[1:44:07] family live at Mendoza Road Upper
[1:44:09] Belmont Valley Road in Belmont I never
[1:44:11] imagined or could have known that he
[1:44:14] would be my brother in Christ and even
[1:44:15] my employer in later years I remember
[1:44:19] remember when my dad was Ill B written
[1:44:21] back in 2004 brother Mack and brother

[1:44:55] greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:56] Christ to the mcmo family and all the
[1:44:58] saints gathered for this memorial
[1:45:00] service in honor of brother Michael mcmo
[1:45:02] it has been about an honor and a
[1:45:04] privilege to share a few words about the
[1:45:06] legacy of brother Michael mcmo a true
[1:45:08] soul of the cross of Jesus Christ while
[1:45:11] much can be said about his Christian
[1:45:12] testimony I want to highlight a
[1:45:14] significant part of his legacy one that
[1:45:17] I believe has remained largely Untold
[1:45:20] over the years in 198 to but the kman
[1:45:23] prophesied that the Holy Ghost would be
[1:45:25] outp poured in 1983 this prophecy was
[1:45:27] fulfilled in September and October in
[1:45:29] New York City where brother Michael MCM
[1:45:32] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:34] on Friday October 14th 1983 he returned
[1:45:38] to Trinidad that evening the Believers
[1:45:40] were gathered at brother Justin's
[1:45:42] Alexander home in Santa Cruz to watch a
[1:45:44] video of the Revival happening in New
[1:45:47] York City brother mcmo had attended a
[1:45:49] house dedication in ARA early that day
[1:45:52] with brother Hugh Williams and they
[1:45:53] arrived at brother Alexander's home
[1:45:55] around 1100 p.m. the living room was
[1:45:58] packed with Believers worshiping as the
[1:46:00] service was about to close but a MMO
[1:46:02] stood in the doorway facing the
[1:46:04] congregation he was asked to pray to to
[1:46:06] dismiss the service as he begin praying
[1:46:09] the Lord poured the Holy Ghost upon the
[1:46:11] Believers but a Hugh Williams who were
[1:46:13] standing on the porch next to brother
[1:46:15] mcmo was slain in the spirit and seal
[1:46:18] with the Holy Ghost the living room
[1:46:19] erupted with screams and shouts and the
[1:46:22] overwhelming anointing of God after the
[1:46:25] initial wave the power subsided but M
[1:46:28] boldly prayed Lord if this is you send
[1:46:31] back the power the Holy Ghost exploded
[1:46:34] in the room once again but he was slain
[1:46:36] on the power of God for a second time
[1:46:38] two days later on Sunday October 16th
[1:46:41] brother mcmo attended a service at
[1:46:43] Hillen Hall after brother Anon finished
[1:46:45] preaching the anointing of the holy
[1:46:46] spirit filled the entire building
[1:46:48] brother mcmo and brother n began laying
[1:46:50] hands on the Believers and when they lay
[1:46:52] hands on me the power of God overwhelmed
[1:46:55] me I fell to the floor on my back it was
[1:46:57] felt as though a hand with a knife was
[1:47:00] cutting into my heart I could feel my
[1:47:03] heart being torn apart my chest swell I
[1:47:05] clutch it with both hands the experience
[1:47:07] was both awesome and painful I cried out
[1:47:10] the top of my voice after about a minute
[1:47:12] it ended and profound peace and presence
[1:47:14] of God enveloped me I was no longer
[1:47:16] screaming instead I was speaking in
[1:47:18] tongues and many Believers received the
[1:47:20] Holy Ghost that morning when I emerg
[1:47:23] from this powerful experience I asked
[1:47:25] the Lord about it he revealed to me it
[1:47:28] was the circumcision of the Heart by the
[1:47:30] spirit as described in Romans 2:29 but
[1:47:33] he's a Jew which is one inwardly and
[1:47:36] circumcision is that of the heart in the
[1:47:38] spirit not in the letter whose praise is
[1:47:42] not of men but of God the Lord used
[1:47:44] brother Michael mcmo to spare the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost Revival that swept across trinad
[1:47:49] in 1983 he left behind a tremendous
[1:47:52] Legacy of Love love and labor for God's
[1:47:54] people let us continue his work with the
[1:47:57] same Zeal and enthusiasm he demonstrated
[1:48:00] pursuing the seeds of God with
[1:48:03] unwavering dedication I believe the same
[1:48:05] holy spirit that was at p in 93 is here
[1:48:07] today ready to be outp poured a new it
[1:48:10] is prophesied the Dynamics of this
[1:48:12] church will include a fresh refilling of
[1:48:15] the Holy Spirit brother mcm's Legacy
[1:48:17] lives on May we honor it by carrying
[1:48:19] forward the fire of Revival and laboring
[1:48:22] for the kingdom of God as he did your
[1:48:24] brother in Christ but Terence over it
[1:48:27] and for the praise the Lord
[1:48:29] amen certainly appreciate all these
[1:48:31] testimonies the last testimonies number
[1:48:33] eight is from me and I these what I
[1:48:36] shared I Shar this a couple of years
[1:48:37] back and I felt let to bring it back
[1:48:40] again words cannot fully Express the
[1:48:43] inspiration and guidance that brother
[1:48:46] Michael Ministry has provided through
[1:48:48] the years I vividly remember our time in
[1:48:51] cywell and his remark able patience
[1:48:54] something we often joked about we would
[1:48:57] say he would impress job himself with
[1:48:59] his patience but loving care and
[1:49:01] attention he worked with a vision
[1:49:04] trusting that one day the work he
[1:49:07] started would continue by God's grace my
[1:49:11] Foundation as a young Christian and
[1:49:13] Minister goes back to kaiwa and even
[1:49:16] earlier to when I work with brother
[1:49:19] Michael's father at MCM and Sons TR
[1:49:22] through that experience I first
[1:49:24] encountered cywell which I felt like a
[1:49:27] formative backside of the desert moment
[1:49:30] the lessons I learned there have been
[1:49:33] the foundation of my Ministry but
[1:49:36] Michael taught me how to serve
[1:49:38] selflessly to Bear the burdens and
[1:49:40] concern of others from him I gain a
[1:49:43] passion for Trinidad and the Caribbean
[1:49:46] learning to navigate challenges with
[1:49:48] grit and
[1:49:49] determination the Wilderness of kwell
[1:49:52] shaped and prepared me for what was to
[1:49:55] come I am forever grateful to brother
[1:49:58] Michael for teaching me the value of
[1:50:01] working with one person at a time
[1:50:03] devoting full attention and care to each
[1:50:06] Soul so many of his qualities have left
[1:50:10] a lasting mark on me there aren't enough
[1:50:13] pages in this collection to express what
[1:50:15] brother Michael means to us one of his
[1:50:18] favorite phrases was you need to get rid
[1:50:20] of toxins you need cleansing in he was
[1:50:24] always right both naturally and
[1:50:26] spiritually and even if he sometime got
[1:50:28] lost on the way to pen Harris he always
[1:50:31] had that Romans 8:28
[1:50:33] smile his home was a genuine welcome mat
[1:50:38] he split welcome into well welcome
[1:50:42] inviting multitudes over the years who
[1:50:44] felt at home in his presence his family
[1:50:47] graciously embraced his Spirit of
[1:50:49] hospitality prepared for countless
[1:50:52] guests friends and Believers as the
[1:50:54] years passed I saw his quiet maturity
[1:50:58] patience thoughtful influence shaped the
[1:51:01] lives of those around him I feel truly
[1:51:04] privileged to have met and known brother
[1:51:07] Michael it's remarkable that despite
[1:51:10] living in the USA for so many years he
[1:51:13] still makes time to visit Kwal the
[1:51:16] birthplace of The Headstone Tabernacle
[1:51:20] there the vision God give him for
[1:51:21] Trinidad and the cariban
[1:51:23] took root a seed that now bears fruit he
[1:51:27] have been a constant present like the
[1:51:29] North Star steadfast to the bride of
[1:51:32] Christ in Trinidad words fail to
[1:51:35] describe the impact of his connection
[1:51:38] New York and what it meant to us may God
[1:51:40] bless the MCM family may you be able to
[1:51:43] look around and see what the Lord Has
[1:51:46] Done Pastor ID and family God bless you
[1:51:55] amen and we want to say thank you again
[1:51:58] for all those
[1:51:59] testimonies truly we've been blessed and
[1:52:02] encouraged by all those kind
[1:52:06] words now we also have some special
[1:52:10] words from somebody who is very familiar
[1:52:14] as well brother George Kangley is going
[1:52:18] to bless us with some special
[1:52:20] words about our beloved brother Michael
[1:52:49] mcmo good day everyone
[1:52:52] special greetings to the
[1:52:54] MC
[1:52:58] Representatives I feel humbled you know
[1:53:01] to stand here after hearing all those
[1:53:04] well- written
[1:53:07] testimonies I started to write
[1:53:10] something and never really got completed
[1:53:14] so I try
[1:53:17] and bring out what I knew about brother
[1:53:19] Michael I first met brother Michael in
[1:53:22] the year
[1:53:25] 1974 he had
[1:53:27] um he had started to fellowship with a
[1:53:29] group we had in laven
[1:53:32] till where I was a member and he had
[1:53:34] recently returned from The Uso where he
[1:53:37] had been living and working for a few
[1:53:40] years he had worked I think he had been
[1:53:43] working with an architectural firm in
[1:53:45] New York
[1:53:47] City while there he used to
[1:53:51] attend a Bible Way
[1:53:53] Church who had known and practiced
[1:53:56] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:58] Christ I believe the pastor there was
[1:54:00] huu
[1:54:02] Rogers but not long after he um returned
[1:54:05] to
[1:54:06] Trinidad he started keeping Street
[1:54:08] meetings in kwall a little village near
[1:54:12] s Grande off the road to
[1:54:16] manela members of the U lavendel group
[1:54:19] would accompany him on his Outreach to
[1:54:22] the the residence of
[1:54:25] kwall while on the way up he would rent
[1:54:27] a loudspeaker system and keep meetings
[1:54:30] at the side of the road in
[1:54:33] cwall used to hang it up was a horn you
[1:54:37] know those horns hang it up on a
[1:54:40] tree and preach at the side of the road
[1:54:44] these meetings resulted in um a few
[1:54:48] baptisms and we have a few members here
[1:54:51] Sister marn Sister
[1:54:53] Rosemary and I see
[1:54:55] sister Sanja Harry Paul well we knew her
[1:54:58] as Harry Paul she's missing something
[1:55:00] now I don't have
[1:55:02] this and she came all the way
[1:55:05] from Princess Tong to be here
[1:55:13] today all right not long after we had
[1:55:16] left the street after the baptisms and
[1:55:18] we went um keep meetings in a home which
[1:55:21] was the
[1:55:24] which was owned by brother
[1:55:26] Michael father's Uncle if I have it
[1:55:30] correct
[1:55:32] vicus so we started keeping meetings
[1:55:35] there and as time went
[1:55:38] on Michael had um constructed a wooden
[1:55:42] building
[1:55:44] where the regular regular Church
[1:55:47] meetings were
[1:55:49] held he was constantly moving between
[1:55:51] nework York and Trinidad and didn't see
[1:55:54] himself as a pastor suely responsible
[1:55:57] for the group in
[1:55:59] cywell he believed that he would be able
[1:56:02] to hand the work
[1:56:03] over to someone that the Lord would send
[1:56:07] at some
[1:56:09] time in 1975 while we were there in kall
[1:56:13] bar kman
[1:56:15] visited and held meetings in
[1:56:18] um shonas under the opes of brother
[1:56:21] dunar who
[1:56:24] but kman was the invited guest and
[1:56:27] took all the
[1:56:32] services and uh it wasn't long after I
[1:56:34] think later in the year that um some
[1:56:38] convention meetings were held in um I
[1:56:40] think it was in Fort Wayne Indiana and
[1:56:42] brother Michael left to attend these
[1:56:47] meetings
[1:56:50] and he he ended up staying there for
[1:56:53] about nine months fellowshipping in New
[1:56:56] York under the ministry of Brother
[1:56:58] Joseph
[1:57:01] keman before he
[1:57:04] returned one thing I want to say about
[1:57:07] brother Michael is his
[1:57:11] witnessing I don't think I ever met
[1:57:13] anybody who could witness one
[1:57:18] onone as by
[1:57:20] Michael he had that
[1:57:23] d p as you will
[1:57:26] say one another virtue he had was
[1:57:31] patience he I remember him telling me
[1:57:34] one time that he was fellowshipping in
[1:57:37] this group and the the minister asked
[1:57:40] how many would like to have the patience
[1:57:42] of
[1:57:43] Job so he said everybody raise their
[1:57:45] hand they would like to have the
[1:57:46] patience of
[1:57:47] Job so the minister asks how many would
[1:57:50] like to have the trials of job
[1:57:53] and he say he was the only one he was
[1:57:56] the only one to raise his hand
[1:58:00] and brother everybody talks about his
[1:58:03] patience
[1:58:04] but job's patience came through his
[1:58:08] Childs and where Michael had his
[1:58:11] trials he had his trials with his
[1:58:13] sickness down in his latter end and so
[1:58:16] on but his patience held out sometime I
[1:58:20] used to think
[1:58:22] as if Michael used to exist outside of
[1:58:26] time as if you know well time didn't
[1:58:29] matter once he could get that word to
[1:58:32] somebody once he could get to talk to
[1:58:34] somebody to witness to somebody it
[1:58:36] didn't matter time or place doesn't
[1:58:40] matter what over it was but he would you
[1:58:42] know he was Z and
[1:58:45] that he was um he was friends to brother
[1:58:50] redhead here in Grenada
[1:58:52] and he had a brother in um Canada
[1:58:55] brother
[1:58:57] Luke Clyde Luke they were friends and he
[1:59:00] will visit their churches from time to
[1:59:04] time doing um convention meetings when
[1:59:08] we would attend to Convention meetings
[1:59:10] that brother Coleman held in
[1:59:14] Pennsylvania there will be brothers from
[1:59:17] as you heard from Trinidad visiting and
[1:59:20] would be we had brothers from Nigeria
[1:59:23] brother ULU and these brothers would
[1:59:25] come up and in those days they would
[1:59:29] stay about Michael's
[1:59:31] place to be sleeping on the floor think
[1:59:34] preparing for convention you
[1:59:37] know
[1:59:38] and what could I say what more could I
[1:59:42] say well
[1:59:44] Michael is the person you heard about

[2:10:20] chance happen to them all may be seated
[2:10:22] God bless you may God bless his
[2:10:29] word Psalms 90 is a a Psalm that I
[2:10:34] love verse 9 says for all our days are
[2:10:37] passed away in
[2:10:38] thra we spend our years as a tale that
[2:10:43] is
[2:10:44] told the days our years are three score
[2:10:46] years and 10 which is 70 and if by
[2:10:49] reason of strength there be four score
[2:10:51] years Years yet is their strength labor
[2:10:52] and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we
[2:10:57] fly away who knoweth the power of thine
[2:11:00] anger even to thy fear so is thy rra so
[2:11:03] teach us to number our days that we may
[2:11:07] apply our hearts to
[2:11:10] wisdom forther thought I have is a
[2:11:14] season and time to every
[2:11:18] purpose and I have an inspiration
[2:11:22] time was given to fulfill
[2:11:26] purpose that is the reason God give you
[2:11:30] time so if you don't know your purpose
[2:11:33] what will you
[2:11:35] fulfill but Ma had a
[2:11:37] purpose and he had a certain time to
[2:11:41] fulfill that to make sure the work is
[2:11:45] done Jesus had a purpose and when he
[2:11:48] died at the cross he said it is finished
[2:11:51] Paul said it this way I run I finished
[2:11:54] my course I've run my race there are too
[2:11:57] too much people live without purpose
[2:12:00] without purpose you have no
[2:12:03] Focus time was given to fulfill
[2:12:07] purpose when you miss your purpose you
[2:12:10] waste your time you waste your time your
[2:12:14] time is taken up with other things not
[2:12:17] connected to your
[2:12:19] purpose you know know I I came to the
[2:12:22] Lord I was in jundi doing electronic
[2:12:24] electrical engineering technician I
[2:12:26] wanted to be a medical doctor but a
[2:12:29] family was not positioned to for me to
[2:12:31] advance to that level so I went to
[2:12:34] do
[2:12:35] uh and in doing that I might have be a
[2:12:38] head of T and Tech Fall you
[2:12:39] know but then I give my heart to the
[2:12:42] Lord and I dropped out God knows why
[2:12:46] after one year doing quite well and then
[2:12:48] my family was furious and I can't
[2:12:51] remember exactly when I encounter
[2:12:52] Michael mcmo but then I had to get a job
[2:12:54] because you can't leave school and then
[2:12:56] come back home and sit in your mother
[2:12:57] house not in those times you had to get
[2:13:00] work had to get a job so I was blessed
[2:13:04] and privileged to work with MCM Sons for
[2:13:06] a while and that's getting know brother
[2:13:08] Michael and then that's how kwell came
[2:13:09] into for me let's
[2:13:12] go you waste your time and your time is
[2:13:16] taken up with other things not connected
[2:13:17] to your purpose then you feel
[2:13:19] unfulfilled
[2:13:22] true fulfillment comes from doing the
[2:13:25] will of
[2:13:26] God success doesn't bear a record of God
[2:13:29] you got have money car Boat Land house
[2:13:31] helicopter and
[2:13:32] plane that doesn't show that that is
[2:13:36] God's success the spirit is bear witness
[2:13:39] of God and when people
[2:13:41] not fulfilled they do crazy stuff they
[2:13:45] paint the house red they get a bigger
[2:13:46] house a bigger car because they competed
[2:13:48] with the neighbor the family the
[2:13:49] brothers and friends and whatnot there's
[2:13:50] something something lacking on the
[2:13:51] inside so you feel that you have to do
[2:13:54] this you feel for tension you feel and I
[2:13:56] think it was I think it was
[2:13:58] uh Mar Ali's testimony about brother
[2:14:01] Michael he wasn't trying to impress
[2:14:04] nobody he wasn't trying to impress
[2:14:06] anyone he was just winning souls and I
[2:14:09] have met countless people in New York
[2:14:11] and different places where they say it's
[2:14:13] brother Michael who want him to the Lord
[2:14:15] the brother Michael War him the Lord I
[2:14:17] remember time I I to give testimony
[2:14:18] about that a time I was driving he tell
[2:14:20] me stop here and and hold on behind the
[2:14:22] wheel because he going in some Subway to
[2:14:25] to to get somebody to carry them to
[2:14:26] service and whatnot and I behind the
[2:14:28] wheel they hold in the car there and I
[2:14:30] don't know where I'm at if east west
[2:14:32] north or south I don't know where faing
[2:14:33] more Direction I New York sitting down
[2:14:34] there some police coming and police come
[2:14:37] and say move move and I am furious cuz I
[2:14:42] don't know where I'm at and he was say 5
[2:14:44] minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes
[2:14:47] 20 minutes and I don't know if to go
[2:14:50] left right turn and I had to make a
[2:14:51] arounds when I do so he come normal
[2:14:54] smile you know is already you could be
[2:14:56] fussing you could be with normal smile
[2:14:57] like if nothing happen like if it's two
[2:14:59] minutes and he said the person didn't
[2:15:02] come that is that is on top of that then
[2:15:06] but that's what the kind of person he
[2:15:07] will go all out for a soul I think
[2:15:10] somebody said brother George say you
[2:15:11] have never seen anybody like that up to
[2:15:14] now I haven't seen anybody like that God
[2:15:17] help us to get something like that a
[2:15:19] burden for Souls amen that you could be
[2:15:22] concerned I Brother Gary said brother
[2:15:24] Mar share this testimony that's what
[2:15:26] when you get lit when he got lit he Shar
[2:15:28] it with his brother that's that that
[2:15:30] what we talking about when you really
[2:15:31] get lit up you could share your
[2:15:33] testimony you're not ashamed of the
[2:15:34] Gospel oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:15:37] praise God so when you do is will you
[2:15:40] feel fulfilled Our Lives will be the
[2:15:43] fruit of how we manage time and change
[2:15:48] listen carefully we cannot change time
[2:15:52] or influence time you can't ask time to
[2:15:56] hold on and wait until you know who you
[2:15:58] are time just rules on time respects no
[2:16:04] man or woman neither can we change
[2:16:09] time this physical body here is a body
[2:16:12] called time time is a kink in
[2:16:16] eternity time is a aberration or a
[2:16:20] little break
[2:16:21] in eternity and when this time is over
[2:16:23] we go back to Eternity hallu so brother
[2:16:27] Mar and all of us God put us in a body
[2:16:30] called time and one day this will be
[2:16:33] over so I wanted that picture I wanted a
[2:16:36] young picture of him to show what he
[2:16:37] going back to not the old man that you
[2:16:40] see died and going on no this man here
[2:16:42] and there's a picture Sim and like he's
[2:16:44] 29 years old that is what we talking
[2:16:46] about now because we not going to have
[2:16:48] gray hair across there and missing teeth
[2:16:50] and missing this and list
[2:16:51] that that is not we're going back to the
[2:16:54] original how we were supposed to be as
[2:16:57] Sons and Daughters of God so he'll be
[2:16:59] back young again he's going to pick up
[2:17:00] his body and back young again isn't that
[2:17:02] right so God make me to know my end and
[2:17:07] measure of my days what it is that I
[2:17:09] might know how frail I am like Psalms 39
[2:17:13] time breaks the idea or thought of your
[2:17:17] state is
[2:17:19] permanent time show shows you that you
[2:17:21] can change from sinner to
[2:17:24] Saint our life your life is measured by
[2:17:29] time years months weeks days within time
[2:17:34] you get
[2:17:36] Seasons God plac Us in time to fulfill
[2:17:40] our purpose and that's why I read a time
[2:17:41] to be born and as soon as that time hit
[2:17:43] you you have a time to die I know some
[2:17:46] of you feel you're living forever
[2:17:48] but that not what the Bible say you know
[2:17:51] a time to be born and born time to die
[2:17:54] so as soon as birth hit have a
[2:17:57] de you see how the amens
[2:18:00] disappear amen get light once you go
[2:18:02] down there you go born yeah you're born
[2:18:05] but you have to fulfill stuff within
[2:18:08] time sometime people time run out
[2:18:11] sometime because of behavior people God
[2:18:13] cut them off before time say die too
[2:18:16] soon God cut them off God judged them
[2:18:19] that same time we talking about body so
[2:18:22] therefore everything have a season and a
[2:18:24] time so under time you get season spring
[2:18:26] winter summer and whatnot so in in in
[2:18:29] winter time all the leaves are off the
[2:18:31] tree so if you come and my season now is
[2:18:34] winter you laugh at me say look at him
[2:18:36] you no leaves St like
[2:18:39] that you look in her eyes you're looking
[2:18:42] like nothing working out but the season
[2:18:44] yeah check the right season yet come
[2:18:46] back in the spring check me back in the
[2:18:49] season of spring time and you will see
[2:18:52] green life and you see things pushing
[2:18:54] out and so so sometime you may catch me
[2:18:57] in a low time in a different kind of
[2:18:59] season but wait my season coming your
[2:19:01] season coming tell the devil is a liar
[2:19:04] because you have a season and time to
[2:19:07] every purpose under Heaven there's a
[2:19:08] seasonal time you can't wait you can't
[2:19:11] you can't force God's hand he said at
[2:19:13] the time appointed I will R return to
[2:19:15] you according to the time of life your
[2:19:17] breakthrough have a season your
[2:19:19] deliverance have a season in your
[2:19:21] financial breakthrough of a season
[2:19:23] whatever you are think in other words
[2:19:24] your state is not permanent your
[2:19:27] depression is not permanent your
[2:19:28] frustration is not permanent your
[2:19:30] anguish and pain and suffering is not
[2:19:32] permanent it's only for a Time Oh Glory
[2:19:34] to God time have an ending because time
[2:19:37] had a beginning oh I feel to preach this
[2:19:39] night Hallelujah did you get that time
[2:19:41] had a beginning therefore time had an
[2:19:42] ending everything had a beginning had an
[2:19:45] ending so as jealousy had a beginning it
[2:19:47] have an ending Envy have a beginning it
[2:19:49] have an ending but love had no
[2:19:51] oh give the Lord a praise Oh Glory to
[2:19:54] God love had no beginning therefore you
[2:19:55] can't kill love you can't stop love God
[2:19:57] so loved the world he come down to
[2:19:59] redeem you that you could come to
[2:20:01] repentance and get right with god oh
[2:20:03] give the Lord some Praises every purpose
[2:20:06] has a time to fulfill its reason for
[2:20:09] being so time was created to fulfill
[2:20:12] purpose you were born to fulfill purpose
[2:20:15] time is not waiting for you to get a
[2:20:17] revelation of your purpose time
[2:20:19] manifests itself is Seasons seasons
[2:20:22] change with time amen so our lives are
[2:20:25] not measured by our age but by what
[2:20:28] purpose we are fulfilled it's not how
[2:20:30] long we are in a message it is what we
[2:20:32] have done with the message I won't be
[2:20:34] long I have five pages and our page two
[2:20:36] already so you know we
[2:20:38] close time gives us
[2:20:42] opportunities today is the first day of
[2:20:45] the rest of your
[2:20:48] life time gives you the opportunity to
[2:20:50] to be changed to be transformed we spend
[2:20:54] our years as a tale that is told there's
[2:20:56] a time there's a funeral going on and
[2:20:58] people started talk about the Man in the
[2:20:59] Box and talk and talk and somebody get
[2:21:01] up from the congregation and went to
[2:21:02] look in the box to see if they write
[2:21:04] funeral because who they know in that
[2:21:06] box and what they're saying about that
[2:21:08] man is two different things so they
[2:21:10] wanted to make sure they in the right
[2:21:12] funeral but what you hear today with the
[2:21:15] different testimonies you know what you
[2:21:17] see what you hear is in harmony
[2:21:21] everybody can take the same testimony
[2:21:23] concerning this brother called Michael
[2:21:25] MC is that something we spend our years
[2:21:28] the tail of this
[2:21:30] toll sometime I wonder about that you
[2:21:32] know if I kick the bucket what people
[2:21:33] will say about
[2:21:41] me look at the testimonies a tail that
[2:21:45] is told look at the tale that's being
[2:21:47] told I could tell you that this church
[2:21:49] here is the fruit of a SE seed that's
[2:21:51] planted in
[2:21:54] Kaiba and brother ma lived long enough
[2:21:57] to see the fruit of his
[2:22:00] labor so go brother Mar can't be a good
[2:22:02] seed and he pass the B on to a bad seed
[2:22:04] something wrong God doesn't work
[2:22:08] so the only reason we are here is
[2:22:11] because God have a purpose for us being
[2:22:12] here there is going to be a BRI Revival
[2:22:15] there's going to be a super Church
[2:22:17] there's going to be signs ones and
[2:22:18] Miracles more importantly they in the
[2:22:21] grave have to come forth and they
[2:22:23] without us are not made perfect so
[2:22:25] there's got to be a people come to
[2:22:27] Perfection he long for Unity he's always
[2:22:29] talk about that uniting and uniting when
[2:22:31] you talk about that talk people not
[2:22:32] interested in that always talk about
[2:22:34] unity and I made a pledge to love the
[2:22:37] Brethren people will smile with me and
[2:22:39] have a dagger behind the back I don't
[2:22:41] watch the dagger you know I Smile

[2:23:27] I'm walking in how much miles are going
[2:23:29] to go up the hill to pump and what that
[2:23:31] I remember when I come up there three
[2:23:33] people to preach to but Joseph I didn't
[2:23:35] stay
[2:23:35] home you come quite here from Belmont to
[2:23:38] to preach of two people I say when you
[2:23:40] repent go go forgive you the next day he
[2:23:43] repent because you see it wasn't about
[2:23:45] the people it was about the mission
[2:23:51] and this were a lot of ministers a lot
[2:23:52] of preachers they don't even understand
[2:23:54] what it is to be the backside desert or
[2:23:56] you know people opening car holding a
[2:23:57] briefcase for them and the Bible and all
[2:23:59] them kind of modern thing they don't
[2:24:00] know about the fields they don't know
[2:24:02] about the grit and grind they don't even
[2:24:04] know about winning Souls they're looking
[2:24:05] for tee people from the next
[2:24:07] Church sheep
[2:24:09] rustling
[2:24:11] prolighting they know what witnessing
[2:24:13] some of them went one Soul or they
[2:24:15] looking at they eye long long looking to
[2:24:16] see what a man have and how they could
[2:24:18] take it
[2:24:21] I I want to finish I let finish on page
[2:24:26] three we spend our years is a tale told
[2:24:30] time is like currency you can spend it
[2:24:35] you can waste it you could abuse it some
[2:24:38] people use their time wisely others
[2:24:41] foolishly what are you doing with your
[2:24:45] time time is not waiting on you God
[2:24:48] places Us in time to fulfill purpose
[2:24:53] therefore we need to know our purpose
[2:24:56] what am I here for to do it's either you
[2:25:01] are done which is you fulfill your
[2:25:02] purpose like brother Michael or you are
[2:25:05] doing it or you are you got to do it it
[2:25:08] is done to do or doing either right now
[2:25:13] you are working in your purpose I right
[2:25:15] now you are done your purpose if you
[2:25:17] done your purpose time for God to take
[2:25:18] you home because your work on Earth is
[2:25:20] done
[2:25:21] so God could take you off your
[2:25:22] usefulness is no longer applicable to
[2:25:25] God or his people I told him already I'm
[2:25:27] not com here with no cloak stick behind
[2:25:28] the pit I'm not come here with that I
[2:25:32] ain't coming like that because I believe
[2:25:35] that you have to be useful to God into
[2:25:36] his people God tell David go your way
[2:25:38] with your fathers go and sleep God tell
[2:25:40] Daniel go thy way go and sleep your time
[2:25:43] is not yet but you have to know you have
[2:25:46] truly fulfilled the purpose that God
[2:25:47] raised you up for do you know your
[2:25:50] purpose almost done Matthew
[2:25:52] 25 the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man
[2:25:54] traveling to a far country and he give
[2:25:56] one five talents we know the story five
[2:25:58] talents other he give two the other he
[2:26:00] give one after a long time the Lord of
[2:26:03] those servants cometh and and reckon
[2:26:05] with them so he that received five
[2:26:07] talents came and brought other five
[2:26:09] talents said Lord they give me five or
[2:26:12] five more he said well done now good and
[2:26:14] faithful servant that has been faithful
[2:26:16] in few things I make you rule over many
[2:26:18] things he that received two brought two
[2:26:20] he said well done good and faithful
[2:26:21] servant and so on he received one Talent
[2:26:24] came and said Lord he the
[2:26:26] testimony I knew thee that thou a hard
[2:26:30] man reaping where thou was not sown
[2:26:32] guarding where thou was not St I was
[2:26:34] afraid I went and hid thy talent in the
[2:26:37] earth L there thou Hast that is nine his
[2:26:40] Lord answered him thou Wicked and sful
[2:26:43] servant th un profitability you know if
[2:26:45] you don't produce and add to what God
[2:26:49] give you over time time he see you as
[2:26:51] wicked you know and he's supposed to see
[2:26:53] it as wicked not your killing time and
[2:26:55] just dear dear dear no God nothing in
[2:26:57] subtraction business and division
[2:26:59] business God and the multiplication and
[2:27:00] the addition it blessing I Will Bless
[2:27:02] thee in multiplying and multiply thee
[2:27:04] God is the adding business so God give
[2:27:06] Baka seed and say so that and then in
[2:27:09] time time going unfold and you will see
[2:27:12] the revelation of that seed that was
[2:27:14] planted oh blessed be the name of the
[2:27:17] Lord listen to this now he said the Lord
[2:27:19] answered thou Wicked slothful servant th
[2:27:21] newest that I reap i s not and gather
[2:27:23] and you know the kind of man that I am
[2:27:26] and you bury the money why didn't put in
[2:27:27] the bank and guess some interest on it
[2:27:29] he said thou oughtest to have put my
[2:27:30] money in the exchanges and then at my
[2:27:33] coming I should have received my own
[2:27:35] with Usery take therefore the talent
[2:27:37] from him and give it unto him that had
[2:27:40] 10 talents now hear this bum for
[2:27:43] everyone that had shall be given he that
[2:27:46] and he shall have an abundance but from
[2:27:49] him that hath not shall be taken away
[2:27:51] even what he
[2:27:55] had I'm almost
[2:28:02] finished there are four primary Seasons
[2:28:04] spring summer autumn winter we no about
[2:28:06] that but listen to this part Perfection
[2:28:09] lets patience have a perfect work that
[2:28:11] it may be perfect and entire lacking
[2:28:12] nothing God's will for us is
[2:28:15] perfection that Perfection is patience
[2:28:19] waiting on God
[2:28:21] and waiting for God that is where time
[2:28:25] comes
[2:28:26] in now you know what we preach nobody
[2:28:31] has gotten cored by blessings note is
[2:28:34] almost like the more blessings and money
[2:28:35] and well people have is the more slacker
[2:28:37] it becomes the more loose they become
[2:28:39] they start to look gamble games because
[2:28:41] they have no burden for money they have
[2:28:43] no B they have everything already they
[2:28:45] don't have to ask God they they have
[2:28:46] money they're sick go to the doctor
[2:28:48] right but when we talking about
[2:28:50] character this is where tests trials
[2:28:53] pain suffering comes because you get
[2:28:56] character through suffering character is
[2:28:59] not a gift God doesn't gift you with
[2:29:01] character you change and you transform
[2:29:05] and you become characterized like him
[2:29:08] through stuff that you go through or
[2:29:10] give the Lord some praise to somebody so
[2:29:13] waiting on God and waiting for God that
[2:29:16] is where time comes in waiting on and
[2:29:20] waiting for on and for you're waiting on
[2:29:24] God to get clearance to do what you
[2:29:27] think or feel God want you to do now if
[2:29:30] you don't have the time and the patience
[2:29:33] you run ahead you get burned and that is
[2:29:35] where I get burned to learn time waiting
[2:29:40] is the means by which this process of
[2:29:43] character development takes place this
[2:29:45] is the process of character development
[2:29:50] how highly God commment his Saints in
[2:29:51] the Dark Ages patience that the lamb is
[2:29:53] went to the slaughter so God stands in
[2:29:56] eternity and speaks into time like a
[2:29:59] book the novel we talk about you could
[2:30:01] have a novel you have past present
[2:30:02] future in the book you're reading it but
[2:30:05] you are outside the book so you could go
[2:30:07] to the Past you could go to the Future
[2:30:08] you could go to the presents in the book
[2:30:10] so just like that God could look into
[2:30:12] your life and intervene in your life he
[2:30:15] could speak into your life and that
[2:30:17] changed everything in other words you
[2:30:19] could be transformed change everything
[2:30:20] could change for you today by your
[2:30:22] attitude amen praise God time is common
[2:30:26] to everyone 24 hours what you are what
[2:30:30] you become depends upon how you use that
[2:30:33] time you could live in Facebook or you
[2:30:35] could live in your knees in prayer you
[2:30:37] could live in social media or you could
[2:30:39] seek God for yourself that is your
[2:30:41] choice you can't stop time but you can
[2:30:44] manage time how time is used you can do
[2:30:48] with time but what you want to do with
[2:30:50] it life is defined by time life is
[2:30:55] measured I call it three score and 10
[2:30:57] which is 7 life is determined by time
[2:31:01] time is temporary oh praise
[2:31:05] God Timothy 4 2 Timothy 4 said I fought
[2:31:08] a good fight I'll finished my course
[2:31:12] I've kept the faith Ty time I lifetime I
[2:31:15] I love time you know I like when
[2:31:17] somebody ask me to speak for 10 minutes
[2:31:19] I speak for eight minutes and get them 2
[2:31:20] minutes change I like time because time
[2:31:23] give you no time to waste words if you
[2:31:25] know you have to speak for 10 minutes
[2:31:27] then you can't just talk and talk about
[2:31:28] Mor and long water and how D you know
[2:31:30] just dragging things along and Rebecca
[2:31:32] riding the camel to go and see Isaac and
[2:31:34] you're just going you can't you can't go
[2:31:36] there you have to choose your words
[2:31:38] because it's in
[2:31:40] time about to
[2:31:43] close
[2:31:45] time when can and Abel was born children
[2:31:48] they playing and whatnot the Bible says
[2:31:50] in the process of time God say offer up
[2:31:54] present an offering Cain offer something
[2:31:57] Abel offer something and God blessed
[2:32:00] Abel and Cain was angry and upset time
[2:32:04] only time reveals
[2:32:07] jealousy time reveals lies from truth
[2:32:12] time reveals True Believers from false
[2:32:15] Believers from
[2:32:16] Hypocrites God's burden is to get man to
[2:32:19] repentance
[2:32:20] God's burden is to reveal himself to
[2:32:22] reveal himself to you because somebody
[2:32:25] testified to you praise God you have to
[2:32:28] come into this selfless life having a
[2:32:31] heart for others especially they who are
[2:32:33] lost you know we talk about brother ma
[2:32:35] spending time with people you know that
[2:32:37] was a sacrifice to
[2:32:38] him you may not have seen that like we
[2:32:42] say sometime people like freting freting
[2:32:43] freting but somebody paying for it what
[2:32:46] you think is free to you somebody pay
[2:32:47] for it I get free really it it cost
[2:32:50] something when brother Mar spend time
[2:32:52] with this one and that one it cost him
[2:32:54] something you in not seal Mar blessed me
[2:32:57] and he was with me and so yes but it
[2:32:58] cost him time his time he can be do
[2:33:01] other things but he choose to spend time
[2:33:03] with
[2:33:03] you that's what God is
[2:33:09] doing I'm
[2:33:11] done God used someone to reach out to
[2:33:14] you someone testify to you and the Holy
[2:33:18] Ghost used that testimony to steal your
[2:33:20] heart to wo you to draw you and here you
