[13:10] come by Revelation inspiration to every
[13:12] believer granted Lord and Jesus I ask it
[13:15] amen amen God bless you and thanks for
[13:18] being here tonight
[13:20] uh you're gonna be doing other stuff
[13:21] other things but you choose to be in
[13:24] this virtual room tonight I have two
[13:26] portions of scripture like to read from
[13:27] James five
[13:29] 17-18
[13:31] and also Luke chapter 11 11 to 13.
[13:35] and this James 5 the scripture that we
[13:38] familiar with Elias was a man's subject
[13:42] to like passions as we are
[13:44] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[13:47] not rain
[13:49] and it ruined not on the Earth by the
[13:51] space of three years and six months and
[13:56] he prayed again
[13:57] in heaven give rain and the airport and
[14:00] fruit
[14:01] the Amplified of this scripture Elijah
[14:05] was a human being
[14:06] with a nature such as we have with
[14:09] feelings affections and a constitution
[14:12] like ours only pretty not to Reign and
[14:16] no rain fell on the earth for three
[14:19] years in six months then he prayed again
[14:21] and Heaven supplied rain and the man
[14:24] produces crops as usual as usual
[14:28] Luke 11
[14:33] if a son
[14:34] shall ask bread of any of you that is a
[14:38] father
[14:39] will he give him a stone
[14:40] or if he asks a fish will he for a fish
[14:44] give him a serpent
[14:45] or if he shall ask an egg
[14:47] will he offer him a Scorpio
[14:49] if Eden being evil know how to give good
[14:53] gifts unto your children
[14:55] or much more
[14:57] shall the heavenly father give the Holy
[14:59] Spirit to them that ask him
[15:03] God bless you
[15:05] about one month ago we spoke on much
[15:07] time in prayer
[15:09] tonight
[15:11] we would like to touch on pray and true
[15:14] pray true to pray true
[15:17] this is more unseen words to God
[15:20] this is praying until you know not only
[15:23] he heard your prayer but you've got a
[15:27] response
[15:28] okay let's go tonight
[15:30] let's bear with me a few things and I
[15:32] trust that it will give you a key in
[15:34] Focus tonight
[15:36] in a child of Prayer
[15:38] Joshua was perseverant for he moved God
[15:41] said I give it to you
[15:43] and they were looking at what they could
[15:45] see
[15:46] Joshua was looking at what God Said
[15:49] it depends upon what you're looking at
[15:52] the Christian looks at the Unseen
[15:55] I I wish they could stick with us
[15:57] tonight the Christian looks at the
[16:01] Unseen the whole armor of Christianity
[16:04] is unseen
[16:05] Everlasting thing is unseen the things
[16:08] the Seeing Things Are material and the
[16:11] Earth is the mother of all of it but the
[16:14] Unseen the whole armor of God is an
[16:17] unseen Affair love joy peace Faith No
[16:21] suffering goodness meekness gentle so
[16:24] forth Holy Ghost spirit all that is
[16:27] unseen that's the last 10 things the
[16:30] Eternal things that's the whole power of
[16:33] God now everything the Christian can
[16:35] depend on is unseening the promise of
[16:38] God as we look at something that we
[16:40] don't see with our eyes by the way it's
[16:42] a secret your eyes you don't see the
[16:44] seed means to understand you look at
[16:46] anything right straight As I don't see
[16:48] it you mean you don't understand it when
[16:50] something has got an understanding that
[16:53] God made his promise and something has
[16:55] struck you that you believe that and
[16:57] that's the understanding that God
[17:00] promises to you and then something is
[17:02] going to happen then I don't care nobody
[17:05] in the world can talk you out of it
[17:06] you're on your road then nothing going
[17:09] to stop you
[17:11] and then he says about Washington you
[17:13] know the trials of boots America
[17:15] Washington when he prayed through he was
[17:18] ready
[17:19] and he said when men hear from God and
[17:22] know that it is scriptural then they can
[17:24] be persevered you've got to hear from
[17:27] God now watch
[17:29] and it's interesting because he brought
[17:31] a side of Charlotte Michigan Abednego
[17:34] that we would have never seen if God
[17:37] didn't send a prophet to show us this
[17:39] you know you hear the king accent the
[17:41] bow down and then you see me Will Not
[17:44] Bow Down and everything else we know
[17:45] this story but listen to this stuff
[17:47] could you imagine putting the holy ghost
[17:49] out of a man can't be done the bond
[17:52] these three Hebrew children put them in
[17:54] front of a steer start walking up the
[17:56] platform and they were to fall into this
[17:58] gratefulness
[18:00] I can hear shajak Sita Misha
[18:03] did you you sure you're pretty true
[18:05] listen this carefully
[18:08] he is dramatizing
[18:11] to Misha you're sure you're preacher oh
[18:15] my thought tonight is
[18:17] have you pretty true that's it that's
[18:19] the title I answered have you preached
[18:22] and sometimes isn't when Satan puts the
[18:26] heat on
[18:27] we have to stop and check up Lord
[18:31] do I truly believe you
[18:33] I can hear say yes it's all prayed up
[18:37] now
[18:38] he said you want to take that back boy
[18:40] nope we are willing to seal Our
[18:43] Testimony with our own life we already
[18:45] know
[18:46] I can hear King number Canada say well
[18:48] if your wooden ball don't get the image
[18:50] the ticket back he said no we have took
[18:53] our way with the Lord despise you we
[18:54] know the story so the summary of that is
[18:58] [Music]
[18:59] already prayed through they wasn't
[19:02] wondering uh you know what I was saying
[19:04] what I would talk to the Lord
[19:06] further
[19:08] boom wouldn't have he control Waters you
[19:11] see I'll go down there I can hear him
[19:13] say one word your good Angel you obeyed
[19:15] me ever since I created you I can't let
[19:18] you go he said Lord have you considered
[19:20] yes
[19:22] I've been watching them all night long
[19:25] I have watched them all night long I
[19:29] heard them in the prayer meeting last
[19:30] night
[19:31] I hear them when they pray true and they
[19:35] struck every year with their prayers
[19:38] oh brother Ovid it have prayers and
[19:41] prayers yes it has prayed I could stay
[19:44] right under your roof in your house
[19:45] either of prayer that can strike him
[19:50] let me read it again this is Brother
[19:52] Branham seeing like what the Lord is
[19:55] saying I've heard him in their
[19:57] permission last night I heard him
[20:00] when they pray true
[20:02] and they struck Heaven here with their
[20:04] prince I'm watching them I know when
[20:07] they caught one more step to go I have
[20:10] been watching them all night long I
[20:12] can't let you go because it's a
[20:15] man-sized job I'm going down myself
[20:19] we know the story
[20:22] he's talking about Abraham uh talking
[20:24] about Iran in the holiest of holies man
[20:26] is fresh not contaminated and then he
[20:29] says that and the veil drops over you
[20:32] see what I mean when the real is
[20:34] from the outside world
[20:35] he said was you ever so lost in Christ
[20:39] so pray true
[20:41] this is not saying prayers so pray true
[20:43] until the world you had no more to do
[20:47] with it at all
[20:48] you walk humbly every day before Christ
[20:51] loving in fruits in other words you're
[20:54] not that Christian on Sunday because
[20:55] you're in church among church folks and
[20:58] by by Monday like a semi level or like a
[21:01] holy person or like you don't know who
[21:03] you are or like you're you're completely
[21:06] different from how you are Sunday your
[21:08] Sunday status or or activity like if you
[21:12] go back and listen to in his presence
[21:13] mom says put his presence between you
[21:16] and your sins put his presence between
[21:18] you and Allah put your prince presence
[21:19] between you online and you want whatever
[21:22] it might be that troubling your life put
[21:24] his presence see see this the Lord is
[21:27] before me I shall not be moved the Lord
[21:29] is before me
[21:31] let's continue
[21:34] what Rama speaking about
[21:37] a service atmosphere
[21:39] and he was speaking on the subject of
[21:41] the resurrection of Christ
[21:43] when a big old boy is standing there
[21:45] around to The Altar and hollered God
[21:48] have mercy on my soul
[21:51] now listen to this
[21:52] and when he came up
[21:54] he never got all the way to the altar
[21:57] hardly there was about 50 of those old
[22:00] grannies out there
[22:02] grab them around the neck
[22:05] down to the altar they took him so this
[22:08] boy get convicted he said caught on
[22:11] Mercy on my soul
[22:13] he's wrong to be older
[22:15] and about 50 of these grannies they
[22:18] didn't tell them come and pray for them
[22:20] and somebody are you altered no the
[22:22] grannies run hold him down
[22:25] and begin to pray with them
[22:28] there was about 50 some odd conversions
[22:30] that afternoon
[22:32] no they didn't get down there with a dry
[22:35] eye confession and get up
[22:37] they prayed with him
[22:39] about two hours I guess
[22:42] they got up
[22:43] listen listen to this and their clothing
[22:46] was so wet
[22:48] just ringing them out where they
[22:51] perspired
[22:53] they got up and shouted
[22:55] gone through the woods up over the hills
[22:58] they were hollering hallelujah
[22:59] hallelujah that they might be
[23:02] embarrassing but they had the old-time
[23:06] Holy Ghost religion that's the truth
[23:10] so in those deeds somebody come to the
[23:13] altar the old granny is the old folks in
[23:16] the spirit they have a reason for that
[23:18] soul and they went after him
[23:21] pre-reading for two hours and when they
[23:24] finish
[23:25] their clothing was went let's continue
[23:30] get that old cancer condition away from
[23:33] the church get out of it woman
[23:36] get out of it men
[23:39] not only women but men too and preacher
[23:42] also
[23:44] you have let down the bar pastor
[23:46] there is something wrong with you
[23:49] you haven't prayed truth or you will
[23:53] absolutely see your congregation getting
[23:55] in that condition
[23:57] you will stand and resist the thing if
[24:00] you preach the forwards that's exactly
[24:03] the truth so everybody's coming here
[24:05] everybody's covered man woman pastor
[24:09] you've got to preacher
[24:11] he said what we need is an old-fashioned
[24:13] scoring out cleaning up are you
[24:15] Pentecostal people don't watch the
[24:17] practice and Presbyterian are going to
[24:18] take a blessing and go to Glory with it
[24:20] famous practice ministers and
[24:22] Presbyterian and lutherans are receiving
[24:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost saying we
[24:26] are hungry Faith by the brand we are
[24:27] hungry with it or we are going on and on
[24:29] some of the outstanding men in the
[24:31] nation hungering for god let's clean up
[24:34] let all of us the Lutheran the Baptist
[24:36] the Presbyterian the Pentecostal we are
[24:39] not divided we are one big church let's
[24:40] go from Victory to Victory no it's over
[24:42] cleanup right
[24:44] clean up is your testimony to God that
[24:47] you are expecting something you are
[24:50] preparing your heart you're preparing
[24:52] your mind you're preparing to receive
[24:54] praise the Lord let's continue
[24:57] okay
[24:59] one day while everyone was praying no
[25:01] doubt he prayed through
[25:02] till he struck the hand of God how did
[25:05] how did he do it by faith perhaps he
[25:08] taught like this if he is a God who made
[25:10] the ark I let Noah flow through he still
[25:13] lives today somewhere in the land of the
[25:15] heathens he is the journey and you touch
[25:18] the hand of God in Dear God give him a
[25:20] revelation and there was a situ's build
[25:23] and maker was God
[25:24] and we read about Abraham's life he had
[25:27] faith that there was a city whose
[25:29] building America was God and eternal
[25:31] system he had a purpose in life to find
[25:34] that place so watch this the Revelation
[25:37] whereas Republic Abraham that there's a
[25:39] city who is making the list God when
[25:42] that struck his soul his purpose become
[25:44] become I'm going to find that City so
[25:47] he's seeking a city whose making
[25:49] deliveries God
[25:51] no here is them
[25:52] you can't purpose anything of God's
[25:56] promise in your heart
[25:58] without finding the reality to it
[26:01] what's the challenge for a lot of young
[26:03] people today
[26:04] got no purpose they live in day-to-day
[26:07] living almost like I exist
[26:09] existed but without purpose there is no
[26:14] point of Direction
[26:16] because the purpose with vision with
[26:19] Revelation you have a destination and
[26:21] you want to get there
[26:23] so whether you have to drop friends
[26:24] family relatives whether you have to
[26:27] give up this and give up that you do it
[26:29] because you want to find harmony with
[26:32] the purpose that God raised you up from
[26:34] so hear what he's in again these are
[26:37] powerful words you can't purpose and
[26:39] this applies for tonight they come that
[26:41] you personally receive the Holy Ghost
[26:43] you put bless the night together
[26:44] breakthrough you purposely get delivered
[26:46] you propose a night that your life will
[26:47] be changed you can't poop us anything of
[26:51] God's promise yeah here we go get away
[26:53] in your heart touch your head in your
[26:56] heart without finding the reality to it
[27:00] if your soul
[27:03] has been tormented by sins and doubts
[27:06] ups and downs frustrations and there is
[27:09] something done in you that is telling
[27:12] you that there is somewhere you can
[27:14] overcome that
[27:15] why do you float around them from church
[27:18] to church from place to place
[27:20] just kneel down
[27:23] till you strike heaven could I read it
[27:26] again
[27:26] if your soul has been tormented by sins
[27:30] and doubts and ups and downs and
[27:31] frustrations and there is something
[27:33] wrong in you telling you that there is
[27:35] some way you can overcome that why do
[27:38] you fluke from church to church from
[27:40] place to place just knead on till you
[27:43] strike him
[27:44] as I said last night go beyond the song
[27:48] barriers
[27:49] then you will have a purpose in life
[27:54] you'll have purpose in belonging to the
[27:56] church
[27:56] you'll have purpose in being baptized
[27:59] you will have purpose in what you are
[28:02] seeking for
[28:03] cause we know God is honest God is true
[28:06] and God cannot lie and if God please
[28:11] start into Abraham's heart but his voice
[28:13] his word then God has placed it in
[28:16] before us in this Bible by the witness
[28:19] of the Holy Spirit by The Return of the
[28:21] Holy Spirit and sign them Wonders that
[28:23] Jesus still lives and is the same
[28:25] yesterday today and forever if you need
[28:29] whatsoever that God has promised in his
[28:31] Bible he is here tonight to meet that
[28:34] need no need of seeking further his
[28:37] presence is here his spirit is here and
[28:40] he is willing and ready and longing to
[28:43] give you what you are seeking for why
[28:47] would you wait any longer so that is the
[28:50] top part written in Bowl written in
[28:52] black and white he is willing and ready
[28:56] and longing to give you what you are
[28:59] seeking for a support type
[29:02] now watch let's go to Define writing now
[29:04] this is this is this is a subset of this
[29:08] bowl writing on top
[29:10] next verse
[29:12] when you come to him
[29:16] don't come as a flute
[29:19] I will go up and try and see if it works
[29:23] you will never get no way
[29:25] so he's actually putting a clause of
[29:28] what we just read he's willing to give
[29:30] you but showing you how you must come
[29:32] the approach
[29:34] listen to this but when you come
[29:37] with this kind of determination
[29:40] that you have sold out Lock Stock and
[29:42] Barrel you are tired of the world and
[29:45] sin and unbelief and frustration and
[29:46] doubts and come to the Living God with
[29:49] the anchor surely tightening in the Rock
[29:52] of Ages
[29:53] the holy spirit is here
[29:55] to pull you into the presence of the
[29:59] Living God
[30:00] and that will give you a fate that will
[30:03] overcome anything there is in the world
[30:05] sickness disease and even death itself
[30:15] when I go to pray
[30:18] I will get out in the woods the green
[30:22] Briars you don't have them here do you
[30:24] we have plenty of them back in the East
[30:26] and they scratch you you get over here
[30:28] The Sun Shines down through the trees on
[30:31] you you get on the hillside you're
[30:33] praying like this and there are too many
[30:35] rocks mosquitoes is biting everything
[30:39] when you get to that kind of place just
[30:41] through your arms say hallelujah God
[30:43] you're calling me I'm answering to you
[30:46] something is going to happen that's
[30:47] right because there's a blessing lean
[30:50] deal and Satan is trying to fight you
[30:53] he's an old means spitfoot anyhow you
[30:57] know he's trying his best to keep you
[30:58] from that blessing just stay there till
[31:02] you're pretty true
[31:03] I don't care that the mosquitoes bite
[31:06] whatever takes place just stay with it
[31:10] because Satan will rob you from that if
[31:13] he possibly can
[31:14] and we come to our last quote tonight
[31:17] the last one if
[31:20] you haven't yet received the Holy Spirit
[31:23] listen my precious problem
[31:26] as many times as people talk against it
[31:29] not being today for today
[31:32] the Holy Spirit oh don't you leave this
[31:34] conference room until you receive it
[31:37] you still right with God
[31:39] don't make your way you if you want to
[31:42] receive it see you have got in your mind
[31:44] that you have to see something or some
[31:47] sensation when you go in there to pray
[31:49] and you're just going saying Lord I come
[31:52] into all you have to say is Lord
[31:54] I come to get the Holy Ghost so he's
[31:57] saying do have things in your mind you
[31:59] want some sensation or no don't have
[32:01] that thingama say Lord I come in to get
[32:05] the Holy Ghost and he will take care of
[32:08] the rest of it you just be real sincere
[32:11] break down your all your thoughts you're
[32:14] not going to receive it that break down
[32:16] all your thoughts of of you're not going
[32:19] to receive it remember tonight is the
[32:21] night you're going to receive it see
[32:23] that's just it
[32:25] like it was an old man this one died he
[32:30] couldn't keep saved he would get saved
[32:33] and then after a while you lose
[32:34] something wrong the devil will say you
[32:37] see you never got saved
[32:39] well that went on for a long time and
[32:42] one day he got out in the field and he
[32:46] prayed through again he said now Lord I
[32:49] know you saved me so he said Satan I'm
[32:52] going to do something to you
[32:54] then he went over got him an ax
[32:57] chop him a great big long stub drove it
[33:01] down into the ground and said Sita
[33:03] if anything you ever come to me and tell
[33:07] me I am not safe I'm going to bring you
[33:10] right back and point to this tub right
[33:13] here is where it has happened I am saved
[33:17] from this on let's buy our hands
[33:20] Heavenly Father this is what I I had in
[33:24] my heart a lot to share with your people
[33:26] tonight about praying through not just
[33:28] praying or saying prayer or saying words
[33:31] but pre and true Lord David
[33:35] I pray true when he went to meet Goliath
[33:38] he did not pray up he didn't didn't have
[33:41] to seek the Lord he already prayed
[33:43] through Daniel already prayed through
[33:46] and that's why when they're dropping it
[33:48] in the lines then it could have that
[33:51] atmosphere wrong and the land couldn't
[33:52] eat it when you look back the secret of
[33:55] all these Hues of Faith they actually
[33:58] pray true
[33:59] in their child in their tests there was
[34:03] no getting feed they had feet that is
[34:05] why they could deal with the trial and
[34:07] their tests even Jesus before he hit
[34:11] Calgary he had to hit the gardener gets
[34:13] sending and right in that Garden is
[34:16] where he prayed through father if it's
[34:19] possible let this Compass father if it's
[34:23] possible please let this cup pass three
[34:25] times father
[34:27] if it is possible let's go past
[34:29] nevertheless not my will but the guy
[34:31] will be done and when he closed the gap
[34:35] his subconscious conscience when he
[34:36] closed the gap of his will
[34:39] and God's Will and when he broke through
[34:43] that was the lion of the tribe of Judah
[34:46] revealing he broke through father
[34:48] tonight I pray that the britual
[34:50] anointing will come upon every person on
[34:53] the song of my voice every person in
[34:55] their room the Lord that your spirit
[34:58] would come upon them and Inspire them in
[35:01] this time of prayer in Jesus am I ask it
[35:04] amen and amen there you have it tonight
[35:08] I trust them that this was helpful for
[35:11] you and that you would recognize that
[35:13] God wants you to break through
[35:17] amen so may the Lord bless you as we go
[35:19] down here
