[34:05] certainly appreciate the opportunity
[34:08] from bertie to bring greetings
[34:11] to the audience
[34:13] on your convention team
[34:15] inspiration
[34:17] preparation for
[34:18] battle inviting us
[34:21] to be ready for the hour of battle
[34:25] shayna taught from
[34:27] greatest battle ever fought
[34:30] god's prophet telling us i believe
[34:33] he's been dressing them
[34:35] teaching them
[34:38] and the battlefront is now set
[34:41] getting
[34:42] ready
[34:44] to start
[34:45] according to force peter 5 and 8
[34:49] be sober
[34:51] be vigilant
[34:53] because your adversary the devil as a
[34:55] roaring lion
[34:57] walking about
[34:59] seeking whom
[35:01] he may
[35:02] devour
[35:04] so our enemy
[35:06] a roaring land
[35:09] our enemy
[35:11] is here to destroy
[35:14] and destroy everything in its pathway
[35:19] as god's prophet identify we live in a
[35:22] time
[35:23] where all
[35:25] evil
[35:26] is dumped upon these people
[35:29] all hell is open up
[35:32] the lid has come off of hell
[35:35] so streams of demon power
[35:39] poured upon the people
[35:41] but thanks be to god
[35:43] in the same season all heaven is dumb
[35:46] all hell
[35:48] is dumped upon us
[35:49] all heaven is dumped on us
[35:53] all blessings upon god's people
[35:56] so church
[35:58] friends
[35:59] we are
[36:01] in a battle
[36:04] we fight
[36:06] every day
[36:09] we are in a warfare
[36:12] and this fight
[36:14] is until
[36:16] life is finished
[36:20] hallelujah
[36:21] so as long as we remain on this act
[36:25] amen we are in a battle
[36:28] ephesians 6 11 tell us
[36:31] put on the whole arm of god
[36:35] that he may be able to stand
[36:38] against the wiles of the devil
[36:41] why is the word identifying upon us
[36:45] to put on the old armor of god
[36:48] if you're not going to fight
[36:51] so we are here to fight
[36:55] we fight battles every day
[36:58] we are constantly
[37:01] in a warfare
[37:03] remember church
[37:05] the devil takes his men but never his
[37:08] spirit
[37:10] god takes his man
[37:12] but never his spirit
[37:14] so the spirit's battling right on
[37:19] and this battle
[37:21] is in these over our tabernacles of
[37:24] flesh
[37:26] and the battles carry us straight to the
[37:29] end
[37:31] believers christians tonight there or
[37:33] tonight wherever we are
[37:35] we battle every day
[37:38] we battle winner warfare
[37:42] between right and wrong
[37:44] we battle against sin
[37:47] we are warring against sin we have never
[37:50] been promised
[37:52] a floral bed of ease
[37:56] amen but we have been promised grace
[37:59] sufficient
[38:02] we have been promised grace to overcome
[38:06] we have been promised grace to endure
[38:10] we have been promised grace to sustain
[38:14] so the apostle paul
[38:16] in the scripture speaking to us
[38:20] identifying to us the believer
[38:24] to be prepared for war
[38:28] because you're going to accept that
[38:30] battles and trials
[38:32] accompany
[38:34] life
[38:35] we are in a battle for life
[38:39] but thanks be to god
[38:42] god knows
[38:45] how to equip his people
[38:49] didn't finish god
[38:52] knows
[38:53] what it will take
[38:56] to defeat the enemy
[39:00] naturally
[39:02] we read history
[39:04] and through the years
[39:06] we got to understand
[39:08] there was a season that they fought with
[39:11] bow and arrow
[39:14] they grow
[39:16] in their weaponry
[39:18] the natural military more and more
[39:21] today
[39:22] they have atomic weapons
[39:25] today
[39:26] they have nuclear weapons
[39:30] but thanks be to god
[39:32] god at the beginning
[39:35] he gave his children the best
[39:39] hallelujah
[39:41] unlike the enemy
[39:43] the enemy
[39:45] is what we call a trilogy
[39:48] the enemy is learning on the job
[39:51] but god is not learning on the job he is
[39:54] in finite
[39:56] and the infinite god
[39:59] equips his children
[40:02] with all that is needed
[40:05] from the garden of eden
[40:07] straight to the rapture
[40:09] that's the god we serve god give us the
[40:11] best
[40:13] and he gave us the best
[40:16] even at the very beginning
[40:19] our god never had to change
[40:22] his weaponry here learning more
[40:25] god gave us his word
[40:28] and he would already tell us
[40:30] when the enemy comes into the flood
[40:33] the spirit of the lord
[40:36] raises up
[40:38] a standard
[40:40] against the enemy
[40:41] that is god's weaponry
[40:44] so the script gear tells us
[40:46] put on
[40:48] put it on
[40:50] put on tonight today the whole arm of
[40:53] god
[40:55] we got to know
[40:58] what our armor is
[41:00] to put it on you got to know what it is
[41:03] we got to know what our is
[41:07] our armor is supernatural
[41:12] our armor is an armor of faith
[41:16] our armor has nothing natural in it
[41:20] nothing of the world
[41:23] we look tonight
[41:24] today at the unseen
[41:27] our armor consists of love
[41:31] it consists of
[41:32] joy it consists of peace
[41:36] consists of long suffering
[41:39] it consists of goodness
[41:42] conceive consists of meekness
[41:45] our armor consists of the supernatural
[41:50] so what am i tonight
[41:53] is not natural
[41:56] hallelujah
[41:58] but our armor is a spiritual
[42:02] hidden power
[42:04] our armor is himself
[42:07] glory to god
[42:09] himself
[42:11] in you
[42:13] that's our
[42:14] armor and that will allow we don't cut
[42:17] through
[42:19] any promise
[42:21] that god has made for you
[42:24] our armor
[42:26] the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:29] so if tonight you would deny one word of
[42:32] god you could realize that you don't
[42:35] have an armor
[42:37] obama is the word
[42:40] god's prophet tells us satan trick is to
[42:44] allow you to disbelieve
[42:47] your weapon
[42:50] satan trick is to make you believe
[42:53] that your weapon is equivalent to his
[42:56] or your weapon is not strong enough
[43:00] hallelujah but god has given us a weapon
[43:04] and that weapon is the word of god
[43:08] and our enemy
[43:10] is anything
[43:12] or anyone
[43:14] that reasons against
[43:16] the word of god
[43:18] god's prophet
[43:20] is a message
[43:22] putting on the whole armor of god
[43:25] program 76 tells us
[43:28] that god fortified his army
[43:32] what with
[43:33] himself in the form of prophets
[43:36] apostles
[43:38] teachers pastors
[43:40] what did he do
[43:42] what was god doing
[43:44] listen
[43:46] did you ever think
[43:47] what that offices of the church is is
[43:50] god's dress
[43:52] inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer
[43:55] foresee before satan ever get to it
[43:59] don't told it what is it
[44:02] is god dressed up in his church
[44:05] these offices
[44:07] is god's dressway
[44:09] and when you see those offices pastors
[44:12] teachers evangelists
[44:14] what is that that is god's dress where
[44:16] god's presence god's spirit
[44:20] walking through man
[44:23] and if that office
[44:25] could understand who the enemy is
[44:26] tonight
[44:28] if that office deny any of his word
[44:31] then it's not god's dressing
[44:34] know that
[44:35] that's a wolf in sheep glory
[44:39] watch that fellow
[44:41] beware of him
[44:43] hallelujah
[44:45] amen
[44:46] so we want to watch that fellow
[44:49] beware of him
[44:51] so in the thoughts
[44:55] from god's
[44:56] the greatest battle ever fought
[44:59] i believe he's dressing them
[45:02] he's training them
[45:05] so we are not only dressed
[45:07] for war
[45:09] the believer is trained
[45:12] for fighting
[45:15] and if you want to use
[45:17] the terminology of a soldier
[45:20] a soldier training is rugged
[45:24] amen
[45:25] got to be careful
[45:27] an untrained soldier
[45:30] an untrained soldier will cause
[45:33] destruction
[45:35] to others
[45:37] so soldier got to be trained for
[45:39] fighting
[45:41] as a recruit you may find the training
[45:43] is tough
[45:44] but when you go to the warfare you got
[45:47] to believe recognize it was good for you
[45:50] so thank god for rugged training
[45:53] god's prophetic give us you could search
[45:55] it to give us his experience
[45:57] with six second spit
[45:59] so you've got to thank god for
[46:01] ruggedness
[46:02] thank god for rugged treat training
[46:05] thank god for rugged god spell preaching
[46:09] hallelujah
[46:10] at the end of the road you will
[46:12] appreciate it we pray god will richly
[46:15] bless your meeting
[46:17] will richly bless the speakers ahead
[46:21] amen
[46:22] that will bring forth
[46:25] soldiers
[46:27] warring soldiers not those that you
[46:29] ought to beg and post your head
[46:32] no that's not
[46:33] army language not those who are to be
[46:35] better than babies
[46:36] that is illegitimate children that's a
[46:39] cheap reproduction
[46:41] but rugged training

[51:44] what a day what a beautiful
[51:47] uh atmosphere that we feel in the house
[51:49] of the living god this morning
[51:52] amen
[51:53] i want to take this opportunity to to
[51:56] greet uh brother theo ovitt and then the
[51:59] entire
[52:00] team down in
[52:02] trinidad who has made this convention
[52:06] possible
[52:07] we realize that anyone can have a vision
[52:10] and have a desire to have a convention
[52:13] be it uh
[52:15] live and we have had these virtual
[52:17] conventions which has made it quite
[52:19] frankly a little more challenging
[52:22] because there's different time zones and
[52:24] different uh
[52:25] uh
[52:26] brother ovitz sent a beautiful beautiful
[52:30] trailer of the actual
[52:32] uh convention which i was very blessed
[52:35] and i believe the hour of charge is here
[52:39] amen we wrestle not against flesh and
[52:41] blood but we wrestle against uh
[52:46] spiritual powers
[52:48] amen in high places
[52:50] praise god and we realize that that uh
[52:54] they're they're everywhere you see and
[52:57] remember a spirit
[52:59] cannot do anything to us unless it has a
[53:02] body to work through
[53:04] so this is why i want to make sure this
[53:07] morning
[53:08] cautiously to make sure that we do hate
[53:11] the sin
[53:12] but not the flesh because it has to use
[53:16] a fl a body amen and many of them by the
[53:20] grace of god um i i will say this
[53:24] many people who have their own opinions
[53:26] their own ideas my uh
[53:29] my absolute is this word i just want to
[53:32] give you
[53:33] my testimony
[53:34] my absolute is this message
[53:38] and this is where you can
[53:40] get me on common ground
[53:42] amen if we're speaking uh the bible
[53:45] we're speaking this message this end
[53:47] time message then i will amend you
[53:50] praise god from the beginning of your
[53:53] message to the end amen
[53:55] but if there's a thinking man's filter
[53:58] in every one of our hearts
[54:00] which god
[54:01] has predestinated to put in the hearts
[54:05] of the people amen what is that that's
[54:08] the holy
[54:09] the spirit of truth
[54:11] that will not ever mislead you
[54:14] amen to any uh falsehood so we are
[54:18] grateful and i am privileged
[54:21] to be identified with these god-called
[54:23] men
[54:24] we realize that god cannot
[54:26] send a revival
[54:28] unless he has men to pack it out
[54:32] once again god uses man
[54:35] once again
[54:36] like god uses man the devil will use his
[54:40] man
[54:40] so therefore it has gotten to the end
[54:44] where uh let the god
[54:47] that answers by fire
[54:49] let him be god amen amen so we realize
[54:52] the showdown is on the dynamics will
[54:55] prove
[54:57] what is right and what is wrong
[54:59] amen so we could teach we could sow
[55:02] seeds we could uh preach so we're blue
[55:06] in the face unless that seed that we are
[55:08] sowing comes to life in the hearts of
[55:11] the people and become material the word
[55:14] made flesh and only the dynamics can
[55:18] come and rest upon that seed to make it
[55:21] live
[55:22] amen outside of that we're just fussing
[55:25] and arguing over scriptures and things
[55:27] so lord this is my prayer this morning
[55:29] lord send the dynamics to the church
[55:32] amen then shall raise up
[55:35] uh
[55:36] like a great mighty army praise god
[55:40] hallelujah it'll shake the whole world
[55:43] it'll shake new york city it'll shake
[55:46] trinidad it'll shake south africa it'll
[55:49] shake amen all over the world
[55:52] amen it wouldn't be something that you
[55:54] hear it'll be the seven thunders
[55:57] are being made manifest
[56:00] hey amen we can preach seven thunders we
[56:02] can preach revival but unless they are
[56:05] being made manifest
[56:07] that is the attraction that's going to
[56:09] bring people in
[56:10] not the teaching of the word
[56:13] but the dynamics of the word hallelujah
[56:16] to the lamb praise be to god so
[56:18] greetings to all these fine men i'm i'm
[56:22] very happy and blessed to be associated
[56:25] with these uh god-called men from
[56:28] nigeria ivory coast
[56:30] amen ghana england trinidad south africa
[56:33] you name it and it doesn't end there
[56:36] amen uh every
[56:38] country
[56:40] under the sun has a representative amen
[56:43] i believe that
[56:44] god has his people everywhere so may the
[56:48] lord richly bless you as we get into our
[56:51] little message i don't want to keep you
[56:53] long amen i realize we are being uh
[56:58] uh
[56:58] timed and i just don't want to keep uh
[57:02] the convention
[57:03] uh long but we are here in new york city
[57:06] we're still alive and well amen amen
[57:11] our ship is still float
[57:13] floating although our ship was supposed
[57:16] to sink long ago
[57:18] by the grace of all mighty god he has
[57:20] given us amen the strength and the power
[57:23] and the whatever it takes to keep us
[57:26] moving on you know in in the believer
[57:29] there is no quitting
[57:31] amen in the church of the living god
[57:33] there is no quit
[57:34] there is no i give up praise god and i
[57:37] don't care if i have 10 15 whatever it
[57:40] may be five that won't give up god will
[57:44] use those five to turn new york city
[57:47] upside down
[57:48] praise god that's the real believer
[57:51] that god is looking for so let us turn
[57:54] to ephesians chapter six and without any
[57:57] further delay ephesians chapter six and
[58:00] i love this uh verse this chapter
[58:03] rather because this is our season our
[58:06] time
[58:07] amen so we could understand and
[58:10] ephesians places the believer
[58:13] we all know uh
[58:15] in the promised land
[58:17] and uh positionally placed us we'll
[58:19] start with ephesians chapter
[58:22] 6
[58:24] and we will read from verse

[58:39] 17th verse

[58:44] starting from verse 10
[58:48] finally my brethren be strong in the
[58:51] lord
[58:53] and in the power of his might
[58:56] we can only be strong
[58:58] in the power of his might
[59:01] hallelujah to the lamb
[59:03] amen you can say oh i'm strong but if
[59:05] you don't have the power of his might
[59:07] amen we're just saying things he put on
[59:10] the whole armor of god that he may be
[59:13] able to stand against the wiles of the
[59:17] devil

[59:22] ministers pastors deacons whatever we
[59:25] wrestle not against that the flesh part
[59:28] see
[59:29] flesh and blood but against
[59:31] principalities
[59:33] against powers against the rulers of
[59:36] darkness of this world against spiritual
[59:39] wickedness in high places
[59:42] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[59:45] of god
[59:46] amen that he may be able to withstand
[59:49] the evil day how many know we are in the
[59:52] evil day

[59:57] therefore having your loins gird about
[59:59] with truth
[1:00:01] amen and having the breast plate of
[1:00:04] righteousness

[1:00:10] although they're called you know be
[1:00:13] uh
[1:00:14] you know clothed with this great
[1:00:16] mighty armory
[1:00:18] not a one of these are physical you know
[1:00:21] how the breastplate of righteousness
[1:00:25] amen that can only be a spiritual
[1:00:28] breastplate
[1:00:30] amen having your loins guard about with
[1:00:34] truth that could only be a spiritual
[1:00:37] amen uh
[1:00:39] a protection and your feet shod with the
[1:00:42] preparation of the gospel of peace above
[1:00:46] all having the shield of faith wherewith

[1:00:52] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:00:56] amen and take the helmet of salvation
[1:00:59] and the sword of the spirit you can't
[1:01:03] see a spirit so it has to be a spiritual
[1:01:05] sword that we're talking about see uh
[1:01:08] which is what the word of the lord and
[1:01:12] the word is sharper
[1:01:14] than a two-edged sword
[1:01:16] amen may the lord add a blessing to the
[1:01:19] reading of his word let's turn now to
[1:01:21] revelations chapter 12
[1:01:24] and we will start from the seventh verse
[1:01:28] revelations chapter 12
[1:01:31] because i i want to show you something
[1:01:33] here
[1:01:33] god willing
[1:01:35] to show you
[1:01:36] that you know this battle and this
[1:01:39] conflict that we are speaking on this
[1:01:41] morning
[1:01:43] uh did not start
[1:01:46] just a few days ago
[1:01:49] this
[1:01:50] uh
[1:01:51] battle started
[1:01:53] before there was a
[1:01:55] world
[1:01:57] or should i say before we had any
[1:02:00] conscience of any of this
[1:02:02] see there was a battle a war in heaven
[1:02:06] the war started in heaven
[1:02:09] and if i may say so the war is no longer
[1:02:13] in heaven
[1:02:15] because these angels that oppose god
[1:02:19] and resisted god were cast down
[1:02:22] to earth
[1:02:25] and
[1:02:26] they
[1:02:27] these spirits that were cast down
[1:02:31] they could do nothing unless they find
[1:02:33] bodies
[1:02:35] and their continue their evil work
[1:02:38] through
[1:02:39] humanity
[1:02:41] so
[1:02:43] i want you to get that clear that way we
[1:02:45] understand
[1:02:47] and there was
[1:02:48] war in heaven
[1:02:50] michael and his angels fought against
[1:02:52] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:02:55] angels and prevailed not of course he'll
[1:02:58] never prevail against what is right
[1:03:01] against the word itself neither was
[1:03:03] their place found anymore in heaven this
[1:03:07] is why i say
[1:03:08] you're not going to find their place in
[1:03:10] heaven because they late they left their
[1:03:13] first estate
[1:03:14] amen and they fell down on the earth and
[1:03:18] this is where you see
[1:03:20] and read in genesis the first murder the
[1:03:23] first rape the first uh anything
[1:03:26] the first
[1:03:28] evil act
[1:03:30] took place on earth
[1:03:32] in genesis
[1:03:34] amen hallelujah so
[1:03:37] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:03:40] place found anymore in
[1:03:43] heaven see
[1:03:44] and the great dragon was cast out the
[1:03:48] old serpent called the devil well who is
[1:03:52] the old serpent that's the same one that
[1:03:53] spoke to eve amen amen
[1:03:56] he had a he had a message
[1:03:59] that was so close
[1:04:01] what was his message 99 and nine tenths
[1:04:05] truth
[1:04:06] but he was fallen because he left one
[1:04:09] percent
[1:04:10] out it has to be the word that old
[1:04:13] serpent called the devil and satan which
[1:04:16] deceiveth the word the whole world
[1:04:20] he was cast out
[1:04:21] into the earth and his angels were cast
[1:04:25] out with him
[1:04:27] may the lord had a blessing to the
[1:04:28] reading of his word let us have a word
[1:04:31] of prayer father we have read your word
[1:04:34] lord surely
[1:04:35] heaven and earth will pass away but your
[1:04:38] word will never pass away now we are
[1:04:41] reading from scriptures lord from
[1:04:44] way back in the beginning and we go to
[1:04:47] the end of the uh the book of the bible
[1:04:50] in revelations we can see
[1:04:52] how
[1:04:53] lord the battle started way back amen in
[1:04:57] heaven and satan trying to exhort
[1:05:00] himself above all that was righteous
[1:05:03] lord he wanted to create a kingdom that
[1:05:06] was higher and better than lord almighty
[1:05:10] god but we realize that that was not the
[1:05:13] plan of god because there's only one
[1:05:14] king of kings lord of lords amen and
[1:05:18] every man must stay in his place every
[1:05:21] angel must stay in their places in order
[1:05:24] for the universe and everything else to
[1:05:27] work in perfect harmony every star has a
[1:05:30] place every moon whatever it may be
[1:05:34] every son of god has a place and when we
[1:05:37] stay in our places positionally placed
[1:05:40] dear god then the uh body of the lord
[1:05:42] can work in perfect harmony father oh
[1:05:46] lord under the unction and this leading
[1:05:49] of the holy spirit so father i pray that
[1:05:51] you would bless these few words bless it
[1:05:53] to the convention and all those that
[1:05:55] would hear it father uh lord we ask that
[1:05:58] you would heal those among us that are
[1:06:01] in need of a touch heal
[1:06:04] the sick raise the dead lord deliver the
[1:06:08] captive
[1:06:09] father god i pray that you would do the
[1:06:11] things that you promised to do in this
[1:06:13] last days father for we believe dear god
[1:06:17] we don't doubt your word your word is
[1:06:19] the same yesterday today and forever we
[1:06:22] ask it in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:06:25] amen god bless you you may be seated
[1:06:28] praise be to god let's give him praise
[1:06:36] hallelujah amen we have a church here on
[1:06:38] fire amen amen hallelujah and this is
[1:06:42] why we have the in case it burns down we
[1:06:44] have the fire extinguishers ready to go
[1:06:48] amen i love you know i love to preach to
[1:06:51] a church that knows
[1:06:53] what
[1:06:54] they are listening to
[1:06:56] amen and when the word that goes forth
[1:07:00] is truth
[1:07:01] there
[1:07:02] it is impossible for the believer to sit
[1:07:05] there without giving a response
[1:07:08] because you see the word goes forth and
[1:07:11] the seed in the believer's heart has got
[1:07:13] to respond with an amen
[1:07:16] amen because there's a certain sound
[1:07:18] nothing uncertain about amen the pure
[1:07:21] word of god
[1:07:23] so now as we have uh
[1:07:26] come
[1:07:27] to this uh convention
[1:07:30] message
[1:07:31] i titled my message it's kind of a long
[1:07:35] title but
[1:07:36] you can shorten it any way you want
[1:07:38] the final battle
[1:07:40] now this is a final battle
[1:07:43] the final battle is not in heaven
[1:07:46] that started
[1:07:47] the whole uh
[1:07:49] fall of humanity that started the fall
[1:07:52] of angels
[1:07:53] we see the final battle against
[1:07:56] principalities
[1:07:58] powers
[1:07:59] rulers of darkness
[1:08:01] spiritual wickedness
[1:08:03] in high places
[1:08:06] and that pretty much covers the entire
[1:08:09] verse
[1:08:11] but i wanted to make sure that we
[1:08:13] understood that this is
[1:08:16] the final battle
[1:08:18] the final battle is a spiritual battle
[1:08:23] we have natural battles and carnal
[1:08:26] battles where people fight each other
[1:08:29] and we're going nowhere doing that where
[1:08:32] we're fighting one another
[1:08:34] what we have to truly focus in is
[1:08:38] fighting
[1:08:40] against what is wrong
[1:08:43] and what is uh you know an uncertain
[1:08:45] sound
[1:08:47] so we realize that uh some
[1:08:50] uh preachers that are out there today
[1:08:53] they minister according to their level
[1:08:55] of faith and they have a certain idea
[1:08:58] of
[1:09:00] what the
[1:09:01] prophet meant by
[1:09:03] uh when he said this and that the other
[1:09:06] so
[1:09:07] their measure of faith said well he
[1:09:09] meant this
[1:09:10] another one will have a different
[1:09:12] measure of faith and said well he meant
[1:09:14] this
[1:09:15] but surely somewhere in between there
[1:09:17] there's got to be the truth
[1:09:19] amen so god is not interested in your
[1:09:22] opinion
[1:09:24] of what he said
[1:09:26] god is not interested in the other one's
[1:09:27] opinion of what he said because he he
[1:09:31] will only
[1:09:32] vindicate the word
[1:09:35] of what he said
[1:09:37] amen because the word must be vindicated
[1:09:40] no matter how small the word may be
[1:09:44] there is a spirit and anointing that's
[1:09:46] following that word to vindicate that
[1:09:48] word amen as god's word hallelujah is
[1:09:52] not the words of man it's god's word
[1:09:54] being vindicated
[1:09:55] amen and what is the interpretation of
[1:09:58] the word today the manifestation will be
[1:10:01] the interpretation
[1:10:03] hallelujah
[1:10:04] amen so i don't have to make anything up
[1:10:07] amen when the holy spirit the spirit of
[1:10:09] truth the dynamic strikes the church of
[1:10:12] the living god you will see the things
[1:10:14] that was once predicted they meant to
[1:10:17] happen will happen automatically because
[1:10:20] it won't be you it won't you it won't be
[1:10:23] you working up the people it will be the
[1:10:25] holy spirit amen anointing the dynamics
[1:10:29] anointing the seed bringing that seed to
[1:10:31] pass
[1:10:32] hallelujah to the lamb
[1:10:34] we don't have to force anything
[1:10:36] amen god will never forget his word
[1:10:39] hallelujah and right now this morning
[1:10:42] let me encourage you there are people
[1:10:44] that are filled with the holy ghost
[1:10:45] there are people that are waiting on
[1:10:47] healings there are people that are
[1:10:48] waiting for a good old-fashioned holy
[1:10:50] ghost experience right now god is
[1:10:53] monitoring and looking after that word
[1:10:56] oh i don't care where you go
[1:10:59] i don't care you can hide but the word
[1:11:02] will follow that amen the spirit will
[1:11:04] follow that word
[1:11:06] and make it come to pass
[1:11:08] praise be to god
[1:11:10] for the spirit always follows the word
[1:11:13] amen amen
[1:11:15] that's how he proves his word to be true
[1:11:18] praise be to god amen but my you know
[1:11:22] then you have people that want to force
[1:11:24] some form of vindication and they tried
[1:11:27] to make some kind of uh artificial
[1:11:30] vindication
[1:11:32] but listen what brother branham brother
[1:11:34] brown said
[1:11:35] we now have
[1:11:37] the perfect
[1:11:38] interpretation
[1:11:40] of the word
[1:11:43] with what
[1:11:45] divine
[1:11:46] vindication
[1:11:47] amen divine is from above
[1:11:51] it's not because the bishop uh confirmed
[1:11:54] it
[1:11:55] it's not because the pastor agrees with
[1:11:57] it
[1:11:58] is divinely vindicated by an angel
[1:12:03] amen to be truth thus saith the lord
[1:12:07] amen which means there's no more
[1:12:09] argument about that
[1:12:11] when the word is vindicated praise god
[1:12:15] amen i was listening to a program on
[1:12:20] youtube this weekend there was a
[1:12:22] gentleman i'm not too sure if i i ever
[1:12:25] heard of him he seemed to be like a
[1:12:26] southern pentecostal person he he was
[1:12:29] telling
[1:12:30] uh his testimony was do not
[1:12:34] say anything
[1:12:36] against brother branham
[1:12:39] he said his he said don't tell me
[1:12:41] anything about uh against brother
[1:12:43] branham even though he come out of
[1:12:44] pentecost
[1:12:46] his dad when he first uh saw brother
[1:12:49] branham in one of the meetings in
[1:12:51] florida
[1:12:52] amen he was dying of cancer
[1:12:55] and he was a young man 30 something
[1:12:57] years old i mean his dad and and this
[1:13:00] boy who was giving this testimony now
[1:13:02] he's a grown man he said
[1:13:05] brother branham
[1:13:07] prayed for his daddy
[1:13:10] at 30 years old the doctors had already
[1:13:13] given him up
[1:13:15] that he said my daddy lived to be 93
[1:13:18] years old
[1:13:21] not only that but he told my daddy where
[1:13:23] he lived
[1:13:25] not only that but he told them where he
[1:13:27] come from and what he does for a living
[1:13:30] praise god he said that can only be god
[1:13:34] for the word of god is sharper than a
[1:13:37] two-edged sword it discerns the thoughts
[1:13:41] of the heart
[1:13:42] amen have you noticed have you noticed
[1:13:46] amen all of these uh false anointed
[1:13:50] evangelists they you see it all over
[1:13:53] spread around
[1:13:54] amen they have all these oh oh this one
[1:13:57] was healed some are are put up on the
[1:14:00] platform to to make an act or act like
[1:14:02] you were healed
[1:14:03] amen and you know what it's a strange
[1:14:06] thing because
[1:14:08] faith you ever heard the of the old uh
[1:14:11] pentecostal
[1:14:13] evangelistic school
[1:14:15] win
[1:14:16] the loss
[1:14:18] at any cost
[1:14:20] which means essentially it doesn't
[1:14:21] matter if you have to lie
[1:14:23] it doesn't have to it doesn't mean if
[1:14:25] you it doesn't matter if you have to
[1:14:28] make something up
[1:14:30] if somebody
[1:14:32] gets saved
[1:14:33] you won the lost
[1:14:36] that was their
[1:14:38] uh model and they
[1:14:40] boldly use it many times
[1:14:43] but you don't see them
[1:14:46] because brother brown said this gift
[1:14:49] that god gave
[1:14:53] cannot be impersonated
[1:14:56] you'll never see it
[1:14:59] until i'm gone
[1:15:02] i'm glad he said until he's gone
[1:15:05] you know why
[1:15:06] you'll see it again
[1:15:08] but it'll be in the bride
[1:15:10] no other person
[1:15:12] in the bride
[1:15:14] because the same word will be veiled in
[1:15:16] that bride
[1:15:18] to expose amen and to read the very
[1:15:21] hearts of didn't peter say the same why
[1:15:24] did you lie to the holy ghost
[1:15:26] amen that was a spirit coming down upon
[1:15:28] peter but now let's move on
[1:15:31] he said uh
[1:15:33] this man
[1:15:35] told my daddy where he's from
[1:15:38] where uh
[1:15:41] uh
[1:15:42] he was going to get healed
[1:15:44] and he waited and you know the lord will
[1:15:46] always test you
[1:15:49] because you're not going to feel well
[1:15:51] right away
[1:15:54] in fact many times you feel worse
[1:15:58] to see if you really believe
[1:16:01] huh
[1:16:02] this is why you have to cast down
[1:16:05] let the weak say
[1:16:08] that i am strong
[1:16:10] so this man by the grace of almighty god
[1:16:13] he's given his testimony and he said you
[1:16:15] know
[1:16:16] what is a shame is that his church
[1:16:19] did not
[1:16:20] permit
[1:16:22] his members the members that he belonged
[1:16:25] to
[1:16:26] to attend that meeting
[1:16:28] are you kidding me he said his daddy was
[1:16:30] sick
[1:16:32] you can't listen
[1:16:34] let me just say this
[1:16:36] you wait to the anointing
[1:16:39] strikes the church
[1:16:41] and you see you signs wonders and
[1:16:44] miracles
[1:16:45] and you have a bunch of false anointings
[1:16:47] that don't join that group
[1:16:49] because they're they're crazy
[1:16:51] amen and you have a need
[1:16:54] and you have a need
[1:16:57] ain't nobody gonna be able to keep
[1:16:59] people in any barnard church
[1:17:02] hallelujah
[1:17:04] amen if you're an eagle you begin to
[1:17:06] spread your wings amen and begin to fly
[1:17:10] away
[1:17:11] you realize that you're not a chicken
[1:17:13] anymore praise god you changed
[1:17:17] your language amen you are an eagle you
[1:17:20] were meant to fly
[1:17:22] brother you'll see
[1:17:23] there's coming a deliverance
[1:17:26] that's what we're talking about now
[1:17:28] amen the greatest battle ever fought
[1:17:31] amen not against flesh and blood but god
[1:17:33] himself is coming to vindicate his word
[1:17:37] what is right let god let the god that
[1:17:40] answers by fire let him be the god
[1:17:44] so the battle started in heaven so how
[1:17:46] many knows that we're not talking about
[1:17:48] oh yes about my the battle in heaven
[1:17:50] we're talking about
[1:17:53] fallen angels
[1:17:55] now
[1:17:56] they're close they're closer
[1:18:02] they are now your boogie man
[1:18:05] they're now
[1:18:07] they're very close to
[1:18:10] try to make you doubt the word
[1:18:14] because physically they cannot do
[1:18:16] anything unless god permits it
[1:18:19] and if you ever fall into a trap where
[1:18:22] you believe
[1:18:24] didn't we hear the tape on sunday
[1:18:26] the sin
[1:18:28] of what unbelief
[1:18:31] people do things wrong because they
[1:18:33] don't believe
[1:18:34] it's not uh you can't blame them for
[1:18:38] drinking and whatever carrying on
[1:18:40] they're not a believer
[1:18:42] but if a person who is a believer
[1:18:45] amen will live the life of christ
[1:18:49] his motive his objective has been
[1:18:52] adjusted to please god and god alone
[1:18:55] amen but now
[1:18:57] let's look at this
[1:18:59] as we have 47 minutes
[1:19:02] left
[1:19:03] amen very quickly
[1:19:05] because how many knows
[1:19:07] that for too long the church has been on
[1:19:09] the defense
[1:19:12] we've never really gone on on the on the
[1:19:14] offense you know
[1:19:17] we've been on a defense and just oh this
[1:19:19] one's saying this and that one's saying
[1:19:20] that and you know what
[1:19:22] i'm going to tell you something it's
[1:19:23] just very much like the church in the
[1:19:24] wilderness
[1:19:26] brother brohm said they had not even met
[1:19:29] the enemy
[1:19:31] they were just fighting among themselves
[1:19:36] in the in the wilderness what enemy did
[1:19:39] they face
[1:19:41] they were busy fighting against the
[1:19:43] prophet
[1:19:44] fighting against aaron fighting against
[1:19:46] everything amen
[1:19:49] they wanted water amen and they made you
[1:19:53] see under and and moses was a man
[1:19:56] see and he was subject to mistakes and
[1:20:00] he struck the rock two times and broke
[1:20:02] the tight and because of that he was not
[1:20:05] permitted to go into the land
[1:20:08] you see this is why
[1:20:10] do not ever be afraid of the
[1:20:13] congregation that you minister to
[1:20:19] look at aaron
[1:20:22] look at aaron
[1:20:25] huh
[1:20:26] moses went up to get the
[1:20:29] the word of god and tablet form
[1:20:32] and all it took for 40 days
[1:20:36] he left the people down in the camp amen
[1:20:40] and aaron was looking after them
[1:20:44] doesn't take people very long to strain
[1:20:49] huh
[1:20:52] but what did aaron say and that really
[1:20:54] kind of surprises me today
[1:20:56] huh
[1:20:58] moses come down you know moses
[1:21:01] was god to the people
[1:21:04] he was angered
[1:21:06] and he come down and he asks aaron
[1:21:09] what have
[1:21:11] you done
[1:21:14] well you see the people
[1:21:16] you see the people
[1:21:18] do you see why i
[1:21:21] do not take
[1:21:22] very
[1:21:23] well
[1:21:25] seriously what people think of me
[1:21:29] because if i do the wrong thing based on
[1:21:31] the people's desire
[1:21:35] it'll get me off the word
[1:21:39] oh the people wanted a god
[1:21:41] and what did you do oh i collected all
[1:21:43] the gold and so forth and i what and an
[1:21:46] image
[1:21:47] a calf
[1:21:49] i wonder i
[1:21:51] aaron should have known better
[1:21:54] he should have known better and here the
[1:21:56] people had gone into abomination and
[1:22:00] all kinds of things and here was the
[1:22:03] word standing on a cliff
[1:22:06] amen and the people had to make a
[1:22:08] decision
[1:22:10] amen listen the people had to make a
[1:22:12] decision it's a free uh will decision
[1:22:17] they could have been worshipping
[1:22:20] that
[1:22:21] beast and everything else but if they
[1:22:23] had repented
[1:22:24] when moses said who is on the lord's
[1:22:27] side step over here
[1:22:30] amen god doesn't care what you did
[1:22:32] yesterday or the day before he wants to
[1:22:34] know what side you're in
[1:22:37] what side you're on
[1:22:39] hallelujah
[1:22:40] who's on the lord's side
[1:22:42] hey amen you're sitting with that false
[1:22:45] interpretation that idea you see the
[1:22:47] abominations that's going on and
[1:22:49] everything else but you can come out of
[1:22:51] there i'm going to ask one more question
[1:22:53] who is on the lord's side
[1:22:56] amen and i could see a handful just a
[1:22:58] move from one place to the other
[1:23:00] amen then that move was their salvation
[1:23:04] hallelujah
[1:23:05] that move was their salvation and when
[1:23:08] you see that something is wrong you run
[1:23:11] for your life amen to what is the word
[1:23:14] and stand on it
[1:23:16] amen and moses wasn't concerned about
[1:23:19] who know no longer who was on the left
[1:23:22] or who was it right that he threw down
[1:23:23] the word of god and what happened the
[1:23:26] word was a divider
[1:23:30] it's separated
[1:23:32] the word will always separate right
[1:23:34] wrong
[1:23:36] and the word is separating it today
[1:23:39] same thing
[1:23:41] hallelujah
[1:23:43] amen this is there's no there's no funny
[1:23:46] business amen you come to the word and
[1:23:49] oh look and live
[1:23:51] my brother live
[1:23:54] look to jesus christ and live
[1:23:57] it's recorded in the word hallelujah
[1:24:02] only that you look and live
[1:24:05] look what look to who not to the pastor
[1:24:08] but to the word
[1:24:10] when a pastor preaches the word of god
[1:24:12] and asks you who's on the lord's side
[1:24:13] either we're going to have a church or
[1:24:15] we're not going to have a church either
[1:24:17] you're going to play games with god amen
[1:24:19] then step on that side but there is a
[1:24:22] word of god that's coming and it's going
[1:24:24] to be uh give you a decision you want to
[1:24:26] play church stay on that side you want
[1:24:29] to be a real bride of jesus christ go on
[1:24:32] the other side
[1:24:33] because the word itself
[1:24:36] will be the divider
[1:24:39] didn't god tell gideon
[1:24:42] take them to the water and i will
[1:24:45] i will
[1:24:47] divide them for you there
[1:24:49] so the pastor is there just to take the
[1:24:52] the people to the water
[1:24:54] which is the word
[1:24:56] amen and then the attitudes then are
[1:24:58] tested based on how they dream
[1:25:03] i i like this scripture but you know
[1:25:06] this one's a little a little hard to
[1:25:09] drink so i'll put that there
[1:25:11] they like all the nice simple
[1:25:14] feel-good scriptures and they
[1:25:16] but then you have these other ones that
[1:25:17] just like lapping everything up
[1:25:21] [Laughter]
[1:25:24] amen the church was getting small
[1:25:27] so i want to ask i want to ask today how
[1:25:30] many are still lapping up everything
[1:25:33] amen what do you believe i believe
[1:25:35] everything
[1:25:37] glory be to god i haven't lost my faith
[1:25:42] praise be to god i believe
[1:25:45] amen god god forbid if i should step
[1:25:48] back and
[1:25:49] and deny my lord and deny this message
[1:25:52] praise god amen brother branham says in
[1:25:56] the in the uh greatest battle ever for
[1:25:58] listen to this the great hour of charge

[1:26:05] defensive
[1:26:06] we haven't we haven't really truly gone
[1:26:08] out and really uh you know uh do some
[1:26:12] harm to the devil see

[1:26:20] faith and doubt is setting you're
[1:26:23] setting yourself in a ray in this
[1:26:25] tabernacle right this morning faith and
[1:26:28] doubt is setting here
[1:26:31] and there's
[1:26:32] that you either have faith or leaning
[1:26:34] towards the faith side or you're leaning
[1:26:36] towards the doubt side
[1:26:38] this morning doubt on one side and faith
[1:26:41] on the other soldiers stand at your post
[1:26:44] of duty
[1:26:46] this is why i say come stand at your
[1:26:48] post of duty
[1:26:50] if there's a revival going on in the
[1:26:52] church this is where your post of duty
[1:26:54] is
[1:26:55] amen hallelujah our captain
[1:26:57] the morning star leads on
[1:26:59] he never goes back
[1:27:02] oh i love that do you realize that
[1:27:05] joshua
[1:27:07] although god vindicated him
[1:27:10] and confirmed him and lifted him up
[1:27:13] before the people
[1:27:15] in the wilderness
[1:27:17] god had a way of
[1:27:19] of making the people respect him
[1:27:23] but yet he had not fought a real enemy
[1:27:26] yet
[1:27:30] because the real enemy was a cross to
[1:27:32] journal
[1:27:35] now joshua was a man of faith
[1:27:37] type of the holy ghost
[1:27:40] we all know that
[1:27:41] but he himself
[1:27:43] listen
[1:27:44] he himself because i want you to
[1:27:46] understand a battle is not yours this
[1:27:49] morning
[1:27:50] the battle is the lord
[1:27:54] he saw the supernatural
[1:27:56] he could only see the supernatural when
[1:28:00] he crossed the jordan
[1:28:02] he saw a man
[1:28:04] dressed in us
[1:28:06] in some
[1:28:07] you know
[1:28:08] army gear
[1:28:10] no doubt helmet of salvation the shield
[1:28:13] of faith and his sword is drawn
[1:28:17] listen
[1:28:18] listen closely
[1:28:19] he saw the supernatural
[1:28:23] and joshua being a spiritual man not
[1:28:26] only a spiritual man but a warrior was
[1:28:28] fearless
[1:28:29] he ran up to him
[1:28:31] and said are you for us are you against
[1:28:33] us
[1:28:34] what a question huh
[1:28:37] i love joshua
[1:28:39] you for us are you against us oh but
[1:28:42] joshua didn't have much to say
[1:28:44] very shortly afterward
[1:28:47] because he recognized the voice
[1:28:52] put away your sword joshua
[1:28:57] you will not have one victory
[1:29:01] in this land
[1:29:03] without me
[1:29:05] because i have come as a captain of the
[1:29:08] lord's host
[1:29:13] oh yes you're leading the people the
[1:29:15] children of israel sure but you better
[1:29:18] follow me
[1:29:19] because i am the pillar of fire i am the
[1:29:22] cloud that was in the wilderness i am
[1:29:25] the water from the rock i am
[1:29:28] amen i am that i am
[1:29:31] i am everything you need
[1:29:33] amen so i want you to understand follow
[1:29:36] the cloud you better follow me i am not
[1:29:38] with you or not against you
[1:29:41] so here is the question
[1:29:43] uh when people ask you
[1:29:45] well what what doctrine you with well
[1:29:47] i'm with jesus
[1:29:50] what what the nominee i'm with jesus
[1:29:54] you know why because
[1:29:55] god
[1:29:56] will never
[1:29:58] truly
[1:29:59] say okay i'm with you
[1:30:02] but i'm not with you i'm with you but
[1:30:04] not with you
[1:30:05] see
[1:30:06] it's it's an individual affair
[1:30:10] and let me tell you how foolish it is
[1:30:14] foolish if i may say foolish
[1:30:20] for us to come down
[1:30:22] in this 2022
[1:30:28] and to go around the world
[1:30:31] or the places that you have been
[1:30:34] privileged to go
[1:30:37] you have not traveled the entire world
[1:30:41] and then you come back to your church
[1:30:45] and say
[1:30:47] there's no other fivefold minister
[1:30:50] unless i
[1:30:52] have met them
[1:30:54] know them
[1:30:56] uh
[1:30:58] you see so that who puts you in the
[1:31:01] place of authority
[1:31:03] to sanction a fivefold minister
[1:31:07] to say he's
[1:31:09] he is
[1:31:11] a pastor he is an evangelist he is a
[1:31:14] teacher in other words god can do
[1:31:17] anything cannot do anything unless he
[1:31:19] comes to you
[1:31:20] only because you haven't seen
[1:31:24] you haven't seen the entire world
[1:31:27] listen i'm going to tell you some god
[1:31:28] has given me the blessing of traveling
[1:31:30] around the world
[1:31:31] and i've been i've been to africa
[1:31:34] i've been to places remote places
[1:31:38] humble
[1:31:39] men of god
[1:31:41] and i'm gonna tell you filled with the
[1:31:42] holy ghost i've never met them before
[1:31:46] but brother they get into preaching
[1:31:49] and they have a testimony their their
[1:31:51] their congregations can can uh you know
[1:31:55] verify everything they have they can't
[1:31:58] point anything in their life
[1:31:59] and they're humble
[1:32:01] and brother they start preaching and
[1:32:03] heaven comes down the sick is healed
[1:32:06] praise god the holy ghost pours out
[1:32:12] and it got me shouting because he he's
[1:32:14] saying things that i agree with
[1:32:17] amen because we cannot ever ever ever
[1:32:20] ever get away from the holy ghost
[1:32:22] experience
[1:32:25] the holy ghost today is received by
[1:32:27] experience
[1:32:30] have you received the holy ghost
[1:32:33] since you've had that experience
[1:32:35] not some intellectual something come to
[1:32:37] the church put your name on the book
[1:32:40] don't even come to the altar that you're
[1:32:42] wasting your time
[1:32:44] listen
[1:32:45] you would be
[1:32:47] you would be blasphemous
[1:32:49] in the early church
[1:32:51] put your teaching and compare it with
[1:32:53] the early church
[1:32:54] when the apostles
[1:32:57] taught everybody
[1:32:59] to repent and to be baptized in the name
[1:33:02] of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:33:04] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:33:07] receive the holy ghost
[1:33:09] by experience
[1:33:11] there's a quote there brother brown said
[1:33:12] the holy ghost is received by experience
[1:33:15] so if the holy ghost if brother
[1:33:17] branham's holy ghost that he is
[1:33:18] referring to is received by experience
[1:33:21] and you must have a different
[1:33:23] holy ghost that's not received by
[1:33:26] experience
[1:33:27] and of course i've heard many of course
[1:33:30] the the quotes oh the holy ghost without
[1:33:32] sensation
[1:33:34] you know that's just there you know
[1:33:36] brother brown knew what he was saying
[1:33:39] because you see then he was saying what
[1:33:41] would you have god doing
[1:33:43] you know because it takes a sensation to
[1:33:46] release an egg and so forth
[1:33:48] but
[1:33:49] these
[1:33:50] people they take these quotes only to
[1:33:54] justify their deadness
[1:34:00] they don't even know when they receive
[1:34:01] the holy ghost
[1:34:06] brother brother joe all goes around all
[1:34:08] the time and what's up happy bourne day
[1:34:12] i don't know why he says that maybe
[1:34:13] that's how he
[1:34:15] how they do it some others will say it
[1:34:17] like that we say happy birthday
[1:34:20] brother if you can't remember your
[1:34:23] birthday
[1:34:25] your natural birthday and your spiritual
[1:34:28] birthday
[1:34:29] something is wrong because your
[1:34:32] spiritual birthday is actually more
[1:34:34] important than your natural one
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:40] god is just my belief
[1:34:44] amen that's just my belief
[1:34:46] amen there's a pentecostal song they
[1:34:48] used to say how many knows the day that
[1:34:50] you got the holy ghost and when i get to
[1:34:52] your day
[1:34:54] amen you get up on your feet
[1:34:56] and you shout amen
[1:34:59] amen if we sang that in the message
[1:35:00] today ain't nobody will stand up they
[1:35:03] would have an idea when they got the
[1:35:05] holy ghost
[1:35:08] oh isn't that a shame
[1:35:14] getting back to
[1:35:15] principalities
[1:35:17] listen no man
[1:35:21] got a revelation from god
[1:35:24] to preach that
[1:35:29] the idea came
[1:35:31] let me just be bold
[1:35:33] the idea came
[1:35:35] and the inspiration came
[1:35:38] from a
[1:35:39] fallen angel
[1:35:46] nothing against the brother
[1:35:49] but against what was uttered by the
[1:35:51] fallen angel
[1:35:55] you're not going to tell me that the
[1:35:56] holy ghost is no longer poured out like
[1:35:58] it used to be
[1:35:59] you come too late you come too late for
[1:36:01] that
[1:36:03] never change
[1:36:05] well that's the problem with brother
[1:36:06] oblater he's so old-fashioned he doesn't
[1:36:08] change
[1:36:11] the word don't change
[1:36:14] the brother brown masses change
[1:36:19] what we need is god called men to bring
[1:36:22] amen the landmark back to the position
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] who
[1:36:29] moved the landmark
[1:36:31] hallelujah the bible says don't you move
[1:36:35] your neighbor's
[1:36:37] and today our landmarks are everywhere
[1:36:40] strewned everywhere they have gone past
[1:36:43] landmarks moved it over there threw it
[1:36:45] into dumpsters and everything else now
[1:36:48] everybody can do anything they want they
[1:36:51] have no restrictions they have no
[1:36:53] they're out of control why because the
[1:36:55] holy ghost doesn't control them
[1:36:57] and if the holy ghost doesn't control
[1:36:59] them
[1:37:01] it has to be another spirit
[1:37:04] well that makes me angry
[1:37:07] well watch your spirit
[1:37:09] see it doesn't make me hangry
[1:37:11] amen i see these things and then i love
[1:37:13] you more
[1:37:15] you see because i have to
[1:37:18] that's my qualification i have to have
[1:37:20] that
[1:37:21] or i can never make it to the other side
[1:37:23] and the only reason i preach this way is
[1:37:25] to to
[1:37:27] get you
[1:37:28] to encourage you to get to the other
[1:37:29] side
[1:37:31] amen see the greatest battle ever fought
[1:37:34] she is going on right in here now yes
[1:37:38] sir between life and death how many know
[1:37:41] that
[1:37:42] so how many expected when you were
[1:37:45] christian everything going to be all
[1:37:46] nice and ducky
[1:37:48] huh
[1:37:50] no you're gonna you're gonna you're on
[1:37:52] the verge of losing your house losing
[1:37:53] your car losing everything else a flood
[1:37:56] the enemy comes in like a flood amen and
[1:37:58] gives you mind battles keeps you up at
[1:38:00] night not wondering wondering where
[1:38:02] you're going to get the latin the next
[1:38:04] dollar to to to live and meanwhile
[1:38:07] amen we are given a type in the bible
[1:38:10] amen does the birds worry about what
[1:38:13] they're going to eat tomorrow no sir
[1:38:16] they take no thought for tomorrow
[1:38:19] glory be to god and if we trust in god
[1:38:23] he will provide for you every single
[1:38:27] he's never he's never failed me yet oh
[1:38:30] yes i've been down
[1:38:32] i've been without
[1:38:33] amen but that's all part of life
[1:38:36] amen we live in a valley we live in the
[1:38:38] mountain but we come down
[1:38:40] but it is in the times of valley where
[1:38:43] oh is when he holds your hands
[1:38:46] and when you cannot walk anymore he
[1:38:48] begins to carry you
[1:38:50] amen because you trust in him
[1:38:53] hallelujah that's the difference
[1:38:55] others will start giving up
[1:38:57] and say this message is incorrect
[1:38:59] amen so between sickness and health
[1:39:02] between faith and doubt amen uh between
[1:39:06] liberty and bondage the battle is on but
[1:39:08] shine your spear soldiers polish up the
[1:39:11] armor amen god is getting his soldiers
[1:39:15] ready
[1:39:16] so if he's getting his soldiers ready
[1:39:19] there's a fight
[1:39:21] in the horizon
[1:39:23] god is anointing his army
[1:39:27] praise be to god
[1:39:28] i have a few minutes left i'm not done
[1:39:31] amen yes sir
[1:39:33] amen
[1:39:36] so
[1:39:37] you see
[1:39:38] i
[1:39:38] i try to be as
[1:39:41] clear as i can
[1:39:44] without
[1:39:46] seeming like i am a know-it-all because
[1:39:49] if anybody needs
[1:39:50] to learn
[1:39:52] amen and to be humble before the lord
[1:39:56] is you and i
[1:39:58] we all need that's the only way we learn
[1:40:01] is to yield ourselves to the holy spirit
[1:40:04] in prayer god shows us something and
[1:40:06] then the whole thing comes together
[1:40:09] and you see it this dot connects with
[1:40:11] that dot this the connection that done
[1:40:15] but
[1:40:16] when you take
[1:40:18] i've said this many times before
[1:40:21] this is a very sensitive
[1:40:24] issue
[1:40:25] subject for me
[1:40:27] when you take the holy ghost
[1:40:30] out of the church
[1:40:32] that church dies
[1:40:39] too bad there's so many demonic blood
[1:40:41] suckers
[1:40:46] when they pull the blood out while
[1:40:48] they're pulling promises out you know
[1:40:51] that don't belong to you
[1:40:53] oh really okay
[1:40:55] then i'll live
[1:40:56] that
[1:40:57] much lower below my privileges
[1:41:01] do you realize that the holy ghost is
[1:41:03] the blood of jesus that keeps the church
[1:41:06] clean
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:10] in the natural you have red blood cells
[1:41:12] you have white they all have they all
[1:41:15] programmed
[1:41:17] to seek out infiltrators
[1:41:19] germs diseases
[1:41:22] amen as soon as something tries to
[1:41:25] infiltrate the body a disease whatever
[1:41:27] it is here goes that blood amen as
[1:41:30] quickly as it can right down to the
[1:41:33] invader
[1:41:35] amen you don't belong here they shall
[1:41:37] cast out devils the blood does that
[1:41:41] cast out uh diseases the blood does that
[1:41:44] praise god is programmed to do that
[1:41:48] praise be to god and the life is in the
[1:41:50] blood
[1:41:51] so without the blood you have no life
[1:41:54] amen hallelujah to the lamb so therefore
[1:41:57] without the blood there is no spirit
[1:42:00] and any religion that doesn't have life
[1:42:03] any religion that doesn't have a blood
[1:42:05] you cannot have that man
[1:42:07] going around
[1:42:09] walking and acting like he's alive and
[1:42:12] has no blood
[1:42:14] that's a spook you know
[1:42:17] you bury that person
[1:42:20] you're bloodless
[1:42:23] and when god gives his blood test his
[1:42:26] dna test and find you have no blood
[1:42:29] you don't you you're no part of me
[1:42:31] because your blood
[1:42:34] must match his blood
[1:42:36] and if you have no blood
[1:42:39] that's the blood test
[1:42:41] when i see the blood
[1:42:43] i'll pass over you
[1:42:45] so therefore i don't understand that
[1:42:47] doctrine and i hope
[1:42:50] that it's not too late
[1:42:53] i'm hoping and praying that it's not too
[1:42:56] late that people
[1:42:57] will
[1:42:59] realize this
[1:43:02] because a deceiving spirit is a very
[1:43:06] evil spirit
[1:43:09] it's a strong delusion
[1:43:11] to believe a lie
[1:43:16] in other words they have perfect faith
[1:43:17] in that delusion
[1:43:20] you can't move them off of that
[1:43:24] it'll take the dynamics
[1:43:27] to prove what is right and wrong
[1:43:30] and this is what we are waiting for
[1:43:32] today friends
[1:43:33] is the dynamics to come upon the
[1:43:36] mechanics amen there are many many
[1:43:39] promises that the prophet prophesied
[1:43:42] amen but yet
[1:43:44] we can only exchange scriptures and
[1:43:47] verses and things you wait to the one
[1:43:49] that that wrote the word manifest that
[1:43:52] word
[1:43:53] vindicate that word
[1:43:55] amen there's nothing else to say
[1:43:58] amen
[1:44:00] of course they'll still hate you if they
[1:44:02] still have an evil spirit
[1:44:05] because jesus was the word made manifest
[1:44:07] and they crucified him
[1:44:10] didn't matter how much he manifested the
[1:44:11] word they crucified him
[1:44:13] because they had religion
[1:44:15] they didn't have the word they had
[1:44:16] religion
[1:44:18] amen and the religion was not compatible
[1:44:21] with the word
[1:44:22] jesus was the word
[1:44:24] and jesus if it's not compatible with
[1:44:27] your religion you will hate the word
[1:44:30] because it shows you up
[1:44:32] even nicki
[1:44:34] nicodemus came by night
[1:44:36] he didn't want anybody to see him you
[1:44:38] know
[1:44:39] and one thing about nicodemus he
[1:44:42] recognized
[1:44:44] he was a great teacher in all of israel
[1:44:46] great teacher he knew
[1:44:48] he knew the law
[1:44:50] he said
[1:44:51] you know
[1:44:53] teacher we know you come from god
[1:44:56] that much he knew
[1:44:58] because no one can do the things that
[1:45:01] you are doing
[1:45:03] unless god be with him
[1:45:10] intellectually he knew
[1:45:12] he came from god
[1:45:17] that's the extent of people's revelation
[1:45:20] in this message
[1:45:22] oh yeah yeah we we have the truth
[1:45:25] prophet came from god
[1:45:27] this minister this pastor whatever comes
[1:45:30] from god okay
[1:45:32] nobody can do what you do unless god be
[1:45:34] with him
[1:45:35] but here comes the other part of the
[1:45:37] teaching
[1:45:39] jesus said unless a man be borned of
[1:45:42] water and spirit
[1:45:45] he will never see the kingdom of god
[1:45:49] then he begins to preach the holy ghost
[1:45:51] and that doctrine
[1:45:54] was a hard saying
[1:45:56] for nicodemus you see how the holy ghost
[1:46:00] the devil will always fight the holy
[1:46:02] ghost
[1:46:04] he recognized nicodemus recognized this
[1:46:07] man came from god
[1:46:10] but when jesus told you need to be born
[1:46:12] again
[1:46:14] oh
[1:46:16] i'm not too sure you come from god
[1:46:17] anymore
[1:46:21] you see how uh
[1:46:23] you can get caught up in a doctrine
[1:46:25] because you're you're involved in a
[1:46:27] church that is secure in a big temple
[1:46:30] and so forth and nicodemus thought to
[1:46:32] himself how on earth can i
[1:46:34] preach this or how can i understand this
[1:46:36] there's no way i can go back to the
[1:46:37] temple and preach this you must be born
[1:46:39] again
[1:46:40] are you kidding me i'll lose my
[1:46:42] pastorship
[1:46:44] i'll lose my congregation
[1:46:46] but if he had done that he would have
[1:46:49] come to eternal life
[1:46:51] see
[1:46:52] this is the heart science
[1:46:54] of the bible
[1:46:56] and this is why i say we fight not
[1:46:59] against flesh and blood yes sir
[1:47:03] the greatest
[1:47:05] battle ever fought
[1:47:07] is right before us today
[1:47:10] and
[1:47:12] you know
[1:47:13] brother branham said
[1:47:16] you have to know your enemy
[1:47:19] and he he said that i'm just gonna
[1:47:21] paraphrase that because i'm running out
[1:47:22] of time and questions and answers
[1:47:25] he said you have to know your enemy he
[1:47:27] said when he was an amateur you know he
[1:47:29] how many know that brother branham was
[1:47:30] an amateur boxer
[1:47:32] uh yeah he knew how he knew how to fight
[1:47:34] and so forth this is why i like that
[1:47:37] photograph that they had taken and and
[1:47:39] uh
[1:47:40] brother billy paul's trying to
[1:47:42] you know
[1:47:44] jab with his dad
[1:47:45] brother branham knew
[1:47:48] but brother braham said that the only
[1:47:50] way you can train for a fight
[1:47:54] is to study the enemy or the person
[1:47:57] you're going to fight next
[1:48:00] and then
[1:48:02] go try to find somebody that fights
[1:48:05] similar
[1:48:07] to the to the opponent you're gonna
[1:48:08] fight
[1:48:10] now this is the training part
[1:48:13] the training part
[1:48:15] is to find somebody similar
[1:48:18] so now you're being trained
[1:48:20] now you're gonna face somebody in a ring
[1:48:22] that has the same style uh just before
[1:48:25] the real fight
[1:48:27] so you have to know your enemy
[1:48:29] so we have studied this enemy
[1:48:32] for
[1:48:33] years and years
[1:48:35] brother branham said you have got to
[1:48:37] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:48:39] tricks
[1:48:41] and the devil believed me he stutters
[1:48:43] you every day
[1:48:46] he stutters you every day
[1:48:49] he knows your weakness
[1:48:51] he knows if you go down this street oh
[1:48:53] you're weak
[1:48:54] hey he he will wait for you at the end
[1:48:56] of the street
[1:48:58] and beat you up
[1:49:01] he knows if you uh do something that
[1:49:04] you're not supposed to do
[1:49:06] in your weakness
[1:49:08] he's not just gonna leave you there he's
[1:49:09] just gonna give you he's gonna work
[1:49:13] work you over that's right
[1:49:15] and you you get off the canvas and you
[1:49:17] wonder whoa
[1:49:19] what what just happened
[1:49:21] because
[1:49:22] your enemy is watching
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:27] he's watching your weakness
[1:49:29] you're watching every move
[1:49:32] the way the enemy studies you you've got
[1:49:34] to study the enemy
[1:49:38] you have to study the enemy
[1:49:40] oh so therefore
[1:49:43] if you go like this you see i'm not
[1:49:45] going into boxing i'm not a boxer but if
[1:49:47] you there are many people who actually
[1:49:49] look back at videos and see a boxer has
[1:49:52] a tendency of leaning this way
[1:49:54] so that
[1:49:56] person who is going to study for that
[1:49:58] fight or rather going to fight that
[1:50:00] boxer next he's going to wait for that
[1:50:03] person to lean this way
[1:50:05] and guess what when he leans that way
[1:50:07] he's ready for the punch
[1:50:10] amen
[1:50:11] he may have listen he may have
[1:50:14] won many fights doing this
[1:50:17] but there's coming a time
[1:50:20] somebody recognize your weakness
[1:50:23] and you get beaten up
[1:50:26] now what are you gonna do stay on on the
[1:50:28] on the canvas
[1:50:31] god has no quitters
[1:50:34] no no no and believe me i've been on a
[1:50:37] canvas many times
[1:50:39] and if you're honest you'll say the same
[1:50:40] thing
[1:50:42] oh yeah on the canvas many times
[1:50:45] but that is the training
[1:50:49] so if if i tell you don't go down this
[1:50:52] road because there's a pothole
[1:50:55] on the end of the street with a big
[1:50:57] spike sticking up you're going to get a
[1:50:59] flat
[1:51:01] now you can choose to listen to me
[1:51:04] or you can yeah you're right
[1:51:07] boom your your tire gets blown out
[1:51:10] don't don't come back to me and say oh
[1:51:13] you never
[1:51:14] you don't know what happened
[1:51:16] i know what happened
[1:51:19] i know exactly what happened
[1:51:22] i told you not to go down down that road
[1:51:24] and you did
[1:51:26] what else you expect
[1:51:27] oh but i got a really bad flat tire i
[1:51:30] told you you would have a bad flat tire
[1:51:33] [Laughter]
[1:51:36] people don't listen
[1:51:39] they don't listen
[1:51:41] they bless god who does he think he is
[1:51:43] telling me this that the other and then
[1:51:44] they have to learn by experience
[1:51:46] oh they learn by experiencing the next
[1:51:49] thing you know
[1:51:51] but
[1:51:52] i am
[1:51:54] going to
[1:51:56] just go to this other quote because i'm
[1:51:57] i'm running out of time god bless you
[1:51:59] brother uh brother ovid the the
[1:52:02] convention down there i trust that
[1:52:04] you're being blessed this is the way i
[1:52:06] minister to our church amen hallelujah i
[1:52:09] want to build them up into faith
[1:52:12] because a fifo ministry is to edify the
[1:52:16] body
[1:52:18] amen and i'm going to tell you something
[1:52:20] is not man appointed is god appointed
[1:52:23] for god has put in the church some
[1:52:26] apostles some teachers some evangelists
[1:52:28] and
[1:52:29] the fivefold ministry has nothing to do
[1:52:32] with man
[1:52:38] listen if a man gives you a gift he can
[1:52:40] take it away
[1:52:42] if god gives you a gift it is there
[1:52:45] forever
[1:52:47] that's the difference
[1:52:49] look at the teachings you hear today
[1:52:52] oh this man was a great evangelist
[1:52:54] he's no longer
[1:52:58] no longer
[1:52:59] how can he not be any longer who took it
[1:53:01] away
[1:53:04] the lord
[1:53:06] has chastened me sore
[1:53:09] but he has not given me unto death amen
[1:53:13] i still have a voice
[1:53:15] and i still have a
[1:53:17] a message to preach
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:19] thus saith the lord this message is thus
[1:53:22] saith the lord
[1:53:24] the devil didn't give it to me and the
[1:53:26] devil can't take it away
[1:53:28] hallelujah to the lamb
[1:53:31] amen i'm going to tell you something my
[1:53:34] boat was
[1:53:35] was to sink long ago
[1:53:37] but is out to sea by the grace of god
[1:53:40] amen hallelujah
[1:53:43] doing my best
[1:53:45] to tell the world that jesus is coming
[1:53:48] telling the world that seven thunders
[1:53:50] give faith seven thunders is a bride's
[1:53:52] revival you want a promise for the
[1:53:54] rapture that is a message
[1:53:57] glory be to god
[1:54:00] i believe that
[1:54:02] i believe that because brother branham
[1:54:04] said that
[1:54:05] and i have to echo that back
[1:54:07] because it's not my words i'm a a true
[1:54:10] fifo ministry can only echo back
[1:54:14] the original word
[1:54:17] now how many remember brother brown i'm
[1:54:20] talking about
[1:54:21] six seconds smith
[1:54:23] do you remember six seconds smith
[1:54:25] we were talking about sparring
[1:54:27] or you know let's stay on the on the
[1:54:29] boxing uh realm here a second
[1:54:32] and then we'll we'll move on to
[1:54:33] something else
[1:54:34] but listen six seconds smith
[1:54:37] who was six seconds smith he too was a
[1:54:39] boxer
[1:54:40] and he said brother brown uh said that
[1:54:43] he would uh
[1:54:45] train with six seconds smith
[1:54:49] but six seconds smith the reason they
[1:54:51] call them six seconds smith
[1:54:53] is that six seconds smith didn't waste
[1:54:56] much time
[1:54:57] in knocking you out
[1:55:00] and i'm going to tell you something
[1:55:02] don't need much time
[1:55:04] to knock somebody out off to work
[1:55:09] so he got into the ring with six seconds
[1:55:11] smith and six second smith was built a
[1:55:13] certain way
[1:55:15] i think brother brahms he's an ugly man
[1:55:17] but he amen but he knew how to fight
[1:55:20] and he punched hard
[1:55:23] amen where brother branham was not
[1:55:25] protected
[1:55:26] he said one time he punched him in the
[1:55:28] stomach he almost like lifted him up off
[1:55:31] his feet aren't up against he's at six
[1:55:35] we're just sparring but you you're gonna
[1:55:37] kill me
[1:55:39] he said don't worry
[1:55:41] i'm doing this for a purpose
[1:55:44] you've got to learn how to take the
[1:55:45] punch
[1:55:48] there's a lot of people who don't know
[1:55:49] how to take the punch
[1:55:51] don't complain about oh god i'm like i'm
[1:55:54] i'm leaving the ring
[1:55:57] you're playing
[1:55:58] unfair listen the devil don't play play
[1:56:02] fair
[1:56:03] he's there to kill you
[1:56:06] with the first shot if possible
[1:56:10] but what we have to learn
[1:56:12] brother bram said is to be able to take
[1:56:14] the punch
[1:56:18] he said you know because the stronger
[1:56:21] and the harder i hit you
[1:56:23] your body goes into a shock and if you
[1:56:25] permit it and just let it uh do what
[1:56:28] it's supposed to do it'll bounce back
[1:56:31] see where we're made
[1:56:34] before the foundation of the world
[1:56:36] to bounce back from every shot the enemy
[1:56:39] has
[1:56:40] amen because greater is he that's in us
[1:56:43] than he that is in the world
[1:56:46] so i'm going to tell you something
[1:56:48] the greatest battle ever for is laying
[1:56:50] before us
[1:56:52] but b
[1:56:53] prepare for some hard shots
[1:56:57] amen and that'll separate the men from
[1:57:00] the boys
[1:57:02] amen the boys and all i can't take this
[1:57:05] no more i'm going to quit
[1:57:07] maybe i'm out of my field i'm not a
[1:57:09] boxer i'm not a son of god you know so
[1:57:14] do you think
[1:57:16] that god called you a christian life is
[1:57:18] not an easy life
[1:57:22] a christian life is not an easy one
[1:57:28] you
[1:57:29] walk out of this church
[1:57:31] and you're gonna fight
[1:57:33] the entire week coming
[1:57:35] and the entire week the next
[1:57:39] but greater is he that's in you
[1:57:42] and god is training you
[1:57:45] to be able to take the shot
[1:57:49] the heart of the shot
[1:57:51] it's not how many times you fall
[1:57:53] it's how many times you get up that's
[1:57:55] right
[1:57:57] as long as you get up the fight is not
[1:57:59] over
[1:58:00] hey man some people some people give a
[1:58:03] person a shot oh yeah he started to
[1:58:05] celebrate
[1:58:06] meanwhile the person got up and he's
[1:58:08] ready to fight again
[1:58:10] hallelujah i've seen so many wonderful
[1:58:13] clips where
[1:58:15] boxers are down for the count they come
[1:58:16] back and knock the other person
[1:58:19] amen reminds me of a true believer
[1:58:23] so therefore
[1:58:28] don't you think
[1:58:31] that in this last days
[1:58:34] when i'm here here's what i'm going to
[1:58:36] say
[1:58:37] and say heart shots
[1:58:40] you know what hurts the most is people
[1:58:41] you know
[1:58:43] huh
[1:58:45] people you less expect
[1:58:49] i thought we were friends
[1:58:52] boy you hurt me
[1:58:54] god's just testing you
[1:59:00] but we're
[1:59:01] we're brothers and sisters
[1:59:03] yes we are but why did you insult me in
[1:59:04] that way
[1:59:05] you know
[1:59:06] you see that's a hard shot
[1:59:09] when your emotions get involved with
[1:59:12] you see but now we have to raise up
[1:59:14] above emotion amen
[1:59:17] because it's not personal
[1:59:20] it's spiritual
[1:59:23] battle
[1:59:24] they say these things remember people
[1:59:26] exchange words because they are anointed
[1:59:29] with evil spirits
[1:59:31] to hurt you
[1:59:34] and let me tell you something
[1:59:36] if the devil knows something hurts you
[1:59:38] enough
[1:59:43] don't expect it to be the last time it
[1:59:45] said to you
[1:59:49] because he knows that hurts you
[1:59:51] and the devil is just so
[1:59:54] evil in that fashion
[1:59:57] until we can grow up
[1:59:59] into a statue
[2:00:01] of the fullness of jesus christ
[2:00:04] getting back now to
[2:00:06] what god wants us to be
[2:00:09] faith virtual knowledge tempers patience
[2:00:11] godliness broly con stature of a perfect
[2:00:14] man
[2:00:15] now
[2:00:16] that message brother brown titled it
[2:00:19] stature of a perfect man
[2:00:22] but there's a great mystery
[2:00:24] in that message
[2:00:27] that man
[2:00:30] brother branham said
[2:00:32] this is the man
[2:00:34] that's going to be
[2:00:36] in that eternal church age at the end of
[2:00:39] the seals
[2:00:41] so therefore their strength in that
[2:00:43] message
[2:00:45] you have to be able to know how to say
[2:00:47] you know i forgive you
[2:00:50] that gives you victory
[2:00:53] the victory when you when people shoot
[2:00:56] you down say i forgive you i still love
[2:00:58] you
[2:00:59] wow
[2:01:00] you just gave the devil a knockout blow
[2:01:03] because i'm going to tell you something
[2:01:05] the devil has no concept of love
[2:01:08] no concept of love
[2:01:16] i mentioned this before
[2:01:18] and as crazy
[2:01:20] as this may sound
[2:01:25] listen to me
[2:01:27] convention trinidad
[2:01:30] i've heard people
[2:01:32] i mean
[2:01:33] this message is more divided than it was
[2:01:35] that it ever has
[2:01:38] and we claim to believe
[2:01:41] the prophet's message
[2:01:46] this bear is repeating
[2:01:49] because this is something i heard
[2:01:52] and it's sad
[2:01:57] there are people i say preachers
[2:02:00] pastors
[2:02:02] the lord has revealed to me
[2:02:05] that we must be
[2:02:07] separated
[2:02:13] no fellowship on this side
[2:02:18] we'll fellowship
[2:02:19] for a thousand years when we get to the
[2:02:21] other side
[2:02:27] does that sound like an uncertain sound
[2:02:29] to you
[2:02:32] there's no talking now
[2:02:35] that and you're going to try to say
[2:02:38] that we'll fellowship for a thousand
[2:02:40] years on the other side
[2:02:43] you better pray you make it to the other
[2:02:45] side
[2:02:48] now this sounds crazy but this was
[2:02:51] verbatim
[2:02:55] i i think a person like that should not
[2:02:57] be behind a pulpit
[2:03:00] a person like that is dangerous
[2:03:04] a person like that is antichrist
[2:03:08] well that's strong words
[2:03:10] you see but if god
[2:03:12] if the devil can separate
[2:03:14] and divide
[2:03:16] the people of god
[2:03:19] that's the strategy called divide and
[2:03:21] conquer
[2:03:22] i have you speak against this one and
[2:03:24] that one against that one this one
[2:03:25] against that one this and something that
[2:03:27] happened without i mean
[2:03:30] you know several years ago and you never
[2:03:31] forget it
[2:03:34] and it's as fresh in your mind as it was
[2:03:37] the day it happened
[2:03:38] um
[2:03:40] they didn't want nothing to do with you
[2:03:42] now they don't want to talk to you or
[2:03:43] fellowship with you or anything
[2:03:46] however
[2:03:48] we'll have plenty of time to talk
[2:03:51] on the other side
[2:03:53] don't you understand that brother
[2:03:55] abraham said
[2:03:56] nothing but perfect love will make it
[2:03:58] there
[2:04:02] and as we age
[2:04:04] i realize i'm getting older myself
[2:04:07] many other
[2:04:09] ministers that i
[2:04:11] associate with and their people of age
[2:04:13] and so forth listen i don't want to
[2:04:16] find myself
[2:04:18] coming down to the end of the road where
[2:04:20] i can where i can't talk to
[2:04:23] everybody and anybody
[2:04:25] i don't have to agree with everybody
[2:04:28] because you see everybody has a measure
[2:04:30] of faith
[2:04:32] you see measure faith measure whatever
[2:04:34] but this is why we have that uh spirit
[2:04:38] of truth
[2:04:39] that will detect what is right and wrong
[2:04:41] but it doesn't it's not
[2:04:43] remember it's a spiritual fight
[2:04:47] it's not against your brother
[2:04:49] it's not against your sister
[2:04:51] see people are anointed because the
[2:04:54] fight is now on the earth
[2:04:57] amen but one thing for sure
[2:04:59] the bride
[2:05:01] is becoming the word
[2:05:04] and the bride
[2:05:06] the womb has already been closed
[2:05:10] it's too late satan
[2:05:12] the word is in the bride
[2:05:15] so therefore there's nothing false
[2:05:18] nothing else can enter into that bride
[2:05:21] it will be rejected because she's
[2:05:24] already impregnated by
[2:05:26] a genuine word see
[2:05:29] hallelujah to the lamb
[2:05:31] praise be to god
[2:05:33] so i thank god for the fivefold ministry
[2:05:37] amen who are the fifo ministry not only
[2:05:40] the ones i know or the ones i can
[2:05:42] remember there are plenty people out
[2:05:45] there that is anointed and perhaps more
[2:05:47] anointed and more qualified than you
[2:05:51] and myself
[2:05:53] praise god i've never heard of them
[2:05:55] whatever but when they come together
[2:05:57] they have got to say the same thing
[2:06:01] amen getting back to paul paul was
[2:06:04] converted he wasn't he didn't wasn't
[2:06:06] converted by any man
[2:06:08] he wasn't ministered by peter or james
[2:06:11] or john whatever hallelujah he met the
[2:06:14] pillar of fire
[2:06:16] and he and this is in the bible for a
[2:06:19] reason
[2:06:20] amen he said i did not go to jerusalem
[2:06:23] to consult with with peter and all the
[2:06:26] disciples up in jerusalem
[2:06:28] in other words he didn't he didn't he
[2:06:30] didn't have to receive their teaching
[2:06:32] that way because god wanted to prove
[2:06:34] something
[2:06:36] amen there's only one spirit of truth
[2:06:38] and paul amen being a learned man
[2:06:42] and god knew that he
[2:06:45] had to be the apostle of that age you
[2:06:48] know why because he not only knew
[2:06:51] the law
[2:06:53] the letter but he came in contact with
[2:06:56] the grace of god so now with his
[2:06:58] understanding of the law
[2:07:00] he could uh also unders uh understand
[2:07:04] that
[2:07:05] jehovah
[2:07:07] of the old
[2:07:09] is jesus of the new hallelujah
[2:07:14] amen he could understand that
[2:07:16] amen he took the law and converted by
[2:07:19] revelation
[2:07:21] amen and put the new testament into
[2:07:23] place
[2:07:25] glory be to god but he said i never i
[2:07:27] never consulted with anyone and brother
[2:07:29] abraham said after a while when they
[2:07:31] finally met eamon paul and the rest of
[2:07:33] the disciples what were they doing they
[2:07:35] were preaching the same thing
[2:07:38] hallelujah and that is the same way that
[2:07:40] the holy ghost works
[2:07:42] amen maybe you may have not visited
[2:07:45] every single country in the world but
[2:07:47] god has his men somewhere
[2:07:50] he doesn't need you to teach them
[2:07:52] he will learn by the spirit of the truth
[2:07:54] praise god the dynamics
[2:07:57] oh hallelujah
[2:07:59] amen praise be to god
[2:08:02] i'm so thankful
[2:08:04] amen i'm so thankful
[2:08:06] the greatest battle ever fought
[2:08:09] amen but i'm going to say this in
[2:08:10] closing
[2:08:11] amen that
[2:08:13] greatest battle over fort we love our
[2:08:16] brothers we love our sisters
[2:08:18] however the devil has
[2:08:20] infiltrated uh
[2:08:22] you know the message
[2:08:25] stay
[2:08:26] with this word amen
[2:08:29] stay with the word
[2:08:30] stay with this message malachi 4 is
[2:08:33] already vindicated
[2:08:34] praise be to god oh you see and one
[2:08:36] thing that really does offend me i'm
[2:08:38] going to tell you something is another
[2:08:39] thing that offends me is that oh yeah
[2:08:42] what the brother brands message is
[2:08:44] old-fashioned
[2:08:46] now we have we have something
[2:08:48] different or new
[2:08:57] let me just let me just say this
[2:09:00] this bible
[2:09:03] this bible
[2:09:05] is version
[2:09:07] amen 1.0 amen
[2:09:11] the first version of it
[2:09:14] it's perfect
[2:09:18] this bible does not need to be upgraded
[2:09:22] what version of upgrade do you have
[2:09:26] two point
[2:09:28] or is it now 666 i don't know
[2:09:34] this version of the bible is what i
[2:09:37] believe
[2:09:40] there is no update
[2:09:43] in this
[2:09:44] gospel no updates
[2:09:48] well bless god you see i was sitting in
[2:09:50] the room and all of a sudden god gave me
[2:09:52] version 3.0
[2:09:55] false
[2:09:57] what you received
[2:09:59] is a virus in your
[2:10:01] computer
[2:10:02] watch it
[2:10:04] you receive a virus
[2:10:07] that actually begin to work in your
[2:10:08] system and change words and do
[2:10:10] everything else and misplace the word of
[2:10:13] god and misquote the word of god and you
[2:10:16] go out and you preaching that uh
[2:10:18] version 6.6 whatever it is
[2:10:22] and then after a while you add it all up
[2:10:24] there is no promises to preach it they
[2:10:26] stripped you off the holy ghost they
[2:10:28] stripped you of the dynamics
[2:10:30] to the mechanics amen they strip you of
[2:10:32] everything
[2:10:35] one last thing god knows
[2:10:37] i am a firm believer of the holy ghost
[2:10:40] by experience
[2:10:41] and here i i will close with this have
[2:10:43] you received the holy ghost since your
[2:10:45] belief
[2:10:47] any message any minister who cannot
[2:10:50] preach that same
[2:10:52] gospel the way it was preached on the
[2:10:55] day of pentecost
[2:10:56] the way it was preached by brother

[2:10:59] uh i feel sorry for you i'm praying for
[2:11:01] you every single day i'm praying for you
[2:11:03] and you pray for me if you think i'm
[2:11:04] wrong

[2:11:07] with praying for one another
[2:11:09] amen that's the word we pray for one
[2:11:10] another but i will say this this is my
[2:11:13] conviction amen we are off the word when
[2:11:15] we get off the holy ghost
[2:11:17] the holy ghost is the is the life in the
[2:11:20] church it will change you from what you
