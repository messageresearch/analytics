[13:14] We believe in the power of God. We

[16:07] Do you believe that this morning? Amen.
[16:11] [Music]
[16:12] Let's stay in the presence.

[16:21] this morning.
[16:24] Not please from brother Mundus.

[16:34] [Applause]
[16:37] from uh brother Leslie Batist thanking
[16:40] God for healing uh from pains in his
[16:42] stomach as a result of kidney stones.
[16:45] Doctor says you need a final ultrasound
[16:47] but thanking God in advance for complete
[16:49] healing. Amen.
[16:54] A note of praise from sister Ingred
[16:56] Williams thanking God for his grace and
[16:58] mercy as I start another year of my life
[17:00] today. Thank you brother and sister oid
[17:03] for your love, guidance and genuine
[17:05] support. My desire is to be humble and
[17:07] more committed, more sold out as God
[17:10] restores my joy, health, and a fervent
[17:13] desire to truly know him and serve him
[17:15] in spirit and in truth. May the Lord
[17:17] bless you.
[17:22] Amen. We do have one prayer request
[17:26] uh for brother Jason and sister Lily's
[17:29] baby who is in Mount Hope. Um the baby
[17:32] was delivered well, but baby is
[17:34] suffering from jaundice. So, we just
[17:35] want to remember uh the mother and the
[17:38] baby in prayer. And if there's any
[17:40] unwritten or unspoken requests this
[17:43] morning, you want to show by raise of
[17:44] hands, we want to take them to the
[17:46] throne of grace this morning.
[17:48] Shall we bow our heads for a word of
[17:50] prayer? Our gracious heavenly father, we
[17:52] are humbled to be in your presence, to
[17:54] feel your August being here, your
[17:56] shikina glory all over the house this
[17:59] morning, Lord, and we know it's the
[18:01] anointing that makes the difference,
[18:03] Father. And once you know it, you'll
[18:04] never be the same. Lord, this morning we
[18:07] come to bring this young baby, Lord,
[18:09] fresh from the presence of God. Lord, we
[18:11] want to bring that baby to you this
[18:13] morning that you would touch in the name
[18:15] of Jesus Christ. And Lord, may the
[18:17] recovery be immediate, Father. May that
[18:20] jaundice disappear and may your Holy
[18:22] Spirit cover that child and Lord bless
[18:24] the mother, Lord, in a special way. And
[18:26] for every Lord hand that was raised. May
[18:28] you touch your people this morning.
[18:30] Father, we are so blessed to be in your
[18:32] presence. We are so happy to be in your
[18:34] house this morning, Lord. As we approach
[18:37] your word this morning, may you bless
[18:38] the reading of your word. May you bless,
[18:41] Lord, the hearing of it. May you take me
[18:43] out of the way and speak to your people,
[18:46] Lord, in a way that has, Lord, not been
[18:48] done before. Use me as your microphone,
[18:51] as an instrument only, Lord, so that
[18:53] only your words can reach your people,
[18:55] Lord. May you bring deliverance to the
[18:57] captives. May you break the chains of
[19:00] the world, Father. Lord, those that are
[19:02] desiring the Holy Ghost, Father, as the
[19:04] message goes forth, may the Holy Ghost
[19:06] pour out in this place, pour out on the
[19:09] internet, pour out where the tape is
[19:11] played, oh God. May you break every
[19:13] chain. May you break every shackle,
[19:16] Lord. May today be a day we will never
[19:18] forget this first of November, Lord, of
[19:21] 2015, Lord. We are in the 11th month of
[19:24] this year, Lord. And Lord, the days are
[19:27] rapidly moving into a new season, Lord.
[19:29] Oh God, we want to be so dedicated. We
[19:32] want to be so consecrated. We want to be
[19:34] so set apart for service. Lord, may you
[19:36] bless each one. Lord, we want to
[19:38] remember Lord our pastor in prayer.
[19:40] Lord, just returned from India. May you
[19:42] give him strength in his body. May you
[19:45] anoint him even now from the crown of
[19:47] his head to the soles of his feet. May
[19:49] you give him a fresh charge. Lord, in
[19:52] the name of Jesus Christ, we commit
[19:54] everyone into your hands in the precious
[19:56] name of Jesus Christ. And the church
[19:58] says, "Amen." You may be seated for a
[20:02] few minutes.
[20:04] Amen. Thank you, musicians. What an
[20:07] anointing. We do have a visitor this
[20:09] morning, uh, Crystal De Gaz. Welcome to
[20:12] the Headstone Tabernacle. Invited by
[20:13] Brother Jason Rajkumar. Happy to have
[20:16] you with us this morning.
[20:19] Amen. Well, what can we say? Amen. Amen.
[20:23] You know, I saw a quotation this week
[20:27] and it really blessed me because I said
[20:30] to my wife, this is my testimony. I saw
[20:33] someone write, I am a bunch of broken
[20:37] pieces held together by the grace of
[20:40] God. And that's my testimony. Is there
[20:43] anybody could identify with that? I'm a
[20:45] bunch of broken pieces only held
[20:48] together by the grace of almighty God. I
[20:52] couldn't keep myself. I couldn't hold
[20:53] myself. I'm and I'm not whole all by
[20:55] myself, but I'm broken pieces. But thank
[20:58] God for the potter. Thank God for the
[21:00] Lord who holds the whole thing together
[21:02] and allows us to be here in the house of
[21:04] God worshiping, praising. So if you see
[21:08] me one day and this piece is not here
[21:09] and this piece is is not here, I can't
[21:11] keep myself together. I'm depending on
[21:13] the Lord to bring the pieces together of
[21:16] my life. And what I love about God is
[21:19] that he as the potter whenever he sees
[21:22] the clay doing stuff that he doesn't
[21:24] like as he's shaping and molding, he
[21:26] likes to break it here and break it here
[21:28] and reshape it here and mold it this way
[21:31] and and take off this piece and take
[21:33] away this friend and take away this
[21:35] opportunity and and do this to it and
[21:37] change this because he has a picture in
[21:39] his mind of what you are supposed to
[21:42] look like. You can't see fully what
[21:44] you're supposed to look like, but he
[21:46] knows what you're supposed to look like.
[21:49] So all God wants is for us to have faith
[21:51] in the finished work that only he can do
[21:54] because he is the author and he is the
[21:56] finisher and he is the potter and we are
[21:59] the clay. The clay cannot tell the
[22:01] potter to do this and to do that. But
[22:03] the potter, he has full authority.
[22:07] Let me say that again. The potter has
[22:09] full authority to do what he wants with
[22:11] the clay. So let God mold this morning.
[22:14] Let him shape this morning. Let him make
[22:17] this morning and let him break this
[22:19] morning. Can the church say amen?
[22:22] Amen. Amen. Amen. So I have a
[22:25] inspiration this morning that I pray
[22:27] will be a blessing to you this morning.
[22:29] So without further hesitation, can we
[22:31] take our Bibles? We're going to read
[22:33] from one portion of scripture, one
[22:37] chapter. Actually, we're going to go to
[22:39] the New Testament to the book of 1
[22:41] Corinthians
[22:43] chapter 13.
[22:46] 1 Corinthians
[22:49] chapter 13
[22:52] to a scripture that many
[22:54] know and many read and but I want to
[22:57] pull something out of there this
[22:59] morning. Focus on something.
[23:04] 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[23:08] and reading from
[23:10] verse one.
[23:12] Though I speak with the tongues of men
[23:15] and of angels and have not charity, I
[23:18] have become a sounding brass or a
[23:20] tinkling symbol. And though I have the
[23:23] gift of prophecy and understand all
[23:26] mysteries and all knowledge, and though
[23:28] I have all faith so that I could move
[23:31] mountains, remove mountains, and have
[23:33] not charity, I am nothing. And though I
[23:36] bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
[23:39] and though I give my body to be burnt,
[23:42] and have not charity, it profitth me
[23:44] nothing. Charity suffereth long and is
[23:48] kind. Charity envieth not. Charity
[23:52] vaunted not itself is not puffed up, dot
[23:56] not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not
[23:58] her own, is not easily provoked,
[24:01] thinkketh no evil, rejoiceth not in
[24:04] iniquity, but rejoiceth in truth,
[24:07] beareth all things, believeth all
[24:10] things, hopeeth all things, endureth all
[24:13] things. Charity never faileth, but
[24:17] whether there be prophecies, they shall
[24:19] fail. Whether there be tongues, they
[24:21] shall cease. Whether there be knowledge,
[24:24] it shall vanish away. For we know in
[24:27] part, and we prophesy in part. But when
[24:30] that which is perfect is come, then that
[24:33] which is in part shall be done away.
[24:36] Amen. When I was a child, I spake as a
[24:39] child. I understood as a child. I
[24:43] thought as a child. But when I became a
[24:46] man, I put away childish things. For now
[24:51] we see through a glass darkly. But then
[24:53] face to face now I know in part. But
[24:57] then shall I know even as also I am
[25:00] known. And now abided faith, hope,
[25:02] charity, these three, but the greatest
[25:04] of these is charity. May the Lord add a
[25:08] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[25:10] may be seated this morning. Amen. I have
[25:14] an unusual title this morning and you're
[25:17] going to have to bear with me, but it's
[25:20] going to come together for my title this
[25:22] morning, putting
[25:25] away
[25:27] childish things. Yes. My subject, sons
[25:31] coming into maturity and my inspiration,
[25:34] born sons, filled sons, placed sons.
[25:40] Hallelujah. My title again,
[25:43] putting away childish things. And we're
[25:48] reading one of the most well-known
[25:50] scriptures in the book of Corinthians.
[25:53] Many times you hear this scripture read
[25:54] in weddings. And for people who have no
[25:57] association with church, Corinthians or
[25:59] 1 Corinthians 13 is a scripture that
[26:01] they're all familiar with. They call it
[26:02] the love chapter and is used for a lot
[26:05] of weddings. But within that context,
[26:07] Paul slips something very powerful in
[26:10] that chapter. Amen. Now, in Acts chapter
[26:13] 18, I believe somewhere in Acts chapter
[26:15] 18, we find out that Paul started the
[26:17] church at Corenth.
[26:19] This is somewhere around 54 57 AD. And
[26:23] then he left and spent approximately 3
[26:26] years in Ephesus.
[26:28] Biblical scholars believe that Paul's
[26:31] first letter to the Corinthians was
[26:33] written while he was at Ephesus.
[26:36] So Paul was not only anointed and
[26:38] inspired and had met the pillar of fire
[26:41] and was hearing from God, but he was now
[26:44] on a mission to deliver a message. And
[26:47] he was writing from a position of
[26:49] authority because he had already had
[26:51] experience moving around to different
[26:53] territories preaching the Lord Jesus
[26:56] Christ, preaching repentance, preaching
[26:58] the Holy Ghost. And he stops at this
[27:00] chapter and he begins to write. Amen.
[27:03] Amen. He's writing to the Corinthians
[27:05] and he's exhaling them something
[27:07] powerful, something profound. And he
[27:09] says, "Though I have this and I have
[27:11] that and I do this and I do that and I
[27:14] don't have charity, I'm nothing." Amen.
[27:16] And he is speaking not just to that time
[27:19] but for all generation that will come
[27:20] after.
[27:22] Do I have faith? Do I prophesy? Do I
[27:24] have knowledge? He say all of that must
[27:26] be measured against a standard that is
[27:29] called charity. In other words, you
[27:31] could have knowledge and don't have
[27:33] charity. You could have faith and don't
[27:34] have charity, but in all thy getting,
[27:37] get charity.
[27:39] But then he begins to go deeper in there
[27:41] and he begins to confront something
[27:42] powerful. He says, "When I was a child,
[27:45] I spake as a child. I understood as a
[27:49] child. I thought as a child, but when I
[27:52] became a man, I put away childish
[27:56] things."
[27:58] Put away childish things. In other
[28:01] words, that putting away of childish
[28:03] things is not the responsibility of the
[28:05] pastor or the elder or the deacon. It is
[28:08] a result of becoming a man. And that
[28:10] causes you to put away childish things.
[28:13] Nobody is supposed to help you put away
[28:16] your childish things. And if Paul could
[28:19] preach this, I could preach this this
[28:21] morning. This is not the kind of gospel
[28:23] people like to hear. I told my wife,
[28:24] this is one of those not this church
[28:26] kind of services because we need to put
[28:29] away the childish things. If we are
[28:31] looking to have a mature church, if we
[28:32] are looking to have a church with
[28:34] individuals that come to maturity, that
[28:36] come to adoption, we can no longer be
[28:39] children, but we need to be mature. We
[28:41] need to be grown. We need to be
[28:43] responsible. We have been Christians for
[28:45] a long time, but we got a lot of babies
[28:47] in the message. We got a lot of children
[28:49] in the church. Can the church say amen?
[28:52] Amen. So, we going somewhere this
[28:54] morning. Don't worry. We're going to get
[28:55] somewhere this morning. You young
[28:56] people, we coming straight to your door
[28:58] this morning. Amen. Fathers, we coming
[29:02] straight to your house this morning.
[29:03] Mothers, we coming straight to the house
[29:05] this morning because there are certain
[29:07] behaviors we supposed to leave when we
[29:09] were children. But now that we profess
[29:11] that we are men and women, we should put
[29:13] away the childish things. You cannot be
[29:16] an adult and acting like a child. You
[29:18] cannot be an adult and talking like a
[29:20] child. You cannot be an adult and living
[29:22] like a child. There are certain things
[29:24] you cannot do anymore because you're
[29:26] supposed to be a man. You're supposed to
[29:28] be a woman of God. And if Paul could
[29:30] bring the church to that and says,
[29:32] "Listen, when that which is perfect has
[29:34] come, he tied perfection. He tied
[29:37] charity with becoming a man. We're
[29:39] becoming a mature son. We're become Oh,
[29:42] I don't think you hear me this morning.
[29:44] I don't think you're with me this
[29:46] morning."
[29:47] Hallelujah. You may be seated. From the
[29:50] message, Israel and the church. Amen.
[29:52] But said, "But we are we were ordained
[29:56] predestinated." You know what
[29:57] predestinate means? The destination of
[30:00] anything was pre-saw by God. Amen. He
[30:03] said that's not skim milk. Notice I
[30:05] believe that's stump. We we better go
[30:07] over there just a minute. Turn over with
[30:10] me to Ephesians the first chapter and
[30:12] read just a little cuz I'm afraid you're
[30:14] missing that. Just thinking I'm saying
[30:17] it. I'm not. Listen closely. We'll get
[30:19] down to the church in a few moments
[30:21] after a bit. Now Paul is speaking
[30:24] addressing Ephesians 1 directly straight
[30:27] to the shoulder to the church. That's
[30:29] what we are doing tonight. That's what
[30:31] we are doing today. This is not for
[30:33] babies. This is for grown-ups. Not for
[30:36] babies. You were predestinated unto
[30:39] adoption. And there ain't no devils in
[30:41] hell to stop it. Who's strong enough to
[30:43] stop it? This is not for babies. This is
[30:46] not for children. We are not here to be
[30:48] good church members. They are good
[30:50] church member babies. But we are talking
[30:53] about coming to maturity. We're talking
[30:55] about taking your position. We are
[30:57] talking about being responsible. And
[30:59] there ain't enough devils to stop it. If
[31:01] you want to remain a baby, I'm not going
[31:03] to stay a baby. When I was a child, I
[31:06] spake as a child. I understood as a
[31:08] child. I fought as a child. But I'm
[31:11] declaring this morning, I'm a son of the
[31:13] king. I'm a man. And I'm putting away
[31:16] the childish things.
[31:20] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You may be
[31:23] seated. The Holy Spirit anointed word is
[31:26] here. He's trying to get his church in
[31:28] order. I'm not trying to get the church
[31:30] in order. The Holy Ghost is pressing
[31:32] upon the church to get in order. He's
[31:35] trying to find some sons and daughters
[31:37] who will catch the vision and leave this
[31:39] world and everything in it. Can the
[31:42] church say amen? He's here today to give
[31:45] you a revelation to drive out your
[31:47] enemies, to drive out your childish
[31:50] things. Yeah, God.
[31:52] Somebody say amen. He's here to drive
[31:55] out the Philistines, men's ideas, men's
[31:58] interpretation, sickness, demon powers.
[32:01] I don't care what it is. He's here to
[32:03] drive them out. Can the church say amen?
[32:06] Uh, you're going to have your portion.
[32:08] You're going to have your inheritance.
[32:10] And no devil is going to stop it. Can
[32:12] the church say amen? Brother Brandon
[32:15] said little babies. He said I got a
[32:17] little one back there talking about his
[32:19] child. They had just learned to walk.
[32:21] He'd boom and fall down, get back up.
[32:23] And he thought he was doing something
[32:25] great. I was that way one day, but now
[32:28] I'm a man and I put away childish
[32:31] things. Now we have got to come to full
[32:33] doctrine. I like good old shouting
[32:36] meetings where we just clap our hands
[32:38] and shout and have a good time. have
[32:40] great powerful services and things.
[32:42] Dance on the bubble as it were. But
[32:44] wait, then when the showdown time come,
[32:47] you don't know where you're standing.
[32:49] Let's get back and find out. So this
[32:51] morning, we getting back to find out
[32:53] where we standing this morning.
[32:56] Are you with me this morning? So we're
[32:59] going to do some Bible study. Proverbs
[33:00] 22:15.
[33:03] Foolishness
[33:04] is bound in the heart of a child. That's
[33:07] right. Amen. But the rod of correction
[33:11] shall drive it far from him. Amen.
[33:15] We're back to the Bible this morning.
[33:18] Young people don't like these kinds of
[33:19] scriptures, but they're there for a
[33:21] purpose. But this is not just for the
[33:23] young people. This is for the child in
[33:25] all of us this morning because
[33:27] foolishness is bound in the heart of a
[33:29] child. A lot of people at 50 said
[33:31] there's a child in me. Well, we're here
[33:33] to deal with that child this morning
[33:35] because God wants mature sons because he
[33:38] wants to give some power and some
[33:39] authority to some sons where the child
[33:42] is no longer a child. But he has grown
[33:44] up. He's mature. He's been through the
[33:47] fire. He's been through the flood. He's
[33:50] been through hell. He's been through
[33:51] high water. He's been through all kind
[33:53] of stuff. But he overcame and he made
[33:56] it. And now he's a man. You may be
[33:58] seated. You see, becoming a man is a
[34:00] process. You don't become a man
[34:02] overnight. You don't become a man over
[34:04] one knit to the next. It takes time to
[34:06] become a man. It takes experiences to
[34:09] become a man. And God will drive you to
[34:12] all kind of experiences because he wants
[34:14] to force character inside of you.
[34:16] Somebody say amen.
[34:20] So foolishness,
[34:22] foolishness is in the heart of a child.
[34:25] That's right. With all the smiling and
[34:27] the laughing and the fun. That's why I
[34:29] tell parents all the time, I'm not a
[34:31] parent yet, but I tell them when you
[34:33] tolerate certain things as a child and
[34:35] find it's funny with your children, if
[34:37] you don't correct them, it's not going
[34:38] to be funny in 10 years, in 20 years, in
[34:41] 30 years, because you got to let them
[34:43] know what's right and what's wrong. So
[34:45] foolishness is bound wrapped up in the
[34:49] heart of a child, but it takes something
[34:51] to drive it away. If there's no rod of
[34:54] correction, it's not going to be driven
[34:56] away. You can talk it out.
[34:59] There's got to be somewhere to drive it.
[35:02] Can the church say amen? You may be
[35:04] seated. We old school this morning, but
[35:07] we going somewhere. Proverbs 29:15.
[35:10] The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a
[35:14] child left to himself bringeth his
[35:17] mother to shame.
[35:22] So God is not in the business of leaving
[35:24] children to themselves.
[35:26] self-discovery and self exploration and
[35:29] that's not what God is about. He says
[35:31] the rod and reproof give wisdom. So when
[35:34] you tell your child the right thing is
[35:36] going to bring a certain response.
[35:38] That's why God when Moses was saying oh
[35:40] gosh we come out here and and the
[35:42] Egyptians behind God smacked him and say
[35:44] why cry unto me speak and move forward.
[35:47] You have seen enough. You're not a baby
[35:48] anymore but it's time to possess what
[35:50] God says is your own. Can the church say
[35:53] amen? Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Back
[35:57] to the Bible this morning. Galatians
[36:00] 4:1. Amen. Now I say that the air, the
[36:04] person who's going to inherit the air,
[36:06] as long as he is a child, differereth
[36:10] nothing from a servant, though he be
[36:13] lord of all.
[36:16] So he is a son of the king. But he's no
[36:19] different from a servant as long as he's
[36:21] a child. Amen. He has the father's name.
[36:24] He lives in the father's house. He has
[36:26] servants around him. But he's just like
[36:28] a servant because he's too young to
[36:30] inherit.
[36:32] Amen.
[36:34] As long as he's a child, he differereth
[36:36] nothing from a servant, though he be
[36:38] lord of all, but is under tutors and
[36:42] governors until the time appointed of
[36:44] the father. Even so we when we were
[36:48] children were in bondage
[36:50] under the elements of the world. So Paul
[36:53] is speaking spiritually now. As
[36:55] children, we were under the bondage of
[36:57] the world. But when the fullness of time
[36:59] was come, God sent forth his son made of
[37:02] a woman, made under the law, to redeem
[37:05] them that were under the law, that we
[37:07] might receive the adoption of sons. Not
[37:10] receive church, not receive a
[37:11] membership, but receive something, which
[37:14] is adoption of sons. Can the church say
[37:16] amen? Amen. Hallelujah.
[37:20] Hopefully this gets a to settle down
[37:23] some people this morning. Hallelujah.
[37:24] Ephesians 4:11. And he gave some
[37:27] apostles
[37:29] and some prophets and some evangelists
[37:32] and some pastors and teachers for the
[37:34] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[37:37] the ministry for the edifying of the
[37:39] body of Christ till we all come in the
[37:42] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[37:45] the son of God unto a perfect man unto
[37:47] the measure of the stature of the
[37:49] fullness of Christ. And listen here now
[37:52] that we hence more forthought be no more
[37:55] children.
[37:57] And this is how we describe the children
[37:59] in the message tossed to and fro and
[38:03] carried about by every wind of doctrine.
[38:07] Hallelujah. By the slate of men and
[38:09] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[38:12] weight to deceive but speaking the truth
[38:15] in love may grow up into him in all
[38:17] things which is the head even Christ. So
[38:20] the whole purpose of the five-fold
[38:22] ministry is so that they are no more
[38:23] children. That every doctrine, every
[38:26] idea, every new inspiration, you move
[38:28] this way because you're too young to
[38:30] understand. But God is looking for
[38:32] mature sons who have been in the
[38:34] backside of the desert. Who knows that
[38:37] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[38:39] forever. Who knows that God is God all
[38:41] by himself. Can the church say amen?
[38:46] Thank you, Jesus. When I was a child,
[38:48] Amen. I spake as a child. I understood
[38:52] as a child. I thought as a child. But
[38:54] when I became a man, I put away childish
[38:58] things. You see children, you have to
[39:00] talk to them once, twice, three, four
[39:03] times. Don't do this. Do this. That's a
[39:05] child. Why is it we have adults, we got
[39:07] to say once, two, three time. And you
[39:10] say you're a man. Come on now, somebody
[39:11] help me preach. You have to tell
[39:13] children, don't talk to strangers. Why
[39:15] is it we got to tell big men, don't talk
[39:17] to that woman in the street. Don't talk
[39:18] to that coworker over there. She's out
[39:20] to get your soul. Children, learn. Don't
[39:23] talk to strangers. We got big men
[39:25] playing around with the world. Now we
[39:27] warming up in here this morning. When I
[39:29] was a child, I spake as a child. I
[39:32] understood as a child. I thought as a
[39:34] child. But when I become a man, I put
[39:37] away childish things. How long will we
[39:40] be children? When we supposed to be
[39:42] mature, we're supposed to be grown up.
[39:46] Oh, you may be seated this morning. Can
[39:48] I dig a little deeper this morning? When
[39:50] you're a child, you have to tell the
[39:51] child, "Wake up. It's time to go to
[39:53] school. Wake up. Time to go to church.
[39:56] We got big people. You got to wake them
[39:58] up to get up in the morning. Wake them
[40:00] up to go to church. Wake them up to go
[40:02] to work. You 48. And somebody got to
[40:04] wake you up to go to work. When I was a
[40:07] child, I speak as a child. I thought as
[40:10] a child, I understood as a child. But
[40:12] when I become a man, I put away childish
[40:15] things. I say this morning, church,
[40:17] let's put away the childish things.
[40:22] You may be seated. You got to tell a
[40:24] child, "Go to bed early on Saturday
[40:27] because Sunday morning is service. Don't
[40:29] stay up too late because Sunday is the
[40:31] most important day of the week. We got
[40:33] adults with no revelation. And you tell
[40:35] me you're a man, you tell me you're a
[40:36] woman, it's time to put away childish
[40:39] things." Paul was speaking about
[40:41] himself. He said, "When I was a child, I
[40:44] put away childish things because I was
[40:46] operating a certain way. But now I've
[40:49] passed a manhood test. I've crossed the
[40:51] line. And I'm not going back to childish
[40:53] thinking. Nobody got to wake me up at
[40:55] service. Nobody got to tell me to
[40:57] worship. Nobody got to tell me my God is
[41:00] a good God. When I was a child, I wasn't
[41:02] sure about it. But now I'm a man. I'm
[41:05] going to worship God. I'm going to
[41:07] praise God."
[41:09] You may be seated. You young sisters
[41:12] playing the fool on social media with
[41:14] the boys in the world. You'll be lucky I
[41:16] don't call your name this morning.
[41:18] That's childish behavior. No revelation.
[41:20] You better grow up because we will call
[41:22] you out. The Bible said rebuke openly so
[41:25] you will fear. We will shake this house
[41:27] up because we're going to have a mature
[41:29] church. We're going to have a clean
[41:30] church. We're going to have a super
[41:32] church. This is not a church of babies.
[41:34] This is the house of God.
[41:37] Oh, you don't hear me this morning. When
[41:39] I was a child, I speak as a child. You
[41:42] may be seated. There's certain things
[41:45] you're not supposed to say. There
[41:46] certain words should never come out your
[41:48] mouth. Only children could get away with
[41:51] it. But if you say you a son of God, a
[41:54] man of God, you better clean up your
[41:56] words. You better clean up your
[41:57] vocabulary and begin to talk like a
[41:59] Christian, walk like a Christian, act
[42:02] like a Christian, live like a Christian.
[42:04] That's what the message is. That's what
[42:06] this gospel is. It's a life. is living a
[42:09] life as a real man, woman, daughter, or
[42:12] son of the living God.
[42:15] Somebody say, "Amen."
[42:17] Hallelujah.
[42:20] You got to tell the children, "Stop
[42:23] playing. Come and do your homework." You
[42:25] got to tell the children, "Make sure and
[42:27] get home on time." There a lot of stuff
[42:29] you got to tell children. When I was a
[42:31] child, I speak as a child. Understood as
[42:34] a child. As a child, you can't
[42:36] understand certain things. Amen. Amen.
[42:38] Amen. Amen. There was an experiment done
[42:40] in the United States and some parents
[42:43] cried because they spent a lot of time
[42:46] telling their children don't talk to
[42:48] strangers and don't go into strangers
[42:50] cars.
[42:52] And they did an experiment. They went to
[42:53] the parents first and say we asking your
[42:55] permission
[42:57] to try to entice your child into this
[43:00] car. Do you think you have trained your
[43:03] child well enough to not go with a
[43:06] stranger? And every one of those parents
[43:08] emphatically said, "Yes, we have taught
[43:11] our children to the best of our ability,
[43:14] and they're not going to go with any
[43:16] stranger." And these strangers came to
[43:18] the children with candy and lollipops
[43:21] and lollies and toy cars and pet dogs
[43:25] and baby kittens and little animals. And
[43:28] every single one of the children, it was
[43:30] like, "Do you want to play with a
[43:31] puppy?" "Yes, I want to play with a
[43:32] puppy." And they walked, everyone went
[43:34] away into the car. And the parents sat
[43:37] crying because they thought they had
[43:39] trained them well. But the reason is you
[43:41] can't tell a child at that age because
[43:43] as a child, your understanding is as a
[43:45] child. But when you become a man, your
[43:47] understanding is different. Your
[43:49] thinking is different.
[43:52] You may be seated.
[43:55] So how is it? We have people in the
[43:57] message for 20 years. 30 years. You're
[44:00] supposed to be mature. It takes a deep
[44:03] revelation to understand that 6 + 10 is
[44:05] 16 and 6 + 20 is 26 and 6 + 30 is 36.
[44:10] But adding time to a child doesn't make
[44:12] them a man.
[44:15] Hallelujah. So we have a crisis, brother
[44:17] Anthony. We have some some very
[44:19] oldlooking children.
[44:23] 36 going on seven. 46 going on seven, 56
[44:28] going on seven because their
[44:29] understanding is like a child. Their
[44:31] words are like a child. There's no
[44:33] wisdom. There's no understanding.
[44:35] There's no faith. There's no backbone.
[44:38] There's no zeal about the Lord. Listen,
[44:40] I'm getting to something. And just like
[44:43] those little children who responded to
[44:46] the lollies and the puppies and the
[44:48] kittens, we have Christians. The moment
[44:50] there's a little amusement, there's a
[44:52] little toy, there's a little
[44:53] distraction, there's a raise of pay,
[44:56] there's something on the job, there's a
[44:57] friend on the corner, there's some
[44:59] amusement, some distraction. You forget
[45:01] everything you heard on Sunday when we
[45:03] tell you don't go with strangers and you
[45:05] allow yourself to be caught up by every
[45:08] wind of doctrine. But this morning, we
[45:10] are exposing every devil, every demon.
[45:15] Hallelujah. You may be seated. And we
[45:18] are bringing an adult booster shot. All
[45:20] right. To shock some of you adults into
[45:23] reality of what age you really are and
[45:25] what time we're really living in. You
[45:27] can't act like your son. For the fathers
[45:29] in here, you cannot act like your son.
[45:31] For the mothers, you cannot act like
[45:32] your daughter. You have to act your age
[45:35] to give an example of what a young woman
[45:37] should grow up to. And what can I preach
[45:40] a little bit?
[45:43] I know you didn't come to hear this this
[45:45] morning, but that's all right. When I
[45:47] was a child, I spake as a child. I
[45:49] understood as a child. But when I become
[45:52] a man, I put away childish things. You
[45:55] may be seated this morning. We have
[45:56] manhood graduation school here this
[45:58] morning. We have woman graduation school
[46:01] this morning because God is looking for
[46:03] adults. He's looking for real sons. Sons
[46:06] who could stand the test.
[46:09] Can the church say amen?
[46:11] [Applause]
[46:16] children at a certain age, you you you
[46:20] need to feed them. All right?
[46:23] You can't feed them. So, you got to
[46:24] spoon feed them.
[46:27] But after a while, brother Batist. All
[46:29] right. You can't be 40 and somebody's
[46:31] spoon feeding you.
[46:34] Jesus have mercy.
[46:37] My God. 38 and you can't clean up after
[46:40] yourself. That's
[46:42] yeah, we going to turn the place upside
[46:43] down. A child, you got to clean up after
[46:46] them because they don't understand that
[46:47] that there's place for everything and
[46:49] there are certain responsibilities to
[46:51] have. But we got some big children.
[46:56] That's why God say you got to be able to
[46:57] manage your house before you could run
[46:59] the house of God. Amen. Amen. Praise
[47:02] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Some of us
[47:04] have testimonies as Christians and our
[47:05] neighbors know how we living and say you
[47:07] ain't no Christian.
[47:10] because you're acting like a child.
[47:13] No acceptance of responsibility. Fathers
[47:16] abdicating, abandoning, walking away
[47:19] from their responsibilities of men as
[47:22] men in the house of God. And because
[47:25] they are children
[47:27] and they are not in their place and
[47:29] they're not in their position, now
[47:31] there's a total domino effect of
[47:33] displacement. Because now the wife or
[47:36] the mother or the woman has to step into
[47:38] a role that she wasn't born for because
[47:40] the man is not around. Amen. When he
[47:42] should be in his position, but because
[47:44] he's a child and and he's going through
[47:46] midlife crisis, that's not in my Bible.
[47:49] Amen. He can't find himself now. He
[47:51] wants to go and skydive at 52.
[47:56] Praise God. I'm not blasting skydiving.
[47:58] I'm talking about acceptance of
[47:59] responsibility. Because God is not going
[48:02] to entrust his power to children.
[48:05] Hallelujah.
[48:07] [Applause]
[48:10] Amen. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
[48:12] It is very difficult for a child to say
[48:14] it's my fault.
[48:18] Many parents testify of walking into the
[48:20] kitchen, seeing the cookies on the
[48:22] floor, the jaw broken, the mouth covered
[48:25] in crumbs, and the child saying, "It
[48:26] wasn't me." That's right.
[48:30] Because acceptance of responsibility is
[48:32] an attribute of a man. It's an attribute
[48:36] of being an adult. It's difficult for a
[48:39] child to say, "I'm sorry," because they
[48:41] can't really understand what it is
[48:42] because their understanding is limited.
[48:45] But we have people who are grown up who
[48:47] can't say, "I'm sorry. Please
[48:50] forgive me." Adults who can't say, "I
[48:53] messed up." Hallelujah. I made a
[48:56] mistake. Even the prophet said, "I've
[48:58] made so many mistakes and I hope my
[49:00] mistakes would not be a stumbling block
[49:02] unto."
[49:04] That's a real man.
[49:06] Can the church say, "Amen."
[49:10] So, we are on a journey this morning to
[49:12] maturity, friend. That's what we come to
[49:14] church for. Not to go back home the same
[49:16] way that we came, but to come one step
[49:18] closer to being mature that God can say,
[49:21] "Yes, there is my beloved son. There's
[49:23] another one there. There's my spirit
[49:25] flowing freely because you have grown
[49:27] up." Can the church say, "Amen." Amen.
[49:31] So to become a man, brother Kangly,
[49:33] there's a process. In the natural, in
[49:35] different cultures, in Africa, there's a
[49:37] manhood test. Amen. In Greece, different
[49:40] countries, years ago, there's a manhood
[49:41] test. reach a certain age, you have to
[49:42] go and kill a lion by yourself. Bring
[49:45] back the the the hair. Bring back
[49:47] something to prove that your mind if you
[49:49] got killed no lion, you'll be 40 years
[49:51] old and you're still a boy. Cuz you
[49:53] bring back your lion yet.
[49:56] But there's some process. And just as
[49:59] different cultures have a process to
[50:00] prove that you a man, God also has a
[50:02] process.
[50:04] And the process is described through
[50:06] brotherham's message called adoption.
[50:08] Hallelujah. He said look adoption in the
[50:10] message adoption. Can you see? Let me
[50:12] show you how it's done. A father has a
[50:13] big kingdom. He He rides around. He's
[50:16] got a sunborn. He's so happy. And he
[50:19] finds the very best tutor. You know what
[50:22] a tutor is? Is a school teacher. He
[50:23] finds the very best school teacher he
[50:26] could find in all the country.
[50:28] He doesn't want just a scaly wire
[50:30] because he wants his boy to be a real
[50:32] fellow.
[50:34] And he wants a man that'll be honest
[50:36] that will tell him the truth about his
[50:38] son. Listen to what the prophet said in
[50:41] that same message. You know what the
[50:42] father did? He never said, "I'm going to
[50:44] get a pope to watch over my children."
[50:47] Never said, "I'm going to get a bishop."
[50:48] He didn't do that because he know the
[50:50] pope would be wrong. So would the
[50:52] bishop. He never said, "I'm going to get
[50:54] a general overseer to watch over my
[50:56] churches." No. No. He got the Holy
[50:58] Ghost. That was his tutor to raise his
[51:02] children.
[51:03] [Applause]
[51:04] But the B said, "How would you know the
[51:06] Holy Ghost?" He said he speaks through
[51:09] human lips. How do you know when it's
[51:11] telling the truth? When you see the Holy
[51:14] Spirit speaking through a lips that's
[51:16] telling the truth exactly every time,
[51:19] predicting and coming to pass just
[51:21] perfectly like Samuel said, then you
[51:24] know that's the truth. It's coming
[51:25] right. Because God said if he speaks and
[51:28] what he says doesn't come to pass, don't
[51:30] hear him cuz I'm not with him. But if he
[51:32] does, hear him because I'm with him.
[51:34] That's what he does. Can the church say
[51:36] amen?
[51:37] Lord
[51:39] Jesus
[51:42] Brandon goes on and then he goes around.
[51:44] Now, what do you think the tutor would
[51:45] say if he had to go up to the father and
[51:47] said, "Your children is acting awful.
[51:49] That boy of yours, he's a renegade. He's
[51:51] a roused about. I never seen such a
[51:54] fellow." You know what he does? And that
[51:56] girl of yours, I don't know what you do
[51:58] with her. H Well, you know what? She
[52:00] looks just like she's painted up like
[52:03] some of them girls over yonder, the
[52:04] Philistines. Yes, sir.
[52:08] She wants to act just like they do. So
[52:11] you young sisters who want to act like
[52:12] the Philistines, you
[52:15] what kind of report do you want the Holy
[52:16] Ghost to give about your life? What kind
[52:18] of testimony you want to have? And by
[52:20] the goes on the father saying, "My
[52:23] father, my daughter, yes, your
[52:25] daughter." That's what the Holy Spirit
[52:27] has to say about the church today. No
[52:30] wonder we can't have a revival.
[52:34] Amen. Can the church say amen?
[52:36] Hallelujah. Praise God. My my my my. And
[52:40] brother Brandham goes through a lot of
[52:41] examples about different situations
[52:43] about joining societies and the bishop
[52:45] coming over and that son going with what
[52:47] the bishop says. And he says that's not
[52:50] my boy. That's not what my son is
[52:51] supposed to do. H
[52:55] Joshua said God. And but is typing where
[52:58] Joshua was placing all the tribe. He
[52:59] said God I want you right here. Right
[53:01] here lays your place according to the
[53:03] blueprint. Your place lays right here,
[53:05] right here. You get in here, God, and
[53:07] stay here, Benjamin. You go right there.
[53:09] And now all of you stay away from the
[53:12] borders of the Philistines. But the
[53:14] Bible said Joshua comes back and here
[53:16] they all over in the Philistines having
[53:18] a big old shindig.
[53:20] Just dancing up like that. And all the
[53:22] women painted up and dancing around
[53:24] having a big time. And Joshua scratches
[53:26] his head and said, "Now what?" And
[53:28] that's exactly what's taking place.
[53:30] That's what the prophet said.
[53:32] But the man said, "Don't you imagine how
[53:34] the Holy Spirit blushes before the
[53:36] father when he has to say things like
[53:38] that?" Can the church say, "Amen." But
[53:41] when the man said, "But now let's change
[53:42] the picture." Now the father, his son,
[53:45] is a good boy. All right. His father
[53:47] here is the tutor, the Holy Spirit.
[53:49] Which way? The Holy Spirit says, "I'm
[53:50] going to walk." The child says, "I'll
[53:52] walk right with you. I'll go right with
[53:54] you." Oh, the hills awful high, son.
[53:57] I'll go right with you. I got confidence
[53:59] in you. Can the church say amen? That's
[54:01] what God loves to see.
[54:06] And brother Brandham goes on when you
[54:07] get time, you spend some time reading
[54:09] it. And brother Brandham talks about how
[54:11] the son is getting mature and God is
[54:14] asking or the father is asking the the
[54:16] the you think he's matured and then
[54:19] brother Brandon come down. Yes. He said
[54:21] yes said the Holy Spirit. I've given him
[54:22] test boy. I tried him this way. I tried
[54:25] him that way. I've throwed him down
[54:28] sick. I've put him under. I stormed him.
[54:31] I let the devil do everything to him he
[54:33] could do. And he come right back up
[54:35] again. He come the same. Come up again.
[54:38] I made him sick. I done this. I throw
[54:41] him in the hospital. I took him out here
[54:43] and I done this. I done that. I turn his
[54:46] wife against him. I turn his neighbor
[54:48] against him. I turn everything. That
[54:51] didn't make a difference. He still said,
[54:53] "Though he slay me, yet I trust him. I
[54:56] killed his family. I took this. I did
[54:59] this. I done all this. I did this.
[55:02] Hallelujah. Till he stood there. Though
[55:04] he sle me, yet I'll serve him. That's
[55:07] the son that's ready for adoption. Can
[55:09] the church say amen? Hallelujah. Thank
[55:12] you, Jesus. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[55:16] Oh, well, I believe we ought to call him
[55:18] somewhere to a special place and have an
[55:20] adoption. Hallelujah. Now when the
[55:22] father in the Old Testament understood
[55:25] that his son had come of age and had
[55:27] been seasoned out unto adoption, they
[55:30] are born a child, but they're a son
[55:32] right then. But then they'll be no more
[55:34] than just a child, just an ordinary son
[55:38] until they mature and show what they
[55:40] are. Then he calls them out. Here we
[55:43] are, church. Are you ready? This is the
[55:45] prophet. Now it's a little bit late.
[55:47] Everybody bite your finger, pinch your
[55:49] soul, pluck your heart just for a
[55:50] minute. Anybody sleeping?
[55:53] Now we're going to place the church.
[55:55] When the church gets to that place,
[55:58] Manasseh, you belong over here. Ephraim,
[56:00] you over here. Then he takes them out to
[56:02] a certain place, the father does, and
[56:05] sets him up on a high place and has a
[56:07] ceremony. And they all come around and
[56:09] he said, "I want everyone to know that
[56:11] this is my child and I adopt my son and
[56:14] I want anyone to know from henceforth
[56:17] that his name I dress him up a special
[56:20] dress on him." And I want you to know
[56:22] that his name is just as good on any
[56:24] check as my name is. He is my child. I
[56:27] adopt him into my family. Although,
[56:30] listen, he's been my son since he was
[56:33] born. Since he received the Holy Ghost,
[56:35] he's been my son. But now this is
[56:38] something different. I'm going to place
[56:40] him positionally in authority where
[56:42] every devil has to go backing up. Oh,
[56:45] you don't hear me this morning.
[56:47] At that time, you won't have to pray.
[56:49] Brother Brandham said you won't even
[56:51] have to lay hands on the sick. You will
[56:53] command the demons to go because you'll
[56:55] be in full authority. He says you will
[56:58] need to say in Jesus name that new name
[57:01] will be in you when you speak. It'll be
[57:03] the voice of the archangel. That's who
[57:05] I'm talking about. That's what I'm
[57:07] talking about. Mature sons, born sons,
[57:10] filled sons, placed sons. Can the church
[57:13] say, "Amen."
[57:15] In a position of authority, you may be
[57:17] seated. Not just a church member, but
[57:19] now you have power. Now you have
[57:20] authority. Now you don't need to come to
[57:22] the pastor and say, "Pray for me." You
[57:24] need something. You speak to it and see
[57:26] demons on the run. Amen. Devils on the
[57:29] run. Hallelujah. Demons on the run.
[57:32] Because you are now mature. Brother
[57:33] Terrence the five-fold ministry is
[57:35] limited. Amen. Because it's unto the
[57:38] unity of the faith and the knowledge.
[57:40] Amen. When that work is finished, then
[57:43] it's mature sons walking out because
[57:45] everyone is directly connected. There's
[57:47] no secretary. There's no one between you
[57:49] and the father. You are connected just
[57:51] like the other sons who are connected.
[57:53] There is my spirit flowing freely. You
[57:55] don't need permission from somebody to
[57:57] do anything. You are child of the king.
[58:00] And when you say go, the demons have to
[58:03] go. When you say come, your son has to
[58:05] come. Your daughter
[58:08] because you are in authority.
[58:10] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Oh,
[58:14] hallelujah. Wonderful. Amen.
[58:17] Hallelujah. So, we're talking about
[58:19] putting away the childish things.
[58:20] Hallelujah. As a sign that you are now
[58:23] reaching to maturity. Hallelujah. Nobody
[58:26] got to keep pushing you and come to
[58:28] service and come on time and come early
[58:30] and and cut away the worldly friends and
[58:32] don't talk to that boy in the world and
[58:34] don't spend time with a girl in the
[58:36] world. Hallelujah.
[58:39] Speaking to children.
[58:42] But when you're mature, then God could
[58:44] have a different kind of conversation.
[58:46] You see the conversation between a
[58:48] father and child changes. But the night
[58:49] as the child gets older, when a child is
[58:51] young is what's that? That's dad that
[58:53] that's don't touch with that. Don't play
[58:54] with that. But when a child gets older
[58:56] and now comes in the father's business,
[58:58] then the father can now talk to the
[59:00] child differently. Say, I'm thinking of
[59:01] putting another building over there.
[59:03] What What do you think about that? Amen.
[59:06] Maybe we should move it to the left.
[59:07] Maybe we should Now they have a
[59:08] different kind of conversation. It's no
[59:10] longer don't touch this and don't do
[59:11] this. No. Now it's all about listen, I
[59:13] think I'm going to go heal somebody over
[59:15] there and the father say yes, go heal
[59:17] that one or go do this one. There's
[59:19] somebody I needed to go and pray for.
[59:20] That's a different kind of relationship.
[59:23] That's right. Praise God.
[59:26] Thank you, Jesus. Can the church say
[59:27] amen? And we know how God loves
[59:30] fellowship. Amen. He love come now in
[59:32] the cool of the evening and talk to
[59:33] Adam. Adam was not a child.
[59:37] Adam was mature. He was in the image of
[59:40] the Lord. He was in the he was he was he
[59:42] was in the condition that no sin could
[59:44] touch him and God could have a
[59:45] relationship with him. Hallelujah. Yes.
[59:47] Yes. Yes. Yes. But when man fell,
[59:51] Adam reverted
[59:54] to a childlike understanding because he
[59:56] could no longer see through spiritual
[59:57] eyes.
[59:59] And that's how the chain reaction of
[1:00:01] people now who have to go through a
[1:00:02] process. That's right. Just as Jesus
[1:00:04] himself had to go through a process
[1:00:06] where the Bible said he learned
[1:00:07] obedience by the things that he
[1:00:09] suffered. That's right.
[1:00:12] I love speaking about that because
[1:00:13] people don't like to speak about that.
[1:00:14] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:00:16] suffered.
[1:00:18] Hallelujah. And if he had to suffer and
[1:00:20] we want a free pass, you know, in some
[1:00:22] schools they allow you to skip a
[1:00:23] standard or skip a grade because you're
[1:00:24] you're bright.
[1:00:26] God has no skipping no grades. Everybody
[1:00:29] have to go through the same process.
[1:00:31] Repent, be baptized, clean up your
[1:00:34] house, receive the Holy Ghost on your
[1:00:36] way to adoption. There's no way to skip
[1:00:38] this class. There's no class to jump.
[1:00:40] It's the same process. And if Jesus had
[1:00:42] to go through the same process, who you
[1:00:43] think you are, it's going to be the same
[1:00:45] process. You have some more licks to
[1:00:47] get, some more reproof to get, some more
[1:00:49] because God wants perfection.
[1:00:53] Can the church say amen?
[1:00:55] Now listen carefully. Brother Brandham
[1:00:57] said in the message, turn on the light.
[1:00:59] He said, a man is known by his
[1:01:00] credentials
[1:01:02] and the credentials of the word of God
[1:01:04] if he is sent by the word of God. And
[1:01:07] with the word of God, it is same in
[1:01:09] every age. It's always been. We can't
[1:01:11] live by yesterday's light. Yesterday's
[1:01:13] light is history. We know nothing about
[1:01:15] it. You can't get warm today by the sun
[1:01:18] that was shining yesterday. And that's
[1:01:20] what the matter with the churches today.
[1:01:22] That's what the matter with the people.
[1:01:24] They're trying to live by what happened
[1:01:26] yesterday. You can't warm by a painted
[1:01:29] fire. Certainly not. It has no heat in
[1:01:31] it. Yesterday's sun has no heat in it.
[1:01:35] The sunlight is sent to the earth in the
[1:01:37] natural to ripen the grain for the
[1:01:40] advancing harvest. Each day brings forth
[1:01:42] a new sun. And the sun that's shining
[1:01:45] today bringing the wheat up that same
[1:01:47] sun. Hallelujah. It's got to be stronger
[1:01:51] and more powerful each day it grows and
[1:01:53] matures to bring the grain on.
[1:01:55] Hallelujah. Amen. Can the church say
[1:01:57] amen?
[1:02:01] Hallelujah. Brother said, "But this is
[1:02:03] another day. This is another hour. This
[1:02:06] is the advancement of the gospel. It's
[1:02:08] coming to its maturity. So, we can't
[1:02:10] live in what Luther said, Wesley said,
[1:02:12] or some of the rest of them. We're
[1:02:14] living in the light that's predicted for
[1:02:16] this day. We're in the seventh church
[1:02:18] age, not the third or the fourth. The
[1:02:20] grain should be able to receive it. If
[1:02:22] it doesn't, it falls off and it means
[1:02:24] nothing to it. The grain is matured with
[1:02:27] the light if it goes ahead with the
[1:02:29] light. Can the church say amen?
[1:02:32] So what are we talking about in position
[1:02:34] in Christ? God trying to place his
[1:02:36] church in position to manifest himself.
[1:02:40] Getting one that he can work through
[1:02:41] like this saying there's my spirit
[1:02:43] flowing freely. There it is that I can
[1:02:45] work here. Get another one over here and
[1:02:47] place him. I can place him. Adoption
[1:02:50] placing manifesting. Taking him out here
[1:02:54] and put a ceremony on him. Visit him
[1:02:56] with an angel.
[1:02:58] I'm not talking about coming to church
[1:03:00] now. Amen. I'm talking about something
[1:03:02] completely different. This is between
[1:03:04] you and the father. Now, not you and the
[1:03:06] pastor and the elder. This is different.
[1:03:09] Hallelujah.
[1:03:11] Visit him with an angel. Tell him
[1:03:13] something. Amen.
[1:03:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, if he's
[1:03:18] told the truth, now if he's just making
[1:03:19] up something, it won't work. No, that
[1:03:21] won't work. We've had a lot of that. But
[1:03:23] I mean manifestation of sons of God.
[1:03:26] When God manifests himself and he sends
[1:03:29] them out and then he goes forth and what
[1:03:32] he says is truth. What he does is the
[1:03:34] truth. What he does he manifest Christ.
[1:03:36] Can the church say amen? Amen. Amen. In
[1:03:40] the message, what here is thou Elijah?
[1:03:41] Brother Brandham said, "Oh, how that we
[1:03:43] need in this journey that we're in now
[1:03:45] to find a place of rest to feast on the
[1:03:48] word of God." And that's what we're
[1:03:51] doing here this Sunday, a place of rest
[1:03:52] to feast on the word of God so that
[1:03:55] it'll give us strength night after
[1:03:57] night. Go to the room and rest and come
[1:04:00] back the next morning fresh and eat some
[1:04:02] more for there's a great journey and a
[1:04:04] great battle ahead for the church. I
[1:04:06] believe that we have been children long
[1:04:08] enough. God's going to turn his church
[1:04:11] into manhood now. and we played and
[1:04:14] frolicked as children. But now we're
[1:04:16] going to have to put away childish
[1:04:19] things and take on manhood, maturity.
[1:04:22] That's the prophet's words. Can the
[1:04:23] church say amen?
[1:04:26] He said, I believe it was Paul who said,
[1:04:28] "When I was a child, I spake as a child
[1:04:30] because he thought as a child, but it's
[1:04:32] time we begin to think like men and
[1:04:35] women now. For we've got to get down to
[1:04:38] business.
[1:04:40] Get down to business." What kind of
[1:04:41] business? praying some more. Amen.
[1:04:44] Reading some more. Amen. Amen. Get down
[1:04:46] to business because there's a work
[1:04:48] ahead, friends. Hallelujah. The time is
[1:04:50] short.
[1:04:52] Going after stuff that wouldn't even
[1:04:54] last, but time to get down to business
[1:04:56] because the rapture is at hand. But the
[1:04:57] brand in the time of decision. So the
[1:04:59] church is not in its right state yet. We
[1:05:02] have to remember it's not matured. So we
[1:05:04] just have to linger and do the best we
[1:05:06] can. And listen, there's no one can
[1:05:08] bring it to maturity. Only the Holy
[1:05:11] Spirit. Amen.
[1:05:13] So, no minister could bring it to
[1:05:14] maturity. Only the Holy Spirit can bring
[1:05:17] it to maturity. But the B said, "I don't
[1:05:20] believe it'll ever come by man. It'll
[1:05:22] have to come by God." Somebody say,
[1:05:24] "Amen."
[1:05:26] So mature. No more children.
[1:05:29] Responsible, tried, tested, proven,
[1:05:32] having overcome. And anytime God is
[1:05:35] about to do something, he must find
[1:05:36] somebody to work through. He must find a
[1:05:39] witness somewhere. Anytime God wants to
[1:05:41] reveal a part of himself, his nature,
[1:05:44] his being, his attributes, he must find
[1:05:47] somebody and he got to train that
[1:05:49] person, he got to bring them up. So when
[1:05:51] God wanted to do something, he found
[1:05:52] little David somewhere in the backside
[1:05:54] of the desert with his sheep. But God
[1:05:57] knew the destination was really Goliath.
[1:06:00] But before David could face Goliath, God
[1:06:02] had to take him through a process of
[1:06:04] maturity to be able to handle Goliath.
[1:06:06] Because if he showed him Goliath right
[1:06:08] away, it might have been too much for
[1:06:10] him. So David in his youth, there he is
[1:06:12] on the back side of the desert. And God
[1:06:14] threw a lion at him. And what did he do?
[1:06:16] He overcame. And God said, "Yes, that's
[1:06:19] my boy. That's what I'm looking for."
[1:06:21] But now you can handle that. I can't
[1:06:23] send another lion for you.
[1:06:26] Amen. I got to send something more. I'm
[1:06:28] going to send a bear. And when the bear
[1:06:29] came, David overcome the bear. Now God
[1:06:32] said, "He's ready. He's ready for the
[1:06:34] final showdown. I've thr at him. I've
[1:06:37] throwed that at him and he overcome. Now
[1:06:39] it's time for the final kill. And God,
[1:06:42] all your trials, all your testing, all
[1:06:45] your situation was God preparing you for
[1:06:48] your final showdown to meet your
[1:06:51] Philistine.
[1:06:52] Get ready for the face off. Get ready
[1:06:55] for the final battle. Get ready for the
[1:06:57] showdown. But now you got something a
[1:06:59] child doesn't have. You may be seated.
[1:07:02] A child doesn't have experience. But now
[1:07:04] David, he has experience. Uh he has been
[1:07:07] through some stuff. Uh but now you are
[1:07:09] mature. You are getting grown up. Uh you
[1:07:11] have been through all kind of stuff and
[1:07:13] you have the same testimony. If it
[1:07:15] wasn't for the Lord, I wouldn't be here.
[1:07:18] The Lord delivered me from the lion. The
[1:07:20] Lord delivered me from the bear. I have
[1:07:22] dealt with this before. Who is this
[1:07:24] uncircumcised Philistine that dare defy
[1:07:27] the armies of the living God? Who is
[1:07:30] this uncircumcised Philistine trying to
[1:07:33] come into the church? Who is this
[1:07:34] uncircumcised Philistine trying to take
[1:07:37] me from God? Who is this uncircumcised
[1:07:39] Philistine trying to get me tied up with
[1:07:42] some boy in the world, some girl in the
[1:07:44] world, some worldly ambition, some
[1:07:46] worldly desire? Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] I'll chop your head off. And this
[1:07:51] morning, I believe we have men of God,
[1:07:54] women of God, who going to now draw
[1:07:56] their swords and chop every devil, chop
[1:07:59] every demon. We are fearless this
[1:08:02] morning. We are not children this
[1:08:04] morning. Listen, children cannot go to
[1:08:06] war. You may be seated.
[1:08:09] Amen. Whenever there's a war, they say,
[1:08:11] "Send the women and children away
[1:08:13] because there's a real men to fight."
[1:08:15] So, I'm looking for some mature
[1:08:16] Christians this morning. I'm not looking
[1:08:18] at your chronological age, but I know
[1:08:20] there are some young people here who
[1:08:22] could be some real men of God. Uh, some
[1:08:24] real women of God. I'm looking for sons
[1:08:27] and daughters of God to take their
[1:08:28] position. Who could tell the devil, "No,
[1:08:31] I'm not going to backslide. No, I'm not
[1:08:33] going to bow down. No, I'm not going to
[1:08:35] foricate. No, I'm not going to commit
[1:08:37] adultery. No, I'm not going to take all
[1:08:39] my time so I can't pray. No, I'm going
[1:08:41] to make time to pray. No, I'm going to
[1:08:43] make time to read. No, I'm going to
[1:08:45] stand up and worship. Know I might be
[1:08:48] weak, but I'm going to say I'm strong.
[1:08:50] You're not going to get me to say I'm
[1:08:52] weak. I might be backlitting, but I
[1:08:54] ain't stripping. I know who my God is.
[1:08:56] You don't hear me this morning. Oh,
[1:08:59] glory to God.
[1:09:01] You may be seated. Real men. Real men.
[1:09:05] One time there was a man. True story.
[1:09:08] All right. He was in a bar one time and
[1:09:10] some people came into the bar. They were
[1:09:12] talking about brother Brandham and this
[1:09:13] man was drunk at the counter and he
[1:09:15] heard them talking about God's prophet
[1:09:17] and they were talking a bunch of
[1:09:19] nonsense about the prophet and he spun
[1:09:21] around. He said, "Look here. I might be
[1:09:23] drunk but I ain't stupid. That's a man
[1:09:26] of God. And right now you might be weak
[1:09:28] but we ain't stupid. We might be down in
[1:09:31] the dumps but we ain't stupid. We know
[1:09:33] the God we serve. We know who is the
[1:09:35] King of Kings. It's not my strength.
[1:09:38] It's not by might. It's not by power but
[1:09:40] by the spirit of the Lord. We're going
[1:09:43] to have a revival. We're going to have a
[1:09:45] real church. We're going to have a super
[1:09:47] church. We're going to have a church
[1:09:48] that the sick cannot stay in the church.
[1:09:50] We're going to have a church that are
[1:09:52] backsliders get delivered because there
[1:09:54] will be some mature sons, some mature
[1:09:57] daughters who have gone through the
[1:09:59] flood, gone through the fire. Can the
[1:10:02] church say amen?
[1:10:04] So don't be discouraged. Uh get your
[1:10:06] faith up. Uh get your faith banks up.
[1:10:09] You begin to get desperate to see your
[1:10:12] family coming. Uh it's not about you,
[1:10:14] but your family is coming. Get desperate
[1:10:17] to see your children delivered because
[1:10:19] they are coming. We say no to the devil
[1:10:22] this morning. We have gone through the
[1:10:24] process now. We are almost fully grown
[1:10:26] up. Uh the bride knows who she is.
[1:10:32] Oh hallelujah.
[1:10:35] Hallelujah.
[1:10:36] Oh glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:10:39] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "God
[1:10:41] is waiting on you and I. He has already
[1:10:43] done his part. He send the prophet. He
[1:10:46] send the message. He already pour out
[1:10:49] the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost.
[1:10:51] And he taught us the Holy Ghost that
[1:10:53] fell on that day is just as real as
[1:10:55] what's going to fall in our day." He
[1:10:57] said, "The same God that healed the sick
[1:11:00] is still here right now. When the
[1:11:02] prophet left, the angel never left. But
[1:11:05] God is hunting this morning. He is
[1:11:07] searching this morning for some born
[1:11:09] sons, some filled sons, and some place
[1:11:12] sons. He's looking for the manifestation
[1:11:15] of the sons of God. But before there
[1:11:17] could be a manifestation, there's got to
[1:11:19] be somebody who could put away the
[1:11:21] childish things.
[1:11:24] Oh, come on. This morning, put away the
[1:11:27] childish things. Young sister, that's
[1:11:29] childish. When you cut your hair, that's
[1:11:32] childish. When you play with makeup,
[1:11:34] that's childish things. This morning we
[1:11:36] are going to put away the childish
[1:11:38] things this morning because we are
[1:11:39] getting ready. We are getting ready for
[1:11:41] the responsibility of manhood. God is
[1:11:44] getting ready to pour the Holy Ghost on
[1:11:46] sons and daughters who are mature. Can
[1:11:49] the church say amen? So God is looking
[1:11:52] for somebody when he wanted to to do the
[1:11:55] whole reformation. He found Luther. That
[1:11:57] was the one man he could find. And
[1:11:59] listen, you may be seated. Luther, we
[1:12:01] don't have much information about him,
[1:12:03] but he had a rough life. He had a hard
[1:12:05] life. It wasn't easy for him as he was
[1:12:07] trying to find truth and trying to find
[1:12:09] a right and he went into the Catholic
[1:12:11] church looking for clarity and he found
[1:12:13] a Bible chained to a wall somewhere
[1:12:16] because he couldn't carry a Bible at
[1:12:18] home. Now you got Bible at home on the
[1:12:20] computer, on the phone, on the iPad. He
[1:12:22] had to find a Bible chain to a wall. And
[1:12:25] in that day they told him, you got to
[1:12:27] pay money to go to heaven. You got to
[1:12:29] pay money for your family. And he found
[1:12:31] a scripture, the just shall live by
[1:12:33] faith.
[1:12:34] Hallelujah. And God had somebody to work
[1:12:38] with. He had to die to himself, die to
[1:12:41] his feelings, put away the childish
[1:12:43] things.
[1:12:45] Thank you, Jesus. I'm too shy. I can't
[1:12:47] testify. I can't tell people about
[1:12:49] Jesus. He couldn't talk that. That's
[1:12:51] childish things.
[1:12:53] [Applause]
[1:12:57] Hallelujah. And he had to declare a
[1:12:58] message that nobody heard before. Thank
[1:13:01] you, Lord. But God was with him because
[1:13:04] God loves to prove his word. And he
[1:13:06] could only prove his word by believers.
[1:13:08] So God is looking for some believers
[1:13:10] this morning who are ready to empty out
[1:13:12] themselves of their old ways so he could
[1:13:15] move freely in them. Can the church say
[1:13:17] amen? And when God was ready to move on,
[1:13:20] he was again hunted for somebody who
[1:13:22] would put away the childish things.
[1:13:24] Because when you caught up with the
[1:13:26] distractions, you cannot hear the still
[1:13:28] small voice. So he found somebody by the
[1:13:31] name of Wesley who was searching for him
[1:13:33] as much as he was searching for him.
[1:13:35] They were searching for each other.
[1:13:36] There was a deep call going to the deep
[1:13:38] and because of that there was a deep to
[1:13:40] respond and Wesley he was in place to
[1:13:43] say you need to be sanctified.
[1:13:46] Are you with me this morning?
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:50] Hallelujah. Then we come to the prophet
[1:13:53] from a young age. God told the prophet
[1:13:55] don't drink. All right. Amen. All right.
[1:13:58] Don't smoke. All right. Don't defile
[1:14:01] your body. All right. Because I got a
[1:14:03] work for you to do. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:14:05] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] This one was going to be different.
[1:14:13] Amen. This one was important. Thank you,
[1:14:16] Lord. This one was about to something
[1:14:18] was about to happen that couldn't happen
[1:14:20] with any other prophet. Hallelujah.
[1:14:21] Amen. And he had to be sold out. Yes,
[1:14:24] sir. He had to put away his feelings,
[1:14:26] put away his emotions, put away his
[1:14:29] complexes, put away his insecurities. He
[1:14:32] had to put it all away. He had to be a
[1:14:34] real man of God and carry and pack a
[1:14:37] burden not for just those who were
[1:14:39] hearing, but those who would hear where
[1:14:41] the tapes would go out because he knew
[1:14:43] that the tapes would fall into the hands
[1:14:45] of the predestinated. There would be
[1:14:47] some individuals who were not around
[1:14:49] when he was around but the same word
[1:14:51] would go forth that you are
[1:14:53] predestinated unto adoption that you are
[1:14:55] predestinated for the Holy Ghost that
[1:14:57] you are predestinated for perfection and
[1:14:59] it's a process born again place a trying
[1:15:02] and you are positionally placed it's the
[1:15:05] same process but when you empty out all
[1:15:08] the childish behaviors then I could work
[1:15:10] with you so this morning we want to stir
[1:15:12] the pot up this morning and we want to
[1:15:14] throw the trash out the househ throw the
[1:15:17] trash out our lives and make room. Make
[1:15:20] room for the Holy Ghost. Make room for
[1:15:22] the outpouring. Make room for what God
[1:15:24] has in store for you. Somebody say,
[1:15:26] "Amen."
[1:15:28] Hallelujah.
[1:15:33] Thank you, Jesus. From the message what
[1:15:36] the Holy Ghost was given for.
[1:15:37] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "But
[1:15:39] now when we need it, the spirit of God
[1:15:42] raises a standard." What is it? He's
[1:15:44] pouring in his spirit. Then those who
[1:15:46] are resting out yonder in the grave or
[1:15:49] under the altar of God as the scripture
[1:15:51] says are crying how long Lord how long
[1:15:54] how much longer God's waiting on me and
[1:15:56] you. Amen. The church is waiting on me
[1:15:59] and you adoption time when God can pour
[1:16:02] into us his fullness, his power, his
[1:16:04] resurrection that when the church and
[1:16:06] Christ become so close together till
[1:16:09] Christ becomes visible among us and
[1:16:11] raises the dead and we go into the
[1:16:13] rapture. Can the church say amen? Now in
[1:16:16] the message things that are to be.
[1:16:19] Brother Benham said, "Now in the
[1:16:21] natural, you grew from your birth. When
[1:16:24] you were born and presented into this
[1:16:26] world, God knew that you were going to
[1:16:28] be here on this earth." Hallelujah. And
[1:16:30] you grow from birth to maturity. Things
[1:16:33] that seemed strange to you in your young
[1:16:36] womanhood, young boyhood as children now
[1:16:38] seems very real. You couldn't understand
[1:16:41] it when you was a child. But now as you
[1:16:44] become adult, you begin to understand
[1:16:47] and find out that everything was just
[1:16:49] set right.
[1:16:53] Well, you don't hear me this morning.
[1:16:55] You know, it really means something to
[1:16:56] you now. So, is it in your spiritual
[1:16:59] birth? You do things you don't
[1:17:01] understand. When you're a little baby,
[1:17:04] you come to the altar. You give your
[1:17:06] life to Christ. You do such strange
[1:17:08] things. You wonder why you did it. But
[1:17:12] after a while, when you mature as
[1:17:13] matured Christians, then you understand
[1:17:15] it. See, there's something picks up. You
[1:17:18] see why you had to do it. Your spiritual
[1:17:21] birth, your natural birth types, your
[1:17:23] spiritual. Oh, how it fitted to you in
[1:17:26] this life as you grew. Everything fitted
[1:17:28] right in because you were made for that.
[1:17:31] Hallelujah. Wasn't it a strange thing
[1:17:33] that night you staggered into the
[1:17:35] mission, the tent meeting or the little
[1:17:37] church somewhere on the corner and
[1:17:39] something the preacher preached on on a
[1:17:41] certain subject and you just fell right
[1:17:43] at the altar. See, God knew that before
[1:17:46] the foundation of the world. See, it
[1:17:49] seems strange to you why you did it
[1:17:51] then, but now you understand. You knew
[1:17:54] what happened. It's so fitting to you in
[1:17:56] this life. Amen. Amen. So will also be
[1:18:00] in the life that is to come. The world
[1:18:02] and his life seems to advance as you
[1:18:05] mature. Everything seems to go right for
[1:18:08] you. Brother said, I don't believe that
[1:18:10] a person just happened to be here by
[1:18:12] chance.
[1:18:14] Just think when you come to the world,
[1:18:16] everything had to be for prepared or
[1:18:19] pre-prepared rather for you. I don't
[1:18:22] hardly understand how we could think
[1:18:24] that God could prepare all these things
[1:18:25] for us and we can't put our trust in
[1:18:27] him. Can the church say amen? Oh, I say
[1:18:31] this morning, if you put your trust in
[1:18:33] Jesus, then everything will be all
[1:18:35] right. Oh, that's a powerful song. If
[1:18:37] you put your trust in Jesus, then
[1:18:40] everything is going to be all right. And
[1:18:42] that's a problem with so many of us. We
[1:18:44] don't put our trust in Jesus. But I
[1:18:46] believe this morning we getting back to
[1:18:48] putting our trust in Jesus and watched
[1:18:50] everything be all right. Can the church
[1:18:52] say amen? Thank you, Lord. So, Brother
[1:18:54] Brandham spoke and he prophesied and
[1:18:56] nobody really understood what he said.
[1:18:58] But the hour has come to seal not the
[1:19:01] sayings and let them be revealed to the
[1:19:03] bride. The bride hasn't had no
[1:19:06] manifestation of God to stir the bride.
[1:19:09] There hasn't been a real stirring.
[1:19:11] Listen, they he promised them seven
[1:19:14] thunders back there to wake her up
[1:19:16] again. What for? To put the bride into
[1:19:18] action. That's right. Not to put the
[1:19:20] bride into coming to church, but to put
[1:19:22] you into action. To go after your
[1:19:24] family. To go after your loved ones. To
[1:19:27] heal the sick, to put the bride into
[1:19:29] action so we can go into the rapture.
[1:19:31] Not to come here every Sunday. This is
[1:19:33] temporary. There's coming a day we
[1:19:35] wouldn't come to this church anymore,
[1:19:37] but we will walk out into the hospital
[1:19:39] walls, walk out our family, a short
[1:19:42] quick message, shake the whole nation,
[1:19:44] and then the rapture will take place.
[1:19:46] Can the church say amen?
[1:19:50] Praise God.
[1:19:53] Hallelujah.
[1:19:55] Amen. Amen. So almost 50 years but the
[1:19:57] brand is off the scene and there have
[1:19:59] been all kind of interpretations, all
[1:20:01] kinds of ideas, all kinds of
[1:20:03] speculations and analysis and stuff.
[1:20:06] People tossed to and fro like little
[1:20:09] children. They don't know which way to
[1:20:10] go. But God will have some mature sons
[1:20:12] who will stay with the word just the way
[1:20:16] the prophet said it. Not a new
[1:20:18] interpretation, not a new message, not a
[1:20:20] new doctrine, but the same message
[1:20:23] proven to be the truth brought by a
[1:20:25] vindicated prophet. Because God only
[1:20:27] brings his message to one man in each
[1:20:30] generation. And God already brought a
[1:20:32] message to a vindicated prophet. He
[1:20:35] doesn't need another vindication. He
[1:20:37] doesn't need your approval or my
[1:20:39] approval. We preach a vindicated
[1:20:41] message. And this message must come to
[1:20:43] pass. But God is waiting for some sons
[1:20:46] to come to maturity to take the word and
[1:20:48] hand it there. A child can't take the
[1:20:51] word and hand it there. But God is going
[1:20:53] to raise up some men of God to take the
[1:20:56] word and hand it there. Wait till them
[1:20:58] seven thunders utter their voices to
[1:21:00] that group, that group of real men, that
[1:21:03] group of real women who have put away
[1:21:05] the childish things and they are focused
[1:21:08] on getting out of here. They are focused
[1:21:10] on the resurrection. They are focused on
[1:21:12] the rapture. Can the church say amen?
[1:21:15] Hallelujah.
[1:21:17] What's her identification? She has stood
[1:21:19] the test.
[1:21:21] That bride has overcome herself.
[1:21:23] Hallelujah. She has overcome her ideas.
[1:21:26] She has overcome her interpretations.
[1:21:29] She has overcome everything. The lust of
[1:21:31] the eyes, the lust of the flesh, the
[1:21:34] pride of life, false Christ, Antichrist,
[1:21:37] denomination, mother, father, husband,
[1:21:40] brother, sister, neighbor, boss,
[1:21:42] coworker, she has overcome and she's
[1:21:44] pressing on because she is predestinated
[1:21:47] to overcome. Can the church say amen?
[1:21:51] Just like the lilies in the muck, inside
[1:21:54] is a predestinated seed. And from 1965
[1:21:57] to now, it's been filthy water covering
[1:22:00] up the seas. But the liies but the sheen
[1:22:02] that are down in the earth are hearing a
[1:22:04] voice from on high saying, "Come on,
[1:22:06] liies, press. Come on, liies. Press out
[1:22:08] of the muck. Press out of the m there's
[1:22:11] a voice that's calling. There's a
[1:22:13] message from glory saying, you can make
[1:22:15] it. You You can make it, Mrs. Jesus
[1:22:17] Christ. You can make it. Bride of
[1:22:19] Christ, God is going to send a revival.
[1:22:22] Keep pressing. God's going to fill you
[1:22:23] with the Holy Ghost. Keep pressing. God
[1:22:26] is going to use you. Just throw the
[1:22:27] trash out. God is going to bless you.
[1:22:29] Just clean your house out. God is going
[1:22:32] to adopt you. Just throw away all the
[1:22:34] childish things and watch God bless you.
[1:22:37] Can the church say amen?
[1:22:40] I'm not going to be too much longer. I'm
[1:22:42] getting ready to wind up. Musician get
[1:22:44] ready to come up now. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:22:47] God cannot send a revival in the message
[1:22:51] called man until he's got a man in shape
[1:22:53] to take it. We cannot have a revival
[1:22:56] until we get men. God called men. God
[1:22:59] trained men. That's not trained up in
[1:23:02] the schools of theology and of
[1:23:03] education, but rugged men of fate that
[1:23:06] God has brought up in the school of his
[1:23:09] rugged training. Men who are not afraid
[1:23:11] to face the fire. Men who has come in
[1:23:14] the presence of God and knows his power
[1:23:16] and knows his omnipotence and knows his
[1:23:19] healing power. Some men that's trained
[1:23:22] uh to know the living God. It's all
[1:23:24] right to train them by the word, but the
[1:23:26] letter killth. The spirit give it life.
[1:23:29] But before we could have this revival
[1:23:31] and we going to have this revival, God
[1:23:34] has to call out and train men. God
[1:23:37] trained men to carry this message.
[1:23:41] Oh, are you with me this morning? And
[1:23:43] they don't care what the opposition is.
[1:23:45] They are willing to go to the fiery
[1:23:47] furnace in defeat or to the lion's den
[1:23:49] or whatever it may be. They're ready to
[1:23:52] go because they have been in the
[1:23:53] presence of God and know what he is.
[1:23:56] Whether it's the victory or defeat, they
[1:23:58] still stand the same. That's the kind of
[1:24:01] training God does to man. It's very
[1:24:03] strange to think that God would do that,
[1:24:06] but God trains his men like that he
[1:24:08] does. Can the church say amen?
[1:24:11] Amen. Brother Brandon said, "We know we
[1:24:13] have an old song. We sing some through
[1:24:15] the waters, some through the floods,
[1:24:18] some through deep trials, but all
[1:24:20] through the blood." God leads his people
[1:24:23] through great trials to purge them. And
[1:24:26] sometimes it take years to do it.
[1:24:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Just disappeared on
[1:24:32] that one. It take years to do it. to
[1:24:36] purge the word out of you, to purge
[1:24:38] yourself out, to purge your desires out,
[1:24:41] and to get you to trod all the childish
[1:24:43] things in your life. It take years to do
[1:24:45] it. But all through the blood, God leads
[1:24:48] his people through great trials to purge
[1:24:50] them. Sometime it take years to do it.
[1:24:53] But as for my for myself tonight, I
[1:24:55] believe that right now, God is training
[1:24:58] such men to meet the front line. Men who
[1:25:01] are going through and time shook their
[1:25:03] feet sometimes look like the whole
[1:25:05] thing's falling but yet in the midst of
[1:25:07] it all they know that living God and
[1:25:09] keep their face forward keep moving on.
[1:25:12] Somebody say amen.
[1:25:15] Oh glory glory glory glory.
[1:25:19] Just two more quotes and we're done from
[1:25:21] the message adoption. The Bible said the
[1:25:23] church is supposed to be predestinated
[1:25:25] unto the adoption of children where God
[1:25:28] can take a man and adopt him into the
[1:25:31] family and give him something that first
[1:25:34] try that and see if it's right. The
[1:25:36] Bible said try the spirits. This man
[1:25:39] claims a certain thing. Try it and see
[1:25:41] if it's right. If it's right, move right
[1:25:43] with it. Then say, Lord, send us
[1:25:45] something else. Keep moving. Just keep
[1:25:47] moving. Say, every fellow take his
[1:25:49] place. Then you're going to see the
[1:25:52] church of God begin to get its place.
[1:25:55] Then's when the Philistines will go to
[1:25:57] backing up. The shorts will go off. Hair
[1:26:01] will grow down. Faces will be washed.
[1:26:04] Sigas will be missing. That's right.
[1:26:06] When the church begins to get into its
[1:26:09] mighty power, when they have an Ananas
[1:26:12] and Safhara, a few of them. Yes, sir.
[1:26:14] You will see what the holy church stands
[1:26:16] together in its power. Positionally
[1:26:18] placed as sons of God, adopted into the
[1:26:21] family of God. Powerful church standing
[1:26:24] there in his glory. Oh, that's what he's
[1:26:27] coming for. Do you believe that this
[1:26:28] morning? Amen. Last quote. Hear him.
[1:26:33] There'll be a power put into the church.
[1:26:35] And now it's coming in that the Holy
[1:26:38] Spirit will so anoint the people till
[1:26:40] they'll speak the word and it'll create
[1:26:42] itself right there. We haven't seen
[1:26:44] powers like coming to the church now. I
[1:26:47] know it for a fact. Say unto this
[1:26:50] mountain be moved. Don't doubt in your
[1:26:52] heart but believe that you have said
[1:26:54] shall come to pass. You can have what
[1:26:55] you have said. The placing of the church
[1:26:57] in position where the fullness of the
[1:27:00] power of the Holy Ghost comes into the
[1:27:02] church. Then critics's mouths will be
[1:27:04] shut. It'll be a short time. Jesus come
[1:27:07] right off to the mountain, went straight
[1:27:09] to Calvary. It won't last long, but
[1:27:11] it'll be here. May the Lord richly bless
[1:27:13] you this morning. Give the Lord a hand
[1:27:15] of praise, Brother Anthony.
[1:27:18] [Applause]
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Give him praise
[1:27:33] this morning. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:39] Oh yes, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father.
[1:27:43] Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:49] Oh, hallelujah.

[1:27:56] the waters,
[1:27:59] some through the flood.
[1:28:03] Oh, some through
[1:28:07] great trials,
[1:28:10] but all through the
[1:28:14] oh
[1:28:15] some through
[1:28:17] great sorrow,
[1:28:20] but God hears a song.
[1:28:25] Oh, in the night season.
[1:28:31] Oh, and all the deep. Some through the
[1:28:35] waters. Oh, some through
[1:28:39] the water.

[1:28:44] the
[1:28:46] Oh,
[1:28:47] some through
[1:28:50] the trials,
[1:28:52] but all through the
[1:28:56] Oh,
[1:28:58] some through
[1:29:00] great sorrow,
[1:29:03] but God gave
[1:29:06] a song.
[1:29:08] Oh, and in the night season.
[1:29:13] Oh, and all the day. Oh, one more time.
[1:29:18] Sing
[1:29:20] through the water.
[1:29:24] S through.
[1:29:28] Oh, something
[1:29:32] great,
[1:29:34] but all
[1:29:38] [Laughter]
[1:29:40] and some through
[1:29:42] great sorrow.
[1:29:44] Oh, but God gives a song.
[1:29:50] Oh, and in the night season,
[1:29:55] but all
[1:29:57] the day. Oh, give him praise right now.
[1:29:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:30:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:30:07] Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah. Glory. Yes, Lord.
[1:30:15] Some through the flood.
[1:30:18] Oh, some through
[1:30:21] great trials,
[1:30:23] but on
[1:30:26] heaven.
[1:30:28] Oh,
[1:30:29] some through
[1:30:31] great sorrow.
[1:30:34] But God gives us a song.
[1:30:39] Oh,
[1:30:41] the night season
[1:30:44] and all the day long.
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:51] Oh, hallelujah.

[1:31:00] message this morning?

[1:31:15] for that. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How

[1:31:19] many want to be led of him this morning?
