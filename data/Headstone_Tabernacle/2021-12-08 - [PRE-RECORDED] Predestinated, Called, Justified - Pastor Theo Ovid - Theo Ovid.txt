greetings in the name of jesus it's good to be here this morning welcome to one and all those connected to us life god bless you so this morning if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to habakkuk chapter 2 we want to read verse 1 to 4. hebrews 10 we want to read from verse 35 to 39 and romans 8 from 28 to 31 it's great to feel the presence of life you know amidst this morning the presence of god oh my hallelujah habakkuk 2 was one i will stand upon my watch and set me up on the tower and watch to see what he will see unto me and what i shall answer when i'm reproved and the lord answered and answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that readed it for the vision as yet for an appointed time but at the end the child speak and not lie do tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith and from hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 amen it says cast not away there for your confidence which had great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the judge shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we hallelujah and not of them who draw back on the peridition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul and our last scripture from romans chapter 8 and reading from verse 28 to 31 and we know we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are be called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us let's pray father we have read your word we feel fire on your word and for this little period of time may just rock it into our hearts lord write your words and your thoughts into us this morning and fill us with your spirit and jesus let me ask it amen you can have your seats and give the lord a shout as you sit down there is something to shout about this morning oh praise god hallelujah i like that rumbling i'm hearing praise this is inspiring you're inspiring me hallelujah i like that rumbling side of there that means corona virus a pinyidong praise god social distance in a ruffle your spirit oh glory to god wearing masks and washing your hands that are messier oh glory still alive and kicking them heroes of faith the wonders in deserts and in caves they were tortured and all kind of stuff praise god hallelujah and god give something better for us that day without us not made perfect oh glory to god hallelujah praise god we haven't got you nothing yet coronavirus come in that god is the other thing to come oh glory to god i'm worse than that to come but guess what coming also sons of god coming too oh glory to god because the bible said when the enemy coming like a flood like a flood not the little rain though like a flood when the enemy without a flood we have seen that yet when we have seen that yet but whenever the enemy decides to come like a flood the spirit got a lie the spirit god cannot lie the spirit will raise a standard against him oh glorious war has started here now this war started in 2021 this war started before there was a moon this war started in heaven oh glory to god michael fought and the dragon fought and we continue to battle down here oh give the lord our praise that trust should be blessed understand this morning oh glory to god you may be seated the title this morning is predestinated called unjustified predestinated called justified and we know who he justified he already glorified isn't that right another inspiration the revival of the justified oh glory to god the revival of the justified you're going to find out what justified is justified is not forgiven justified as if you never did it you want to tell me god justify me and i ain't going to shout i ain't going dance i ain't gonna have a jubilee oh go who you thought you he called all glory to god and he predestinate you to be in this hour you could have been luther's age you could be in wesley [Applause] [Music] glory to god before i had my children god saw my grandchildren [Music] they was already on their way before i even had my own children that's what god has predestinated he just see way down why what is the purpose of having a vision the purpose of having a vision is to show you something when it is not yet that's the purpose of a vision it is not yet but it will be so therefore our vision always have an appointed time [Applause] [Music] so if god gave you a vision of your healing a vision of your breakthrough a vision of your baptism holy ghost a vision of your adoption all of that is to tell you it's coming [Music] [Applause] and the just shall live by his faith not by your feelings [Music] because the vision could be completely contrary to your feelings you may be seated one time brother branham had a vision of killing a grizzly tip beer and when he's had to walk and say he's gonna get it somebody said look at the grass you could see for miles there's no beard here it cannot have any beard you say if god said that i go kill a brisley beer in this environment when they grasp all or god is able to make and produce and have a beer right there next minute when they look they see a big bear standing there figure that one out well i ain't figuring out nothing if god said there's gonna be a bright revival there's gonna be a bright revival if god said they're gonna be healing blind night will pop open going to walk so i'm going to speak they're going to hear it must have death people to bust their ears open it must have dumb people that god going to have to speak [Applause] must have blind people to see oh give the lord a shout i know what's coming oh glory to god he's a right division make it plain oh glory to god you have to see it you have to talk about it it's coming oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory so let's go god help me this morning whoo [Music] let's talk a little bit about joseph story of joseph just a little tiny bit about joseph love of the father love so much that the father makes them a quote of many colors and you know from the humanistic realm it looked like we would see the father favored jesus you know joseph was that he spotted child he wasn't the foolish he wasn't he's second he wasn't deterred he was somewhere down on the road and the father kind of curry favors we would see and whatnot but when you look a little deeper you would realize jose's brother's spirit were off it was always off before the father made code for jesus before the father do what he did for joseph those brothers didn't even know how off they were it took joseph's vision and dreams to expose the spirit that was in them because that is what was in them jealousy was in them but they had nothing to jealous yet so they're just brethren because nobody's staring nobody's stepping out in perfection nobody's stepping out a class act all by themselves nobody step out with authenticity all glory to god they couldn't have nothing to compare themselves with but when joseph walked a certain way talk a certain way live a certain way in so much his father put a blessing upon him then brothers had to watch him kotai had i and i am telling you when god put his touch upon you come on now don't hold back now don't hold back now you're telling what's coming oh glory to god because god for you what's in you do you get where i'm going this morning and who is on you he called oh somebody was saying if you watch that robot don't seem that was given to jose it represented the holy spirit that covered his being and today it's the holy spirit that covers the church the robe of many colors so all that was just a type to represent the elect in this last day getting the robe of many colors favored by the father not because you're doing you're so nice but then brothers messed up and you will expose all the more messed up oh my hallelujah let's continue so watch god was eternal he had attributes and endear represents the word of god which has made flesh and dwell among us now this fellow here the woman of the world the priest the pharisee and where you see he said grace and salvation in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us three stages it was attribute first in god the thought as him being a human and that transmitted him down to jesus watch and therefore there's only one form of eternal life and that's god you have to be part of god at the beginning not what you choose down here is he chose you so that's why you say all that the father had given me will come say they say ton you could do what you want all that the father had given me will come you could lie to them you could try to deceive them with all that the father had i'm not talking about no he gives at me before oh glory to god do you see that now now look at this priest here we find out there's a priest now do you remember the long tall heart everybody respect him this is priest now this man with bible and scroll this is priest now he often sacrificed this is priest we're talking about now but listen to this watch he said no uh all right so the priest now we find his bottom part here is back life behind him predestination back day is sinful so in front in the world with his long gong and nice shoes and polish shoes and well polished and everything else tall cap and everything else he is he's the priest everybody will come to him the government will call him out they want to hear him out his predestination is sinful now watch no no no no no outside represent purity he was a priest he was an honorable man that presented this right now this woman one of the well her first life she was a prostitute she was mad up but way down here i know when the messiah come when jesus came he manifested the torts it's the torch now the priest with only intellectual learning called jesus the devil he's in humanistic realm he's using his senses and his senses saying you're not with us you are devil your word i we don't believe that so you're off you're a devil but this woman when the word was interpreted to her she called him what i perceived that what a prophet isn't that right so watch the priest with only intellectual learning said it's the devil because what is the nomination called it what did he do he had no representation so it blocked him out since only when a manifestation comes it has an effect it light you up or block you out that way if i didn't come you know you claim it to be light now that i come you're walking in darkness because the light has come so it's only when a manifestation come oh glory everything begins to expose right there you don't know who is who oh glory to god hallelujah but the manifestation will be the interpretation so god going to manifest and declare you oh glory to god who who are we talking about who he for knew who he predestinate who he called and who he justified oh god and you're gonna get a revelation of your justification you're gonna get an experience of your justification oh glory to god because justification means that there is nothing against you oh give the lord a praise offering therefore you are joseph perfection the capstone word that's a revelation you know not jacob grace oh glory to god let's continue now so when he spoke to the woman he said you told the truth because you had five and the one you have now is not your husband watch something happen look life now if she hadn't had listen representation by predestination it would have never take a hole she had what representation by predestination so she's a wrong sinner on the earth everybody can see her life and a behavior but she had representation by predestination she herself didn't even know that but the light had to come to her to expose her representation by predestination she thought in life all she was was a stinking prostitute but when jesus come he come to bring light and when the light shine on her not the front part the back part that where he turned this where the devil didn't want the servants you to break you know it's not the front part the fun part you're a smoker you're a drinker you're a liar cheat you had this that's the front part but the back part which is the gene part which is the attribute part which is the part that connects you back to elohim which is the thought oh lord that path oh hallelujah that is what the light come to activate that's why i don't care what the children doing right now i look at the pipe and coke right now if they're smoking dope right now brother when that blood hung of the holy ghost be going to ride after them glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated remember one of the brothers those believers came to the branham time knockout service somebody stole imanca oliman family thing inside hika going to the prophet to tell him what he lost somebody stole his cat they were stealing kansas a lot in those times and the problem began to pray or when he began to pray he saw a vision he saw the man driving he saw the holy spirit arresting the the man pulling aside he saw how much how much how much how far he went how much gas in his tank conviction arrest man you tell me god can arrest your son lock him up and bring him back home what do you think god did to us we were in bondage and he take and deliver us from out of the hands of the enemy god went and bust the hand of satan break the bonds of wickedness over you know you have the liberty to express your love for god satan is a liar this morning that's why we had to worship god we know what we worship woman y'all are coming always come on help me preach somebody we're the true worshipers we'll worship the father no burying or kill me dead in this message oh glory to god hallelujah no body anger no man no deacon no church strike me with death [Music] [Applause] let me see ii peter 1 20 the bible says knowing this verse that no prophecies of of the scripture is of private interpretation for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the holy ghost so from wisdom versus faith say no no he tries to make the word say something knowledge wisdom reasoning wisdom finds a better way there's no other way but god's way wisdom tries to point out and say well you see we ought to do we couldn't do that and this time we must do it anyhow tries to find an easy way tries to make the bible say things it does not that is what wisdom does try to make the bible or the message or the word say something it did not say let's continue wait a moment we go back to the seed again what was the devil trying to do with wisdom make god's word say something that it didn't say he tried to make god's word say something that it didn't say so that's the way it comes today when they try to make god's word say something it doesn't say you say well brother branham you ain't got the right interpretation he said the bible said prophecy is of no private interpretation prophecy why why a is a private interpretation why the word of the lord came to the prophets it is to be interpreted by the prophet and as far as i know it have no malakai four and a half malakai for entry quarter mark on his son malakai for anybody else it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet and he and he only let me say it again good and he he only shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and have no scripture for man making that interpretation to what the prophet brought he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing oh glory to god what she said it is to be interpreted by the prophet it can't be an interpretation private the prophets already interpreted to you so the ministers and pastors was to bring light or bring it into a greater reality of what the prophet said not a new teaching not some new revelation but to bring to light what has been interpreted because no man can interpret the unwritten word the right rock it's like a prophet to interpret the unwritten word hallelujah i can't interpret on written word oh glory to god the mystery was sealed and it's like a prophet the angel to bring it on to the prophet put it on books and tapes and you will reveal it when you have reason to see it so what in the beginning was the word i'm going to skip down there so faith believes a god that can make me and can keep that book in order to make me live by so it cannot be like mistakes in it if god could keep us he can keep that word god keep that written word he have it just as he wanted it are no mistakes oh glory to god watch amen so let me read the scripture from romans 10. you could open it by if you want to find it from 17 uh okay sorry romans 10 it says so faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god and this scripture here uh from romans i believe therefore by the deeds of the law of verse 20 there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin and now the righteousness of god without the law is manifest being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all upon them that believe there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to be appropriation through fate in his blood to declare his righteousness for remission of his sins that are passed through the forbearance of god to declare i say all this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of them that believeth jesus where is the boast in them it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude paul that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law is he the god of the jews only is he not also the gentiles yes of the gentiles also see it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision true faith do we then make void the law through faith god forbid we establish the law then he said what shall we say then of abraham our father as but timothy the flesh had found if abraham were justified by works he had bear after glory but not before god but what saith the scripture what the scriptures say abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness his confession of faith in god god ticket off has been declared righteous oh glory to god he didn't have to do nothing he believed god all glory to god and god justified him god conquered his faith as righteous oh glory to god you love him this morning now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but of debt but to him that will get not but believe it on him that justified the ungodly his fate is counted for righteousness all right let's take that and shine a light and woman of the world now she's unrighteous her front part is sinful she's a prostitute and jesus come and release that woman as if she never did it oh glory to god she was so free she tell the whole village come see a man that told me all that i did isn't this the christ the other woman caught in adultery each other go and sin no more oh glory to god hallelujah all glory to god he could justify the ungodly because what is in the back of them is what is predestinated what is the back of them is what he for knew oh glory to god that's why nothing is too hard [Applause] that's why the question is is anything too hard [Applause] remember the scripture we read in the prayer meeting where the two blind man came to jesus there my two men who get baptized you know them i know two men who went jacket and thai come in the church you know no them just them just need healing that's all they want they come for church they come to be healed andrea said do you believe i can do this oh glory to god what he's trying to get he can't get faith inside of them if god if you believe then then keep walking but do you believe i can do this and he asks her is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed you tell me god can open your eye you can't tell me guaca heal your attitude condition you could you tell me guaca heal your womb god is god all things are possible to them that believe abram was the father of faith and he was the father of faith to produce the royal seed himself oh glory to god now we are in the faith royale we'll give the lord a shout my god this is a normal fate this is a barren man a barren woman believe in god and god said as the stars say so shall they see me [Music] may be seated [Music] i don't care of the whole messy world dead i ain't dying with them at all oh glory to god i don't care how much preacher is dead i ain't dying when i'm at all this message to alive this message going to live glory to god when god finished the first day the second day when he finished he was so good he rested glory to god he rested hallelujah and when god finished with that prophet he took him off the scene i know this is 54. 55 years i called out god only calling on people for something years oh who e4 he called he called him from the baptist church the methodist church he called him from sin he called it from what kind of condition he's calling many people come and they walk back because this net catch all kind of crab and snake and old fish but in that net have some rainbow trout rainbow trout and then rainbow trout the stream upstream did a swim against the current oh glory to god to everybody sliding down with the flow of things but as the stream goes this way rainbows are going up that way oh we're not taking the path of least resistance these signs shall follow them we go in there every place we put our foot we go in there same works i do shall you do also we go in there too if you shall say to the mountain we go in there too you cherish your power yes yes yes [Applause] after the holy ghost come upon you glory to god i'm backing down for nothing so many giants are gonna show you my sword so many giants are gonna show you my swing give the lord a shout before he had a goliath i had my sling oh give the lord some praises glory to god for every goliath you have a stone give the lord some praises oh you know god you talk about superchurch you talk about super race glory to god i feel like it this morning i feel like going to the super this morning oh glory to god super predestinated super cold super justified you know what justified is not like that braggart and boston you know that is you getting the revelation that is finished for you man oh glory to god hallelujah my god this ought to give everybody faith inside of here if you can't get excited about something wrong with you glory to god mary magdalena all them heading for the upper room they may even know some partying some fighting some dancing some flirting some fooling wrong but every one of them 120 of them elected to hit that upper room oh my hallelujah pastor going prophet going apostle going deacon going usher going there going believers go in man jack going in the upper room waiting on a promise he breathed upon them receiving the holy ghost which the devil will stop the breath of god [Applause] [Music] in the beginning when god said let there be light here nobody permission there was darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god move upon the face of the waters it already had season the earth the seas are already hidden waiting for light to come forth you know that seed was placed in you before the foundation of the world you were just staggering to this message [Music] this ought to make a baptist show you were just staggering to this message god elected you god sent you through your family yes that was not a mistake because through your family you're getting this [Applause] if you come to some other family you might be a good catholic but god set it up that this word will find you you didn't find it you know come on now come on now shout shout on that one you did not find it [Applause] you haven't looking for this message this message come looking for you oh glory to god marcilana i still never jump in me i still never shouting me i may be getting great but i still have a praise [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so how was this righteousness reckoned to abraham in circumcision on circumcision but in uncircumcision the bible said and it received the sign of circumcision and that sign was a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet been uncircumcised he was uncircumcised but god brings circumcision to confirm the faith that he had while he was uncircumcised and by your faith you are just a fact or give the lord a shout you can feel justified you got to believe [Music] did you get that did you get your cat feel for this [Music] you see the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the fate which he had been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised so you see all this circumcision that the jews was boasting of covenant people and we are the circumcised our neighbor was a father and jesus had to bust them because abraham had this faith before so then let's look up this drew thing this favored people thing it mashed that up so when christ come fights bring the cross there's neither jew nor gentile burn or free male or female all one and [Applause] this is not heresy this is weird all right and the father of the circumcision to them who are not of the sacrament only but also who walk in the steps of that fate of our father abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not the abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for every day which of the lord be heirs then faith is made void and the promises made of non-effect then we better get a temple and put an alternate guess and kill some goats and cows and different things he said if faith if the law is the thing that i do weak i qualify at all because we have no temple we have no temple priest you follow him saying so watch down now because the law will get right but there will no no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace so now this predestination come now as predestinated grace listen you should you should be praising god not suffering the preacher should be one to say re rest rest yourself you understand what we're seeing this morning this is the bible yeah now watch what therefore it is a fate that might be by grace to the end the promise might be to be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but that also which is of the fate of abraham who's the father of us all for it is written i have made thee a father many nations before him we believe even god who quick not the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who here we go this is your work now from today on this must

nut that man had to believe for himself and his wife too and the bible said he's tagged not he did not stagger i thought at the promise of god what was strong in faith people want us don't say dynamics coming we keep postponing it i ain't postponing nothing the vision is for an appointed time that is why we have a prophetic vision that is why we have a seven-tone division that is why we have a serious vision we not move in until it materialized don't give the lord a shout [Applause] [Music] he staggered not at the promise of god to unbelief but was strong in faith what that strength did giving glory to god not dumb like a dumb dog in israel he was strong in faith and anytime you get strong and fit praises will come on your lips not complaining praises praises praises you i get to break you yet but you're president you're in prison you're still bound up but you're president you're second body but you're president because you know he's a healer you know he's a deliverer you know he's a baptizer you know he can't lie we know you're gonna bring the god of the history [Music] [Applause] god the prophet said man i am gone healing is not gone so therefore everybody here could be healed this morning [Music] because brother branham was not the healer give the lord some prayer says give the lord some praises glory to god if jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and he is here in our mix he could heal you this morning do you believe i can do this thing oh come on now jesus talkin [Music] he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong and fit giving glory to god and verse 21 and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform aya man say we need your next william branham i differ with that we don't need the next william branham we had that elast has already come what we need is the prophet's prophecy we are not willing to come back to do what he did his job we are here now we have a job to do this what jesus did and continue to do [Applause] oh glory to god i feel inspired this morning i feel i'm part of a bunch of people they're getting a revelation that they're called to continue their work [Music] [Applause] we're going to write another book of acts [Applause] let's script down quickly this is from galatians 3 22 and the scripture concluded all under sin that the promise of faith of jesus christ might be given to all and believe not some under sin not the jews spirit no all all of us same plaque for all all stink or rotten all deserve to go to hell that the promise could be given to all hallelujah remember all of them was under moses messenger all of them had moses books and quotes and tips but all them didn't really believe it only affect upon joshua and caleb the rest of them was killing time so the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise of faith of jesus might be given to them that believe but before faith came before this faith came because you need fear to be justified hallelujah before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the fate which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our school master to bring us to christ that we might be justified by faith so your good nice works your goody two shoes works cannot justify you you could wear your wear your top to the choke up here where you're dressing and sweep the floor wear shades on your eye and cover your head with the bonnet that nobody lost after you oh glory to god that still doesn't justify you glory to god never lie never cheat yourself going to hell if you don't repent that doesn't justify you brand new tie shoot that doesn't justify you all glory it will be filthy and seven thunder gets fit so this is a revival of the justify [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah god is about to unlock heaven the same voice that shut the heavens that same voice going to unlock the heavens i hear the song of the abundance of red dynamics to the mechanics signs wonders miracles all glory to god hallelujah [Music] and then paul says here for as many of you that have been baptized into christ have put on christ then hear the bomb there is neither jew nor greek there is neither one nor free there is neither male nor female but you are all one in christ jesus and if you be in christ then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to promise you hear that when you understand you are heir you're not going to beg you're going for what is yours what you have been what have been paid for you're going for inheritance healing his mind is that could i break you that's mind too joy but that that is my thing i don't want to be like a sovereign man give me some joy give me some peace all these things are mine give the lord a shout do you see what we're talking about [Music] so i want an aggression in your spirit and your heart and your mind towards the things that belongs to you the secret things belongs to god but the things that are revealed it belongs to us and to our children that we might do the words of the lord once it reveals minds satan can't touch it satan can't come in here this morning he can't touch your blessing here this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] every service we fighting you know [Music] that's why there's atmosphere in the church because the blood is being preached the word is the blood the blood is the word and once the blood is upon you the spirit is upon you i can shut you up here this morning you know right now you have a perfect standing through the blood god hasn't even seen you on your mistakes god has seen you and your failures god has seen you in your condition when you look don't you it's bloody see you perfect perfect standing your state is not perfect yet [Applause] [Music]

god drop a dream on him i said every woman shot up in this house restore until the prophet his wife the king said but he tell me this he said that might be so that's why i come to talk to you you better give that man back his wife not only that let him pray for you too oh give the lord a shout let me let me shake about that you know people come in for you to pray for them you think listen go go have them come and and for you to pray for them you know that is the position god gonna put the bride in give me a word he said men and woman the world will bow at the feet of men and women who cross jordan my god i could feel the holy spirit sparking off flying off the sons and daughters of the living god anointed and commissioned oh glory glory help me [Applause] jesus you understand when the holy spirit when the prophet said you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting the answer lord and once you know the angel there he said i take every spirit under my control in other words not a demon move since until i say so at that point in time brother branham is on top of satan's kingdom every sickness under his feet every spirit under him the the holy ghost is reigning over every life [Applause] that means anybody could be healed because the spirit the holy ghost is dominating the atmosphere oh glory the prince of the power of the air is bound by circumstance [Applause] i take every spirit every spirit under my control [Music] oh god my church come on church [Applause] what powerful teaching is he being christ in the abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise then in

hit yourself and hurt yourself i'm bored like 40 000. he said god sent me ahead you see the maturity now you see how we grow if he wasn't mature he said they made it i'll go beat them one by one no no he not on that beat all your abusers when i was small you're too wicked no no no there's no time for that he grew past that father forgive them they they clueless they don't know what they're doing they send me to my destiny and now by revelation i know i was sent ahead of them to preserve life brothers live it have grain for me it have grain for you it have blessings for me it's our blessings for you the spirit and the bride sick of oh glory to god i'm having myself a time this morning i'm gonna preach myself happy oh glory to god hallelujah now watch there's only two he said two forces two two things wisdom versus fate and not god the ways i'm talking about now the wisdom that put people from the word he said there's only two sources we can draw our life from just two one of them is wisdom and the other is fate now fate was introduced and wisdom was introduced in genesis and satan is the order of wisdom trying to get the people to accept his wisdom and pull them away from the faith that in god's word notice what the devil tell eve if you eat of this tree god know you will be wise and all he has to do was believe god said so and i said tell your story working satan my husband but when she hear wisdom when she had the knowledge that he was supposed to reveal to her she bought to that and that's how we get messed up all right now god is the order of fate satan is the ought of wisdom god gave his children his word told them they must believe this and put a debt separation punishment if they feel they believe it satan comes a wrong and offer eve wisdom you will be wise knowing right from wrong see now of course anything that the devil has is a perversion of the original so the wisdom that i want you to get straight note before we start there is a wisdom of god and the wisdom of god is to stay with his word but satan in his wisdom tried to twist the word so that the that's the wisdom i'm speaking about so watch there's a certain amount of faith that goes with satan to accept satan you have to believe satan is a perfective fate so he said you don't want to revert refer to it as satan's fate so he referred to it as wisdom not satan's fate all right now there are children on either side on the wisdom side and on the faith side and if the faith of god came true god and god is the word god's children lives on faith the josh shall live not by wisdom [Music] but they're just saved by faith and faith come i hear in the word so the children on the faith side they believe the word they connect with the word are you with me oh glory to god hallelujah so there are so many people today that has the right knowledge that knows that this word should be god's word and this is god's word but they stand and let some seminary student reason them out of it away from the holy spirit and away from the things of god oh glory to god so faith has no reason faith doesn't know what reason is oh glory to god when abraham was told to offer by zach abraham told the man i am the lord we go up i like come back down he ain't think twice god tell him go and offer up your son you know but he tell them man we're going up we're going back down and when he tied isaac on the altar he was coming with a knife the angels were called twice abram holy hand hold on and because though has obeyed my voice he gave that promise upon abram and our sacrifice was laying right there iran was in the ticket already caught yes he got to run him down so if you say lord i waited to see the romney ticket a hole in my son yes you know i'm going to ticket her you got to go up there tie up on your all time come down with the knife do you hear what i say if you wait and you see i am moving till rhyming ticket wait that will go tell you that is your interpretation you supposed to obey god he said off him up off him up oh glory to god so abraham you yeah right when you are prayed for and accept god's word for healing don't reason with your feelings oh glory to god isn't that right don't reason with nothing else that settles it by stripe i'm healed by stripe i'm healed by shape i'm healed extra extra my shame i'm healed oh glory to god amen hallelujah praise god so life is in the grain again watch this army visit you in the brain and the church the same word sucked up trudies come through out here into our head and all the life that come through here picked up its people and is forming into a head for the rapture so the life itself through all the seven ages picks up his people you hear that the life come to pick up its people the life have its people so if you are part of god's people life will pick you up quickening power will quicken you up isn't that right watch so watch now something well you are separated from the first union by spiritual debt now you are born again or remarried to a new spiritual union your old book is gone you're all union now your name has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me my old book god put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before god i didn't expect because your faith had to catch that he put it in the sea of his forgetfulness not your forgetfulness because you remember all the way you do but thank god is his forgetfulness thank god you have that that he have a forgetfulness that when a god inside of that he and all can remember [Music] you may remember remember some of the things i've done but jesus with his special blood forgive me of everyone oh glory to god hallelujah you pick me up turn me around place my feet on higher ground jesus dropped the charges oh now i'm free dung in my soul he dropped the charges jesus dropped the charges although i was wrong hallelujah are you with me now he's going to drop your charges and put it where in his sea if you don't forget if you're i want you don't forget that thing today it have he is see of his forgetfulness your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life would the lamb redeem not the old book of your natural union but you are new bride your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate where your true eternal dream from the beginning takes hold no here we go there's a part i want to get to almost done now you are not only forgiven but you are justified justified look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word mean justified it don't mean forgive me for instance if i got drunk and done some evil things and everything you come around and said you found it i didn't do them didn't you come around and say but abraham i forgive you forgive me i didn't do it in the first place but if i did do it i'm guilty and you could forgive me but i won't be guilty and yet i'm not justified because i actually done it but the word justified is though you've never done it i don't think the people get this yet you know i don't think the people getting there your self-condemnation and self-pity and you wallowing in your past and what that doesn't help your faith whatsoever oh glory to god hallelujah watch the word justify is though you've never done it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in god's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even the memories of god did you hear that this is enough to bust up the ceiling you know and repair it next week you know this is not even the memories of god you are justified it was accused you was accused but you never did it the old union is in the sea of forgetfulness you wasn't married here to begin with he the bridegroom brought your shame he took your place you were predestinated for him to be in his bride [Music] [Applause] [Music] here is why this justification is so clean he said you were deceiving to it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent evil it's no fault of your own your natural birth you come after evil commit adultery that's the reason you were born an adulteress you are sinner to begin with you will deceive into it it ain't your fault that's right easy for justification to come to you because adam didn't fall we was not going to be in the state oh glory to god suffer goes to restore us back to eden he had to make a provision for justification as if you never did it not just forgiven [Applause] so god put it there by predestination you were for ordained a son of god you and god before the foundation of the world you're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand by every word the anointed word of his day of which you are apart by predestination you immediate when you hear it you know right then you was an eagle he the bridegroom take away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the world that's why i'm saying i'm the son of ella branham he said whose son of i know oh glory to god mother sinful father sinful but no i'm a son of god whose son am i now oh glory to god hallelujah watch that first husband you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water you stand completely justified as though you never did it in the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air mission come on please missing he said where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from them shocks get out into the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the comment of the combine you are standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place you talk about that thanksgiving i am more thankful for that than anything else and listen to this pronouncement you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god and every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ believes every word stands as though you've never sinned in the first place what a word this morning glory to god hallelujah it was supposed to die in the morning a man took my place i cannot die for that sin i was supposed to die a man took my place i cannot go and die again for that jesus took all her sins went on the cross died and says finish and free you to live the abundant life oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god you are standing completely you never sinned at the first place god didn't even know it it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but rarely from the beginning you were predestinated to be the son and daughter of god you are standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead you are the virtuous bride of jesus christ washed in the blood of jesus christ precious sinless son of god standing with pure unadulterated bright word oh glory to god my let me just finish at the home stretch here now so these two sources you might call atmospheres and see what they create you say let's follow these two sources wisdom and fate knowledge and feet let's follow them a few minutes atmospheres of these sources these two sources create an atmosphere hallelujah knowledge creator atmosphere and faith create an atmosphere that's in every church oh glory to god some churches is knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge and the people have a second head hallelujah oh glory to god and somewhere preach faith to have a certain atmosphere where you could believe anything could happen where you can believe all things are possible where you can believe he's still a healer he says he still have a paisa [Applause] [Music] watch this i want to ask you something did you ever go to a church did you ever go to a church where the pastor is real starchy the congregation is the same way what is it is the atmosphere that brought it go into a place where the person says now wait a minute there's no such thing as as the holy ghost you will see every one of them if there's an eagle in there somewhere he will get out oh you mean i'm eager to fly all them groups and them churches when they begin the city life they have to they can't help it oh glory to god you can't buy your eagle and tell them how old he goes it will never mind being a pulpit come on now we chew that outside to the first age second is nickelodeon spirit we kicked that out a long time some man trying to rule over the congregation god is a god of the audience he want to be among his people men are conducted to bring god to the people not to bring more man to the people oh give the lord a shout you know battle with number six a long time hallelujah he said no watch if there's an eagle in there somewhere he will get out from among the bunch of chickens watch watch now we find out that those atmospheres those things where faith is taught at church you'll find the church and that happens oh god he said let me get this to you if you could see it that's the reason people come among the scenes when they're praying paul said he didn't find any in the city only timothy that was like precious fate the rest of them was all the nominations but when he got into that atmosphere you find things going on that's the atmosphere was created you find people living by faith when you get into a place where it says my the bible is true god heals you walk around that congregation why i was then a cancer i was healed i was once blind i see the stranger said whoa you see what i mean what was the matter with you i can show you on record come home with me come eat dinner with me i will show you i got a record my neighbor now i was in a i was paralyzed for years and i was prayed for and that's the church we're talking about believers has created the atmosphere way too many believers yes like you yes create an atmosphere that the sick can't stay sick the blind can't stay blind [Applause] [Music] no how is the word in simplicity but in its completeness ever going to grow in a place where knowledge overshadows that it can't be so so where knowledge is preached from a seminary the children die where faith is preached from the word the children live that's the difference just life and death the same thing happened to god in the eden that's exactly what happened with them to atmosphere when eve got off the right one the wrong one she died and they cannot say if your church has got that kind of atmosphere if you want to live you believe the word you want to hear a bomb the seed word cannot grow in the accuracy of knowledge [Applause] [Music] so they can preach mystery till they blew in the face unless an atmosphere of faith a breakthrough dear that would bring the praises upon the people's lips [Applause] you see the seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere of knowledge eve said the lord god the day we eat that day we die right but satan said but listen dear you love little things surely god made you of a people you know that's right you're a woman you made for purpose what you don't know it but you were made for this purpose you love little thing there look at those dainty little hands well you would not surely die you think that good loving father god would do such a thing like that what she do she listened to reason took his wisdom a tree of delight one desired of it and as soon as you fall for it it finished right there you see the sea she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of god through a spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait and she went into that so you see as soon as she accepted satan wisdom she died isn't that right and if wisdom is with the word that proves it to be with the word and the word produces itself that's that that's fine but the holy ghost sees of the bible here we go this is our next bomb cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom oh glory that kills every seminary that knocks the holes right off to them and punctures them [Applause] glory four was a mystery see that growing nothing yes people have a big head hallelujah she wasn't supposed to listen to anybody oh my and you talk about this you know we could see 500 rush to the author tonight that would be a good sign the revival is about to break we don't have to have 500 at the altar we just have to take god's word and start rejoicing something will happen that brings the world to life when we water it with praises that's why the devil fights all these shouting and the praising and the hallelujah in the church devil don't want that because once you start to get your prayers it's going up you see when you're in sin you can't praise god you know you're heavy but when you accept the promise and you see god promise me the holy ghost oh my god i didn't actually promise you no god come down in love and say i've given you this i give you that i've given you think about it you're living in some old shack and some rich uncle come and say listen i have a house for you here i have a hotel for you here i'm a backpack over here and you're there like it's true yeah oh god do you really mean it i didn't ask for it you know jesus died and tell me all is his mind you know he dropped the key of faith and said unlock the door wherever do you see lock up just turn the key open the door [Applause] listen all the things we are claiming satan have no access to he is jealous this morning could never be a son he could never be a heir he already fallen his sentence is already judged he had everything later fire we headed for a millennium come on now come and preach back to me somebody let me see let me see what brings the world to life when you water the world with praises what makes a seed grow water what makes the word of god grow is the praises of [Music] [Applause] if they god hear it hear it now that's why when john saw the lamb take the book he said all in heaven all under the earth heard i praise god what is it kingdom worship and lucifer himself i've been fighting this all these years but he is defeated [Applause] [Music] you may be seated what do you think what do you think what made god god what is what god means object of worship why didn't lucifer get jealous in heaven for the worship that was given to god he wanted that for him and the angels that represented us up there said no he made a coin heaven and hooked some angels with a steel hallelujah lie and god didn't leave him up there with his foolishness he gave me boots and he comes straight down on it and the bathrooms are becoming backloved men and we still fighting and we have dominion over nations and kingdoms and peoples but not the bride all shall worship him that fell on the eight whose names are not written but if your name is written you're going to worship king lamb you're going to worship jesus christ [Applause] [Music] the bible says if you commit those seed into the ground like a farmer from a plant to see to dig it up and dig it up and put it back down no he commits into the ground he said now that's the same weight as with the word of god if you take the divine promise god mean his bible into your heart and water it every day with praises of god that is going to come to pass it will grow faith could grow faith could ripen say it could mature see it does say small he's small he's molly [Applause] [Music] we're almost finished just to my coast i'm done we do good eliezer come for bride fire isaac he said lady damsel that water asked me to give me water for my camel give me water and what the camel let that be one for isaac all them nicest is passing the one straight looking up look him down he's an old man you know young man that they're interested in for her marriage but you see you don't know who you're treating you don't know who you're respecting your behavior when rebecca come she said the manchester united in the draw nothing i go help you and she finished sorry he might say i want to go by your hopes anybody said the same camel rebecca water was the same coming to take her to exactly the same car she put the gasoline in the same car [Music] you know your muslim sisters regret their gas up that car your mother said regret there and put water that water that camel rebecca water that camel and the prophet says and this beast was being watered rebecca water in the same beach he wrote on taken away to her placed our new home is the type of the church today watering and blessing the same holy spirit is going to lift us up and take us to a new home he said how do you water it with praises with worship final quote bubba is praying on the indictment he said god be merciful to us at this time you know take us lord mold us take me make me with them you can play something he said i want to go to calvary lord by faith with this congregation just mold me overlord i did wrong you didn't have people talking about that no more because i did wrong many times he said recently i just was going to quit preaching the people wouldn't hear me they just kept on doing the same thing i got discouraged i built a complex oh god a couple of sundays ago you give me a sign out here and reading the bible you stole moses just in a dream was there's a mountain that would be assigned to him and then right at the end of it to know i had left a lot of sick people a ministry not only the prophetic but in teaching the word and praying for the sick you let a man drop dead right on the floor then brought him back to life for a confirmation that it was true you always confirm your word no lord confirm it right now while i'm before the throne take every one of these people lord take the
