church with a big dish is a big leader when the time the token time comes that is all God asking for not asked him was books in your home so much Bible read on my time you pray is the token that is

a lectern to take notes you could take notes when they go home and listen back to the tape when you come here there's I'm gonna get in the spirit glory I can't see it like the profit but the token my god he said something yeah it's must be eaten already dressed people ready for the journey must apply the token it pleases God amen and this is something that he that struck me the blood shall be talking to you a token of calling the website is insane a price have been peed a token me is a sign a price I've been paid he didn't access see when you kill the lamb all he asks is the token and people are happy that man say I'll build bigger bands I will expand the business and Shawn he said Oh fool tonight you're surely required of thee they still after after token please go your clock to have it you have to have a burden fear it's not what you think of what you feel and you've seen it so it doesn't matter you see in it is what God said God said when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you and you have to be written to be blood washed but to be blood covered to be talking anointed you have to be burden for that stop fussing with your husband get their token stop fussing with your wife get their token so fussing with your children get the token we've got the top is the most important thing for your life hallelujah not some man that some woman as a husband not some like the token not even money they talkin money will perish but the token is eternal the topper is a ticket it glory to God about close with these words the Prophet said and we talk about the bull right he was fast you just feel he left his gun and he had his killable that he forgot about and he said if you are remembered and he had the gun he was gonna shoot the bull and then pay for the ball but he didn't have the gun God allow him to forget the gun and when he was confronted with the bull and a bull started his ball run something came over him that was the token that was the love that was the bull language the speakable language that they bull can understand or glory to God that that that love could speak to the bees it could speak to the bird it could speak the cancer it could speak the tumor it can speed to missing limbs it could speak to what is missing they can speak to whatever their condition is that's the power of love or glory to God don't don't it don't question it it's power that's what make Christ come in the air it was the power of love for God so loved the world gave His only begotten Son it was the power of love he cannot give up a new array but his love constraining the hunters and refrained us and to redeem us and to pull us out and to pull us out thus in his love is what did that and we have to express that same love what manner of love is this that we could be called the sons of God or you have a right to shop this morning just to be called the sons of God what a privilege what our honor is not a right it's a privilege it's an honor to be called the sons of God hallelujah glory to God as we said already when no one would walk toward a woman at a well Jesus had the finer because her name is on the book love had to Redeemer law couldn't do it beating her up couldn't do it was a nine person can do it but when love came walking love did it and that songwriter so inspired said love lifted me when nothing else could help love lifted me I was sinking deep in sin from the peaceful sure Oh glory to God hallelujah but love lifted me may the love of Gordon lift you up this morning this message is real God send a true prophet I beg your century prophet with Tashia the Lord look a lonely died and going on and the word and I alone on the word is prophecy that's thought to be fulfilled I believe something great and dynamic going to break oh this week this weekend here but this revival will be under hell I believe there's something gonna happen something that you're longing for thirsting for hunger and floor crying for Oh hallelujah may God bless you the hunger and thirst after righteousness you shall be filled oh my let's all stand I'd wanna go straight into the message this is a token from Bakersfield the 8th of February 1964 praise the Lord amen as we read tonight from the 12th day right feed the word remember tomorrow can you that right but you know where I means 50 miles of the road and the book of Exodus we read tonight from the 12th chapter of Exodus and the 12th verse and the 13th verse I'll be to be nice if we stood while we read the word and respects to go Exodus 12 12 or I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be unto you for a token upon the house where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt as far our heads father God we pray tonight we'll examine our self and see if the blood is sufficiently an insight as we speak on my word may the Holy Spirit guidance in Jesus name he may be sealed [Music] our scripture reading tonight takes us back in Exodus Exodus is a outgoing Anglet this we are all to play with the time and for the context I'm going to take the subject of the token a token what is a token a token is a sign of that a price has been paid like a railroad company or a bus fare when they run a bus line you go in many of the cities still haven't you can our ticket is a token if you go to a railroad company an airplane company and buy a ticket it isn't the money that you can give in when you go it's the token your ticket are you a little token that you have shows that you have purchased a required price they require a certain price and this price has been paid in a subject we're sinking overnight God's requirement for Israel requirement of Jehovah was the blood of the land that was his requirement and it was to be for a token the token shows that the requirement had been met that what God had required had been met what the railroad requires the token shows has been met your fare is paid you're ready to get on the train plane bus whatever it is but you must have the token you can't go on without the token maybe the companies will not receive your cash when you go out the airplane walk out there I want pay my ticket you go get your ticket first you must have the ticket and just the token is what you must hold the money itself will not work you must have the token the life was gone out from the sacrifice and now the blood was a token his orders had been carried out that's what it wasn't Egypt that dreadful night just before death struck the last play God had showed his great signs and wonders in Egypt long-suffering the kindness the favor on all these it sent many great signs through the land instead of a prophet showing signs and wonders of pillow fire all of you did and yet all the he did yet they would not repent it would not come to God they ignored all of his signs they ignored his prophet they ignored the message they wanted their own way so God had been fed up with him so he said I'm going to make a separation now between those who do believe in those who do not believe I think we're living in that time now where God's making a choice man will believe our they won't believe and God required a token this token was an innocent lamb that he had substituted for death in the Garden of Eden and now when the lamb was killed the blood was to be placed upon the doorpost and all the little and it was a to show that the requirement had been carried out oh I think that's a great lesson for us as we look at it seated leading worship as he was identified by the token of the blood he had there the believer had to get the lamb slay the lamb a lamb for a house take the blood with wasup which is just a little brush it grows up there in the country and a common weeds we'd call it and had to apply the blood it shows by the applying of the blood with this possum possum represents faith many times people think they have to have some supernatural faith to be a believer it isn't the hustle speaks for that this common weeds that you could get it anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood and apply the blood the blood tonight is applied by simple faith just not nothing supernatural it's right around you everywhere just simply like a child reach out to get a hold of it and apply the blood the hustle is just a simple childlike faith for the believer it isn't something how do you reach you don't have to reach very far to get it this hosta that grows in that country it grows out of the crack to the walls a little kind of a diamond shaped leaf you can pick it up anywhere justice as grass or weeds would be and in the country here now just pick it up why put it on the door that's the way faith is to be applied take faith I rather and apply the blood of Jesus Christ by faith to the heart's door this was going to separate and make the difference between those who were going out of Egypt and those who were going to stay in Egypt and perish with Egypt it made the difference strange how God always works through signs signals tokens and so forth he always has done it that's his way of doing anything he never does it outside of it God never makes a move until he does it and that way the way God starts that's the way God finishes he's infinite omnipotent omnipresent omniscient he needs nobody's help he doesn't need our interpretation I was said last night he doesn't need us to interpret the word and say what it means he speaks what it says it'll do that's the interpretation nobody has to interpret it when God says let it be it is that's his interpretation of it we might say the days of miracles is past there is no such a thing is about just the Holy Spirit a man who believes it God speaks to you in and that's the interpretation it got it that's they know they had that because God gives his own interpretation to his word that's what he was requiring that night to separate the believers from the unbelievers the believer worshiper was identified with his sacrifice he must apply the blood it wasn't taking till the lamb set the blood out there somewhere keep it in a charger take it down to the neighbors he had to apply the blood that's way it is tonight we could come and sympathize with everything God does that is what he requires you've got to apply it's not sufficient until you apply the blood must be applied that shows that you are identified a worshipper ladies hand upon the lamb and then kill it identify himself in the sacrifice the same thing we do to nicely our hand upon our sacrifice and identify herself with him and he is the word we have to be identified only through Christ as when we were identified by the word because he is the word always has been in the beginning was the word a Word was with God and the Word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever so much word is lauded each generation God sent someone in there and identifies that word by his interpretation of himself Creed's and things has always had the churches such a term off everybody said with this is oil and this is a way and this is what you must do but God comes in steps on the scene and makes what he said come to pass that's the interpretation needs nobody to tell not sinful man our organizations are any great big denomination or anything else to interpret the word Sun Bishop Archbishop Pope or something that isn't it God does his own interpreted when he promised that he does it I've said many times when he said let there be light and there was life that's the interpretation it doesn't need any more to anything else to try to interpret it God it drips itself this blood being applied and identified worshipper identified himself with the blood by applying it in his own house over the door where he could not go out or come in without being recognized by the blood very perfect type of the day of the blood of Jesus Christ then the blood was a token of identification Christ is a token of the identification of a believer today animal life lamb days the reason they had to apply the chemical blood take it up on pasta place it up on the doorpost in the rental is because that animal the worshipper that put his hands and identified himself with the animal the life that was in the animal could not return back of all the worship because the animal doesn't have a soul he doesn't better he self at all we find out today that we man although fallen this fallen state we build our houses better we've got build a better car we take what God has created pervert it and turn it into something to help herself it goes to show that we are sons of God in our fallenness state yet we have a soul we cannot create like God did but we can take what he created and make a similar creation out of what he's already created an animal doesn't do that the dog still lives the same way you live that bird still builds a nest and a fish has his spawning grounds there's no difference there because why they doesn't don't have a soul but that man is in the image of his creator therefore that when that animal died and the blood was broken the cell was broken the life is in the blood cell and when the blood cell was broken the blood broken up the worshiper had to take the chemistry of the blood and put it up on the door so it could be seen with the little eye because a life that was in the animal could not come back up on the man not having a soul therefore it wouldn't mix with the soul of a man an animal's life won't come back upon the human being now our sacrifice today not only an ordinary human being but it was God himself that was identified and quest you're up on the earth that blood cell was broke not only to the soul the man or a spirit of a man but God himself who was identified in that man returns back upon the believer in the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the token that God requires today they're talking out today that we have to have must be the Holy Spirit that's God's required token we prove it to you by the scriptures without the Holy Spirit you do not display the token that's the token shows that that that you have identified yourself with the sacrifice and God has sent you back the token the show that you've been accepted no that's done no matter how good you are how much you know I'm a college professor good person preacher whatever it might be you are absolutely not recognized until you can show the token Israel and that Exodus is they come out that time they have to have that token to prove that they was identified with their sacrifice if the night God requires the baptism of the Holy Ghost part proof that we've been identified in the resurrection of Jesus Christ there's nothing short of it the Bible teaches it plain and we must believe it it's God's Word God's requiring it we're having an exodus again we all know then Israel is marching to the promised land so love a bride go to her home pretty soon now we find out the block was a token and I it was identified everyone was identified by the blood the Holy Ghost is our token today to identify us by with Jesus Christ in his resurrection the blood being applied by faith the chemistry the blood cannot sprinkle Everhart we know that because it was shed on Calvary it bathed the ground but out when that blood cell was broke it released God through the sanctifying power that the blood had to come back to believers God in the beginning was God the Father who lived above all just like the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness you come down upon the mountain if anybody touches the mountain because he must be killed God's holy and he cannot condone sin in no manner the man that touched that mountain died even a beast EDB thrust through when God came down he was holy and God poncing come down and was made in the form of a man that we could hanley touching the Bible says in that teeny little blood cell many Jews wants to say he was a Jew many of us want to say was that you he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was gone he was a creative being by the hand of Almighty God he created a tabernacle he lived in which we know as a son of God that's right the deity supreme deity of Jesus Christ cause God dwelt in him Peter said the amount of Israel Jesus of Nazareth a man made known by God with signs and wonders you took with wicked hands of crucified he we were witnesses of his resurrection when the Holy Ghost has been poured out upon man now we find out that in this great thing that is God was identifying himself with Israel back there and requiring that identification now we find out you're the Jews could say they might say well now wait just a minute I am I'm a Jew I'm in the Covenant of Abraham I'm circumcised the kulluk head was annulled if the token wasn't displayed think of that I'm talking of a token of this day if that blood wasn't displayed that token I don't care how much you can show you was a Jew how much you said you believe you might been rabbi priest or anything but that token had to be applied no Inns are out yes or no until he saw the blood he would pass over some fellows might say come aside here I can prove I was circumcised at eight days the priest has record of it my name's on the book up there that didn't have one thing to do with it Tolkien was a if the Tolkien was not applied that covenant wasn't all it was an on effect we must remember that what God says he never takes back but he adds to them of old time to her say thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you whosoever looketh up on a woman to lust after her hath committed it off with her already he never takes back he adds to he magnifies that's what he does all these works he continually magnifies them that's where we're walking from one church age from the Lutheran the Weston the Pentecost and on and on as we go as we move on up God continually magnifies the same word just keep it going like that until finally the church will come into the image of Jesus Christ which will be his bride that he will take home thing that we're looking for today sure we realize that the church will go through the tribulation but the bride won't should be taken out from the church just as Israel is taken out of Egypt we find out now that the Holy Spirit was the one now that identifies us with Jesus Christ the Jews might say yes we're coming to Jews but if they did not have the token the Covenant was of no effect same thing now no matter how good we are doe matter you might say mom I did this knob done all these things knob paid by times I belong to the church I do all this God requires the token show that you have been identified for your sacrifice the one that you claim the hand the one that you believe that you had Peter said repeated every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but of the promises of the UWE to your children and to them as far off as even as many as the Lord our God shall call who is that simple man that will change that and say the days of miracles has passed who will do that it said that God's Word was wrong when he said whosoever calls upon them Partha promises into unity or children that it's part off even as many as the Lord our God shall call he'll stack the token upon them this makes the difference between the believer and a non-believer it was all sealed by the kingdom of God in those marked by the mark of the beast and the ones that was marked by the mark of the beast could not take the seal of God the same things coming in today and we sit back before our own eyes no matter how good you are how much you say you're a believer God required the talk and he recorded in Egypt he requires it tonight he requires it tonight still I don't care if here's a Bible student how well you can explain the scriptures Satan can do the same thing but remember that has nothing to do with it God requires one thing that's the token the token shows that you are identified with your sacrifice that you claim that you worship hey that's it von Haase see the blood or the token the blood shall be a token and I see the blood I'll pass over you death was ready to strike Egypt still they desire not to repent and not turn back they didn't want anything like that they didn't believe it they didn't believe the message that was going on God has sent him a message they didn't believe it they still want to go right on the way they're just a perfect type of today they need every spiritual happening and every spiritual sign is a warning from God that something speaks to take place if that sign comes from God if it's man-made there's nothing to it but if it's God sent anyone knows everyone knows that God sends a sign if it's a supernatural sign he sends a message with that side always does he never fails to do that you see things it's not signs of God well then it won't be nothing cause God isn't in it but when God's in it a message is going to follow that in that message must be from the scripture that must be a scriptural message it must come thus saith the Lord ever spiritual happening is a sign from God like the message and the signs of following in this day like it was in the days of other days if we pass you in the Bible time and all other time could this ever be till now no other time can this message ever come forth till now jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man the message could not be - now the world wasn't the condition is until it's in now this is the hour that Jesus could appear at any time the sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy oral that's at that time when the bride went in and the rest of them was left here did you ever think what happened they went right ahead preaching and thinking they were getting soul saved everything and did not know it they do nothing about it the Church of war on thinking souls are being say to everything else and the church is already the bride sealed away don't know it it's early that's exactly what description Noah went to the ark God seal it out truly and the time will come when men and women will cry to God and even think that they've got something when they haven't it's exactly right the Scriptures speak said likewise we must remember that God is long-suffering not willing that any should perish he always sends he signs his wonders and then when he gets ready to do anything he separates the believer from the unbeliever notice and how he provide for his promised land people look what he did for his promised land people there to be sure that they would not be mixed up in some kind of an ism what did he do he sent a prophet to them Moses with a message identify God's Word and to identify Moses he sent a pillar far that hung over a man then to give him the perfect assurance he required a token payment there's a messenger the message and the vindication and the token the perfect assurance that they have nothing to worry about matter of harmony plague strike what everybody else says they are sealed away Israel coming out of Egypt as I said a few minutes ago is a type of the bride coming out of the church when Moses begin his ministry Israel gathered together in one place in Goshen begin to pray because they know that the hour was at hand because they knew something was there the deliverer had already come God was working doing thing he's showing what he was going to do they come from all parts of Egypt just like they will at the day of his coming they'll take people out of the Methodist Baptist Luther all those who are identified in Christ by the token God will take them with him when he comes we read over here in Hebrews at in chapter 26 verse if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a fearful dreadful-looking for the fiery judgment rule and part of the adversary that is if we disbelieve willfully after we have a knowledge of the truth there is no more sacrifice for sin think of it no matter what you're thinking in your heart the token can never be applied if you reject it the last time then it cannot be applied before he that sins are displeased willfully as we see the great in signs and times of coming as we are now with the promise of the word every word that's been promised to us before the end time we're laying right in it now even to the marking of the beast and the denomination's getting together and the papal rain coming in everything just exactly the way it is the world's hanging honor the atomic bombs is in the hangers and God's speaking to his servants into the churches and pulling him out enjoying the silence that he promised he would do just before he's coming we're at the impound the token is required yes sir how we know that those things are true as it was there were only a type of what we were going through now as we see these great science coming at the end time warning us the time is at hand don't sin willfully don't disbelieve will flee if there's something in you say well now I don't see where I need the Holy Ghost I might not need it I believe when I believed I got it Paul said to the people that asked that question he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you had believed the Holy Ghost is a token a man believes God that is true enough but the Holy Ghost is a gift of God it's something different in your faith your faith applies that that's exactly right but the Holy Ghost is the witness we'll see just in a few minutes how it works and what takes place where we can be sure where we know where we're right or not it warns us that the time is at hand we should love one another doing this time the church the believers should be unseparable believers believers should separate themselves from all the things of the world everything is ungodly the believers should separate himself from it notice they were not just to come together to talk about it and say we believe it they were come together to a pot of ugh that comes to oh sure I believe that walk alone they had to come in a pod Kludd that the token might be seen get beneath it that's today we sit here the message preached we read it out of the Bible we say oh yes I believe that that is what God required no matter how much you believe it you've got to have it church wake up America this is your life our judgment lays in the balance under for this nation if God would let this nation get by with what it's done now he'd be obligated to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize for burning them up right we are going to pay for our sins we're doing the same thing they did in Sodom and God has set down message just exactly the way he did inside just exactly sent one to the church out there and a lot group into Sodom and he sent to the elect and so forth and proved it that the churches setting exactly in the condition it was in the days of lot and Jesus said it would be again transits on our hands what are we going to do with it say blood on your hands yes what do you think Oswald thought when he was staying in that room the other day but taking the blood of his you will you be judged anger - I get sons and daughters of God not some old salt grandfather let his kids get by grandchildren get baths anything he's not a grandfather he's a father and sir every child must be born Davi he's a father of Correction we know that this hour sure judgements is at hand what are we going to do with it I'd hate to have his blood upon me there's only one way you could ever get it off idea you can't wash it off Pilate tried that he tried to pass the buck onto somebody else and said send him on over to a seizure or someone else like that and if see what he throws it back ba he'll write back in his lap again right and today we try to say I would have my husband and I would have my wife I would have my church back bars might pack honey again when you say well well I church resist but when Jesus Christ comes down in these meetings and identifies himself in the scripture that he's the same yesterday today forever I don't care what your interpretation is cars out in your laughing it's underneath paying brothers and sisters you can do friends remember the issue of California you're at the end of the west coast road civilizations travel with it all the riffraff is blowin in the next thing you'll go to Israel where the church is take it up take wine only one way you can get the blood of Jesus Christ off your head just put it in your heart only one way it'll never work no other way so when I see the blood when it's applied in the right place they say I believe the blood wanted thrown it out in the backyard was it put it on the chicken house what if it's over on the garage no it has to be pawed at one certain place that was on the little in the heart that's for God Pete what's the black the day and it's all in your hands today if you have it accepting it I got the seal in your heart it's all on your hands is identification of your scripture in this nice day puts it right back on our hands what can we do with this Jesus is called Christ why don't we go to do with it only one thing is display his blood by letting it be on our heart by the Holy Ghost we are responsible any of us that's not beneath that blood God is not responsible for it not even one all the whole family had to come not just one member say well dad's a good man he's a preacher I'll be saved no sir your godly father and mother has nothing to do with you you're an individual I belong to the Holy Church that church that church has nothing to do with you there is no such a thing as a Holy Church there's no such a thing as a holy person there's a Holy Ghost with the people the Holy Ghost in the church no holy mountains no holy places it's the holy God like you being holy me be holy is he there's one that's holy we are responsible to him not to the church we're responsible to God into his word and God is the word the Bible said he was responsible to that that's Jesus Christ notice what he did then we find out to the whole family only was safe when the token was displayed when the token was displayed they were safe look in second chapter Joshua find out here that are believing harlot by the name of Rahab a Gentile harlot over across the river when they come into the Promised Land the spies went or despite all of her family were saved under the token that only remember God's destroying angel honored that token when the church is round the mare fell the city round the king went out the governor the educated the pity women the handsome man they importantly all-sufficient sand everything went down that wasn't under that token hey man so Lydia the coming of the Son of God his destroying angel will destroy everything who hasn't done that Okin how'd the baptism of the holy ghost of a show that you've been identified dyed yourself to your sacrifice and are borned into the Spirit of God and seal there by the Holy Ghost only one God and he's the only one who speaks the right word and this is it no another can take anything for him in notice Jericho had the heard what God was doing Jericho had heard the words remember what the harlots said we have heard how God did great things I fear will you just spare me if I show kindness to ja and that Caleb and Joshua had told him what to do how to apply this scarlet card is stay on it we're not responsible for one person they kind of bring my father in can I bring my mother my brothers my sisters my neighbors they all that you could get under it that was the same today brother it isn't can we bring Methodist can we bring badness can we bring Pentecostals all it's ready to come under God will accept that and that alone will all identify you with him notice yes his great powers and signs that he had done down there if they seen it a note why can't we have women and manded ages as honest as that woman was when we see what God promised to do and see him doing it then next thing come judgment they must believe they were they were they believe they must have believed they were safe in that great wall where were where they were at their great big finally their great big place many people today I say this through rivers and respect many people they say I belong to the biggest Church here is the city my mother belongs to that church is one of the oldest churches that don't have one thing to do with it the the token has got to be a plan they might have thought that big thing they lived in that big system that was go to saving but we find out everything that didn't show that token perished soul it be at the coming of the Son of Man he's done said so there must have been some of them hate boys or somebody slipped into the place down there and played some tapes to him or something you haven't found the predestinated she's coke all over a house and used it for a church and received the messengers then when they got all in the city that would come under and believe the token when she got all of it in there and the destruction come when God's wrath destroyed that big system they had down there the token sign help her house the token sign not nothing else no matter how much societies how many good Red Cross things ahead which is all good how much of this and how many charity organizations everything parish that wasn't under that token now think of it everything perished I don't care how bigger Church the head how bigger denomination they belong to was the king's palace everything perished and so did everything perish in Egypt it wasn't under that token that God doesn't change his ways he's got a token today my brother's sister you better receive it you better have it just remember it's a warning look the same life that the token did in his same thing that the token did in Egypt it spared everything was under everything without it perished Joshua is a type of Jesus which Joshua means Jehovah Savior so does Jesus means your holy Savior Joshua was true to the token sign that his messengers had preached so will Jesus be true to the token sign that his messengers preached when he comes all under it was saved in Egypt all under it was saved and Jericho what about today we find out the lambs blood was a type of Jesus Christ all right Hebrews 13 we find this it is Paul there the everlasting covenant God had a covenant with him but the blood now is an everlasting covenant the blood of Jesus Christ God's blood bound promises makes us free from sin and self makes us free from anything in the world no matter how much we try to fashion it the world it's all dead if we were in God's blood bound promises we see nothing but the blood how could they look out that door without seeing the blood how can you look out at anything without seeing first the blood of Jesus Cruz if you're in Christ you see that to worship a man to show forth his promises in power he promised these things to come his blood bound people are in him sealed in their by the Holy Spirit and are looking only at the blood and the promise they can't look at the world they're dead to the world the world's dead to them and to see Christians a day who can do anything at the rest the world does act like them swear like I'm drink like I'm smoke like them and rude pins of synod dance halls and things i can then still say they are christians you can't do that friend that's the reason people can't believe the power of god they can't believe the science mourners they done died to those things in a resurrected over here in the world but those who are dealt in or are raised in christ and are looking for his promise the new testament means new covenant the blood life the blood life itself is the token the life out of the blood is the token remember in the old testament the actual blood of the Lamb had to be applied here it's the token of the blood it is the life from the blood that's in the person for the token oh my the new token is the new light that comes through Jesus Christ when his blood was shed the sanctified Church and fill it with his presence that he might manifest his word and his promises to the people God in son John times and divers matters Hebrew ones said he spoke to the fathers to the prophets but in this last day through His Son Jesus Christ what is this on the word the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and this is the revelation the completeness of Christ whoever will add one word tutor take one from it the same will be taking this part out of the book of life there is a revelation we only need the token with us to make that word live again that's what he sent the token part he'd give us the statement give us in that statement and we know it's the truth the new token shows Jesus has met every requirement for us and he's here the new token the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we know that Jesus died to free us from all the things of the world and the token that is up honest proves it by vindicating what he said now how can a man clean the whole that token in front of him and deny what this word says it isn't soul it can't be so God can't lie about his own word and because he is sure we have the other right to all that he purchased for us notice what was the token to do to purchase and surprises then pay when you had the token you have a right then to present that token to anything that he purchased for you and one can buy it without it it's only can be purchased by the token remember if you out here at the bus line stay here I'll tell you I got a I got a token it says another bus line that won't work I got a token it says it come from Maine from New Hampshire if won't work in California you've got the head of token of that bus line in order to purchase shows that you have purchased that bear on that bus and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and that is our token that all that we have need of is already purchased I am we are identified with our token the token must be ready well covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise that token is the sign the purchase has been made forests full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the token no other way is there that you can ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word not what somebody's put into it and added to it but what God said about what he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down the altar that don't we walk back and shake hands for the pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means deaf to your first being and life to the second be it means that the blood has been a part and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ and if he be the vine and we'd be the branches of life that's in the branch is in the also from the vine it'll bear the fruit if that first rains come forth that branch out of that vine the rule 2 book of Acts behind it if that branch ever puts forth a vine puts forth another branch they'll write another book the ex behind it cause it's the same like if one of your grape vines I hear brings forth blue grace if it puts forth another branch they're running fourth blue grace I'll tell you today we got so many grafted behinds into it with denominations and crazy things and yet any citrus fruit grafted-in can male live in there fine but it's bearing the wrong proof what we needed a is an earth baptism of the Holy Spirit and have a real power of God that identifies the works of Jesus Christ promised for this thing not so much as that Dave this thing the promise that he made here that commissary pour out his spirit nice promise to get in the last days what do you do strange we can always look back but you never look ahead that's the way with man he's always saying glory find God for what he did do praise him for what he's going to do it and ignoring what he's doing that's always the way of man is still the same thing full obedience to the word brings God that word eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you it's Christ in you now notice when then when we pray if we have the token and when we pray we had the token we our percent are talking with our prayer now if you're sick your sinner if your need when you have the token you have all right if I had the token to a bus line in my head they can't keep me off of that bus they've accepted my money I have the token in this case I could not pay my price you could not pay but he paid it for us and give us a token amen why to divine healing Jesus Christ I have a right to claim ever promise in that book when when you get it when you have the token and can rep present the token with your prayer if you haven't got it the sign of the fallopian severe is paid Paul tells us the blood speaks blood speaks did we say does the blood speak can it speak that token speak yes sir if we look in Genesis 14 the voice of the blood of Abel cried out against Cain we find out in Hebrews 12:22 or that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things the blood speaks how can the chemistry speaks it's a life that's in the blood that does soul that was in cane that cried out before enabled it was the life it was in Christ that cries out there are things than anything it speaks that he speaks Thailand it's the Holy Spirit he speaks plane to tells us that the time is here when we see it where it said it would say it then we said come back and identify what it said it's there's nothing else that but to believe it that's trying to recede it leave herself and apply the token all it sold for the family like they did in Egypt and like they did at Jericho at 1631 we find out Paul told the the Roman to be baptized calling upon the name of the Lord him and his house could be saved by doing the same thing move out some people wants to apply the blood and stay in you will apply the blood and kick all the trash out of the house to have a house clean time you woman's take off them shorts you man throw away them cigarettes you women to get all this old stuff out of the system here that's called the world if you love the world of the things of the world that cause a love of God's not even in you when you're ready Pilate open yeah we get ready part you can't serve God and Mammon at the same time women come along a past across this country I've made remarks about miss Kennedy with her Jessie Bell haircut and all like that your big water heads these women I wonder if Miss Kennedy would have heard the messages I preach team out of there her hair's brought a long time ago but us across this country back and forth showing by the word that it's wrong and a condemnation for women to cut their hair in the Pentecostal women continue go on the same way she might rise into his judgment not knowing but you all better shows up blood hasn't been applied that tokens not there long hairs and an azurite bow it showed that you cut yourself from the world obey the world hey man Sam sir that his hair glock run as right bow now we realize these things of women dressing and acting and doing it man permitting of the doing big bunch of sis's it seems like there's not even made anymore you see men wearing pink shoes and preachers on the Pope it's something like that that's a disgrace I like to see this absolutely man like there's a power that drives them to do it it's a devil in the pressure of this thing right sometime a man with 200 pounds and muscles like as not a handsome man and he looks like some big out here like man be man instead of these ladies when they're tokens applied they turned back to that God made them different than they are different now I must look like women women the most look like man it goes to show this a perversion a dark spirit hangover gross start is over the people it's the hour of the calling out there's a darkness over Egypt before they call you out then them talk of us apply this time for the church to get the token or gross darkness is upon the people gross darkness yes clean out the cupboard clean out this house all we have a good old-fashioned housecleaning let the blood be applied and then the token will come in clean it out sanctified they had a pile of token and prayer with companies when you clean yourself up you've got away from the things of the world you dumped all the ugly but I don't care what the people says if the Word of God says it in promise it I believe it if the word says that that settles it now I don't care what anybody else says see and when you got all that done you've applied the blood and you believe every word then take your token in prayer be fully convinced we read in Ephesians 2nd chapter 12 first about what God said about when we applied this token notice serving the Living God with being works and with living signs with a living token not dead works in Carla not dead wears Hebrews 9:11 14 tells us again the same thing not dead Creed's but a little token they these Creed's deny that there is such a thing as a token they don't even believe there is such a thing as a token the baptism the Holy gold but we who believe the word know better know and it's just living presence for us in this day we separated from dead works and the Holy Ghost comes in to confirm the word and make it so Hebrews 13:8 proves that to us proves that God has raised him up for us according to his promise were thousands of years has passed 2,000 years almost as past but what is it that token still holds that God raised up on the third day if you just got the word that's all you got but when the talking is applied then Christ is reality to you and he does today like he did Dan so it throws it right back and earth up again they can't get around it God promised it and here it is but the tokens not to be applied you take the token event and we accept his sacrifice blood then he gives us life the life of the token and it is a promise seal Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption then being baptized into him first Corinthians 12 we become part of his body and in him is the fullness in him is all the sufficiency that we have need oh he is my pleasure he is my life he's my joy he's my he's for it not I don't have to puff on the cigarette to get some kind of a relief I'll take the lily of the valley easy opium it is the thing that makes me walk in the clouds he is not earth sufficient he's my hopes he's my best he's my God he's my Savior he's not healer he's all because I died whee-ha and him and her baptized at him and in him is all sufficiency this enclosure while I make his closing remarks if Satan tries to hand you some of this stuff like sickness you know what you do just showing the token I have a purchase cut up my healing has been paid for I am a product of God because I have the token of a Holy Ghost you cannot keep me off of this highway you cannot keep me from my health I present the token to show you that my by His stripes I was healed here's the resurrection of Jesus Christ battening out to prove it to you oh there is a real thing there's the token that's reason people don't believe it that's reasons hard for the sin that Tolkien has never been a cloud the Dutchie several days of miracles his pace you're doing that for a blind jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved even people not you'll be damned these signs shall follow them idli how far to all the world that ever creature on name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues take up serpents or great day today's or Haarmann if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover a planet talkin and that clean your ice take it before Satan the bus driver says say airplane man says say you take it on this plane airs of Tolkien Hey you're too ragged you're not your rags you're too poor we don't take little man big man give me the token that settles it I have a right as the rest of them hand I have a right just to see this Paul head saying God purchase my same thing [Applause] [Music] blood the token not the blood chemistry up talkin the Holy Ghost the life out of the blood it comes what is that life just comes and confirms what the token has been purchased by the token confirms what the the blood bought for you the blood purchase your Redemption the token is an evidence of the blood he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity test time our peace upon him with the strife through he'll see all blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows that you've been identified but that's okay keep you from it that's nice having a platform here to face everything there isn't around the world until God's word drama stood only likens the hold that blood has been applied and holding that Holy Spirit here in my heart the devil has not one word to say against yes sir we'll walk for the apostles of trauma yes sir the COS of token paid the way the tokens the evidence that the way has been paid and we've accepted it and to prove it God gave us the token the sign that we was received minister said to me one time said brother BAM abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness that's true said what more can a man do but believe I said that's exactly right then more do you get this Holy Ghost outside of a bleeding I said but he give him the seal of circumcision as a confirmation of his failure hey man and if he's never give you the baptism the Holy Ghost then he hasn't confirms your faith that you say you had but the token is a confirmation I say I got the money I paid it in the office down there but you've got to show the token that's right when I shoulder token I got a right and when I can shoulder token of the Holy Spirit you've got the right to any purchase saying that Jesus Christ by part it's the token watch just a moment as we close hold a token over your unwavering faith in the promise word I believe that Jesus said ask the Father anything in money out of it hold your token over that promise word and walk right to I'm the Lord heals all that is easy he was wounded for our transgressions but his tribe sighs he'll take my token of the Holy Spirit this is me hold it over my prayer and say Lord God you promised it when I see the token I will reward you I promise to do it he can't do nothing else he look right through the blood of his own son there's a token aplanet he has to do it because he promised it he could not go into a house the death angel destroyer and take one out he couldn't do it because there was a blood of the Lamb the requirement of Jehovah and the requirement of in today is the blood of his own son Jesus Christ and a token of the Holy Ghost we haven't got it we might be Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostals whatever we might be we might shop screen we might be also educated that has not one thing to do with it you must present the token then you're subject for the resurrection because of resurrecting powers already in you the token is the resurrection power showing that Jesus raised up from the dead and you're all right is from the dead the dead things of unbelief and have been all made alive in the word of Jesus Christ you believe it and the word lives to you if he abide me in my word in u.s. what you will st. John 14:12 he doesn't believe it in me the works that I do shall do also greater than shall he do because I go to the Father a little while the world sees me more yet you shall see me because I'll be with you even in you how did enough the body is sitting at the right hand of the man but the token that you have received it and he's giving back to you take that token it came anything you wish to I'm policy I've always said on that two classes of people the fundamentals in the Pentecostals the fun of those positionally studies the scriptures and figured out they say we're we're sons of God they believe that yes sir but they don't have any faith with it but the Pentecostals has a lot of faith and they don't know they're sons of God like a man money in a bank can't write a check the other garage check got no money tonight if you could just ever get the thing together two men and women could realize you there's been truly baptized into the Holy Spirit and you have the token in history you have a right to every dipti blessings of God from everything that he promised is yours hold your token over your unwavering faith as you pray and over his word faith in his word God once gave a token to the people and that was a rainbow look II listen close for closing God ever remained true to that token way back in the days of North the destruction of the andalusian world God gave this nation or give the world a rainbow sign for a token and God ever displays is talking as a thousands of years rolled by he never fails because he watches his tokens all these thousands of years these display twos shown us that he never fails to honor the token he never fails to honor he expects us now to display the token over our faith to Satan's group and the unbelievers and cults and so forth they don't believe in that we believing what he is said of his promises and that Jesus Christ has raised up from the dead showing himself alive and that is the badge the token of identification because it's price own five in you identifying the word it doesn't need anything yes that's the token without the token shows that there is paid shows that your subject for the resurrection that God that same power that raised up Jesus from the grave you're holding within yourself as a token the Holy Ghost in you is the token that brings you from the grave because the token is God the Holy Spirit which is eternal life coming from the Greek word Zoe which means God's own life in you that's the only thing that pays the price if that Tolkien isn't there how are you going to raise brother sister tonight with all parents to God into his word and to each other and to the time that we're now living in if you're without the token if you don't have the token some of you might not even believe it but it's shared the token has been here since Christ died why don't you identify yourself and death to your own thinking tonight and let the thoughts that's in him in you that the meditation of my heart be acceptable Dean Oh Lord let thy word eg abide in me and my word and you that is him then asked what you're willing to be given to you don't you believe that that istari heads how many people

thank you this morning today for Lord your service law the token Lord it's the burden that you placed on a pastor's heart for this convention that's about to take place and Lord we under such great expectation for the words of your prophet Lord that you taught us through Scripture that voice of God comes through the prophets and Lord however the random labored for so many years to lay words seeds that somebody would come and a people would come and on the vm messenger would be the final voice that a finally it's so refreshing that in the year 2018 we can hear these words and it's so real to us that the law we have to apply the token and the token makes us act a certain way it makes us behave a certain way it gives us as brother Branham said our right to every redemptive blessing or right to healing a right to victory a writer overcome a right to access the heavenlies and and he brought such a beautiful type of how you would have to normally pay for the token and present the token and the train doesn't want money they want the token but we we didn't even have the money to buy that token yet you share your blood and pay for it for us Lord I'm unworthy us you paid for us undeserving us you paid for a sinful us you pay it for us father and law we just have to have a testimony of accepting believing acting cleaning up and being under expectation for the life of this promise word to be manifested in us father Lord not for our glory but for your glory not for our honor but for your honor father you deserve the praise you deserve the glory you deserve the Thanksgiving father there is there is none like You Lord and father we just have no sir praises today but if I could present a prayer request for everyone here this morning Lord it's for the token to be applied in our lives it's what a token to be applied in our houses the token to be applied in our families father Lord and in this week that's us so week for us we want to be very careful to law take time out to clean up to get ready to make room for the blessing Lord at the sacrifice and the labors Lord we know it will not be in vain but our prayer as you have done before is that you would exceed our our very best expectations you would you would exceed our hopes father and that you would pour out the Holy Ghost Lord upon fathers and mothers and young people and children and those that may be struggling they would be given such a charge that they have never felt before Lord and it will father walk this place like they have never done before we commit Lord the convention into your hands we commit the ministers that would speak into your hands we pray for traveling mercies for those that Lord there are those that are already on their way father may you grant traveling mercies to them and bring them law to our show us safely may all be well in the airports may all be well and the various immigration and checkpoints and customs and the different countries and lomi we have a

weekend in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says a man you may be seated amen are you on the expectation for God to do great things before I give the announcement as the technicians get ready we prepared a short three minute or so video to announce the convention and I know those who may have seen it on YouTube or on social media but we wanted to make sure everybody saw it so brothers if we could just switch over to that before we close out thank you I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt against the Roman dogs of Egypt I will execute judgment I am alone [Music] and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses way and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of Egypt in application identifying this person has been read before there was anything it ever happened by faith they apply the book see before actually was apply the feedly that it was going to happen see before the wrath of God passed away the blood had to be applied first it was too late as the resident fallen see the token that's over you it's God's required the hour the evening time message is to apply little [Music] you didn't cancer something the Bible said there's coming a time when man will rot right in the flesh and the buzzards are the author carcasses before even done cancers are 2 theta lots of coming that horrible thing is forbidden to touch those who had to see the gun that's what we're striving to be positionally kingdom of God horrible plague strike [Applause] Oh suspend up now the street said this is here it's so compact at the end of the 14 days you should get to the congregation together by their hands upon identifying themselves with it and the blood should be but youbut said that the end of the land are provided [Music] you shall be feeling the holy or not and when the blood was shed the taller was sat down with a a mana cost like a Russian fighting man that was a fossil [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] amen amen you appreciate them so I just wanna really salute brother Anthony O'Brien who led the production of that of that video and so we under great expectation and believers are already on their way but the Solomon mechina is already honest we should be here tomorrow Lord willing from Ghana he and his wife and over the next couple these the believers begin to arrive so be under great expectation and there are a few things that need to be done to the end over the next couple days so if you're available to help and support certainly do let the trustees know and in what way you would give support there'll be no service this coming Thursday we like to ask maintenance group three please meet it by the Andy after the service there will also be a choir practice after the service and we'd like to remind you with respect to the lunches we'd like you to pee for the lunches to D and certainly check the menus that are on the notice board and comander great expectation we have three wonderful days in the presence of the Lord there will be three services on Friday the current schedule is 10:00 a.m. Friday morning then 3:00 p.m. is our second service and then we're targeting a 6:00 p.m. start for the third service on Friday and then for the Saturday and Sunday we have two services each day 10 a.m. and which are getting 4 p.m. on Saturday and same 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday evening and if the Lord allows us we will have a prayer line on the Sunday evening service but we looked to the Lord how he will take care of that because we are an expectation one day we wouldn't need to have a prayer line and as the word goes forth sick would be healed by the Branham promises just coming a time when right now he said we lay hands on the sick but at that time we command the Devils to leave and we are in a season where God does stuff unexpectedly they were there any upper room praising thee one expectation they didn't know how exactly didn't know when exactly but in the Bible said all of a sudden they came a sound from heaven and I love that all of a sudden because if you come under expectation and and and and as brother Branham said in the Silver City this has nothing to do with anybody else it's about you as an individual coming on the expectation for the token to be applied on your life and that's my expectation I believe it's your expectation and for those that are traveling from Ghana from Ivory Coast from South Africa from Europe from South America from the u.s. they are coming under expectation is not it's not just for us to come and on a pier it's for us to get something from the Lord for us to be drawn closer to Christ and to have a real experience because friends this will is finished this will is finished there's no more hope there's no out there is no solution there's no government there's no regime there's nothing this world can offer but there's only safety in Christ not in Church in Christ that's where the safety lies and the token that's the identification it's God identifying with you it's easy for us to see we're identified but when God identifies with you that's our expectation so may the Lord richly bless you be and pray this week make the sacrifice make the effort I can guarantee you whatever sacrifice you make for the kingdom of God God will give you returns abundantly more than you could ever expect or ask so may the Lord bless you brother Anthony a man you love him today please go get my hand a praise one more time give me key for that song through the blood as you get ready to leave amen ashes come forward [Music] we just want to act some of the brothers we need some help with some chair adjustments right after service so if some of the brothers could just stay back for some help with the chairs you want to rearrange some of the chairs thank you [Music] Oh away there we [Music] Oh [Music] any to his presence Oh Oh [Music] Oh have we into his world [Music]
