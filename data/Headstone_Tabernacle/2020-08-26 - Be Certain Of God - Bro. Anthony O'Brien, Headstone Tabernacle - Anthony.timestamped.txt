[1:12:24] tree here
[1:12:25] and his friend took a look at the tree
[1:12:27] and he didn't stay long he said
[1:12:28] brother i know exactly what's wrong and
[1:12:30] the brother said well what's wrong
[1:12:32] he said this tree's got too much
[1:12:34] supports it's got too much stuff holding
[1:12:36] it up
[1:12:37] amen probably had it since it was a
[1:12:39] sapling but now that it's growing up
[1:12:41] he said you've got to remove the
[1:12:43] supports he said
[1:12:44] when you remove the supports hallelujah
[1:12:47] then it begins to get strong
[1:12:49] because now you are opening it up you
[1:12:51] are making it vulnerable to the wind
[1:12:54] and to the rain he said this tree has
[1:12:56] never shaken before
[1:12:57] he said you have to shake this tree man
[1:13:00] this tree's got to take some pressure
[1:13:01] man
[1:13:02] this tree's got to take some battle man
[1:13:04] and when that happens
[1:13:06] he said the tree naturally begins to
[1:13:08] grow
[1:13:09] its roots deeper into the ground to
[1:13:12] handle
[1:13:13] the pressure to handle the storm to
[1:13:16] handle the facilities of life
[1:13:18] or the tree knows what to do oh
[1:13:22] he says it's built in but you've got to
[1:13:24] remove the supports
[1:13:25] and i feel tonight oh there may be no
[1:13:28] people in this building here tonight
[1:13:30] maybe god's removed the supports in your
[1:13:33] life
[1:13:33] but he wants to see what you are going
[1:13:36] to do
[1:13:37] with the word of god that you have heard
[1:13:39] all these years
[1:13:40] are you going to apply it are you going
[1:13:42] to stand up on a rock
[1:13:44] oh hallelujah are you gonna fall to the
[1:13:46] ground oh brother

[1:14:26] show who is church member
[1:14:28] and to show who is genuine royal seat of
[1:14:30] abraham
[1:14:31] oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that

[1:16:58] woman out of all the women that was in
[1:17:00] israel
[1:17:00] he chose that woman to entertain his
[1:17:02] prophet he would have never chosen an

[1:17:28] living for the fellow and finding brine
[1:17:30] in the bread
[1:17:31] isn't that right finally finding out
[1:17:33] that the bread has begun to cease
[1:17:34] isn't that right the oil was running dry
[1:17:37] and so forth isn't that right
[1:17:39] it was coming to a place one day when
[1:17:40] she went in to look at her little fellow
[1:17:42] she said she seemed seeing her sleeves
[1:17:44] out torn
[1:17:46] oh she might have looked herself in the
[1:17:47] mirror seeing how she left that table
[1:17:49] with something on there for the baby
[1:17:51] but now her own cheekbones were sticking
[1:17:53] out her little frail looking arms
[1:17:56] she didn't mind it for herself but a
[1:17:58] little boy
[1:18:00] oh she didn't want to see him die
[1:18:03] isn't that right holly musician could
[1:18:05] get ready
[1:18:06] so finally one day she went to the meal
[1:18:08] barrel
[1:18:09] and she said there was just one handful
[1:18:11] of me left
[1:18:13] he said and she went over to the cruise
[1:18:15] to see how much oil and just about a
[1:18:17] good
[1:18:18] tablespoon full that stood between her
[1:18:21] and death oh what a condition

[1:18:27] of the line isn't that right
[1:18:29] down to the end of our own ability
[1:18:32] isn't that right everything run right
[1:18:34] down to her own
[1:18:36] hollow what she could do isn't that
[1:18:38] right hallelujah
