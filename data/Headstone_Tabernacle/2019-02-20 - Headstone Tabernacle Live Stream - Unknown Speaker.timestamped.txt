[28:43] Kings chapter 2 let's read from verse 6
[28:46] talking about Elijah and Elijah here
[28:49] amen and it says and Elijah said unto
[28:53] him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord
[28:56] had sent me to Jordan and he said as the
[29:00] Lord liveth and I soul ever I will not
[29:03] leave thee and they too went on and 50
[29:06] men of the son of the prophets went and
[29:07] stood to view far off and they too stood
[29:10] by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and
[29:13] wrapped it together and smooth the
[29:14] waters they were divided hither and
[29:17] thither
[29:17] so that they too went over on dry ground
[29:20] and it came to pass when they were gone
[29:23] over and Elisha said unto Elisha
[29:25] ask what I shall do for thee before I be
[29:29] taken away from thee and Elijah said I
[29:32] pray thee let a double portion of the
[29:35] Spirit be upon me and he said I was
[29:38] asked a hard thing nevertheless if
[29:40] they'll see me when I am taken from be I
[29:43] shall be so it shall be so unto thee but
[29:46] if not it shall not be soon and it came
[29:49] to pass as they still went on and talked
[29:52] that behold they've appeared a chariot
[29:54] of fire and horses of fire and parted
[29:58] them both asunder and Elijah went up by
[30:02] a whirlwind into heaven mine they were
[30:05] just talking and then something dropped
[30:07] down in their myths and he said and
[30:10] Elijah saw it and he cried my father my
[30:14] father the child of Israel and the
[30:17] horsemen their oven he saw him no more
[30:19] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[30:22] rent them in two pieces
[30:24] he took up also the mantle of Elijah and
[30:27] fell that fell from him and went back
[30:30] and stood by the bank of the Jordan and
[30:32] he took the mantle of Elijah that fell
[30:36] from him and smote the waters and said
[30:38] where is the Lord caught of Elijah and
[30:40] when he had also smitten the waters they
[30:43] parted hither and thither and Elijah
[30:44] went over and verse 50 says and when the
[30:47] son of a prophet of the prophets which
[30:49] were to view at Jericho saw him they
[30:53] said the spirit of Elijah doth rest on
[30:56] Elijah and they came to meet him about
[30:59] themselves to the ground before him
[31:01] Makana blessing to the ring of his word
[31:03] tonight he made me you might be seen a
[31:05] man

[31:26] of Prayer tonight and we want to eman
[31:30] continue in the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[31:32] for a revival that is yet ahead amen
[31:35] but our title where is the Lord God of
[31:37] Elijah amen that's my title to name
[31:41] where is the Lord God of Elijah he men
[31:45] any men it's a question and Elijah is
[31:48] asking here in this scripture we just
[31:51] read Amen praise God amen and he
[31:55] journeyed for a long time with Elijah he
[32:00] saw miracles he saw signs he saw wonders
[32:05] from first kings where we pick up this
[32:07] Elijah character amen and we know the
[32:11] Lord told Elijah to go down on anoint
[32:13] Elisha and Elijah was in his daily
[32:18] routine I suppose he'd get up every
[32:21] morning and plow the capital and and and
[32:24] and keep the land and till the soil and
[32:27] he was just doing his part was just
[32:30] doing what he thought was right
[32:32] keeping that straight line but there was
[32:35] something about Elijah that God loved
[32:37] there was something that he liked about
[32:39] Elijah that Elijah himself did not know
[32:41] Amen hallelujah but he was appointed
[32:44] praise God he had an appointment to meet

[32:56] around him a man caught his life was
[32:59] predestinated and when the time was
[33:02] right when the moment was right Elijah
[33:05] hallelujah was inspired by God or heart
[33:09] to go down and to speak to this young
[33:11] man Oh Holly Holly and dropped a mantle
[33:14] upon him it was no talk it was no

[35:01] that they it lost faith in Christianity
[35:03] and he said oh I soul and he was talking
[35:05] about how that you know they heard that
[35:08] Jesus Christ died on a tree and they got
[35:10] confused because he heard somebody say
[35:12] he got died on a cross so is it a tree
[35:15] or is it a cross and Jesus said and dad
[35:17] said well what are you worried about
[35:19] what you want to be concerned about is
[35:21] the fact that he died he tried to take
[35:23] your place doesn't matter they say it's
[35:25] a cross it's a tree praise God it's the
[35:27] same thing don't worry about it the most
[35:29] important thing you need to know is that
[35:31] Jesus died for your sins because you
[35:34] were supposed to die but he took your
[35:37] place you are supposed to die but the
[35:40] core of love was broken for your sakes
[35:42] his blood poured out so that you could
[35:45] have a chance to be called the sons of
[35:48] God oh that you could shout that you
[35:51] could say man that you could say
[35:53] hallelujah that's the grace of God to us
[35:55] that is the most important thing tonight
[35:58] Oh glory to God the fact that Jesus died
[36:06] for us is what brings us into fellowship
[36:08] and the Prophet said you cannot have
[36:10] fellowship unless you have something
[36:12] common to fellowship about and the most
[36:15] common thing we have tonight is that the
[36:17] blood of Jesus that forgive me can also
[36:21] forgive you and if God forgive me then

[1:00:03] we want to see this God in the church we
[1:00:06] want to see this God move upon our young
[1:00:08] people now that it just come to a
[1:00:10] service but at the power of God will be
[1:00:13] so milky
[1:00:14] it would break their hearts and it would
[1:00:16] scream and come to the altar and demons
[1:00:19] will run out of their heart screaming
[1:00:21] coming to repentance coming to the
[1:00:23] pillar of fire some to the water some to
[1:00:26] the flood all to reply all it all to the
[1:00:29] Holy Ghost baptism that's how you gotta
[1:00:32] come there's only one way to come to it
[1:00:34] jesus said I am the door I am the way I
[1:00:37] am the truth I am the life no man could
[1:00:40] come to the Father unless it come to me
[1:00:43] but he told his disciples tarry in the
[1:00:46] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:00:48] with power from on high
[1:00:49] Mary had to receive it Peter had to
[1:00:52] receive it yeah Peter walked on water
[1:00:55] but he still had to get on his knees and
[1:00:57] you see the same Holy Ghost in his heart
[1:01:00] and in his soul
[1:01:01] hallelujah every one of them do we see
[1:01:07] the same penny did you see the same
[1:01:10] spirit or they were none of his Harley
[1:01:13] but he identified himself
[1:01:14] he made himself known to among them by
[1:01:17] his power and by his glory by the
[1:01:20] vindication of his word for that time a
[1:01:22] man is now right
[1:01:24] a man i'm closing and here it was Elijah
[1:01:27] sin he likes you told him I want to top
[1:01:31] a portion a man all right and he like
[1:01:34] just said you ask a hard thing but
[1:01:35] nevertheless if you see me go you can
[1:01:38] have what you see and so Elijah was now
[1:01:40] on double alert praise God because he
[1:01:43] had to see him go he didn't know when he
[1:01:45] didn't know where he didn't know how he
[1:01:48] just had to keep his eyes on the target
[1:01:50] he just had to keep his eyes on the
[1:01:52] prize he just had to stay very focused
[1:01:54] and that's what we've got to do tonight
[1:01:56] don't look to the left don't look to the
[1:01:59] right keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:02:01] keep your eyes towards Calvary keep your
[1:02:03] head to one heaven I get your pants legs
[1:02:06] maggot at the knees and stay there until
[1:02:08] go to something for us tonight after all
[1:02:17] this coming and going it's got to point
[1:02:20] us to something and we see now a target
[1:02:23] in front of us something we must achieve

[1:02:28] Holy Ghost the restoration of the true
[1:02:30] church hallelujah hallelujah letter
[1:02:36] killeth but his spirit giveth life we've
[1:02:38] had the word for all these years but
[1:02:40] what we need is a spirit to come down
[1:02:42] and anoint it and bring it to life the
[1:02:45] Prophet said the Spirit is the watering
[1:02:47] the Spirit of God is the great watering
[1:02:49] spirit that comes upon the seed and
[1:02:52] brings it to life whatever is laying in
[1:02:54] there has got to come to life when the

[1:03:08] anointing of God to fall upon that seed
[1:03:10] and to make it live and to anoint it and
[1:03:13] to bring it to life to bring the past
[1:03:15] every promise to bring to pass every
[1:03:17] scripture to bring to pass everything
