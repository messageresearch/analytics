be the name of the Lord after shift had snow from Le greetings to all here today today is a special day want to welcome Pastor Nigel alert and his church Miss Tabernacle to be here with us here this morning we consider it a blessing for you all to be here we warmly welcome you all of you for giving us this opportunity to serve I think that from don't have Fellowship don't talk to this one don't talk to that one don't talk to this one to come to this place and that that don't talk and don't Fellowship have nothing to do with the kingdom of God that have to do with mans and man boundaries and man issues and and and so on that have nothing to do with God's kingdom because the Bible said the kingdom is preached and Every Man Press into it so this kingdom is open Hallelujah and men do have a a heav more hell to put somebody in or put somebody out so there are many challenges ahead challenges as individuals as churches as a people we must become stronger in Fai and this FEI is not what we have for the last 50 years sorry to disappoint you is the Fate that works by love come on come on it's not just f but Fe that works by something it's interesting how the book of Jude small book is placed just before the Book of Revelation and in that book of Jude it said and of sum of compassion making a difference between brute beasts and those that are failing In the Flesh and struggling and so on make a difference and of some have compassion there a difference there so Jude the book of Jude is correctly placed in the Bible because it identified this Spirit of forgiveness and brotherly kindness and we know that faith is based upon forgiveness and if people don't cross you or do your wrong or whatever to you there's no opportunity for you to say I forgive you right or please forgive me and I don't believe the Christian walk God would allow you to walk this whole journey without saying I'm sorry without saying forgive me without saying I was wrong got people but Pride will keep you from doing that and you'll go to hell with The Pride not the Purgatory to hell because that is what it happened in heaven Pride overtake the the devil he wasn't the devil yet he was Lucifer a well handsome beautiful Archangel that's right but he got boots and he got kicked out because of that pride and God hates that that thing called Pride he resists the proud always but you always give grace to the humble so once you prepare to humble yourself go God is prepared to bless you and so like that so just before Revelation breaks that Holy Spirit slot there is brotherly kindness has to be displayed I remember long time M was s fighting when you when you meet a brother so his blade you know SW and that that was supposed to be in the message that not the message you know that's foolishness that just foolishness when Christ comes it makes a whole difference we want to see Jesus which one a train that Jesus or the Jesus in the Bible they have a Jes in the Bible that forgive the one of the well that tell that woman who was caught in the act go and sin no more that Jesus who watched a man who a crooked Wicked man said coming home to the house and that man just say I'm going to straight up everything you Jesus didn't tell him go and straight up everything you know he said come to your house tonight and that man just decided to get activated already they said I'm going to fix everything we want that same Jesus that could go to the other side and cast a thousand evils out of a man because that man have about thirst for him we want that Jesus yes we want that same Jesus not a triny Jesus that same Jesus we want in the Bible not the message Jesus no not what they have now the one in the Bible you can read it and see how behave when you're hungry he hold the pocket tight and say you know some people don't ask how you're going because they don't want to get no change they don't want to help you so go God bless you no we we don't want that how you going they don't want to ask you how you're going because you say I'm going Boy Tough Boy Tough they know they to put the hand down they don't want to put their hand down to help so they say God bless you praise praise the Lord hallelujah we want the same Jesus that could feed them with Five Loaves and two fishes we want the same Jesus that had the same compassion the same Mercy the same Grace extend and that's why I'm saying the mercy for you has to be extended to others it can be Mercy for you and judgment to others this one cut off and this one finish and who is shock I just have fun with that you know man saying this one is shock this one is SE like if them in heaven quarters that if them access the counsel of God and God tell them that God ain't talking to them but this one finished finished finished by who who correcting my papers who Cor in your papers God made a way for you God forgive of your past I say forgive your past and bless your future we have challenges ahead and we need to think different because we going be pressed together oh what a time this morning what a liberty and freedom here this morning God bless you Saints praise God is a real blessing having you here

you take me out of the way and speak lip to a to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church say amen I want to read the scripture while you're standing so when we sit we could sit so reading uh Romans 8 God bless you you welcome I will keep my greetings for after this scripture Romans 8 reading from verse 14 for our scripture this morning familiar portion of scripture Romans 8 verse4 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ears ears of God and Joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject of ity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body for we we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man see it why do he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make it intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searched the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he make it intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the house of the Lord this morning are you happy to be in the house of the Lord the psalmist David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and we are so delighted this morning to be here and to be together in fellowship and we know Satan is mad Satan doesn't like this if the devil could keep us separate he has already won the battle but the moment we come together then something begins to move the Bible said if two shall agree touching anything you could have whatever you ask for and one will put a th to flight two will put with 10,000 the flight that's in mathematics you call it a geometric progression if you add three to the equation it's 100,000 you add four to the equation it's a million so with what's happening here this morning all the Devils on this island are already finished because there's more for us than against us and if the true church could ever work together in harmony then the devil has no room so I'm excited this morning cuz I'm identified with Believers of like Precious faith we are not now seeing each other we saw each other a long time ago before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule before there was rent before there was mortgage before there was back pain before there was old age before there was governments and political turmoil we were there before the foundation of the world and we were represented Hallelujah when Lucifer was kicked out we were there we were represented there we were part of the operation that threw the devil out of heaven and created oh come on now and we are here on the earth doing the same thing we did before this is not new to us we just forgot it but the word of God to Elijah the prophet brought back memory to us and broke the spiritual Amnesia so we are walking with faith and confidence and assurance that we are children of the most high and this message is very much alive this message is not washed up this message is not defeated we are only just getting started oh you don't hear me this morning we are just warming up we are just getting started all the years since the prophet left was a warm up was a warm up for you to be here we were not here in the 60s we were not here in the 70s but here we are in 2025 when the lead of hell is uncovered demon powers over the Earth Satan thinks he has the world in a choke hoold but here you are Sons and Daughters of God waiting for the power of God to strike home and the moment the power of God strikes home it's on the inside working on the outside your sickness has to subject itself to the power of God that's in you your old age has to subject itself to the power of God in you your bald head have to subject you don't hear me this morning you may be seated I'm just testing the temperature Hallelujah just making sure because the Bible said he rather you hot or you're cold but if you lukew he spew you out of his mouth I'm looking for a people who knows that he's unveiled I'm looking for people who are radical in their belief that this gospel is just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost I'm radical about the sovereignty of God to bring people together from this place from that place and call them from prostitution from drinking from porn from pornography from fornication from the Baptist Church from the Methodist Church from The Message Church it didn't matter where you come from but we are caught up in the realm of God because there's one Lord One Faith one baptism one hope of our calling one destination one enemy and you know what we already have the victory we already have the victory we are just showing the devil that we have the victory we are walking in our Authority walking in our position I don't know how long this service is going to be but I know by the time this service is over sickness has got to go depression has got to go being defeated has got to go can the church say Amen you may be seated I'm trying to get to the greetings you have to forgive me but we need people who are reckless in faith that's the prophet I didn't say that take don't have a problem with me the pro the BR said we need a reckless Faith he said Faith got here on its chest Hallelujah we have become too comfortable in the message we got to go take the war to the enemy we got to take back from the enemy what the enemy stole from us if you lost your joy take it back you lost your Victory take it back you lost your worship take it back you lost your shout take it back you lost the dance in your step take it back maybe you didn't dance for a long time take it back maybe you didn't lift your hand for a long time take it back brother brandham said when you lift your hands you defy the law of gravity you saw that you are creature from but the N Gil we're about 60% testing the temperature we what we got to get up we got to get to 100% when we get to 100% then then then then we can start to preach Hallelujah the devil try to tell you belong to him and your mistake is going to keep you back and you fell here and you did this I don't care about it that's a sea of forgetfulness when God look through the blood he doesn't see your mistakes because the blood is speaking for you you have a lawyer this morning and your lawyer is also your judge your judge is also your doctor your doctor is also your Redeemer your redeemer is also to your savior your savior is also your king your king is oh you don't hear me this morning let the redeem say so can the church say [Applause] Amen you may be seated my wife told me not to say it but I'm not going going to be too long with you my gift is not the gift that goes too long I believe in the prophet talk but a short quick message shake the whole nation you got to see yourself in the word somewhere there are different measures different gifts different callings you know but we all have a part of the body we all have a role to play we all have a part to play and when every brother finds his place then the enemy can't move Hallelujah can the church say Amen so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ to the Saints the Beloved purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ to my friend my fellow Minister Pastor Nigel alert God bless you your precious wife family missp Tabernacle the officers of the church the soldiers who stand identified with him contending for the faith that was delivered to the Saints restored by Malachi k for who see the land ahead and know there's more land to be taken but that's how we feel there remain it much more land to be taken and as our sister said little by little we take our portion we are making progress this morning little by little every service we getting closer and as we near The Headstone brother the bandam said we become a super church as we near The Headstone so this week we are more of a super Church than last [Music] week because as we near The Headstone we become a super Church don't tell me for tomorrow because by tomorrow I'm more of a super Church oh come on now somebody help me so time is running out on the enemy time is running out on your sickness time is running out on the devil this morning you may be seated really want to appreciate all the worship who singing how many appreciate our song leader this [Applause] morning talk about changing hats but that's how God had it this morning so we appreciate that and all the specials thank you so much for all the specials amen and my friend brother Michael who's singing that song and that song for the last few days has been my song I want to go where you want me to go Lord I don't want to go where I want to go but I want to go where you want me to go because wherever God wants me to go I'm better there than anywhere else if all of hell is there but that's where God wants me then all of hell has to be subject to my feet because I'm the safest wherever God wants me to go I don't care what the enemy looks like I don't care what the situation looks like I don't care what's happening in your job in your marriage in your home in your finances if God wants you there then he's there with you the psalmist David said if I make my bed in hell he is there with me he understood the relationship he had with God can the Church Say Amen [Applause] so I have a little title this morning by the grace of God and we are just looking to Fellowship around the word of God nothing that will be said is outside of the message of the hour I have no new revelation I'm not a prophet I'm just a brother with a revelation who's been through some stuff and I could testify it's the grace of God for me and if it's a grace of God for me and I know it for myself I could say it's a Grace of God for you and we are all here trophies of the grace of God there's nothing we have ever done could ever do that could warrant or qualify us for what God has called us for but the Bible said who he forew he called past tense who he called he justified past tense who he justified he has already glorified so in God's mind you already have the Holy Ghost you already adopted he's seeing a finished work you are walking through the process of it but in God's economy he knows the devil is already defeated you are on top of your home you in the right position Oh Come come on now amen so for a title this morning the restoration of divine order Divine position and divine power for a little thought this morning the restoration of divine order Divine position and divine power God is a god of order but the random taught us that where the ROM he says there's nothing halfhazard with God God wake up and decide to do something this morning no he's a God who plans he's a God who anticipates he's a God who puts things in place and but the mam said setting in order for the coming of the Lord so you are not here by chance there's no chance with God this service we having today God already saw this thousands and thousands and thousands and before eternity all of that this already happened in God's plan for his purpose we may not seen all of it only when you look back you can see what on ve but God is a god of order and when God in Genesis and brother brandom taught us there are two books that the devil hates Genesis and Revelation because Genesis speaks of the beginning and Revelation speaks of his ending and we know that God is a god of order so in the Gen Book of Genesis he on the first day second day Third Day fourth day God is putting things in place everything is in order everything is in its position everything is there by the power of God can the Church Say Amen the picture at that time is a picture of divine order Divine position and divine power because God spoke it and it came to be he put the sun where he wanted it he put the moons where he wanted it he put the Earth exactly in place he put the stars in its place he put the animals in their order everything in place and then he put man there a spirit man and the church say amen and then he took a flesh man and put that Spirit man inside the flesh man we know this can the church say amen and man was in position he was in order he had power because he was in his position that's that's good your power is tied to your position your Authority is tied to your position oh you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah brother the brandom said perfect faith is based on your position it's a difference if you are in your home on your property and you're in somebody else's home what you allow to do or can do is different but when you are in your house you are in your position you have certain rights because it's your your rights are limited when you are in somebody else's house you see what's happening in the world America revoking visas doing this they're basically saying this jurisdiction has certain things happening here and because it's their jurisdiction they have the right to accept they have the right to reject they have the right to Grant visas they have the right to shut down visas immediately because it's their jurisdiction but if you are born there they can't throw you out all the countries trying to go to America need permission to go there because it's not theirs they come from somewhere else that's right everybody with me this morning but when you were on your land nobody could throw you out of Trinidad nobody could throw you out of Trinidad because you're born here you grow up here your pitch you you build s Castle you do this is yours the president of the United States cannot chew you out of Trinidad because this is yours and when you are son of God [Music] no devil can come and throw you off of the oh you [Applause] don't and when you are in the jurisdiction that belongs to you there's an authority that comes with that jurisdiction you may be seated and and just to understand the context because we're talking about divine order there's a order there's a way that God operates and when we order in that way when we operate in that way something happens there are positions that you're supposed to be in you can't be where you want to go your blessing when you go to a bar you really not in your position remember brother Bron give the illustration of the young lady who went into the bar and thing and and she was living at some when she went she she was off of her ground but when you on your ground that's why the Bible say don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together because when they come together in a kind of atmosphere like this it reminds you that you're a creature of heavenly places you don't hear me this morning this is a reminder that we were doing the same thing before the foundation of the world listen on the others oh come on now it's only worshiping Glory blessing honor might power Dominion holy holy that's the envirment to [Applause] [Music] know you may be seated but when you on your jurisdiction and even and and just to understand the power of jurisdiction and the power of position if you if if if an American is in a foreign country and they're under pressure of brother punch they could be anywhere in the world but they want to know where the US Embassy is because if it could just make it to the US Embassy because the ground that the US Embassy covers belongs to the United States they will defend that they will send planes for that they will send soldiers for that because that little piece of ground is their it could be a small spot but the moment you cross the line into that area you know you're safe you could watch the people who chasing you and look at them and smile because you know you cross this one line oh you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah So Young Brother young sister if you've been living in the world I want to invite you to cross the line this morning and come back on your territory because when you're in your territory the Holy Ghost is there blessings is there healing is there the Deliverance of your family that's why they had to leave Egypt and get to the promised land because the blessing was not in EG Egypt the blessing was in the promised land huah and since the prophet left we have been living by the evidence of the new land so we know it's a good land we know it's flowing with milk and honey but I don't I don't want to keep looking at the land I have permission I have access because only Sons as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God not everybody could walk into that land but you me us we have permission because we are Of The Bloodline come on now somebody help me this morning they can't reject me my passport says Promised Land my Visa says Promised Land the Philistine know I'm from the promised land can the Church Say [Applause] Amen hallu [Applause] so when man fell brother Powell he fell out of order out of now it changes the reason why you can see the prophet could preach conduct order and Doctrine because conduct is about Behavior order is about God's order and Doctrine is the foundation of our faith because when man fell we fell out of order the trees knew it the animals knew it that's why I read this scripture the whole of creation groaning since the fall of Adam because they knew the son fell out of order you know when you are in order and when you're not in order you know when your life is in order and when your life is not in order you know when your prayer life is in order and when your prayer life is out of order you know when your marriage is in order and when your marriage is out of order you know when your worship is in order and your worship is out order you know as a priest in your home when you could bring spiritual sacrifices that God would accept because it's in order and you know when you're not in order anybody with [Music] [Applause] me I'm just encouraging you this morning of what you already know so man fell out of order and he also fell out of position because God had to come and say now Adam Adam where are you where adou this is God we talking about the omniscient omnipresent omnipotent God asking Adam where are you he's not asking for a GPS location he's not saying send me a WhatsApp location of where you at send me a location pin that wasn't the question he say Adam you're out of order Adam you're out of position father you're supposed to be priest of your home where are you God knew where he was geographically he's walking in the garden but he knows this man is broken sister broken because you're not in order not in the position God left him in order God left him in position God left him in power and when he came back around he said Adam you're not where I left you when I spoke to you yesterday there was a sincerity in your soul there was a fervent desire to please God there was something about your walk and your talk that can identify looking that you are looking for you and I'm not seeing that anymore where are you and from that time has been a journey for a restoration of divine order Divine position to release the divine power because God is not going to release power unless you're in your position God not releasing power with you halfway in the world one foot in the world you're dressing like in the message but one foot in the world you're singing songs like in messy but one foot in the world there has to be the right order and the right position so it's not good enough to just be in church you could be in position in church but your life out of order you don't hear me this morning divine order Divine position to release divine power it's not good enough to believe the message that devil believes and trembles some of us don't even trembling God wants us in divine order in our divine position and position is multi-purpose you're supposed to be at your post of Duty but you have a position in your home husbands have a position wives have a position deacons have a position they have a position on your job everything there's a right position are you in your position because if you ask God for power he can only pour out power if you're in your position and if in your right order when you're out of your position it hinders the flow of the blessing of God can the church say Amen position is important you can do what you want and Trinidad is unique you know Trinidad is special having traveled to different countries Trinidad is really unique this small little island we very own way very independent I say if they could sign up for the Oscars and for the Grammys and think we win all the awards because we could act we could we could do things a way Trinidad is special we blessed that's wonderful but there God has his way you can't serve God the way you want to serve him you have to serve God the way he wants to be served he said present your bodies a Living Sacrifice that is your reasonable service it has to be acceptable to God not acceptable to the church many of us live and we pleasing one another and looking all right but is does God accept because the acceptance is in God my concern is not if you please with the message today I have just one concern if the Lord please because if the Lord accept it that's all I have to do as a husband as a father as a minister as a deacon whatever you are there God accepting it can the Church Say Amen so there's a blessing in your position Jesus Will him T in Jerusalem until he be endured for power from high well I feeling to go Galilee I feel in led to go to Galilee yes because I had an experience in Galilee would say t in Jerusalem I going on to Bethlehem because the last time the Lord spoke to me was in Bethlehem T in Jerusalem I hear a voice last night and just whisper Bethlehem T in Jerusalem the blessing was in a position until you receive power if everybody had their own interpretation of that and went way they want the scripture wouldn't read the way it does but you had to be in the right thing at the right place at the right time because God had a vision of what he wanted to be able to achieve and God has a provided place and that place not a physical location that place is in Christ Hallelujah no church could claim to have it and any church that say this is it something wrong I want to tell you this is not it here het Tabernacle is not a mispa tabernacle there's no physical Tabernacle are you in Christ because that's God provided place can the Church Say Amen God honors his word god honors his order God honors his position can the church say amen and even faith faith has a position because Bram teaches about mental faith and Faith so Faith could be in your mind that's the position of Faith but when Faith moves from here to hear is a different so when that man came to he prayed for blind man and then he came back to get prayed for again he said you I already prayed for you're healed just say by Stripes I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed because his fate was here but he keep saying extra extra Read All About It by Stripes I'm heal extra extra read until one day the Fate changed position and it was no longer a mental faith it became a faith in his soul and all of a sudden he his eyes popped open can the church say Amen Oh Glory so Adam went from strength and power order into defeat and his position changed what he had enjoyed before unbroken Fellowship eternal life and Authority was now gone his position was protected under God's word and from his position flowed the power to rule the power of dominion tied to his position if you put someone on a certain seat no matter if you like them or not if they in the position the position comes with certain things so if you become the Prime Minister the Prime Minister has certain Authority whether you like him or not like her or not it doesn't matter the position comes with power the position comes with authority can the church say Amen Adam in his position was an amateur God Adam in his position could name Adam in his position had Dominion can the church say amen and if we are out of opposition now and we see what we're able to do imagine when you get into your opposition because when you get into your opposition it comes with authority it comes authority over your home authority over your life authority over your family can the church say Amen authority over your sickness and when that time come but the BAM said you w't even lay hands on the sick you will command the Devils to leave because you're in your position and I believe the bride is going to get into her position can the church say amen glory there's something about the position you remember the story of Aaron's rod aon's rod was dead for years but overnight in the right position in the presence of God it brought forth buds it Blossom and it brought forth fruit because it was in the right place friends you got to be in the right place you got to be in the right position you got to be in word and spirit together you got to be in the right atmosphere because the word seed is in you and you got to water that seed can the church say Amen bring that seed into the right environment what did Brother brandom say they take a chicken egg and put it under a dog once the environment is there the chicken would hatch didn't he teach us that because it's in the right position take any Son of God and put him through a test he can stand the test because he's a Son of God can the church say Amen you know sometimes you may be seated we talking about position tied to power but you know sometime position is also tied to trials God could send you into a position to test you you might say but if you only know the test I go through right now that the right position because out of that trial out of that test going to come forth something wonderful can the church say Amen but in your position you stand in your position having done all to stand stand can the church say Amen Give the Lord a shout of Praise oh what are you saying preacher God doesn't want to replace you God is not in the replacement business God is in the restoration business you are predestinated for this thing you are going to overcome you are going to make the Rapture you are going to make the breading supper you are going to make it Hallelujah because you are not even the believer the word seed in you that's a Believer [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah glory glory in position in Christ brother B said God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one of he could walk through like this so God is actually waiting for the bride to get into position and the whole Devil's job is to keep you out of your position if he can keep you a church member he good but when you get into bride position then the devil is finished if your position could be one of staying in arts and grudges the devil is good but if your position is brotherly kindness if your position is forgiveness if your position is Unity if your position is love then the devil is finished can the church say Amen brother Bram said get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption placing man festing take him out there and put a ceremony on him Hallelujah so God is looking to place Sons and Daughters into position because in your position comes your Authority can the church say Amen So Adam fell from his position as a son to a fallen state but God promised to restore and he gave the promise that the seed of the woman would come to crush the head of that serpent can the church say amen and Jesus as a second Adam came to win back everything that that first Adam lost where the first Adam failed to hold his position Jesus held his position of obedience unto death to the cross and through Christ our position before God is now restored can the church say Amen what the first Adam lost the second Adam restored on the cross Jesus regained the title de to the earth and the church amen hallelujah he endured it he fought for the position Hallelujah can the church say amen and in the resurrection he demonstrated absolute Dominion he said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it back up again he knew who he was death couldn't even hold him and death will not be able to hold you you will look death in the face just like Paul now as many as receive him let them give you power we are raised back to our position never before this time was the position as accessible as it is now because brother brandham showed that Sons can get back into position let there be a squirrel sun in position sun come out and shine sun in position little fish here give you back your life Son of God in position sister hatti right to give you your two boys Son of God in position as a wave sheath to us that restored sunship is now against accessible to the wave sheath can the church say amen and brother Brandon was just a first example in our day to show that more sons are coming and I believe this morning I'm looking at some Sons I'm looking at some daughters they are about to get into their position and the moment you step into your position Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you may be seated there's an inauguration ceremony when the president gets into office there's a ceremony and when they go to the ceremony all the powers of the office are pass to him am can the church say Amen it doesn't matter if he feeling sick it doesn't matter if he didn't sleep last night the moment the words are said and the power is passed over he has immediate Authority in the US he's commander and chief of the army yesterday he's president-elect but today he's president can the church say Amen yesterday you struggling but today there's a transfer of power a transfer of authority because you get into position and one of these days you're going to walk straight into your position can the church say amen hallelujah but the brand said Jesus knew his position Jesus knew his authority he didn't have to pull out a card and explain I am Jesus the moment he step on the ground Legion knew who he was can the church say he didn't need no introduction he didn't need no announcement yeah he yeah he no the moment he dropped there The Authority was all over him the light was flowing from him right now there's a the light flowing from you the devil already sees it and that's without the authority coming fully yet but one of these days The Authority is going to come upon you and you will speak because the bride will have the spoken word the bride will have power over herself she'll have power over her mouth she'll have power to pray power to forgive power to worship power oh come on now but said when the Holy Ghost came and give them power to pray power to live a holy life power to forgive power to overcome power to walk over the enemy power to overcome lust fornication smoking adultery gossip backbiting power all the things you struggle with the Holy Ghost gives you power can the church say [Applause] Amen Hall through Christ we have a way back to Eden Adam couldn't get sick because in his position you can't get sick Adam did know heartache because if you're in a position you can't know heartache the reason you're going through struggle because you're out of position and the whole of creation grown in looking for somebody you could imagine when brother the BAM say sun come out and Shine for this the sun say wait a minute wait a minute this songing like peace be still it sound like another son in position Hallelujah power over the elements they say there's a son on the earth can the church say Amen that was the first time since the Lord Jesus Christ walked that there was a sun showing this kind of power Hallelujah Satan taught when Jesus died I was it to know if Satan knew what would have happened when Jesus died he would have tried to keep him long long long and keep him there but when Jesus died it allowed the power to be multiplied and Peter cusb Peter fisherman Peter Peter who had his ups and down with a Brute Force fate Peter could now walk by the gate called beautiful because he was in the upper room he was in the right place and Peter had an experience with God and when he had that experience with God Peter didn't even really understand how much power was coming with the position Hallelujah and when he stood there he say silver and gold I don't have I don't have links I don't have cash I don't have nothing but such as I have I have something I give it to you can the church say Amen Peter was walking in his position he was living in order can the church say amen and that's coming to you there's going to be people walk Trinidad and Tobago Walk San Fernando walk shonas walk Porter Spain Deo Martin too I don't care where it are but there's going to be a power in you power to speak you're going to walk in the hospital rooms and people are just going to get healed CL the church say Amen because they were healed and Peter Shadow Peter didn't even have to pray they were healing in Shadow can the church say amenallah hallah God longing for someone to come into position huj the power of position Church don't stay home the Bible say forsake not the assembling of yourselves together there's no way you can take that out the Bible as the manner of some that the manner of some but the Bible say forsake not the assembling because when they assemble there's something that happens like The Upper Room wasn't one over there one over there no they were in one place on one Accord one mind because for this power to come you have to demonstrate forgiveness you may be SE it a little bit can I talk to you a little bit anybody sleeping show raise up it's two public holidays but over I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm fine I'm good but Nigel I'm fine you see if over Nigel say we fine we fine but we have two public holay so we going down here for our age Bradly kindness is the virtue of the age so you have to demonstrate forgiveness for the power to be unlocked for our day you can't demonstrate forgiveness if you locked in your room all day watching a stream CU you have nobody to forgive because for you to forgive you have to have some rub shoulder somebody the wrong way and say well I'm sorry brother please forgive me so God want issues he say you turn the church against you he can't turn the church against you if you have no church oh God help me this morning he said I could TR in a better sickness I could turn your wife against you turn your husband against you because he want to take you to the grinder because the power that's coming has never been here in this way before can the Church Say Amen [Applause] nobody but a George wants to volunteer you may be see that but the B say missing limbs will be restored anybody want to volunteer to lose a limb so we could have the raw material to bring this court to life because if we are no Miss limbs brother we car anybody any volunteers Church missing limbs to be restored yes we need a volunteer because this talk to your pastor nobody chooses their trial because if we could choose we choose the best looking trial Lord I want this one give me this particular trial don't touch my finances Lord whatever trial it give me just don't touch the finance you know the finance stuff these is but God don't give us the Authority or the access to choose our child but we read the Bible all things work together for good to them that love God to them who had he called according to his purpose some through the water some through the flood some through great child but all through the your trial is designed you may be seated you see when UPS come with something to sign your trial come with your name your picture your email address your phone number your ID card it looking for you your trial is not for everybody else or for anybody else and God promis to never give you more than you could bear it's designed for your shoulders it designed for your feet it or common us somebody help me this morning the Bible said think it not strange this is things we know you know when some fiery trial come some of us will be if you only know happened to I get 82 flat tire think it not strange hallelujah what the tire people name mileage Mark have a soon they see me they know the problem Hallelujah think it not straight that is really this renewed by the transformation of your mind is a process you know because things happen to us to throw us off and many of us have been in the message too long to be acting as if these trials are strange we let easy things throw us off little thing happen here and oh God pray for when David comforted himself in the Lord saying don't reach out for prayer and don't call somebody for prayer line and support this kind of thing you know but there has to be a point where you reach a level of maturity that you realize that this test is designed to make you a better son a better daughter because your adoption is based on you passing the test of the tutor watching your response to the issues of life that God and his wisdom sent your away somebody preach back to me this [Applause] [Music] morning though he slay me yet I trust him oh Hallelujah somebody preach back to me this morning he'll turn your wife against you God help us I see Brothers have a hand up I not I'm not driving on there going to hit the rivers God knows what trial to send because the tutor the Holy Ghost but I'm taught this you noce it in the message is watching your behavior you know so in the midst of a child he hurt me and she said this God not testing them he testing you and he want to see if you could live in divine order if you could stay in Divine position so you could demonstrate and display divine power somebody give the Lord a shout of praise [Music] so I know it's a mixed audience and my mixed audience because we know in every church have three kind of Believers have some message just sing there only one type of believer I know but Niger it on the same page with this because Prophet taught us and Believers in every church cuz even Jesus had a devil and Jesus never deacons St him out Judas was there down to the end you know brother George whole time in church he a missed a service yet Judas was given power you know he was there for all these services so it's important that you are in your position when a father is in his position the home is different when fathers are priests in their home the home is different When the Children See their father operate as priests in their home the world speaks of the absence of men and being male is not being a man but we are not dealing on that level we are Beyond male and Men We dealing with priesthood because we are priests and Kings when the man in his home is king of his home not with the authority of I am the boss and bring my food and because a king don't have to say I'm the boss I preach about it many time that African slave in America when they try to find out that he slaves the the the the buyers looking and say I want that one say not for sale the way he carried himself you go anywhere in the world you know who bosses are you you know a boss I travel a lot and in the airport you see people move a certain way and you can know that man is a boss and he had no ears he don't even have to be dressed fancy and it's just the way he walk there's an authority with it there's a presence with it you know he's a man under Authority when a father is king of his home Tre of his home the home is different when a husband loves his wife because that's God's order in position there's a power in the home there's a different love in the home when wives reverence their husbands all of that is part of order all of that is part of the right position in the message we have been guilty of deep service boy deep mystery deep message deep mystery deep message deep service and no love home I will hit the reverse say I come for that kind of service this morning just just Lift Us Up Lift us up when the wife reverence the husband husband love the wife as Christ loved the church not as your father love your mother not as the movie say am well I see a movie and the husband they love the wife and this this and the wife did thing thing and thing is see Hollywood say shoot DTV we have no license for gun and here like that you have to get permission but because if your playbook if the way you want to run your home is based on your co-workers and the old people this why just say the tradition of the elders alone is that itself is problem much bless with this generation of internet and WhatsApp and oh go see this is that Bible order is that what he Prophet taught us I don't care how nice the what I don't how nice the music is behind the words they saying is that the word hallelujah divine order Divine position has divine power Divine love divine Authority can the church say Amen the absence of Kings and Priests have forced mothers in homes to step into positions that they're not supposed to be in I don't know how I saying this but there's a order there's a position so when the brother not doing what he's supposed to do the wife by her love triy to step up but he could step up and end up out of position I want you catch that but Theon preach doing God our service without it being his will so the mother trying to do her best for the home but she actually end up out of position because the father not in position let me pull the car back out of there and get back onto I don't know who this is for but this is the word it is important that you are in in your position because your inspiration your anointing your strength in your life you will struggle when you're out of position you could never be blessed in the world I said to the young people you are Eagle you're an eagle but but I'm told you're not a chicken you trying to go to fetal work fet party whatever it call and you a big old Eagle you trying to chip with them in your office there and your whole Wing knocking on thing all over the place you're Eagle you're not a chicken Hallelujah the moment you walk in you look like you don't belong there you know the size of a eagle c chicken you trying to go to a party I trying to try out the world you big like four chicken Hallelujah because you build different and you know too much you've been in too much [Music] Services you know what real worship is even when in a back sitting condition you know that's not your [Applause] position and as much as you try to fit in you will never fit in you try to put in the mini skirt you imagine how you looking hallu you are Eagle you try to dress like you're not cut out for thatall I hope this helping somebody Hallelujah because I don't want to take it for granted that because people looking good on Sunday that on a Monday they behav good on a Tuesday they behav good I preach a message some years ago called between Sundays because God are really marking the papers on the service here now you know but you see tomorrow Tuesday Christmas time parang time Carnival time see the song just coming to I hear it's so much time it stick Maxi every day get earplugs figure it out figure it out guard your heart because out of your heart are all the issues of life you acting like you don't have something to protect your soul is worth a thousand words we have something to protect we have something to defend there's an order God will bless you when you are in [Applause] order so I can't understand how people could think and they say well lord well I holding on and I holding on and you you don't want to sit under a pastor God have an order there's a fightful Ministry there's a way he say everybody should have a home church but I have no home Church you is your own home Church but you're waiting on you Lord but BR say at least take half a loaf now take something now because plenty of those people who so after what they back know but say if you don't testify and evangelize you will find yourself back one day you know because testifying puts something that reminds you of the grace of God to your life do you know the Lord do you know that there's hope do you know there's a Rapture do you know this world is finished and there's a way of Escape do you know you can live above what you're living right now do you know that God is Jehovah Gyra and all the things they asking the bank to do for you he could provide do you know what the take might the doctor for he's still Jehovah Rafa and he can still heal you know how much testimonies we have about healing maybe you don't know about the healing can the church say Amen we ought to if you are persuaded of this thing have you told your family about it have you told your neighbors about it have you told your co-workers about it because you are here because somebody told you who is carrying on the Bon of this gospel until Jesus comes the Zeal and the enthusiasm listen the world know people Brave I identify as this I identify as this I look say what you want about President Trump when he come in over he say I recognize only male and female he let he chips fall where Liv how how we could say that how we say he say if you're applying for a Visa put your birth gender deal with the consequence can a lawyer and why the lawyer deal he make a next edict he make a next thing he they can't even keep up with it and you there timid timid well my skirt how how high is high how is the knee when I say cover KN is it is it this is covered or is it this is how high is is he low is it because if you already believe that this is the C are taking you to Glory then you want to be all in can the church say Amen let's go we talking about being in right position Joseph we know about Joseph a type of Christ hated Without a Cause Joseph when he was dying he said listen Brothers whatever you do don't leave my bones here because I want my bones to be in the right position even though it they looking like nothing much I want my bones to be in the place where the resurrection comeing and you know you never think about it there when they made it into the promised land of the judge is really three things made it across you know we talk about Caleb and Joshua because all them who leave Egypt die in the wilderness but Caleb and Joshua and Joseph's bones all ever think about it Caleb and Joshua somebody had to protect Joseph bones with them 40 years he will his man dying and say whatever you do boy i d in here because unbelief but what Joseph bones because we made a promise that we are leaving Joseph won here can the church say amen amen and you might have come to church this morning as bones it's important that he in the right position because once in the promised land them BS can come back to life somebody say Amen can the church say Amen Joseph had faith that if he was in the right place even in death just put me in the right place even in death and Bones could come to life can the church say amen glory you know it Moses would have come I think about 200 years or so isra years after Joseph died was he Exodus or no and somehow he impressed him mean enough to say don't leave my bones here there's a place that the resurrection is going to be and it's not here make sure that I'm the place where the resurrection is and friends this message is the place where the resurrection is this message of the yah is the place where the life is there's nothing else outside of this that will take take it to the Rapture but the brand I'm Tau us Rapture in faith is laying in the message and that's why can say If I Die Tomorrow leave my bones in this message Hallelujah I keeping this because this is real can the church say Amen Joseph bones with them was a reminder of a resur Resurrection coming know when you look at it say why we have that Daddy because Joseph tell us don't leave my bones here I want to go in the place where the resurrection is going to be the church say amen glory hallelujah it's important that we in the right position the right order Samson had a vow Nazarite vow once he didn't cut his hair he was in order his position was to serve God's people Samson find finding the sisters in church here nice I no sisters in church talking about that the message preaching for itself there and Samson went out of order went out of position and had to deal with the consequences of it the problem with many of us we don't understand that God is a judge and even though God has Mercy it's really a judgment seat with blood on it that makes it a mercy seat actions have consequences people want to play with the world and then come to church and then this is a serious thing it's not as if Samson didn't know Samson knew his parents spoke to him he understood exactly what it was but it was in his heart he was anointed but there was something in his he was called but there was something in his what's in your heart he was gifted but there was an issue in his heart many of us gifts callings anointed but there are heart issues that if we don't address it it will destroy us and if you are left vulnerable you'll end up out of position out of order and with judgment so close upon us we come into a time like the Bible says in the Book of Revelation he who is filthy be filthy still holy holy still where a snapshot or a picture is taken of your life at that point in time and no more change is possible I'm challenging the church don't play games don't take it for granted this is not just another service but it's a warning and an encouragement to us to ensure that our lives are in order and our heart is right with God and we are in position Samson life he lost his power his strength because he was out of order and out of position blind and humiliated a man who once had Philistines running found himself grinding at the middle while his hair grew back the only way that he could work his way back was true repentance and while there when nobody was watching he starts to pray remember me I pray the end strengthen me only this once avenge me of my two eyes we we understand this what I want to draw attention to is the Bible said in this is judges like 16 19 and 20 Samson didn't he wish not that the Lord was departed from him in other words Samson didn't even realize when God left him you know what it is to be living under a covenant and anointing and you don't even realize when God are talking to you anymore you even realized the anointing you thought you had you don't have anymore Samson didn't even realize it was gone but the BAM said every muscle he ever had was still his body but the blessings had left him because he was out of order and he was out of position it's a warning to us it don't matter the church the size whatever going on people have mus framework systems all this going on but if there's no power there power to live a holy life there's something wrong can the church say Amen what we are looking for is a restoration of you coming back into order coming back into position brother Bram said there's a new generation coming on now Samson hair growed out that's this generation here God will restore the consecration of his people when Samson prayed and positioned himself right he said lead me to the pillars he wanted to be in position he had repented he made things right he said lead me to the place he say I'm willing to die let me die with the Philistines I don't care what I have to give up once I'm in order and I'm in position so if I have to die let me die with them but I want to be in order and I want to be in position I don't care what I have to give up once I'm in order once I'm in position if I Lo friends I'm willing to lose friends once I'm in order once I'm in position whether I maintain my family let me maintain Christ that's what the prophet said friend or no friend can the church say Amen God's order we talked a little bit about when fathers could you take some more when fathers are not in position the mothers have to step up and throws the whole home out of balance out of the goodness of her heart she does it but she also ends up out of order because the father is supposed to be doing things a certain way and we see that in the Old Testament as we know the ark represented God's presence and His glory among the people and we see that David had a desire to bring the ark to Jerusalem but the method he approached with was out of order and it resulted in a tragedy and only when he fixed the order and position of it did God even bless it they set the Ark of God upon a new cart we know that right and they brought it out to the house of abinadab and there's a wonderful brother named brother usza and when they came to Nation stresing floor you could read it the ark looked like was going to tip and the brother did what anybody might do he put his hand to stabilize it and the anger of God the Bible said was kindled against us and God killed him there David was had broken because he was the one who in instructed this to play out that way usza didn't volunteer and say let we do with this we no David was the one who set it up so this was a lesson to David about order and position they were enus the motive David had was right you know let us take the ark back to Jerusalem it wasn't a bad motive but it just underscores that you can't worship God serve God do this message in your way there's a way that God has prescribed for it to be done and as enthusiastic and as excited as David and Israel were who death shook David David would later confess to the priest if he had done it the right way for the Lord Our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order that's the words used because the ark had rings and a stage for a reason set out there for the leis in the book of Exodus after Us's dead they put the ark down into the home of Obed Edom for three months the Bible says and that house was blessed blessing after blessing after blessing because the ark was in the house and it made me think what kind of house was that house that they could leave the Ark of the Covenant into somebody's house could the Ark of the Covenant be brought into your home what kind of brother was this that God would have been pleased with the black man to say leave the Ark in this home for three months is your home conducive to the Ark of the Covenant being left in your home you know what you're watching on the TV you know the books but ROM say show me the books show me how your Bible written up show me who comes to your house and I know who you are so it made me think as we talk about order and position for three months the ark stayed in this brother's home blessing after blessing and I asked myself could the ark live in my home am I talking to my wife the right way am I living the right way that God will be pleased to leave the Ark in my home this is the ark that was in the holies of holies what kind of home should we have what does being in order look like what does being in position look like that God could be pleased he just killed a man for touching it and the man who touch it was trying to save it from falling and he killed him because that man was not supposed to touch it but here's another another brother whose home has to be in order for God to be able to leave the Ark of the Covenant not death for a day not just for a Sunday not just for a week but for three months how do you live in a home with the Ark of the Covenant inside of your house because the priest had to prepare himself a certain way to enter the holies of holies he had to be in order he had to wash a certain way he had to not have done certain things he had to dress a certain way he had to have been Sanctified they even approach the holies of holies or there was death he would tie they would tie a rope around him and they didn't hear the bells ringing they knew he was dead and they would pull him out but here's a brother that for three months the Ark of the Covenant is in his home how would you talk to your wife if the Ark of the Covenant is in your home who would you bring into your house if the Ark of the Covenant is in your home what movies would you watch if the Ark of the Covenant is in the middle of your home what books would you read if the Ark of the Covenant is in the middle of your home home what would you watch on your phone if the Ark of the Covenant is in the middle of your home would you pray before you go to bed if the Ark of the Covenant is in the middle of your home would you just get up in the morning and go to work if the Ark of the Covenant was sitting in the middle of your home would you say what you want in your own home if the Ark of the Covenant was sitting in the middle of your home huj it wasn't one day it wasn't two days it wasn't one week it wasn't two weeks but for three months the Ark of the Covenant was in this man's house God had made very clear instructions of how the temple must be and how the Tabernacle must be and the order it had to be to protect the Ark of the Covenant but yet God could find a brother whose house was in order that amidst the mistake that David made he could say put it in that brother's house put it in that house over there is there a house that we could find today in Trinidad that God could drop the Ark of the Covenant [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah can we find our home in order is there any home in order is there any house in order is anybody's life in order that we could bring the Ark of the Covenant and we can knock on your door and say we need a place to rest the AR of the Covenant is this house is this house in order is this house in order we are dealing with the grief of losing brother usza we messed up we didn't handle it right but we need to rest the ark here until we put things in place and this brother could say please it's okay bring it in my home I don't know how long you need to stay but as long as you need to stay Lord you could say as long as you need to stay we welcome your presence in my home I want your presence in my home I want you to be in my home I want to hallelu hallelujah thank you this is the same Ark of the Covenant when the Philistines took it they put it in a room and God knocked down their God the same Ark of the Covenant that went before them when they went into war this is the same Ark of the Covenant where the glory the kind of Glory was upon the Ark of the Covenant [Applause] God is looking for a home a temple a body can he drop the ark into your socket of your heart is there space in there that could fit the ark of the covenant could the holy God step into your 16 element know ye not that he are the temples of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah [Music] this is the story friends that led to David dancing before the ark Hallelujah because when brother usza died they found a home that was worthy to keep the ark Hallelujah for 3 months some of us can't go a day without misbehaving some of us can't go a half day without getting out of character because we have not yet been converted Lord I want to be converted Lord I want to be changed Lord I want to be transformed I don't want it to be a show I don't want it to be words only because he let her kill it but the spirit gives life I want experience so that the Ark of the Covenant I could be near it it could be near me and I'll be found worthy and after three months the Bible said David UNC came again but this time it was in order this time it wasn't Brothers this time it was the Levites this time they had the staves this time because they had a c the first time but this time it was on the shoulders of God anointed men it was in the shoulders of Levites who were of the right tribe they were of the right lineage they were Of The Bloodline they were of the ironic priesthood they had been anointed and prepared for such a time as this and here they are walking with the ark and God is pleased God is pleased and David feeling this he start to dance he start to dance as they coming into Jerusalem he tance he sat T because the ark was coming up the road can the church say amen he couldn't contain himself he couldn't contain himself because he knew that God was pleased because everything was in order God give us a church in order give us a home in order give us lives that are in order for the coming of the Lord hallelujah you can't put the Ark on a cat you can't carry this word the way you want to you can't treat it any way you want to some people can't find their Bible I preach about this when I talk about the war of altars and Priests technology has changed I have no problem with you use your phone to search a scripture and now we have the table app and these things but this is a corrupt device this cannot be your only means of seeing the wordl can I preach because you can't be a priest and your whole Ministry on a phone amelu that brings a level of casualness to this thing amen I have no problem you search things on your phone and your iPad and your tablet I'm using a tablet to preach from there's no problem with using technology but as a priest because you are Kings and Priests as a priest you must have your altar as a priest you must have your your moment when you spend time with God you must have your sacrifice you must approaching a certain way there must be something about you that's not like everybody else there must be a secret closet that you go into where it's you and God alone because you are preparing for the God himself to sit on the throne of your your heart bring back the sacredness bring back the Purity bring back Holiness God hasn't I am the Lord and I change not God is not changing because the world is changing he said I am God and I Chang not he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still holy he still hates sin and as much as the world wants us to tolerate it there's still a holiness you come to the house of God with reverence you appro you approach to prayer with reverence you come to the altar the Bible say if you come to the altar to bring an offering and there's an ought against somebody go deal with that art first before you come up here to pray bring back the old fashion gospel bring back the oldfashioned way bring back the sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost kind of church because God is looking for a church that sin cannot stay in the church because the church is in so as anointed as David was the first time he couldn't just move the ark the way he wanted to even though his motive was right I want to serve God I want to sing a song I want to do this make sure it's in order that's why brother brandham says conduct order Doctrine there's a way to do things could you take some more Hallelujah there's a law of position yes brother po that that hit home three months Boy could the ark live in your home for three months think about that all week what do we have to do in our home some people when a guest come in they do what kind of thing to prepare for the guest if somebody say but Michael we want to bring the Ark of the Covenant into your home what type of preparation brother George we want to bring the Ark of the Covenant into your home but Anne we want to bring the Ark of the Covenant into your home what type of preparation should we be doing the ark want to come there this evening Lord help us like woman who lost the coin you had a sweep rast the Neighbors in the dust flying because the Lord could drop in anytime we want to be ready I don't know how much warning but the terance they gave that brother with the ark that they coming in because these brothers were operating in a crisis a officer just died trying to do what you thought was right we need to find a place now Lord help us right order right position right power the Prophet Elijah sat to get ready to land when he confronted Israel's backslidden condition on Mount Caramel the nation was out of position the nation was out of order they worshiping Bal all the prophets all them all kind of foolishness well the first thing that Elijah did we know it he repaired the altar he put it back in order the altar was broken down lord all of us have a responsibility to repair broken altars it's one thing for your altar to be broken it's another thing if you don't fix it make this may this be your burden in this service and from this day on to fix the broken altar fixing the altar will lead to a repair of your marriage fixing the altar will change the situation in your job fixing the altar will change the situation with your family your financial breakthrough is tied to fixing the altar because as a priest the altar is the mechanism by which you could even offer anything to God he repaired the altar he put 12 Stones representing the 12 tribes in unity you he about the Nigel said it's a Unity there has to be a Unity of the spirit before the unity of the faith is one Lord One Faith one baptism different gifts different administration of the gifts different parts of the body God is blessing all over the world no one has a monopoly on this thing but there has to be a point because we are one body so Elijah stood there 12 tribes bring the stones together symbolically setting things back in divine order and only after the altar was put back in place could the fire of God fall and this shows that when we restore the broken altars in our lives only then could true worship be offered unto God can the church say Amen Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah blessed in the right position blessed in the right order every believer has a position in the body of Christ that's right so we're moving now Beyond upper room and physical position and order to you having your place in the body there are many quotes on it there are many messages in it position in Christ and all these cours adoption placing being positionally placed we know the message but you have to find your place in the body God sets his commanding officers his Generals in place pastors Prophet teachers evangelists for the perfecting of the Saints but every believer has a place he talks about the adopted wife housewife the farmer it doesn't matter what your station is in life you are placed into the body having gone through your place of trying and testing and God can give you stamp of approval to say there is my spirit flowing freely not there is the message in knowledge and you know the quotes flowing freely but there's my spirit flowing freely and the spirit flowing freely is one that could forgive and love and and and demonstrate the attributes of God because you realize that this is not our home we are creatures of Eternity in time can the church say Amen the adoption or placing of a son to place us into the position giving you the authority to use the father's name can the church say Amen bringing us to maturity into opposition to exercise Authority Hallelujah adoption position he placing this is my son in whom I'm well pleased that is going to repeat again here on this island I can't speak for any other country because God put this Earth here this is my home this is my country but I have to believe that on this island God will find sons and daughters that he could place into position and give them power and in that experience they will have what it takes to go to the Rapture to be changed because the Raptor is on the Inside Out Hallelujah these 16 elements going to have a body change can the church say Amen the adoption or placing cannot happen if you are out of order if you are out of position it's a Divine Law the right position will attract the promised power the musician will get ready Hallelujah and that's why I asked for that song I want to go where you want me to because I want to be in the [Music] place because that's the only blessing the blessing is in the place it C be in my place if the Lord say Isaac stop preaching tomorrow I'm happy with that because if that is where God want me that's where I to go but if he say go and preach and tell the world that God is real then I have to do it whether I feel like it but an has a great responsibility but over that all the ministers all those who are called to serve in this time some do it and you're feeling good but you have to do it because you want to go where he wants you to knowing that the blessing is in doing what God wants you to do whether your family support whether your boss support whe it doesn't matter because you want to be in divine order you want to be in a Divine position for divine power can the church say Amen so the whole world the creation is groaning for the sons of God to come into manifestation Hallelujah the manifestation of the sons of God and that's what this whole message is about to turn the hearts of the children who are out of position back to the faith of the fathers because the fathers were brought into position at that early church because that's what Jesus did it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles that church was in order Paul was the gold standard that Alpha church was a template that was set in order and this end time Prophet had a mission a Ministry and God doesn't take a man home unless his job is done so he did the work he was supposed to do to point us back to that Al church so we could know exactly what it should look like and he could say the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on that day no for us it's the fullness because everything has been restored there's no mystery that is yet to be unveiled because he revealed every mystery every mystery was revealed in that Elijah can the church say Amen so we are not guessing this morning we know we have the word we know the promises that have been preached now it's time for us to get into our position because our blessing is in our position can the church say amen and amen can we give the Lord a shout of Praise when the bride is fully restored into her position only then could she be ready for the climax of power which will bring on the resurrection and the rapture can the church say Amen coming into the statue of a perfect man the fullness of Christ the church ultimate position as the bride United with the bridegroom Hallelujah can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a shout of Praise I'm finished God is a god of restoration he is restoring today he's restoring you into your position to take us straight back to Eden Hallelujah let's all stand and give God a hand of Praise I'm finished you love the Lord then let the redeemed say so hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Glory you can play something Softly the prodigal son he was fine at home it would seem he was in order it would seem he was in his position until one day he say father give me everything that's mine we don't know what his motive was what his objective was but he got what was his and he left to go to a far country and he found himself out of order out of position a Jew eating pig [Music] food I don't know how long it took him to realize that this is not right because the Bible says he came to his senses which meant for a while he was out of his senses maybe he thought he could handle it maybe he felt ashamed he say n [Music] boy I make my bed I want to lie in it until one day he said you know what I'm not even worthy to be called a son and many of us we go through experiences and we start to Discount ourselves at what he did he say I'm not worthy to be called a son and in his mind he classified himself as a servant he say even the servants get better treatment than this I will arise and I will go back home in his mind in his heart he was willing to accept servant level treatment because he felt he had forfeited the right to be a son he did not come to the Revelation yet once a son always a son so in his broken condition he starts to make his way home with each step he took home he was coming closer to be back in order and closer to be back into position little did he know that his father was there looking out for him the father made it his business he said this boy one day is going to going to find his way home it wasn't a lookout s son it wasn't a watch s son it was the father because the father knew that this boy had a place had a family had a home had people who cared for him people who loved him and one day something would happen to bring him back home I don't know who this is for I'm not trying to force anything but there are many broken people who have been through a lot and I want to say to you I don't want you to Discount who you are because of the mistakes that you made because that's what the prodical son did he was coming home to accept less than he was and when the father saw him he didn't say the servant is home he said my long lost son his home he said go kill the fatted calf go get the music ready get the robe get the ring get the celebration going because my son is coming home my son is coming back in order my son is coming back into position there's safety in his home there's safety in his home he don't have any money but he's still safe here he is welcome home and I want to encourage you Church you are welcome to make things right with God maybe in your seat maybe where you at maybe you're on the internet right now now if you have been living outside of the covering of God come back home don't live outside of the family of God come back home may the Lord Rich you
