power of the word of God granted father in Jesus name we ask it God bless you and thank you praise God for coming out this morning and we want to go straight into the scriptures we have 2 Peter 3 1-4 Malachi 3 Verse 6 and Hebrews 6 vers 10 to8 three portion of scripture 2 Peter 3 want to read from verse 1-4 14 Malachi 3:6 and Hebrews 6 10-18 so we go to 2 Peter this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy Prophets of The Commandments of us and of our Apostles of our Lord Jesus Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scuffers walking after their own lust saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as the were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflow with water perished but that the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and parition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the Lord is a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack considering his Pro promise of some men con cons slackness but his longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night in which a Heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that out there in shall be burnt up here we go seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought he to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we look we according to his promise look for a new Heaven A New Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing ye look for such things be diligent that you may found of him in peace without spot and blameless Malachi 3 1 verse verse 6 and it reads for I am God I Chang not I'll stop right there and we go to uh Hebrews chapter 6 reading from verse 10 for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed towards his name in that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that you be not full but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could not swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee multiplying I will multiply thee so after he had here we go patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the ears of Promise the immutability of his confirm it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that's before us let's bow our heads one more time father we thank you for your word bless it and interpret it our hearts in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you may be seated praise the Lord Brother R God bless you thank you for that message last Sunday appreciate the message message what shall we say to these things if God before us hallelujah who can be against us let us go on to Perfection amen so we thank God for that and the inspiration a brought last service and was a real blessing to us and to the church so are you ready this morning for the word hallelujah ready for God to speak to your heart I am still waiting on him oh Hallelujah one day we're going to get to that spot to say you know what I'm waiting on hallelujah praise God but this morning I have something upon my heart I have a title and that title was taken from the scriptures in Malachi 3:6 the title is I am God and I change not this is not toov saying I am God now want to make sure that very very clear this is the scriptures amen I am God and I change not and the inspiration the coming of judgment uh that's the inspiration the coming of judgment when we use the term the coming of the Lord and Jesus coming again he's not coming to hail out the world he's not coming to smile with mankind he's coming in judgment amen that's what the coming of the Lord is don't forget that now he's not coming to bring Apples and gpes is coming in judgment amen hallelujah I'll read and this is from the unchangeable word of God but brand I'm giving a story here testimony a young lady out in Oregon was trying to discuss with me one time she belonged to a church where that Mary was O the boss over and she was talking about I hate she said you mean to tell me in heaven these bunch of idiots like was K on in the last night when you were preaching will be the people that ruled in heaven I said that's what the Bible says she said I said your Blessed Virgin Mary had to go up to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost and act like them people did last night or she would have never went to heaven she said that's not so I said let me show you right here in Acts two whether it was so or not Mary got so drunk she staggered like she was drunk in the spirit acted like a drunk person under the Pentecost and if God wouldn't let Mary go home to Heaven anything less than how in the world are you going to make it without that you see let you belong to any church you want to you'll have to have the same experience the same exactly she said well I wouldn't want to be there I said I don't think you have to worry very much about that I don't think you have very much to worry about that I said now go on and write up a real dirty article of it in the paper and I will tell you this thus sayith the Lord you mark my words down between this and 2 months from now you'll be dying on the side of the road in an accident and you will remember the words I told you let's continue she never wrote nothing she played a wise trick there I seen her dying no no this this is important this is very important I seen her dying laying in a car accident and God was giv her a chance then but she is smart enough not to write nothing there wasn't nothing in the paper they just let it go that was a smart idea she only save her own life by it God is still God do you understand what happened there the prophet saw a vision of her dying in an accident and that Vision was dependent upon the action she would take if she wrote that evil article she was going to be judged she was smart she Sav like by not writing article it pays to do the right thing and say the right thing it pays to have respect because God is still God I may die in the morning but he's still God you may get a raise a pay but he is still God you could do whatever you want to do but he is still God you could say you're free to do this and you're free to do that but you are not free from the consequences of what you have [Applause] done hallelujah it does not free of choice of consequences because nature have laws and if you break those laws you pay the penalty of those laws you say I free I plant my garden with corn and I plant corn I'm not cleaning no grass I ain't cleaning no weeds well you will see some tie up corn and you'll get no corn and you waste the time planting because the Lost day had to get them weeds away from them corn isn't that right and that's because God is God he deserves respect and we have got to respect him and give fear to him and that brings respects and that's why the Bible is talk about here is the beginning of wisdom to fear God and keep his Commandments the beginning of wisdom isn't that right and God has demanded watch and he we have got to respect him and give fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants and God demands respect for his servants servants how we know they're his servants because he vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and make them Servants of God and proves their servants and by making his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God and when you respect when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we are respecting God so you can't claim to respect God and disrespect your brother or your sister you give respects because you have it you have to have it to give it and that's something that we fought for and we continue to fight for because there's the coming of judgment amen hallelujah and the tongue is an unruly member and something have to come to tame that tongue you have to press your way to say the right thing that's what sister hatti rright did she said the right thing she said that's nothing but the truth brother brandham and that throw him in a different Gay Al together that's what Martha Mary said the W thing even now Lord and that show Jesus into another Channel all together that he could says Where have you laid him praise God I am the resurrection and the life because a sister said the wrong thing praise God she going say Jesus you want some more coffee and biscuit is a wake going on here we have some special covering or something for you no she went in a different gear Lord if you had been here my brother had not died she was in a gear to ask for more Oh Glory to God she wasn't in a gear to stick in her Circ an and to remain in the condition around her she wanted to say there's something that could have changed what was around her sometime your words change break in some Dimension that change the whole thing for your life oh give the Lord some Praises this [Applause] morning my Hallelujah Jesus praying one time preaching one time and a soldier come up to him Soldier watching him for a while observing him when he recognized what going on he caught it he had a sick man home and he came up to Jesus he asked permission he said Master respects you say you know who I am forget it master I have a servant sick and I see you a man under Authority I see you say the one go and he go just speak the word don't even come under my house and my servant shall be healed this wasn't a Jew this was a gentile this was a soldier this was one of Rome's men that understood the principle to have authority you can't do your own thing you got to be under Authority oh give the Lord shout in the house we don't want nobody in the church doing their own thing running your own show you have to be authorized you have to be under Authority then you have to back up from everything behind you and Jesus said go thy way thy servant is healed then he said I've never seen Faith like this in Israel that man just took the word and run with it we want you to take the don't feel anything just take it and run with it I am healed by his stripes God going to deliver my family God going to deliver my husband God going to deliver my wife God going to deliver my children and God will deliver me oh hallelujah hallelujah you a't come here to watch and come here to touch you are come here to watch you come here to cause something to happen you you come here to create an atmosphere you come just to hear you come to participate you come to recognize what God is saying what God is doing you got to got involve inside of [Music] it you are a part of the Shaker or part of the shaking but there's a shaking coming oh Hallelujah because Jesus is coming let's continue I was standing right there in the corner preaching some years ago as a boy preacher boy preacher and there was a woman come she was a Catholic by faith husband was a Catholic she was a pretty woman nice looking 20 years old 22 I knew her as a girl in the city she came by stood here she said I wouldn't let my pet cow have the religion that William brandham got how old 22 young sister the next day before I could get to her my Lord she was dying in the hospital wow and I don't know yet what killed her she was dying on Hospital her husband come to get me he was a Catholic he come he said come quickly see I pray for my wife she's been calling for you all evening she's dying well I said I will go I got in the car and left the meeting and started to the hospital and I run up the steps I met the nurse and she said she's already dead Jesus he said come say a prayer for her now anyhow I said she is dead he said say a prayer anyhow I said it won't do them no good now but but come and look at her I went down she had that reddish black I believe they call it Auburn here very pretty woman few freckles across her face great big brown eyes that woman the nurse said Billy she died in such Agony until she screamed out your name as loud as she could and said tell him to forgive me till the freckles stood out of her face like watts and those big eyes had set way out of her eyelids half close over of course you know what happened when a person died they both kidney and Bubbles move she was steaming all over and died in such Agony not because she dis disrespected me but she disrespected the gospel that I was preaching and God was working with signs and wonders and what that what Jesus said I could say you could talk against this now but the hour going to come when God going to send his holy spirit one word against it will not be forgiven in this world or the world to come just one word against it that's the gospel Hallelujah that's the word and that's how much we just have to respect oh Hallelujah do you believe that sometime in new Alban I was standing talking to a sinner leading them to Christ a big old ru-h handed man in a garage a man was a friend of mine his son-in-law run the garage next door I was standing preaching a a dinner hour eating a sandwich talking to him about God and through the daytime I find somewhere I could go or through the daytime I'd find somewhere where I could go at dinner and time and try to win a soul to Christ wow that was his dinner Hobby you don't eat by yourself you go and eat and get to win somebody he said Mr Bram he said I was just a boy preaching myself he said Mr Brandon my mother had that kind of religion that heartfelt religion and tears was running down his cheeks I said how long she'd been gone years she always prayed for me I said that God had heard her prayers is trying to answer them right now for her and this man walked in there and say hello he was drunk he said hey Billy listen anytime you want to come come over to my garage you come but don't bring that old holy roler religion of yours over here I turned and looked at him I said anywhere Christ is not welcome I'll not be so he turned around and said oh get next to yourself boy and I just heard in my heart a voice say you would reap what you s it'll be better for you that a millstone was hang at your neck and drawn in the depths of the sea and his own son-in-law that very same afternoon run him over with a two ton chovet truck loaded down and mash him down in the ground you have got to respect God God demands respect he demands it am how I can give my testimony for hour after hour I've seen in my lifetime I've seen other countries other parts of the Nations so forth the things are taken place but to Omit that just so you get the idea of what I'm trying to say to you you must respect it I've seen young people set in the meetings and Snicker and laugh in the meeting and less than 24 hours be crushed into the streets this is young people you know am that's why Ezekiel 9 the Bible said slay utterly young old male female little children but come not anyone near with that Mark that has nothing to do with which church you go to that has nothing to do which denomination you belong to that has to do with the pillar fire and good because God had promised in the last days Baptist and Methodist and Je winess and bamit and message people God didn't promise that God promised sons and daughters that going to come into a manifested position in the last days that's is what God promised Hallelujah there's only one Church Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church there was only one church and you are baptized into that church you can't join it you got to be bor in it that birth changes your heart that birth changes your desires that birth changes your motives of your objectives and your [Applause] ambition that change give you one wife not a wife and nice girlfriends outside that don't give you that one wife give you one husband not husband and special men outside of your close close friends not that come on now because to come to Christ you have to come to the Waters of Separation something that separates you I know you are marked you are separated unto [Music] [Applause] God but the gospel that's preached now anything goes because you don't want to offend the people you don't want to show them where the exit is on you don't want to do that you don't want to throw off this one and throw off this one so to walk soft like Exel listen God don't run a democracy God around the people voting and everybody vote for this and God don't democracy he said I am God and I change [Applause] [Music] not his word comes from Heaven his word comes from on high he is no respector of persons Bishops pastors priests he has no respect he respected old word when he spoke it he swore by it there is to immutability Oh Glory to God he spoke it and he swear by [Applause] it there is none greater than him tonight there is none greater than this God he's a awesome God He Is [Applause] God hallelujah [Music] [Applause] may be seated but you know what happened men making their own Gods the gods of their imagination they gods of their own mind they have Idols they don't have the real God they have message God they have their own interpretation [Music] God I tell somebody God come no photo shoot God come to say send a light by a man and take a picture like a rainbow hair like a cloud here like a light here that means what God didn't changed for Joshua God had changed for Moses God had changed for Noah they were sons of God God for none of them am when Zachariah Elizabeth when God come to announce the man have a son and what not he doubted God shut his mouth you will talk when you see the baby if I tell you you going to have a child you have a child don't even don't even question it if I tell you going to be filled you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost if I tell you going to be healed you going to be healed because I am God and I change not [Applause] listen you may be seated if everybody in America repent America will still be judged because America already rejected God the judgment is already sealed God can change [Music] it I've seen young people sit in a meeting in one year when I was placed the next maybe within 6 months go back to that same place and practically everyone was gone stricken somewhere with disease and things you have to respect it I remember sitting young girl one night Tennessee I was going out the door preaching on a big Baptist Church I felt led that night to call her to come up to Christ she laughed in my face when I when I called her to come to crry she happened to be one of the Deacon's daughters so that Deon that Deon daughter I don't care if it's Pastor daughter Pastor son Pastor mother Pastor father Pastor brother Pastor sister elder daughter Elder son I don't care what position that has nothing to do with what God have said God is no respect our persons on that's why no higher me and bigger you we all have different positions and roles and posts to fulfill I'm called to do this if I do this I'm in God's plan and program for my life to be you call to sit there and hear the word and do something about it for your own life [Applause] if you don't personally apply what you're hearing to your own spirit and life you just like a Catholic B get two our and Mary and go with that the priest say that the postp authorize all them priest to forgive abortions and because his mouth say so he feel so he really think he's God and he's God to them but this one we say here 36 he said I am God H not that kind of not that kind of human thing they set him up as God that man down in pop but he in the Bible there the one who say I am God and I change not he just prove himself he just vindicate himself he not afraid to show himself that's why Elijah said let the god that answer by fire let that God be good give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house and this message world is about to get a serious challenge after all these churches for 50 plus years when the god of Elijah begin to step forward to identify his men and the it God called man not man called man but God called man not man appointed man but Pillar of Fire anointed appointed elected predestinated when God begin to anoint those men what a rocking is going to be because the people are trained to listen to The Scribe and the Pharisees but Jesus came from the volume of the book not from the Pharisees not from the Sadducees not from the Ministers of Association he came from the volume of the book and he was Messiah and we declare Messiah is on the earth [Applause] now that's Messiah anointed word anointed word word coming to anoint my God and you have something inside of you devil can't take it out God put it inside of you your father couldn't put it out your mother couldn't put it out the divorced parents couldn't adultery fornication lying this that that nothing couldn't stop what God put inside of your system had to come out somehow had to unfold [Applause] somehow if God was dealing with you at the human level as you sin that that's it that's it but his blood already paid for it paid for it paid paid all day all day Satan so idle you need accusing any b day and night go and find some work to do but don't you accusing accusing accusing this last day he don't believe he come to Perfection he don't believe he come to you don't believe that but God in a prophet and when the prophet finish he just walk out he said I believe the bride is called I believe she is sealed into the kingdom they just waiting for Dynamics to the mechanics that Prophet saw us that Prophet saw you anointed that Prophet saw us in the spirit you may be seated do you know what a vision is you may be seated Vision like a dream in real time you live in time you live in a book like a novel you have past present future you could go to the mystery who do who kill who teeth and what not and you can spin the fith forward and see the answers but you out of the book if you find the front too fast you go to the back if you want if your heart to beaten too fast you wonder what happen you can skip the whole show and go to the end you'll miss the joy of all all them pages and whatnot but you sure know the end because too much for you so you go straight to the end well God could do that with your life he know the end from the beginning so as far as concern is all way you're going through that drama forget it let me go to the end I see you delivered I see you healed I see you adopted I see you free I I I hear you worshiping King lamb I hear you join the Heavenly chorus I hear you join the for Beast just join the 24 Elders oh yeah yeah yeah yeah join the Angels thousands 10 thousands saying blessing and honor my power Dominion [Applause] Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and when John got a forast and John saw the things are sweeping like that he said we shall rain on the [Applause] [Music] earth oh give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah let's continue this Deacon daughter she laughed in my face she happened to come one Deacon daughter standing at the door that night she waited for me to come out she waited a chick with Attitude h yes she said I want you to know something right now don't you never embarrass me like that again I said God was calling you she said nonsense I'm young and I have plenty time for that she said my Daddy has got enough religion for all of us at home I said not enough for you sister everybody has to have their own religion she said if I want anybody to talk to me about that I'll get somebody that have some sense not somebody like you I said go say what you wish it don't bother me but someday you regret it not long after that passed through the same city she was down the street with her underskirts hanging down slopping with a cigarette in her hand offered me a drink of whiskey and here's a testimony she said you remember the night you called me she said she said that was the truth the spirit of God was testifying to me that night trying to get me to come and since that time I could see my mother's Soul fry in hell like a pancake and laugh at it that's what happened you got to respect God and she will be living like a prostitute in the street but she went to hell sealed the soul away already and we have people walking in hell hell on the earth that's why that's why brother B talk about hell and all the Beatles all the spirit up Beatles Michael Jackson all them all them all them fancy rock music and we call them D du people now and all them it's hell you know as soon as the beat gone them Spirits drop on an next set and they busting the tunes and hell just keep anointing fresh one and it it D do have right now fellow just get sick JayZ and JayZ and next one can your West and what it's demons upon them them is Hell's Angels there a Satan crew and they come now because the music have the influence to the youths and the young people and whatnot so they come now and and and when you start to read your Bible you're falling asleep you're pouring a tape you you know you using using the Bible as Sleep Therapy you using tape as Sleep Therapy you get trouble to sleep on a tape and that that come like sleep and Satan want to say use it use it use it yeah yeah that will put you to sleep you have nothing to hear and when you come to the you come to service now he fight you to be in the spirit so you getting the word you're getting just intellectual thing hitting your head nothing hit in your heart because all what we are preaching have to hit your heart for it to have effect upon your life we come here to lecture you you can go anywhere else and get that we come here to inspire you you have to be inspired Oh Glory to God hallelujah you have to have inspiration blind B he was he was begging accustom begging when he he J the other Street Lord Mery upon me so David somebody say he can't hear you he can't hear you he going louder yes he could accept that man next Jesus can literally hear him but you see Faith does go with the noise too [Applause] hallu you you not blind you see with your to high and you're not reach out in faith he's blind and he want a sight amen seem to have gone amen oh praise the Lord amen so but B says here [Music] hallu Hall hallelu h hallu hallu praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah are we back on track now oh fine praise God Amen so brother brandham if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in God that's exactly right respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him I've heard congregations talk about their pastor and run him down ridicule him how is that Pastor want to do anything for you he can't I don't say this church but I've seen churches you got to love your pastor you got to know he's a human being and yet God has made him his Pastor the Holy Ghost has made him overseer and then when you got to respect him in that manner listen and no matter what the pastor's done if you respect him in your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing it God will respect you for doing that amen so these wars you take these young kids talking about young people going in the Army they're the cream of the crop C they don't know no better knowing discipline Army discipline stick ah head up the hill let somebody shoot it off and the nation forgets them unless their family come back here many of soldiers but listen to this but a man seldom will you find one that will lay down his life for the cause of Christ I want you to think about that statement that's right people find for money bigger job bigger house want to this and that and everything else but what about the sacrifice for Christ for God's sake listen they wouldn't lay down their life for the cause of Christ he wouldn't even crawl out of a shade tree to go to church won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend a Wednesday night prayer meeting my God that's right it's a shame and disgrace that's the reason Angels don't visit the churches all right that's the reason Angels don't visit homes you mean Angel could visit homes yes we have got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing that's why it's disgusted to see the arrogance of people in this message as if God is obligated to them because they believe God's in a prophet God is not obligated to with that at all God is obligated to his word because even the devil believe and tremble so we have got to climb a little higher because Jesus busted his own disciples and say you have to have righteousness bigger than loving your own treating your own nice you got to go beyond that to love even your enemies you got to go beyond that Hallelujah to demonstrate that you are at a higher class a higher level a higher calling that is what this is about not to stay where you are but to lift you up higher could somebody say Amen notice whenever the call of God comes excuse me it always called to call you out of your comfort zone there was no scripture where God says stay there Abraham come out out of your own country come out from among your own people onto people I shall show you I don't Mi go call you go back home Hallelujah that's not how God call well how you feeling today your Fe didn't let them

mother father brother sister and and take up your cross and follow me you you not even of [Applause] me I don't want you clap on that I you say Amen because Jesus said [Music] it h you know Jesus is

taken they got the they torn under they were burned at the Stak for this gospel that we have here amen and they was passing on the battle from paulus to mtin to columus to Luther they keep passing the battle and baram drop it in the bride not brother Bram the mighty angel came down seven Thunders to the voices of watch what and God swore by himself he come too immutably can't listen in other words it is impossible for God to lie is one thing God can do is lie God can't lie he is a function of Truth so when he speak his word he's got to bring it to pass both his curse and His blessings he's got to bring it P when he tell Abraham by blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply and I multiply God cannot break [Music] that God cannot break his Blessing towards you and upon your life Hallelujah blessings could be delayed but not denied oh hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus praise God there are many things that change time changes people changes weather changes nature Nation changes but God is unchangeable amen he's the same all the time God is an infinite God and we could we we we we could use any word to explain the word or try to explain the word infinite he never had a beginning he will never had an end therefore when God called the scene to act or to make a decision the way he acts the decision he makes that is forever the same he cannot change it amen because he is perfect yes sir now you and I can say certain things next year we have to change it maybe or do something different because we are finite we do not know all things but he is perfect and his first decision will have to be his second decision will have to be like the first or if you make another decision then he is he did not act right when he make the first decision that will put him as fin out as us so God do something say God ouch I didn't realize it was going to move so you that mean God just like us but God can't do that so when he speaks his word that's why he could say by myself have I sworn Hallelujah and it could only swear by somebody greater than you but there was nobody greater than him amen amen you could only swear by somebody more powerful than you but there was nobody more powerful than him so he swore by himself that he will keep his Word of Promise oh I feel good my God that's why Paul could said death where is his thing grave where is your Victory these guys knew they had dep on the ropes Hallelujah these guys put their foot on De they couldn't stop that but they could put the foot on it Hallelujah and say you don't intimidate me Oh Glory to God praise God Peter said it's Amen more profitable for me to stay God show me I could go but I going to stay to help you some more them guys wasn't afraid of that they were solid taught Believers that understand debt is a promotion Hallelujah to be in a permanent presence of God and that your time up is up on Earth and this is only temporary got thousand years is just one day so your 7 years like oh say Amen somebody we think 70 years is a big thing it is not it's not a big thing and you're not going to lift up your 120 where your not is still true I don't know how long I'll be in the earth if God take me home God take me home if not I looking for the Rapture but I'm going to fight I say if I lose my teeth I use my gum Hallelujah but I'm going to fight Oh Glory to God you got to do something Hallelujah do you love him so brother brandham if there's a sick man pleas pleads to God for mercy and God give him mercy and healing on the basis of his faith the next man that come to the same ground ask the same questions God has to act the same way so God is unchangeable you he's got to come believing that God is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently or earnestly or energetically seek him not come to him no he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him listen to this you could get any blessing you want in God you could wrestle God and get what you want from God you could harise and believe and knock and ask and please until you get him I have to do something for that sister I've got to do something for that mother I've got to do something about that daughter ask it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find no don't hear me preaching it he Jesus say [Applause] it wonderful now the thing of it is God give it sometimes in a way we're not expecting it but always keeps his word hallelujah they wanted a savior and God say hold a baby his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Mighty God Amen who would have taught that baby Mary did you know that your baby boy Hallelujah would one day walk on Waters Mary didn't know that Jesus had a baby boy Mary did you know that your boy would one day save Sons and Daughters Hallelujah his life had to unfold and produce that but that was always locked up in Mary Hallelujah Mary baby boy oh he's not a baby boy today oh Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever and God didn't expect us to remain babies all along he ex coming to the knowledge of the Son of God your knowledge [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] hu [Applause] H Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah there had to be a reason that the enemy is fighting hallelujah praise God blessed be the name of the Lord so watch God gives it sometimes in a way that we're not expecting it and God always keeps his word there's no way for God to not to tell you anything and lie about it and remain God he cannot he must keep it that why God hate lying you know that why lying prophetes get stoned you know because God is the author of truth that's why people say God told me and God told me I tell people be careful when you talk that talk sometime God not telling them at all you they're lying on God you can't do that God doesn't lie all right brother Bram I may not have faith to make all things that he done live again but I will never stand in the road of somebody who has faith enough to do it I would be thanking God for that Faith Hallelujah see the spirit and attitude the prophet had he wouldn't go and hinder anybody who has Faith to step out to believe God I can go on record on this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God has ever made and claim it for yours amen here we go if you have the right mental attitude of any promise that God has made and claim it for as yours God will bring it to pass claim your healing claim your deliverance claim your breakthrough claim your blessings claim your inheritance claim your portion don't sit and don't say nothing amen hallelujah you have to be convinced that it need a word spoken for things to get activated I'll be healed I'll be delivered I'm

be healed oh praise God I won't be long again with you but brother mam says the word is a seed or so or so and a seed if it is a gumati seed it goes into the ground then that seed under the right condition with sun and moisture will bring forth the life that's in the seed so the word of God if a person take it and place it in their heart create the right atmosphere it going to produce itself so the key thing is to create the right atmosphere and the devil is fighting that atmosphere that atmosphere is what you can create create in your own home in your own heart you could choose not to hold Arts you could choose not to have a grudge and in your heart have a right atmosphere and you're waiting upon God and God will bless you [Applause] hallelujah praise God praise God the thing it is with people is the way God Appears many times we want to make an idol out of God we ask God for something and then he must do it just the way we ask itow you hear that he call that making an idol out of God I see people put I I know somebody used to cut the Bible I think there's a Baptist spirit wake up in the morning call the Bible the eyes fall on script for the day the word iut the Bible and come and tell me we not supposed to play back T in uh have TV in the church to play playing back message but that's a idol go she say an idol I said God show you that and when they come with the testimony so listen to them because see I'm afraid I'm not afraid to show them the exit we're not begging and buming and trying to drag anybody inside of here especially especially religious ones one who know they figure they know more than the preacher know more than God himself God doesn't have that God have a word for you the people sit down and they looking for what the dream to get confirmed and if the dream rain and the preacher on say rain they say oh Lord show me the rain dear boy they so important that God make sure the preacher say that to confirm that what is seen is and it's not so what you come here for is to get exposed that your life could be changed you want God to rip the things out of you that's not like him you want all the hindrances in your life that affecting your communication with God and with others you want your life to be purged and purified am hallu oh my I know we have some issue with the sound system but I see we're going to close off here Moses was 80 years old almost you might think too old for God to deal with he was an old man unexpected in his age to be dealt with with God and he was in an unexpected Place Mount Horeb and on an unexpected way God met Moses the way he usually me he didn't meet Moses the way he usually met men he met him with the pillar of fire isn't that right old man strange place but that God met him a certain way Hallelujah so now sometime he answers our prayer in the way he thinks is best I remember a sister had a dream she dreamed she was going through some dark Waters some some some some troubling Waters and so on and this brown skinned man was counseling and what not different things like that and whatnot now she was a real a bullhead P that Spirit whenever her husband is back in condition she in church she chur whenever her husband start to come straighten out and straighten out and whatnot she will stay and whip him and beat him down to Sid and take he back side so I see the spirit upon her and something like that so she had this dream of this man talking to her and straightening um talking to helping her and so like that so doing the dream now when I begin to talk to her and and straighten out and showing her operations she said no I said I am that man that dream you know she didn't believe dream after [Music] that I said this is your dream here being interpreted straighten you out but she didn't want that she figure when you ask her how your husband I praying for I'm praying for him I'm praying for him I praying for him cuz she didn't whip him into into non- entity already whip him straight out to the church cuz she so she's spiritually strong especially when he's weak she's strong when he begin to get the strength to stand up like a man in his own house forget it she stop coming to church he under pressure he under stress and that's that how went eventually everything break up all because she don't want she don't want to Humble herself to the word of God we all have to subject ourselves to the word of God oh praise the name of the Lord so sometime it may come as this guys it become another way around another way no matter what way it comes if we have to ask we shall receive God said so oh praise God now I almost going to wrap up here he said no the coming of the Lord no the coming of Jesus is so imminent the coming of judgment he is calling his elected together in Oneness with a particular Church in Trinidad no it didn't say that in Oneness with himself so when you hear Oneness with some church or some Pastor or Bishop you know that is plum off the beaten part it is Oneness with himself and he is the word hallelujah I I'll keep I'll keep this pray for me so what he's doing he's calling the elect out of the lutherans to make the wesan he called the elect wesan to make the Pentecostals now he is calling the elect Pentecostal to make up the headstone to come into it amen he's going to come into it isn't that right and he is dropping the same kind of ministry amongst them it wouldn't be my Ministry our ministry it will be his ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ and if it's his ministry it wouldn't be puffed up it wouldn't be arrogant it wouldn't be KN it all it wouldn't be above all and what it wouldn't be that it will be just what the Bible says hallelujah what the Bible talk about charity it Bear all things believeth all things hope it all things where is that everybody spiritual everybody super spiritual everybody on where is that one time bar was preaching and there was this man used to beat up preachers the man have a reputation okay his reputation went before him in B meetings he had about 200 men on the platform behind him them his preachers back in the prophet saying amen glory and sleeping sometimes when that man came up on the on the on the on in in the congregation he bought you snake in the grass don't ask me where the Deacon was maybe the Deacon heard about him and when deacons saw him deacons leave their post but that man came up in the meeting and he said you snake in the grass a hypocrite I'm going to kill you and so on but Abraham is standing there and he's preaching and after a while as the man get closer he spoke these words you have to say something he says you shall fall over my for because you challenge the spirit of God you will fall over my feet not fall at my feet over my feet the man came up walk out on the platform of course the 200 Brethren behind there were no longer on the platform so they leave this big 200 pounds man to face this 5ot short guy on the platform alone the man walk up on the platform and as the man come into brother brandham he said come out of him but before he said that he said a love came for that man he said maybe that man is a husband that man is a father he doesn't want to be in that condition whatever and I love for him as the man say Satan come out the man spin around and fall over his feet as he prophesied that to lift the man off of him before that somebody said call the police the church police abandoned post call the outside police but bam says there's not a flesh and blood Affair Hallelujah flesh and blood they not flesh and blood business this is this is something else they ask a question but Bram was that man delivered he said no he said he worships that Spirit he love it you see if you love whatever you have in your heart you will do we could talk now till we grayer turn black and come back Gray as long as you have something in your heart that that's why you have to have a heart surgery you have to have the right desires inside of you ask God to work on your heart that you have the right desires because the right desires give you the right aim ambition motive and objective and once that line up it's Bullseye never had a man once you have that heart for God it's Bullseye that's why God called David a man after my own heart because regardless of what David problem he had he loved God he has a heart for God he will fight for God he will cut off necks for God he will do whatever for God God first that's [Applause] David oh give the Lord a shout when you leave here have a heart for [Applause] God Revelation book of silvers he said if you got the holy spirit in you then you are candidate for association with the Unseen World and the super Supernatural oh praise God isn't that right when the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he you quickly become a twofold being one on the earth to die one of Heaven to live isn't that right so when the Holy Ghost come you come a twofold being isn't that right poured from heaven and poured from down on the earth my God it make you a Mystic on the earth Hallelujah you're genuine alien oh hallelujah praise God you you a foreigner Hal Hallelujah you're

magician I am God and I change not and God set up pharaoh to have me heart to make sure that he had to go so far as to bring on the dead Angel because God had to bring on the token so God had to put Pharaoh under certain pressure to raise the heat that It Go call for two things token and death angel amen that was the final showdown so when it Mark bus and they come to the final showdown God said listen take lamb take the kill the lamb take the blood apply it when I see the blood I'm going to pass over what God is doing he is foreshadowing the last days he's foreshadowing the death angel about to take out uncircumcised he's shattering the token of the Holy Ghost with virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience all the way up to the love of God which is the holy ghost that must be applied to your life as B told me thank God is the blood of Jesus is not chemistry and you had to pay money to go and fight to Jerusalem to touch some blood down there in in Jerusalem thank God it's
