[35:18] things
[35:19] so tonight we're here by the grace of
[35:21] God and if you have your Bibles return
[35:23] to two portion of scripture one from
[35:25] Isaiah 53
[35:28] and when we want to read the whole
[35:30] chapter 1 to 12 and Rule to Romans 8 11
[35:33] to 14. really appreciate brother Isaac
[35:35] sign a gap the cries of the Watchmen
[35:39] amen
[35:41] that's what I like to see soldiers
[35:43] there's two people three people three
[35:45] persons and you could stand there and
[35:46] Minister the word of God
[35:48] whatever condition it is and but again I
[35:52] still can't get over that what's your
[35:53] excuse
[35:54] that could ring over and over to every
[35:58] situation what is your excuse it all
[36:01] depends right
[36:03] all right so reading Isaiah 53
[36:06] who had believer report and to whom is
[36:08] the arm of the Lord revealed for he
[36:10] shall grow up before him as a tender
[36:12] plant as the root of the out of dry
[36:14] ground
[36:15] he had no form no communist when we
[36:18] shall see him there's no beauty that we
[36:20] should desire him what's your excuse
[36:23] he is despise what is your excuse
[36:25] rejected of men
[36:27] amount of Sorrows what is your excuse me
[36:30] with grief and we hid as it were or
[36:33] thesis on him
[36:34] he was his spy he's going to be esteem
[36:36] him not surely you're born all griefs
[36:39] and carried our sorrows yet we did as
[36:41] Steam him straight and smitten smitten
[36:44] of God and Afflicted but he was wounded
[36:47] for our transgression he was bruised for
[36:49] our iniquities and the chastisement of
[36:52] our peace was upon him I would have
[36:54] strikes we are healed all we like sheep
[36:56] have gone on a street we have turned
[36:58] everyone to his own way and the Lord
[37:00] that lead on him the iniquity of us all
[37:03] he was oppressed he was afflicted what's
[37:07] your excuse
[37:08] yeah he opened up his mouth
[37:10] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[37:12] as a sheep before he shares his dumb
[37:15] so you open up his mouth
[37:18] he was taken from prison and from
[37:19] judgment who had declared his generation
[37:22] for he was cut off out of the land of
[37:24] the living for the transgression of all
[37:26] my people's body straightened now we are
[37:29] reading this but this was prophecy at
[37:32] that time in Isaiah 53.
[37:34] verse 9 and he made his grave with the
[37:36] wicked and with the rich in his debt
[37:38] because he had done no violence you know
[37:40] it wasn't any seat in his mouth yet
[37:42] it pleased the Lord
[37:45] to bruise him what's our excuse
[37:48] he had put him to grief when thou shall
[37:51] make his soul an offering for sin he
[37:53] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[37:55] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[37:57] prosper in his hands he shall see all
[37:59] the travail of his soul and shall be
[38:02] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[38:04] righteous servant justify many for he
[38:07] shall bear the iniquities therefore will
[38:09] I divide him a portion with the greed he
[38:12] shall divide the spoil with the strong
[38:13] because he had poured out his soul unto
[38:16] death and he was numbered by the
[38:18] transgressors and he beared the sin of
[38:20] many and made intercession for the
[38:23] transgressions Romans 8 verse 11-14
[38:27] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[38:29] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[38:31] if
[38:33] he that raised it up Christ from the
[38:34] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[38:37] bodies by his spirit that dwell into you
[38:40] so that gives all the answers right
[38:42] there therefore brethren we are debtors
[38:44] not to the flesh
[38:46] to live after the flesh for if we live
[38:48] after the flesh you shall die but if you
[38:51] true the spirit of ye to the spirit do
[38:54] mortified the Deeds of the body you
[38:55] shall live for as many as are led by the
[38:58] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[39:00] let's pray one more time father we thank
[39:01] you for your word read the scriptures
[39:03] Lord may you come and breathe life into
[39:05] it and open up the word to us tonight
[39:09] oh praise the name of the Lord
[39:13] it's good to be in the house of God
[39:16] I always say that it's a privilege
[39:19] to be here and I believe that
[39:22] and Sunday was something just uh
[39:24] understanding that we can't take things
[39:26] for granted we could want to be here and
[39:29] things didn't work on for us to be here
[39:30] so it's a privilege when we get common
[39:32] house of God raise our hands they've got
[39:34] praise
[39:35] amen you don't know when God will call
[39:38] somebody's number
[39:39] and you have the answer to that call who
[39:42] praise the name of the Lord so tonight I
[39:45] have a title to tell
[39:47] to show
[39:48] and to prove
[39:50] that's what I would like to tell
[39:52] to show
[39:54] and to prove
[39:57] Hallelujah let's go
[40:00] so
[40:02] you know but around described this week
[40:05] as the greatest week and it is
[40:07] he said
[40:09] um because Easter he said notice the
[40:11] very okay I'll skip that there when he
[40:14] proved by his promise this great
[40:16] conquering power he had on Easter prove
[40:19] he could conquer the cell in the grave
[40:20] you see many men have died so the debt
[40:23] is not as as powerful as the actual
[40:27] Resurrection
[40:28] many men have died great men and so on
[40:31] but but Easter proved something
[40:33] his resurrection proves something that
[40:35] we have and you will see tonight access
[40:37] the stuff that others don't have access
[40:39] to because of this Resurrection
[40:42] Hallelujah and he called us not just to
[40:45] tell but to show unto proof that he's
[40:47] raised from the dead
[40:48] that is the real gospel
[40:50] we tell there's only one thought but we
[40:53] have to prove we have to show and prove
[40:55] that is the real essence of the Gospel
[40:57] we miss the market we don't get there
[40:59] our objective is to get there now we can
[41:02] prove what we're talking about that's
[41:04] what brother Brahman did he proved what
[41:06] he's talking about he can approve in
[41:08] India everywhere he go he can approved
[41:09] what he is talking about it wasn't it's

[44:19] house I had to say course in a prophet
[44:21] God said a prophet what did he prophesy
[44:23] what did he say would be here what must
[44:26] be identify how could we say this is
[44:28] that that the prophet William Branham

[45:27] God there's a bride on the earth there's
[45:29] nothing right
[45:32] when we as Christians who believe the
[45:36] Bible this Bible can prove what we're
[45:38] talking about
[45:39] I like that believe the Bible Bible
[45:42] believing Christians people know
[45:44] everybody messes but they know the Bible
[45:45] see there are no fundamental scriptures
[45:49] to identify because this Bible is all
[45:51] absolute not the message you know the
[45:53] Bible
[45:55] the Bible is the absolute that's that's
[45:58] that that's correct you know the Bible
[46:00] is the Absolution don't let nobody lie
[46:02] to you the Bible is the absolute that's
[46:04] why they have the reveal word they have
[46:06] to reveal the word the angel come to
[46:08] reveal the word that's why when the
[46:09] prophet hear from the angel you have to
[46:11] go back in the Bible to see if the angel
[46:13] talk about the Bible say because the
[46:15] angel is saying where that box is yeah
[46:16] the center Asia go away look at the Lord
[46:19] some Praises we have an absolute it's
[46:21] the scriptures Oh Glory the God he was
[46:24] here before William Branham was born it
[46:26] was here before Paul and I realized it
[46:28] was here it's the spirit of God wrote
[46:31] that word
[46:32] and the word itself is God tonight and
[46:36] the secret is
[46:37] the world is end up give the Lord some
[46:39] Praises tonight the bird is in that
[46:42] bread is rocking in that bride
[46:44] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Moses
[46:48] ran away but the word was in Moses more
[46:50] no hardest problems but it was but Moses
[46:52] Noah all of them
[46:54] part of God Pastor God's Gene path of
[46:56] God's thoughts is that right all right
[46:59] now what she has done
[47:00] oh here it is
[47:02] that's what makes as I said a while ago
[47:04] the salt of the earth
[47:06] the citizen said the world is looking
[47:08] for this salt and when we can prove by
[47:11] our lives and by the Bible that our
[47:14] lives are vindicating the word living
[47:17] today that's the day we're looking for
[47:20] could you imagine the world become flesh
[47:22] in you you start to live the word and
[47:24] people reading spoken books and they're
[47:26] not reading you
[47:27] no
[47:34] all they have is text
[47:35] and Jesus caught them with that he
[47:38] caught them with Moses texts and the
[47:40] prophecy of the Prophet Moses and when
[47:43] he started to live it they had problems
[47:45] Moses
[47:49] the old man you said before Iman was I
[47:51] am you had to drop some Mysteries upon
[47:53] them living Mysteries with no
[47:55] explanation he says he's a flesh Prophet
[47:58] that nothing is a spirit that quickness
[48:16] just intellectually there's dry scribe
[48:19] and Pharisees quoting scriptures and
[48:21] texts and quotes and playing tapes but
[48:23] when that Living Word say which one
[48:25] among you without sin cast the first
[48:28] stone they all walk aways and nearly I
[48:30] condemn thee what was that the Living
[48:32] Word Healing The Living Word delivering
[48:35] the Living Word baptizing The Living
[48:37] Word Redeeming the Living Word setting
[48:39] people free to reliving word breaking
[48:41] the bands of wickedness The Living Word
[48:43] open up the prison bars you're going to
[48:45] see The Living Word all over again that
[48:47] word will become flesh one more time in
[48:50] Trinidad and the invisible will become
[48:53] visible in Trinidad okay the Lord some
[48:55] Praises Oh Glory to God other savior
[48:58] Trinidad has evidence Church all right
[49:00] here we go now
[49:03] rumors eight
[49:06] right but a brown
[49:08] if this spirit
[49:11] that raise up Jesus Christ be in you
[49:15] it will also Quicken your mortal bodies
[49:19] so when we talk about rapture
[49:22] this is no guesting
[49:23] is there no flukes
[49:26] who says
[49:30] right here if this spirit
[49:33] the same
[49:35] spirit so he's not talking about Luther
[49:38] and Wesleyan and Pentecostals no same
[49:44] note same
[49:47] mother birth the same the person of
[49:50] Christ his spirit
[49:52] seven parts
[49:53] the same
[49:55] dwelling you that Spirit In You
[49:58] would Quicken your mortal body so when
[50:01] we talk about the Raptor is internal it
[50:03] is
[50:09] watch this now
[50:12] if this Spirit would raise up Jesus
[50:13] Christ being you will also Quicken your
[50:15] mortal bodies
[50:17] not only did he prove to him to us that
[50:20] he was your Redeemer and up over death
[50:22] hell in the grave but he has also are
[50:26] you ready
[50:27] give us the access
[50:30] to The Same Spirit
[50:34] season access denied
[50:37] but you
[50:38] sons and daughters have solid access
[50:42] to the same spirit that we ourselves
[50:46] yeah he's going deeper can have the
[50:49] assurance
[50:50] that we too are quickened by that spirit
[50:53] for the spirit that raised up Jesus on
[50:56] the dead dwells in your body
[50:58] so he's not talking about you know I
[50:59] wonder if
[51:00] somebody say maybe then we think
[51:07] a company tell me but over here adopted
[51:09] but he didn't do it yet what kind of
[51:11] nonsense is that that is foolishness
[51:13] that is total ignorance that is
[51:15] intellectual stupidity
[51:22] hear what he's saying here now he says
[51:24] we ourselves
[51:27] I know somebody's saying yeah but over I
[51:29] see a light over you therefore you
[51:30] adopted I know that you talk in your
[51:32] talk
[51:33] I didn't see it you see that
[51:35] go tell you that
[51:37] he said you will have the assurance that
[51:40] you are quickened by that spirit
[51:43] you having the Assurance Blessed
[51:46] assurance Jesus is
[51:48] mine
[51:52] it will also Quicken your mortal body
[51:54] now here we go the word Quicken means
[51:59] not what they say in Trinidad
[52:00] you gotta take what they would explain
[52:02] it the word quick means to be made alive
[52:05] after death
[52:08] not jumping jumping jumping you're quick
[52:10] and quicker than that you're dead
[52:12] it's like a lost equipment not that kind
[52:14] of
[52:16] quicker means that we made a life after
[52:18] that
[52:19] after it is dead it's to be quickened
[52:25] so do you see how we have to die
[52:28] in other words if Christ didn't go down
[52:29] to the Grave if Christ didn't die
[52:31] there's no Resurrection
[52:33] it took debt to produce a resurrection
[52:35] it took the death of a corner wheat to
[52:37] produce a Resurrection Life unfold into
[52:40] Luther and Wesley there's a history of
[52:42] the seven churches is the history of the
[52:44] sea life that unfolded after death after
[52:47] the seed went down into the ground the
[52:49] life unfolded produced a stalk and a
[52:52] tassel and everything else and a shock
[52:54] and then the seed it come down to you
[52:56] then you have to take your seed and die
[52:58] and that's what it says about there is
[53:00] no Sunday without Friday
[53:02] Oh Glory to God there is no Sunday
[53:04] without Friday Friday mid Sunday
[53:06] Possible Oh Glory to God in our Sunday
[53:09] broke the wanderings of what happened on
[53:11] Saturday
[53:13] Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God
[53:16] Friday didn't know he died but they
[53:17] wondered what happened on Saturday but
[53:19] Sunday morning and so all of that I am
[53:21] he that was dead and alive ever more go
[53:24] tell my disciples I am in a message
[53:26] don't tell them the Thunders are dead
[53:28] the Thunder's still alive Oh Glory the
[53:31] body is on New York Times from Christ's
[53:34] own mouth okay the Lord I shout praise
[53:37] God praise God oh give the Lord our son
[53:39] we are leaving them you know this is the
[53:42] seventh on the church okay there's
[53:44] Christ Ministry we have following John
[53:46] you know be following Jesus because
[53:48] billion prime numbers called to
[53:50] introduce the Messiah and the Messiah
[53:52] came down in Revelation 10 1 with the
[53:54] book open and seven thunderstorming
[53:57] voices out
[53:58] that's what made you different from
[54:00] every other group in a message oh every
[54:03] other brother every believer everybody
[54:04] else in the message because seven
[54:06] Tenants come together to break together
[54:07] they're sure about how to prepare and to
[54:10] tell them by faith for translation oh
[54:13] faith for body change oh give the Lord
[54:16] some Praises hate to be quickened by
[54:19] that same spirit that means Christ on
[54:21] the Dead
[54:22] spirit
[54:25] if the Lord I shout
[54:27] do you understand now why the prophet
[54:30] said this being when it's completed is
[54:33] the servant of God in the Church of God
[54:35] that's going in Rapture do you
[54:37] understand why he said that
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:39] [Music]
[54:44] Glory
[54:45] so brother Branham was fighting to get
[54:47] that same spirit
[54:49] back in the church
[54:50] they're going to bring Luther with a
[54:52] part portion Wesley on top of that then
[54:54] the Pentecost with the bird and then
[54:56] he'll bring the word because I take the
[54:57] word to be the channel of D spirit
[55:00] so you have to go and find the wood from
[55:01] Seven Ages that the seven spirits of God
[55:04] that was working through Seven Ages
[55:06] could come back in the church as seven
[55:08] voices thunders of God turning and
[55:11] sweetness and Holiness and Purity
[55:13] undefined lies walking around without
[55:15] our blemished that's the turn I will
[55:17] shake the devil and Shake him in every
[55:19] age it will give them good times in this
[55:21] age he could shake him and rock him in
[55:23] this age the sick is going to be healed
[55:25] the Bible is gonna see the death is
[55:27] gonna hear the death is going to be
[55:29] raised up by a living Christ in the
[55:31] church in the bright Church of Jesus
[55:33] Christ
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:35] [Music]
[55:37] thickened
[55:42] hello
[55:43] what about him
[55:46] Jesus said
[55:48] go therefore and teach All Nations
[55:51] and prove to them
[55:54] by demonstrating the power of God to
[55:57] them
[55:58] these signs
[56:00] shall follow
[56:01] them that believe
[56:04] them who promise and say they believe he
[56:07] give us a definite different
[56:08] understanding of it
[56:14] Prophet tip
[56:16] and the world what the prophet do and
[56:17] say God sent a prophet to look nice at
[56:19] the light over your head
[56:22] Jesus said not Prophet said
[56:25] not brother to you're saying this is a
[56:29] change now these
[56:31] signs
[56:33] shall follow
[56:35] them
[56:37] not Precision of them
[56:39] who's them you're part of them he's
[56:41] talking about them that believe I
[56:44] believe us
[56:45] thanks Bill you have to believe that if
[56:47] you I believe I can follow you
[56:49] foreign
[56:52] [Applause]
[56:52] [Music]
[56:54] would follow them I believe it would be
[56:58] a proof
[56:59] of the testimony
[57:02] now we can say We Believe
[57:04] but until we have proven sane
[57:08] that he said will be upon us
[57:10] then we are just confessing to be
[57:13] Believers but not the possession of the
[57:16] levers
[57:18] so he is
[57:20] he says have confession
[57:22] and possession
[57:24] if these signs are following you you're
[57:26] still pressing to possession
[57:27] you have to have you must confess before
[57:30] you possess okay
[57:32] do you get that tonight
[57:35] you have to tell
[57:37] before you could show
[57:39] and after you show you a good proof
[57:42] all right let's go
[57:44] praise God so Paul
[57:47] he said ordain the gifts in the church
[57:49] First Corinthians 15 he set the church
[57:51] the gifts of speaking in tongues
[57:53] Miracles all these other gifts were set
[57:54] in the church and Jesus said he repeated
[57:57] it again going into all the world and
[58:00] preach the gospel to Every Creature how
[58:03] far all the world who too every creature
[58:06] they never receive it yet and these
[58:08] signs shall follow them I believe how
[58:10] long
[58:13] these signs shall follow them in all the
[58:16] world in every creature these sides have
[58:18] followed them in my name they shall cast
[58:20] out Devils speak with new tongues and
[58:23] they shall take up deadly thing or
[58:25] serpent deadly thing will not harm them
[58:27] they will lay hands and sick and they
[58:29] shall recover this was his last
[58:30] commission to the church
[58:32] no devil can't say your calorie
[58:34] secondary and and like somebody in the
[58:37] prayer
[58:39] will the devil in charge of it
[58:42] the Devil he's a boss
[58:48] all the time before Jesus come and
[58:50] receive nobody could identify devils and
[58:52] demons and whatnot
[58:54] there's no people in policy they know
[58:56] people sick and whatnot but there was no
[58:58] identification because this
[58:59] manifestation was not known before
[59:03] so when Jesus came Jesus shook the world
[59:06] the religious world because he was
[59:08] exposing the spirits that they couldn't
[59:10] design and couldn't deal with
[59:12] and that is why the woman with the
[59:15] daughter of X with the devil no she
[59:17] can't go these current Pharisees with
[59:18] them things
[59:20] people are not stupid
[59:22] you want to play in foolish and because
[59:24] she he born and said she morning
[59:25] grandmother went in that church they
[59:28] fight describe and Pharisees there's

[1:00:58] brother Branham
[1:01:00] he says no watch that was his last
[1:01:02] commission to the church Paul is in
[1:01:05] ordaining these gifts into the church 30
[1:01:07] years later in Galatians 1 8 he said if
[1:01:10] an angel from heaven preaches to you any
[1:01:13] other gospel then which had already been
[1:01:15] received already been preached let him
[1:01:17] be a curse for the brown I believe that
[1:01:20] Pentecost began without an ending
[1:01:23] I believe it's to be in every creature
[1:01:26] all times at all places that Pentecost
[1:01:31] would always remain the Pentecostal
[1:01:34] blessing should be upon the people
[1:01:36] we shall take that as an absolute we
[1:01:38] shall take that as a fact we shall take
[1:01:40] that but no compromise the Pentecostal
[1:01:43] blessing is promised it should be here
[1:01:45] it's all people it's all times we have
[1:01:49] access to it oh get the Lord Our Praise
[1:01:52] offering the devil cannot get the Holy
[1:01:54] Ghost but you can get the Lord some
[1:01:57] praises
[1:02:00] he don't have the seed he is not a seed
[1:02:04] you have the seed there may be
[1:02:05] corruption around it there may be all
[1:02:07] kind of issues about it that doesn't
[1:02:09] change who you are that's why Jacob
[1:02:11] although he was a rascal although he was
[1:02:13] a trickster and whatever it is he fought
[1:02:15] for the birthright there was something
[1:02:16] inside of him that long for the
[1:02:19] birthright he so despised it but Jacob
[1:02:21] loved it and God said he saw a hate and
[1:02:24] Jacob I love oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:02:27] the house God love you tonight that is
[1:02:30] why you're here praise God praise God
[1:02:33] you're struggling but he ain't give up
[1:02:34] praise God Hallelujah the main thing and
[1:02:36] if you give up you finish you're done
[1:02:38] praise God don't you ever give up you
[1:02:40] keep fighting anyhow you keep pressing
[1:02:43] on your own you say God Will Make A Way
[1:02:45] somehow Oh Glory to God if I live a holy
[1:02:48] life shun the wrong and do the right God
[1:02:50] will make a way for me oh God I don't
[1:02:53] know how but he will make a way
[1:02:55] Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:58] praise the name of the Lord Brother
[1:03:01] Branham
[1:03:03] please God praise God I am wondering
[1:03:06] today
[1:03:08] it's what is happening
[1:03:10] are we really getting the people to God
[1:03:16] are we just letting them to church
[1:03:18] we must
[1:03:20] get them to Christ where there is this
[1:03:23] quickening power
[1:03:25] not just Christ you know we are against
[1:03:27] Christ the Mysteries we are together
[1:03:29] with Christ The Hidden Mysteries
[1:03:32] right under Christ deceiver Mysteries we
[1:03:34] talk about the Christ that has
[1:03:35] quickening power
[1:03:37] because the great thing power is what
[1:03:39] you'd have to deal with your children be
[1:03:41] quick then power is what happened with
[1:03:43] your wife the quickness power is
[1:03:44] whatever deal with your husband if
[1:03:46] pregnant power is what you deal with on
[1:03:48] your job the quickening power deal with
[1:03:50] your Blues
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:59] when they drink it in the water they're
[1:04:00] drinking
[1:04:01] it's spirits
[1:04:05] there we have sent it here with all the
[1:04:07] blues they say pass me a cold bottle of
[1:04:10] water you know no they want spirits
[1:04:13] they want rum they want whiskey they
[1:04:16] want something I get them a chance they
[1:04:17] had bad well when God knows Spirits you
[1:04:20] need but not that kind of spirit you
[1:04:23] need Holy Spirit we just drink Spirit
[1:04:26] you know oh if you drink of this water
[1:04:28] you shall bang you shall never taste
[1:04:31] again is that water to drink you know
[1:04:33] it's a spiritual drinking and when you
[1:04:36] drink that Spirit they charge you
[1:04:38] it's Quicken you it's anoints you it
[1:04:42] refreshes you it's a refreshing from God
[1:04:45] it's a refreshing you're getting tonight
[1:04:47] that's a spirit quick and power the
[1:04:51] anointing they would like to talk about
[1:04:53] it but it has to have it
[1:04:55] coming to Christ
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:05:01] so when people are supposed to be
[1:05:02] getting the spirit they write their
[1:05:03] notes
[1:05:04] like the devil you know not devil making
[1:05:06] them right notes you know but the devil
[1:05:08] fighting them from getting in the spirit
[1:05:10] because in the spirit is where you can
[1:05:12] get Revelation and Revelation is
[1:05:14] prevailing power you think the devil
[1:05:16] don't understand that once you get in
[1:05:17] the spiritual Revelation you need Blues
[1:05:19] are depression and whatnot go another
[1:05:20] girl for that spirit in that Spirit you
[1:05:22] can't get no Revelation you'll be person
[1:05:24] you need angel cake
[1:05:26] you need something to help you out of
[1:05:27] that praise God when the prophet gets
[1:05:29] back he said bring me a Minstrel where
[1:05:31] you want that menstrual for to get him
[1:05:33] out of that blue sting or that vexation
[1:05:35] business how we could prophesy when
[1:05:36] you're not in the spirit he can't hear
[1:05:38] from God all to the spirit you can't
[1:05:40] hear from God all to the spirit the
[1:05:42] devil sight in the spirit but we gonna
[1:05:44] fight right back oh give the Lord a
[1:05:46] shout he fighting but we're gonna fight
[1:05:48] right back there is a church with a
[1:05:50] spirit line in it that's what Abel
[1:05:52] caught a revelation a spirit line
[1:05:55] Revelation and he hold to that line
[1:05:58] foreign
[1:06:12] not everybody like me God make one one
[1:06:14] on my kind when you make my money that
[1:06:17] that brand
[1:06:24] he started wandering
[1:06:26] it's what's happening
[1:06:27] are we really getting the people to God
[1:06:30] are we just getting them to church
[1:06:33] we must get them to Christ wear this
[1:06:36] quick and power it's good to go to
[1:06:38] church sure it's as fast we can go but
[1:06:40] it's not far enough
[1:06:42] when you come to church that's good but
[1:06:45] go on to Christ from the church because
[1:06:49] we must receive this quick and Power
[1:06:53] I hear somebody Mysteries Christ is the
[1:06:56] mystery in you hope of glory
[1:06:58] but you see this here
[1:07:00] must
[1:07:01] you see the quickening power
[1:07:03] if we ever expect to be in that General
[1:07:06] Resurrection
[1:07:11] let them drop the Mysteries behind that
[1:07:13] one
[1:07:15] but your blast the Ministries that see
[1:07:17] that people say I don't like Mysteries
[1:07:18] you know
[1:07:21] because you see what happened their life
[1:07:23] is a mystery
[1:07:26] the preaching mystery but the mystery is
[1:07:28] really light
[1:07:30] that's your life
[1:07:31] all right let's go he said no no
[1:07:34] watch because it's the only thing that
[1:07:37] will ever bring us from the dead if this
[1:07:40] Same Spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:07:42] dead dwell in you it would also quickly
[1:07:45] make bring to life your mortal body what
[1:07:48] is a promise to us
[1:07:50] and this is where I get the inspiration
[1:07:51] from here now
[1:07:53] notice
[1:07:55] the very essence of this Resurrection
[1:07:58] is to tell
[1:08:00] and to show
[1:08:02] and to prove that Jesus has raised from
[1:08:05] the dead
[1:08:07] not Harmony message
[1:08:10] not God's in a prophet
[1:08:13] not a half books
[1:08:16] is to tell
[1:08:18] it's to show
[1:08:19] it is to prove that Jesus Christ is
[1:08:23] raised from the dead
[1:08:25] look at those disciples those disciples
[1:08:27] from a man who not working with them
[1:08:29] preaching Jesus
[1:08:30] and they asked Jesus if we should suit
[1:08:32] them trying to form a denomination you
[1:08:35] know
[1:08:35] they try to form a business group
[1:08:37] they're trying to form a group of people
[1:08:38] that you know he's not with us therefore
[1:08:40] we should stop him
[1:08:42] die people you message you know I'm not
[1:08:44] with them so they're trying to stop me
[1:08:45] are you saying nothing I wanted to
[1:08:47] invite you know I ain't looking at that
[1:08:48] you know me already I ain't saying that
[1:08:50] they say who should I just talk about
[1:08:51] you nobody shall not stop me just the
[1:08:53] devil same devil if I tell me fighting
[1:08:55] all of them brothers over there all them
[1:08:56] choices over there is one devil we fight
[1:08:57] them but they're showing you the spirit
[1:08:59] and his disciples they want to stop that
[1:09:01] Manchester City man alone
[1:09:06] not because you're not part of our
[1:09:08] organization that you will cut him off
[1:09:09] leave the man alone he'll be talking
[1:09:12] about Christ and he preaching the gospel
[1:09:13] leave them he doing some good thing
[1:09:15] was getting jealous
[1:09:18] then I fight
[1:09:22] double the one who greater who are more
[1:09:24] Revelation who's stronger more
[1:09:31] Holy Ghost you know that argument no
[1:09:33] Holy Ghost
[1:09:34] dispute no Holy Ghost because once the
[1:09:36] Holy Ghost comes
[1:09:42] in the church
[1:09:44] they don't mind this I am that no no no
[1:09:47] God set in the church and what God sat
[1:09:49] in the church room and on set no man
[1:09:51] could change Philip go here this one go
[1:09:53] dear this one do this here I know Bishop
[1:09:55] the answer to no headquarters the answer
[1:09:57] to okay the Lord some Praises that
[1:10:00] coming back you know because there's
[1:10:01] going to be another book of Acts who
[1:10:03] said that God said that this prophesied
[1:10:06] nobody gonna stop that there's gonna be
[1:10:08] another book of Acts I'm excited about
[1:10:10] this message oh glory to God around says
[1:10:13] 1975 I was like I know getting started
[1:10:15] this thing no coming is that the jump up
[1:10:17] now oh glory to God equipment power he
[1:10:20] is not dead he's raised from the dead oh
[1:10:22] God I ain't gonna die or nothing
[1:10:24] happened David said I shall not die but
[1:10:26] live to declare the works of the Lord
[1:10:29] the Lord are chasing me sore but he had
[1:10:31] not given me over unto death or plan to
[1:10:34] me the gates of righteousness or I shall
[1:10:36] enter into the gates Oh Glory to God oh
[1:10:40] the voice of rejoicing I like that one
[1:10:42] is in the Tabernacles of the righteous
[1:10:44] yeah
[1:10:47] Glory
[1:10:49] another one
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:52] notice the very essence of this
[1:10:55] Resurrection is a tell and to show and
[1:10:59] to prove that Jesus has raised from the
[1:11:02] dead he is not dead he's living he lives
[1:11:05] here he lives in us I'll be with you
[1:11:07] even in you a little while the world
[1:11:10] sees me no more yet he shall see me for
[1:11:12] I will be with you even in you unto the
[1:11:15] end of the world now as Christians we
[1:11:19] all claim he's alive we have been
[1:11:21] quickened from life from Death To Life
[1:11:23] by his spirit and if he hasn't been
[1:11:25] quickened then we are not made alive now
[1:11:27] we're going to break this subject he
[1:11:28] said oh we are quickly and we can be
[1:11:30] sure this is the truth now this is your
[1:11:32] own life this is my life if this isn't
[1:11:35] the truth I'm fixing to say I'm one of
[1:11:37] the most foolish people in the world
[1:11:38] I've given my life for something of
[1:11:40] nothing to it but if it's the truth I
[1:11:43] owe everything that I am I owe
[1:11:46] everything that I could be to the cause
[1:11:48] of which we are standing for and I think
[1:11:51] here we go here the bomb I think we
[1:11:53] mustn't lose our enthusiasm
[1:12:00] everybody not in church tonight so I
[1:12:02] suppose today oh gosh that's all that

[1:18:04] especially after the service come bring
[1:18:06] this is not equipment
[1:18:08] I just I'm just making a point
[1:18:10] I'm not saying anything against that you
[1:18:11] know just making a point could we do
[1:18:13] that too but I'm saying
[1:18:15] but Abraham say is the spirit that
[1:18:17] quickens not the word
[1:18:21] as good as the word is
[1:18:25] let me continue
[1:18:26] it is the spirit of quickness it's not
[1:18:28] the word of quickness it is a spirit of
[1:18:30] quickness the word
[1:18:33] or gives the word life
[1:18:35] or give it wings to fly
[1:18:38] or give it access
[1:18:41] it is the spirit that does that
[1:18:43] and I have John 6 63 Jesus speaks it is
[1:18:47] the spirit that quick net the flesh
[1:18:49] Prophet had nothing the words that I
[1:18:51] speak unto you their spirit and their
[1:18:53] life that means this word could turn
[1:18:55] anytime
[1:18:58] do you get that
[1:19:01] the word is the word but the word is
[1:19:03] also Spirit but to take the spirit to
[1:19:05] quickly so when the word turned the
[1:19:07] spirit is equipped in power
[1:19:09] and when the word turning you is the
[1:19:11] kingdom in you
[1:19:13] in other words the word made manifest in
[1:19:16] you is the kingdom in you behold the
[1:19:19] kingdom is within you

[1:25:36] all I preaching I know on page four
[1:25:42] they don't steal food you know
[1:25:45] they reheated
[1:25:52] this expressions
[1:25:57] fresh carcass
[1:25:59] all right
[1:26:02] there's some way you do what I'm saying
[1:26:04] God had to get this quick in life into
[1:26:08] your mortal bodies I am talking about
[1:26:10] your body
[1:26:12] he's going deeper going deeper than that
[1:26:14] Jesus was the word
[1:26:16] you believe that don't you he called
[1:26:18] John 1 in the beginning of the word was
[1:26:19] with God what was God would mean flesh
[1:26:22] into our mouths no here we go this is
[1:26:24] deep
[1:26:25] as the promised Messiah
[1:26:28] Jesus
[1:26:30] he
[1:26:32] Jesus
[1:26:33] Quicken every word
[1:26:35] that was prophesied that he would do
[1:26:39] he
[1:26:41] written it
[1:26:45] heal the sick show he born of aversion
[1:26:47] all of that is true he was the word
[1:26:49] manifest on Earth but he could not do
[1:26:52] this as a man
[1:26:55] it taking the spirit of God
[1:26:58] dwelling in him
[1:27:01] to Quicken these promises to him
[1:27:04] so Jesus himself had to Quicken the
[1:27:07] promises to him that's why the scripture
[1:27:09] when the woman brought the I think the
[1:27:11] alabaster box then he understood
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:17] that the anointing was for his burial
[1:27:20] the word was coming to him
[1:27:23] I quickened to him where the season is
[1:27:25] changing now so the woman come to bring
[1:27:27] that because you're moving the next
[1:27:29] Channel praise God for me Oh Glory hey I
[1:27:32] feel the anointed on that
[1:27:42] he could not do this as a man
[1:27:45] taking the spirit of God
[1:27:47] dwell into him to Quicken these promises
[1:27:49] to him I hope we get this real clear now
[1:27:54] prophet
[1:27:55] Jesus is drilling it down
[1:27:59] Jesus being a man himself the body
[1:28:05] all right flesh Jesus
[1:28:08] but it took the spirit in him
[1:28:10] the spirit
[1:28:12] then he quoted Jesus it's not me to do
[1:28:14] the works it's my father that dwelleth
[1:28:16] in me he's the one that does the work
[1:28:18] See Jesus himself was the word
[1:28:22] but to take a spirit
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:25] foreign
[1:28:33] has to become the word
[1:28:36] that the spirit could monk the bride
[1:28:38] and give the bride a voice
[1:28:41] because the bride with the spirit upon
[1:28:43] her would be the word manifested what
[1:28:45] did Jesus do after you overcome the
[1:28:47] devil and he found a place where it's
[1:28:48] written what what the scripture say the
[1:28:49] scriptures have said it the spirit
[1:28:52] is upon me
[1:28:54] who is he who is upon me who is the me
[1:28:56] the word
[1:28:58] do you understand that he couldn't come
[1:29:01] without his Spirit upon him the spirit
[1:29:03] had to be upon him because that is what
[1:29:05] Messiah is the anointed one
[1:29:08] Oh Glory to God so you'll be in the word
[1:29:11] is not enough you have to become
[1:29:13] anointed word that makes you a messiah
[1:29:16] or a messiah
[1:29:18] oh give the Lord a shout a little
[1:29:20] Messiah because you are now anointed
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:25] do you get that tonight
[1:29:29] all right
[1:29:33] Jesus
[1:29:35] he was predestinated
[1:29:38] wow by default knowledge of God how God
[1:29:41] plan was to be he was in a redeemer and
[1:29:44] this Redeemer could only be a son so
[1:29:46] that was God's promise all the way from
[1:29:48] the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be
[1:29:50] here here he was as a man born of a
[1:29:53] vision but
[1:29:57] it taken the
[1:29:59] King the god to greaten that word to him
[1:30:02] so even Jesus had to get the quick in
[1:30:05] power quickening the wood to him and he
[1:30:08] was the word Quicken the word Quicken
[1:30:10] for that hour so watch so oh we have the
[1:30:13] word
[1:30:14] but the word must be quickened for the
[1:30:17] hour
[1:30:18] do you get it now the time had come when
[1:30:21] he wanted to be a redeemer the Lord
[1:30:22] failed other things that failed nobody
[1:30:24] takes a redeemer and he was the promised
[1:30:26] Redeemer he was quickened by the word
[1:30:28] and watch but Abraham says no you are
[1:30:32] right now you
[1:30:36] it was
[1:30:38] so we just talk about Jesus right
[1:30:39] predestinian seed right let's talk about
[1:30:41] you
[1:30:43] speak in the word now you are a
[1:30:45] predestinancy just like Christ was and
[1:30:48] when not if when the rain falls
[1:30:51] on the seed the life produces itself
[1:30:55] when the Holy Spirit Falls
[1:30:58] now I want you to see the Holy Spirit as
[1:31:00] the spirit itself The Same Spirit that
[1:31:04] fell under the Pentecost that Spirit not
[1:31:06] pentecosting no not 1906 the Holy Spirit
[1:31:09] you shall receive power when after the
[1:31:12] Holy Ghost come upon you
[1:31:15] Oh Glory to God and the Holy Ghost
[1:31:17] couldn't come until the world was
[1:31:18] restored that's why he sent a prophet to
[1:31:21] carry all the scattered word that tied
[1:31:23] back into the world to bring down the
[1:31:25] Holy Ghost the objective was always to
[1:31:27] bring down the pectin power it's the
[1:31:28] flesh Prophet that nothing oh give the
[1:31:31] Lord a shout in the house the objective
[1:31:34] was to bring Spirit to you
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:37] how could Spirit come to us and there
[1:31:39] isn't that channel of the World open up
[1:31:42] because the word is a conductor of the
[1:31:44] spirit
[1:31:45] so what are the common lady plummeting
[1:31:47] us that's why they would have to be in
[1:31:48] the bride when the spirit hit the bright
[1:31:50] soul is magnetism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] that's the big magnet coming to pick up
[1:31:55] what's inside of you
[1:31:57] all right let me see if we can finish
[1:31:58] off your musicians
[1:32:01] how do I close off here
[1:32:05] foreign
[1:32:14] these seeds
[1:32:16] so watch the predestinated the changes
[1:32:19] Ministry the anointing not in them yet
[1:32:21] it was upon them so the healing said
[1:32:24] cast no Devils they say Lord devil
[1:32:25] subject to us he said no Rejoice because
[1:32:27] Devil's subject to you we tried to call
[1:32:29] your name in heaven but he can't tell
[1:32:31] them yeah to get so I'm feeling good and
[1:32:34] special because they are wrong Jesus and
[1:32:36] they partake in Jesus ministry and
[1:32:38] sharing with the ministry including
[1:32:40] Judas right so therefore he said they
[1:32:43] hold himself in the upper room of course
[1:32:44] Jesus Jesus missed that whole and this
[1:32:48] is the word sees word and the Word was
[1:32:50] laying on there without life in it in
[1:32:52] them all of a sudden they come a song
[1:32:54] from Heaven as the waters begin to gush
[1:32:56] down and it actually filled all the
[1:32:59] house where they were sitting and the
[1:33:01] seeds begin to grow they begin to
[1:33:03] manifest itself the word of God being
[1:33:06] manifested
[1:33:07] so therefore the seed in them no life
[1:33:10] they have the word in them secret is the
[1:33:11] word is in Peter the word is in Mary the
[1:33:13] word is in the Mary Magdalene the word
[1:33:15] is no one of them are dead but they
[1:33:17] would they're fighting in the upper room
[1:33:18] they're scared they close the door
[1:33:20] they're written or behold wait tearing
[1:33:22] the Jerusalem until powerful man high
[1:33:24] their scriptures we start my lips I'm
[1:33:26] not a tongue I'll speak to the people
[1:33:28] there are scriptures they shall come to
[1:33:29] pass afterwards I'll Port my spirit upon
[1:33:31] All Flesh there are scriptures waiting
[1:33:33] to be manifested Jesus openly
[1:33:35] understands the scriptures he opened the
[1:33:36] word to them and they laying with these
[1:33:38] scriptures praising God continually
[1:33:40] creating an atmosphere for the holy
[1:33:42] ghosts are coming upon them and when the
[1:33:44] day of Pentecost was fully Come Oh Glory
[1:33:46] to God it was in one mind and one Accord
[1:33:48] and suddenly they come outside from
[1:33:49] Heaven fill all the house when they were
[1:33:51] sitting the first thing Peter step on
[1:33:53] and said this is that that the prophet
[1:33:55] Joel he identified the anoint and the
[1:33:57] power the Dynamics back in the
[1:33:59] scriptures this is that that the prophet
[1:34:01] johans speak of it's fulfilled now oh we
[1:34:04] have it we can prove it we could tell it
[1:34:16] rise up and walk
[1:34:18] foreign
[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:26] they were telling it these people are
[1:34:28] not drunk as you suppose they were
[1:34:30] telling it Satan didn't move but when
[1:34:33] Peter began to show it and begin to
[1:34:35] manifest it and the purpose of the work
[1:34:37] they say we have to stop this thing
[1:34:39] we're not here to tell we have to show
[1:34:42] and to prove he's the same yesterday to
[1:34:44] Dance Forever he has raised from the
[1:34:46] dead I'm gonna close up here tonight
[1:34:50] oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:34:54] praise God praise God
[1:34:57] let me skip it
[1:34:59] we become Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:35:02] that same Spirit by the full knowledge
[1:35:04] of God look at the Millions on Earth
[1:35:06] that didn't receive it when Jesus was
[1:35:08] here how thankful we should be this
[1:35:10] morning to know that we have the direct
[1:35:13] evidence and the Bible proves that we
[1:35:15] have included in that great Resurrection
[1:35:17] morning coming that great Easter we have
[1:35:20] the earnest of it right now in all
[1:35:22] Mortal bodies watch yeah this mystery
[1:35:24] here this secretary the predestinence
[1:35:27] the ones are at the first of course to
[1:35:29] be quickened
[1:35:31] when the Holy Spirit comes to claim its
[1:35:33] own
[1:35:34] before everybody gets anointed the true
[1:35:36] anointed comes forth first
[1:35:39] then before dollars get the same
[1:35:40] anointing Africa but the true ones will
[1:35:43] be quick and full there will be a bad
[1:35:45] Revival that is spread to the rest
[1:35:48] don't want to call it the foolish win
[1:35:49] Revival but they seem anointing
[1:35:52] see but the quickening power comes to
[1:35:53] the predestinated face
[1:35:55] oh are you with me
[1:35:58] my Lord
[1:35:59] praise God you remember he said watch
[1:36:02] watch he said uh you was thinking you
[1:36:06] were part of him therefore he could tell
[1:36:08] all right therefore he could tell the
[1:36:10] end from the beginning because he's
[1:36:11] Eternal and you being a Son of God or
[1:36:13] daughter of God then you were in his
[1:36:15] thinking at the beginning and when the
[1:36:17] Holy Spirit comes and you're on Earth
[1:36:18] walking around here as a sinner we don't
[1:36:21] in your life there is something you
[1:36:22] don't know what's taking place but
[1:36:24] you're hungry I hear the Presbyterian
[1:36:25] brother where the puppy is talking about
[1:36:27] it back there he was a Free Will Baptist
[1:36:29] and my fellow brother there's something
[1:36:31] in you something that you you never put
[1:36:33] in there it was something that you
[1:36:35] couldn't desire to be in there it is
[1:36:36] something that's contrary to your own
[1:36:38] nature it's to foreknowledge of God
[1:36:40] taking place God's word praise God so
[1:36:44] what Abraham says now here's the
[1:36:45] predestined plan in plain view
[1:36:47] just as other sees the word of God is a
[1:36:50] seed and must have grown prepared
[1:36:52] beforehand if you sow a seed and throw
[1:36:54] it out there birds will take it so God
[1:36:56] watch so the ground has to be made ready
[1:36:58] first so God in Sovereign Grace prepares
[1:37:01] the heart first he prepared you when
[1:37:03] before the foundation of the world to
[1:37:06] receive him in this age he foreknew You
[1:37:08] by his foreknowledge and ordained you to
[1:37:10] eternal life he knew you therefore he
[1:37:12] prepared you he knew you therefore he oh
[1:37:15] God this is sweet tonight what that's
[1:37:18] the reason you staggered out of these
[1:37:20] things and stagger into what you have no
[1:37:23] it was God leading you to the place
[1:37:25] where you're deemed for you to be
[1:37:27] [Applause]
[1:37:29] glory to God hallelujah and that's the
[1:37:33] reason the seed of faith when you're
[1:37:35] preaching Faith see the resilience of
[1:37:37] the Lord and see what take place all the
[1:37:38] gifts of the Bible where can people
[1:37:40] working themselves up oh Hallelujah I
[1:37:41] believe it and come up and find yourself
[1:37:43] disappointed the ground has to be
[1:37:45] fordained before and then your strikes
[1:37:48] hallelujah praise God he said no watch
[1:37:52] and as Pentecostal people today let me
[1:37:54] say this that we are standing in this
[1:37:56] last day where God promises Potter his
[1:37:58] Spirit Upon My Flesh and his sons and
[1:38:00] daughters should prophesy for he said
[1:38:01] these signs shall follow them I believe
[1:38:03] it's the hour that what makes the
[1:38:05] creation in you praise God why you talk
[1:38:08] about any church is the atmosphere I'm
[1:38:10] going to skip it here atmosphere praise
[1:38:12] God the atmosphere so God in every age
[1:38:15] ordain Institution for that age a
[1:38:17] message for that age that day could have
[1:38:19] laws and anything as they want to but
[1:38:21] when that overcomes the holy spirit of
[1:38:23] God which was at the beginning taught
[1:38:25] out and spoken for that age that Spirit
[1:38:27] hunts that egg and when he hears the
[1:38:29] message did nothing wouldn't stop him
[1:38:31] again God put something inside of you
[1:38:33] praise God I'm not even talking about
[1:38:35] the message message text I'm talking
[1:38:37] about the spirit message that coming
[1:38:39] behind the message I'm talking about the
[1:38:41] message in the message the spirit will
[1:38:43] go out and when that Spirit go out they
[1:38:45] go hunt the seas in this message that
[1:38:47] has the word in them and pull them out
[1:38:49] and bring them out no man ain't gonna
[1:38:51] stop them no passing will stop them the
[1:38:53] spirit will speak to them the bride will
[1:38:56] hear direct from God the spirit will
[1:38:58] speak to them there will be a Revival
[1:38:59] there will be a gathering oh praise God

[1:39:40] something within the believer I don't
[1:39:42] care how loyalist father was to the
[1:39:43] church how loyalist mother was his
[1:39:45] grandparents in the church is teaching
[1:39:47] contrary but if the church is teaching
[1:39:50] contrary to this hour of the baptism of
[1:39:53] the Holy Ghost message
[1:39:56] yeah we call it that's the message you
[1:39:58] know the Bible mentioned there is
[1:40:00] something in him that screams out with

[1:40:35] looking for those individuals that God
[1:40:38] has ordain the life in this age and as
[1:40:40] soon as it finds it it does just like it
[1:40:42] did on Jesus Christ the great super Son
[1:40:45] of God who redeemed us all it comes down
[1:40:47] and takes the place and Abode into the
[1:40:50] human life notice it brought the
[1:40:52] quickness power that quick then power
[1:40:54] has come upon Jesus Quicken him to
[1:40:56] manifest every promise of her for that
[1:40:58] day so does the holy spirit that come
[1:41:01] upon us in this day it's not Holy Spirit
[1:41:04] you are not the devil mocking the holy
[1:41:07] spirit it's the real true Holy Spirit it
[1:41:10] will manifest the promise of the hour
[1:41:12] Oh Glory to God this is your home
[1:41:14] stretch here when it fell upon Luther it
[1:41:17] man him with the promise of that hour
[1:41:18] when he fell upon Wesley it manifests
[1:41:20] the promise of that hour when he fell in
[1:41:22] this day it reminded of the promise of
[1:41:23] the hour whenever Moses it manifests the
[1:41:26] promise of the Allah it's the Holy
[1:41:28] Spirit coming out to Quicken and make
[1:41:30] our life those he will fordained of God
[1:41:33] to be in the rapture
[1:41:35] Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my
[1:41:40] God my God we find out in each age when
[1:41:43] God said a certain thing would happen
[1:41:45] here come that man along and manifested
[1:41:48] that that is William Branham and then
[1:41:50] here come the people along and live that
[1:41:52] that was God himself living in the
[1:41:54] people because it was an answering of
[1:41:57] his word now God only provided we only
[1:42:00] provided wait a day is his son through
[1:42:03] his word for his age quickened by the
[1:42:05] spirit of Life praise him praise him in
[1:42:08] the Lord he said that's what the matter
[1:42:09] is just today we are full of theology
[1:42:10] without any Dynamics in it in other
[1:42:12] words we have got to have the spark to
[1:42:15] the gasoline or the gasoline is no more
[1:42:17] it could be water no matter how well we
[1:42:19] are taught all his great teachers teach
[1:42:21] us get the Precision place you and the
[1:42:23] teaching teaching teaching teaching
[1:42:24] teaching Mighty management teachers
[1:42:27] no matter what we are taught however we
[1:42:30] believe how much the Bible we say which
[1:42:32] is true we believe it's true it's got to
[1:42:35] be the Dynamics that's got to be there
[1:42:38] the spark to set up with a fire and they
[1:42:41] started rolling we've got to have that
[1:42:43] if you don't the church sits still the
[1:42:46] car sits still you sit still but no
[1:42:48] matter how much you say I sympathize I
[1:42:50] believe every word you've got to have
[1:42:51] something to spark that off to make that
[1:42:54] 100 octane gold of iron and the Big
[1:42:56] Church of God go to moving on it's got
[1:42:58] to take the Dynamics with the mechanics
[1:43:00] nothing wrong with the mechanics but
[1:43:02] lucky Dynamics and I think that is what
[1:43:04] the matter with the church today we are
[1:43:06] lacking begin to play something we are
[1:43:07] lacking that dynamical power to press
[1:43:11] this word and make it live for this day
[1:43:14] Martin Luther had a mechanism dynamics
[1:43:16] of his day John Wesley had them of
[1:43:19] History what about our day this is
[1:43:21] another time the church should be fully
[1:43:23] grown now ready to go and meet Christ
[1:43:25] with the manifestation of Every Blessing
[1:43:28] he promised in the Bible where we are we
[1:43:31] are ready for that
