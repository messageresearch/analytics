[13:20] in
[13:22] 2024 and tomorrow we have our last uh
[13:26] sort of service or seminar uh things
[13:29] pertain to life and godliness and we
[13:31] have it like a a financial breakthrough
[13:33] and if you have challenges with your
[13:36] finances and especially how all these
[13:38] Merchants just waiting to collect this
[13:40] Christmas season there because there the
[13:42] anointing that has come down Christmas
[13:43] time to shop the spend and to buy and so
[13:46] on and if you know I want to challenge
[13:49] you don't let it be business as
[13:51] usual uh take a time out and pause and
[13:55] rethink what you do how you do how you
[13:58] spend
[14:00] what you spent on and why and um you
[14:03] know I'm trying to challenge people to
[14:06] think it is not business as usual forget
[14:11] this SK forget how things looking
[14:14] outside things are taking uh place in
[14:17] the spirit realm that is beyond what you
[14:20] could and I could imagine but it's
[14:22] Warfare that is going on right now so
[14:24] tonight I have something special to
[14:25] share with you I hope you are excited
[14:28] like how I am
[14:30] uh but I like you to go to your Bibles
[14:33] and we want to speak from Luke chapter 6
[14:36] a couple of verses there from 27 and we
[14:39] will hear what Jesus have to say from
[14:42] Luke chapter 6 we want to read from
[14:43] verse 27 Luke chapter 6 verse 27 but I
[14:47] sayto you which hear love your enemies
[14:50] so this is Christianity in action here
[14:53] love your enemies do good to them which
[14:54] hate you bless them that curse you pray
[14:57] for them which despitefully use you unto
[14:59] him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek
[15:01] offer him also the other him that taketh
[15:04] away thy cloak forbid him not to take
[15:05] thy quat also give to every man that ask
[15:08] it of thee of him that taketh away thy
[15:11] Goods ask them not again and as he would
[15:13] that men would do to you do you do also
[15:16] to them likewise if you love them which
[15:19] love you what thank have ye for Sinners
[15:22] also love those who love them and if you
[15:24] do good to them which do good to you
[15:27] what than have ye for Sinners also do
[15:29] even the same and if he lend to them of
[15:32] whom he hope to receive what T have you
[15:34] for Sinners also lend to Sinners to
[15:36] receive as much again but love ye your
[15:39] enemies and do good lend hoping for
[15:41] nothing again and your reward shall be
[15:43] great and he shall be the CH of the
[15:45] highest for he is kind unto the
[15:48] unthankful andto the evil be therefore
[15:50] merciful as your father also is
[15:52] merciful judge not and he shall not be
[15:56] judged condemn not he shall not be
[15:59] condemned forgive and he shall be
[16:00] forgiven give and it shall be given unto
[16:03] you good measure press down shaken
[16:07] together and running over shall men give
[16:10] into your bosom for with the same
[16:12] measure that you meet with it shall be
[16:14] measure to you again and he spake a
[16:17] parable unto them can the blind lead the
[16:20] blind shall they not both fall into the
[16:23] ditch verse 14 the disciple is not above
[16:26] his master interesting praise afterwards
[16:30] but everyone that is perfect shall be as
[16:32] his master this is the part I want to
[16:35] get down to verse 41 why beholdest thou
[16:37] the moat that is in thy brother's eye
[16:40] but perceivest not the beam that is in
[16:43] th own eye either how can thou say to
[16:46] thy brother brother let me pull out the
[16:48] mo that is in thine eye when thou
[16:50] thyself beholdest not the beam that is
[16:53] in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out
[16:57] first The Beam of out of thine own eye
[17:00] and then Thou shalt See Clearly to pull
[17:03] out the moat that is in thy brother's
[17:05] eye for a good tree bringeth forth not
[17:08] corrupt fruit neither that a corrupt
[17:10] tree bringeth forth good fruit for every
[17:13] tree is known by his own fruit may God
[17:17] bless his word so we have something here
[17:20] tonight I have a little title for it are
[17:23] you seeing clearly are you seeing
[17:25] clearly all right
[17:27] let's brother Brown
[17:30] he was reading the scripture as many as
[17:32] I love I rebuke and Chason be zealous
[17:35] therefore and repent and brother was
[17:37] saying here this is the same message
[17:40] that John had cried out repent there is
[17:44] no other cause there's no other course
[17:46] now there's no other way get back to God
[17:49] there's no other way now it is repent
[17:52] listen to these words change your mind
[17:56] turn around repent for while will you
[18:00] die so some people mind in a frozen
[18:03] Condition it's fixed it's stubborn it's
[18:05] bullheaded it is just how it is but
[18:09] repentance means to change change your
[18:10] mind now listen to this I know we said
[18:13] it before but I want you to hear it
[18:14] again tonight there's a reason why I'm
[18:16] going here let us examine the first
[18:18] phrase as many as I love in the Greek
[18:21] the emphasis is upon the personal PR I
[18:24] he does not say as many would feel he
[18:26] should say as many as love me no sir we
[18:29] must never try to make Jesus the object
[18:31] of human love in this verse no it is the
[18:34] many that are the loved ones of God it
[18:37] is his love in question not ours so once
[18:40] again we find ourselves gloring in
[18:42] Salvation his purpose his plan we are
[18:45] confirmed even more strongly in the
[18:47] truth of the doctrine of the
[18:49] sovereignity of God even as he said in
[18:51] Romans 9:13 Jacob have I loved does it
[18:54] now obtain that since he loved only the
[18:57] many is he therefore in a state of
[18:59] complacency awaiting the love of those
[19:01] who have not drawn n to him by no means
[19:04] is this so for he declared in Romans 93
[19:07] Esau have I hated and in verse 11 the
[19:10] spirit boldly calls out for the children
[19:13] not being born neither having done good
[19:16] or evil that the purpose of God
[19:19] according to the election might stand
[19:21] not of works but of him that call it
[19:24] this love is elective love it is his
[19:27] love for his elect
[19:29] and his love for them is apart from
[19:31] Human Merit okay glory to God this is
[19:34] this is enough to run out your chair
[19:35] right now he say his love for them is
[19:39] apart from Human Merit this is his love
[19:44] we talking about for it says that the
[19:46] purpose of God stands in election which
[19:49] is exactly opposite to works or anything
[19:53] man has in himself so because before the
[19:57] children were born you already said
[19:59] Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated now
[20:03] let's drill long now to us now now he
[20:06] says to his own as many as I love I
[20:10] rebuke and
[20:12] chasen this is the part here now to
[20:15] rebuke is to
[20:17] reprove to reprove is to expose with a
[20:21] view of Correction so it is not exposing
[20:24] for exposing sake he's not rebuking his
[20:26] children for just rebuke sake he's not
[20:29] correcting them just for correction sake
[20:31] no he's he's rebuking them because he
[20:34] says chasing doesn't mean to punish it
[20:36] means to discipline because the subject
[20:40] amendment is in mind just as we could
[20:43] discipline our children because we want
[20:45] them to stay right now this
[20:48] amendment in
[20:50] Behavior relates to a deliberate change
[20:54] or Improvement in someone's action
[20:58] habits
[20:59] attitudes so when he says discipline
[21:03] because he have the subject amendment in
[21:06] mind he means he is looking to see
[21:11] change in this subject talking about us
[21:14] now change in our actions in our habits
[21:18] in our attitudes it implies that the
[21:22] person has recognized the need for
[21:25] growth or correction and making an
[21:28] effort to get their behavior lined up to
[21:31] better standards values and expectations
[21:35] change so I don't want you to hear this
[21:37] tonight just as words pelting out
[21:39] because I have some examples here like
[21:41] someone want to improve their
[21:43] communication style some of us we have a
[21:46] certain way we speak and we have been
[21:48] speaking that way for years but we could
[21:50] shift it we could change it from being
[21:53] critical to being more encouraging
[21:55] everybody know like like a little critic
[21:58] everything you to criticize you to
[21:59] criticize you criticize but where's the
[22:01] encouragement or like if somebody is
[22:04] working and they missing deadlines that
[22:06] they could adjust better time management
[22:09] that they wouldn't be complaining you
[22:11] miss the deadline you miss the deadline
[22:12] you miss the deadline so everybody in
[22:14] every area have to adjust a manager who
[22:17] give vague instructions and have to
[22:20] learn how to communicate clearly to give
[22:23] specific guidance to a team or a person
[22:26] that recognize they lack generosity the
[22:28] the people mean and stingy they give no
[22:30] one they help no one they serve no one
[22:32] they are for themselves and the
[22:33] themselves
[22:34] only then they if they recognize that
[22:37] they need to be more generous that would
[22:39] need an adjustment a wife or husband who
[22:42] always interrupting when they have
[22:44] communicating always a spouse any one of
[22:47] them and they could adjust to say you
[22:50] know what I would listen respectfully I
[22:52] would listen again I don't have to
[22:53] interrupt and but and say listen or
[22:57] student who missing the homework and and
[23:01] slacking their work but say you know
[23:02] what I'm going to adjust I'm going to
[23:04] take time off to study I'm going to get
[23:05] off a games I'm going to apply myself
[23:07] because I want to get my exam or spender
[23:10] coming as Christmas time here who always
[23:13] over over the budget they don't even
[23:15] know what the expenses are so they're
[23:16] spending
[23:18] freely and they crashing their finances
[23:21] freely because they don't want to adjust
[23:23] and sit down and think through or parent
[23:26] who
[23:28] with their children in a strict manner
[23:29] without re listening to what a child is
[23:31] going through and how to deal the manner
[23:33] with a child so let's go to the story
[23:35] that Jesus G here and the story Jesus
[23:38] give here is which one of you having a
[23:42] mo seeing a moot in your brother eye and
[23:45] then you have a beam in your eye now a
[23:47] mo is a speck or a splinter or a chip of
[23:51] wood it's interesting because both the
[23:54] moat and the beam is of the same
[23:56] material one happen to be very small
[23:58] more tiny and one happen to be a beam a
[24:01] big piece of wood and Jesus used this
[24:05] word in this Parable to deal with the
[24:09] self-righteous people who look for
[24:12] specks of dust in the eyes of others
[24:16] while ignoring planks lugs or beams of
[24:20] wood in their own eyes and refer to them
[24:23] as Hypocrites this is church folks right
[24:26] we not talking about people outside
[24:28] you're referring to the hypocrisy of
[24:30] people who try to improve others while
[24:35] remaining blind to their own
[24:37] faults this word MO is a aric English
[24:41] word referring to small particles or
[24:45] spec and when Jesus used it is an
[24:49] example to contrast a slight moral fault
[24:52] one may enjoy pointing out in others
[24:54] while neglecting one's own heinous fault
[24:57] represent by the log plank beam in one
[25:02] eye that is why we ask are you seeing
[25:07] clearly a
[25:09] log how Jesus call it a
[25:12] beam and the way he say a beam is like a
[25:15] big blockage and a big that beam will
[25:18] distort one's
[25:21] vision and to see this small moat in
[25:24] somebody's eye and having this big beam
[25:27] it means that you can't see right you're
[25:28] not seeing
[25:29] right Our obligation is to put out our
[25:34] lives those glaring
[25:37] fors that prevents us from properly
[25:41] appraising the character of
[25:44] another before we seek to deal with tiny
[25:47] fults of
[25:50] someone the person with the l in his eye
[25:54] who attempts to deal with the tiny force
[25:56] of another
[25:58] Jesus called them a
[26:00] hypocrite a
[26:02] hypocrite and this is what we have to
[26:04] get away from I won't beong with you
[26:07] tonight but the thing about it and what
[26:10] I love is the object is not just to say
[26:15] look you have a mo no the object is how
[26:19] do I help that brother because Jesus was
[26:22] trying to bring a point that we need
[26:24] some level of self-reflection some level
[26:27] of how to say it when you begin to
[26:31] examine you examine
[26:34] yourself that you could realize the
[26:36] obstruction of your faults sins failures
[26:39] whatever you have affects you from
[26:42] seeing clearly to help
[26:46] another you ever get something small in
[26:48] your eye and it but in you a little
[26:52] tiny with or something whether it's a
[26:54] piece of cloth or piece of tread or
[26:56] something of dust and you keep rubbing
[26:58] eye is miserable it is harassing it is
[27:01] terrible it's not a big thing but it's
[27:04] an irritant in your eye and they keep
[27:06] rubbing sometime you get eye gets red
[27:09] and you warn Somebody Sometime you pull
[27:10] your eye up and they say blow it blow it
[27:13] that happen to me already and somebody
[27:16] and it blowing this little spot out your
[27:17] Idols whatever it
[27:19] is so therefore this introspection I
[27:23] could use the word or
[27:26] self uh you know self you know you're
[27:30] looking at yourself then helps you to be
[27:34] able to clear up the stuff around you
[27:37] that you could effectively and clearly
[27:40] see how you could help your
[27:44] brother with the beam in thine eye
[27:47] you're staring at your brother's little
[27:49] failure pulling out the beam that you
[27:52] can see clearly not only the fault but
[27:56] how to get your brother to get rid of it
[27:59] that is the ultimate goal is not and you
[28:02] see this is what happened to people
[28:03] people just mounting the self making
[28:06] acquisition put talking on fors
[28:08] condemning this one judging this one
[28:11] criticizing this one criticizing this
[28:13] one with no help in mind the object is
[28:16] to criticize and then when you go and
[28:17] talk it with somebody else you're adding
[28:20] you know layer on top of Labor of fault
[28:22] finding criticizing judging and you're
[28:25] adding like a spirit atmosphere towards
[28:27] a particular person but listen to the
[28:29] same scripture in Matthew chapter 7 you
[28:32] don't have to find it Jesus was saying
[28:34] it judge not that he may not be judged
[28:36] for with what judgment you judge you
[28:38] shall be judged and with what measure
[28:39] you met it shall be measured to you
[28:41] again for why beholdest thou the mo that
[28:44] is in thy brother's eye but considerest
[28:46] not the beam in thine own eye how will
[28:49] thou say to thy brother let me pull out
[28:51] the moood out of th eye and behold a
[28:53] beam is in th own eye th hypocrite first
[28:56] here we go cast out the beam out of th
[28:59] own eye get it out whatever it is that
[29:02] beam could
[29:04] be that Pride that beam could be
[29:08] jealousy that beam could be mean
[29:10] meanness that beam could be greedy that
[29:12] you could put that Beam for whatever it
[29:13] is but he said get that out it then thou
[29:17] sht See Clearly the cast out the mo out
[29:21] of thy brother's eye so this to cast out
[29:25] the Lord's word assume the object of SC
[29:28] is not only or mainly
[29:30] detection but
[29:32] correction so you're not trying just to
[29:34] detect or see somebody's faults or
[29:37] somebody failures or somebody
[29:39] shortcomings but you want to be able to
[29:41] help correct so therefore you have to
[29:43] see
[29:45] clearly God help us tonight and he
[29:48] Amplified and I want to
[29:51] close you know it talk about a student
[29:55] is not above his master here this a
[29:58] pupil is not Superior to his
[30:02] teacher but everyone when he is
[30:05] completely
[30:07] trained
[30:08] readjusted restored sets to rights and
[30:12] perfected will be as his teacher this is
[30:15] beautiful will be as their lord when you
[30:18] come into that
[30:20] maturity why do you see the spec that's
[30:22] in your brother's eye do not notice and
[30:25] consider the beam or Timber that is in
[30:27] your own eye how can you say to your
[30:30] brother brother allow me to take out the
[30:32] speck that is in your eye when you
[30:35] yourself do not see the beam that is in
[30:37] your own eye you actor Pretender
[30:40] hypocrite first take the beam out of
[30:43] your own eye and then and then you shall
[30:47] see clearly to take out the spec that in
[30:50] your brother's eye for there is no good
[30:52] healthy tree that bears decayed
[30:54] worthless stale fruit nor the other hand
[30:57] does decayed w stickly tree bear good
[30:59] fruit for each tree is known and
[31:02] identified by its own fruit let's let's
[31:05] recap as we close a moat a small Speck
[31:08] of Splinter a beam a large piece of
[31:13] wood Jesus was
[31:16] identifying
[31:18] self-reflection and encouraging us as
[31:21] individuals to address our own
[31:24] shortcomings before criticizing
[31:26] other he is making us aware or making us
[31:30] to become
[31:32] self-aware of our of of our own self and
[31:36] so before confronting someone about your
[31:39] mistakes take time for honest
[31:43] self-reflection are there areas in your
[31:45] life where you struggle with similar
[31:47] issues and attitudes so the question
[31:49] tonight is are you seeing clearly almost
[31:51] done removing the beam before helping
[31:55] others
[31:56] mood emphas ize the importance of
[31:59] introspection or
[32:02] self-reflection if you are in a position
[32:05] as a parent as a
[32:07] leader we have to make sure as leaders
[32:10] and that's the position we are in that
[32:13] we our life is reflecting the principles
[32:15] that we are pressing others to to stand
[32:17] up to
[32:18] them so that we become authentic and
[32:22] original where we we we live our word
[32:27] our word is true true to us and
[32:29] therefore we say it is true to us we
[32:31] demand it of ourselves first then we can
[32:33] demand it out of you so this clear this
[32:36] see this beam is not just to take the
[32:39] beam out it's for you to see clearly for
[32:41] I to see clearly that we could properly
[32:44] help our Brethren so Jesus is saying
[32:47] before you could really help somebody
[32:50] effectively with their
[32:52] stuff get your stuff in
[32:55] order he didn't say ignore
[32:59] what in the person's
[33:00] eye he did not say that don't bother
[33:04] with that no you see it you know it is
[33:08] something there but you want to get that
[33:11] person helped you want to connect with
[33:13] that person that they could get their
[33:15] breakthrough and deliverance you see
[33:17] that mod you want to help them but you
[33:19] have to check yourself and make sure
[33:22] that you are seeing clearly so Jesus is
[33:25] insisting that we have a Clear Vision
[33:29] before helping others and what we call
[33:32] constructive you know some people there
[33:34] criticize well is only constructive
[33:36] criticism but they want to destroy you
[33:37] you know they hitting your hard they
[33:39] coming down at you and they call it
[33:41] constructive criticism behind their
[33:44] bitterness and the anger and so on but
[33:47] Galatians 6 tells us Brethren if a man
[33:52] be overtaken in a fault ye which are
[33:55] spiritual restore such a one
[33:58] in the spirit of meekness considering
[34:01] thyself least thou also be tempted so
[34:04] the Bible is also saying when you see
[34:08] somebody with a fault look at the
[34:10] approach we have to have in getting that
[34:13] person back on track in the Amplified it
[34:16] says Brethren if any person is overtaken
[34:18] in a misconduct or sin or of any sort
[34:21] You Are Spiritual who are responsive to
[34:24] and controlled by the spirit should set
[34:27] him right and restore and reinstate him
[34:30] without any sense of superiority with
[34:33] all gentleness keeping an attentive eye
[34:36] on
[34:37] yourself least you should be tempted
[34:42] also so
[34:46] Saints this is what his PRM is about
[34:49] tonight addressing
[34:52] self-reflection addressing any beam that
[34:55] may affect us from seeing l
[34:58] Street thingss I could identify
[35:01] here he says Jesus talk about the
[35:05] hypocrite so he was saying you have to
[35:07] cleanse your own life before you can
[35:09] help
[35:11] others then he reference this cast The
[35:15] Beam out of thine own eye which is a
[35:17] type of pgeon get rid of stuff TR it out
[35:22] and then you shall see clearly to cast
[35:26] out the moat out of thy brother's eye so
[35:30] we cannot we cannot live hypocritically
[35:33] and able to help others spiritually
[35:35] let's go Heavenly Father these few words
[35:38] I pray that you would write them in the
[35:41] people's heart a time of self
[35:44] introspection a type of self-awareness a
[35:46] type of Consciousness that how we are
[35:49] doing it's so easy to talk about others
[35:53] we talk less about our own selves it's
[35:56] so easy to see others fall fults and
[35:58] failure and we turn a blind eye to what
[36:01] we see in us but this word Lord this
[36:04] word of Truth this word of righteousness
[36:07] these Parables that Jesus brought have
[36:11] so much depth and Revelation and
[36:13] inspiration in it it BR brings Clarity
[36:16] to how life supposed to be and the
[36:19] purpose you put us on Earth bless the
[36:21] people tonight as we wait upon you in
[36:23] Jesus name I ask it amen
[36:26] amen I
[36:28] before we go into actual prayer I want
[36:32] to play something for you tonight want
[36:35] to share some you tonight a tee that I
[36:38] have here and um let's see if I can get
[36:42] it praise the
[36:46] Lord
[36:48] yes I want to
[36:51] share and then we get on into
[36:56] prayer for
[37:35] their native song of farewell Jay Edwin
[37:38] was so moved he quickly scribbled some
[37:39] verses on the back of an envelope and
