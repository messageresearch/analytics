blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight on this special Wednesday night service you know God is a God of suddenly you read the Bible it says suddenly he was there suddenly something happens and whenever a suddenly happens is God's way of breaking the routine breaking the order of things and I believe that tonight is a break in the routine we're not normally here on a Wednesday night so the devil doesn't know what's going on he had no idea we were gonna be here tonight and we are gonna sing we're gonna shout you gonna worship so we're gonna keep the devil confused tonight we're gonna keep him confused because we're gonna smile we might be tired but we still gonna worship we might be weary but that's all right we know where we come from and we know where we're going can the church say Amen Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I greet you tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ and if you have your Bibles would you tinted me too but three portions of Scripture not going to be too long with you tonight but we want to read from the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation and brother Branham said that there are two books in the Bible at the devil heats which are the books of Genesis and the book of Revelation so we want to stay right where we give the devil problems because if we don't give them problems we create a room for him to give us problems so we have him on the ropes tonight and we want to keep him on the ropes tonight so Genesis chapter 6 and reading from verse 5 and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repented me that I have made them but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord I'm reading Genesis 7 the next chapter reading from verse 1 and the Lord said unto Noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation I'm going down to visit the team in the self-same day entered Noah and Shem and ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark vien every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird after every sort and they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life and he that went in went in male and female of all flesh as God had commanded him and the Lord shut him in an hour last reading from the book of Revelation chapter 3 and with it revelation 3 and verse 8 for I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and ice kept my word and has not denied my name can we bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace for your love tonight and law we are breaking our routine Lord and the hustle and the bustle of life and father we thank you for the blessed privilege Lord to come here tonight by whatever means we came tonight we thank you to be here Lord after your love and your mercy has kept us alive father to worship you and to serve you lord I pray you touch our bodies such our minds our hearts Lord and give us a charge from our theophanies tonight Lord for the next few minutes that we could dash into the heavenlies Lord and we could leave tonight better Christians leave tonight better sons better daughters we can leave tonight a little more like you father me you bless Lord everyone that's here me you bless those that would hear the tape maybe there's anyone still on their way may you grant them safe journey Lord we pray a special blessing on our pasta tonight Lord and Lord and the fields their organda father may the Holy Ghost long me you touch them and the convention over they and me you bring him back Lord safely and in strength to us father may you bless the services this coming Sunday and may you be with your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen you may be seated tonight so for a short title for this exhortation tonight the open door of deliverance the open door of deliverance and we read the scripture that God was looking at the urgent he realized that man had fallen from his position man had fallen out of order if God had a vision of what he wanted to see when he was looking at man it was it was not what he had wanted to see was not his desire and brother Brandon brought out that is not God desire that anyone would be lost see he doesn't look when somebody Falls and say it's good for you that's not his desire is not his attribute that you make mistakes is not his nature that he you wants you to be in trouble and as God looked he had seen that man was out of position husbands out of their position wives out of their position fathers out of their position mothers out of their position believers so to speak out of their position every imagination the Bible says was evil could you imagine every imagination every time their mind goes somewhere is evil every thought they had was evil the way their mind worked it just was evil the conclusions they came up with was evil the ideas they had was evil the dreams they had was evil he said every imagination it was not a minority it was not once in our aisle but when God looked at everything every imagination was evil but yet in the midst of all of that in the midst of that God for one man who found grace in the eyes of the Lord and his name was Noah and I could imagine as God looks at the world right now you see into every imagination evil young people evil you see on the news it's fight it's murder it's this is bad and I could imagine God shakes his head but I believe that there's some people who have found grace in the eyes of the Lord the Bible says if repented God that he made man in other words God almost regrets it even me man because what he made man to do man was not to him he had created man to worship but man was not worship him he had created man to have dominion but man was not having dominion he had created man to be happy but man was not happy he had created man to be sons of God but they were not acting like sons of korah there every imagination was taking them away from God so God said you know what I'm gonna destroy this time I'm gonna destroy man because this is not what I created them for but God who is rich in grace and mercy whenever he finds somebody who finds grace and insight he could never destroy the righteous of with a wick hit him that's why when he spoke to Abraham he say Abraham I can't hide from you what I'm about to do but what's happening in Sodom and Gomorrah has disturbed me so I've come down to take care of business up but Abraham was such a soldier he started to negotiate with God is there somebody tonight who answer negotiate with God God had made up his mind I'm gonna wipe out Sodom and Gomorrah but Abraham save oh wait a minute Lord with one minute if there are 50 what you wipe it out he said no not 4:15 Abraham when he plays it there 40 he said no I'm gonna spit I can't do it in receivers 30 Abraham push and he pushes a lot of his 10 and when God investigated he sent the angels to investigator he couldn't even find him he's from Locke and his family and he had to bring them out of because God can never destroy the righteous with the wicked if god has to send angels to pull you out of wherever you are he is clutch sirtuins up because that's what makes him god up he is obligated to defend his name he is obligated you may be seated the message last Sunday but the dealer was speaking and he said when man fell yes man lost a lot but he said God had a lot more at stake because God wanted fellowship God wanted a family God had made an investment and when God looked at it he saw his investment going down the drain he said I can't lose all of this investment I can't lose all of this investment up I can't lose all the attributes that I poured into this man called Adam I'm not giving up that easy I spent time to make him I spent time to phone him I spend time to call him I put his name on the book a lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before Adam was even there I'm not about to lose this investment and God has made an investment up in you yes for you that blood price that was paid on Calvary God is not gonna lose his investment he is not gonna waste his investment he has paid for you because he saw you valuable he paid for you because there's something in you that's gonna come forth gonna be manifested gonna be made visible the world may not see it yet what is there you may not see it yet but it's there you leave a minute see it but it's there your boss may not see it but it's there there's a seed in your soul and the devil is mad but I'm so glad [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah you may be seated so I want you to understand no I didn't even know what was going on Noah was living his life just pleasing God he wasn't doing it to impress God you know he was doing it because it was his attribute to find Shiva in the eyes of God he wasn't thinking you know I think I couldn't judge the world this is why I behaving like that do we know as acting was normal living for him his normal behavior got caused attention he didn't know he was being observed he didn't know he was being monitored he didn't know an examination was going on but Noah's passing the exam with flying colors his life his character his behavior his attitude godless him that man I can't let that Monday not that--some not that boy not that son I don't know what the Bible says all these men we preach about were men of like passion meaning they were just like you and me but they defy the odds they were just like you and me but when the other was against them though he slay me yet still I'll trust him job was just like you and me but when he said toe the skin once I destroy my body he was sick but the odds were against him but he didn't give up he didn't backslide he didn't go back to the world he got worried he got tired but something kept going something kept him alive and that's why we are here tonight something has kept us alive when all hell is against you because hell could never stop you can the church seaman somebody give her a shot of praise hallelujah listen the devil has tried for thousands of years to stop God and up to know he can do it [Applause] every time he tried to cut this one off and cut this one off and cut this one off and the biggest mistake he made his when he killed Jesus because Abraham was trouble nor was trouble Jonah was trouble Joe was trouble everybody was troubling you all right when Shauna was supposed to go this way and Jonah went that way the devil was like yeah you see I knew you wasn't gonna make it oh let's eat when I backslide Jonah's supposed to be preaching in Nineveh and Jonah see it not me I think any poor towards this way and when Shana heading this way any devil laughing God laughing louder because God know the end of the story you see the devil doesn't know how the story is going to end but God knows the end of the story that's what makes him God he is Alpha and he is Omega he is the beginning he is the ending so don't give up in the middle of your story there's a bigger life going on it's a life of Jubilee it's a laugh of I know they're gonna make him don't wipe the tear from your eyes lift up your shoulders throw your head back yes sickness in the face and say yet in my flesh I shall see God that is my testimony that will be your testimony and the church amen oh and Juna Juna in the wheel joint on the ship rather and the ship began to rock she will not know one time that he is a problem because when you're not in position you know you had a problem your blessing only comes when you are in position so to not feel the board shaky knees looking around and they trying to cast lots to see who it is it's Alisa forget all and I just threw me overboard throw me overboard I went to church on overboard there was a repair the first GPS directed repaired submarine vessel that was ever created all I'm suffering they have no is trying to be imitated course original vessel to transport sons because Jonah had a destination for some people to be delivered and God has a destination for some sons and daughters to be delivered that's why we are in a deliverance service tonight for whatever is cheating you down whatever is binding you whatever is hauling you black for you to break free watch the chains and break free God deliver need to unlock it you have the power to break free you are superhero tonight whatever chain they put you could break free like Samson and chain him he broke free nobody had to help him but when the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and activated what was already in him you don't need something new you already got something you need something more more more can the church amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God can God he made away and a door of deliverance opened up to the people of Nineveh during a vigil and bondage Moses came on a door of deliverance open up to them we heard it Sunday and I think I said it a Sunday before speaking about that man who got the pardon that was written from which we get a pass and a pardon until it's accepted there was a door and was opened to him he chose not to step through that door and not accept a pardon so - in the days of Noah Noah is under the anointing he's inspired God didn't speak to his wife God didn't speak to his children God and speak to his neighbors God spoke to Noah's here Noah I'm gonna judge the earth build an ark and Noah went into action and defy the odds because what he was preaching had never happened that's a difficult message to preach it's easier to preach now because we are speaking of what has happened and is going to repeat and bring back the old days and back to Pentecost that's easy to preach no had it hard it will rain and rain had never fallen before there was no reference point for Noah we have many references David John job Jonah Elijah all examples to get inspiration where did Noah get his inspiration from it's rain but it was caught said soon a revelation in his soul that captain building building against the odds bring more go forward bring the table bring the animals bring everything and he was building and a door was open that anybody could have walked in that door was not exclusively for Noah and for Noah's family Noah's preaching was to get the attention of the public to come into that door Noah small ministry was about that door because once you cross the threshold of the door you were in the Ark of safety his horror gospel was come into the Ark of safety come into this door of deliverance if you are outside at all you're not gonna make it but if you step into the door you're gonna be all right and you step through the door you're gonna be safe if you step through the door you're gonna eat him plenty and be satisfied because a storm is coming up a flood is coming judgment is coming and Noah preached year-after-year service after service he had to preacher his children he had to preach to his wife he had to preach his friends he was a man of light passion I'm sure he had neighbors I'm sorry of people that knew all grew up with their people who used to call him no no what you doing come hang out this evening with us no see I'm building because the rain is coming what rain is talking about know what is rain laughing and mocking and Noah had to keep on going when nobody else understood it's one thing if you're in a group and the group has a understanding and revelation and you're doing it together but Noah had no help because he was the only one with a revelation his wife didn't have the revelation his children have the revelation he was the only one and he was standing in the gap for his wife standing in the gap for his children so don't think you come in to services and accidental by chance you are standing in the gap for your house you are standing in the gap for your family they may not be here tonight but you are the key to unlock in their future you are the key to unlocking them because the Jesus I will be failing you will be the Jesus that they will see there are people who are not predestinated to read the books and the tapes but when they see you they see the books and the tapes because you are written in missiles read unknown of men you made me see that I'm not gonna be too long with you just to shake you a little bit Noah had the hardest message to ever preach no one preached and nobody will come to the altar Noah preached for the class and nobody would repent Noah had no fruits of his ministry beyond this family think about it could you imagine your ministry is over a hundred years and there's not one convert because things were so bad the Bible says every imagination was evil the minds of the people had been grown accustomed to being not about God and the things of God the devil at consuming like this dear that will consume the people minds with the styles and the fashions and the cares of life and being so PC your every imagination is being influenced by another and that influence is one of evil what is your influence tonight but there is hope there is a door there is a door of deliverance we read the scripture in the book of Revelation 3 and verse in the hall I set before you an open door no man open this door no man can shut this door and whether Branham brought out that after Luther and Wesley there was no messenger to the Pentecostal age Christ himself dropped down and open the door that door was the tour of the Holy Ghost no man had opened it and no man has the power to close it and that door has remained open so whoever wants to step into the Holy Ghost but the random said Christ is the door the church is not the door but the Holy Ghost is the door and you could just step through the door tonight just as people have the opportunity to step to the door in the days of Noah what will you do tonight will you stay outside or will you come inside I challenge you to come inside tonight can the church say man for the Branum said very ejected not Noah but they rejected Jesus Christ in North that's who they rejected he didn't reject MOA because but the Brennan said it was Christ in Noah but then I said they rejected the Word of God for that each can the church same Noah is Dan the Ark and the Bible says God shut him in he didn't closed the door he didn't lock anybody off it was God had shot him him in and when that door was shot the opportunity for salvation had passed the day of grace had transitioned into a day of judgment the world didn't realized that for all the years Noah was preaching the judgment the plagues of flood was being held back until Noah could be sealed into Christ until he could be in position before God could shut the door no one had to be in his place and before God could shut the door Noah has to be in his place Noah this type of this bride who finds favor in God's eyes has to be in her place what place are you in tonight because the Bible said that comes a day when he who is righteous is righteous still he us filty is filty still you know there are some people when they want to buy something buy a fridge buy a stove buy a car let us take that time and check things check it out good now because you don't to take any chances and it's amazing how people depending on the value of what they want to get they will spend more time investigating to not take chances chances about something that is temporary because no matter how you're investigated car the use guy 1x2 check the engine to check the spark plugs if they sell of that whatever else they have known one day that car will not be able to start one in a car will not be able to go anywhere but it's an age of man to check it out in the natural it amazes me how in the spiritual people want to gamble with their souls and take a chance take a chance by not weighing your decisions not weighing what you're doing and service after service will come and the door is preached every service the doors breach and people choose to wonder if you know but the Branham said when he was ministering to the audiences and the Holy Ghost would be there and he would be on the discernment and people would come to him and he'd say your name is so-and-so and you lived in so-and-so and then the in Zola would pull him over there and pull him over there and he said there would be people who were to be healed that he would say it's over there and he said they did not respond fast enough and the angel left and they missed it could you imagine it's one thing to not know you miss it that's one thing it's one thing if you miss work one day and they were having our checks for 10,000 others and nobody tell you it helped you wouldn't feel a certain way about it but if the next day you come you recognize a if I was here I would have gotten it then you live with this regret friends this journey of Christianity is a journey of choice and decision that could lead to regrets that you have the opportunity tonight to avoid those regrets I can imagine Noah's children because no one's children had not also they had not heard from God but they Brandon painted a picture that Noah had to slam the door the window on Noah's children have because they wanted to go outside they wanted willing participants they didn't say I already want to be in the ark you know daddy already wants to come tonight to be in New York what time you will that was my deposition but Noah's love for them had almost forced them into the Ark and I tell young people all the time try to decision what the parents trying to do them as human beings we always have differences you may not have to agree with everything but you have to respect and listen what is the motive and objective is it to bring you closer to God but he's gonna get you away from good you have to discern the motive and the objective but I wanna know what happened when the door is shut and Noah's children here and their friends on the outside because they would have all heard of Noah preached commented here cometh in the Ark and I can imagine all those know what sure and being so grateful that daddy had said a or you better get in or else by whatever means necessary to get them in because he knew what was going to happen it would not have been easy for those children to see their friends one by one the flood take them right now in the u.s. there's a hurricane that has been the worst in years lives lost hoses devastated property come true I know the Bible said there be Wars rumors of wars different diverse places all kind of and he said he said and you know what the any don't even yet there's more coming on but you know what that's not your fear look up your Redemption draweth man because what has happened to the earth has to happen legally earth is preparing to be cleansed for real owners to take their place the mountain no the real owners are the trees nobody real owners up we have been hiding for too long as the real owners of this because the Bible says we shall reign on it the earth is waiting for the kings the sons of God to walk on the earth but before God were allowed to walk he was the cleanses you were to make sure things and please but the Branham said the reason his sickness and sin he said Satan is the Prince of the power the air he said demons in the atmosphere he said it will take fire to destroy them and when the fire comes it it opens up the whole thing for the whole of creation to transform because some sons of God are coming back into position to walk on streets of gold and to take leaves from the tree see the nation's and that's your inheritance eternal life is your inheritance joy unspeakable is your inheritance people fighting again gold bracelet and gold Sheen and you have streets ago you have someone to leave and even want to pick it up drink from the everlasting fountain can the church seamen never grow all never feel sick never feel back in never feel the press have no pills to pee if somebody gives you a job offer say hear what I have a job for you to do but with this job you have certain books you will never get sick you don't need sick leave you don't need health insurance because you will never get sick you don't need four key something you will never get tired you don't need money because a pirating when you want something just speaking it appears you have millions and millions of friends you can talk for years if you want to talk if you like the talking real talk [Applause] [Music] if you want to create you can create you want to be an artist you can be an artist but the random said all that you love and all I love you will be there you can create your own world in a world that's a job offer that I have for you tonight [Applause] anybody interested in trouble no sickness nor depression how long yours in a back way and you don't want to react you want to stay outside the awkward back will stay outside rapid authorizers stay outside the awkward female condition when you step into the arc definition have to go because sin cannot comment area sickness para comment area depression can occur materia frustration Telecom Italia when in the act no weapon formed against you got prosper because the arcus Christ Jesus [Applause] [Music] and the church semen and it'll be that Apple take you straight to your destination oh can we give the Lord a hand of praise hallelujah so there's something with a brand talk about seal they talk about the Boxcar you remember that when you seal it it's just seal it until its destination and it has to be packed a certain way to make sure there is no movement and it's packed right so that when it gets this destination the seal is supposed to tell the man or the other and have nobody tamper with the merchandise what has been delivered is what was packed nothing was allowed to go in and nothing is allowed to come out seal until the day of your redemption seal until your destination no devil could come in and the power you have in you cannot come out seal until the day of your redemption when you are seeing like that you can look sickness in the face and job can do it like this but you can really locks against a yak in my flesh I will seek or because job lived before our day and in our day we have the fullness of the world fullness of the power the fullness of Revelation of fullness of understanding every Michelle's been revealed if job knew what you knew he would have been chosen even Laura that is shouted back then we are so privileged to know what we know we are so honored to see what we see we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth can we give the Lord a shout of praise that's only 50% can we give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah I said to them in Nigeria especially young people when people come to church and they tired a doesn't buy a journal because a DC people passing up to come to church tonight I pass a bar I see were trans and I think I see that there then people at her and Nathan came to my holiday so I am party all night long and watch them is something else my name is spirit or something when it's election time I see people 4 o'clock any morning people who go to bed in the clock - am the up because it wants to know who in because this is the thing people eat p.m. they all call for Christmas night Christmas I forget it go away the harmony of coho I could sleep I'd have how many other because in the spirit of Christmas I think we talked about it pressures but adjourn Philip went on to be with the Lord one Christmas he have not painted and not painting no Pete what Bible transitions no not me boy Christmas Eve it is he paid if you see kids nobody paying so fast because he spirits are easing it hits him and it hit hard and that's what some of us need to get to hit harder I recognize wait a minute I'm getting out of this place I don't know world forever that's not my passion is that would my personal rejoicing and worship and this is a testing ground to prove that I can make it that I'm counted worthy that I've found grace and save up in the eyes of Almighty God can the church same and the musician to get ready I'm almost finished so I challenge you tonight to make the right choice don't just put your foot here our people watch that summer real happy people some time ago I told my dad I say you know sometime people walk in to the church and there's something on the floor and for some people if you see something Friday and party or you'll pick it up so you ask yourself the question why would somebody come into the house of God he's a man front passage street and say there has to be only one answer because in their house they have grown accustomed to pass in suffering wrong so today miss no it's no difference because this half waiting people like Newton have who you know every when I was young I was in the world I was delivered from Edward when amongst a clean up well join I remember one day I clean up little bit kappa damn police up under the covers I see the fastest cleanups ever clean up me room or else covered open and everything going up but you didn't know how it fit if you open that cupboard you wouldn't believe what coming only cover but that is what happens when they doing something halfway and God wants us to go all the way generally the race is not for the Swift but when you indoors until and endurance until the end is not a measure of test of strength it's a measure of test of willpower because you can be tired but still in BO they could be bruised but still endure he could have lost a lot but there's something in you that says you know what I'm gonna in view no one that Joseph can say listen all you leave in here no but when you leave here carry my bones with you take my bones across the finish line don't leave me here in Egypt because I want to be me Promised Land there was something in him that knew that resurrection was coming and if you are
