way and be magnified in omits in jesus might ask it amen god bless you thank you all for coming out tonight if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to matthew chapter 12 wondering from 22 to 32 ephesians chapter 6 reading from 10 to 19. matthew 12 reading from verse 22 then was brought unto him one possessed with the devil blind and dumb and he healed him in so much that the blind and the dumb boat speak and saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow dot not cast out devils but by percy bob the prince of the devils and jesus knew their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan casts out satan he's divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if i by belzebub cast or devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god has come unto you or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he first bind a strong man and when then he will spoil his house he that is not with me is against me he that gathered us with me is color abroad wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man shall be forgiven but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world or neither in the world to come ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to to withstand in the evil day haven't done all to stand stand therefore having your lawyers good about your truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shud with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taken the shield of fate where he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto it all perseverance and supplication of all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel may god bless his word you may be seated all praise be to jesus thank you again for coming out here tonight the advertiser the whole armor of god well that's what we talk about tonight the title is the whole armor of god put it on that's what i have at the title tonight the whole lamb of god put it on an inspiration stand therefore in other words hold your ground stand therefore hold your ground and brother branham uh going to just run it through uh he said paul is speaking here talking about preparing us solely for battle remember you have to prepare for the battle right all right but yeah they get armed you have to get trained for this battle and paul was talking about preparing a soul for battle the gospel you say you can liken into one thing on the other one time in hebrews he spoke about a runner scene we we let us lay aside the weight and the sin only beset us he's speaking of olympics he's speaking of i know he's speaking about ahmed men going into battle and how to prepare themselves and no nation would dare send a man on the battlefield untrained he might not only get himself killed but another group he doesn't know how to take a hold he must be prepared for it and the nations that are wise to that they get their men ready isn't that right praise be to jesus so before we continue i just want to get a prayer from the prophet here and he's praying he's a great god you have never lost your power you never will because you are the infinite god who had no beginning or you will never have an end when the old world has so staggered with sin until it come beyond the stars and if you have sent judgment and destroyed it and there's no more world no moon no stars no solar system you'll still be god when the oceans has become deserts weeping from sin you'll still be god and what is mandatory mindful of him why is it that you so kind to us to send jesus your only begotten son that he should die to save from our sins and then in this closing hours of the world's history when the world is staggering under the impact of sin and hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs in the hands of the heathen and the unbeliever and the ungodly who could destroy the world within seconds we are told by our modern science it's just one minute until midnight oh god wake up men and women anoint your ministers lord like flames of fire making the last call the sign of the last day may it be great and may we see it tonight the living christ isn't his expectation may we see it tonight the living christ who is not dead but has raised again for justification now lives among us in the person of the holy ghost may he come tonight and speak to every heart visible and invisible audience may he perform in their hearts that work of the new birth bring to them redemption power or his resurrection taking away all shadows and doubts and unbelief destroying all skepticism that the church might move on in perfect harmony with the will of god as presented by the bible and the holy spirit take the words that i shall read tonight from the word lord and anoint them in the lips of your servant place them in the hearts of the hearer circumcise the ears and hearts lord that they might receive thy word and then in the end we'll bow our heads in humility towards the dust from which we are taking and give thee praise for we ask in jesus name amen what a prayer now the first script that we read jesus actually said that satan has a kingdom let me read it back for you just in case you missed that one he said every kingdom divided itself against itself is brought to desolation and every city house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how then shall his kingdom stand so satan has a kingdom a structured kingdom not a guest or haphazard it is structured and paul said we rather not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers so the satan have order system and different levels of operation to accomplish his programs and design so without a doubt we are dealing with a formidable foe and we have to have the equipment to deal with this battle and tonight we want to get not the armor of god it was no no what is out of order the whole armor not armor but the whole armor you can fight with us you can fight with a sword and no spear you have no shield you can fight with this and don't have that you want the whole armor somebody ball hole shouted out whole again you want the whole armor of god not part of the old armor of god oh blessed be the name of the lord listen so what are we fighting for if we have to fight we have to fight for something if it's difficult we reach if it's our chairs we reach if it's not deacon and earlier we reach that's what we fighting for if it's to have press play we reach hallelujah if we have spoken books we reach if it's just to have church we reach but that is not what we fighting for that is not what jude exhorted us for judah exhorted the earth he fight for or contend for the fate that was once delivered to the saints something the church had noticed with all these mysteries that peter didn't have and paul didn't have and whoever didn't have we said it'll go back to what they had oh glory to god do you know what i'm saying all the new name all the mysteries seven seas open all what they didn't have the only church we have to still go back to what they had because they had the fate because paul explained though i know all mysteries have all knowledge if i don't have the faith to prolong charity i am nothing oh glory to god so to go forward we have to go backward and pick up the faith that they had that's why gosh is not prophet not for us to have mysteries and revelations and inspirations and knowledge and information but something that will take us back to the faith and pick it up and come forward and stand with that faith and don't give up any groan oh give the lord i shall stand therefore it means you're not giving up any groan every grunge you get don't give up on it don't back down from it because that's what the devil want to do move you backwards but you have to hold your ground hold steady oh hallelujah everything rocking but hold strong hold steady hallelujah we have to earnestly contend for the faith hallelujah for the that was once delivered to the saints not message people but sanctified ones as they would seem for now watch the beginning of the church it was inaugurated at pentecost let's look at what they had back there what that church contended for what they had lost just 33 years after the beginning of the church 32 years just 32 years you know jude wouldn't be talking about back in the old testament under because he was a christian so he was talking about the first church that was set in order he said now notice what kind of faith they had are you ready not not faith the kind the kind of faith they have they had a faith in a resurrected living christ a way to wield these words someone who rose from the dead and was living among them not for a full ministry not pastor teacher prophet evangelist a living christ that way temporary thunders and then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among you watch someone arose from the dead was living among them just the same as he was before he ever died they wasn't contending for some historical affair they wasn't contending for they would come from a living christ a resurrected one who was in their midst so when christ come back amidst the bride then brother branham's prophecy will be fulfilled we don't need to get back brother branham we don't need to come back to open any mystery that doesn't make sense alas is already come what you need is a fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy so when he said i longed to see a church with jesus walking in it so when you see jesus walking in it then we know that's the church the prophet was coming for that's the church rather he wanted to see but that is the church jesus is coming for oh glory to god because you have to pay and then to come isn't that right so watch they were contending for living christ a resurrected one who was in their midst so why raise up a man right glorify number six why put a crown on number six when you're supposed to see this some number seven the living christ why people want a man pour us at a man now when he rose from the dead what he done the same thing he rose from the dead through the apostles what he did the same thing shelter same thing it's the same thing not a new thing the same thing that he was doing through the apostles he was doing the same thing let's go through the apostle he did before he died even greater and more of it so you had a little while the world see it be no more yet he shall see me the church the believer i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world now what was now that was what the apostles believed and they believe that what he was in the flesh he also was more in the spirit so there's jesus walking in galilee here he will the sick raise the dead multiply bread and everything else that same jesus was known among them in spirit the world can't see him praise god the church but the church seeing him the apostles know he's alive he tell them go and tell my disciple i'm not dead i'm raised from the dead he's the one that could pass you walls he's the one that can make his appearance tonight and he'll leave this and deliver you off this and free you of this and baptize you with it he's the one to do that do you believe that because you have to believe it you know hallelujah so watch they believe that what he was in the flesh he was also more in the spirit that is what they taught so this was what isaac this was taught to them you see what the expectation was you see what paul said i didn't come among you after the flesh i come to see jesus christ i'm crucified i don't want to know any man after the flesh and he said my preaching and teaching was not with enticing words of man wisdom and the purpose was that your faith wouldn't rest in flesh but your faith will rest in the power of god so when you see the power of god you will know that is where your faith is supposed to arrest him you could plug into that you can access that you know that is for you you could take it home with you tonight you could have it in your house you can have it in the kitchen in your bedroom and your bathroom wherever you go i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but the power of god is with you no weapon form against you will prosper i will not leave you comfortless i'm gonna come to you this is why they will see at me no more but you are gonna see me because i let you shall live also at that day you shall know or give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah praise god hallelujah that is what they taught that is what they believe that is what they practiced and that is what god confirmed oh glory to god they taught it they believe it they practice it and god confirm it oh give the lord a praise this night hallelujah let's continue during this time 32 years of lapse there become many false brethren raised up and brought in heresies just like today many false people in the message false as ever and they are spoken with books someone in person play and all but false brethren that is not unbelievable baptism brethren bringing heresies false teachings false doctrines false revelation and brought in heresies and brought a people off to theology and different things and paul i think of him laying there they come they told him this little jew with his hook nose laying there in prison the chains around him wrong his anchor and so forth he said well someone's preaching for gain some is turning other disciples aside then they begin to organize and a great organization and here was his credentials he said i have so many marks on my body that was put there i've been in perils upon the sea i've been perils among false brethren all these different things that he showed was marks his credentials before god he suffered for the cause of christ therefore god help us to have that type of credential today and let us contend for the faith the true faith that was once delivered to the saints the saints believe in the debt burial and resurrection they believe in the baptism of the holy spirit there's a strange thing today they believe in the baptism holy spirit the early church believe it you believe it then content for it content for with the baptism of the holy spirit they believe it you have to contend for it oh glory to god so we fight in for the faith right then who's the enemy let's see who the enemy is we know our enemy brethren i have i have led away from doctrine he said i've got to say this any enemy you say any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of god's word is your enemy it takes the word to defeat the enemy so don't shift the punctuation don't shift what the prophets say don't shift what in the bible before they talk the prophet said tell them let's show you any bible because the prophet come to reveal the bible a mystery scripture a previously hidden truth no divinely revealed and with the revelation of a supernatural element but a scripture a hidden truth being unveiled or revealed so it has to be back to the word or back to the bible so let me say it again any person any church any organization from trinidad or older trinidad any individual from trinidad or ultra trinidad that reasons against one punctuation of god's word is your enemy it takes the word to defeat the enemy so what we supposed to look for and then he but abram talked about moses was not permitted to take the churn of israel into promised land because he failed moses what he failed go talking let the air to moses but he failed and the church organization denomination has failed prophecy you ready they will not take the church over god will raise up a new system and enter the non-national system by by what by the power of god not by books not by everybody press play no a new system by the power of god hallelujah that will take the church into the promised land so the church has to be taken into the promised land god dropped moses like a hot potato and said more than my servant is dead no joshua take them people over oh glory to god and i say tonight there's more land to be taken it'll have hit tight in it it's got jebusite in it you have ammo rights in it to have all kind of ice in it but it's our land and we're gonna fight for it we'll give the lord a praise oh glory to god in many many men hallelujah it's an organization and the nomination has messed it up each one after their own theology each one after their own way of thinking but god will take his holy spirit and will raise up his joshua's plural and will take the church to the promise with no denominational strings tied anywhere but will take over his church that's a true anointed joshua faithful ministry we'll give the lord a shout god's commanded officers hallelujah give the lord a shout in the house he would raise up his joshuas by his holy spirit to take the people over moses had failed he was a lawgiver joshua's call of grace he took the church on we find out that joshua knowing his commission knowing that it laid in his hands god had called him for a duty and he must not fail he walked softly before god and when he called the people together and told him that god had commissioned him watch the request of the people they said we will follow you as we did moses if we can see the same thing that followed moses following you or give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah and god already told joshua as i was with moses so i will be with you oh my my my my hallelujah glory to god that ought to be the requirement of every born against person today if we are requested to follow then let us see the signs following the believer as jesus said the things that i do shall you do also i have asked you before to be sure to let your spiritual heart be opened this morning because i'm trusting you'll catch what i'm saying certainly namaste people all kinds of organizational gather here this morning from catholic and protestants he said no joshua had to take this command the people said let god be with you as he was at moses we will know that the same spirit that led us this far can take us on hallelujah you have to know if the spirit is here to take you on that let us see so so far but listen to this part brother branham prophecy how the church ought to look this morning to find the spirit working among people you mean we should look for that yes not not we'll bring in mighty revelations and inspiration and knowledge and information you know one day is present working where is that like i hear our brother say it's human flesh flesh and blood is what the empty ammonia the human spirit you know is what invent computer and technology and all this iphone and and 3g and 5g and 4g and then geometry they have it's human being dual as you know all the cars and airplanes human you know that's not divine revelation breakdown thing you know it's human being and human being can read the bible to you you know and bring their own theology i make their own god you know it's human being is not that what we want you know it's divine revelation you know you have to hear from heaven you know it's not human you know oh glory to god is not something how the church ought to look this morning to find the spirit working amongst the people if you want a church home where the spirit has raised christ from the dead the holy spirit that will move amongst the people that's the spirit that god has raised up in the last days to take the people over into another land into the full promise of all the blessings of god you have to see the spirit moving not the minister talking the spirit moving not the minister explaining the spirit moving not the minister revealing but the spirit moving you have to see the spirit moving oh give the lord some praises glory to god are you here this morning tonight hallelujah the promises of jewish children as israel sought for that promised land knowing that it was somewhere because there had been somebody there before so is the church we know there's a land somewhere there is power somewhere because we have been being others over there we know the landlady on the river and we are heading towards this morning trying to get into the promised land then he dropped this bomb here god called ministers ought not to be so stuffed up with theology but have visited the land to where we are going bringing back evidence of divine love and the power of jesus christ to make known to dear congregation that there's a land beyond the river so we have a right brother kangali to go into that land and bring back to this congregation evidence of divine love and the power of god to show there's a land beyond the river oh god have mercy help me jesus oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god where we long tonight exalting you what is the whole armor of god that's the question this is one of the questions we want to answer tonight what is the old armor and what it consists of with your lamb of god like peter was he was a good bitter sword when jesus got in trouble he pulled out his sword he could flop anywhere and cut off the high priestess silvan's a offered his sword but when they come to re-christian courage he didn't have it but the spiritual courage he denied the word made flesh standing right among them he was good with his sword he could duel the creed just as good as anybody else when he come to spiritual courage he didn't have it so he feel right there he only know wanting his creed but brother after he went up to pentecost he put on the whole armor of god watch him he's a different person now he put on the whole armor what was it that word that he walked with was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul oh god i could finish here tonight oh glory to god brother personally i could finish that right there tonight the way that was with him was now in him build him up in his flesh and in his soul no one at the church is so dead put on the whole hammer of god oh glory to god you have to see the armor and say i want that armor i'm going to put it on because you need that to fight this glorious fight of faith hallelujah glory to god amen he was a different person he put a new llama what was it the word that he walked with was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul he had the whole arm of god on that is god's provided armor he had the baptism and was filled with the holy ghost that's a nice word they're filled with the holy ghost not filled with theology not filled with doctrine not filled with praise god what happened sunset mountain not filled with that but filled with the holy ghost oh give the lord a shout information and sunset mountain so bang your canyon king's sword that i can help you right now you need to be filled with the holy ghost give the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god praise god praise god god can fill you tonight and hit it tonight to find your body fire your soul oh glory to god the fire is here tonight hallelujah what is it god makes himself ever present in his own army god on the day of pentecost send on the full armor of god for his army that was himself among you yet a little wife and the worst eat me no more yet he shall see me because i be with you even in you until the end of the world jesus christ him yesterday and forever well glory to god that same armor it is him he is the word and he is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is in us which is the word making the promise manifest this is the promise christ is the word and he makes it manifest okay the lord i shout do you see what's going to happen god christ will come among us and take his own word and make it manifest oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] the spirit quickens the word in other words he is the powder that sends the bullets over there like a powder when david met goliath with a slingshot with a rock on it he only had one place a hit and it between the eyes the rest of it was armored but god got in the spirit isn't that right i got plenty more here he said i'm going to say it brother the whole armor of god is the baptism of the holy ghost with the word behind it hold on hold on don't tell me she is only hold hammer don't tell me seven thunders all armor oh tell me new name theophany word body seal in his soul that's good but the whole armor is the baptism of the holy ghost with the word behind it whole llama hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and if anybody say they got the holy ghost and deny one word of this then it's not the holy ghost the holy ghost wrote this bible he said whosoever shall take anything out of it put anything in it the same will be taken as part of the book of life the holy ghost recognizes the word only oh glory because that is his word [Applause] somebody say somebody say we got the holy ghost but we don't believe in miracles then it proves you haven't got it anybody that called the power of god a desert and prophets and so forth in the last days mental telepathy something is born of the devil it can't be god don't recognize human term anything that recognizes on this flashes back the truth of god hallelujah so the the armor of god is the baptism of the holy ghost oh my do you believe that tonight oh somebody put on the armor onward christian so let's match into what with what yeah put on the full armor of god what is this armor made out of now hold your point now here's a good one if you're ready for it the christian looks at things that he doesn't see with his eyes for we look at the unseen how do you look at it with your inside eyes you see it by faith and to prove the whole christian armor is made up of unseen qualities what is a christian armor somebody says sin is believing that person was never been a christian because the armor of the christian is made up of this love did you ever see it you see me as an action but you ever seen love if you can pull your part of love out and let me see what it looks like love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness faith gentleness the whole christian armor is unseen with the natural eye but it is understood by the heart there you are oh blessed be the name of the lord oh glory to god amen hallelujah and i want to come back to something we read last sunday and close off this whole thing he presents his army in the form of five offices who does that god apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes on any grounds they're trained they have before armor they're ready to meet the enemy on any grounds that he comes on isn't that right each one backing one another up with him the chief captain so they're not on their own they have a captain these commanding officers have a captain that captain is not in jacksonville that captain is not in america or south america or caribbean or or europe or africa that captain is the chief captain not a captain the chief captain so the fifo ministry will be under the chief captain he is the one giving them instruction when the elders wanted joshua to wait through the water the chief captain tell him tell him three days we crossing over and jordan river high oh glory to god every man line up because the captain gave instructions and joshua only passed that instruction from the captain hallelujah when they touched the river jordan jordan open up oh glory to god and they walk on dry crown hallelujah josh i want to take jericho here from the captain are you forced are you against this i am the captain of the horse i come to give you instructions how to take this wall or give the lord a shout and all you do to tell the people when i beat you to shout shout walk around and shut him out walk around and keep quiet walk around and wait to turn look at the lord i shout to the house hallelujah don't stir up nothing don't try to pretend anything just wait upon the lord hallelujah hallelujah and any time they follow instructions they see a result a result of god one time there was fun and i was drunk in the land he said dig dig me out valley full of ditches majestic just dig it dry but dig this dig dig dig you got water coming you wouldn't hear it you wouldn't feel it you wouldn't smell it but oh where you dig you'll have water oh give the lord a shout and if you dig deep enough in your life and make room god going to bring the spirit upon your life and fill every crevice of your being oh hallelujah praise god so this army this fightful ministry that some make a mockery of hallelujah trying to make they're trying to make nolan vodka fight for ministry hallelujah but if i want you to stand in the face it's a big fat no hallelujah no no no praise god is that man callers is that a man called me it's god that call is that even by the brown call listen you know it's god that call you know you can call you who you get baptized in jesus name is the spirit move upon your heart is that a man taking dragon the ocean and dip you inside there and baptize in jesus name is god call you therefore you are god call man if you know god call you a god-called man you're a god-called woman you can't get a man become between you and god oh glory to god you are caught called man that means you have the ability to hear from god oh glory to god if we speak in the word tonight then you can hear from god you will receive the word and believe the word then you could get something from the word isn't that right each one backing one and up with him the chief captain not out in front up here above back behind but in them so brother branham oh my brother is just the holy spirit he he laid out in such a way to show you it could be in front it could be above you know people like a picture they have a light over the head they're lighting them we don't know have actually side and they pose in really light like if it's instagram they're posing this is scarier when i read in harvest time how about in in harvest time he said that you will get a supernatural offer to some gift some kind of thing for people to follow you is that what you want you want some big ministry anything yeah when them fellas were following christ with all the ministry they had this christ ministry that god gave him a lease on just hold that do you have all the ghosts shall we like elijah thank you all of a sudden anointed fifa fire of all the fire they want to burn somebody just saying you didn't know what spirit you have a little blessing again you want to do your own thing and run you want to get lighter your spiritual next minute they see somebody preaching and you're not with them shall we stop him she said lizzie man alone the man talking about me is the iranian coming against me if you're preaching about me but abraham revealed they were jealous of the man the man was doing something they wasn't doing and they find they supposed to be in charge of he that's the problem there no they want a holy school tale and because the man independent they say i probably shall we stop him because you know jesus between you and i you know me we in front we are disciples right right jesus jesus straighten them out what so each one backing one another up with him the chief captain not out here in front up here above back behind them but in them that's the army vindicating physically what i'm still reading finnick is in what his resurrection by proof of his works how else could people know he's raised from the dead if not the works of jesus has not been done when the works of jesus be made manifest it's evidence this is jesus it's not flesh and blood then brother branham sticking saint john 14 12. jesus said he that believeth on me the books that i do shall he do also what is it it is god in the church in these five predestinated offices backing up every word that he said with the holy spirit himself in deer which is the word made manifest proving his resurrection to when he lives in these men so watch but the banham says there's no moving faculty past the eyes he was the eyes he's the seer next is the intelligence so the intelligence have to come down the intelligence is not separated from your head from your brains the intelligence needs a body to walk through so the fightful ministry will be a channel that the intelligence of god could drop down and walk through his body and move out to the bride oh glory to god hallelujah and then you will see evidence of the intelligence which is to know what god wants done with the word and that is the supreme anointing knowing what and how oh give the lord a shout do you understand that tonight it's not just making a racket and a bunch of noise but clarity to know what and how he said the bride the secret is the word is the bride then she has what the mind of christ what's that the intelligence to know what he wants done with the word oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you see it tonight so what she said the holy spirit himself in there which is the word made manifest proven his resurrection proving that he lives all other religions are dead their forms are dead there's only one that's right that's christianity because christ is a living in the church making his word manifest for he is the same and if the same word it will do the same thing and show the same works and the same signs matthew 28 says so be with his army that great word general triumph in us the great triumph general who came down the word made flesh took that word and defeated satan on every girl why he was the word fortified by the word he rose and he conquered debt hell the grave and himself come back in the form of the holy ghost to fortify his army for the last days so the holy ghost was released for fortification of god's army they say on uk and they're begging for guns at one time they stopped people from signing up to the army because they know what happens to them god is not that yeah god have the weapons you know and the nice thing about the lord weapons it doesn't have to improve iran version one on version two one version three it looks just as good it's original weapon it destroyed the enemy in the beginning you're gonna show the enemy in the end and praise god you feed the enemy in the beginning we're going to defeat him again you can't even get kicked out it's the word it's the weapon he doesn't have to improve in it it's powerful devil tried to talk you out of the power of it is the power of revelation it's the power of the word the word is spirit the word is life the word is not just word only my word the word i speak unto you they are spirit in their life hallelujah so it was the word amen watch watch he conquered that hell in the grave and himself come back in the form of the holy ghost to fortify this army for the last days in this big onslaught comer in this big onslaught hear this bomb where are these great intellectual giants rising up reasoning against the word do you see what we're fighting not small giants you know this is big intellectual hallelujah giants i unslaughter them oh glory to god they have the majority of people in this message the holy ghost bunch is undecided minority in case you don't know he said what the holy ghost has given for is to stand on the side of the minority and watch the black skies roll back and the power of god moving and take over oh give the lord a shout that is what the holy ghost was given for we don't we're not going to decide the majority you know we're on the minority side that's why i don't care what they think and what they say i have nothing to do with that let them run the run oh glory to god i know the holy ghost it's just as real as it was on the day of pentecost and i won that same real one that peter had that paul had all the disciples had with signs and wonders and miracles silver and gold have i known but such as that have given unto you nothing less than that not no books and tapes you are books until they give up let them give it out but the pride will be turned back to the faith of the fathers oh give the lord some praises glory the woman of the world wasn't caught up and ordained to meet no books and tapes hallelujah she was ordained to meet messiah herself i that's speaking to you i'm here and there's a bunch of people in the last days they are destinated to see the word made flesh and when the word made faster invisible is made visible oh god and failing you he said one day gonna wake up i know god is in you glory to god the word is in you god is in you hallelujah hallelujah so therefore the holy ghost again it's a fortifies army for this last day in this big onshlot where these great intellectual giants rising up reasoning against the word but i'm not give you comfortless i'll come again and be with you again he said i'll pray the father he will send you another comforter which is the holy ghost he will abide with you forever what is it the word god's artillery and the human being manifest in the resurrection think of it that great conqueror who conquered every sickness conquered every superstition conquered every giant conquered everything there is to be conquered on earth died conquered hell conquered dead conquered the grave conquered the atmosphere i stand it up on high and come back in the form of the holy ghost and we are more than conquerors to him that loved us oh glory to god you said the prophet laid out conquer every living thing and come down the holy ghost to empower that we could become more than conquerors oh glory to god what an army like a mighty army matching christian soul is a man great triumph he is in us not me he already conquered it i don't have to do a thing but just believe him and walk on yes sir for he has risen his spirit is in us the great victor the resurrection his presence is in us we have raised from the things of the world from unbelief and creeds to a living christ with every power of the enemy defeated that's the revelation stumbling into you know you're stumbling a revelation that every power of the enemy is defeated so you rise in the power that already defeat him you are anointed with the power that already defeat him do not fight somebody devil you know oh glory to god you're buying this strong man jesus explained it already you can't muscle in a man house and take as good without buying a strong man you say all them horses are strong men and they'll get everything inside the house and they'll buy these strong man oh glory to god the wages are the castle devils it gave a witness that this kingdom is not of this world we fight in a higher battle a higher order we wrestle not against flesh and blood against principalities and powers spiritual wickedness not against brethren spirits on them hallelujah he conquered it not what i am is what he is let me read it back again even that itself is defeated which the whole church was here tonight every power of the enemy defeated every power even that itself is defeated he said hell is defeated well i know i was listening to something he said the hell was critically developed he's a human wasn't supposed to go to helena he said they descended itself there but hell was created for the devil and his angels hallelujah adam fallen race wasn't supposed to be connected with that oh my hallelujah hell is defeated grave is defeated every six is defeated amen not me a conqueror he conquered it's not what i am it's what he is where is that in me i've passed some death into life so now are you ready oh god knowing at this last days there will come intellectual giants there will come everything intellectual all kinds of an enemy with reasoning powers to try to prove to the church that the days of miracles is past and all this god packed in the baptism of the holy ghost with what which speaking in tongues into petition that don't god put that all inside speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies gifts and all kind of things that may seem hard in training but brother on the battlefront every one of them's got to be used god equips his soldiers exactly what it takes to use and they might say just live in psychology that won't work no sir that's as thin as i brought me to the shell of a chicken that started dead so that's no good we have to have power of the holy ghost coming upon a man with all nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him [Music] still need the holy ghost come upon him jesus got the holiness upon him what did jesus say when he went to the temple the spirit of god is upon me who is me the word for he has anointed me to do this and to do that you have to be anointed god calling you and making you become the word then is come back to revelation 2017 the spirit and the bride who's the briden the word the spirit comes upon what the word the pride becomes what the word so the spirit comes upon you they say come go give the lord some praises that is what gives the bride the voice that's what give the by the message the spirit the spirit only come into the word spirit comes to the bride so watch this you say i i just don't like to get out i i don't like to pray all night i i you said then you will get killed and alternate by the front did you hear that let me say it again to you listening out there listen to this one you say i i do like to get old i i do i do like to pray all night i i do what he said then you won't get killed in the battlefront you stay there till god equips you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you've got need of in this world or the world to come lives right in you the all-wise god knowed how to equip his army he equipped it with the baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly what he sent for these last days he knew that we have to have it but upon she had a bomb here he knew that people would reason would go to reading this word when it come on print out here that that it would happen oh you mean we had this poke book it's on print yes so he know that because it's on print it will work up mr reason and the lecture go get inspired because it can print and they could figure it out mix it out drag it out i'm going to say it again this he knew that we'd have to have it what the holy ghost he knew that people reason would go to reading this word when it become in print out here what would happen and today we find people saying well no where is the god of history where is a god across the red sea where is the god that healed the sick you see what good does it do to give a canary bird vitamins i'm making off strong winds and keeping my cage that's what they try to do with people feed them all kind of things vitamins and thing and they clear fly and they're getting seeds mysteries all kinds of they catch up bumping up the wings but the trap then we know hallelujah glory to god are you with me the first thing you know tell them all the days a miracle is past you're pinned up in some little thing like that it's a lie i'm reading christ is the same yesterday and forever here we go are you ready almost done god knowed musician come on please it would take the baptism of the holy ghost to prove his latter-day signs let me read that again god knows it will take the baptism of the holy ghost to prove his latter day signs and that is why they don't want to emphasize dynamics spirit baptism they don't want to do that they can't produce it they don't want to go deer because it ruins their intellectual influence and their intellectual teaching and preaching and that's why we said on sunday teaching can do it christ did something among them that make them know that he's the same it's not it was supernatural satan knows still continue that reasoning and where reason lays yes sir to be an effectual witness of his resurrection he knowed it will take the holy ghost cause man cannot do these things he equipped his army with the holy ghost to do those things to make known the seekers of the heart as he promised you can't do it with any kind of training you've got to do it by the baptism of the holy spirit the armor of god and this is the even light to make hebrews doesn't it a reality it will take more than a training you can read words and read words and read words he said three times and it will never make it come to pass until you have the holy ghost here to manifest that that word reading again by terence this is brother branham you can read words and read words and read words it will never make it come to pass until you have the holy ghost there to manifest that that's the light putting on the whole armor of god not just address only and dress up and say glory to god i got the holy ghost then you are splitting all the power out and all to do you're doing no good put it in action put it in faith make it move make it do something isn't that something what we see should make a church that will make a revival that we will find and say the seven thunders that are not even written is manifested here the prophet says don't just ball glory to god i got the holy ghost then you are spurting all the power out the whistle you're doing no good put it in action put it in faith make it move make it do something put on the whole armor of god to go out and withstand the wise of the devil when they say jesus christ is a fake religion it's been dead for a long time there's no such a thing there's no such thing as that and the days of america's past stand there with the baptism of the holy ghost and prove that is the truth you think i act funny maybe i am i've lost my mind to the world unfounded in christ let the mind of christ be in you take the baptism of the holy ghost the whole armor of god not just to shake hands with the preacher or put your name on the book or take some kosher and swallow it and some priest drink up some wine that isn't it brother stay there until there comes a russian mighty wind no pass i could bring that until you come a russian mighty wind that fill your whole being take all the doubts out take all the creeds out take
