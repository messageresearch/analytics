oversighted Jesus and we ask it amen amen God blessing me have your seat amen what a blessing is to be here this morning and I am looking forward to see what the Lord will do and just I think this is the first time I'm standing here to express my gratitude to you all for the convention for your support and everything else and you who have contributed financially because sort of tremendous blessing we are going to get some new tents people at the park we have to put behind here for translation and I don't have enough words to thank but uh Sheen but the Bevin punch praise God it's a Judith and the whole team but the Batiste and his wife and so many we have called so many names that has put labor out to do what was done but I might black man I mean just so much I didn't put any list today but I'm grateful we are grateful we are thankful the Believers went back blessed and we still have receiving testimonies and I just want to read this other one here on behalf of zyde and I December Kelly south from USA I would also like to extend our thanks to yourself the ministry here and those in The Headstone Tabernacle who put forth such colossal effort to bring about such tremendous convention to that so that all would find near could be blessed strengthened and edified I pray that God would continue renew your strength and the strength of all those who so gallantly and very evidently uh to us put their shoulders to the wheel to make the convention possible may God bless you all I also continue to pray for those who travel so far to be a blessing to us even those who are online and especially the religion ministers who give their all we saw it or we will not forget may God continue to strengthen them into a prayer we look forward in seeing you all and so on brother Kelly and sister zaida God bless you thank you brother Kelly and you know it costs a lot to come to Trinidad I'm always from Ivory Coast and South Africa it costs a lot and those Believers and um not just the cost but the time to travel sometimes if you have not been doing from plane to plane traveling overseas it could be such a hard and tedious thing so we supposed to appreciate it they don't have to come here it's something why they come but they don't have to come but we are grateful that they take the time off they have to take time from the jobs that'll make the sacrifices and everything else so it's a lot of time putting it and sometimes it's scary for us hosting because it's such a challenging at times but we we face after the challenge and we that's why we could appreciate your financial contribution um what you have done and your Hulu labored in the Tabernacle to get it right and we're just grateful to God what Ram says is the difference when you have a meeting in a stadium than in a church so we have we are grateful that we could have our own church here people that come and be really blessed amen praise God also another testimony I would like to express a vote of thanks to God for making all things possible for me even when I was not right he still blessed me beyond measure I spoke about over and his wife and I told him of my personal experiences in the past of three years four co-workers died murdered covet cancer suicide younger people and I they showed me it's possible to think you are living a great life good job big accomplishment all for nothing I remember during my prison training the officers would insult me telling me you are fat you can't make it leave you can't do this and while they spoke these things I used to look in the sky above and say I'm going to make it I'm doing this for my family but no my focus has changed when the Devil comes with his insults I'm looking past him just like I was on the ground on training College I'm seeing my family leaving behind this decaying world I'm seeing depression going sickness gone the gift of the Holy Ghost and it is possible if 94 of millionaires were once poor imagine the possibilities of a backslider like me last Sunday brother Raymond Thompson said if it's one question training that I came for if you are sincere come to the prayer line I walk through the prayer line I receive my blessing and went back downstairs all at once the power of God came over me I felt such a Blessed Assurance I knew without the doubt that this was God the experience with God can't be explained I just feel like all my life I didn't really know him not until now giving me a new purpose I apologize to the Saints who was comforting me and held on today and almost like I didn't want to let it go but sister over for a support and prayer from henceforth this child of God is waiting for the new Commission in a life a waiting for the instructions until then I will be reported the duty every day on my knees for where he leads me many many times about over and all the ministers from all over the world your work and struggles are not in vain but Raymond Thompson I am the one person in Trinidad you spoke about sister nicoda praise God Amen God praise amen love him this morning okay all right so this morning we have a special tip that I'd like to share with you this morning I felt like to play this and it's a message from the prophet in his presence not a long message but I want to get something across there and I I got a witness of it so I know that uh we aim for blessing I want to read a scripture from um this is from First Corinthians chapter one we want to read from verse 18. you could you could you could for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are safe it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wines and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world have not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of the word of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign in the Greek Seeker after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block unto the Greek's foolishness but unto them which are called what Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren how not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to come and from the wise God had chosen the weak things of the world to confront the things that which are Mighty but these things of the world are the things that are despised that God chosen ye and things which are not to con to bring to note the things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence that's the part of universities that no flesh could glory in his presence and yet find out that brother Branham actually described about being in his presence and what that does and the effect of being his presence so I want to have what I call it notes for this for this Tiffany in his presence all right brother Brown this a man now listen this service is very important doesn't matter if it's two people here this morning I want you to take it to heart this is very very important for the brand there's some seeds you put in here now we believe that the hour has come that Saint John 14 12 must be fulfilled we believe that Malachi form must be fulfilled we believe that Luke 7 must be fulfilled we believe all these prophecies stop running don't get out of his presence just move up into his presence that's right I know that's what you're Desiring to do because I see licensing out there from Texas and Louisiana everywhere it's not to run from his presence but to run into his presence and sometimes we don't want to go into his presence because we feel God will tell us no and God will tell us not with that way to go so we don't want to hear from God because you know God will tell you different to your own thoughts and ideas but we are challenged this morning to move up into his presence get on the ship with us tonight we are going down to tashes to cry out the Nineveh to cry out we are letting the township to go on down if they want to we have got a duty to be to God and a message to be responsible for so that's not run away from his presence now remember in the Old Testament was debt to go in oh it's debt to be outside let's continue to HH as Daniel heard the seven Thunders and forbidden on John heard the voices and this book was sealed on the back of the book was seen with Seven Seals but in the days of these Series in May known here we go the mystery of God would be finished in other words God would be known in his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God will be revealed so people talk about Revelation and Mysteries and you unfold of the word but listen to this the mystery of God will be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries will open to the church and he's talking about the seven issues on the back of the book which is seven Thunders because India India after all the messages revealed in there the church would be living prophecy under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive among us living among us and then we are worshiping the living Christ that's Among Us it have no man there it have no fivefold there it'd have no Apostle there it'll have no Prophet there it'll have no Pastor there it'll have no Bishop there it'll have him moving in and out okay the Lords and praises so when you come to church what must be your expectation your expectation is for him come in Among Us he could come in this morning Among Us confirming the word with signs then we are worshiping the living Christ that's Among Us so you're not lifting your hands up and you don't know what you're worshiping dear said we know what we worship the father seeketh such a worship in in spirit and in truth hallelujah let's continue father but Abraham condemnation by representation so it is now at the near coming of Jesus again just like the vine if the vine puts forth a branch and that Branch was a Pentecostal Branch filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders and fruits follow that Branch if that vine ever put forth another Branch it'll be the same kind of Branch we know that father by Nature itself and we do know that you can graft any fruit that's pertained to that vine it will live by the vine we know we can take orange tree and grow Citrus of different kinds seven eighths and put lemons in it but we believe what if that tree brings forth its own Branch again it will be an orange Lord it will be like the first one was and then he prophesy and we believe that there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and later in it will be scattered throughout the world in this loud recent age it will be a church that's called back to the original faith in God that's why we have contending for the faith it will be a church that's called back to the original Faith Of God it will be a church that will have Jesus us walking in it manifesting himself the shout of the king will be in it not not that church not no formal church not no message church but the church where Jesus walking in it and the shout of the king will be in it oh praise God praise God are you with me this morning a blushing Prophet but a mom says he says but when you see a servant of God get so sincere till he's on his face with his hands in the air praying to God and blushing because of the iniquity of the people then you're going to see a Revival start a man here it is a man a cannot lay in the presence of God then he switches a church cannot lay in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and give unction and power to start a move of God in dear among the people it just got to be could we say Amen then he says show me a man you write it with me this morning show me a man show me another Calvin Knox finny Sankey any of those who feels the burden of the people that will lay on their face and cry and pray before God send us another John Smith of the Baptist Church again who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes would be swell shut next morning from weeping till his wife would lead him to the table and feed him with his breakfast out of a spoon show me a John Wesley a fireman snatch on the fire I will show your Revival oh praise God praise God just a few more are we going to get the tape on Supreme he said let's bald heads their God we are happy this afternoon for this privilege that we have assembled ourselves together once more and you alone know know our hearts has yearned for this hour that we can stand before thy people again and bring this message that is to be so vitally feeling so urgent in this hour that was allotted us a few days now and we pray dear God that your hand and mercy will be upon us guide us and direct us and give us those things which we have need of Lord for our hearts even to know you better we see the Great Harvest feel or white and ripe I know the green is ready now for the great threshing time dear God we pray hear me here we go we pray that you'll open back the shocks from around us Spirit pull back they have to pull back that's a prayer pull back the shots Hallelujah the seed have to stand alone but the sharks have to pull back the shocks was covering up the seed but there comes an hour when that hot July sun no glory to God begin to strike that seed Hallelujah and when the grain getting golden brown the shock drying up so hear what he said you know he said God we pray you open back the shocks from around us let us lay in the presence of the son now these next few days and ripen to the kingdom of God I love how we phrase that and right hand to the king of God then he continued I believe we have truth and I'm satisfied of that I believe the wheat absolutely the shock is pulling away from it you know I may give a little Prelude on that tomorrow night how the shock is pulling away from the wheat now the wheat don't pull us from the shock it's always a shock pulling away the wheat stands stands haven't done all the standard we just stands isn't that right are you with me all right hold the Shockers pull him on the weak but the weed has to lay in the presence of the sun that's a command that's an order that's a requirement so they have to have presence that you can lay in not Mysteries not teaching not Revelations presence okay the Lord a shout shout out presence so we have to come into presence not man of God of the hour man of the hour not that we have to come into presence are you with me now but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the Son of God to ripen and that is what we're here for friend stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here till it becomes so right for Christ is to become bread on the table oh praise God do you believe that this morning just a few more and we'll done so when there was nature we see where every age directly designed it out in the last age the shock has pulled away and we are 15 years nearly 20 now of the message sweeping across from Nations and nation and this morning hooked up across this nation no organization can't organize hear what he said now no he's got nothing to his people now the thing that's the matter with the message today is let me read that statement again this is the prophet speaker the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who optimate in their hearts must lay in the presence of the Sun to get right now faith can grow faith can be stunted Faith Can mature Faith Can ripen fail could be tested faith faith is something else are you with me so you're saying those who obtain it in the heart enhance him must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you making you mature Christians oh so the message come from us to be mature yes when I was a child I speak like a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I I put away I a choice you put away childish things are you with me now you see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church you know what kind of church it is we must have that type of Christian for him to receive so all these Pampers and baby bottle and pacifiers all them thrown out because it has to be mature Christians that he has to receive and those mature Christians as those who are willing to lay God can lay you in the sun you know you have to want to lay in his presence okay the Lord send Praises you have to want the greenest baked out that's the word he used the greenness what baked out it take the Sun to do that they take

entitled well I did a long time you know is that right you have faith the woman you see the little trailer we have for the first thing there was a judge another woman and he woman nobody just responded she said because he coming continually she want to offends me of my adversary give me give me a cause be righteous to me justify me oh God not take into us an answer you see me yesterday you see me again tomorrow that's how you have to be in prayer you're not gonna take no other answer I have got to be delivered I've got to get a breakthrough I've got to get the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God and Jesus hear what the unjust judge said shall not God avenge his elect who cried day at night okay the Lord some Praises so if you want to sit and stare you sit and steal but there's going to the kingdom of God has preached and every man entitled to it that the Bible they pressuring into it oh glory to God final quote I'll be gonna go straight into the tape and hold on to your seat don't let no if yeah they got two people this morning make sure you receive this message there's something in it this is more than the anointing and the atmosphere this is his presence and the effect of his presence upon your life the Chief already go into his presence he said I believe that's quote I will go straight into the tape I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand it so that's not the question but friend listen we have got to lay in the presence of the sun we have got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we hear in a message that God has given us seeing the signs he showed us proving that by the Bible it is there how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so it can be done you're talking about you in a robe of his presence you become a sweet Christian you see this sour lemon lime behavior that you have now when that sweetness come over you and the sweetness is evidence you're about to give birth because when a woman is pregnant coming to the nine months a sweet Spirit comes over her because she's a proud to produce life so the sweetness is just the sweetness in a vague sense sweetness is also evidence that you're coming to full term and you're about to bring forth that man child even Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost itself okay the Lord some Praises hallelujah how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so it can be done sometime in speaking a message you get harsh you have to break it like that because you have to cleanse your nail to make it whole but once the church gets it and I hope it gets it this morning one that just gets it the elected is called out and separate them in the presence of God I know it will be something like that people was there when it takes the Rapture may God bless you and they go straight into the tape blessed be the name of the Lord it is in his presence and I want you to listen and please close attention amen prison thank you now Lord bless you real richly good evening friends it's a grand privilege to be back here in this building again tonight and feeling the never failing presence of Our Lord as these give the promise and now I know that many of you have stayed over for the little message tonight which I am very thankful and many of you has to drive far yet tonight to get home some are checked out of your motels as I understand and we are going to try not to hold you long so that's reason we come in early so we could get away early and now we will just as soon as I can I will announce when we are going to maybe start uh I've had some calls this afternoon the only one we was going to start on these books are this uh chapters and I think if the Lord willing I want to take the next time that we start on the Seven Seals of Revelations and the Seven Natural seals and then if we get to in time take the Seven Seals on the back of the book see now that may take a little time uh see there's Seven Seals it's open the seven plague seven trumpets all those sevens and them seals we could take first but then on the back of the book is sealed with Seven Seals Daniel heard the voices the Thunders and was forbidden to write it John was forbidden to write it but it was sealed on the back side of the book that is after all of the Mysteries of the book has been given out and revealed you know as Daniel said there the Mysteries and the days of these voices the mystery of God should be unfolded by that time see the mystery who God is high was made flesh all these things should be unfolded by that time and then then we're ready for the Seven Seals on the back side of the book that's not even revealed to man not even wrote in the Bible but they'll have to be just exactly compare with the rest of the Bible and I'll think it'll be a great thing so now um uh we're going to try to hurry to get through thank everyone of you for your kindness and your presence and and all that you have done we thank you very much and now I I'm trusting that we won't keep you too long tonight because you're so patient to sit stand my wife said back there she's talking about last night she said I've seen women that were even rather heavy set standing there in their clothes ringing wet so they are just grasping every word that's reason I like to stay under the anointing of the Holy Ghost that when you come out you're telling them people the honest truth I think they're just nothing but the truth and then they can lay on to that and it'll be all right now uh I want to ask your apologies for a few moments I left a little early this morning and the tapes are turned off at this time and uh um just in a moment um tell the recorders when I turn

listens to this tape that they would like to get back and get last night's tape it's in your home it's the the present stage of the ministry that the Lord has given me especially I like for ministers to hear that before I visit their churches and come in their homes now I'd like from the to get that now this morning we spoke on the subject of the countdown the church ready to leave and now tonight God willing we're speaking on the subject of in his presence oh how we thank God for the privilege that we can come into His presence the first I wish you all to turn in your Bibles with me to the prophet Isaiah the sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah we all know that Isaiah was a major prophet and one of the great prophets of his day he ended his life for being sought asunder with Sauls for our testimony as a martyr to the power of almighty God in the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter I begin at the fifth verse 3. then said I woe is me or maybe I start with the first verse let's pardon me a moment let's start at the first verse and read down until about the eighth verse in the year the king azekiah died I saw also the Lord setting up on a throne high and lifted up in his train fill the temple above it stood the serpents each one having six wings between he covered his face and between he covered his feet and with Twain he didn't fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory I am the host of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lives and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for in our eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of this therapy unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the thongs from off the altar and he laid it up on my mouth and said Lord this has touched thy lips thine iniquity is taken away and our sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying who shall I send and who will go for us then said I here I am send me may the Lord bless his word I think that's the most striking scripture we find that in the presence of God man recognized themselves to be sinners we may feel pretty good when we're out different places and feel like that we're pretty good people but when we ever come into the presence of God then we see how little we are [Music] standing out long ago with a A friend of mine that I had the privilege of leading to Christ Bert call up in New Hampshire a hunting partner we're standing by Colebrook Falls up in the Adirondack and it was such a mammoth big Falls I've taken my family last year up there to look at it way back off the road you have to hike back to get to it and when we seen that blue green water pouring with such a mighty power out of the mountains and gushing down over the Rocks virgin stood down to me and he said Gee Billy it makes the man feel just so little he measured about a quarter of an inch on his fingers I said that's right Bert now that was all he knowed of getting into the presence of God to see his creation a winner of the man who wrote How Great Thou Art if he didn't look up one night look at the stars how far they are away a few months ago brother Fred brother woods and I was standing with brother mcinally out in the Arizona desert we was measuring giant one star how close it was to the other and with the millions and billions of miles away they didn't look over a quarter of an inch from each other then we begin to think according to scientific proof of that those stars are probably farther away from each other than we are from now see how it is then we realize how little we are when we realize how great he is and how close we come in of coming to his presence somehow another it's always stroke a great effect upon people they're coming to the presence of God I've seen the time in my Ministry when you see the presence of God come into such a place that it would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them and call out their sins of all kinds of immoral Acts and it brings such a holy hush amongst the people until they drop out of the prayer line before they ever come up to be prayed for and run to the altar get right with God before they come up into his presence there's something about coming into the presence of God it causes things to happen I've seen people laying eggs constant stretchers that night down there at Mexico when that little dead baby laying under a blanket that's a little Spanish mother brought up a little Mexican mother rather brought up when they sing several thousands of those people saw maybe 50 or 75 000 at one Gathering solve that little dead baby come to life winning faded people threw up their hands and screamed why they realize that a human being could not do that and that they were in the presence of almighty God and it caused something to happen I've been privileged to hear godly man speak it was said one time of Charles spinning little bitty fella never weighed over about 110 pounds but he had such a forceful way of speaking until he was trying the Acoustics one day in a building they didn't have PA systems then and there was a man repairing up in the balcony or up in the roof of the place and he heard the man come in so he didn't know who they were he just kept quiet Mr Feeney was going to try the Acoustics after spending much time in prayer for that Revival that he's going to hold he tried his voice the sea I would carry he slipped up quickly to the pulpin and said repent or perish and he said it was such fourth Force after being or they don't need God till the man dropped out of the top of the balcony down onto the floor out of the top of the building onto the floor he preached the gospel in such way till he stood and Boston Massachusetts and a little bay window that causes no church could hold his cloud and he stood there with such Mighty force and preached held such a place onto a working man with their baskets under their arms fell into the street and screamed for mercy yeah you're the presence of God great preachers who's been able by the word of God to bring the presence of God to an audience all this that man would ever be so seared in their hearts so they could never recognize the presence of God when the first man as soon as he had sinned and done something wrong and when God came into his presence or he came into the presence of God Adam he could not stand in the presence of God Amen he run and hid himself in the bush and tried to cover himself with a fig Leaf because he knowed he was standing In The Presence of Jehovah the Creator that was the reaction of the first man after he had sinned and tried to come into the presence of God with sent upon his soul he could not hide because he was tendering sin and I took a hole like it has rooted into people's hearts today but he was very conscious that he was standing before his creator now he hid himself in the bushes and would not have come out and could not come out until God had made a preparation for him we could go back and take in Genesis the 17th chapter and the third verse when the Great patriarch Abraham when he came into the presence of God and God spoke to him in the 17th chapter in the name of almighty God Abraham fell on his face the great patriarch servant of God could not stand in the presence of God though I had served him for 25 years Faithfully but when God moved into his presence the patriarch fell on his face because he couldn't stand in the presence of God in Exodus 3 we find that Moses the great servant and prophet of God when he was back on the back side of the desert that man was a holy man he had been born for the purpose he was born from his mother's wombs to be a prophet he had tried to get his education and do everything he could to deliver his people because he understood that he was to deliver his people but when he understood it by a theological standpoint he was trained he was well scholar he could teach the Egyptians wisdom which was the most smartest people in the world he known all the ins and outs he knowed the scripture from A to Z he knows the promises that God had made he noted from an intellectual standpoint and he was a a great military man but one day on the back side of the desert when he come into the presence of God he jerked off his shoes and fell to his feet knowing that he was on Holy Ground ever he could not stand upon his feet when he come in the presence of God he fell to his face like Abraham did he could not stand in the presence of God in Exodus 19 19 when the chosen people of God sent the way back in the days of Abraham from Abraham come Isaac Isaac come Jacob by Jacob come the Patriarchs and years after years that developed holy man great man a chosen people a chosen race a Sanctified holy people and served God their life and one day God said Gather Israel out here I'm going to speak to them but when God came down on top of Mount Sinai amen and the whole Mountain caught a fire and the smoke was dying from the lack of furnace and the voice of God Gloria Israel fell on their faces and let Moses speak and not God lest we die man in the presence of God realizes he's a sinner yet they were everyone circumcised according to the law they had carried the Commandments and everything but when God spoke and they moved up into his presence they realized that they were out they were they were not right there was something that was lacking because they were in the presence of God yes and they said let Moses speak and not God for God speaks will all die let Moses speak to us it was in Luke 5 8 that when Peter oh when he is a great stubborn man and a man of great influence great power that we understand he was like a bullying adulted fisherman but when he saw the miracle of God performed by an ordinary Man look like which he recognized at that time that that taken more than a man to throw all that fish in a net where he with all of his education his knowledge efficient had fished all night not even taken a thing but he heard someone say cast your net in and when he began to pull he had a great multitude of fishes and he realized that he was a sinful man and he said depart from the O Lord for I am a sinful man who said that Saint Peter and the presence of God asked for God to depart out of his presence because he recognized himself a sinner Abraham recognized himself wrong recognized himself wrong which was the son of God recognized himself wrong Moses recognized himself from Israel as a church and Nation recognize themselves wrong depart from me for I am a sinful man he didn't try to say now I'm holy and worthy to receive this he said I am a sinful man one time a self-style religionist with all the theology they can learn under a great teacher called romelia his name is Saul of Tarsus which we know as Paul religious synonym you know all the ins and out of their religion he was a Pharisee of the Pharisee in a Hebrew of the Hebrews he was a noted man a scholar smart shrewd educated painted old God from vadia one day on his road down to Damascus any felonies off of his feet to the ground in the dust and said Lord what would you have me to do all these great training all these great theological training all of his education didn't mean a thing when he stood in the presence of God I like to stop you and it didn't say that's the same thing you might have dollar DD PhD whatever you might be you might have went to church since you was a child you might have done all the religious acts there is but once in the presence of God pain you feel so little and no count realized that he was wrong and he fell to the ground under the influence and power when he looked up and seen the very God that he had been preaching and against Authority note and seen that he was wrong he fell from his feet to the ground because he was in the presence of God he's seen that Pillar of Fire what about the great Saint John of Revelations 1 7. when he was show division I looked I heard a voice speaking to him and he turned to look to see the voice and he saw seven golden candlesticks and one stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with hair like wool eyes like flames of fire feet like pillars of rest he was girded with the golden girl around the past and he was called the word of God and when the Great Saint John oh had walked with Christ leaned upon his bosomes when he done all these things that God said this morning Paul's Ministry exceeded alien year after John had walked with Jesus talked with him slept with him eat with him but when he's seen him standing there that glorified State he said he fell like a dead man think of it we could come to church and talk and praise God and so forth but a whole brother when we see him coming something will be different in our hearts we might think we do our religious duty but go to church and pay our tithing we might think that we keep the laws of the churches recite all the Creeds but once let us get a look at him the whole things changed all the way around [Music] yes sure this great man Saint John a great man like that the Bible said in Revelations 1 7 that he fell as if he was a dead man after a three and a half years of fellowship with Christ was one of the writers of the Epistles rolled behind him eat with him at the table slept with him at the bed and fellowship with him forever he went but when he's turned to see him he had no more life left in him he fell like a dead man to the floor or to the ground all right we see Isaiah in Isaiah 6 and 5 as we've just ran this Great Mighty prophet he's one of the greatest prophets there is in the Bible there are 66 books of the Bible there's 66 chapters in Isaiah Isaiah starts off in Genesis the middle of Isaiah he brings to the New Testament at the end of Isaiah he brings in the millennium just exactly Genesis the New Testament and Revelations Percy Isaiah was one of the Major Prophets but one day he had been leaning upon the arm of Hezekiah the great king is the kind of been taken from him and he was down he was a pretty good fella he's a good righteous man if that righteous King a good King recognized him as a holy man and kept him in his Temple Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet Isaiah preached the word he was a minister Isaiah was a holy man but one day he fell into a trance and he saw the glory of God he saw the angels with wings over their face Wings over their feet fine with wings crying holy holy holy is the Lord God on my head that Prophet realized he was nothing he said woe is me for I am a man of unclean lips a prophet a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of them I am a man with unclean lips and I dwell among people it's unclean lips woe is me because I see the glory of God and he said when that angel cried the post of the temple Shook Back and Forth brother help us I will make you not only as opposed to the temple go to shake but the whole heavens and Earths go to shape the mountains of flea and the seal fade away and Extreme Hide us from the face of him that sets upon the throne it's going to be a terrible time I'll tell you Senator Fran you better be checked it up that's right now Isaiah said we'll always be I'm a man of unclean lips I'll dwell among unclean people and I'm these people as unclean Lids now remember if such holy man recognize themselves sinners in the presence of God what will the Sinner and ungodly do at that day what will people do who set in the meetings what will the people do that's seen the power of God that's heard the countdown on the word that scene God manifest himself and Beyond a shadowed doubt ever scripture fulfilled and will still try to make it to heaven without being born again and received the Holy Ghost the Bible said if a righteous man be scarcely saved where will the Sinner and ungodly appear what kind of a place are we going to stand in if we see God unfold [Applause] amen then and that kind of man cried a prophets and Sages upon whom the word is based upon if they cried and fell to their feet and screamed on a man of Unholy lips uncleanness what will it be then for that man who won't even confess his sins what will it be for that teenager that won't confess his or her sins why would it be for that hard-hearted man that thinks he knows more about uh God's creation God does himself why do I have for that man spent all of his life trying to disprove the Bible where will that God appear at think of it this is evangelism this is a time to shake people this is the time that God said there come a time he's shut Mount Sinai one time but there come is shaken again that he will only Shake Mount Sania but he'd Shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of scripture but we receive a kingdom that cannot be Hallelujah everything that can be shocked will be shaken the heavens are safe the Earth will shake heavens and earth will pass away but that word shall never pass away for all this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never be everything that can be shook will be shaken but we receive a kingdom which is a word of God himself and God is his word he don't shake himself oh my but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved it's unshakable said Paul the Hebrew writer such a person and such a man such a time and how they felt we have also ourselves we've seen the glory of God like this man did sir we've seen him we've seen the glory of God like Abraham saw it we saw the glory of God like Moses saw him same Pillar of Fire the same power of God the same Christ on revealing himself showing himself keeping his word in the last day how can we come by then him walk and treat it so lightly how can we walk around and hold our Creeds and denominations and not take the word of God Amen why will it be for us in that day how will it happen with us when we see the glory of God some people will stand off and make fun of it some will happen some will call it fanaticism some call it mental telepathy some call it Beelzebub some call it one thing or another there's the old Proverbs is fools the walk with hobnail shoes Where Angels prayer to try right the fool is set in his heart there is no God when he sees God manifested so perfectly by this own word not by a Creed but by his word and then walked right over and make fun of it he's a fool says God is the word and God made himself plain to him and he's the fool the Bible say what will it be for him when he has to stand in that place it'll be a it'll be terrible for that man in that day the ungodly repented Sinners old doesn't have any fear oh no a sinner that will repent he knows that there's a bloody sacrifice waiting is that in his way that's what gives me the consolation I've seen the glory of God I'll tell these power I know the touch of his hand I know the touch of his chastisement I know that he's gone and I know I'm undone but there's one standing on a farm says father lay all of his iniquity upon me because he stood for me down on the earth Hallelujah then I'll walk to the throne of God boldly have embraced my heart the noise not by good works but by his mercy on your face not what I can do what I could join what I could say but it's by his grace that he's saying don't worry the point that caught that screen up Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that save the rest like me once was lost but now I'm found blind but now I see how can I ever go to heaven how could you go to heaven we cannot do it we need no way for us to do it but there's one made the way and he is the way and how do we get to him by one Spirit his Spirit we're baptized into one body which will be raised up like an orbit wheeled out of the Earth repentance Sinners don't have to worry someone is there in their place oh then after we have come into His presence now and we all know we've been in his presence we've seen do things that he did when he was here on Earth how do you know the how do you know the vine you're looking at because of fruit it bears these signs shall follow them that believe yeah but we see he never did our dentist to go make denominations he never did our Davis to go make Creed but he warned us against such or whosoever shall take anything from it or add anything to it the same would be taken out of their part in The Book of Life oh we're not our game to do them but stay with that word and if a man is stand of God he'll stay with the word because God can only send by his words a stay by his word then when we come into His presence when a man once comes into the presence of God he's changed forever if there's any change in doing it now are there are those who can walk in the presence of God and pay no attention to it he wasn't ordained alive but if he was predestinated of God as soon as that first move hits he knows it that catches fire look at that little prostitute down there that day uh Samaria that woman she's in a bad shape mentally and physically we know that but as soon as she's seen that sign down the Messiah she said we know messiah's coming to do this thou must be his prophet he said I'm that Messiah that was wrote to come she recognized that she never asked one more question she started right quick with a responsibility to know that if she had found that and come into the presence of God she was responsible to tell somebody else about it Hallelujah right any man that comes into the presence of God is responsible before God from that minute on you tell somebody else look at Abraham look at Moses look at Peter look at Paul the moment they come into the presence of God recognize themselves Sinners and seal their testimony with their life look at the little lady she couldn't stay no longer she went to the city and told the man come see the man who told me the things I've done is in this Messiah they could not deny because it was scriptural certainly they said got to do it and man when we got a responsibility of telling others as Moses did as Peter did as Paul did after these things you've seen it and come into His presence you're responsible for the message to get to somebody else yes you just cannot sit still with it you must take it to someone else I never know a sister used to be your brother grandson's mother she used to sit right here in the church and she would sing I've just got over I'm running running running I just got over and I can't sit down you just found something I will go with your little colored church over here at Lowell and uh all of us stand up singing I'm running up the King's Highway just found it and took up the highway there's something about it when you find Christ you cannot hold your peace any longer the rest of your days you are a changed person for when life and life comes together it makes a bright life true when the bulb connects with the wars if it's a correct bulb it's got to give life when the current and the bulb gets together there's nothing to do but scatter life it has to do it I'm on a man or a woman is predestinated to eternal life and they see the current of God catch that bomb it'll throw light everywhere it might not be over a 10 watt but she'll scatter what life you got being a 500 watt scatter 10 watt light yeah give your life let your life so shine before man that they might see your good works and Glory Father which is in heaven yes sir when a man comes in contact with God he recognizes himself no good how can a man walk and break about how big he is what all he's done when he's nothing he's nothing to begin with one day down in Memphis Tennessee or one I don't think Memphis is one of the places there I was with Brother Davis is having a Revival that might have been Memphis and we was went to a Coliseum and had a in there another Coliseum is kind of a art gallery and they had the uh the great statues that they'd got from different parts of the earth of different Hercules and so forth and great artists of painting and then they had the analysis of a man that weighed 150 pounds you know how much he's worth 84 cents that's all he is 84 cents is all it all the chemicals you can get out of him he's just got enough White Horse to sprinkle A Hen's Nest and he's got enough just a little bit of calcium little potash it would all sell for 84 cents but we just take care of that 84 cents and baby it around there's two boys stand there and one looked together and said Jim we're not worth very much are we he said no we're not John I said but wait a minute boys you got a soul and there's worth Ten Thousand Words that's been can be Redeemed by the power of God if you just let it man when he sees these things he's responsible to tell others only story I got one life we said ten thousand if I had an eternity I'd still want to tell people about it because it's the greatest thing I ever found if you read in Ezekiel 33 33rd chapter of Ezekiel there was a Watchman set on a tower and this wasman was responsible for the entire city amen I'll wait wake yourselves to your spiritual conscience a minute while I get to this scripture that Watchman had to be a trained man he had to know what he was doing for At Any distance as soon as it arose the enemy he can detect it he could tell their March he could tell their color he could tell her where he can file just as far as the human eyes could see he could see it and he was higher than the rest of them for he was trained to know the enemy and God required the whole city at his hands Watchman water the night Hallelujah that's the way God's soldiers are today they're trained to the word what do you think Concepts polished to it and got something else is not scripture they warn their congregation amen anything is not viable anything is not it's not Godlike such as having soup suppers dances and everything else to pay off the pastors those things are wrong phone call games and card parties in the churches that's wrong and a real Watchman on the wall who's once been in the presence of God Amen if he isn't on the wall if he just throws to be on the wall the wall may not be any higher than the rest of the congregation but if he's the correct Watchman God raises he put up in the stairs that the rest of them never gets to but he watches the fly and God requires it of him the man of God who stands in the presence of God and knows God is God and know that God keeps his word and watch God perform himself and do his duty and keep his word that no matter how many organizations he knows a rank and power of the enemy amen amen he knows what to tell the congregation a real Watchman ah if we have confessed and he is that we've been in this presence and we have confessed our sins they're blotted out the book of his memory now there's nobody but God could do that now you can do anything to me I forgive you but I'll remember if I do anything to you you forgive me but you'll remember but God can forgive and forget it amen don't even remember amen that makes me feel good anymore nothing but God can do that he said he would blotted out of his book of memory I can't do it you can't do it because we've only got these little finite senses but he's infinite God he can absolutely forget that it ever was done praise God a young lady come from a country Church and her father was an old-fashioned shouting preacher or a member of the church and so she moved into the City and she got all mixed up with the women down there got to acting like they did in the Fashions and one day she's kind of Shame for her papa mama to come or a father or other mother was dead so the old man only thing you do get up for the morning it is breakfast get the Bible and read it and cry and pray and shout all day longer Up and Down the Roof and she was a little embarrassed about it so then then when they're all time through the night if he got all the Bible start reading he'd raised up out of Ben hard glory to God hallelujah Oh Glory the goddess stomping for a half and I so one day she's going to entertain her church members to a little tea party like they always have you know so she didn't know what she's gonna do with her dad after all it was her daddy so she decided she'd put him up in an attic and say daddy you don't want to be around where these women are do you know I don't even want to do that he said well we're going to have the church women up here today and we're going to have a little meeting a little prayer meeting so I I'll tell you Dad why don't you just go up in the attic I said I'll just rebound do that so she said read this nice book and she gave him a geography took his Bible away from him so he keep quiet so Lord he read the Bible Well he would go to make a lot of noise up there so he got up over him you know where he's having their party so she giving the jog if he says this is nice you should read it Daddy because it tells you all the truth about the word or said I'll be glad to read that so I said now you go up there and keep real quiet to these women and even now you come back down and then you can do whatever you want to he agreed to do it so he goes upstairs sets up there and there's all having their tea party no talking about so and so on and you know how it goes having all that big time about that time something Cut Loose upstairs all the screaming and jumping in a plaster falling yellow man running up and down to the attic just as hard as he could go jumping up and down on our glory is the God glory the god the women that know what happened after what they had upstairs so directly down the steps he come hard as he could go she said Daddy I'll give you a geography to read said yes I know it you know I said I was reading in this geography here where there's places in the sea that ain't got no bottle man and said all right over here in the Bible yesterday he said he put my sins in the sea of forgiveness glory is a God [Applause] that's [Applause] and he was shouting about it well that's right God puts our sins in the sea of forgiveness amen blocks them out and there's as if they never did happen then we stand by the grace of God through Jesus Christ Our Lord pure and holy just as holy as he was amen because he doesn't see me when I come up there he sees his own son the only way he can see can't see me because I'm any son and he only sees his son isn't that wonderful you don't have to think about sins anymore it's all gone it's under the blood yes sir don't have to worry about anymore it's all out of the and out of God's memory you don't even remember it no more Isaiah that Mighty Prophet when he confessed his sins he said woe is me for I'm a man of unclean lips a prophet I'm a man of unclean lips and my congregations unclean hey the people I preached to they're unclean I'm unclean and warns me but here comes a bunch of angels down from the glory of God Banning back to the clouds and I look up there and see strains filling the whole heaven and I'll watch these angels that's never known what sin was they never even known what sin was and there in the presence of God they've got two Wings over their faces they got two Wings over their feet and they're flying with two wings and they're crowd day and night holy holy holy is the Lord God that make you feel kind of Unholy wasn't it now what did he do he said woe is me I am when he confess these sins and said will always be the angel went over and took the tongs picked up a coal of fire which represent the Holy Ghost and Fire and come over and laid it on the prophet slips instead of cleanse you amen then the wings are winning their wave like that moved away the curtains of time and he heard God say who will go for us but after he found out that there was a way to rid sin God wanted somebody to go for him and he said Jeremiah send me he had been in the presence of God and had confessed his sins and then cleansed from his sins and was ready for service amen as the poet called that said millions now in sin and shame are dying listen to their sad and bitter cry hasten brother hasten to the rescue quickly answer Master here am I and I think of Africa India and around the world millions of heathens screaming and crying for mercy who will go not pass them attract but bring him Jesus Christ somebody in his presence thank Moses who could go down there and show them True Deliverance not make him join a church or shape hand and have a cream but bring delivers to their soul some good godly man yes Isaiah confessed his sins and was cleansed after Jacob had wrestled all night in confessing his sins give me other place to us it's called penthol p-e-n-i-t-l Dental the word people in the Hebrew means the face of almighty God Jacob the little shyster had run all his name of Jacob which means it's a planter that's deceiver had run all of his life away from God but when he got one time in the presence of God at people in the face of God he got a hold of God and it wouldn't turn him loose God we need for Jacobs he held on to the face of God in the presence of God he stayed until it was sent up God said let me go because the sun's arising and he stayed in the face of God until son up but he went away Justified and saved oh what a great thing it was now to know that he is wrestled through that's he had seen signs of God he'd had dreams about God but this is one time he was in the face of God in the presence of God think of it friends now as we hurry up in the presence of God a man's change Jacob was changed now he could walk with God yes he was a different man than what he was when he went up there the battle was now over yes sir and he began to build an altar he hadn't been used to building harder you know but I'll tell you when you come in the presence of God you want to build an altar somewhere you want to find somewhere where you can pray he built an order he was cleansed and God had won and Jacob was changed from Jacob's supplanter to Israel of Prince having power with God that's what happened to Jacob the supplanter The Deceiver the unrighteous the Unholy the deceiver deceived his brother stole the birthright says it was from his brother took a little dirty way of doing it such a deceivering he deceived his father-in-law but popper sticks made speckled calves when the cow has been pregnant he'd come there look at the Sheep but she had speckle stick mixed speckled cattle give him birthmarks deceiver deceiving his own father-in-law deceived his mother deceived his daddy deceived his brother but when he once got in the he was a shyster he was running everywhere he went always on the run from God he's on the run from his brother but when he come into the presence of God he recognized he was a sinner what did he do what did he do he seen his opportunity he had met something that he didn't even think about before and he stayed there until all sins was gone oh man God got him in his own presence God manages a way to get man in their presence and to make their decision some of them run from him some run to him if they're predestinated to life they believe it they hang on to it if they're not they try to get away and says nothing to it see and that's the god that's lost the god that confesses his sin shall have pardon if you hide your sin you'll not prospered no so Jacob when he it was the next day he met Esau his brother he didn't need no help from him he didn't need his armies he is this is building orders he wasn't afraid of he saw no more Psalms 16 8. David said I have set the Lord before me that's a good thing to do Psalm 16 8 I set the Lord before me so he could not be confused about it uh he wanted to be conscious of his presence so David said I have set the lord always before my face now I David have set the Lord before my face always to be conscious conscious of God's presence wouldn't that be a good lesson for all of us tonight amen said the Lord before a face so we'll be conscious of his presence buddy him first why but he first before you why then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God when you realize God's around you watch what you say a man when he thinks God's gone he'll cuss he'll lust after women he'll do you steal he'll do anything when he thinks that God don't see him but bring him into the presence of God you stop it right now and David said I have put the lord always before me that's a good thing the water of God said he's man after his own heart man will do everything when he thinks that God is near but when he realizes that God's near do you ever know it's a sinner let a Godly person walk up he'll quit he's cursing yeah he's got any respects at all he won't tell the dirty jokes that he would have told see he you leave off that because he knows that he's in the presence of God because God dwells in the Tabernacle of his people see after David did this he said my heart shall rejoice I wish you read Psalm 16. my heart will rejoice and my flesh shall Rest In Hope why my heart shall rejoice because of God God before me all the time yeah and my flesh shall rest and hope if I die I'll be raised up again or he'll not suffer his holy one and see corruption neither will it be stolen hell amen see when David put God before him and was conscious that constantly he was in the presence of God seek ye first the kingdom of God now listen church I love you and I want you to listen to me now is brother McCullough you say I'm going to say something always put the Lord before you and don't you do nothing that you wouldn't do in his presence because he's watching over you see the Lord is encamped about those who fear Him he don't he just stays right near you and he knows everything you're doing and you must recognize that when you start to tell her I don't do it remember God's listening at you if you start to do a little cheat don't you do it God's looking at you if you start to take his name in vain don't do it God's listening at you start smoking cigarette he's watching you you his we used to sing a song All Along on the road to the souls to Abode there's an eye watching you every step that you take this great eye is awake there's an eye watching you remember do like David put the lord always before your face then your heart will rejoice and your flesh shall Rest In Hope for he promised it yesterday he knew that he had raised up because God had promised it all right when we come into His presence we're changed never to be the same look all down to the ages of every Walk of Life man look at Abraham you say well the changed life is just for ministers oh no the change lives for everybody now Abraham was a farmer but when he heard God's voice speaking to him and saw that Vision he was a changed man from that time on he separated himself from his Kindred from all his associates and walked as a pilgrim in a Stranger in a Strange Land the rest of his life dwelling intense because he clearly confessed that he was seeking the city he was Builder and maker was God he know there was a God and there was a city somewhere whose Builder and maker was God that's what Hebrews 11 tells us that he's seeking a city as Builder and maker was God he was a changed man yet he was nothing but a mere farmer but he saw a vision and come into the presence of God and he was a changed man from then on Moses he was a shepherd but he was a changed man when he come into the presence of God he was a coward he was running from Pharaoh with the whole Army behind him but with a stick in his hand he went back and took the whole nation why he come into the presence of God he was a changed man a Shepherd Peter a fisherman know nothing about fishing or know nothing about God only thing he probably know was how to catch fish but when he'd come in the presence of God and see the great Creator who could create fish when he told him let down the net for the draw there wasn't any fish there he just pulled his Nets up but he said that's Thy word Lord I believe that you're the Son of God and if you let a violet on that you told me to do it at your word because you and your word are the same I'll let down the mess and when he began to pull he's depart Lord I'm a sinful man a fisherman after Peterman Christ he was never the same anymore the answer words was so true to God he was given the keys to the kingdom yes sir Paul a self-style Pharisee educated and trained in all the religion of the that there was in the world in that day one of the highest known scholars in the land but when he come before that Pillar of Fire one day the God that he had persecuted eagerly he was the Pharisee he didn't believe that God was the man he know God was a pillar of fire it led his people out of Egypt he had been with them all alone but when he saw this Pillar of Fire he fell on his face and he heard a voice saying so I persecuted Sal means that who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus Hallelujah he was the man I said how have you been baptized he had been the presence of God he was a changed man for now you've been the presence of God it changes a man Charles G Finney a lawyer a great uh Philadelphia lawyer but when he come into the presence of God he dropped his law of study and become a mightiest preacher of this nation's ever had yet was a preacher because one day he'd come in the presence of God he thought once the instead of Industry you know his book I got his autobiography he went out to pray he thought he was a preacher he had a desire that he wanted to preach and he had him a few sermons to try to preach he went out one day out of his office to pray went out in the woods he got down behind an old blowing down tree where you go every afternoon very religious but he didn't believe in that there's two women in the church kept saying Mr Finney we're praying that you received the Holy Ghost but I'm a preacher the Mississippi you're a great man and you've got a great hold of the word but you need the Holy Ghost we're praying for you sweet little women so he went on oh so every day he'd go out behind his office his boss and all up in there he worked and he go out of his law office to go out there to pray and one day he was out there pre and he heard a brush free he thought his boss was coming up hunting him he jumped up real quick he said Lord God I believe he inside brush spoke of God raised up looked around see where it was broke the brush That Was Then he come in the presence of God he realized that breast should broke for a purpose you stood there the tears running on his cheeks he said maybe that women's right I'm ashamed for somebody to see me talking to my God but I think it was an honor for somebody to see me talking to my boss how much greater is my Lord than my boss the Lord forgive his fill me with the Holy Ghost started screaming and shouting is in the presence of God you run downtown real quick to his office he got screaming so hard he had to go behind the door said Lord I'll bring this grace to follow to him hide me back here until get over this spell huh he'd come in the Praises of God he was a changed man the sermons that he used to preach he preached them same sermons and souls came to the altar amen see he had been the presence of God Moody hardly know his ABCs that's right his grammar was poor somebody told him Monday your grammar's off a poor Mr Moody he said but I'm winning Souls with it so one day in the newspaper is the editor went to as writing a newspaper he went over to see how could this man hold crowds of people under any conditions little old guy bald-headed and everything and had Whiskers hanging way down kind of plot-bellied

whiskers come down to his waistline he's as bald headed as a pumpkin and said how in the world would anybody ever go to see anything in Moody so Moody's manager hadn't seen so look Mr Moody I'll read this to you booty couldn't read it himself so I said I'll reach you the editorial and he wrote it Moody just shoved his sources certainly not to come to see Christ he had been in the presence of God from making Souls on shoes for people who were out he shot the people with the gospel of preparation the presence of God right a little woman one time come in the presence of God as guilty as she could be at a moment when she realized that she was in the presence of God ever sin was forgiven and she was as pure and white as a lily oh my how many more I could call off here of people time

bootleggers and you know that every one of you know it you know what kind of name we had here people didn't speak to us on the street I go downtown start to talk to somebody nobody talked to me unless somebody wasn't around to talk to me somebody else came up to leave me and I'd stand there and crying no this is so it can't be so this is wrong but one day I come into the presence of God he changed me made me another kind of sound his grace brought me into his presence I've never wanted to leave it I've been in here now 30 some odd years I don't want to leave it I've got this sure so I'll always be there even death itself will never separate me from his presence no I'll be with him forever when I see his presence the first time I cried like Isaiah Wars me then he touched me with his grace

had ten thousand more lives to give for him this is getting pretty well wore out now 53 years has passed about 33 of those have been 32 of those has been in the gospel I wish I had another thousand if I could spend why why once then to his presence and realized that there was somebody who loved the unlovable there's somebody loving when no one else did there was somebody who cared for me when no one else cared I put my arms around this cross I embraced it to me and made him become one man and from then on I've loved him he stained my bosom in my heart with his blood by touching me and

for you know that Christ promised it raise up again in the last days when he comes forth we'll come in his likeness once you do it now while we pray our heavenly father a little chopped up message by a tired weary servant but just thinking on the subject of dwelling in the presence of God and we see tonight the effect that is taken upon holy man to come into your presence what effect it had upon Him Sages great powerful Prophets ordained by God and said to preach the word and yet meeting face to face and fall to the ground like a dead man what are we going to do it that day Lord we thought it over we've been thinking it some 40 or 50 hands has been thinking it Lord for they just raise them hands or Hearts beneath the hands has been thinking about meeting him since we've been speaking what would they do if they had to meet him my hands Lords up what will I do now father I've got many things that I do wrong I've just confessed my sin this morning before the church as I confessed with you on top of the mountain the other morning when it was blowing and snowing and up there on top of the mountain the high cried out and asked you to forgive me for my stupidity and how I dreaded to come before my brother who some of them regard me as your Prophet servant and Lord how I hated to come to for them and tell them of a stupid act that I would do a thing like that but God is good for my soul that I confess my sins and not hide them so to be honest with you and right before the people I have confessed it Lord I'm wrong I'm all together wrong I pray forgiveness and then father I've been dilatory about you serving him many times maybe I could have went longer when I Didn't Do It father I confess my sins I want the angel of God to cleanse me from that of the blood of Jesus other hands went up tonight some of them maybe has never asked forgiveness before but I'm sure of this one thing if we'll confess our sins God will block them out put them in the sea of forgiveness and never remember no more and fathers I confess mine about misbehaving before them people I didn't carry on myself like a servant of Christ I didn't I afraid that man might be angry with me and think I didn't want to hurt his feelings but I didn't think of what I was doing to you Lord and I I prayed that you forgive me and now father I know that if I ask forgiveness I have forgiveness and you put him in a sea of forgiveness and you'll never remember that no more God I'm thankful for that and I pray that you'll let every person here that has sin or besetting sin of anything before them may they remove it and put the Lord before them like David did for now we cry woe is me for I have seen the glory of God I'm a man of unclean lips or a woman or girl of unclean lips boy or something whatever we might be we're unclean and we ask for the blood of Jesus Christ the appropriated sacrifice that cleanse us from all sin that we might ever dwell in his presence let us go from here tonight with our hearts rejoicing and our flesh resting in Hope knowing this that when Jesus does come we'll be raised with him in his likeness and shall meet him in the air in the Rapture when the countdown is finally over we see the seventh Church age is already counted out and we're ready now to take off we pray God that you before you close the door if there be one year tonight has never come in may they
