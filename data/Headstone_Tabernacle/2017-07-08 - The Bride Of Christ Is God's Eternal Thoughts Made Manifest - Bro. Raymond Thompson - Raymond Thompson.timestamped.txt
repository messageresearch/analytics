[46:23] Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:27] Praise
[46:28] God. So, uh, if you have your
[46:37] Bibles, three portions of scripture,
[46:39] short ones.
[46:41] Psalms
[46:42] 1339:17 and 18. Psalms 40 verse 5 and
[46:47] Jeremiah 29 and verse
[46:56] 11. If you have Psalms 139:17 and
[47:00] 18, it reads, "How precious are thy
[47:04] thoughts unto me, oh God.
[47:08] How great is the sum of them.
[47:11] If I should count them, they are more in
[47:14] number than the sand.
[47:17] When I awake, I am still with thee.
[47:21] Hallelujah.
[47:24] My hallelujah. Isn't that beautiful?
[47:27] Amen. My And then Psalms
[47:33] 40:5 it says, "Many, oh Lord, my God,
[47:36] are thy wonderful works which thou has
[47:38] done, and thy thoughts which are to
[47:42] usward, they cannot be reckoned up in
[47:46] order unto thee. If I will declare and
[47:49] speak of them, they are more than can be
[47:53] numbered."
[47:54] My that's the thoughts of God.
[47:58] What he thinks of us, it's more than can
[48:01] be numbered.
[48:03] In
[48:05] Jeremiah, now this one I like. Verse
[48:10] 11, if you have it, Jeremiah 29 verse
[48:20] 11. Listen to what it says here.
[48:23] For I know the thoughts that I think
[48:28] toward you, sayeth the Lord. Amen.
[48:31] Thoughts of peace and not of evil. Amen.
[48:36] To give you an expected end. Amen. Can I
[48:40] read it again?
[48:42] For I know the thoughts that I think
[48:45] toward you. So God is trying to get you
[48:48] to see what he thinks of you.
[48:51] Not someone else. what he thinks of you.
[48:53] Amen.
[48:55] Say the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not
[48:58] of evil to give you an expected end.
[49:02] Hallelujah. May God add a blessing to
[49:04] the read his word. You may be seated.
[49:06] Amen.
[49:09] Hallelujah.
[49:12] Hallelujah.
[49:15] So tonight I like to take a title. The
[49:18] bride of Christ is God's etern eternal
[49:21] thoughts made manifest.
[49:23] [Music]
[49:25] Hallelujah. The word eternal.
[49:29] My subject, you were always sons.
[49:32] You did not become a son. You were
[49:35] always a son. And then my inspiration,
[49:38] God is going to give to you an expected
[49:41] end.
[49:42] [Applause]
[49:49] So, tonight we we I want to speak of the
[49:52] bride's pre-existence.
[49:57] You come from You're not just from here.
[50:00] Brother Isaac said, "We're not from
[50:02] Nigeria. We're not from Trinidad.
[50:05] You existed somewhere before."
[50:08] Wonderful.
[50:10] and
[50:12] uh you were there somewhere and Bible
[50:15] says somehow in your human mind you
[50:17] cannot remember it
[50:20] but somehow uh God sent a prophet in
[50:22] this day and I love this. He he went so
[50:26] high
[50:27] that he he broke into the mind of God
[50:32] and caught the thoughts that was in the
[50:35] mind of God and pulled it down.
[50:39] and then came and revealed it to the
[50:43] bride.
[50:44] Now I have a revelation
[50:47] that I was somewhere else. How did I
[50:49] know that? God sent us a prophet with
[50:52] thus say the Lord that went so high
[50:55] brother that he could catch the thoughts
[50:57] of God. And today when it's been
[51:00] preached, that's the very mind of God
[51:05] that you sitting with in your lap that
[51:07] you have on your shelves. The tapes that
[51:10] you are listening to is the very mind of
[51:12] God. So we know now what God thought for
[51:17] this day. We have a revelation what God
[51:21] thought for this day, brother.
[51:23] Hallelujah.
[51:25] So I'm going to do Can I float on the
[51:27] quotes a bit? It says here before it
[51:30] could be a word spoken, it has to be a
[51:33] thought. And because a word is a thought
[51:36] made manifest when God speaks. Now back
[51:38] in the beginning when God looked down
[51:40] through the corridors of heaven, he saw
[51:42] all things that were going to happen on
[51:44] earth. Did you ever just sit and draw a
[51:47] picture in your mind, an idea, opinion?
[51:50] Now that's the way God did it. Perhaps
[51:52] in the beginning, then he see it seemed
[51:54] good. So watch. Now he spoke it.
[51:58] And as soon as it was spoken, it become
[52:02] a word.
[52:05] The thought was expressed.
[52:07] His thought and makes it a word. Amen.
[52:11] And he says once it is spoken, he can
[52:14] never take it back again.
[52:19] Hallelujah, brother. So once God speaks
[52:21] that word,
[52:23] that word can never be taken back again.
[52:25] Why? It's already spoken.
[52:28] Woo. Hallelujah. The devil's in trouble,
[52:30] brother. He thinks he got you. But
[52:32] you're going to find out God has a
[52:34] different plan for your life and for you
[52:37] and your situation. Uh he has thoughts
[52:39] about you that that that never mind what
[52:42] someone else thinks about you. I don't
[52:45] care what anyone thinks about me, what
[52:47] they say about me. I'm not going to
[52:49] become a product of some man's opinion,
[52:53] but I want to know what God thinks about
[52:55] me, what God says about me, what his
[52:58] thoughts about me. That's what I'm
[53:00] looking. And you must never become a
[53:04] product of some man's
[53:07] opinion. Never allow that. Don't let the
[53:10] devil even put something on you and say
[53:13] you nothing. He's a liar. God says, "The
[53:16] thoughts I have about you are not evil.
[53:19] It's peace." Hallelujah. And it's good.
[53:25] [Applause]
[53:30] My He says he can never take it back.
[53:34] He says, "Let me inject a thought in
[53:37] here. Even your natural birth is based
[53:39] upon election."
[53:41] Now you think you think this is a
[53:44] mystery to be saved in this day and be
[53:46] in the message. He says your natural
[53:48] birth was based on election. And it's a
[53:52] mixed audience. But he says the female
[53:55] ovaries produce so many eggs. But why is
[53:57] it that at a certain time a certain egg
[53:59] comes down and not another one and then
[54:01] amongst the male sperm? For we we for no
[54:05] known reason a certain germ attaches
[54:08] itself to the egg while others that
[54:10] could have just as easily attached
[54:12] themselves or had a better opportunity
[54:15] to do so but they did not it perished.
[54:20] There is an intelligence behind all of
[54:22] this. Otherwise what determines whether
[54:25] the baby is a boy, whether it's a girl,
[54:27] a blonde, a brunette, light dark boy. He
[54:30] says there's an intelligence.
[54:32] Now I and I wrote here, no, your natural
[54:36] birth was not an accident.
[54:41] And you're going to see it. You're not
[54:43] here by mistake.
[54:45] Hallelujah. So you in the natural were
[54:48] an overcomer. There was many other
[54:50] germs, but you in the natural, your
[54:52] natural birth, you swam, brother. There
[54:55] was something in you, an intelligence
[54:58] behind and you swam there. and brother
[55:01] millions of sperm but you
[55:05] hooked hallelujah you hooked brother to
[55:08] the egg and here you are today you think
[55:11] that's a mistake
[55:13] hallelujah don't make
[55:15] mistakes you're here for a purpose you
[55:18] here for a specific
[55:22] purpose I feel a shout coming on brother
[55:25] hallelujah so you mean brother Amon in
[55:28] the natural I'm already an overcomer
[55:30] Now what about your spiritual birth?
[55:33] Come on now brother. Brother brother
[55:34] brother it says there was many others
[55:36] who had an opportunity but they didn't
[55:39] do it. They died but you brother
[55:43] Hallelujah. You had victory in you
[55:45] already. You had power in you already.
[55:48] You had anointing already. Why? To
[55:51] overcome in the natural.
[55:54] How much more the spiritual
[55:56] birth?
[56:02] Those who are the royal seed are the
[56:05] elect of God are the predestinated
[56:07] brother Peter fornown of God and were in
[56:10] the mind of God and in his thoughts. Now
[56:12] I want you to see we speaking of where
[56:14] we were before we even came here. So we
[56:18] were in the mind of God his thoughts.
[56:20] Glory in very plain language. The true
[56:22] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[56:25] eternally. Glory. Glory. Glory. though
[56:27] not expressed until each came forth in
[56:30] the designated decreed season.
[56:35] So God knew, that's why I say, please
[56:38] stay with me. You're going to see you're
[56:39] not here by mistake. It says the true
[56:42] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[56:45] eternally,
[56:47] though not expressed until each came
[56:49] forth in the designated decreed season.
[56:53] You could not come in Luther's day. You
[56:56] could not come in Wesley's day but this
[56:58] decreed season on the 8th day holy
[57:01] convocation you had to be here brother
[57:04] there somebody has to be here to bring
[57:07] on this
[57:09] revival. Hallelujah.
[57:14] My he says though not expressed until
[57:17] each came forth in the desert season and
[57:20] each member came forth it became
[57:22] expressed and took its place in the
[57:24] body. Hallelujah. Thus the bride watch
[57:27] is the literal spoken word seed bride.
[57:35] Now brother this is not small words man.
[57:38] This was this was in where the the
[57:41] process he picked up his pen and write.
[57:43] So it wasn't him. So when he wrote this
[57:46] was part of it. The bride this bride is
[57:50] the literal spoken word. See bride.
[57:54] So don't look at yourself as a nothing.
[57:57] Don't sell yourself short. You're the
[57:59] literal spoken word. See bride.
[58:03] And that's why the devil fight you
[58:05] because he knows there's a seed inside
[58:07] of you. But brother, he will not
[58:10] prevail. You have a revelation. You have
[58:13] something in you that
[58:17] overcomes.
[58:18] Hallelujah. Did you hear that? Literal
[58:22] literal spoken word with sea bride. My
[58:25] and though she's feminist feminine in
[58:28] designation, she's also called the body
[58:30] of Christ. It is very apparent that she
[58:33] ought to be called that for she was
[58:34] predestinated
[58:36] in him came from the same source was
[58:39] eternal with him what eternal with him
[58:44] and is now manifested in a many membered
[58:46] body whereas once God was manifested in
[58:50] one member in our Lord Jesus Christ and
[58:53] that eternal one was the father
[58:54] manifested in flesh and thereby gained
[58:57] the title of son. Watch now. He gained
[58:59] the title of son. He says even so we
[59:04] eternally in his thoughts in our turn.
[59:10] My God. In whose turn? In our turn. So
[59:13] the prophet knew there's coming our
[59:15] turn. Hallelujah. Luther had his turn.
[59:18] Wesley had his turn. The Pentecostals
[59:20] had this. So did Malachi 4. But what
[59:23] about our turn, brother? There's got to
[59:26] be a people in the land in our turn.
[59:35] So even so eternal in his thoughts in
[59:37] our turn become the many membered spoken
[59:40] word seed manifested in flesh
[59:45] and those eternal thoughts now
[59:47] manifested in flesh are the sons of God
[59:50] even as we are so called. Amen. So now
[59:54] you come into a body of flesh. You were
[59:56] eternal. But now you come into the body
[59:58] of flesh. Now you're here on the earth.
[1:00:01] You're going through situations you
[1:00:03] can't understand. But remember, you were
[1:00:05] already eternal.
[1:00:08] Amen. Brother Isaac, we speaking to
[1:00:09] eighth day.
[1:00:11] Hallelujah. People that come from
[1:00:14] eternity. So this shouldn't be a mystery
[1:00:19] because you're not in the seven days
[1:00:21] anymore.
[1:00:22] Now you ced are back into eternity. Like
[1:00:26] brother said, we're pushing you back up,
[1:00:27] man. You You're not You're not down
[1:00:30] there. We're pushing you back into
[1:00:31] eternity now. Come on. You got to be
[1:00:34] there. If you stay down here, you're
[1:00:36] going to be all muddled up. You're going
[1:00:38] to be messed up, brother. But now, we're
[1:00:40] pushing you up and we're getting you
[1:00:41] there. Where you were before, where you
[1:00:45] will always be. And you're going right
[1:00:48] back there. Hallelujah. And that's why
[1:00:50] the Holy Spirit has brought you here to
[1:00:52] anoint you and push you back there
[1:00:54] again. Woo! I feel the anointing
[1:00:57] tonight, brother. I feel the spirit
[1:00:59] speaking to somebody to say, "Come on,
[1:01:03] get shake yourself. Get out of that
[1:01:05] state of laziness and complacency." And
[1:01:08] say, "Lord, I'm hungry for the Holy
[1:01:11] Spirit. I want to get back to where I
[1:01:13] was. I want to be anointed. I don't want
[1:01:16] to be just complacent and be a church
[1:01:18] member. I want to be a son and a
[1:01:20] daughter of God.
[1:01:31] My we did not become seed by the
[1:01:34] rebirth. We were seed
[1:01:37] and therefore we reborn for only the
[1:01:40] elect
[1:01:41] can be reborn
[1:01:44] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:01:46] could be quickened in none seed there is
[1:01:49] nothing to quicken so you'll think the
[1:01:52] whole world will embrace this message
[1:01:54] but you find it's not like that there's
[1:01:56] nothing in them to quicken
[1:01:59] but when you heard it brother yeah
[1:02:02] something stimulated in your man You
[1:02:04] picked up that first spoken word. You
[1:02:07] You listen to the first tape and
[1:02:09] something quickened in your heart. Why?
[1:02:11] If it was the seed of God in your heart
[1:02:14] and here comes the spirit of God, it
[1:02:16] quickens the seed and it made you alive.
[1:02:20] Hallelujah. So the devil can't take that
[1:02:22] away from you. I don't care how many
[1:02:24] mistakes you made. I don't care how low
[1:02:27] down you fell. There's a seed in your
[1:02:29] heart. And that is what the Holy Spirit
[1:02:32] comes for.
[1:02:36] Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:02:38] Hallelujah.
[1:02:40] My God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] My He says Jesus bought back his own.
[1:02:49] Listen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:51] Hold this carefully in mind. Take the
[1:02:54] next step. Redeem means to buy back. It
[1:02:58] restores to the original owner. God by
[1:03:01] his death, the shed blood, bought back
[1:03:03] his own. Amen. He brought back the
[1:03:06] spoken word, seed bride. My sheep hear
[1:03:10] my voice, the word, and they follow me.
[1:03:13] You were always the sheep. You were
[1:03:15] never a pig or a dog turned into a
[1:03:17] sheep. You were always the sheep.
[1:03:22] You mean brother, I always was a sheep
[1:03:24] in my heart. Though I was in the shines
[1:03:27] and it was in all the ungodly places,
[1:03:29] wherever you went, there was a seed in
[1:03:32] your heart. You were never a pig or you
[1:03:35] were never a dog. You were a sheep,
[1:03:37] brother. And my sheep will hear my
[1:03:40] voice. Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Oh, praise God.
[1:03:48] [Applause]
[1:03:53] Okay. Thank you. So Jesus had to pay the
[1:03:56] price to die. He had to die. And he
[1:04:00] bought back his own by his blood
[1:04:02] redeemed the spoken with seed bride
[1:04:04] because Satan would have held it against
[1:04:06] him and against us. That's right. But
[1:04:08] now we can point back and say but that
[1:04:10] day he paid the price.
[1:04:13] And why did he die? Brother was saying
[1:04:16] that little uh circle and there was a
[1:04:19] hickey. But that he was when he came
[1:04:22] down and and to redeem us. That's the
[1:04:26] only reason he died. He came because
[1:04:29] someone had to pay the price.
[1:04:32] And then uh God looked down and the
[1:04:35] Adam's human race was in chaos. No one
[1:04:38] could redeem her. And God says, "Man,
[1:04:41] listen. Those are my thoughts though.
[1:04:44] They were in my mind. How are they a
[1:04:47] part of me? I'm going down to the earth.
[1:04:50] I'm going to take on a body of flesh.
[1:04:53] And when they nailed him to the cross.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. He had you and me on his
[1:04:57] mind. And he paid the price, brother.
[1:05:00] And here we are tonight. We are shocked
[1:05:02] in the victory. We are praising God.
[1:05:05] Why? We can tell the devil the price was
[1:05:08] paid.
[1:05:10] You can point back Satan the price was
[1:05:12] paid. The blood has accomplished the the
[1:05:16] work.
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] My my my It's time you preach back to
[1:05:22] the devil, man. Say that on Calvary was
[1:05:25] for me.
[1:05:27] Hallelujah. It was for Raymond Thompson.
[1:05:30] It was for Jesse Bledo. It was for Isaac
[1:05:33] over. It was for you. You put your own
[1:05:35] name in there. That day he died for me.
[1:05:39] And Satan can no more put anything on
[1:05:42] you because that day the price was paid.
[1:05:44] and he died to redeem back.
[1:05:48] And he says redeem is to bring it back
[1:05:50] to the original owner.
[1:05:52] [Applause]
[1:05:54] So you're not in the hands of a man.
[1:05:56] You're not in the hands of a group.
[1:05:58] You're not in the hands of any church.
[1:06:00] We are not under a banner of any. No, we
[1:06:03] under the banner of Jesus Christ. And
[1:06:05] you redeem back to God's
[1:06:10] hands. Shake off any spirit, brother.
[1:06:13] Shake off anything that's hanging on
[1:06:15] you. Shake it
[1:06:17] off. Be like Paul. When the when the
[1:06:19] serpent bit him, it hung on his hand.
[1:06:22] What did Paul do? Shook it off. Shake it
[1:06:26] off into the fire. The fire of God is
[1:06:28] here. Shake it off. Any problem, every
[1:06:32] sinner, every unbelief, shake it off.
[1:06:36] But they said that about me, shake it
[1:06:38] off. They said that about you. Shake it
[1:06:41] off.
[1:06:42] Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] Come on, young people. Shake it off.
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:06:57] [Applause]
[1:06:59] My
[1:07:00] Now we can point back to the day of
[1:07:02] Calvary. Jesus paid it all. Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] Not just part payment, but full payment.
[1:07:10] Full payment.
[1:07:12] paid in full.
[1:07:14] Hallelujah. Paid in full.
[1:07:18] My He says here and brother Peter spoke
[1:07:21] of the little eagle. It says here, but
[1:07:23] when when he heard the call of the great
[1:07:25] eagle, he came to his own place. He was
[1:07:29] in a chicken, remember? But he heard
[1:07:31] mama eagle. And once a true son of God
[1:07:34] hears the cry of the spirit by the word,
[1:07:38] he too will realize who he is. and run
[1:07:41] to the great prophet eagle and be with
[1:07:43] him forever more seated in heavenly
[1:07:46] places in Christ Jesus. Then he says,
[1:07:50] "Then after you recognize the very word
[1:07:52] of God was eagle food, then you left the
[1:07:55] other thing."
[1:07:57] Now I like this man. When you heard the
[1:08:00] message, you left the other thing. You
[1:08:02] ran for your life. You saw they false.
[1:08:05] You saw they they're not true. You
[1:08:07] heard. He says you recognize the very
[1:08:09] word was eagle food. Then you left the
[1:08:12] other thing. He says right there you
[1:08:15] heard from your theophony.
[1:08:21] Oh, you mean brother Raymond, the day I
[1:08:23] heard it, that was my theophony speaking
[1:08:25] back to me. I heard and he pulled me out
[1:08:27] of there. Brother, you better believe
[1:08:29] it. You got your own theophony. You're
[1:08:32] not born from some minister's theophony.
[1:08:35] You're not born from no organization.
[1:08:37] You born from your own
[1:08:39] theophony. Hallelujah. the the thing you
[1:08:42] bypass came and called you and you saw
[1:08:45] it and you ran for your
[1:08:48] life and we still
[1:08:51] running. Glory be to God. We running
[1:08:54] from every force. We running from every
[1:08:57] interpretation. We running by the why we
[1:08:59] heard from our theophony.
[1:09:02] [Applause]
[1:09:08] Galatians
[1:09:09] 4:4-7. And because he has sons, God has
[1:09:12] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:09:14] your hearts, crying, aba father,
[1:09:16] wherefore thou are no more a servant but
[1:09:19] a son.
[1:09:21] And I think too many of us still look at
[1:09:23] us as servants.
[1:09:25] And B says a servant, he he he works and
[1:09:28] he gets his wages. All right. He gets
[1:09:32] his reward. All right. But he says a son
[1:09:39] a son is a person who's in authority
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:44] because he comes from his father. Now we
[1:09:47] were always sons.
[1:09:50] We come from where? Our heavenly father.
[1:09:53] So we not servants man. We are sons.
[1:09:56] Speak the word.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah. Speak the word. But a son,
[1:10:01] he says, and if a son then an heir of of
[1:10:04] God through Christ, there it is. Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ came forth, died upon the cross,
[1:10:08] accomplished redemption, restoring to
[1:10:11] the original owner by means of purchase
[1:10:12] and paying the price. Uh thereby placed
[1:10:15] us as sons. He did not make us sons.
[1:10:18] That's why my my subject is you are
[1:10:20] always sons.
[1:10:23] Listen what it says. He did not make us
[1:10:25] sons for we were already his sons. But
[1:10:29] he placed us as sons. So brother, you
[1:10:32] were always a son. Sister, you were
[1:10:34] always a daughter of God. You didn't
[1:10:36] become the day you gave your heart to
[1:10:37] the Lord, the day you met the mercy. No,
[1:10:40] you were always a son. And I'm speaking
[1:10:42] to the eighth day people. They will
[1:10:44] recognize this that this sounds
[1:10:46] familiar, man. I was somewhere
[1:10:51] before. Hallelujah. That's why Jesus
[1:10:53] prayed in John 17. He says, "Father, I
[1:10:56] do not pray for the world, but I pray
[1:10:58] for them that's they in the world, but
[1:11:00] they're not of the world. But I pray,
[1:11:02] Lord, that you keep them while they're
[1:11:04] in the world." He says you had glory
[1:11:07] with him before the foundation of the
[1:11:09] world. You were
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:14] there. Hallelujah. And because he has
[1:11:17] sons, God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:11:19] his son into into your hearts whereby
[1:11:21] you cry, "Father, father." Hallelujah.
[1:11:24] Upon whom did the spirit fall in
[1:11:26] Pentecost? Sons. Who did it fall on on
[1:11:28] in Corinth? Upon sons while they heard
[1:11:31] the word, he says here, "What is the
[1:11:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost?" It is the
[1:11:35] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[1:11:38] Christ. It is the new birth. It is the
[1:11:40] spirit of God coming in and filling you
[1:11:43] after you have repented, have heard the
[1:11:45] word and been baptized in water as an
[1:11:48] answer to good conscience towards God.
[1:11:50] But now the Holy Spirit, that's why I
[1:11:53] don't know who said it. One of the
[1:11:54] ministers said the question should be
[1:11:56] asked, have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:11:59] since you believed?
[1:12:03] And and and many hasn't gone that far.
[1:12:06] They're just happy to be in the message,
[1:12:08] just happy to be in the church. But
[1:12:11] brother, we should be hungering for the
[1:12:13] filling of the Holy Spirit day and night
[1:12:17] coming in here. Lord, fill me. That's my
[1:12:20] desire to be anointed to be filled with
[1:12:22] the Holy Spirit. Ministers should be so
[1:12:25] burdened preaching the Holy Ghost,
[1:12:28] making sure the people, brother, listen,
[1:12:30] man, that's our burden. That's brother
[1:12:32] Theo's burden. That's why this holy
[1:12:34] convocation is called. Why? for the
[1:12:36] outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the
[1:12:39] people. Young people, you're not going
[1:12:41] to make it out there without the Holy
[1:12:43] Spirit. The only thing that will keep
[1:12:45] you is the Holy
[1:12:47] Spirit. Hallelujah. One one man asked
[1:12:50] Brother Brenham, he says, "I have two
[1:12:52] children. They 16 and 17." He says, "How
[1:12:56] can I make them stay in the message or
[1:12:58] stay in the church?" He says, "There's
[1:13:00] no way they can make it. Only by the
[1:13:02] Holy Ghost."
[1:13:04] Oh hallelujah. And the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:06] here tonight. And the Holy Ghost is in
[1:13:08] this meetings. You don't walk from here
[1:13:11] without being filled. It will be upon
[1:13:13] your own head. But tonight, you're going
[1:13:15] to find out you ordained
[1:13:17] to receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:31] So don't be just Don't just be satisfied
[1:13:34] with the first experience.
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:39] Man, I don't know if I must say it.
[1:13:41] Listen, man. He says, "I He take away
[1:13:43] the stony heart. I'll give you a new
[1:13:45] heart." He says, "And then I'll give you
[1:13:47] a new spirit." He says, "Many people
[1:13:49] misunderstand that they think they have
[1:13:52] the Holy Ghost, but they only have a new
[1:13:53] spirit."
[1:13:56] Amen. He said, "But then I'll put my
[1:13:58] spirit in that spirit." Woo. That's
[1:14:01] where you got to go, brother. That's
[1:14:02] where you where you enter the Holy of
[1:14:04] Holies, where the Holy Spirit draws you
[1:14:07] right into the inner court and he places
[1:14:10] you right in there and fills you with
[1:14:11] the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:17] My but see all that is displaying
[1:14:20] showing by type like the whole Bible.
[1:14:22] God coming together with a redeemed
[1:14:24] wife. Amen. Amen. It says here a pride
[1:14:27] that God had in his mind. Now watch
[1:14:30] this. So when it comes to the bride,
[1:14:33] it's got to do with God. It's got
[1:14:36] nothing to do with a minister. Nothing
[1:14:38] to do with a group. Got nothing to do
[1:14:41] with a five-fold. That's right. What
[1:14:47] God coming together with a redeemed
[1:14:49] wife, a bride that God had in his mind
[1:14:53] before the foundation world. That was
[1:14:54] the attribute of God being displayed.
[1:14:57] And now to make a character that would
[1:15:00] redeem this woman. It had to be
[1:15:03] something greater than her to redeem
[1:15:05] her.
[1:15:07] So God has in his mind how this bride
[1:15:09] must look, but it had to be a greater
[1:15:11] character.
[1:15:13] So you see uh God is uh you can't go in
[1:15:16] on your own merits. Please man, you
[1:15:19] can't go in on your good self and and uh
[1:15:21] how good I am and no. This has got to do
[1:15:25] with redemption.
[1:15:27] and he's choosing. So he took a greater
[1:15:30] character than us
[1:15:33] to redeem us. Glory, glory, glory,
[1:15:36] glory. He says uh
[1:15:40] if he is the redeemer, he comes to
[1:15:42] redeem it is to pick up that which is
[1:15:44] fallen. That's right. To redeem back to
[1:15:47] the place where it was at the beginning.
[1:15:51] So are you hearing me? Mean the prophet
[1:15:54] said this. This is the thoughts of God
[1:15:56] now. Amen. So none will be picked up but
[1:15:58] them that was in the thoughts at the
[1:16:00] beginning. He come to redeem not the
[1:16:02] canon foder that we see around
[1:16:04] professing to be Christians but uh that
[1:16:06] he come to redeem. That was his
[1:16:09] attributes made flesh and redeemable.
[1:16:13] So the minute you come into a body of
[1:16:15] flesh you become redeemable.
[1:16:19] That's why the Holy Spirit process one
[1:16:22] other quote. The Holy Spirit follows the
[1:16:24] blood all the way from the book of
[1:16:27] redemption.
[1:16:29] So the minute you born, your name was in
[1:16:31] the blood section of the book, brother.
[1:16:33] That's why you uncomfortable, sister.
[1:16:35] You'll never be happy in that condition.
[1:16:37] You know why? Your name is in the blood
[1:16:39] section of the book. And now the Holy
[1:16:41] Spirit is on your trail and he's going
[1:16:43] to bring you to a place where you need
[1:16:45] to be. That's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:46] here
[1:16:48] for. That's why you feel condemned. You
[1:16:51] ought to feel condemned. That's the Holy
[1:16:53] Spirit. Don't turn that down.
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:17:01] So you were made flesh and redeemable.
[1:17:03] So the minute you came into your body,
[1:17:05] you are now redeemable. Hallelujah. So
[1:17:07] the Holy Ghost goes to hunting.
[1:17:10] Oh, I don't care where you run. I don't
[1:17:12] care how you trying to hide. You might
[1:17:15] hide in the benches. Jesus is going to
[1:17:17] get you.
[1:17:22] He's going to get you.
[1:17:23] Hallelujah. He knows exactly where
[1:17:26] you're going to find out. He even knows
[1:17:27] where you're sitting.
[1:17:29] Hallelujah. Do you know that tonight he
[1:17:32] knows even where you're sitting?
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:40] So there's no excellence with God. And
[1:17:42] all those who was redeemable believed it
[1:17:45] because they were in the thoughts of
[1:17:46] God. The attributes of him at the
[1:17:48] beginning was made flesh and redeemable
[1:17:51] and was brought back to God. As many as
[1:17:54] received him, to them gave you the power
[1:17:55] to become the sons of God. Brother
[1:17:58] Peter, he woman at the well, she had
[1:18:00] representation of predestination.
[1:18:02] Ephesians, brother Isaac read this
[1:18:06] 4:5 1 verse4 according as watch. He hath
[1:18:11] chosen us in him, not our choosing. No,
[1:18:14] he choose us. Now, now you got to be
[1:18:16] very careful. Don't say, "No, I chose
[1:18:18] him and and I no according as he has
[1:18:22] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:18:24] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:18:26] without blame before him in love, having
[1:18:29] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:18:31] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:18:34] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:18:36] will." Let me point out here that
[1:18:39] according to these verses, Jesus Christ
[1:18:42] is doing the choosing.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] So it's got nothing to do with the
[1:18:51] minister.
[1:18:53] The choosing is according to him.
[1:18:56] Now Jesus Christ is choosing. He's
[1:18:59] choosing his own bride. Just the same as
[1:19:01] any man chooses their brides today. The
[1:19:05] bride today does not simply decide she's
[1:19:07] going to take a certain man for her
[1:19:09] husband. No sir. It's the groom who
[1:19:11] decides and chooses a certain woman for
[1:19:13] his bride. Hallelujah. You have not
[1:19:16] chosen me, but I have chosen you. Now,
[1:19:19] according to the word of God, the bride
[1:19:21] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:19:23] world. The choosing of the bride was
[1:19:26] purposed in himself, brother. Jesus
[1:19:29] Christ purposed in himself. He's going
[1:19:31] to choose a bride and he chose you to be
[1:19:34] holy and without blame before him in
[1:19:37] love. When did he do it, brother Amon?
[1:19:39] Not the night that you were born, not
[1:19:41] the night you gave your heart to the
[1:19:43] Lord, but before the foundation of the
[1:19:46] world, you were
[1:19:48] chosen. Come on, young people, man. Can
[1:19:51] we get a shouting house? Yes. Come on.
[1:19:54] Give God back. This is for you.
[1:19:58] Hallelujah. It's for you. He gave his
[1:20:00] life for
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:04] you. My I'm not going to let no devil
[1:20:06] beg me down, brother. Every time he says
[1:20:09] shut up, I'm going to stand up, brother.
[1:20:11] The every time you stand up, you define
[1:20:13] him. Hallelujah. I think brother Isaac
[1:20:15] said our hands must hang down, but when
[1:20:18] you lift it up, you define nature.
[1:20:20] Hallelujah. The laws. Why? Because you
[1:20:23] eighth day
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:27] [Applause]
[1:20:30] people.
[1:20:33] My she was chosen before this world
[1:20:36] purposing himself. He says Ephesians 1:9
[1:20:39] and Romans 9:11. It says that the
[1:20:40] purpose of God according to election
[1:20:42] might stand. You can't read it any other
[1:20:44] way. The heart purpose, the eternal
[1:20:47] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[1:20:48] his own choosing. And that purpose was
[1:20:51] in himself and being eternal was decreed
[1:20:54] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:20:58] Jesus didn't decide now I'm going to
[1:21:01] choose a bride. No. He didn't decide
[1:21:03] well at this holy convocation I'm going
[1:21:05] to choose a bride. Oh, he chose this
[1:21:08] bride wind before the foundation of the
[1:21:11] world. You were already chosen, man.
[1:21:14] Tell it back to the devil. Hear that,
[1:21:17] Satan? Chuck it in his face, man. I was
[1:21:20] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:21:23] world.
[1:21:25] Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:33] My Come on, man. Oh, I I feel my muscles
[1:21:37] growing, Brother Peter. I feel twice my
[1:21:40] size. I was tired. I'm no more tired.
[1:21:43] Why? There's something in the house.
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:54] He says, "Watch carefully now and see
[1:21:57] this. Before there was ever a speck of
[1:21:58] stardust, before God was God, even an
[1:22:01] odd of adoration, no one was there to
[1:22:04] worship him. So he was at that time only
[1:22:08] a potentially God and he was known only
[1:22:11] as the eternal spirit. The bride was
[1:22:13] already in his mind.
[1:22:16] So I'm speaking of your pre-existence.
[1:22:22] Oh my goodness.
[1:22:24] You're not a creature of time, man.
[1:22:26] We're now broken into eternity. We're
[1:22:28] pushing you back up.
[1:22:31] And and you're going to hear, brother,
[1:22:32] sisters, if you see this, you'll see
[1:22:35] many other things.
[1:22:39] If you can see that you're a part of God
[1:22:41] in his mind, come to the earth for a
[1:22:44] purpose.
[1:22:45] Hallelujah. When I see that, he says,
[1:22:48] you'll see many more other things,
[1:22:50] brother.
[1:22:54] My he says and known only as the eternal
[1:22:57] spirit. The bride was already in his
[1:22:59] mind. Yes, she was. She was existing in
[1:23:01] his thoughts. And what about those
[1:23:03] thoughts of God? They are eternal. Are
[1:23:05] they not? That's what I said. My title.
[1:23:09] The bride is the eternal thoughts of God
[1:23:11] made manifest.
[1:23:13] Sure.
[1:23:15] Now the devil that that shakes him,
[1:23:17] brother. Do you think of people like
[1:23:19] this with all their mistakes they the
[1:23:22] bride? Yes, they the bride. Hear that,
[1:23:25] Satan? They are the bride. This is a
[1:23:28] portion of them sitting here tonight.
[1:23:30] And she's all across the world, brother.
[1:23:33] There's a people that's called by his
[1:23:35] name. Hallelujah. That was in the
[1:23:37] thoughts of God. They are eternal, are
[1:23:39] they not?
[1:23:42] The eternal thoughts of God. Let me ask
[1:23:44] you, are the thoughts of God eternal?
[1:23:46] Amen. Now, here's a here's he says if
[1:23:50] you can see this, you will see many
[1:23:52] other things.
[1:23:55] Glory. Hallelujah. If you can see this,
[1:23:58] you'll see many other things.
[1:24:00] Hallelujah. God is unchangeable in both
[1:24:03] essence and behavior. He has never had a
[1:24:06] new thought about anything because all
[1:24:08] his thoughts he has always had and
[1:24:10] always will have and knows the end from
[1:24:13] the beginning because he's God. Amen.
[1:24:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They are not
[1:24:18] simply like a man with a blueprint he
[1:24:21] has drawn up and which one day will be
[1:24:23] translated into substance and form. But
[1:24:26] they are already real and eternal and a
[1:24:30] part of God. So man is going to build a
[1:24:33] house. So he gets all the bricks and the
[1:24:35] wood and the cement. You see, he still
[1:24:37] got to put the thing together,
[1:24:42] right? He's got a blueprint he's got to
[1:24:44] work by. And this foundation must be so
[1:24:46] deep and this laid and everything. And
[1:24:48] the walls must go up in the roof. Trust
[1:24:50] us, brother. That's what he does. But
[1:24:52] when God looks at his bride,
[1:24:55] she's complete. She's already built up.
[1:24:59] He don't see you with your mistakes and
[1:25:01] all what is wrong with you. He sees you
[1:25:03] perfect, brother. He sees you
[1:25:06] complete. Hallelujah. That's a God I
[1:25:09] serve, man. Hallelujah. He's a God. And
[1:25:13] then he says here, so I'm speaking to 8
[1:25:15] people and we're looking with their with
[1:25:17] their eternal eye. Remember now, we're
[1:25:20] looking with the eternal eye. It's
[1:25:22] already real to God. So God sees you
[1:25:24] complete. He sees the building standing.
[1:25:27] He sees the house already completed. He
[1:25:30] already sees you as a stature of a
[1:25:32] perfect man. He sees you already
[1:25:35] adopted. He sees you already coming to
[1:25:37] your Ephesians. He sees you coming into
[1:25:40] your position. He sees you perfected. He
[1:25:43] sees you baptized with and filled with
[1:25:45] the Holy Ghost. He sees you already in
[1:25:47] your 8th day holy convocation. He sees
[1:25:51] you going to free. You're going free in
[1:25:54] this time of Jubilee. On the eighth day,
[1:25:57] he sees you already in that eternal city
[1:26:00] that brother Blato spoke about. He
[1:26:01] already sees you there. You're not a
[1:26:04] creature of time. Don't let the devil
[1:26:07] lie to you, man. You're a creature of
[1:26:09] eternity. You come from God and you're
[1:26:13] going back to God. You are in the mind
[1:26:16] of God. So you're going back where you
[1:26:18] came
[1:26:19] from. Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:29] So God don't see like a man.
[1:26:32] He still has to put it together, but
[1:26:34] when he looks at you, you complete.
[1:26:39] Say, "Brother Raymond, I have so many
[1:26:41] mistakes." He sees you complete. Brother
[1:26:43] Raymond, I still have this hanging on
[1:26:45] me. He sees you perfected. He sees you
[1:26:48] adopted. My He sees you in your
[1:26:50] Ephesians. He see you in the 8th day
[1:26:52] holy convocation where there's a revival
[1:26:55] going on. So when he looks
[1:26:58] now, that's why, you know, I'm so glad
[1:27:00] we serve God, man. Man always puts man
[1:27:04] down.
[1:27:07] Come on, preach back now. Is that the
[1:27:10] truth? Man will always put man down. But
[1:27:13] you know when God looks That's why I
[1:27:16] don't care about any man's opinion. What
[1:27:18] they think or what they say, it's
[1:27:20] immaterial, I'm worried. What does God
[1:27:23] think of me? This way. I must be
[1:27:25] connected this way. Not this way,
[1:27:28] brother. This way they cut you off. This
[1:27:30] way it's limited. This way it's only
[1:27:33] those who love you. But this way it's
[1:27:36] unconditional.
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:39] Hallelujah. Vertical is unconditional.
[1:27:44] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:27:52] Oh my.
[1:27:55] I feel a fire on that. Men will always
[1:27:58] put you down. They always have a hidden
[1:28:01] agenda or something. But not with God.
[1:28:04] You know when they have an argument to
[1:28:05] you, they take you out to the out of
[1:28:06] Facebook, they take you out to the
[1:28:08] phone, they take your names off, they
[1:28:11] they they disqualify you, they want to
[1:28:14] have nothing to do with you. But you
[1:28:15] know the God we serve, our names is
[1:28:18] written, brother Peter, in blood.
[1:28:21] Hallelujah. He can never take your name
[1:28:23] off the book, brother. Why? Because your
[1:28:25] name is in the blood section of the
[1:28:27] book.
[1:28:30] You know, even if even if we fail and
[1:28:32] make mistakes, he doesn't disqualify us.
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:42] Oh man, the devil hates preaching like
[1:28:44] this. And I love to chuck it in his
[1:28:46] face, brother. Because you see, we were
[1:28:49] we were a fallen people and we needed a
[1:28:52] greater character than us to redeem us
[1:28:55] back. Right. And now we redeem back to
[1:28:58] the mind of God and once you come in
[1:29:00] flesh. So God is not going to get
[1:29:03] listen.
[1:29:05] Brother Brandham says this earth was
[1:29:07] baptized in water when Noah's there. All
[1:29:10] right. Then the blood fell when Jesus
[1:29:13] sanctified it. He says the next fire.
[1:29:17] He says he he's not going to discard
[1:29:20] this earth. He renovates it.
[1:29:23] burns off every germ, every sinner,
[1:29:26] everything will be burnt off and made
[1:29:28] new. He says he why? He renovates it. He
[1:29:31] says, "Well, that's the same way he
[1:29:33] does. He doesn't get rid of you or your
[1:29:35] earth." Hallelujah. But what does he do?
[1:29:39] He gives you the blood. He gives you the
[1:29:41] water, blood, spirit, fire, baptism, and
[1:29:45] then he comes to live on the
[1:29:47] earth. That's the same three stages you
[1:29:50] go through, brother, sister. But he
[1:29:52] doesn't get rid of the earth.
[1:29:54] [Applause]
[1:30:08] Hallelujah. Eight day speaks of a new
[1:30:10] beginning. Amen. The Jews would
[1:30:12] circumcise all the male children on the
[1:30:13] eighth day.
[1:30:15] I hope I want to say this again. Here
[1:30:18] comes Samuel. Yeah. He he must anoint
[1:30:21] one of Jesse's sons. All right. As king.
[1:30:24] So he says, "Bring them. Bring them.
[1:30:25] Bring them." And as they coming by, "No,
[1:30:27] no, no, no." And he says, "But you must
[1:30:29] have one more." Said, "But he's not
[1:30:33] qualified. He might not be qualified,
[1:30:36] but he's chosen. Bring him, brother.
[1:30:38] Bring him. Bring him. Bring him. Bring
[1:30:40] him. Bring him." And when Samuel saw
[1:30:42] him, he said, "Hey, this is him." He
[1:30:43] anointed David with oil. Hallelujah.
[1:30:46] Right there, brother. Why? Because David
[1:30:50] found favor in the sight of
[1:30:52] God. I'm here to tell you, you found
[1:30:55] favor tonight, man. Don't sit back.
[1:30:57] Don't say it's not me. Don't say it's
[1:30:59] for my brother. It's for you.
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:08] And he was the eighth son of Jesse. And
[1:31:11] he was anointed king. You never had a
[1:31:14] beginning. You will never have an end.
[1:31:16] You were always eternal and you come
[1:31:18] from God and you're going back to God.
[1:31:21] Hallelujah. I was looking this up and I
[1:31:22] read it somewhere. I just couldn't find
[1:31:24] it. They say the number of the beast,
[1:31:26] the pope, when you work it out in Roman
[1:31:29] numerology, it comes to triple 6.
[1:31:33] But they say the name of Jesus when you
[1:31:35] work it out in Greek numerology, it is
[1:31:38] triple 8. Hallelujah.
[1:31:42] Oh my brother, you mean on this eighth
[1:31:44] day? And I just checked the calendar.
[1:31:46] Brother Theo is the eighth today.
[1:31:50] Come on, people. Man, don't sit back,
[1:31:52] man. Something is happening. Something
[1:31:54] is spiritual is going on. I can't sit
[1:31:57] back. Something is happening.
[1:32:00] This is the eighth day and we have the
[1:32:02] eighth day holy convocation. God must do
[1:32:05] something for me. I'm going to reach
[1:32:07] out. I'm going to pull down glory. I'm
[1:32:09] going to build on the Holy Spirit. Why?
[1:32:12] Everything is running and going.
[1:32:18] There's no coincidence with God, man.
[1:32:23] Down through the centuries, we could go
[1:32:25] and find Moses and Jeremiah and John the
[1:32:28] Baptist. Each one of these were God's
[1:32:30] eternal thoughts expressed in their
[1:32:32] season. My that means that when we write
[1:32:36] uh there with him in the in his mind and
[1:32:38] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[1:32:40] the world that he gives an eternal
[1:32:43] listen quality
[1:32:45] to the elect
[1:32:50] listen what he says man and you put
[1:32:52] yourself down. He says the elect has an
[1:32:56] eternal quality
[1:32:58] [Applause]
[1:32:59] not quantity
[1:33:01] quality.
[1:33:03] God don't count his, he weighs his. How
[1:33:07] heavy are you, brother? It's not in
[1:33:09] numbers, but it's how heavy you are. So,
[1:33:12] he gives you a eternal quality.
[1:33:17] [Applause]
[1:33:24] So, he gives eternal quality to the
[1:33:26] elect. You can't get away from that.
[1:33:28] Amen. One professor one day he took out
[1:33:32] a $100 bill and he kept it up and he
[1:33:37] says, "How many wants this?" And he
[1:33:39] says, "Many hands went up." All right.
[1:33:41] Then he squashed it and he chucked it
[1:33:44] there and he says, "How many still want
[1:33:46] it?" He said, "And more hands went up."
[1:33:48] He says, "Then he took it and he chucked
[1:33:49] it on the ground and he squashed
[1:33:52] it." He picked it up says, "How many
[1:33:54] want it?" And still hands went up. He
[1:33:56] says, "What's the moral of the story?"
[1:33:58] Yeah. Though it was crushed, though it
[1:34:01] was stamped upon, though it was meshed,
[1:34:04] but it never lost its value.
[1:34:08] Hallelujah.
[1:34:10] Come on, brother, sister. I don't care
[1:34:12] what the devil did to you, stomped on
[1:34:14] you, dreamt on you, grind you, but you
[1:34:17] still have the quality, the value.
[1:34:21] Hallelujah.
[1:34:23] Amen. Amen. You still have the quality.
[1:34:27] You still have the value and he's given
[1:34:30] you eternal quality.
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:46] Your quality hasn't diminished. You
[1:34:49] still have the quality you are. You've
[1:34:52] been through hard battles and trials,
[1:34:54] but my thoughts I have for you are not
[1:34:56] are not evil. They are peace and they
[1:34:59] are good. Hallelujah. That's what God
[1:35:02] thinks about you. It's not evil. What
[1:35:05] you're going through, it's not evil.
[1:35:07] God, according to Romans
[1:35:10] 8:28, everything happens for good to
[1:35:14] them that love the Lord. Hallelujah. So,
[1:35:18] you haven't lost your value. Come on,
[1:35:21] young people. Tell the devil that I
[1:35:23] still have the value. I still have the
[1:35:26] quality. I still have I still have
[1:35:36] it. I need some virtue, man.
[1:35:39] Hallelujah. Glory be to God.
[1:35:43] Hallelujah.
[1:35:45] Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:35:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:35:52] Hallelujah. Come on,
[1:35:55] brother. You haven't lost your value.
[1:36:00] You still worth it.
[1:36:03] You still worth it. Don't give up. Don't
[1:36:07] backslide. Don't go to the world. You
[1:36:10] still got value.
[1:36:12] You still worth that
[1:36:14] $100. I don't care if he stopped you. I
[1:36:17] don't care if he took you to the world.
[1:36:19] I don't care what he did with your life.
[1:36:22] Maybe had you on drugs, pornography.
[1:36:26] Brother, whatever he put on you, you
[1:36:28] still got your
[1:36:31] [Applause]
[1:36:34] value. Hallelujah.
[1:36:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:47] Hallelujah. Is there a shout in the
[1:36:49] house?
[1:36:53] Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] Come on, brother. You got your quality.
[1:36:58] Eternal quality. A quality that God
[1:37:01] don't count but weighs. Brother, he
[1:37:04] weighs you. And your altitude depends on
[1:37:07] your attitude.
[1:37:10] How high are you going to go? Depends on
[1:37:12] your attitude tonight.
[1:37:14] Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] My my my my
[1:37:19] Oh, I feel a shout coming on me. I feel
[1:37:22] I got a praise. I feel like dancing. I
[1:37:25] feel like shouting. The Holy Spirit is
[1:37:28] all over the building. Uh the anointing
[1:37:30] of God is here. You can go free tonight.
[1:37:33] Mother, where you sitting? You can go
[1:37:36] free.
[1:37:45] Hallelujah.
[1:37:47] I'm going to skip a few things.
[1:37:50] Hallelujah.
[1:37:52] Oh, praise the Lord. He said, "I've been
[1:37:55] zealous of the kind of seeds I planted
[1:37:57] for the body. The rain is going to fall
[1:38:00] pretty soon. I mean, the real rain and
[1:38:02] it must have seed to fall on." Amen.
[1:38:07] Come on, brother Olu. It's got to have
[1:38:10] seed. I've been very jealous of the seed
[1:38:14] I planted for the body. For the body.
[1:38:18] We're not interested on the other seeds.
[1:38:20] What did he plant for me? What did he
[1:38:23] say? There's another 8th day holy
[1:38:26] convocation. Hallelujah. Come on. Preach
[1:38:29] back. You eighth day people. You know
[1:38:32] what I'm speaking about.
[1:38:43] [Applause]
[1:38:47] Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] He says we become part of the word, part
[1:38:51] of his life, flesh of his flesh, bone of
[1:38:54] his bone, life of his life. Then we can
[1:38:56] no more perish than God himself could
[1:38:59] perish. Why? That's what the Holy Ghost
[1:39:01] is.
[1:39:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Listen what he
[1:39:05] says here. But as long as you're a child
[1:39:07] of God, the world better keep their
[1:39:10] hands off of you. Hallelujah. As long as
[1:39:13] you're a child of God, they better keep
[1:39:15] their hands off you, brother. They they
[1:39:18] now they're now mixing with God. They
[1:39:20] now playing around and said, "It's
[1:39:21] better that a milestone be hung on your
[1:39:23] neck and you be cast into this the sea
[1:39:26] than to offend one of my little ones. So
[1:39:29] the world better keep his hands off you.
[1:39:32] You God's property.
[1:39:34] Hallelujah.
[1:39:36] Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] Hallelujah.
[1:39:40] Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:39:43] Hallelujah. The thoughts was in God.
[1:39:46] Then we were in God in eternity. And we
[1:39:48] were spoken into existence by the word.
[1:39:51] So the logo spoke you. He says, "Little
[1:39:53] you and little me. No one in the world
[1:39:57] can take my place. Nobody in the world
[1:40:00] can take your place. Woo! Little me. No
[1:40:04] one can take your place. No one can take
[1:40:06] my place. No one can take their place.
[1:40:09] Your place. Hallelujah. Your place in
[1:40:11] Christ. Nobody can take you, brother.
[1:40:16] Hallelujah.
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:23] says, "What kind of people should we be
[1:40:25] where the Holy Spirit has you so
[1:40:27] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[1:40:30] your own thoughts, you don't use your
[1:40:31] own mind, you don't use your own
[1:40:33] opinions, but the Holy Spirit has you so
[1:40:36] built until your thoughts and your being
[1:40:39] is God's spirit expressing himself
[1:40:42] through what kind of a church ought we
[1:40:45] to be tonight? Let the Holy Spirit
[1:40:48] embody us, take over our thoughts and
[1:40:51] our minds, and harness us tonight.
[1:40:54] That's what the Holy Spirit is here
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:05] for.
[1:41:10] Here's the one. That's why I say you
[1:41:13] can't hide. Listen, you can't hide. I
[1:41:16] don't care if you're hiding in the pews
[1:41:18] and you don't want to see my face. You
[1:41:20] ducking and diving. But God knows
[1:41:22] exactly where you are. Here's the quote.
[1:41:26] God's word is eternal. In the beginning
[1:41:28] was the word and the word was with God
[1:41:31] and the word was God. In the beginning
[1:41:33] back there when he's seen the world he's
[1:41:36] seen you and I this morning
[1:41:39] we say this afternoon he sees you and
[1:41:42] I listen what he says he's seen my baby
[1:41:46] sitting back yonder.
[1:41:51] He knows even where your child is
[1:41:53] sitting.
[1:41:54] Oh my goodness. I seen my baby back
[1:41:57] there. He's seen every hungry person in
[1:42:00] India. He's seen every preacher in the
[1:42:02] pulpit. He's seen every hypocrite
[1:42:04] walking. He's seen the whole thing. The
[1:42:06] infinite mind of God foraw it. And he
[1:42:09] said, "Now to redeem that foreign race,
[1:42:11] I'll send my Christ to my Christ, my
[1:42:14] son, to redeem them."
[1:42:17] So he knows exactly where you're
[1:42:18] sitting. He knows the seat. He knew you
[1:42:21] would be coming Isaac. He knew there'll
[1:42:23] be a switch. He knew you going to preach
[1:42:25] and not brother Paul.
[1:42:28] That's God. There's no mistakes with
[1:42:30] him. Everything that happens in your
[1:42:33] life is for a purpose.
[1:42:36] If you see that, brother man says, you
[1:42:38] will see many other things.
[1:42:44] Oh God, give me a revelation that I can
[1:42:47] see I'm a part of God. I'm eternal as
[1:42:50] God is eternal. I come from God and I'm
[1:42:53] going back to God. It's like that ring
[1:42:55] is a circle. There's no beginning.
[1:42:57] There's no end, brother. It just
[1:42:59] continues. You come from eternity. You
[1:43:02] bypass your theophony coming to the body
[1:43:04] of a place of trying, but you go right
[1:43:07] back again to eternity.
[1:43:10] Where you come from? Hallelujah. Oh, the
[1:43:13] devil hates it. Where we come from,
[1:43:15] brother Isaac? We can brag, man.
[1:43:18] Hallelujah. Eight day people, we come
[1:43:20] from eternity, man.
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:26] My glory glory glory.
[1:43:30] That's the reason when he spoke a
[1:43:32] Messiah, there had to come a Messiah. He
[1:43:34] spoke that there would be a church in
[1:43:36] the last days without spot or wrinkle on
[1:43:38] it. There will be a church there.
[1:43:40] Hallelujah. He said it. I take his word
[1:43:42] and I believe it.
[1:43:45] So you see God, you don't question his
[1:43:46] word. When he says it, you believe it.
[1:43:50] Moses spoke God's thoughts. He says
[1:43:53] because a word is the thought to express
[1:43:55] and God brought his thoughts to Moses
[1:43:57] and Moses spoke them. Let there be flies
[1:44:00] and there was flies. Let there be flee.
[1:44:02] He says why his mind and God's mind came
[1:44:04] in contact brother. Oh hallelujah.
[1:44:08] Let me say something to this united
[1:44:11] time. See the church is uniting. Nations
[1:44:13] uniting. It's a united time of God and
[1:44:15] his pride too. And I say this with
[1:44:17] reverence and respect. I believe that
[1:44:19] the pride is of Christ is called
[1:44:22] I believe she's sealed into the kingdom
[1:44:24] of God. I believe the mechanics is
[1:44:26] there. They're waiting for the dynamics
[1:44:28] that will take her off the earth into
[1:44:29] glory in the rapture. I believe it with
[1:44:32] all my heart. Yes, sir. We don't know
[1:44:34] how he's going to do it, but he shall do
[1:44:36] it. I don't know how. I cannot explain,
[1:44:39] but he will do it, brother. And that's
[1:44:41] what we waiting for. The dynamics. Could
[1:44:43] it be this
[1:44:45] convention where a prophecy has been
[1:44:48] spoken over the
[1:44:50] people and you don't question but you
[1:44:53] take it and you embrace it
[1:44:56] and say that's me.
[1:44:59] Hallelujah.
[1:45:01] That's the reason I believe when the
[1:45:02] bride is called and elected and set in
[1:45:04] the book of life, there will come a son
[1:45:07] from heaven that will take such a
[1:45:08] baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[1:45:10] bride that it will take her from the
[1:45:12] earth in rapture and grace. God
[1:45:14] promises. Don't care how many signs and
[1:45:16] how many astronauts and signs up there
[1:45:18] and everything else, how many million
[1:45:20] miles they can see. I don't care nothing
[1:45:21] about that. There is a heaven and there
[1:45:24] is a literal Jesus.
[1:45:27] Now, he told us earlier there's a
[1:45:28] literal pride. Now he says there's a
[1:45:31] literal Jesus. There is a heaven and
[1:45:33] there is a literal Jesus.
[1:45:36] Hallelujah. There's a literal Jesus
[1:45:39] Christ that there that will come in a
[1:45:42] body form to receive his church to
[1:45:44] himself. No matter how old the story
[1:45:46] seems, it's still the truth. God said
[1:45:48] so. That's what believers believe.
[1:45:51] Can I hear the 8day believers?
[1:45:54] Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:45:59] Okay. Hallelujah. Now, we're going to
[1:46:01] hit Jeremiah 29:11.
[1:46:04] Now, the thoughts that God thinks, we
[1:46:05] always worried what what do you think
[1:46:07] about me? What does she think about me?
[1:46:09] That has not got one thing. What anybody
[1:46:12] thinks about you? It's got nothing to do
[1:46:14] with it. I'm interested. What does God
[1:46:16] think about me?
[1:46:18] Hallelujah.
[1:46:20] And if I can see that, brother, I'm
[1:46:22] going to see many more things.
[1:46:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So, we're
[1:46:27] going to hit the expected end.
[1:46:29] Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:36] Hallelujah. My thoughts that I think
[1:46:38] toward you. Hallelujah. Thoughts of
[1:46:40] peace and not of evil. To give you an
[1:46:42] expected end. And when you're going
[1:46:45] through the trial and through your
[1:46:46] situation, you always think God is
[1:46:47] judging you. But if you take that
[1:46:50] scripture, it says, "My thoughts towards
[1:46:52] you that I think they are good and
[1:46:55] peace. Yes. And they are not evil. So
[1:46:58] God don't think evil of his bride. What
[1:47:01] man will do their brother? God don't
[1:47:04] think evil of his bride.
[1:47:10] My hallelujah. He says what? He says my
[1:47:13] thoughts that I think toward you the
[1:47:15] thoughts of peace and not of evil. So we
[1:47:19] forever thinking that when we go through
[1:47:21] a situation it's evil. I must have done
[1:47:23] something wrong. God is punishing me.
[1:47:25] No, God got you where he wants you.
[1:47:29] He got you in that situation in your job
[1:47:32] where you don't know which way I do you
[1:47:34] have a job when you go back on Monday.
[1:47:35] Oh God, he got you in that situation
[1:47:37] where you don't even have money to pay
[1:47:39] your rent. Oh my God. He got you on that
[1:47:41] situation not because he thinks evil,
[1:47:44] but my thoughts are of peace and not of
[1:47:47] evil to give you an expected end.
[1:47:50] Hallelujah. Philippians 1:6. being
[1:47:53] confident of this very thing that he who
[1:47:55] has begun a good work in you will
[1:47:57] complete it until the day of Jesus.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:02] I sort of looked up this word expected
[1:48:05] end. Amen. They say for I know thy
[1:48:08] thoughts towards you the thoughts of
[1:48:09] peace and not of evil to give you what a
[1:48:12] future hope.
[1:48:14] Who expected an expected end. So you
[1:48:19] see, we worried here in between, but God
[1:48:22] is looking at the end. He said, "I'm the
[1:48:24] first and I'm the last." He's not
[1:48:26] worried what happens in between. He took
[1:48:28] care of the end at the beginning. He
[1:48:32] took care of it. And here you worried
[1:48:34] about what's happening in your life,
[1:48:35] brother. I don't care what drama you
[1:48:37] have. I don't care what drama you have,
[1:48:39] sister, but there's a plan of God
[1:48:41] working in your life. Young people, you
[1:48:44] can hide, but God is going to get you,
[1:48:46] man.
[1:48:47] He's got a plan for you. He's got He's
[1:48:50] got thoughts for you.
[1:48:52] He wants to give you an expected end.
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] Woo!
[1:49:00] Hallelujah. My my my
[1:49:03] my Oh, are you ready for an expected
[1:49:06] end,
[1:49:07] brother? Hallelujah. God never ends on a
[1:49:11] negative. God never lost a battle. He
[1:49:14] never ended on any negative. Find me any
[1:49:16] place in the Bible where it ended
[1:49:18] negative. You're not going to find it.
[1:49:21] It always ends positive. Woo!
[1:49:24] Hallelujah. You're going to have an
[1:49:26] expected end.
[1:49:29] A future hope, an expected end. In other
[1:49:32] words, there would be an outcome.
[1:49:36] You see, he's not just going to leave us
[1:49:37] here. There must be an outcome of this
[1:49:40] message. It It must be completed.
[1:49:43] There must be a manifestation of this
[1:49:45] message. He's not going to just leave us
[1:49:48] here all the years toiling, toiling,
[1:49:49] toiling, preaching, preaching,
[1:49:51] preaching, convention. No, it's coming
[1:49:53] to a climax.
[1:49:55] It's coming to completion.
[1:49:58] He's not going to leave you
[1:50:00] uncomplete. He's not going to leave you
[1:50:03] defeated. Come on now, man. Preach back
[1:50:06] to me. He's not going to leave you
[1:50:08] unfinished.
[1:50:15] an expected end. In other words, there
[1:50:17] would be an outcome. There will be some
[1:50:20] results.
[1:50:23] You can't do a test and you don't get
[1:50:25] results. You go and write the test,
[1:50:28] brother, they give you your results. You
[1:50:30] either pass or you fail. But you going
[1:50:32] to pass. You already pass. Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] Hallelujah. You already pass, man.
[1:50:43] So there will be results. It says there
[1:50:46] would be a completion. God would wind up
[1:50:49] or tie up everything in your life that's
[1:50:50] loose. So an expected end. So to all the
[1:50:56] drama in your life, there's going to be
[1:50:57] an expected end because I know the
[1:51:00] thoughts I think of you, they're not
[1:51:02] evil.
[1:51:04] Oh God, help us. I see Noah preaching
[1:51:08] the gospel for 120 years it will rain.
[1:51:11] Come back next Sunday it will rain for
[1:51:15] 120 years he comes it will rain. But one
[1:51:18] day hallelujah here come the angel and
[1:51:21] he says Noah you and your family come
[1:51:23] into the ark. What did Noah have? He had
[1:51:26] a completion to his ministry. And what
[1:51:30] happened brother? Noah and his family
[1:51:32] was saved and the whole world was
[1:51:34] drowned. He had an expected end. Job, he
[1:51:38] had an expected end. Was stripped of
[1:51:40] everything. But on the air sheep, he got
[1:51:43] the greatest revelation when he walked
[1:51:46] amongst the princes and they asked
[1:51:48] counsel of him. This man that was so
[1:51:50] rich and so full of wisdom. But he finds
[1:51:53] himself on the airship.
[1:51:58] But you know on the airship sheep is
[1:52:00] where he got the greatest revelation.
[1:52:03] It's not when you're up here. It's when
[1:52:04] you're down there and you're in the
[1:52:06] bottom in the gutters that God comes
[1:52:08] right down and he pulls you right up
[1:52:11] again. On the airship, Job got the
[1:52:14] greatest revelation.
[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:23] And what happened? The thunders uh
[1:52:26] blasted and the lightning and God spoke
[1:52:28] to brother Jesse this morning. He says
[1:52:31] and great gave him the greatest
[1:52:32] revelation. He stood up from there.
[1:52:34] Watch his expected end.
[1:52:37] When his friends walked away, his
[1:52:40] brothers didn't want to have fellowship
[1:52:41] with him. They accuse him of being a
[1:52:43] secret sinner. But this man held on to
[1:52:45] the blood.
[1:52:47] Sure.
[1:52:49] He said, "Even for my children, where
[1:52:51] they sin and I don't see, I'm offering
[1:52:53] the blood for them."
[1:52:55] Hallelujah. He held on to the blood.
[1:52:58] Hallelujah. That's all brother held. And
[1:53:01] then the lightning flashed and the
[1:53:03] thunders roar. Come on, Job. Stand to
[1:53:06] your feet. I want to speak to you like a
[1:53:08] man. And when he spoke to him, after he
[1:53:11] left, Job, what did he say? I know my
[1:53:15] redeemer liveth. In the last days, he
[1:53:18] will stand upon the earth. Though the
[1:53:20] skin worms destroyed this body, yet in
[1:53:23] my flesh I will see him. Job had an
[1:53:27] expected end.

[1:56:50] Caleb Caleb had an expected end. He was
[1:56:54] 40 years old when he God's servant said,
[1:56:56] "I will you will have this mountain."
[1:56:59] Now he says he's 85 years old. He says,
[1:57:01] "And I'm just as strong when Moses
[1:57:03] promised it." That's right. He says,
[1:57:05] "Now give me my mountain." You see, he
[1:57:07] had an expected end. Though his other
[1:57:10] brothers let him down,
[1:57:12] beautiful brother Isaac, the way you
[1:57:14] brought it and he didn't hold it. He
[1:57:15] says, "The other brothers caused me to
[1:57:17] walk another 40 years.
[1:57:22] But that's okay. I'm just as strong as I
[1:57:25] was when Moses made the promise." Now
[1:57:28] therefore, give me my mountain. Give me
[1:57:31] my individual inheritance.
[1:57:33] [Applause]
[1:57:38] There was a
[1:57:42] result, glory, glory, glory. You see,
[1:57:45] the expected end is so powerful that God
[1:57:49] leaves you and he don't tells you how
[1:57:50] it's going to be. And that's why you
[1:57:52] keep coming. You keep coming. And the
[1:57:55] more you come, the more it unfolds, the
[1:57:57] more revelation you get. The more you
[1:57:59] understand what the pastor is preaching,
[1:58:01] why he's hammering away. Because why?
[1:58:04] You part of the program of God.

[1:58:17] skip them for time sake. He says, "Yeah,
[1:58:20] the Hebrew boys, they had an expected
[1:58:22] end when they were chucked into the
[1:58:24] fiery furnace." He says, "And when they
[1:58:26] dropped down and the king looked in, he
[1:58:28] said, "But didn't we cast in three?" He
[1:58:30] said, "Yeah, but he says there's a
[1:58:32] fourth man and it looks like the son of
[1:58:34] God. They had an expected end. Right in
[1:58:38] the fiery furnace, your trial, your
[1:58:40] situation, you will see the fourth man
[1:58:43] right there in your trial."
[1:58:46] And when he looked down, he said, "But
[1:58:48] there's four."
[1:58:50] And the fourth man looks like the son of
[1:58:52] God. How did he know?
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:57] Oh, God.
[1:58:59] Hallelujah. And brother Sar says all the
[1:59:02] flames did was burn the chains loose.

[1:59:07] you having, it's only burning the
[1:59:09] situation loose so you can be free to
[1:59:11] worship. Raise your hands. Praise God.
[1:59:14] Give him glory. Give him thanks. Thank
[1:59:17] you for your home. Thank you for your
[1:59:19] children. Thank you for your job you
[1:59:22] have. There's people that don't have
[1:59:23] those things.

[1:59:39] situation, through these drama. Amen.
[1:59:41] And we know how he prayed and now he was
[1:59:42] chucked into the lion's den. And the
[1:59:44] next morning, here he comes walking out.
[1:59:47] Hallelujah. He had an expected end,
[1:59:49] brother. The king even said the God of
[1:59:52] Daniel, he is God.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah.
[1:59:57] Oh my. We can stay on so many of them.
[2:00:01] But I want to come to Jesus. The man
[2:00:03] when he was crucified and and brother
[2:00:05] Isaac hit it and he had an expected end
[2:00:08] when Satan thought he had him on that
[2:00:10] Friday, but he did not know Sunday was
[2:00:13] coming.
[2:00:15] Hallelujah. Oh my God. Hallelujah.
[2:00:19] Friday they were rejoicing and they were
[2:00:21] so happy. They said, "We took him like
[2:00:23] we took Isaiah. We took him like we took
[2:00:25] David. He's just another prophet." But
[2:00:28] that was Friday. But Sunday morning,
[2:00:41] you might be going through your Friday,
[2:00:42] but there's a Sunday coming. And the
[2:00:45] Bible says he arose on the Sunday
[2:00:47] morning on the eighth day. Woo.
[2:00:50] Hallelujah. Brother, is this the day
[2:00:53] that Jesus is going to be resurrected in
[2:00:55] our lives and there'll be revival and
[2:00:58] there'll be eternal part of God in our
[2:01:01] lives? Is this the day, the 8th day holy
[2:01:04] convocation? And he rose on Sunday
[2:01:06] morning on the 8th day a holy
[2:01:09] convocation. Hallelujah. He rose for our
[2:01:11] justification. Because I He lives I will
[2:01:15] live also. Oh hallelujah.

[2:01:20] room. Oh my goodness. Hallelujah. 10
[2:01:23] days they were sitting quoting there to
[2:01:26] one another, holding on to the promise
[2:01:28] of God. Sometimes God, there's a quote I
[2:01:31] had to remove. It was too long. He says
[2:01:33] a son of God can go for many years not
[2:01:35] knowing he's the son of God.
[2:01:39] Many years he can go and don't know it.
[2:01:41] Hallelujah. He says even Abram for 25
[2:01:43] years had to walk with the promise.
[2:01:47] And every morning he wakes up. Oh yes.
[2:01:50] How you feeling, Sarah? Nothing out.
[2:01:52] Praise God. We're going to have that
[2:01:53] baby. Hallelujah. I remember brother's
[2:01:57] message. He says, "All Sarah's wrinkles
[2:01:59] of unbelief didn't stop Abram."
[2:02:02] Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] No unbelief is going to stop us,
[2:02:06] brother. There's a there's a call among
[2:02:09] the elected. The disciples in the upper
[2:02:11] room and expected end. And there they
[2:02:13] were waiting. And all of a sudden, oh
[2:02:15] yeah, the Bible says suddenly.
[2:02:19] Man, I preached a message on that back
[2:02:20] home. Suddenly,

[2:02:39] will appear. Suddenly there'll be a
[2:02:42] baptism of the Holy Spirit come over
[2:02:44] you. Suddenly in the church there'll be
[2:02:46] a sweeping of the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:52] Suddenly God likes to do it that way.
[2:02:55] Not according to your program or my
[2:02:57] program. He does it suddenly.

[2:03:39] Sister Hetty Wright's home and they were
[2:03:41] speaking about the squirrels, the things
[2:03:43] that just happen now. And there she was
[2:03:45] serving and entertaining them and she
[2:03:47] heard it and she turned around. She
[2:03:49] said, "That's exactly the truth,
[2:03:51] brother."

[2:04:47] the super anointing. Not just a normal
[2:04:49] anointing, a day anointing. This man
[2:04:52] broke into that dimension. A day
[2:04:54] anointing. He calls it the super
[2:04:56] anointing. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:04:59] We're not speaking of just a anointing.

[2:05:40] speaking for this day.
[2:05:43] She'll have an expected end. Once again,
[2:05:45] watch. The world will hear direct from
[2:05:47] God like it was on the day of what?
[2:05:50] Pentecost. Pentecost was the eighth day.
[2:05:53] So he says, "Once again, the world will
[2:05:55] hear direct from God." Like as the
[2:05:57] Pentecost, she becomes God's mouthpiece.
[2:06:01] The bride
[2:06:03] Oh, she'll have an outcome. She'll have
[2:06:06] results. Oh, the bride will be the final
[2:06:09] voice to the final age. And it will be
[2:06:12] on the 8th day holy convocation that God
[2:06:16] will pour down the dynamics. It will be
[2:06:18] another 8th day holy convocation.
[2:06:21] Brother, so this bride becomes the final
[2:06:24] voice. She'll have a result.

[2:06:31] Show me one place where God ended on a
[2:06:33] negative.
[2:06:35] Everything he did was on a positive.
[2:06:39] And I don't care what drama you have in
[2:06:40] your life, but you're going to have an
[2:06:42] outcome. You're going to have results.

[2:06:59] Christ to know what he wants done with
[2:07:01] the word. Oh, give me a church whose

[2:07:21] Spirit. He says, "When you see that,
[2:07:24] I'll show you a Messiah standing on the
[2:07:28] earth." That will be your end result.
[2:07:31] That will be your outcome. That will be

[2:08:04] close out. What a blessing.
[2:08:08] You remember that negro woman? Oh yes.
[2:08:10] Whose son was busy dying and she prayed
[2:08:13] 4:00 the morning. Lord, you gave me this
[2:08:16] child. He's the only child and he's busy

[2:08:34] Memphis, Tennessee. And they said, "The
[2:08:37] storm is too big. We can't go above. We
[2:08:39] We got to land." Hallelujah. You know
[2:08:42] what did it was? Was the prayer of that
[2:08:44] mama who went right between and cut off
[2:08:47] a plane.
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:51] She was desperate. Her son was dying.
[2:08:54] Where's your Elijah?
[2:08:57] And he said, "Go wait at the gate. I'll
[2:08:59] send him to you." And brother, she
[2:09:01] didn't know her prayer stopped the whole
[2:09:03] Boing 707. And he landed. And brother
[2:09:06] Brandon wanted to sit down. And all of a
[2:09:08] sudden he says, "Stand up." He looked
[2:09:10] who's talking. And he says, "Start
[2:09:12] walking." And he kept walking. He said,
[2:09:14] "Turn turn right." And he turned right.
[2:09:16] "Turn left." left. He turned left. He
[2:09:18] said before you know he was in a colored
[2:09:21] area and yeah he was walking down the
[2:09:23] road and he says across the gate there
[2:09:25] was a hanging a little Jamaima mommy
[2:09:29] with a man shirt wrapped around her head
[2:09:32] and when he came down she said good
[2:09:33] morning person.
[2:09:36] Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] He said how did you know? He said while

[2:09:43] I'll send you
[2:09:44] Elijah. Woo. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do
[2:09:48] we still have pray mothers?
[2:09:52] Crying out for their children.
[2:09:54] She said, listen, she didn't want him
[2:09:56] healed. She said, all I want to know
[2:09:59] that he's right with God. She wasn't
[2:10:02] even praying that God heal him. She
[2:10:04] said, person, all I want to know that if
[2:10:07] he goes that he's right with God.
[2:10:12] [Applause]

[2:10:30] that house there was a sound small sign
[2:10:33] bless this house. This home wasn't much
[2:10:36] of a home. He said okay you start
[2:10:39] praying. Listen man, it's not wrong for
[2:10:41] you sisters to pray. She prayed. The pro
[2:10:44] said you pray. He said, "And when she
[2:10:46] started praying, you could hear that
[2:10:48] woman knew how to talk to God. She's
[2:10:51] been on those sacred sands where it's
[2:10:54] between life and death." And he says,
[2:10:57] "And he looked there and there was the
[2:10:58] son and he was saying to her, it's
[2:11:01] getting dark. It's getting dark." And
[2:11:04] brother Ram says, "I laid my hand on his
[2:11:05] feet." Hallelujah. And I started
[2:11:08] praying. Amen.
[2:11:10] And he says, "Just as I started
[2:11:11] praying,"
[2:11:12] he shook. He says, "Mama, it's becoming
[2:11:15] lighter."
[2:11:17] Hallelujah.
[2:11:18] The prayer of the prophet went right
[2:11:20] down into the right in the dungeons of
[2:11:23] hell was taking that young man's soul to
[2:11:25] hell. But God pulled him back because of
[2:11:28] a mother's prayer.
[2:11:31] Not even to be healed, but just to be
[2:11:34] that his soul might be right with God.
[2:11:37] Oh, God.
[2:11:39] Oh God. Hallelujah.

[2:44:57] trials we would go through, Lord, you
[2:44:59] already knew the
[2:45:01] outcome. We thank you,
[2:45:04] Lord. Help us, Lord, to continue to
[2:45:06] press into you, Lord Jesus.
[2:45:10] to lose more of ourselves every day,
[2:45:12] Father, to shed these, Lord, 16
[2:45:16] elements, Lord, and we can continue to
[2:45:18] blend into eternity, Lord God. And one
[2:45:21] day, Father, like Enoch, Father, we'll
[2:45:24] just walk on into heaven, Lord
[2:45:27] Jesus. Bless your people,
[2:45:30] Father. Be with them this evening.
[2:45:33] Strengthen them, Lord God.
[2:45:36] May we keep this solemn presence with
[2:45:37] us, Lord, in our love feast, wherever we
[2:45:40] may be, Father, as brother Raymond said,
[2:45:42] no matter where we are. We may be back
[2:45:44] at the hotel. We may be going to our
[2:45:47] homes, we may be driving on the road and
[2:45:50] suddenly here comes the Holy Spirit to
[2:45:53] baptize that predestinated
[2:45:57] [Applause]
[2:45:59] seed. In Jesus
[2:46:01] name we pray and ask. Amen.
[2:46:09] If you'd like to return to your seats,
[2:46:13] [Applause]
[2:46:14] if those you want to stay, you could
[2:46:16] still stay.

[2:46:27] Jesus. Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:46:35] [Music]
[2:46:38] There's just
[2:46:41] something
[2:46:43] about that name. Oh, as you find your
[2:46:49] seats. Oh, he's
[2:46:53] master,
[2:46:56] savior. He's
[2:46:58] [Music]
[2:47:00] Jesus. As the brothers prepare for the
[2:47:03] tithes and
[2:47:05] offering. Oh,
[2:47:08] after the
[2:47:11] [Music]
[2:47:13] rain. He's my
[2:47:17] Jesus.
[2:47:20] Jesus. Jesus.

[2:47:38] kings and

[2:47:43] all pass
[2:47:45] away. But there's just
[2:47:49] something
[2:47:51] about that name.
[2:47:54] Let's bow our
[2:47:56] heads. Father, we ask that you'd bless
[2:47:59] these tithes and offering. Father,
[2:48:01] continue to use them for the furtherance
[2:48:03] of your kingdom, Lord. Bless us this
[2:48:06] evening, as we partake of our love
[2:48:09] feast, Lord. And Lord, we continue in
[2:48:12] this atmosphere, Lord. So, we ask these
[2:48:14] things in Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[2:48:18] He's
[2:48:21] mastered
[2:48:23] savior
[2:48:28] Jesus like the
[2:48:31] fragrance
[2:48:33] [Music]
[2:48:39] after
[2:48:42] Jesus.
[2:48:44] Jesus,
[2:48:46] [Music]
[2:48:49] Jesus. Let all
[2:48:52] heaven and
[2:48:55] earth
[2:48:56] [Music]
[2:48:59] proclaim.
[2:49:01] Oh
[2:49:03] kings and
[2:49:05] kingdoms, they will
[2:49:08] all pass away.
[2:49:12] But there's just
[2:49:14] something
[2:49:16] [Music]
[2:49:21] about Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
