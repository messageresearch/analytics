something is moving father we know that your spirit is moving and you're going to trouble the waters that winning on the blow again just as the day of Pentecost father when you come down on a special way this morning and interpreted with Among Us and Portia spread upon your people revive them revive us quickness to your promised word in Jesus name we ask it God bless you and before you take your seats I like it turned to the Bible to send to Judges chapter 16 I want to read verse 20 to 30 from Judges chapter 16. and this is the ending of Delilah's run where Samson was concerned so after he was lying and playing games words with Delilah verse 27 she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he woke out of his sleep and said he will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the Lord had departed from him you missed that he missed he misunderstood the anointing and the presence and power because he was covenanted and even though he thought it was going to be business as usual it wasn't business as usual because he broke that Covenant he broke that power that was resident That was supposed to be with him he was 21 and the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Giza and bound him with fetus of brass and he did grind in a prison house albeit the heel of his head began to grow again after he was shiven and the lord of the Philistines gathered him together for to offer great sacrifice to Dagon the god to Rejoice for they said our God has delivered something our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their God for they said our God had delivered into our hands or enemy The Destroyer of our country which through many of us we came to pass when their hearts were Mary but they said call for something that he may make us support they're looking for entertainment now they call for Samson out of the prison house he made them Sport and he made them support and they set him between the pillars and Samson said unto the lad that held him by their hand suffer me that I may feel the pillars they were upon the house standard that I may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the laws of the Philistines were dear and they were above the roof about three thousand men women that beheld why Samson made Sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strength me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines of my two eyes and Samson took a whole of the two middle pillars upon which a house stood and on which it was born up of the one with the right hand and the other with his left and Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords upon the people that were therein so the dead which he saw what is that well more than which he slew in his life may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord but we thank God to be here this morning who praise God praise God we thank God for the fire we feel in the church we wouldn't come to we didn't come to lecture you we didn't come to just say words to you we come to see the spirit speak expressly we come to see like Paul said it this way I come with to you not with enticing words but man speak but with the words with the power that your faith may not rest and the ability and the study and the knowledge of the man but the power of God so God wants to have your faith in a certain position a certain way praise God a confidence not because you come to this church or who your pastor is that's not what the faith supposed to lie in it's supposed to lie in his power you see we serve a living God it have other gods you know it has a God you know yeah yeah people serve all kind of gods but we serve the Living God and that Living God could speak that Living God could work that Living God do Miracles that Living God could heal that Living God could deliver that Living God could revive that this living God we're talking about who prays the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God the Living God hallelujah and if God is alive you have to be able to feel him you have to be able to worship him you have to identify him you have to know he works he is ever present that's why you call himself Jehovah ever present keep present tense living with you working with you moving with you protecting you putting a hedge around you praise God praise God Jehovah Oh Glory to God he's a bandage glory to God I'm your healer I'm your deliverer I'm your baptizer oh give the Lord a praise this morning hallelujah praise God amen amen or we want to I want to give God thanks for the messages to messages but but uh ULU shared with us simply appreciated what a tremendous time in the presence of God and I I do believe what the prophet said you would hear from the pastor you would hear from the Apostle you would hear from the prophet you would hear from the teacher that is how the bride Ministry gonna go out internationally around the world so we thank God for the effectiveness of Ministries that would be effective to us and I will get whatever Ministry whatever word that will be effective to you as the people that God give me to serve we don't want to kill them and waste time when you come here you must leave yes it was good to be here today I am waste my time coming here I come for a purpose praise God we don't understand three always with you you know 15 minutes and you break into the presence of God that's all you need to know Brahm said five minutes in the presence of the pillar fire taught Moses more than 40 years what he get educated down with Pharaoh all they need is five minutes all the nonsense will leave you five minutes and the holy School your blood always again fight with and there can't overcome this welcome back five minutes in the presence of the pillow fire walk in the Lord some prefer

bring the most inspiration Revival you know gospel Revival Holy Ghost Revival we could do without this morning that's why I'm here oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen so how about the title I want to give this portion here avataria Revival a move of God in power praise God that's the title Revival a move of God in power not in sermon not in messages not an inspiration not in Mysteries a move of God in power that's what a Revival is that's what the prophet identify as a Revival a move of God in Power Glory to God and say it again a move of God in power that's what a Revival is the message I wanted but we want it praise God a message will don't want to have it we will have it he promised us seven Thunder bright Revival Oh Glory could be a move of God in power or give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Safelite this morning to bring back some things that we shared in permittance at some more to it but says every spiritual happening is a sign from God he said be careful every spiritual happening not some every so February 8th some students in Asbury they was having a they have is a Christian College what they call Western Holiness college and they were having Services they have their own service a private college not a public College a private college and in that day when they preacher finished preaching they're coming what was his sermon some of these students came to the Altar and they get to repent and afterwards begin to sing and whatnot and the anointing the power presence came into the building and up to now is those two weeks now is still going on now don't know this thing in the Nano gospel and whatnot but something happening it's a spiritual something and people has been there come from around the world and the the place where it is that is just about 6 000 people is worth to live there and over 50 000 already come inside of there people just coming coming because I remember the record would show that in 1906 Azusa Street when the fire fell people came from everywhere and they took fire back with them to Japan to China to all over the world three blocks from where Azusa Street was the anointing was hidden when people come at a train on Trump car and whatnot the fire falling upon them and they fell in on the street on the conviction of the Holy Ghost it was a power that was there it was a presence what was there the pianos had to play by itself people got gift to play music they never played music before they started playing normal normal praise God prick but praise all kind of Supernatural thing was happening there was no man that was the open door God opened the door and let the Holy Ghost out that door no man wasn't in charge of that no man was running that show the Holy Ghost itself was running that show and we are promised praise God we are promised promise promise another Holy Ghost Revival not for the world you know but for the Bride of Jesus Christ not the baptism and not the best but the person of Christ himself the husband Oh Glory to God do you believe that amen so I know all the cooks and cranks and all kind of stuff going to be there because what happened and I'll show that maybe today might not be the day but a Revival actually bring up spirits and actually bring up Spirit what kind of characters can we call it devil as being at the helmet you know trying to take a little thing inside of there oh yeah oh yeah so every spiritual happening is a sign from God so don't think that that means nothing you know that's something to understand but when the fire for all the effect of it [Applause] over you God left in the whole world this is my daughter this is my son don't mess with them don't fool with them okay the Lord I shout this is my brain oh Gloria God do you believe that that God might receive I act if you feel that you know I see somebody stealing feelings [Music] I didn't ask if you feel anything I ask if you believe that if you don't believe that you're wasted time coming all these years will you believe yeah believe nothing then so God call you out for you to be not part of this whole thing come on please let's continue here now okay let's go all right [Music] when you see a servant of God get so sincere till he's on his face with his hands in the air praying to God and blushing because of the iniquity of the people then you're going to say Revival start with the manner go down the pulpit when you see that God help us a man a way to take this and and just swallow it and accept a man cannot lay in the presence of God as a man then he switches a church cannot lay in the presence of God under repentance because that's where you start for me we find myself from repentance when you recognize you're wrong nothing message long time you're wrong well I'm all right than you know you're wrong well my dress longer than another sister you're wrong I don't have long interest is you're still wrong we are all wrong oh give the Lord I shout in the house [Applause] a church cannot lay in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and give unction and power to start a move of God in dear among the people this is what Ram Speaks show me a man show me another Calvin knocks finny Sankey or any of those who feels the burden of the people that lay on their face and cry and pray before God send us another Judgment of the Baptist Church again who pray all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes were swell shut next morning from weeping till his wife would leave him to the table and see them at breakfast out of a spoon show me a John Wesley again a fireman snatched from the fire I will show your Revival Oh Glory Dakota Revival come with that price our Revival comes with a condition Oh

today is our old-fashioned God sent blood transfusion in heaven the corn pastors won't do no good we are anema we need a blood transfusion we need to come back to the old-fashioned gospel that calls for repentance before God not a giant profession but God sent Holy Ghost Revival with the possession of the cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus you know you don't hear much about that in the message you know about the cleansing of the blood by the blood of the Lord Jesus oh there is power power Wonder working Power in the Blood always have blood for you you know but for your sins you know but for your failures you know but for your mistakes in our blood this morning when he died and says finish he died for you to bring you back those sin and your sins repent right now or give the Lord

we have our weapons it starts with prayer we have the atomic bomb it's stuck with the groon and the travail we have it we don't use it but we have it we're wrapping and raring on the phone every every so often but we're not talking to God although I often say you have your thing in your ears talk to God let people think you're talking on your phone you don't have to come to our prayer meeting to talk to God somebody knows people talking and talking to himself they're mad you know they're talking on the phone there's another thing here they're talking they're talking they're talking you talk

the earth the prophet saw a vision of Hell on the earth God lord your path to hell to get you this morning but mama you made it Oh Glory to God you're gonna do something about it God wants to empower you God wants to anoint you God wants to inspire you how much is power [Applause] thank you let's go [Applause] I'm so sick I'm tired of seeing a petty Hollywood revivals so-called where people come in and get emotionally stayed up for a couple of hours note all day or two or a week or two yeah it's about two weeks go out that's all of it brother you can be worked up by reviver you can have emotion you can have good intentions all these things are fine but we don't need that today we need a baptism of the Holy Spirit to change the emotions and the intellects and the views the habits the life of the people and put them back on the right Road Again [Applause] we need that just for the prophecies no the intellectual preachers love the coat you could have the baptism Holy Ghost 24 hours a day and be lost so when the people here that knocked the freeze then they take that piece of wire some electricity some electricians out there yeah and they connect that and pull a long line and push it the baptism holy hospital sensation and they plug that into that wire they know and then they take a next fire and plug it in now the back niggles is not the real thing because the seed is in the soul bam not in the light yet the pulling line nothing like that then they take a next line pull it out and say Mary say [Applause] be it done unto me according to Thy Word and when they finish they're still dead and giant Church no fire but no Spirit but no Holy Ghost with the season of Soul hearing men pump intellectual stuff in the head but Peter had the same seed you have in his soul and God tell Peter stop preaching head to the upper room Tower in the city of Jerusalem until I am here this morning until you know making me feel to preach this morning until you've been doing powerful man height oh can the Lord I shout in the house Peter had the same seed you have and when Peter caught up there one day pass he'll get nothing you might be seated to despise nothing happening some Butterfield had to leave he'll feel ready because they shut him up and sit down and shut up there yeah I'll even nowhere because the prophecy is here but stammering lips and another tongue go glory to God they shall come to pass afterwards I'll poured my spirit what can they lost some Praises this morning well glory to God Hallelujah and my Bible tells me when the day of Pentecost was fully come not has come fully come but time and season everybody answer me the time had come the seeds not come the oh I come for another day of Pentecost they were in one man and one Accord and suddenly there was a man coming from America that is fighting I don't know the Bible there was a song from Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind a song from Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind and they were all filled seven somebody shall not fail with the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God do you want to be filled this morning I want to be full of the Holy Ghost Bible Peter full of the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God this one full of the Holy Ghost not partly you know full of the Holy Ghost what can the Lord some praising this morning oh it's the old-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me tell me that old time religion give me that whole time Legend give me that all-time religion it's good enough for me it will save you when you're dying it will set the devil flying or glory to God don't call it a cut but it's good enough for me here oh glory to God at all time oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah worried up Court no we don't caught glory to God may be seated could you imagine the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon you and you walk back to your house and as you hit the front door all them Devils out to the back door they know something happened they know our power enter into the house Glory the God could imagine you walk in a house and you're saying I take every devil in this house under my control and they gather them and I call them get them out cast them out don't get the Lord some praises Glory Glory could be seated when I Revival strike the sisters can't wash your dishes you come back and watch him Duty Wheels oh give the Lord I shall praise God [Applause] Oh Glory the God hallelujah when Revival dishes we need a baptism of the Holy Spirit to change what the emotions the intellects the views the habits the life of the people and put them back on the right ruled again I want to carry this thought all the way through to let us go to a step further have you ever studied the history of revivals no they will get a thought from now a Revival signifies a move of God in power foreign Revival is what a move of God in power and every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fails in the days of the World Revival and most people don't know this the insane asylums fill up quickly there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God it is written that in Wesley's days the people would do most peculiar things that were definitely of Satan to try to mock the goodness and the power of God in Luther's day it is said the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the Catholic church but the Miracle Lane the fact he could and did this song and saying amidst the Fanatics that were almost filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you have been aware this lasting Ministry you would have noticed the same invasion of false and wicked Spirits it has to be that way I hope and trust you are spiritual minding enough to get that it has to be that way amen so I read this there's some services to Jesus Bloomington and Burma talking about he was praying he said that searching the light of God with social Hearts tonight and if there be any unclean thing about us any unbelief in God or his word then cleanse us Lord from all of that that we might once again hear in Illinois see a great trip in Revival Lord we pray that he will start right here in Bloomington it will go Statewide and Nationwide Grant here in among those people the December to get tonight and all these Corporation churches that the power of God will be so manifested in their midst until they will see and take new heart again Grant this college Lord that has let us have this Auditorium the Revival breakout here like in Wheaton and down at Asbury and many of the other places it will be day and night permittance Lord that people will come from the East to the West God give them our old-fashioned John was a Revival a burning Zeal of these young men's heart that would leave the college here that they might go forth like another Asbury and granted father give us thy Grace we dedicate Our Lives to thee and the services to thee all we ask about mentally and physically speak to us father we ask in Jesus name amen so but Branham actually talk about this we are all among the uh the colleges and that sort of thing like that he prayed and so on so then I pointed out about a few things that I observed about it it started Suddenly It's called Serenity it went viral overnight and you know I think the prophet talk about the Holy Ghost will go across the world overnight things will happen across and you know you could wonder why and you can still things develop um the Catholic church I took the Bible from the people and they were preaching in Latin and you know saying all this stuff and things but Martin Luther who wanted pardon and forgiveness he found the Bible and then he started read and then he got the Joshua by faith and that opened the door for the Protestants and then when Jordan Wesley came the Germans invented the printing press around that same time and that's how the Bible gets him to print and now God had the revivalists to run with the Bibles one with the message now because they come like had no Bibles had no word no they get the word the other Spirit don't know so so God had to make man invented press no no no God no The Voice coming William Branham Malachi 4 in days of the voice of the seven Angel so what have man to invent the tape recorder to record the voice so man have to actually get in tune with God's program God no there could be a manifestation where I've heard not just the voice but I see so God make man make video then God make man have the and have the internet that overnight you can get it right there right there right there right there we are the final frontier I heard the Bible talk about emotion Elijah dead in the streets and the whole world will see them talking about television and everything else so we are right here in the frontier praise God he said this because usually I was rumors are Wars but the end is not yet earthquakes and diverse places the end is not yet Nation against Nation or not yet but this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come so this gospel is the most important thing praise God to our norms and Herald the coming of the Lord and the gospel is not the word only but in power and demonstration oh come on preach back to me somebody come on out about the gospel is not the word only glory to caught him in Hallelujah all right this has been viral people come from everywhere all testify about the atmosphere our son is spread to other universities and what do we know from that because remember historically the last great Revival of Charlotte and Branham was the United States Pentecostal right but we never see none in our generation in that sense right and that's not really what performance what we see in there in Asbury but what we know is a Revival is possible we know Revival is Promised with our Revival will go out isn't that right and he's a prophecy hanging over us when the power of this church Rises it will bring the Brethren so there's a prophecy hanging over the bright churches when the power of this church Rises isn't that right brother Brown this is important this age started just as the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost listen carefully because this still applies to know this part here we know that their mass of necessity be a return of dynamic power so that's a given so all this talk and intellectual mystery talk and long talk and forward the talk and information explanation it has to have the dynamic power [Applause] do you get that church I want us to kneel inside of you you know that nobody see there come no sticker come and Slick you with some kind of yeah I have a mystery here you don't know tell him tell him I want to know if it's Christ because Christ is the mystery of God revealed if it's not Christ I don't want it go and sell it somewhere else are you buying because they're selling something let's go we know that there are mass of necessity be a return of dynamic power the Believers sends this in their spirits are you sensing are you sensing in your spirit that's something about the brick I ain't talking about Pope Francis they've had a job to do all right what the believer sends this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century here we go what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not and he explained why the latter in for the lattering can come only after the for marine which is the spring or teaching ring the lattering then is the Harvest ring before I say this way to you for the last 40 years in this message we have had teaching to teaching and false teaching but decisionalism it's Dictionary what is promised is the lettering or Dynamics or inspiration or the spirit itself [Applause] to come upon what has been taught now you can understand when God told the prophet pick up the pen and write the Holy Spirit he said the secret is the wind is in the bright that's a secret that means the bride have to have seed in her and if you have seen in you then only the rain amen Only the Rain could come and manifest and bring forth the contents of that seed you have two C's here they're looking similar one is a pumpkin one is a watermelon I can't tell you difference both of them looking similar the only way to know what is what bury it put you down on the ground watch it with water Let It Grow both have Vine both our Leaf both have everything but when the fruit comes you would notice pumpkin and you know what is watermelon well everybody hearing the message they are books their tips they are this when the rain come you will see who will see who has church and who is pride not the same air Oh Glory to God here man could you see now all right what the lottery in there is the the lattering is the Harvest ring the Harvest rain is when you have the fruit all right how could this be the real thing when the teaching ring had not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people until the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quit under the rapture aha so there is to be a restoration and a final quickening onto the Rapture he's also saying that to the brother there is to be a restoration and a final equipment onto the rapchat.com and it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifested in the Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove it was not real these people even before the second generation appeared organized and wrote the unscriptural doctrines and build their own fences now he says that's the reason today the revivals we're supposed to have we have denomination revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no no no sir don't think we got revivers we haven't they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not really no way the bride prophecy hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stood upright yet we are looking for it this is from the third seal to teach a March 1963. he said we are we are that's a nice time than a quote we are looking for it what you're talking about some bright Revival we are looking for it it will take those seven unknown pandas [Applause] [Music] wake up again how much luck Samson had seven lost what did they do to Samson the maker just share it off but it will take those seven Thunders what happens here after a while those Seven Locks it grow back it was restored if we're attacked walk in the Lord I shout in the house let's protect those seven Thunders so we come back again are you ready he will send it are you ready he promised it we could close our service right there he will send it but I already promised it no I will make these promises he promised it listen [Applause] ing you see the Bible talk about knowledge shall increase Bible talk about God are we Daniel the book is sealed to the time of the end the entire book had to be unsealed but the entire book doesn't connect it to the bride the promises that was unsealed and revealed all that for the bride Catholic Church that handled it bright Roman and and Pope and Los Angeles thinking that's what I'm saying in other words it have already sees in here but have certain seasons inclusive right promise the rest is for the bridesmaid the bright assistant and whatnot his hand under with the bride this we're talking about here is pride of Jesus Christ not the bright assistants who who hold me fail and who all in the world wouldn't flowers for your and fixing your face and that's not that we're talking about you know this is boom and bride okay the Lord I shouting the house why are you talking somewhere over because the Bible is at his wife not the others his wife have made herself ready then she had to see something to take up she had to see the clothes of the word and dress herself and robe herself in the clothes of the promised word [Music] spice got made himself ready Hallelujah he's talking about the sea what does he jump up like that for he said there's a Revival the same amount of water but he's got a Revival what does it do it floats all the trash up on the shore we need a scoring out once in a while God give us a Revival and a sweeping Mighty Wind rushes down through the church like that and flows all the trash out of her God purifies Us by the Holy Spirit God purifies us by the Holy Spirit that's why somebody could get baptized dry Sinner and come up a wet one praise God because the snake that make them do what they do still there praise God I give my heart to Jesus Hallelujah before and whatnot that's nice but you went down in the water and come back up but that's not the end of the process fire when John the Baptist was introducing they asked John are you the one he said me they want to come in and I'm not even worried to lose his shoes he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire you don't hear that much because the people don't want to talk about it it has something called fire of the Holy Ghost we'll give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this is not trumpet and violence this morning this is fire of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Seven Seals and the Seven Seals and you have to know the Mysteries and some Seas where the mystery of God come down from God as the word of God and when the world become flesh and you the invisible become visible Oh Glory all the Mysteries ever become flesh all the Mysteries become flesh inside of you who could condemn me of sin when the word is living through me hey do you get that though when man talk in mystery the mystery walking in flesh man talking about you oh Glory the God and the Word was made flesh and fellow Mars or can the Lord I shout Hallelujah Jesus Jesus was in the Psalms Jesus was in the prophets Jesus was in the prophecy they're talking about Messiah coming but one day Mary conceive bring forth the Messiah and when Jesus walk on your head it was all the Psalms it was all the prophets everything they promised I about it was living in front of them that's why he come and say the spirit is upon me because he had anointed me this day the scripture is fulfilled oh give the Lord a shout in the house good morning [Applause] you wonder why do you need a Revival what brings that rough water like that a wind coming the wind that's roughly water up cause the seats are rough up and they're taking the trash and hitting it against the shot this is what he said you know he said he said that makes a Revival when the Holy Ghost comes like a Russian Mighty Wind it brings a Revival notice on a nice preacher nice thoughts and ideas he said watch it brings a Revival what did the Rival do in the lake every bit of trash on the lake was washed out on the bank that is what we need a Revival for to wash some of the whirly trash listen out of the Holy Ghost Church [Music] [Applause] what we need a Revival for is to wash some of the worldly trash out of the Holy Ghost Church we need a Russian Mighty Wind come from heaven some of the world international trash is brought with it he said he said but it's the truth he said watch that's what the church needs is a Revival to shake from all the willingness and the things of the world and bring back Purity Holiness of God in the hearts of the Believers humility that's a big one that's a big Bond because we have encountered so much arrogant proud people that's a big one because God looking for somebody that the more He blesses the more humble becomes because usually when God bless people they get arrogant they get puffed up two little blessing and they head up in the head if the rainfall they're drunk watch this why man assume they don't get a Revival once in a while in their Spirit they become so carnal and so indifferent till they get self-styled statue and self-righteous brother humble sweet and nice hours Sunday go gamer blessing he find this you know what I seen I always see things and I see it so you really Church move in all the time you come you're born inside the church moving but you know I was among some friends and you know he was talking critical critical theory critical thinking you better go and flush it down later you better begin to believe the word and say Yes Amen to the world you know stop being a critical thinking yeah just let your mind just get away from that and say God you said it I believe it that's it have to come to pass this is what they promised [Applause] self-righteous and if you think brother make a Mystic but those words here this next statement they read and study and that's good talking about yeah the books the other tips not good the person play but I know what we're talking about read and study that's not what you're talking about he said it's good to know the word but it's better to know the order of the word you ever say no then he going deeper that little something that you leave out that's something in the heart that makes you what you are that's the thing and that's the thing that I like about having a Revival it shakes it jumps it jerks it around until all the drops get out and that's what a Revival have people talk about the heart being cleansed the bitten is coming out and I hear testimonies and different things from even what in Asbury right now young people and you know young people they they hardly get a younger person that is very hypocritical they're very straight they open they say the thing they weighs and whatnot the big people they could do Hollywood they could act they could perform and they could nothing on there and pretend and all kind of thing but young people have to pretend about this is it this is it this is really to them and if it's really real to them getting through something real amen I don't mind I think every time I'm talking about the guy I see outside in the park somewhere telling some people have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that was such a blessing to me to hear that outside but you know allow me said I'm outside preaching very hungry have you received the Holy Ghost telling since you believe how God said it and bow your heads and close your eyes if they want to receive the Holy Ghost hope glory to God come and let me lay hands upon you oh God I was like music to my soul Oh Glory to God you have to love the gospel you have to love the word you have to love God's people you have to love the cause they can just sit get dead and do that from examination come on not even Football let's get this kind of thing cricket [Applause] in football there's pain in the face of the country Colin what kind of thing where the country when the country lose when the country loses the place so another fire and burn Bunch shops and all that kind of thing they feel it the feeling of the feeling they lost they want a masterpiece team they want to Club them and all kind of thing like that but you have to feel this thing too you have to feel Christ Hallelujah I come to prompt you and push and program you may be seated I hope this aspirating provoke you a bit because they go in there nature I know how they're doing it they have a lot of gas there buddy people going and coming going and coming going and coming the second like 24 hours inspiration no gospel no preaching no wait nothing read two scriptures and he's a woman in pants or anything like that ring and where they're singing and they love Jesus that's what they know but they're sincere they love the Lord and that sincerity is what God will see and deal with their own hearts I can't judge all the characters around that but there are sincere people that are going on the bless that God will deliver that God gonna heal that God could be free and I believe there are things that people here this morning and what we cover this morning is not in in vain God know your heart [Applause] [Music] and that's the way a Revival is to let us come into the spirit of the Lord and rejoice and make rooms right on a closer walk and a reconsecration and a dedication until all the things and doubts of the world are thrown out onto the bank that's what our Revival is for so we need that I can't be in every house every home everywhere you walk everything you do I say you are you but you are what you are when you're by yourself when you have a Revival nobody look over you you know you recept you revive on the inside you cry not to God you talking to God you doing your own personal consecration you are coming to church for fire you're bringing your fire from home you bringing it to church you bringing your flag you bringing your praise you bring in your song Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God and they're coming to rejoice yeah coming Like A sower [Music] you're a lead you lead mama said Rejoice Evermore for this is the will of God [Music] why are you rejoicing not when things good when things back to the devil don't know if you're up or down because when things badly rejoicing when things go to Rejoice him you rejoice like him he doesn't exist because all things work together for good to them that love God God helped me this morning Oh Glory Rejoice ever more [Applause] you start a worship not because you're feeling good you're worship because he is God worship is not about you it's about him it's who he is for Glory to God Oh Glory to God when the woman will tell Jesus he said dude they said Jerusalem is afraid of worship and whatnot he said you know what what you worship you said the fact that our common now is and the father seeketh true worshipers father he's not Pastor father seeking two worshipers who must Worship in spirit and in truth the Pentecostal couldn't do that when that Spirit 1906 because the truth didn't come forth yet God sent a prophet with truth now you as Pride have the opportunity to correctly worship with spirit and Truth [Applause] I want to hear how big I am and than that you have an opportunity to give the father correct worship in spirit [Music] and in truth Oh Glory the court of children's loss for seven generations for Seven Ages rather but God sends seven angels from eternity the cattle all the scattered word to bring it back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost that's the objective of them seven angels foreign did you hear that maybe he's eaten sometimes I speak a little fast so I'll slow down that you will get it he said God sin is a quote now seven angels from eternity to gather up all this scattered wood to tie it back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost not for us to get more worried as they get holy ghosts Oh Glory to God what did you first just had Holy Ghost what Peter had Holy Ghost with all the Holy Ghost he denied Jesus Christ hold out with holy ghosts get this right upside down forgive the Lord I shout you need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost we've got to have the Holy Ghost [Applause] s he said that's what the church needs it needs a Revival and what starts this wind what starts this going on this revival there comes a wind it's another Mighty Russian winter start a Revival and beat the trash out the church be the trash out the church remember this is a Shepherd dream with a rock box and a pour in the water and he said cannot hold that that water is the Holy Ghost nothing but holy holy holy ghost you could pour in the honey which is broadly kindness and behold that he said but the Holy Ghost was picking up all the trash as it rolls off the mountain to the box it was picking up all the Trashies that were the Holy Ghost does then he said the Holy Ghost is poured out in individuals not the church I can't hold it so it get individuals could hold it not a church so you can't say this church of it this is to have it that's a lie that's a lie you cannot say this church have it the manager don't have it because the Holy Ghost is held by individuals so the Holy Ghost could pour out this morning and point into individuals you feel the atmosphere in the church but according individuals or Chloe the thought if you hear that you should be shouting that mean at me hey nobody could stop you this morning from getting your blessing nobody this morning to stop you Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Glory my God I like these shelter here in this morning this morning you know what I can say

it is one bring a message of this brand new Holy Spirit baptism into a dry formal creedy Church you just can't do it and that's why we say holy ghost can fall and dry if you're dead you're dead you

was background training to make me what I am today that is why I am how I am because of that that desert one preacher company said that that place behind God's back it was behind goes back but I said I get a training so now I hit this line here no you can't bring me no stories because we have stories that's right all right let me see about the wrap up here now he said no watch something and I want to say this that our great move the Church of the Living God in this nation has become a two factions one of them is going so stiff and starchy and intellectual and the other one went Plum off deep end on the other side fanatic so I'm going flying over loose he said but there's a middle way it's a middle ground church I want you on that middle ground almost done now a minister kind of being a Revival there's no preach can bring a Revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is just be as loyal to God and his word and the Revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now Revival isn't adding new members it's Reviving what we've already got so Revival is to revive what's inside of you when you first come to the Lord you have a hungry for God a passion for God a love for God people and whatnot when I get in trouble in my early Christian walk I say Lord and I see God deliver me and bring me out well anytime I get something else I say Lord deliver me in that one you have to leave me in this one and it's a wonder how we get to me after this one now and every time you ever see God giving a breakthrough after breakthrough he's teaching you he is guiding you he is leading you you know God was with you [Applause] now you're doing like if that never happened my Lord okay let's go he said no what we've seen happen should put every soul in action prophecy coming here now it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Phoenix that people would be flying from Europe to see what they can place so what is he saying a re-revival people are flying disease people come from different places to see each you know a reviver break out no people take a plane to come to that that's the power of God they're talking about that's cancer being healed coming out of the wheelchair that is deaf hearing blind cm oh Chloe that's the move of God that is tongues interpretation that is prophecy you say every gift will be back in the church before we leave here if we speak in tongues no because everyone Pentecostal but tongues is the word prophecy is the word healing is the word give of knowledge is the word all these gifts God have is in the word we need every one of them I want everyone in the church well give the Lord some praises they are nine gifts we want everyone in the church watch it should make a church ever make a Revival in Phoenix that people would fly in from Europe to see what's taking place they will say there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out dear until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that is not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested Oh Glory the court praise God people don't want mystery truths and these seven voices and everything else but there's another pact it have two parts Revelation part and manifestation part why you don't hear the emphasis on the manifestation part there are seven times to be manifested people will come to see the manifestation this is that that the prophet William Branham spake of look at the Lord I shout not some plane some tape on a Sunday morning but this is that that the prophet William Branham speak of Hallelujah Glory glory to God are refreshing your mind are refreshing your spirit with these promises all right praise God Jesus says here to this mountain you have heard what's taken place that's the ministry we are entering into we are way up the road now prophecy coming here now is the prophet we have in him he's a prophet it doesn't what's a prophecy yeah what is it soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we have got to have Rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkle of an eye to go out or we will not go but don't worry he said don't worry don't worry it will be there it will be there he said it twice and then he prophesied and when the power of this church Rises and we prophesied this morning when the power of this headstone Tabernacle Church Rises Oh Glory love God hallelujah here we go when the power of this church Rises it will bring its Brethren the power of that church Rises it will bring its Brethren the power of the dark Church Rises it'll bring you out of bedroom then there'll be a general Resurrection you may be seated glory to God you'd have no Rapture without no power Oh Glory to God hallelujah he's a National Force put Israel back

upon thee hey oh Gloria God Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because I'm sending a message Sans if he could do anything because you have anointing because you have a gift because God bless him because you have a covenant if he can lie and get away with it Samson fully sign up on the seated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what Abraham says what's going to happen there's one glorious thing that I can take off the end this text while Samson was born he said we can't have a Revival listen at our loyal brother Billy Graham Reviving all day listen to all robots revive another day listen the rest of them we find all day how can we have a Revival when we are born we have bung the Holy Ghost with our organization and traditions remember what he said the Holy Ghost was born at the river Euphrates trapped by interpretation in them the Holy Ghost can move because they run their own electric wire and when the Holy Ghost looking for room to move who do this Plumbing because the word is the conduct of the spirit and they look real nice and pretty for the church Holy Ghost can move because the word don't forget that is the conductor of the spirit that's why when man of God through faithful Ministry becomes the word they become the contractor of the spirit and God will say there is my spirit flowing freely man who have died out Man Who Sold out to everything else until themselves become a conductor imagine so when when Once Whenever there is man's idea in it holy ghost is trapped for the ghost can't move until you get back to the wood again oh Hallelujah are you with me all right now watch he says we are born the Holy Spirit without organization and traditions and we can't have a holy ghost Revival I know that is scorching hot with the weather but it's the truth how can we have a holy ghost Revival when you are born and starchy form of goodness in the messaging his baptism but just be talking about it we don't want message folks making sure that it's clear I ain't talking about this Methodist Saints having a form of godliness will deny the power of the power of what the power of organization no the power of the world the power of the church the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secret place in the church the Holy Ghost is the secret place in the church and when the church adopts educated preachers big buildings finally instead of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost they'll be better off in a mission again how are you gonna revive in the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bung it and afraid of it Philistines Dundee but the one blessed hope we have while Samson was in jail what's the first thing they've done when they caught him they bung him fools they took his power away they found a secret they found your secret the world found your secret now you women all Bob you're here goes the world you men go out and act like the world tell jokes dirty jokes smoke a few cigarettes run with neighbors wives have a little sociable drink and hold your job I rattle in my belly soda crackers and drink Branch water and stay clean and pure before God than to compromise for any kind of a job Samson the Philistines Dundee [Music] but the Branham is not rebuking his own church Branham Tabernacle whirlyism is creeping in among you what about it have you exposed your secret how you expose the secret that God gave you when you were valuing there and you saw this a few years ago have you let it creep out my social formal worship this is social formal worship where's that foreign with that I can't go take a nap never be Russian when when John Saudi lamb take the book what and then 24 hours you know the message supposed to look [Music] we're supposed to look divided that what David the wife thought she was to be as king

Afflicted to sign the Wonders and preach this word as hard as they can by the Holy Ghost and people say well I guess that's all right that time we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired he said that's Branham Tabernacle the Philistine is on D ude he's saying when used to be when preaching the word of God the old Saints With Tears in their eyes with rise to their feet and walk you know since with the head tingling I didn't expect brother to say anything this morning was not Asbury I ain't come here no Revival we we see Russia making ready to make nuclear thingy and

associated with the world when you let the world creep in you go to acting like the world then you are finished but when you cut loose every fetter from the world and come to God will use you until you go to Fulton again here's the only hope that I have this morning to wind up my message while Samson was born a new shocker here grow it out hey I don't care what happened in your past your past
