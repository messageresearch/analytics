[21:10] of Carnival and
[21:11] Attilan carrying on or whatnot you could
[21:13] come today to hear the word of God and I
[21:17] believe in my heart we have a word from
[21:19] the Lord for you something what worked
[21:23] upon my spirit and I had it for three
[21:26] weeks now I never approached it before
[21:28] and Wednesday before what we're gonna go
[21:29] into it today so we wanna stand for the
[21:33] reading of the word as you want to go
[21:35] into the scriptures want to go to
[21:37] Jeremiah chapter 18 was 406 Romans
[21:42] chapter 9 verse 11 to 23 2nd Timothy
[21:47] chapter 2 19 to 21 praise God
[22:02] we didn't from Jeremiah chapter 18 1 to
[22:07] 6 the word which came the Jeremiah from
[22:14] the Lord seen arise and go down to the
[22:18] potter's house and there I will cause
[22:21] thee to hear my words then I went down
[22:24] to the potter's house and behold he
[22:28] brought a work on the wheels and the
[22:32] vessel that he made of clay was mad in
[22:36] the hand of the Potter so he made it
[22:40] again another vessel a seemed good to
[22:44] the Potter to make it then the word of
[22:48] the Lord came to me saying o house of
[22:51] Israel cannot I do with you as this
[22:55] Potter said the Lord behold as the clay
[23:00] is in the Potters han-soo ie in my hand
[23:04] o house of Israel Romans chapter 9 on
[23:09] the read from verse 11
[23:19] see it's thinking about Esau and Jacob
[23:24] for the children not being here for the
[23:28] children being not yet born neither
[23:31] having done any good or evil that the
[23:35] purpose of God according to election
[23:38] might stand not of works but of him that
[23:43] call it it was said unto her the elder
[23:47] shall serve the younger as it is written
[23:51] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[23:54] what shall we see then is there
[23:58] unrighteousness with God god forbid for
[24:02] he said to Moses I will have mercy on
[24:04] whom I will have mercy and I will have
[24:07] compassion on whom I will have
[24:10] compassion so then it is not of him that
[24:13] will let know of him that runneth but of
[24:17] God that showed mercy for the scripture
[24:22] said unto Pharaoh even for this same
[24:25] purpose have I raised the up that I
[24:29] might show my power in thee and that my
[24:33] name might be declared throughout all
[24:36] the earth therefore had him mercy on
[24:39] whom he will have mercy on whom he will
[24:42] harden that he had met thou will see
[24:45] unto me why that he had find fault
[24:48] for who had resisted his will
[24:52] nay but o man who a dog that replies
[24:56] against God shall the team formed say to
[25:00] him that formed it why has thou made me
[25:03] thus had not the putter power over the
[25:06] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[25:10] on the honour and another unto dishonour
[25:14] what if God willing to show his wrath
[25:18] and to make his power known endured with
[25:21] much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[25:25] fitted to destruction and that he might
[25:28] make known
[25:30] the riches of his glory on the vessels
[25:32] of Lizzie which he had afore prepared
[25:35] unto glory our last scriptures from 2nd
[25:39] Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 to 21
[25:51] nevertheless the foundation of God
[25:54] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[25:57] knoweth them that are his let everyone
[26:01] that name it the name of Christ depart
[26:04] from iniquity but in the house they are
[26:07] not only vessels of gold and of silver
[26:10] but also of wood and of Earth some to
[26:14] honor some to dishonor if a man
[26:18] therefore purge himself from these he
[26:23] shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified
[26:26] and meat for the Masters use and
[26:29] prepared unto every good world let us
[26:32] pray Almighty God we thank you for your
[26:34] Holy Scriptures and I pray that you
[26:37] would inspire to our hearts
[26:39] I pray you take this lump of clay and
[26:41] speak through it Lord anoint me and
[26:44] anoint the people to hear your world may
[26:47] we see what you show Jeremiah Leah
[26:49] shores as you told him to arise and go
[26:52] down to the potter's house anoint us we
[26:55] pray in Jesus and we ask it he men may
[26:59] you be even be seated
[27:00] go praise the name of the Lord blessed
[27:04] be the rock of our salvation so give the
[27:09] Lord some praises
[27:10] [Applause]
[27:19] so this morning our title come down to
[27:26] the potter's house potato this morning
[27:30] the subject the purpose of God according
[27:35] to election that's a subject purpose of
[27:39] God a college election I have an
[27:41] inspiration a work on the wheels you
[27:49] know we're talking about there but we're
[27:51] getting it work on the wheels okay let's
[27:56] go
[27:57] so have a little backdrop here I want to
[27:59] share with you but a brand I'm speaking
[28:02] about the ephesians church age Ephesus
[28:05] the very name emphasis has a strange
[28:09] compound meaning it means aimed at
[28:12] unrelaxed the high aspiration of this
[28:16] age that had begun with the fullness of
[28:20] the Spirit and he call that the depth of
[28:23] God so the depth of God is the fullness
[28:28] of the Spirit
[28:30] remember these brothers Peter and all
[28:33] these other brothers they were ignorant
[28:35] and unlearned so then couldn't talk all
[28:38] kind of mystery talk and intellectual
[28:41] talk they were filled with God in so
[28:45] much that they reproduce God they were
[28:50] called arms and ears and mouth on the
[28:53] earth there were God eyes on the earth
[28:56] so when a NASA fire came lying in the
[28:59] church they were dead they got killed
[29:02] because God was veiled in that man
[29:05] called Peter
[29:08] isn't that right so the high aspirations
[29:11] age that begun with the fullness of the
[29:14] spirit the depth of God whereby they
[29:17] were aiming at the high calling of God
[29:19] begin to give away to a less watchful
[29:23] attitude and as soon as it began with a
[29:27] less watchful attitude your life begin
[29:30] to tip deteriorate your Christian walk
[29:33] because you tear it because you have to
[29:35] be guarded you have to be watchful
[29:38] because your wrath not against flesh and
[29:40] blood but against principalities against
[29:43] powers against spiritual wickedness so
[29:46] even though you walk in this ordinary
[29:48] world that seems normal and natural it
[29:51] have demons from hell and you're over
[29:55] true your destruction
[29:59] planning your captivity so you have to
[30:02] walk wise redeeming the time for the
[30:05] days are evil Oh hallelujah
[30:08] so when you come to church I come not
[30:10] just to be empowered to get wisdom to be
[30:13] inspired to be anointed that is why you
[30:17] come to church hallelujah hallelujah so
[30:23] the passion to know the word the cracker
[30:25] gets in the spirit the vermin is that
[30:27] the pre-scored
[30:28] that become the wax coal in people's
[30:30] lives and they just began to go to
[30:32] church
[30:35] not going to hear from God going to do
[30:39] their duty unless odd and fallen of
[30:49] Jesus Christ begin to manifest itself as
[30:50] an omen in the future ages the physical
[30:54] vehicle called Church would sink to the
[31:00] awfulness of the depth of satan who
[31:04] thought the church would move from the
[31:06] depth of God to the death of stated but
[31:09] still remain church today move from the
[31:14] depth of God fullness of the Spirit to
[31:17] the depth of Sita it had become relaxed
[31:24] and was drifting already the edge was
[31:29] backsliding it has left its first love
[31:32] the tiny seed planted on ephesians age
[31:36] will one day grow into a the spirit of
[31:38] error until all falsehood of the
[31:42] evolutionist branches so inoffensive to
[31:45] human reasoning that little plant
[31:48] appeared to that new evil the new church
[31:50] and she would be received by satan the
[31:54] Ephesians is have presented to her the
[31:57] opportunity for God's best because when
[32:00] God scatterwork he started for in Tepito
[32:03] best because his work reflects his
[32:07] workmanship is worth reflect who hears
[32:10] his work reflects his character his
[32:13] nature this being this very person
[32:17] God is perfect and is what gonna be
[32:21] perfect so he expected the chance to be
[32:24] glorious the expected the church to be
[32:26] powerful he expected it just to be
[32:29] anointed yet smoke ever judge out the
[32:32] foot on the neck of the enemies
[32:34] [Applause]
[32:41] hallelujah he didn't expect you to say a
[32:44] prayer he expects to be prayin he
[32:47] expected to be caught in that demo on
[32:48] average with your prayer and on your
[32:51] prayer your lieutenant and his face
[32:52] you're gettin in here they're giving it
[32:55] back to him
[32:56] [Applause]
[33:05] the Ephesian danger presented her the
[33:08] opportunity for the gods best and for
[33:11] while she prevailed then relaxed and in
[33:14] that unguarded moment
[33:16] Seaton planted the seed of complete
[33:19] ruination in other words that Church got
[33:23] pregnant with the wrong seed and the
[33:26] life of that seed biggest unfold and
[33:29] brought it right down to the depths of
[33:31] Sita the very religion of Ephesus types
[33:37] all perfectly the first church is and
[33:39] sets the tenor of the ages to come
[33:42] there's gonna just go bounce quickly I
[33:45] want to skip that don't buy the fish
[33:50] tight IRA the resume of the ages he said
[33:54] since the fifth age aha here we go
[33:57] listen brought a dissemination of the
[34:00] word who printed because the printed
[34:03] press was invented in leutis time I
[34:06] believe it was so before they couldn't
[34:08] spread the word God make them they
[34:10] invented printing press so you get the
[34:12] word in print and with the word and
[34:14] printing out the wizard to spread all
[34:16] that is God's purpose just as God said
[34:19] in the days of the voice one of the next
[34:21] science they invent the audio tape to
[34:23] get the prophets voice isn't that right
[34:26] God letting that stop them nothing stop
[34:28] him he's got the control things
[34:30] he's involving things he's gonna make
[34:33] sure you get it
[34:34] waiting board of five fold ministry
[34:35] right thing got out passes and teachers
[34:38] and prophet waiting what have all these
[34:39] things for you to be be your own God no
[34:42] because God have a purpose the church
[34:44] become a vehicle to reconnect you with
[34:47] God not reconnected the church church is
[34:50] church that's what the devil use God is
[34:54] the word
[34:55] [Music]
[34:55] [Applause]
[34:57] then come at the joint church they're
[35:00] coming for the word
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:08] so watch this age watch this it was the
[35:12] second stage of the restoration and as
[35:15] we have stated previously was the tassel
[35:17] age education abounded this was the age
[35:21] of the intellectual men who love God and
[35:24] serve Him
[35:25] missionaries abundant on the world
[35:27] spread over the world it was the age of
[35:29] brotherly love it was the age of the
[35:31] open door it was the age a long duration
[35:34] and after it the loudest an age will
[35:37] come which would be a short one the true
[35:40] vine flourish in this age as in no other
[35:44] when one think of the numbers at woman
[35:46] abroad this age but holy men to the
[35:49] forefront the true vine spread and the
[35:53] false vine receded the world was pumping
[35:57] doesn't print it on work isn't testimony
[36:00] Gauri's up a lot of holy men and they
[36:01] were running the gospel isn't that right
[36:04] hadn't the true vine on the run the
[36:06] false man on the run everywhere the true
[36:08] vine when God gave light and life and
[36:11] happiness
[36:13] the fourth fight was showed up for what
[36:15] it was
[36:16] darkness misery poverty illiteracy and
[36:21] debt and as the false vine in its day of
[36:26] power could not kill the to vine neither
[36:29] to the true vine no bring back the false
[36:33] find the Jesus Christ so this thing
[36:36] working to ease default Concord of the
[36:39] truth and the chuka convinced divorce
[36:41] isn't that right but the first vine here
[36:45] we go and changed itself
[36:47] waiting for the last part of the last
[36:51] age when it would win back all except
[36:54] that small flock that elect the fine of
[36:58] God so that false vine was with him he
[37:00] lasted he just hanging in his sideline
[37:02] waited and change everybody tied him up
[37:05] in deception
[37:07] only the elect will not be receive
[37:13] how's that does this is make us feel as
[37:17] we realize that every great move of God
[37:20] neglected to true off the Nicollet and
[37:23] doctrine for the all organized and died
[37:27] remember what a nickel eaten is it's the
[37:30] conquer the laity its to conquer the
[37:33] people it's the Detroit the Holy Ghost
[37:36] and impose man rulership over the Church
[37:38] of God that was the nickel eaten and
[37:41] that's what we have a Pope today because
[37:43] the spirit was removed and they say we
[37:45] want that man let us be the leader
[37:47] remember Israel they wanted a king and
[37:51] Samuel came to them
[37:54] why you want the king God is a king Oh
[37:56] hallelujah God told Samuel they have not
[38:00] rejected you they have rejected me they
[38:03] say they want a melody or a chives they
[38:05] want somebody to put as a leader no a
[38:08] king was coming
[38:09] David was coming but that was God's
[38:11] appointed time what are the purpose went
[38:13] to give him a king but they wanted a
[38:15] king and God give them soul Oh
[38:17] hallelujah injured in the Bassin God I
[38:21] want you to have no other gods before
[38:22] him he must be your Lord and your God
[38:26] there is no mediator between man and God
[38:29] there is no cipher between man and God
[38:31] the fifl ministries are bringing worth
[38:33] and let you back to God because you are
[38:36] sons and daughters of the Living God
[38:39] oh I let me hallelujah so now they all
[38:47] move in the denomination denominations
[38:49] to hold the spiritually dead in food
[38:52] less pastures literally they know but
[38:55] each group was tainted with the same
[38:58] error I when the revival fire burn low
[39:02] organization took over and the people
[39:04] became denominations there were only
[39:06] nominal Christians though it who claimed
[39:10] the various short seemed assurance as
[39:12] Roman Catholic Church that they were
[39:14] right and all others wrong every group
[39:17] claiming the right everybody was wrong
[39:18] the stage was truly set for the
[39:21] daughters to go back home in the last
[39:23] age back to room under the mother him as
[39:27] we come to the last age the laude sage
[39:30] this is our age we know it's the last
[39:34] age of Judah back in Palestine no matter
[39:36] how they got there the idea this is the
[39:40] harvest time but before there can be a
[39:43] harvest there has to be a lightening a
[39:47] maturing of both the vines the median
[39:50] age was springtime the Western eve of
[39:53] the summer of growth the Lao decent age
[39:55] is the harvest time of gathering the
[39:59] chairs dining and building and garden a
[40:02] wheat for the Lord how is that notice
[40:04] that in the harvest time there is a real
[40:08] acceleration in reitman and there is
[40:11] unsecret li a slowing of growth so in
[40:14] other words there come a point the car
[40:16] grow no more growth max out then the
[40:19] fruit begin to ripen an acceleration of
[40:22] ripeness
[40:23] and a deceleration of growth Oh
[40:25] hallelujah praise what that is what
[40:27] harvest time represent is not what we
[40:30] are seeing who oh praise the name of the
[40:32] Lord it harvest time then they must come
[40:35] upon the scene in this age doors who
[40:39] would bring wheat and tears to maturity
[40:43] the tears are already maturing very fast
[40:46] on the corrupt
[40:47] teachers that turn the people from the
[40:50] word but the wheat also must mature and
[40:53] to her God is done in the profit
[40:55] messenger with the vindicated missile
[40:57] ministry that he might be accepted by
[40:59] the elect they believe him as the first
[41:03] church who'd Paul she will mature in the
[41:08] word until becoming a word bride the
[41:12] mighty works will be found in her dad
[41:16] always attendant upon the pure Word of
[41:18] God and feet oh my the false church
[41:21] would come together with a will conquer
[41:23] churches and they reckon image unto the
[41:26] Beast the Beast deceiveth the whole
[41:28] earth by means of those miracles he had
[41:31] power to give life unto the image of the
[41:33] peace and the image of the beast should
[41:34] speak and cause as many as to worship
[41:37] the image of the Beast should be killed
[41:38] and causeth all both small and great
[41:40] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[41:43] mark in their right hand in their
[41:44] foreheads that no man by ourselves
[41:47] see if he that have the mark of the
[41:48] beast no remember it was Imperial Rome
[41:52] that fell by the sword but she was
[41:55] healed of a dead stroke when she joined
[41:57] the nominal Christian Church and room
[42:00] and incorporated Piggin ISM and
[42:02] Christianity and thereby become the
[42:04] Roman Empire which we'll enjoy until
[42:07] Jesus come and destroyer but Rome is not
[42:10] going in alone her daughters are right
[42:12] with her and she will take over absolute
[42:16] authority by the World Council of
[42:19] Churches here we go are you ready this
[42:23] may seem far-fetched the Sun but
[42:28] actually it is very plain for all to see
[42:31] because right now the churches are
[42:34] controlling politics and at the
[42:37] opportune time time will manifest itself
[42:41] exactly how great is the control this
[42:45] economical move will end up with Rome as
[42:47] the head even though people did not
[42:50] envision it that way aha
[42:53] you've been there not expecting that no
[42:55] they're not even looking for that but he
[42:57] said it's gonna be that
[42:59] that is where it is headed because both
[43:01] wood can't feel is none right
[43:03] that is because revelation 17:3 16
[43:06] states that's the Mystery Babylon
[43:08] is seated on the piece she is
[43:10] controlling the last or default Empire
[43:13] the mark of the beast means they will
[43:17] have to take the doctrine of the church
[43:19] system which is trinitarianism and the
[43:22] mock and hand will means to do the will
[43:25] of the rule Church with this great power
[43:28] the church system with this great power
[43:31] are you listening the church systems
[43:34] will persecute the true right this image
[43:39] will try to keep the bride from
[43:42] preaching and teaching etc how ministers
[43:46] will be forbidden to give comfort and
[43:47] truth to the people who need it but
[43:49] before the Antichrist and person takes
[43:51] over this complete wolf system of
[43:54] churches the true ban will be taken away
[43:56] with from this world to be with the Lord
[43:59] God will catch away his bride for this
[44:02] great marriage supper of the Lamb oh
[44:04] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[44:08] thank you Jesus
[44:09] Oh glory to God give him some praises
[44:13] people
[44:19] from the tyrant ehh revision 223 codes
[44:23] and I will kill her children with death
[44:25] and all the churches shall know that I
[44:28] am he would sit at the reins and hats
[44:30] and I will give unto every one of you
[44:33] according to your works God looks on the
[44:38] heart that has never changed
[44:42] remember what three weeks ago I preached
[44:44] on the right kind of a son and I was
[44:47] talking about Gordon talk about
[44:48] mysteries and teachings and revelations
[44:50] if that be so Peter who carried on right
[44:52] what is Peters condition but guess what
[44:55] he had faith in Him virtue and him
[44:57] knowledge in him he had life in him he
[44:59] had the word in him all the mysteries
[45:01] was in him the hidden ones through all
[45:03] of that was locked up inside of him what
[45:08] was looking at what was asked at his
[45:10] behavior because your behavior is what
[45:12] put you on your path to adoption
[45:14] now how much enter your head but how
[45:16] much come out of your heart
[45:18] isn't that right so let's go go look on
[45:22] the heart you never change neither will
[45:24] it ever change here as though all the
[45:26] ages are two groups proclaiming the
[45:28] revelation from God and their
[45:30] relationship to God nevertheless the
[45:33] foundation of God standeth sure having
[45:34] this seal the Lord knoweth them which
[45:38] are here's the Lord Sutch at the reins
[45:41] the would search means to track follow
[45:44] up God track down our torts which is all
[45:47] reins he knows what is in our hearts he
[45:49] sees our works which are definite
[45:52] manifestation of what lie within us that
[45:59] is not fake news that is expression was
[46:05] on the inside what does that your works
[46:08] so things have to come for us to produce
[46:11] something that we can see what's inside
[46:13] of us isn't that right it is out of the
[46:17] hat that precedes righteousness or
[46:18] wickedness our motives our purposes are
[46:21] all known unto him as he watches every
[46:24] action and every action every word shall
[46:26] be brought in the judgment then the
[46:27] accountant of our lives
[46:29] given there was no fear of God before
[46:31] the false rain and dearly shall they pee
[46:34] let him who named his name live as
[46:38] become its sins we might fool the people
[46:41] but we will never fool the Lord could I
[46:45] continue the promise in these dark days
[46:48] and he quote the scripture erosion 2:24
[46:51] but I see unto thee but under UIC and
[46:54] unto the rest of tyre as many as have
[46:57] not this doctrine which have not learned
[46:59] the depth of Satan as they speak I will
[47:02] put on you not on a burden but that wish
[47:05] you already hold fast till I come now
[47:08] before we go into the promise this is
[47:10] brother Branham let me show you again
[47:13] show again the church has spoken by the
[47:15] spirit in this book as two vines whose
[47:19] into wine and branches composing but I
[47:22] say unto you and under the resin tight
[47:25] area as many as have not destruction
[47:27] there it is he is speaking to two groups
[47:30] this is the backdrop of coming down to
[47:33] the but ourselves so no we enrich apart
[47:36] associate we on our way there we talking
[47:39] about the church right now Oh hallelujah
[47:41] he is speaking to two groups one has the
[47:46] doctrine and another has not there they
[47:49] are scattered abroad across the nations
[47:52] with each other doctrine opposing the
[47:54] other this is doctrine one is of God
[47:57] knowing his depths and the other of
[48:00] Satan knowing the depths of Satan
[48:04] that's incredible isn't it Tombo church
[48:07] now a little more unbelievers at of a
[48:10] church now depth of God depth of Satan I
[48:13] will put you I will put upon you none
[48:19] other burden the word for burden is
[48:22] wheat or pressure the pressure of the
[48:25] Dark Ages was either bend or be broken
[48:29] bow or die
[48:32] it was the Inquisition the power of the
[48:37] Empire back
[48:39] upsie tonic worship be organized or pay
[48:42] for your life with your life each age
[48:45] had expression for example a great
[48:50] burden of the last age asana a great
[48:55] burden of the last age is the pressure
[48:58] of riches soft living and nervous
[49:03] tensions dizzy probabilities right here
[49:15] this is it right here I found that this
[49:20] is it right here it will go nowhere else
[49:22] this is it right here
[49:23] for example our Great Britain's of the
[49:27] landscape is the pressure of riches
[49:30] which is you want to buy buy buy spend
[49:34] spend spend improve improve you can't
[49:37] wait to get money to spend and is
[49:40] oppression
[49:40] what about how much to buy where to buy
[49:45] be kind to buy who buying just like you
[49:48] who you want to buy like the pressure
[49:56] soft living I mean the pillow fluffy
[50:09] not much as we had a long time you takin
[50:11] be tougher fight my mattress afterwards
[50:14] the other ticket and beat that bun could
[50:16] stuff that back and lie down on that is
[50:20] no burden for church nobody in the
[50:24] comment time no wonder worship you can
[50:28] team afford to miss the song service
[50:30] because it's some service give you an
[50:32] opportunity to give worship to God if
[50:37] you come and sit down for just word how
[50:41] do you get in the spirit that's what the
[50:42] song service that's why we're bringing a
[50:44] minstrel the Prophet was angry he was
[50:49] upset he's a billion Minister make some
[50:51] music here now
[50:52] cheesy atmosphere created was hell I
[50:55] could move into the spirit and then you
[50:58] could get Topsy the Lord
[51:03] we're not singing because of the song we
[51:06] sing in because it brings worship and
[51:07] honor and adoration on the Claude
[51:11] because in heaven our seraphim's day and
[51:14] night Valen holy holy Lord God Almighty
[51:15] holy holy holy holy holy Lord God
[51:19] Almighty heaven filled with congenic
[51:25] billions bring in adoration and praise
[51:27] unto God
[51:33] he changed had these pressures for
[51:35] example a great burden of this issue the
[51:37] personal riches soft living and move was
[51:39] tensions in a complex in a complex age
[51:42] that we seemed unfitted to live in
[51:46] nervous tension I was that nervous
[51:49] tension because you read a very holy
[51:51] vows it's a different kind of nervous
[51:54] tension
[51:54] oh my watch this word it seems of a
[52:00] clear-cut Britain it was the defy room
[52:03] stand up for the word even unto death
[52:07] that is why the Christians and those it
[52:09] was very pure you have no compromise
[52:12] when the knock on your door Rome or debt
[52:15] Vega do in between you know well I was
[52:20] thinking about it they taking the
[52:21] Cartier off you ought to think about it
[52:24] before those Christians give their lives
[52:27] the real ones the genuine ones they
[52:31] meant undeceive God hallelujah praise
[52:34] God they have not known the depths of
[52:37] seaton it seems that this verse has been
[52:41] left out by the commentators for they
[52:44] were not able to figure out what
[52:46] doctrine or what experiences are meant
[52:49] by this phrase actually it is simple to
[52:52] know what is meant said parabrahma
[52:54] he recognized 90 commended command
[52:56] leaders talk about this depth acetal
[52:58] they do know where that is
[53:00] listen to the Prophet let us first know
[53:04] what the depth of God is and the
[53:07] opposite will be true for the depth of
[53:10] Satan in Ephesians 3:16 here we go that
[53:15] he would grant you according to the
[53:18] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[53:21] with might by his spirit in the inner
[53:24] man that Christ may dwell in your hearts
[53:28] by feet that ye being rooted and
[53:32] grounded in love may be able to
[53:36] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[53:39] breadth and length and depth and height
[53:43] and to know the love of Christ which
[53:46] passeth knowledge that you may be filled
[53:50] with the fullness of God that is the
[53:53] depth of God hallelujah
[53:55] could we get a lot of shout do you
[53:58] understand the depth of God now that
[54:01] prayer I want I want to read again that
[54:03] Christ will dwell in your hearts by
[54:05] faith and that ye being rooted and
[54:08] grounded in love may be able to
[54:10] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[54:12] breadth and length and depth and height
[54:14] and to know the love of Christ which
[54:17] passeth knowledge that he might be
[54:19] filled with all the fullness of God now
[54:22] according to these verses when a man
[54:25] experiences the depth of God in his life
[54:27] it is an actual personal experience of
[54:31] the Spirit of God dwelling in him his
[54:35] mind is illuminated by the wisdom and
[54:38] knowledge of God through the word but
[54:41] the depth of Satan will be in that he
[54:44] will attempt to destroy us he will
[54:46] always attempt to make a substitute of
[54:48] this reality
[54:51] also it's two things we point into now
[54:54] the depth of God is a pleasant
[54:57] experience with the spirit implement in
[54:59] your life that's a reality that is God
[55:04] on you there is no man in between that's
[55:07] fire upon your bein that is fire upon
[55:11] your life there was nobody in between
[55:13] join that now watch how will he do it to
[55:23] bring this depth decision he will take
[55:25] away the knowledge of the truth of God
[55:28] and destroy the world by putting forth
[55:31] his own he had God said he will then
[55:34] substitute here is bomb he will then
[55:36] substitute the police now Christ in our
[55:40] spirits this is the problem from from
[55:46] from the personal Christ in your spirit
[55:48] to man the under pulpit or some bishop
[55:51] or some message Pope or some message
[55:54] dictator he will do it as he caused
[56:03] Israel to do the same by a human being
[56:06] reading as king instead of God the
[56:10] born-again experience will be rejected
[56:13] in favor of church joining so the people
[56:17] have in their mind when they in church
[56:19] they are safe when they are Church they
[56:22] applied when they're in church
[56:24] everything is fine because it's in a
[56:26] particular church but Jesus already
[56:28] exposed that and so when they said come
[56:30] here forget that when it's a low here
[56:32] forget that boot come here come here
[56:34] he said behold the kingdom of God is
[56:36] within you
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:39] could we give our Sultan that one
[56:46] he never pointed kingdom to a place to a
[56:50] church to a man to a person he said the
[56:53] kingdom is within you Jeff for the
[56:58] kingdom has to be the work of the Spirit
[57:08] the born-again experience will reject it
[57:13] in favor of Church joinin the depth of
[57:17] season has been entered into that age
[57:19] and the fruit of that depth of seat on
[57:21] which a lies murder the horrible crimes
[57:23] came forth from it
[57:25] oh my thank you Jesus
[57:28] Oh glory to God but a Branham we
[57:32] continue for partners vanish suppose you
[57:34] need healing what does the word say he
[57:36] said what did you get in the spirit when
[57:38] reading it did we ask God for His Spirit
[57:41] to teach us the real root of it
[57:43] if we did we could call the elders
[57:47] confess our sins be anointed and prayed
[57:50] for it might not conveniently
[57:52] immediately but in his spirit in his
[57:55] spirit it is all over there is I love
[57:58] this there is no other Court of Appeal
[58:00] God will fulfill his word we need to get
[58:05] in the spirit
[58:06] and then things will be done so the
[58:09] devil job is to fight you with the
[58:11] spirit fight you from a Dundee anointing

[58:17] what not they handle confidence you're
[58:18] condemned though you're all messed up

[58:21] devil job Oh hallelujah
[58:24] what a mana don't go to the axe verse
[58:27] get in the spirit and then go to the axe
[58:31] and watch what God will do I think that

[1:21:19] church and couldn't be servants of
[1:21:20] Christ and when they get really nervous
[1:21:22] they light up a cigarette woman sick on
[1:21:26] immoral clothes and go out on the grass

[1:21:42] finished with the church now
[1:21:47] come down to the potter's house would be
[1:21:54] a Bible as the German r18 we want to
[1:21:57] read the scripture again
[1:22:08] the word of the Lord which came to
[1:22:09] Jeremiah from the Lord seeing there my
[1:22:12] 18 verse on the word of the Lord which
[1:22:17] came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying
[1:22:18] arise go down to the potter's house and
[1:22:22] I will cause thee to hear my words then
[1:22:25] I went down to the poor house and behold
[1:22:28] he wrote awoke on the wheels and the
[1:22:32] swagger is before my work on the wheels
[1:22:34] and the vessel that he made of clay was
[1:22:37] marred in the hand of the Potter so he
[1:22:39] meet it again another vessel I seemed
[1:22:44] good to the Potter to make it and the
[1:22:47] word of the Lord came to me saying no
[1:22:48] house of Israel Canada I do with you as
[1:22:50] this Potter see at the Lord behold as
[1:22:53] the clay is in the Potters hand so I he
[1:22:56] in my hand o house of Israel so I want
[1:23:03] to just talk a bit about this Potter's
[1:23:06] House that God sent Jeremiah to see and
[1:23:13] it's so strange that God would send him
[1:23:16] there because God wanted to bring a
[1:23:19] picture a comparison analogy well that's
[1:23:26] right and I'm seeing something about the
[1:23:30] putter I'm seeing the clay I am seeing
[1:23:36] the wheel I am seeing the purpose I am
[1:23:43] seeing a mud vessel I am seeing the
[1:23:48] Potters choice whether to keep it or
[1:23:53] discard it this is what I'm seeing
[1:23:57] no before clay could be used you don't
[1:24:00] just dig up clay it has to go through a
[1:24:03] process that it can be usable let's call
[1:24:09] it sanctified cleansed
[1:24:12] purified pull it out to get it malleable
[1:24:16] that you could work it get it into a
[1:24:20] usable state isn't that right the vessel
[1:24:24] was mad the what the choice was to keep
[1:24:28] it or discard it he brought it back from
[1:24:32] a broken state and the vessel was remade
[1:24:35] so I had some notes at the clay after
[1:24:38] being pulverized mix with water brought
[1:24:40] into a usable state a lump is torched in
[1:24:44] the middle of this wheel and I wish I
[1:24:46] had a wheel to show it in reality it's a
[1:24:49] wheel and something's underfoot spinning
[1:24:52] this wheel spinning wrong like this and
[1:24:54] they take this lump of clay and hit it
[1:24:57] in the middle of the wheel and now this
[1:25:06] and okay a lump is tossed into the
[1:25:08] middle of the wheel the center of the
[1:25:11] wheel with fingers thumbs water and
[1:25:16] pressure that lump of clay is turned
[1:25:20] into a bowl if you go on the internet
[1:25:21] and YouTube you could see how it is done
[1:25:24] and it's kind of an eternity ball of a
[1:25:29] is a water pot I kind of hold whatever
[1:25:33] the Potter decides after completion the
[1:25:37] art work is done it is placed in the of
[1:25:40] mckellen heated to bring it to a usable
[1:25:43] state glazed then heated and brought it
[1:25:45] into steam for a Potter
[1:25:47] the reason the clay must be processed
[1:25:50] because when it is placed on the wheel
[1:25:53] and the wheel begins to spin a stone
[1:25:58] rock panel or stick could my it or break
[1:26:04] it so when the Potter start to put that
[1:26:07] longer and subtle knead it and put water
[1:26:10] in it and put his hands in it and skip
[1:26:12] spinning and expand it he Lords one
[1:26:16] beautiful thing though he knows where he
[1:26:18] is going
[1:26:20] when you were spinning the wheel it can
[1:26:23] be you know efficiently could sue you
[1:26:26] know he's Shona no no no no no once is
[1:26:29] that the spin his hands and tongues and
[1:26:32] pressure when you want to risen higher
[1:26:33] it squeezes in at the whole mud thing
[1:26:35] raise up higher the clay because you
[1:26:37] have a vision I want to make a pot so
[1:26:39] you know that guides his hands
[1:26:41] that's the putter the accurate weight
[1:26:43] spin and he can stop it now hallelujah
[1:26:46] praise God are you with me now what
[1:26:51] about him said this in witnesses before
[1:26:56] we can ever make any headway we have got
[1:27:00] to get broke up face you know like the
[1:27:03] putter the Prophet was going down to the
[1:27:04] potter's house to be broke up to be mean
[1:27:07] over again you know if there's no
[1:27:08] breaking up there is no making over
[1:27:12] again hallelujah when he confronted
[1:27:19] Moses
[1:27:19] this is prophet who make mountain song
[1:27:21] later he said no watch you have got to
[1:27:23] be broke up before you can be remade the
[1:27:26] Prophet went into the potter's house to
[1:27:28] get broke up to get on the wheel and
[1:27:30] spun out something different if you are
[1:27:31] sinner get on the wheel God will break
[1:27:34] you up more you different shape your
[1:27:37] life different shape your home different
[1:27:39] trees and even what the Jaycees the day
[1:27:42] isn't breaking up we need to go down to
[1:27:45] the potter's house our stiff home in
[1:27:49] theology some time doesn't work so good
[1:27:50] what we need is an old-fashioned
[1:27:53] breaking up repentance in our heart
[1:27:54] getting mellow to watch squad
[1:27:58] melot towards God picture dupatta
[1:28:06] god he's a putter and if they don't
[1:28:11] catch the energy we are the clay just in
[1:28:16] case you miss it you are not the putter
[1:28:20] we are the clean picture the putter God
[1:28:29] working with the end in mind of a
[1:28:32] finished product he's not working to
[1:28:37] kill time he is working with purpose of
[1:28:43] the type and the use of the vessel he
[1:28:47] has in mind he is not working blindly he
[1:28:53] sees in you what you don't see in
[1:28:55] yourself he sees what you could become
[1:29:01] and you have to begin to want to become
[1:29:04] how he sees you as opposed to how you
[1:29:07] see yourself
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:14] he is working on purpose not beauty I
[1:29:18] want to repeat that he is working on
[1:29:22] purpose not beauty so the things are
[1:29:24] wrong you may not be nice it not be
[1:29:27] smooth it might be easy
[1:29:29] it may be messy but it's not the beauty
[1:29:32] he's working around your life he's
[1:29:34] walking to your purpose
[1:29:41] because it's vessel that has crafted
[1:29:43] each ball each thing that is made by the
[1:29:49] Potter have a purpose behind it cardamon
[1:29:55] sort of things are wrong it may not be
[1:29:57] pretty or easy he's not Santa Claus
[1:30:02] working at the wheel with an end in mind
[1:30:05] a water pot a flower pot that's the
[1:30:11] butter hallelujah I like that he knows
[1:30:15] the end from the beginning when he picks
[1:30:18] up that lump of clay he know exactly
[1:30:19] what he's gonna make it and when I see
[1:30:22] how they work it they work at the
[1:30:24] completion they don't mix it after 1/2
[1:30:27] Bowl when they start to spin it but a
[1:30:32] Stevenage spins completes everything is
[1:30:35] still and then they just wipe it all put
[1:30:37] the string and pull it off and you got a
[1:30:38] bowl to get a pot together fees it's
[1:30:42] complete he had it in his mind what he's
[1:30:45] gonna make how he's gonna make it the
[1:30:47] time to make it it's already finished
[1:30:50] the work he started in you hallelujah
[1:30:54] he's gonna come please it could be get
[1:30:57] our salt in their house
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:07] that's the butter that's a kind of clear
[1:31:10] a little bit the clay is the chosen of
[1:31:12] God it's God's choice since John 15:16
[1:31:19] you have not chosen me but I've chosen
[1:31:21] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:31:24] and bring forward fruit and that your
[1:31:27] fruit should remain now whatsoever he
[1:31:29] shall act afire in my name he may give
[1:31:31] it you as ayah
[1:31:34] 29:16 surely your turning of things
[1:31:40] upside down shall be esteemed as the
[1:31:43] potters clay for shall the work see of
[1:31:46] him that made it he made me not or shall
[1:31:49] the thing framed say of him the frame
[1:31:52] that he had no understanding Isaiah 45 9
[1:31:58] warned him that strive with his maker
[1:32:00] let the pot Church try with the patches
[1:32:03] of the earth shall the clay say to him
[1:32:06] that fashioned it what make us down or
[1:32:07] thy work he had no hands I wanna really
[1:32:11] amplified isaiah 45 9 water him not
[1:32:14] strive with his maker a worthless piece
[1:32:16] of broken pottery among other pieces
[1:32:18] equally worthless and yet please human
[1:32:21] to strive it as a maker shall the clay
[1:32:25] is here to him who fashions that what do
[1:32:27] you think you are making
[1:32:34] the wheel clay butter let's talk a
[1:32:40] little bit about this wheel
[1:32:42] I call it the wheel of circumstance the
[1:32:47] wheel of struggle the wheel of people
[1:32:52] the wheel of sickness the wheel of the
[1:32:57] death of a loved one the Wheel of Life
[1:33:00] you don't choose the wheel and you don't
[1:33:04] even choose the spin you don't even
[1:33:06] choose the speed you don't choose how
[1:33:09] long would I be there because he is the
[1:33:12] putter and we are the clay first Peter
[1:33:20] once said that the trial watch who at
[1:33:22] watch blessed be the God and father of
[1:33:24] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[1:33:26] his abundant mercy has begotten us again
[1:33:28] with a lively hope by the resurrection
[1:33:30] of Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[1:33:33] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled

[1:33:52] be and heaviness to money full of
[1:33:55] temptations that the trial of your faith
[1:33:57] being more precious than gold a
[1:34:01] parachute don't be try red fire might be
[1:34:05] found under the praise and honor and
[1:34:07] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:34:11] so you don't get to choose what God is
[1:34:16] going to use for that wheel you don't
[1:34:23] get to choose how fast the wheel is
[1:34:25] going to spin you don't get to choose
[1:34:27] your tests the potter's choice at the
[1:34:32] wheel according to the purpose he has
[1:34:34] for that vessel Ock 7 9 and the

[1:34:41] into Egypt but God was with him

[1:35:41] life before he called he saw the higher
[1:35:43] purpose that he was on that wheel that
[1:35:47] was being spun to make him a vessel to
[1:35:51] be placed next to Pharaoh hallelujah the

[1:39:50] he made it again another vessel so he
[1:39:55] had to bring it back down to original
[1:39:57] state back to this lump because once is

[1:42:13] does not just have a name called wheel
[1:42:16] the wheel is the spin the making is in
[1:42:20] the spinning if it does spin you can

[1:42:54] got to be on that wheel come down to the
[1:42:58] potter's house

[1:43:10] the amplified of the same scripture you
[1:43:14] may be seated
[1:43:14] Jeremiah Dean forces and the vessel that
[1:43:18] he was making from clay was spoiled in
[1:43:21] the hand of the Potter so he made it
[1:43:24] over reworking it into another vessel as
[1:43:28] it seemed good to the porter to make it
[1:43:32] so who did challenge to Potter to say
[1:43:36] the Potter carry with you into another
[1:43:39] vessel unto a fresh purpose onto a fresh
[1:43:42] rules the other challenge of water that

[1:44:36] beat it and beat it and turn it and beat
[1:44:40] it until it until the beater sees
[1:44:43] reflection in the gold and that's the
[1:44:45] way God does his church he gives you
[1:44:49] trial after trial test after test trial

[1:59:37] Larry's interchange he said now he said
[1:59:38] his own as me as I love I rebuke and
[1:59:40] chasten the cheese needs to reprove to
[1:59:43] reprove is to expose with a view to
[1:59:46] correction Jason does not mean the
[1:59:50] punish I think I need to say that
[1:59:54] soaking a little bit as many as I love I
[1:59:57] rebuke and chasten cheese doesn't mean
[2:00:03] to punish it means to discipline because
[2:00:07] the subjects amendment is mine it means
[2:00:10] he's disciplining you to bring you into
[2:00:12] conformity to his will and to his word
[2:00:15] that is what that Jason is all about
[2:00:18] isn't that right from the Lord loveth he
[2:00:20] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[2:00:22] he receiveth if you endure chastening
[2:00:24] God dealeth with you as with sons
[2:00:28] if you end your the cheese now if I run
[2:00:31] out but you know you're on your own
[2:00:35] some people just run all these tests
[2:00:37] around akattak no more so there is a
[2:00:39] void doc hide and about yourself
[2:00:46] and the devil isolate you and then to
[2:00:49] kill because Hebrew decide you could
[2:00:53] take him out when the bird wounded and
[2:00:56] weak and he stayed with the flow of the
[2:00:57] rest of birds and they make away and in
[2:00:59] front of him under gravity breeze you
[2:01:01] gotta ease and flying with the rest of
[2:01:03] birds you have people that encourage you
[2:01:05] and support you but once it definitely
[2:01:07] gets you decided that's what he does
[2:01:08] the first thing you fall you feel is
[2:01:11] something happening wrong and keep
[2:01:12] yourself no prayer you're not coming to
[2:01:14] the church and I come to the ministry
[2:01:14] you all about yourself that was his day
[2:01:16] right there now you can do it you can
[2:01:18] handle it
[2:01:20] and all you're trying to do so get you
[2:01:23] by yourself - Neal you when you finish
[2:01:25] what you get like a zombie dead man
[2:01:30] walking no chase then for the present
[2:01:37] seemeth to be joyous but Grievous
[2:01:41] nevertheless it yieldeth the peaceable
[2:01:43] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[2:01:45] exercised thereby I'm almost done
[2:01:48] hearing is set for the love of God love
[2:01:52] of God he desired in love a family of
[2:01:56] his own
[2:01:56] a family of sons like himself
[2:02:00] I'm finishing here before him lies all
[2:02:04] one mankind as one lump of clay out of
[2:02:08] that similar he know will make vessels
[2:02:12] unto honor and unto this manner the
[2:02:16] chosen will be his own choosing
[2:02:18] then those chosen ones born of his
[2:02:21] spirit will be trained to be conformed
[2:02:25] to his image in their walk
[2:02:26] he reproves with all long-suffering and
[2:02:30] gentleness and mercy he chastens with
[2:02:34] nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter
[2:02:37] must take the vessel he is working on
[2:02:40] and thoroughly break it down in order to
[2:02:44] rebuild it exactly as it is acid but it
[2:02:49] is his love that is his love
[2:02:53] another way of his love there is not
[2:02:55] there cannot be or fear not flock this
[2:03:01] is just losing fast as does those tears
[2:03:04] will be bombed together as a three-fold
[2:03:06] cord is not easily broken they will have
[2:03:08] a tremendous tree fall strength of
[2:03:11] political physical spiritual satanical
[2:03:15] power they will seek to destroy the
[2:03:17] Bride of Christ she will suffer but she
[2:03:20] will endure fear not those things that
[2:03:24] are coming upon the earth for Hugh loved
[2:03:25] his own love unto the end and I close
[2:03:28] with these scriptures and a quotation at
[2:03:31] the end in the script I read king when
