[1:20:05] favor Tender Love with the princes of
[1:20:07] the Uno and the princes of Uno said unto
[1:20:09] Daniel I
[1:20:11] fear the lord the king who had appointed
[1:20:14] your meat and your drink for why should
[1:20:17] he see your faces worse liking that the
[1:20:20] children which are of that sort then
[1:20:22] shall he make me in danger of my head to
[1:20:24] the
[1:20:25] so this man in in danger of losing his
[1:20:27] head he said listen did the king meet
[1:20:29] him did the king whine this pork this
[1:20:32] thing
[1:20:33] here Daniel look at his stand this is
[1:20:37] Daniel then said Daniel to melar verse
[1:20:41] 11 whom the prince of the unic had set
[1:20:43] over Daniel anah mishel and Azara prove
[1:20:47] thy servants I beseech thee 10 days let
[1:20:51] them give us pulse to eat and water to
[1:20:53] drink in other words give us a vegetable
[1:20:55] give us
[1:20:57] vegetables water to drink then let our
[1:21:00] countenance be looked upon before thee
[1:21:02] and the countenance of the children that

[1:26:31] said well who who will
[1:26:34] preach I took
[1:26:38] body you fight iil fight me so hard I
[1:26:42] can't last fight bring M yesterday was
[1:26:46] totally crazy insane but I'm here
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:52] Satan Hallelujah having done all this
[1:26:58] time
[1:26:59] but did you ever think that most men who
[1:27:03] ever do anything great for the kingdom
[1:27:05] of God stand
[1:27:06] alone did you ever think of it you have
[1:27:10] to stand by
[1:27:11] yourself Jesus stood alone all down to
[1:27:15] the ages other men who stood alone finny
[1:27:17] sanki Calvin KNX even to Abraham Lincoln
[1:27:20] that's right stood alone men who do
[1:27:23] great things men of vision men of
[1:27:26] spiritual understanding stand alone and
[1:27:29] I think that's because that Jesus had to
[1:27:31] stand alone himself now the one
[1:27:33] principle of us being here trying to
[1:27:35] help you and the only way that I know
[1:27:37] Christian friends to help you is to get
[1:27:38] your faith the best that I can by the
[1:27:41] word of God centered on the will of God
[1:27:43] for you you see that your faith centered
[1:27:46] on the will of God for you because once
[1:27:48] you see where your faith supposed to go
[1:27:50] then you recognize everything else is
[1:27:51] the devil fighting you from going where
[1:27:53] God want you to
[1:27:56] go now remember we don't hold the plan
[1:27:59] God has the plan we come to get the plan
[1:28:01] unfolded to us and when the plan unfold
[1:28:04] to us then we could act correctly now
[1:28:06] why the Bible say write the vision make
[1:28:07] it plain that he that reth may run if
[1:28:10] you read and you don't understand then
[1:28:11] you're messed up that why God tell
[1:28:13] Daniel go that way the book is sealed
[1:28:15] till the time of the end Daniel did not
[1:28:17] understand what he read but the book is
[1:28:18] sealed so they going to come unsealing
[1:28:20] of this book that we get clarity of
[1:28:23] purpose Clarity of vision to know what
[1:28:25] we have to go after what we must inherit
[1:28:28] what we must possess what we must claim
[1:28:31] what we must Proclaim what we must
[1:28:32] declare what our faith must take a hold
[1:28:34] of Give the Lord a shout and when you
[1:28:37] know what your faith must take a hold of
[1:28:39] then we could press the battle I press
[1:28:41] towards the mark of the high calling in
[1:28:43] Christ Jesus give the Lord a shout
[1:28:45] hallelujah
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:52] [Music]

[1:35:37] for our own good Moses chose the
[1:35:40] Affliction and the disgrace that he
[1:35:42] might walk with the people of God think
[1:35:44] of it listen to it he chose the
[1:35:47] afflictions of the people of God and
[1:35:50] counted it a greater treasure for the
[1:35:51] enduring seeing him who was
[1:35:55] invisible now lot one time had to make a
[1:35:58] choice it may be this morning that
[1:36:00] there'll be men and women sitting here
[1:36:01] that'll make your final choice you are
[1:36:04] today what you are because several years
[1:36:08] ago you choose to be what you are
[1:36:13] now and what you choose now will
[1:36:17] determine what you'll be 5 years from
[1:36:20] today 5 years from today you may be a

[1:37:00] choose don't look at what you see choose
[1:37:03] what you see by faith and the only thing
[1:37:06] I will count is what you choose by faith
[1:37:09] so you are what you are by the grace of
[1:37:11] God and by the faith that works in you
[1:37:15] oh glory to God I remember young man 17
[1:37:17] years old 16 going on 17 when I give my
[1:37:20] heart to the Lord 17 years old when I
[1:37:22] got baptized and I remember when I saw
[1:37:25] the scriptures even young men shall
[1:37:26] faint and utterly fall but they that
[1:37:28] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:37:31] strength I say God make me a young man
[1:37:36] that will wait on
[1:37:40] you I was intentional and
[1:37:43] purposeful a young man that will wait
[1:37:45] upon him and I knew if I wait upon God
[1:37:48] he wouldn't
[1:37:49] fail he will come on time he will come
[1:37:53] through
[1:37:54] and I could confess this morning he has
[1:37:56] never failed me
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:01] yet when I saw the three things to TI a
[1:38:05] man money popularity and woman I said
[1:38:07] Lord preserve me from those three things
[1:38:11] I watch it with Haw eyes because these
[1:38:14] are Destroyer these are the tools God
[1:38:16] used Satan Satan just no no imp not
[1:38:18] impish he's not a comedian you
[1:38:20] know we laugh and we laugh and laugh
[1:38:23] Satan is no comedian he has a definite
[1:38:26] plan you
[1:38:28] know I was hearing a man give a
[1:38:30] testimony he was a former witch or
[1:38:32] warlock it's called him and he talk
[1:38:34] about the sacrifices they make to attack
[1:38:36] churches and
[1:38:38] Christians how they will sit under the
[1:38:40] moon and sit for months and and when
[1:38:42] they don't eat and they fast and they do
[1:38:44] all kind of things Spirits there are
[1:38:46] certain places the car go by at allall
[1:38:48] you because that person is
[1:38:50] praying and that praying giving an order
[1:38:53] covering over the
[1:38:55] house so when they pass in in the realm
[1:38:58] of the spirit they recognize they can't
[1:38:59] go there because prayers emanating
[1:39:04] there they testify about a pastor you
[1:39:06] have a good heart be like money they say
[1:39:09] aha we get him and they work things to
[1:39:13] get him
[1:39:16] time the realm of the
[1:39:19] mind and the realm of the heart is two
[1:39:22] different realms
[1:39:24] amen don't be
[1:39:26] confused the heart of a sense and so
[1:39:28] does the mind so sometime you could
[1:39:30] think with your mind it doesn't empower
[1:39:32] the heart there has to be a supernatural
[1:39:34] connection to get the desires of the
[1:39:37] mind to hit the heart that's why you
[1:39:39] talk about the subconscious moving
[1:39:41] behind the conscious you could think you
[1:39:43] want this this is right but your heart
[1:39:45] going wrong you want your heart to line
[1:39:47] up with your mind your mind is where the
[1:39:49] devil has used the heart is what God has
[1:39:52] influence is not the same thing oh give
[1:39:55] the Lord some Praises Hallelujah when
[1:39:59] your heart and mind line up trouble for
[1:40:01] the devil's Kingdom trouble in the enemy
[1:40:03] camp because you're coming from a
[1:40:05] genuine place of sincerity and Truth he
[1:40:08] say I desire truth from where not the
[1:40:11] mouth from the inward path oh give the
[1:40:13] Lord I shout a feeling good this morning
[1:40:15] I desire truth from where not your
[1:40:18] mou but from the inward Parts he said
[1:40:21] because these people honor me with with
[1:40:23] their mouths but their heart is far from
[1:40:25] me don't let it be so with you this
[1:40:27] morning could we get some prais inside
[1:40:29] of
[1:40:30] here don't let it be so this morning God
[1:40:33] want truth from the inward
[1:40:37] [Applause]

[1:50:05] going up up up up up the prophet
[1:50:06] prophesy will go to the gold standard
[1:50:09] who said that God said
[1:50:12] that and when he prophesied
[1:50:15] that they were coming off the gold
[1:50:20] standard because why for years we preach
[1:50:23] about it there has to be a change of the
[1:50:25] financial system that you can't buy or
[1:50:28] sell unless you take the mark of the be
[1:50:30] there has to be a system and I was
[1:50:32] thinking back one of the powers behind
[1:50:34] the Corona virus was that everybody was
[1:50:36] forced to go
[1:50:40] online the whole world if you're in
[1:50:43] timbuk 2 or timbuk far wherever you
[1:50:47] are everybody was forced pushed to go
[1:50:51] online not everybody could stream
[1:50:53] whether on the phone Tik Tok Facebook
[1:50:54] wherever it is everybody is a microphone
[1:50:56] everybody have a
[1:50:58] voice because the Beast system is a
[1:51:01] connected
[1:51:02] system all that dwell on the earth he
[1:51:05] has to know where all
[1:51:09] is in Europe they have a limit of cash
[1:51:12] you could use you must use card so if
[1:51:16] it's $300 cash Euro or whatever it is
[1:51:18] that's all you could use cash after that
[1:51:20] you have to use card with card the know
[1:51:22] where you go what you buy who you buy
[1:51:25] from and with the connected cars they
[1:51:27] right now they know exactly when you go
[1:51:29] by your aunt Auntie or when you go by
[1:51:30] place you're not supposed to
[1:51:32] go so everything is
[1:51:35] trackable and traceable and they could
[1:51:38] find you at any time when you put your
[1:51:41] card into ATM in France they know
[1:51:43] exactly what ATM it is and where you
[1:51:46] are all that dwell upon the Earth where
[1:51:50] you going and hide and the bush
[1:51:58] I Daniel understand my books a number of
[1:52:00] years before the word of the Lord came
[1:52:01] to Jeremiah the prophet that should be
[1:52:03] accomplished 70 years in the desolation
[1:52:05] of
[1:52:06] Jerusalem let's skip on a false prophet
[1:52:09] spoke and said Jeremiah you wrong you're
[1:52:11] going to keep Israel down there for so
[1:52:12] many years two years God smooth that
[1:52:15] false prophet and took his life that
[1:52:16] same year because God told his true

[1:52:42] sang himself in the midst of all as this

[2:26:07] of God not because he's longsuffering
[2:26:10] means there's no no
[2:26:12] judgment one time he said the cup of the
[2:26:14] iniquity is not yet
[2:26:16] full the sinning sin and sin and a of a
[2:26:19] jug
[2:26:21] are waiting for it to reach full to
[2:26:24] judge them the longsuffering is what
[2:26:26] have that vile or jar Falling Up hoping
[2:26:31] people turn around hoping to repent
[2:26:34] hoping I can cancel what has to come

[2:26:50] Ezekiel 18 says the soul that sinth it
[2:26:52] shall die the son shall not bear the
[2:26:55] iniquity of the father neither shall the
[2:26:58] father be the iniquity of the son the
[2:27:01] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[2:27:02] upon him and the wickedness of the
[2:27:03] wicked shall be upon them if the Wicked
[2:27:06] Man will turn from his sins that he
[2:27:08] committed and keep my statutes and do
[2:27:12] that which is lawful and right he shall
[2:27:13] surely
[2:27:14] live he shall not die all his all his
[2:27:18] transgression that he committed they
[2:27:19] shall not be mentioned unto him in his
[2:27:22] righteousness that he had done he shall
[2:27:25] live God ask a question have I any
[2:27:28] pleasure at all that the wicked should
[2:27:30] die sayth the Lord God and not that he
[2:27:33] should return from his ways and live but
[2:27:36] when the righteous turn away from his
[2:27:39] righteousness and commit iniquity and do
[2:27:41] it according to all the Abomination that
[2:27:43] the Wicked Man do it shall he live all
[2:27:47] his righteousness that he has done shall
[2:27:49] not be mentioned
[2:27:51] in his trespass that he had trespassed
[2:27:53] in his sin that he had sinned in them
[2:27:56] shall he
[2:27:57] die there a man recently died the other
[2:28:00] day or he was a young fiery preacher
[2:28:04] singer gifted guy in his late years he

[2:28:30] and making this I call it chocolate cake
[2:28:33] God he died

[2:28:40] every funeral people going to heaven
[2:28:42] that is not true that's not
[2:28:45] true again verse 27 when the wicked man
[2:28:48] turned from his wickedness that he had
[2:28:50] committed and do it that which is lawful
[2:28:51] and right he shall save his soul alive
[2:28:54] because he consider it turn it away from
[2:28:56] all his transgression he had committed
[2:28:58] he shall surely live he shall not die
[2:29:00] yet say the house of Israel the way of
[2:29:02] the Lord is not equal in other words
[2:29:04] people saying God is not fear go he not
[2:29:06] just oh House of Israel are not my ways
[2:29:09] equal are not your ways unequal
[2:29:12] therefore I will judge you oh House of
[2:29:15] Israel everyone according to his ways
[2:29:17] sayith the Lord God repent and turn
[2:29:19] yourself from all your transgression so
[2:29:22] iniquity shall not be your
[2:29:25] ruin and I want to give two
[2:29:28] examples Eli sons and Aaron's
[2:29:31] sons these are sons of high priests sons
[2:29:34] of men who in
[2:29:35] position 1 Samuel 3 it said and the
[2:29:38] child Samuel ministered unto the Lord
[2:29:40] before Eli and the word of the Lord was
[2:29:42] precious in those days there was no open
[2:29:43] Vision it came to pass at that time Eli
[2:29:46] was laid down in the place his eye began
[2:29:47] to wax dim he could not see and and he
[2:29:50] the lamp of God went out in the temple
[2:29:52] where the ark was and Samuel was laid
[2:29:53] down to sleep and the Lord called Samuel
[2:29:55] he said here am
[2:29:58] I and he ran unto Eliah and said here am
[2:30:00] I th callest me he said I call not lie
[2:30:04] down again and he went and lay down and
[2:30:06] the Lord called yet again Samuel Samuel
[2:30:09] Rose went to Eli and said here am I for
[2:30:12] thou D call me and he answered I call
[2:30:14] not my son lie down again now Samuel did
[2:30:17] not yet know the Lord neither was the
[2:30:20] word of the Lord yet revealed unto him
[2:30:22] and the Lord called Samuel again the
[2:30:24] third time and he arose and went to
[2:30:26] Eliah and said here am I for thou this
[2:30:29] call me and Eli perceive the Lord that
[2:30:31] called the child therefore Eli said unto
[2:30:33] Samuel go lie down and it shall be if I
[2:30:36] if he call thee Thou shalt speak and say
[2:30:38] Lord for thy servant Heth so Samuel went
[2:30:41] down and lay down in his place and the
[2:30:43] Lord came and stood and called as other
[2:30:45] times Samuel said speak for thy servant
[2:30:47] hear it and the Lord said to
[2:30:51] Samuel behold I will do a thing in
[2:30:54] Israel at which both the ears of
[2:30:57] everyone that hear it it shall tingle
[2:31:00] God they doing it in secret you in that
[2:31:02] day I will perform against Eli this is
[2:31:05] God telling this young child what he
[2:31:08] going how he going to handle
[2:31:15] Eli in that day will I perform against
[2:31:18] Eli all the things which I spoken coning
[2:31:20] his house when I begin I will also make
[2:31:22] an end for I told him that I will judge
[2:31:25] his house forever for the iniquity which
[2:31:28] he knowth because his sons made
[2:31:31] themselves vile and he restrained them
[2:31:33] not he had a responsibility in the house
[2:31:36] to deal with your sons to deal with the
[2:31:39] ruin and the violence inside your house
[2:31:41] deal with
[2:31:45] it therefore I have sworn unto the house
[2:31:48] of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house
[2:31:51] shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
[2:31:54] offering
[2:31:56] forever let's talk about Aaron Sons
[2:31:59] Leviticus 9 and Moses and Aaron a
[2:32:03] backdrop here went into the Tabernacle
[2:32:05] of the congregation and came out and
[2:32:06] blessed the people he this church are
[2:32:08] you with me still and the glory of the
[2:32:11] Lord appeared unto all the people so the
[2:32:13] people saying God's glory right and
[2:32:15] there came fire out from before the Lord
[2:32:17] and consumed upon the altar the burnt
[2:32:19] off offering and the fat which all the
[2:32:21] people saw they shouted and fell on
[2:32:23] their faces just think about that now

[2:32:27] seen all these things taking place

[2:32:34] Aaron took either of them his sensor put
[2:32:37] fire therein and put incense there on
[2:32:40] and offered Strange Fire before the Lord
[2:32:43] which he commanded them not they're
[2:32:45] doing their own thing they're fixing
[2:32:47] their own incense they they find the
[2:32:49] incense enough and they add a little
[2:32:50] thing and they take away a little thing
[2:32:52] and they do their own thing verse two
[2:32:54] and they went out fire from the Lord and
[2:32:57] devoured them and they died before the
