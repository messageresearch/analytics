Calvary's cross that you could use me as a tool when lord bless your people this evening granted Father in Jesus my asking - amen god bless you and we so good to be here this today tonight and they were via Bible so I gotta tend to to portion of Scripture Luke chapter 18 wanna read from verse one to eat and Revelation chapter 22 we want to read from verse 10 to 17 Luke chapter 18 wanna read from verse 1 taste and he speak a parable unto them to this end but men ought always to pray and not to faint and that under and singing there was an a city a judge which he had not God needs a regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine Visser II and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself do I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow trouble at me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what unjust judge see it and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with him I tell you that he will event them speedily nevertheless 1 when the son of man commits shall he find faith on the earth and from revelations up to 22 verse 10 he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still I me who like come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I'm Alpha Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed the data do his commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates of the city for with out our dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever love it and make it a light i Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I'm the root and the offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come at him the heareth say come let him that the tests come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may God bless his word you may be seated or praise the Lord amen you got a beer tonight it's good to be here tonight always good and always a blessing and a privilege to come into the house of God oh my last time on for you would see how God has been gracious to us to give us his opportunity all these years to come into his house to hear his word amen so our title tonight seal up the scenes of the prophecy that's the title seal not the sayings of the prophecy for message feet but a Brannon 1953 he was saying listen god bless you I want to tell you one thing I know I'm holding long well just one this wonderful thing I want you to remember there is something fixing to happen now remember I told you that there was a step up coming in the church now these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while something is moving so he was prophesying of this to pull of the power he was prophesying and I say this listen by the power of the volition of Jesus Christ whom I he said everyone in our doctrine in our baptism we have come to a place but there is some key that will unlock something here so he knew he has the word doctrine teaching presence signs and wonders but is a key to unlock something here no he saw the book sealed on seven seals and when Daniel saw the scene and when the Tundra's utter the voices he said on right that what was that in the scripture but it'll reveal in the last days we are at the time we are chemists right now so he was seeing that these thunders is connected with crossing over to the other side and we know later on he says open up the seals in the back of the book now we could cross over so he knew that the seven thunders was connected to the key to unlock the power so that's why the Prophet says is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back a power back to the church and you see now the great need for power in the church not torque power not teachings power not big big evangelist we're talking about power the power of God back in the church because this is what is promised do you believe that do you believe that all glory in our God we had Kalish right now here a few nights I went across the butt of the bits over the Paducah Kentucky crossed into Evansville and but a buzz word wasn't me I said it's just kept burning on my heart a message and I know that something God has promised on the opening up of the power and yet I'm waiting no for him so this is real the power have to open up something after turn the key to open up this power then he talked about a vision here he said I walk around cleared my throat and he looked at me z-bo Jesus raised up his hands feinted didn't come till next morning I have an idea what he looks like I've been feeling for the last months I'll see him again pretty soon that he revealed something that's fixing to come forward oh brother if I have it right God forgive me if I'm wrong but seen it in the scripture seeing that he arose ascended up he received a new name that no man know then I see him coming in his power so everything is tied together it shall be revealed in the standards new name new walk new life something after turn so I want to challenge you tonight that you under prophecy or glory that God great things are still fixing to happen oh boy don't be worried poor glory to God beyond the expectation that woman had an expectation that one that became before the unjust judge she had an expectation of hearing her case or glory to God she had that expectation and the judge was unjust here Fiat God here here man but wouldn't it coming she keep coming because she wanted to get her expectation fulfil Oh glory to God and God put that parable to set it up to show you the quality of perseverance that you have to have in believing the prophecy that has to be fulfilled William Brennan is not here he is within us to call him up or glory that God he can do nothing at this point in time but God is risen and you and I believe that God is waiting on you and I to come into position to come into a place Oh hallelujah so he said no watch be on the verge brother somebody come back from Kenan the grapes are good it is our land it is our land God give it to us we serve we can take it Oh glory to God I want a a bigger a man than that this is our land God give it to us God give it to us we can take it I know how much Phyllis on it how much Hittites and jemmye sites on it how much sickness and cancer and diseases on it I didn't care much brain in it I don't care whatever is on it God give us this land they will send this the devil sent that but God give us the land it is still yours even if your Backson is still yours or everything this happen is still yours you fell sick is still yours it's our land it's the land that God has given us he said Malachi 4 according to him and Elijah the prophets he was sent the prophet and the Prophet to us now we could possess this land Oh glory to goddess continue ho glory to God he said in the last days I will send the rain in abundance like that both former and latter rain will fall in this day ring in abundance Oh glorious see that yet it coming it coming let me see it again it coming what you're doing I'm prophesying or glory it's coming we're gonna break the sieve over every prophecy that the Prophet prophesied for this bride hallelujah it cannot be sealed anymore judgment is also coming here is filthy filthy still right just still holy still everything gonna be fixed or glory that God made God fix you by the word tonight Oh hallelujah what a time on Sunday when when God had enough it's locked on his family he had to be extracted I like that gonna have to physically take them out the city I'm telling like I walk you from here you I don't know you gotta get out no at least I could get you before the fire fall before judgment strike no you are a gal you have to run out you gotta keep moving and Putin look back or glory to God hallelujah regardless of what you have been through don't look back you love him tonight Oh hallelujah in the last days our Center in an abundance both former and latter in will fall in this and what they had back there plus what God is gonna give us right now at Han [Music] [Applause] so nobody come mama Jaime and fool me and tell me we have it we have this we have the war we have we have it to get or give the Lord some praise as people or glory who have this and who have that and who are the other let them have what they want to have and take what I have I am thinking nothing I say what pizza hand we have to have what the early church had we have to have I don't want nothing less than that I don't want nice humans nice explanations nice mysteries unfolding that's fine the world has already been opened but if that mystery can be respected that power was the use of the mystery or glory league or there has to be a key to turn to unlock this power this power to be in luck God put the power behind the door and crisis the door and he put the key of faith or glory to God to turn hallelujah to unlock the door of the power is that right he put the word right there and put power behind the word or glory of God in him hallelujah and I believe with all my heart I believe me in the age of the battle we believe that being leader usually that the age of what the battle not the sitting down and holding on and you're hanging in there no that little woman she had a battle on her hand because that judges a mean judge and she wasn't letting that judge Oh throw off key she had a passion in her heart she want an answer she wants results and Jesus said here what do young just judge said no I mean hallelujah I will avenge her shall not go to avenge the Saints who cried di night unto Him nevertheless the question when the son of man commit not when he appear when the son of man cometh not when reveal himself when the son of man commit we find the faith and the earth Luke 17 the fit was revealed I'm going to look some deity this is Luke 18 Oh and Jesus question and if this fate will still be here that's a tell you must cross darkness cover near it that's almost demon powers people trying true people of the world use challenging them shall I find faith on the earth but I'm coming back he's gonna find fit you're gonna fit and training that for sure or glory the call you have to answer that question if you have faith in our people that believe God regardless my god like job if you're kaya from God the devil can move you because you're staying with the word did you get what I say you're skiing with the word you can hear from God the devil can move you you have a platform of the word that you could stand on or glory to God looter didn't a no manifestation or looter hell was a revelation that just shall live by faith and he withstood the whole Catholic Church with a revelation from God of justification and that's why had enough power in it to withstand the holo-room or give the Lord a show I mean that one man could sternum batter with room the pagan Roman Empire that have been converted to withstand that we could withstand anything anything in this last day when seven Caesars open and the book has open and Adam has been restored Oh glory to God hallelujah God already give us a kiss I even quarter give us a taste of what man men restored whoa chlorine as God that

I in the word granted Lord may I never turn from it may I hold that King's sword so tightly grip it so closely father bless us together we are your servants as we consecrate ourselves for you this morning in our hearts we are yours in the name of Jesus Christ for service do you love him this morning Oh hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory to God I feel the Holy Spirit my god anointed the word anointing you Oh hallelujah because we have a step up coming do you believe that that is a step up coming but if we don't put these seeds in how are we gonna see it how are you gonna expect it oh you're gonna have an expectation if we don't preach it I'm not here to tell Nancy stories and was a dream last night this is the what is promised and Peter said by these promises you become partakers of of this divine nature so if you get the promises and the promises come under the prophecy and these promises were sealed so the breaking of the seeds were still loose the prophecies over your life not what you feel but the prophecies Oh hallelujah what if Joseph did not prophesy over his life what if what he didn't have the vision over his life my time he said he frustrated and he pressed he pack up shop he done he he done but because of the prophecy hanging over him he knows God is with him he knows every vision has to come to pass doesn't matter if in prison itself it doesn't look like if we're in the right place at the right time but God will make all things work together for your good he will make the good things for good and the bad things the work for the do the things that are understandable work to the things have questions about you make it work oh my god the drinks in I'm not tell you like you don't want to fully see a man or matter but the still doesn't change it you're gonna make all things work together for good when Joseph get that God no work that was for his good when Potiphar white makers move from here on him that was for his good because prison was for his good got to break him prison break him Oh glory to God prison remake him oppress and humble him or glory to God prison put him on the cross where his words were not only effective but the prophecy was still over him and I don't care what prison you in right now my me a prisoner sickness a prison is the prison at that but the prophecy is still hanging over you and don't you let go hallelujah hold on to that prophecy glory to God no don't ever bring that prophecy away from you in this prophecy of your healing and if I go to Revelation 10 8 11 and we take the book we prophesy of your healing of your deliverance of your bridge of your baptism of your adoption of your perfection we prophesy by the word there's gonna be a revival a referral the just and great power coming to the church I'm

to us he can take it we can possess it glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and this way I can look to know church on a group they don't have it whatever looking for the Prophet Rafi what we supposed to have which man is supposed to look true maybe sees it let's search the church what they have I know but uh Peter I know Peter denied Christ yeah well you wasn't there when God said on Peters hat and split up a reserved seat on maybe an IRA God knew him too and God was filled in him the same man that deny Christ the same man that kissed the same I'm not run away that night God was veiled and that man you can't challenge God on that so don't anybody hold you to your pass didn't know when you met the person they don't know and God interrupted your life they don't know when the book was speaking on your behalf they don't go up together they don't know about that and where you could go to dinner can't even go did you ever could only imagine about faith no one the Bible said I have not seen his have not heard what God has prepared for them that love him safe and is jealous of you tonight because we know you're on your way to the resurrection you're on your way to seventh on the revival

stuff to do he was one man no we have many men Oh give the Lord a shout I feel inspired tonight brother man was one man no what have many men around the world he was anointed power or boy the power to live power to pray power to cast out Devils power to speak the word a little flash just like that power you know God hallelujah hallelujah all in the again brothers and you need testament but a pledge had no Bible that Old Testament Scriptures they were the Bible they became the scriptures itself here with the Living Word or give the Lord a shout and we are coming right back to that where the fire of God would fail in the sons of God to make them the final voice to the final age there will be the living word of people hallelujah under their messenger or glory not under their messenger will do one messenger they become the final voyage of the final age the manifest revelation 22:17 who glory to God the spirit and the bride you will see the bride yet when the bride's had to come forward the spirit be going to anoint the bride us see that yeah do you get what I'm saying revelation 22:17 have to be made manifest Oh glory to God not changed not true the spirit and the bride call will give the bride a voice Oh glory to God a force that cannot be challenged [Music] [Applause] hallelujah no more explanation and a normal explanation and mechanics mechanics mechanics no it will be dynamics it will be word moving in power or glory to God hallelujah ballerina God a man may be seated listen to this God take but about him true first per second people to bring him to the world we know now the angels came to God of the scattered word to tie it back in the word to bring down the Holy Ghost the object was always to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost but God commendeth power when the wood was lost to the ages because the fullness of the would have to have restored to get the fullness of the power back in the church so because the word was lost gonna have to first gather the word because a word and spirit this one so the world was divided in seven parts to seven ages it took seven messengers to restore back the mysteries that came from God out the word back into the church and butter on came with a goethe stitches all together and put it in the pyramid I said there's a Bible that have to be in you all glory to God I understand I'm saying now the scattered word all to the ages you have to pull it together tied back on the word put in a vision and Briana's prophecy the same it won't bring the ages he pretty individual and this being when is completed is the servant of God in the church of god that totally rapture not because I'm a man a pulpit evil rapture know that being has to be completed or give the Lord I shall that be enough to be completed not some sermon preached we are all servants you are seven sitting on your worship and as a servant I have to call the fish I have to preach other seven we all serve on the devil and all is the servant of the law son praises or glory to God hallelujah all them haul em bishops and all them kings and put into their servants God using them so completions will walk Laurita God hallelujah hallelujah my my my my so when Gore tell them to send 10 spies the Chuck de la note don't discover it wasn't harvest time it was in great pain he said a perfect type of pentacles first fruits Pentecost was in gathering the first fruit and when there was at Kennish Barnea at the judgment it was to be determined whether we'll go on and get the holy spirit or not in the land of promise where was the promise is that promise possessor repent every one of you so he tied with Pentecost he tagged by the upper room he tie it with the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the promise that's the reason they got this big bunch of grapes on brought it back as evidence in harvest time where was Ken españa judgment seat what's over there promised on grapes God make sure they go in half this time go to let them go when he'll look ribs on the tree he had to make sure to have this time that Emperor's could bring some quickness and look and what god is great and work what is good here is the evidence so then that comes with some young great sapling tree some small she say since um here is trees to plant and we will see become a solid have and if it would be a grapes God make sure is harvest and choose how to run on a more close enough for them 10 fellows them fellows then fellows a hollow juice their fellows grab some grips and run out Caleb and Emma juice dripping onto because and fellas never meet grip so big them fellows to stone them fellows lose weight with the juice from the grips hallelu them taking the time to come back because I lo hurry this is my I can walk here I can walk dear I am looking at her own psyching to get out no this is my land or glory that God give me this land every place I put my foot its mines I don't nobody'd ever put in his foot but it's mines wherever he put this foot you squattin okay the Lord a shout come on now don't worry I quit my that's mines could I get out on that could i you're in on that where you put your foot is yours so we can put on certain power tonight put on foot Americas tonight but on foot on deliver runs tonight put the foot on the holy ghost tonight put your foot where ever done joy or glory to God hallelujah you feel speaking in tongues one for Pentecostal people like spottily gives you to speak in tongues hallelujah praise God different faiths give up wisdom all that is part of yours too I'll enjoy anyway walk along stupid there's something called the wisdom of God or glory to God hallelujah given your understanding give your knowledge give you wisdom oh here are some things that's an I will blow your mind hallelujah or glory to God oh yeah that's the reason they got this big bunch of grapes brought it back for evidence I can see Caleb and Joshua with on their shoulders matching Judea just singing the Jubilee song they had evidence they could prove it was a good man they put back and give all the journal grip if they wanted one of the cluster a bunch of grapes no Joshua and Caleb when they heard the murmur of the people call them fellas hustle back so fast now them able to talk the spirit of negatives and on darkness and doubts over the people they are the leaders there is so qualify for all fools who ever fool inside but they are the elders and when they breed their prophesy over the people it was weak I take it that's anointed upon the people the people didn't go in on these men were supposed to represent

wants a prophesied to pull you out and I'm filled the book rent in the hands of the original owner so when the book come down prophecy had to come back all to call you because God bringing it back to original so when Jesus came he said you had to be born of the word and the spirit to bring it back to Adam again whoever fell from Jesus from the correct that and bring it back to word and spirit mechanics and dynamics so they remember around bought the book he bought all the names was in him so when he spoke about his Lord all the names I know we gonna have a faithful ministry to call the last second names book gonna be in sons calling names how the spirit and the bride say come for glory to God the voice of God will be in her isn't that the prophecy the voice of God will be in the bride or course she will speak for God Oh hallelujah the Spirit will give her a voice or glory to God because the logos have to be a living voice touch speak the Living Word or calling a God not dead letter Living Word therefore the bride of the beginning spirit get to become Living Word why Pelias speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard a word because he was speaking Living Word Norse word or chlorine Oh God he was in the body life was flew into the body from the prophet prophesied will happen again or give the Lord a shout full sea germ being loosed from the body by spoken word original seed coming alive Oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh blowing over a member a friendly amen amen watch this watch this dear the disciples under-promise receive it the Holy Ghost that is

God smiles or Chloe - Claude Claude voice God pandas or chlorine ago when God pander to them something has to take place because the voice of God is the Panda so when Peter went to the hospital Ilyas he was tunneling or glory or different voices well Gloria Lauren Collins was sealed by the Holy Ghost he was filled with the Holy Ghost what got away to the upper room for Cornelius haunted by the word oh go get the Lord a show okay the Lord a shout we're going to call some sons aside I plopped them into the family the pillar far handle Oh Lord oh god hallelujah be on the verge of it friends oh my hallelujah hallelujah why Joshua and Caleb could be like that what a rank of the answer right here what was it they were positionally born in Christ positionally they had a knowledge of the word and the word became manifested so then guys was completely different from the rezidentura guys oh good lord have mercy are you with me oh my praise God as darkness and Jambres withstood Moses so these will resist the truth men of carp Minds reprobate consonant of feet this unfortunately one's watch wait considering the feet and he interjected here that was one converted the scenes of course so manly message and do not and do nothing about defeat the moody message then oh gosh on a profit the not as Elijah but they do know about defeat because D fate is what was once delivered to the things I'm saying so to know what defeat is you have to go back to what the fathers had you can measure it will you message had for the last forty years that your measurement that no diploma Lane they'll go back to the father's because question of profit eternal facts but back to the faith of the fatherland when when that happens is fulfilled elias purposes fulfill our hearts literally turn back to the father's we were earlier for you we have to go back and get that plus show time on plus hallelujah we have to go and pick up where the hot bus what God promised us we are going nowhere until we have this without going back for that we have to get that first and then come back the disk or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah it will take more than what they had then the goat you know but we have to start there because original that's the Alpha Church that's when the bonfire chopped down or glorious golden goose am Alpha and Omega once I have to drop them on the Omega or give the Lord a shout come on Bryce hallelujah same power strike the Alpha Church with the strike the Omega church this is our promise same power but talk same power poor Peter poor pizza pizza cutting read and write and or nothing like that must be happy as I see Paul speaking things difficult understand or thing like that you expect the side Peter for all of moods all them big woods Paul it was a doctor Paul was a lawyer poor ones this poor words that powers how did you get it poker use big words take him because of that he could actually translate the Old Testament and bring it in a New Testament and she all of her stuff and Paulin figure if we want to fight him and things if let every man who put him and acknowledge what I write is the commandments of the Lord if the ignorant leave him alone in his ignorance and come take spring under he I'm a puzzle of Jesus Christ I ain't no Christ in the flesh I know Christ my pillar of fire you can come and tell me where you know you walk with Jesus and you watch the air when you fish in and he know I'm not in that I know I'm in a different level altogether and I have the authority to become a messenger to the aged poorly tell them that but he's alight because I'm a star and right hand of God what I've seen is dusty at the Lord or God is using me to say to you I'm your messenger three anti-age so keep walking keep walking the light that's why you're the boss the Melissa contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints it once had it they lost it we are fighting for it that's why you asked the question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith books not books and tapes not believers that I believe the prophet and second message songs not that not shall I sign message songs shall I find the faith that was once delivered to the Saints there's only one faith like this eight hallelujah defeat Michael rough it up tonight general Dona once it dies deep it or put the bomb on it down what hatred of words you know nothing all he works is going to stand clapping and singing and preaching and Greenville I saw a house that's all we have to boast about never a cellar and sleep on that he wouldn't establish churches without delivery listen to them them going good as long as I'm still sure because Balaram says the devil know that the true church is mark 16 in all glory the automobile be brought to me preach that to me the devil more solidly you can fool him you can fool him he know when he's seen that to touch an action so the Prophet said the seven thunders those voices will be known by the real true church because those voices those thunders when the after the voices of that group not to take the word and hundred year it was faced and cut the heavens they could do whatever they wanna do words will be expressing the faith that's restored back in the church do I am God hallelujah nobody can tell much faith I know words words his feet expressed only evidence of faith his works reprobate concerning the feet you know what reprobate means apostasy he said feet defeat there's only one faith this is one around concern defeat no I want to read Luke 18 and he read it parable a man ought to pray enough faint see to your judge descriptive already read it and he said Lord said hear what he just said shall not call a fantasy left which cried the a night unto him I tell you wonders he would have interim speedily nevertheless when the Son of Man comment shall he find faith on it then Barham says no that's the question here is where I want to get to Revelation 10 we're getting of him in the days of the message of seven angels the mystery of God ought to be finished here's the question is if you would follow a lioness our will it be finished will I find feet Malachi 4 before fill in this time restore the feet of the children back to the feet of the fathers do you original the word Oh glory to God reprobates nothing living they are fine cultured men but the reverb is considered defeat Oh hallelujah my god you don't have to explain defeat you no no no no no no no no just explain if it Jesus inside was trying to cap or the electability devil come on and burn around dramatize did they were talking back to them and said look Jesus tell you all the cash but not one of you could do it because at that point the anointing upon them can't work Jesus coming off the mountain and all them colors flashing but I'm said the devil scare with the leaf they just waiting for instructions he children one time he said GSA's not in this mode they know is exit which which part to exit how fast the exit they just wait and get out or glory not God what was that a live voice as you Tom did I check the devil you can't Bluff it we cannot Bluff it it has to be real oh come on now oh god this is the showdown you know or glory before I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify of these in the churches I'm the regional spring of David and the bright and Morning Star Oh hallelujah praise God praise God could we take a little more cos we could take a little more we're not groove here this one tonight question who help me Jesus where are the spirits no a question that went into the swine where the spirits that went into the herd of swine that be when Jesus cast them out of the maniac that's a question what about a part to the best of my knowledge now we are starting off on demonology no dia de man is a great thing now some of okay now those demon powers those spirits was an a man called Legion because his name was legion many dos spirit I was in that dear man that drove him insane and if any one of us here insane person had to deal with them they have many times their strength because they are so possessed of the devil if he was ever wrong person that lost their mind it takes several good men to hold them there are twice or three times their power listen where he's going with this now now when a person is crippled and the Holy Spirit gets ahold of them if the devil's got that much power to make a man three or four times human strength how much power can God put in a man that's what come upon him to make him walk in the strength of God will he have been lean crippled for years so you're not looking at flesh and blood you're not looking at crippled bones for twenty years you're looking at the strength of God the power of God hallelujah that could hit that person with so much power that bones could walk you know and I said because that person that was done to how much bones on the bed was that's bones and that bones went running out under the strength and power God and that power of the company tonight you might be bones but crooked and you your life at such power or glory to God a super strength coming just out of you tonight not tomorrow tonight glory to God I want you to come that way every service today is my service today is my day this is my time this is my hour hallelujah watch watch that's what make him to walk in strain of God Whaley crippled for years his bones come on Street his hands go straight he walks like a young new man because the power of the Holy Spirit is on him where he's a nothing a message power of the Holy Spirit but I'm a pastor I best be shan tong he is the other he for i guess it'll not be laughing a lot of things because he that demon spirit that Luciferian spirit that spirit that that jesus put some volts on but just it is written is written he no power Jesus was a mystery man to him Jesus was the most mysterious man ever encountered because when he said if Dobby Jesus never demonstrated any power toward him as far as he can send that I can't touch that man because I'm man so connectivity would not that bad yeah I mean solar power from Jesus alone when he has finished with him listen you know he get dream he could really take a holiday memory beat somewhere and take a rest off on different things but Jesus not get dream Jesus no fully charged he went into the wilderness and was tested and when he come true the charge come back on him without charge quantum is a temple check the book and say the Spirit is upon me no the devil listen to Nolan Nolan fries mister he says upon me we are not to meet the Tati reading scripture then it's a disdain this scripture is fulfilled thanks many I open up big and sin whoa whoa what you're talking about sir all glory has auditorium out but you have something what happy for you no he could prove what's upon him or give the Lord a shout any man can say the Spirit is upon me but when Jesus said that he was able to prove that because he did the words that norther man oh my god my lord god help me tonight I came up here wasn't feeling well but I feeling so charge now I could run to a truth or glory to God hallelujah praise God so when that spirit come upon him he could prove it he had confidence in every prophecy concerning his life so he could say destroy this body entreaties I'll raise it up because David prophesy about him and he knew the word of prophecy so he could take it and prophesy based upon what the scripture said that he was the Living Word still working up important to the scriptures I know the bride will be the Living Word and we have the scriptures of Malachi 4 we have the revealed Word we have the Bible that we can identify our name and our purpose and if will and if Jesus could go to the temple and pick up the scripture this brings upon me why the bride her going to the temple and pick up revelation 2:17 God because he has anointed me with a voice to seek home the spirit and the bride say come Oh glory to God why be covering the temple and identify that we're the children whose hearts are beaten literally back to the face of the father's the faith of the fathers is living still and spite of fire dungeon and sword is still living tonight it will cut the devil ribbon tonight or chlorine or chlorine causes the Word of God told on the Mount of God and the bride of Jesus Christ no this whole thing I'm appear to you for will become so real weird tell them seven thunders after the voices or we talk and talk and talk him away or chlorine accordingly we'll see something because they're gonna have the sword in hand what shorts the King sword was that the purple glory they thought it would be greeting among us or chlorine accord the King saw it will be in their hands sword in the mouths word of God booyah hallelujah Loras my my my my my let's continue he said no deal Wendy's evil until the rap the man in Chains he could break them he put them asunder and there was nothing good mining he was really a bad case I'm Jesus cross on that the Coderre he was so evil not the man the man was all right it's not the man when you see a person like that don't ever think it's the man it's the devil as in the man then the maniac and the platform that night was going to kill me in Oregon or night when it comes to me him spitting in my face calling me snake in the grass before nearly 10,000 people it wasn't a man he's a man that eats and drinks and sleeps before the family loves and like you and I am but that was the devil in him doing that and you never cast a devil out by the wrong attitude it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force there is in the world when I say here at when I say yeah that hallelujah hallelu is the most powerful force when I say era most powerful force or glory to God hallelujah amen now if you notice the devil is always hit it is of the devil now let's go wrong on the binoculars no and when people hit someone remember it's a terrible devil to despise or dislike you mustn't do that so when your blood can take this one you need a blood transfusion you need a blood of Jesus so dislike and hit and you can't take this one lies issues that you have see any other get at ultra system you mustn't do that this is what a brown-nose did the whole lesson this question answer the question answer yes some stuff aside that is what bringing Jesus a night he said that he continued no now remember Jesus had an assignment when you pray our Father who packed in heaven when he come down he said if you don't from your heart forgive every man his trespasses neither your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses you mustn't do that now where the devil creates a power of hatred to run out on the platform to kill me which he physically was more than able many times he could have held me up past with two fingers like by my belt because he weighed 262 on somebody palms six foot and a half seven foot tall great fellow he just hit a preacher on the street with his fists broken collarbone and jaw injured him put him in a spitter he hated preachers so he ran out there to kill me no and so on okay we'll continue you know now in that man that was of those spirits was castled is fine and Ghaderi some of those poor people are out there remember remember Devils birthday Devils always live and there will be a time when Devils will have to die they will become totally unrelated but now they are live and they work from generation to generation upon human beings some of them in the form of cancer some of them involve epilepsy some other form of tuberculosis they get into the flesh but seemingly they are powerless until they get into a prison or glory of God they have to operate you a person which brings us to another thought and the Holy Spirit covers the earth but is almost helpless until it gets into you unto me God is dependent on you and I the Holy Spirit the earth is full of the Spirit of God it's brought out but it cannot operate until it comes into us we human beings are operated or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah so do whatever mom says the word was invisible until it became fresh then they will become visible Oh hallelujah so he said it's so powerful he said God is depend upon you and I that is full of the Spirit of God it's poured out it kind of operate until it comes into us we human beings to operate so all these mysteries all these great revelations were is to get us out of the way that the Spirit of God would have actually have the preeminence --is which fulfills the second fall of the great mystery of God the first full was reveal himself the second part was to have the three eminences and the third part was to restore back Eden or glory to God so when God could find a man and he said there is my spirit flowing freely that man is blown out you have no self in there you have no pride in there he has no aim and everything is cleared out then I can flow freely so the devil wants to take us over to operate under him so he gets in a mild form he starts in sin if he can hold them Justin a righteous man a good man I let him go ahead and try to be good like that if you can hold him until he is dead that's what he wants to do he's got him because no matter how righteous you are how good you are home all you are how clean you are how honest you are you will never get the helm until you are born again so the devil of mine holdin I'm holdin I'm holdin until they did I know they can't make it nobody path back to the question the spirits the window that man you were like a maniac does the same thing in people today is them spirits thousand time Towson's and the devil come in with little opium it's like a schoolgirl they just started to do get her to smoke a cigarette that gets us started the next thing is a stronger end up with marijuana and then the real group habit what does it it drives him insane they were crazy so the devil is in smoking cigarettes that's his little mind form he sees you're pretty smart he going to catch that he will never let it go further than cigarettes if you see gonna catch it so you know I wanna know my eyes I know smoking marijuana you know I just thickened broad we don't know what names there ain't no camel I don't know what names they are right now so they wouldn't go further out the west's and he'd ever whenever I see right there I have you as long as you can hold here long enough he can take your life snuffed out cause you know you can't go on until chorus ETSU but you will hear sermon after sermon message after message punch after punch and warning after warning you can just keep you wore off keep your mind on something else being a popular person and you got to have it something like that I'm gonna be a good fellow I'm gonna turn a new page I'm going to church or in church keep you under that but jesus said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born nor wise enter the king now Oh hallelujah that's why people keep people in church you see church is deformed it's deformed but when you see Bride you see in life where you have to push on press you see you're not seeing form you see in life Jesus told them he said sister Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify on me and you wouldn't come to me living word that you might have life so he was showing Sitka's he said life wasn't dwelling in the scriptures they were reading it was what was present tense hallelujah he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so he was bringing a present an gospel and see them coming fast all the way real India has been fulfilling me I am the way I am the truth I am the life so far as it manna wilderness is under everyone dead you sound the Living bread that come from heaven in my money to me he shall not die Oh glory to God that's why I can offer the water well you say woman if you know talk to you you would ask me for water or chlorine apart I live in water living word life spirit life the way that I speak their spirit and their life or give the Lord a shout the bride will come back to that the militia will come back to that the very world itself will be spirit and life like what Peter had that's the fate of the fathers Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're fighting for my hallelujah all glory to God let me skip down he said the Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else in the world your prestige your life your job anything that is dear you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most you see I am afraid at my work are free but my husband don't be afraid let that be first please let everything else go you say well I expect it one of these days but a Branham not one of these days this is the time let it be first before I do anything else let me have it no desperate that would help answer a question you get when you are desperate you already have to get it or die that's when you're gonna get it or praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I miss you like a rap okay No Oh My Jesus enjoying the wood tonight I don't know about you but I am alright no we know something about the 10th vision and Barry Manilow was teaching him about the pools and so on like that and he catch a small fish and the angels tell him I truly enough to dress with explaining things just get piece of that you know and he said you cause impersonations then I started weeping I look took the string I was trying to Street it out he looked at me and I wondered what he was going to do he said keep your line straight in these kind of times so yes so I cut the line right through again and just as I did at that time he taken me up all again and he stood me up in the air over agreed order to him or tent and I made an altar call and hundreds of people Reeve softly sweetly were weeping settle my the altar receiving the Lord Jesus and I said that looks better and then there was a nice smooth spoken gentleman stuff that I said no wild but a brand is rested a little bit with line up the fair line you all with prayer cast beginner at a certain line to my right so I stood I looked and I could see to my left from where I was standing there was a little building sitting there a little building built like that and the people here look like they went around the tent and and then I seen a woman in the UM Allen stretcher was lean and a man behind I was standing on the crutches and they were standing there waiting for their turn and there was a lady taking down their names and things and then there was a canvas stretched that no one could get her wrong that tent and I wanted to watch this and listen to how it is now and watch the difference and I heard that always goes every time we have a healing service that's what happened was that's the we'd always song did song like like like we in the bush but I did it it always been that way and I felt it I heard it rather moving I looked and there was a soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little buildin so the light went into that little buildin and there was something different between the light and the angel because he was still there with me and the light that went into the building and this angel still speaking behind me which is man he said I will meet you India and I said I don't understand why I and there he said watch I'm this woman when she come out of this unbalance stretcher she was pushing the stretch on the other side and the lady asked her what happened she said I don't know it just happened I've been on the stretcher I've been on his bed for years and here come the man packing his crutches and they ask him what he didn't know he was commented at the platform that testified I don't understand it there so they were passed into this room this room and were being healed and then he's I don't understand what's in there and then the Holy Spirit the angel begin to put it back in the wood for him watch he's always scriptural but I'm saying that he said did not our Lord see window prayers be not as the hypocrites that like to make a show he said enter into the secret closet and when you have done so closed the door then pray to your father that sees in secret and he that sees in secret shall reward thee openly and he said you remember that name that he will hunt him that you dream about he said I'll meet you in there and this time it will be a public show and then the vision left me so that was 1956 but in 1963 the 7cu night he was just talking back some of it I just want to read that back he picked me up he took me up set me high and I meter was going on and looked like a tent or a car TV or some sort and looking there was a little box I placed on the side I seen the light that was talking above me the light that you see in a picture it will away from me like that went to the tent and said I'll meet you in there and this will be the temple and you won't tell it to nobody or glory that God has a place for him to meet you he's going to meet you there don't miss it Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout hallelujah and in Seban your colonel he said this is the third pole and there are three great things that goes with it one unfolded today and he said the first full of seven she was what seven thunders banging one two three four five six zero Oh hallelujah one for today yesterday and the other wonderfully today and there is one thing I can interpret it's an unknown language but I was standing right there this is the tuple coming up this is the reason that heaven was silent I better stop here I feel check but I see no more see remember the Seventh Seal the reason was not open the reason it did not reveal it nor know about it is that vision come years ago you remember that it's slide right straight into the word he said notice for the end of time message this seal he reveals six eels it does say nothing about the seventh but the end time seal when it starts it will be a secret according to the Bible and remember Asian ten one two seven at the end of the seven angels message all the mysteries of God will be known we are the end time the opening of the seventh seal oh my I'm almost done one more coat I'll be done musician Oh glory that God you love him tonight Oh

cruel him in a beautiful comment and they call the adoption of a son placing a son positionally what he was they had a ceremony then the father said this is my son I adopt him or place in positionally and they had checks in those days that son name on a check was just as good as his father because he was placed and the son could fire who he wanted to he could hire who he wanted to he was in full possession of all that the father had Oh glory to God amen amen amen now you see Jesus here we go I had proven to God that he has been the right kind of son and God took him up on the top of the mountain brought witnesses oh dear heavenly witnesses and me witnesses and he clawed him with immortality a supernatural something taking place is garments bristling like the Sun in the middle of the day as white as they could be God placed on him that robe of immortality showing that here see them here we go are you ready that's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth Sunday he will call you a side Church if you'll only obey Him and stick on the wood and believe it he will place into the church before the comment of Jesus he will place he will place into the church all the power that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all that Jesus was important to the church God wanted his work done he sent it into his son the son wanted work done he said into his church at that day you shall know I am in the father the father in me and I in you you and me at that day because here we go because the same power of God that was in Jehovah of God resident Jesus Christ and the same power that resident Jesus Christ risen place sons in the body of Christ they are sons that will be placed we always sons but we got to be placed placed sons will have Jesus Christ power in them let me finish it the person of a son take a motor set in place have a ceremony before angels please him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority that person watch how easy you know let me see this if it can't be a finale from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done you mean I'm not supposed to
