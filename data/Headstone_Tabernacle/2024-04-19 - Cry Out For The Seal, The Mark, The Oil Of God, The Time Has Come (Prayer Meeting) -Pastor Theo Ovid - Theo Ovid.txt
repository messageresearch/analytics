believe thus here the Lord amen let's bow word of prayer tonight father we thank you for guiding us together this way and through technology we have this opportunity to be in the same virtual room that we can cry out and call upon your name father it's coming down to crunch time now we see Wars rumors of War we take we see things like a slow burner heating up the world will be on fire set your church on fire set your people on fire bring them into a god Consciousness and awareness that the god of the Bible is true the god of the Old Testament is real the god of that made promises is true Lord you will keep your word just as you spoke it through the mouth of your prophets come and Inspire us tonight as we look to you father we not look into bosses we're not look into jobs not look into we have a roof over our head we look to you the source of our lives and the one that we trust tonight granted father in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you know as brother Gan singing that song about trust it because of this scientific age and this age of total knowledge and information man is trusting science more trusting his money more trusting his work more and I was doing some work on a message and I discover where B is speaking about how the money system will be destroyed and the reason for all of this is because Satan want dominion and control the be system like how the Bible talk about no man shall be able to buy or sell unless he has the mark of the Beast it's a system and that system is about control total control control in politics control in religious control in in every aspect of life control years ago it was money tied to the gold standard they switch from that and then is printing money and the prophet propes go back to the gold standard things going to be rocking is going to be shaken they have to wreck the system that we know now to bring on this whole new system the system of control and I am asking myself the question if the devil through the Beast and the image of the Beast and this whole system that they're trying to introduce they need the technology to achieve it because when Jesus was tempted and the devil told him all these kingdoms are mine to give it to whomsoever I want and so Jesus didn't fight him on that and said no it's not yours it's mine no no Jesus didn't do that the devil know what he's talking about because he is the God of this world the God of this evil he knows that he knows that um he is reigning right now he's ruling right now and that is why the the the bride will be pressed because he know that his time is short because the prophecy say so and the word say so we creatures of time who were born in sin and shape iniquity coming into a knowledge of God coming into a revelation of God to understand the call that God put Upon Our Lives to represent him and to stand for him in the last days is a paradox it's a paradox because this is the most evil age there is and we are called to stand tonight I have something up my heart to share with you and I will tell you what I've titled it I've titled it cry out for the seal the mark the oil of God the time must come you know I have been battling a long while fighting the spirit of lari sluggishness message type uh contentment message type entitlement Because deep down in my heart in my mind in my spirit I know it can't work thousands and thousands of Believers have been deceived by their pastors by they being comfortable because of what they believe they are going somewhere and unfortunately it is not not so the truth is it is not so Jesus Christ is coming from his body which is his church the body is not buildings the body is not numbers the body is not followers of this particular Ministry minister or whatever the body is the body of Christ which is he is the head of so Jesus is not a pope Jesus is the head of the body call the church and only by one Spirit not by books not by tis not by joining this group and this group is the bride and not the bride that's a light that from the pit of Hell and I want you to swallow that and I want you to grasp that what are you standing on and what are you standing for I'm not talking about our church our church is just any other Church actually can of Believers there have people with different mindsets and attitudes people who see things this way or that way and it parallels what God identifying the scriptures as people that follow through without mixing what they heard with faith and guess what they perish this beautiful God this lovely God this wonderful Lord that promised deliverance and whatnot with a mighty hand brought them out and then kill them and judg them and I think that um you have been hear me saying for years this message world has not yet seen God's judgment people get old people die they bury them and everything else and say they are Saint and what not like everybody that die goes to heaven that's not true some go to hell man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so tonight I want to read three scriptures the scriptures we know scriptures I've read before but somehow I believe it will come across different tonight so the first scripture I want to read is Ezekiel chapter 9 Ezekiel 9 reading from verse one he C also in M ears with a lord voice saying if have your Bible you could find it cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the ways of the high gate which lie towards the North Every Man a Slaughter weapon in his hand one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers incor by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the brisen Altar and the glory of the god of Israel this is verse three of Ezekiel 9 was gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was to the treasur of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the righteous inor by his side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city to the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sign and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof unto the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have pity so note this inkhorn writer was sent forth first not the slaughtering Angels not the Judgment Angels but the inor writer we know that is the holy ghost slay utterly watch this old and young so at this point age is irrelevant whether you're old whether you're young no respect of person both mids and little children young women little children and the Bible had and woman so man woman male female little children but come not near any man upon whom is the mark where must it begin and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house now normally we sto there but we'll read on tonight and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while while they were slaying them and I was left that I fell upon my face and cried and said ah Lord God will thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy Fury upon Jerusalem then said he unto me the iniquity of the House of Israel and Judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the City full of perverseness for they say the Lord had forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not and as for me also mine eye shall not spear neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the incor by his side reported the matter saying I have done as thou Hast commanded me so this commission to Mark those that sigh and cry was completed this angel with the incor writer was able to announce the commission that you have given to me it is done the rest is up to you he did his job putting a mark not on people in the message not on those who have all the books all the tapes not on those who following the mighty teachers and revelators and mystery teachers and un folders of this word and unfolding who they are and they and all of that drama not that but put a mark upon those that sigh and cry if there isn't a cry in your spirit tonight ask God for it outside a cry in your spirit and heart you are actually walking in debt debt in the Old Testament was debt to be to be to go in that to be outside of his presence now life the only way to survive is to be in his presence and maybe Sunday and see how that goes but K went in a different land and get his wife Kan walked out of presence to get his wife set got his wife I'm in present Jesus will get his wife from in presence not out of presence in presence if what you're doing now affects you being in God's presence stop it if where you go now the presence of God does not approve don't go there if how you live Cuts you off from God's presence stop living that way because you need to come into presence marriage is Honorable the bed is on theile but that doesn't mean you do everything do anything on the bed because God said so God not in perverseness and God not in perversion God is in truth and God is in righteousness the second script I want to read is taking from Luke chapter 8 froming the scripture verse one this is Jesus speaking he speak a parable if you want to find it Juke chapter sorry chapter 18 verse one Luke chapter 18 he speak to this end that men ought to pray and not to faint I don't remember if I ever tie these two scriptures together Ezekiel 9 and and Luke 18 maybe I did I don't I can't remember and he speak a parto them this end that men always men ought always to pray and not to Fain what is he saying in that his there'll be stuff and there'll be challenges and there'll be problems that will cause us to want to faint but he say men men in the house ought always to pray and this is the parable the story that Jesus give and remember the parables are Mysteries and story form that people will grasp the inner meaning with layers that he put there because Jesus was the greatest Storyteller saying there was in a city a judge who feared not God nether regarded man so this man like a dread began there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary she had a request and he would not a while so he's ignoring her he's in B with her she's making her request but afterwards he said within himself do I fear not God nor regard man yet why because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her least by her continually coming she wear me and the Lord said Jesus Jesus speaking you know hear what the unjust judge said shall not God so he's making a point hear what this unjust judge say it shall not God avenge his own elect which cry no and again no which do cry at all no which is on Facebook Twitter Tik Tok and whatever else no which cry day and night day and night unto him do he be along with them I tell you that he will Avent them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall find faith on the earth so Saints the challenge tonight is not just this prayer meeting or this time of prayer this is a I even a sixth or 10th or fifth 12th this is next to a little a little compar to what God wants of us and what God wants of us is cry day and night say day and night in your house I want you to say day and night he want you to cry day and night this with Pastor Elder Deon this is you and your thirst for God this is you and your hunger for God he wants you to cry unto him for your needs day and night you crying out is an expression of how much you need him how much you desire him this have nothing to do with the pastor I like you say and what kind of word is that no no no have nothing do with that just you crying out day night last scripture the prophet and we wrap this up last scripture want to read from revelation 22 ver 10 to 12 he said unto me see not the scenes of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be note that this is the hour that we are coming to where there's no more need to persuade anyone to be just to be righteous to be holy whatever condition you're caught that remains it will be your choice your choice to be righteous your choice to be holy your choice to be Wicked your choice to be evil your choice to be one of the most miserable Christians that you can be or what you claim to be that's your choice you have heard it over and over people say if the Lord will deliver me from this I'll be a better person Lord Lord deler from that I'll be this no he said up to you you heard me preach about it you are Justified only God could justify glorified only God could do those to the part that you and I is called to do is sanctification is clean up our acts is do what needs to be done it has nothing to do with what the preacher and the preacher and the Elder and the church and the wrong Church better got right church and some CL some CL in some Corner say they have the right Church they have the right teachings they have the right Revelation they have the right this and people go there and they still how to fight up for their own self because you have to deal with you you have to own up to you so the power is upon us and remember the title cry out for the seal the mark the oil of God the time has come I'll close with a brown when Peter started walking out on the water he thought he was getting along all right see how big I'm doing he started sinking he didn't say well I guess it fa on down to the bottom a few bubbles come up no he cried out Lord save me and that Eternal hand reached down and picked him up again why why he cried out is it because you're proud you don't want to cry out you have a chance to not the crow in your own house that's what the matter with the church we don't lay there long enough we don't cry out long enough we don't hold on to it if a little baby want something it will kick and scream turn R in the face we are afraid we will take it what is it you call it the mascara out of your face face whatever it is the paint you get what you want from God you will take it off anyhow so you don't have to worry about it you'll mess up your hair but that don't make a difference now God here we go God don't expect us to come to him with some intellectual speech I remember I triy that I tried to get save I was going to write him a letter put it in the woods because I know he come through the words and tell me and tell him I'm ashamed of myself I didn't want to do it and I got there to pray I said Lord no let's see I seen a picture of him one time they held his hands like this I said Mr Jesus I wish you would come here a minute I want to talk to you to you just a minute I'm listening nobody I said I did it wrong all right Mr Jesus maybe I am supposed to do it this way I said Mr Jesus would you come and help me I'm a sinner I want to talk to you a minute nobody come I fold my arms I said Mr Jesus would you come here I I hear people say God talk to me I said Mr Jesus would you come here I want to speak to you course then the devil come on the scene that's the way he does he might tell you your knees are hurting no need of asking you wait get it tomorrow night he always wrong when you're not when you're not ready then he said to me but always he says take advantage of what he says take advantage of it he said to me you know what you're already 19 years old or 20 years old you're already 20 years old you waited too long devil talk I said oh god I've waited too long Lord even you don't hear me I'm going to tell you anyhow I've always wanted to do this oh brother that brought him on the scene what was it I cried out just simple I cried out Lord Jesus you promise it Lord and he come on the scene and that's the way to bring him on the scene you're just a baby cry cry out fit don't try to say well youve something of another some great Ro out prayer you practice for hour or two that don't do any good I said cry out for your needs that is God provided we didn't Jesus explain it when he said the unjust judge to the woman that cried day and night how much more will the heavenly father give them the spirit who cry out for it day and night I think I'll read it again how much more will the heavenly father give them the spirit who cowed for a day and night seek keep seeking knock keep knocking just keep on until he opens stay with it cry until he hear this cry until the promised word is Vindicated then you got it you don't have to worry no more you see the Bible promise it then stay right there and cry until you get it if a baby sees a cookie and he wants it he just cry and cry and cry and stick and kick and scream and holler and turn red in the face his mommy get him a cookie it's all over see he's got what he saw what he wanted he wants to lick off your ice cream cone he will keep raising a f till he gets it well that's the way we are supposed to do it go give the Lord some Praises tonight he said that is the way we supposed to do it if I see a promise in the Bible that God's word and I stay there and cry out till God give it to me and he'll do that get you off his hands you see and that would be in the natural he wanted you to do it he likes for you to ask ask abundantly that your joy might be full here I said it again cry until his word is Vindicated no friends just watch just minute cry until the word is Vindicated the trouble of it is we get the cookie and we think that that is all there is there's a whole table full we get so we can speak in tongues we so brother that's it that ain't that's just some of it I got happy enough to shout but there's more of it there's a whole lot more just keep crying until that is God's provided way for his people God's provided way as always is to take his word and hold onto it until it's made manifest to you and I close with this scripture here two scriptures 1 Peter 4:17 says for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God you notice that Ukraine and Russia is almost like if I say tailmate but it's almost like if something hanging there just just hang in there R could bomb The Living Daylights of the Ukraine any but it's something that's slow burning there and now Israel with Iran Israel with Hamas just a slow burning here but before the drama takes off in in in in in Earnest the time is come judgment begins where at the house of God and if it begin first at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God last scripture and we Romans 6 verse 10 said for in that he died he died unto sin once but he liveth he liveed unto God verse 11 of Romans 6 likewise reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord verse 12 a order a command let not sin therefore re in your mortal body that you should obey it in the Lost thereof verse 13 neither Yi your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God let not sin yield your members let not sin yield your members that's that is orders that is instructions verse 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace what then then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants he are to whom you obey whether of sin unto debt or obedience unto righteousness and the amplifi that verse 12 says let not sin therefore rule as King in your mortal shortly perishable bodies to make you yield its cravings and be subject to his lust and evil passions do not continue offering or yaling your bodily members and faculties to sin as instruments and tools of wickedness but offer and yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to Perpetual life and your bodily members and faculties to God presenting them as Implements of righteousness for sin shall not any longer exit dominion over you let us pray heavenly father I thank you for your word Lord and this is what have stir in my spirit oh God to cry out day and night for the SE for the mark for the oil of God because the time is at hand Lord that incor writer said I have done it I've completed it I've put the mark and what's next judgment oh God help your people here this this evening and may the anointing of God move upon them move in their homes that they will cry out unto you Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost seal me into the kingdom give me that oil in my lamp to keep it burning lord it's almost as if like in modern terminology the battery has run out they first had a charge and they couldn't get the charge the battery recharge and the oil the battery the energy the charge run out and
