[11:00] we want to remember
[11:04] believers everywhere
[11:07] who would be facing difficult times
[11:11] with this virus it's affecting churches
[11:15] families friends relatives
[11:18] and we are asking god's mercy tonight
[11:20] let's go ahead and close our eyes
[11:22] as we look to the lord heavenly father
[11:23] we thank you for your great love
[11:26] that you have loved us and your love
[11:30] wasn't when we were saints or believers
[11:32] and we were sinners you paid a price for
[11:34] us
[11:35] and give us this opportunity to be
[11:36] reconciled to you
[11:38] and father not just for our souls but
[11:41] even for our bodies and father we
[11:43] lift the believers before you father
[11:45] that your hand will be upon them your
[11:46] hand of protection
[11:48] your hand of covering your guidance lord
[11:50] and those
[11:52] who have lost loved ones and have
[11:54] families and friends who on the brink
[11:56] we pray that your mercy and grace extend
[11:58] to them god is almost like a harvest of
[12:01] souls
[12:01] but lord you know those who are are
[12:04] yours
[12:05] lord and we commit this time into your
[12:07] hands lord it's a trying time but it's
[12:10] not foreign to us
[12:11] because it was prophesied that difficult
[12:14] times lays ahead it's how we're going to
[12:16] steer
[12:16] these times or we will manage in these
[12:19] times
[12:20] it's not what happened to us is how we
[12:23] respond to what's happened to us how we
[12:25] act and decisions that we make so father
[12:28] prayer help us tonight and
[12:30] take me out of the way and may you be
[12:31] magnified amidst your people
[12:33] may your healing virtue flow even while
[12:35] the word is being spoken father
[12:38] lord there is no distance to you there
[12:40] is no uh
[12:41] uh wearing of of that we wear you
[12:44] but lord you give that strength to those
[12:47] who are a weak lord you give
[12:49] strength and you sit dear to wait upon
[12:50] you shove a new dear strength
[12:52] so we come tonight to wait upon you to
[12:54] hear from you father
[12:56] i pray that the torch that you have
[12:59] to have upon my heart to share with your
[13:01] people tonight made eddie fight him let
[13:03] it strengthen them let it
[13:04] inspire them i mean you bless them in a
[13:06] special way
[13:08] that they will be able to witness the
[13:09] others granted lord and jesus may ask it
[13:11] amen
[13:13] god bless you saints and thank you for
[13:15] being here tonight
[13:16] and um we are living in a privileged
[13:19] time and i realized that
[13:21] a lot have to do with how
[13:25] we possess what is happening around us
[13:28] if you allow it
[13:29] you'll be overtaken you'll be anxious
[13:32] you would
[13:32] you know be affected greatly but if you
[13:35] think
[13:36] that this is god's plan and god have a
[13:38] purpose behind everything
[13:39] then i miss it all you're looking for
[13:42] that way
[13:42] and i remember i think twice we
[13:44] mentioned it about jacob
[13:46] god himself told jacob go back to his
[13:48] country go back to the prison i'll be
[13:50] with you
[13:50] so it was my issue that it wasn't god
[13:54] he had his fears for his brother
[13:57] he had a right to have those fears he's
[14:00] a human
[14:01] and because of those fears he found
[14:03] himself
[14:04] making decisions and doing things to
[14:06] protect himself
[14:08] that is what we will do because of fears
[14:11] because of our
[14:13] and that is why in the upper room the
[14:14] doors were shut they were hiding they
[14:17] were
[14:17] they didn't want to be uh you know on
[14:20] the front line
[14:21] with no power with no blessing with no
[14:24] anointing
[14:25] they couldn't risk that they were
[14:27] following jesus
[14:28] and in obedience to jesus they
[14:31] were obeying the word and this is the
[14:33] whole thing about it
[14:34] jacob found himself in a place where
[14:37] even though
[14:38] and this is where he could have prayer
[14:39] certainly lord you told me to go back
[14:43] i'm scared i'm frightened
[14:46] and but you told me to go back i need
[14:49] you to be with me are you to help me
[14:51] i need to guide me and that is where
[14:53] jacob get this great encounter
[14:55] but he had a basis to call upon god and
[14:58] tonight
[14:59] you have that same basis so i pray
[15:01] tonight that god will bless us
[15:03] help us tonight and what we have to
[15:05] share with you tonight so tonight
[15:07] if you have your bibles i'd like you to
[15:09] turn to
[15:11] for proverbs chapter 16 i want to read
[15:14] verse 18
[15:15] to 19 and i don't know how much about
[15:19] bible studies distribute tonight
[15:21] but we will be sharing some things with
[15:23] you
[15:24] and also from second chronicles 7 14
[15:28] and we will go after that i'll see how
[15:30] it goes to first peter fight but let's
[15:31] just read verse
[15:33] proverbs 16 verse 18 to 19 pride go at
[15:36] before
[15:36] destruction and a holy spirit before a
[15:39] fall
[15:41] better it is to be of a humble spirit
[15:43] with the lowly
[15:45] than to divide the spoil with the proud
[15:49] and ii chronicles 7 14 is a familiar
[15:51] scripture scripture we
[15:53] read often we talk about it a lot if my
[15:56] people
[15:56] which are called by my name shall humble
[15:59] themselves and pray
[16:01] and seek my face and turn from their
[16:05] wicked ways
[16:06] then will i hear from heaven and will
[16:08] forgive their sin
[16:10] and will heal their life may god bless
[16:12] this world tonight
[16:14] i want to talk a little bit about
[16:17] pride and humility that's what i want to
[16:20] talk about tonight
[16:21] pride and humility
[16:25] now many times we make decisions
[16:31] which are comfortable to us within our
[16:34] comfort zone
[16:36] nobody likes to make how to should i say
[16:38] it
[16:39] hard decisions or tough decisions
[16:43] sometime in life you're called to do
[16:45] that with family with wife
[16:46] husband with friends with whoever tough
[16:50] choices in terms of decisions what
[16:52] you're going to act on
[16:54] what you're thinking and how you're
[16:55] going to act and what you're going to
[16:56] stand for
[16:58] it comes it comes down to the word
[17:01] you could have family father mother
[17:03] husband wife
[17:04] but when you come to the world you said
[17:06] no i'm staying with the word but what i
[17:07] want to say
[17:08] is this you have the power of choice of
[17:13] making decisions that you choose to be
[17:14] here tonight
[17:16] but you don't have power
[17:19] over the outcomes of your decisions
[17:23] many times we think we're in control
[17:26] we are not we are in control of our
[17:29] decisions
[17:31] we could say we gonna do this we can do
[17:34] that but the
[17:35] outcome of these decisions is where it
[17:38] comes a little different
[17:39] we could choose to love we could choose
[17:41] to hate
[17:43] we could choose to forgive or we could
[17:45] choose
[17:48] come that you could choose to be at
[17:49] peace i could choose to quarrel life is
[17:51] upset
[17:52] i've been upset your wife say something
[17:54] you could answer back or you could say
[17:55] nothing
[17:56] zip up and as you zip up you recognize
[17:59] listen
[18:00] she has nothing to ride on or he isn't
[18:02] the right one
[18:03] it stops right there you could choose to
[18:05] be fair
[18:06] or you could choose to be selfish all of
[18:08] these are our choices
[18:11] the choices we make are
[18:14] influenced by our knowledge our
[18:17] understanding
[18:19] our environment and the people that we
[18:22] associate with
[18:24] these are things that influence our
[18:26] decisions
[18:27] that's why they ever statement the bills
[18:29] of a feather flock together
[18:31] because they have a certain mindset
[18:34] and a certain influence that is dear and
[18:37] if there's a group think
[18:39] we think as the group thinks as opposed
[18:42] to
[18:43] coming into your own position and
[18:45] revelation
[18:47] so i'll say that again the choices we
[18:50] make
[18:50] are influenced by our knowledge
[18:55] if you don't know you make
[18:58] an uninformed decision because you don't
[19:01] know
[19:03] so i like to compare as knowledge as a
[19:05] role that is peeved
[19:08] and when you don't know it's like you
[19:10] hit a gravel road
[19:11] you're not sure so in order to
[19:14] continue you need to get information
[19:18] or knowledge that you could know where
[19:20] you're going and
[19:21] how you're getting to where you're going
[19:24] how do you get there
[19:25] so we could have ambition we could have
[19:29] desires but the question is how do we
[19:32] get to where we want to get
[19:34] that is when knowledge come in we don't
[19:36] have that knowledge
[19:38] then we are operating below the level of
[19:41] where we're supposed to be because we'll
[19:42] be operating from
[19:44] a level of shadows and ignorance
[19:47] and then some people don't like to admit
[19:49] that they don't know
[19:52] and therein lies a big big problem
[19:56] because it takes a certain level of
[19:59] humility to admit that you don't know
[20:02] and many times what you
[20:06] don't know is what get in trouble
[20:09] what you don't know so we need to know
[20:12] and we need to know if we know and if we
[20:15] don't know
[20:16] we need to humble ourselves to say you
[20:18] know what i want to know
[20:20] how can i know how can i learn jesus in
[20:24] the beginning say learn of me
[20:25] my youth is easy by burden is light we
[20:28] need to have a willingness
[20:30] to learn to know
[20:34] to grow many times because we feel we
[20:37] are
[20:37] older or maybe more greater
[20:41] we know but greater and older doesn't
[20:44] mean that you know
[20:46] you know to a certain extent but in the
[20:48] age that we're living in
[20:50] in which truly we see the fulfillment of
[20:52] scripture knowledge shall increase
[20:54] you recognize what you know 20 years ago
[20:56] not valid no
[20:58] it's not valid in the workplace it's not
[21:00] valid in management
[21:02] thoughts of management and and skill set
[21:05] and on what work place requires
[21:08] a lot of the stuff that is learned 15 20
[21:10] years ago is irrelevant now
[21:12] because of the times that we live in and
[21:16] similarly similarly a lot of stuff that
[21:18] we
[21:19] tolerated or accepted years ago it is no
[21:21] longer valid we can't work more
[21:23] telling my wife today i said you know
[21:26] this whole pandemic
[21:27] forces any preacher which is sought to
[21:29] get online
[21:31] anybody who don't know they have to know
[21:33] they have to know technology
[21:34] they have to know concerning the
[21:36] internet they have to know what's
[21:37] streaming
[21:38] if they didn't know they have to know if
[21:40] they want to survive
[21:41] the times like these
[21:45] so i want to challenge you tonight our
[21:47] choice
[21:48] are also influenced by our thoughts and
[21:51] the communion of our own hearts
[21:54] and we see certain things how you
[21:57] think how you process things
[22:01] it will take you yourself to to rethink
[22:04] and reprocess and that's why the bible
[22:06] says be transformed by the renewing
[22:08] of your mind you have to start somewhere
[22:11] that's why when the word comes or
[22:14] thoughts are shared
[22:15] the first things it hit is your mind
[22:18] because that is where it starts
[22:19] starts with how you think how you
[22:22] process things
[22:23] you know why i um
[22:26] i believe in accepting challenges i
[22:30] believe life is a challenge
[22:31] thing brother isaac is a message we
[22:33] prayed back he was talking about
[22:35] life being stressful and this is life
[22:37] you can't expect life to be without what
[22:40] you
[22:40] are presently in right now so don't ball
[22:44] don't uh just adjust your mind
[22:48] if this is what it is then i was born
[22:51] for this i was
[22:52] built for this this is what i'm here for
[22:55] the world why and how is me and why i
[22:58] should go through this no don't
[23:00] say that understand this
[23:03] that before we had all of this um god
[23:06] knew it there's going to be
[23:08] it's very interesting that all these
[23:10] so-called prophets
[23:12] listen listen all the so-called prophets
[23:15] didn't see this couldn't prophesy it
[23:19] and most of these so-called prophets
[23:22] only have prophesied lies because god
[23:24] didn't speak to them
[23:26] we understand that and these men with no
[23:28] shame whatsoever continue prophesying
[23:30] normal normal
[23:31] as if people supposed to listen to them
[23:33] and when god say when the fellows
[23:35] prophesy and they
[23:36] they come to pass don't listen to them
[23:38] cut them off because not speaking to
[23:40] them
[23:41] they're only performing behind some
[23:42] pulpit or some desk or something like
[23:44] that
[23:45] and prophesying lies to god's people but
[23:48] god isn't a genuine prophet in his last
[23:50] day
[23:50] according to scriptures behold i sent
[23:53] you elijah the prophet
[23:54] that man william branham genuine prophet
[23:57] he prophesy
[23:58] of the times that we're in right now we
[24:01] know it's not normal times
[24:03] we know it's have to do with a lot of
[24:04] stuff and all of that is germ warfares
[24:07] all kind of spiritual wickedness all
[24:09] kind of things like that to put pressure
[24:11] to turn up the heat satan is mad we are
[24:14] getting somewhere
[24:15] because we have a promise to come into
[24:17] perfection we have a promise to come
[24:19] into apostolic times
[24:21] and apostatic times is not going to come
[24:23] without a personal conditions
[24:25] all these are promises we have a promise
[24:28] of a press
[24:29] that will come down and we also have a
[24:31] promise of a pull
[24:32] that will be manifested all these are
[24:34] promises if we emphasize the press and
[24:36] you don't want to get depressed or get
[24:38] pressed
[24:39] then you know it is a whole transition
[24:42] of thoughts to study
[24:44] press and pressure as opposed to
[24:46] truthful and power
[24:47] and the restoration of the sons of god
[24:49] so i like to think
[24:51] about you know god uh
[24:54] coming to us by the way of the word that
[24:57] we could commune in our
[24:58] own hearts the things of god because
[25:00] communion in your own heart
[25:02] is like taking the word but as i could
[25:03] always say it's not studying it's
[25:05] meditation on the word where
[25:07] you know this becomes your thoughts you
[25:09] want to think the touch of god you want
[25:11] to
[25:11] what does god mean what does god think
[25:13] how does god feel about these things
[25:16] so what we think about what we speak
[25:19] about
[25:20] the atmosphere we live in influences our
[25:23] behavior
[25:24] let me say it again what we think what
[25:28] we talk
[25:29] the atmosphere we live in influences our
[25:32] behavior
[25:33] our actions and our decisions
[25:37] so let's flip the whole thing now if
[25:41] we could get in the right environment if
[25:44] we could fellowship and connect with the
[25:46] right people
[25:47] if we could get our torch change and
[25:50] transform
[25:51] that it would affect our words our words
[25:54] affect our behavior and our actions
[25:56] then we could see something positive and
[25:58] great coming out of this
[25:59] entire bunch of people because this has
[26:01] to happen
[26:03] i always believe when i used to get the
[26:05] spoken books in the beginning
[26:07] that this book it used to mark the
[26:10] spoken word
[26:12] and i always believe that
[26:15] these books and these tapes were
[26:17] released to us
[26:19] that we could know how to speak the word
[26:23] so then it's very troubling when you
[26:26] hear people speaking their own thoughts
[26:27] and they won't mind and
[26:28] you know you could see it's not
[26:30] saturated inside of them
[26:32] because when you begin to meditate on
[26:34] the word and begin to think about the
[26:36] word and think about what god promised
[26:38] it becomes a place where you know you
[26:40] are blending in with it
[26:42] and you begin to speak like it your your
[26:45] heart is
[26:46] is full of faith your heart is full of
[26:49] expectation
[26:50] you will have the mountains and the
[26:52] valleys the challenges and so on
[26:54] but you have great courage and one thing
[26:57] this last day bright gonna have
[26:58] is great courage so friends i want to
[27:00] encourage you tonight
[27:02] to look again at what torch is
[27:06] prevailing in your mind
[27:07] in your heart because as we get nearer
[27:11] to the coming of the lord we have to
[27:14] become more detached
[27:17] detach from our car house land
[27:20] money career whatever it is
[27:24] it must just be a tool that we have to
[27:27] use
[27:28] it not it must not be an anchor point
[27:31] where this is
[27:32] minds and this is what i have and that's
[27:34] why they rather talk about
[27:35] uh don't say don't say tomorrow i'll do
[27:37] this and next week i'll do that no say
[27:39] if the lord will
[27:40] and there's a reason for that and i'm
[27:43] seeing more and more
[27:44] that in making decisions how we really
[27:47] need to be
[27:48] in prayer asking god for his
[27:50] intervention
[27:51] and leading in in making decisions
[27:55] because what we don't know is the
[27:58] outcome
[27:58] of these decisions that we make
[28:01] decisions look right here
[28:02] i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do that i'm
[28:03] not gonna do this i'm not gonna do that
[28:05] but then because you move this way
[28:10] then this unfold
[28:13] you know as mike and i we talk a lot we
[28:15] fellowship a lot
[28:17] and it comes like this if i didn't marry
[28:21] or if angry was not my wife i don't know
[28:24] if i was gonna have three sons
[28:27] my decision in in having my wife to be
[28:30] who she is
[28:32] that decision produce three sons
[28:35] and those three sons they will have they
[28:37] have their own children now
[28:39] and you could see if i had get married
[28:43] to somebody else
[28:44] the results would be different the
[28:46] outcome was going to be different
[28:48] so you want god to guide your decisions
[28:52] that you could have the right outcome
[28:56] this is what it's about when god tells
[28:59] isaac that to him the sea gonna be
[29:02] and isaac dies he shall be called and
[29:05] his wife rebecca is
[29:06] barren that can't work
[29:09] how old is supposed to come to happen oh
[29:11] isaac could wrestle with god and say god
[29:13] you said the seat coming through this
[29:15] way my wife is no parent
[29:17] and i am going to implore and plead now
[29:20] when you catch these keys
[29:22] and this is a whole i just feel
[29:24] sometimes i don't know about you
[29:26] but forgive me i hope i hope it's
[29:30] come across right but i just feel i have
[29:33] to pray for the prayer meeting
[29:35] i have to pray for the bible study
[29:38] i have to pray for the service if i
[29:40] don't like i don't know what going to
[29:42] happen
[29:42] that's just me i don't know if it's from
[29:44] a shepherd's standpoint or from a
[29:46] past standpoint but i want you to feel
[29:48] the same way
[29:50] about praying in your own life don't
[29:53] just take things for granted don't just
[29:55] take it will work out you know like how
[29:57] somebody said you woke up by faith by my
[29:59] faith you will go
[30:00] no let it be guided by your prayer
[30:03] for it to work out let it be connected
[30:07] to heaven for it to work out so you're
[30:08] not
[30:09] experimenting you know that is why
[30:12] uh it is foolhardy it is foolish
[30:16] to distrust flesh and blood you
[30:19] have to come to the place where your
[30:22] confidence is in god the word
[30:25] if the pastor dies in the morning you
[30:27] don't die your feet don't die
[30:30] if the whole church collapse in the
[30:31] morning your feet don't collapse
[30:33] if the world collapses in the moon if
[30:35] this is it now we're heading down
[30:37] yeah you have to ask yourself well where
[30:39] is the fate
[30:40] you know because when the son of man
[30:42] cometh shall be fine look at the
[30:44] believers they
[30:45] on the depression they're on the
[30:46] frustration they can't take it no more
[30:48] but the question was that when the
[30:50] summer man comment but when he reveal
[30:51] himself
[30:52] shall we find fate on the earth where is
[30:55] the fate right now i feel like we're in
[30:58] caves
[30:59] you're in your own den in your house and
[31:01] they wonder about in sheepskins
[31:03] and coach destitutes and afflicted of
[31:06] whom the world was not worthy
[31:08] right now you're in your own cave and
[31:10] right now
[31:11] in your cave you are listen carefully
[31:14] an individual in god and you could have
[31:18] your own revival in your own cave
[31:20] right now you in your own little room
[31:24] right now you are in your own triple
[31:26] closet
[31:27] and tonight i want to address something
[31:29] with you
[31:30] concerning pride and humility
[31:33] and i want to first start it off at the
[31:35] level of
[31:36] the ministry that i want to stand up and
[31:39] that scripture i want to look at that
[31:41] is in first peter chapter five if you
[31:42] want to look at me
[31:44] we want to read from verse one to eleven
[31:45] first peter chapter five
[31:47] and this is paul and
[31:51] um this is the first piece of speaking
[31:53] here
[31:54] the elders which are among you i exhort
[31:57] she's talking to elders who
[31:58] i'm also an elder and a
[32:01] witness of the sufferings of christ
[32:05] and also a partaker of the glory that
[32:07] shall be revealed
[32:10] verse two feed the flock of god which is
[32:12] among you
[32:14] taking the oversight thereof not by
[32:16] constraint
[32:17] but willingly not for filthy luca
[32:20] but of already mind neither has been
[32:23] lords over god's heritage
[32:26] but being examples to the flock so when
[32:28] the chief shepherd shall appear
[32:31] he shall receive a crown of glory that
[32:33] faith is not away
[32:34] likewise ye younger
[32:37] submit yourselves unto the elder ye
[32:40] all of you be subject one to another
[32:44] and be clothed with humility watch that
[32:48] word now
[32:48] clothed with humility for god
[32:52] resisted the proud and give it
[32:55] grace to the humble think that part
[32:57] would repeat it
[32:58] be clothed with humility for god
[33:02] resisted the proud but give it grace to
[33:04] the humble
[33:05] verse six humble yourselves therefore
[33:09] under the mighty hand of god that
[33:12] he may exalt you in due time
[33:15] casting all your care upon him for he
[33:18] cared for you
[33:20] to believe that tonight that's a
[33:21] scripture he cared for you
[33:23] who's eight be sober
[33:26] be villager vigilant because your
[33:29] adversary the devil
[33:31] is a roaring lion walk it about seeking
[33:34] whom he may devour
[33:36] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[33:38] knowing
[33:39] that the same afflictions are
[33:41] accomplished in your brethren
[33:42] that are in the world but the god of
[33:45] world grace
[33:46] who had called us onto his eternal glory
[33:49] by christ jesus
[33:50] after you have suffered a while make you
[33:54] perfect
[33:55] establish strengthen settle you
[33:59] him be glory and dominion forever and
[34:02] ever amen
[34:03] now i want to read that in the amplified
[34:07] and uh we'll get some more into it
[34:10] speaking verse one in the amplified so
[34:13] just listen carefully i warn
[34:15] and conquer the elders among you the
[34:17] pastors and the spiritual guides of the
[34:19] church
[34:20] as a fellow elder as an eyewitness
[34:22] called to testify
[34:24] of the sufferings of christ as well as a
[34:26] sharer in the glory the honor and
[34:28] splendor that is
[34:29] revealed this close unfolded tend
[34:32] nurture guard guide
[34:36] unfold the flock of god that is your
[34:39] responsibility
[34:41] not by coercion or constraint
[34:44] but willingly not listen
[34:47] not dishonorably motivated by the
[34:50] advantages and profits
[34:52] belonging to the office but eagerly
[34:55] and cheerfully here we go deeper now
[34:58] not domineering as
[35:02] arrogant dictatorial and overbearing
[35:05] persons
[35:06] so in other words he's telling these
[35:09] brothers here there'll be no message
[35:10] poop
[35:12] there'll be no domineering arrogant
[35:16] dictatorial and ovarian person overdose
[35:19] in your
[35:19] church but being examples
[35:24] patterns and models of christian living
[35:26] to the flock
[35:27] the congregation then when the chief
[35:30] shepherd
[35:31] and i like how this is worded because he
[35:34] is talking to shepherds he's talking to
[35:35] ministers he's talking to elders
[35:37] so he's saying listen you might be a
[35:39] shepherd but this is the chief shepherd
[35:41] when the chief shepherd is revealed you
[35:44] will win the
[35:45] conquest crumb of glory and according to
[35:48] the younger ones
[35:49] likewise you who are younger one or of
[35:52] lesser rank
[35:53] be subject to the elders the ministers
[35:57] spiritual guys of the church giving them
[36:00] due respect
[36:01] and yield into their counsel clawed
[36:04] or apron yourself all of you with
[36:07] humility
[36:08] and then he yet as the god of a servant
[36:12] so that its covering cannot
[36:16] possibly be stripped from you with
[36:19] freedom from pride and arrogance towards
[36:22] one another
[36:23] for god sets himself against the proud
[36:27] the insolent the overbearing the
[36:30] distainful
[36:32] the presumptuous the boastful and he
[36:34] opposes and frustrates and defeats them
[36:38] but give grace favor blessing
[36:41] to the humble therefore humble yourself
[36:45] demote lure yourself
[36:48] in your own estimation under the mighty
[36:51] hand of god
[36:52] and in due time he may exalt you
[36:56] cast in the whole of your care all your
[36:59] anxieties
[37:00] all your worries all your concerns once
[37:03] and for
[37:03] all on him for he cares for you
[37:06] affectionately
[37:07] and cares about you watchfully be well
[37:10] balanced
[37:12] temperate sober of mine
[37:15] be vigilant and cautious at all times
[37:18] for that enemy of yours the devil rooms
[37:21] are wrong like a roaring lion
[37:22] in fierce hunger seeking someone to
[37:25] seize upon and devour
[37:27] withstand him be filming fate against
[37:30] his onset
[37:32] rooted established strong
[37:35] immovable and determined knowing that
[37:38] the same identical
[37:39] sufferings are pointed to your
[37:41] brotherhood the whole body of christians
[37:43] throughout the world
[37:44] and after you have suffered a while the
[37:47] god of all grace who imparts all
[37:49] blessing and favor
[37:50] was called you to his own eternal glory
[37:52] in christ jesus
[37:53] will himself complete and make you what
[37:56] you ought to be
[37:57] establish and ground you securely
[38:01] and strengthen and settle you to him be
[38:03] dominion power and glory
[38:05] you will forever and ever praise the
[38:07] lord amen you love that scripture
[38:08] tonight
[38:10] so starting from the top we want to
[38:13] start from the top and come down
[38:14] starting from the top we identify
[38:18] that the ministry and this is what how
[38:20] should i say it
[38:22] what i saw in trinidad what i saw under
[38:25] legalism i rejected
[38:29] and that is why uh everybody who knew me
[38:32] and fellowship with me
[38:33] that is why i didn't want people from
[38:35] other groups to come to our church
[38:38] i wanted to win souls for the field just
[38:40] sinners and share the word and
[38:42] that was my original vision and so on
[38:44] one
[38:45] reason was i was truly disturbed
[38:48] by the level of authority and legalism
[38:51] undone
[38:51] and domination that the pastors had
[38:54] in this message over the lives of the
[38:56] people and i pledge to god
[38:59] that if he would give me that
[39:00] opportunity i will never do that
[39:03] and i kept my word by god's grace and
[39:06] and
[39:06] and this i'm seeing is is is what god
[39:09] wants in jesus another scripture he said
[39:12] the gentiles exercise authority
[39:14] he said but don't do like that him that
[39:17] his greatest among you let himself
[39:18] jesus himself took on superman garment
[39:21] uh i have a servant you washed your feet
[39:24] and peter carry on don't wash my feet
[39:26] you see i don't know why i'm doing here
[39:27] now humble yourself
[39:29] and then jesus afterwards say you see
[39:31] what i do for you and you call me master
[39:33] and i want to do one for another so he
[39:36] was demonstrating clearly
[39:37] that he wanted that pattern of humility
[39:40] that pattern of
[39:43] like vulnerability then that you're not
[39:45] up here
[39:46] somewhere floating in some sky somewhere
[39:48] but you're one of them because
[39:50] what jesus become he became like one of
[39:52] them
[39:53] he wanted that demonstrated among his
[39:56] people
[39:57] so it had to start from the top so
[40:01] god we see by the scriptures resists the
[40:03] proud god have an attitude towards
[40:05] pride he has an attitude towards
[40:08] boosting
[40:09] how does this thing come about or
[40:12] sometimes somebody poor
[40:13] or they're struggling and god bless them
[40:15] with this and bless them with that and
[40:16] after a while
[40:17] man they can't tell them a word because
[40:20] now they
[40:21] they have arrived you see and
[40:24] because of their thoughts now instead of
[40:27] humbling themselves and saying lord i
[40:28] thank you
[40:29] for what you've blessed me with you find
[40:32] them that what they have is not enough
[40:34] you know what they have they want more
[40:38] and they want more because they're not
[40:39] feeling fulfilled
[40:41] and the devil keeps shifting this
[40:44] what i call it the gold pole the the
[40:47] gold post
[40:48] of fulfillment so if you get this here
[40:52] so you get car number eight but card
[40:54] number is where
[40:55] everybody has have that kind so you need
[40:57] car b because you want to look
[40:59] uh better than the rest and then you go
[41:00] to class c and of course if you get car
[41:03] d
[41:03] in a different class by yourself people
[41:05] say who goes but yeah liquidity right
[41:06] driving now
[41:07] so you see and in your mind you are
[41:10] thinking
[41:11] because let's put it not just from a
[41:13] human standpoint let's take it from
[41:15] something going on in your mind in your
[41:17] chemicals in your body
[41:18] and a man riding a bicycle and he's
[41:21] peddling and he is feeling fulfilled as
[41:23] ever
[41:24] joyful as ever as if he's driving a bmw
[41:27] mercedes-benz with some kind of i don't
[41:30] know whatever big car name engine
[41:32] and he is driving the road with true
[41:34] will and jesus he having a jubilee
[41:37] and you watching them hear a bicycle
[41:40] but he he's a different realm because
[41:43] that satisfaction
[41:45] is not a mind game for him it's a
[41:47] reality
[41:48] in the heart and god could give you that
[41:50] tonight i
[41:51] am not talking about no ambition and you
[41:54] have nothing and you're just
[41:55] you're very satisfied i'm not talking
[41:57] about foolishness that's the next
[41:58] foolishness business you know
[41:59] we don't talk about that now i'm talking
[42:01] about when
[42:02] people are unfulfilled they do a lot of
[42:05] stuff
[42:06] they see a lot of stuff they want to be
[42:08] recognized
[42:09] they want to be acknowledged if they
[42:11] want some kind of position on business
[42:12] say this is
[42:13] me i am here now this is where
[42:17] this humbling and humility it gets done
[42:20] to real because this thing
[42:22] is what does help kill you because
[42:24] tutoring is killing you know pride can
[42:26] kill your humility could kill you
[42:28] is which one you want to kill you
[42:30] because you see if you're going with
[42:32] pride
[42:34] god will resist you you will die but
[42:36] humanity also kills
[42:38] because humanity makes you take it wrong
[42:40] purely humility makes you
[42:42] accept and let things go and let things
[42:45] blow and
[42:46] you're waiting upon god humility help
[42:49] you
[42:49] to acquire wisdom because sometimes
[42:52] you're very right
[42:54] and sometimes like i told a brother
[42:57] who's have issues
[42:58] with his children and so on and say well
[43:00] sometimes you have to decide
[43:01] if you want to be right or you want a
[43:03] relationship with you with your family
[43:04] because you could be right
[43:06] and you have no relationship i remember
[43:07] this story about a man
[43:09] who his son are wearing his ears and
[43:12] doing this and playing basketball and
[43:14] he's not talking to his son or whatnot
[43:16] one day on the basketball field his son
[43:18] fell down and died
[43:19] going to find out he had a tumor in his
[43:21] brains and then the father
[43:23] of course in grief he regretted the fact
[43:26] that he did not have a relationship with
[43:28] his son
[43:28] all because of the way he thinking our
[43:31] son supposed to be
[43:32] as if well if you would not win earrings
[43:35] in your ears if you're not doing this
[43:36] if you're not wearing your dress if
[43:38] you're not doing this then i could talk
[43:39] with you
[43:42] were you wearing long pants when god
[43:44] called you
[43:45] how long was your dress what would be
[43:48] sinners
[43:50] and yet we sit down on some kind of a
[43:53] moses throne
[43:54] judging others based upon christianity
[43:57] our so-called holiness
[43:59] it doesn't make sense and god rejects
[44:01] that so when brother brown
[44:04] was condemning the woman in the
[44:05] restaurant and saying
[44:07] god why did you destroy this place
[44:11] the daughter of my daughter is this the
[44:12] place where my daughter wrote him god
[44:14] tapping my shoulder
[44:15] call him a sign begin to show him some
[44:17] of himself
[44:18] his sins show him the blood bumper show
[44:21] him
[44:22] i forgive you and he put your sincere
[44:24] forgiveness and look you condemning her
[44:26] that was a a real lesson for brother
[44:29] brown
[44:30] oh he's a prophet right he got pulled
[44:33] aside
[44:34] and led by god to show my whole vision
[44:36] this is you here
[44:37] this is your pardon come in here look
[44:39] how you condemn
[44:41] so long what about him supposed to do he
[44:43] goes to the woman and said woman i was
[44:44] just condemning you
[44:46] and what the lord showed me only to hear
[44:48] the woman was a christian
[44:50] and she was once as though the lord a
[44:51] husband ran away to our next woman
[44:53] and what kind of issues and and on the
[44:55] floor the woman was
[44:57] reconciled because but abram was able to
[45:00] intend to see the way god sees
[45:04] and i hope tonight that you could get a
[45:07] whisper
[45:08] a taste of how gorgeous not how he
[45:10] passes here
[45:11] not all your friendlies here people see
[45:13] cookie eyes people see all they want to
[45:14] see
[45:16] we're talking about how god sees
[45:20] you know one example again before we
[45:21] continue
[45:23] the political son we know this story
[45:25] something that we always go
[45:26] through about a guy he went off our
[45:28] country to get his money his father gave
[45:30] him
[45:30] holy father know the boys are all crazy
[45:32] uh you know
[45:34] while someone like that experience have
[45:36] to bring him through
[45:37] and so on and and yet he let the sun go
[45:41] now we might say god sadly i know you're
[45:43] not ready yet
[45:44] and we may hold back the money that's
[45:46] how we may think but this father decides
[45:48] to lose him let him go
[45:50] i know and he far so he had no advice to
[45:52] get no counsel
[45:54] he deliberately went far yeah he can
[45:57] pick pick food no money done
[45:59] and all the friends support all these
[46:01] support and hey you know what i mean
[46:03] everybody coming in live in here pizza
[46:05] you know chinese food
[46:06] and everything all the works it's
[46:08] finished now so
[46:10] it's an embarrassment raised art he's
[46:12] ashamed
[46:14] he don't know how to put it together
[46:17] so he's there he didn't pick food you
[46:19] know diamond best invested in
[46:21] the big food everything in jesus name
[46:22] amen sprinkling whatever pepper
[46:25] ketchup whatever he could put on it to
[46:26] make it kind of looking pleasing to make
[46:28] it sometimes
[46:29] imagine this of some course menu well
[46:31] you know
[46:32] but then the bible said he came to
[46:35] himself
[46:36] and i'm wondering if something used to
[46:39] bother me
[46:40] i think you're talking about my heart
[46:41] tonight so i'm just sharing with you and
[46:43] talking with you
[46:44] how do we get a people that sat down for
[46:47] 40 years listening to tapes books
[46:49] preachers ministers
[46:50] conventions stories mysteries how do you
[46:54] get them into action how do you get them
[46:56] out of this
[46:57] slot for sluggishness this casual
[47:00] yeah i know this prophet said you know i
[47:02] mean how do you get them into action
[47:03] what would move them
[47:06] said if love doesn't get your conditions
[47:08] will
[47:09] what if the wheels of conditions have
[47:12] already begin to turn
[47:14] what if we gather here tonight is part
[47:16] of the wheels
[47:17] of conditions turning to get us
[47:21] out of complacency out of lethargy
[47:25] and after a while the little home trials
[47:28] and testings you have been through that
[47:29] you call yourself suffering
[47:30] do you recommend die dinner suffering
[47:34] when the bible talk after you suffer a
[47:36] while that you may be
[47:38] strengthened and so on we're going to
[47:40] know is not that then
[47:41] what is yet to go through is that we
[47:43] don't remember because sometimes our
[47:46] suffering connected with our decisions
[47:47] and choices and
[47:48] it unfolds in outcomes but what we're
[47:51] talking about sufferings is things that
[47:53] god set up planned and arranged
[47:55] to put enough pressure on us to turn us
[47:59] the message that we played sunday
[48:02] there is a river staple was made there's
[48:06] two things that change the course
[48:07] of a river time and pressure
[48:12] i was anxiously looking forward for the
[48:14] lifting of this thing
[48:16] monday but we know based upon the
[48:19] figures of all
[48:20] the virus and people behavior it
[48:22] couldn't be possible
[48:24] so therefore we get an extension of time
[48:27] that we wasn't prepared for
[48:29] but that is what changes the course of a
[48:30] river time
[48:32] and pressure everybody like somebody
[48:36] will say
[48:37] bend back like a bow
[48:40] i want i wanted the easy tension bend
[48:43] back like a bow
[48:44] how long this ball bend you see you
[48:46] could break
[48:47] but the point about it is this time
[48:51] and pressure changes the course of a
[48:53] river
[48:55] we don't control the river we don't
[48:58] control the trials
[49:01] we don't control what comes or we but a
[49:04] lot depends
[49:05] upon our attitude to what comes
[49:08] our way and how we manage that oh praise
[49:11] the name of the lord let me see if i
[49:12] could continue a little bit
[49:15] who no we know that pride didn't
[49:18] originate on earth
[49:20] pride originated in heaven isaiah 14
[49:23] you'd have to find it i'll read it verse
[49:25] 12. how would dove fall from heaven or
[49:27] lucifer
[49:28] son of them how a dog cut down to the
[49:31] ground without this week in the nations
[49:33] for those said in thine heart i will
[49:35] ascend into him
[49:37] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[49:40] of god
[49:41] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[49:43] congregation
[49:45] in the size of the north so he wanted to
[49:46] be a pastor long time long time for the
[49:48] ministry
[49:50] i will ascend above the heights of the
[49:52] clouds
[49:53] i will be like the most high so he's an
[49:56] i man yet
[49:58] though shall be brought down to hell to
[50:00] the size of the
[50:01] pit and be that cd shall now look upon
[50:04] thee and consider this saying
[50:06] is this the man that make the earth to
[50:09] tremble
[50:10] and shake nations this is what
[50:13] the bible said will be said about him a
[50:16] man i will ascend
[50:17] i will be like i will rise above i will
[50:20] sit on top of
[50:22] i i i
[50:31] do are you fully seconded
[50:34] my mom says supposed to be god first
[50:37] family second you third
[50:39] what are you tonight do you want your
[50:42] own way and do you think
[50:43] that you will continue and get in your
[50:46] own way
[50:47] and that is why sometimes you find rich
[50:49] people cheering commit suicide all kind
[50:51] of drugs and whatnot because
[50:52] there is no discipline all what they
[50:54] need they buy they want their money is
[50:56] tear they don't have to think twice
[50:59] and so on but we are taught that
[51:01] character comes through suffering
[51:04] and is interested in descriptive mind
[51:06] after you suffer a while
[51:08] that suffer a while is in context of you
[51:10] not
[51:11] us you
[51:14] that suffer a while is individual
[51:17] it's not the church suffering and he
[51:20] writes afraid no no no no it doesn't
[51:21] look sweet
[51:23] when jesus went to wilderness he didn't
[51:24] take a bunch of people in
[51:26] the spirit led him him into the
[51:29] wilderness to be tested
[51:31] to be tempted or
[51:34] to be honed if i use simple brownfield
[51:37] or to be
[51:37] cut or to be shaped like how we say we
[51:41] got to be shaped down to the word
[51:42] now i can't shape you don't i can
[51:44] present the word
[51:45] but you have to be willing to receive it
[51:47] i can present help
[51:48] we can present help to you but you must
[51:51] be willing to accept it you must be
[51:53] willing to receive it
[51:54] hearing it doesn't mean you're accepting
[51:57] it looking at nice water and saying oh
[51:59] my that water is so clean
[52:00] it from the spring but you're not is
[52:04] only when you begin to say you know what
[52:06] yeah you know some sometimes i couple my
[52:08] one constraint the one constant
[52:10] but really sometimes both parties don't
[52:13] really want constant
[52:14] one make one consonant one push for
[52:16] consonant one push to act let us go to
[52:19] our counselor
[52:20] because one not getting true to the
[52:22] other partner here it is
[52:23] we can't continue so you know just not
[52:25] working out as we want
[52:27] so the other one is resisting because
[52:29] let's say he's a man he's in pride mode
[52:31] your wife one counselor
[52:32] your husband does not because he find
[52:34] you know i mean i want to talk to nobody
[52:36] i feel like i'm all right your wife say
[52:38] listen
[52:39] you're not seeing things good you're
[52:40] seeing things with the shade
[52:42] you know one sided green one side blue
[52:45] you're not seeing things right let's see
[52:46] if somebody else has about clear glasses
[52:48] that can help us and assist us and um so
[52:51] when you come to concert now your
[52:52] husband oh
[52:53] you have a blocker already he has a
[52:55] thing already because he really wasn't
[52:57] really wanted to come you know because
[52:58] your wife kind of push it that therefore
[53:01] you'll be passed and i'll have to sit
[53:02] down as if easy concern
[53:04] and started talking about nothing so
[53:06] you're talking ain't saying nothing i
[53:07] ain't
[53:07] easily nothing afterwards you like
[53:09] talking talking talking but you see
[53:11] in order for a couple to get help people
[53:13] get help it has to be a willingness
[53:16] to communicate to share you know maybe
[53:18] i'm not seeing it
[53:19] right yeah you may think you're right as
[53:23] a man
[53:23] or you may think you're right as a
[53:25] female as a woman but maybe
[53:27] best maybe you could be wrong in how you
[53:29] view things not wrong in terms of
[53:31] wrong absolutely wrong but in terms of
[53:34] not being
[53:35] balanced i know wars where somebody
[53:38] accustomed putting their shoes under
[53:39] their bed
[53:40] and next person have their shoes under
[53:41] the cupboard and they come together and
[53:43] married the husband comes some person in
[53:45] bed
[53:45] wife of course not putting his shoes in
[53:47] the cupboard and putting them at war
[53:49] because once they under the bed next
[53:50] time say in the cupboard
[53:52] now it might look petty it might look
[53:53] funny but to them it's a serious button
[53:57] and as pastor you sit down here and this
[53:59] kind of foolishness we go right
[54:02] but this is environment now and all it
[54:05] needs is a simple compromise
[54:07] let's put it on top somewhere you know i
[54:10] mean you could put it on top if you want
[54:11] but i'm saying these things are petty
[54:13] stuff that people could sit down
[54:15] and traditionally can say you know is
[54:17] this worth it
[54:19] sometimes there are battles that is not
[54:21] even worth it why go into it
[54:23] it's not even with him let it go
[54:26] it have too much more serious stuff to
[54:29] make
[54:29] certain issue our issue let it go
[54:33] give people time time to learn and to
[54:36] listen listener if you're not listening
[54:38] if you're not studying if you're not you
[54:40] know reading and studying and
[54:42] listening you're not growing
[54:46] the mechanics no long time mechanics
[54:48] number punches you
[54:50] plug points condenser these new electric
[54:52] cars
[54:56] listen i i know you said you could crank
[54:58] up in the beginning and put something in
[54:59] front of your tuners in front of study
[55:00] engineering
[55:01] you could wind it up and they graduated
[55:04] from that
[55:04] so a mechanic now in general has to
[55:07] update his skills
[55:08] to deal with what we have and i'm
[55:10] telling you now what we are facing now
[55:13] this is very very interesting i see god
[55:15] flatten the landscape
[55:17] all these so-called mighty men of god
[55:20] required since coronavirus come
[55:24] no more mighty talking they're quiet
[55:28] they're making nepalese and stuff but
[55:29] they're very very quiet
[55:31] because god's showing them who's the
[55:32] boss yet
[55:35] there's a promise of a super church yet
[55:38] there's a promotional super race
[55:39] either man in this message going to be
[55:41] adopted they can't even heal a truth
[55:45] no testimony no witness no nothing yet
[55:48] they claiming to be something yeah it's
[55:50] called a virus and all people could do
[55:52] is just watch
[55:54] watch but is that brother branham
[55:56] prophesied he said the bride
[55:57] no other power could wait would work in
[56:00] her
[56:01] she waits upon it she's waiting in love
[56:04] for the promise of the aid to be
[56:05] confirmed she is waiting her
[56:07] in love not in frustration not any
[56:09] pressure god can lie
[56:11] you can't tell me corona virus and all
[56:12] these diseases in charge of this world
[56:15] they're crazy how could that be when he
[56:17] says sons of god will stop cancer stop
[56:19] diseases
[56:20] stop plagues that's my promise that is
[56:22] your promise too
[56:24] we who are alive and remain we are
[56:25] looking to die now
[56:27] there must be somebody who alive and
[56:28] remain you also in this room
[56:31] somebody must be here to be alive and
[56:33] remain
[56:35] shallow in the devil of asleep but among
[56:37] us and all the others who going to sleep
[56:39] they are going to sleep but we are
[56:41] people here that are going to be alive
[56:43] and remain that will come to perfection
[56:45] in order to bring a resurrection
[56:47] oh my so i hope tonight that some of
[56:50] these things that we are sharing with
[56:51] you
[56:52] would really help you as a christian as
[56:53] a believer but obama was saying this he
[56:56] said
[56:57] he's talking about um
[57:00] we want to keep it running smoothly and
[57:02] sweetly in order for the lord now
[57:04] remember
[57:05] that your part may be the main spring or
[57:07] it may be a little
[57:08] a little hand or some little part of the
[57:11] wine and stem or maybe
[57:13] the face of the clock that tells the
[57:14] time but whatever it is it takes all of
[57:16] us together
[57:17] in harmony with the gospel of jesus
[57:19] christ to bring this to pass just think
[57:22] if gifts is so great and what we call
[57:25] power
[57:26] paul said this is barbara do i have
[57:28] faith
[57:29] that i can move mountain and after
[57:31] charity i am nothing
[57:32] think of that you said i i know i i wish
[57:35] i know the bible
[57:37] is i wish i knew the bible but do i
[57:39] understand all the mysteries of god
[57:42] and still do i could do it and have no
[57:45] charity
[57:45] i am nothing i haven't got noah yet see
[57:49] the main thing is to love god and
[57:52] humble yourself with it now surely after
[57:56] all these years on the field and around
[57:58] the world
[57:59] seeing different people i ought to know
[58:01] a little bit about the gate to enter in
[58:03] act and if you want to get somewhere
[58:05] with god
[58:07] let us be applied tonight if you want to
[58:09] get someone with god
[58:11] never let an arrogant spirit
[58:14] ever come around you don't let no
[58:17] malice come in no matter what anybody
[58:20] does
[58:21] if they are wrong don't you never build
[58:24] a complex
[58:26] against that person you be sweet
[58:29] and be kind remember god
[58:32] love you when you were in sin and if the
[58:35] spirit of god is in you
[58:37] you would love the other person when he
[58:39] is in wrong
[58:41] see just pray for them and love one
[58:43] another could you love somebody when
[58:45] they are in the room
[58:46] or you think about that this is
[58:49] so-called christian people now
[58:51] he wrong wrong yeah
[58:55] you know you're wrong god knows wrong
[58:57] but god looking to see
[58:59] if you could be like god if you could
[59:02] love like him
[59:04] and that is how the test came with those
[59:05] people making love in the church and
[59:07] say stop it please holy would you stop
[59:08] it stop it and they don't want to scare
[59:10] it
[59:10] and then the holy spirit come down if
[59:12] you say death they will die if you say
[59:13] blind they were blind
[59:14] whatever you see it will happen to them
[59:16] and they say i forgive you
[59:18] and this is what god wanted to hear
[59:22] god was so pleased because he has a son
[59:25] that have a heart like god now god knew
[59:29] adam was going to
[59:29] fall what the eve is going for but the
[59:33] point about it is that he already made a
[59:34] provision for them he
[59:35] turned his back and walked away he knew
[59:37] that he was dear
[59:38] and eve would hear the supernatural and
[59:41] what could unfold
[59:42] but along the way other things would
[59:45] unfold
[59:45] him being a redeemer a hero a deliverer
[59:48] restorer
[59:49] other things was going to unfold so
[59:51] sometimes your life
[59:52] as messed up but it might appear from a
[59:54] natural standpoint
[59:56] there are other things to unfold the
[59:58] other outcomes the outcome
[1:00:00] of what you may not understand that is
[1:00:02] where you trust god and what you don't
[1:00:04] understand
[1:00:05] and have confidence in romans 8 28 we
[1:00:07] know all things will work together for
[1:00:08] good
[1:00:09] to them that love god you actually take
[1:00:10] the word and you'll bow before it lord
[1:00:12] you always say all things all things
[1:00:14] good i don't understand this but lord
[1:00:16] work it out for your good i mean you see
[1:00:18] it work out for your honor
[1:00:19] and for your glory this is the situation
[1:00:21] this and you see
[1:00:22] and because everything is customized and
[1:00:24] it's not one size fits
[1:00:26] all you may go through sickness you may
[1:00:28] go through wife problem husband problem
[1:00:31] children problem labor problem
[1:00:32] job problem money problem social problem
[1:00:35] all kind of disabilities
[1:00:37] in your spirit in your heart and mind
[1:00:39] but god want to work it out for good
[1:00:41] you can look at all the different bible
[1:00:43] characters and see
[1:00:44] their different challenges and issues
[1:00:46] but they all came true as sons and
[1:00:48] daughters of god and you too
[1:00:49] will come true we have a guarantee that
[1:00:52] you will come true because this last day
[1:00:53] bright god i play with this last day
[1:00:54] break
[1:00:55] this last day bright belong to special
[1:00:57] forces this last day by belong to a
[1:00:59] special class of people
[1:01:00] he said this is a special class of
[1:01:01] people people that have the ability to
[1:01:03] hear from god
[1:01:04] that's number one i don't care what
[1:01:06] condition you're in tonight
[1:01:07] you have the ability to hear from god
[1:01:09] when that word speaks
[1:01:11] the ability is placed already inside of
[1:01:13] you he said that is why
[1:01:14] his father out of what you're in and
[1:01:16] struggle into what you're in
[1:01:17] it's staggering that's why god could
[1:01:19] call you up
[1:01:20] with no no reservation you see so you
[1:01:23] have to have the confidence that god
[1:01:25] who anointed martin luther wesley that
[1:01:28] same god called paul and rhema's nothing
[1:01:30] called number all these seventies
[1:01:32] messengers
[1:01:32] who is who has called you and if they
[1:01:35] didn't fail their duty to hold up that
[1:01:36] light
[1:01:37] you would not feel your duty to shine
[1:01:39] and hold up that light
[1:01:40] your call to shine that way do you
[1:01:42] believe that tonight
[1:01:44] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:01:46] brother braham said hear this now he
[1:01:47] said what
[1:01:51] he said never build a complex against
[1:01:52] that person you be kind and sweet
[1:01:54] remember god love you when you were sin
[1:01:55] above all he says
[1:01:58] love god love one another and be humble
[1:02:02] with god and around one another and god
[1:02:05] will bless us it's
[1:02:06] hard to tell what god will do when we
[1:02:08] operate like that right
[1:02:10] he said when god created me within
[1:02:11] branham i was before the function of the
[1:02:13] world
[1:02:13] he made my being my spirit i was not
[1:02:17] conscious of anything that signs i know
[1:02:19] he said now watch he said jesus were
[1:02:21] disciples he said i knew
[1:02:22] knew you before the function of the
[1:02:23] world and paul said it chosen in him
[1:02:26] before the world began now
[1:02:28] there was some part of me or my neville
[1:02:30] and the rest of you here
[1:02:31] in christ jesus before the world began
[1:02:34] and here to my analysis of that i
[1:02:38] think that the people today that are
[1:02:41] possessed with this spirit or the spirit
[1:02:44] is a part of these angelic beings
[1:02:46] spirits
[1:02:47] which rotated off of god that never fell
[1:02:50] in the beginning
[1:02:51] and resisted the devil's light now
[1:02:54] tutors of the earth is in sin
[1:02:55] and more than that which tutors of the
[1:02:57] angels was kicked out
[1:02:58] now those demon spirits come into people
[1:03:02] and habitate their body you see what i
[1:03:04] mean
[1:03:05] they are demons they won't exist they
[1:03:08] once existed
[1:03:09] and they come into people and give them
[1:03:11] a nature
[1:03:12] and jesus cast seven of them out of mary
[1:03:15] magdalene
[1:03:16] and begin to list them pride
[1:03:19] boast big people you see unclean
[1:03:23] filthy vulgarity emulation strife
[1:03:27] all these things there were spirits that
[1:03:29] would make a back deer
[1:03:31] and so on like that so therefore these
[1:03:33] prayers come down and give people a
[1:03:35] nature
[1:03:36] one of them being pride oh blessed be
[1:03:39] the name of the lord
[1:03:41] praise be to and and peter we know it
[1:03:45] and first peter you don't define it he
[1:03:47] says where are you greatly rejoice
[1:03:49] do not for a season if need be you're in
[1:03:52] heavy
[1:03:52] heaviness to manifold temptations that
[1:03:55] the trial of your faith
[1:03:56] being much more precious and of gold
[1:03:58] that perish it do it betrayed with fire
[1:04:01] i be found unto the praise and glory and
[1:04:03] honor of the appearance of jesus christ
[1:04:05] whom having not seen you love in whom do
[1:04:07] now you see him not yet believe in you
[1:04:09] rejoice
[1:04:10] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:04:12] receiving the end of your feed
[1:04:14] even the salvation of your souls oh
[1:04:17] praise the name of the lord philippians
[1:04:19] 2
[1:04:20] if there be any consolation of christ if
[1:04:22] any comfort of love
[1:04:23] any fellowship of spirit if any bowels
[1:04:25] have mercies fulfilling my joy
[1:04:28] that should be like-minded having the
[1:04:29] same love being of one accord of one
[1:04:31] mind
[1:04:32] here we go let nothing be done to strife
[1:04:35] or vain glory but in loneliness of mine
[1:04:38] let each esteem the other better than
[1:04:41] themselves
[1:04:42] so then the amplified of that say do
[1:04:44] nothing from fractional motives
[1:04:46] to contentiousness strife selfishness
[1:04:50] you ever see people i mean people who
[1:04:51] just like battle
[1:04:54] they don't feel good until they engage
[1:04:56] you in a you know
[1:04:58] in a fight you say something they oppose
[1:05:02] they are posed for opposing sake they
[1:05:04] want to know what you have to see and
[1:05:06] it's a cling and a
[1:05:08] that is not what the spirit of god is
[1:05:10] about do
[1:05:11] nothing to look for a fight you're not
[1:05:13] looking for a fight with people you're
[1:05:15] not going to fight with brethren
[1:05:17] okay is it do nothing from fractional
[1:05:19] motive to contentiousness strife and
[1:05:21] selfishness
[1:05:22] or for unworthy ends or prompted by
[1:05:25] conceit or empty arrogance
[1:05:27] instead in the true spirit of humility
[1:05:30] loneliness of mine and i want to stick
[1:05:32] with that humility as
[1:05:34] loneliness of mind let each
[1:05:38] regard the others better than them or
[1:05:40] superior themselves
[1:05:42] thinking more highly of one another than
[1:05:44] you do
[1:05:45] yourself so let's continue verse 6 verse
[1:05:49] was foreign look not every man and his
[1:05:51] own things
[1:05:52] but every man also the things of others
[1:05:54] let this mind be knew
[1:05:56] which was also in christ jesus who being
[1:05:59] the form of god tortured not robbery
[1:06:01] to be equipped with god but made himself
[1:06:03] of no reputation
[1:06:04] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:06:06] was made in the likeness of men
[1:06:08] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:06:12] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:06:15] death
[1:06:16] even the death of the cross he jesus
[1:06:19] what he
[1:06:20] humbled himself can you humble yourself
[1:06:24] and wherefore god give him a name and we
[1:06:26] know the story that
[1:06:27] in the name of jesus evanesh bow every
[1:06:29] time we should confess we're going
[1:06:30] quickly now
[1:06:34] i had a privilege in my life of meeting
[1:06:36] great men and it's remarkable to notice
[1:06:38] how vice versa things can be
[1:06:40] i've met men that was great men and i've
[1:06:42] met men who
[1:06:43] taught they were great men and there's a
[1:06:45] certainly a lot of difference in them
[1:06:47] a great man will always not be a stuffed
[1:06:50] shirt
[1:06:51] but he will try to make you think that
[1:06:52] you are the great man and he is nothing
[1:06:54] and the man that is nothing and trying
[1:06:56] to be great just the other way
[1:06:58] that's the reason i know jesus was the
[1:07:00] son of god
[1:07:01] he came to earth without even having a
[1:07:03] place to be born yet to borrow a womb
[1:07:06] with a borrow manger yet to come to a
[1:07:08] borrowed womb went through a poor
[1:07:09] grave the foxes are dense the birds have
[1:07:12] a
[1:07:13] ness but the son of god another place
[1:07:14] that lays head yet the king of glory
[1:07:16] the god of heaven made flesh well among
[1:07:18] us that would make him great
[1:07:21] humility the way down is all the way is
[1:07:23] the way up
[1:07:24] he just will humble himself god will
[1:07:26] exalt he that exalted himself would be a
[1:07:28] beast the way down is the way
[1:07:30] up for the believer humble himself
[1:07:33] before god jesus met with men of all
[1:07:36] walks of life
[1:07:37] he met in great sickles one time he was
[1:07:39] with thousands 500 at once
[1:07:42] 12 at once three at once even will come
[1:07:43] to one that makes him great
[1:07:46] because not even one person can ever
[1:07:48] call on him
[1:07:49] but that he will be right there at their
[1:07:51] side and that's what make him
[1:07:53] god is because of his humility and brahm
[1:07:56] talked about elijah
[1:07:58] and he said god and simplicity elijah
[1:07:59] humble himself stayed with god
[1:08:01] in such a way that it pleased god to
[1:08:03] take that same spirit
[1:08:05] show it three times down the road now
[1:08:07] you see
[1:08:08] while it was in a simple way and
[1:08:10] everybody was against him
[1:08:12] everybody what has that as a truth all
[1:08:14] the minister's association
[1:08:16] everything else was at his truth trying
[1:08:18] to get rid of him everything else but
[1:08:19] not simplicity even though they had
[1:08:21] no cooperation cooperation with his
[1:08:23] campaign whatever more
[1:08:25] they had everybody thought he was a
[1:08:27] crank god
[1:08:28] was hiding himself and when it comes
[1:08:31] time for that seat to get ripe
[1:08:32] that has been planted god manifested
[1:08:35] himself
[1:08:36] by sending fire out of him and licking
[1:08:39] up the sacrifice
[1:08:40] god hiding in simplicity and then
[1:08:42] revealing himself again
[1:08:44] god lives in simplicity to manifest
[1:08:47] himself in greatness
[1:08:48] what makes him great because he can
[1:08:50] simplify
[1:08:51] himself and talk about the story
[1:08:55] and i don't want to maybe i just want to
[1:08:57] just skip a little bit talk about a girl
[1:08:59] who had i guess you know the crutches
[1:09:02] and something like that the finnish girl
[1:09:04] stepping out there a little woman little
[1:09:06] girl 12 years old had two crutches on
[1:09:08] her
[1:09:08] arm and had a brace one limb was limp
[1:09:12] and shorter than the other
[1:09:13] she had no control of his leg it set a
[1:09:16] brace around her hip
[1:09:18] a big shoe snap-on toe strap went right
[1:09:20] back
[1:09:21] shoulder and hooked the brace i looked
[1:09:24] at her standing there little ragged
[1:09:25] looking here
[1:09:26] little kind of half brown blonde here
[1:09:29] chopped off with scissors
[1:09:30] later i learned you as a finished war
[1:09:32] orphan a modern fadari
[1:09:34] was killed during the time of the war
[1:09:36] she looked at me
[1:09:37] and they gave orders not to say nothing
[1:09:39] to you on the street she told she had
[1:09:41] done something wrong with that child
[1:09:42] she dropped her leg stood there on the
[1:09:45] on the little crutches i seen her little
[1:09:46] blue eyes look up towards me again
[1:09:48] i stopped the soldier's motion i
[1:09:51] couldn't speak a word to them they all
[1:09:52] spoke
[1:09:53] finish i told them just a minute the
[1:09:55] other two soldiers walk
[1:09:57] on and turn to look back to see what
[1:09:59] happened
[1:10:00] i motion to them i look at the child
[1:10:02] again she looked at me i
[1:10:04] i just something told me that baby
[1:10:06] wanted to come over here and i
[1:10:07] looked at building and motioned her to
[1:10:10] come here
[1:10:11] she took a little crutches on their arm
[1:10:13] she started pulling a little shoulder
[1:10:15] she'd come out i just stood still and
[1:10:17] she come right out to where i was like
[1:10:19] that
[1:10:20] i watched to see what the child was
[1:10:23] going to do
[1:10:24] she stood there with a little head bow
[1:10:27] down a few minutes
[1:10:28] i watched dropping on the floor little
[1:10:31] tears dropping out of them
[1:10:33] little eyes dropping down like that and
[1:10:35] i thought poor little thing
[1:10:37] and she reached over and took a hold of
[1:10:38] my coat and pulled it up her little
[1:10:41] hands
[1:10:42] and rubbed it and her little hands were
[1:10:44] dirty
[1:10:45] and she kissed my coat she dropped the
[1:10:47] coat down

[1:11:08] going listen
[1:11:10] so he's he's in that atmosphere
[1:11:13] and he's looking at like a vision break
[1:11:16] i see him going and walking right down
[1:11:18] through the room or walking without
[1:11:20] crutches i
[1:11:22] know it would happen i know god will
[1:11:25] honor that kind of faith
[1:11:27] i have been if i had been the lowest
[1:11:29] hypocrite
[1:11:30] in the world god would have honored that
[1:11:34] fate in that child i seen the child
[1:11:36] going walking i said honey
[1:11:38] you're healed jesus had made you of
[1:11:40] course she couldn't hear what i was
[1:11:42] saying
[1:11:43] she was crying you know seeing kittens
[1:11:46] she taught you done wrong you know they
[1:11:48] kept pushing me on so brother baxter
[1:11:50] come to the door
[1:11:51] and wanted to find out where i was at
[1:11:54] so he's tell her she is here she is
[1:11:57] still in the crutches
[1:11:59] she can't understand his english
[1:12:03] he knows she is here by vision and yet
[1:12:06] she's in that condition
[1:12:07] let's continue i went on in we prayed
[1:12:10] for several sick and you notice the
[1:12:11] crutches
[1:12:12] pile up and they put them in big carts
[1:12:14] to hold them away and i just fixing to
[1:12:16] leave the building
[1:12:17] my virgin a bunch of them had come and
[1:12:19] got me to take off the platform
[1:12:21] i was just fixing to leave and i taught
[1:12:23] i'm going to try a few more
[1:12:25] i've got to call some more of those
[1:12:27] cards
[1:12:28] and the holy spirit would move out over
[1:12:30] the audience
[1:12:31] they'll have to get an interpreter and
[1:12:33] tell the people oh dear
[1:12:34] i didn't know their language tell them
[1:12:37] where they was at
[1:12:38] and what they were doing and what they
[1:12:39] were suffering with and the interpreter
[1:12:41] would have to see it
[1:12:43] and that settled it all just threw down
[1:12:45] the crutches and canes and started
[1:12:46] running
[1:12:47] i said call a few more of the cars and
[1:12:50] then they did
[1:12:51] and by god's providence they say they
[1:12:54] want to take him off he said call a few
[1:12:56] more cats
[1:12:57] and then by god's providence the next
[1:12:59] one
[1:13:00] was that little girl she had the next
[1:13:03] card number
[1:13:04] and here she come she was just smiling
[1:13:07] you know
[1:13:07] one little two out in front she was
[1:13:09] smiling you know
[1:13:10] trying to get to me i said to
[1:13:12] interpreter
[1:13:13] just say what i say she said all right
[1:13:16] brother branham
[1:13:17] i said you're going to see something
[1:13:20] already took place
[1:13:21] i said sweetheart you and a little girl
[1:13:23] that i met
[1:13:24] out a while ago she nodded ahead as the
[1:13:27] interpreter spoke
[1:13:29] i said listen to these words now we're
[1:13:31] gonna close
[1:13:34] prisoner okay i said
[1:13:37] your respect to jesus christ
[1:13:42] your approach in the right manner
[1:13:45] that's a lot of times the way we
[1:13:47] americans don't get anything
[1:13:50] we don't come to god reverent
[1:13:54] enough don't you think so
[1:13:57] we just know more about it god lives in
[1:13:59] humility
[1:14:00] and simplicity so i said god rewarded
[1:14:03] you honey
[1:14:04] he healed you oh dear and i want you to
[1:14:07] go
[1:14:08] over here and sit down and get some of
[1:14:11] the men to unbuckle these braces
[1:14:14] and things from around you and let your
[1:14:16] head
[1:14:17] sit on your hip and just as they bring
[1:14:20] the braces off
[1:14:21] let your little hand slide down your leg
[1:14:23] just as far as your leg is
[1:14:25] short i said now you do that over there
[1:14:29] then
[1:14:29] show me so then i called the next one
[1:14:32] and the holy spirit was showing in the
[1:14:33] vision
[1:14:34] and while the vision was going on i
[1:14:37] heard a scream
[1:14:38] and here she come across the floor with
[1:14:41] crutches in her hands and braces
[1:14:42] overhead
[1:14:43] screaming at the top of her voice right
[1:14:45] up the step she went
[1:14:47] right down across the other way little
[1:14:49] bare feet just running
[1:14:50] hard as she could she is perfectly
[1:14:52] normal
[1:14:54] well because a respect and love to jesus
[1:14:58] christ
[1:14:58] brought his blessing down upon her
[1:15:02] oh my humility a
[1:15:05] modest or low view
[1:15:08] of one's own self-importance and this is
[1:15:11] by your author
[1:15:12] andrew murray humility is a part of debt
[1:15:15] because in debt it gives the highest
[1:15:17] proof of his perfection humility
[1:15:20] is the blossom to which debt to self is
[1:15:22] the perfect fruit
[1:15:24] jesus humbled himself unto death
[1:15:27] and opened a part in which we too must
[1:15:30] walk
[1:15:31] there is no way for him to prove his
[1:15:33] surrender to god
[1:15:34] to the uttermost or to give up and rise
[1:15:36] out of the human nature
[1:15:38] to the glory of father by true dead
[1:15:41] humility
[1:15:42] must lead us to die to self so we prove
[1:15:45] how holy we have given ourselves up
[1:15:47] to it unto god amen
[1:15:51] his humility give his debt value
[1:15:54] and so it become a redemption i want to
[1:15:55] say this way jesus
[1:15:58] this humility lord is not my will that i
[1:16:00] will not my will die will be done
[1:16:02] and let to not discourage and him
[1:16:05] yielding to
[1:16:06] pay that price through that he purchased
[1:16:09] our redemption
[1:16:10] what about him and i'm going to wrap up
[1:16:13] he's a church of businessmen let's not
[1:16:14] lose our influence
[1:16:16] let's cover our faces this morning lord
[1:16:19] i'm nothing
[1:16:20] lord moan me make me a new i'm down in
[1:16:23] the temple let me cover my feet lord i
[1:16:25] am nothing
[1:16:25] and this is from the mystical influence
[1:16:27] we talk about the seraphim the two wings
[1:16:29] fly two wings cover their feet
[1:16:31] and two men cover their face and talking
[1:16:33] about an action and humility and
[1:16:34] reverence he said who will go for us
[1:16:36] isaac i said
[1:16:38] he said he am i sent me your life will
[1:16:41] influence your family
[1:16:43] it will influence your neighbor it will
[1:16:45] influence your church
[1:16:47] you just put one or two good members in
[1:16:50] a church that
[1:16:51] really on fire for god it will do
[1:16:53] something for that church more than
[1:16:54] forte virus could have
[1:16:56] a good cleansed member
[1:16:59] set an example on the face shining with
[1:17:02] the glory of god
[1:17:02] with sweetness and humility to stand
[1:17:05] there in the power of god and
[1:17:06] watch when someone gets sick they will
[1:17:09] call that person to pray for them
[1:17:11] you might make fun of them and so forth
[1:17:14] you might
[1:17:14] all this nonsense say but let dead
[1:17:17] strike you one time you'll find out
[1:17:19] them struggles begin to come that's the
[1:17:21] real sincere person in the church
[1:17:23] oh my we don't cover our faces
[1:17:26] our feet right our wings won't work we
[1:17:28] got the wings spread out
[1:17:30] you know cover yourself humble yourself
[1:17:34] and then get into action and it's
[1:17:36] amazing
[1:17:37] that exactly that right here in this
[1:17:40] message
[1:17:41] where he prophesied this what we have
[1:17:43] seen happen
[1:17:44] should put every soul in action it
[1:17:47] should make a church
[1:17:48] that would make a revival here in

[1:21:41] touch them
[1:21:42] in the time of needs and struggle
[1:21:45] because we don't have any idea what the
[1:21:48] people are going through
[1:21:50] in their hearts and in their minds we
[1:21:52] speak
[1:21:53] we speak to a dark lord darkly
[1:21:56] through a glass lord we we speak but we
[1:21:59] don't even know what's really going on
[1:22:01] in the hearts and lives
[1:22:02] of your children but you know father and
[1:22:04] i pray the great comfort of god
[1:22:06] will comfort them the great assurance of
[1:22:08] god would work with them
[1:22:11] that you would bless them jesus when you
[1:22:13] were here on earth and you were about to
[1:22:15] leave
[1:22:16] you told your only disciples i will not
[1:22:17] leave you comfortless
[1:22:19] i wouldn't leave you as orphans but uh
[1:22:21] i'm gonna come i'm gonna send you
[1:22:23] another comforter the word being with
[1:22:25] them was one comfort
[1:22:27] but they needed something more they
[1:22:29] needed something greater
[1:22:30] they needed something within father to
[1:22:33] some people the churches are comfort
[1:22:34] to some people the pastor is a comfort
[1:22:37] some people friends in the church and
[1:22:38] other believers are comfort
[1:22:40] but that can't hold in this great hour
[1:22:42] and time and need
[1:22:44] they have to get another comforter
[1:22:45] father father of confidence the holy
[1:22:47] ghost
[1:22:48] and they promise you shall receive power
[1:22:50] after holding the scout upon your father
[1:22:52] i pray tonight that the holy ghost will
[1:22:54] come and quit me quitting the people to
[1:22:55] the world
[1:22:56] may they understand my revelation
[1:22:58] legalism cannot take them into the
[1:23:00] kingdom
[1:23:00] it's the grace and the power and the
[1:23:03] mercies of god
[1:23:04] release your fire once more once more
[1:23:06] release your anointing father
[1:23:08] break every yoke the people get their
[1:23:10] individual experiences with you
[1:23:12] as you speak to them as you rule them by
[1:23:15] your spirit
[1:23:16] as that dove is quinn leading guiding
[1:23:19] to guide him that they could be stripped
[1:23:21] of the lust of the eyes
[1:23:22] the lust of the flesh and the pride of
[1:23:25] life strip us tonight father may we
[1:23:27] get disconnected from the world truly by
[1:23:29] things of the world
[1:23:30] and may we have the freedom and the
[1:23:32] liberty to be free from pride
[1:23:34] free from jealousy from envy free from
[1:23:36] fear
[1:23:37] free from unbelief and just surrender
[1:23:39] completely to you
[1:23:41] god bless the service tomorrow that will
[1:23:43] be stream life
[1:23:44] father god may the entire end and may
[1:23:46] the anointing of god flow freely among
[1:23:47] your people
[1:23:48] i commit their lives in their hands in
[1:23:50] jesus name i ask it
[1:23:51] amen and amen god bless you saints uh
[1:23:55] it's great
[1:23:55] medicine to you tonight and um i'm
[1:23:58] looking forward to see what the lord
[1:24:00] will do
[1:24:01] it might not have been much of a bible
[1:24:03] study as such
[1:24:04] but uh i believe it's something that
[1:24:08] when i recognize that i have to speak
[1:24:09] tonight just come to my heart about
[1:24:11] about pride and humility and there are
[1:24:13] too many
[1:24:14] arrogant people too much arrogant pride
[1:24:17] proud for people and
[1:24:19] and um notice that there was a shortcut
[1:24:21] from egypt
[1:24:22] to the promised land what god did he led
[1:24:25] them
[1:24:25] the long way hoping that they forget the
[1:24:27] garlic and the leaks and
[1:24:29] all this stuff they had back there the
[1:24:31] bible said he humbled them and proved
[1:24:33] them
[1:24:33] to prove them to see what was in their
[1:24:35] heart and many times
[1:24:37] issues and testings and situations come
[1:24:40] all to see what's in our heart when
[1:24:43] brother branham saw a little girl
[1:24:45] and he called her to come he said he
[1:24:47] watched to see what she will do
[1:24:49] her respects to jesus christ her
[1:24:51] respects and faith in god brahma says if
[1:24:53] he was a hypocrite
[1:24:55] god was going to honor the fate so watch
[1:24:57] this
[1:24:58] it wasn't so much about abraham it was
[1:25:01] the faith
[1:25:02] that was in nothing to girl and if not
[1:25:05] so much of the pastor the preacher was
[1:25:07] the fate that you have
[1:25:08] in your soul tonight god be with you god
[1:25:11] bless you have a great night
[1:25:12] thanks again for being here god bless
[1:25:14] you we love you
