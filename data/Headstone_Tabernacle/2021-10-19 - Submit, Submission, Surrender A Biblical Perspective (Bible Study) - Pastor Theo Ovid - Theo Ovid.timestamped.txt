[11:13] final warning
[11:14] do not cross the line
[11:16] and
[11:18] you know it's
[11:20] really powerful the quote from brother
[11:22] branham seeing
[11:24] young people at the old tennessee it was
[11:26] too late
[11:27] they cross the line
[11:29] but our eyes are plotted by the word
[11:31] lines are to define a defined marketion
[11:34] uh aligned to define where you're
[11:37] supposed to be and where you're not
[11:38] supposed to be we're not supposed to
[11:39] cross
[11:40] so so friends i trust then that you
[11:43] realize that
[11:44] is not man speaking as god speaking
[11:47] god is speaking by his word
[11:49] and if we take that word our hearts
[11:52] will be blessed and benefited tonight
[11:55] i have something up on my heart i
[11:58] i um
[12:00] i
[12:01] really
[12:04] let's see how it goes i would see what
[12:05] the lord will say
[12:06] philippians chapter 2 we want to look at
[12:08] that scripture tonight phillips chapter
[12:10] 2
[12:11] and you want to read from verse 3 to 11
[12:13] you want to start up with philippians
[12:14] chapter 2 you have your bibles
[12:16] have your bibles ready
[12:19] we infer feast tonight and the word
[12:22] philippians chapter 2 reading from verse
[12:24] 3.
[12:25] it says let nothing be done to strive
[12:27] for vain glory
[12:29] but in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[12:32] the other
[12:33] better than themselves
[12:35] look not every man on his own things but
[12:38] every man also on the things of others
[12:41] let this mind be in you
[12:43] which was also in christ jesus
[12:46] who
[12:47] being in the form of god
[12:49] taught it not a robbery to be equal with
[12:51] god
[12:52] so that established the level where he
[12:54] was at
[12:56] form of god
[12:57] no robbery to be equipped with god but
[13:00] who said
[13:01] made himself of no reputation
[13:03] that is what other people think about
[13:05] you it's not about a character now
[13:08] so many have no reputation and took upon
[13:10] him the form of a silver
[13:14] and was made in the likeness of men
[13:16] and being found in fashion as a man
[13:20] there we go he humbled himself
[13:22] and became obedient
[13:24] humbled
[13:26] himself
[13:28] and became obedient unto death even the
[13:30] death of the cross
[13:32] before god at all highly exalted him
[13:34] give him a name which is above every
[13:36] name
[13:38] that at the name of jesus every knee
[13:39] should bow of things in heaven things in
[13:42] earth things under the earth and that
[13:45] every tongue should confess that jesus
[13:47] christ
[13:48] is lord
[13:49] to the glory of god
[13:52] tonight
[13:54] the title i have tonight
[13:56] is submit
[13:58] submission
[14:01] surrender
[14:02] a biblical perspective
[14:06] three s
[14:07] words
[14:08] submit
[14:10] submission
[14:12] surrender
[14:14] from a biblical perspective
[14:17] let's look at the meaning of these words
[14:20] submit
[14:22] a verb
[14:23] it says to accept or yield
[14:26] to a superior force
[14:28] or to the authority or will of another
[14:31] person
[14:32] to yield a governance
[14:34] or authority
[14:38] to defer or to consent to abide
[14:41] by the opinion or authority of another
[14:45] not a meaning to yield oneself
[14:49] to the authority or will of another
[14:51] surrender
[14:54] the
[14:56] meaning of submission
[14:58] submissions are known it says the action
[15:01] of accepting or yielding to a superior
[15:05] force
[15:06] or to the will or authority of another
[15:08] person
[15:11] next the condition of being submissive
[15:15] humble
[15:16] or compliant
[15:18] third an act of submitting to the
[15:21] authority
[15:22] or control of
[15:24] another and for surrender verb
[15:29] it has here
[15:30] stop resisting to an enemy or opponent
[15:34] and submit to the authority
[15:37] to to yield to the power control
[15:42] or possession of another upon compulsion
[15:45] or demand
[15:46] three
[15:48] to give oneself up
[15:50] into the power
[15:51] of another especially as a prison
[15:54] now i read these things as a backdrop
[15:57] to where we want to go and what we want
[15:59] to share tonight
[16:01] and if you have your bibles that's
[16:02] continues to james 4
[16:04] you want to read
[16:06] from verse
[16:07] from james 4.
[16:10] this is an important one and we will see
[16:12] what the lord say to us through this
[16:15] scripture
[16:16] and james
[16:19] chapter four verse one from whence come
[16:21] wars and fighters among you
[16:24] comedy not hence even
[16:26] of your lust
[16:28] that war in your members
[16:30] he lust and have not
[16:32] you kill and desire to have
[16:35] and cannot obtain
[16:37] a fight and war yet you have not because
[16:41] you ask that
[16:43] and you ask
[16:45] and receive not why
[16:47] because your acts are missed that you
[16:49] may consume it upon your lust
[16:51] he adulterers
[16:53] and adulteresses
[16:54] knowing not
[16:56] that the friendship of the world is
[16:58] enmity with god
[17:00] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[17:02] the world is the enemy of god now
[17:05] this scripture here is powerful
[17:07] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[17:09] the world is the enemy of god
[17:11] do you
[17:13] think that the scripture certain vein
[17:15] the spirit that dwelleth in us lusted to
[17:18] envy but he gave it more grace wherefore
[17:21] he see it god
[17:23] resisted the proud
[17:25] but gave it grace unto the humble
[17:28] and this is the verse you want to get
[17:29] here to
[17:30] submit yourselves therefore to god
[17:34] resist the devil
[17:36] and he will flee from you
[17:38] note
[17:39] it didn't say resist the devil he shall
[17:41] flee
[17:42] it start off with
[17:44] submit yourselves
[17:46] therefore to god
[17:48] so in submission
[17:50] to god
[17:51] the power to resist the devil
[17:54] will be activated and he will free from
[17:56] you
[17:57] eight draw knight a god he will draw
[17:58] nigh to you cleanse your hands he
[18:01] sinners
[18:02] and purify your hearts he double-minded
[18:05] be afflicted
[18:07] and mourn weep
[18:09] let your laughter be turned into
[18:10] mourning
[18:11] and your joy to heaviness humble
[18:14] yourselves in the sight of the lord
[18:17] and they shall lift you up
[18:19] now if you notice the first scripture we
[18:21] read
[18:22] the
[18:23] jesus humbled himself and became
[18:25] obedient
[18:27] we also know
[18:29] that jesus learned obedience
[18:32] now we are not born with humility
[18:35] we are not born with obedience
[18:37] we are not born being submissive
[18:41] and willing
[18:43] that is not how we are born
[18:45] we are born in sin and shape iniquity
[18:49] and having
[18:50] a spirit of rebellion a rebellion
[18:52] against god a rebellion against its
[18:54] principles now
[18:56] what
[18:58] submission is now many believers and
[19:00] christians
[19:02] and i say this way have a false idea
[19:06] of what submission means in the bible
[19:10] it is interpreted as
[19:12] taken away by liberty
[19:14] oppression
[19:15] and especially in regards
[19:17] to paul's teaching
[19:19] on wives
[19:21] submit to your own husband
[19:25] this scripture has been taken as a
[19:27] recipe for mistreating and abusing wise
[19:31] but paul
[19:33] clearly states husbands love your wives
[19:36] as christ loved the church
[19:40] and give himself for it
[19:42] further
[19:43] he said this is a great mystery but i
[19:46] speak on christ
[19:48] and the church
[19:50] so the real context of submission
[19:53] has to do first with really christ
[19:57] and the church
[19:59] so clearly
[20:01] real submission is based on love
[20:05] the husband
[20:06] submits to christ
[20:09] reflecting or acting out
[20:12] christ's love for the church
[20:15] in return
[20:17] the wife willingly surrenders to her
[20:19] husband
[20:20] and this biblical submission
[20:23] brings about the correct relationship
[20:26] between husbands and wife
[20:29] and christ
[20:31] and the church
[20:33] doesn't bring the wife
[20:36] afraid of her husband
[20:38] it doesn't make the wife cannot say
[20:40] anything to her husband
[20:41] because their husband make us zip up
[20:44] and put tape on her mouth
[20:48] she
[20:49] cannot be
[20:51] and will not be
[20:52] an effective
[20:54] help meet
[20:55] for him
[20:57] and that is
[20:58] the rule of a wise
[21:00] there was no meat help for him
[21:03] and in that role now i don't just want
[21:05] you to see relationship
[21:07] i want you to see also the context of
[21:10] christ
[21:11] and the church
[21:12] so it's not
[21:14] that a woman under oppression
[21:16] and you want me to do this and you want
[21:19] me to do that and no it's not about that
[21:22] it's about the love being extended and
[21:24] you surrender into that love it's not
[21:27] about abuse it's not that at all so we
[21:29] want to go a little deeper
[21:30] and i trust that this would help
[21:32] all of us here tonight
[21:35] okay now christ
[21:37] was submissive to the father
[21:40] this is where this come from
[21:42] so it's not a matter of a teaching that
[21:45] was not expressed by jesus himself but
[21:48] he was submissive to the father we know
[21:50] the scriptures i always do that which
[21:52] pleases my father he humbled himself
[21:56] and become obedient
[21:58] therefore from a natural position then
[22:01] we could say
[22:02] if you cannot submit to your husband
[22:06] how can you submit to god i want you to
[22:09] think about that now
[22:10] if you cannot submit to your husband
[22:14] how can you submit to god now if the
[22:16] husband
[22:17] cannot submit to christ
[22:20] how do you want your wife to submit to
[22:22] you
[22:24] because your life as a husband
[22:26] should be a submissive life to god and
[22:29] to christ
[22:30] that she could see
[22:32] your willingness
[22:34] your interests
[22:36] your leading
[22:38] to want
[22:39] god's will
[22:40] for your life
[22:43] so therefore jesus
[22:45] even though he was god
[22:47] even though he
[22:48] taught enough robbery to be equal of god
[22:51] watch the form he took him
[22:53] he took on the form of a servant
[22:56] to accomplish god's will
[22:58] and purpose
[23:01] facing death
[23:03] his words were not my will
[23:05] but dying
[23:07] be done
[23:08] now
[23:09] this thing about submission as i said
[23:11] we're not born with it
[23:13] we're not gifted with it
[23:15] we are not graced with it
[23:17] romans 8
[23:19] and this scripture from romans 8 1 says
[23:22] there is therefore no no condemnation to
[23:24] them that are in christ jesus who was
[23:26] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[23:29] okay now
[23:30] i'm reading the scripture because i want
[23:32] to identify
[23:34] that jesus
[23:37] walk on this earth
[23:39] pleasing the father
[23:41] his job is objective this is where
[23:45] submission gets its roots if i could see
[23:48] it that way
[23:49] submission
[23:51] gets its roots or part of the roots of
[23:54] submission
[23:55] have to do with pleasing the father
[23:58] or pleasing god what pleases him
[24:01] and the bible says
[24:03] that
[24:04] the for day this is verse 5
[24:07] that are after the flesh
[24:10] do mind the things of the flesh
[24:12] but deed
[24:14] after the spirit the things of the
[24:15] spirit
[24:16] four here we go to be carnally minded is
[24:19] death
[24:20] but to be spiritually minded
[24:23] is life and peace because why why
[24:27] the carnal mind is enmity against god
[24:30] obeying mind this is the mind we born
[24:32] with
[24:33] we've been born spiritual it's a carnal
[24:36] mind
[24:37] so this mind that we have
[24:40] it was enmity against god
[24:43] that is why god gave the offer a new
[24:45] heart i will give you give us an
[24:46] exchange i'll take your whole heart out
[24:48] i'll give you a new spirit okay he's
[24:51] extend the order deeper than that and
[24:52] then i'll put my spirit
[24:54] so he gave us a three-step offer
[24:56] for change and transformation
[24:58] and the reason that the carnal mind is
[25:00] enmity against god for it is not subject
[25:04] to the law of god
[25:06] now
[25:08] we know that god brought israel out
[25:11] and
[25:12] because they don't know him they know
[25:14] the prophecy the prophecy was about of a
[25:17] deliverer coming
[25:18] and because they are the texts and the
[25:21] words and from generation to generation
[25:24] all of them had this great hope of this
[25:27] deliverer of course it took 400 plus
[25:29] years and moses came on the scene
[25:31] and when they saw the power they know
[25:33] his god they saw flies fleas
[25:35] and then they were finally getting out
[25:37] of there now
[25:38] the object of bringing the people out
[25:40] wasn't just to bring them out it was to
[25:43] bring them out to bring them to the
[25:44] mountain that they could get
[25:47] god's laws
[25:48] they could get god's mind what god
[25:51] thinks and fears now this these are
[25:53] humans just like us have their own
[25:54] thoughts and ideas and feelings so when
[25:57] moses went up on the fine he was staying
[25:59] alone
[26:00] they said
[26:02] we don't need a man dead
[26:05] make us a god
[26:06] pull iran get earrings and gold and
[26:09] whatnot they end up with a gold that
[26:10] can't
[26:11] and moses come down with two
[26:13] commandments the ten commandments rather
[26:15] do two tablets of stone
[26:17] and see that we know it
[26:19] see it
[26:20] they were somewhere destroyed and so on
[26:22] the people
[26:24] even though they saw supernatural
[26:27] even though they know is god almighty
[26:30] that brought them out
[26:32] yet they were steeped in their carnal
[26:35] nature
[26:36] because the spirit wasn't released yet
[26:38] to even transform on transform them or
[26:40] change them the law was a school master
[26:43] because the law was trying to bring them
[26:46] in subjection to commands and order and
[26:48] regulation thou shalt not steal so shall
[26:52] not lie those times don't commit
[26:54] adultery we remember that sabati but
[26:56] holy you know it was orders it was
[26:58] commands don't do don't do do do and man
[27:02] was still doing
[27:03] so we find them that man feel of course
[27:06] man couldn't keep his side of the
[27:08] bargain and that's why grace produced
[27:10] jesus christ so therefore the carnal
[27:12] mind is enmity against god for it is not
[27:16] subject to the law of god neither in it
[27:19] can be
[27:21] so here the bomb
[27:22] verse 8 so then they that are in the
[27:25] flesh
[27:26] cannot please god how many understand
[27:29] that tonight that the object of the
[27:31] gospel is to get you out of your flesh
[27:34] and to get you in your spirit into the
[27:36] spirit that you could please go and to
[27:38] please god you have to have faith faith
[27:40] is what pleases god
[27:42] so therefore trying to clubber a young
[27:45] person or beat up somebody with the
[27:48] letter of the law under legalism that
[27:50] can't really deliver them they could
[27:52] straighten up and say left right and
[27:53] right turn and left and do a little
[27:55] thing for a while but
[27:57] really
[27:58] that law
[27:59] is not the outside what god wants is the
[28:02] inner law that operates in the heart
[28:05] and this is where this training come
[28:07] because the heart
[28:09] that we you know the bible there's a
[28:11] scripture the heart is deceitfully
[28:14] wicked and evil who can know but god the
[28:16] heart is deceitful
[28:18] wicked
[28:19] who could know it but god
[28:21] so so so that is why we have to come now
[28:24] and hear the word and receive the word
[28:27] and have a desire in our heart for that
[28:29] word to become flesh and for that word
[28:32] to come alive
[28:33] in and through us
[28:34] well let's go again so then they
[28:37] that are in the flesh cannot please god
[28:40] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[28:41] spirit if so be that the spirit of god
[28:44] dwell in you
[28:45] now that same thing in the amplified
[28:47] says verse 7
[28:49] that is because the mind of the flesh
[28:53] with its carnal torts
[28:56] and purposes is hostile to god
[28:59] for it does not submit itself to god's
[29:03] law
[29:04] indeed it cannot
[29:06] so i want you to see it now
[29:08] the fleshly
[29:09] khanna
[29:10] natural believer christian church member
[29:14] they just in the natural they see things
[29:16] on my natural standpoint they're in
[29:18] their flesh they're not in the spirit
[29:21] they're not even seeing the working of
[29:22] the enemy stripping them of faith of
[29:24] strength of power not even seeing their
[29:27] strength is leaving
[29:28] going they're dying
[29:31] he said but so then those who are living
[29:33] the life of the flesh
[29:35] catering to the appetites and impulses
[29:38] of their carnal nature cannot please or
[29:41] satisfy god or be acceptable to him
[29:45] but you are not living the life of the
[29:47] flesh you are living the life of the
[29:48] spirit if the holy spirit really dwells
[29:51] in you erects and control you now this
[29:54] is interesting tonight
[29:56] because this is not talking about rome
[29:58] about los angeles about america about
[30:01] the press and about every external thing
[30:04] this is dealing with us
[30:07] this is dealing with you and i
[30:09] this is delivered it cannot mind the
[30:11] inner man
[30:12] so this is where you come among the
[30:13] brass
[30:14] because you know you have people
[30:16] uh they like to talk about others
[30:19] you know if you meet them they talk
[30:21] about this one down on that one but they
[30:23] will not talk about themselves
[30:26] they wouldn't talk about what they're
[30:27] going through
[30:28] you see what is talk about any topic
[30:30] they talk about
[30:32] some people they don't even have the
[30:34] humility to say i don't know
[30:37] they won't don't have the humility to
[30:39] say to ask a question
[30:41] if they don't know they wouldn't even
[30:42] ask a question i remember
[30:44] isaac or gideon and some maths class
[30:46] musical some must listen and the teacher
[30:49] asks any questions
[30:50] and nobody asks any questions any
[30:52] teacher told them there's small shame
[30:54] and diction
[30:55] he says small shame is when you don't
[30:57] ask a question you're ashamed that's a
[30:59] question big shame is when you fail the
[31:00] exam
[31:01] because you don't understand your work
[31:03] so it's better you take small shame and
[31:05] take big you got the exam coming
[31:08] so the thing of it is
[31:10] having that humility means
[31:13] that you could say i don't know
[31:15] i really don't know i can't answer that
[31:17] i don't know
[31:18] and you want to know
[31:20] so you want to ask
[31:22] you want to find out because you want to
[31:24] be sure
[31:25] and we're going to get down into it so i
[31:27] trust tonight that uh if you're being
[31:29] blessed that is speaking to you okay
[31:32] now
[31:33] brother branham
[31:35] was saying this here
[31:37] abram didn't stagger
[31:39] and he's talking about i think he was
[31:40] like another prayer line he said the
[31:42] lady here might say how am i going to
[31:43] walk maybe you've been crippled a long
[31:45] time i don't know maybe someone will say
[31:48] well the doctor told me i couldn't live
[31:49] by the brain and i'm going to die that's
[31:51] not what we are talking about that's the
[31:53] natural thing
[31:54] if you look at any of that you will
[31:56] never live
[31:57] but you have got to look to a promise
[32:00] that god made and that promise see the
[32:02] inside of you
[32:04] this outside is sin did you know that
[32:06] you know your body is sin and that's the
[32:09] reason don't try to perfect that body it
[32:12] is sin did you know that it was born in
[32:15] sin
[32:16] shape and iniquity common word speaking
[32:18] lies
[32:19] and that soul is the same way until that
[32:22] soul died and then was born again
[32:24] then that soul and black died
[32:27] the soul that sinner shall die but he
[32:29] that believeth me has everlasting life
[32:32] then there's an immortal life living in
[32:34] that body now that's a stream coming
[32:37] from him like a core
[32:39] on the inside of a man
[32:41] that's
[32:42] the part that's godly that operates this
[32:45] body
[32:46] so here what i want to get to tonight
[32:49] but before this body
[32:52] can ever become perfected
[32:55] the spirit
[32:57] will bring it in submission to god
[33:01] to make you
[33:02] go give the lord a praise offering
[33:04] tonight give the lord a hand the priest
[33:06] tonight
[33:07] before this body
[33:10] can ever become perfected
[33:13] the spirit
[33:15] will bring it in subjection to god to
[33:18] make you
[33:20] it's a war all the time
[33:22] a constant paul said we will never get
[33:25] more than he he said when i would do
[33:27] good evil is near me that's a constant
[33:30] war the flesh
[33:32] against the spirit
[33:34] and here you go look into the flesh the
[33:35] doctor said
[33:37] and you can't serve god you've got to
[33:39] throw aside your senses and god never
[33:42] gave you those senses to trust him with
[33:44] but give you his spirit to trust him
[33:46] your sense is only to contact see
[33:49] taste feel smell and hear but to you
[33:51] yourself is that spirit that lives in
[33:54] you and when that's regenerated the old
[33:56] man died and a new man is born again
[33:58] that is the path of god then you become
[34:01] a son of god an offspring of the creator
[34:05] notice
[34:07] abraham he was
[34:08] happy about that of course about the
[34:11] next quote and then he went out from
[34:13] there and come there was a strike
[34:15] between lots of its men and so forth
[34:17] i want to show you just a little thing
[34:19] here on the comment of the lord just
[34:21] while we're here tonight
[34:23] i'll try not to be too late
[34:25] he said but what's here now
[34:26] just abraham was an ear to the world
[34:30] lot
[34:31] was a type of lukewarm believer
[34:33] he was a believer
[34:35] he had left his homeland it's a journey
[34:37] with god
[34:38] but always
[34:40] never
[34:42] fully
[34:43] surrendered
[34:44] and that's what the trouble in the full
[34:46] gospel church tonight along with the
[34:48] rest of them these people who left the
[34:51] world keep out of the world they don't
[34:53] want to go gambling and drinking and
[34:55] carrying on be a believer
[34:58] but i've never made
[35:00] a complete surrender
[35:03] i want you to think about that
[35:05] people come out of baptist methodist
[35:06] catholic pentecostal hindu muslim they
[35:09] come and believe the message
[35:11] but not
[35:12] surrendered
[35:13] they believe by the brown
[35:15] they believe the books the believers
[35:17] don't say the lord
[35:18] but not
[35:20] surrender are we getting anywhere
[35:22] tonight
[35:23] are you catching what we are saying
[35:25] tonight
[35:26] that this is not going to church this is
[35:29] not our doctrine is right and my
[35:31] doctrine is right or my church this is
[35:33] not that now
[35:34] this is honing in
[35:36] to the individuals
[35:38] are you
[35:39] surrendered
[35:41] and to surrender
[35:43] you have to surrender to an authority
[35:48] you can't just surrender
[35:49] you're surrendering to god
[35:51] you're surrendering to a higher power
[35:54] you surrender into a higher authority
[35:55] that would surrender or submitted or
[35:58] being submissive that is what that is
[36:00] all about
[36:02] let's continue
[36:04] and submitting means putting others
[36:08] before yourself and you read that in the
[36:10] scripture don't think about your own
[36:12] things
[36:13] think
[36:14] about the things of others
[36:17] submitting means not always doing what
[36:19] you want to do
[36:21] it means
[36:23] putting
[36:25] the will of god
[36:27] above
[36:28] your own will
[36:30] sometimes people don't want to ask god
[36:32] because they don't want god tell them no
[36:34] how do you think about that one
[36:36] they don't want to ask god about an
[36:38] issue a problem a deal
[36:41] something they want to do because they
[36:43] want to do it
[36:44] so they wouldn't ask god should i
[36:47] because deep down
[36:49] they they believed they would get new
[36:51] so instead of talking to god about it
[36:54] they go ahead and do it and then when it
[36:55] backfire is oh god
[36:58] but you should say oh god up front
[37:01] you should have asked him first
[37:03] you should have put him first and then
[37:05] it was going to be altogether different
[37:08] i remember
[37:10] when we built a little wooden church in
[37:12] kaiwal
[37:13] and we were looking to expand it
[37:15] about 12 people and you know people that
[37:17] would come and we were looking to expand
[37:18] we were digging the mud and it was a
[37:20] wooden building among some cocoa trees
[37:24] and after
[37:25] we were digging
[37:28] rain fell
[37:30] and all what we dig the mud came and
[37:32] covered back up
[37:34] and when i saw that
[37:37] i said you know what stop stop
[37:40] no further no further because this just
[37:42] not right we labor to dig the mud to
[37:45] expand and all the rainfall because on a
[37:47] flat there's a hill to the side and the
[37:49] mud came down and covered all the labor
[37:50] that we did i said no no this is not it
[37:53] i don't believe this is the will of god
[37:54] must have continued doing this
[37:57] and by the next service the lord spoke
[37:59] to me
[38:00] and told me that we've been sani
[38:02] granting
[38:03] that's where we are now
[38:05] and um one brother told me well
[38:07] after a while nobody believed that as it
[38:08] doesn't matter if nobody believed that i
[38:10] say if god spoke it then it will
[38:12] materialize
[38:14] but what i want to try to assure you is
[38:15] this
[38:16] what if
[38:17] i didn't have the sensitivity to
[38:20] understand that that is not god's
[38:22] program we had a desire to expand it we
[38:25] had a desire to do it but that was not
[38:27] god's plan god wanted us out of there
[38:31] and even if we had the desire and we
[38:34] were doing it he made an interruption
[38:37] because he allowed the interruption to
[38:39] say paul stop no fail
[38:41] and this is where we have to understand
[38:45] when we get a pause or check or go say
[38:47] no not that door no not that road no not
[38:51] that job not that way and that gave us a
[38:53] check
[38:54] and he gave us a check to protect us
[38:57] to help us
[38:58] to bless us what if i had took the
[39:01] approach the devil fight him i'll fight
[39:04] him back
[39:05] and i'm going back to dig some more mud
[39:06] you see what we're gonna talk about
[39:08] so in yielding in surrendering we get
[39:13] the flow of the spirit to know what the
[39:15] will of the lord is
[39:17] amen so i trust tonight that this would
[39:19] help some of you there tonight now
[39:22] submittant authorities
[39:24] is what i have here this is a very
[39:26] interesting scripture
[39:27] because
[39:28] you know
[39:29] we spoke past bible study about
[39:32] faithful and little faithful and much
[39:34] and people behaving attitude is
[39:36] consistent
[39:38] if somebody lazy at home they release
[39:40] the intuition lazy in school is he in a
[39:42] job lazy laziness the diligent diligence
[39:45] is across the board
[39:46] you notice um you could pretend so much
[39:49] and no more your true
[39:51] operation would soon come out and
[39:55] if people fighting authorities
[39:58] then they're going to fight authorities
[40:01] on the job
[40:02] bosses politician government you can
[40:05] fight in church they will fight all
[40:06] about because them is like a talk
[40:10] i mean anti-authority warrior i i will
[40:13] call
[40:14] fighting authority but listen to the
[40:15] scriptures listen to what peter and
[40:19] romans paul say in romans 13
[40:21] 1-5
[40:22] and i want you to find out romans 13
[40:25] let's read verse 1 to 5.
[40:27] it said let every soul
[40:29] be subject unto the higher powers now
[40:32] this here he's not talking to
[40:34] unbelievers
[40:35] he's talking here to christians all
[40:37] right for there is no power
[40:40] but of god
[40:41] the powers that they are ordained of god
[40:45] whosoever therefore resisted the power
[40:49] resisted the ordinance of god
[40:52] and they that resist shall receive
[40:56] to themselves damnation
[40:58] for rulers
[41:00] are not terror to good works
[41:02] but the evil
[41:04] will thou then not be afraid of the
[41:06] power
[41:07] do that which is good and though shall
[41:10] have the praise of the same
[41:12] for he is the minister of god to thee
[41:15] for good
[41:16] but if thou do that which is evil be
[41:19] afraid
[41:20] for he beareth not the sword in vain for
[41:23] he's the minister of god a revenger to
[41:27] execute right upon him
[41:29] that do it evil
[41:31] and this is a recap of it here wherefore
[41:37] you must needs be subject not only for
[41:40] right
[41:41] but also for conscience sake
[41:44] now that's a powerful scripture let's
[41:46] examine it in the amplified
[41:49] it says let every person
[41:52] be loyally subject to the governing
[41:55] civil authorities
[41:57] for there is no authority except from
[42:00] god
[42:01] by his permission
[42:03] his sanction
[42:04] and those that exist to do so
[42:07] by god's
[42:09] appointment
[42:10] now
[42:11] a government
[42:13] or president
[42:15] or prime minister could be oppressive
[42:18] but that does not mean what they are
[42:20] saying is sinful
[42:22] if the government
[42:24] wants us to sin
[42:25] that's a different thing altogether
[42:28] it's not the case of
[42:30] like all have to bow down
[42:32] to this idol
[42:34] and shadrach meshach and abednego
[42:36] deliver us we don't have that yet
[42:39] i want to see we don't have that yet
[42:41] there is nothing to suggest that
[42:43] scripture is applicable to lords
[42:46] governing
[42:47] us governing the world because god put
[42:50] judges note my words god put judges
[42:54] magistrate
[42:56] civil government
[42:59] to protect us
[43:02] to protect people that want to do good
[43:03] because of evil people
[43:05] understand this
[43:07] keen children still running the utm
[43:10] they still have daniel we don't talk
[43:12] about that much
[43:13] we don't talk about the seed of the
[43:15] serpent the seed of his supper is not an
[43:17] imaginary thing
[43:19] that sees that his serpent has become
[43:22] flesh
[43:23] they are people with no conscience
[43:25] there are people with no
[43:26] uh spiritual guide
[43:29] they are evil
[43:30] and and and you will be naive to think
[43:32] it's not so
[43:35] murderers
[43:37] and the whole whole robbers and it's
[43:39] just a nature it's just a behavior they
[43:41] don't care it's a spirit upon them it's
[43:44] a spirit and a seed in them
[43:46] so god put laws and laws is what governs
[43:49] the universe
[43:51] laws is what governs the country
[43:53] as ice but isaac said if there is no i
[43:56] believe white line in the road then
[43:57] there'll be accidents that's why we have
[44:00] red green and yellow lights
[44:03] to say stop green get ready
[44:06] and and to go
[44:07] all of this is systems to check stop
[44:11] because the next car is passing the
[44:12] other way stop go
[44:15] so in the
[44:16] in the working of things
[44:19] that rebellion against laws against
[44:21] authorities is not scripture
[44:25] and it's not authorized by god
[44:27] so let's continue here now
[44:31] so
[44:32] we still need amplified
[44:33] let's read again
[44:35] let every person
[44:37] be loyally subject to the governing
[44:40] civil authorities for there is no
[44:42] authority except from god by his
[44:44] permission
[44:45] his sanction
[44:46] and those that exist to do so by god's
[44:48] appointment therefore was too
[44:51] he who resists
[44:54] and sets himself up
[44:56] against the authorities
[44:58] resists
[44:59] what god has appointed
[45:02] and arranged
[45:03] in divine order
[45:05] and those who resist will bring down
[45:07] judgment upon themselves receiving the
[45:09] penalty due them
[45:12] with three
[45:14] for the civil authorities
[45:16] are not a terror
[45:18] to people of good conduct
[45:21] but to those of bad behavior
[45:23] would you have no dread of him who is an
[45:26] authority
[45:27] in other words
[45:28] what is being said here is you supposed
[45:31] to dread or fear or respect
[45:35] who is in authority
[45:37] then do what is right and you will
[45:39] receive his approval
[45:41] and commendation for he is god's servant
[45:43] for your good
[45:45] is what
[45:46] god servant for your good but if you do
[45:49] wrong you should dread him and be afraid
[45:52] for he does not bear and wear his sword
[45:55] for nothing he is god's servant to
[45:57] execute his right punishment vengeance
[46:00] on the wrong door therefore one must be
[46:03] subject not only to avoid god's wrath
[46:05] and escape punishment but also as a
[46:07] matter of principle and sake of
[46:10] conscience
[46:12] whoa
[46:14] my my my my
[46:17] isn't this an interesting lesson tonight
[46:20] isn't this
[46:21] an interesting lesson tonight this is
[46:24] i don't know what hidden mystery this is
[46:26] but this is the mystery that coming down
[46:29] to
[46:29] hit the
[46:31] it be very hot
[46:32] no man
[46:35] sinful man
[46:36] is lawless
[46:38] that is why we needed a savior to
[46:41] convert to transform the changes to
[46:44] conform with god's law and will
[46:48] this is not something we are born with
[46:51] we struggle with authority
[46:53] or government official
[46:55] bosses anybody in authority
[46:58] and i want to say this that rebellion
[47:02] against all that authority reflects also
[47:04] a rebellion against quarters authority i
[47:06] remember i work in the government
[47:07] service and every time they bring a new
[47:09] law
[47:10] there's one reaction just trying to do
[47:12] this trying to do this
[47:15] you know sign the book they want to sign
[47:17] the book because everything and they're
[47:19] trying to bring structure and order
[47:22] people doesn't readily say oh is that
[47:25] what you want okay you don't find that
[47:27] the first reaction
[47:30] to any change any government say you
[47:32] know what instead of going left we want
[47:34] to all cars go right or whatever it is
[47:36] people protest why because right you
[47:39] want to continue the way you are you
[47:42] don't want no bricks on your sister
[47:44] but life itself has breaks
[47:47] like you know sting people in the
[47:49] attitude and the arrogance they don't
[47:52] understand
[47:53] how one day they'll be vulnerable
[47:55] i remember
[47:57] when i came down with my kidneys and had
[47:58] issues there and i was in my drawing
[48:01] room and lying on the couch and i was
[48:03] sleeping i was in pain and i didn't know
[48:06] what that pain was about
[48:08] and i couldn't walk
[48:10] and i fell down to the floor and
[48:12] crawling
[48:13] crawl into her until i called gideon
[48:16] call him to come
[48:18] and he has to help me and get me to the
[48:20] car and get me to the hospital
[48:22] and at that point
[48:25] i was vulnerable
[48:27] i couldn't walk myself
[48:29] i couldn't do i just depend upon
[48:32] somebody else and and jesus told peter
[48:34] you're young no you don't go away want
[48:36] to go but one day
[48:37] you'll be led where you do want to go
[48:40] maybe for us tonight
[48:42] this is it
[48:44] this is maybe
[48:46] where
[48:47] we don't want to go
[48:48] or where we have to go
[48:50] because this come down now to the true
[48:53] nitty-gritty of christianity
[48:55] i have seen people come back and forth
[48:57] to the church and i don't say a word
[48:59] and i speak up the spirit and i know
[49:01] some people are floaters
[49:02] they don't want to subject to no
[49:04] authority
[49:06] no authority whatsoever
[49:08] so they are
[49:10] free to go here free to go they are free
[49:12] and they love that freedom
[49:14] no that freedom is the same free
[49:16] thinkers i call it the outside piece of
[49:18] cloth that is not bright stuff kind of
[49:21] bright material no no because jesus
[49:23] wasn't like that
[49:25] and our desire to be like jesus means
[49:29] that as
[49:30] my father sent me so sending you this
[49:34] was the equation
[49:36] not you go out and do your own thing no
[49:38] as
[49:39] my father the same way my father sent me
[49:41] that's how i want to send you
[49:43] so therefore and then he said i am
[49:44] divine your branches if you feel you're
[49:46] the boss and you feel your own then
[49:48] without me you can do nothing so don't
[49:50] believe that because you're a branch
[49:53] that you could go out on your own say
[49:54] you know what i'm a branch
[49:56] they're going will die so he said now if
[49:58] you are bad at me my words are biting
[50:00] you you can ask what you will
[50:02] so he's come down to surrender to abide
[50:05] in to heal them now this is not ministry
[50:08] thing now this is the believer thing
[50:10] this is all of us okay so this
[50:13] surrendering we're talking about is not
[50:15] a one-way street no this is for
[50:17] everybody
[50:18] hope you're with me tonight and
[50:20] following that through okay
[50:22] so therefore but i want you to notice
[50:24] uh i want to notice
[50:28] jesus behavior before pilate
[50:31] which is very instructive and if you
[50:33] want to look at it notice in john 19
[50:36] we want to read verse 16
[50:38] watch what jesus told pilate
[50:43] verse 6 of sin john 19
[50:46] verse 6
[50:47] when the chief priest therefore an
[50:48] officer saw him they cried out who's he
[50:51] fine
[50:52] crucify him pilate say it unto them take
[50:55] ye him and crucify him but i find no
[50:58] fault in him
[51:01] the jews answered
[51:03] him we have a law and by our law he
[51:06] ought to die because he made himself
[51:09] the son of god
[51:12] when pilate therefore heard that scene
[51:15] he was more free
[51:17] went again to the judgment hall
[51:20] and said to jesus so pilate having a
[51:21] second
[51:22] a second thought on his whole thing
[51:25] and he went against the judgment hall
[51:27] and said to jesus when sat down
[51:31] when i was where you come from
[51:33] jesus gave him no answer in parliament
[51:36] said unto him speakers down not unto me
[51:40] oh this is a ruler right no it's doubt
[51:43] not that i have power to crucify thee
[51:45] and have power to release me
[51:48] jesus answered though
[51:50] couldn't have no power at all against me
[51:54] except it would give him thee from above
[51:56] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[51:59] had the greatest sin oh give the lord
[52:01] some praise
[52:02] so jesus was saying clearly you mr man
[52:06] is only in that position because my
[52:08] father permit that or authorize that
[52:11] jesus understood that
[52:14] so you see what we're talking about now
[52:16] and that's what i'm saying that even for
[52:18] the law to be issued that people paid
[52:21] taxes and everybody to go back to their
[52:22] home country
[52:23] mary and joseph was not in position
[52:27] that call
[52:28] that government call
[52:30] and they submitted themselves
[52:33] and even though she was pregnant even
[52:35] though she was heavy with child they
[52:37] still obeyed the law to get into
[52:40] position where they're supposed to be
[52:43] but the thing about that is that would
[52:46] fulfill the scripture
[52:48] so so many times things are happening
[52:51] all around
[52:52] but behind it is scripture being
[52:55] fulfilled you're with me tonight oh
[52:57] blessed be the name of the lord
[52:59] now
[53:00] the challenge with many of us is the
[53:02] unwillingness
[53:04] to submit
[53:06] and i want to propose tonight or put on
[53:08] the table tonight
[53:10] as but isaac of time we say we're having
[53:12] a conversation
[53:14] i want to say we are called to suffer
[53:18] we are called to be in submission
[53:23] we are called to surrender
[53:26] and submission
[53:28] is from the heart
[53:30] not the head
[53:31] the heart
[53:33] and when we get rid
[53:36] of the spirit of rebellion
[53:38] we will have access
[53:40] to submission
[53:42] i hear people say i want this one push
[53:44] me around
[53:46] that is how they interpret authority
[53:51] that is how they interpret
[53:53] someone having
[53:55] power over them
[53:58] so the boss given instructions
[54:01] do this go do that do the maybe they
[54:04] might raise their voice but guess what
[54:05] nicey boss
[54:06] you raise your voice tuna
[54:09] yes i'm saying
[54:10] you know what you can raise back your
[54:12] voice at the boss that you're working at
[54:15] because that boss is in a position
[54:17] is that boss that employ you
[54:19] you are the worker
[54:21] that is the owner that is the boss other
[54:23] boys say he doesn't want it so like
[54:25] somebody
[54:26] talk about the the blueprint and they
[54:28] build the house and he might come and
[54:30] check the blueprint he said but there's
[54:31] nothing here he said break it down
[54:33] that's not what i paying for break it
[54:35] down
[54:36] i want watch on this paper here what the
[54:38] architect draw this is what has to be
[54:42] and when god come for this bride in last
[54:43] days god and look and say oh that is by
[54:46] okay okay no no he has a blueprint
[54:49] and the blueprint is what looking for it
[54:51] has to be in the statue of perfect man
[54:54] it has to be that it can't be well you
[54:56] know that might we we
[54:58] it has moved so we can do it so it
[55:00] doesn't have that thing guys the local
[55:02] panel thing you know coming with that we
[55:04] see it so it doesn't matter you see it
[55:07] is what is the expectation of god
[55:10] and god expectation is the word to
[55:12] become flesh and if the word become
[55:14] flesh that means that we will be
[55:17] submissive to the spirit we'll be led by
[55:19] the spirit and as measure led by the
[55:21] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[55:23] so it's not word understanding it's not
[55:25] even that it's not word knowledge now
[55:28] it's coming like it's come like this
[55:30] it's not even how much holy ghost you
[55:31] have is how much holy ghost have you or
[55:34] how much you are surrendered to
[55:37] so it makes a huge difference it's not
[55:39] how much information that you have is
[55:41] how much you yield to what you're
[55:43] hearing
[55:44] go give the lord some praises oh thank
[55:47] you lord jesus because as i think but
[55:49] isaac said it for everybody to have a
[55:51] complaint there's somebody that have
[55:53] worse than that and doing the very best
[55:56] in the given situation
[55:57] see amen so praise the lord let's
[55:59] continue
[56:01] okay so
[56:03] um
[56:04] okay we want to look at matthew 8
[56:07] 5-10
[56:09] and this is an interesting scripture and
[56:12] i hope that based upon what we said so
[56:15] far you may see this in a different
[56:17] light
[56:18] matthew 8
[56:20] reading from verse 5
[56:22] and when jesus was entered into
[56:24] capernaum
[56:26] that came unto him a centurion
[56:28] beseeching him now this centurion is not
[56:30] a baptized believer he's a gentile he's
[56:33] an unbeliever he's a centurion
[56:36] and with six and saying lord my servant
[56:39] lied at home sick of the palsy
[56:41] grievously tormented
[56:44] and jesus said unto him i will come and
[56:47] heal him
[56:49] so jesus so so all these centurions to
[56:51] do is to keep quiet because jesus said i
[56:53] will come here
[56:55] this centurion answered and said lord
[56:58] i am not worthy that thou should just
[57:00] come under my roof
[57:02] but speak the word
[57:05] only
[57:06] and my servant shall be healed
[57:09] now here is revelation here his
[57:12] revelation
[57:13] for i am a man
[57:16] under authority
[57:18] note
[57:19] he did not say
[57:20] our man in authority
[57:23] he said i am a man
[57:25] under authority
[57:27] having soldiers under me
[57:29] i say to this man go he go away and
[57:32] another come and he comment unto my
[57:34] servant do this and he do it
[57:37] when jesus heard it
[57:39] he marveled
[57:40] and said to them
[57:42] that followed very nice unto you i have
[57:45] not found so great of faith no
[57:47] not in israel no
[57:49] this man
[57:51] tapped into the principle of what it
[57:54] means to be under authority
[57:57] because
[57:58] what it means to be under authority is
[58:01] to have authority
[58:02] because you can't be you can't have
[58:05] authority if you're not under authority
[58:08] do you understand that tonight
[58:10] so in other words if you are not
[58:12] submissive authority you can't have
[58:15] authority
[58:17] so the wife
[58:19] that is not submissive to a husband or
[58:20] bring it in contextual
[58:22] and she believes she's more spiritual
[58:24] than him
[58:25] and she don't want to listen to him
[58:29] rarely and truly she is not spiritual
[58:32] she is religious
[58:34] let me see it good
[58:36] she is not spiritual she's religious
[58:38] there's a question i don't have it here
[58:40] tonight
[58:41] but somebody i guess was a sister asked
[58:43] from the question
[58:45] should i submit myself to my husband
[58:48] because he's an unbeliever
[58:51] okay or this is a question a sincere
[58:53] question on this question
[58:55] and brother bomb say sister yes it's a
[58:57] dear um you should submit and you know
[59:00] and he went into it to show
[59:02] what it must be because you see you
[59:05] could take that he is an unbeliever
[59:07] therefore i don't have to listen i don't
[59:11] have the subject because he is this kind
[59:13] like your boss is that this your boss is
[59:15] this or the government is this or the
[59:17] comment is that
[59:18] that is irrelevant
[59:20] what you have to be concerned with not
[59:22] what others do but what you are called
[59:25] to do let me give the lord a hand to
[59:26] pray
[59:28] so it's not how others act
[59:31] is your action
[59:33] that is what is being is important as i
[59:36] often tell people remember it's not the
[59:38] others being tested as you are
[59:40] is you being tested
[59:41] so don't make excuses well you know is
[59:44] this one and that one i know there are
[59:46] people who cannot accept responsibility
[59:48] for not me nothing i've dealt with it
[59:52] not me no i'm not i'm not taking blame
[59:54] for that
[59:55] who is to take the blame
[59:58] and that is why they don't learn
[1:00:00] because they're not accepting
[1:00:02] responsibility for their actions and
[1:00:05] their attitudes
[1:00:06] it is easy to make excuses
[1:00:10] let me say it again it is easier to make
[1:00:13] excuses than to accept responsibility
[1:00:16] for actions and attitudes
[1:00:18] think whereas let's talk about parents i
[1:00:20] was a big team we need to go in there
[1:00:23] and i kind of appreciate now the bible
[1:00:25] study and what we could share um outside
[1:00:28] of preaching itself because you know we
[1:00:30] could get
[1:00:31] some things are more caught than taught
[1:00:33] so i hope you catch some things in
[1:00:35] between
[1:00:36] because some parents don't want to
[1:00:38] accept responsibility
[1:00:39] for how things work with their children
[1:00:41] and they are responsible
[1:00:44] for many many things having certain
[1:00:46] influences even influences in the church
[1:00:49] towards the pastor
[1:00:50] towards the pastor's wife towards the
[1:00:52] ministry
[1:00:54] even that because according to what the
[1:00:57] parents tell the children the children
[1:00:59] and the study parents
[1:01:01] and bad spirit bad attitude you know not
[1:01:04] humbling themselves not you can't even
[1:01:06] tell them anything because they already
[1:01:07] get seated in their heart and mind and
[1:01:10] there's nothing you could do
[1:01:11] it binds you because that's not how it's
[1:01:13] supposed to be
[1:01:15] praise the name of the lord so
[1:01:16] submission
[1:01:18] being submitted
[1:01:19] surrendered
[1:01:21] is part of this christian walk now
[1:01:25] i stumble upon this scripture and just
[1:01:27] blew my mind
[1:01:28] and this is from titus you have to find
[1:01:30] this one
[1:01:31] titus tree
[1:01:33] and you want to read verse one tonight
[1:01:35] this
[1:01:36] this blew me out when i read this one
[1:01:38] titus 3 1-9
[1:01:42] put them in mind
[1:01:44] talking about believers to be subject to
[1:01:45] principalities
[1:01:47] and powers
[1:01:48] to obey magistrates
[1:01:50] to be ready
[1:01:53] for every good work
[1:01:55] to speak evil of no man
[1:01:57] to be no brawlers but gentle
[1:01:59] showing all meekness unto all men
[1:02:02] for we ourselves the comparison now
[1:02:04] we're sometimes foolish disobedient
[1:02:06] deceived
[1:02:07] saving divers lust and pleasures living
[1:02:09] in malice and envy hateful and hating
[1:02:12] one another but after that
[1:02:15] the kindness and the love of god our
[1:02:17] savior towards us appeared
[1:02:20] not by works of righteousness which we
[1:02:21] have done but according to his mercy he
[1:02:24] saved us by the washing
[1:02:26] of regeneration
[1:02:27] and renewing of the holy ghost
[1:02:30] which he shared on us abundantly through
[1:02:32] jesus christ our savior that being
[1:02:34] justified by his grace we should be made
[1:02:36] ears according to the hope of eternal
[1:02:39] life
[1:02:40] this is a faithful scene
[1:02:42] these things i will that though affirm
[1:02:46] constantly
[1:02:47] that they which have believed in god
[1:02:49] might be careful to maintain good works
[1:02:52] these things are good and profitable
[1:02:55] under men but avoid foolish questions
[1:02:57] and genealogies and contentions and
[1:02:59] strivings about the law for the
[1:03:01] unprofitable now
[1:03:03] listen to the amplified of that
[1:03:06] and this ties in with
[1:03:08] the message that i preached recently
[1:03:09] about putting them in members of these
[1:03:11] things
[1:03:13] chapter 3 verse 1 it says remind
[1:03:16] people
[1:03:17] to be submissive
[1:03:19] to their magistrates on authorities to
[1:03:22] be obedient to be prepared and willing
[1:03:25] to do any upright and honorable work
[1:03:28] this is what we're doing tonight
[1:03:30] reminding you
[1:03:32] that this is also the word
[1:03:34] so if let's say
[1:03:36] i tell you
[1:03:38] when you're coming
[1:03:40] to the church
[1:03:41] where the mask in the bus or the car or
[1:03:43] whatever when he commented you could
[1:03:44] take it to
[1:03:46] what am i encouraging doing that
[1:03:49] if i as your pastor
[1:03:51] tell you
[1:03:52] where
[1:03:53] that the seats are there but when you
[1:03:54] come into it yeah among the wedding pass
[1:03:56] you know what i saw in there a seed of
[1:03:59] rebellion against instruction and
[1:04:01] authority and everything else
[1:04:03] that is what it meant
[1:04:05] because they they oppressing us for this
[1:04:07] mask
[1:04:10] the tree
[1:04:15] now all that is mislocation and
[1:04:17] dislocation of the scripture
[1:04:19] that is not the seed that you're
[1:04:20] supposed to have
[1:04:22] that's not the seed you're supposed to
[1:04:24] receive
[1:04:25] because also understand it's a pandemic
[1:04:28] i know people call it plan that makes it
[1:04:30] somebody planet
[1:04:32] but the point is it is a pandemic
[1:04:35] it is something that affecting everybody
[1:04:38] around the world it doesn't matter who
[1:04:40] doesn't matter where doesn't watercolor
[1:04:42] doesn't matter here it doesn't matter
[1:04:44] race or creed
[1:04:46] it doesn't matter
[1:04:47] it's affecting our world and yet there's
[1:04:50] a bride on the earth a bride that will
[1:04:52] stand
[1:04:53] amen by the word of god
[1:04:55] so what remind people to be submissive
[1:04:57] to their ministry right to be prepared
[1:05:00] and willing to do any upright in our
[1:05:02] work
[1:05:03] just
[1:05:04] what to slander or abuse or speak evil
[1:05:06] of no one to avoid being contentious to
[1:05:09] be forbearing for bearing means yielding
[1:05:12] gentle
[1:05:13] conciliatory and to show unqualified
[1:05:17] courtesy
[1:05:18] towards everybody
[1:05:20] brother recently asked me a question
[1:05:22] you talk about somebody who fighting a
[1:05:24] message blast me missing what not fell
[1:05:25] ill and whatnot how should he deal with
[1:05:27] him and i told him with all respects
[1:05:30] with all help and assistance in other
[1:05:32] words you have to detach yourself from
[1:05:35] the fact this man is anti-message
[1:05:37] anti-disorder that have nothing to do
[1:05:39] with how you behave towards that man
[1:05:42] how many understand that tonight
[1:05:45] so you cannot say you know what
[1:05:49] you see people get in trouble with god
[1:05:51] without you
[1:05:52] because paul before he become poor was
[1:05:55] saul
[1:05:56] saul was persecuting a christian
[1:05:58] but saul's name was in the book
[1:06:02] so people go through different stages
[1:06:03] and whatnot and we even though people
[1:06:05] are bad behave and and indifferent and
[1:06:08] whatnot
[1:06:09] we are not the ones to write them off so
[1:06:11] to speak we can say you know what that
[1:06:13] behavior is really terrible
[1:06:15] but the bible says the enemy hungry what
[1:06:17] to do
[1:06:18] feed him if the enemy thirsty give him
[1:06:20] something to drink
[1:06:22] this is the christian behavior this is
[1:06:24] the attitude if you if they accidentally
[1:06:26] walk one mile go with them two if they
[1:06:28] actually for the court give them the
[1:06:30] cloak also this is similar in the mount
[1:06:32] you mean we gotta get back there yes you
[1:06:34] have to get back there because this is
[1:06:37] jesus christ being reproduced again in
[1:06:40] right form
[1:06:41] okay
[1:06:43] all right
[1:06:45] so watch verse 8
[1:06:47] paul said in the amplified this message
[1:06:49] is most trustworthy and concerning these
[1:06:52] things i want you to insist steadfastly
[1:06:55] so those who have believed trusted and
[1:06:58] relied on god they be careful to apply
[1:07:01] themselves to honorable occupations and
[1:07:04] to doing good or praising of the lord
[1:07:07] my lord my lord
[1:07:09] first peter chapter two
[1:07:11] you can find it
[1:07:13] so it's future chapter two
[1:07:17] so you get it we're getting somewhere
[1:07:18] tonight
[1:07:20] all right first peter chapter two
[1:07:22] uh who's reading verse 12.
[1:07:25] having your conversation honest among
[1:07:26] the gentiles that whereas they speak
[1:07:29] against you as evildoers
[1:07:31] they may by your good works which they
[1:07:33] shall behold glorify god
[1:07:36] in the day of visitation
[1:07:38] submit here we go that would again
[1:07:39] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[1:07:42] man for the lord's sake
[1:07:44] whether to be a king a supreme
[1:07:47] on to governors
[1:07:49] as unto them that are sent by him for
[1:07:51] punishment of evildoers and for the
[1:07:53] praise of them that will
[1:07:54] for so is the will of god that will well
[1:07:57] doing you may put to silence the
[1:07:59] ignorance of foolish men
[1:08:02] as free
[1:08:03] watch
[1:08:04] and not using your liberty as a cloak of
[1:08:08] maliciousness but a servant of god
[1:08:12] honor all men
[1:08:13] love the brotherhood fear god honor the
[1:08:16] king i think i did a bible study on all
[1:08:19] men love the brotherhood but let's look
[1:08:21] at the amplified of this conduct
[1:08:23] yourself properly
[1:08:24] honorably righteously among the gentiles
[1:08:28] why
[1:08:28] so that although they may slander you as
[1:08:31] he will do as yet
[1:08:33] they may by witnessing your good deeds
[1:08:36] come to glorify god in the day of
[1:08:38] inspection and god shall look upon you
[1:08:41] wanderers as pastors or shepherd looks
[1:08:43] over his flock
[1:08:44] verse 13 amplified be submissive to
[1:08:47] every human institution and authority
[1:08:49] for the sake of the lord whether it be
[1:08:51] of emperor or supreme or the governors
[1:08:54] are sent by him to bring vengeance or
[1:08:57] punishment and justice to those who do
[1:08:59] wrong and to encourage those to do good
[1:09:01] service for it is god's will here we go
[1:09:04] an intention that by doing right your
[1:09:06] good and honest lives should silence
[1:09:08] muzzle guard the ignorant charges and
[1:09:11] ill-informed criticism of foolish
[1:09:13] persons
[1:09:14] live as free people yet
[1:09:17] here we go without employing your
[1:09:19] freedom as a pretext for wickedness
[1:09:23] but live all at all times as servants of
[1:09:26] god show respect for all men treat them
[1:09:29] honorably love the brotherhood the
[1:09:31] christian fraternity of which christ is
[1:09:33] ahead reverence god
[1:09:35] honor the emperor
[1:09:38] and about to wrap up here this is the
[1:09:40] home stretch
[1:09:42] hebrews 13 17
[1:09:44] it says obey them
[1:09:46] this is the twitch now that have ruled
[1:09:48] over you
[1:09:49] and submit yourselves
[1:09:52] for they watch for your souls
[1:09:54] as they that must give an account
[1:09:57] that they may do it with joy
[1:09:59] and i put grief
[1:10:00] for that is unprofitable for you
[1:10:02] the amplifier of that scripture is just
[1:10:04] one scripture there hebrews
[1:10:06] 13.
[1:10:08] it says obey your spiritual leaders
[1:10:11] and submit to them
[1:10:13] continually recognizing the authority
[1:10:16] over you
[1:10:17] for they are constantly keeping watch
[1:10:19] over your souls
[1:10:21] and guarding your spiritual welfare
[1:10:23] as men who will have to render an
[1:10:25] account of their trust
[1:10:28] do your part too let them do this with
[1:10:31] gladness and not with sign and groaning
[1:10:32] but that would not be comfortable for
[1:10:34] you
[1:10:36] you know as i said that remember there's
[1:10:38] a
[1:10:39] a statement but obama made
[1:10:41] powerful statement
[1:10:42] you say you can only serve god
[1:10:45] as you do believe the servant whom god
[1:10:48] of sin
[1:10:49] to you
[1:10:50] interpret the word to you by divine
[1:10:52] inspiration
[1:10:54] you could only serve god
[1:10:56] as you do and believe the servants whom
[1:10:58] god have sent
[1:11:00] interpret to you the word
[1:11:03] by divine inspiration
[1:11:06] so if the word is interpreted by divine
[1:11:09] inspiration like some time ago when i
[1:11:11] was talking about the lepers you see if
[1:11:13] we stay here we will die we go back
[1:11:14] we'll die we go forward and i was
[1:11:16] talking to that in reference to the
[1:11:18] coronal virus it was
[1:11:20] i was inspired
[1:11:22] i was given that to share
[1:11:24] to you all
[1:11:26] um
[1:11:27] in other words the core of that is you
[1:11:29] can't sit and do nothing
[1:11:32] if you do nothing you just waiting for
[1:11:34] the virus
[1:11:36] and that will make you like a foolish
[1:11:37] person in that sense if you do nothing
[1:11:39] at all
[1:11:41] so it was something
[1:11:43] that i would say
[1:11:44] inspire
[1:11:46] and this is where you have to be careful
[1:11:49] is not man trying something and pelting
[1:11:51] a scripture or pelting things because
[1:11:53] you don't know how things come
[1:11:55] like i shared with isaac where is that
[1:11:56] consider you know i'm coming something
[1:11:58] come to me and surrender about uh
[1:12:00] submitting and submission and so on like
[1:12:02] that it's not like if i'm trying to work
[1:12:05] up something it's it's inspiration and
[1:12:08] things that come and we get it and we
[1:12:10] share it and we trust that this will
[1:12:12] edify am i surrendered to god
[1:12:14] this is important now
[1:12:16] we're not talking about church now
[1:12:18] people come to church and that's all
[1:12:20] they do come to church they have nothing
[1:12:22] to do with the word having an effect
[1:12:23] upon their lives and reigning over them
[1:12:26] we want husbands subject to the word we
[1:12:29] want wives subjected to the word we want
[1:12:31] children subject this is the only way we
[1:12:33] can truly get into ephesians people have
[1:12:35] to recognize the authority of the word
[1:12:38] over their lives or you could choose to
[1:12:39] run your own life
[1:12:41] they don't want anybody tell you
[1:12:42] anything about rampage doors and doors
[1:12:44] you have certain doors you don't want
[1:12:45] christ come in the clue there's a
[1:12:47] private door as a private door you want
[1:12:49] all he does open up to come in
[1:12:51] if you really want to surrender you
[1:12:53] claim that you want him to be your lord
[1:12:56] lord mean ruler master you claim that
[1:12:59] he is supposed to be your lord you're
[1:13:01] not talking about the pastor you're not
[1:13:03] a modern minister no more christ
[1:13:05] the lord of your life
[1:13:07] and the only way he could be lord of
[1:13:09] your life is to the extent that you are
[1:13:11] willing to surrender
[1:13:13] and we would you would see it even
[1:13:14] deeper as we bring in the wrap up here
[1:13:16] now the clues
[1:13:19] all right now
[1:13:21] brother brown
[1:13:22] you are saying this here
[1:13:27] always
[1:13:29] the acts of the holy spirit and the
[1:13:30] apostles for it was the holy spirit in
[1:13:33] the apostles setting forth an example
[1:13:35] through all the ages
[1:13:38] what the holy spirit was then it is now
[1:13:41] and what the holy spirit did to that
[1:13:43] church it does this the district and
[1:13:46] this church here we go
[1:13:49] will just
[1:13:51] will be just as submissive to it as that
[1:13:54] church was
[1:13:55] it will bring just the same results he
[1:13:58] said if this church
[1:13:59] was just as submitted to it as that's
[1:14:01] what it was it would bring the same
[1:14:03] results you believe that it will
[1:14:06] just
[1:14:07] your submission to christ
[1:14:10] here we go now
[1:14:12] he said no one he said abram of course
[1:14:15] was the seed of heath was the seed he
[1:14:17] said oh but abraham if you catch it he
[1:14:19] had faith in god
[1:14:21] which united the spirit of god with the
[1:14:24] flesh of man this is big this is this is
[1:14:26] huge
[1:14:27] abraham if you catch it
[1:14:29] he had faith in god
[1:14:31] which united the spirit of god with the
[1:14:35] flesh of man
[1:14:36] dear is where faith come
[1:14:39] there is why he could be the abraham
[1:14:42] seed not all flesh
[1:14:44] but the uniting of the spirit and flesh
[1:14:48] together god making himself tearing out
[1:14:51] rooting out all evil bringing the
[1:14:54] submission of flesh the dust that he
[1:14:57] created
[1:14:58] and live with you as a partner
[1:15:01] so that is the
[1:15:03] that is the gist of it god coming and
[1:15:06] rooting out evil from in us
[1:15:09] and making that abode and abiding with
[1:15:12] the spirit and fresh connect together
[1:15:13] and making you a partner with
[1:15:16] but abram was so much like christ
[1:15:19] till they thought he was christ
[1:15:23] think about it now
[1:15:24] keep born in sin shape iniquity and no
[1:15:27] education illiterate and so on like that
[1:15:30] and yet
[1:15:31] he could manifest christ
[1:15:34] and uh and this was a powerful thing he
[1:15:35] said you must get here he said watch
[1:15:40] for the brandon
[1:15:42] you say you know me
[1:15:43] i only have a grammar school education
[1:15:46] i know nothing of psychology
[1:15:48] i know nothing about medics about
[1:15:50] cartoon anatomy he said but only thing i
[1:15:53] know i love the lord jesus christ
[1:15:54] through my heart
[1:15:56] that's all i know i'm uneducated
[1:15:58] illiterate i have not believed in my own
[1:16:01] but i know one thing i'm thankful for
[1:16:03] i know
[1:16:05] how
[1:16:06] to submit myself
[1:16:09] that jesus christ can work through me
[1:16:11] we'll give the lord a honor praise
[1:16:13] or give the lord a hand of praise on
[1:16:14] that one
[1:16:16] oh blessed be the name of the lord my my
[1:16:19] mind he said i know
[1:16:21] how
[1:16:22] to submit you know what he say are
[1:16:24] gifted so real gifted
[1:16:26] a gift is not man taken and just doing
[1:16:28] things a gift is how to get out of the
[1:16:30] way
[1:16:31] i want a gift
[1:16:34] so when we could get out of the way
[1:16:37] you see the operation of the gift truly
[1:16:40] okay so it gets there as we hit the home
[1:16:42] stretch here we about finish
[1:16:45] he says i know to submit myself that
[1:16:47] jesus christ can work for me
[1:16:49] i rather have that
[1:16:51] than all your education days in the
[1:16:53] world
[1:16:54] i rather know
[1:16:56] how to submit myself to the spirit of
[1:16:59] god and say lord
[1:17:01] here i am
[1:17:02] i rather have that secret in my heart
[1:17:06] that have this than have the secret of
[1:17:09] every hydrogen and atomic bomb in the
[1:17:11] world that could be made
[1:17:13] for it's more powerful than all the
[1:17:16] atomic bombs that could be taught us so
[1:17:19] under his everlasting wings
[1:17:21] i take my refuge tonight
[1:17:23] here we go
[1:17:26] god
[1:17:29] and god could ever get a man a woman
[1:17:31] today in this type of
[1:17:33] anywhere else
[1:17:34] that will pay no attention to what's
[1:17:36] going on around them
[1:17:38] but submit themselves to the lord as an
[1:17:41] individual
[1:17:42] unto god
[1:17:43] god will lead
[1:17:45] the same man today
[1:17:47] that he led them
[1:17:48] he proves that he's with us
[1:17:51] what we need today
[1:17:52] is a humble
[1:17:54] submitted life
[1:17:56] submit yourself
[1:17:58] don't squeeze yourself back
[1:18:00] don't do nothing
[1:18:02] but lead straight with the holy spirit
[1:18:05] what the holy spirit says do do quickly
[1:18:07] don't say well i'll wait and find out
[1:18:09] this and that no
[1:18:10] what the holy spirit would just go and
[1:18:12] do it
[1:18:14] you're almost there
[1:18:16] sometimes we do things that we do not
[1:18:18] understand
[1:18:19] our own doings
[1:18:21] if we are led by the spirit of god every
[1:18:24] child of god in my hearing or hearing my
[1:18:26] voice wrong
[1:18:27] knows
[1:18:28] that sometimes that you do things that
[1:18:30] you think yourself is ridiculous
[1:18:33] when you are so closing with god
[1:18:35] when the holy spirit gets you in such a
[1:18:37] condition until you are fully
[1:18:39] surrendered to him
[1:18:40] i have seen men
[1:18:42] so filled with the devil
[1:18:44] until it would take several men to hold
[1:18:46] him
[1:18:48] then
[1:18:49] he's comparing if satan can put that
[1:18:51] kind of a power on a man fully
[1:18:54] surrendered to him
[1:18:55] how much more power can the holy spirit
[1:18:58] put on a man that is surrendered to him
[1:19:01] to make a person a wheelchair rise and
[1:19:03] walk to make the shadow of a man die
[1:19:05] with cancer or cut jumped his feet
[1:19:07] screaming under the pulse pod how much
[1:19:09] stronger is god under there
[1:19:12] and here we go
[1:19:13] oh reach a final quote
[1:19:15] cut every obstacle from human beings
[1:19:18] that they might be connected with the
[1:19:20] garden of eden
[1:19:22] i was going to choke it
[1:19:24] but i'm going to see it
[1:19:26] man is omnipotent
[1:19:28] you don't believe that but he is
[1:19:30] a man
[1:19:32] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:19:35] did not he said in mark 11 22 who said
[1:19:37] verse things you see don't doubt in your
[1:19:38] heart you come the past you can have
[1:19:40] what you said
[1:19:41] friends
[1:19:43] this is it for tonight that's the final
[1:19:45] thing that i have
[1:19:46] written down
[1:19:48] and uh i'm hoping to get a heart
[1:19:51] this is a little more
[1:19:53] than hearing the word
[1:19:56] being submissive is taking action
[1:19:59] and there's a scripture i just didn't
[1:20:00] have the time
[1:20:02] i would have loved to find it i
[1:20:05] if anybody knows knows it they could
[1:20:07] they could get it from me but it's a
[1:20:08] scripture
[1:20:09] dealing with a man that lost a war
[1:20:12] and
[1:20:14] he surrendered
[1:20:15] and he said all that i am all that i
[1:20:18] have
[1:20:20] and something like that i give
[1:20:21] to thee
[1:20:23] to the man that conquered it
[1:20:25] and it's a scripture that identifies
[1:20:28] real surrender he wasn't holding back
[1:20:30] anything you know when you surrender a
[1:20:33] proper white flag
[1:20:34] i hope
[1:20:35] some of you with your red truck pull on
[1:20:37] your red flag and burn it and up goes
[1:20:39] the white flag tonight
[1:20:41] is a sign of surrender it's a sign of
[1:20:44] lord i i i repented my rebellion i
[1:20:48] repent of my own thoughts and ideas and
[1:20:50] attitudes
[1:20:52] i really want
[1:20:53] a submitted life to you
[1:20:56] because all what you have known
[1:20:58] naturally
[1:20:59] all what you feel that you have to boast
[1:21:01] about it will come to naught
[1:21:04] as you get older
[1:21:05] as time takes its toll
[1:21:08] the plane field levels
[1:21:11] you could have several houses several
[1:21:13] cars several planes you could have
[1:21:16] whatever money
[1:21:17] after a while
[1:21:19] the cars can't help you you don't know
[1:21:21] if you could be able to drive
[1:21:23] the swimming pool you might be able to
[1:21:25] step into that pool
[1:21:26] the money can't help you

[1:24:40] way right at your home
[1:24:42] i want to heal myself i've heard i would
[1:24:44] tonight
[1:24:45] i see surrendering and being submissive
[1:24:47] from a different perspective
[1:24:49] it's not abusive it's not oppressive
[1:24:51] it's not something trying to keep it
[1:24:53] back from remy one thing no
[1:24:56] jesus rebuked jesus was beaten jesus was
[1:24:59] spoken to and didn't even matter
[1:25:01] until the man said the wrong thing
[1:25:03] saying about the power he had
[1:25:05] jesus had to remind him the power you
[1:25:07] have is what my father gave you
[1:25:09] that's why you are in the position
[1:25:10] you're in and the power only power we
[1:25:13] could have is what god has given us
[1:25:16] and i want to tell you something tonight
[1:25:19] god
[1:25:20] has released the power
[1:25:22] that we can surrender
[1:25:24] oh thank you lord thank you jesus the
[1:25:26] power is here
[1:25:28] that you could surrender
[1:25:30] heavenly father i thank you tonight
[1:25:32] this has been coming to me and
[1:25:35] i share with your people father i
[1:25:37] i don't know how it comes out lord but
[1:25:39] you fitted together in their own hearts
[1:25:41] and minds in a way that they will
[1:25:44] give up
[1:25:45] you would raise that red flag of
[1:25:47] surrender
[1:25:48] wise who have been rebellious and
[1:25:49] carrying on with what kind of nonsense
[1:25:51] and attitude and hard face and bad
[1:25:54] spirit and bad ways they will adjust
[1:25:56] their position the people in the church
[1:25:58] as wife of christ they would adjust
[1:26:00] their behavior and attitude lord and
[1:26:02] humble themselves as christ did you
[1:26:04] didn't have to do it
[1:26:05] you could have built a whole new world
[1:26:08] whole new generation whole new people
[1:26:10] whole new gardener eden you're gonna
[1:26:12] make a different kind of reboot but you
[1:26:14] choose
[1:26:15] to come and redeem sinful man you choose
[1:26:18] to go to calvary and pay the price you
[1:26:20] choose to shed your blood
[1:26:22] and release your spirit that we could be
[1:26:24] here in this room tonight
[1:26:26] god
[1:26:27] even though we know education of the
[1:26:28] devil and technology all these things is
[1:26:30] of the enemy yet
[1:26:32] in this same scenario this is what we
[1:26:34] are using tonight technology
[1:26:36] that has been built for this time and
[1:26:38] season father
[1:26:40] when the church was lost the bible and
[1:26:42] it couldn't be read it was tied in the
[1:26:44] catholic church he anointed a man martin
[1:26:45] luther and he was able to preach the
[1:26:47] word then he anointed wesley and right
[1:26:49] in the middle there they brought the
[1:26:51] germans to develop the print and press
[1:26:53] and the word was back in print back
[1:26:55] being shared spread all around the world
[1:26:57] and then when you wanted a prophet to
[1:26:59] come to identify the days of the voice
[1:27:01] you had man to create them
[1:27:03] make and invent the
[1:27:05] tape recorder and that caught the voice
[1:27:08] of malachi 4 william marion branham the
[1:27:10] prophet have it on tapes
[1:27:12] and then we broke into the deeper into
[1:27:14] the internet where we could see now i've
[1:27:16] heard by the hearing of the ear but now
[1:27:18] i see
[1:27:19] and now we are full internet now there's
[1:27:22] no nothing further than this now
[1:27:24] instantly connected
[1:27:26] no separation not dial up
[1:27:29] if we could see one another we could
[1:27:31] hear a voice from any part of this world
[1:27:34] god what a blessed people we are
[1:27:36] we have no excuse to whom much has given
[1:27:40] much is expected father i want you

[1:27:45] they made the effort they come to hear
[1:27:48] we're not here to abuse them

[1:27:53] shame them that they wouldn't say a word
[1:27:55] they have nothing to say they will shut
[1:27:56] up
[1:27:57] because they empower them in charge
[1:27:59] that's not how the church was to be
[1:28:02] operated
[1:28:03] no it was to be operated by love the
[1:28:05] love of god come in the man of god
[1:28:07] yielded to the spirit of god and he
[1:28:09] could share with sincerity with on his
[1:28:12] heart
[1:28:13] the truth to speak to the people
[1:28:15] you told the word by the word to remind
[1:28:18] the people of these things father we
[1:28:20] reminded them
[1:28:21] that this subjection
