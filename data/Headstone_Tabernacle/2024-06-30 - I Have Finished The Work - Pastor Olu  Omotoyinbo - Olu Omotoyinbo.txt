Redemption may you come in a special way Among Us this morning have your way I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you will be seated God bless you and welcome praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah glory to God feel his Spirit here this morning it's so good to be in God's presence it's a blessing and a privilege this better than having the Prime Minister here or president here or any big human dignitary here just to know the Lord Of Glory is in our midst amen the spirit is here this is a encouragement testimony here de brother ID I found myself continue to think about the last several weeks the forever lifechanging testimony that the Lord has left behind us in brother Chandler but Isaac's preaching uh two services in Miami which s to me like Revelation 4:5 out of the throne proceed Lightnings and Tong and voices and the services of Correction and instruction recently received from the Lord I feel very humbled and grateful to be a partaker of all these great old points of Love grace and mercy from the Lord that we have received when our daughter L started medical school she said so much was being poured into them as students it was like drinking from a firose I have felt much the same way in the last several weeks the Lord has poured us gushes upon us I'm so grateful God bless you brother kis giving God praise amen and you may not know this many times I go back home and in awe and wonder as to what happens to this uh many times I get stuff and I don't know how we're going to just connect together and right behind the pulpit here I see all the connections like like as plain as ever and I am astonished I'm astonished as if I'm not the preacher I'm astonished if I'm sitting on hearing when I listen back I hear it and I know it's the Lord and this is a testimony you know sister she got a like a mini stroke and she sent this to me morning blessings brother ID I saw the neurolog the neurologist on Monday he didn't mention how fortunate I am to experience no complication of the stroke as he explained the magnitude of such Strokes I know it is nothing but God while you were praying for me a calm came over me and I too be to praise God starting telling everyone that this experience is so that God would be glorified and as I was reading the book of John on on two occasions the blind man healed and Lazarus raised from the dead Jesus said these things happen that God would be glorified and God used you to speak directly into it glory after prayer the pressure immediately started going down from 170 over 120 to 147 over 95 God was indeed glorified as some doctors said this could never be a stroke but an allergy during this period I've never I was never afraid or even I even enjoyed my stay at hospital testifying that I am well by God's grace and that God will be glorified and God did keep his word Monday's examination of the city scan report showed I had a previous stroke when the doc believes that it could have been a result of my covid episode but my sleep app and my sleep apneia which can put a lot of stress on the body God is good all the time my sensory system is intact my Moto system is a bit weak a slight weakness as noted in my right Upper Limb even it is not affecting me in any way I do experience anxious moments now and I guess thinking about strokes but I'm trying to relax and continue reading God's word intermittent mild headaches like things are noted today I'm having some therapy at the seaside nature God thank you very much for continuing Allowing God to use you to be a blessing to my family and I blessing to you the family also sister Don giving God praise so this morning we have a special tape we like to share with you it's a tape I preached the Wednesday night after the funeral and brother U had preached the Sunday after that and at the end of it the family played a clip of what was at the gravide and so like but the family there about a six minute clip you'll see that also but brother the old preacher message I have finished the work and I just want to read something just before we put that on but B was speaking here he's talking about now Christ loves everybody and he wants wants everybody to love him you know sometime people don't see God as a person they see God as a being but God is a person that loves that talk I'm a jealous God he cares he he's merciful he's a person and he wants us to praise him he want us to repent he want us to get our hearts right because he want to bless us he cannot bless us outside of his laws okay so Christ loves everybody he wants everybody to love him and this is his kindness to you that you might love him and believe him and have faith in his finished work for you now if you had an artisian well blowing out water on the hill and you had crop burning up now you could stand on the hill with the Crouch is and holler Great Well Spring your water over to me and water my crop so I can have food you could holler until you could holler no more it won't act if you'll work according to the laws of gravitation you can bring the water right down to your crop that there's enough electricity in any room to light it up but you can't holler great electricity I'm conscious of you are here light up this room no you've got to work according to the laws of electricity and then it's light up the room and it's the same way it is we are conscious that God is here God doesn't heal the people just by going to church or making confession he heals you up on your faith in his finished work that's the only basis that he can heal you and if you believe that it's not a bunch of ministers hands the touch of a Minister's hands it's not the anointing of the oil it's not the prayer that he pray so much it is your fate to accept the finished work that Christ did for you so when you look at it if you could fix yourself and you could fix your mix you don't need Jesus let me say it again if you could fix yourself you don't need the Lord we come because we need him to fix us we have a problem not him we need him as a savior we need him as a deliverer we need him so our confession is not in our strength and our human will and our ability no our confession is in God who could keep and preserve us do you believe that I could go down deep inside there Romans 7 talk about Paul say what I would not what I don't want to do that's what I find myself doing and what not and I find inside of me law in other words the law the mind having a thought of what is right doesn't make you do right thinking about the right things doesn't make you do the right things that's your thoughts God have to come and make an operation in your heart and that causes you to do the right thing your father tell you your mother tell you the preacher tell you and what not you still be still misbehaving because there the human mind you're talking about a the heart is is is sinful and who could know but God God but when God turns the operation in your heart and life then you will love what he loves and hate what he hates then you become a a lover of God hallelujah you love the ways of God you love the things of God you love the word of God in God you get strength in God you get your Energizer Hallelujah glory to God so when you're leaning on things and God move that prop from under you then you fall you was leaning on that that what happened to Isaiah and King Uzziah and God had to remove that prop from him because he doesn't want anybody propping you up you must rest upon God suppose God take away your wife suppose God take away your husband suppose God take away your mother your father your brother your sister whoever your little child what do you do you see there still storm coming right hurricane coming I see the baradas Prime Minister speak to their people and tell them get prepared get ready there are long lines of people line up in groceries to get water and food and so on because they know it's something coming you'll be a fool not to be peer if you know something is coming by Faith by faith what what your faith Make It Be by faith you have no extra water you have no extra food you have no extra going by faith you looking to get lick up by fi that's not what God expect of us to be foolish people it means that if storm is coming no nobody create that storm you know the storm coming you can't stop it it coming oh you're a Christian I'm not coming by you no it coming it coming to the whole island you understand what I'm saying your responsibility is to prepare yourself for the uncoming storm a storm is coming to families marriages home churches businesses your life Storms [Music] Come Hal Hallelujah and it's who have the guts and the belly to prepare for what's coming that's what you come to church for to get a whift of what is coming and get an inspiration how can we prepare because the Bible said his wife had made herself ready in other words how his wife got into the preparation mode and got prepared and God was made ready oh give the Lord some Praises final quote I we put on that tape there's one door to peace my peace I give to you he's only one door of genuine peace he says now uh you might accumulate enough money to get your children clothes have food to eat you might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular among the people but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace that is if you know how you are dying that night there's only one piece and Jesus is the peace he's our peace he's our healing and I am the Lord thy God that heals all of your diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other door or no other way but through Jesus Christ he's the door to heaven and now if Jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God here we go faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God faith is the key that unlocks every promise he make the key of Faith does that faith in his finished work it's these keys that we are speaking on oh praise God this work is already finished when Jesus died at Calvary he paid the price for your Redemption he paid a price for you to get delivered as a sinner and to be justified it doesn't mean you remain a sinner he take the opportunity to scoop you up and bless you and sanctify you and clean you up you must want that you must desire that oh to go through God's process let's all stand and give God some Praises as we want to go straight into that tape tonight praise God brother Nicholas Hallelujah glory to God Amen we have a special brother hu from LCA Legos is going to speak to us today as we welcome him may you open your hearts to receive the word of God am amazing in Grace how sweet the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] prise God praise God praise God praise God praise God oh praise God praise God oh yeah praise God all praise prise God oh praise God all praise God oh praise God praise God praise God and the people of God say amen amen God richly bless you uh let me go straight to the reading of the scriptures before you sit down I'd like to your attention to three portion of scripture St John chapter 17 Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and I'll go back to St John Chapter 2 amen everybody happy this morning amen it's good to be in church amen s John CH 17 ver 1- 6 read on these wik these words spake Jesus and lift lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they might know the the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou Gest me to do and oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou Gest me out of the world thine they were and thou givest them me and they have kept Thy word amen Ecclesiastes 12 ver 13 and 14 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man in other words any man at all rich poor po white black young or old the Bible says his primary Duty his primary work and purpose for existence on this Earth to serve God to serve and serve God verse 14 for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it' be evil amen amen and my final scripture in John 2 and verse 13 through verse 17 and the Jews passed over was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the Changers of morning sitting and when he had made a scor of small cords he drive he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and put out the Changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them the so does take these things hands make not my father's house and House of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of th house ha eaten me up amen may the Lord his the reading of his holy voice shall we prayer our heavenly father we thank you for Grace to be here today thank you for the blessing and the privilege that we can call ourselves your children and we all gathered together this morning at the Throne of our beloved heavenly father and we just pray Lord that you break the bread of life to each one of us today we all such a needed people Lord and I pray your grace upon this assembly Lord under the circumstances that we are in right now we know your grace is greater we thank you I pray you take the few words will speak this this day father the hearts of your people I pray that the person of Christ his Spirit his theophany what of the seven Church ages will Minister the word yourself this morning and at the end of the service may we be able to say like those did not our heart SP within us as speak to us long last please speak to us long last today Lord and we shall be care careful at the end of it all not just today but every day of Our Lives as long as you Le us breath we will be careful to give you alone all the praise all the honor and all the glory for we ask you with Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ name amen God bless you Church you may be seated amen amen well God richly bless you um my name is brother Olu and I from Lagos Nigeria and it's a blessing to be here though I can say with very mixed feelings for purposes I mean for reasons that we all are aware of but I want to say to start off um to thank the church again because it's so easy to see and appreciate the quality of the Holy Spirit in this church it's greatest to see the spirit among the Believers Spirit of togetherness the spirit of unity and a sweet Spirit of Love brother bam said the beauty of the church is not so much in the building the beauty of the church is the character of the people and you all are a truly beautiful group of Christian belever and I don't say that for effect because many of you don't know me but I I I've been in this church a long time this is my church in the city of London from way back in the 80s and you're a true lovely group with a very sweet spirit and I ask and admonish and plead and pray that you please remain that way that way so I remember my wife and I coming through in 1985 on our way back home from Brother moso's first meetings in Tulsa and um um brother Peter had me uh speak I mean while I was here but I remember the service where he spoke and give a testimony about the convention and he said something he was talking about how the service the services really changed him and he made this statement he said my wife told me you are changed and then he said when your wife tells you you are changed you really are changing meetings really change now why that struck me because minister is not used to saying that and I came through the Anglican Church the Baptist Church and the Pentecostal church and didn't get used to ministers saying that um because ministers are not supposed to admit such things like they changed um but here was this man this pastor doing just and even at that young age I realized that this was a very sincere transparent Minister not for the Optics not for the effects but genuine sinere St from the heart and for those of you who knew brother Peter you can know whether I'm just saying nice words I'm saying the truth amen amen so um um it was this type of sincere display why that struck me it was this type of sincere display that I saw in brother Bram and that's what brought me in the message I didn't come in the message because I understood God Head what a baptism as a matter of fact my background I argued about those things I like the man's Spirit reading the salmon books but I didn't agree what he was saying no eternal hell it cannot be but I like the man's spirit I I love the transparency because they the Pentecostal the big guys I mean I wouldn't mention names but the big Pentecostal guys who are brother contemporaries I thought they never did anything wrong and here was I a young Christian I wasn't living in sin I got saved once by the grace of God but I recognized my Humanity I n perfect and I had challenges I had to overcome but when I look at those ministers it's like they have no challenges at all and I felt so helpless I felt so disempowered but when I but when I read brother bham and he said this thing he talked about um the the attorney and when he had the tax case and he told this lie and I'm in shock this man that I'm reading about with these Miracles and these things admitting that he told a lie he did something for me it encouraged me that if I make a mistake all hope was not lost and then I heard him another time say he came back from a tree and then he was talking to his wife and she wanted him to spank Joseph and he said no I can't I don't have the heart to do it and she slammed the door on him and said if you had to stay with this children all the time and then he said later when he was praying the angel told him to tell her that he did not like she should not have done that this was my background and I'm in days I don't understand what this man is saying I don't believe what he's saying but I will go with this man that's how I came in the message and the understanding came later so when I came in to the church heon's Hall and I'm hearing brother Peter talk about the conention changed me I feel this is genuine same type of spirit that brought me in the message and so that Spirit of plainness and and sincerity and honesty the Integrity as characterized by the Peter group and that's why I say that please don't change us amen so it's good to be here today amen um let me just um do a song quickly before I'm sorry the musicians if you don't mind there's a sweet switch spirit in this place and I know is the presence of the Lord amen [Music] close close your eyes raise your hands you can sit there on you guys whatever there's a sweet sweet Spirit a sweet sweet spirit in this place is and I know that is the spirit of the Lord oh there's a sweet [Music] EX on each face [Music] and I know that is the presence of the Lord Sweet Holy Spirit oh sweet Holy Spirit sweet Heavenly do sweet Heavenly done stay right here with us stay right here with us feeding us feeding us with your love and for this blessings for these blessings we lift our hands in Praise we lift our hands in Praise without a doubt we know without a doubt we that we have been revived have been R when we shall live this place without a doubt we know without a doubt we know that we we have been revived then we shall live this amen amen God bless you is I have finished the work and my subject The Purpose Driven Life and I want to say I don't know if he's a custom in the UK but I think so I want to say Happy Father's Day to all the fathers of the local [Applause] [Music] assembly and I bring GRE to you again on behalf of my wife and family and a little church inos Nigeria Amen to the deacons ministers Believers of LCA London and to especially special Monica and the family love Monica and the family you bless you amen all right can we go ahead are you ready I'm not much of a of a Preacher so and I want to apologize up front I'm trying to grow into the slides and things because Peter had that perfected to a to a signs um so um I trust and hope that I'll be able to see something that will be a blessing to you amen so we thank God for the enter message of Malachi 4 and that Prophet came and revealed The Mystery of the entire Bible amen and he came out as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the prophet made the Bible present tense everything in the Bible the stories the history the different circumstances the situations the prophet brought them into present so that he transported the land of the Bible to you and I and we can relate to the things in the Bible as though they were happening today so the Bible becomes not a book of stories but a book of life and the Bible is a book of lessons that God's spirit breathed and spoke to 40 different um writers and they were spread over 1,500 to 2,000 years and that's how the Bible was written God wrote it but through men and there is not one single contradiction in the Bible written by men from diverse backgrounds but you can't find one single contradiction I know that's contrary to what these atheist and some of these other folks try to tell us but they're wrong but that's not the subject of our talk today so the Bible is God's instruction manual for mankind and we thank god brother bam came with a message to make the Bible not a book of history but a Living Word a living book that you and I can relate to you amen am it's a book that teaches us all the lessons that life has ever and will ever teach mankind because God put those lessons the Bible is a book of life in all his ramifications Natural Life spiritual life you find the answer in the Bible you find the instructions in the Bible and we thank God for that prophet of Malachi for who came and preached the entire Bible so how privileged we are for many young folks who are born in the message there a t value these things is almost sometimes feels like you know we we like being hedged in but for those who have been able to taste out of the message you find that there is nothing that even comes a close second to this message and we're not saying that in Pride we send that with gratitude to the grace of God so we thank God for Prophet that came and unveiled and revealed the Bible and uncovered the life lessons that are hidden within its pages from the different lives and the characters in The Bible and that Prophet revealed shadows and types from the Bible and with a message around it and by that message he has called out a bride shape a bride molding a bright so she will be like Jesus Christ so she'll be prepared and made ready for the resurrection and the Rapture because that's what we are here doing on the face of this Earth the most important job any Minister can do is to prepare their people for the coming of the Lord because after all has been said and done the ENT time message of Malachi 4 the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders that that Prophet brought that great Elijah Prophet is end time message is only an invitation to live the life of Jesus Christ that's all there is to it is an invitation that you might be like Jesus it breaks down to world to you that even a little child can understand I want to be like Jesus not in your head but something in your soul to be like Jesus how we thank God for that great Elijah prophet of Malachi 4 that's what the message is about so we've come here today as we do on all days we come to church and even in our homes when we read the word or when we have a family devotions or even in our private lives when we pick up the word we pick up the word to learn life lessons from the Bible from what the the prophet of malach for has revealed to us I'm speaking about learning the Bible carries this thought further because we learn from the Bible like I said already but the Bible carries it further and let us understand that we also can learn even people whose lives have been impacted by God whether they here whether they have passed on and this Lear experience is what we all need to Perfect The Art of Doing so that our lives can be shaped to be more like Jesus every single day amen especially when somebody has passed on that occasion offers us a great learning experience to learn from the life of one who used to be with us but has now passed on eternity Ecclesiastes 7 vers 108 I'm trying to keep a TB on my time here um um because um it says verses 108 I'll just read through that quickly a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth why he saying this here is because that offers us chance to look in the present's life and learn when we learn from their lives we add it to our lives just become better people become more shaped into the image of Jesus Christ he say it's better to go to the house of morning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay to his heart sorrow is better than laughter amen by the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better these are like you know what you call like oxymoronic things how can sorrow be better and all of that but it's because when there's a death we have a the opportunity to look at the life and we can connect the dots things we did not even we did not even see didn't place any importance on while the person was alive when they are gone we can connect the dogs and see oh and apply to our lives amen verse four the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of merth in other in other words our pastor brother Peter has passed on and we still hurt because I still hurt and if I feel this way I know you still hurt and nobody tells me not to hurt what Jesus said is don't hurt and sorrow like the world be hurt but in the midst of that we want to look back and see how brother Peter's life inspires us to be better people oh that's what Pastor was saying and we let the devil know even though our pastor is gone we're living testimony of what he wanted to us to be I wish the pastor Could See Me Now to see I'm better today than I was last week and I'll be better tomorrow still that's what is all about the heart of the wise is the has of morning even though we mourn let's be wise so we can learn from this great life that that was here with us and shephered us and lived an example and a legacy before us the heart of the wife the has of morning but the Heart of Heart of foce is in the house of Mer and I'll move on down to verse eight better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit so what the is saying here it's better at the end of a life when a baby is born you can't learn anything from the baby's life because the baby might turn out good it might turn out not so good but when somebody's passed on you can take a look at their lives and connect the dots and take inspiration for your own life and that's why the end of a thing is better than the beginning there so we want to learn from the life of one who was here with us until just a few weeks ago our pastor brother Peter Chandler and I don't mean just today I'm mean like every single day that's what you do when when you think what would Jesus do what would he do how would Pastor want this handle how would Pastor want me to do this here not because you are glorifying a man but you are leaving a testament and you are taking an inspiration from the life of one that went ahead of you so we want to learn so that in the midst of our pain and sorrow the lessons from his life will more us into better human beings better Christians than we were even while he was here so we come to church to learn to learn the Life of Christ life is all about learning we human beings are learning creatures that's just how God made us that's just how we are wise you don't have to feel that way that's just how we are amen we were created and programmed by God the Creator to learn and unfortunately we also happen to learn the good and the bad but it wasn't supposed to be that way because in the beginning you were programmed to learn the good but the fall changed all that and the ability and the capability to learn the bad came in after the fall so life all life is about learning and as we learn we live and as we learn we grow you know the scripture that says um um he that is dead while leaving those people are leaving but they're not learning anything and when you don't learn you are not leaving you are just alive you are not leaving life so as we learn we leave we grow because when we stop learning we stop growing we stop leaving and we die and we begin this PR of learning only hours after we are born some say six hours after we are born the baby starts to learn its environment start to learn the feel of the plank start to learn the warmth of his mother's body and even stories tell us now I mean for some time now that we even start this learning process from the womb that's why you'll see mothers talking to their babies while they in the womb and that baby in the womb has learned the mother's voice so that when that baby comes out it knows the mother's voice and goes right away to the mother's bosom to try to get milk for so that is what learning does to us we start learning as soon as we come here into the world and as we learn we form habits and the habits shape us and form our character and the character that we form defines the person that we become therefore when we are born each one of us tou on a learning ADV Adventure which is called the Journey of life and what we make of our journey through life is defined by what we learn it's defined by our learning because life is all about learning the Lord Jesus he came here with the gospel of redemption not justification but Redemption and when he came he came was to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and Israel rejected his message and history tells us St Matthew 11 I think Scofield says that and other history that St Matthew 11 was the lowest moment in the physical existence of the Lord Jesus Christ because he had been rejected nobody lacked rejection he had been rejected and he was feeling so low and in that state he turned around with a new message to a new audience and said come unto me all you that labor and a heavy laden and I will give you rest come and learn of me and take my yoke upon you and you shall find rest your souls for my yoke is easy and my bur is light that's how he announced his his Gospel of redemption he did not say come and be saved it didn't say Come and Get Right with God it didn't say come and be rid of your sins none of that he said come and learn come and learn amen hallelujah ever wonder why he said come and learn because veiled away and talked into the learning is the story of redemption Redemption not justification the Redemption justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the forming of the word image an adoption time to where born Sons F Sons will speak and their words will be back all that is veiled in that common land of me God very God in human skin that's how he announced his his ministry amen and in in in the word learning is heeding how this all came about is that word learning is heeding all the story from way back in elohim's mind in that and in there is veiled also how we can appropriate these blessings of redemption for ourselves so life is a journey a journey of learning and if you if you notice a typical Journey has two character istics to it two qualities at least to it has a destination and has a purpose but I ask is that invariably so it should be but is it invariably so a a journey has a destination and a purpose it should be but not necessarily so because when uh um um God spoke to Lucifer in Job chapter one said where you going said nowhere I just been going through and I have no purpose this I'm I'm just going around so that proves to you that you can have a journey that has no purpose at all and the devil anoints people in the world today who are in this world here as though this life has no purpose as it has no meaning amen but even though you can go through life or a journey without a particular specific purpose I mean without a destination rather every Journey has a specific purpose like Lucifer did not have a destination said I'm going through andow but he had a purpose to cause trouble and every Journey even though it does not have a destination has a purpose amen but even H but but our journey of life has a destination has a [Music] purpose and once your journey is completed you go back to your destination like I've come here from Nigeria I've finished my journey the purpose I go back home Jesus said I come from God to finish this work and I go back to God again that's right right we are born into this world brought here by and this journey of life has a purpose and also has a destination even though many would like us to believe we just we're just here and when we leave here that's all that all there is to it don't you believe it don't you believe it because there's nothing could be further from the truth and it doesn't make sense even a little child can know that doesn't make any sense I came to the UK and then I have no destination I just I just they will ask you at the at the Visa I mean the the border border post what is your purpose in coming here and many times they ask you where is your address that you are staying so you have a purpose and a destination for every but the Journey of Life someone will believe you are just here and when we die that's it we just disappear no it it doesn't even make sense from nature doesn't make any sense at all so it's so easy for a child to see the Folly and the fallacy of that argument because what those people fail to understand about the Journey of life is that God gives each one of us the choice to determine our own destination when our journey is ended and our time on Earth is complete so when you hear somebody saying just there he hasn't chosen his destination but if you don't choose your destination there's a destination you are going to go to but God rich in Mercy gives us the choice to choose our destination so when our journey on life is finished we go back to our father's home Jesus said I come from God I go back to God again hallelujah amen so my young man my young woman whoever don't let anybody tell you that we come here and we just die and nothing happens after that it doesn't make sense we come here there's a home to go to there's a head to stay away from and by God's grace we believe we are predestinated to go back to our father's home Hallelujah so we are here for a specific purpose That's Unique for each one of us and they suddenly just destination waiting for each one of us at the end of life Journey but that destination God gives us the choice to decide whether where we want to go to if we if we don't take a choice by default we have taken a choice that we are going to the place of the town for here we are God's Sons and Daughters predestinated to come from God predestinated to go back to God again Hallelujah so here with a purpose we are here in this world here whether you young or old you are you have a purpose in being here there's a purpose while we are here now speaking of purpose our purpose in life has two parts to it two sides to it one part of the purpose is a common purpose we all have and the other part of the purpose the second half of it is specific for you for you to do Jesus said 33 years old he said father I thank Thee I have finish the work which you gave me to do he was 33 years old he finished the work that God gave him to do each one of us here you have a specific job that God has given you to do and you will do it by the grace of almighty God we didn't just come here to LLY gag around we came here for a purpose we are Purpose Driven out of my way Satan ad of my way I got the king's message we are here for a purpose we come from God and we go back to God again beli thou this beli thou this Hallelujah so I said our purpose one half is two purpose is twofold one half is common to all of us and one half of the purpose is specific for you what's the half common to all of us Solomon told us that and I read the scripture Ecclesiastes 12 this is the whole duty of man to Ser God and keep his Commandments whether you are Elon Musk or you are or you are Joe Biden or Donald Trump or you are the little boy in the garage or you are the bus conductor let's hear the conclusion of the whole matter Every Man Has This purpose to serve God to serve God to serve God and keep his Commandments [Music] [Applause] amen the purpose to serve God to make it our lives work that's the whole duty of man hallah Ecclesiastes 12 tells us that all of us have that job that work so to speak where you are called to serve that's a ministry that's a Ministry amen I I I don't know in the UK how they do it but but in Nigeria and most parts of Africa they call the government departments Ministries in Africa those guys think they are there for you to serve them but a minister that's why call a minister of the Gospel a minister is to serve the minister serves the minister of of of Education you serve the education sector minister of Health Ser the health sector the minister of the Gospel she serve the gospel sector Ser the people in the assembly so when God says this Hy of man to ser God it means God given each one of us a Ministry to share to find the spot where God wants us to be so we can serve him and let your light shine for Jesus you must shine it from your heart to brighten up the corner where you are [Applause] Hallelujah amen the other half that's specific to you what is that that's a specific thing that God gave you to do you can say I'm serving God that's the whole duty of man and just sit back you sit in your home all day long and you don't do anything else no that other path is what you want to do what God wants you to do what God wants you to be brother T us he may be a housewife he may be a preacher he may be a farmer he may be a doctor may be a lawyer but you take that Ministry to serve God and keep his Commandments you take it into your other job your specific purpose so while you are a mother you are serving God and keeping all his Commandments while you are a doctor you are serving God and keeping all his Commandments while you are a farmer you are serving God and keeping all his Commandments while you are a father you are serving God and keeping all his Commandments whether you are the president of the country you're supposed to serve God and be guided by the word of God because this is the whole duty of man to serve God and keep his Commandments in other words your work is your ministry you bring your ministry to your work your ministry to serve God you bring it to your work as a doctor as a lawyer as a nurse as a business consultant as a farmer as a father as a mother your work is your ministry Hallelujah let's hear the conclusion of the whole matter serve God and keep his commandments so put together the two parts of our Po in life out up to this in addition to Every Man's specific work and purpose every specific work and purpose we find a universal purpose common to all of us which is to serve God and keep his Commandments which is essentially a Ministry doesn't make you a Ministry of the Gospel but a Ministry to God that God's given you amen because you are there to serve amen let your your mother serve with the principles of the kingdom of God you are a father serve in nurturing your home with the principles of the kingom of God if you're a doctor Ser in Rel your patience on the job with the principles of the kingdom of God whatever you're calling is you take your ministry into the workplace every single day so what is what this ultimately means is that your work is not only your purpose is also your ministry the place where God has planted you to serve God and keep his Commandments in other words your purpose is connected to your life's work in other words your work is your ministry the place to serve God and keep his Commandments and once we have committed our purpose our task our ministry our walk here on Earth it's time to go back to our destination it's time to say like Jesus I have finished the work which you have given me to do and I come back to you oh father that you glorify me with the glory I had with you before the of the world oh Hallelujah can you say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so how much time do you and I have to fulfill this this calling that's been given to us to serve God in a calling to have a ministry as a pastor as a father as a mother as a farmer to have it how long time do we have how long time do we have truth truth is none of us knows none of us knows how long time is to on so how much time to us we do not know but let's hear what job said in the Bible Job 14 ver 1 5 the man that is born of a woman woman is a few days and full of trouble he come for like a flower beautiful and is cut down it fleeth also as a shadow and Contin not and does thou open Thine Eyes Upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean one seeing his days that's man seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with me God are with thee God thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass so what job is here saying is that God set the boundaries of our time on out here our entry and our exit they could not extend it by one Split Second nothing happens to God by accident what you and I should focus on is I want to finish the work I must finish the work I must finish the work Jesus finish his work and I'll show you Pastor Chand finish his work I will show you from the Bible Hallelujah and you and I are still here are we going to finish our work that's what God is interested in it's not how long or how short amen so how much time do we have to finish our work nobody knows but this much we know from what we read in job each of us has only a few days and those days have been predetermined by God and we can't extend those days not even by a second I me even though we all trust three score years and 10 and even up to 8 as some says but if you notice even our Lord Jesus Christ God is example son did not spend half of 70 years he spend only 33 years but in spite of that short period of time he came at the end of those 33 years and said father I have finished the work which th gave us me to do he was a young man in our context but he has finish the work what a Purpose Driven young man what a Purpose Driven young man oh hallelujah amen only 33 years of age but he finished the work that he was sent here to do he finished the work which God appointed him to do he achieved his life purpose and talk about the impact that his life those short 33 short years had on all Humanity mankind has never been the same amen he impacted life so much that 2,000 years on that impact is still going on so life is all about the purpose and the destination we're going to but also about the impact that we live so the Journey of life is not about how long or how short the Journey of life is about purpose and the work that you do to engage in and fulfill that purpose it's all about finishing your work and fulfilling your purpose and then after your work has been done and your purpose has been fulfilled what is the impact and the legacy of your work in the life of others both for the present and the future Hallelujah so the Journey of life is all about finishing your work and leaving behind an impact as great and as massive as it can be like Jesus in the Journey of his life 33 years old when he when he died he finished his work he fulfilled his purpose and lay behind an impact and a legacy that last up until today so I ask you today as I'm trying to wind down here do you know why you're here on Earth my young man my young woman do you know why you're here on Earth fathers mothers do we know what we here amen Jesus said I have finished the world and we tell God that the work you gave me to do amen I'll show you in a minute how to arrive at that amen I see many people I don't mean here generally young people I want to know what's my purpose what's my purpose no you don't have to do that yeah there are things you can consider but I'll just show you from the life of Jesus how to walk into your purpose amen amen amen amen so I ask you today again do you know why here do you know your purpose I told you one half of the purpose to serve God and keep his Commandments but in there also we all have to have a specific thing that God gave us to do not everybody could be the Savior only one could do that Jesus not everyone could be the mother of your child only you could do that whatever God wants you to do it's specific to you and I so do you know why you're here on Earth sadly many human beings don't and that's why they conform you find young people even some older people just conform just want to be like everybody else but Romans 12 tells us to prove that people just conformed Romans 12 tells us be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so you may prove what is is that good and perfect and acceptable will of God so I ask you why are you living at all why are we here but more specifically why are you here have you found out your purpose the work you are send here to accomplish and finish when you find your purpose then your life becomes a Purpose Driven Life that purpose drives you brother gram said in that famous message that I spoke to the young people people he said that young man he said something present it to you a certain something presents it to you and it's right in your soul and that certain something drives you drives you towards your goal drives you that when you find what your purpose is when you find that purpose nothing can stand in your way when you find out what your purpose is the Devil is a finished Hallelujah oh hallelujah amen brother Peter found his purpose Hallelujah Jesus found his purpose and he finished his work I have finished the work and on calvary's Mountain the last words he spoke it is finished even before he went to face the devil in hell I finished the work oh hallelujah what is said what a lord What A Savior and I can tell you without any Shadow of Doubt that brother Peter Chandler he found his purpose and he lived a Purpose Driven Life brother Peter found his found out his life's purpose found his life's work he found life's true meaning how do I know because it's easy to identify someone anyone who's living with purpose someone who's living for a curse it's easy to find out is you to find out somebody too who is just going here there just going to and throw but when you find somebody who live for a purpose it's easy to see it amen when you find somebody who from the purpose they live with passion they live with Zeal they live with diligence Hallelujah and therefore I say without any shadow of a doubt that brother Peter was ready for death he was ready to go not that he wanted to leave but he was ready to leave this world here and we also should make ready because we don't know when the when when when the time is going to come sister Monica gave that testimony that when she saw the look on mother Peter's face he was like he said I made it of course he made it I believe that last moment that's when that settled on his face I'm going out of here goodbye World good morning glory I made it Hallelujah and he's waiting for us on the other side he's waiting for every one of us young and old male female boy and girl our pastor is waiting on the other side Hallelujah who's going to go who's going to go hallelujah hallelujah like Jesus Christ Peter could cry out I finished the work which you gave me to do like Jesus on the cross they could cry out it is finished I made it I finished the work which you sent me here to do so in closing here how do you find your life's purpose how you find it from the life of Jesus by living a life that's full of zeal amen so the question you and I have here today how do you find your life's purpose and Jesus answered this for us by living your life with zeal with passion with diligence with commitment with dedication with energy with a zest for Life leaving life not reacting to life taking charge of Life Hallelujah not not lethargic letting life happen to you but being proactive and taking the son of the spirit and marching on in life Hallelujah taking life on with seal with V with vitality and as you do that you do with optimism with enthusiasm with passion with hope what's my specific purpose I don't know but when you live this way it to lead you to your purpose hallelujah amen hallelujah am so the simple answer to the question I have for my purpose is veil in the life of Jesus Christ when you live this way like he Liv cried out the Zeal of the house of the Lord has me up when you live this way that Zeal eats you up you will find your purpose Jesus Christ 12 years old before he got into his purpose his real purpose was to be your lord your savior before he come to that spot look at the Zeal 12 years old in the temple his mother came and said we have been looking for you he said don't you know woman I must be about my father's business the SE of the house of the Lord him up amen amen when you live this way it will lead you to your purpose the specific work that God ordained for you here on Earth a life of zeal life of diligence given all diligence to your faith virt knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness and charity never fail when you go with diligence live your life with diligence as a housewife as a mother as a doctor as a student whatever you do when you leave your life with diligence it will lead you to your purpose you will happen on your purpose you will know this for this very purpose I have come to this hallelujah praise God Hallelujah Jesus showed us the part of zeal and diligence and passion and commitment whatsoever thy hand to do with all th might when you're in the church you are in the s s Department with all your might God may want you a young man to be a pastor to some missionary down the road just where you where you are planted now faithful there apply all the Ze you know it will lead you to your purpose Hallelujah Jesus Liv his that life with Zeal and said this love the house of Lord me up with a Zeal with passion with diligence as that 12 year old in the temple as a carpenter he didn't come here to be a carpenter that was what his life's work at the time and he did it with diligence seal the same seal he applied when he became the savior he was known the Bible says the carpenter of Nazareth in other words if you get to Nazareth where's the carpenter they will take you to Jesus shop because he made Master tables IA was a joke compared to him he was good he was good at his job he was excellent at his job till he got the name the carpenter of Nazareth and they call you the N of whatever can they call you the mother or whatever because you was so good at the job the seal the dedication the diligence the passion he applied to it he didn't sit back until I come to where I'm going to die on the cross no that Zeal him up that's the pathway to find your purpose in life oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] am H the purpose the Zeal Le the purpose and then when Le the purpose he will energize you on a daily basis to work in that purpose to fulfill your life's purpose oh my I think I just let let this go be sure that somebody won't feel I'm just talking about hard work I'm talking about passion then you'll find people they tell that musk has lot passion that you don't even have has passion for his job I'm not talking about that because I said the purpose is in two halves first half serve God keep his Commandments second half what you are given to do specif for you it might be speci for ellon musk to do all the things he's doing but how about the first house because until you connect the two together you hav't find your real purpose and until you find your real purpose you haven't assured your destination yet you have not confirmed your reservation yet so Alon musk has found the other half and he's doing a great job with it the president of your company the president of the company the mayor of London or whoever they there maybe they found that and they're doing a great job of it but how about the other half that says the whole duty of man is to serve God and keep his Commandments that's where we come in that's where we are different we combine the two together and find our purpose so we can confirm our destination when we live here so we can say I have finished the work that's what Pastor CH say I have finished the work I have confirmed my reservation and therefore now it's l up for me a Crown of Glory like Paul said oh hallelujah hallelujah amen I know anyone who knows Pastor Chandler knows that he lives his life like Jesus lived I'm not saying he was Jesus I said this message is an invitation to be like Jesus and Pastor CH live his life like Jesus lived with Zeal with deligence can I get a witness in the house can I get a witness in the house with passion can I get a witness in the house come on can I get a witness that's our pastor with Zeal with diligence I seen pictures the Zeal of the house of the Lord Brother Chandler knocking doing the carpentry work doing all the things just serving not waiting to be served but serving do whatever needs to be done resal at him up the Zeal eats you up on your job in Microsoft and doesn't eat you up in church you miss something there but if there ISS up in Microsoft ISS up in the house of God whether you are just singer in the service you're a worshiper Let Your Presence be felt in church like brother Raymond will always say I came to church to let the devil know what side I am on let that Zeal eat you up when you come to church let the devil know he's in church she's in church why the Zeal of the house of the Lord you oh Hallelujah hallelujah amen my last comment here and I try to close in by 5 minutes amen so you see now that zeil is everything but what does you really mean to live with Zeal I said so I said it already let me make it real clear real Zeal is not only passionate about his purpose let me get this let me do well on my J let me do this well no real Zeal Focus not not not just on the purpose of the journey real Zeal focus is also on finishing the journey and arriving at the destination which is the end goal of the journey I'm saying about all these guys they've done a great job but are they arriving at the destination to go back to a guard well you can judge in other words real is not just about diligence and passion it's also about arriving at the destination amen so in the scriptural context of zeal we must fulfill the two houses of our purpose on Earth before we'll arrive at the destination after our time on Earth has ended the elos and and all the guys of this world here God is waiting on them to fulfill the second half which is to Ser God they can say at the end of their Liv my therefore it's little for me a Crown of Glory Hallelujah but mostly the people neglect the more important Health which is which is to make the service of God as the sole purpose of Our Lives because it's this First Health that ensures that you make a choice to arrive at your Eternal destination in the father's home above after your journey on earth is like Israel in the Old Testament all these guys who don't focus on serving God as the more important purpose of their lives they're like Israel in the Old Testament like Paul said of them Brethren they serve God according to Zeal but not according to knowledge amen Romans 10 verse1 verse to ver4 Brethren my heart desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves to the right of God for the for Christ is the end of the law to them Hallelujah so church so Church what does it mean to be Zeal us Revelation 3 and verse 19 as many as I Lord I rebuke and chasten be Zeal us therefore and repent brother bam said to be truly zealous you must repent first the Journey of zeal begins at repentance did Al musos begin at repentance I don't know but your journey of zeal that's going to win you a Crown of Glory begins our repentance the relationship with the father Hallelujah the Journey of zeal begins at repentance is not just being diligent and hard working no he deeper than that real Zeal drivs you to repentance first your inner man is changed somebody steps into your heart somebody steps into your life you become a prisoner of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and when you are that way then you can go in Microsoft or or wherever you are KPMG whatever and let that seal because that seal is now under the control of the spirit of God under the control of God's word because you know my whole business in this job is your Ser God and keep his Commandments our pastor an example our pastor an example ofal that get by repentance a repentant heart a heart in relationship with Jesus Christ a heart that turn around and walking with Jesus every day and you apply that Zeal in your heart it flows out every day into your external things on your job in your home on the farm so you got it all together the inner game and the outer game of zeal connected together oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm finished that's what it means to be zealous repentance relationship with Jesus Christ and then that Spirit drives you to be Zeal Us in the things of God and you can say like Jesus you can say like Peter Chandler the Zeal of the house of the Lord and you can go on your job that Zeal eats you up on your job but don't getting up on your job and there's no Zeal of the House of a lord in there you are no better than Elon Musk no better than these guys but thank God for a prophet thank God for an example that we have had before us oh Hallelujah when you live this way you will finish the work living this way you are ready for death when he comes you don't fear death you are ready you fear no evil you don't fear the dark Valley of the shadow of death you are ready like brother Peter was ready Hallelujah you able to say like David said I walk through the valley of the I will fear no evil so are enclosing the LC London family I challenge you with the example of our pastor Pastor Peter Chandler that example should be a Guiding Light for all of us young old father mother we brother Peter merch the two house of purpose whatever in his life's calling and that calling to serve God and keep his Commandments we mark them together and we saw a life full of seal we saw a life that was passionate that was diligent in doing his pastoral work amen and whatever need to do we saw that so the example of our pastor to be a Guiding Light to all of us because we could never ask for a better example to be a comfort to am miss the grief of losing him so unexpected and so soon and so sudden brother Peter gave all of us especially you here his whole life his family natural and his family in the Lord's here he gave us all the greatest gift gift of all leaving an example before us by sharing with us the good news of the gift of God the gift of God Jesus Christ and then living that life before us we saw great zeal and passion and so diligence I admonish you again as I close out Stay Together Stay Together be passionate be zealous Stay Together be diligent Amen in keeping this church one take care of s Monica and the family amen make sure they will not have to you know feel like brother Peter is not here again the way we have been treated and forgive me for saying that I've been around quite a bit that happened too many times that happen too many times and that's why I say the spirit in this church here is so sweet and I hope we not get there I've seen churches where the pastor's family is you know battered and it's like it's not your time no more it's our time now don't do that give s Monica more respect than you even gave her my brother CH was here love her respect her give her a PR Place make her like a mother in Israel amen amen and then keep on repenting every day said all of us we need to repent every day so we can sharpen our Zeal because the Zeal is what will take you thereal what gives you the momentum that you need to go into the kingdom of God the kingdom of God suffers violence the violence that's the Zeal in closing I read Ecclesiastes 12 ver 13 and 14 again let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every every walk into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good whether it be evil and I said like brother bam said amen amen love one another above everything amen can I just read as I close keep playing something softly [Music] please brother bham we've read this I know you read many times but let's read together let's turn on our feet let's read this together love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring in somebody in to make his Target it bring some critic in or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman orever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor our pastor has gone but he taught us well I've seen many churches a new pastor comes and they try to undo all that the old Pastor did don't do that LC it doesn't work out well but here's the example here set the pattern and Joshua came Joshua said all that Moses the servant of the Lord has commanded that will we do and that have I done Joshua buil upon thees and we will build upon the we will not tear it down build upon the and he says stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and you give him respect he'll lead you through and because he Ed of God to do now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling them much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't ever Clan among yourselves talk or make yourself clish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you not your right hand he's my left hand want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right out with one another and now you've got tips on that you've got tips on what we believe you've got tips on discipline the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in heaven plac don't stay home don't say the pastor is not here don't stay home come to church if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open and Yonder to get in here to flesh with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray because we're in the last days where the Bible exalted much more as you see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and to love one another but this would all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for another that's right te right together if the brother you think is a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of beatness up it will affect them and take they Crush right out of my own life that poison has of malage and jealousy and hatred that will just make the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here you kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here H your pastor you'll do everything see don't you do that you just wa that much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified here the other night having a buckle seeing a vision just that buckle on the word whole armor of God just pull

preparation this coming Friday it's the first Friday of the month so it's our day of prayer and fast and culminating in our Zoom prayer meeting at 8:00 p.m. and we want to dedicate this pray and fast day and the prayer meeting to the upcoming convention uh so we want to make that the focus and the burden so once again service continues this Wednesday here at the Tabernacle and we have our day of prayer and fast on Friday to culminate in a zoom prayer meeting at 8:00 p.m. this coming Sunday is the first Sunday of the month but we will only have one service this coming Sunday we will only have

but the people are the ones who move the Revival so the Revival starts with us in our home in our prayer closets in our expectation and brother bham taught us you get what you expect so I encourage you to dig your Valley full of ditches but Bram said the deeper you dig the more blessing you could hold the more water you could hold so dig deep ditches raise your expectations higher than you've ever had it before but Bram said we need to ask for big things so whatever your need is whatever your desire is you need to raise it whatever whatever your hope is raise it you didn't ask enough so ask for more ask God for big things so we're looking for God to restore homes families marriages situations backsliders and I feel like as we are coming to the end of this journey as it were when was time for Moses to leave Pharaoh say take everything take your flocks take everything and go and we're going to reach that point friends where the enemy will say just take your family and go take them I know they they messed up here I but just take them and go because I tired of dealing with this God that you serve is too too this God is too big so I going to encourage you Church we're not going to leave one behind you're not going to leave your son behind you're not going to leave your daughter behind you're not going to leave your loved ones behind and brother bam taught us all that he ever love or love you will be over there so we are prophesying of a restoration of a Deliverance of every backslider of your children your family your friends your loved ones they are going to be under the blood and the and Jesus told them the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off and as many as the Lord Our God shall call so we are looking you better hold onto your seat because God is going to break chains and shackles and you're going to see people rushing inside of here not to see man but to see the Lord Jesus Christ the resurrected Living manifested Lord Jesus Christ so may the Lord Rich you bless you stay on the firing line we are traveling on the right Road and I trust that from the message today we'll all be able to give that testimony that we have finished the work both in the natural and the spiritual to walk with purpose to live with purpose to worship with purpose to Hallelujah put a smile on your face because you know you're born for a purpose may the Lord richly bless you brother Anthony many many amen so as the brothers get ready to Usher us out May God richly bless you and may his cause his face to smile upon you as you leave
