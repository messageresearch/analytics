lord well those of you who was near old last night happy new year and may the blessings of god uh be upon you for this coming year that god would shine his light upon you in a life of service and if you're in prison that god would bring you out of your prison because there are people that are in prison and they need to come out of the prison some people in the prison of selfishness the prison of lust in the prison of anger and temper in the prison of hate and the prison of jealousy in the prison of holland grudges and the prisoner of holy north real prisons these are like spiritual prisons and you have to have a desire to get out of it and uh you know i was sharing something with some brothers about something i like to say it like a default position each one of us have like a default the default in which the environment family environment what you grow up how you grow up uh what you learn educational level whatever but there's a default position in which you react to things and do things and act in a way that that is what you know that is what you call the default position so anything happen you fall back to that level of what you are custom with we don't like new things we don't like strange things we don't like things that shake us off of our comfort zone but sometimes god arranged those things it's amazing that god don't ever tell people stay where you are i'm going to come to you he just tell abraham get out get out from among your people get out from your country onto a land i will show you i'll not even show you right now i will show you just take a move get out so what god challenges us is to get out of our default zone get out of our comfort zone you don't ever raise your hands and you get out of that by raising your hands you don't ever shout you get out of that by shouting you're selfish you get out of that by giving by sharing you're extending yourself there's some people who see for themselves and their family their own circle they cannot effectively serve but for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and jesus came serving whosoever want to hear him whosoever want to receive him whoever want to get a breakthrough he went about doing good and to serve and there was one man he was full of demons full of devils isn't that right he was legion had a thousand devils and he cried out hallelujah forgot to deliver him he was still an individual having a choice he born by demon powers still had the voice to cry for a breakthrough there is no excuse for you not having a desire for a breakthrough there is no excuse for you having not having a desire to break past your limitations your situations your past your psychological issues there is no reason for that because that man had a thousand demons wasn't six wasn't ten a whole thousand and he cried and he cared to call upon the lord and when he cried jesus heard his cry and jesus came and delivered him those demons had him naked those demons had him stripped and when he was delivered he went and get some clothes praise the name of the lord so i don't care what your condition is this evening i don't care what your condition is this morning god is able to deliver you from your default condition environment and situation what your mama tell you what your grandmother tell you what your grandpa tell you what your environment allowed for you you could break out of that you need to break out of that you need to get out of that god will drop some bombs to rock you out of that oh hallelujah could somebody say amen amen that's why the bible said let the week say i am strong because the weak default position is i am weak and i am struggling and i can't make it but god like to jam the issue and shake you and rock you from that default position to say let the weak say i am strong harley let the poor say i am rich and let the sick say i am healed give the lord a shout to pray oh glory glory glory and glory the bible talk about the desert blossoming like a wilderness the bible talk about in the desert springs will come forward god like to challenge the situation he like to question baroness and say rejoice don't parent you're going to produce more than the woman with child god loves to do that oh hallelujah who gonna help me preach this morning oh hallelujah bible talk about the baron brick fought into singing a baron can't sing baron is grieving for child grieving for breakthrough grieving and the church is barren and not even grieving [Music] all these virtues the early church had we have more books than they had we have more preachers than they had we have more tapes more mystery more knowledge than they had it seems that our hearts have been turned back to the books that the fathers did not have but that's not the promise turn the hearts of the trend back to reading no back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints let me tell you something church that's backslide i'm not hearing you this morning [Applause] amen preaches this backslide elder says backslide people as backfired but god have a way of bringing them back not because somebody is in church everything is all right no sometimes the devil calls in havoc sometimes they walk into what the devil have created and the devil not moving because sin is there unbelief is there principle's brokenness there and god can't even touch it [Music] this year is going to be a different year [Applause] this year you're going to get a breakthrough this year you're going to get a breakthrough yeah yeah this year it's also going to be judgment if you're going to get a breakthrough judgment is also going to strike because you're going to get the picture in the midst of judgment oh hallelujah we're not looking for blessings no no no god said behold i send you elijah before what before that great and terrible day of the lord that's what's coming a terrible day is coming a day of blackness and gloom it is a terrible day is coming for the entire world a terrible day is coming if you think think tough now a terrible day is coming it's gonna get worse worse worse so stop complaining my god they're gonna get worse so you are one in a million that's why you should shout that's why you should rejoice that's why you should honor god listen with your whole heart you won't be seated [Applause] money is a corrupter you know the bible said the love of money not moneyness but the love of it some people just love it they say more money they just love it the love of it is the root of all evil because they keep grabbing at it they're lusting for it they're pushing for it depressing for it to get things and jesus said a man life does not consist of the amount of things that he possesses there are people have more cars that they could drive but they have the things like toys natural things that going to fade away and you come to church hearing a message that god has sent to prepare a people for the coming of the lord but jesus said they're going to say the lord delay his coming and if the lord delays we may as well do our own thing but there is going to be a brand that going to testify that the lord himself has descended with a shout out to get us out oh can we give the lord some worship we're gonna read the scripture just now there are some ministers going to preach till they die they're not preaching for the rapture they're not preaching for the second of the lord they're preaching because the whole service is around them they will preach till they're dead they have no beating for the people they have no burden for revile because revival comes with a burden another question i want to ask you this morning god promised a revival what are we willing to do to get it amen god promised a revival god promised a revival what are you willing to do to get it or are you just gonna come to church and go back home and think that is all right i said big fat no that is not all right if god promised something there's gonna be somebody that's not going to only speak it or claim it but they're going to walk in the light of it there's going to be a people that he's called for his namesake oh glory to god my god i feel inspired now you may be seated one time god told israel is not because of you i am doing what i am doing i am doing to you for my name's sake that my name not be defiled among the gentiles god does do things for his order god is doing things for his glory god does do things for his name's sake oh hallelujah not for you but for his glory not for you but for his honor he deserves the honor he deserves the glory there's going to be healings [Applause] i shouldn't tell you to say email on that you should be so convinced i'm not talking about this pentecostal fraud i'm not talking about that i'm talking about the dynamic power coming into the sons of god listen to unveil god [Applause] you might be seated no no no i'm not talking about a man studying last night coming to preach a good message i'm not talking about that i'm talking when god pulled fire step into human skill set into 16 elements and god put on your shoes and god take the scriptures break the word and god come along and confirm the word that's what we are talking about a living god not a paper god a living god of god that discerns the god that could call out sin the god that rebukes the god that corrects the god that instructs the god that bring down the intelligence for your family's condition for your house for you to know what to do or give the lord maybe see that god that brings the probe of the spirit who the word that not only preaches but the zone and the core between the bone and the marrow and they send the thoughts and intents of the heart to god that go behind and could say why have you lied to the holy ghost that's the god we talking about that's not paper gospel that's the peter getting the taught last night that is god looking into peter's eyes and seen into the souls of those in the church that is the pure fire promised to be in the sons of god in the last days could we give god some praises i'm not talking about some preacher going to bible school i'm not talking about education and intellectual stuff because they had that in the old testament they had that with israel you may be seated the story we know with david angola and we know the story intellectuals was governed in a church at that time intellectuals with natural sword because them days is natural sword but you're afraid with your soul trained men they're afraid nobody want to go out glad and pinned down and they will come untrained untrained no school no training no left right left right left right turn right to the left polish your boots none of that none of that but he knew god [Applause] you don't have to know the mechanics come on now come on now who who's with me this morning who's with me this morning you don't have to know all the mechanics that you got to know when you put putting the key that engine tumbles maybe how minister talk heard about keaton and keaton and the reason the door is locked because that treasure is behind it if you have nothing behind it it'll make sense to lock in the door with nothing there but if you have stuff i mean you have virtual knowledge and you have temperatures and patience and your signs and wonders and you have miracles and powers and blessings you have it all locked up then faked it's the key that unlocked the door come on no keep acting [Applause] you don't lock up nothing where are behind there boy i want to tell you let us see he hope we know there's nothing there should we look in that four man does lock up treasures have fault and lock it tight because you have stuff behind there but god put stuff in the wood behind there that no scallywag can't just come and take the stuff because god does prove his word bye believers you believers give yourself a shout how many believers in the camp so god when god want to prove something he ain't committed to unbelievers listen to what he said if my people that i call by my name shall pray no shall humble themselves not pray yet you can't pray until you get humble you cannot pray until you could break down yourself and the only thing that hinders you from humbling yourself is your pride oh can somebody say amen this is pastor over in the house this morning don't even think about the service when you're wrong you're wrong the only thing that would hinder you from humbling yourself in your home as a husband and your home as a wife and your home as a child is your pride hallelujah but god is so great he has the ability to humble himself and that's what we must begin to do humble yourself under the mighty hand of the living god humble your pride humble you god can't do that for you he could floor you he could humiliate you he could strip you and many of us need to be stripped because we get puffed up and when they get puffed up you get arrogant and you dress and you shoot some money in the bank and nobody can talk to you but the bible said he come to the humble he come to the mick he come to those people humble yourself under the mighty hand of god and he going to exalt you in due time let people laugh don't find this they shouldn't laugh let them laugh let them mock let them scuff you may be seated jesus did miracles and sign the wonders and guess what many of them were not impressed that was a stunning statement they were jealous envious they want to stop him in other words if you think sign i want to say we love the lord we're going to save god no money passed and still how we could or we could kill him or we could get him when you think the man doing good raising that healing sick multiplying the bread feeding the fishes doing everything possible to be nice and to be good and to be god-like and christian like when you think everybody will hug him and kiss him and be with him everybody you gotta understand it's only two forces you gotta understand the devil of his agents his messengers his men his people the devil don't want jesus to be in power the devil don't want in other words jesus shook up for 400 years that church everybody go to church default position church either pharisee assad you see a herodian or whatever it is everybody conditions normal normal and god said time to interrupt that whole normal program [Applause] so god lose journey baptism [Applause] kentucky fight chicken locust and honey and come down rocket by the banks and repent and come and get baptized don't just say repent and you're doing nothing no you have to get dipped you have to show you're doing something you have to go down in the waters and and join in the bathroom money jordan and when people start to get convicted they start to come one by one he said listen holy come in hold it come in hold it come in he said thanks for coming in and welcome he saw a better big fault fruit don't come and carry it with your foolishness don't come and continue with your anger and your temper and your head you better bring forth fruit john was so dynamic john was so inspirational john was so anointed that they thought he was the one john said who me no you have seen nothing yet the one i come to introduce i'm not even worthy to unloose the jews he is bringing fire fire fire holy ghost on fire that's dynamics brother no man could bring that oh god i have to send that god i have to release that [Applause] so john set them up and they're looking for looking for that and next day a man come walk get baptized and john said behold the lamb of god just walking swiftly humbly hallelujah full of the holy ghost nobody see the drama behind the scenes he's moving into wilderness no escorts no blue lights no motorbike in front of him no elders and whole entourage so wrong then jesus led by the spirit into the wilderness to slap up the devil to let him know i am here now when jesus put some slap on his face he said i go taking a break and jesus went into the temple went into the scriptures i began to release power by the word the spirit is now upon me you can't see it you can't feel it yet but i'm speaking it i am prophesying it the spirit is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good titans not bad news good guidance to set the captive free to bring out the prison doors that are bound and to heal the sick he's prophesying he's talking about a ministry coming he's talking about what is about to happen nobody in here yet nobody delivered yet but he has taken the word and he is presenting it because you know the word is the conductor of the spirit and when you get the word line up the spirit have to follow the spirit have to follow what is lined up by the word [Applause] then jesus made a shocking statement this day this scripture is not present tense this scripture is alive the scripture is vindicated and they were shocked you see if you read it and just leave it dear then it's just another reading you know the catholic readers come and read the scripture right they thought he was just doing that but then he made something more than that he said this scripture you hear right now today present tense i am that fulfillment you are hearing you are seeing you are witnessing and that is where the drama start [Applause] could you imagine reading quotes for years all of a sudden season 10 and when you sit this day the scripture is fulfilled and then they say it's it's not that jesus that's not the man we know carpenter man joseph's son is that this same man we know we took out drive with him he gave us a drop in his car is that the same man then they threw him out and he became the rejected the rejected son of joseph the rejected messiah the rejected cornerstone the rejected stone and they didn't recognize that was the headstone the stone the builders rejected and as they kicked him out he was ready for his ministry he was anointed slap up the devil read the scripture and now he is ready for his ministry officially rejected by church people that was supposed to be expecting messiah officially turned down jesus christ rejected now he was ready could you go to that could you come to being rejected by your mother by your father by your uncle by your neighbor by your friends and your family because you are standing for the word of the messiah and you have become a messiah could you go through that and understand that all the rejection all the confusion is only preparing you for the ministry that god is about to break upon your life [Applause] let's all stand i'm going to change your service just wait for me to be like jesus i want to turn our bibles to jordan chapter 1 and george chapter 2. [Music] to be like jesus honored to be like him all true like training [Music] from it to glory to be [Music] 10 to 15 and joel 2 verse 25 to 29. joel one four and five this is god taught speaking to joel that which the palmer woman had left had the lucas eaton that was the look is that left that's what the kangaroo had left had the caterpillar eaten awakey drunkards and weep and whole only drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth verse 10 the field is wasted the land mourn it for the corners wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisher to be a shame the husband man holy vine dresses for the wheat and for the valley because the harvest of the field is perish the vine is dried up the fig tree languish it the pomegranate tree the palm tree also the apple tree all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men gird yourselves and alignment he priests holy ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth he ministers of my god for the meat offering and the drink coffin is withholding from the house of your god sanctifier fast call a solemn assembly guide the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god and cry unto the lord alas for the day for the day of the lord is at hand another destruction from the almighty shall it come joel chapter two to read numbers 25 and i'll restore to you the years that the locals had eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer one with my great army which i sent among you and he shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that are dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and i shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour my spirit let us pray father we thank you for your word and i pray that the word be interpreted our hearts by your spirit may bring life may begin strength and encouragement and anointing and blessing to your people bless those here with us bless those on the internet connected to us and would hear this message bless them may the anointing flow freely into their homes into the churches into their lives in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you welcome and welcome again you may be seated and welcome to those connected to us live via the internet god richly bless you our title restoration in the time of judgment god promised a revival amen what are we willing to do to get it because if you know the history of revivals or look at church history of any revival it didn't just come there was a preparation always has hearts prepared to get to the revival the astonishing thing the prophet said was that a minister cannot bring a revival that's powerful because we need a revival and you can't have a revival until you have god call men to take it and yet a minister cannot bring it he said it takes the people so somewhere along the line there got to be a transference of the vision of the world being open not to the minister to show how much knowledge he has but it has to be effected to the people that it would transform their lives so as to produce a revival and if you come to church and the word being preached doesn't affect your life affect your life to influence your life you need to get another church you need to get somewhere where you could be inspired enough to move you into action notice what the lord told the people in joel chapter one the meek orphan is cut off drink offering he said weep all night he ministers of the lord sanctify your fast call a solemn assembly in other words take action to get restoration take action to get revival take action to get the breakthrough you don't just sit and said i don't have this you don't just sit and say i'm not getting this i'm not feeling the prison you don't do that you begin to cry out because that's your right as a son to cry out he said if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray you see when you humble yourself then you could sincerely pray because you know you are dependent on him but when you've got something in your pocket and you don't depend upon god and you're going by your might and your strength and by your power you can't pray because you are all right you are strong you're going in your strength but when you understand without him you are nothing when you understand you are nobody and you need him more than ever when you understand that you have to break down yourself before your god then you could effectively pray oh god we have sinned we have failed we are fall short restore the oil restore the wine restore hallelujah [Applause] cry out this is what god wants from his people brother said god was waiting for the people to pray in order to get his servants into action when the people begin to pray and god could come down and said i've heard the cries of my people and i come down to any time if if if legion didn't cry out jesus couldn't respond he had was to cry out in order to get help you see a lot of people in drugs and drink and smoke pong and all kind of but they're not crying out you they get contented at their place of defeat they are satisfied at their place and they are comfortable that they wake up in the morning had to hit the bottle they go through the day they have to take cocaine or they have to smoke a cigarette they are comfortable in that zone nothing tells them that they are dying let me tell them they're on their way out to here you're not living to be 120 you'll be all on the way out of here but why i'm on my way let's give the devil a jamming why i'm on my way let's get victory over the loss of the eyes over the lusts of the flesh over the prayer while be on our way [Applause] jesus knew he was going he knew the victory was at the cross the victory wasn't the signs and the ones actually jesus had small miracles and built up to the raising of the dead that was like a capstone miracle and when they saw the dead raised with lazarus they see the whole world going after this man we have to do something let's call our emergency meeting all we disagree with we have to shake their hands let's form a sahaja yoga immediately immediately let's get this console going to stop this rolling revival called jesus a one-man revivalist we can't stop him because when the people were hungry i was three thousand he took five loaves and two fishes and fed five thousand people that's a dangerous man you can't even cut him off with the bakery you can't cut down food from the man when we said taxes he told his disciples go get a fish and pay give caesar what is caesar how could you defeat a man that seems to know all what he's supposed to do when he's supposed to do where he's supposed to go and how he's supposed to do it how could you how could you choose a man like that off how could you recommend inviting your wedding everything going good they're saving them orders showing the main course menu and they come and tell them the wine ran out jesus i am a guest too i don't have a winery i'm not in the grave stamping business i never grape store in business what have i to do with that then some whatever you say do do oh god could we come to that spot that whatever he said whatever court tell you you could do without question then jesus said let them go and draw some water draw some water with the water pot know what that could do is the same water it's the same water it's just have to obey and as they draw the water and they pour oh hallelujah the same word and poor come on now same books and poor because jesus said draw it this morning and poor and he going to turn your water into wine and wine is the stimulation of revelation with wine you can't sit down you can't sit still your hands have to do something your foot have to do something your elbow have to do something even your neck oh hallelujah but your body got to do something because wine brings us stimulation jesus turn water into wine he bypassed the grapes he bypassed the crushing of the grapes he bypassed the whole process so what you're worried about is anything too hard for the lord he could bypass your tumor and took it from the inside the tumor hiding that demon in life on the inside you could go behind it you were finished come on now come on now cancer over female condition over [Applause] god you let me see the goddess do some restraints inside job you know inside job you're calling now hallelujah moving on the inside oh that's a god be savory now oh hallelujah you see after a while you have to take note right now people taking notes write and write directly but afterwards they will take note that you have been with jesus a different kind of note you can't write that note you have to run and tell somebody that man have been with jesus because he is doing what jesus did are we ready for that are we ready for the same jesus the same jesus not another one you may be seated this same jesus in the old days in the 60s there's a preacher i felt like i'm in a hunchback you know 100 bucks they come back and reminded him turn around put his knee man back and boy jesus and people taught the man back break when they look the man back straight as ever now don't go and try that they've got their anointing these guys were not intimidated by no physical condition no wheelchair we get this opportunity to get people out when they see wheelchair they get excited when they say crutches they get excited when they see playing the fire in their eyes because the blind have to see because jesus is here and if jesus is here something got to take place is there believers in the house today [Applause] hallelujah oh you have to look at your conditions at your mountains at your obstacles at your hurdles you have to look at them as opportunities for god to come on the scene one gideon at one time say lord if if you'll be with me do this do that gideon take things for granted he said the lord be with us where are the miracles because god is a god of miracles but when people have money in the park yet they believe they're working miracles because they could pay to go to the doctor they don't need jesus until the money runs out but when you understand that we are promised a restoration of this miracle working god one time brother man said there was a place that was farming in the land no rain and a man had enough of it an old man he went in the middle of the street i like that not in his house and close the window in the middle of the street he went and said lord god has all frail hand raised up he says i serve you all these years send on rain he said i man people run because no rain was coming what god sent me into that prayer do you understand what we're talking about elijah said not even jew or rain will fall until i called for it it was i shut up heavens by my message i shut up the blessings by my message and only my work could unlock the presence of god you talk about power i want to know i'm not i want to feel a fire in your soul wanting this revival now you're gonna forgive me i am a revivalist in case you didn't know in case you didn't know t.o is a revivalist not a dennis not an intellectualist a revivalist i love revival i am a revival i will cause a revival we going to start a revival a prize revival a seven thunder revival a holy ghost revival this is the gift that god gave me this is the fire that god put in my soul you see any man could study for seven days and bring a lot of mysteries trump is violence woes plays woman his son plus israel gog on magog russia amen blood moons universe star certain mars lineup number nine and number six and number this are number three and number five and what can i turn keys with all of that and after all of that nothing happening it's just what i call verbal gymnastics flipping here and someone's sorting verbally but it's not causing the fire of faith to break upon your soul understand this understand if jesus got newsletters were sick jesus said the disciples are glad i'm not here he said let us hurry get a quick car took one get my friend lazarus come come let's pray for him he's some guy on that day news comes lazarus is dead so now the default is coffee and biscuit sad faces black wheels everybody in sad mode that's the default okay jesus went down to the funeral week only to hear testimony lord if you had not if it had been here my brother had not died hallelujah but then the sister said something a little more she said but even now [Applause] no no no no hear the thing if she had stopped it lord if i had nothing yeah my brother and i died and stop right there they bury him complete the burial and give lazarus a salute [Music] a good send-off but when she said even no [Music] even though cause a chain reaction even though activate faith and power [Applause] now watch the default atmosphere was there because the bible said the shortest two words in the bible is jesus wept so jesus finds himself in default also but when even knows okay even brought him out of the default of tears and weeping to say i am i am you have to watch what he's saying after that because he can be anything a man is dead he can't just say anything

morning [Applause] in the pentecostal age when fire struck the spending castle men shoot bullets on them and it falls we won't close like nothing they were bulletproof fire was on them and these are run them and people say look oh god look what they're going through but i'm saying no everywhere they go fire picking up god let people run them out at firebreaker they run them to that city next firebreaker they run them here and go to the light the devil never end up in in that kind of bubble mode because if he only knew what was happening he would tell him stay right there keep the fire right there don't keep it burning up but sit right there but god had them devils running the people and have to run them fire picking up here that's what we want inside of here let fire strike one sister in one pew and let them charm the other power let fire move from brother to brother from eagle to eagle oh god fire by prison fire fire fire fire fall on me do something for jesus you're calling for more than watching awareness do something for jesus you call for more than giving your husband to me and do something for jesus get on fire for god fire of god the people of israel when they came out they never knew about this fire moses met the fire they didn't when they saw moses and saw one just like them i won't even say trying to make yourself a prince over us you went and come back and you're trying to make yourself a prince over us you are one of us don't get too big for your breaches they didn't know that man met god there was no witness there was no evidence there was nothing to show the people that this man met god when moses went in the court of pharaoh the two million people was not there they were seen about saving the slave masters moses went into the court of pharaoh as all kings and kingdoms bring homage to pharaoh and bring gifts and tidings to pharaoh moses was in the lineup and the king of greece is here drums beat and they bring claude bring ivory bring gold because egypt was first world egypt was the modern city pharaoh was the man president of the whole world known well at that time so if you want to be good with pharaoh when you come before you can walk empty-handed you walk with gifts 110 commandment moses time come they say what kingdom do you represent they recognize him yet he said the kingdom of the most high god [Applause] when they're looking for gold and frankincense and clothing the man have a stick and on a message he said i have a message from my god and my message is let my people go pharaoh shall understand that man not speaking for himself when a man talk like that the man then saying you know our people is in your hands and i i come to tell you if you could release our people he didn't talk that he come and say let my people go that is the message my god give to you pharaoh say go away he said out of here i come for them i have come to go back and report to my god i can't bring them out because my god is great my god is mighty there is none like him in all the earth and if my god is with me there ain't no stopping me now oh give the lord a shelter praise come on now and when you understand come on now the power of your god we know the story moses played him and when moses finished with him so he said take your flock take your people you and your god everybody leave take them and go and i see the devil packing up shop because if he was the backside we're going already if he wants to give up we give up already this is 40 years of beer wood 40 years of rocket gospel and teaching and seed in our souls and we have the secret the secret is the word is in the bread we walk in with the secret now watch not in the right head in the bride's heart and the devil can't get there because your heart just failed god had that part hidden that scene you hidden the woman of the well she had a seat in her that was hidden she herself was not aware of what was inside of her she thought she was just ordinary she thought she was a normal one having this man and that man and that man until jesus come and bring the true mirror of the word and present him to her her true picture her true name her true glory a true calling a predestination her election and when she saw that she was convinced she was convinced and she ran and said come see a man who told me everything i needed to know now um how could somebody like that not love god you've been through hell you've been through torment you've been through humiliation you've been through rape what kind of condition and god come and cover you with his love wrap you with the blanket of his grace bless you with this righteousness how you could come and not worship him he redeemed you you have nothing to say but thanks and honor and praise and glory and blessings [Applause] i don't want a mash-up your people will like all the people will i don't want to burst your balloon balloon at your living room it is a balloon that will boost eventually but the thing of it is we are here really for the unknown glory of god and all what we do that is not for christ doesn't count the currency of heaven is not materialistic the currency of heaven is not cars and house and land and whatever that's not the currency of heaven that's why when jesus gets the power of the rich man and the poor man and the rich man in hell the rich man said oh tell my family don't come here we can't do that they have the prophets they have the word they have a choice you have a choice they're standing for well i'm a very quiet person i don't make no noise well you're looking for weeping or real international teeth yes you ever see somebody in trouble just make a lot of noise you know real troubling all who can't talk let a dog around them know they said that answer the dog with teeth on you the whole street will know what dog is after you everybody will know that's just human and not only that if you could only one one two one two but one two one one one one one two two you re the adrenaline god put adrenaline inside your system to help you with danger to run for your life you think i just talking like that i took from experience a dog was after me hi i was dunk something with all them healing steps man i was running by like seven steps at a time passed coming and trying small fella but that dog forget that i never run i think i outdo hundred meters oh dude recordings on such speed the dog was fierce the dog was coming for me and i didn't let him catch me i was running for my life and if the devil is behind you don't let him catch you keep on running run for your life glory hallelujah the passion to survive the passion to overcome the passion for breakthrough it has to strike you in such a powerful way that you cannot let anything stop you from your goals and from the vision that god put in your soul whatever god put your soul to believe you cannot [Applause] that is why a people that break out a group think are powerful people and that's why the devil's job is to keep people into group thing i'm a baptist group i'm a metalist group i'm an inventors group so they're covered by the group anointing and the group is what determines their vision their outlook their pictures there is no individual revelation that inspires them and notice how jesus he dealt with the disciples as individuals peter this what is that to thee followed me he dealt with them as individuals because they are when the group decided to do something when judas was hung himself the group decided to choose a man by lot and they pick up a man called matias matthias did nothing no book of matthias revolution matters prophet says just matters just fit in there like matthias baran said i was all human that was man's choice these people had the holy ghost and they choose a normal man that was going to have no testimony nothing because god choose paul to fit in that place there to be part of that number paul was the man that god chose so you see man have a way of you know using the eyes and seeing and whatnot we give them room for that but when god put his hand on you you didn't know what i said when god put his hands on you it is his hands come on now come on now that's why paul said this way nothing present nothing past nothing to come could separate me from the love of god that is in christ jesus not peril not sword not poverty not trials not testing not tribulation that's not group think that is revelation with that revelation you know your children will be delivered i don't care who they are right now i don't care what condition right now that is what challenging your faith because jesus didn't let lazarus death intimidate him blind bartimaeus didn't look look people tell black to me he cannot hear you blind you're blind but he cried out and and that crime brought a fit that knocked heaven's dawn and heaven why do you think men set up satellite satellite is high to send down signals and information and radar and different kind of things they satellite they needed high up there to send these signals all around the world right now that is the impersonation of what we have what do you mean by ovid but a branham was in south america a baby had died a woman heard about a baby race from the dead she didn't want to bury her baby she came to the service that day it had about two three thousand people with those people there she's trying to get to the platform she have a dead baby people came to what brother brown said brother brandon there's a woman longer given real trouble nobody could stop her she's passing through people's leg climbing over she's trying to get to the man of god somewhere on that platform of somebody that could give her back the life of her child she is battling with men only she's not asking permission please do you have a seat for me it have no seat it have no room everybody looking for a breakthrough and when everybody looking for the same thing is the desperate one [Applause] who's gonna get it [Applause] but obama said let somebody go down prefer because you don't know who i am they sent somebody down but woman's still backing true she battled to the point where she touched the satellite that is what in him our satellite her faith hit god and god touches prophet break a vision and you say send for that woman bring her up now that is when god could take it from the back and bring you in front i'm not hearing you you want to be shouting because you want to see that nobody could stop the fate in your soul from being confirmed from being answered from being vindicated listen that woman touch the satellite of god touch heaven soon heaven touch the prophet the brother and then that baby was raised from the dead who did that what did that what everyone say you know what too much are people here by going home and bearing my baby that's what's gonna happen she buried a baby but she was saying you know what my baby is mine baby is dead but i heard a dead baby was raised and the same god that raised that one could raise this one and i want that same god wherever that god is listen when reverend start to break out you talk about people lining up to try to come inside the church forget it you think that's not going to happen you better believe it john you will already prophesy i will restore all the years that the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust the palmer world i will restore my people gonna eat and be satisfied oh glory to god that's what we have been doing all these years ethan we are satisfied but the scripture didn't stop there he said it shall come to pass afterwards afterwards [Applause] i will pour out my spirit okay the lord shall praise his people this have nothing to do with some man from america some man from europe or south america africa this have to do with i will pour out my spirit i will return unto thee according to the time of life i will do it [Applause] so i want you you may be seated to free yourself from your past you've got to do that because you can't even correct the past you could repent of the past you can't change what the history of your life is your history is a record a record of your past but that pass doesn't determine your future your future is in god peter pass was fisherman peter pass was christened and swearing but that didn't determine his future to be a spokesman and a turner of the key to unlock the kingdom to the gentiles paul was a murderer he saw stephen stone as it was paul was fighting the church but his past didn't determine his future murder but moses was a murderer as it was he killed a man but his past didn't determine his future your past doesn't determine your future don't let your mind bind you to your past [Applause] glory don't let your mind bind you to your past oh glory to god a crook of this or whatever that's your past that doesn't mean that's going to be your future i will restore saith the lord oh glory to god and god is restoring god is about to restore the challenging thing or the amazing thing is that god is restoring right in the all of judgment you see when moses when noah was waiting for the water to raise his ark the same water he was written for was going to judge the world the same spirit that we are looking for and asking for will produce a judgment to anas and sapphira reproduce judgment tax fight in the church will produce a judgment that begins in the house of god that same spirit that we are looking for that same spirit that we are expecting it coming in a time of judgment cause judgment is fire fire fire going to come the fire of judgment the day the great and terrible day of the lord it's coming there is where when jesus went to the temple and found where it was written in the book of isaiah he left the part out he said the spirit is upon me to bring good titans to heal the sick to raise the dead to do all of that but then the party left out was to declare the day of vengeance of our god and that day of vengeance is for the bride mrs jesus will come to the temple mrs jesus will pick up the scripture right in the day of judgment and revelation 2 17 will be the voice of grace and the spirit and the bride say come whosoever will come drink of the water of life freely god gonna be failing the pride god gonna be unveiled [Applause] listen to this god will be unveiled again and before he's unveiled he has to be healed hide himself literally hide himself in you do you think daniel know he had all that power hidden in him that power was unveiled when there's so many lions then no wasn't wasn't the lion who had breakfast lunch and dinner you it was hungry lions lions who had the appetite right for eaten they teach sharp razor sharp they waiting for food and when the lions see that you're coming down they say food reach until god send fire and lion interfere with fire around food so you see there is power in sons power in daughters ready to be released in the hour amidst the challenge amidst the judgment amidst the fear because fear going to strike you know oh yes los angeles about to sink because the prophet saw it a prophet spoke it a prophet said there is a vision america bummed up in smoke before the coming of the lord the prophet saw russia sending a missile to bomb the vatican saw it the prophets prophesied and predicted they see it it's a vision and when they come back they say thus see the lord god gave roma space to repent refuse to repent kill two million people through the dark ages as if god gonna forget that but in the revelation of the spirit and the mystery of god the seed went down in the ground and god finds martin luther a catholic break upon him that just shall live by faith and that's the bit of the protestant but god didn't stop there it was the restoration of the cankerworm the catawome the palmer woman the caterpillar he bought luther then he bought wesley luther in germany western england and got the pentecost in america and then god sent a prophet to bring the word with the restoration of the word brings the restoration of power no word no power because the word is god and the word was lost so before power could come back he had to restore the world towards the restoration of the word and the word brings the fate so before the faith could come the word had to be restored so god said i will restore all what they eat them oh what the trash all with the pack-up shop i'm gonna bring it right back the church gonna get the correct template the church gonna get the correct vision he said write the vision and make it plain the vision has to be spoken the vision has to be written you're not coming here as how you feel you coming to fit into god's program i am not preaching my opinion i am preaching a message that prepares us for revival [Applause] understand this understand this jesus have to come among us [Applause] [Music] before the rapture you just don't go when rapture you got the same way you're going wrapped i'm going to meet him in the air you'll sing that in the trick to the tribulation before you go in the air jesus have to be amongst the people in spirit form brother branham said it is with him moving in and out and then we are worshiping the living christ not some man believe in christ him moving in and out oh hallelujah oh glory to god oh one man came to jesus lord my daughter's sick somebody come and say do you bother with him she's dead and jesus said i go weaker what vision what power give him the authority to go past the shells of debt and condition and ref like if it's not there jesus is doing this like he's not here but she's not cheating he's sleeping so in god's intelligence and mind debt is like sleep i go to wake her but first let's create the atmosphere let's get the unbelievable get them out get them or get them or get them out let's create an atmosphere i only want james and john or whoever just the believers just the disciples just the people that create and support the atmosphere of faith and power then he said little lady arise give her something to eat and then he walk out now to him that's no miracle now to the other that's a miracle to him is what sons do so after a while it becomes normal lane hunter's sick after a while becomes normal cast no devils and if you say you cast up by the thing of god cast out devils by finger of god cast the devil by god's finger what could you call inside doing my bells above god cast him by the finger things of god cast no devils oh my god could we give us some praises tonight so let's go over something if my people come by they shall humble themselves and pray a lot of people don't pray because they're not humbling themselves every day they go in the power of their might their strength their ability their job their salary their pay whatever but friends the time has come for us to humble ourselves god i am nothing without you i am dependent upon you oh hallelujah humble themselves and pray and then turn from their wicked ways it means challenge your default condition your default position there are some people who don't argue this is how i am but that is how you gonna will be this is how you always know it and today something you know peter peter's wife didn't make breakfast on time we didn't know food or whatever it is and peter didn't abuse her and rough her and carry on peter went upstairs and pray i don't know what going down there i do not have peter or ruffin peter or whatever i i don't know but in praying a vision broke so he broke into the spirit now what if he had qualified the food he nothing spirit no vision coming peter sitting with a hard face in the porch waiting for his wife to serve him breakfast then the scriptures now hope that sing deep i hope that is very good because what i'm saying there no food given opportunity [Music] [Applause] husband's in the house okay right right right right no something like that better than yours but i know for these sisters they're there for the brothers so peter get the opportunity to pray and in praying he break into the spirit and saw a vision to kill these animals that they don't eat god said go and kill and eat he said but damn thing unclean he said don't say what clean unclean what god goku show him to continuously issue animals in a language that he understand because they don't eat certain things and god show them go and eat that so the language speaks to peter don't talk that talk your default is don't eat that that's your default i want you to break out of your default i want to challenge how you think what you see who you see and how you deal with people not like you come until somebody say a bigger man you see you can be comfortable with people at your level just like you think like you in your environment and peter was being challenged don't even talk that because i'm going to carry it to people you don't know so peter has led my vision to continuous house in the meantime cornelius not a mean man not a stingy man not a hard man but a man freely giving arms freely helping people he was not selfish rascal no he was genuine in what he was about and he wasn't even a jew come on now see him as somebody he wasn't in the covenant of israel he was just an ordinary man and the bible hold a memorial for that man for his spirit for his attitude for his behavior come on shame and somebody and why he is praying god tell him go and send for peter now that is an example of what's going to happen in the future people will send for you they don't believe it isaac you you're like that amen you see again your default is you are ready yet say amen they're going to send for you if you already know you'll be ready then [Applause] they will send [Applause] they're not going by anybody who that got to answer their prayers why waste your time go down and send that one prayer not that one prayer that one prayer it's you so you want to operation you want me some doctor want to practice name practice and somebody else some new intune want to operate on your heart say i want to take that job no i want somebody to agree here who have done a million of those jobs who got caught inside without you looking you know where your hands going that's what you want that way you have to have rugged men rugged men trained not in theology but in the fire and the experience of god that is the kind of man that we talking about glory to god when elijah coming down to the river jordan let's just say river why you're so high no you take the man just hit it and you ever know what to do do you ever say i want to make a wave it's past elijah want to pass not a wave a river he hit the water river open up to give that man room to pass these guys are power over nature power over water that might just walk on the water normal man can walk on water but jesus did it and peter did it too without the holy ghost so you could walk on your water walk in situations that nobody expect you to nobody expect you [Applause] everybody expecting to sink in your situation they're looking for the sink they come like paul paul gets shipwrecked paulding crying below god i'm a prophet of god how dare i get shipwrecked this is not supposed to be no these men were real godly men they got shipwrecked this ship wrecked what you do you have to send me a

whatnot monday astonished the man shake off a snake shake this single skill but there's power in him [Music] [Applause] and when your enemies looking through the die come on now come on when they're looking for the farther back uh when they're counting you down because they're expected to conquer oh ah we're going to shake it off sing it all off your path shake off the snake shake off your sickness shake it off [Applause] don't let nobody come to you out or count you down if god count you down that's different one time god tell a man listen pack up shirt your time is up and that man turn to god and say god i've served you all these years i need more time and god give him more time oh give the lord some praise these people so god could give an extension and if god could give an ordinary man extension what about a health extension extension of some leave extension of breakthrough oh my god one time joshua fighting and he coined the sun going down and joshua said oh god i want a holiday tomorrow if i did suddenly go down i had to fight tomorrow and he could take a break son stand still but i want to finish off this battle and the sun stay right where it's supposed to be to shine light for joshua to deal with the enemy and i am telling you let's finish this battle this morning come on say him and somebody we need a revival we want a revival we are praying for revival oh glory glory hallelujah could somebody give the lord a shout glory glory glory praise god hallelujah hallelujah listen to this i checked something out what is fire made out of you know that fire generates heat and light but have you ever wondered what it's made out of here's a look at the chemical composition of fire fire is the result of a chemical reaction called combustion at a certain point in the combustion reaction called the ignition point flames are produced oh hallelujah flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide vapor water oxygen and nitrogen fire emits heat and light in order for combustion and fire to occur three things must be present fuel oxygen and energy usually in the form of heat we need those three things oh hallelujah hallelujah we need the word we need sanctification and we need worship you put that together it creates an ignition point come on now come on now don't don't sleep on me no don't back up you have to go right with me now ride with me now because jesus open the understanding so they get the first component which is the word oh hallelujah then afterwards they went in the upper room and what they were doing they were creating an atmosphere by worshiping and praising god continually in a sanctified condition we need a tree sanctified the word open to you and praise and worship and when you come and you start to praise and worship it gets so hot it takes 10 days but i'm saying mary had us to lose her dignity marriage was a loser pride because she was pride proud of having jesus i am the mother of jesus oh my sister mary had a little chip on her shoulder because she was the mother of jesus she had to lose that she had to lose that so much that she has to begin to see she is just as the same mary magdalene she have to see herself at the same level like mary even you marry i marry i make jesus you make problems and trouble but um we are the same level we are daughters of god yes yes yes we are daughters of god so america say i am mary and you and you are mary no it's not like that it's both mary's and i'm saying we are all sons and daughters of the living god not no higher one and lower one and this one no no no we are sons and daughters of the living god so it take ten days for pride to come out ten days for jealousy remember the mother came with two sons and says master oh hallelujah could you put one on my left and one on my right one woman came and asked could you put one son on the left and one on the right isn't that right well all them was in the upper room too they had to lose all that pride all that kind of thing like that until what happened begin to worship the atmosphere that'll be created and what happened they come to an ignition point and then tongues of fire light upon them and they were all filled with the holy ghost they break out to that combustion they break out to that inspiration they break to that ignition point and that is what desperation does it breaks you to our ignition point where fire have to make an appearance fire to come down glory have to come down the witness of the spirit have to come long healing have to come long deliverance have to come down picture of to come down how many want that and what will you do to start a revival i'm bout to wrap up oh glory to god and the bible went and said oh god is it consuming fire isn't that right god want the word to be consumed that's why ibrahim put on the altar i see the wood but where is the fire i see the wood but where's the fire core will provide himself a sacrifice god like the sacrifice that is consumed by fire fire is a witness of god let the court answer by fire let him be god because our god is a consuming fire i like the word consuming it burns everything out it burns until there is nothing more to burn when fire start to move nothing stops it it keeps burning until there is nothing else to consume that's a fire and when the fire of god begins to move the church is ready to be purified the church is ready to get the purifier failed in the sons and daughters of the living god oh hallelujah i have an entire message here you know but i'm not going by that i'm going by what is called sitting upon me right now hallelujah because i know this here is a new year i know there's a different day i know that different emphasis and you have to create the atmosphere you have to be convinced that you have to bring a revival you have to be convinced that you have to break to the ignition point understand this what abandonment said when the people of god go to calling on god there'll be a national showdown so i have for years i have been looking for the sign of the burden of prayer to come upon the people and i have not seen that because i know god let's go just gonna come down it didn't happen in the upper room it didn't happen any days of old there was a prayer prepared jesus couldn't just land in jerusalem and say i am here there was a way prepared for him to come and when the pillar fire came down in this age the voice said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you have a message that was sent to for around his second coming so the message itself is a message of preparation for the holy ghost capstone manifestation to come among god's people the capstone cannot come our knowledge is too wide it's got to come onto a call-out bunch fitted in the holy spirit slot that is what the whole ego is coming to connect with so we have got to get in the spirit of the coming of the lord the homosexual in the spirit to vindicate sodom and gomorrah america is finished america is finished as a world power they're about to be sentenced and judged russia is finding its place they already advanced in weapons and technology they are in position already what about the bride and the thing about it nothing can move externally until the bride get that movement let me challenge you to hear it bro says what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness when the press come down the bride will be pressed how many knows that the pride will be a hundred percent group how many knows that how many know they were close on the churches how many knows they're going to say we have to shut down [Applause] because the prophet saw it and we're going to be in places in homes they're going to convert the church in the warehouses he said in america he saw it oh hallelujah but then when the press come down judgments hit in the earth a bride anointed with power to preach to the doomed to preach the people who cannot be saved one message to preach listen to this i'm going to close ah noah preach 120 years bill and anak before he even put the first wood he was preaching because gore gave him a message evidence of his belief and faith in the message was the building of the ark every year the act going higher taller getting more constructed it took a hundred and twenty years the people laughed because the wood was soft wood that would sink the people laughed because there was no water to float the boat in he built it on land building a mountain as it was and there's no way it could float or whatever it is they had their jokes they had their mockery isn't that right i know a preacher come into the ark come into the ark get into the ark of safety act is now complete people still laughing threatened partying and so on then god tell noah let the animals come in two by two the people seeing animals going peers going in the ark no humans despairs no faith is about to save only his family they are going to be in the ark he is preaching then the bible said and god shut the door and the door that god shot no man can open the god the door that god opened no man could shut but god shut no in no tell his children it wouldn't rain they said daddy are you sure he said tomorrow is gonna rain next day no rain people give a big laugh they say look at noah all them animals all those peers are animals family doors shut the axe stood there for seven days preaching noah was no longer the voice the ark has become the voice the act was speaking on behalf of noah the act was no a witness of truth and righteousness the act was shut if somebody wanted to come then there was no room the door was shut no i couldn't open the door for them the chance was missed it was over it was finished for the entire world and all of a sudden after seven days the sky turned black it was god's judgment about the four the rain began to fall 24 hours 48 hours 40 days 49 rain and more rain the people heading towards the ark let us in noah couldn't open it because he didn't shut it he was only instructed to build it according to specification and before the final closure god tell him to pitch and seal the ark you see they laugh at the soft wood and that's how we have to become soft and pliable that the spirit could seal all the holes in our lives what they didn't know the wood was soft and chosen by god because god was bringing a fresh revelation how to seal it and pitch was going to seal all the pores to make the ark waterproof he sealed it on the inside and sealing the outside and when god finished sealing you you'll be sealed on the inside and sealed on the outside the devil will have no room no place to get to you you'll be sealed in and the devil sealed out could we give the lord some praises and the rain fell and the rain fell and as the people were drowning and being judged the ark was getting ready to float the same water that drone the people is what floated the ark the same spirit we preach about is what will judge this world be careful get him before the door is shut because one of these days the door gonna be shut and the bride will be preaching to the eternal lost people that cannot be saved and they will have to hear the word they will have to see signs and wonders and miracles and they cannot touch it come you should come up
