[10:59] and amen and amen greetings church it's
[11:02] really a great privilege and an honor to
[11:04] be here tonight
[11:05] uh i feel i'm behind a wheel that i
[11:08] haven't driven in some time
[11:10] um as we have navigated this this
[11:14] new normal and all of these
[11:15] uncertainties and these
[11:17] ups and downs and these these different
[11:19] things that are happening around us in
[11:20] the different realms
[11:22] um that they're supposed to happen in
[11:24] and we also have our realm that we are
[11:26] supposed to live in and dwell in and
[11:28] take inspiration from
[11:30] and we are not supposed to let uh what
[11:33] is happening in these
[11:34] other realms the financial realm the
[11:36] echo the ecclesiastical realm the
[11:38] governmental realms and
[11:40] you know we come from another kingdom we
[11:42] come from another world we come from
[11:44] another
[11:45] time zone as it were so what pulses us
[11:48] so what excites us so what
[11:49] interests us is completely different so
[11:53] i really want to salute berovid for the
[11:55] bible studies
[11:56] um that uh over the last few weeks
[12:00] and um i'm here tonight by the grace of
[12:02] god to
[12:03] sort of kind of you know share a little
[12:06] thought with you
[12:07] from the scriptures and i pray that it
[12:09] will be a blessing
[12:11] uh to you tonight so
[12:15] uh trust everybody had a wonderful day
[12:18] and that you had the devil running
[12:19] you had the devil talking and bobbing
[12:22] and weaving
[12:23] i pray that you were not the one ducking
[12:24] and bobbing and weaving but you had the
[12:26] enemy
[12:27] ducking bobbing and weaving you know so
[12:29] yes we ought to be on
[12:31] on the offensive you know if you're on
[12:32] the offensive you know then the devil is
[12:34] always on your run
[12:35] you know the bible said resist the devil
[12:37] and he will flee from
[12:38] free from us you know so i want to thank
[12:40] everyone for making it out tonight
[12:42] and looking for a little time in the
[12:44] lord
[12:45] so i want to start with a little
[12:47] introduction um
[12:49] before i get to my thought tonight and i
[12:51] want to start
[12:52] with paul and uh paul
[12:55] is you know when you agree to the
[12:57] scripture and we talked about it
[12:59] that sometimes when you slow down as it
[13:01] will and you read you start to see
[13:02] things you see
[13:04] more things and i see more things and i
[13:05] see more things and i really find paul
[13:08] to be
[13:08] really a tremendous tremendous study you
[13:11] know so
[13:12] i kind of wrote some things down i just
[13:14] want to kind of read
[13:15] what i wrote before i get to my actual
[13:18] um focus tonight so paul and this is how
[13:22] i wrote it paul
[13:24] formerly known as saul you know
[13:27] and all of us we have a formerly known
[13:30] as
[13:31] you know is this former us and there's
[13:34] this this
[13:35] newer version of us so i like that paul
[13:38] formerly known as saul
[13:40] a pharisee of pharisees
[13:43] an academic a man of conviction
[13:47] a man willing to kill for what he
[13:50] believed
[13:52] a man who would orchestrate the killing
[13:55] of stephen a deacon
[13:58] his passion to defend the law of moses
[14:01] and his lack of a personal experience
[14:04] with god
[14:06] made him both a weapon of the law
[14:09] and an enemy of the followers of jesus
[14:14] his studies under gamaliel had armed him
[14:18] with wisdom
[14:19] and understanding that blinded him to
[14:22] the truth
[14:23] that the lord jesus christ was the
[14:25] messiah
[14:27] against this backdrop and
[14:30] without his knowledge or his consent
[14:35] so i want to say that again against his
[14:37] backdrop
[14:38] and without his knowledge or consent
[14:42] he would have been chosen as a star
[14:46] in the right hand of god one of only
[14:49] seven stars
[14:51] and the reality is without your
[14:53] knowledge
[14:54] and without your consent we have been
[14:57] chosen
[14:58] by god so here is this man
[15:02] called paul formerly known saul
[15:05] without his knowledge or consent he will
[15:08] be chosen as a star in your right hand
[15:10] of god
[15:10] one of only seven stars a messenger to
[15:14] the gentiles
[15:16] a messenger to the first church age
[15:19] the apostle who would have the audacity
[15:22] to withstand peter on doctrine
[15:25] and become known for his many letters
[15:28] to many churches but the branham would
[15:31] refer to paul
[15:32] as the gold standard in other words the
[15:35] plum line
[15:36] against which every messenger that would
[15:39] follow
[15:40] would be measured against brother
[15:42] branham would rejoice with the
[15:44] comfort of knowing that he preached
[15:48] what paul preached a lot could be said
[15:52] about paul
[15:53] but interestingly he is not our focus
[15:57] tonight biblical
[16:00] scholars in studying paul's journeys
[16:03] and his timeline have worked very hard
[16:07] to figure out
[16:08] which of paul's letters was the last one
[16:11] that he wrote
[16:13] i preached a message some time ago about
[16:16] the last words
[16:17] of the great warrior joshua last words
[16:21] are very important
[16:23] they have very special meaning
[16:25] especially or more so
[16:27] when you know that they that they may be
[16:30] your last words
[16:32] paul would write to the ephesians paul
[16:35] would write
[16:36] to the colossians paul would write to a
[16:39] galatians paul would write to philemon
[16:42] paul would write to timothy paul will
[16:45] write
[16:46] to titus paul the right to the hebrews
[16:49] paul will write to the romans
[16:52] paul will write to the thessalonians
[16:55] paul will write to the corinthians and
[16:58] paul will also write
[17:00] to the philippians careful research
[17:03] would indicate that from
[17:05] all appearances paul's
[17:08] last letter would more than likely
[17:11] be written to timothy
[17:16] for in second timothy 4 6 to 7
[17:20] we find paul saying for i am now ready
[17:24] to be offered the time of my departure
[17:29] is at hand i have fought a fight
[17:33] i fought a good fight i have finished
[17:36] my course i have kept defeat
[17:40] paul didn't have any family that had all
[17:44] been forsaken for the gospel
[17:46] so he called timothy his son his beloved
[17:50] son
[17:51] in second timothy 1 6 he would reference
[17:53] he
[17:54] began the good work in timothy by the
[17:56] laying
[17:57] on of hands had seen a lot of
[18:01] battles a lot of beatings and trouble
[18:04] from the
[18:05] first day he actually met paul paul
[18:08] would encourage timothy to endure
[18:11] hardness hardness
[18:14] and and by now you know where i'm at my
[18:18] thought tonight or bible study tonight
[18:20] is
[18:21] lessons from timothy part one i know i
[18:24] spoke about
[18:26] a study of daniel part one and i haven't
[18:28] gone to part two
[18:29] i'm just doing what i'm inspired to do
[18:31] so tonight is lessons of timothy part
[18:34] one
[18:35] because i know just as daniel have a
[18:37] part two to come this will have a part
[18:38] two to come
[18:39] so timothy had seen many battles many
[18:42] beatings
[18:43] and trouble since the first day he met
[18:46] paul
[18:47] paul encouraged him to endure hardness
[18:50] are you willing to endure hardness
[18:54] it's not easy to endure hardness you
[18:56] know but imagine your message
[18:58] of paul to timothy is to endure hardness
[19:01] strive for mastery strive lawfully
[19:06] suffer for christ rightly divide the
[19:11] word
[19:12] flee youthful desires seek
[19:16] righteousness faith love
[19:20] and peace and to avoid foolish
[19:23] questions there's such a thing as
[19:26] foolish questions and be gentle what
[19:29] exhortation from this great apostle paul
[19:33] to this young man named timothy
[19:38] so who is timothy brother branham said
[19:41] he would be known as the first
[19:43] bishop the first pastor of the ephesians
[19:46] church at ephesus
[19:48] so when we talk about back to ephesians
[19:51] and another ephesians
[19:53] then it means we we are we are trying to
[19:55] parallel
[19:56] against the leadership and a time when
[20:00] you'll have timothy was was was the
[20:02] first pastor of ephesians
[20:04] so we have to look at this timothy where
[20:06] he comes from where he going
[20:08] what was his connection what was his
[20:09] nature his attributes
[20:11] how he operated and most interestingly
[20:14] what would paul
[20:15] share with this young man who would
[20:17] become the first pastor of this great
[20:19] church at ephesus
[20:22] so let's go a little deeper i trust that
[20:23] you're riding with me tonight oh
[20:25] encouragement a little inspiration
[20:28] timothy was from the
[20:29] lyconian city of lystra in asia minor
[20:34] born of a jewish mother who was a
[20:37] believer and
[20:38] a greek father we'll talk a little bit
[20:41] about that in a little bit
[20:43] paul would meet him on his second
[20:45] missionary journey
[20:48] and he will become paul's companion and
[20:50] co-worker
[20:51] along with silas the new testament
[20:56] indicates that timothy traveled with
[20:58] paul
[20:59] and paul was his mentor and paul
[21:01] entrusted him
[21:03] with very important assignments
[21:06] let us start to talk about timothy and
[21:08] then we're going to get we are building
[21:09] a background to get to the scripture
[21:12] timothy didn't come from the right
[21:14] background
[21:16] within the context of what paul was
[21:18] trying to achieve
[21:20] and paul's own struggle with the
[21:22] hierarchy in jerusalem
[21:24] and his ministry to the gentiles his
[21:27] desire to take
[21:29] timothy under his wings came with
[21:32] certain issues
[21:33] because timothy would have been from two
[21:36] lines so to speak he was neither fully
[21:38] jew
[21:39] nor fully greek because his mother was a
[21:42] jew
[21:43] and his father was a greek you could
[21:45] find timothy
[21:46] all through the new testament in fact in
[21:48] acts
[21:49] chapter 16 and verse 1 if you
[21:52] have your bible you could find it acts
[21:54] 61 he says then came he
[21:56] to derby and lystra and behold a certain
[22:00] disciple
[22:00] was there named timotheus that's timothy
[22:04] the son of a certain woman which was a
[22:06] jewish
[22:07] and believed but you see whenever the
[22:10] bible talks about
[22:11] but it creates it creates this issue in
[22:14] scripture
[22:15] but his father was a greek so the fact
[22:18] that is being placed there meant
[22:20] this was actually being perceived as
[22:22] somewhat of an issue
[22:24] all right so again acts 16 and verse 1
[22:28] so a lot of people who look at the book
[22:30] of timothy see timothy as first timothy
[22:32] second timothy but we're gonna find
[22:33] timothy
[22:34] all to the new testament all right then
[22:36] came he to derby and list from behold
[22:38] a certain disciple was there named
[22:40] timotheus the son of a certain woman
[22:44] she is described as a certain woman here
[22:46] but paul would later
[22:47] even call her by name because he that's
[22:50] how close he was to this young man named
[22:52] timothy
[22:53] a certain woman which was a jewish and
[22:55] believer
[22:56] but his father was a greek which was
[22:59] well reported of by the brethren in
[23:01] other words
[23:02] when paul got there and looked at it
[23:06] everybody had a good report about this
[23:08] young man named timothy
[23:10] could it be said about you that there's
[23:12] a good report about you
[23:15] so which was well reported of by the
[23:18] brethren that were at lystra and iconium
[23:21] him speaking about timothy would paul
[23:23] have to go with him
[23:25] who fought with him and took listen
[23:27] carefully
[23:28] and circumcise him because of the jews
[23:31] which were in those quarters now if you
[23:34] recall the debates between
[23:36] paul and peter it was about what would
[23:39] be
[23:39] the the gentiles adhering to the laws
[23:43] so here it is because in in i believe it
[23:46] was paul
[23:46] i think titus or one of those he he he
[23:49] had others who he didn't even force the
[23:51] issue of circumcision
[23:53] but with timothy him would paul have to
[23:55] go with him
[23:56] and took and circumcise him not because
[23:59] of the law
[24:00] but because of the jews which were in
[24:02] those quarters well listen
[24:04] for they knew all that his father was a
[24:07] greek
[24:09] so i'm showing here now the wisdom of
[24:11] paul
[24:12] that because of the role that timothy
[24:15] would have to play
[24:16] to cover his bases so to speak not
[24:18] because of the law
[24:19] but because he understood his audience
[24:22] he understood who timothy would in time
[24:25] have to interact with
[24:27] he understood what timothy's ministry
[24:29] would become
[24:30] even before timothy himself knew where
[24:32] he was going
[24:34] such an example from paul and this
[24:36] principle
[24:37] we will find in 1st corinthians 9
[24:39] because this is
[24:40] paul's thinking and it really helps us
[24:42] elevate our thinking
[24:44] to higher thinking first corinthians 9
[24:46] verse 19 says for though i be free from
[24:49] all men
[24:50] yet have i made myself servant unto all
[24:53] that i might gain them more
[24:55] so instead of paul saying boy timothy
[24:58] you don't need to be circumcised you
[24:59] know let me just forget everybody
[25:01] but paul is exercising a higher wisdom
[25:04] because it's more
[25:05] expedient to do so so first corinthians
[25:07] 9
[25:08] 20 and unto the jews i became as a jew
[25:11] that i might gain the jews to them that
[25:13] are under the law
[25:14] as under the law that i might gain them
[25:17] that are under the law
[25:18] that them are without the law as without
[25:20] law being not without law to god but
[25:22] under the law to christ
[25:24] that i might gain them that are without
[25:26] law so the week became i as weak
[25:28] that i might gain the weak i am made all
[25:31] things to all men
[25:33] that by all means i might save some
[25:36] so this is a underlying principle that
[25:38] paul
[25:39] operates with so in taking timothy under
[25:42] his wings
[25:44] we see that paul is positioning timothy
[25:47] a certain way
[25:48] for what his ministry will be but it
[25:51] also underscores
[25:52] that timothy's lineage the fact that
[25:56] his father was not in church
[25:59] did not stop what god's purpose was in
[26:02] his life
[26:03] and even deeper it shows that timothy
[26:06] now is making a decision
[26:07] that has nothing to do with when my
[26:09] father is a greek and this is how i was
[26:11] raised
[26:11] he is being persuaded by a higher
[26:14] calling
[26:14] and he's abandoning principles and
[26:16] making a choice to follow after
[26:18] something that is greater trust this is
[26:20] helping somebody this evening
[26:23] i want to go a little deeper here paul
[26:26] would now
[26:27] reference the fact that timothy didn't
[26:30] even have a spiritual father figure as
[26:32] it were
[26:34] because timothy father is an unbeliever
[26:37] i want i want to bring the context
[26:39] to show that it is about choice as well
[26:43] leaving his mother and grandmother the
[26:45] responsibility of raising timothy in the
[26:48] ways of god
[26:50] and we will go back over this again
[26:53] because it's worth reading this but
[26:55] second timothy verse second timothy 1
[26:59] 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ
[27:02] by the will of god not by his own will
[27:05] so second timothy one verse one paul an
[27:08] apostle of jesus christ
[27:10] by the will of god according to the
[27:12] promise of
[27:13] life which is in christ jesus to timothy
[27:16] my dearly beloved son
[27:19] grace mercy and peace
[27:22] from god the father and christ jesus our
[27:25] lord
[27:26] listen to how paul is expressing himself
[27:29] now
[27:29] notice this in all likelihood is the
[27:31] very last time
[27:32] that paul is writing i turn god who
[27:35] myself from my forefathers
[27:37] with pure conscience that without
[27:40] ceasing i have
[27:41] remembrance of thee in my prayers night
[27:44] and day
[27:45] greatly desiring to see thee
[27:48] being mindful of thy tears that i may be
[27:51] filled with joy and listen to what he is
[27:54] remembering as well
[27:56] when i call to remembrance rebuilding a
[27:58] background
[27:59] when i call to remembrance the unfined
[28:02] fate
[28:03] that is in thee which dwelled first in
[28:06] thy grandmother
[28:08] lois and thy mother eunice this certain
[28:11] woman
[28:12] eunice that i am persuaded that envy
[28:15] also so i want
[28:19] to draw reference here to
[28:23] you mothers and your grandmothers to
[28:26] never underestimate the power of your
[28:30] faith
[28:31] and of your prayer because you have
[28:34] no idea how the seed of your prayer and
[28:38] your feet
[28:39] can be manifested in the right time and
[28:41] in the right
[28:42] season don't underestimate it
[28:47] everybody with me tonight can the church
[28:49] say man
[28:50] so without timothy having a father
[28:52] figure and there are many
[28:53] and we live in a messed up world now
[28:56] where we say
[28:57] men have lost their place in society
[29:00] there's a difference between being
[29:02] male and being a man you could have the
[29:05] gender
[29:06] but being a man is more than being male
[29:09] having a child is different from being a
[29:11] father
[29:12] but yet you have timothy as it were
[29:15] going against the odds there are many
[29:17] people who say well
[29:18] because i didn't have a role model or
[29:20] because i didn't have a father figure
[29:22] or because my father wasn't in church
[29:24] and and they
[29:25] they stack all of these excuses of why
[29:28] they can't do certain things
[29:30] here is young timothy whose father is
[29:33] not in church
[29:34] father is not a believer being raised by
[29:37] his mother
[29:37] and his grandmother as it were but he
[29:40] still makes a
[29:41] choice a decision to take responsibility
[29:45] for his spiritual life i want us to to
[29:47] just meditate on that a little bit
[29:49] and maybe it'll help somebody to look at
[29:52] themselves and say there really is
[29:54] no excuse all right i want to encourage
[29:56] you just say there is no excuse
[29:58] i want you to say there is no excuse
[30:02] i challenge people all the time for
[30:04] every person
[30:05] who says because of this i couldn't do
[30:08] because of this
[30:09] i don't have because of this i can't
[30:11] achieve
[30:12] there is somebody else with that same
[30:14] limitation
[30:15] who has gone on to do who has gone on to
[30:18] achieve
[30:18] who has gone on to acquire whatever it
[30:20] is and it comes back to a firm
[30:23] determination to do to achieve to see it
[30:26] acquire
[30:26] and it really has nothing to do with
[30:29] your heritage or where you come from but
[30:31] it's about
[30:32] making the decisions and the conscious
[30:35] actions to do
[30:36] something about the present and about
[30:38] the future i
[30:39] underscore tonight there is nothing we
[30:41] could do to change the past
[30:43] there is nothing we can do to change
[30:45] yesterday there's nothing we do
[30:47] to change an hour ago there's nothing
[30:50] but what happens
[30:51] now and from now on is actually within
[30:54] your hands
[30:55] and the decisions you make is what
[30:57] determines the outcome
[30:59] of your life whatever it is you want to
[31:02] achieve in life it comes down to you
[31:05] making a decision can the church
[31:08] say amen so i'm building a background of
[31:11] this
[31:11] young man timothy to to try to figure
[31:14] out
[31:15] what would have built up this situation
[31:17] all right
[31:18] so paul in
[31:21] instructing timothy so i'm saying a few
[31:24] things
[31:26] would encourage him to avoid temptation
[31:30] in first timothy 6 and verse 20
[31:33] you say ultimately keep that
[31:36] which is committed to thy trust in
[31:40] in other words you have a responsibility
[31:43] to keep that which is committed to thy
[31:46] trust
[31:47] and and look how he is to keep it
[31:51] avoiding profane and vain
[31:54] babbling you see many times for us
[31:58] our trouble isn't what we're saying our
[32:01] trouble isn't our conversations
[32:03] but the brandon would reference that he
[32:05] had somebody in his car one time who
[32:07] spoke a blue streak in other words you
[32:10] could
[32:10] leave service feeling so great and
[32:13] somebody
[32:14] says something to you that just deflate
[32:16] you
[32:18] or you could leave feeling inspired
[32:19] tonight and you get involved in a
[32:22] you know you know in a political debate
[32:24] you get involved in an
[32:25] argument about the coronavirus and
[32:27] before you know it
[32:29] all of the annoying thing that is being
[32:31] built up because
[32:32] in the world gets destroyed because
[32:34] you're into profane
[32:35] and vain battling so
[32:39] ultimately keep that which is committed
[32:41] to thy
[32:42] trust so tonight you're being given
[32:44] stuff you're being it's been committed
[32:46] to your trust
[32:47] god is trusting you with his word he's
[32:49] trusting you with this tonight
[32:51] and and and he wants you to be committed
[32:53] avoiding profane and vain babblings
[32:56] and oppositions of science falsely
[33:00] so-called
[33:00] in other words there are certain
[33:02] conversations you should never be in
[33:04] there are certain debates you should
[33:06] never be in and that's the challenge
[33:08] with
[33:09] many young people today they end up in
[33:11] conversations about god and about this
[33:13] and about this and before they know it
[33:15] and i'm so messed up
[33:16] so paul is warning timothy don't find
[33:18] yourself in them conversations
[33:20] and don't and don't try to get in a
[33:21] scientific debate about these kind of
[33:23] things
[33:24] which some in verse 21 professing have
[33:27] heard
[33:27] according to defeat can the church say
[33:30] amen
[33:32] so paul is instructing the same timothy
[33:34] to avoid
[33:35] conversations and controversies so that
[33:38] he would not be tempted
[33:40] to buy into into false knowledge and
[33:42] false
[33:43] ideas and false explanations and false
[33:46] interpretations
[33:47] can the church say man building still
[33:51] we're going to get to our reading in
[33:52] a short while we his exact age is not
[33:57] given
[33:58] but we know that paul had to encourage
[34:00] timothy
[34:02] to not allow others to look down upon
[34:04] him for his
[34:06] age as he would bring reform to the
[34:08] church in ephesus
[34:10] we would see in first timothy 4 and
[34:12] verse 12
[34:14] paul would say to timothy let no man
[34:16] despise thy youth
[34:19] but be thou and listen to the young
[34:21] people here now
[34:22] be thou an example of the believers how
[34:26] in word an example in word
[34:30] and if this is an instruction to the
[34:32] young people a young timothy how much
[34:35] more the seniors among us
[34:36] should be an example to the believers in
[34:39] wood
[34:40] are you an example to believers in wood
[34:45] that's that's a powerful one to know are
[34:48] you an example to the believers in word
[34:51] that's one in conversation
[34:55] are you an example of the believers
[35:00] so when people see you are you an
[35:02] example of the believers
[35:04] in conversation he goes on
[35:08] in charity are you an example of the
[35:11] believers
[35:12] in charity it sounds great i am in the
[35:15] message i believe the message i believe
[35:17] the prophet
[35:18] i believe the inspiration are you an
[35:21] example of the believers in charity
[35:24] in spirit are you an example
[35:28] in faith are you an example impurity all
[35:31] that is in
[35:32] that version let no man despise
[35:35] thy youth but be thou an example of the
[35:39] believers in word
[35:40] in conversation in charity in spirit
[35:44] in faith in purity till i come
[35:48] listen to his instruction to timothy
[35:51] till i
[35:51] come give attendance to reading
[35:54] to exhortation and to doctrine
[35:58] so he's encouraging because timothy is a
[36:00] young minister
[36:01] but give attention to reading to
[36:03] exhortation
[36:04] to doctrine can the church say amen
[36:12] timothy would have a heart for god
[36:16] and we see here in first timothy because
[36:20] we're not going to spend too much time
[36:21] in festivity tonight i want to get to
[36:22] second timothy for our reading
[36:24] and our study tonight in 1st timothy 3
[36:27] and verse 14
[36:29] he actually ends that chapter as it were
[36:34] with an encouragement to him that these
[36:36] things i write unto thee
[36:38] hoping to come unto thee shortly
[36:41] so in the absence of paul's physical
[36:44] meeting with timothy he's writing this
[36:47] but if i tarry along i'm writing this
[36:49] that daumayas know how
[36:51] thou art is to behave thyself
[36:54] in the house of god which is the church
[36:57] of the living god the pillar and ground
[36:59] of truth
[36:59] now to put a little context on this
[37:02] these letters to timothy is in the later
[37:04] part of paul's ministry
[37:06] so timothy would have already had the
[37:08] opportunity to be involved in
[37:10] ministry with paul but here it is paul
[37:13] essentially let me show him
[37:14] listen i want you to understand how to
[37:16] behave yourself
[37:17] in the house of god you mean tell me
[37:21] after all these years of the message is
[37:23] that people who still can't behave and
[37:24] you also do you know
[37:26] i don't want to i don't want to drive
[37:28] down that road but here it is
[37:30] paul is speaking to timothy about how to
[37:33] behave yourself
[37:34] in the house of god which is the church
[37:36] of the living god the pillar and ground
[37:39] of truth look at how paul
[37:42] describes timothy to the church in
[37:45] filepie
[37:46] or what we call the philippians
[37:49] philippians 2 and verse 19 philippians 2
[37:53] and verse 19 but i trust in the lord
[37:57] jesus
[37:58] to send timotheus or timothy shortly
[38:00] unto you
[38:02] that i also may be of good comfort
[38:05] when i know your state i'll say that
[38:08] again
[38:09] but i trust in the lord jesus to send
[38:11] timothy
[38:12] shortly unto you that i also may be of
[38:14] good comfort when i know your state in
[38:16] other words
[38:17] i can't wait are trusting in the law
[38:19] because i want this intimacy
[38:21] to you quickly that i can feel good
[38:24] when i know what's going on with you
[38:27] listen to his words
[38:28] for i have no man
[38:31] like-minded that's a powerful statement
[38:35] so this great star in the right hand of
[38:37] god this gold standard
[38:38] that the prophet would describe this
[38:40] this this
[38:41] measuring line that would cut through
[38:44] all of the ages
[38:45] would describe timothy as i have no man
[38:48] like-minded
[38:49] i've not encountered a man like-minded
[38:53] who
[38:53] operates like me who thinks like me who
[38:55] will naturally
[38:56] care for your state so i want you to see
[38:58] that there meaning
[39:00] naturally carefully so it's not a show
[39:02] it's not a put on
[39:03] timothy has a genuine heart i want to
[39:06] present timothy as somebody that
[39:08] you could emulate you can look up to you
[39:10] could take inspiration from
[39:12] naturally care for yesterday and he goes
[39:14] on for all
[39:16] seek their own verse 21 not the things
[39:19] which
[39:19] are jesus christ but ye know
[39:23] the proof of him in other words you know
[39:26] his testimony you know timothy this
[39:29] timothy i want to send to you
[39:31] against the backdrop of those who seek
[39:34] their own
[39:34] and not the things of christ you know
[39:37] the proof
[39:38] of timothy that as a son with the father
[39:42] he had served me in the gospel so that's
[39:45] the kind of report
[39:48] that timothy was able to get as a
[39:50] scorecard from the apostle paul
[39:52] him therefore i hope to send presently
[39:55] or
[39:56] right away so soon as i shall see how it
[39:59] will go with me so depending on how
[40:00] things go with me
[40:01] i will send timothy as quickly as
[40:03] possible to you
[40:04] but i trust in the lord that i also
[40:07] myself
[40:08] shall come shortly
[40:11] now a lot of people don't realize how
[40:14] close
[40:14] the relationship between paul and
[40:16] timothy was
[40:18] in fact and if you have a bible you
[40:20] could go with me
[40:22] let us read uh second corinthians
[40:26] chapter one
[40:29] now many people when they look at these
[40:31] letters they say okay paul wrote the
[40:32] letter right so we understand that
[40:34] but look how second corinthians 1
[40:38] is introduced and i just want you to see
[40:39] the pattern all right so
[40:41] suddenly you see the book hide in there
[40:42] but there are simple things that kind of
[40:44] nudge you right
[40:45] so ii corinthians 1 listen carefully
[40:48] paul
[40:49] an apostle of jesus christ by the will
[40:52] of god
[40:53] and timothy our brother unto the church
[40:56] of god
[40:56] which is at corinth so this letter to
[41:00] the corinthians
[41:01] is not just from paul alone are you with
[41:04] me
[41:06] so this letter to the corinthians this
[41:08] second letter to the corinthians
[41:10] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[41:12] will of god
[41:14] and timothy our brother unto the church
[41:16] of god which
[41:17] is at so timothy
[41:21] some have called him the co-author but
[41:23] he's right here with paul
[41:24] all right let's go to philippians
[41:28] philippians 1 1.
[41:32] paul and timotheus the servants of jesus
[41:36] christ
[41:39] so once again this letter to the
[41:41] philippians
[41:43] is not just paul's letter to the
[41:44] philippians paul
[41:46] and matthias the servants of jesus
[41:49] christ
[41:50] to all the saints in christ jesus which
[41:53] are at philippi with the bishops and the
[41:56] deacons
[41:58] are you seeing a pattern there now let's
[42:00] go to colossians
[42:04] can i move in i hope you're moving too
[42:06] fast
[42:07] this is bible study right suppose you
[42:09] just spin this thing right
[42:11] colossians 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus
[42:16] christ by the will of god and timothy is
[42:19] our brother
[42:22] so we are starting to see a pattern that
[42:24] when you read timothy this is not just a
[42:27] book in the new testament this is a word
[42:30] for a young man who has seen a lot who
[42:33] has been informed enough
[42:35] because each of these churches had their
[42:38] own issues to deal with
[42:40] but paul actually was also teaching not
[42:42] just discipleship but successorship
[42:45] he was also speaking to his protege so
[42:48] to speak
[42:48] a young man who you would understand
[42:51] would be positioned because he is in the
[42:53] loop on what is going on
[42:54] look at first thessalonians let's go
[42:56] first thessalonians
[42:59] verse one first thessalonians verse one
[43:03] this one is even expanded this is paul
[43:07] and salvanas would be silas so paul and
[43:09] sylvanas
[43:10] and timotheus unto the church of the
[43:13] thessalonians
[43:14] which is in this this one is too good to
[43:16] get ready for this world so
[43:18] indulge me just let's read read the
[43:20] first five verse right
[43:21] paul and sylvanas and timotheus so
[43:23] timothy is there again
[43:25] unto the church of the thessalonians
[43:27] which is in god the father
[43:29] and in the lord jesus christ grace be
[43:32] unto you and peace from god our father
[43:34] and the lord jesus christ we give thanks
[43:37] we give thanks so paul is writing but
[43:39] he's speaking
[43:40] they're speaking together we give thanks
[43:42] to god always
[43:44] for you all making mention of you in our
[43:47] prayers
[43:48] so it means he's speaking on timothy's
[43:50] behalf so timothy was
[43:51] also burdened bearing not just for the
[43:54] ephesians church but timothy is also
[43:56] burden-bearing
[43:57] for the the church in thessalonica as
[44:00] well i want you to see context here
[44:01] a young man with a burden all right
[44:05] remembering without ceasing your work of
[44:07] faith and labor of love
[44:09] and patience of hope in our lord jesus
[44:11] christ in the sight of god and our
[44:13] father
[44:14] knowing brethren beloved your election
[44:17] of god
[44:17] for our gospel so this is what paul
[44:20] saying for my gospel
[44:22] but for our gospel came not unto you in
[44:25] word only
[44:26] but also in power and in the holy ghost
[44:28] and in much assurance as he know
[44:30] what manner of men we were among you for
[44:33] your sake
[44:34] so that's why i said you'll see timothy
[44:36] now all through the new testament
[44:38] we we wouldn't read the rest but you'll
[44:39] find it in 2nd thessalonians
[44:41] you'll also find it in philemon all of
[44:44] these
[44:44] written in collaboration with paul or
[44:47] timothy being in the loop
[44:49] with paul as well i trust this has been
[44:51] a blessing to you tonight
[44:53] okay so now let us we're going to spend
[44:56] a little time
[44:57] in second timothy tonight
[45:00] and we're going to take it from second
[45:02] timothy
[45:03] uh verse chapter one verse one
[45:06] we kind of rev this a little bit but
[45:08] we're gonna let's take a little slowly
[45:10] let's spend a little time
[45:11] on it tonight and see how far we can get
[45:13] i i have
[45:14] a desired destination point and we'll
[45:16] see by the grace of god um
[45:18] how far we can get all right paul an
[45:20] apostle of jesus christ
[45:23] by the will of god i like that you know
[45:26] we we speak often of of the ministry and
[45:28] the fightful ministry and
[45:30] and there are many who are debate to
[45:31] fight for ministry and there are people
[45:33] who vote themselves elect themselves
[45:35] aspire desired but paul is saying an
[45:37] apostle of jesus christ by the will of
[45:39] god it was not his own choosing
[45:41] all right according to the promise of
[45:43] life which is in christ jesus
[45:45] to timothy my dearly beloved son grace
[45:48] peace grace mercy and peace from
[45:52] god the father and christ jesus our lord
[45:55] i thank god who myself from my
[45:58] forefathers
[45:59] with pure conscience that without
[46:01] ceasing i have remembrance of thee
[46:03] in my prayers night and day are you
[46:05] praying night and day
[46:07] that's a that that's a principle i don't
[46:10] want this to just be words to you but
[46:12] i want you to enter into paul's world
[46:14] now paul here is in prison writing this
[46:16] uh
[46:18] this is this is not him writing on his
[46:19] bed this is not him writing on the
[46:22] breakfast table
[46:23] and he have a cup of coffee and ham and
[46:25] ham and omelette
[46:26] and and and he relaxes this is paul
[46:29] in prison right in this thing now
[46:33] greatly desiring to see thee being
[46:36] mindful of thy fears the ideas that i
[46:38] might be filled with joy
[46:40] when i call to remembrance the unfair
[46:42] faith that is in me
[46:43] which dwelt first in thy grandmother
[46:46] lois and thy mother eunice
[46:48] and i am persuaded that in thee also
[46:52] verse six let's go wherefore i put thee
[46:55] in remembrance that thou still up the
[46:58] gift of god
[46:59] which is in thee by the putting on of my
[47:01] hands
[47:02] so paul is actually taking
[47:05] timothy through somewhat of his
[47:07] spiritual genealogy so to speak
[47:10] your grandmother your mother i lay my
[47:13] hands on you i want you to remember
[47:14] that in that encounter that experience
[47:17] and if you are in this room tonight
[47:20] it is not just coming to church that
[47:22] keeps you going
[47:23] there's some experience you would have
[47:25] had some encounter you would have had
[47:27] because without an
[47:28] encounter with god it is impossible for
[47:31] you to stay
[47:32] in in this channel so to speak
[47:35] it could have been 20 years ago it could
[47:37] have been five years ago it could have
[47:39] been a little cha
[47:40] whatever it was there had to be a
[47:41] supernatural encounter
[47:43] that no matter what trouble you're going
[47:46] through you can still remember
[47:47] how it was for some they talk about 1983
[47:50] for some 1982 for some 1993 but some is
[47:53] 1987
[47:54] and everybody it's a personal thing and
[47:56] here it is paul
[47:57] in building his encouragement to timothy
[48:00] is saying i want you to
[48:02] to put the in remembrance that you're
[48:04] still up the gift of god which is envy
[48:06] by the putting on of my hands and then
[48:09] paul begins to preach or to encourage
[48:12] true
[48:13] now his word to timothy now we don't
[48:15] know at this point
[48:16] what state timothy is in this is the
[48:19] reverse situation
[48:20] all of the other letters we reference
[48:22] was paul
[48:23] and timothy write into people we write
[48:26] into the thessalonians
[48:28] we write into the colossians we write
[48:29] into these other people
[48:31] this is timothy in that situation was on
[48:34] the right hand side of things he was on
[48:36] the giving side of things
[48:37] here it is now the situation is reversed
[48:40] it is it is as if
[48:41] after paul and timothy and the others
[48:45] have poured all of their resources
[48:47] into these groups and these churches it
[48:50] as if paul is now
[48:51] filling up timothy's tank so to speak so
[48:53] he can continue to run the race
[48:55] is this connecting with anybody tonight
[48:59] it is important for you to be able to
[49:01] recharge your batteries
[49:03] this letter to timothy is paul trying to
[49:06] charge up timothy's batteries he tell
[49:09] him
[49:10] stir up the gift the gift is there you
[49:12] know but it hasn't been stirred up
[49:14] he is there nobody to stir it up you
[49:17] need to you need to remember i want you
[49:19] to remember
[49:20] how god took it through i want you to
[49:22] remember your praying grandmother i want
[49:24] you to remember the first service you
[49:26] went to i wanted to remember
[49:27] the joy you had when you first came into
[49:29] contact with god i want you to i want
[49:31] you to be grounded
[49:33] by where you started from because you
[49:34] didn't start yourself he didn't start
[49:36] when your grandmother was praying he
[49:38] wasn't there when your mother was
[49:40] praying
[49:40] you wasn't there this thing didn't start
[49:42] with you it started before you anybody
[49:43] with me tonight
[49:46] hallelujah you couldn't be here tonight
[49:49] if something didn't stand before you
[49:50] because you couldn't start it you didn't
[49:52] start it it is not your choosing but it
[49:54] was god who chose you
[49:56] and allowed you to be in the house that
[49:58] you were in allowing you to be in your
[50:00] family the neighborhood
[50:01] walking on the street when you when you
[50:03] first hear the full service whatever it
[50:05] was
[50:05] that brought you to that spot so paul
[50:08] wants to carry timothy somewhere
[50:10] but your car start from nowhere you need
[50:12] to start with where you come from you
[50:14] have to start with your with your
[50:16] with your pedigree with your with your
[50:17] heritage with what brought you to where
[50:19] you're at anybody with me tonight
[50:22] so we still have 1v7
[50:25] for god has not given us a spirit of
[50:27] fear that alone
[50:28] deals with coronavirus that deals with
[50:31] the economy
[50:32] that deals with recession that deals
[50:34] with your health problems
[50:35] that deals with your children
[50:36] backsliding that deal with your business
[50:38] falling apart that these were losing
[50:40] your home
[50:41] whatever it is for god had not given us
[50:44] the spirit of fear
[50:45] this is paul's last letter paul is
[50:48] writing
[50:48] not just to timothy but he's writing for
[50:51] those who will read this letter to
[50:52] timothy anybody with me tonight
[50:54] for god hath not give us
[50:57] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[51:00] and of love
[51:01] and of a sound mind so don't tell me
[51:03] tonight you're losing your mind don't
[51:05] tell me tonight
[51:06] you're you're you're so under it that
[51:08] deal you want to give up
[51:10] a sound mind i want to challenge a
[51:13] church tonight
[51:14] that god gave us a sound mind a sound
[51:17] mind to make the right decisions
[51:19] a sound mind to make the right choices a
[51:21] sound
[51:22] mind to lift above the situations and
[51:24] the circumstances anybody with me
[51:25] tonight
[51:26] can the church say man i can't see most
[51:28] of you but that is
[51:29] a better reason to be shouting and
[51:31] jumping because nobody can see you
[51:34] turn your room into a room of noise and
[51:36] worship and shouting
[51:38] because we are sitting tonight like
[51:40] young timothy
[51:41] whether you're young in defeat whether
[51:43] you're young in a journey
[51:44] we are all like timothy tonight being
[51:47] written to
[51:48] by the apostle of apostles by the first
[51:50] time the right hand of god and taking
[51:52] inspiration from it
[51:53] he seemed inspiration every messenger
[51:55] who would come after him would take
[51:57] anybody with me tonight
[51:59] be not thou therefore ashamed
[52:02] of the testimony of our lord this is
[52:05] verse 8
[52:06] or no of me his prisoner now i love this
[52:10] i love this paul is in a roman prison
[52:14] but he not counting the prisoner as the
[52:17] romans
[52:18] [Laughter]
[52:20] he said be no doubt therefore ashamed of
[52:22] the testimony
[52:24] of our lord nor of me his prisoner
[52:27] the romans think they locked me up but i
[52:29] lock up by jesus long time
[52:31] somebody somebody gave god a shout out
[52:33] praise
[52:34] he said i am his prisoner you romans
[52:37] think they have me locked up
[52:38] but i'm locked up i'm jesus prisoner and
[52:41] i'm happy to be his prisoner
[52:43] and the church say amen no atmosphere
[52:46] but be thou partaker
[52:48] of the afflictions of the gospel
[52:51] according to the power of god
[52:53] so they are afflictions of the gospel
[52:56] that is part of the territory that is
[52:58] part of the garment we have to wear part
[53:00] of the experience
[53:01] we have to wear part of the struggle we
[53:03] have to carry the afflictions of the
[53:05] gospel
[53:06] when your family don't want to talk to
[53:08] you when you have to walk away from the
[53:09] work encounter when you have to walk
[53:11] away from situations
[53:12] when you have to to do things a certain
[53:15] way for the cause of the gospel
[53:17] afflictions of the gospel can the church
[53:19] say man
[53:20] anybody with me young people calebs
[53:22] fathers mothers
[53:24] those who are strong those who are
[53:25] getting stronger not even calling you
[53:27] weak
[53:27] those who are strong and those who are
[53:28] getting stronger tonight
[53:32] partakers of the afflictions of the
[53:34] gospel according to the power of god
[53:37] he goes on who had saved us and called
[53:40] us i don't want you to forget it now
[53:43] understand this
[53:45] paul is preaching to a preacher paul is
[53:48] teaching a teacher
[53:50] paul is pastoring a pastor and he is
[53:52] bringing words of encouragement do you
[53:54] know your pastor has been encouragement
[53:56] do you know the assistant passes you
[53:57] know you need ella's
[53:59] you have people who want to walk around
[54:01] so whole yeah than though
[54:02] paul is in a spiritual realm and seen a
[54:05] young pastor need a word
[54:07] a young preacher need an encouragement
[54:09] and he would say to him who had saved us
[54:11] and called us with an holy calling
[54:14] not according to our works we didn't
[54:16] have anything to do with it
[54:18] but according to his own purpose oh
[54:21] if you ever feel discouraged remember
[54:25] remember who had called who had saved us
[54:28] and called us with a holy calling not
[54:31] according to our
[54:32] works but according to his own purpose
[54:35] and grace
[54:36] which was given us in christ jesus
[54:38] before the world
[54:39] began so paul first
[54:42] took timothy back to his mother back to
[54:45] his grandmother
[54:46] back to when he laid hands at him and by
[54:48] verse 9
[54:49] he taken before the world began
[54:54] to say if if you have any issues along
[54:56] that line or you have any
[54:58] memories to taint how this thing works
[55:00] for you too
[55:01] let me take you back way back before the
[55:03] world began can the church say amen
[55:06] could he take some more i'll take a
[55:11] i feel like i'm preaching here this must
[55:12] be a bible study making me feel like a
[55:14] preaching
[55:16] but is now made manifest
[55:19] by the appearing of our savior jesus
[55:21] christ
[55:22] so paul is in his whole purpose that we
[55:24] didn't even know about
[55:26] that was not by our works it was not by
[55:28] our own choosing
[55:29] we sort of stumble into it but it's now
[55:32] made manifest by the appearing of our
[55:35] savior jesus christ
[55:36] who have abolished death so dead is
[55:40] actually abolishing them
[55:44] debt is abolished and had brought life
[55:47] and immortality to light
[55:49] so in other words we couldn't talk about
[55:51] immortality before
[55:52] but because of the appearing of our
[55:55] savior
[55:56] death is now abolished and our
[55:58] immortality
[55:59] is brought to life to light through the
[56:02] gospel
[56:03] whereunto i am appointed a preacher and
[56:06] an apostle and
[56:07] a teacher of the gentiles for
[56:11] which cause verse 12 for for the which
[56:14] cause i also suffer these things
[56:16] nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know
[56:20] whom i have believed and i'm persuaded
[56:24] let this be your testimony tonight that
[56:26] he is able to keep
[56:29] that which i have committed unto him
[56:31] against that day
[56:33] can the church say amen
[56:37] hold fast we don't know
[56:40] what tomorrow holds we don't know what
[56:42] next week holds
[56:44] we don't know what next month holds
[56:46] uncertainty i just saw
[56:48] i think was an august the tent or
[56:49] whatever there was riots in chicago or
[56:51] something
[56:52] and it's all it's explosions in it was
[56:54] it lebanon had an explosion
[56:56] a few days in the whole government
[56:58] resign and these things are happening
[57:00] uncertainty and all these things what
[57:02] are you going to hold on to
[57:03] the government what are they going to
[57:04] hold on to your bank account what are
[57:06] you going to hold on to
[57:07] here it is poor listen to the whole fast
[57:09] the form
[57:10] of sound words which thou has heard of
[57:13] me
[57:14] in faith and love which is in christ
[57:16] jesus
[57:17] that good thing is this a bad thing is
[57:20] this negative is this
[57:21] is this what he hearing tonight designed
[57:23] to destroy you and make you feel weak no
[57:25] it's not
[57:26] for that good thing which was committed
[57:29] unto thee
[57:30] keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth
[57:33] in us this thou knowest
[57:36] that all they which are in asia be
[57:39] turned away from me
[57:40] so paul now is beginning how can i
[57:43] describe this in this last letter
[57:45] to share his pains the pains of ministry
[57:50] the pains of effort that have
[57:53] now turned into people walking away
[57:56] and as brother branham would say you
[57:58] could preacher you're blue in the face
[57:59] and people still wouldn't listen
[58:01] he said they always knew that all day
[58:03] which i need to be turned away from me
[58:05] of whom uh fabulous and hell my guinness
[58:08] the lord gave mercy unto the house of
[58:10] oniferous for he of refreshed me and was
[58:12] not ashamed of my chain
[58:14] but when he was in rome he sought me out
[58:17] very diligently and found me
[58:20] the lord grant unto him that he may find
[58:22] mercy of the lord in that day
[58:24] and in how many things he ministered
[58:25] unto me at ephesus don't know his very
[58:27] well
[58:28] so this whole first chapter is reminding
[58:31] timothy
[58:32] now let's go chapter two could you take
[58:34] some more we're going fine
[58:36] now therefore my son be strong in the
[58:39] grace that is in christ jesus where is
[58:43] your strength coming from
[58:45] you have to understand that your
[58:48] strength has to come
[58:49] from the grace that is in christ jesus
[58:52] if it comes from any other source you
[58:54] will reach failure
[58:56] now therefore my son be strong in the
[59:00] grace
[59:00] that is in christ jesus and the things
[59:04] that thou has heard of me
[59:06] among many witnesses the same commit
[59:08] thou
[59:09] the faithful men who shall be able to
[59:11] teach others
[59:12] also so you see paul has this vision
[59:16] of making sure that he would get into
[59:18] the hands of the people you're trying to
[59:19] keep it locked down
[59:20] you're going to keep it secret they're
[59:21] going to keep it now in our book and
[59:22] commonly seeking room and nobody
[59:24] supposed to know he said commit these to
[59:26] faithful men who will continue to spread
[59:28] this thing
[59:29] all right now let's get do we have any
[59:31] soldiers here tonight
[59:33] any soul is in the army of your lord
[59:38] chapter 2 verse 3 now therefore endure
[59:41] hardness
[59:43] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[59:46] i want to read that one more time now
[59:48] therefore in your hardness
[59:50] as a good soldier of jesus christ
[59:53] and i was sharing i can't remember what
[59:55] mitten i was in
[59:56] about the navy seals you know
[1:00:00] if the lord didn't commit to this am i
[1:00:03] to be a nearby seal
[1:00:06] i don't know if i'll make the height
[1:00:07] requirement i do never maybe speed
[1:00:09] requirement
[1:00:10] i still don't know how to swim but i am
[1:00:13] just blown away
[1:00:15] by when you see navy seals in action boy
[1:00:17] it's just like
[1:00:18] what's not i don't pass the age i think
[1:00:21] i'm too old now
[1:00:22] i don't think i ever had any height
[1:00:26] but what intrigued me about the navy
[1:00:28] seals
[1:00:29] is the fact that if we had that kind of
[1:00:33] training
[1:00:34] in church i'm not sure how many people
[1:00:35] would be in this room tonight you know
[1:00:38] because navy seal training is not
[1:00:41] encouraging you
[1:00:42] come on you go make it come on you go
[1:00:44] make it come on you go fight
[1:00:45] come on you maybe see you training is
[1:00:48] the reverse
[1:00:50] navy sea training is give up now you
[1:00:53] know you're not strong enough
[1:00:55] you know they gotta make it you really
[1:00:57] want to fight you
[1:00:58] the the training is so hard because they
[1:01:01] want the best of the best
[1:01:03] they don't want when they're going
[1:01:04] through the war you they oh
[1:01:07] i'm not sure i don't think i want to go
[1:01:09] on her i don't think
[1:01:10] i don't think i want to keep climbing
[1:01:11] this thing i'm seeing too much enemy
[1:01:13] soldiers can i go back
[1:01:14] they don't want that so they want to
[1:01:16] make sure that if you're committed to
[1:01:18] this thing you could endure hardness
[1:01:21] he could endure pressure you can endure
[1:01:24] stress
[1:01:25] you can endure whatever come your way
[1:01:28] you know they could lose if you're the
[1:01:29] last man standing you're not going down
[1:01:32] if they torture you you're not going
[1:01:34] down if they turn you upside down
[1:01:37] one of the training for navy seal is
[1:01:39] that there's tire up and shoulder in the
[1:01:41] water
[1:01:42] they tire up and throw any water no
[1:01:45] i don't know how else could i want that
[1:01:46] one because one a car swim so you have
[1:01:48] to be able to
[1:01:49] untie yourself and come with water and
[1:01:52] make it but
[1:01:53] so but anybody who qualified at an avc
[1:01:56] would have gone through
[1:01:58] hardship you have to run a certain
[1:02:01] distance
[1:02:01] in a certain time you can run it in the
[1:02:03] time you want by feeling
[1:02:05] has been able to say runish and i want
[1:02:07] to run it in
[1:02:08] in our that don't cut it because you
[1:02:11] can't see it
[1:02:12] only wait wait for me
[1:02:15] every helicopter i have to leave now you
[1:02:17] cabbie give me 15 minutes i will catch
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:20] it had to leave now you're in enemy
[1:02:22] territory
[1:02:23] that is enduring hardship but that don't
[1:02:26] come by
[1:02:26] accident that don't come by accident i
[1:02:29] was sharing it with brother
[1:02:31] over in a conversation i said there are
[1:02:33] people who
[1:02:34] have success that is called accidental
[1:02:36] success
[1:02:39] people stumble on success and it's
[1:02:41] accidental success
[1:02:42] they just happen to be in the right
[1:02:44] place they happen to be at the right
[1:02:46] time
[1:02:46] they happen to have the right
[1:02:47] opportunity but there's a difference if
[1:02:50] it's
[1:02:50] you liberate success if it's planned
[1:02:52] success if it's
[1:02:53] strategic success so shame with brother
[1:02:56] over in a conversation
[1:02:57] i said in like you i'm looking at things
[1:02:59] now i want to move from
[1:03:00] accidental success to strategic or
[1:03:03] deliberate or planned success which
[1:03:04] means
[1:03:05] you're putting things in place to be
[1:03:07] where you need to be
[1:03:08] you don't want to be moving because
[1:03:11] we've moved you're here that way you're
[1:03:12] there and you're way full back it will
[1:03:14] be
[1:03:14] no you want to live your life
[1:03:17] that is your your planning your action
[1:03:20] and that is also scriptural that is
[1:03:22] scriptural
[1:03:23] most of us do not spend enough time in
[1:03:26] prayer
[1:03:27] most of us don't spend enough time doing
[1:03:29] an analysis
[1:03:31] and review you need to slow down
[1:03:34] slow down look at the word
[1:03:38] slow down look at the plan
[1:03:41] slow down ask the question
[1:03:46] coming to it say man running to and fro
[1:03:50] running this you're doing this you're
[1:03:50] doing this you're doing this you're
[1:03:51] doing this and when you look back you
[1:03:53] can't track the results of your activity
[1:03:57] all they could chuck is you're tired
[1:03:59] [Laughter]
[1:04:01] that's the testimony you're tired that's
[1:04:03] tired where's doing this that this
[1:04:05] was the fruit of it have you considered
[1:04:08] is there a better way
[1:04:11] have you considered is a better approach
[1:04:12] i don't know what end up they are trying
[1:04:14] to are trying to speak about this thing
[1:04:15] here so
[1:04:16] let's go on verse 3
[1:04:20] thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:04:24] soldier of jesus christ
[1:04:27] verse 4 no man that wore it
[1:04:30] so here paul is speaking of a military
[1:04:33] militant mindset about the things of god
[1:04:36] no man that wore it entangled himself
[1:04:39] with the affairs of this life that he
[1:04:43] may please him
[1:04:44] who had chosen him to be a soldier in
[1:04:47] other words
[1:04:48] police in nativity focus on the mission
[1:04:57] anybody with me
[1:05:00] listen i want to read that verse to you
[1:05:03] in
[1:05:03] another translation no soldier
[1:05:07] gets entangled in civilian pursuits
[1:05:11] since his aim is to please the one that
[1:05:13] enlisted him
[1:05:15] so if you're familiar with the language
[1:05:17] of military versus civilian
[1:05:19] in other words if you're in the military
[1:05:21] act like you're in the military
[1:05:22] walk like any military talk like in the
[1:05:24] military live like any man
[1:05:26] don't act and behave like a civilian
[1:05:28] because you're a soldier
[1:05:30] you're under a different law
[1:05:34] can the church say man do you know if
[1:05:36] any army the army have their own
[1:05:38] military police that if something
[1:05:39] happened you don't go to the regular
[1:05:41] police that is for
[1:05:42] the police for the civilians if not the
[1:05:43] police for the army i'm not their own
[1:05:45] police you know because they say
[1:05:46] you can't be treated like the civilians
[1:05:50] if there's a matter on the army blacks
[1:05:53] they're not calling the regular police
[1:05:54] they're calling the army police because
[1:05:56] they are soldier we expect a certain
[1:05:58] behavior from you can the church say
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:00] don't read it one more time no soldier
[1:06:03] gets entangled in civilian pursuits
[1:06:06] are you guilty tonight of getting
[1:06:07] entangled in civilian pursuits
[1:06:12] when you are soldier since your aim
[1:06:16] is to please the one who enlisted you
[1:06:18] who signed you up because you didn't
[1:06:19] sign up
[1:06:21] i know you didn't sign up you didn't
[1:06:22] volunteer for this we appreciate that
[1:06:24] point
[1:06:24] but somebody sign us up and trust in the
[1:06:27] battle
[1:06:28] because the person will sign us up and
[1:06:30] put us in the battle know that we have
[1:06:32] what it takes to endure
[1:06:33] the hardness enjoy the test and to win
[1:06:36] the battle
[1:06:36] can the church say amen so no man had
[1:06:39] wore it entangled himself with the
[1:06:40] affairs of this life
[1:06:42] that he may please him that had chosen
[1:06:45] him to be a soldier
[1:06:47] and if a man also strives for masteries
[1:06:51] yet he is not crowned except he strive
[1:06:53] lawfully
[1:06:56] listen to that in another translation
[1:06:58] verse 5
[1:06:59] an athlete is not crowned unless he
[1:07:02] competes according to the rules
[1:07:07] so paul is bringing a big message
[1:07:10] to timothy he's saying there's rules to
[1:07:12] this thing
[1:07:14] and you want to win the right way
[1:07:17] there's no
[1:07:17] you know people like to take shortcuts
[1:07:19] in life shortcut they want the fast
[1:07:21] track
[1:07:21] there's only the quick way so you have
[1:07:23] people they go and play a mark they want
[1:07:25] to play lotto they want to win any
[1:07:26] lottery and
[1:07:27] it has been proven time and time again
[1:07:29] every single person who win the lottery
[1:07:32] give them you can put a clock just come
[1:07:33] down to when they have no
[1:07:35] money again you know why they got it
[1:07:37] without abiding by the rules because
[1:07:39] there's rules to do things
[1:07:41] and if you don't develop your rules
[1:07:43] acquire
[1:07:44] you will not have the rules to keep
[1:07:47] anybody with me so because they bypass
[1:07:50] the rules to acquire
[1:07:52] and they get it by a shortcut it's one
[1:07:53] of them at the time i think years ago
[1:07:55] somebody had winning lottery somewhere
[1:07:57] in trinidad and when water went they
[1:07:59] take champagne and watch the car
[1:08:03] you expect them to have money after two
[1:08:05] years flat they're broken
[1:08:06] broken completely broken
[1:08:10] why they didn't know
[1:08:13] the sacrifice it takes and
[1:08:17] again i think i said it in the message
[1:08:20] have we done enough
[1:08:21] these principles apply in the natural
[1:08:25] and in the spiritual if you don't have
[1:08:28] the discipline
[1:08:29] to get up to do your schoolwork you
[1:08:31] don't have to discipline
[1:08:32] to do your work right i find it hard to
[1:08:35] believe you have to be disciplined to do
[1:08:36] your spiritual working on
[1:08:40] because discipline is a military mindset
[1:08:45] military mindset you know you wake up a
[1:08:46] certain time you run a certain time
[1:08:49] you eat a certain time you dress a
[1:08:51] certain way you make up your bed first
[1:08:53] thing in the morning
[1:08:54] anybody with me oh god help us it's a
[1:08:57] discipline
[1:09:01] i see somebody just cringe when i wake
[1:09:02] up that make everybody know somebody
[1:09:04] just cringe
[1:09:05] is it one is it two is it i is it
[1:09:09] it's a discipline it's a discipline
[1:09:13] and you find the successful people or
[1:09:17] what you what is the finest successful
[1:09:19] is really people who have had a
[1:09:21] discipline to do
[1:09:23] the right things the right way
[1:09:26] all the time
[1:09:30] and if you develop a principle in life
[1:09:32] to do the right thing
[1:09:34] the right way all the time you can only
[1:09:37] lead to the right results
[1:09:39] meditate on the word day and night and
[1:09:42] you have good success
[1:09:43] day and night is a principle
[1:09:47] thankfully you're making mark for
[1:09:48] meditating tonight
[1:09:51] day and night really night i hope it
[1:09:53] related to the day so at least today i
[1:09:54] get a half mark
[1:09:55] even if it is a mark for the whole day
[1:09:57] at least getting half mark for
[1:09:59] meditating
[1:09:59] in the night i hope we do the new day
[1:10:01] because day and night
[1:10:03] meditation we were day and night at
[1:10:06] least we have tonight
[1:10:07] everybody i see a good bit of people in
[1:10:09] this room tonight everybody get a half
[1:10:11] mark for tonight
[1:10:12] i don't know who get the whole mark
[1:10:14] because i did it day and night
[1:10:16] but what we doing tonight you're
[1:10:18] supposed to do every night in your own
[1:10:20] study
[1:10:20] so that you can now stumble upon things
[1:10:22] that would inspire you that could
[1:10:24] raise a question that you could see but
[1:10:26] i never i know that people
[1:10:27] who say i never knew timothy wasn't all
[1:10:29] that much no timothy was there with paul
[1:10:31] and
[1:10:31] in here and here and here and and here
[1:10:33] it is after he was the encourager he is
[1:10:36] being encouraged
[1:10:37] after he was the writer he's been
[1:10:39] written too anybody with me tonight
[1:10:44] and if a man also strives for masteries
[1:10:46] yet he's not crowned except he strives
[1:10:48] lawfully we are chapter two verse six
[1:10:53] the husband man that labor it must be
[1:10:56] first partaker of
[1:10:58] the fruits
[1:11:01] listen to that in another translation it
[1:11:03] is the hard-working farmer
[1:11:04] who ought to have the first share of the
[1:11:06] crops people want to reap what they are
[1:11:09] plant
[1:11:10] people want to enjoy what they work for
[1:11:12] so
[1:11:13] paul has given timothy seeds of life
[1:11:16] so he could operate to say to me and his
[1:11:18] blessing could come and say to it
[1:11:19] if you live in by this you wouldn't look
[1:11:21] at nobody else thinking
[1:11:23] you will decide as a hard-working farmer
[1:11:25] if you want the first share of the crops
[1:11:28] become a hard-working farmer in your
[1:11:30] farm
[1:11:33] hallelujah listen to verse 7
[1:11:37] consider what i say and the lord give
[1:11:40] the
[1:11:40] understanding in all things so paul
[1:11:44] is not just seeing it as words he wants
[1:11:46] that word consider
[1:11:48] listen to that in translation think over
[1:11:51] what i see
[1:11:52] for the lord will give you understanding
[1:11:55] and everything
[1:11:56] so i've given you homework tonight think
[1:11:59] over what i
[1:12:00] say for the lord will give you
[1:12:02] understanding in everything
[1:12:04] this is food think over even right now
[1:12:07] we're going through too fast
[1:12:10] getting slow along with some of these
[1:12:11] things
[1:12:13] the news people spent hours watching
[1:12:16] the kung fu election you know how much
[1:12:18] more valuable this is
[1:12:21] at the end of the day win jump high low
[1:12:24] wherever
[1:12:24] that don't matter you still have to farm
[1:12:27] your lana
[1:12:30] you still have to do your work
[1:12:34] you still have to be disciplined you
[1:12:37] have to create your own economy
[1:12:40] you don't need anybody to create your
[1:12:42] economy you have to bring your heavenly
[1:12:44] economy down here
[1:12:46] you have to tap into the resources of
[1:12:48] your father who has a cattle and a
[1:12:50] thousand hills
[1:12:53] if you're in the right channel you don't
[1:12:55] need a bank loan if in the right channel
[1:12:57] you don't need help
[1:12:58] even your right channel your blessing
[1:13:00] will come until you until
[1:13:01] and there's my cop run it over
[1:13:06] because when god bless you he gave you
[1:13:08] for you and yours it happened as an
[1:13:09] abrahamic principle
[1:13:11] lot issue was because of abraham's
[1:13:13] blessing
[1:13:14] can the church say i mean anybody with
[1:13:16] me tonight a little encouragement we're
[1:13:18] not preaching we're just
[1:13:19] talking have another conversation all
[1:13:20] the scriptures tonight right
[1:13:23] so after all of that these are
[1:13:24] principles
[1:13:26] so people sit in a message without
[1:13:28] discipline
[1:13:30] we see we read the scripture where paul
[1:13:32] said to timothy i'm saying these things
[1:13:34] to you
[1:13:35] because i want you to know how to behave
[1:13:36] yourself in church
[1:13:38] we read it so people want to hold on to
[1:13:42] quote and fight doctrine and have no
[1:13:44] behavior have no discipline
[1:13:46] don't want to work don't want to execute
[1:13:48] by the rules
[1:13:49] don't want to display mastery don't want
[1:13:51] to have discipline
[1:13:52] and go away and paul after saying that
[1:13:55] slow timothy down and say think oh it
[1:13:58] over
[1:13:58] so don't just read this alone it's not
[1:14:00] just words and i said it before
[1:14:03] when god spoke to joshua he didn't say
[1:14:06] read the word there night to them
[1:14:09] that's not the instruction it is
[1:14:11] meditate meditate and reading is two
[1:14:14] different words
[1:14:17] reading is one thing you know what they
[1:14:18] say cow does eat and then let's bring
[1:14:20] back the current truth
[1:14:23] so that meditation is you now
[1:14:27] going back over again you're driving in
[1:14:29] a car and you're thinking about it
[1:14:31] am i living by the right rules because i
[1:14:33] want to win the crown
[1:14:35] i'm a military officer why am i engaging
[1:14:38] in civilian activities
[1:14:41] i'm a soldier in the army of the lord
[1:14:44] why allow any devil to come into my
[1:14:46] house
[1:14:46] because now your house become your
[1:14:48] domain to protect
[1:14:50] because you're a soldier i know you're
[1:14:52] seeing things for what it is you see the
[1:14:54] enemy where he's at
[1:14:55] that's why he biblically we are not
[1:14:56] ignorant of satan devices
[1:14:58] because we understand it's warfare we
[1:15:00] understand it's warfare
[1:15:03] we understand it's not flesh and blood
[1:15:04] but it's principalities and powers
[1:15:06] trying to take us away from our
[1:15:08] spiritual destiny in christ
[1:15:10] reveal to us through his prophet
[1:15:12] everybody with me tonight
[1:15:18] verse 8 2 verse 8. i'm going to try to
[1:15:21] close off
[1:15:22] i think this time uh uh uh lord we're
[1:15:25] really happy because this is part one
[1:15:27] lord willing next week lord willing if
[1:15:29] we pass solos and
[1:15:30] and i give thee bible study it will be
[1:15:32] it will be part two
[1:15:33] we'll continue lessons from timothy part
[1:15:35] two
[1:15:37] remember that jesus christ of the seed
[1:15:40] of david was raised from the dead
[1:15:41] according to my gospel
[1:15:44] i love that that is according to my
[1:15:47] bible
[1:15:47] i don't know why bible you read it but
[1:15:49] according to my gospel i don't know what
[1:15:51] that's what anybody else have
[1:15:52] but according to my gospel jesus christ
[1:15:55] of
[1:15:55] the seed of david was raised from the
[1:15:57] dead wherein i
[1:15:59] suffered trouble look at him as an evil
[1:16:02] doer
[1:16:03] so you say here i am i suffer in trouble
[1:16:06] as an evil doer
[1:16:07] i ain't do no evil but he are locked up
[1:16:09] in prison
[1:16:11] what do we have to complain about you
[1:16:14] lock up
[1:16:18] who lock you up
[1:16:22] wherefor wherein i suffer trouble as an
[1:16:25] evildoer even under bonds
[1:16:34] listen to it in another challenge
[1:16:35] remember jesus has raised from the dead
[1:16:37] the offering
[1:16:37] has preached in my gospel for which i am
[1:16:39] suffering born with chains as a criminal
[1:16:45] but the word of god is not bound
[1:16:48] hallelujah
[1:16:49] wherein i suffer trouble as an evildoer
[1:16:52] even
[1:16:53] under bonds but the word of god is not
[1:16:55] bound
[1:16:56] therefore therefore means after all of
[1:16:59] that
[1:17:00] therefore with that knowledge therefore
[1:17:03] with that position
[1:17:04] i endure all things for the electic
[1:17:08] that they may also obtain the salvation
[1:17:11] which is in christ jesus with eternal
[1:17:14] glory
[1:17:16] i want to challenge the parents tonight
[1:17:19] here it is paul saying i'm enduring all
[1:17:23] of this for the electic
[1:17:27] what are you willing to endure for your
[1:17:29] whole sake
[1:17:32] because the burden of the holy elect is
[1:17:33] not anywhere
[1:17:37] but there's a responsibility and a
[1:17:39] charge given to you for your house
[1:17:43] it's a real responsibility what are you
[1:17:46] willing to endure
[1:17:48] for this as for me and my house we will
[1:17:51] serve the lord
[1:17:56] the endurance of the suffering that paul
[1:17:59] had
[1:18:00] was based on an understanding that his
[1:18:03] sacrifice
[1:18:05] was for the elect even unto us
[1:18:09] god picked him for that responsibility
[1:18:11] we too have a responsibility
[1:18:18] so he reconsidered the bonds that he was
[1:18:21] in
[1:18:21] he reconsidered we call that a paradigm
[1:18:24] shift
[1:18:26] we call that reframing the situation
[1:18:29] so yes it is one way but let us relook
[1:18:32] at what it is
[1:18:34] and see a deeper cause so to speak
[1:18:38] some of us in our selfishness have hurt
[1:18:41] our families
[1:18:43] i have seen people made bad bad
[1:18:46] decisions
[1:18:48] and it's unfortunate because many times
[1:18:51] people don't seek counsel and they don't
[1:18:53] seek advice and
[1:18:54] the bible speaks about out of the
[1:18:57] multitude of counsel good decisions are
[1:18:59] made
[1:19:01] how will you go back in when there's so
[1:19:03] much scripture
[1:19:05] because every good principle for all i'm
[1:19:08] a reader i'm a studio
[1:19:09] everything i've studied any naturally
[1:19:12] spiritual
[1:19:12] i find it is it is clearer it is better
[1:19:15] you can't beat this scripture
[1:19:18] if you live by the bible forget it
[1:19:22] forget it your life would be so peaceful
[1:19:26] yet you will have to endure but it is
[1:19:29] clear
[1:19:30] you see things in the right context you
[1:19:32] see when you are suffering because you
[1:19:34] make bad decisions that's a whole
[1:19:35] different story you know
[1:19:37] paul's suffering was done bad decision
[1:19:39] suffering
[1:19:40] what paul had to endure is part of the
[1:19:43] character formation the cause of the
[1:19:45] christ these things
[1:19:47] but some of us are suffering because of
[1:19:49] bad choices
[1:19:50] bad decisions we sacrifice for the wrong
[1:19:53] thing
[1:19:54] and then we say well god help me know so
[1:19:56] tonight we want to reframe that
[1:19:59] in paul's part in words he is making
[1:20:02] sure
[1:20:03] that timothy sees things the right way
[1:20:06] can we church say amen a few moments
[1:20:09] we're going to close
[1:20:10] i'm going to try to wrap up right here
[1:20:12] therefore i endure
[1:20:14] all things for the electic that they may
[1:20:17] also obtain the salvation which is
[1:20:19] in christ jesus with eternal glory it
[1:20:22] is a faithful saying for if we be dead
[1:20:26] with him we shall also live with him
[1:20:29] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[1:20:32] him
[1:20:33] if we deny him he also
[1:20:36] will deny us
[1:20:41] have you been denying him how do we deny
[1:20:44] him
[1:20:46] it's in his simple things you know
[1:20:50] i preach a message about and my people
[1:20:52] shall never be achieved
[1:20:55] to deny him is to deny his will to deny
[1:20:59] him is to deny his love
[1:21:00] to deny him as to deny his purpose to
[1:21:03] deny him as to deny his teachings
[1:21:05] to deny him as to deny his laws
[1:21:09] and when you actually walk by your own
[1:21:12] decision you are denying him
[1:21:14] because even jesus had to bring himself
[1:21:16] under subjection and say not
[1:21:18] my will i don't want to deny you
[1:21:21] come on now i don't want to deny your
[1:21:23] will because his will was
[1:21:25] so jesus himself was living by the same
[1:21:27] principle
[1:21:29] we cannot live by our will
[1:21:32] we cannot live by our purpose we cannot
[1:21:36] live by our plan paul is guiding timothy
[1:21:43] simple but deep if we believe not
[1:21:46] yet he abided faithful he cannot deny
[1:21:50] himself of all these things of these
[1:21:53] things
[1:21:54] put them in remembrance charging them
[1:21:57] before the lord
[1:21:58] that they strive not about words to no
[1:22:01] prophet
[1:22:02] but to the subverting to the hearers
[1:22:07] can the church see
[1:22:20] 923 15
[1:22:24] one of my token scriptures and years ago
[1:22:27] this was said to me and i
[1:22:29] i held these words on to this day
[1:22:33] study to show thyself approved
[1:22:37] unto god a workman that needeth not to
[1:22:41] be ashamed
[1:22:42] rightly dividing the word
[1:22:47] of truth
[1:22:51] in another translation do your best to
[1:22:53] present yourself to god as one
[1:22:55] approved study to show yourself approved
[1:22:59] unto god i'll close out with this and i
[1:23:02] trust this is a blessing
[1:23:03] to you i was sharing in a meeting i was
[1:23:07] in
[1:23:09] you know there are many people they
[1:23:10] aspire different career paths you know
[1:23:12] and
[1:23:14] a lot of people they say well i want to
[1:23:15] be a doctor i want to be a lawyer
[1:23:18] i want to be a pilot and these are some
[1:23:22] professions
[1:23:23] that come with typically high
[1:23:27] compensation
[1:23:28] doctors lawyers pilots
[1:23:32] and it's very interesting because you
[1:23:34] cannot be
[1:23:35] any one of these three professions
[1:23:36] without study
[1:23:40] you don't become a pilot i'm trying
[1:23:43] as a young person people just jump in
[1:23:46] their father car and
[1:23:54] it is not that simple you can't be a
[1:23:57] doctor a feeling cottage
[1:23:59] a feeling to recommend something
[1:24:03] you can't be a lawyer and just go to
[1:24:05] court and
[1:24:06] and and they don't understand the law
[1:24:10] and yeah read nothing and you just there
[1:24:12] like years ago i don't know who might
[1:24:13] remember
[1:24:15] there was a brother god bless his heart
[1:24:16] from the messenger i'm not sure what his
[1:24:17] status is right now
[1:24:18] but he had a court case and at some
[1:24:21] point they asked me what he had anything
[1:24:22] to say
[1:24:24] and he said he was at the priest say
[1:24:27] lord god you know you are the only true
[1:24:29] judge
[1:24:29] of course you judging your courtroom
[1:24:30] just put on his glasses and look at him
[1:24:34] you don't be a lawyer by accident
[1:24:38] to become a lawyer to become a doctor to
[1:24:40] become a pilot
[1:24:42] it takes a lot of years of study
[1:24:45] but beyond that one of the reasons these
[1:24:48] three professions are so highly
[1:24:50] compensated is not just the study
[1:24:53] but is the cost of failure
[1:24:56] and the commensurate benefit of success
[1:24:58] so
[1:25:00] when a pilot makes a mistake you know
[1:25:03] what happened right
[1:25:04] the plane crash people die
[1:25:07] the cost is extremely high so you don't
[1:25:10] want somebody say well i'll be
[1:25:12] participating i almost listen i didn't
[1:25:15] feel
[1:25:16] half the pilot testing or others i just
[1:25:18] gave something out of his line
[1:25:21] is that 50 50. is it 50 i'm not sure it
[1:25:23] depends on how feeling
[1:25:25] you don't want to be in that plane
[1:25:28] if you enter a doctor's room and i say
[1:25:30] well i still study i don't know i have
[1:25:32] finished that part but
[1:25:33] i will try a thing you want somebody who
[1:25:36] is trusted who is tribe who not only
[1:25:38] has the study but also there's a level
[1:25:41] of experience with it so i want to bring
[1:25:43] this study forward
[1:25:46] that as a christian as a believer
[1:25:49] as a soldier even in the army you know
[1:25:52] that's johnny army and
[1:25:53] and what people joining me and you're
[1:25:56] gonna shoot yourself in your foot
[1:25:58] you don't know how to load the gun you
[1:26:00] know what they're cleaning on how much
[1:26:01] mishaps happen when people trying to
[1:26:03] clean the gun and they don't know how to
[1:26:03] clean the gun right
[1:26:06] you to reach out there to fight the
[1:26:08] enemy yet you tire but you can't put
[1:26:09] back the gun together
[1:26:11] without training you will not be able to
[1:26:15] fight the battle
[1:26:16] and one of the challenges this is one of
[1:26:18] the reasons we have such a burden
[1:26:20] to do the bible study and to slow down
[1:26:22] and make sure we catch everybody at the
[1:26:24] get rid of the quotes and get into the
[1:26:26] scripture and stuff because
[1:26:27] people have become so casual and so
[1:26:31] lazy and because it would appear
[1:26:34] that the cost of failure is not punitive
[1:26:38] that nobody checking your paper nobody
[1:26:40] coming on market people
[1:26:42] there's a reason why in school they have
[1:26:43] exams
[1:26:45] if there was no exam you know people
[1:26:46] would leave school without nothing right
[1:26:50] but some people it's only because the
[1:26:52] exam come in and then they end up
[1:26:53] cramming
[1:26:54] they stay up all night and they think
[1:26:56] think thing and they write it
[1:26:57] because the exam system was meant to
[1:26:59] bring a level of accountability
[1:27:02] that you have been proven that you have
[1:27:04] been approved approved
[1:27:06] study teachers have approved that
[1:27:08] approval process
[1:27:10] approved in word approved in character
[1:27:13] approved in life
[1:27:15] so that whatever situation that you have
[1:27:17] to face with
[1:27:18] you cannot pull from your toolkit you
[1:27:20] don't ever use all the tools
[1:27:22] but you can pull from the toolkit
[1:27:24] because you
[1:27:25] you know how to handle it so a lawyer
[1:27:27] don't remember everything you know
[1:27:29] but because they have went through a
[1:27:31] certain process they could know how to
[1:27:33] pull from the shelf certain things
[1:27:35] how to connect certain things you will
[1:27:38] not remember every scripture you will
[1:27:39] not remember every quote
[1:27:41] it is it it may be humanly impossible
[1:27:44] but
[1:27:44] after you go to the training you know i
[1:27:47] know
[1:27:47] paul let me check back what he said to
[1:27:49] timothy because timothy was there when
[1:27:51] he wrote to the thessalonians timothy
[1:27:53] was there when he wrote any colossians
[1:27:55] timothy was there
[1:27:56] and and and here it is here it is now we
[1:27:59] have
[1:27:59] to advise somebody who was giving advice
[1:28:02] and how we treat with him
[1:28:03] their lessons and lessons and lessons in
[1:28:05] there that we could have wisdom with how
[1:28:06] to deal with our family or deal with our
[1:28:08] co-workers
[1:28:09] you see how paul handled timothy he
[1:28:11] didn't have to have him
[1:28:13] circumcised but you know what brother
[1:28:14] brandon said keep these shots all for
[1:28:15] you
[1:28:17] so he operated a certain way so that
[1:28:20] timothy will have a hard time
[1:28:22] and god know what he's doing have jew
[1:28:24] have gentile
[1:28:28] so i pray that is a blessing to you
[1:28:29] tonight and that you will look at our
[1:28:31] precious brother timothy
[1:28:33] another way a deeper way and see that
[1:28:36] this young man that god would use that
[1:28:39] whether you're young tonight you could
[1:28:40] be used
[1:28:41] and if you are more mature it means we
[1:28:43] have less excuses
[1:28:45] and i want to encourage you read it
[1:28:47] study it
[1:28:49] first timothy has six chapters second
[1:28:51] timothy has four chapters ten chapters
[1:28:53] in total
[1:28:54] that is your homework study it read it
[1:28:56] and by the grace of god
[1:28:58] um we'll be able to do some more in
[1:28:59] there let us bow our heads a word of
[1:29:00] prayer
[1:29:03] our grace just heavenly father we thank
[1:29:05] you tonight for
[1:29:06] these few words just to encourage your
[1:29:08] people to challenge your people
[1:29:10] to show your people through the
[1:29:12] scripture by your help lord how
[1:29:15] you have been tying things so
[1:29:16] beautifully together
[1:29:18] that you have given unto us as peter
[1:29:20] would say
[1:29:21] all things pertaining to life and
[1:29:24] godliness
[1:29:25] that all the tools we could need for
[1:29:27] life and
[1:29:28] godliness is in your word and you want
[1:29:30] us to be soldiers
[1:29:32] representatives of a higher kingdom
[1:29:34] representative
[1:29:35] of the one who enlisted us that we could
[1:29:38] walk a certain way talk and certainly
[1:29:40] live above the the struggles and the
[1:29:43] stresses of this life
[1:29:44] and endure the hardship that would come
[1:29:47] because we are in a warfare
[1:29:49] and in a warfare there would be hardship
[1:29:50] there will be attacks there'll be
[1:29:52] skirmishes there'll be
[1:29:53] guerrilla attacks as the enemy tries to
[1:29:55] distract us but tonight we come to
[1:29:57] refocus as it will
[1:29:58] and to meditate on your word not just
[1:30:00] read it
[1:30:01] but spend a little time looking at it
[1:30:03] turning it over
[1:30:04] having a conversation about it to see
[1:30:06] perhaps what we have not seen before to
[1:30:08] ask about it what we have not asked
[1:30:10] before so that we can leave refresh
[1:30:12] energized inspired motivated to keep on
[1:30:16] fighting
[1:30:16] motivated despite the struggles to keep
[1:30:20] focus on the prize and we could say like
[1:30:22] paul wood in this very
[1:30:24] in this very second timothy i have
[1:30:26] fought a good fight
[1:30:28] i have finished my course i've kept the
[1:30:30] faith
[1:30:31] on a huge portion a reward a heaven a
[1:30:35] crown is waiting for me so father may
[1:30:36] you
[1:30:37] be with your people may you strengthen
[1:30:38] the people may you bring us back at the
[1:30:40] appointed time and
[1:30:41] may you help us to grow from strength
[1:30:44] and strength we commit
[1:30:45] your church any people into your hands
[1:30:46] in the precious name of jesus christ
[1:30:49] amen and amen and amen
[1:30:53] may the lord bless you tonight
[1:30:56] service continues tomorrow night uh
[1:30:59] at 8 00 pm uh beyond a great expectation
[1:31:03] try your very best to make it out and if
[1:31:05] for some reason you can't
[1:31:06] you can catch a live stream make it a
[1:31:09] discipline
[1:31:10] this should be something you'll have to
[1:31:12] be reminded about because you're soldier
[1:31:14] and soldiers keep track of these things
[1:31:16] you want to know where your food coming
[1:31:17] from you want to know where your
