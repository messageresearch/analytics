[11:50] be here tonight let us bow our heads
[11:53] forward a prayer and we have a special
[11:56] request from Brother Kelly a special
[11:59] request upon his heart that he want to
[12:01] see things work out by the grace of God
[12:03] let's bow ah heads and pray Heavenly
[12:05] Father we thank you for this greatest
[12:08] opportunity that you give us tonight to
[12:10] have the greatest weapon that you place
[12:12] in the hands of man the power of prayer
[12:15] prayer moves you prayer influence Heaven
[12:19] oh Jesus come on tonight in a special
[12:21] way and Minister and meet the needs of
[12:23] your people gathered here tonight in
[12:24] this virtual room I pray Lord for the
[12:27] desire of the heart or what's upon
[12:29] brother Kelly Sal's Heart Lord Lord may
[12:32] you intervene in a special way may a
[12:35] hand of Mercy Grace and protection and
[12:37] most importantly your Supernatural Grace
[12:40] strength and power minister in this
[12:42] particular situation I commit it into
[12:44] your hands and ask for an intervention
[12:47] just by you Lord in your own special way
[12:50] in the name of Jesus we ask it amen and
[12:53] amen God bless you and again thanks for
[12:56] being here tonight and I trust that all
[12:58] of you would have heard the service this
[13:02] last Wednesday and I listened to it I
[13:05] believe that God is releasing a key how
[13:08] we could access his prayer how we going
[13:10] to access His blessings to prayer based
[13:14] upon forgiveness and something God
[13:16] highlighted on Wednesday night was that
[13:18] resentment that feeling that emotion
[13:21] towards someone that will make you want
[13:23] to cross your road don't want to greet
[13:24] them don't want to talk with them don't
[13:26] want to relate to them so when you
[13:28] overcome in your own spirit in itself
[13:30] and I am not just talking words I'm
[13:32] talking for my own personal experience
[13:34] is it's a complete change Al together
[13:36] how you view things you're not viewing
[13:39] what are they thinking about me
[13:40] therefore you have to be cautious with
[13:41] your word no you are being what God made
[13:44] you to be and you are free and you have
[13:47] love in your heart and you have your
[13:48] concern for others so tonight before we
[13:53] start this scripture brother Joe sent me
[13:55] this um Joseph Williams this poem that
[13:58] we had read
[13:59] I don't know some years ago do not judge
[14:02] too hard and I want to read it back
[14:05] tonight before we
[14:06] start pray don't find fault with the man
[14:09] who limps or stumbles along the road
[14:13] unless you have worn the shoes that hurt
[14:16] or struggle beneath his load there may
[14:19] be taxs in his shoes that hurt though
[14:22] hidden away from VI or the burdeny Bears
[14:26] placed on your back might cause you to
[14:29] stumble to don't sne at the man who is
[14:33] down today unless you have felt the blow
[14:37] that causes fall or felt the same that
[14:41] only the fall know you may be strong but
[14:46] still the blows that were his if dealt
[14:50] to you in the selfsame way at the self
[14:53] same time might cause you to stagger
[14:57] too don't be be too harsh with the man
[15:00] who sins or Pelt him with words or
[15:03] Stones unless you are sure ye doubly
[15:07] sure that you have no sins of your own
[15:11] for you who know perhaps if the
[15:15] tempter's voice should whisper as soft
[15:18] to you as it did to him when he went
[15:21] astray would cause you to fter too so I
[15:25] think that is something with while
[15:27] reading to you encourage your heart to
[15:29] tonight so the script we want to read
[15:31] tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter 10
[15:34] 1:5 Paul speaks second Corinthians 10 1:
[15:39] 5 he says now I Paul myself beseech you
[15:44] by the meekness and gentleness of Christ
[15:48] who in presence I'm base among you but
[15:52] being absent and bold towards you but I
[15:56] beseech you that I may not be bold when
[15:58] I I am present with that confidence
[16:01] where it I think to be bold against some
[16:04] which think of us as if we
[16:07] walked according to the flesh so he was
[16:10] addressing the fact that his boldness
[16:12] his confidence his presentation some of
[16:15] the Believers thought he walking
[16:16] according to the flesh listen to these
[16:19] words in verse three for though we walk
[16:21] in the flesh we do not
[16:24] war after the flesh the weapons of our
[16:29] Warfare and not carnal But Mighty true
[16:33] God to the pulling down of
[16:36] strongholds casting down imaginations
[16:39] and every High thing that exalted itself
[16:42] against the knowledge of God and
[16:44] bringing into captivity every thought to
[16:47] The Obedience of Christ so the title I
[16:49] have tonight is the
[16:50] weapon plural of our Warfare and not
[16:53] caral title is the weapons of our
[16:54] Warfare and not car caral that word
[16:59] caral a manifestation of a person's
[17:02] lower
[17:03] nature
[17:04] fleshly it relates to feelings passions
[17:08] and appetites and Wars of the body
[17:12] instead of Fai caral will use the eyes
[17:16] feelings and emotion living in a fleshly
[17:21] realm there is no way you can do battle
[17:25] in that
[17:27] realm or in that way
[17:30] there is no discernment there there is
[17:33] nothing spiritual there just natural
[17:37] complaining and
[17:40] murmuring now Paul continue in Romans 8
[17:43] there is therefore now no condemnation
[17:45] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[17:47] walk not after the flesh but after the
[17:49] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[17:52] in Christ Jesus had made me free from
[17:54] the law of sin and death for what the
[17:56] law could not do in other words weak
[17:59] through the flesh God sending his own
[18:01] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[18:04] force sin condemn sin in the flesh that
[18:09] the righteousness of the law might be
[18:12] fulfilled in us who who who walk not
[18:16] after the flesh but after the spirit so
[18:20] Paul here was distinguishing the
[18:23] carnality the natural nature from
[18:26] walking after the spirit verse five for
[18:29] they here we go that are after The Flesh
[18:32] do mind the things of the flesh but they
[18:36] that are after the spirit the things of
[18:38] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[18:41] Deb but to be spiritually minded is life
[18:46] and peace because the carnal mind is
[18:50] enmity against God for it is not subject
[18:54] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[18:58] so then they that are in the flesh
[19:01] cannot please God but he are not in the
[19:04] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[19:07] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[19:09] any man have not the spirit of Christ
[19:11] none of his so therefore from the
[19:14] scripture Paul saying the weapons of
[19:17] warfare is not caral is not my car
[19:21] better than your car my house better
[19:22] than your house you have more money on
[19:24] this one you are more things than this
[19:25] one you a better career you better
[19:27] position better title
[19:29] you up somebody's down that's irrelevant
[19:31] that's just natural stuff that doesn't
[19:33] count now
[19:36] in the Amplified this same scripture we
[19:39] read it says this
[19:41] here now for those who are according to
[19:44] the Flesh and a control okay so that the
[19:49] righteousness and just requirement of
[19:51] the law might be made be fully met in us
[19:54] who live and move not in the ways of the
[19:57] flesh but in the way of the spirit Our
[20:00] Lives governed not by the standards and
[20:03] according to the takes of the flesh but
[20:06] controlled by the holy spirit for those
[20:08] who are according to the flesh are
[20:11] controlled by its Unholy
[20:14] desires set their minds on and pursue
[20:19] those things which gratify the flesh but
[20:23] those who are according to the spirit
[20:26] and are controlled by the desire of the
[20:28] spirit
[20:29] set their minds and seek those things
[20:33] which
[20:34] gratify the Holy
[20:36] Spirit now the mind of the flesh which
[20:39] is sense and reason without the holy
[20:42] spirit is debt debt that comprises all
[20:45] the miseries arising from sin both here
[20:48] and Hereafter but the mind of the holy
[20:50] spirit is life Soul peace and now and
[20:54] forever because the mind of the flesh
[20:57] which is carnal thoughts and purpose is
[20:59] is hostile to God it does not subject
[21:01] itself to God's law indeed it cannot be
[21:05] so a canal minded person rebuked they
[21:09] blow up a canal minded person corrected
[21:12] they get a fight from face they got
[21:15] upset because they are in the flesh they
[21:18] would say you know what there must be a
[21:21] purpose behind it all things work
[21:23] together for good the Reason God could
[21:26] boast upon job because he knew knew what
[21:29] job had in his heart that job wouldn't
[21:31] curse him in it was justified that job
[21:35] was blessed above others it was
[21:37] justified that job had a hedge around
[21:39] him but the Hedge wasn't based upon
[21:42] canal and just flesh the Hedge was based
[21:46] upon the Fai that job had in him and God
[21:49] had the confidence that Under Pressure
[21:53] job would stand and that fate would hold
[21:57] and this is the same thing God want from
[21:59] us when things are fine when things are
[22:02] working out smoothly for you when things
[22:04] are working out just as you having in
[22:05] your heart and everything working out so
[22:07] nice and whatnot that is okay but the
[22:10] test come when the tables are turned and
[22:14] things come against you and things come
[22:17] contrary to your expectation and God
[22:19] sits back to look and see what his sons
[22:23] and daughters who supposed to be growing
[22:25] onto maturity how they will act and how
[22:28] they will behave that is why I ask a
[22:31] question on Wednesday night why would
[22:34] God tell a prophet who have been saved
[22:38] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[22:40] and bring his attention to brotherly
[22:43] kindness how he was condemning a woman
[22:46] and he said I forgive you and you
[22:49] condemn her why would God do that
[22:51] because two things one we get tested
[22:55] before power and then we get tested with
[22:57] power sometime power could destroy
[23:00] people if they don't have the character
[23:01] to manage it so later on when the test
[23:05] came in the church with the two people
[23:07] carrying on trying to make love and
[23:09] different things and God tell if they
[23:10] say blind they'll blind if they say die
[23:12] they will die but AB Bram said I forgive
[23:14] you what did he do there he actually
[23:16] took the place of God he actually
[23:19] expressed God's kindness to people who
[23:23] from a natural standpoint should be
[23:26] judged could be judged and just Sting
[23:28] the stands up to be judged but this man
[23:31] because of the maturity because of the
[23:33] growth because he's growing in Grace and
[23:35] knowledge he came to that mature spot
[23:37] where he could say I forgive you Holy
[23:39] Spirit poured out and God was pleased
[23:42] God was pleased not to say you see my
[23:44] word gave indicated and I speak the word
[23:46] and this and that no no not that not
[23:47] that drama but he said I forgive you and
[23:50] he acted like God so listen friends I
[23:54] want to encourage you tonight that we
[23:56] are in a Warfare
[23:58] not a picnic Paul said in Ephesians 6 We
[24:02] R not against flesh and blood and I know
[24:04] we we touched this many many times but I
[24:07] don't know how much it's sinking into
[24:09] your spirit that sometimes your home
[24:11] under attack you under attack your body
[24:13] under attack your marriage under
[24:16] attack your job under attack I was
[24:19] listening to some people that get
[24:20] converted out of Witchcraft different
[24:22] ones and how they attack Christian homes
[24:25] and churches and so on and the
[24:27] testimonies you keep hearing all alone
[24:29] those homes that under prayer they have
[24:31] to back off they have to keep off they
[24:34] can't handle because that prayer brings
[24:37] a covering that they cannot do this
[24:39] stuff protected under the covering of
[24:42] prayer and the prophet said you'll read
[24:44] it before we close tonight that prayer
[24:47] is the greatest weapon that God could
[24:50] give man and that is why the devil want
[24:52] to shut your mouth that you will open
[24:54] and pray and you tell yourself you pray
[24:56] before and you don't want to par God
[24:58] like if God has a flesh and blood and
[25:00] you don't want to tell him again you
[25:01] don't want to remind God and God want to
[25:03] be reminded he want you to remind him of
[25:06] his promise he want you to remember his
[25:08] ways and his word and that you to
[25:11] express to him your confidence that you
[25:14] believe he has the ability to take care
[25:16] of the situation around you take care of
[25:18] the situation in your family take care
[25:20] of your situation take care of your life
[25:22] could we say Amen Wherever We Are
[25:24] Tonight blessed be the name of the Lord
[25:27] so the Bible says we ration not against
[25:29] flesh and blood but against
[25:30] principalities and he Amplified it says
[25:33] God put on God's whole armor the armor
[25:35] of a heavy armed Soldier which God supps
[25:39] that you may be able to successfully to
[25:41] stand against all the here we go the
[25:44] strategies and deceits of the devil for
[25:47] we are not wrestling with flesh and
[25:49] blood contending only with physical
[25:51] opponents but against deism against the
[25:54] powers against the master spirits who
[25:57] are the World rulers of this present
[26:00] Darkness against the spiritual forces of
[26:03] wickedness in the Heavenly Supernatural
[26:06] sphere so listen the Bible says weapons
[26:10] of our Warfare is not just weapon but
[26:13] weapons plural humility is a
[26:17] weapon love is a weapon kindness is a
[26:20] weapon forgiveness is also a weapon you
[26:24] keep what says you keep uh things SP by
[26:27] prayer and you you get sweet you sweeten
[26:31] the temple with prayer you you you
[26:33] actually get rid of mean spirit and
[26:36] stingy Spirit by giving giving is a
[26:38] choice you could give and you could keep
[26:40] stingy and mean you could hold on to
[26:41] what you have or you could share and as
[26:43] you share you see things come back to
[26:45] you and you get blessed that's how you
[26:47] get rid of spirits that's how you get
[26:49] rid of things you're doing something and
[26:52] this channel of prayer give you an
[26:54] opportunity to ask God to intervene on
[26:57] your behalf tonight I want to challenge
[26:59] you not just to pray for yourself but
[27:01] pray for somebody else tonight pray for
[27:03] somebody else pray for some Ministry
[27:06] pray for some brother some sister pray
[27:08] for somebody else with a burden with a
[27:10] concern watch God blessing come back
[27:12] upon you don't just stick with you and
[27:14] your family and and bless me and that's
[27:16] all of it all right let's continue now
[27:18] all right the Bible speaks of the weapon
[27:22] plural of our Warfare Warfare refers to
[27:26] the violent conflict between our armed
[27:28] enemies in modern times is usually
[27:31] conducted by Armed Forces so friends I
[27:34] have this written
[27:35] here it can't be only one side is arm
[27:38] the devil shootting you devil beat you
[27:40] up the devil bounce you the devil
[27:42] something the devil and the devil devil
[27:44] it cannot be one side armed we will
[27:47] assigned
[27:48] weapons but they are not carnal and
[27:52] that's why I say my house bigger than
[27:53] your house uh you have more money than
[27:55] this one and you're comparing natural
[27:57] this neighborh house is 2 by two you
[27:59] make your own 4x4 so you know that is
[28:02] foolishness spiritual warfare here we go
[28:06] refers to the believer's struggle
[28:08] against evil spiritual forces and we as
[28:13] Believers have to rely on God's power
[28:16] and putting on the whole armor of God
[28:18] almost done and these are some on the
[28:20] prophet prayer is the most powerful
[28:24] weapon that was ever put in the hand of
[28:27] mankind
[28:29] and now to heal I have no powers nobody
[28:32] else does there's no power in man to
[28:35] heal the only thing we can do we can
[28:37] pray and prayer is the most forceful
[28:42] weapon that is ever put in the hands of
[28:45] anybody what God calls great man calls
[28:48] foolish now this on different places so
[28:50] I have it in a flowing way what God
[28:53] calls great man calls foolish what man
[28:55] calls foolish God calls great so what we
[28:58] have got to do is to get back into the
[29:00] program of God and find out after all
[29:03] what God wants us to do and the only way
[29:06] here we go I know to do it is prayer
[29:10] prayer is the
[29:12] key that is the answer Prayer Changes
[29:16] Things prayer is the most powerful
[29:20] weapon that was ever put in control of
[29:23] human beings there was no atomic bomb no
[29:26] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[29:29] prayer will change the mind of God this
[29:32] is so powerful to me and let me stop
[29:35] here a minute I was listening and I
[29:37] started to listen to The Grace Battle of
[29:39] a fort and the prophet said an
[29:41] astonishing thing and he was
[29:44] showing why organization cannot win the
[29:48] battle or fight for God you know why you
[29:51] know I have been in that book so many
[29:53] times but this one struck me he say you
[29:56] know why because because the
[29:58] Battleground is the mind so here it is
[30:01] ministers and pastors set the people up
[30:03] to believe that belong that they belong
[30:06] to the right group because they in their
[30:07] churches and whatnot but the battle is
[30:09] in the individual mind and you as an
[30:13] individual if you don't bust through
[30:16] break out break through you'll be
[30:19] defeated in a church that has deceived
[30:23] an individual to let them know you're
[30:25] safe in here so the church is not
[30:28] fighting your
[30:30] Warfare we have a Warfare we have a war
[30:34] that is going on I cannot fight for war
[30:36] for you I could pray with you I could
[30:39] intercede for you I could ple for you
[30:43] but at the end of the day you got to
[30:46] fight now fighting these with soldiers
[30:50] these with boots these with training
[30:52] because the devil have ranks that why
[30:54] the Bible say principalities Powers
[30:57] spiritual WI this is not that the devil
[30:59] just have a a club that have no order in
[31:02] it it have structure he has a kingdom do
[31:06] you understand what I'm saying God have
[31:08] a kingdom God have structure and God
[31:11] have order now to you here who are
[31:13] hearing me tonight that don't like
[31:15] structure that don't like order that
[31:18] don't like discipline when your battle
[31:21] not M when you have to contend with your
[31:25] big fight you will be in serious
[31:27] difficult difficulty because to fight
[31:30] you have to be trained you have to be
[31:33] able to follow instruction you have to
[31:35] be able to follow guidance so let me
[31:37] drop up here right now and close listen
[31:40] to this now you see here we go when you
[31:44] go to praying for
[31:46] somebody something goes to taking place
[31:50] there is where we feel friends not
[31:53] praying prayer is the key note ask and
[31:57] you shall receive you have not because
[32:00] you ask not you ask not because you
[32:03] believe not ask abundance that your joy
[32:07] may be full ask and believe that you
[32:10] receive what you ask for then hold onto
[32:13] it don't leave it if it's a promise in
[32:15] the Bible it's been revealed to you that
[32:18] God is going to give it to you hold to
[32:19] it so let's close with these words
[32:22] prayer is the greatest of all forces
[32:24] evil are conquered by the power of God
[32:27] through prayer
[32:28] prayer is the weapon given to the Saints
[32:31] prayer is resistance to pray is to
[32:35] confront Satan to defy his claims and to
[32:38] reject his lies Satan trembles when he
[32:40] sees the weakest Saint upon their knees
[32:43] let's bow our heads heavenly father I
[32:45] thank you tonight for your precious
[32:47] people here goiv and I pray you would
[32:50] visit them those who pray for their sons
[32:52] daughters children and they give up
[32:54] because they seeing with their eyes from
[32:56] a carnal natural position that nothing
[32:58] has changed the children are the same
[33:01] way same behavior same attitude but may
[33:03] they reject what their eyes see may they
[33:06] reject the Lord just being they're
[33:09] thinking that they're being repetitive
[33:11] but may they hold on and believe that
[33:13] they're going to pray again they're
[33:15] going to pray once more like how Samson
[33:17] said once more may it be special tonight
[33:20] may this prayer session tonight be a
[33:22] special present procession of visitation
[33:25] family where you would visit them with
[33:27] this Spirit of prayer and supplication
[33:29] as they cry out as they cry out for
[33:31] deliverance as they cry out for
[33:33] breakthrough as they cry out for their
[33:35] health as they cry for their family as
[33:37] they cry out for others that they will
[33:39] see victory in other lives of the
[33:42] children of your people father there
[33:43] people struggling in church there are
[33:45] families that are struggling we pray for
[33:47] them tonight we pray you would visit
[33:49] them and you would Inspire them and
[33:51] increase their feet sometimes we in a
[33:54] dry spot sometimes we in a dull spot and
[33:57] we hear something and we hear a
[34:00] testimony or hear a song a special
[34:02] something and it inspires us and it
[34:05] brings us in a different atmosphere it
[34:08] happens Lord like when we have the blues
