[53:40] god bless you and welcome had some time
[53:44] and I'm with welcome to Sunday morning
[53:48] feast for the Lord even bring you
[53:51] greetings from Africa region some Ivory
[53:54] Coast and what a time that we had there
[53:59] amen it was a convention just at another
[54:05] level Chile South America was wanting
[54:08] Chile's on fire poor God moving such a
[54:11] mighty way and in Ivory Coast was was
[54:15] was something else it was such a
[54:17] presence and power like we have never
[54:19] experienced before your people that were
[54:22] delivered baptized with the Holy Ghost
[54:24] set free
[54:26] remember in Chile there was this couple
[54:28] that uh that was about a verge of
[54:31] divorce and it was gonna get divorced
[54:33] that very week and the pastor begged
[54:35] them just attend that convention let's
[54:38] give it one more chance but I cut a long
[54:41] story short spread sprague or come down
[54:43] by resentment and they completely
[54:46] delivered
[54:46] no more divorce is fine now all is well
[54:53] and God really raised the anointing it
[54:58] was obvious it was something that God
[55:00] did himself to raise your loins and upon
[55:03] the ministry upon the brothers and what
[55:06] a time and but uh all over the country
[55:10] and my myself share this six services we
[55:13] are to each and the food services
[55:17] firstly we started like a last service
[55:18] as I tell you
[55:20] it's a mountain that was in that place
[55:21] the first service was like a last
[55:23] service but God gave us tremendous
[55:26] victory it was even the most amount of
[55:28] people we haven't had in convention like
[55:30] that so we know the Holy Spirit is
[55:32] moving in a mighty way and it will take
[55:35] and you know something struck you know
[55:38] salvation is free but power is not free
[55:42] power going with character
[55:44] [Music]
[55:49] salvation is free but power is not free
[55:51] so people want power to see the eye
[55:53] right others are wrong Gordon Edwin that
[55:55] God is nothing this kind of show of
[55:57] thing and trial what Guana confirming is
[55:59] is his word so he sent a prophet to
[56:02] bring his word that we could believe it
[56:03] and receive it and let go on come and
[56:05] confirm it in your life and this is the
[56:08] age of maturity where the sons of God
[56:10] have to be ripened that's why the Eden
[56:12] I'm Esav a center right in the sea
[56:14] that's inside of you and we're gonna
[56:18] play back the tapes you have to hear
[56:19] back some of these stuff because I got
[56:21] some real nuggets there and where I'm

[1:01:28] in any man I met many years ago coming
[1:01:31] to this message and we all Catholics and
[1:01:33] Lee
[1:01:33] of course the family complained but it's
[1:01:36] so different now after all these years
[1:01:39] so if you have your Bibles are like a
[1:01:41] turn with me to three portion of
[1:01:42] scriptures from James chapter 2 Romans
[1:01:46] chapter 4 and he boosts tatin from James
[1:01:49] - we wanna read from verse 21 or 26
[1:01:52] Romans 4 wanna read from this one to eat
[1:01:55] eBoost 13:8 title of the message as your
[1:01:59] feet is expressed by your works read in
[1:02:03] James 2 we read was that Abraham our
[1:02:07] Father justified by works when he
[1:02:09] offered Isaac upon his son upon the
[1:02:11] altar see is the whole feet brought with
[1:02:14] works and by works was feet made perfect
[1:02:17] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:02:19] saith abraham believed God and it was
[1:02:22] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:02:24] he was called a friend of God you see
[1:02:26] then how that by works a man is
[1:02:28] justified and not by faith only likewise
[1:02:32] also was not Rahab the harlot justified
[1:02:34] by works when she had received the
[1:02:36] messengers sent him out another way for
[1:02:39] as the body without the Spirit is dead
[1:02:40] so faith without works is dead also
[1:02:44] Romans 4 verse 1 what shall we say then
[1:02:47] that Abraham our Father as pertaining to
[1:02:51] the flesh hath found for if Abraham were
[1:02:53] justified by works yet aware of the
[1:02:55] glory but not before God but what see at
[1:02:58] the SHA
[1:02:59] abraham believed God and was counted
[1:03:02] unto him for righteousness
[1:03:03] now to him that worketh
[1:03:05] is the reward not reckoned of grace but
[1:03:07] of debt but him that worketh not but
[1:03:10] believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:03:14] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:03:17] righteousness even as demon also
[1:03:20] described the blessedness of the man
[1:03:22] unto whom God will impute righteousness
[1:03:24] without works saying blessed are they
[1:03:27] whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins
[1:03:30] are covered blessed is the man to whom
[1:03:33] the Lord will not impute sin last
[1:03:36] Scripture he was sitting in Jesus Christ
[1:03:38] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:40] let's bow our heads with a prayer
[1:03:41] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:03:43] presence and your love on this great
[1:03:45] opportunity in this end time to
[1:03:47] surrender to you surrender Allah or
[1:03:50] father may come down in your world and
[1:03:52] breed upon your word and breed upon your
[1:03:55] people take me out of the way and
[1:03:56] confirm it with signs wonders and
[1:03:58] miracles we have a scripture Lord the
[1:04:00] Lord Himself went everywhere with them
[1:04:02] confirming the word father there are so
[1:04:05] many sick believers everywhere around
[1:04:07] the world and even right here Oh God has
[1:04:10] a great need for divine healing miracle
[1:04:12] working power under restoration virtue
[1:04:15] of God to come amongst the people won't
[1:04:18] to ride a tree once more
[1:04:20] granted father and heal your people in
[1:04:22] Jesus and we ask it amen amen
[1:04:24] you may be seated oh praise God thank
[1:04:27] you lord
[1:04:33] and Friends I'm getting not kind of
[1:04:36] burden to see sick people really be
[1:04:39] delivered set free there's a burden
[1:04:41] there's a everywhere you see it all all
[1:04:44] wrong where we go there's so much sick
[1:04:46] christian sick people walk on a sickness
[1:04:48] cancer tumor all manner of sickness and
[1:04:51] jesus release power to handle all manner
[1:04:54] of sickness and all manner of the
[1:04:57] reasons so we have to get right back
[1:04:59] there because that's what goers in a
[1:05:01] profit to turn our hearts back to the
[1:05:03] feet of the father not the talk of the
[1:05:06] father's but the feet of the furnace not
[1:05:09] the argument of the father's not the
[1:05:11] debate of the father's but the defeat of
[1:05:13] the father's so this morning your feet
[1:05:16] is expressed by your works and we know
[1:05:21] the Scriptures this is from Mexico works
[1:05:23] if it's expressed and Berta Brannan
[1:05:26] explained that is not conflicting the
[1:05:29] scriptures but is one is what man sees
[1:05:32] and one is what God sees so man see your
[1:05:35] works and God see your feet another
[1:05:38] inspiration the Holy Spirit that we have
[1:05:41] worked in a small measure a siscon from
[1:05:44] Chile this is right in me this is one
[1:05:46] Berman says the dynamics of this church
[1:05:48] will be a refiller of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:49] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:05:53] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:05:56] unite with the body so Gordo and expect
[1:05:59] us to sit down and just wheat know we
[1:06:03] have to work with the measure that God
[1:06:05] give us while you're waitin on dynamics
[1:06:08] why the written on the headstone to come
[1:06:11] down to your night with the body God
[1:06:13] given you a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:15] God given you a deposit God given you a
[1:06:18] downpayment go out giving you something
[1:06:20] that you could work with not to get
[1:06:21] three with that you go to overcome with
[1:06:23] that if it's can wait a power coming
[1:06:25] through your system while you're waitin
[1:06:27] for the fullness of what is promised for
[1:06:29] this hour you give us something to work
[1:06:30] with not to be lazy with the work with
[1:06:33] not to sleep away with to work with what
[1:06:37] you believe that amen so the dynamics is
[1:06:41] the Holy Spirit
[1:06:42] I already this morning ready for the
[1:06:45] word yeah look nobody sleeping all right

[1:14:38] deliverance as yours
[1:14:39] rich you as yours
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:46] not a vision and this is missing former
[1:14:49] what is the vision and Berta Brannan was
[1:14:51] told not to see nothing about what the
[1:14:54] Lord tell him what to do he did it
[1:14:55] explained to ministers and so on how to
[1:14:57] fish and he either was teaching him and
[1:15:01] as we move into the realm of the spirit
[1:15:03] there the lessons that we have to learn
[1:15:05] there the instructions that we have to
[1:15:08] follow because we have not been this way
[1:15:10] before so there's a new process because
[1:15:13] David didn't just go and feels Goliath
[1:15:15] he had been lion now was it treinen to
[1:15:18] face Goliath
[1:15:19] so whatever droppable at and you he has
[1:15:22] to give you the training to take it from
[1:15:24] phase 1 to phase 2 from phase 2 to phase
[1:15:27] 3 to deal with your issues and that is
[1:15:30] why I say go take adopted sons the back
[1:15:32] of the Philistines they thought I can
[1:15:35] check beside them as easy ones but this
[1:15:37] fella senses them is big-time demons so
[1:15:43] you need a little more power to deal
[1:15:45] with them guys call these Philistines
[1:15:47] like them personal demons terrorizing
[1:15:50] you but they have the backup yeah hasta
[1:15:54] back up because becoming to know who we
[1:15:56] are and who we are
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:02] [Applause]
[1:16:03] all glory of God don't touch don't touch
[1:16:06] God sons that's not my anointed and do
[1:16:10] my prophets don't go there don't go
[1:16:12] there
[1:16:13] not in this new season the water that's

[1:16:42] me it was him the angel of the Lord he
[1:16:45] had his hands folded he looked at me
[1:16:48] just what I told you not to do I said
[1:16:51] yes that's right he said you see that
[1:16:54] first pearl was when you used to put
[1:16:56] your hands on the people tell them what
[1:16:58] there was there trouble he said the
[1:17:00] second pull is when you know the secrets
[1:17:02] of the heart like I told you and instead
[1:17:04] of you keeping that to yourself you try
[1:17:06] to explain all about it and tell the
[1:17:07] people and when you did said you didn't
[1:17:11] know nothing about it yourself how could
[1:17:13] you explain it they not man talking out
[1:17:17] is the angel talking to him you ain't
[1:17:19] even know about it yourself how you can
[1:17:21] explain it how could you explain it and
[1:17:25] you caused a big bunch of colonel
[1:17:27] impersonation to rise up you see what
[1:17:29] you have done I said so Lord I'm sorry I
[1:17:31] said I'm so sorry I don't know what to
[1:17:34] do and I was pulling the line like this
[1:17:36] I was trying to straighten my line out
[1:17:38] he looked at me and said no don't get
[1:17:40] your line tying it up in these kind of
[1:17:43] times and I thought well maybe he's
[1:17:46] gonna give me another try and I said
[1:17:48] I'll sure be careful I was winding my
[1:17:51] line in unseen taking all up right and
[1:17:55] when he said I just felt myself go
[1:17:57] higher so now was this was one level and
[1:18:00] then got break him at the next level now
[1:18:02] he goes higher listen to this now and I
[1:18:06] was sat down and was beneath standing
[1:18:09] above a great tent I never seen such a
[1:18:12] tent and I just made an altar call seem
[1:18:15] like dung at the altar when I was young
[1:18:17] there I looked there were hundreds of
[1:18:19] people standing around the altar weeping
[1:18:21] because they were accepted the Lord
[1:18:23] Jesus and they were just weeping out
[1:18:25] loud I said oh that's more like it
[1:18:27] and a real kind gentleman walk off to
[1:18:29] the platform and said while butter
[1:18:31] bottom is resting for a few moments he
[1:18:33] said we will call a prayer
[1:18:34] never want my prayer cards beginning
[1:18:36] with a certain number sound over on the
[1:18:38] right
[1:18:38] I noticed the prayer line seemed like it
[1:18:41] went all re wrong the tenth and looked
[1:18:42] on the street was a prayer line and I
[1:18:45] looked which was to my left then okay
[1:18:48] there was a piece of canvas stretched
[1:18:50] behind this canvas was a little square
[1:18:54] buildin about twelve foot across 20 foot
[1:18:57] long something like that and I still had
[1:18:59] look at that so he's seen in a vision
[1:19:02] he's in a building about 20 by 12 foot
[1:19:05] across I see them bringing a lady on a
[1:19:08] stretcher there was a lady taking a name
[1:19:11] and things on the people and someone
[1:19:13] come and got her and push a true and the
[1:19:16] next man come true with crutches and I
[1:19:19] see them go to that at the building and
[1:19:21] on the outside the lady come out
[1:19:24] screamin to the top of a boy's cushion
[1:19:26] is this stretcher and then there was
[1:19:28] another lady on the other side looked
[1:19:30] like some dark here woman said what
[1:19:31] happened she said I don't know she said
[1:19:34] I couldn't tell you what happened
[1:19:35] I've been paralyzed for 20 years and I
[1:19:38] feel like I was never was sick and then
[1:19:42] I'll come the man leaping and jumping
[1:19:45] with his crutches in his hand and then
[1:19:48] notice no there's a difference between
[1:19:50] the angel of the Lord and that light
[1:19:52] because I heard something moving that it
[1:19:54] comes on a platform and the fire
[1:19:57] whipping around and that audience went
[1:19:59] over and went over to the top of that in
[1:20:01] the building so the pillar of fire went
[1:20:04] over the top of the building and then
[1:20:06] settle on top of it and when it did this
[1:20:09] voice that was telling me said the same
[1:20:11] voice the angels voice he said I'll meet
[1:20:14] you in there and this is the temple and
[1:20:17] nobody will know nothing about it I said
[1:20:21] well I don't understand why India why
[1:20:23] dear he said it wouldn't be a public
[1:20:26] show this time I said I don't understand
[1:20:30] going into that closet like that and he
[1:20:33] said now watch this this is a vision and
[1:20:35] look how the angel gonna put the vision
[1:20:37] in the world he's a tall honest I'm this
[1:20:40] closet
[1:20:40] he said no what he said is not yet
[1:20:43] written by
[1:20:44] Lord window Prius be not like the
[1:20:47] hypocrites who like to be heard before
[1:20:49] men but enter into the secret closet and
[1:20:53] pray to the father who see it in secret
[1:20:57] and he who sees in secret shall reward
[1:21:01] thee openly
[1:21:02] it's perfectly to the scripture every
[1:21:05] time and then I said I understand then
[1:21:08] he took me to a place set me down in
[1:21:10] this room where I was at then he told me
[1:21:13] what to do for the to time so this
[1:21:15] vision so if we might think in not
[1:21:18] comparing or not connecting but you're
[1:21:19] getting dots together connected but this
[1:21:22] vision of this little room the angels
[1:21:25] sink it right back into the scripture
[1:21:27] when you pray go in your closet and the
[1:21:31] father who see it in secret going to
[1:21:35] reward you not in secret but openly say
[1:21:38] openly openly so if you want the open
[1:21:42] blessing you have to go in the secret
[1:21:44] closet we call another a table closet

[2:17:57] [Music]
[2:17:58] [Applause]
[2:18:03] maybe season my god when the Bible
[2:18:08] teaches it and I hold the fate of key in
[2:18:10] my hand or in my heart that says that
[2:18:13] God's would that's that's God's Word
[2:18:15] I will quench the violence of fire it
[2:18:17] will unlock the healing for the sick it
[2:18:19] will unlock salvation to the Lost
[2:18:20] I have come to the door everything is
[2:18:22] his name whatever you do in word or deed
[2:18:24] do all in the name of Jesus knowing that
[2:18:27] that key that you've got his fate
[2:18:28] because the scripture made key all glory
[2:18:32] to God they escaped the edge of the
[2:18:34] sword they quench the fire because they
[2:18:37] had the key in their hand that great
[2:18:40] feat Oh glory to God
[2:18:43] let's continue I already could you take
[2:18:46] some more are you inspired this morning
[2:18:49] are you challenged this morning
[2:18:51] listen to this but at random and this is
[2:18:55] a message faith believe it is see this
[2:18:59] Fitness substance business all right you
[2:19:01] know you see what it is is something
[2:19:03] now look friends I knew that all of you
[2:19:05] at least notice this body is controlled
[2:19:07] by five senses is that right it's got
[2:19:09] five senses and everything that controls
[2:19:11] the human body so we know CTS smell
[2:19:12] touch and feel there's our five senses
[2:19:14] of the Spirit conscience imagination
[2:19:16] affection memory and reason and so on
[2:19:18] all right Sophia is a sixth sense known
[2:19:21] to some people and they want to call it
[2:19:23] as mental telepathy and so on like that
[2:19:24] he said but to me it is a feat and it is
[2:19:27] above all the five senses in a human
[2:19:30] body
[2:19:30] okay bear at me now faith here we go is
[2:19:32] the only direct and positive sense it is
[2:19:36] the sixth sense
[2:19:37] faith is more than sight
[2:19:43] [Applause]
[2:19:45] see it is more than feelings you do not
[2:19:49] feel fit you do not test fit you do not
[2:19:52] smell fate you don't see if it say it is
[2:19:55] the substance of things hoped for the
[2:19:58] evidence of things not seen this faith
[2:20:01] is more real than sight because when
[2:20:06] your eyes already see it see a way made
[2:20:12] under way made in the Red Sea is better
[2:20:16] than the sight of seeing the sea right
[2:20:18] there

[2:40:41] showing him he believed it but when he
[2:40:43] went to act him I thought it was already
[2:40:46] done - what man saw when it ran the
