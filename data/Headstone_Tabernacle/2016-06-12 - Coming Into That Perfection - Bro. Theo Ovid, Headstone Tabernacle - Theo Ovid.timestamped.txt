[19:30] Hallelujah.
[19:32] Jesus.
[19:35] Jesus. He's
[19:41] working.
[19:43] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[19:59] Father, we worship you. Father, we bless
[20:02] your name. Father, we glorify your name.
[20:05] You're worthy this morning. Thank you
[20:07] for your presence. Thank you for your
[20:10] power. Thank you for your love. Oh,
[20:13] praise God. you love him this morning.
[20:17] Oh, praise God. We want to go straight
[20:19] into the word. So, if you have your
[20:21] Bibles, I like you to turn to Ephesians
[20:22] chapter 4, Hebrews chapter 6, Matthew
[20:26] chapter
[20:33] 19.
[20:35] Jesus on the
[20:37] inside, working on the outside. The
[20:41] secret is the word Jesus is in the
[20:44] bride.
[20:46] Amen. Ephesians chapter 4 want to read
[20:49] from verse 11 to
[20:55] 13. And he gives some apostles and some
[20:58] prophets and some past evangelists and
[21:01] some pastors and
[21:02] teachers for the perfecting of the
[21:05] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[21:07] for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[21:09] till we all come into the unity of the
[21:11] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[21:13] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[21:18] of the stature of the fullness of
[21:20] Christ. Hebrews
[21:24] 11, Hebrews 6 rather,
[21:28] sorry verse one. Therefore, leaving the
[21:32] principles of the doctrine of
[21:34] Christ, let us
[21:36] go on unto perfection. Yes, sir. Not
[21:40] laying again the foundation of
[21:42] repentance from dead works and of faith
[21:45] towards God. Our final scripture from
[21:48] Matthew chapter 19. We want to read from
[21:50] verse 16 to
[22:01] 22. And
[22:03] behold, one came and said unto him, Good
[22:08] Master, what good thing shall I do that
[22:11] I may have eternal
[22:13] life? And he said unto him, why callst
[22:16] thou me good? There is none good but one
[22:20] that is God. But if thou wil enter into
[22:23] life, keep the commandments. He said
[22:25] unto him,
[22:26] which Jesus said, thou shalt do no
[22:29] murder. Thou shalt commit and not do not
[22:31] not commit adultery. Thou shalt not
[22:33] steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness
[22:35] on thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt
[22:37] love thy neighbor as
[22:39] thyself. The young man saith unto him,
[22:42] All these things I have kept from my
[22:44] youth up. what lack I
[22:48] yet? And Jesus said unto him, If thou
[22:51] will be
[22:52] perfect, go and sell what thou hast, and
[22:55] give to the poor, and thou shalt have
[22:58] treasure in heaven, and come follow me."
[23:01] And when the young man heard that
[23:03] saying, he went away sorrowful, for he
[23:06] had great possessions. Let's pray.
[23:07] Father, we thank you for your word this
[23:10] morning. Such a blessing to be in your
[23:12] house and in your presence and to feel
[23:14] your spirit. Father, come among your
[23:17] people and speak. Bring life, Lord. The
[23:19] spirit is what bring the word to life.
[23:22] For the letter killth, but the spirit
[23:24] giveth life. And we pray this morning
[23:26] that life be given out here this morning
[23:29] to the hearts of the hearers. Lord, may
[23:31] their lives be transformed. That that
[23:33] song over the change would be a reality.
[23:37] Father bless those who will be connected
[23:39] to us this morning and those who would
[23:42] hear the tape. May your presence be with
[23:44] each one of us Lord in Jesus name we ask
[23:46] it. Amen and amen. You may be seated.
[23:49] Well we greet you in the precious name
[23:51] of Jesus. Hallelujah. You are here and
[23:53] those connected to us on the internet.
[23:55] God bless you. Welcome to our Sunday
[23:57] morning service. Hallelujah. Where we
[24:00] feast around the word of God. Amen.
[24:02] Where we come to get empowered. We come
[24:05] to get edified and strengthened and
[24:07] built up. We come to get fortified. You
[24:10] come to get refueled,
[24:12] retoled. You got to get some fresh
[24:14] bullets for the battle that is launching
[24:16] that the devil out there. All the
[24:18] bullets you shoot and miss and hit and
[24:20] some, you lose some. You come to get
[24:22] refuelled.
[24:23] You got to get recharged. That's what
[24:25] you come to church for. You don't come
[24:27] to occupy a pew. You really come to
[24:29] church to get recharged. So this morning
[24:31] I have something up on my heart and uh
[24:34] all of this is in we going down towards
[24:37] the convention coming up and this is all
[24:40] this is preparation mode to get our
[24:42] hearts and our spirits where we want to
[24:44] be where we should be. Amen. And
[24:47] remember as you can make it out to the
[24:49] Thursday prayer meeting don't fail to do
[24:51] so come out Tuesday right here in the
[24:53] tabernacle.
[24:55] So this morning I have a title coming
[24:58] into that
[25:00] perfection. That's the title. Amen.
[25:03] Coming into that perfection. Amen. I
[25:05] have an inspiration. Let us go on to
[25:08] perfection. Amen. And have a team
[25:11] prophecy and process. Amen. Don't let
[25:14] that frighten you too much. PP prophecy
[25:19] and process. I have a context scripture
[25:22] from Luke 8:14. It reads, "And that
[25:25] which fell among thorns," talking about
[25:27] the seed parable, "Are they when they
[25:30] have heard go forth and are choked with
[25:35] cares and riches and pleasures of this
[25:40] life and bring no fruit to perfection."
[25:45] Amen. That's my context scripture.
[25:48] So this is a certain class because this
[25:51] class growing. Yes. This is not dead
[25:53] wayside people. This is people that
[25:56] springing up saying hallelujah. Saying
[25:59] amen. Read the Bible now and again.
[26:03] Or read the Bible when the pastor say,
[26:04] "Oh, turn your Bible to open the
[26:06] scriptures."
[26:10] These are people that lukewarm. Yes.
[26:15] Sometime on fire, sometime they're not.
[26:16] up and down, in and out, but they let
[26:20] things choke them. Bible identify three
[26:23] specific thing. Cares, which is
[26:25] legitimate.
[26:27] Car is not illegal.
[26:30] Yes. You have to carry out the garbage.
[26:33] That's right. You have to clean the
[26:35] yard. Come on now. At least supposed to
[26:39] make up a bed. I'm not going there. But
[26:42] cares. You have children to care for,
[26:44] grandchildren to care for, whatever. You
[26:46] have cares of life legitimate.
[26:51] But you see, you have to have a passion
[26:53] for God.
[26:55] That even though you're taking out the
[26:56] garbage, you're taking back, but the
[26:58] anointed,
[26:59] you're inspired. Your heart is
[27:02] hungering.
[27:03] Hallelujah. You want to worship, you
[27:05] want to call upon the name of the Lord.
[27:08] Praise God. You're focused. And you have
[27:10] a passion for God. Hallelujah.
[27:12] Hallelujah. You're not letting the cares
[27:15] take you over. It's cares, riches, and
[27:19] pleasures.
[27:21] Well, riches that take people over,
[27:22] knock them over flat, horizontal. Yes.
[27:24] Clean. Because when they have riches,
[27:27] they don't even need God. They want a
[27:30] car, they buy a car, they want a house,
[27:31] they buy a house, they want a
[27:32] helicopter, to buy a helicopter, they
[27:34] want a plane, they want a jet, they want
[27:36] anything, they want to buy it. They
[27:38] could buy it. They pay for a doctor. pay
[27:40] anything you want afterwards. They they
[27:42] wish they could pay for God
[27:45] riches. But all these things have a
[27:47] choking effect because the what God put
[27:50] in our hearts is to cry after him. So
[27:53] anything stifling that cry, it can't be
[27:56] God. There have to be a deep in you
[27:59] thirsting and hungering whether you are
[28:02] king or whether you a lowly peasant
[28:05] because that didn't stop David from
[28:07] saying as the heart p after the water
[28:08] broke. So my soul thirst after the
[28:11] living God. Hallelujah. That that can't
[28:14] stop you because you're this, you are
[28:15] that. You can't worship. You can't
[28:17] praise God because you get a new dress
[28:19] and you don't want your your ties swing
[28:21] this way. So you had to be very careful
[28:24] because your jacket now pressed this
[28:26] morning and you don't want your jacket
[28:28] get disturbed. You can't be in that. You
[28:31] want to be like David. When David see
[28:33] the ark coming along the road, David
[28:35] begin to dance and his hoyy doy wife
[28:39] trying to put pressure on him to behave
[28:41] himself. How you could behave yourself
[28:44] when the king is coming in power. How
[28:46] you could behave yourself when the lamb
[28:49] took the book. How you could behave
[28:51] yourself when your deliverance is at
[28:53] hand.
[29:00] [Applause]
[29:02] Hallelujah.
[29:04] You may be seated. You're Your
[29:07] hand Your fingers start to move
[29:09] and you're supposed to behave yourself.
[29:11] Your foot paralyzed and your toe start
[29:13] to move and you expect me just watch the
[29:15] toe moving. Oh, your toe moving. You've
[29:18] got to be crazy. Hallelujah. You once
[29:21] was blind and God open one eye and you
[29:24] just say, "Oh, God, my eye open. One eye
[29:26] open." Come on. You had to rejoice.
[29:29] Praise God. You have to thank him in
[29:30] advance for what he's about to do. He's
[29:33] about to deliver. He's about to set the
[29:35] people free. Oh yes. Oh
[29:39] yes. Not less power. More power. Every
[29:45] service more
[29:47] power. Oh hallelujah.
[29:50] [Applause]
[29:53] Hallelujah. You may be seated. Those
[29:57] demons will be telling each other time
[29:58] to leave, time to leave, time to leave,
[30:00] time to leave, time to leave. They have
[30:02] to leave. And my name shall cast them
[30:05] out. Oh, glory to God. Those spirits

[33:15] all the church world going to be shaken
[33:18] what's happening a bride is coming into
[33:21] that
[33:24] [Applause]
[33:25] perfection oh

[33:30] perfect is come
[33:32] go over pat part is accepted until
[33:37] are you not hearing what I'm saying part
[33:40] is okay until but when that which is
[33:43] perfect is come don't bring part you
[33:46] better bring perfection
[33:50] oh are you with me now do you see it
[33:54] when they had gathered together all the
[33:55] chief priests scribes and Pharisees
[33:57] gathered together so now they gathered
[33:59] together because they hear something he
[34:01] demanded of them where Christ should be
[34:04] born
[34:06] now they this that should be the top of
[34:08] the town They should have known that
[34:10] because they had all the quotes. They
[34:12] had Moses scrolls. They had all the
[34:14] word. They had 400 years to talk about
[34:16] Moses said and Moses said and the
[34:18] prophecy said,
[34:21] "But now at the man come tell me where
[34:22] he was supposed to be born."
[34:26] And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of
[34:28] Judea, for thus it is written by the
[34:30] prophet." They quote in scripture. Now
[34:32] you find me quote. You find me quote. We
[34:34] play it here. and thou Bethlehem in the
[34:36] land of Judah at now the least of the
[34:38] princes of Judah for out of le shall
[34:40] come a governor that's shall my people
[34:41] Israel
[34:43] [Applause]
[34:46] that is the prophecy yes amen amen now
[34:49] let's look at the process
[34:54] and it came to pass in those days that
[34:56] they went out a decree is a Luke chapter
[34:59] 2 1-5 from Caesar Augustus that all the
[35:02] world should be taxed yes taxed Yes.
[35:12] And this taxing was first made by
[35:13] Sirenius, governor of Syria, and all
[35:16] went to be taxed, everyone in his own
[35:18] city. And Joseph also went up from
[35:21] Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into
[35:25] Judea into the city of David which is
[35:28] called Bethlehem to be taxed with Mary
[35:32] his exposed wife being great with child.
[35:36] So the prophecy say Jesus going to be
[35:38] born in Bethlehem
[35:40] but Mary is not in Bethlehem.
[35:43] How does the prophecy fulfilled? Tell
[35:45] us. Tell us. What is the process? All
[35:49] right. That takes it to fulfillment. All
[35:52] right. Hallelujah. It's one thing to
[35:53] know the prophecy, but what about the
[35:55] process? The process means taxation.
[36:00] They talk the process means order have
[36:02] to come down to get Mary to move from
[36:04] that position to your position. What
[36:07] about the prophecy over your life?
[36:10] [Applause]
[36:14] to every prophecy. Here we go. There's a
[36:17] process. Come give the Lord a shout in
[36:19] the house.
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:25] Hallelujah.
[36:28] Amen. Prophecy John 20:21. Jesus said
[36:31] unto them, "Peace be unto you. As my
[36:33] father sent me, even so send you." And
[36:35] when he had said this, he breathed on
[36:37] them, "Receive you the Holy Ghost."
[36:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:47] Prophecy. Receive the Holy Ghost.
[36:50] Somebody walk testimony. He told me
[36:52] receive the Holy Ghost. He didn't tell
[36:53] them you are the Holy Ghost. He tell
[36:55] receive the Holy Ghost.
[36:58] Amen. But look at the process.
[37:01] Luke 24:49 says, "And behold, I send the
[37:04] promise of my father upon you, but carry
[37:06] ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be
[37:10] endued with power from on high." And he
[37:14] led them far as to Bethany, lifted up
[37:16] his hands, blessed them, and it came to
[37:19] pass while he blessed them, he was
[37:21] parted from them, and carried up into
[37:23] heaven, and they worshiped and returned
[37:25] to Jerusalem with great joy. and they
[37:27] were continually in the temple praising
[37:30] and blessing God. That was the process.
[37:34] It can't be power coming down and you
[37:37] don't part of the process. It can't be
[37:38] you want to pass your exams and you're
[37:40] not studying because studying is part of
[37:42] the process to be successful in your
[37:44] examination. It cannot be you looking
[37:46] for a job and you sit at home, you are
[37:48] lying to yourself. You're not looking
[37:50] for a job staying home. No, you can't be
[37:53] looking for a promotion and you're not
[37:55] trying to improve your skill set.
[37:58] There is a process for you to go higher.
[38:02] For you to go further. Hallelujah.
[38:06] Oh, glory. Give the Lord a shout.
[38:13] Amen. They could understand way that
[38:16] they happened to the sea just fall on
[38:19] them. So they could come one service and
[38:21] afterwards you see them again. They
[38:23] rejoice as if you can understand one of
[38:25] the rock they shout up a little bit
[38:27] glory hallelujah they no roots so the
[38:31] sun hit them so they gone
[38:34] but the last two is very interesting
[38:38] let's deal with the very last one those
[38:40] that fell on good ground you don't have
[38:42] to worry about them they breaking out
[38:44] they pushing out they have something
[38:46] inside of them a sense of purpose sense
[38:49] of destiny going only watch them have
[38:51] problem touching
[38:53] They are different breed all together.
[38:55] Hallelujah. They're just different. They
[38:57] just take the kingdom by violence.
[38:59] Violent take it by force. They have no
[39:02] you can't say no for an answer. They
[39:04] just make the no become yes because they
[39:07] will knock and keep on knocking. They
[39:08] will ask and keep on asking. Oh, come on
[39:11] now. Give the Lord some praises. They're
[39:13] different kind of people all together.
[39:15] That that's a good ground kind of
[39:16] people. They just don't care what the
[39:19] neighbors say, what the people say, what
[39:21] others say. They don't care. What they
[39:23] care about is what God said.
[39:26] [Applause]
[39:32] Hallelujah.
[39:34] Oh, glory to God. I love it. Hallelujah.
[39:37] Going against the system of things.
[39:41] There some people like to go with the
[39:42] tide. Water flowing so they going with
[39:44] it too.
[39:49] End up like a
[39:50] driftwood. Just where the water take you
[39:53] your land, where life take you and
[39:55] something always do. You
[39:59] there's always an excuse why you are
[40:01] where you are, how you are. You never in
[40:04] control.
[40:05] Never determine what your actions going
[40:07] to be. All right. That's not how it
[40:09] going to be at all. That's how God train
[40:11] his sons and his servants. Look at God
[40:12] tell Joshua. Joshua was no no man.
[40:15] Joshua don't know all the things ahead.
[40:17] God God have no time to waste. That what
[40:19] I like about him, you know. He's not a
[40:21] wasting time. God, he said, "Moses, my
[40:23] servant, is dead." Now, Joshua, take
[40:25] them people over. Every place you put
[40:27] your foot is yours.
[40:30] No man shall be able, this is God
[40:32] talking to Joshua. No man shall be able
[40:34] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[40:36] life. As I was with Moses, so I will be
[40:39] with you. I will not fail you, nor
[40:41] forsake you, but I'll be with you. Just
[40:44] meditate on the word day and night that
[40:46] you will have good success.
[40:50] This book of the law must
[40:56] depart. Success is
[40:59] guaranteed. I am your guaranter.
[41:04] Oh, help me Jesus. Help me Jesus.
[41:07] [Applause]
[41:13] No man. Shall we stand before thee? All
[41:16] the days of you know I like our God is a
[41:19] awesome God. They cross Jordan and the
[41:23] first trial
[41:26] first thing they going to see is
[41:28] Jericho.
[41:30] Why God didn't give
[41:31] them some land to cut down with brush
[41:35] and cut last or something. Why God
[41:38] didn't get them? Sometimes not easy with
[41:40] a bow and arrow and
[41:44] just God loose them and make them pick
[41:47] one big ball and and Joshua had to shake
[41:51] his head and good Lord have mercy. Did
[41:54] you see that wall said char on the wall?
[41:58] Those guys are fortified, but they're
[42:00] trembling
[42:03] because they
[42:05] heard about the God of Israel. They
[42:08] heard about great exploits.
[42:14] Oh, if you think I'm here just to be
[42:16] standing behind this pulpit and talking
[42:18] talking, you are wrong.
[42:20] The whole creation has grown in four.
[42:23] Not not more preachers, not more
[42:25] talkers, not more explainers and
[42:28] teachers. We had 40 years of
[42:32] that. The creation is groaning for the
[42:38] manifestation of the sons of
[42:44] God. You may be seated. Thank God Joshua
[42:47] is Joshua. When you see the wall, you
[42:49] didn't faint, put up and fall right back
[42:51] and knock out coal for 6 hours. I said I
[42:55] don't know cuz this is a first time
[42:56] first time testing of his leadership.
[42:59] Joshua sen sword praying in his heart
[43:02] how to take this how to take this I have
[43:04] to take it. I ain't passing around it. I
[43:06] ain't I ain't going around it. I ain't
[43:07] going no way. If I can't take this then
[43:09] I finish. You told me every place I put
[43:12] my foot is yours. I've got to take this.
[43:15] This demon have to leave. This spirit
[43:17] have to leave. This sickness have to
[43:19] leave. This condition have to leave. I'm
[43:21] not moving till something happen. I'm
[43:24] not moving. I'm not moving. I am not
[43:26] moving. God, you told me you will not
[43:30] forsake me. I'm waiting on you. Oh, get
[43:33] the Lord. I shout in the house.
[43:39] [Applause]
[43:50] You may be seated to show you how on
[43:52] point that man Joshua was at. He had a
[43:55] rustling. He had a man moving.
[43:58] Immediately throw a sword. Are you for
[44:00] us or are you against us? Are you
[44:02] playing in this hour? Come on now. I
[44:04] want to know where you stand. Tell me
[44:06] where you stand. Glory to God.
[44:09] Hallelujah. I am trained, sword up, and
[44:14] I'm ready to go. Oh, give the Lord some
[44:17] praises, people. We're not walking
[44:19] without our sword. Every service, we
[44:21] have our sword.
[44:27] That man said, "Put away your sword."
[44:30] I'm the captain
[44:31] of the host, the Lord's host.
[44:34] Joshua, bow down. Hallelujah. And
[44:37] worship. Bow down. Why? because he know
[44:41] the man who the main man come to give
[44:42] instructions.
[44:44] Tell him this is the process.
[44:46] Hallelujah.
[44:49] You're going to take it. But there's a
[44:51] process to take it. You have to walk
[44:54] around Jericho. Don't look at the walls.
[44:58] Keep your head down on the ground. Just
[44:59] keep walking. Keep keep walking. Keep
[45:01] walking. Don't look at your child. Just
[45:03] keep walking. Don't walk. Don't look at
[45:05] your family condition. Just keep
[45:06] walking. Don't look at your sickness.
[45:08] Just keep walking. Don't let the
[45:10] sickness frighten you. Don't let the
[45:11] condition frighten you. Don't let the
[45:13] bills frighten you. Don't let what don't
[45:15] let that frighten you. You're going to
[45:17] take it. You're going to possess it.
[45:19] Because I told Abraham, "Thy seed shall
[45:24] possess the gates of the enemy." Oh,
[45:28] give the Lord some praises, people.
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:47] My God, I feel like dancing this
[45:49] morning. Oh yes, I feel like shouting

[46:09] Now watch. You may be seated. We talking
[46:12] about process. As Joshua got
[46:14] instructions, he had to pass those
[46:17] instructions to the people. Don't break
[46:19] rank. Listen for instructions.
[46:22] That is why you can't stay home and play
[46:24] a tape and get this. That is why the
[46:26] Bible said don't forsake the assembling
[46:28] of yourself together as some of the man
[46:30] is. They got to come in church to get a
[46:33] word rightly divided and a man of God
[46:36] preach it real present tense to you. Oh
[46:39] give the Lord some praises
[46:41] [Applause]

[46:50] of the process. You're going to walk
[46:53] around seven times. Seven times. Six
[46:55] times. Seven times on the seven days.
[46:57] seven times because there are seven
[46:59] seals and there are seven thunders. It's
[47:01] not seven seals alone. You have seven
[47:03] thunders after that. If you walk on
[47:05] seven times, you'll get tired.
[47:07] Hallelujah. You have seven more times on
[47:09] the seventh day to represent seven
[47:12] living voices. That's the tunnel going
[47:14] to shake the devil. It's not enough to
[47:16] walk around seven times. You got to walk
[47:19] around seven times on the seventh day.
[47:22] That's when the devil kingdom going to

[47:58] your mouth and give God some praises.
[48:05] [Applause]
[48:11] God told Joshua what to do. Can you
[48:14] imagine those people looking down first
[48:15] day? They walk around and say, "Okay,
[48:18] okay. Who is that?"
[48:21] Amen. No cannon. You know cannon ball

[49:51] walkway to walk around.
[49:54] The only thing that that interrupt them
[49:56] is what happened the seventh day. When
[49:58] the first walk finish and they recognize
[49:59] they walking again, they say again,
[50:04] this is the different day. Yes, it is a
[50:07] different day. It's a day of your
[50:09] deliverance. It's a day of your victory.
[50:12] It's a day when you're going to go free.
[50:14] It is a different day. Therefore, we
[50:16] have to make a different walk. Oh yes,
[50:19] we taking a different
[50:20] [Applause]
[50:26] turn. Maybe
[50:29] sees and we know the story when they
[50:31] walk seven time they begin to shout the
[50:33] walls come down. Victory. Yes. Victory.
[50:37] Yes. How many want to get victory?
[50:40] Victory over the enemy. Victory over
[50:42] your Goliath. Victory over them
[50:44] Philistine. You got to get You will get
[50:46] it. You must get it. Come on now. The
[50:50] people that know their
[50:51] God shall be strong and do great
[50:56] exploits. I'm not here to tell you how
[50:58] weak you are. No, no, no. I'm not to
[51:00] sympathize with you how weak you are,
[51:03] how struggling you are, and how the
[51:05] devil beat you down. I'm not here to
[51:07] talk that kind of talk. I'm here to tell
[51:09] you how strong you are and greater is he
[51:12] that is in you that he trying to stop
[51:15] you. I here to tell you there is a liar.
[51:18] He's a bluffer in front of your cell.
[51:21] Push the gate. Push the gate. The bad
[51:24] luck is not there. You can break out.
[51:28] You can get out. You can step out. Yes,
[51:31] you are. You can make a difference this
[51:33] morning.
[51:35] [Applause]
[51:42] Hallelujah. May be seated.
[51:47] I doubt very much I would be able to
[51:50] finish this list today.
[51:53] So serve your notice one time to be
[51:57] continued. Amen. Next week if we go.
[52:02] Now
[52:04] God is not just concerned
[52:08] about you getting to the finish line
[52:12] but how you get there
[52:17] because some people take shortcuts. Yes.
[52:23] Whoa.
[52:25] 1 Corinthians 9 24-27 states, "Know ye
[52:30] not that they which run in a race run
[52:33] all, but one receiveth the prize?" So
[52:36] run that you may obtain.
[52:40] And every man that striveth for the
[52:42] mastery is temporate in all things. Now
[52:45] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[52:47] crown, but we are incorruptible.
[52:49] Therefore, I This is Paul now. This is
[52:51] not I talking bad about
[52:53] Paul. This is Paul giving his own
[52:55] testimony. All right. Amen. This is
[52:57] Paul's testimony. Could we say amen?
[53:00] Amen. Paul say I therefore so run.
[53:06] Not as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[53:09] that beat the air but I I Paul I keep my
[53:15] body and bring it into subjection. Amen.
[53:19] This is processed now
[53:23] to get to the end product of the race to
[53:24] win this race.
[53:26] Amen. I keep my body and bring it under
[53:29] subjection least by any means when I
[53:33] have preached to others. I myself should
[53:36] be a cast away.
[53:39] Paul was playing wasn't saying I'm
[53:42] brother Paul. You remember you respect
[53:44] the Apostle Paul. He wasn't talking
[53:46] that. Amen. He was bringing it down
[53:48] real. He was saying, "You know what? If
[53:51] I don't get this right, I'll be a
[53:52] castaway." So, I want to get this thing
[53:55] right. Now, the amplified
[53:57] says, "Now, every athlete who goes into
[54:01] training, conducts himself temporarily,
[54:05] and restricts himself in all things.
[54:09] They do it to win a REIT that will soon
[54:11] wither. We do it to receive a crown of
[54:14] eternal blessedness that cannot wither.
[54:16] Therefore, I do not run uncertainly
[54:19] without definite aim. All right? I do
[54:21] not buck like one beat in the air and
[54:23] strike him without anniversary.
[54:26] There's no air boxing and you if you're
[54:27] a
[54:28] winning, there's nobody there.
[54:34] So, all you doing motions and there's no
[54:37] real enemy there. You have no bull to
[54:40] fight. You no maniac man. You have no
[54:43] you have encountered nothing. or you
[54:44] fight and some of us that's fight up
[54:47] with ourselves.
[54:50] God can't send you on trial because you
[54:51] still caught up in you.
[54:54] Hallelujah. God had to get you out of
[54:56] you to send you on a trial. You have
[54:58] fight with your own self. Thank you
[55:00] Jesus. You tripping yourself. Everybody
[55:02] walk and they and they trip down the
[55:03] self they fall down. Nobody trip down.
[55:06] You're walking so crazy that you're
[55:08] tripping your own self.
[55:11] Come say pray for me brother. No, pray
[55:13] for the bed. Pray for me.
[55:20] Hallelujah.
[55:22] Paul said, "Therefore," these amplified,
[55:24] "I do not run uncertainly without
[55:26] definite aim. I do not box like one beat
[55:29] in the air and strike him with an with
[55:31] with without an adversary, but like a
[55:33] boxer. I buffet my body, handle it
[55:37] roughly, discipline it by hardship,
[55:40] subdue it for fear that after
[55:43] proclaiming to others the gospel and
[55:45] things pertaining to it, I myself should
[55:48] become unfit and and have not stand a
[55:51] test, be unapproved, and rejected as a
[55:54] counterfeit. God,
[55:59] that is not that is not skim milk. Amen.
[56:04] 2 Timothy 2:1-5. Hallelujah. Read your
[56:07] Bible and pray every day. My Jesus.
[56:08] Amen. And it will grow. Timothy. Now
[56:12] therefore, my son, be strong in the
[56:14] grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the
[56:16] things that thou has heard of me among
[56:18] many witnesses, the same commit unto
[56:19] faithful men, who shall be able to teach
[56:22] others also. Thou therefore endure
[56:25] hardness as a good soldier of Christ.
[56:28] Listen to this now. No man that
[56:32] warth entangling himself with the
[56:35] affairs of this life that he may purpose
[56:37] that he may please him who has chosen
[56:40] him to be a soldier.
[56:43] Amen. Hallelujah. And if a man also
[56:45] strive for masteries yet here we go. He
[56:49] is not crowned except he strive
[56:53] lawfully.
[56:56] Are you still with me now? Amen. So,
[56:58] it's not just winning the race, but it's
[57:01] how.
[57:04] Now, let's take a look at the amplified
[57:05] of these verse. Take with me your share
[57:08] of hardship and sufferings which you are
[57:10] called to endure as a good first class
[57:13] soldier of Christ Jesus. I like that.
[57:14] First class soldiers.
[57:16] No soldier when in service get entangled
[57:21] in the enterprise of civilian
[57:24] life. Now the soldiers inside of here
[57:26] will understand that soldier is not a
[57:28] civilian. Soldier is a soldier. Isn't
[57:31] that right? His aim is to satisfy and
[57:35] please the ones who enlisted him.
[57:39] And if anyone entered competitive games,
[57:41] he is not lawfully crowned unless he
[57:44] competes lawfully, fairly according to
[57:47] the rules laid down.
[57:50] Hallelujah. Amen.
[57:52] Amen. Are you with me? But Ram says
[57:55] this, Napoleon was defeated because he
[57:57] never played by the rules of the game.
[57:59] And remember this, that's a good lesson
[58:01] for the church of the living God. If we
[58:03] don't play the game according to the
[58:05] rules, we'll be disqualified at the end.
[58:08] You have to keep the rules of the game
[58:10] to win. And if the rules of the game in
[58:13] this place is a man to be born again to
[58:16] enter into fellowship of Christ and his
[58:17] church, we might be the greatest
[58:19] denomination on earth. If we haven't
[58:21] played the rules, we be disqualified.
[58:23] Amen. We have got to come right straight
[58:26] with God. Oh, praise the name of the
[58:28] Lord.
[58:30] Glory. with God rules. It isn't our
[58:33] rules. It is his rules and we have got
[58:35] to abide by. We are running the race
[58:38] according to his rules. You see Napoleon
[58:42] although being a great warrior, a great
[58:44] conqueror, he conquered the people under
[58:46] fear. And that's not the rule of the
[58:48] game. The rule of the game is a conquer
[58:50] by love. Amen.
[58:53] Hallelujah. So you see what happened to
[58:56] all these churches where is ruled with
[58:57] rigor and fear by the pontiff.
[59:01] the bishop. There is no other force in
[59:03] all the world as great as love. And I'm
[59:06] almost sure as we as people have put too
[59:08] much emphasis upon rules. Don't mean to
[59:10] be rude. And we have made ourselves and
[59:13] put so much stress upon those rules only
[59:14] to find ourselves disqualified. Now hear
[59:17] this bum. What if Martin Luther would
[59:19] have played the rules of the game? There
[59:21] would never been a Methodist church.
[59:23] That's right. Amen. What if the
[59:26] Methodists are played by the rules of
[59:27] the game? There will be ne never been a
[59:30] what are you saying there? The church
[59:31] would have been growing into maturity
[59:34] into that perfection into that son of
[59:36] God. Isn't that right? But because the
[59:39] rules were not broken, God had to get
[59:42] somebody else. Let's read on. Amen. What
[59:46] if the Methodist have played the rules
[59:47] of the game right? There never been a
[59:48] Pentecostal church. But if we fail to
[59:51] play the rules of the game right, God
[59:54] will disqualify us and raise up out of
[59:56] these stones children to Abraham.
[1:00:00] Hallelujah. So when Luther fell, God
[1:00:02] say, "You know what? Somebody else bring
[1:00:04] Wesley. I'm going to try with them to
[1:00:06] see how they going to run." And then
[1:00:08] when they broke, he bring the
[1:00:09] Pentecostal. When they broke, he had to
[1:00:11] bring William Brandham to bring back the
[1:00:13] word because when the dynamics ah when
[1:00:16] the dynamics struck the Pentecostals, it
[1:00:19] did not bring them to perfection.
[1:00:22] Did you hear what I'm saying? The spirit
[1:00:25] fell among the Pentecostals and it
[1:00:27] couldn't bring them to perfection
[1:00:29] because they didn't have the word.
[1:00:32] Hallelujah. They had the gifts. They
[1:00:35] still have them. But they didn't go on
[1:00:37] to perfection. And Paul said, "Let us go
[1:00:40] on to perfection. We have got to get
[1:00:43] there now. We have to journey to it. We
[1:00:46] have to get to it. We have to see it. We
[1:00:48] have to behold it because the bride is
[1:00:50] called to it.
[1:00:53] Amen.
[1:00:54] [Applause]
[1:00:56] Hallelujah.
[1:01:00] God wants the game played right. And we
[1:01:04] must do it. So it doesn't make any
[1:01:06] difference how much we feel like we are
[1:01:09] progressing on until we get back to the
[1:01:12] rule of the game. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:01:17] So I know like the rabbit and the hole
[1:01:18] going on in the hole. You got to wait
[1:01:20] right by the hole cuz rabbit have to
[1:01:21] come out there. That's right. There's
[1:01:22] one hole. You know him down inside of
[1:01:24] there. Just wait for him.
[1:01:26] And we are waiting right by the word.
[1:01:32] Because you know all man had to line up
[1:01:33] with it.
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:37] Oh, glory to God.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] But Abraham told her brother, he said,
[1:01:43] "This is that brother." Amen. If God has
[1:01:45] given you a talent, Amen. stay with that
[1:01:47] talent. No matter what you try to do, if
[1:01:51] that talent isn't operated, no matter
[1:01:53] how great it is, if it isn't operating
[1:01:56] according to the rules, you'll be
[1:01:57] disqualified.
[1:01:58] Amen. So, it's a little more than being
[1:02:01] talented. Amen. And I want you to say
[1:02:04] amen to that. It's a little more by
[1:02:06] being that than being gifted. It's a
[1:02:08] little more than that. It have much more
[1:02:10] than that. And that is what you have to
[1:02:12] be interested in to process.
[1:02:15] What goes with talent? What goes with
[1:02:17] gift or I should say say this way what
[1:02:20] God expect to go with talent.
[1:02:22] Hallelujah. Or what God expect to go
[1:02:25] with gifts.
[1:02:27] So he said everyone knows in Olympics
[1:02:29] athletic exercise no matter if you
[1:02:30] arrive first in the race if you haven't
[1:02:32] played by the rule you're disqualified.
[1:02:36] Just last week the Olympic committee I
[1:02:39] didn't even know they do that. They keep
[1:02:41] blood samples of athletes from all the
[1:02:44] different years and stuff because of
[1:02:47] technology. They have accurate way of
[1:02:49] measuring and knowing if somebody had
[1:02:51] drugs in their system.
[1:02:53] So they now pull out and disqualify
[1:02:56] people that took part in the Olympics 15
[1:02:58] years ago. They take back the gold from
[1:03:01] them that to call the silver winner and
[1:03:04] say you have the gold now.
[1:03:08] and they interview one of them and say
[1:03:09] all they miss is being on the podium for
[1:03:12] for for the gold because you see at that
[1:03:14] time they got silver but now when the
[1:03:18] light is shun on the condition back
[1:03:22] there and revealed that this person was
[1:03:25] taking enhancement drugs to give them a
[1:03:28] more
[1:03:29] spiritual oomph
[1:03:32] only to realize that the inspector the
[1:03:36] drug inspector
[1:03:37] examining the process, examining the way
[1:03:41] they run, only to come and disqualify
[1:03:44] them and put the metal onto somebody
[1:03:46] else. Oh, could we say amen, somebody?
[1:03:49] This is this is strong. This is deep.
[1:03:53] This is real and it's coming near you.
[1:03:58] Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:05] So now you will see when people motive
[1:04:08] and objective what is their real deep
[1:04:10] desire when that come to the four you're
[1:04:13] going to see the sincerity that's why
[1:04:15] Baram says it take a humble heart
[1:04:16] dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ
[1:04:19] into present tense God will not use
[1:04:20] arrogance God will not use pride the
[1:04:23] Bible talk about the day coming which
[1:04:24] shall be burned and all the proud and
[1:04:26] all that do wickedly like stubble all
[1:04:28] the proud and all that do wickedly shall
[1:04:30] be like stubble a dreadful day coming
[1:04:32] But behold, I send you Elijah the
[1:04:34] prophet before that great and terrible
[1:04:35] day of the Lord. Do you love him this
[1:04:37] morning? Isn't that a mind-blowing thing
[1:04:40] that they could go back 15 years, 10
[1:04:41] years, check back the blood sample and
[1:04:43] see exactly what was in that blood and
[1:04:46] say, "You know what? You don't deserve
[1:04:47] the gold because you took something
[1:04:49] you're not supposed to take. You didn't
[1:04:50] go through the right process. You are
[1:04:52] disqualified. I don't want to do that. I
[1:04:55] want the trouble at the riverside." Oh,
[1:04:57] glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise God. So
[1:05:00] therefore, you have to lay aside the
[1:05:02] weight and the sin that so easily be set
[1:05:05] to you. And you want to run with
[1:05:06] patience the race that is set before
[1:05:09] you. Oh, glory to God. You want to run
[1:05:12] because this is a race, brother. This is
[1:05:14] a race, sister. Some of us start young
[1:05:16] running and we had no glasses. We had
[1:05:18] black hair and no gray hair and we
[1:05:20] started running a long time ago and we
[1:05:22] are still running. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:05:25] we have been called to run with
[1:05:26] patience.
[1:05:29] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Let
[1:05:32] patience have a perfect work.
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:37] Brother Abraham says, "We find a
[1:05:39] church." Here we are tonight in the
[1:05:41] shadows of the coming of the Lord, son
[1:05:43] of God. We find a church in an enemic
[1:05:45] condition. We ought to be a great,
[1:05:47] strong, mighty warriors of the church of
[1:05:50] of the faith that would shake a nation.
[1:05:52] God give it to us. That's how the church
[1:05:55] supposed to be. Strong, mighty, and and
[1:05:57] so forth. shaking up the nation. Do you
[1:05:59] believe that? Amen. 10% say amen. Amen.
[1:06:02] The rest wondering.
[1:06:04] When they will believe that.
[1:06:06] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. But I have
[1:06:10] overcome all the wanderers. Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] Hallelujah. Praise God. Your wondering
[1:06:14] doesn't bother me at all. I just have
[1:06:16] the word to pile upon you. Come on.
[1:06:18] You're going to make it. Stick on your
[1:06:20] hair. Stick in your there. Oh,
[1:06:22] hallelujah. You're going to leave you.
[1:06:23] It will come off. Amen. Jesus, he became
[1:06:26] us sinners that we might become his
[1:06:28] righteousness. In other words, he he
[1:06:30] became I be my he became me that I might
[1:06:33] become him. That's why he took my place
[1:06:36] that I could take his place. Amen.
[1:06:40] Why you think Jesus went to hell?
[1:06:42] Because he died like a sinner. He took
[1:06:43] all our sins upon himself so sin sent
[1:06:45] him to hell. But hell couldn't hold his
[1:06:47] character.
[1:06:52] Sin were like a big stone, like a big
[1:06:54] rock. S Jesus down into hell. But when
[1:06:56] Jesus offload character, it just break
[1:06:58] that rock to float back up. After 3
[1:07:01] days, you had to come back up. You can't
[1:07:02] hold back character.
[1:07:08] That which is good always rises to the
[1:07:10] top. Glory to God. You can't hold you
[1:07:12] back. My God going to single you out.
[1:07:15] We're going to find you out. Oh,
[1:07:18] hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. So
[1:07:20] now you'll understand there's no problem
[1:07:22] with lions. Then there no problem with
[1:07:24] fiery furnace. No there's no problem as
[1:07:26] long as God is with you. There's a lion
[1:07:29] in the street. That's not a problem. As
[1:07:30] long as God with you.
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:37] Oh my.
[1:07:41] This is this is part I ain't get to want
[1:07:44] to reach it. Amen. All right. So in
[1:07:47] prison
[1:07:48] now, not he that starts,
[1:07:52] it's he that finishes.
[1:07:55] There are no shortcuts.
[1:07:57] You're disqualified at the end of the
[1:07:59] race. No shortcuts. You must come the
[1:08:02] way the scripture said. Repent and be
[1:08:05] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:06] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:08:08] Ghost. There is no shortcut. shaking
[1:08:10] hands, joining church or denomination,
[1:08:12] you come the way. Except you die to
[1:08:15] yourself and be born of the spirit of
[1:08:18] God, you are lost.
[1:08:24] That's a big one, right?
[1:08:27] Amen. This young man came to Jesus say,
[1:08:30] "Good master, what I what can I do to
[1:08:32] inherit eternal life?"
[1:08:36] Jesus bull him bull him a curveball.
[1:08:41] commandments. You say which
[1:08:44] cuz he he good, you know. Yes. He and he
[1:08:47] sharp. Yeah. Yes. Yes. He know you can't
[1:08:49] catch him on this one, you can't catch
[1:08:50] him on that one, you can't catch him on
[1:08:52] that. He know what you can't catch him
[1:08:53] on. So you say which
[1:08:57] So when Jesus laid out on him, he said,
[1:08:59] "But for my youth,
[1:09:03] I committed to those things. You can't
[1:09:06] catch me on those things." Jesus said,
[1:09:08] "If
[1:09:11] you would be perfect,
[1:09:13] that's a question to you this morning."
[1:09:16] The bride is go to perfection. But if
[1:09:20] Amen.
[1:09:22] you want to be perfect,
[1:09:24] go and sell
[1:09:26] what you have. Now the emphasis there, I
[1:09:30] want to bring a certain thought behind
[1:09:32] that. The man had possession. It was an
[1:09:35] imaginary thing. You know, I imagine we
[1:09:37] need a lot to know. It wasn't that. I
[1:09:40] imagine a big house. No, he had
[1:09:41] possessions. And you have possessions
[1:09:44] this morning.
[1:09:48] It don't have to be money. It don't have
[1:09:51] to be physical. You could have a lot of
[1:09:53] lust,
[1:09:54] a lot of passion, a lot of anger. You
[1:09:56] could have a lot of stuff in your life,
[1:09:58] in your spirit that belongs to you as
[1:10:00] you own it. Yes.
[1:10:03] It's like it's like your property then.
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:06] You ain't want to give it up. Yeah. Want
[1:10:09] to let it go. You don't want to pay no
[1:10:11] price. But Jesus introduced a cost.
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:17] A cost factor.
[1:10:19] If you want to be perfect. No. No. If
[1:10:22] you want to be a church member, you
[1:10:24] don't have to sell nothing. You don't
[1:10:26] just come to church and go home and
[1:10:27] shake people hand and smile. You don't
[1:10:29] have to pay tithes, offering, building
[1:10:31] fun. You don't have to encourage nobody.
[1:10:33] You disturb nobody. You come, you go.
[1:10:36] You could, you know, that's that's good
[1:10:38] for for a church member. But going to
[1:10:41] perfection, that's the bride.
[1:10:48] That's the bride. The bride want to obey
[1:10:50] the word. The bride want to surrender to
[1:10:53] the word.
[1:10:57] Amen. Amen. That's why I could salute
[1:11:01] precious sisters who husband have could
[1:11:04] honor them for the humility and the
[1:11:06] respects. That's a rare quality for a
[1:11:09] woman to have that very rare that come
[1:11:12] like you had to put that on that glass
[1:11:15] and examine that and say whoa whoa look
[1:11:18] at that
[1:11:20] very precious
[1:11:22] because the spirit of the age is so
[1:11:23] different and God wants our spirit back
[1:11:26] into the word. Amen. Men are now more
[1:11:28] cisified than ever and woman more
[1:11:31] manified than ever if there's a word.
[1:11:33] But that is not scripture. There's a
[1:11:36] scriptural spirit for the man and a
[1:11:38] scriptural spirit for the woman. And we
[1:11:40] have to find our spirits in the
[1:11:41] scripture. That's why I said go back to
[1:11:43] the Bible and don't talk about any
[1:11:45] message because the message is the word.
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:51] And whether you say amen or not, it's
[1:11:52] still the word.
[1:11:55] I'm not begging nobody for any amen. I'm
[1:11:58] here to preach you the word because the
[1:12:00] word is God. People think church is God,
[1:12:02] but the word is God. Don't hide in
[1:12:06] church. The word is God.
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:15] Hallelujah.
[1:12:17] Say, you are rough. I like I like nice
[1:12:20] smooth talking preachers. You're not as
[1:12:22] smooth as the one I used to go by. No,
[1:12:24] I'm not. You are not as entertaining as
[1:12:27] the one that I go by. No, I am not. But
[1:12:30] this is the word. Because Jesus said,
[1:12:32] "Man shall not live by entertainment.
[1:12:35] Man shall live by bread alone, but by
[1:12:36] every word."
[1:12:39] The devil is a liar. You know, and the
[1:12:41] devil I'm going to read about it.
[1:12:43] Listen, I have big word for you this
[1:12:45] morning. You know, he comes disguises
[1:12:47] the church. It's a scary thing. Amen.
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:56] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] Amen.
[1:13:05] My my my
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:15] wow. Hallelujah. Let me try to finish
[1:13:18] this off. M in fact the outcoming of
[1:13:21] faithfulness the trial of faith work
[1:13:23] patience there's absolutely no way in
[1:13:26] which to gain patience it has to come by
[1:13:29] the trial of your faith
[1:13:32] Romans 5:3 tribulation
[1:13:35] workketh patience
[1:13:40] if you want to get patience going
[1:13:44] tribulation is work it
[1:13:48] let me Say it again. I know you ain't
[1:13:50] get that one yet. People just watching
[1:13:52] me like in space like you want to get
[1:13:55] space out this morning. If you want
[1:13:57] patience, tribulation put that.
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] If the car cost that, the car patience
[1:14:04] cast that. Tribulation is the engine.
[1:14:07] Tribulation is the fuel to get patience
[1:14:10] going.
[1:14:12] Some people don't want to get patience
[1:14:13] yet. They want it right now. But God
[1:14:15] leave you waiting still. You'll still go
[1:14:17] through tribulation because God will
[1:14:19] have no spoiled children. Hallelujah.
[1:14:22] Now watch how highly God regards the
[1:14:26] outworking of our patience. It seem in
[1:14:29] James 1. You know strange people like to
[1:14:32] give testimonies sometimes some
[1:14:34] sometimes fancy for testimonies. They
[1:14:36] got a fridge. They got you know
[1:14:38] different things God bless them with and
[1:14:39] so on. But you don't ever hear people
[1:14:41] giving testimonies. God worked my
[1:14:43] patience with such a I come to thank God
[1:14:45] this morning for for for the patience of
[1:14:48] Jesus Christ for how God took me through
[1:14:50] hell this week and I was smiling. You
[1:14:53] know what I mean? And I was worshiping.
[1:14:55] Hallelujah. The pressure was hot. I
[1:14:58] didn't even know where to turn. But
[1:15:00] somehow a praise came on my lips and the
[1:15:02] devil couldn't get me off my
[1:15:05] praise. Oh,
[1:15:08] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:10] I never lost my praise. I lost friends.
[1:15:14] I lost fellowship. Lost minister,
[1:15:17] brethren. Hallelujah. But he ain't get
[1:15:20] me off of my praise. Don't let the devil
[1:15:23] take your praise. Don't let the devil
[1:15:25] take your joy. That's your joy.
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:36] How highly God regard this outworking of
[1:15:39] our patience is seen in James 1:4.
[1:15:43] But let patience have a perfect work
[1:15:46] purpose that you may be perfect
[1:15:50] and entire lacking nothing. Amen. Here
[1:15:52] we go. God's will for us is perfection.
[1:15:56] That's right. God's will for us is
[1:16:00] perfection.
[1:16:01] And that perfection is patience. It's
[1:16:04] waiting on God and waiting for God. This
[1:16:09] is the process. Amen. Of character
[1:16:12] development. Amen. So we talk about
[1:16:14] perfection. Statue of a perfect man.
[1:16:17] Five-fold ministry coming to perfection.
[1:16:19] But there's a process to get to that
[1:16:22] perfection. But I'm saying this morning,
[1:16:25] we are coming into that
[1:16:28] perfection. Oh, glory to God.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] Hallelujah.
[1:16:34] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Anything
[1:16:37] that tough. Hallelujah. Here's what
[1:16:39] coming.
[1:16:40] Listen to this prophecy. Amen. But the
[1:16:43] Bible is
[1:16:44] praying. This is Cleveland,
[1:16:47] Ohio. The 20th of
[1:16:50] August, 1950. Our heavenly father, I'm
[1:16:54] so happy today to be here at Cleveland,
[1:16:57] this great city, one of the major cities
[1:17:00] of our beloved nation and to be here to
[1:17:03] give testimony of thy son Jesus who has
[1:17:06] died to redeem this lost race of people
[1:17:08] throughout the world. And now as we are
[1:17:11] gathered here together this afternoon to
[1:17:14] pour out of your spirit upon us. I
[1:17:17] believe every man, woman, boy, girl from
[1:17:19] every church, every creed denomination,
[1:17:21] race, color, forget all about the past.
[1:17:24] Now let's look to the
[1:17:27] future. Let's look to that continuing
[1:17:29] city that is to come. Cleveland is home
[1:17:33] to many thousands. Yes, millions, over a
[1:17:35] million people here. God, we pray that
[1:17:38] men and women will never be satisfied
[1:17:40] until they meet peace with you. Amen. So
[1:17:42] we can go to that continuing city,
[1:17:46] looking upon the giant skyscraper in the
[1:17:48] city, looking upon the fine buildings
[1:17:51] and
[1:17:52] structures, but there will be a time
[1:17:55] when there won't be one stone left upon
[1:17:58] another.
[1:18:00] We believe that these
[1:18:03] cities in this great major conflict
[1:18:06] that's coming will be rocked with atomic
[1:18:10] powers
[1:18:12] and millions will die in ours. Amen.
[1:18:16] Blown to
[1:18:17] bits. Even the earth shook from its
[1:18:21] orbit going into the sun. Great heat
[1:18:23] shall scorch men as the scriptures say
[1:18:26] in the book of Revelation.
[1:18:30] Help us God to get our mind on you to
[1:18:34] settle down. Amen. To go into this
[1:18:37] bloody trail. I review it Lord to the
[1:18:40] best of my knowledge. You help me as I
[1:18:42] start back from the beginning when you
[1:18:43] put your hand on your poor humble
[1:18:45] servant. May all my mistakes today, may
[1:18:48] others and young boys and girls who
[1:18:49] coming on, may they be stepping stones
[1:18:51] to bring them to thee. May they profit
[1:18:53] from my errors of suffering that they
[1:18:56] may know you in the power of your
[1:18:59] resurrection. For we ask it in the name
[1:19:02] of thy beloved child.
[1:19:05] Hallelujah. Amen. For a message called
[1:19:07] the resurrection of
[1:19:08] Lazarus, 29th of July 1951. Brother
[1:19:12] Brandon, notice before God does anything
[1:19:15] on the earth, he always sends a message
[1:19:17] of warning, getting things ready. I kind
[1:19:19] of feel religious right now. I believe
[1:19:22] there's a move going on. God is warning
[1:19:25] as it was in days of Noah, getting the
[1:19:28] people ready. Something is about to
[1:19:30] happen. The atomic powers and things are
[1:19:33] about ready to burst in upon us.
[1:19:35] Millions will die in a split second, but
[1:19:38] oh my God, getting the church ready for
[1:19:41] the rapture, the coming of the son of
[1:19:43] God.
[1:19:45] Hallelujah.
[1:19:47] This is what the prophet saw 1933. He
[1:19:49] got seven visions which he said must
[1:19:51] come to pass before Jesus comes again.
[1:19:55] Six vision. So seven vision, he saw
[1:19:58] America bombed up, blowed up and
[1:19:59] whatnot. How could that be? 1950 they
[1:20:03] didn't have the technology. the
[1:20:05] weaponry, the efficiency of the bombs
[1:20:08] and the missiles and so on like they
[1:20:09] have now. It had to wait for the process
[1:20:13] for things to be in position that that
[1:20:15] could be executed. What about the bride?
[1:20:18] Pride is a super church prophecy.
[1:20:20] Hallelujah. Super race prophecy.
[1:20:23] Hallelujah. All this prophecy. But there
[1:20:25] have to be a process.
[1:20:29] People don't want to talk about the
[1:20:30] process. They want to just stick with
[1:20:33] just well that is it. That is it. But
[1:20:35] there's the process. Once listen, once
[1:20:38] you're going through the process, you'll
[1:20:39] be fine. It come business. The profits
[1:20:42] will come. If the business model is
[1:20:44] right and the process is taking place,
[1:20:46] you don't have to worry. It will work
[1:20:47] out just fine. Amen. Because the right
[1:20:49] puts it right things are there.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah. If the things are not there,
[1:20:52] it wouldn't work out. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:54] Hallelujah. God tell Noah, you're going
[1:20:56] to rain. Everything is judgment or whatn
[1:20:58] not. Bill ar Noah had to go through the
[1:21:00] process. Rain
[1:21:01] coming. Amen.
[1:21:04] Noah going to fet and going to party and
[1:21:06] with God and will drunk too.
[1:21:11] The only way to save for no to be saved
[1:21:13] is to follow instructions.
[1:21:15] Noah say I feeling led. Oh gosh, this
[1:21:17] this act too long. Yes, I going shorten
[1:21:21] it. Noah playing designer.
[1:21:25] God don't No, no, no. Don't know the
[1:21:27] kind of flood coming. No own designer. I
[1:21:30] feel kind of modern kind of yacht like
[1:21:31] looking thing, you know. I go make a
[1:21:33] small thing.
[1:21:35] Hallelujah. When the flood come, I go I
[1:21:38] go just the way we a surfing surf a
[1:21:40] surfing a surfing boat.
[1:21:43] He will die with the surfing boat. His
[1:21:45] family too. But Noah following
[1:21:49] instructions
[1:21:51] because the prophecy, you can't stop it.
[1:21:54] Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Caught you. You can't stop
[1:21:56] the prophecy. You can't stop the
[1:21:58] missiles on it way. You can't stop
[1:22:00] sinking. You can't stand stop training
[1:22:02] and rocking. You can't stop that. But
[1:22:06] you could be prepared. You can get
[1:22:09] prepared because the Bible said his wife
[1:22:11] had made herself ready.
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:19] Listen, we not following fairy tales,
[1:22:21] you know. There's not old wise woman
[1:22:24] tales, you know. This is a 20th century
[1:22:27] dos say the lord prophet you know people
[1:22:30] playing in this message but this is not
[1:22:32] a plain thing this is behold I send you
[1:22:35] Elijah before

[1:24:18] courage Lord and he dropped some hand
[1:24:20] him and beat him up.
[1:24:23] And that man came to the altar that
[1:24:24] night and got saved.
[1:24:29] If that preacher was some like the
[1:24:31] religious preacher of the day, okay, God
[1:24:32] bless you, brother. I think that kind of
[1:24:35] religious business never had that

[1:25:50] stay on this earth and
[1:25:54] snow. All the blessings God give you is
[1:25:56] to serve him better, not to be more mean
[1:25:59] and stingy and jealous and
[1:26:03] selfish. God bless you that you could
[1:26:05] serve
[1:26:08] him. I want to say it again.
[1:26:11] God had blessed you for to serve the
[1:26:13] devil. He blessed you to serve him.

[1:26:36] you could heal and surrender and say,
[1:26:38] "Lord, I give myself away to you. I come
[1:26:42] to return back what you give me. I come
[1:26:44] to Amen. give my life over to
[1:26:50] you. Young woman looking pretty inside
[1:26:52] the mirror. She find she looking the
[1:26:53] prettiest of all. She modeling herself,
[1:26:55] preventing herself and whatn not and
[1:26:57] what not. And then afterwards, what
[1:26:58] happened? What happened 30 years
[1:26:59] afterwards? What happened 40 years
[1:27:01] afterwards? All the youth gone. And you
[1:27:02] got to compete with some new young blood

[1:27:17] understand that.
[1:27:19] But good Lord, you certainly don't want
[1:27:21] to look like a father.
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] You certainly don't want to look like
[1:27:26] they're out there. Amen.
[1:27:29] Where are the Abrahams to tell her?
[1:27:31] Choose, choose, choose. Stop fighting
[1:27:33] and choose.
[1:27:35] But everybody said that mind I wanted. I

[1:29:46] Ah. Did you hear that? Not a low
[1:29:51] calling. Whom much is given, much is
[1:29:54] required. If God give us great stuff, he
[1:29:57] expect great behavior, attitude,
[1:30:00] character, and life from us. Not this
[1:30:02] dead church benchwarming people, but are
[1:30:06] people on fire for God. Don't give God

[1:30:33] me challenge you right now. I don't care
[1:30:34] what is in your life, in your home, what
[1:30:36] challenges you have right now. Your
[1:30:37] worry can't change nothing. But your
[1:30:40] faith can.
[1:30:42] Your praise can
[1:30:47] if your mother sick at home, your family
[1:30:49] sick at home, you worrying about them
[1:30:51] doesn't change they're sick at home. But
[1:30:53] they could hit

[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:15] Hallelujah.
[1:31:18] There are some bummers, you know,
[1:31:20] and play and bombers. Let's fly slow and
[1:31:23] just just release them. That's what we
[1:31:26] want to do. Some of the demons, you
[1:31:28] know, just fly over and just drop it.
[1:31:31] Let it come down in slow
[1:31:33] motion. When it hit them so they have no
[1:31:35] room to cover,
[1:31:38] leave that to go. When they see you,
[1:31:41] they must feel threatened. That's how
[1:31:43] you supposed to be walking right now.
[1:31:45] When they leave, when they walk, so they
[1:31:46] might be saying, "No, no, no, no, not
[1:31:48] not yet. Not not yet. Don't don't don't
[1:31:50] move yet." They coming. Amen.
[1:31:54] Demons hiding behind walls,
[1:31:57] talking, getting away from you because
[1:31:59] the glory of God is coming upon your
[1:32:03] life.
[1:32:05] And as the word becomes flesh, you get
[1:32:07] more presence in your life.
[1:32:09] Hallelujah. The presence of God begin to
[1:32:11] ooze out of your being. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:32:14] hallelujah. Those guys knew they were
[1:32:15] anointed. They they knew. They had faith
[1:32:17] in the anointing that God put upon them.
[1:32:20] God has put an anointing upon you. You
[1:32:21] couldn't You couldn't come if you try.
[1:32:24] No man can come except the father draw
[1:32:27] him. You didn't hear what I'm saying. Oh
[1:32:30] God. Oh God. Hallelujah. Help me preach
[1:32:32] somebody. No man can come except.
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:37] You're not here by chance this morning.
[1:32:39] You're not in this building by chance
[1:32:41] this morning. You here to get a word
[1:32:43] from the Lord. God is speaking to you
[1:32:46] this morning.
[1:32:49] [Applause]
[1:32:53] Hallelujah.
[1:32:54] Glory.
[1:32:59] Hallelujah. I told him in London,
[1:33:02] hallelujah. God was taking home Elijah.
[1:33:05] That's right. He said, "Go and anoint a
[1:33:07] man, Elisha." He went and take his
[1:33:09] mantle and put it in him and pull it
[1:33:12] off. Not say, "Holy m, oh God, I going
[1:33:15] dead.
[1:33:16] I going, oh God, getting depressed." No,
[1:33:18] no,
[1:33:19] no. That is not how it works. Put the
[1:33:23] mantle on a young man and pull it off
[1:33:24] because the man ain't ready yet. He had
[1:33:26] to go through process. Says it take 10
[1:33:28] years for him to come through to the
[1:33:30] mantle. Plus, they just stay here. Stay
[1:33:32] there. Stay there. Every demon in town
[1:33:34] telling you stay there. Because they
[1:33:37] find you pimping out too much. They find
[1:33:39] you're getting too boy. You're getting
[1:33:40] too bouncy. You're getting too too much
[1:33:43] of faith. Too much of testimony. You're
[1:33:45] getting too aggressive. Hallelujah. You
[1:33:47] look like you're getting victory every
[1:33:49] time. Oh, you're so victorious. Look
[1:33:51] like you're punching the devil, though.
[1:33:53] When you start to tell the devil, "Boo,"
[1:33:54] he said to get smaller. That's the
[1:33:56] problem. You start to say, "Boo!" Yet,
[1:33:58] when you start to say boo, the devil's
[1:34:00] have to get smaller. Start to say boo
[1:34:02] today, he has to back up. He has to move
[1:34:06] back. Oh, glory to God. We want to push
[1:34:08] him back this morning. Help me push him
[1:34:11] back this morning. Help me drive some
[1:34:13] villain signs plum out of here this
[1:34:16] morning.
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:28] will take a transformation of your mind.
[1:34:31] All those people that succeeded all
[1:34:33] those businessmen and you study them
[1:34:35] because I always want to know what make
[1:34:36] them spark what make them make so
[1:34:38] different and so on. Let's talk about
[1:34:40] Apple and the iPhone and different
[1:34:42] things. When Apple first come out,
[1:34:43] nobody believed they could succeed with
[1:34:44] the iPhone. Everybody had phone. Nokia
[1:34:47] or Backberry, everybody else, but they
[1:34:49] believe that they could do it different.
[1:34:52] They didn't invent phones, but guess
[1:34:54] what? They did it different. Oh,
[1:34:57] hallelujah. Amen. We didn't invent
[1:34:59] churches. We don't have to be like the
[1:35:00] other churches. Other groups, people
[1:35:03] dead people. You know, you know what God
[1:35:05] said? I rather you're hot or you're
[1:35:06] cold. So, if you know that, why you
[1:35:09] would walk in the building cold?
[1:35:11] Amen. Hallelujah. We say get your fire
[1:35:14] home and bring it.
[1:35:17] If you don't have it, call us for
[1:35:18] prayer. We will pray it.
[1:35:21] We will send it. We will come to your
[1:35:23] home and anoint you with it. But we want
[1:35:26] home fire, not church fire. Church fire
[1:35:29] is
[1:35:31] God and the pastor come finding
[1:35:38] fire going out and and pastor being
[1:35:41] fire. Poor pastor. By the time we finish
[1:35:44] the blow
[1:35:45] out and you see a little a little smoke,
[1:35:49] a little smoke for all them oils, a
[1:35:51] little smoke sort of thing.
[1:35:54] You don't want that. You want to be the
[1:35:57] wood that coming on fire. Praise God.
[1:36:01] And when papel stand by brother Jerome
[1:36:04] fire and chain by brother Pel fire.
[1:36:07] Praise God. As you pass somebody, you're
[1:36:10] only connecting fire with fire. Glory to
[1:36:12] God. Maybe the devil can hear no spirit.
[1:36:15] There was no room found for that devil.
[1:36:19] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, it's all over me.
[1:36:23] And it's keeping me alive, keeping me
[1:36:25] alive. Keeping me alive. It's the Holy
[1:36:28] Ghost on fire keeping me
[1:36:31] alive. Hallelujah. Jesus is keeping me
[1:36:34] alive. Oh, hallelujah. The Holy Ghost on
[1:36:37] power. It's the Holy Ghost on fire.
[1:36:42] Don't you want it?
[1:36:47] Take it home with you. Oh, give the Lord
[1:36:50] some praises, people. Take it home with
[1:36:55] you. You may be seated. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:36:59] Oh, praise the Lord. Remember, you have
[1:37:03] a perfect standing through the blood.
[1:37:05] Don't forget that. Last week's service,
[1:37:07] you're supposed to catch that. You have
[1:37:09] perfect standing. God not seeing you and
[1:37:11] you're failing in the foreshore coming.
[1:37:12] He's seeing the blood. So when you pray,
[1:37:15] God not watching you. He's seen the
[1:37:16] blood. So you're safe this morning under
[1:37:19] the blood. Oh glory. You have confidence
[1:37:22] under the blood. Praise God. But let us
[1:37:25] enter with boldness approaching the
[1:37:27] throne of grace. Hallelujah. By the
[1:37:30] blood of Jesus. You have with boldness.
[1:37:32] You come in trembling. Oh God. No no no
[1:37:35] no no boldness. Hallelujah. Devil have
[1:37:37] no right to take out my eyes. They have
[1:37:39] got the right to mess up my son, mess up
[1:37:42] my daughter. I am coming for that devil.
[1:37:45] Come on, say amen, somebody. Come on,
[1:37:48] bring back the authority back into your
[1:37:50] life. The authority of the
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:57] word. How many time you read? That's why
[1:37:59] you read the books. Listen to brother
[1:38:01] tapes. Listen at home. I got the
[1:38:03] authority vested in me. I do this, I do
[1:38:06] that. Is authority. The police have no
[1:38:08] power to stop no car.
[1:38:10] All the speed gun they have right now.
[1:38:12] Let the band drive. Keep driving. What
[1:38:14] you going do? What you going to do? Not
[1:38:16] the number and then you take it
[1:38:18] afterwards. But you can't stop a man
[1:38:20] speeding. You have the speed gun. Well,
[1:38:22] watching you speeding and the man choose
[1:38:24] to drive straight through. He not even
[1:38:26] watching
[1:38:28] you. One time I know a brother that you
[1:38:30] know that time they have the little
[1:38:31] thing the flag down thing and if they
[1:38:33] flag him down he he keep
[1:38:35] straight. He said he they catching me
[1:38:38] this morning. Sunday morning you
[1:38:40] flagging me down. Say he too straight.
[1:38:42] Put the man to do something else.
[1:38:46] So the police have no power to stop any
[1:38:47] car. They have authority. That's right.
[1:38:50] They come out with uniform. Yes. And
[1:38:51] when they say uniform, a man come out
[1:38:52] there
[1:38:54] close police. He can't come with plain
[1:38:56] clothes and try to stop no car and like
[1:38:58] you have plain clothes
[1:39:00] bunks. You have to have uniform. Amen.
[1:39:03] People are respecting no B with little
[1:39:05] clothes. He come with a little three
[1:39:07] quarter pants and come out them ball and
[1:39:08] do so. Who is he? You'll string around
[1:39:10] him. You don't know who he is. You just
[1:39:13] But once they have uniform, amen.
[1:39:15] Screech. Amen. Amen. Amen. Sometime
[1:39:20] small police, you know, fresh recruits.
[1:39:24] They could see they get a good full meal
[1:39:25] yet.
[1:39:27] They could do it some extra food to
[1:39:29] energize them and they doing like this.
[1:39:31] I said, "Good Lord, he's a police."
[1:39:34] But you have to respect that. So I don't
[1:39:37] care if he's a fresh recruit.
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:41] Let the devil say he's a police, she's a
[1:39:47] Yes. Oh, give the Lord some praises,
[1:39:49] [Applause]
[1:39:52] people. Hallelujah.
[1:39:55] It's not the power, it's the authority.
[1:39:59] And that is what God has released to
[1:40:02] you. Amen. But you shall receive power.
[1:40:06] Come on. Come on now. After the Holy
[1:40:09] Ghost come upon you, power is coming.
[1:40:12] But while we wait for power, we're going
[1:40:14] to start to use the authority. In my
[1:40:17] name, we shall cast out devils. We have
[1:40:19] a right to rebuke demon powers in the
[1:40:21] name of
[1:40:22] [Applause]
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:28] Jesus. My God. My God. Hallelujah.
[1:40:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] Right now, we're using Jesus name. We
[1:40:38] using the authority in Jesus name. But
[1:40:41] there's coming hour. We won't even have
[1:40:43] to use Jesus name because that new name,
[1:40:46] the power of God will be manifested so
[1:40:49] bride. She will speak and will create
[1:40:51] itself just like that.
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:41:00] My God. Amen.
[1:41:03] My Lord.
[1:41:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:10] Wondering to continue. Continue,
[1:41:13] brother. Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:41:16] My Jesus. The call to perfection. All
[1:41:18] right. Is a call out of Jacob. Amen.
[1:41:22] Into Joseph.
[1:41:26] Amen. God put a hidden mystery of
[1:41:28] Abraham faith. Hidden mystery Isaac love
[1:41:32] hidden mystery Jacob a story of God's
[1:41:35] grace the rascal believer
[1:41:38] a con man
[1:41:40] and then in Joseph he put perfection
[1:41:45] so when we talk about being called to
[1:41:47] perfection we are being called to be
[1:41:50] Joseph
[1:41:52] and there is nothing
[1:41:56] against Joseph
[1:41:59] that's God working his way out.
[1:42:04] So God hiding you as a seed and around
[1:42:07] you is all trash of flesh and human
[1:42:09] spirit, failures, mind battles and
[1:42:12] trouble. But that seed is still in
[1:42:18] Did you get that? That seed is inside of
[1:42:20] you. Hallelujah. This happened, that
[1:42:22] happened, it doesn't change the seed.
[1:42:25] This failure, shortcomings, it doesn't
[1:42:27] change the seed. The seed is the seed.
[1:42:31] He said you are not the believer. The
[1:42:33] believer is the word in you. The
[1:42:35] believer is a seed in you. It's not even
[1:42:38] you believing. It's what God put in you.
[1:42:44] When the devil was challenged about Job,
[1:42:47] have you considered my man Job? There's
[1:42:49] none like him on the earth. What the
[1:42:51] devil didn't understand, it was God's
[1:42:53] faith in Job.
[1:42:56] That's why God could boast and said,
[1:42:57] "You can't get that man to curse me if
[1:43:00] you try."
[1:43:02] So his wife is the closest one to him
[1:43:04] who said, "Why to curse God and death?"
[1:43:06] And because he had virtue and knowledge
[1:43:08] and temperance and patience and
[1:43:09] godliness because he had character. Job
[1:43:12] say you speak like a foolish woman. The
[1:43:14] man had class.
[1:43:16] The man rough up the woman and terrorize
[1:43:18] the woman and say, "Oh God, look how I
[1:43:20] mine you and I buy house for you and car
[1:43:21] for you and how you treated me." He
[1:43:23] didn't talk that way. He talked like a
[1:43:24] red gentleman. He talked like a real
[1:43:26] Christian. He talked like a real
[1:43:27] believer. How you're supposed to speak.
[1:43:32] But God had confidence in that seed in
[1:43:35] Job. Tell me what God have confidence.
[1:43:38] What about that seed inside of you? I
[1:43:40] say God bragging on you this morning.
[1:43:42] You can't even brag on yourself, but God
[1:43:43] bragging on you because God know you're
[1:43:45] going to make it. God know you're going
[1:43:46] to pull through. You have been through
[1:43:47] hell. You have been through this. You
[1:43:49] have been through that. But you're still
[1:43:50] alive. You're still alive. Give the Lord
[1:43:53] some praise as you're still
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:43:56] alive. Glory, glory, glory.
[1:44:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're going to
[1:44:04] rise. You're going to fall. You're going
[1:44:05] to stumble. You're going to fail. You're
[1:44:07] going to sin. All that is part of the
[1:44:09] package. It doesn't change the seed.
[1:44:14] Oh, glory to God. You know what I said?
[1:44:17] It doesn't change the
[1:44:19] seed.
[1:44:23] Here's why. Here's why. Here's why.
[1:44:25] Here's why. You may be seated. Who you
[1:44:27] following you?
[1:44:31] God is not now knowing you, you know.
[1:44:32] Yeah, boy. He just behave nice, you
[1:44:34] know. He has behaved bad, you know. Oh,
[1:44:36] God. He have no behavior. God, I go
[1:44:39] scratch him off. Yes. Tick. Tick. I go
[1:44:42] through this one. He He quietly spoken.
[1:44:44] He don't say amen at all.
[1:44:46] Tick. He's shy. He's shy. Quiet brother.
[1:44:49] Quiet brother.
[1:44:51] Shik this sister don't open my mouth at
[1:44:54] all. H she like dumb but
[1:44:58] thick. God don't choose
[1:45:01] that. God choose before the foundation.
[1:45:06] Whether you're talking or not talking,
[1:45:07] whether you're dumb, whether you're
[1:45:08] speaking, whether you're tall, whether
[1:45:10] you're fat, whether you're thin, whether
[1:45:12] whatever, it doesn't matter what color
[1:45:13] race creed. Before the foundation, then
[1:45:16] he let the process work out.
[1:45:19] [Applause]
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:23] God not gambling you know. God not
[1:45:25] unlucky over said me and shaking a dice
[1:45:28] hoping that you know I mean you come
[1:45:29] true. God not gambling you know. God is
[1:45:31] not gambling. God is not a gambler.
[1:45:34] Who you
[1:45:37] [Applause]
[1:45:42] oh glory. Sometimes you may be seated.
[1:45:45] Sometimes you may feel so miserable. Why
[1:45:47] me Lord? Why me Lord? You know why?
[1:45:49] Because he forneew
[1:45:51] you. I say it this way. I like to say
[1:45:53] this way. He knew you before.
[1:45:57] And
[1:45:58] before before your weakness, before your
[1:46:01] sin, before your failure, before your
[1:46:04] lies, your fornication, your adultery,
[1:46:06] whatever it is, before all of that, he
[1:46:08] still choose
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:15] you. Hallelujah.
[1:46:17] Then he went on to say in Romans 8:28,
[1:46:20] "If others don't know, we know
[1:46:24] that all things work together for good
[1:46:30] to them that love God to them who are
[1:46:36] the call." Remember the call is the
[1:46:38] fornown. So them for know the call. And
[1:46:42] all things work together for good. Your
[1:46:45] life is not by chance. You can't get in
[1:46:47] his accident. The devil just going to
[1:46:50] come and take your life. You have to get
[1:46:52] permission to
[1:46:54] interfere. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:46:57] we are promised a revival. And we have
[1:47:00] to go through the process to get this
[1:47:03] revival. We are going through the
[1:47:05] process. A seven thunder Christ revival.
[1:47:10] Come on
[1:47:11] tabernacle. You're going to make it.
[1:47:14] We're going to have it. Oh hallelujah.
[1:47:17] The fire going to fall. The power going
[1:47:20] to strike. You will be sealed. You will
[1:47:23] be
[1:47:24] refilled. Oh hallelujah.
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:47] Oh
[1:47:48] glory.
[1:47:51] Hallelujah.
[1:47:53] Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:48:00] God.
[1:48:02] Oh.
[1:48:04] Oh my
[1:48:07] Jesus. Let me see. Oh. Hallelujah.
[1:48:10] Hallelujah.
[1:48:12] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:48:14] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:16] Hallelujah. Don't ever be afraid of the
[1:48:18] process. You want your car license, but
[1:48:20] you have to go through the process of
[1:48:22] doing the driving test. Isn't that
[1:48:24] right? And doing the written test and
[1:48:26] whatever it is. You can't be afraid of
[1:48:28] process. The process is what get you to
[1:48:30] where you're supposed to be. Oh, glory
[1:48:32] to God. There is no way. We can't escape
[1:48:33] it. Oh, glory to God. This mortal must
[1:48:37] put on immortality. You can't just be
[1:48:39] changed like that and you say you have
[1:48:41] to have rapturing faith. That's part of
[1:48:43] the process because you have to believe
[1:48:45] that your body is going to be changed.
[1:48:47] Is that Jesus coming? I'm going to go up
[1:48:49] in the rapture going to rapture. That's
[1:48:50] fine. But you have to understand a power
[1:48:53] has to come in your being. You'll be
[1:48:55] walking with the rapture. Rapture going
[1:48:57] to be inside of you. You like a ticking
[1:48:59] time bomb. A ticking rapture bum. Oh,
[1:49:02] you hear what I say? A ticking rapture
[1:49:03] bomb. The clock is inside of you. You
[1:49:06] are going to change. You are going to
[1:49:08] take off. You are going to be
[1:49:09] transformed. Enoch walked with God and
[1:49:12] was not because God took him. But before
[1:49:15] his translation, he had a testimony that
[1:49:18] he pleased God. Without faith, it can't
[1:49:20] please God. We have faith this morning.
[1:49:22] We have expectation this morning. The
[1:49:24] anointing is in the building this
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:29] morning. Oh,
[1:49:31] glory. Enoch. Enoch mechanics became
[1:49:35] dynamics and that took him. You may be
[1:49:37] seated. Oh hallelujah. Enoch seven for
[1:49:41] madam. Enoch pyramid builder. Enoch walk
[1:49:46] on the seven steps. And the seven step
[1:49:48] identifies your maturity. Your seven
[1:49:51] steps is brotherly love. When you come
[1:49:53] to brotherly love. It identify your
[1:49:55] Christian maturity that you could put
[1:49:57] put yourself in your brother's place.
[1:49:59] And no matter spirit of maturity, when
[1:50:02] you stand praying, you can forgive.
[1:50:04] Spirit of maturity, you don't have to be
[1:50:06] bitter and angry by little petty insults
[1:50:09] and things that people send at you. You
[1:50:11] can overcome that. You can raise above
[1:50:13] that. You are mature. You are right.
[1:50:15] You're ready. Oh, glory to God.
[1:50:18] Hallelujah. To break out from Jacob
[1:50:21] grace into truly perfection.
[1:50:25] [Applause]

[1:50:40] confidence every day, every hour of the
[1:50:43] day, every service. It's not a day
[1:50:45] you're up and tomorrow you're down. You
[1:50:46] have a perfect standing. Oh, I can't get
[1:50:48] to it this much. It's too much. The
[1:50:50] five-fold ministry will take you from a
[1:50:53] perfect standing into a perfect state by
[1:50:55] the ministry of the spirit. Right now,

[1:52:26] to me. You have others you could talk
[1:52:28] to. You they belong to you, not not you.
[1:52:31] I hear from God. I am the Lord thy God
[1:52:34] that heal thee and forgive thee of thy

[1:54:57] years ago and they come and landing here

[1:56:38] keep musician come up, please.
[1:56:40] Hallelujah.
[1:56:42] See, the truth is I haven't even gotten
[1:56:43] into the message.
[1:56:47] What you heard for the past is what I
[1:56:48] got fresh this morning.
[1:56:53] To make a connection with what we have
[1:56:54] to preach. Oh, hallelujah. But let me
[1:56:57] just share this with you. I'm afraid
[1:57:00] there's going to be a lot of
[1:57:01] disappointments at the judgment because
[1:57:04] you know Paul said over in Hebrews they
[1:57:06] wandered about in sheep skkins and goats
[1:57:08] skkins and destitute and afflicted. Look
[1:57:10] at Elijah in his cave. How that if we
[1:57:12] see him come out our door today with
[1:57:14] beard on his face, baldhead shining a
[1:57:17] piece of sheepkin drape around him. We
[1:57:19] probably run out the yard some of our
[1:57:21] intellectual brethren. Yes. Yes. He
[1:57:24] specify
[1:57:26] the brethren that will do that.
[1:57:29] But you see, you don't know what's
[1:57:32] beating behind that little old skin
[1:57:33] there. That's right. The Holy Spirit may
[1:57:36] be tabernacled there. See, you must
[1:57:39] never do that. We must be brothers.
[1:57:43] Treat a man, no matter if he's in wrong,
[1:57:47] still treat him nice. Be nice to him. If
[1:57:51] you haven't got that spirit, there's
[1:57:53] something wrong. Jesus was nice to those
[1:57:57] who are ugly to to him. You must be
[1:58:00] Christians full of love, ready to help
[1:58:03] any race, color, creed, anywhere, any
[1:58:08] time. We must be that way. That's
[1:58:10] Christians. That's the way Christ would
[1:58:12] have us. And to be a Christian is to be
[1:58:15] Christlike. Amen. Amen. Just about two
[1:58:18] more and I'll close. Amen. But I'm from
[1:58:21] think. He said he want to prepare a
[1:58:24] place to take us out this earthly pest
[1:58:26] house. A perfect place where no evil
[1:58:29] exists, no sickness exists, no old age
[1:58:32] exists, no debt exists. It's a perfect
[1:58:34] place calling you to that perfection.
[1:58:37] Amen. That you have to be perfect to get
[1:58:39] there. Hallelujah. The Bible said so.
[1:58:41] Jesus said be there for perfect. Even as
[1:58:43] your fandom is perfect, it's a perfect
[1:58:45] kingdom. So it must be a perfect people
[1:58:47] come because you have to stand and be
[1:58:49] married to a perfect son of God and you
[1:58:52] must be a perfect bride. So how can you
[1:58:55] do it through anything else but the
[1:58:56] perfect word of God? Amen. And he come
[1:59:00] the waters of separation that washes us
[1:59:02] from our sins. The blood of Jesus think
[1:59:04] of it that dripping bloody word. I like
[1:59:07] that. Amen. That dripping bloody word. I
[1:59:10] will close with this. Amen. This is our
[1:59:12] message called the perfection. Friends,
[1:59:14] there is so many things that we could
[1:59:16] say tonight about the perfection. We are
[1:59:19] always trying to gorge the eyes out of
[1:59:21] somebody else to make ourselves a little
[1:59:23] holier than they are. But if we look at
[1:59:26] the picture, it's only God's grace that
[1:59:30] we are what we are. Could we stand and
[1:59:33] give God some worship? Give God some
[1:59:36] praises. May the Lord bless you.
[1:59:39] Continue praying for me. Come out early
[1:59:41] next week.
[1:59:43] Come to the permit on Thursday if you
[1:59:44] can make it out. I come under a great
[1:59:46] expectation. Go and bless you.

[2:10:41] praise this morning? You appreciate the
[2:10:44] Lord this morning. You appreciate the
[2:10:46] Lord Jesus this morning. Oh, blessed be
[2:10:50] the name of the
[2:10:51] Lord. You appreciate the pastor and the
[2:10:54] message this morning. Are you under
[2:10:57] expectation for your time, for your
[2:11:00] season, for your filling, for your
[2:11:03] deliverance? Amen. Amen. What can we
[2:11:07] say? Let's just bow our heads with
[2:11:09] prayer. We have some prayer
[2:11:13] requests for Sister Naomi Storm with
[2:11:16] belly pains.
[2:11:19] for sister Kangi with high blood
[2:11:23] pressure and from sister Christine for
[2:11:26] my father who's in a hospital the
[2:11:27] doctors think it's his kidneys but we're
[2:11:30] unsure and we'd like
[2:11:32] to pray for his healing and the
[2:11:34] salvation of his soul. And if there's
[2:11:37] any unwritten or unspoken request you
[2:11:39] want to show by raise of hands as we
[2:11:42] approach a throne of
[2:11:44] grace. Can we bow our heads? Heavenly
[2:11:46] Father, Lord, we are so humbled this
[2:11:48] morning to be in your presence, Lord.
[2:11:50] And Lord, to hear such words of eternal
[2:11:53] life, Lord. Surely our hearts burn
[2:11:55] within us, Father. And Lord, God, we
[2:11:58] come this morning to your throne of
[2:11:59] grace, Lord, through the blood bringing,
[2:12:01] Lord, your children before you, Lord.
[2:12:04] And Father God, we pray that even now
[2:12:06] you would touch little Naomi with that
[2:12:07] belly pain. Father, may you touch her
[2:12:10] from the crown of her head to the soles
[2:12:11] of her feet, and may she be completely
[2:12:13] healed. Lord, may you touch Sister
[2:12:15] Rosemary Kangley right now, Lord. That
[2:12:18] high blood pressure, we curse it in the
[2:12:20] name of Jesus Christ this morning. And
[2:12:22] we declare that all is well this
[2:12:24] morning. And Lord, for Sister
[2:12:26] Christine's father, Lord, in the
[2:12:28] hospital, whatever this situation is,
[2:12:30] Father, may you touch him, Lord. And
[2:12:32] more importantly, may he come to know
[2:12:34] you by revelation and by experience. And
[2:12:37] Lord, if there's anyone sick in the
[2:12:38] building, Lord, and Lord, we see the
[2:12:40] hands that are raised, Lord. Anyone on
[2:12:42] the internet, Father, anyone who would
[2:12:44] watch this tape, Lord, may they catch a
[2:12:46] hold of faith and know that you are
[2:12:48] still the same yesterday. You are the
[2:12:50] still the same today and forever. May
[2:12:52] you heal your people. May you touch your
[2:12:55] people. May you bless your people. May
[2:12:57] you deliver your people. May you set the
[2:13:00] captives free, Father, in the name of
[2:13:02] Jesus Christ. And Lord, as we prepare to
[2:13:05] leave this house, but not from your
[2:13:07] presence, Father, may you grant
[2:13:09] traveling mercies to your people, may
[2:13:12] you be with each one in the precious
[2:13:14] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we want to
[2:13:16] remember, Lord, our pastor this morning,
[2:13:18] brother Oie, Lord, for standing in the
[2:13:20] gap, Lord. May you touch him from the
[2:13:22] crown of his head to the souls of his
[2:13:24] feet. May you recharge him. May you
[2:13:26] refill him. May you strengthen him,
[2:13:29] Lord. May your Holy Ghost be with your
[2:13:30] people. Granted now in the precious name
[2:13:33] of Jesus Christ and the church says amen
[2:13:37] and amen and amen. You may be seated for
[2:13:40] a few
[2:13:42] announcements. At this time we would
[2:13:44] like to welcome Paul Jones to the
[2:13:45] headstone tabernacle. Can you stand
[2:13:47] please? Welcome. Welcome. Invite my
[2:13:49] brother Jason Rajkumar. We're happy to
[2:13:51] have you with us. We'd also like to
[2:13:53] welcome sister Genevie Thompson. God
[2:13:55] bless you. Thank you for coming. God
[2:13:56] bless
[2:13:58] you. Amen. So for our
[2:14:01] announcements this coming Tuesday,
[2:14:03] there's no service in Maraval. I think I
[2:14:05] mentioned it last week. There'll be no
[2:14:07] services in Maraval until after the
[2:14:09] convention. So we only have one midweek
[2:14:12] service here at the tabernacle on
[2:14:14] Thursday at 7:30 p.m. And of course,
[2:14:16] service continues this coming Sunday. We
[2:14:20] are completely in convention preparation
[2:14:22] mode with only three Sundays before the
[2:14:26] convention. So we're looking for all of
[2:14:28] your support both naturally and
[2:14:31] spiritually as brother Obert said to
[2:14:33] accelerate the prayers because we are
[2:14:35] under great expectation. I have a few
[2:14:38] other announcements and um then brother
[2:14:41] Blackman will come to address a few
[2:14:48] issues. Okay. We also want to welcome
[2:14:51] brother Ad Sabu. Uh welcome. God bless
[2:14:54] you.
[2:14:57] and his wife is here as well. God bless
[2:15:02] you. And uh group one maintenance team,
[2:15:05] please meet with brother Popwell after
[2:15:07] service. And there'll also be a choir
[2:15:09] practice after service. So that's all
[2:15:12] the announcement. Service continues next
[2:15:14] Sunday. There'll be work after service
[2:15:16] today and for the next three Sundays as
[2:15:18] well. We solicit your support and if you
[2:15:21] are available during the week at all
[2:15:23] over the next coming weeks in
[2:15:25] preparation for the convention, please
[2:15:27] speak to brother Shane. And generally as
[2:15:29] we get nearer to the convention, we'll
[2:15:31] be looking for some support in a number
[2:15:33] of different ways. So at this time, I'd
[2:15:35] like to invite brother Michael Blackman
[2:15:36] to the pullpit. He's our operations
[2:15:38] director.
