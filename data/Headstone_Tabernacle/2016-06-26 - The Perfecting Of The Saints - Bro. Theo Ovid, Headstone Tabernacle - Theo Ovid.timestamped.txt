[0:00] We lift our hands before you. We lift
[0:03] our hearts to you. We lift our voices to
[0:06] you, Jesus. Yes,
[0:09] Lord. Thank you,
[0:12] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[0:18] Lord. Blessed be his wonderful
[0:21] name. You're glad to be here this
[0:25] morning. If you have your Bibles, I'd
[0:27] like you to turn with me to Psalms
[0:30] reading chapter 84. Just a couple
[0:35] [Music]
[0:42] verses. And it
[0:45] says, "How am I ever like tabernacles,
[0:49] oh Lord of hosts, my soul longeth,
[0:53] yay, even faintth for the courts of the
[0:57] Lord. My heart and my flesh cryth out
[1:00] for the living God. Yay, the sparrow had
[1:03] found in house, and the swallow a nest
[1:04] for herself, where she may lay her
[1:07] young, even thine altars, oh Lord of
[1:09] hosts, my king and my God. Blessed are
[1:12] they that dwell in thy house. They will
[1:15] still praising thee, sailor. May we bow
[1:18] our heads as we open in a word of
[1:19] [Music]
[1:22] prayer. Oh heavenly father, this morning
[1:24] we deem it such a great privilege to be
[1:26] gathered together in your house once
[1:28] more, Lord. Lord, we just thank you for
[1:30] the opportunity that you have given us,
[1:32] Lord. Lord, just to worship and praise
[1:35] you, just to hear from you, Lord. Lord,
[1:38] this morning we have come under
[1:39] expectation, Lord. Lord, we have come
[1:42] with a desire in our heart to to receive
[1:45] more of you, Lord. A desire in our heart
[1:47] to be changed and transformed and to
[1:50] leave this place differently than when
[1:52] we first came, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[1:54] you have your perfect will over
[1:56] everything that will take place today,
[1:58] Lord. Lord, be with those that are on
[2:00] their way, Lord. Speak lip to air to
[2:03] your people. I pray that we be able to
[2:05] openly enter in and worship you and and
[2:08] give you king lamb worship because none
[2:11] is worthy like you, Lord. Lord, no one
[2:13] deserves the glory and the honor and the
[2:15] praise like you, Lord. Those that may
[2:17] feel weak and body, I pray that you give
[2:19] them strength, Lord. Those that may be
[2:21] weary, Lord, I pray that you raise them
[2:23] up, so we could give you one blast of
[2:26] praise, Lord. That we could give you the
[2:28] best that we have to offer. that we
[2:30] could worship you in this house and
[2:32] create such an atmosphere that the
[2:34] miraculous could take place this
[2:35] morning. Have your preeminence among us.
[2:38] Be with the musicians, the singers, the
[2:40] worshippers, the helps. Lord, have your
[2:43] perfect will. In Jesus name we pray.
[2:45] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of
[2:48] praise.

[36:39] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[36:42] we all come in the in the unity of the

[37:46] Wonderful. Because the saints have to
[37:48] come to perfection.
[37:51] We have got to return to the ministry of
[37:53] Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. In other words,
[37:55] God have to use somebody's bodies flesh
[37:58] bodies to raise the dead. That that's
[38:01] how it going to work. Somebody going to
[38:03] be a channel of God for his spirit to
[38:06] flow through. And that body going to be
[38:08] his wife his bride. His people nothing
[38:13] going to stop it because the mouth of
[38:14] the Lord had spoken it. Amen. We spoke
[38:17] some time back about prophecy and
[38:18] process that for Jesus born in
[38:20] Bethlehem, they had a call for taxation
[38:22] to get Joseph out from where he is.
[38:25] Leave Joseph in his comfort zone, he
[38:27] stay right there and Mary have the baby
[38:28] right there. But that will break the
[38:30] scriptures. So in order that the
[38:31] scriptures be not broken, God have to
[38:33] force the issue to get the re the train
[38:36] moving to get things turning and to get
[38:39] you to connect with your scriptures. God
[38:42] have to get the train around your life
[38:44] moving. So God will create situations
[38:47] and issues in order to bring you into
[38:50] the fulfillment of your word of
[38:52] prophecy.
[38:54] Hallelujah. It's not coming to you. You
[38:56] are going to it.
[39:00] Hallelujah. In other words, you have to
[39:02] come into your position. You wasn't born
[39:04] into it. You have to come into it.
[39:06] Hallelujah. Praise God. You are
[39:08] predestinated to it. So therefore, you
[39:11] got to walk out of what you're in to go
[39:12] into what God want you to be in. Isn't
[39:15] that right? Redemption is always in two
[39:17] parts. Coming out of and going into or
[39:19] unless people come out in this message.
[39:20] But have what have they gone into?
[39:22] Praise God. Another denomination,
[39:24] another cult, another group of people
[39:26] just gathering together. But there's a
[39:28] promised land called Ephesians land.
[39:30] There's a land of Ephesians. Joshua
[39:32] didn't cross over just to cross over. He
[39:34] crossed over to give them inheritance.
[39:37] Come on now. Moses ministry could only
[39:40] take them out. Come on now. I'mma say it
[39:43] again. Moses anointing, Moses ministry
[39:47] could only bring the people out. It take
[39:50] what? Joshua anointing. It take the Holy
[39:52] Ghost anointing. It take the ministry of
[39:54] the spirit to take the people in. For 40
[39:57] years, we had Moses. You're not hearing
[40:00] what I'm saying? Come out the Baptist.
[40:02] Come out of Methodist. Come on. Come on.
[40:03] Come on. Come out. But there's got to
[40:05] come a when we no longer coming out, but
[40:09] we are going in to our land of promise,
[40:12] to your inheritance, to your land.
[40:15] Hallelujah.
[40:19] You may be seated. Praise God. Oh my.
[40:23] When somebody got sold out in the Old
[40:25] Testament, they had to wait either two
[40:27] things. somebody to bail them out, pay
[40:30] for them out, some rich man, willing and
[40:31] rich to bail them out and and pull them
[40:33] out or wait for the year of Jubilee
[40:36] because the year of Jubilee provided the
[40:38] grace of God for you to be delivered
[40:40] whether you had the money or not. Amen.
[40:42] So if you're in slavery and some rich
[40:44] uncle could pull you out, they could pay
[40:45] for you when you get out. But in case
[40:47] you have no rich uncle or no rich family
[40:49] or nobody to redeem you, you have to
[40:51] wait till the Jubilee come. And when the
[40:54] Jubilee come, somebody going to start to
[40:56] blow some trumpets. You'll hear some
[40:57] trumpets start to blow. A trumpet going
[40:59] to start to give a certain song that you
[41:02] don't have to sin no more. You don't
[41:03] have to backslide no more. You don't
[41:05] have to be up and down no more. You
[41:07] don't have to surrender to the devil no
[41:09] more. Come on now. No man could bind you
[41:13] anymore. No preacher, no pastor, no
[41:16] minister. You're married to no man
[41:18] behind the pulpit. You're married to
[41:20] Jesus Christ. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[41:23] of praise.
[41:28] [Music]
[41:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[41:32] Hallelujah.
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:37] I love freedom. I love freedom. I like I
[41:41] love freedom. Hallelujah. And you must
[41:42] be free to shout and jump and I must be
[41:44] free to bust the word right in your
[41:46] face. Bring both of us free this
[41:48] morning. Oh, give the Lord some shouts
[41:50] of praises. You want truth. You want
[41:53] truth. You don't want psychology. You
[41:55] want the truth because the truth is what
[41:57] going to set you free.
[42:03] All right.
[42:05] Let's get on now. Come on. Amen. All
[42:07] right. From the guide Justin fulfill.
[42:12] Now remember this. These are the things
[42:16] he's talking about. The first the the
[42:18] night the morning he preaches touch of a
[42:20] perfect man where he had all the
[42:22] virtues, faith and knowledge and
[42:23] temperance and patience. This is the
[42:24] night service. He's preaching the guide
[42:27] and he's he's going back now and
[42:29] connecting to the morning service. He
[42:31] said these are the things that build the
[42:34] servant of Christ. See faith first then
[42:38] virtue. He didn't say church is the
[42:40] thing that build. He didn't say people
[42:42] is the thing that build. He didn't say
[42:44] deacon and elders and trusty is that
[42:46] build the servant of Christ. That might
[42:48] build a man ministry and reputation. But
[42:50] these are the things which is faith and
[42:53] virtue. You can't see those things.
[42:55] Those are invisible things. You could
[42:57] see a building. You could see officers
[42:59] stand on their post of duty. That's
[43:00] things you could see with your eyes. But
[43:02] you see these things, these are inside
[43:04] things. These could only manifest
[43:06] through the flesh, through the body. It
[43:08] had to thunder. It had to rip off. The
[43:10] word didn't remain word. In the
[43:12] beginning was the word. It was
[43:13] invisible. Hallelujah. And the word
[43:15] become flesh. That is how the word
[43:17] become visible and dwell among us. And
[43:19] that same invisible word that you're
[43:21] reading all these years, you're hearing
[43:23] all these years, that word has to become
[43:27] flesh.
[43:29] Could I get a shout in the house?
[43:34] I am not your priest.
[43:39] The Catholic church have that. All
[43:41] right.
[43:42] But the priest is the man and he just do
[43:44] a little wafer thing and you're good to
[43:45] go. This is for all of us. Amen. Lady
[43:49] members, anybody believers, worshippers,
[43:52] all of us, that word have to register
[43:55] inside your system. Those virtues have
[43:58] become part of your being, part of your
[44:00] very life. You made a pledge last week
[44:02] to pray without ceasing until these
[44:05] virtues become part of your system. We
[44:08] said, how many pledges this by the grace
[44:10] of God, how have your prayer week been?
[44:12] Hallelujah.
[44:13] [Applause]
[44:15] Hallelujah. You have to make a personal
[44:17] investment in these virtues. Hallelujah.
[44:21] This better than unit trust. This better
[44:23] than bank and putting the money in the
[44:25] bank. This is investing in doing virtues
[44:27] because when Satan sees it as register,
[44:29] but Satan does recognize it. He might
[44:32] recognize your tie and your clothing.
[44:33] But when he see these virtues, it has he
[44:35] has recognized it because it thunders.
[44:38] Oh, it shake the devil. My you could go
[44:40] free. You are more powerful than you
[44:42] think. Oh my. You sit there watching me
[44:45] with all that potentials inside of you.
[44:47] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise
[44:50] God. Them demons say, "Paul, I know
[44:51] Peter. I know that's the same man who
[44:53] denied Christ." That's the same man who
[44:55] was cursing. But them demons recognize
[44:57] not Peter. It what was inside of Peter,
[44:59] what's flowing out of Peter. Oh, glory
[45:02] to God. And that them devil going to
[45:03] recognize what's flowing out inside of
[45:05] you. The devil don't believe who you
[45:07] are. The devil don't know who you are.
[45:09] But but you shall know as you are known.
[45:12] You shall know as you are known. God
[45:14] know you a certain way. But you're going
[45:17] to come into that perfect knowledge.
[45:19] You're going to come from partial
[45:20] realization into perfect realization.
[45:23] You're going to come into a complete
[45:24] realization of where you come from,
[45:26] where you're going, and who the devil
[45:28] is. And sin don't have to grip you no
[45:30] longer. We want to break that off of you
[45:33] this morning. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes.
[45:36] And when that broken off, you'll be
[45:38] shouting, you'll be screaming, you'll be
[45:40] jumping. You'll be hallelujah.
[45:46] [Music]
[45:48] Every service you supposed to be going
[45:51] more and more free.
[45:56] Every service.
[45:59] You are nearer than when you first
[46:01] believe.
[46:02] [Applause]
[46:04] Now watch. When God gave Abraham the
[46:06] promise, you're going to have Isaac. God
[46:08] didn't tell Abraham 25 years from now,
[46:09] you having Isaac now. No. What? For
[46:11] Abraham to go and do everything else and
[46:12] then 240 year Abraham appearing.
[46:16] Yeah. Abraham reappear after 24 years
[46:19] and say, "Lord, I already know. No, God
[46:21] didn't do that. Just give him a promise.
[46:23] Hold that.
[46:25] I can't lie. I am God. I give you that
[46:29] promise. You can't bring it to pass by
[46:31] yourself. So don't play self-righteous
[46:33] and and puffed up. Just speak about it.
[46:36] Just testify about it. Just prophesy it.
[46:40] Get the ministry of the word to prophesy
[46:42] that you're going to have this virtue
[46:43] and knowledge and temperance and you
[46:45] will have this son. You don't hear what
[46:47] I'm saying. Just prophesy to the world.
[46:50] You're going to have faith and virtue
[46:51] and knowledge and temp. You going to
[46:52] have Isaac. You're going to have his
[46:54] son. Your body old. You're barren.
[46:56] Hallelujah. You're struggling for years,
[46:58] but God said so. And God can't lie. You
[47:01] can't explain how it going to come to
[47:02] pass. All you know it going to come to
[47:04] pass. Oh, glory. The devil's a lie. I
[47:06] don't care what you have done. He chose
[47:08] you. He said, "You have not chosen me.
[47:12] I have chosen you." Oh, give the Lord a
[47:16] shout in the house.
[47:24] You see when I say give the Lord a
[47:25] shout, I mean that, you know, because
[47:27] you see when you shout, you're backing
[47:29] up your doubts. Amen.
[47:31] [Applause]
[47:33] Amen. You see when you just watch the
[47:35] word according watching the word you
[47:36] hear the picture and you're watching it.
[47:38] You're watching it. Watching it like a
[47:40] horse. You bring the water and you
[47:41] watching the water.
[47:44] Drink horse. Drink horse to horse and
[47:45] want to drink horse say nice water but
[47:47] nice water. Nice water.
[47:49] It is nice water. But you can't taste it
[47:52] if you're not partaking of it. When you
[47:54] start a party say this eating good. This
[47:56] really nice. I eating the cake and you
[47:58] watching you you don't know it tasting I
[48:00] can tell you it tasting nice but you're
[48:01] dribbling your your mouth watering until

[48:10] be in service God you have more of this
[48:12] thing this thing eating real nice
[48:14] there's the best thing God send a
[48:16] prophet God take away the prophet God
[48:19] have so much confidence in us he could
[48:20] drop 40 plus years in this message and
[48:23] we not moving
[48:30] We stand against principalities, powers,
[48:33] ministers, unbelievers, six sealed
[48:36] preachers, backsliding ministers,
[48:38] backsliding believers, all kind of
[48:40] spirits for all these years. And guess
[48:42] what? We still
[48:44] standing on fire. Not not bored and half
[48:48] dead. No, we still on fire as when we
[48:51] first started out. Just as strong. Just
[48:55] as strong. Just as strong. Give me my
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:05] mountain. Oh,
[49:08] hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Since
[49:12] 1975, I have been looking with his hour
[49:15] and I am nearer than when I first
[49:17] believe. We going to preach a gospel
[49:20] with power, with signs, with wonders,
[49:23] with miracles.
[49:25] right before your eyes. We going to have
[49:27] a seven thunder revival on this island
[49:32] in this church. Oh,
[49:35] hallelujah. Oh, you talk about a second
[49:37] coming. It already
[49:47] started. I said, "Nobody can run me out
[49:50] of this message. They're crazy. Amen.
[49:52] Run me out of this inspiration, this
[49:53] revelation. There have to be nuts. What?
[49:57] Amen. Is not man call you? Is not man
[50:00] call me? Is man give me revelation? If
[50:03] man give me revelation, they can take it
[50:04] back. If they give me a party card, they
[50:06] take back the party card. But when
[50:08] pillar of fire, flesh and blood have not
[50:11] had not revealed this unto you. But
[50:15] my father hath revealed and the gates of
[50:21] hell feel like dancing this morning. And
[50:24] the gates of
[50:37] hell my what a place to be in. Nothing
[50:41] can stumble you. Nothing can throw you
[50:44] off. You don't even want to have an
[50:46] excuse. You just want to deliver the
[50:48] goods. Lord, report him for duty. Or get
[50:51] the Lord some praises. Man on fire for
[50:56] God.
[51:00] [Applause]
[51:04] Understand this. Many wise men would
[51:07] have liked to be here. Yes, Daniel was
[51:09] getting revelation pouring upon him. And
[51:11] Daniel said, "I understood not."
[51:15] When God had to drop it on Daniel, so he
[51:17] said, "I understood not."
[51:20] God said, "Daniel, go thy way." The book
[51:23] is sealed till the time of the end.
[51:26] Because with the unsealing of the book
[51:29] come the unsealing or the unveiling of
[51:31] sons.
[51:33] For hundreds of years, they had church
[51:34] members. It's the first time God went
[51:37] and pulled the veil, offer some
[51:40] mysteries called sons. You see how them
[51:43] big technical companies that hide all
[51:45] the secrets and and license and cover it
[51:48] up and only reveal it to to put it on
[51:49] the market. But God was hiding some
[51:51] stuff. He's about to put it on the
[51:54] market.
[51:58] Are you hearing what I'm saying? All
[52:01] along sometime they have something
[52:03] called R&D. It is called research and
[52:05] development. They spend billions of
[52:08] dollars doing research and development
[52:10] of different products and they have the
[52:12] hackers want to hack into the computers
[52:14] to find out what the researching about.
[52:16] But the devil couldn't hack this one
[52:18] because when the seven seal broke, when
[52:21] the seventh seal broke, there was
[52:23] silence. So the old hacker couldn't hack
[52:26] this. Oh, but I'm telling you the
[52:29] silence about to be broken. And what God
[52:32] hid under those seals, he going to rip
[52:36] the veil off of
[52:42] it. Oh,
[52:45] hallelujah.
[52:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[52:50] glory to God. So now, now because people
[52:54] could hack and see what you're writing
[52:56] in the emails, they have something
[52:57] called encrypted communication.
[53:00] Hallelujah. all tied up. They can't
[53:02] unveil it. They can't go. That's how God
[53:04] communicating with his sons is encrypted
[53:07] communication. So the devil can't
[53:09] intercept what God is telling you. The
[53:12] devil devil can't do anything about your
[53:15] healing. The devil can't do anything
[53:17] about your deliverance. The devil can't
[53:19] do anything about your breakthrough. Oh,
[53:22] give the Lord a shout. My God, I feel
[53:24] the windows of heaven is about to break
[53:27] upon your life.
[53:33] [Applause]
[53:43] [Music]
[53:45] It's always it's always a question when
[53:49] it's not manifested. Yes. Did he say so?
[53:51] Did he say so? Did he say would he do
[53:52] it? Will he do it? When it's manifested
[53:54] is a shut the devil's mouth. It's a shut
[53:57] them out of the critics. You're sick.
[53:58] The doctor say you go dead. You're sick.
[54:00] You're sick. You're sick. But when
[54:01] you're healed, what the doctor going to
[54:02] say?
[54:05] The doctor had to keep quiet. God want
[54:07] to unveil this bride. He want to bring
[54:10] out a church that he could be proud of.
[54:13] A perfect church where sin can't even
[54:15] stay. A church that love him, that don't
[54:19] fear
[54:20] hell. You You hear what I'm saying? A
[54:24] church that have a love for God, a love
[54:26] for his people, a love for his word, a
[54:28] love for his objective and motive, a
[54:30] love to see his desire fulfilled. I must
[54:34] be about my father's
[54:37] business. I always do that which pleases
[54:41] a bunch of ministers. No, pleases my
[54:44] father.
[54:46] Ministers angry, let them huggy be
[54:48] angry.
[54:50] I don't want my father to be angry.
[54:55] Oh glory. Oh glory. Glory. Come on you
[54:59] Gentiles. God call you to be
[55:02] individuals. God call you to stand as
[55:04] men. Stand as woman. Not stand as a
[55:07] church group. Church group will fail. It
[55:10] has failed. But an
[55:13] individual standing upon that
[55:18] rock. Amen.
[55:24] [Applause]
[55:35] [Music]
[55:36] Faith first virtue. Remember the Holy
[55:41] Spirit cannot cap the building of God
[55:47] until these things are operated by the
[55:52] spirit.
[55:54] Amen. Now these are careful words and
[55:57] spirit given words. He could have said
[56:00] operated by revelation but he didn't say
[56:03] that. He said the virtues have to be
[56:06] operating by the spirit. In other words,
[56:09] it had to operate at the subconscious
[56:11] level
[56:14] where it is automatic.
[56:18] At the conscious level, you have to be
[56:20] nice. You have to smile. You just had a
[56:22] call with your husband, but somebody
[56:23] knock on the door and you can't open it
[56:25] like that. You have to change from that
[56:27] oh mean look into the smile look because
[56:30] somebody's at the door. That is you
[56:32] working the thing.
[56:39] But when it's operating by the spirit,
[56:41] you talk to your husband, right? You
[56:43] talk to your wife, right? You talk to
[56:46] whoever at the door, right? Because you
[56:48] are just right. It's the spirit that's
[56:52] operating within your soul.
[56:55] [Applause]
[56:59] What is it? You are dying and Christ is
[57:03] coming to life.
[57:05] I'll say it again. You are dying and
[57:10] Christ is coming to life.
[57:16] Then you begin to see things in your
[57:17] life that you know you can't do. Then it
[57:20] is him. It can't be you. Oh, hallelujah.
[57:24] Come on now. Come on now. Help me
[57:26] somebody.
[57:32] Hallelujah. So these virtues have to be
[57:36] operating by the spirit. Or it could be
[57:39] operating by the spirit if the spirit
[57:40] income come. So the spirit is promised.
[57:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. I know it's not
[57:48] preached like that.
[57:50] Amen. As a promise. Amen. But it is a
[57:53] promise. Jesus, he had Moses ministry
[57:57] to bring them I like those words as far
[58:00] as to Bethany. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[58:04] how the word Bible describes. He brought
[58:05] them up as far as the Bethany and he was
[58:09] taken up and they wave him bye-bye.
[58:13] That's as far as he could take them.
[58:15] Now, now, now Joshua, which is
[58:17] represented by Holy Spirit because Jesus
[58:20] prophesied, "If I don't go, the
[58:21] comforter will not come." So, don't try
[58:23] to hold on to me. Word word.
[58:28] [Applause]
[58:30] I caught
[58:31] you. They like the word made flesh. They
[58:34] like him breaking bread and making more
[58:36] fish and healing the sick and whatnot.
[58:37] He said, "But listen, I got to go." He
[58:39] said, "Oh, no. Don't go." He said, "I
[58:40] got to go. If I don't go confident, I
[58:42] will not come."
[58:45] Amen. My ministry to bring you up to
[58:46] this spot, but the Holy Ghost in the
[58:49] upper room, he going to take you
[58:51] further. Amen. He going to break upon
[58:54] your life. All you got to do now is to
[58:56] create the atmosphere for him to come
[58:58] down because Holy Ghost got come and
[59:00] dry. Holy Ghost can't come on dumb
[59:03] mouths and people m Holy Ghost can't
[59:06] come on that. Holy Ghost can't come on
[59:08] sin. Holy Ghost can't come on you not
[59:10] worshiping and praising God. So you have
[59:12] to connect with Revelation chapter 5.
[59:16] When the lamb took the book, you believe
[59:18] a prophet, you believe all the sea is
[59:19] open and you can't worship God,
[59:21] something is wrong. You have to see your
[59:23] name. If you see your name, you
[59:35] Let me drop this on you. The devil
[59:39] deceives all
[59:43] on the earth
[59:45] except
[59:48] those who have their names written.
[59:53] If you know and know your name is
[59:55] written
[59:56] which trial, which testing, what to
[1:00:00] come, what what condition, what can
[1:00:03] separate you from.
[1:00:14] You may be seated.
[1:00:17] Amen. Britain UK walk out of the euro
[1:00:21] zone
[1:00:23] $3 trillion was lost on Friday
[1:00:27] off the market
[1:00:29] three there plenty zeros after the one
[1:00:35] there's a whole lot of
[1:00:37] zeros just like
[1:00:39] that something had to wreck the
[1:00:41] financial market of the world to bring
[1:00:44] on a new system
[1:00:46] I call it beast system. Amen.
[1:00:51] Amen. That one could dominate with trade
[1:00:53] and commence because the Bible said they
[1:00:56] wouldn't be able to buy or sell unless
[1:00:59] they take the mark of the beast.
[1:01:02] And all that dwell on the earth shall
[1:01:04] worship
[1:01:05] the beast. Who you worshiping this
[1:01:08] morning?
[1:01:09] [Applause]
[1:01:13] It's not rich people worshiping the
[1:01:14] beast and the hip hoppers worshiping the
[1:01:16] beast. No. Poor rich bun, free, church
[1:01:23] people, non-church people, drunkards,
[1:01:26] whatever. All except
[1:01:32] then when we preach the word somehow
[1:01:36] your father, the lord, the spirit has to
[1:01:40] reveal to you where your name is on that
[1:01:43] book. I can't do it. I am not the
[1:01:46] revealer. I am not the revelator. God
[1:01:49] is. He alone have the sovereignity to
[1:01:53] reveal this thing to whomsoever he will.
[1:01:56] That's why every service you ought to be
[1:01:59] excited. You ought to be under
[1:02:01] expectation. You ought to loose
[1:02:04] yourself. Free yourself. Enjoy yourself
[1:02:08] in his presence. Oh, do I hear a shout
[1:02:13] in the house? Oh,
[1:02:16] hallelujah.
[1:02:18] Hallelujah. Doomed devils are on the
[1:02:21] run. You are going to go free.
[1:02:34] Glory.
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:43] Amen.
[1:02:44] Amen.
[1:02:46] Once you see your name and you
[1:02:49] understand by revelation that your name
[1:02:52] is on that book and that book is the
[1:02:54] book of redemption and the redemption
[1:02:57] have redemptive rights. Then you have to
[1:03:00] want to know what is your right. If you
[1:03:05] are a citizen of this country you
[1:03:07] supposed to have rights in this country.
[1:03:09] You're not a foreigner. You're not a
[1:03:12] stranger. You can't walk like you're not
[1:03:14] sure that you belong. Every place you
[1:03:18] put your foot becomes yours. Oh God,
[1:03:24] help me Jesus. Help me. God, you may be
[1:03:27] seated. Understand this. The people was
[1:03:30] in is in Egypt under Pharaoh. God said,
[1:03:34] "I'm going to bring it a land that's not
[1:03:36] yours."
[1:03:38] Amen. Amen. That's right. They come out
[1:03:41] of bondage and God say that land is
[1:03:43] yours from this border to that border to
[1:03:45] that border. But there's a fine print.
[1:03:47] You have to place your foot on it.
[1:03:51] You can't use binoculars and say that
[1:03:52] land is mine. You know all down there
[1:03:54] all down there and you're looking
[1:03:55] through some spy glasses. No, no, no.
[1:03:57] God say by your spy glasses you go see
[1:03:59] it. You go read it. You want to put your
[1:04:02] foot on it. You want to put your hand on
[1:04:05] the neck of the lion. Yeah, you want to
[1:04:08] put your hand on top the ears of the
[1:04:10] beer. Oh, you not hear what I'm saying.
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:16] People said they get frightened already.
[1:04:17] Lion and so how you face Goliath.
[1:04:21] You think it's lion and bear go boast
[1:04:23] about it. Have a bigger trial coming.
[1:04:25] Why you think the man the song will
[1:04:27] sing? No matter what's in store, I will
[1:04:29] praise the Lord. When that lion come in
[1:04:31] front of your house, I want to hear you
[1:04:32] praising the Lord.
[1:04:36] I'm not making it easy for you. I'm not
[1:04:39] bringing some Kentucky Fried Chicken for
[1:04:41] you. I'm telling you this is real.
[1:04:45] Judgment is already set.
[1:04:51] Any day this is going to go down.
[1:04:55] America go be under w
[1:04:58] because the
[1:05:00] iniquity has rose up to God. And the cup
[1:05:04] of iniquity is about full. When God say,
[1:05:07] "I had enough." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:05:11] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:15] Hallelujah.
[1:05:17] Didn't plan to read this, but I'm going
[1:05:18] to read it for you.
[1:05:22] Oh, glory.
[1:05:25] Wonderful.
[1:05:31] Revelation chapter 8. And when he had
[1:05:32] opened the seven seals, there was
[1:05:34] silence in heaven about a space of half
[1:05:36] an hour. And I saw the seven angels
[1:05:40] which stood before God. And to them were
[1:05:44] given seven trumpets. And another angel
[1:05:47] came and stood at the altar having a
[1:05:49] golden sensor. There was given unto him
[1:05:52] much incense that he should offer it
[1:05:55] with prayers of all saints upon the
[1:05:58] golden altar which was before the
[1:06:00] throne. and the smoke of the incense
[1:06:04] which came with the prayers of the
[1:06:06] saints ascended up before God out of the
[1:06:10] angel's hand. And the angel took the
[1:06:13] sensor and filled it with fire of the
[1:06:15] altar and cast it onto the earth. And
[1:06:18] there were voices and thunderings and
[1:06:22] lightnings and an earthquake.
[1:06:26] Amen. Did you hear that? Amen. Amen.
[1:06:28] With the prayers of the saints, angel,
[1:06:31] to take the incense, cast it upon the
[1:06:34] earth. Amen. And there were tundants,
[1:06:36] voices, lightning, and an earthquake.
[1:06:40] All that tie together.
[1:06:43] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] We approachment. We approaching the
[1:06:47] judgment hour. God sent Elijah before
[1:06:51] that terrible day of the Lord.
[1:06:54] Oh, hallelujah. Could somebody say amen?
[1:06:58] Amen. Don't forget that. Now, this is
[1:07:00] here first. First, your faith, virtue,
[1:07:02] knowledge, and so forth is to be added
[1:07:04] to it until the complete stature of
[1:07:06] Christ is made manifest. Then the Holy
[1:07:09] Spirit comes upon it and seals it as one
[1:07:12] body, and by your fruit you shall known.
[1:07:15] And when all this takes place, watch,
[1:07:19] the place of worldliness and
[1:07:21] ungodliness, all unbelief is cast out.
[1:07:23] All the things of the world is passed
[1:07:25] away. There's nothing but a new creature
[1:07:26] in Christ. Then grieve not the Holy
[1:07:29] Spirit whereby you are sealed until the
[1:07:31] day of your redemption. The sealing is
[1:07:34] the Holy Spirit. The cap is what seals
[1:07:37] us into the body. The cap seals us into
[1:07:41] the body after all these virtues are
[1:07:43] added from ordination. He said until
[1:07:46] these things are scripturally proven and
[1:07:49] sealed into you, the Holy Spirit seals
[1:07:52] you in as an individual. Amen. So that's
[1:07:55] why taking a refuge in churches is no
[1:07:57] token. And that's what they have
[1:07:59] deceived the people with. That's if the
[1:08:02] church is the Holy Ghost or the church
[1:08:03] give them the right to to the rapture.
[1:08:06] It doesn't give you that. The church is
[1:08:08] like a covering out of the church there
[1:08:10] going to be a bride who going to be wife
[1:08:13] of the lamb or his wife that will make
[1:08:16] herself ready. While all the others just
[1:08:18] washing the cloth and washing the dress,
[1:08:21] his wife going to put on the dress.
[1:08:24] clean and white rashes of the saints.
[1:08:27] Hallelujah. Let us rejoice and be glad
[1:08:29] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:08:31] and his wife not the church members the
[1:08:34] church members hoping to be bridesmaid
[1:08:35] must be but his wife going to make
[1:08:38] herself ready. You got to see something
[1:08:40] to put on. You got to see something to
[1:08:42] act on it.
[1:08:48] [Applause]
[1:08:50] You see religious people they only want
[1:08:51] to hear nice things. Amen. They want to
[1:08:53] hear excited. Oh, I never see it. So, I
[1:08:54] never see it. You had a revelation.
[1:08:58] But bright people, they want things to
[1:09:00] apply. How could I apply? How can I
[1:09:02] change things in my home, in my life, in
[1:09:04] my relationship, in my walk, in my talk,
[1:09:06] in my action, in my attitude. I want
[1:09:07] those things to apply. I don't want to
[1:09:09] hear, here, here. I want to know what to
[1:09:10] apply.
[1:09:14] You have a sore, you have a disease. You
[1:09:16] have a disease. It's a big disease. It's
[1:09:17] a extended disease. I hear that. I want
[1:09:20] a cure. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] You're a sinner. You're a sinner. Yes, I
[1:09:27] know that. I born in sin. Shape
[1:09:28] iniquity. I want deliverance. I want a
[1:09:31] breakthrough. I want redemption. I want
[1:09:33] healing. I want restoration. You're
[1:09:35] back. You're back. Yes. I'm back.
[1:09:37] Sitting.
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:46] The question is if you're going to stay
[1:09:48] back. Amen. The question if you're going
[1:09:49] to stay sick, if you're going to stay
[1:09:51] bound, or if you're going to shake
[1:09:52] yourself like Samson, shake yourself.
[1:09:55] Shake yourself. Sam had to shake
[1:09:56] himself. You know, is he in prison? Is
[1:09:59] he blind? What a effort. What a effort
[1:10:02] to push forward. One opportunity.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah. One opportunity he had. This
[1:10:07] is his last chance. This is the last
[1:10:10] age. This is our final chance. One small
[1:10:13] word.
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:23] It is scary
[1:10:25] because it is dangerous to be lazy. It
[1:10:28] is dangerous to be lukewarm. It is
[1:10:31] dangerous to be dead.
[1:10:34] Former. It is dangerous. God said, "I
[1:10:37] rather you're hot or you're cold. If
[1:10:39] you're cold, I know you're dead. If
[1:10:41] you're hot, you're on fire. But when
[1:10:43] you're lukewarm, you're miserable. Amen.
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:57] Amen.
[1:10:59] Somehow the anchor in Samson held.
[1:11:02] He fell. He backslid. He lost his eyes.
[1:11:06] He lost his joy. He lost a lot of stuff.
[1:11:09] But he didn't lose his God.
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:15] And sometime people feel because you
[1:11:16] fall, you fail, you fail, you backslide,
[1:11:18] that all is lost. That's not true.
[1:11:20] That's a lie. That's a lie. That's a
[1:11:24] lie. That's a big liar. Huge lie. That's
[1:11:28] lie.
[1:11:33] Massive. David never lost his salvation.
[1:11:36] David said, "Lord, restore unto me the
[1:11:40] joy of my
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:56] salvation, wonderful, glory, glory,
[1:11:59] glory,
[1:12:02] wonderful, wonderful, glory.
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:14] Hallelujah. Don't look at me. Worship
[1:12:15] God.
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:21] I didn't come to say all them things.
[1:12:23] There's angels dropping down his voices,
[1:12:27] inspiration, anointing.
[1:12:31] God, there's needs here that God is
[1:12:32] ministering to and the spirit is picking
[1:12:35] it up.
[1:12:42] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] You going to step out after this
[1:12:46] service. You can't stay where you are.
[1:12:48] You got to step out.
[1:12:54] When When Esther recognized the crisis
[1:12:56] at hand, her people was about to be
[1:12:59] destroyed. Esther come to the spot that
[1:13:02] she tell herself if I perish I perish.
[1:13:05] She know the rules. You can't just go
[1:13:07] into the presence of the king. She know
[1:13:09] the laws. But it's one time law or no
[1:13:12] law.
[1:13:14] I'm desperate.
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:23] Said if I perish I perish. If a prayer
[1:13:26] don't stop me, I better go in. If I go
[1:13:28] in church and die than to die in sin and
[1:13:31] unbeliever, I'm going to go. I'm going
[1:13:33] to get a breakthrough. My God give us
[1:13:36] people so hungry for God. They want a
[1:13:39] revival. I don't care who God have to
[1:13:41] change. God have to change the pastor,
[1:13:43] you going to change him. God will turn
[1:13:44] the pastor upside down and shake him
[1:13:46] out. He going to shake him out. Nothing
[1:13:48] must stop the perfecting of the saints.
[1:13:57] God going to pull down this man. God
[1:13:59] going to push out this one. God going to
[1:14:01] shake off this one. But there is going
[1:14:03] to be the perfecting of the saints.
[1:14:10] You are going to come to perfection.
[1:14:14] My hope I get through this today. Oh
[1:14:17] hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:14:21] Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have a
[1:14:26] statement to make.
[1:14:30] A five-fold
[1:14:32] minister will
[1:14:34] be a
[1:14:36] manifestation of a positionally placed
[1:14:39] son of God.
[1:14:43] Amen. That's forget all who say they're
[1:14:45] fivefold. They in their fold.
[1:14:50] That is not the fold God talking about
[1:14:51] when God said for God set the church in
[1:14:55] the church not manappoint appointed not
[1:14:57] somebody voted in this is when God set
[1:15:03] and when God set a man but a Brandon was
[1:15:06] born a prophet he was always a prophet
[1:15:08] but God told him do the work of an
[1:15:11] evangelist until he get
[1:15:15] set
[1:15:18] Could I hear a shout in the house? Are
[1:15:22] you following what I'm preaching? So
[1:15:24] even though he was born a prophet, he
[1:15:27] had to do the work of evangelist until
[1:15:30] until God set him
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:35] and God set him by the opening of six
[1:15:39] seals.
[1:15:41] six.
[1:15:43] Because the word come to the prophet
[1:15:45] because Christ is the seventh seal.
[1:15:50] So the prophet opened six and Christ
[1:15:52] stood there in that prophet as the
[1:15:55] seventh seal and out of the mouth seven
[1:15:59] thunders who roared out to gather the
[1:16:03] bride together to give the bride faith
[1:16:06] to show the bride how to prepare out of
[1:16:08] the mouth of Christ the mighty
[1:16:11] angel. Oh give the Lord a
[1:16:14] shout in the house.
[1:16:22] So the six seals vindicated him as that
[1:16:25] Elijah
[1:16:27] Malachi 4. Now he was ready to reveal
[1:16:30] the son of man who is Christ. Amen. The
[1:16:32] swer of the good seed
[1:16:35] veiled in a son of man. The son of man
[1:16:38] speaking bridal promises.
[1:16:41] Speaking prophecy. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:16:43] hallelujah.
[1:16:44] Are you with me? Wonderful.
[1:16:47] Five-fold minister will be a
[1:16:49] manifestation of positionally placed son
[1:16:52] of God. Amen. In other words, Jesus
[1:16:56] walking on two feet. Amen. Amen. Not
[1:17:00] intellectuals.
[1:17:02] Not church
[1:17:03] politicians and manipulators or message
[1:17:07] popes or spiritual dictators. It have
[1:17:09] all of that. Yes. So don't think I just
[1:17:11] playing with words there.
[1:17:13] We are not talking about a sign of the
[1:17:15] five-fold. Come on. Or a sign of the
[1:17:18] third pole or a sign of adoption. A sign
[1:17:22] points you to the destination. Amen. I
[1:17:25] am speaking about an adopted son veiling
[1:17:29] the pillar of fire. Amen. With seedum.
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:35] Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] Not with quotes,
[1:17:40] not with doctrine, not with teachings
[1:17:43] because Peter was in the body. Yes. He
[1:17:46] was an adopted son. And Peter
[1:17:49] had summar
[1:17:53] in him. So when he went to Cornelia's
[1:17:56] house, while Peter spake, hallelujah,
[1:17:59] the Holy Ghost, the spirit and the word
[1:18:01] was one. When he speak the word, he
[1:18:04] speaking spirit. and other sons got
[1:18:06] quickened,
[1:18:08] made alive.
[1:18:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:13] Hallelujah. Peter was God's channel of
[1:18:17] communication
[1:18:19] for God's inspiration to flow through.
[1:18:23] And we're going to have a repeat of
[1:18:24] that. Peter, the throne of God that was
[1:18:29] once in heaven, that was in Jesus
[1:18:31] Christ, was now in the heart of Peter.
[1:18:34] That's what we talking about. A man
[1:18:37] failed the pill fire.
[1:18:40] Hallelujah. What will it be? It will be
[1:18:43] the ministry of Jesus Christ. It will be
[1:18:47] a ministry of perfection to bring the
[1:18:50] saints to perfection. Oh, glory to God.
[1:18:54] Hallelujah.
[1:19:00] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:03] Amen. Still want to finish the
[1:19:05] statement.
[1:19:07] God picks Amen. and ordains the
[1:19:09] five-fold ministry. Amen. For the body
[1:19:12] of Christ. The entire bride body. So the
[1:19:17] five-fold ministry is not just a local
[1:19:18] ministry. The five-fold ministry will be
[1:19:20] an international ministry that affects
[1:19:24] and influences and speaks to and
[1:19:28] communicates to the entire bride body.
[1:19:35] Amen. Good word. Good word. So what
[1:19:37] Baram taught is that a man must be
[1:19:40] adopted, gifted, and sent out as a five
[1:19:44] for minister. Amen. So we have to do the
[1:19:46] work of what we working at until we are
[1:19:49] placed positionally and sent.
[1:19:52] Hallelujah. And with that authority the
[1:19:55] whole heaven behind those men because
[1:19:59] they are ambassadors of the throne. Did
[1:20:02] you hear what I'm saying? They become
[1:20:05] ambassadors of the throne. Ambassadors
[1:20:07] have special passport. Amen. That
[1:20:09] special rights and liberty and freedom.
[1:20:11] They pass in special quarters and
[1:20:12] special places because they ambassador
[1:20:14] of this country and that country. But
[1:20:16] then you become an ambassador of the
[1:20:18] very throne of God. When you speak, God
[1:20:21] speaks. When you say heaven lock up,
[1:20:23] heaven lock up. When you say heaven
[1:20:25] unlock, heaven unlock. It will be the
[1:20:28] word of God coming forth from the mouth
[1:20:31] of God. Brother Brandham said once more
[1:20:33] the world will hear direct from God. And
[1:20:36] that is not about playing books and
[1:20:37] tapes. He's not talking about that. He's
[1:20:40] talking about man that fail in the
[1:20:43] pillar of fire having the voice of God.
[1:20:47] You're going to know is the voice of God
[1:20:49] because the voice of God brings back
[1:20:52] that real supernatural power.
[1:21:01] Not no high level of word talk, high
[1:21:04] level revelation talk. That is still
[1:21:06] talk.
[1:21:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:17] Hallelujah. Got to perseverance.
[1:21:20] We believe. Amen. There's a church
[1:21:22] coming into that perfection. Amen. The
[1:21:25] ministry of perfection where the
[1:21:27] offices, the apostles and prophets and
[1:21:30] pastors and teachers, evangelists for
[1:21:33] the perfecting of the church, them
[1:21:35] pastors and teachers and so forth will
[1:21:38] be so with the word till they will work
[1:21:41] right up to the coming of the Lord.
[1:21:44] Not with their dreams,
[1:21:46] not with their own private revelation,
[1:21:48] but with the word. Amen. That's why you
[1:21:51] have to know what the prophet prophesy
[1:21:53] because if you don't know it, what
[1:21:54] people interpret it to you, you will
[1:21:56] interpret it as that is the word.
[1:22:00] God not trying to vindicate me. You
[1:22:02] know, God trying to vindicate his word.
[1:22:07] If I die, if I am no longer in his
[1:22:11] pulpit, this word will still be
[1:22:14] vindicated.
[1:22:18] Do you understand that?
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:24] [Applause]
[1:22:28] Hallelujah.
[1:22:30] Jesus. That's why God gives gives Samuel
[1:22:32] the roughening up. Hallelujah. Morning
[1:22:34] for Saul. He said, "Why you more? Why
[1:22:36] you wasting time on Saul?"
[1:22:39] I find a better man.
[1:22:43] God have no time to waste. It's 40 years
[1:22:46] they had Saul. God say time up. They
[1:22:50] choose that spirit of man. Now I'm going
[1:22:52] to get my man. Amen. Go and anoint him.
[1:22:56] Who?
[1:22:58] Amen. One of the son of Jesse. I like
[1:22:59] how God has do things. He used to tell
[1:23:01] me go to tell Zamuel David. David
[1:23:03] David like the process.
[1:23:09] Our God is a awesome God. Do you see
[1:23:12] that? Samuel can go and start looking
[1:23:14] for David. Anybody know who David is?
[1:23:16] All right, David by the thing and he
[1:23:18] anointed with a private ceremony and do
[1:23:19] that. God not operating like that.
[1:23:22] Number one is a tough job to anoint a
[1:23:24] man as king when the next king is alive.
[1:23:27] You're looking to get your head off.
[1:23:30] So the question was how do I do it? He
[1:23:32] said you're going to have fellowship.
[1:23:34] You're going to have feast. You know you
[1:23:37] got to move with wisdom because you're
[1:23:38] killing
[1:23:40] you know baby king on throne. You know
[1:23:44] don't play king when the next king
[1:23:46] around in those days you lose your head
[1:23:47] you know
[1:23:53] so God has avail the whole thing and let
[1:23:56] Samuel go through the process to let
[1:23:58] Samuel know assuredly I don't see as man
[1:24:01] says I see a little different so as let
[1:24:05] them pass through under the may
[1:24:06] recognize there's no spirit witness let
[1:24:08] them keep passing keep moving brothers
[1:24:11] don't up now. Don't handle the line.
[1:24:13] Keep going.
[1:24:15] Whenever pass
[1:24:17] says is this all God will waste time. If
[1:24:22] God send me here for for for a better
[1:24:24] man, it has to have a better man around.
[1:24:26] So you you think you waste time coming
[1:24:28] here this morning? Look,
[1:24:36] you you came for a purpose.
[1:24:38] You came for enlightenment. You You came
[1:24:41] for perfection. You came to raise up
[1:24:43] above where you are. You have to see
[1:24:45] something bigger than you, better than
[1:24:47] you, greater than you, more awesome than
[1:24:49] you, mightier than you that could to
[1:24:51] pull you from where you are to where you
[1:24:53] ought to become.
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:25:04] Brother Clarence had a nice little thing
[1:25:05] for me. Your tongue have no
[1:25:08] bones, but it could break hearts.
[1:25:11] [Music]
[1:25:14] Be careful what you say.
[1:25:18] Be careful with your words. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:21] They say, "Mark, the perfect man."
[1:25:24] He can
[1:25:26] bridle his tongue.
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:31] Glory. Enjoying the Lord.
[1:25:35] Amen. Amen. So therefore the
[1:25:38] dynamics has to come to a five-fold
[1:25:43] ministry. Amen. Amen. Isn't that right?
[1:25:46] Yes sir. There is going to be the
[1:25:49] ministry of Christ. So the the dynamics
[1:25:53] is what will positionally place the
[1:25:55] five-fold ministry. But Abraham in your
[1:25:58] chip report, listen to this. I don't
[1:26:01] really hear ministers talking much about
[1:26:02] this, but I just
[1:26:04] say and my brethren here this morning
[1:26:07] speaking and I pray that each of these
[1:26:09] ministers in here, these ministering
[1:26:13] spirits that God hear my prayer and I
[1:26:16] pray that you will purge that gift
[1:26:20] that's in them.
[1:26:24] and men arrogant. They this this is that
[1:26:29] and they showing the muscles and say
[1:26:31] purge them.
[1:26:34] If they're preachers, make them better
[1:26:36] preachers. Amen. If they're evangelists,
[1:26:40] make them better evangelists. If they're
[1:26:42] teachers, make them better teachers. If
[1:26:44] they're pastors, make them better
[1:26:45] pastors. God grant that they will be
[1:26:48] filled with the spirit of God and will
[1:26:50] be energized by that great supervine
[1:26:54] that will give them life eternal and
[1:26:56] power to minister with and to touch the
[1:26:59] needy world as it is so needy today.
[1:27:03] So he is talking about effective
[1:27:04] ministry. He's talking about empowered
[1:27:07] ministry. He's talking about ministry
[1:27:10] that could only grow as you are purged
[1:27:12] and cleansed and taken through God's
[1:27:14] grinder. otherwise known as place of
[1:27:17] triumph.
[1:27:22] My lord,
[1:27:24] this is what I am seeing right
[1:27:26] now. The first sign of the ministry of
[1:27:31] Christ is power, virtue flowing. Amen.
[1:27:38] And that scripture I have is Mark
[1:27:39] 5:30. And it says here, "And
[1:27:43] Jesus, woman touched him, virtue left
[1:27:46] him." And Jesus immediately knowing in
[1:27:49] himself that virtue had gone out of him,
[1:27:52] turned him about in the press and said,
[1:27:54] "Who touched my clothes?" Amen.
[1:27:57] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The amplified
[1:28:01] said, "And Jesus recognizing in himself
[1:28:04] that power proceeding from him
[1:28:08] had gone forth turned around immediately
[1:28:12] in the crowd and said, "Who touched my
[1:28:14] clothes?" So we talking about not
[1:28:17] revelation, but we're talking about
[1:28:19] resident power. Amen.
[1:28:23] Permanent power, not temporary power.
[1:28:28] Ah,
[1:28:29] The power that they receive in the upper
[1:28:31] room was not temporary.
[1:28:36] What Jesus gave them in Matthew 10 was
[1:28:38] temporary because Judas was there. The
[1:28:41] whole bunch of them had power because
[1:28:43] Jesus put that on them. Amen. They
[1:28:46] wasn't even really saved in that sense.
[1:28:49] Amen. Amen. They was even sanctified.
[1:28:51] They were just disciples. They in
[1:28:54] contact with Jesus and they're like
[1:28:55] Jesus.
[1:28:57] They have Jesus reputation with them.
[1:28:58] Yes.
[1:29:01] Everybody know they with Jesus and they
[1:29:02] have the authority of Jesus. Yes. But
[1:29:04] that wasn't resident in them. Amen. So
[1:29:08] he had to give them promises to say you
[1:29:09] know what you feel you it have to become
[1:29:11] inside of you. That's right. Because
[1:29:12] everybody around it getting part of it.
[1:29:15] Hallelujah. And one time they they say
[1:29:17] Lord we want to stop somebody who doing
[1:29:19] in your name. And they were jealous.
[1:29:21] They're going to fight with people who
[1:29:22] doing things not not with them. Amen.
[1:29:25] They had problems among one another
[1:29:27] who's the greatest who Jesus love more.
[1:29:30] They had own issues. They were men until
[1:29:32] God shake them down and bring them into
[1:29:35] one mind, one heart, one accord and then
[1:29:37] he could step into them. Then nobody are
[1:29:39] not jealous. You had your portion. It's
[1:29:41] one thing to have your portion, man. Oh,
[1:29:44] glory to God. When you have your
[1:29:45] portion, you have nobody else to fight
[1:29:46] up with. Hallelujah. Nobody can steal
[1:29:48] your joy. It's your own. Your own joy.
[1:29:53] You have it. So when Peter had this
[1:29:55] resident thing in him, that is why Peter
[1:29:57] could say, "Silver and gold have I none.
[1:29:59] Such as I have I give and you have to
[1:30:01] have it to give it." Let's go forward.
[1:30:06] Brother Brandham, how God set some in
[1:30:08] the church through labor pains,
[1:30:14] not through conventions,
[1:30:16] not through specials and singing and
[1:30:18] preachings and revelations. No, through
[1:30:20] labor pain. Shout out labor pains.
[1:30:22] Shout it out again. One more time. Shout
[1:30:25] it out. That mean you're making baby.
[1:30:29] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:30:31] You're laboring to bring forth.
[1:30:38] Oh, they get tremendous sometimes.
[1:30:42] You can let the amen float on that one.
[1:30:45] All the time you hear pain, but you get
[1:30:46] tremendous
[1:30:48] now. Right.
[1:30:51] People don't want no pain, you know. No
[1:30:53] pain in a marriage, no pain in the
[1:30:54] relationship. If they give a chance,
[1:30:55] they get no test. Lord, no test.
[1:31:00] So why should anybody, you know, you
[1:31:02] want to go on a job? No interview.
[1:31:04] Just just go in. Just go in.
[1:31:07] A mad man will be doing that.
[1:31:11] That's right.
[1:31:13] If anybody just sending people in the
[1:31:14] job, just just go keep going. Take take
[1:31:16] whatever post you want. Whoever job you
[1:31:18] whatever pay you want you can take that
[1:31:20] too. God carry on his no not even
[1:31:22] natural man run the business like that.
[1:31:25] Amen. That's why I have test
[1:31:27] examination. It have all the interviews.
[1:31:29] It have all these things to filter the
[1:31:31] process because have all types out there
[1:31:34] good bad ugly raga muffin thieves
[1:31:36] bandits.
[1:31:39] That is why God put the angels of God
[1:31:41] tree in the garden of Eden. He said
[1:31:43] least Adam in his condition eat at that
[1:31:45] and go continuing like that with eternal
[1:31:48] life. God said guard it.
[1:31:52] So they have to block Adam from that
[1:31:54] tree. Don't let him touch that tree.
[1:31:58] God has set some in the church through
[1:32:00] the labor pains they get tremendous
[1:32:02] sometime. Then he says, "When a church,
[1:32:04] here we go now, is groaning under the
[1:32:07] persecution of the outside world," that
[1:32:09] is not bandits and robbers and
[1:32:10] drunkards, that's church people. Okay?
[1:32:14] That believing on the Lord Jesus, that
[1:32:16] here we go, the promise of the Holy
[1:32:19] Ghost is just as real to us as it was to
[1:32:22] Pentecost. He didn't say you are the
[1:32:24] Holy Ghost. He didn't say that. He said
[1:32:26] when the church is believing that the
[1:32:28] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:32:30] real as it was to Pentecost. Watch how
[1:32:34] they grown and cry on the labor pains.
[1:32:38] When they are born one and positionally
[1:32:42] born two in the kingdom. Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] Then God sets in the church some
[1:32:48] apostles, some prophets, some teachers,
[1:32:52] some pastors. Hallelujah.
[1:32:56] He don't set them in conventions. He
[1:32:59] don't set them because this one like
[1:33:00] them and this one don't like this one.
[1:33:02] He doesn't set them that way. True labor
[1:33:04] pains. How they grown, how they travail.
[1:33:07] Yes. Yes. Yes. Ministers have to grown
[1:33:10] and travail too.
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:16] If they don't go in and travail, it's on
[1:33:19] their way to tribulation. Because we
[1:33:21] have to birth into the ministry of Jesus
[1:33:24] Christ. It has to come forth. Man have
[1:33:26] to die.
[1:33:28] Amen.
[1:33:32] Amen. Then the Holy Ghost set some in
[1:33:33] the church, apostles, prophets,
[1:33:35] teachers, some pastors, some
[1:33:36] evangelists. Then he gives into their
[1:33:38] speaking in tongues, interpretation of
[1:33:40] tongues, knowledge, wisdom, gifts of
[1:33:42] healing, all kind of miracles. Oh,
[1:33:44] praise God. The pillar of fire is
[1:33:47] identified scientifically and by the
[1:33:49] reaction of it by its character and
[1:33:51] everything else just the same. Then he
[1:33:54] says, as it was when it was dwelling in
[1:33:56] the body of God's only begotten son, so
[1:34:00] does it dwell in the body of his adopted
[1:34:03] sons for the last day. Amen. Amen. The
[1:34:07] same pillar of fire that was in Jesus,
[1:34:09] that pillar of fire going to be adopted
[1:34:11] sons in the last day. Oh hallelujah.
[1:34:15] Tree is perfection.
[1:34:18] There's some soldier in prison now. The
[1:34:21] ministry comes to perfection. This is
[1:34:23] the ministry now. Come on. This is the
[1:34:25] ministry now. There's not the lady yet.
[1:34:26] The ministry. Are you ready? Yes. The
[1:34:29] ministry comes to its perfection when it
[1:34:35] reproduced Christ again in natural.
[1:34:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. Among human beings. I
[1:34:41] like that. Not Christ in spiritual
[1:34:44] talking mysteries. No natural.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:52] You see if it going by higher revelation
[1:34:54] and who are more revelation and who more
[1:34:56] revelated then then the intellectual
[1:34:58] professors and doctorates and degrees
[1:35:00] people in this message who preach this
[1:35:02] message they they adopted already they
[1:35:05] don't they don't need that dynamics
[1:35:07] their head take them higher yes
[1:35:12] but if it has to be a repetition of
[1:35:14] Christ you have to see Christ's own life
[1:35:17] oozing out the
[1:35:20] man But what I'm saying, you wouldn't
[1:35:22] have to say nothing about it. The devil
[1:35:24] make you prove sir. Every one of these
[1:35:26] virtues is in you. That is not you and
[1:35:29] God. Now that you and the devil
[1:35:33] the less amen.
[1:35:36] Hallelujah. He said it will speak
[1:35:39] for itself.
[1:35:41] You won't have to say anything about it
[1:35:43] will speak for itself.
[1:35:46] It will be God working on two feet.
[1:35:50] Listen right now. Right now, Sodom is
[1:35:54] walking on two feet.
[1:35:57] And if Sodom could walk on two feet with
[1:36:00] a rainbow flag, why we can't have good
[1:36:05] walking on two feet with the rainbow,
[1:36:10] not a flag.
[1:36:13] Oh, glory.
[1:36:16] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:36:23] Oh my. If they're so bold to step out,
[1:36:28] we going to step out
[1:36:30] to be like Jesus
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:41] from absolute. He is the
[1:36:44] dynamics of the mechanics, the mechanics
[1:36:48] of the church. What is it?
[1:36:50] Apostles, prophets, teachers, and so
[1:36:54] forth. He is the dynamic that works
[1:36:57] that.
[1:36:58] Aha. So you mean this five-fold ministry
[1:37:01] will be worked by dynamics?
[1:37:05] Oh, hallelujah. It will turn from the
[1:37:07] ministry of the word to the ministry of
[1:37:10] the spirit. What's the objective? Four.
[1:37:13] the perfecting
[1:37:15] of the saints. Oh, hallelujah. It's
[1:37:18] worked by a certain dynamic. He is the
[1:37:20] fire that fires off the gas. He's the
[1:37:23] fire in the combustion chamber. He is
[1:37:25] the power of the resurrection. He is
[1:37:27] God. He is the fire. So, the Holy Spirit
[1:37:30] is from the guide. Watch always speaks
[1:37:33] of the word. I've got many things to
[1:37:35] tell you. You cannot understand it now,
[1:37:37] but when he comes, he will guide you to
[1:37:39] it. Here we go. This is very important.
[1:37:42] That's the reason the coming of the
[1:37:45] seals. At the finishing of the seventh
[1:37:48] seal, the mystery of God should be
[1:37:50] finished to know who God is, what he is,
[1:37:54] how he lives, his nature, his being.
[1:37:57] Here we go. You are supposed to be all
[1:37:59] the way up there by that time.
[1:38:03] Watch. See? And that brings us into the
[1:38:07] full stature of the sons and daughters
[1:38:09] of God. A church that wash in the blood
[1:38:12] of Christ that's bought without money
[1:38:14] without that price. So what is he saying
[1:38:17] at the finishing of the seventh seal? We
[1:38:20] supposed to be way up in the virtues
[1:38:24] with the word. Word on top of word on
[1:38:27] top of word on top of word. What's the
[1:38:29] secret? The word is in the bride. Then
[1:38:32] they're going to come for a five-fold
[1:38:33] ministry. with the ministry of the
[1:38:35] spirit. Amen. To take the bride further.
[1:38:38] Hallelujah. Because you going to be
[1:38:39] perfected. The cap of perfection will be
[1:38:42] the spirit part. Because right now you
[1:38:44] are perfect under the blood. You have
[1:38:46] been redeemed by the word. But then you
[1:38:49] got to get the spirit to cap that.
[1:38:51] Hallelujah. And that is what the
[1:38:52] dynamics is all about. Oh hallelujah. Do
[1:38:55] you believe that? Oh, glory to God.
[1:38:57] Glory to God. Hallelujah. So therefore
[1:39:01] at the finishing of the seventh seal we
[1:39:03] supposed to be way up there. And what it
[1:39:05] is Christ have to come to finish that
[1:39:07] off. Christ is what coming through a
[1:39:09] five ministry. It will be the ministry
[1:39:11] of Christ. Not this man ministry this

[1:39:51] perfect state by the spirit. Amen. Devil
[1:39:53] can't bother with conscience,
[1:39:54] imagination, memory, affection, and
[1:39:56] reasoning. All of that under the control
[1:39:58] of the Holy Ghost. That is an invincible
[1:40:01] army. That's an invisible man. That's an
[1:40:04] invisible woman. She has the word. She
[1:40:06] has the spirit. He has the word. He has
[1:40:08] the spirit. Who going to stop that man?
[1:40:10] You put that in prison, the prison bars
[1:40:12] open up. You not hear what I'm saying?
[1:40:15] Oh, hallelujah. spiritled.
[1:40:22] You say that song in farfetched. No, the
[1:40:24] whole creation is groaning for this
[1:40:27] manifestation that I just share with you
[1:40:30] of the sons of God. They're not growning
[1:40:32] to have church members. They have no
[1:40:34] groaning to have people sitting on a
[1:40:35] church pew that ain't doing anything. We
[1:40:38] had hundreds of years of church pews.
[1:40:40] But what going to shake the system is
[1:40:43] sons of God being unveiled from under
[1:40:46] the seventh seal. Oh, glory to God.
[1:40:49] Coming right out of the book of
[1:40:51] [Applause]
[1:40:53] redemption. There'll be one more ride.
[1:40:56] There'll be one more ride. There'll be
[1:40:58] one more ride. He said, I'll ride this
[1:41:00] trail once more. There'll be one more
[1:41:02] ride. The white horse rider, the Holy
[1:41:05] Ghost himself. There going to be one
[1:41:07] more ride with signs, wonders, and
[1:41:10] miracles made it today.
[1:41:13] Oh, hallelujah. There's going to be one
[1:41:16] more ride.
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:28] Brand a perfect man. He's reading
[1:41:30] Ephesians. What we read some evangelists
[1:41:33] and pastors for the perfection of God?
[1:41:35] No. Does it read like that? No. For the
[1:41:37] perfection of what? The saints. Who are
[1:41:38] the saints? The sanctified ones. You
[1:41:42] ain't a saint until you're sanctified.
[1:41:47] Sound like 50%. Say amen. We're going to
[1:41:50] get to the other 50%.
[1:41:52] You ain't a saint until you are
[1:41:56] sanctified. Amen. So when we say the
[1:41:59] perfecting of the saints,
[1:42:01] we're talking about the perfecting
[1:42:03] of the sanctified ones.
[1:42:07] Hold it right there. Don't don't get too
[1:42:08] nervous. We coming for you. Don't don't
[1:42:10] get too nervous. Coming to get you.
[1:42:13] Perfection of the saints for the work of
[1:42:15] the ministry. Then he says the ministry
[1:42:18] of Jesus Christ. So we know now it's not
[1:42:20] brother's ministry. It's not the other
[1:42:22] minister's brother's ministry. No, we
[1:42:24] have that. But we're talking about the
[1:42:26] ministry of Jesus Christ. And it's only
[1:42:28] a one of that.
[1:42:31] That ministry coming in the form of a
[1:42:33] pastor, form of evangelist, form of a
[1:42:35] prophet, just same ministry. One
[1:42:36] ministry, one ministry. Everybody around
[1:42:38] the world that going to call into this
[1:42:39] fivefold ministry going to have that
[1:42:40] same one ministry. Amen. It's one
[1:42:42] ministry called the ministry of Jesus
[1:42:43] Christ. It will act like Christ, talk
[1:42:44] like Christ, live like Christ, do the
[1:42:46] works of Christ. It'll be just like
[1:42:47] Jesus Christ. How you know about over?
[1:42:49] Look at Ram. He walked like Christ, he
[1:42:52] talked like Christ. He act like Christ.
[1:42:53] He raised the dead like Christ. He
[1:42:54] healed like Christ. He was just like
[1:42:55] Christ. They even thought he was Christ.
[1:43:00] You had to tell them, "I am not he."
[1:43:02] And run for his life. Amen. He was so
[1:43:06] much like Christ. They mistook him for
[1:43:09] Christ.
[1:43:15] You mean it going to happen again? Yes.
[1:43:19] Yes. I'm not talking about taking for
[1:43:21] Christ now. You going to be just like
[1:43:22] Christ. Amen.
[1:43:25] So when the devil see you say I see him
[1:43:26] before you know I see him before
[1:43:29] because Christ done sting him already so
[1:43:31] he don't want to get a second one like
[1:43:33] that I feel that before but boy that
[1:43:35] same presence that was in the wilderness
[1:43:36] that presence that cast me out in
[1:43:39] presence when Jesus run them devils out
[1:43:41] the devil asked permission to go into
[1:43:43] the pigs
[1:43:45] they want to float around they want some
[1:43:47] more mischief to do somebody to get
[1:43:50] invited to jump up that's all them
[1:43:52] devils have to find somebody for
[1:43:53] mischief they have to find somebody to
[1:43:55] to use to do the impish behavior on this
[1:43:58] stuff. I'm waiting for the Holy Ghost
[1:44:00] looking for somebody to use. Somebody to
[1:44:02] use. God looking for somebody. I want to
[1:44:05] hear a bigger amen than that. Open your
[1:44:07] mouth and say amen. He's looking to use
[1:44:09] you.
[1:44:11] The Holy looking to jump on you. Holy
[1:44:14] looking to speak through you.
[1:44:15] Hallelujah.
[1:44:20] Hallelujah. Amen. So this ministry is
[1:44:23] not for you. It's not for me. This
[1:44:26] ministry of Jesus Christ is necessary to
[1:44:28] raise the dead
[1:44:31] because the Lord does all three. The
[1:44:33] shout, the voice, and the trump. So it
[1:44:35] has to be Christ ministry come back.
[1:44:38] It's not man raising the dead.
[1:44:41] Think about it. It has to be Christ
[1:44:44] through and by man raising the dead.
[1:44:47] Oh, hallelujah. Are you with me? Oh,
[1:44:50] glory to God. Hallelujah. So God want to
[1:44:53] come into bodies and use them for his
[1:44:55] glory. Amen. For his honor. Isn't that
[1:44:58] right? Amen. So the church come through
[1:45:01] justification sanification through
[1:45:03] Wesley through the baptism holy ghost.
[1:45:05] All the Pentecostals go right into the
[1:45:08] perfection of the son of man. When
[1:45:09] husband and wife will be the selfseen
[1:45:11] person. God will be so manifested into
[1:45:15] his bride, his church. They'll be one
[1:45:17] and the same. Amen. Do you see where we
[1:45:19] are at? Then we read this thing before.
[1:45:21] Build me up Lord into this. Let Christ
[1:45:23] be my head working through me on my
[1:45:24] foundation. My faith that's in him. Let
[1:45:26] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:45:28] godliness, brotherly kindness work in
[1:45:30] me, oh Lord is my prayer. I don't care
[1:45:32] live or die, sink or drown,
[1:45:34] denomination, friend or no friend. Let
[1:45:37] that work in me. This is for the
[1:45:40] ministry now. Let Christ virtue, his
[1:45:44] knowledge flow out that I might be able
[1:45:47] to teach those Amen. Whose virtue?
[1:45:51] Christ. Christ virtue. Whose knowledge?
[1:45:54] That we might be able to teach. So it's
[1:45:56] not our teaching. It has to be Christ
[1:45:58] knowledge. Christ virtue. Now we don't
[1:46:01] have virtue in ourselves. We could get
[1:46:03] faith which is at the bottom as
[1:46:05] revelation. Faith is revealed. But
[1:46:08] virtue is power. Jesus said he came unto
[1:46:11] his own. His own receive him not. But as
[1:46:13] many as receive him to them gave he
[1:46:17] power to become the sons of God. So you
[1:46:21] are promised a power which is a virtue
[1:46:24] to come upon your faith that you could
[1:46:27] now begin to add that life. Power have
[1:46:31] to come. We have none except he sent it.
[1:46:34] Except he promised it. Except he release
[1:46:37] it. Except he give it. And you have
[1:46:39] promised it. You shall receive power.
[1:46:44] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:46:53] Let Christ's virtue, his knowledge flow
[1:46:56] out that I'm able to teach those. For
[1:46:58] God has set in the church, apostles,
[1:47:00] prophets, teachers, pastors,
[1:47:01] evangelists, all here we go, there's a
[1:47:04] deeper part. all for the perfecting and
[1:47:09] bringing all these virtues into it for
[1:47:13] that perfection of the coming of the son
[1:47:14] of God. So what is he saying here? These
[1:47:17] virtues cannot come into you by
[1:47:19] revelation.
[1:47:21] The minister can bring it into you by
[1:47:23] revelation. He has to have the
[1:47:24] experience of the virtues. He have to
[1:47:27] have the experience of the life itself.
[1:47:30] It has to be alive.
[1:47:32] Speaking logos.
[1:47:34] [Applause]
[1:47:36] It has to be alive speaking fire.
[1:47:42] Why Peter yet spake these words? Holy
[1:47:45] Ghost fell upon them. What is happening?
[1:47:48] See germ from the body. Spirit life
[1:47:50] coming out of the mouth of another son
[1:47:54] because Adam was supposed to speak for
[1:47:55] other sons. And Jesus said you must be
[1:47:58] born again of the word and the spirit.
[1:48:01] So we are coming back to that.
[1:48:03] Oh, glory to God. Do you get it? We are
[1:48:07] coming back to that.
[1:48:12] When God give Adam the promise to
[1:48:14] multiply, replenish, multiply and so on,
[1:48:16] he was supposed to wait for a further
[1:48:18] revelation of how to do it of how.
[1:48:22] Amen. Then the devil came in. Then it
[1:48:25] come down into sex, but he was supposed
[1:48:27] to wait for further revelation. Yes. So
[1:48:30] God gives something you have to wait
[1:48:31] until it unfolds. Devil come and bring
[1:48:34] his interpretation and that how we born
[1:48:35] in sin born of a woman born see hell.
[1:48:39] So God had to bring Christ to bring a
[1:48:41] new birth. Amen. To bring word and
[1:48:43] spirit to bring it back to Adam again.
[1:48:46] So when God speak the word that's why
[1:48:47] Jesus breathe upon receive the Holy
[1:48:50] Ghost. It come back to the mouth again.
[1:48:52] It come to the mouth of God the word of
[1:48:54] God. So therefore you come now and you
[1:48:56] get the word inside your soul. The devil
[1:48:58] don't believe that it's a secret. God
[1:49:01] put a seed inside of you. Your spirit
[1:49:03] might be messed up. Your your flesh
[1:49:04] might be messed up. But God put a seed
[1:49:06] inside of you. And then the spirit come
[1:49:08] now to pour it upon that. And then it
[1:49:09] start to grow and break out. Then it
[1:49:11] start to influence your spirit. Start to
[1:49:13] influence your flesh. It start to
[1:49:14] influence your walk. Start to influence
[1:49:16] your talk. And the more you die out is
[1:49:18] the more this light expands. The more
[1:49:20] you God have the preeminences. And the
[1:49:22] more you give up this and give up that,
[1:49:24] the more you make room is the more that
[1:49:26] Holy Spirit expands inside of you. Then
[1:49:28] you become anointed with God. You are in
[1:49:31] the presence of God. You are living in
[1:49:33] his presence. You are walking in his
[1:49:34] presence. You have the joy of the Lord
[1:49:37] which is your strength. Nobody can throw
[1:49:39] you off, knock you off, run you off,
[1:49:41] crack you up, pull you down. You can't.
[1:49:45] You choose your actions. You make your
[1:49:46] decisions. You make the right ones
[1:49:49] regardless.
[1:49:51] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:49:58] You're happy to be a Christian and not a
[1:50:01] cushion. A cushion that stick all kind
[1:50:03] of thing in it. But you're a Christian.
[1:50:06] You stand for Christ. You stand for the
[1:50:08] word. You stand for the spirit.
[1:50:18] You thank God for your trials. You thank
[1:50:20] God for your testing. You change your
[1:50:22] picture. You change your attitude. When
[1:50:25] the trials come, you say, "Lord, how do
[1:50:27] I get out of this?"
[1:50:32] You be seated. Watch, watch, watch,
[1:50:34] watch this. I don't want to stay too
[1:50:35] long on this. But when God called the
[1:50:37] devil walking to and on the earth, he
[1:50:39] said, "Where you going?" See, up and
[1:50:41] down, up and down. I'm looking for more
[1:50:42] mischief to do. He said, "Come check out
[1:50:44] this man I have here. This man called
[1:50:45] Job." Job. The devil said, "The reason I
[1:50:48] touching him because he have a hedge
[1:50:49] around him." All God people have a
[1:50:51] hedge.
[1:50:53] Caught you. Caught you. Didn't know
[1:50:54] that, right?
[1:50:57] In case you didn't know, now you know.
[1:51:01] So whether you think you get yourself
[1:51:03] out of trouble, you get yourself out of
[1:51:04] the accident, you get is God put a heads
[1:51:06] around you? Devil got permission to
[1:51:08] touch you?
[1:51:10] He can only watch you and let God.
[1:51:14] [Applause]
[1:51:24] So sometime somebody bowl a ball to see
[1:51:25] if they can bat. Yeah. When the stumps
[1:51:28] going, you recognize they can't bat.
[1:51:29] Then go say go into training. That's
[1:51:31] right. Because that ball coming again.
[1:51:35] Because God know you're going to make
[1:51:36] it.
[1:51:37] God knew in advance his faith was in
[1:51:40] Job.
[1:51:43] His seed was in Job.
[1:51:46] The man born in sin, shape iniquity,
[1:51:48] have his ups and downs, have his
[1:51:50] failures. He have a hoy wife. He have
[1:51:52] all kind of issues around him. But that
[1:51:54] can't stop the seed in him. So God tell
[1:51:57] the devil, listen, take a crack. Take
[1:52:00] your best shot. Do your
[1:52:05] best. And when this devil finish with
[1:52:08] him, the man didn't boils. The man look
[1:52:10] like he have eggs. Nobody I want to go
[1:52:12] near him. The man scratching and all
[1:52:14] kind of thing. And the man sit down the
[1:52:17] skin will destroy my body. Get in my
[1:52:19] flesh. I shall see God for myself.
[1:52:22] Another in devil, you are a
[1:52:25] liar. You ain't going to get me to curse
[1:52:28] God.
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:44] Like the song said, "I never lost my
[1:52:46] praise. I lost friends. I lost family. I
[1:52:50] lost minister's friend. But I never lost
[1:52:53] my praise. Don't let Satan take your
[1:52:56] praise. Where was thou when I laid the
[1:52:58] foundation of the earth? And the morning
[1:53:00] star sang together and the sons of God
[1:53:03] shouted for joy.
[1:53:05] [Applause]
[1:53:27] Glory. Glory.
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:39] Wonderful.
[1:53:40] [Applause]
[1:53:42] Every son that cometh to God must be
[1:53:46] tested and tried.
[1:53:48] Amen. Not some sons. Like God favor that
[1:53:52] one by God doesn't do favors like how
[1:53:56] humans favor this son and that son and
[1:53:58] God not in that. Amen. He disciplined
[1:54:00] Noah, disciplined Moses. He disciplined
[1:54:04] his sons. All of them. Amen.
[1:54:08] And if these jokers in this mess, God
[1:54:10] will discipline them. They're wrong.
[1:54:11] That's right.
[1:54:15] Amen.
[1:54:19] God is pure and he is just. His
[1:54:23] righteousness demands judgment,
[1:54:26] but his blood speaks for grace.
[1:54:30] Amen. Amen. That's why he tell them he
[1:54:33] said he said Nebuchadnezzar my servant
[1:54:35] will come and do this that for 70 40 70
[1:54:38] years he'll be in Babylon and after 70
[1:54:40] years accomplished all you have enough
[1:54:42] long time while your mother die all your
[1:54:44] old heads die out and when you come to
[1:54:46] repentance or what I'll punish the king
[1:54:47] of Babylon after 70 years
[1:54:50] so God always take somebody to take you
[1:54:52] into captivity and you bind and what not
[1:54:54] and thing like that you you can't get a
[1:54:56] breakthrough because you're out of
[1:54:57] you're out of linemen you're out of
[1:55:00] position As soon as go people start to
[1:55:02] get back up position line up go angels
[1:55:04] have to line up with them authorities
[1:55:05] had to line up with them power
[1:55:07] everything start to line up for you as
[1:55:10] soon as you come up in line when your
[1:55:12] life you want you see you have to have
[1:55:13] an intent this is the problem a lot of
[1:55:15] people don't have the intent you have to
[1:55:17] have an intent to do right an intent to
[1:55:20] serve God intent to please him you start
[1:55:22] to please him yet or no you have to have
[1:55:24] an
[1:55:29] intent if If you're disrespectful, you
[1:55:31] have to have an intent to be respectful.
[1:55:33] So then you're you're pressing your way
[1:55:35] and you find this getting less and less.
[1:55:38] And if you're ready, go. We have to cast
[1:55:40] that spirit out cuz the spirit upon your
[1:55:43] life God want respects. Demand respects.
[1:55:46] You be judged for being disrespectful.
[1:55:47] Whether to husband, to the pastor, to
[1:55:49] deacon, elder, anybody like that, God
[1:55:51] demands your respects. He want respects.
[1:55:54] Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right? Praise
[1:55:58] the name of the Lord. So therefore the
[1:56:02] virtues praise God cannot come in just
[1:56:04] by talk talk talk like one time somebody
[1:56:07] said take a breath in wa in come
[1:56:11] fate virtue take seven deep
[1:56:14] breaths you get from faith virtue
[1:56:17] knowledge good lord you wish it was that
[1:56:21] easy
[1:56:22] hallelujah says somebody asked him how
[1:56:24] could you go to this church and that
[1:56:25] church and that church he said for
[1:56:27] kindness knowledge know what he Believe
[1:56:29] no it's in somebody listen if something
[1:56:31] in somebody's heart you guys in that out
[1:56:33] with a jackhammer
[1:56:35] so you spending always always rebuking
[1:56:37] rebuking it's in their heart if it's in
[1:56:40] their head a little small talk it fly
[1:56:42] off but when it's in their heart they
[1:56:44] trouble
[1:56:46] said one of the hardest people to conf
[1:56:48] witness because they legislate them with
[1:56:50] the knowledge and the intellect but you
[1:56:52] know where they shake them up
[1:56:53] supernatural
[1:56:55] that is just stump the knowledge yesmen
[1:56:59] So anytime you want to deal with them,
[1:57:00] you have some supernatural. If it's
[1:57:02] argument on scripture, they're going
[1:57:04] down with your Greek, Roman, they going
[1:57:05] down, they going down, they going, you
[1:57:07] lost that battle. But you see, when you
[1:57:10] see supernatural come,
[1:57:13] battle over,
[1:57:16] they get shut up. That is what God have
[1:57:18] to begin to do. Shut them out of the
[1:57:20] critics by bringing out sons, manifested
[1:57:25] sons. Are you with me? Amen. Praise God.
[1:57:29] The church is weak. The church today we
[1:57:31] are broke up in organization of strife,
[1:57:32] separation of brotherhood, Methodist,
[1:57:34] Baptist, Presbyterian, oneness,
[1:57:35] trainers, finness, all kind of stuff.
[1:57:37] Watch. That's the way it's supposed to
[1:57:39] be. Amen. Amen. Amen. You hear how he
[1:57:43] brought that? He said it broke up, broke
[1:57:45] up, broke up. He said, "But the way it's
[1:57:46] supposed to be." Break up. Break up.
[1:57:48] Break up. Break up. But watch what watch
[1:57:50] say next. That's where it's supposed to
[1:57:51] be. Then then there will come a message.
[1:57:54] Right. Hallelujah.
[1:57:58] Hallelujah. We know that that same
[1:58:01] pillar of fire that led Israel, we know
[1:58:05] that that same ministry that accompanied
[1:58:08] Jesus Christ by that pillar of fire had
[1:58:11] him anointed is accompanying the church
[1:58:13] today. We need the ministry of Jesus
[1:58:17] Christ to fit the headstone commander.
[1:58:20] Amen. that brought the church into a
[1:58:21] place where the ministry exactly like
[1:58:23] what Jesus had when he left. Not we want
[1:58:26] it, we need it, we need it. So it has to
[1:58:29] come to that ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:32] Number six have to run out. Amen. Oh
[1:58:34] praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We
[1:58:37] take a little more. He said now talking
[1:58:40] about the those those
[1:58:43] spiritfilled talking about those
[1:58:45] Pharisees people and Sadduce people.
[1:58:46] There's something inside with Jesus. But
[1:58:48] they were loyal and held to the modern
[1:58:51] creed of their leaders. Now it had Moses
[1:58:53] teaching about Messiah coming and all
[1:58:55] those prophecies about Messiah coming.
[1:58:57] But them was preaching the old pots and
[1:58:58] pans gospel and they had loyal
[1:59:00] following. Everybody love the pastor or
[1:59:02] the priest or the kyifas and little hat
[1:59:03] on the head and things like that, right?
[1:59:05] He looking good. He wearing good and so
[1:59:07] on like that. Kyifers is the man. Watch
[1:59:10] here this part. But his ministry, I love
[1:59:14] this part. Was showing up their
[1:59:15] doctrine. Amen. Hallelujah. They had
[1:59:17] their doctrine but Jesus ministry begin
[1:59:20] to expose their doctrine. That's what
[1:59:22] the ministry of Christ will do. It's a
[1:59:24] manifestation of Christ's own life. Now
[1:59:26] they had their creeds. They were great
[1:59:28] churches, great people, great men, holy
[1:59:30] men, good men, gentlemen, fine men, oral
[1:59:32] men, men of honor, educated, smart,
[1:59:34] religious. Is that right? And we all
[1:59:37] know that just as good as you can find
[1:59:39] anywhere. But when Jesus come on, his
[1:59:42] ministry showed up their doctrine
[1:59:44] because God was proven by the ministry
[1:59:48] of Jesus Christ that he was with him.
[1:59:51] And Peter used these words. He said,
[1:59:53] "Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of
[1:59:56] God among you." So what you want to see
[1:59:59] is man approved
[2:00:02] of God. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[2:00:05] house.
[2:00:10] Hallelujah.
[2:00:12] No doubts, no questions, no wonderings.
[2:00:16] It is vindicated by God himself. Jesus
[2:00:19] of Nazareth. A man approved of by God.
[2:00:23] He says, "All right to know the
[2:00:24] mechanics, but one of them has the
[2:00:26] dynamics." He said, "No." He said, "Have
[2:00:27] a Cadillac." Cadillac have tanks and
[2:00:29] crankshaft and steering wheel. It
[2:00:31] pretty, but it it it it cast
[2:00:34] that it not working. You have a D in the
[2:00:37] hubs. Look at the rims. Look at the
[2:00:39] seats. It's leather splash. Look at the
[2:00:41] dashboard. You say, "Let me go for a
[2:00:43] spin." But it can't start, you know. So
[2:00:46] what you have there? Best I borrow a
[2:00:48] bicycle.
[2:00:51] You understand what I'm saying? So if a
[2:00:53] man explain all the word and the
[2:00:55] mysteries and this mystery deep that
[2:00:58] that that yeah it looking nice, but
[2:01:00] could it start? Could it bring on a
[2:01:02] revival? Could it bring on a super
[2:01:04] church, a super race? Is is a spirit
[2:01:07] flowing freely? Could it start? Could
[2:01:10] that engine tumble?
[2:01:18] The last day engine tumblers.
[2:01:20] Hallelujah.
[2:01:25] Hallelujah. Men doing so nothing moving.
[2:01:29] Hallelujah. Because the battery too
[2:01:30] weak. That's right. It take it take is
[2:01:32] he say no other than life could work in
[2:01:34] this bride. You had to get the right
[2:01:35] battery to get this engine moving. When
[2:01:38] you turn the key, you want to hear a
[2:01:39] rumble. You don't want to know the plugs
[2:01:41] coming to the wire to the crankshaft and
[2:01:43] the this and the for the mechanics to do
[2:01:45] it. All I want to do is to drive. Oh,
[2:01:48] give the Lord some praises. All you want
[2:01:50] to do is to
[2:01:52] [Applause]
[2:01:57] drive. All of them had the right
[2:01:59] mechanics, but one of them has the
[2:02:01] dynamics. See, you might know the
[2:02:03] mechanics, but it takes dynamics to
[2:02:05] start off the mechanics to make it work.
[2:02:08] And no matter how much theology without
[2:02:10] dynamics, you see, in other words,
[2:02:12] you've got to have a spark to the
[2:02:13] gasoline. And no matter how well we are
[2:02:16] taught, how well we believe, how much of
[2:02:18] the Bible that we say is true, we
[2:02:20] believe it all. It's got to be the
[2:02:22] dynamics to get there, the spark to set
[2:02:25] the word on fire, to start it rolling.
[2:02:28] It's got to have that. If you don't, he
[2:02:31] say the church sit still. The car sit
[2:02:35] still. You sit still. No matter how much
[2:02:39] you say, "I sympathize. I believe every
[2:02:40] word of it." You've got to have
[2:02:41] something to spark it off. Hallelujah.
[2:02:44] It's got to take the dynamics with the
[2:02:46] mechanics. Nothing wrong with the
[2:02:47] mechanics, but lacking dynamics. And I
[2:02:49] think that's the matter with the church
[2:02:51] today is lacking the dynamic power of
[2:02:53] God to press the word to make it live.
[2:02:57] Not to explain it more. Not for you to
[2:02:59] run with more notes on a notepad that
[2:03:01] you can do nothing with
[2:03:04] but to make it live. Oh hallelujah.
[2:03:08] Martin Luther had mechanics and dynamics
[2:03:10] of his day. John Wesley had them.
[2:03:12] Pentecostal had them. What about our
[2:03:14] day? This is another time. The church
[2:03:17] shall be fully grown now, ready to meet
[2:03:19] Christ with the manifestation of every
[2:03:21] blessing that he promised in the Bible.
[2:03:24] Hallelujah. Operating in that one great
[2:03:26] body that he promised he would meet the
[2:03:28] people and be worshiped. So the more we
[2:03:31] get closer to God is the more worship
[2:03:32] supposed to be in the church. The more
[2:03:34] praises, not less praises, more praises,
[2:03:36] more worship. Hallelujah. The more we
[2:03:40] come to the coming of the Lord is the
[2:03:41] more worship. He said, "Then we are
[2:03:43] worshiping the living Christ, him moving
[2:03:45] in and out among us." That's the
[2:03:47] thunders being unfolded.
[2:03:49] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:03:53] Could I hear a shout again in the house?
[2:03:57] Christ ministry, which is Ephesians 4
[2:04:00] ministry, will bring to brighter
[2:04:02] perfection. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. By
[2:04:05] that seven spirits of God to come upon
[2:04:08] the word, the pyramid already seated in
[2:04:10] you in word form. Yes. You already
[2:04:12] packing the prayer. What do you think
[2:04:13] inside of you? Is a pyramid inside of
[2:04:15] you. There's a Bible inside of you. It's
[2:04:17] a seed inside of you. It's a word inside
[2:04:19] of you. You only waiting for dynamics.
[2:04:21] Satan better be careful. He don't know
[2:04:23] what he messing with. He don't know what
[2:04:25] he fooling with. Oh, how when God pulled
[2:04:27] the veil off this bride, he said she
[2:04:29] will be a super church. She will be a
[2:04:31] super race as she nears the headstone.
[2:04:34] No other life could work in her. Nobody
[2:04:36] could make her do otherwise. It will be
[2:04:39] Christ himself by and through the bride
[2:04:42] fulfilling his work because he didn't
[2:04:44] finish his work while he was on earth.
[2:04:46] Now by and through the bride. Oh
[2:04:49] hallelujah. Praise God. Glory. Glory.
[2:04:54] Hallelujah.
[2:04:55] Oh hallelujah. Brother talk about latter
[2:04:58] rain. Breine. He said if the latter rain
[2:05:01] had been here the power of God would
[2:05:03] have struck that thing and swept across
[2:05:05] the world. He said the latter rain is
[2:05:06] fixing to come. Amen. So who claim to
[2:05:08] have dynamics? Who are dynamics? Who
[2:05:10] could position the place? They have only
[2:05:11] have mouth only talk. The latter is
[2:05:13] fixing to come. Says the devil is coming
[2:05:16] down in his dynamics through the United
[2:05:19] Nation to enforce laws.
[2:05:22] Right now they take this whole thing
[2:05:24] about uh gays and whatn not to the
[2:05:25] United Nations and they want to enforce
[2:05:27] laws concerning transgender rights to
[2:05:30] the rest of the world. That's right.
[2:05:33] The devil set up that a long time ago
[2:05:35] only to come to enforce laws. So it will
[2:05:38] be legal. It will be illegal not to
[2:05:40] marry people like that. Man or woman a
[2:05:43] woman. So the Christians find themselves
[2:05:45] back against a wall in America and it
[2:05:47] will be across the world. Who said all
[2:05:49] of that and prophesied that? But a
[2:05:50] Brandon prophesied that. He said the
[2:05:52] people that puff follow the pillar of
[2:05:53] fire will have a rough time but they'll
[2:05:55] be ready for the rapture. So if you
[2:05:57] think we are playing games with any
[2:05:59] human,
[2:06:01] we are not because a bigger battle is
[2:06:04] yet ahead. Oh hallelujah.
[2:06:10] Those people in England, they voted come
[2:06:11] out of Euro and next next morning they
[2:06:13] want to vote to go back in Mosby. They
[2:06:15] want a revote. People repenting. They
[2:06:17] they know what they do. They know it's
[2:06:19] not what they do.
[2:06:22] Lost $3
[2:06:23] trillion. One shot. One shot. just pong
[2:06:27] gone 30 yellow. You think they're
[2:06:29] expecting that? Now watch something.
[2:06:32] It's a worldwide environment.
[2:06:37] If somebody catch a cold and rest sneeze
[2:06:43] so you can say I by myself I I alone. I
[2:06:46] say private pope in this message.
[2:06:48] Private church is the figure of have a
[2:06:49] private church and private bride. Yes.
[2:06:51] Yes. Yes. Private church. Yes. Why ain't
[2:06:54] going to be that private nonsense?
[2:06:56] Because only have one body and by one
[2:06:58] spirit God put you in that body. God
[2:07:00] could put you in a body and send it to
[2:07:02] New Zealand and that you still in the
[2:07:04] body. God can send it to China. No other
[2:07:06] church in China and you still in the
[2:07:07] body. Nobody can pull you out the body.
[2:07:10] You're a son of God. Some of you don't
[2:07:12] not acting like that, talking like that
[2:07:14] to talk that talk.
[2:07:18] Yeah, I know the pressure going through.
[2:07:19] No, I don't know.
[2:07:22] Do you want to choose your pressure?
[2:07:25] Remember, you know article was right.
[2:07:27] Somebody went back in heaven and said,
[2:07:28] "Lord, the cross too too big for me
[2:07:29] today." God said, "Okay, pick pick one."
[2:07:32] They make they want you the whole room
[2:07:33] say the big crosses and come back and
[2:07:34] see a smaller one. Pick it up. You said,
[2:07:36] "But that the one you just
[2:07:41] bring. The same one you just bring. You
[2:07:44] wore smaller cross the smallest cross in
[2:07:45] the whole room and you complaining.
[2:07:55] Who are wife complaining about wife? Who
[2:07:57] husband complain about husband? Who that
[2:07:58] children complain about children? And oh
[2:07:59] my goodness, anyone ever complain. God,
[2:08:02] you got to write the test paper. God
[2:08:04] know what you have need of. So God just
[2:08:06] had to drop it on you. Drop it on you.
[2:08:08] And I am not sorry for you. Forgive me.
[2:08:10] Not that I'm a hard pastor, but that's
[2:08:12] the way you go comfort. You're not made
[2:08:15] character by gifts. You make character
[2:08:18] by trials and by testings and by
[2:08:20] tribulations and by pressure. That's
[2:08:22] what change and transform your
[2:08:26] life. When you get fed up of being fed
[2:08:29] up and you really get fed up and you say
[2:08:31] I can't take it no
[2:08:33] more, liberty will perish.
[2:08:37] Then you then you're serious with God.
[2:08:42] But I'm talking about a time it had a a
[2:08:44] fan in the west. No. No rain. No rain.
[2:08:48] And they're begging for water. And a man
[2:08:49] couldn't take it enough. No. No more. A
[2:08:51] old man went in the middle of the
[2:08:53] street. That's right. Raise up behind.
[2:08:54] He said God I serve you all these years.
[2:08:56] Send rain. Somebody say run. Yes. Run.
[2:08:57] Run. Run. Rain coming. You know rain
[2:08:59] come.
[2:09:01] Yeah. Yeah. Man come to the end of that.
[2:09:03] That's when they real fed up. You can't
[2:09:04] take it no more. You talk to this one.
[2:09:06] You talk to this one. You're not leaving
[2:09:07] your burden down by the riverside.
[2:09:09] You're leaving your burden on people.
[2:09:11] You're loading on this one. You're
[2:09:12] loading on that one. You're loading.
[2:09:13] God, they're hearing from you. The
[2:09:15] amount of hours you spend talking your
[2:09:16] business to other people. If you talk
[2:09:18] that to God, your problem fix up
[2:09:20] already. But you're uploading this one,
[2:09:22] you're uploading this one, you're
[2:09:23] uploading this one, you're uploading
[2:09:24] this
[2:09:29] one. And some people, they're like
[2:09:31] garbage collectors. You back up the
[2:09:32] garbage truck, all your trash and reason
[2:09:35] be pressing, but the whole thing just go
[2:09:36] and you collecting it. You only hearing.
[2:09:38] You only hearing.
[2:09:41] [Applause]
[2:09:46] Then afterwards, you come trashy as what
[2:09:47] you're hearing.
[2:09:50] When they come with the garbage truck
[2:09:52] and keep on moving, keep on moving. Not
[2:09:53] this street. Not this street. You have
[2:09:55] no time for that. I'll pray for you.
[2:09:56] Keep on keep on dumb that somewhere. Go
[2:09:57] to the dump of that. Go to the dump of
[2:10:00] that. Oh hallelujah. Praise God. Time
[2:10:04] some brother come inside church visiting
[2:10:05] and so he come to me see me in the
[2:10:06] office and he come to tell me all kind
[2:10:07] of I say hold it there. Try to open
[2:10:10] garbage bag and tell me all this and all
[2:10:11] that. I say, "Hold it right there. Close
[2:10:12] it back."
[2:10:16] He didn't make his home church. He's not
[2:10:17] a I'm not his pastor. You want to open
[2:10:19] his garbage bag for me to offload? Said
[2:10:21] no. Close that back gently and go.
[2:10:27] If he say I'm his pastor, that's
[2:10:28] different. You understand? I'm saying
[2:10:30] I'll show him where the dump truck jump
[2:10:32] dumb place is.
[2:10:34] But you can't come here and try to
[2:10:35] offload on me. You know, I go through
[2:10:37] and I go into this. Is that right? I
[2:10:39] have responsibility. Am I responsible
[2:10:41] not to be a dump? Cuz some people like
[2:10:44] to offload. Just offload. They don't
[2:10:46] want a solutions, you know. They want
[2:10:47] somebody to hear them.
[2:10:49] When they give them the solution, you
[2:10:52] ask, you know,
[2:10:56] you're bringing solution. They don't
[2:10:58] want that. They want somebody to hear.
[2:11:00] Yeah.
[2:11:03] Now when you see if we have every ear
[2:11:04] shut off from that put in your ears that
[2:11:08] person get bind you know when they cast
[2:11:10] up here they cast up here they cast up
[2:11:11] here nobody hearing them they had to
[2:11:12] walk straight out kind of somewhere
[2:11:14] else. Oh my I remember service we had
[2:11:17] there in Ivory Coast but the country
[2:11:19] said let's make here a millennium.
[2:11:20] Millennium the devil is b circumstance
[2:11:23] man the place just roar the faith just
[2:11:25] ra higher if you see the power of God
[2:11:27] begin to move. No unbelief. Just let
[2:11:29] here be a millennium. Now the devil
[2:11:32] can't use nobody inside of here. And
[2:11:34] that's how you should want it. Devil
[2:11:36] can't use you. You become a channel of
[2:11:38] God. You're thinking right. You're
[2:11:40] talking right. You're acting right.
[2:11:42] You're doing right. You're not coming
[2:11:43] here to look to see what we having this
[2:11:45] morning. No. Stay home. Don't come here
[2:11:47] for that. Don't come and look. Come with
[2:11:49] expectation. Don't come and look to see
[2:11:51] what kind of service we going to have.
[2:11:52] No, we we we don't even know what kind
[2:11:53] of service we going to have because
[2:11:55] every day is a different day. Every day
[2:12:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:03] Hallelujah. You think I know all we're
[2:12:05] going to preach? No.
[2:12:07] Hallelujah. By all I know, God going to
[2:12:08] be here. Amen. To minister to people.
[2:12:11] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:12:14] Oh my my my my. So therefore, God have
[2:12:17] to release the ministry of the spirit to
[2:12:19] bring the people into that perfection.
[2:12:21] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:12:23] Brother, a woman engaged to a fine clean
[2:12:26] man and they come together and she's
[2:12:28] found pregnant by someone else. Then her
[2:12:30] own seed is be which is betroth. Her own
[2:12:32] body is betrod. Her engaged husband is
[2:12:35] found full of seed of another man. What
[2:12:36] a disgrace. That's what Adam found. That
[2:12:39] is what Christ found. They couldn't
[2:12:41] wait. That's the matter with the people
[2:12:44] today. Here we go. They can't wait for
[2:12:48] the real Holy Spirit to take the church
[2:12:52] in position. Amen.
[2:12:55] Amen. They have got to manufacture
[2:12:57] something like speaking in tongues to
[2:12:59] get more members in the church. All kind
[2:13:00] of tummy rot instead of waiting upon the
[2:13:04] Lord for the real manifestation of
[2:13:06] resurrection of Christ making himself
[2:13:09] known among the people. They have to
[2:13:12] have no manufacture of that. But Ram
[2:13:14] stand up there and say, you know what
[2:13:15] I'm waiting on? I'm waiting on the angel
[2:13:17] of the Lord. And he will be talking
[2:13:19] talking all of a sudden he say he is
[2:13:21] here. That is no makeup stuff. It is
[2:13:25] real. Then because he is here, he I take
[2:13:28] every spirit under my control for the
[2:13:31] glory of God because he know he have
[2:13:33] backups.
[2:13:35] [Applause]
[2:13:39] He know now the operation change. The
[2:13:42] devil in subjection. No spirit move till
[2:13:44] he says so. Amen.
[2:13:48] Because the angel's on the platform
[2:13:49] right now and he is doing this now. He's
[2:13:51] doing this. He's going here. You so and
[2:13:53] so, you sick with so and so. And notice
[2:13:54] sometime he said somebody with diabetes,
[2:13:56] he said everybody with diabetes stand
[2:13:58] up. Amen. Somebody with high blood
[2:14:00] pressure. Everybody stand up with the
[2:14:02] same condition. Everybody stand up and
[2:14:04] deal with it. Then one time he's dealing
[2:14:06] with some spirit and I say he's a spirit
[2:14:08] trying to an expert to ask for help cuz
[2:14:11] they don't want to leave. So the spirits
[2:14:13] are them looking for backup too. That's
[2:14:15] why when you come here worship and
[2:14:17] praise, the devil have no room to move.
[2:14:21] You understand those devils want you
[2:14:23] bound. They want you sick. Don't ever
[2:14:26] believe sickness is of God and God that
[2:14:28] God gave you this because you did this
[2:14:30] and you was wrong and you deserve this.
[2:14:32] Don't don't don't let fool you with
[2:14:34] that. You know,
[2:14:36] healing is the children's bread. You
[2:14:38] know,
[2:14:45] I don't care if you're sick for 40
[2:14:46] years. Amen. Are you looking
[2:14:49] hereditary disease that have nothing to
[2:14:51] do with God? God has healed cancer,
[2:14:54] tumor, leukemia, all kind of thing. God
[2:14:56] is a healer. He is a healer. God is a
[2:15:00] healer. Like he save you. He's a savior.
[2:15:02] He's a healer, too. In case you didn't
[2:15:04] know, now you know.
[2:15:07] People so backed now. They don't even
[2:15:09] believe God for healing. Don't even
[2:15:10] believe God for miracles. God is a
[2:15:12] miracle worker, too.
[2:15:17] My God,
[2:15:19] he's a miracle working God. How many can
[2:15:22] say amen?
[2:15:27] How many could do with a miracle this
[2:15:29] morning?
[2:15:31] Oh, we have believers here this morning.
[2:15:33] I could do with one.
[2:15:40] Lord,
[2:15:43] Hallelujah.
[2:15:45] Amen. So we become tabernacles of the
[2:15:47] Holy Spirit which is Christ. That's the
[2:15:50] real seed. Now then if the real Holy
[2:15:54] Spirit gets into the real seed of the
[2:15:56] word, it just won't take part of it
[2:15:58] because the devil uses that. All right?
[2:16:00] So the devil use part word. The devil is
[2:16:02] in this message preaching part of the
[2:16:04] message. But the bride will take all of
[2:16:06] the word, not part of the word. Every
[2:16:09] mystery, every word, the bride will take
[2:16:12] what the prophet said. Not what would
[2:16:14] somebody interpret what the prophet
[2:16:16] said. The bride, the prophet will be
[2:16:18] speaking the same thing. Hallelujah. The
[2:16:20] bride, the spirit, and the prophet will
[2:16:22] be saying the same thing. Oh,
[2:16:25] hallelujah.
[2:16:27] Okay. Wow. Hallelujah. This is the part
[2:16:30] I want to get on into. Amen.
[2:16:34] Question and answer on the Holy
[2:16:36] Ghost. The Holy Spirit. You are
[2:16:38] believing unto eternal life. But when
[2:16:42] the Holy Spirit comes, it is eternal
[2:16:45] life. Amen. This is you are begotten of
[2:16:49] the spirit at sanctification. Amen. But
[2:16:52] never born of the spirit until the Holy
[2:16:55] Ghost comes in. Amen. That's correct.
[2:16:59] Now, he went into natural type to
[2:17:00] explain what he's saying here. A baby,
[2:17:04] watch, but never born was born, right? A
[2:17:07] baby got life in the womb of the mother.
[2:17:10] But when it breathes, it's its little
[2:17:12] muscles are quivering. It's a life. But
[2:17:15] it's a different life when it breathes
[2:17:17] the breath of life into its nostrils. So
[2:17:21] when the baby is in the mother's womb,
[2:17:23] it's a life. The baby is kicking, it's
[2:17:25] quivering, it's moving and so on. It's
[2:17:27] not the same life as when it comes on
[2:17:29] the outside. When it comes on the
[2:17:30] outside, it's born. Amen.
[2:17:34] Amen. When it's on the inside, it's
[2:17:36] begotten. Amen.
[2:17:40] When it come outside, it is born.
[2:17:43] When it's on the inside, it's begotten.
[2:17:46] It's adding foot and legs and eyes and
[2:17:48] so on. Word on top of word on top of
[2:17:50] word, that's begotten. All right, let's
[2:17:53] go further. My dear Methodist brother,
[2:17:56] pregnant holiness and Nazarene and the
[2:17:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost is different
[2:18:01] from sanctification. Sanification is a
[2:18:04] cleansing which is preparation of life.
[2:18:07] But when the Holy Ghost comes, it is
[2:18:10] life. Preparation is cleansing the
[2:18:13] vessel. Cleaning the vessel, the Holy
[2:18:15] Ghost is filling the vessel.
[2:18:16] Sanification means clean and set aside
[2:18:19] and the Holy Spirit puts it in service.
[2:18:22] Amen. So you are the vessel that God has
[2:18:24] cleaned up.
[2:18:26] Now we find out that the Holy Ghost is
[2:18:29] God himself in you. God above you pillar
[2:18:32] of fire with Moses, God with you in
[2:18:34] Jesus Christ. Now God is in you in the
[2:18:35] Holy Ghost. Not three gods but God
[2:18:37] working in three officers. God
[2:18:39] condescended. When God came down and
[2:18:41] dwelt in that sanctified body, a virgin
[2:18:44] born of a woman, that was God himself.
[2:18:46] You know what God did? He did nothing.
[2:18:48] He just placed his tent among ours. God
[2:18:50] dwelt in a tent called Jesus Christ and
[2:18:53] he pitch his tent with us and that is
[2:18:56] how God tent was dwell with us. You see
[2:18:59] when you use the expression that if we
[2:19:02] do not believe the word that question
[2:19:04] answers when you use the expression that
[2:19:06] if we do not believe the word we will be
[2:19:09] eternally severed from Christ. Do you
[2:19:11] mean the foolish virgin will live
[2:19:12] eternally but they will be separate from
[2:19:14] the new Jerusalem where Christ will
[2:19:16] dwell with the bride. Here are those who
[2:19:19] do not have the Holy Spirit. Born again
[2:19:21] as the scripture speaks of being born
[2:19:22] again. If the natural birth, here we go,
[2:19:25] requires water, blood, and spirit. Does
[2:19:27] not the spiritual birth requires all
[2:19:29] these three stages of grace before the
[2:19:32] person is truly born again. He said,
[2:19:34] "Absolutely. I just explained that this
[2:19:36] morning. You have got to have all
[2:19:39] stages." He's going back over again. You
[2:19:42] are begotten of the spirit like a baby.
[2:19:45] Begotten in the womb of the mother, but
[2:19:48] not born until the receive the Holy
[2:19:50] Ghost. That's right. You are born then.
[2:19:54] You are not converted. You are in the
[2:19:56] process of being converted until that
[2:19:58] time. Now this is the part that's the
[2:20:01] reason that all these great mysteries
[2:20:05] could not be given to Luther could not
[2:20:08] be given to Wesley could not be given to
[2:20:11] the age just passed by the Pentecostal
[2:20:13] age why it wasn't time they were
[2:20:16] begotten
[2:20:18] amen
[2:20:21] so what he is saying the Pentecostal
[2:20:24] birth God pushed that as begotten when
[2:20:28] Malachi before come
[2:20:30] because he brought the person of Jesus
[2:20:32] Christ. When that which is perfect is
[2:20:34] come, then that which is part is done
[2:20:38] away with. So watch, you cannot teach no
[2:20:41] baby in the womb. So the Pentecostal in
[2:20:44] the womb begotten couldn't get
[2:20:46] mysteries. So the prophet brought the
[2:20:48] birth of the word. Oh hallelujah.
[2:20:52] Hallelujah. The prophet brought the word
[2:20:55] so you could come forth now and get the
[2:20:56] mysteries preached to you. Amen.
[2:20:59] [Applause]
[2:21:03] So you are begotten of the blood cell of
[2:21:05] the word of God. Isn't that right?
[2:21:07] Hallelujah. Then you are sanctified.
[2:21:10] That's a different life. Isn't that
[2:21:12] right? Praise God. So the blood is what
[2:21:16] comes by the word to reveal your name.
[2:21:18] So that's why the seventh is blood to
[2:21:20] sanctify you. You are not sanctified.
[2:21:22] You are not in the message until you're
[2:21:24] really sanctified.
[2:21:26] You can't even come to perfection if
[2:21:28] you're not sanctified because the
[2:21:30] perfecting of the saints is the
[2:21:31] sanctified ones. So it means that you
[2:21:33] have to come to that spot to truly live
[2:21:35] a sanctified life unto God, a separated
[2:21:38] life unto God. And your sanctification
[2:21:41] is proof you receive and believe the
[2:21:43] blood.
[2:21:47] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:21:49] I wanted to get to this part so bad. Oh,
[2:21:52] hallelujah. So your sanification is
[2:21:55] proof that you received the blood
[2:21:58] message.
[2:22:00] Amen.
[2:22:03] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said a new
[2:22:07] heart I will give you. A new spirit I
[2:22:09] will give you. Then I'll put my spirit
[2:22:10] in your spirit. Therefore the blood
[2:22:12] supposed to give you a change. Amen.
[2:22:14] Towards others towards people. A change
[2:22:17] in your life. And you're still looking
[2:22:19] for the his spirit to come in your new
[2:22:21] spirit because your old spirit is so
[2:22:23] terrible. Hallelujah. You're so
[2:22:24] troublesome. You're so misbehaving and
[2:22:26] bad attitude. That's not
[2:22:29] Christian. Whether you say amen or not,
[2:22:31] I'm still preaching it. Whether you like
[2:22:32] it or not, I still putting it out. I am
[2:22:34] free. Free. Free. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:22:38] Hallelujah. Oh, give the Lord. But there
[2:22:40] are some saints in the house. I hearing
[2:22:42] you. Amen. I hear you shout. I hearing
[2:22:44] you saying hallelujah.
[2:22:46] Oh, there's going to be a perfecting of
[2:22:48] the saints.
[2:22:52] So that seven thunder baby is in you
[2:22:54] right now. Oh, hallelujah. But charity
[2:22:57] is the life on the outside to snatch
[2:23:00] that seven thunder baby that going to
[2:23:02] anoint you with charity. The spirit is
[2:23:04] here to anoint that baby inside of you.
[2:23:08] You're going to be anointed of God.
[2:23:09] Hallelujah.
[2:23:11] Oh, glory to God. Oh my God. My God. Let
[2:23:15] me see if I can wrap up here.
[2:23:17] Hallelujah. Though the whole creation is
[2:23:19] waiting and groaning for the sons of God
[2:23:21] in the rise and last days with the power
[2:23:23] of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age.
[2:23:26] Not rise with books and tapes, but with
[2:23:28] the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:31] Amen. To reveal the secret things to
[2:23:34] bring it up. But the Brandham said now
[2:23:36] the coming of the Lord Jesus were close
[2:23:38] at hand until the spirit from way down
[2:23:40] here sanctification
[2:23:45] baptally like Christ. Until Christ and
[2:23:48] the church unite together and if you
[2:23:50] live the life of Christ and will act the
[2:23:51] life of Christ, do the work of Christ.
[2:23:53] What does that ministry identify? The
[2:23:55] coming of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Oh,
[2:23:57] hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Remember,
[2:24:00] it cannot be taught in any seminary.
[2:24:02] It's a mystery. You cannot know it by
[2:24:03] education, by theology. It's a mystery
[2:24:06] that's been hidden since the foundation
[2:24:07] of the world, waiting for the
[2:24:09] manifestation of the sons of God.
[2:24:13] Are you want to hear it? It's waiting
[2:24:15] till the time now all these things be
[2:24:18] brought coming shaping up the headstone
[2:24:20] to the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:24:22] coming back and the spirit of God coming
[2:24:25] into these men so perfectly. so
[2:24:28] perfectly until their ministry will be
[2:24:31] so close like Christ till it will join
[2:24:34] him and his church together. Amen. Oh,
[2:24:36] praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:24:40] What man fell from? His inheritance.
[2:24:42] What's his inheritance? He said sunship
[2:24:45] to be a son of God. That's inheritance.
[2:24:48] That's inheritance. Not land and house
[2:24:50] and car. That not inheritance. Your
[2:24:52] inheritance is sunship to be a son of
[2:24:53] God. Not church member. Church members
[2:24:56] what we have now to join the church they
[2:24:58] in church we not talking about that
[2:25:00] inheriting a sunship Satan come out of
[2:25:04] him go have I s I give it unto you that

[2:25:19] have to pray just lay hands on the sick
[2:25:23] and they shall recover
[2:25:25] That's sunship. You are anointed with
[2:25:28] God. Your hands are anointed. Your feet
[2:25:30] anointed. Paul was so anointed they took
[2:25:33] cloth over his body and people were
[2:25:34] healed.
[2:25:40] Sunship. Imagine brother Brandon and
[2:25:42] wife on the operating theater. He have a
[2:25:44] tumor big like a grapeoot and he is
[2:25:45] speaking before the doctor touches my
[2:25:47] wife the tumor will go down. He's
[2:25:50] overseas. He's not in the hospital room.
[2:25:52] He born outside nervous. Oh gosh.
[2:25:54] operation. He not biting his nails.
[2:25:58] Amen. He is going through song barrier.
[2:26:01] He's going through time space.
[2:26:03] Distance means nothing. Amen. To the
[2:26:06] spoken word.
[2:26:09] The man told Jesus, "I have a servant
[2:26:11] sick. Just speak the word and my servant
[2:26:13] shall be healed. I I'm not worthy for
[2:26:14] you to come into my house." Just speak
[2:26:16] the word. Word. Word. No. No distance.
[2:26:20] Your sister could be sick. You could
[2:26:21] have a condition. some family member
[2:26:23] somewhere in the hospital, somewhere in
[2:26:24] America, somewhere wherever. And that
[2:26:26] that that no distance that
[2:26:34] word. Oh, I want you to get excited
[2:26:36] about that word. Excited about your
[2:26:39] inheritance. Excited about your sunship.
[2:26:42] Aren't you tired of how you are? Your
[2:26:45] sunship is your inheritance.
[2:26:48] Come on, let's take it back. Take it
[2:26:50] back.
[2:26:52] Take it back. You don't hear what I'm
[2:26:53] saying? Take back your sun chair. Take
[2:26:55] it back. Get it back.
[2:27:00] [Applause]
[2:27:06] But I'm talking about bar talk about
[2:27:08] enforcing the word. He said the Holy
[2:27:09] Spirit come down as the enforcer. You
[2:27:11] take my boy, you take my girl, Satan,
[2:27:12] give it back. You ain't come to that
[2:27:15] spot yet to say deal with that. Satan,
[2:27:16] give it back. Give it back. Give it
[2:27:18] back. After all, he have to give it back
[2:27:20] because he recognize authority is
[2:27:21] coming. Authority is coming and power
[2:27:23] coming through. Before you get into
[2:27:25] power, you have to come into authority.
[2:27:27] I'll say it again. Before you come into
[2:27:29] a power, you have to come into
[2:27:30] authority. You have to take authority of
[2:27:32] the name of Jesus. You have to take the
[2:27:34] authority of your sunship. You don't
[2:27:35] have power yet. Power
[2:27:38] come. But your authority to pray in
[2:27:40] Jesus name. But when power come, you got
[2:27:43] to use Jesus name.
[2:27:48] power coming. But we have authority
[2:27:51] right now. In my name, you shall cast
[2:27:52] out devils. In my name, heal the sick.
[2:27:55] In my name, raise the dead. We have We
[2:27:57] have authority right now in the name of
[2:27:58] Jesus.
[2:28:00] [Applause]
[2:28:03] Every service, we're getting stronger.
[2:28:07] Not weaker, stronger.
[2:28:12] All them waiting on us. All them in the
[2:28:14] grave waiting on us. And I if you hear
[2:28:16] them talking tonight over the banner
[2:28:17] sometime they say come on you can make
[2:28:18] it. They can't do anything. They going
[2:28:20] on already. They can't pull the up from
[2:28:22] there. We got to pull them. They without
[2:28:25] us are not made perfect. We got to raise
[2:28:27] them up. We got to get to the ministry
[2:28:29] of Jesus Christ. We got to get to the
[2:28:31] voice of the archangel. Nobody could
[2:28:34] turn on that voice. That voice is what
[2:28:36] called Lazarus from the grave. That
[2:28:37] voice said Lazarus come forth. Lazarus
[2:28:40] had to come. Lazarus had no choice.
[2:28:46] Do you understand what power coming?
[2:28:49] That's a no choice thing. You know,
[2:28:52] Lazarus say, "I feel like going home."
[2:28:56] No, sir. Jesus say, "Lazarus, come
[2:28:57] forth." Lazarus had a packup shop and
[2:29:00] turn around. Traveling all them three
[2:29:02] days. Lazar had to come right back and
[2:29:04] come right back into his body. Still
[2:29:06] tied up on the grave clothes on the
[2:29:08] anointing of grave clothes upon him. And
[2:29:10] Jesus had to loose him. Loose him. Loose
[2:29:11] him. Loose him. He come back. He
[2:29:14] resurrect. He restored. But he tied up.
[2:29:17] He come back. He resurrect. He restored.
[2:29:20] But he tied up. Jesus come back. He
[2:29:23] resurrect. But he's tied up. Loose him
[2:29:25] and let him go. Loose him. Loose him.
[2:29:27] Loose him. Oh, get loose inside of here.
[2:29:29] Loose. Don't just stay tied up. Oh, God.
[2:29:32] God resurrect you. God quicken you. God
[2:29:34] restore you. God bring you right back.
[2:29:36] Loose them. Loose them. Loose them. Oh,
[2:29:41] give the Lord a
[2:29:42] [Applause]
[2:29:47] shout. Oh,
[2:29:49] glory. I'm almost done. Sorry for giving
[2:29:51] you so long. But he lost his godship,
[2:29:54] Adam. He lost his dominion. He lost his
[2:29:56] sunship. He lost his domain. Satan took
[2:29:58] it over. But brother, we are waiting for
[2:30:01] the manifestation of the sons of God who
[2:30:03] will come back and take it over again.
[2:30:06] Waiting on the fullness of time. When
[2:30:08] the pyramid gets to the top, when the
[2:30:10] full son of God will be manifested with
[2:30:13] the power of God and will take every
[2:30:15] power that Satan got away from him.
[2:30:18] Amen. Then the devil will be like
[2:30:19] powerless like a bluffer with a bow and
[2:30:22] no arrow. Hallelujah. Trying to tell you
[2:30:24] you're in the jail cell and he cannot
[2:30:26] stop the door. It's already busted open.
[2:30:29] Because when Jesus died, he went and got
[2:30:31] the keys from him. He doesn't have the
[2:30:33] keys of death and hell. He doesn't
[2:30:35] control the keys of death and hell
[2:30:37] because Jesus took the keys away from
[2:30:39] hell. He's a bluffer today. Oh, grace
[2:30:42] hold this body down. That can't keep me
[2:30:44] down. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Oh,
[2:30:49] hallelujah. Jesus, I've got the
[2:30:54] keys. Glory. What is God waiting for?
[2:30:58] Here we go. waiting and trying to get to
[2:31:00] place his church in position to manifest
[2:31:04] himself getting one he can work through
[2:31:07] like this and said and say what there is
[2:31:10] my spirit flowing freely why the
[2:31:13] ministers don't preach that amen
[2:31:16] everybody want to talk about the
[2:31:17] doctrine and the teachings and the
[2:31:18] revelation and the level of word
[2:31:22] how high the level of word is
[2:31:25] that is not there is my spirit flowing
[2:31:28] freely That is there is your level of
[2:31:30] word talking freely.
[2:31:33] But that's not what God waiting to hear.
[2:31:35] God want to say there is my spirit.
[2:31:37] After 40 years, we must hear a word
[2:31:40] word. When we going to have the
[2:31:41] 15-minute service and the Pentecost,
[2:31:43] Peter preached for 15 minutes and 3,000
[2:31:46] people repented.
[2:31:48] How much mysteries you could preach in
[2:31:50] 15 minutes?
[2:31:52] And everybody's hearing in their own
[2:31:53] tongue. That's right. That the mystery.
[2:31:57] That is mystery. How here are we all in
[2:32:00] our own tongue? Everybody had different
[2:32:03] tongues and languages. They were all
[2:32:04] hearing that is
[2:32:06] supernatural. There's no normal 15inut
[2:32:08] silment thing. That is that is the
[2:32:10] mystery. How you could hear ah the voice
[2:32:13] of God in your spirit in your heart in
[2:32:16] your
[2:32:17] life. Get in one. You can say there's my
[2:32:19] spirit fully free. There it is. I can
[2:32:21] work here. Get another one over here and
[2:32:24] place him. I can place him. adoption,
[2:32:27] placing, manifesting. Give him a
[2:32:29] ceremony, visit him with an angel, tell
[2:32:32] him something. Praise God. If he told
[2:32:34] the truth, if he making up something, it
[2:32:36] won't work. It won't work. We had, you
[2:32:38] said, we had plenty of that. I real
[2:32:40] manifestation of the sons of God. When
[2:32:42] God manifests himself, he sends him out.
[2:32:44] And then what he goes forth, what he
[2:32:46] says is the truth. What he does is the
[2:32:48] truth. And what he does, he manifest
[2:32:49] Christ. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. And how
[2:32:53] do you judge him? By the way, by the
[2:32:56] way, he stays with the word. How will
[2:32:59] they judge you now? By if? Yeah.
[2:33:01] Fellowship with that one. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:33:03] That one. Oh, you don't go to that
[2:33:05] convention. Oh. Oh. They judge it by
[2:33:08] everything else but by what the prophet
[2:33:10] says. How do you judge a man? How you
[2:33:12] supposed to judge me? By how I stay with
[2:33:16] the word. That's right. So, if I stay
[2:33:19] with the word today, I am with the word.
[2:33:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't
[2:33:24] have to be with nobody else as long be
[2:33:26] with the word and I'm with everybody
[2:33:28] else who is with the word. Amen. Amen.
[2:33:30] Amen. All right. Whoa. Now when these
[2:33:35] offices and
[2:33:36] places but Abraham say oh hallelujah.
[2:33:39] Okay. Oh, we almost done. I got to
[2:33:42] finish this off cuz this is this is
[2:33:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. Somebody say go on.
[2:33:49] But like like they want to back you up
[2:33:51] on that boy. See, you see, hey, let's go
[2:33:53] on. Let's go on.
[2:33:57] Hallelujah.
[2:33:59] Now watch, watch. What a man from a
[2:34:01] prophet like unto them to Moses. Hear
[2:34:02] these words. Watch. Five spiritual
[2:34:04] offices in the church to set the church
[2:34:06] in order. Yes sir. Apostles, prophets,
[2:34:08] teachers, evangelist, pastors. These
[2:34:10] those are called the offices of God.
[2:34:12] Then in the local coronation, there are
[2:34:14] nine spiritual gifts. Now in these
[2:34:15] offices and places in the offices, you
[2:34:19] hear from the apostle.
[2:34:22] his ministry. You hear from the prophet,
[2:34:25] his ministry, from the evangelist, from
[2:34:27] the teacher, from the pastor. Each has a
[2:34:29] separate ministry and their ministries
[2:34:31] of God. And God has set them in a church
[2:34:33] for this purpose. Amen. He didn't say
[2:34:36] somebody come in and take over. He say
[2:34:38] you're here. Yes. He here. All right.
[2:34:42] Like some in Africa, somebody say don't
[2:34:43] go to your pastor. Go to the five-fold.
[2:34:46] Who's the fivefold? A man picking people
[2:34:48] and say fivefold. Fivefold. Fivefold.
[2:34:50] Fivefold.
[2:34:52] And the fivefold is the men he pick. So
[2:34:55] they're trying to mess up churches by
[2:34:57] bringing a nice denomination
[2:35:00] with papa behind that, pope period
[2:35:02] behind that. Anybody want to be a pope
[2:35:04] or not?
[2:35:08] That's the curse that we have from the
[2:35:10] very first church age. They take the
[2:35:12] anointing off the people and put it on a
[2:35:13] man. They conquer the ley and the ley
[2:35:16] battered now with a corner and God said
[2:35:18] I hate it. Amen. He call it the deeds of
[2:35:21] nicolatan that become a doctrine because
[2:35:24] God is the god of the audience. He want
[2:35:26] God back in the people. He want the
[2:35:28] perfecting of the saints.
[2:35:35] Not the presentation of ministers.
[2:35:39] My lord, I I don't my pastor my pastor
[2:35:42] my pastor not that the ministry pastor
[2:35:47] teacher is for
[2:35:49] the perfecting of the saints in order to
[2:35:51] bring this body into a final close to
[2:35:55] represent him on the earth. It will be
[2:35:58] Christ's ministry reproduced.
[2:36:00] Hallelujah. He presents his army in the
[2:36:02] form of five officers. Yes sir. He
[2:36:05] presents his army. Amen. He says,
[2:36:07] "Pastor, prophet, teachers, evangelists,
[2:36:09] that's his army. That's his soldiers.
[2:36:12] That's his commanding officers all with
[2:36:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting
[2:36:17] out there to meet the enemy on any
[2:36:18] grounds he comes upon to meet the
[2:36:20] enemy." Each one backing one another up
[2:36:24] with him. Here we go. The chief captain
[2:36:26] not out there in front, not up here, not
[2:36:29] above, not behind, but in them.
[2:36:33] Amen. That's the army vindicating and
[2:36:36] vindicating what? His resurrection by
[2:36:39] the proof of his works. Oh my my my
[2:36:43] almost done. That's the thing that God
[2:36:45] will do to his sons here on earth
[2:36:47] someday. He will call you aside, church.
[2:36:49] If you'll only obey him and stay on the
[2:36:52] word and believe it, he will place into
[2:36:54] the church before the coming of Jesus
[2:36:56] Christ. He will place into the church
[2:36:59] all the power that Christ had in him
[2:37:00] will be in the church. All that God was,
[2:37:02] he poured into Jesus. All that Jesus
[2:37:04] was, he pours into the church. God
[2:37:07] wanted his work done, he sent into his
[2:37:09] son. The son wanted his work done, he
[2:37:11] sent into the church at that day. You
[2:37:13] will know I'm in the father, the father
[2:37:15] in me, and I in you, and you in me. At
[2:37:17] that day, because here we go. The same
[2:37:20] power that was in Jehovah God rested in
[2:37:23] Jesus Christ. The same power that rested
[2:37:25] in Jesus Christ rest in placed sons in
[2:37:30] the body of Christ. Musicians come up
[2:37:32] please. The same power that rested in
[2:37:34] Jesus Christ rest in placed sons. He
[2:37:38] didn't say sons. He said place sons.
[2:37:41] These are sons that the Holy Spirit
[2:37:43] reported on.
[2:37:47] So these sons have been approved by the
[2:37:49] father after being pushed into their
[2:37:52] place of trying by the spirit. Oh
[2:37:55] hallelujah. Listen if God revealed to
[2:37:59] you that you are in a place of trying
[2:38:00] you are blessed above all men.
[2:38:02] Hallelujah.
[2:38:04] You ought to be qualified to go in the
[2:38:06] wilderness. People die there.
[2:38:12] when God should be wilderness
[2:38:15] about turning will the who?
[2:38:19] But Jesus was led by the spirit into the
[2:38:23] wilderness to Amen to be tested.
[2:38:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:38:29] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Thank you,
[2:38:33] Jesus. I skipped that. Oh my. Oh my. Oh
[2:38:36] my. I'm done.
[2:38:38] Oh my my my my
[2:38:39] my. Hallelujah. Praise God. I think I'll
[2:38:43] read this last quote. This is the last
[2:38:44] quote I have here and I'm
[2:38:46] done. Oh, dearly beloved, there's some
[2:38:48] question answers. Oh, it's a question.
[2:38:51] Dearly beloved, let's see about the
[2:38:53] scripture of Ephesians 4:11 through 13.
[2:38:57] Do we Let's see. Do we all do we get all
[2:39:01] the perfecting of the saints through the
[2:39:03] tapes? My god. My god. Amen. Hear this
[2:39:08] question. Hear this question. Do we get
[2:39:11] all the perfecting of the saints through
[2:39:13] the tapes? Or should we be here where
[2:39:17] the gifts of the spirit are operating
[2:39:21] and the different offices of the church
[2:39:23] to help perfect us? Our hearts have
[2:39:26] believed all the word of the Lord.
[2:39:28] That's a question presented to the
[2:39:29] prophet.
[2:39:31] Now, this person is from Oregon. No, my
[2:39:34] dear. I believe I know who it is. Yes, I
[2:39:37] do. I certainly do. If the person is
[2:39:39] here, I know if they're not, it might be
[2:39:41] last Sunday. Uh, but your son flies
[2:39:44] conservation and and so forth. He thinks
[2:39:47] he's the one inviting me over to elk
[2:39:49] hunting and so on. Now, no, he said,
[2:39:51] "No, they want to come here to church
[2:39:54] for the perfecting." See, that is where
[2:39:56] we get fellowship one with another here
[2:39:59] at the church. But the perfecting comes
[2:40:02] between us and God. The blood of Christ
[2:40:05] is what perfect us in the Holy Spirit.
[2:40:09] Oh hallelujah. What an answer. The blood
[2:40:12] of Christ perfect us in the Holy Spirit.
[2:40:15] Let's all stand and we want to worship
[2:40:17] the Lord in song and praise. May the
[2:40:20] Lord bless you. Continue to pray for us.
[2:40:22] Pray for the upcoming convention that oh
[2:40:24] the Holy Spirit will have his wonderful
[2:40:26] way. Praise the Lord. Amen.

[2:51:49] nailing down perfection. He is nailing.
[2:51:52] He's not moving from there because he is
[2:51:54] seeing something. And we're not going to
[2:51:57] move from there because it's a promise
[2:51:59] and it's going to happen. Can the church
[2:52:01] say
[2:52:01] amen? My my what a time to be in the

[2:52:15] now we're getting out of here. We don't
[2:52:18] even know if we'll finish our

[2:53:57] soul and from brother Mundus Nicholas
[2:54:00] for my sister Myrtle O'Brien for a total
[2:54:03] deliverance. She's under serious attacks
[2:54:05] of the enemy and I'm thanking God in
[2:54:07] advance and if there's any unwritten or
[2:54:09] unspoken requests you want to show by

[2:54:28] Anderson over there in the US with that
[2:54:30] brain tumor. Lord, may the angel of the
[2:54:32] Lord Lord visit right now, Father, and
[2:54:34] touch from the crown of Lord God of her
[2:54:37] head to the sole of her feet, Father.

[2:54:46] O'Brien Lord for a complete deliverance

[2:55:15] this house, but not from your presence,
[2:55:18] may you be with each one. May you touch
[2:55:20] each one in the precious name of Jesus
[2:55:22] Christ. We commit everything into your
[2:55:24] hands. Amen. And amen. You love the
[2:55:27] Lord. One more
