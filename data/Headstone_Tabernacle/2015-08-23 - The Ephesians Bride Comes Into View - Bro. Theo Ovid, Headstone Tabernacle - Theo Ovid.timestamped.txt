[7:34] Oh, heat, heat.
[7:37] bow heads forward a
[7:41] prayer. Almighty God, I thank you for
[7:44] the vision of the word. I thank you for
[7:48] speaking to our hearts. I thank you for
[7:51] sending Malachi 4, that Elijah prophet
[7:55] to present an open vision to us that we
[7:58] could see where to walk that we could
[8:01] see where to go. Oh, we thank you for
[8:05] the seeds that have been planted in our
[8:06] hearts all these years. We ask you bring
[8:10] it to life today. Father, we ask that
[8:12] your presence saturate this place, Lord.
[8:15] May the water break out. May the windows
[8:17] of heaven open up and pour out your
[8:20] riches blessing upon your people. Bless
[8:22] your word this morning and may you be
[8:24] glorified in Jesus name we ask it. Amen.
[8:28] And amen. God bless you. If you have
[8:31] your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to
[8:33] Joshua chapter 13, Ephesians 1 and
[8:37] Ephesians 4 for a scripture reading this
[8:40] morning. God bless you and welcome.
[8:56] Amen. Reading from Joshua chapter 13. We
[9:00] want to read two verses of that
[9:09] chapter. Now Joshua was old and stricken
[9:11] in years. And the Lord said unto him,
[9:15] "Thou art old and stricken in years, and
[9:18] there remainth yet very much land to be
[9:23] possessed. This is the land that yet
[9:26] remainth. all the borders of the
[9:29] Philistines and all Gishiri and it went
[9:32] down to describe all the other borders
[9:35] and land. We want to turn to Ephesians
[9:38] chapter
[9:43] 1 reading from verse 3 to
[9:48] 5. I'll be after that we turn to
[9:50] Ephesians 4. We read from
[9:53] 4-3 reading Ephesians 3.
[9:57] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[9:59] Lord Jesus Christ, who had blessed us
[10:01] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[10:04] places in Christ, according as he had
[10:08] chosen us in him before the foundation
[10:11] of the world, that we should be holy and
[10:14] without blame before him in love, having
[10:18] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[10:22] children by Jesus Christ to himself,
[10:26] according to the good pleasure of his
[10:29] will. Ephesians chapter 4, we read from
[10:33] verse
[10:37] 4. There is one body and one spirit,
[10:41] even as you're called in one hope of
[10:45] your calling. Amen. One Lord, one faith,
[10:49] one
[10:50] baptism, one God and Father of all, who
[10:54] is above all and through all and in you
[10:57] all. But unto every one of us is given
[11:01] grace, according to the measure of the
[11:05] gift of
[11:06] Christ. Wherefore he seeth, when he
[11:08] ascended up on high, he led captivity
[11:11] captive and give gifts unto men.
[11:14] Now he ascended. What is it? But he also
[11:18] descended first into the lower parts of
[11:19] the earth. He that descended is the same
[11:23] also that ascended up far above heavens
[11:26] that he might fill all things. And he
[11:29] gives some
[11:30] apostles, some prophets, some
[11:35] evangelists, some pastors and teachers.
[11:38] Amen. for the perfecting of the saints,
[11:42] for the work of the ministry, for the
[11:47] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[11:50] all come in the unity of the faith and
[11:55] of the knowledge of the Son of God
[11:58] unto a perfect man,
[12:02] unto the measure of the stature of the
[12:06] fullness of Christ. May God bless his
[12:08] word. You may be seated. Amen.
[12:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[12:14] Hallelujah.
[12:18] This
[12:19] morning concludes a three-part
[12:30] series. And the title of this message
[12:33] this
[12:34] morning is the Ephesians bride comes
[12:38] into view. Amen. Hallelujah. That's the
[12:41] title of the message this morning. The
[12:42] Ephesians
[12:44] bride comes into view. Hallelujah. I
[12:47] have a subject another Ephesians. Amen.
[12:51] Amen. Amen. And I have an inspiration.
[12:55] The Ephesians bridge to glory land.
[12:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now this is a
[13:00] very very important service. Amen. Amen.
[13:03] Amen. It's very important service. Amen.
[13:07] I am trusting that it enlighten you
[13:12] uh into what God called you onto. Amen.
[13:15] And the
[13:16] church you want to belong to. Amen.
[13:21] Cuz everybody going to belong to a
[13:23] church. That's right. Everybody going to
[13:25] be in a church. Amen. There is one Lord.
[13:28] Yes sir. And there is one faith and
[13:31] there's one baptism. But there are many
[13:32] churches. Yes. Yes. Hallelujah. Amen.
[13:37] This is Paul
[13:39] prayer to the Ephesians church in
[13:41] Ephesians
[13:42] 3:14-21. Listen to Paul. For this cause
[13:46] I bow my knees unto the father of our
[13:49] Lord Jesus
[13:50] Christ of whom the whole family in
[13:53] heaven and earth is named.
[13:56] that he would grant
[13:58] you according to the riches of his glory
[14:02] to be strengthened with might by his
[14:06] spirit in the inner man.
[14:11] He is not talking about the outer man.
[14:14] He is talking about the inner man. You
[14:18] have an inner man. Yeah. A man on the
[14:22] inside that could be weak, worn out,
[14:27] failing, falling. A man that could be
[14:29] strengthened, empowered, inspired. You
[14:32] have an inner man. And your inner man is
[14:35] more important than the outward man. We
[14:38] take a lot of time on the outward man
[14:41] with clothes and face and dress and
[14:43] everything else, but what about the
[14:45] inner man? Amen. But Paul was praying
[14:48] that strength would come might by his
[14:52] spirit in the inner man. Because if your
[14:55] inner man is empowered, a lot of things
[14:58] around that your senses see would look
[15:01] so small and look so out of tune with
[15:04] your inner man that you will know who is
[15:06] in charge.
[15:09] Oh, glory to God. Because many time we
[15:11] let the outer man be in charge. Now we
[15:14] said something last week. The original
[15:16] man was a spirit man, not a flesh man.
[15:20] The Genesis one man was a spirit man.
[15:23] And God said there was no man to till
[15:25] the soil. So he put the real man in the
[15:28] five senses man. And man became a living
[15:30] soul. And in the beginning that man,
[15:33] that flesh man with spirit in him was
[15:36] led by the spirit. So every evening in
[15:39] the cool of the evening, Adam was
[15:41] talking fellowship with God himself.
[15:44] Adam, I'm right here, Lord. Adam, I'm
[15:47] right here, Lord. I'm in the word, Lord.
[15:50] I'm in the spirit, Lord. I am working,
[15:53] Lord. I thank you for revealing stuff to
[15:55] me, Lord. But he was all alone. So God,
[15:58] pull out to Adam and reveal a woman out
[16:00] that was locked up inside of him. And
[16:03] Jesus had a woman locked up inside of
[16:05] him also. And that's the bride. Could we
[16:08] give the Lord a shout of praise? And
[16:10] that bride is the church in which he is
[16:13] the head. He is the head of the body
[16:15] called the church. Oh, give the Lord a
[16:18] shout of praise. And when Paul came, he
[16:20] called to put a foundation which no
[16:22] other man could lay but Jesus Christ
[16:25] himself. And Paul started out the
[16:27] Ephesians church. And that was the gold
[16:29] standard.
[16:31] [Applause]
[16:32] That was the gold standard. That is why
[16:36] William Brham the Malachi for Elijah
[16:38] prophet didn't come just to bring
[16:40] something. He came to turn our hearts
[16:42] back because that was the original.
[16:45] That's where it all started before you
[16:47] go forward. You have to go back and pick
[16:50] up what they had and then we could go
[16:52] forward. There is no rapture if you
[16:55] can't go back and pick up what was
[16:57] alpha. He said I am alpha and omega. We
[17:00] have to go back and pick up the faith
[17:02] that was once delivered to the
[17:05] saints. I'm so convinced that what Peter
[17:09] have you will have. What Paul have you
[17:11] would have what the early church have
[17:13] this last day church going to have.
[17:16] There is going to be another Ephesians.
[17:24] Glory.
[17:27] Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:30] Hallelujah. Paul that you be
[17:33] strengthened with might. Amen. Not with
[17:36] weakness. Not with slackness. Not with a
[17:39] depress. Not a down and out. And I don't
[17:42] own a not that. But you strengthen with
[17:46] might by his spirit in the inner man
[17:50] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[17:52] faith. And that ye being rooted and
[17:56] grounded in love may be able to
[17:59] comprehend with all things. Hallelujah.
[18:02] What is the breadth and the length and
[18:05] the depth and the height. Here we go.
[18:08] And to know the love of Christ which
[18:12] passeth knowledge. Amen.
[18:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To
[18:20] know the love of Christ which passeth
[18:22] knowledge. Glor that you might be filled
[18:24] with all the fullness of God. Now unto
[18:27] him that is able to do
[18:29] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[18:33] could ask or think according to the
[18:37] power that workketh in us. Unto him be
[18:40] glory in the church by Jesus Christ
[18:42] throughout all ages world without end.
[18:45] Amen. Oh glory could we give the Lord
[18:48] some praises.
[18:50] You love him this morning.
[18:54] Okay, so let's get down into the word
[18:56] for a man running from the presence of
[18:58] the Lord. Dear Jesus, help us tonight
[19:01] now with these few words as we wait upon
[19:03] thee. And we pray that your grace and
[19:06] mercy will be with us, Lord, and tend
[19:08] our hearts. Move back all the shocks,
[19:10] the thorns, the tissles. Let the blessed
[19:13] sunshine of God fall upon the word,
[19:16] Lord. And may we have such a great
[19:18] meeting till there will not be an unsafe
[19:21] person among us. All the children will
[19:24] be in the kingdom of God. Those without
[19:26] the baptism of the spirit, may they
[19:29] receive it, Father. May all the great
[19:32] mysteries that we are supposed to know
[19:35] at this age Lord be unveiled to us that
[19:39] we will see the plainness of God so that
[19:43] we will know how to behave
[19:47] ourselves and act correcting ourselves
[19:52] and bringing the members of our body
[19:55] into discipline to the word that we
[19:58] might know how to live in this present
[20:01] day at the approaching of the Lord
[20:04] Jesus. Let's just go over that again.
[20:07] The unveiling of the mysteries is not
[20:11] for you to say you know mysteries. You
[20:13] have mysteries whether written or hidden
[20:15] or whatever it is. The purpose of the
[20:17] mysteries is it to be unveiled that you
[20:20] might know the plainess of God because
[20:24] God was so mysterious. He wanted to
[20:27] reveal himself. That's why the word
[20:31] became flesh. That's why he spanned from
[20:35] Elohim into logos and become flesh among
[20:39] us. That we could handle him that he
[20:42] could be touched by the feeling of his
[20:45] our infirmities. In other words, he
[20:48] didn't come down that he become more
[20:49] mysterious. He that he was very
[20:52] mysterious. That is why the Lord himself
[20:55] descend with the book open to bring
[20:58] Christ the mystery to be revealed into
[21:01] you. Oh give the Lord a shout of praise.
[21:05] So therefore all this preaching and
[21:07] teaching have an objective.
[21:10] You think on the other side we'll be
[21:12] talking about this mystery and that
[21:13] mystery.
[21:15] When brother Brandon broke into the next
[21:17] dimension his wife said Bill you preach
[21:19] about it. You talk about it but you
[21:21] don't know what it is. This is the land
[21:23] of perfect love. It take love to enter
[21:26] here. It's not no teachings to enter
[21:29] here. It's not no Amen. intellectual
[21:32] stuff. It's not chemistry and biology
[21:34] and physics and arithmetic to enter
[21:36] there. It will take love to enter there.
[21:39] Could somebody say amen?
[21:41] Oh, are you with me? Amen. So therefore
[21:45] the
[21:46] mystery
[21:47] revelations are all supposed to bring us
[21:50] to a place that we could see the pleness
[21:53] of God so we will know how to behave
[21:56] ourselves.
[21:57] [Music]
[22:00] Hallelujah. Look look look at that man
[22:01] from Africa who was think about and they
[22:04] wanted to buy him and the slave owner
[22:06] said no not for sale. They say why does
[22:09] he eat different? No. Does he sleep on
[22:11] the front? No. is I always wondered
[22:13] about that man and I learn about him
[22:16] back in Africa. His father is the king
[22:18] of the tribe and he knows he's a son of
[22:21] a king. So he walks like one. He talks
[22:24] like one. He acts like one. He sleeps
[22:26] like one. He walks like one. Praise God.
[22:29] Like what the prophet said, if you're a
[22:30] saint, act like a saint, walk like a
[22:32] saint, talk like a saint, live like a
[22:34] saint, die like a saint, and go to
[22:36] heaven like a saint.
[22:38] Not like a devil like a saint.
[22:47] Hallelujah.
[22:48] Glory to God.
[22:51] [Music]
[22:52] [Applause]
[22:53] From the
[22:54] masterpiece doing something a little
[22:56] different today, but I'll discuss
[22:59] Brian. I'm
[23:00] speaking. You see,
[23:10] you find I quote too much.
[23:16] All right. As long as as long as you
[23:18] don't find a problem with that, we're
[23:20] good.
[23:21] I've got 7 minutes to tell you something
[23:23] that happened day before
[23:25] yesterday, July the 3rd. This is for
[23:28] masterpiece 5th of July
[23:31] 1964. I was over in the center shopping
[23:35] center right out here. I've been in
[23:37] Piggalli in Rome in France. I've been in
[23:39] New York, Los
[23:40] Angeles. But the filthiest bunch of
[23:43] women I've ever seen my life is
[23:45] Jessville,
[23:47] Indiana. I've never seen so much gum and
[23:51] filth in my life as I see amongst them
[23:54] people. I sat there till my heart achd
[23:58] and the Lord give me a vision. Amen.
[24:04] And now I'm going to tell the vision.
[24:06] Tell the vision. I don't know that I can
[24:09] interpret it, but I'm going to tell the
[24:10] vision for my first
[24:12] time. I fell into a
[24:15] trance. And when I did, there was
[24:18] somebody with
[24:19] me. I didn't see the person. It was just
[24:23] a voice. Amen.
[24:26] And I looked and I looked this way and
[24:28] he said, "The bride will come in view."
[24:33] Amen.
[24:35] For preview.
[24:38] I looked coming to me. I seen the most
[24:42] prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I
[24:45] ever seen in my life. Hallelujah. Each
[24:49] one of them looked like was dressed
[24:51] different. They had long hair.
[24:55] They were longer sleeves and skirts and
[24:57] so forth. Young woman, they look kind of
[24:59] say about maybe 20. Now I have the Bible
[25:02] open before me. I can only see what I
[25:04] seen. And if you say, "What are you
[25:08] looking at?" I'm looking at a clock.
[25:10] What are you looking at? I'm looking for
[25:11] people looking at people. What are you
[25:13] looking at? I'm looking at the Bible.
[25:14] That's what I'm telling the truth.
[25:16] That's what I see. Amen. I can only say
[25:19] what I seen. I don't know all about it.
[25:21] I just have to tell you. Amen. Amen.
[25:24] But when this bride, she was looking,
[25:26] the one was talking to me and I standing
[25:28] together, her eyes, she was the
[25:31] cleanest, sweetest looking people I ever
[25:34] seen in my life. It looked like it could
[25:37] have been a dozen or more. I don't know
[25:39] how many was a breast, but it was in a
[25:42] group of them. And she passed by
[25:45] sweetly and her eyes watching as she
[25:47] passed by. She was beautiful. I look at
[25:49] her as she passed by and he said, "Now
[25:53] we shall
[25:55] review." That's the
[25:57] bride. Now we will review the
[26:01] churches. So first in the vision, the
[26:05] bride, yes, was walking in front of him.
[26:08] Yes. The voice told him, "Now we will
[26:12] review the churches." Are you with me
[26:14] this morning? Amen. Good. Amen. And they
[26:17] come. I noticed them coming up and when
[26:21] they come up each one looked like it was
[26:24] getting worse.
[26:27] This is not the worldly people now. This
[26:30] is a
[26:31] vision brought before the prophet
[26:34] showing first the bride then the
[26:37] churches. Yes. Okay. Now watch. I have
[26:41] never seen a filthy bunch in my life.
[26:44] And he said next. I heard a noise. Next.
[26:47] And here comes the American group. Now,
[26:50] I'm an American, but this made me sick.
[26:53] I am not eloquent enough in a mixed
[26:56] audience to say what was taking place.
[26:59] You have to read between the lines. But
[27:02] when the woman was coming, the leader of
[27:04] them was a witch. She had a great long
[27:07] nose, a great big mouth, and all of them
[27:09] was dressed with some kind of lower
[27:11] clothes down here. But the top was just
[27:14] a strap, a halfin strap that move up and
[27:18] down and went around like this. Each
[27:20] woman had something. Many of you years
[27:23] ago remember we used to cut that paper
[27:25] newspaper and make a old fly bush. How
[27:27] many remember that? I used to used to
[27:29] use it in carnivals hanging down like
[27:31] fringe paper, lace paper that had
[27:34] something holding below them like this.
[27:36] That part was all exposed. Each one had
[27:39] hair cut real short freezy looking
[27:42] things like that. Real shortcut here,
[27:45] full of makeup, absolutely nothing but
[27:48] looking like street prostitutes. Now
[27:50] this is the church in the spirit realm.
[27:55] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. In the physical
[27:58] realm, they impuse. Yes. Yes. Yes. They
[28:02] are preachers, but in the spirit realm,
[28:03] that's what God sees.
[28:10] And they were walking with this paper
[28:12] and the vulgarity, not the paper, what
[28:14] was holding in front of them. And when
[28:16] they passed the review stand in the back
[28:18] of them to see the way they were going
[28:20] on, their foremost and their back part,
[28:22] how they were acting, I said, "Is that
[28:24] the church?" And there she went. They
[28:28] were singing here twist and roll songs,
[28:30] you know, and singing all along. I said,
[28:33] "Is that the church?" I was standing
[28:35] there in my heart. I was crying. And
[28:38] this witch to my notion is nothing else
[28:40] in the world. She that wool council
[28:42] church is leading them straight down the
[28:44] road where she was going. They went off
[28:45] to the left and disappeared in chaos.
[28:47] still beating this music and making real
[28:50] funny songs, shaking their buddies one
[28:52] side and the other side and then carry
[28:55] on like that. And I started to bow my
[28:57] head and say,
[28:58] "Wait, here we go. The bride must come
[29:02] again." Amen. Amen. And I looked and
[29:06] here they come again and they passed by.
[29:09] A sweet looking little ladies was all
[29:12] looking right at me as they passed by.
[29:13] And I noticed each one dressed
[29:15] different. And one of them had their
[29:17] hair hanging down, rolled back like
[29:19] that, might have been German. I was
[29:20] watched them. And as they started
[29:23] leaving, two or three of them in the
[29:24] back kind of get out of step. And I was
[29:27] going to holler at them. And they was
[29:28] trying to get back in step again. I seen
[29:30] them just the vision fade out from me.
[29:34] Amen. What a vision. Amen. Amen. That
[29:38] this prophet saw. Hallelujah. Here is
[29:41] the interpretation thereof.
[29:44] Amen. Hallelujah. So God gave him the
[29:45] interpretation right there. Here is the
[29:48] interpretation thereof. Remember I had
[29:51] just got through writing. I hadn't
[29:52] finished. I hadn't wrote these notes
[29:54] yet. But in preaching this morning, I
[29:58] caught what it was right in my sermon.
[30:02] Did you notice the church came in view?
[30:06] That's the truth, friend. Now, not
[30:08] knowing it till a few minutes ago, did
[30:10] you notice the bride comes in view
[30:13] twice? Yes.
[30:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[30:21] Amen.
[30:23] So, you see my title this morning? Yes.
[30:25] Yes. The Ephesians bride comes into
[30:27] view. Amen. Oh,
[30:33] hallelujah. My my my. Here we go. Okay,
[30:38] now watch. Let me get it back
[30:40] here. Now watch. Did you notice the
[30:43] bride comes to the view twice? The first
[30:46] seed and the second seed, both of them
[30:49] exactly the same one. And the reason
[30:52] they dressed different parts, she'll
[30:54] come from all nations. It will make up
[30:57] the bride. Each one had long hair, no
[31:00] makeup, real pretty girls, and they were
[31:02] watching me. that represented the bride
[31:05] coming out of all nations. Each one
[31:08] represented a nation and they marched
[31:10] perfectly down in the line and I had to
[31:13] watch her. She will get out a step with
[31:15] the word if I don't watch. And when she
[31:18] was passing by, if she gets by, maybe
[31:20] it'll be my time. I'm over. I'm
[31:22] finished. Whatever it is, they were
[31:24] getting back, trying their best, was
[31:26] getting back and get in line cuz they
[31:29] were looking out somewhere else,
[31:30] watching about the church that went out
[31:32] into chaos. But the front ones never,
[31:35] the back ones, two or three of them was
[31:37] kind of step out of bit to the right
[31:39] side, looking like they were trying to
[31:40] get back in line. They were just past me
[31:42] and so on. Notice, here we go. The
[31:45] church only came in view once.
[31:50] Hallelujah.
[31:51] each nation, the church, but the bride
[31:53] came in twice.
[31:58] And I was standing there and I just seen
[32:00] it all move out and leave. He said, "Now
[32:02] watch the church came into the view
[32:04] once, each nation, the church, but the
[32:06] bride coming twice. What is it?" Not
[32:09] knowing it, but it look at it with my
[32:11] message this morning. Not knowing that
[32:13] the seed that fell in the ground at Na
[32:16] that was original seed and she come
[32:18] through the process denomination. What
[32:21] is he saying? The original faith, the
[32:23] original seed, the Ephesus church and
[32:26] afterwards church ages and afterwards
[32:28] another Ephesus church. There is going
[32:30] to be another
[32:32] Ephesians. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[32:35] The prophet saw it by vision. He saw me.
[32:40] He saw you.
[32:42] He saw us or give the Lord a
[32:46] shout. The vision can't lie.
[32:50] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:55] He saw you in the vision.
[32:59] The seed that fell in the na was the
[33:01] original seed and she come through the
[33:03] process of these denominations and only
[33:06] comes in existence once, but the bride
[33:08] returns back again in the last days. I
[33:11] will restore the first church and the
[33:14] last church is the same church. The
[33:16] first bride and the last bride is the
[33:18] same bride. Oh, glory to God. All the
[33:20] other churches in
[33:25] between. My God. You may be seated.
[33:28] Therefore, Ephesians is a hidden mystery
[33:31] in this last day because the Bible only
[33:33] talk of the loudish year. But hidden in
[33:36] there, hidden in there, God promised to
[33:39] have another Ephesians church. Oh, give
[33:42] the Lord a shout of praise. And the
[33:44] prophet got a vision. Oh, I love it this
[33:47] morning. Glory. How could you
[33:51] fail? The vision can't
[33:56] fail. Oh, glory to God. And I say this
[33:59] morning that Ephesians bride is coming
[34:02] into view. We're going to see what kind
[34:04] of church that is. And we're going to
[34:06] identify what she is not.
[34:10] Oh, give the Lord a shout. We're going
[34:12] to identify what she is not.
[34:17] [Applause]
[34:19] Hallelujah.
[34:21] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. G.
[34:24] The Bible turns back again in the last
[34:26] days. I'll restore. See, the masterpiece
[34:29] is brought up. And that's the reason she
[34:32] was in view. Reviewed the second time.
[34:34] She was reviewed the first time. Then
[34:36] she was reviewed the second time. She
[34:38] was perfectly the second time. She was
[34:40] like the first time. Oh mercy, get in
[34:43] the grain. All others never appeared no
[34:46] more. They went out never to come back
[34:47] again. But the bride came back cuz she
[34:49] was alpha and omega. God the great
[34:52] sculptor has made him a masterpiece. It
[34:54] is a piece of his masterpiece. He made
[34:56] in the garden of Eden and took a piece
[34:58] from another piece was mad and fell and
[35:01] has been building all along. He brought
[35:03] forth a masterpiece. That part was
[35:05] smitten and it was in order to bring
[35:07] back a masterpiece again. So the
[35:09] masterpiece and the son of God, the
[35:11] masterpiece and the bride, it's peace of
[35:13] him. It must be a fulfilling of the
[35:16] word. The word must be fulfilled and we
[35:19] are ready for the coming of the Lord.
[35:21] Oh, give the Lord some worship. Here am
[35:23] I to worship. Oh, glory to God. How am I
[35:27] supposed to feel when I know the prophet
[35:29] saw a vision of the bride coming into
[35:31] preview? How am I supposed to feel like
[35:34] some more back seven churches member?
[35:36] No. I heard a voice come
[35:39] up. Oh,
[35:41] hallelujah. Are you hearing that voice
[35:44] this morning?
[35:49] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[35:52] Glory. Woo. Amen. When I was a child, I
[35:56] speak like a child, I understood as a
[35:57] child. But when I became a man, I put up
[36:00] with childish things. And then we see
[36:02] through a glass darkly, but then face to
[36:03] face. Isn't that right? But when that
[36:05] which is perfect is come, then that
[36:07] which in part shall be done over it. So
[36:09] when perfection come, part is no longer
[36:11] accepted. Come on now. Come on now. Are
[36:15] you hearing what I'm preaching this
[36:16] morning? When that which is perfect is
[36:18] come, part cannot be accepted. So God
[36:21] promised another Ephesians in which
[36:23] there's going to be a five-fold ministry
[36:25] for the perfecting of the saint for the
[36:27] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[36:30] the body till we all come into the unity
[36:32] of the faith. There is going to be a
[36:35] unity of the faith. God said so.
[36:41] Oh
[36:42] hallelujah. Glory to God. What are you
[36:44] saying? I'm saying every minister with
[36:47] the salt have to come back to Ephesians.
[36:49] They could run around the world. They
[36:51] could preach whatever they want to
[36:52] preach, feel whatever they want to feel,
[36:54] but the door is right there because
[36:56] Ephesians is the bridge
[36:59] to glory land.
[37:02] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Glory to
[37:05] God. Amen. You may be seated. Oh,
[37:09] hallelujah. Oh, church of the living
[37:12] God. Bow your hearts and yourselves
[37:14] before God. These things are true. I
[37:17] know it sounds such a great thing would
[37:19] be would be spread all over the nations
[37:21] but he doesn't change. Just be thankful
[37:23] church. Be thankful that you are where
[37:25] you are today if you are in Christ.
[37:28] Remember all that life will be gathered
[37:31] into the grain for the resurrection and
[37:34] the stalk must be burned. My God, how
[37:37] long I wanted to get a corn tree in
[37:39] stages and to show you the green and
[37:41] everything else and it's standing there
[37:43] all the green life, all the green stem
[37:45] and so on. They shouting, bowling,
[37:47] hallelujah and glory. But when that that
[37:49] that corn comes out and that branch
[37:52] start to dry and the tree start to dry.
[37:54] All the life that was green and
[37:56] hallelujah and they love the Lord and
[37:58] love the pastor love coming to church.
[38:00] All of that start to dry up and just the
[38:03] grain have the life. Come on say amen
[38:06] somebody. This is not a game.
[38:09] Come on say amen somebody. Glory to God.
[38:12] Understand this. You may be see that the
[38:14] seed was the original The seed is what
[38:16] went down into the ground. The life push
[38:18] out processes, the stem, the leaves, the
[38:21] flowers, everything else. But when it
[38:23] come back to grain, it come back to
[38:25] alpha and omega. When it come back to
[38:27] grain, the first is the last, the last
[38:30] is the first. When it come back to
[38:31] grain, it's back to original seed. Which
[38:35] is the spoken word.
[38:39] [Applause]
[38:43] My God,
[38:44] you should be praising God that you
[38:47] hearing these things quote back to you.
[38:49] You should be praising God. We like you
[38:51] not. We don't have a seed of our own.
[38:54] God send a prophet to bring spoken word
[38:57] to say say what the tape say because
[38:59] it's by these promises we become
[39:02] partakers of the divine nature. You
[39:04] better thank God. You know, we have come
[39:06] in here with our own ideas. We're not
[39:08] trying to put ourselves into you. We're
[39:10] not trying to preach our ministry into
[39:12] you. We're not trying to identify our
[39:14] church into you. It is Christ to be in
[39:16] you. The hope of glory. Oh, come on. No
[39:19] excuses. Come on. Give the Lord a shout.
[39:22] No excuses. No excuses.
[39:25] [Applause]
[39:33] This is the first time I'm doing
[39:34] something like this. I put the things up
[39:36] front. Let me go down deeper. So the
[39:39] vision, you already get the vision.
[39:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, glory to
[39:43] God. Listen to this brother in paradox.
[39:47] He's speaking to a man. How do you do,
[39:49] sir? Amen. We are strangers to each
[39:51] other. I don't know you as far as I
[39:54] know. It's the first time I've seen you
[39:56] for me to know you. That's right. But he
[39:58] knows us, both of us. Now you know what
[40:01] is taking place. It's his grace
[40:03] permitting it that will bring these
[40:05] people conscious of God. Now, not
[40:07] knowing nothing about you, not even
[40:09] knowing who you are. No way. Just a
[40:11] strange man come here. Now, it will be
[40:14] absolutely a paradox for something to
[40:16] happen to know what's wrong with you,
[40:18] something you had done, something you
[40:20] ought not to have done or something you
[40:23] should have done or who you are or
[40:26] something about you. It would have to be
[40:28] a paradox cuz there's no way for anybody
[40:30] to know that outside of some revelation
[40:32] of the unseen. That's right. Now if he
[40:35] will do that for you between you and I
[40:38] so that the audience here we go not a
[40:41] show but that they might see the Ephesus
[40:45] is here and this is the thing that
[40:49] bridges between denomination and glory
[40:52] land. He promised it that they might be
[40:56] assured that we are telling you the
[40:57] truth. Amen. So the prophet was saying
[41:00] let this not for a show let the people
[41:03] see another Ephesus is here and this is
[41:08] the thing that makes a bridge bridges
[41:10] between denomination and glory land. Oh
[41:13] we are putting a bridge down for you and
[41:15] all you got to do is to walk on that
[41:17] bridge. That's not a Galatians bridge.
[41:20] It's not a Hebrew bridge. It's not a
[41:22] Corinthians bridge. It is an Ephesians
[41:25] bridge. Oh give the Lord a shout of
[41:27] praise. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[41:31] Hallelujah.
[41:32] Glory to God. Amen.
[41:35] Glory. Glory. Blessed be the name of the
[41:38] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What kind
[41:41] of church was the Corinthians church?
[41:44] Corinthians 5:1 is reported commonly
[41:46] that there's fornication among you. And
[41:48] such fornication as is not as much name
[41:50] among the Gentiles. My God. Not even
[41:53] unbelievers had that kind of behavior.
[41:56] That's this is this is
[41:58] Corinthians that one should have his
[42:00] father's wife and he have puffed up and
[42:03] have not mourned and he had done this
[42:05] deed might be taken away from you for
[42:07] verily as absent in the body and present
[42:10] in spirit have judged already and though
[42:12] I were present concerning him that has
[42:14] done this deed in the name of the Lord
[42:16] Jesus Christ when you were gathered
[42:18] together and my spirit with the power of
[42:20] the Lord Jesus to deliver such a one to
[42:23] Satan for the destruction ction of the
[42:26] flesh that the spirit may be saved in
[42:28] the day of the Lord Jesus. Amen. So the
[42:31] Corinthian church was a filthy church.
[42:34] People do what they want to do and still
[42:36] go to church. That's Corinthian. And if
[42:39] you're doing what you want to do and
[42:41] coming to church, you are Corinthians.
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] Hallelujah. Amen. You could be in here,
[42:49] but you are Corinthians. Amen. That is
[42:52] not the bridge. Amen. Hallelujah. It
[42:55] have Corinthian church in Trina. It have
[42:57] Corinthian pastor. He's very nice. Amen.
[43:00] It's very welcoming. Anything goes.
[43:03] Hallelujah. They show a lot of love.
[43:06] Amen.
[43:09] Amen. They help you. They get
[43:10] transportation to go home.
[43:14] They feed you. They give you this. They
[43:16] give you that. But it's Corinthians.
[43:19] If that's what you want, you could go
[43:20] there. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[43:25] God has blessed people in in his
[43:27] permissive will.
[43:29] Don't be like Balam.
[43:31] Get blessed in permissive will and think
[43:34] because you have God's blessing, it's
[43:36] okay to do what you're doing.
[43:40] In a time of ignorance, God wink. But we
[43:43] come about time of ignorance. The
[43:45] prophet came to bring light.
[43:48] The prophet came to bring truth.
[43:51] that we who were once ignorant walking
[43:54] in darkness may now walk in the light.
[43:57] [Applause]
[44:00] Now listen, whether you say amen or
[44:02] shout, that is not going to stop me from
[44:04] preaching what I have to preach this
[44:06] morning. I'm not preaching for amens or
[44:08] shouts. I don't ever do that. I
[44:11] encourage you to worship and to praise
[44:13] God and give the Lord a shout. That is
[44:14] for your benefit because when you
[44:16] worship and praise God, you create an
[44:18] atmosphere around your life and those
[44:20] demons have to take leave.
[44:27] Glory to God.
[44:29] Amen.
[44:31] Hallelujah. When I come behind the pit,
[44:33] I come with angels with me. Hallelujah.
[44:36] I come with an army behind me.
[44:41] I come with backup. I not coming here
[44:43] without backup. It's a war.
[44:48] Oh, give the Lord some praise, people.
[44:53] Hallelujah.
[44:55] [Applause]
[45:00] Hallelujah. You know, season, do you
[45:02] know why any Ephesians? Because you have
[45:04] to put on the whole armor of God.
[45:06] Because we wrestle not against flesh and
[45:08] blood, but against principal. That's
[45:10] why.
[45:19] You may be seated. Hallelujah.
[45:21] Hallelujah.
[45:22] Hallelujah.
[45:25] Question and answers. Hallelujah. Glory.
[45:29] That's what the matter with the churches
[45:30] today. When a man comes into the body of
[45:32] Christ and becomes a member and start
[45:35] doing evil instead of all you getting
[45:38] together and doing the very thing you
[45:40] bam tabernacle do that because as long
[45:43] as you're holding him up he's under the
[45:45] blood and he just keep doing the same
[45:47] old thing over and over and over all the
[45:50] time. You get together turn him over to
[45:54] the devil for the destruction of the
[45:55] flesh that his spirit might be saved in
[45:57] the Lord. Watch the whip of God comes
[46:01] in. Watch the devil take a hold of him
[46:04] that an evil spirit gets him.
[46:09] God has loosed evil spirits upon
[46:13] backseat Christians to torment them,
[46:18] to haunt them, to trouble them, to get
[46:22] them back into the house of God. We will
[46:25] not feel sorry for you.
[46:30] because we are preaching the word.
[46:33] [Applause]
[46:38] And if you don't want to make things
[46:40] right, a demon going to come upon your
[46:42] life. You'll be tormented. You'll be
[46:44] terrorized.
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:47] It's better you don't come to church.
[46:50] It's better you stay out of here. We not
[46:52] preaching for members, for money, for
[46:54] popularity. We not even preaching about
[46:56] that. Come on, say amen, somebody. Oh,
[47:00] glory to God. Hallelujah.
[47:03] Last last last service, you may be
[47:05] seated. We talk about the lust of the
[47:06] eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the
[47:07] pride of life. All that is in the world.
[47:10] And the prophet talk about three things
[47:12] on men. That's right.
[47:16] Money, popularity, and woman is still
[47:18] losing the eyes. That's the pride of
[47:20] life. When somebody have money, they
[47:22] don't care. Amen.
[47:25] They fear neither man nor god because
[47:27] they could pay the way for everything.
[47:28] They could be snubbish. They could be
[47:31] arrogant. They could look down on you
[47:33] because they have two piece of paper in
[47:35] their pocket.
[47:39] Amen. But what shall it profit a man if
[47:42] he gain the whole world and lose his own
[47:44] soul? You have money but you're not
[47:47] happy.
[47:49] You have a husband, you want a man so
[47:51] long, you get it, you're still not
[47:52] happy. You want a wife, you're not
[47:54] happy. What going to make you happy? Oh,
[47:57] say amen. Somebody don't get me startled
[48:00] out of
[48:06] here. I am called to preach the
[48:09] gospel. Not whole showers, baby showers,
[48:13] wedding showers, not have all these set
[48:15] of events. God said go all the world and
[48:18] have showers.
[48:20] Preach the gospel.
[48:26] Glory to God. Don't fault me for no
[48:28] event held inside of here. If you want
[48:31] to judge me, judge me by what I'm called
[48:33] to do, which is to preach the gospel.
[48:36] [Applause]
[48:43] You may be seated. Hallelujah.
[48:47] Glory to God.
[48:49] The Corinthians had no anger for sin.
[48:55] You see, they was telling people, uh,
[48:57] keep it in confidence.
[49:01] Don't don't sin under nobody.
[49:04] And you like a slacker just like them
[49:06] because you're keeping sin in
[49:07] confidence. What kind of nonsense is
[49:09] that? Don't let nobody bind you. Don't
[49:11] tell nobody. Don't don't don't don't
[49:13] speak it.
[49:15] This is your church. What kind of church
[49:18] do you want?
[49:20] I'm not hearing you. I want you to
[49:22] preach after me. I'm not hearing
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:29] you. Don't tell. Don't tell the
[49:31] ministry. Don't tell. Don't tell the
[49:33] elder. Don't tell. Don't tell. Don't
[49:34] tell. You better come on.
[49:38] That's not gossiping. When you don't
[49:40] tell and you have your own little
[49:41] gossiping group, that's gossiping.
[49:44] That's evil spirit.
[49:47] [Applause]
[49:56] [Music]
[49:57] Anas and Safara.
[50:01] They offered to bring sell and bring the
[50:03] money to the church. Nobody begged them.
[50:05] Nobody ordered them. Nobody took a gun
[50:07] and said you got to bring it. No, they
[50:09] offered that. Amen.
[50:12] Amen. It was their choice.
[50:15] They could have say we not put in
[50:17] anything and they were good.
[50:20] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. But because of
[50:23] that heart that's so corrupt. Yes. They
[50:27] couldn't even be honest to God. Amen.
[50:29] Hallelujah.
[50:31] Yes.
[50:34] You think God need your money?
[50:37] You don't want to contribute to offering
[50:39] tithes, billing for nothing. You think
[50:40] God need your money. So you want to
[50:42] sponge for all the other people who
[50:43] sacrifice to contribute to this church
[50:45] and you don't have the pans of any
[50:47] sacrifice whatsoever. You think God need
[50:48] your money. He doesn't. He wants to
[50:50] bless you. That's why he said for what
[50:52] you supposed to do. If you don't do
[50:54] that, you affect your own self. You're
[50:57] not affecting the church because the
[50:58] church moves on.
[51:00] [Applause]
[51:05] Hallelujah.
[51:07] So don't don't let anybody bind you.
[51:09] Amen. And Ning Safara. Safara live with
[51:12] the man. She know the man dishonest.
[51:15] She know the man is a crook.
[51:18] Hallelujah. My problem is not an answer.
[51:22] My problem is to fire her.
[51:26] Because she know better.
[51:29] Peter come, they bring the money. He
[51:31] said, "Is this all?" He said, "Yes." He
[51:34] could have said, "Is that all? Where the
[51:35] rest home?"
[51:37] He could have said, "This is all.
[51:38] There's some. The rest coming. The rest
[51:40] coming in the soul. He can say anything
[51:42] else. Is this all? Yes, that's all. He
[51:44] said, "But you're light of the Holy
[51:45] Ghost." Yes.
[51:48] Because God already firebombed Peter's
[51:51] heart. The demon leave Peter a long
[51:54] time. Fire on that throne. Pillar of
[51:58] fire watching through his eyes. It was
[52:00] like the eyes of God. It was genuine
[52:03] Ephesians, Ephesus, Holy Ghost Church,

[52:28] flesh and blood. You see a tie. You see
[52:30] a jacket. Do you really know what's in a
[52:33] man?
[52:34] [Music]
[52:35] Do you really know what's in a woman?
[52:38] What's hiding in that heart?
[52:42] That's why the Bible said the word is a
[52:43] discerner of the thoughts and intense of
[52:45] the heart. The word have to go down
[52:48] between the bone and the marrow to see
[52:50] what's inside of there. You could have
[52:51] an adulterous spirit under a long dress
[52:54] looking pious. Pious. You could have a
[52:56] fornicating spirit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[52:58] With tie and jacket looking smiling

[54:18] an individual affair. Both all going in
[54:20] the cemetery together. Let us go
[54:22] together where

[56:46] man. God permitted the devil to come
[56:47] upon him and chastise him. Everything
[56:49] else praise God for the perfection of
[56:51] his spirit. Isn't that right?
[56:53] Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. That's
[56:56] the Corinthian church. Lord, what you
[56:59] want? What you should belong to. Say I
[57:01] don't like how do things fine. It have a
[57:04] nice Corinthian church.
[57:07] So wherever so is hope nobody take my
[57:10] finger and try to measure my finger as
[57:12] much.
[57:14] Amen.
[57:17] That is what we don't want. Amen. You
[57:19] could have it but that's not what
[57:21] promised. You could fall into it but
[57:24] that's not the promise. Amen. That's
[57:27] one. Let's look at Galatians. Paul
[57:31] Galatians 6. I marvel that you are so
[57:33] soon removed from him that call you into
[57:35] the grace of Christ into another gospel.
[57:40] Paul leave them with full word. And Paul
[57:42] say he is marvel.
[57:44] They have a next gospel.
[57:48] Another preaching another teaching.
[57:51] My Lord, which is not another, but there
[57:54] be some that trouble you that would
[57:56] pervert the gospel of Christ. But though
[57:57] we, that's where Paul bust them. Paul's
[58:00] saying, I myself can bring a different
[58:03] revelation from what I already brought.
[58:05] He said, "Do we or angel of heaven
[58:08] preach any other gospel unto you? That
[58:11] which we have preached, let him be a
[58:13] cursed."
[58:16] Are we in the word this morning?
[58:20] [Applause]
[58:26] Jesus. Listen to Paul. As we have said
[58:29] before, so say I know again. Paul taking
[58:34] a hammer and nailing. He said, "If any
[58:37] man preach any other gospel unto you
[58:41] than you have received, let him be
[58:43] accursed."
[58:47] That's Paul, a messenger, a eye of God,
[58:52] a star of the age. That's Paul, Apostle
[58:55] Paul,
[59:00] Paul is the one who said, "Have you
[59:01] received the Holy Ghost since you
[59:02] believe?" Yes. Yes. If Paul come now in
[59:05] this age and he come to this message and
[59:08] Paul say, "Have you received the Holy
[59:09] Ghost since you believe?" You know
[59:11] response you get. Paul here what when
[59:15] you're taking the
[59:17] word. The seed is in the
[59:21] soul and you have to get a revelation of
[59:24] what's inside of you. And when you get
[59:27] that revelation, you'll understand that
[59:28] that seed in the Holy Ghost is the same
[59:30] thing.
[59:32] As long as it now watch something, it's
[59:34] the same Baptist doctrine but abandon
[59:36] fought in his time. The Baptist doctrine
[59:39] just gets steroids.
[59:42] The Baptist doctrine just get energized.
[59:44] It's the same Baptist doctrine. When you
[59:46] believe, you receive. He said, "Have you
[59:49] received since you believe by one
[59:52] spirit? You are baptized. Not not by one
[59:56] education. Not by one teaching. You are
[59:59] you are educated to come to a
[1:00:01] realization of who you are. That's yoga
[1:00:03] that that's Buddha that's eastern
[1:00:06] self-actualization and self-realization
[1:00:08] is that you don't know who you are. You
[1:00:10] go to a psychologist or psychiatrist and
[1:00:11] they kind of bring your head a little
[1:00:12] bit and thing your head a bit and play
[1:00:14] with you. Well, that happened your
[1:00:15] childhood will reverse that and think
[1:00:17] that little hypo thing and by the time
[1:00:19] your hand come you come out there and
[1:00:20] you're feeling better about yourself and
[1:00:22] they tell you things that you already
[1:00:23] know and they acknowledge it. Yeah.
[1:00:25] Yeah. That really happened. That really
[1:00:27] happened. That's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:28] That's not God coming down and the
[1:00:30] sealing in your heart and pulling the
[1:00:31] evil out of you. My God, the same way
[1:00:34] God treats the earth, he treats the
[1:00:35] individual. Baptizing water, come with
[1:00:38] the blood, come with the fire of the
[1:00:40] Holy Ghost to burn a supernatural
[1:00:42] experience. God war you come and walk
[1:00:44] into this like if you're walking into
[1:00:45] some dance or some kind of thing like
[1:00:47] that, you got to die. You got to wreck.
[1:00:50] You got to cry
[1:00:55] out. You may be seated. So when Jesus
[1:00:57] said blessed are they that hunger and
[1:00:59] thirst after righteousness they shall be
[1:01:01] filled. What are you talking about?
[1:01:03] Filled with what? Filled with the Holy
[1:01:04] Ghost. Filled with power and amen. God
[1:01:07] went to empower you. We all humans here.
[1:01:09] Five sensious people. But until God come
[1:01:11] and do something something inside of
[1:01:12] you, then you become a supernatural
[1:01:14] being.
[1:01:16] Inside of you have a seed in your soul.
[1:01:18] What do they tell the people? Well, the
[1:01:19] new is a revelation. That's fine.
[1:01:21] Prophet says that. Tell the people you
[1:01:23] could have the Holy Ghost and bapt Holy
[1:01:25] Ghost and be lost. You can write back on
[1:01:27] 24 hours a day. What they didn't say is
[1:01:29] body, spirit or soul. Where you have
[1:01:30] that? Come on. Mary say be it done to me
[1:01:34] according to your word. Amen. Sister
[1:01:37] tell me that. Mary said be it done unto
[1:01:39] me according to thy word. And Mary
[1:01:41] received the Holy Ghost. I say is that
[1:01:43] right? I said but I say Mary had the
[1:01:45] upper room. She said oh I never see it.
[1:01:51] Say Mary who said be it done unto me
[1:01:54] according to thy word had to go to the
[1:01:55] upper room to receive something and Mary
[1:01:59] had to be stripped of she Mary self
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:06] oh yes you didn't know that sister Mary
[1:02:09] she feeling good to be Mary you know
[1:02:13] mother of Jesus but I'm saying Mary had
[1:02:15] to lose herself yes she had to get rid
[1:02:17] of pride.
[1:02:19] Oh. Ouch. I hit I hit a nail. I hit I
[1:02:22] hit something there. You mean you you
[1:02:24] thought you want to keep your pride? Oh.
[1:02:26] Oh. No. No. You got to get rid of it.
[1:02:29] Yeah. That's why people need to humble
[1:02:31] themselves. People don't want to humble
[1:02:32] themselves. They want to keep
[1:02:33] themselves. God going to break you.
[1:02:37] Let me say God going to break you. If
[1:02:40] you're a daughter, son, or daughter of
[1:02:42] God, God going to break your spirit. God
[1:02:44] going to wreck your world.
[1:02:47] Oh hallelujah. Praise God. So get ready
[1:02:50] for some thunder, lightning, voices and
[1:02:52] earthquakes.
[1:02:54] Oh hallelujah. If you think things
[1:02:56] happening, it just start yet. Look how
[1:02:58] the amen disappear. That's I expected
[1:03:00] that. Oh God, say it again. Like Paul
[1:03:02] said, say hi then. Say hi again. Now if
[1:03:05] you think things happening, it start
[1:03:07] yet. But get ready. Get ready. It's
[1:03:09] coming. But there's going to be a people
[1:03:12] going to be ready for it. Glory to God.
[1:03:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:18] Glory to God. Look at a man running for
[1:03:21] president of America named Donald Trump.
[1:03:23] I want to love his name everywhere. He
[1:03:25] said he never asked God for forgiveness.
[1:03:26] He I can't remember ever ask God for he
[1:03:28] say he don't want to hear from God. He's
[1:03:29] a
[1:03:31] billionaire. And he said what I say I
[1:03:33] say. He don't depend upon people money.
[1:03:36] He have his own. So he's trouble all by
[1:03:39] himself. He don't need assistance. He is
[1:03:42] just he all what's wrong with America is
[1:03:44] a reflection is him bombastic. He's just
[1:03:47] he's just himself. I say that I say why
[1:03:49] why you say I said playing God.
[1:03:54] He don't know if he'll be alive next
[1:03:55] week. If he hard give out on him your
[1:03:58] own heart come and attack you. Yes. You
[1:04:00] don't even know. He don't know. But
[1:04:03] speaking bravely and boldly.
[1:04:06] You can't do that
[1:04:08] because you don't know where you're
[1:04:10] going to be next week. Next, you don't
[1:04:12] know
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:19] Paul. For do I not persuade men or God?
[1:04:22] Or do I seek to please men? Yet if I
[1:04:24] please men, I should not be a servant of
[1:04:25] Christ. But I certify you, brethren, I
[1:04:28] love that the gospel which was preached
[1:04:32] of me is not of man.
[1:04:34] For neither I receive it of man, neither
[1:04:36] was I taught it, but by revelation of
[1:04:39] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. This is Paul.
[1:04:41] Are you ready? Are we in the word? And
[1:04:45] when Peter came to Antioch, I stood him
[1:04:47] to the face.
[1:04:50] Because he was to be blamed. There are
[1:04:52] some people don't like to be blamed.
[1:04:55] Once you start to corner them, they
[1:04:57] start to make excuses.
[1:05:01] Paul said Peter was to be blamed.
[1:05:07] Hallelujah. In other words, Peter was
[1:05:10] responsible. Amen. Stop blaming. Accept
[1:05:14] responsibility for what you have done.
[1:05:18] For how you have acted, for how you have
[1:05:20] spoken. Don't blame anybody else.
[1:05:25] If they are wrong, you see where you are
[1:05:27] wrong and repent.
[1:05:29] And if they don't repent, that's up to
[1:05:31] them. God will deal with them. But take
[1:05:33] responsibility for your actions and
[1:05:35] attitudes. That's what the prodigal son
[1:05:37] said. I will arise. I will say to my
[1:05:39] father, I have sinned. Hallelujah. I no
[1:05:42] longer worthy to be called your son. Are
[1:05:44] you with me? Praise God. For before that
[1:05:48] certain s certain came from James, he
[1:05:50] did eat with the Gentiles. And when he
[1:05:52] they were come, he redrew and separated
[1:05:53] himself fearing them which were of
[1:05:56] circumcision. So he was catering to the
[1:05:58] legal people. The people wanted to keep
[1:06:00] the rules of the Jews. So the Galatian
[1:06:03] represent the legalistic church. Yeah,
[1:06:05] there are some people like licks.
[1:06:08] It's a kind of perverted sadistic kind
[1:06:10] of thing. They like people to rule over
[1:06:12] their lives. So they like the ministry
[1:06:14] and ministers that crack the whip. Yes.
[1:06:18] Yes.
[1:06:20] Yes. It's crazy. But it's true. I don't
[1:06:24] understand that. Why somebody with licks
[1:06:27] want to be in a straight jacket? Left
[1:06:28] turn, right? Don't buy that car. Don't
[1:06:32] buy that house. You should marry this
[1:06:34] one. Don't marry this one. Do this. Do
[1:06:36] this. Do this. And be yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:06:38] No
[1:06:39] sir. Church
[1:06:41] sir Galatian sir. You don't like it
[1:06:44] here. They have a Galatian
[1:06:48] church. And the pastor very nice guy.
[1:06:50] But he has let him have it. You could go
[1:06:52] there. Yes. Yes. Feel
[1:06:54] free. But we pressing for
[1:06:59] [Applause]
[1:07:01] Paul. Oh foolish Galatians who had
[1:07:05] bewitch you my God that you should not
[1:07:07] obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus
[1:07:10] Christ has heavenly set forth crucified
[1:07:12] among you. This only would I learn of
[1:07:14] you receiving the spirit by the works of
[1:07:16] the law or by the hearing of faith. Are
[1:07:17] you so foolish having begun in the
[1:07:20] spirit? You are not perfect by the
[1:07:22] flesh.
[1:07:23] Lord my who preaching Paul. Amen.
[1:07:28] Hallelujah. Glor. He that ministered to
[1:07:31] you the spirit and worked a miracle upon
[1:07:33] you. Do it he by the works of the law or
[1:07:34] by hearing of faith. Hallelujah. That's
[1:07:36] Galatians. Legalism. That's right. Then
[1:07:40] we come to
[1:07:43] Hebrews. Called of God, a high priest
[1:07:46] after the order of Mesazc of whom we
[1:07:48] have many things to say had to be
[1:07:50] uttered seeing that you are done of
[1:07:51] hearing. Paul busting them. These ones
[1:07:54] are the babies. They want permanent
[1:07:57] diapers, pampers. cuz you just had to
[1:07:58] buy boxes of
[1:08:00] that to
[1:08:02] change. He said, "For when the time you
[1:08:05] ought to be teachers, you have need that
[1:08:08] one teach you again which be the first
[1:08:11] principles of the oracles of God and
[1:08:13] have become such need of milk and not
[1:08:17] strong meat." That baby not growing at
[1:08:19] all.
[1:08:25] For everyone that useth milk is
[1:08:28] unskillful in the word of righteousness.
[1:08:31] Amen. For he is a babe.
[1:08:34] All right. Yes. So once you can't go on
[1:08:37] to the meat stage and you stay in the
[1:08:39] babe stage, you have to stay right
[1:08:41] there. Now here the problem with that.
[1:08:45] Even though you are a son.
[1:08:48] You are not a heir
[1:08:51] until you come to maturity.
[1:08:55] [Applause]
[1:08:58] So your father could have a billion
[1:09:00] dollars, but if you are 6 years old,
[1:09:02] nothing for you. A tricycle will do.
[1:09:10] Hallelujah. As long as you stay in baby,
[1:09:13] there is no power, there is no
[1:09:15] authority, there is no witness, there is
[1:09:17] no uncction, there is no breakthrough.
[1:09:19] That all you're supposed to be. As long
[1:09:22] as you remain a baby. Do you want that
[1:09:24] kind of church where everything is easy
[1:09:26] and smooth and everything soft and
[1:09:32] nice? Osterize the pumpkin and feed it
[1:09:36] by
[1:09:39] spoon. No meat, no turkey, no
[1:09:44] macaroni. Puri the
[1:09:47] banana. Call you a babe. Where come to
[1:09:50] Pirin and have a Hebrew
[1:09:53] church? That pastor very nice. He loves
[1:09:57] everybody. Glory to God. I am not
[1:10:00] catering. Let me tell you flat out. I am
[1:10:02] not catering for anybody inside of here.
[1:10:04] I'm not catering for your human spirit.
[1:10:06] I'm not I don't care who you are. I'm
[1:10:08] only catering for the word being
[1:10:11] ministered. We going to set the church
[1:10:13] in order.
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:20] Can I be seated?
[1:10:22] My responsibility is this church, not
[1:10:24] not anybody else. Not any this church.
[1:10:26] Amen. If people get blessed by
[1:10:28] connecting to us or hearing us or what
[1:10:30] not, be fine. We be happy with that. God
[1:10:32] bless them who want to receive it and
[1:10:33] whatn not because we are open. But this
[1:10:36] is my responsibility to press on for
[1:10:38] another Ephesians. I'm going to fight
[1:10:40] for it. I'm going to blast the
[1:10:42] Corinthian spirit. I'm going to smoke
[1:10:44] your hideout. Oh, glory to God. They
[1:10:46] think gas smoking for years. It coming.
[1:10:48] I come in loaded. Dynamite here, guns
[1:10:50] here, bombs here, missiles here. You
[1:10:52] walk in a pastor with full loaded. When
[1:10:54] I open my jacket like that, praise God.
[1:10:57] I shooting all sides. Bow and arrow,
[1:11:00] slingshot, you name it. Every weapon
[1:11:03] under heaven that's in the spirit realm,
[1:11:06] I'm going to come up with. We coming
[1:11:08] against demon powers, spiritual
[1:11:11] wickedness. Glory.
[1:11:16] Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] Glory.
[1:11:19] Praise God. Hallelujah. Here's why.
[1:11:23] Here's why we had to fight.
[1:11:27] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] Hallelujah.
[1:11:32] Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] My Lord.
[1:11:36] Judges
[1:11:37] 1:19. And the Lord was with
[1:11:40] Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants
[1:11:43] of the mountain, but could not drive out
[1:11:45] the inhabitants of the valley because
[1:11:47] they are chariots of iron.
[1:11:52] We can't follow Judah. Judah stick
[1:11:58] are the chars of iron. He was finished
[1:12:01] right there. Yes. The children of
[1:12:04] Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
[1:12:07] that inhabited Jerusalem. But the Jebite
[1:12:09] dwells with the children of Benjamin of
[1:12:11] his Jerusalem unto this
[1:12:14] day. Neither did Manise drive out the
[1:12:16] inhabitants of Benshin and her tongues,
[1:12:19] nor Tamash on her tongues, nor the
[1:12:21] inhabitants of Do and her
[1:12:23] tongues. If you don't drive them out,
[1:12:25] they will live with you.
[1:12:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:32] Amen. Amen. Let me back up a little bit.
[1:12:35] Verse 20. And they gave he unto Caleb as
[1:12:38] Moses said, for he expelled the three
[1:12:41] sons of Anoch.
[1:12:44] That's my role model.
[1:12:47] Caleb, not Judah, not Benjamin, not all
[1:12:51] them who stick and then drive up because
[1:12:53] God told them to drive them out. Not
[1:12:56] play salt with them, not have dinner
[1:12:58] with them. Drive them out.
[1:13:04] So all of you who are prepared to fight,
[1:13:06] you better start a fight because those
[1:13:08] different tribes represent Corinthians,
[1:13:11] Galatians, Hebrews, but not Ephesians.
[1:13:14] But Caleb, he is another Ephesians. Give
[1:13:17] the Lord some shout of praises because
[1:13:19] he know he pos his position.
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:25] Wonderful.
[1:13:29] Wonderful. My
[1:13:33] the bridge between denomination and
[1:13:35] glory land is an Ephesians bridge.
[1:13:38] Hallelujah. Are you going to walk out on
[1:13:41] that bridge? Hallelujah. But say
[1:13:42] redemption have two parts coming out of
[1:13:44] entering into. Isn't that right?
[1:13:46] Hallelujah. Now to preach Ephesians, we
[1:13:48] have to preach Joshua. Because Joshua is
[1:13:50] the book of Ephesians in the Old
[1:13:51] Testament. Amen. I love how God this
[1:13:53] this word is so beautiful. To preach
[1:13:55] Ephesians effectively, we had to go to
[1:13:57] Joshua because Joshua is the Ephesians
[1:13:59] of the Old Testament. And with Joshua,
[1:14:01] you understand about crossing Jordan.
[1:14:03] Isn't that right? And you have to fight.
[1:14:05] And every place you put your foot is
[1:14:07] yours. And some of you marking time
[1:14:09] inside of here. You're marking time to
[1:14:10] go forward or marking time to go back
[1:14:12] out.
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:15] I seen your face. I seen your body. I
[1:14:16] hearing some whisper of amen sometimes,
[1:14:18] but you're marking time because you have
[1:14:20] to begin to see progress in your life.
[1:14:23] in your life, not your head. A lot of
[1:14:25] people progress mightily inside their
[1:14:26] head. They could talk and talk and talk.
[1:14:29] We call it fellowshipping.
[1:14:32] But it's same thing as talk. Amen.
[1:14:42] Hallelujah. Let me just read a little
[1:14:44] further thing here from Ephesians 4. I
[1:14:47] stop at 13, but I want to go a little
[1:14:49] more that unto the measure of the
[1:14:52] fullness of Christ. Verse 14 says that
[1:14:53] we henceforth be no more children. See,
[1:14:56] see, see, you have to come out of that
[1:14:57] child thing.
[1:15:00] Hallelujah. When I was a child, I spake
[1:15:02] like a child. That's expected. I act
[1:15:04] like a child. I talk like a child. But
[1:15:06] when
[1:15:07] I became a man, I
[1:15:11] put away. Hallelujah. Not put away to
[1:15:14] become a man.
[1:15:16] Amen.
[1:15:17] You have some big men with child inside
[1:15:19] them. Immature. You have to put away
[1:15:22] your childish things. All right. So,
[1:15:24] here we go. Watch. Um, that we hence all
[1:15:28] be no more children tossed to and fro,
[1:15:30] carried about with every wind of
[1:15:31] doctrine by the slay of men and cunning
[1:15:33] craftiness whereby the lang to deceive,
[1:15:36] but speaking the truth in love. Here we
[1:15:38] go. May grow up into him in all things
[1:15:40] which is ahead, even Christ. Busy part I
[1:15:43] want to get to. from whom the whole body
[1:15:46] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:15:50] that which every joint supplieth
[1:15:53] according to Here we go. Here the
[1:15:55] objective according to the effectual
[1:15:58] working in the measure of every part.
[1:16:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:03] Amen.
[1:16:07] Effectual working. Amen. So the
[1:16:10] objective, why should God empower you
[1:16:12] and you're not ready to work? That's
[1:16:14] right.
[1:16:16] God empower you to fellowship.
[1:16:20] The body have a work to do. Amen. If
[1:16:22] your neck sprain, when you turn your
[1:16:25] neck, your whole body turning because
[1:16:28] your neck under strain. If your hands
[1:16:31] stiff, your your elbow stiff, you're
[1:16:33] walking like this. The body the body not
[1:16:35] functioning right. You're not feeling
[1:16:36] good because your neck stiff, your hands
[1:16:38] stiff. And when you're walking, you say
[1:16:40] hello. Hello. I call your shoulder. You
[1:16:42] know, but your shoulder moving because
[1:16:46] you're stiff up. Amen. Isn't that right?
[1:16:48] And if the bride body loose, if the
[1:16:51] bride body not working properly, when
[1:16:53] God call everything moving. So, you know
[1:16:54] what I mean? And God said, "But that's
[1:16:56] not what I want." You you marry a bride
[1:16:58] and the bride hand move like that and
[1:16:59] the bride walking stiff stiff stiff
[1:17:01] stiff stiff. You can imagine going to
[1:17:02] wedding then you're walking like this.
[1:17:07] M
[1:17:11] well the devil beat me up boy now I was
[1:17:13] stiff I got licks last
[1:17:15] night that bite on a strain God gave me
[1:17:18] smile what kind of pictures we get for
[1:17:19] your wedding day forget about it praise
[1:17:21] God want effectual
[1:17:25] working so God want to put you to work
[1:17:29] therefore God want you to find your
[1:17:31] position the object of this whole thing
[1:17:34] about seven thunders about inheritance
[1:17:36] about crossing Jordan is for you to get
[1:17:39] into your position. That is what it's
[1:17:41] all about. Because in your position, you
[1:17:43] have power. In your position, you have
[1:17:45] authority. In your position, you have
[1:17:47] your place. What place in Christ?
[1:17:50] Adoption time. That is what we fighting
[1:17:53] for. That is what this vision is all
[1:17:55] about. That is what Elisha saw. He saw a
[1:17:59] position that God was putting in for
[1:18:02] him. Give me a double portion. What did
[1:18:05] Caleb said? Give me my mountain.
[1:18:08] Oh, glory to God. He was asking for what
[1:18:11] he know belong to him.
[1:18:15] Amen. Hallelujah. We need a more
[1:18:18] aggressive type people. But you can't be
[1:18:20] in sin and aggressive. He wouldn't have
[1:18:22] the faith to move forward because you
[1:18:24] had to condemn you. And if a man asks
[1:18:27] without faith, he gets nothing. You
[1:18:30] can't ask wavering. You have to ask in
[1:18:32] full confidence. So there got to be
[1:18:35] nothing gay in your life. You have to be
[1:18:37] truly free.
[1:18:39] Come on, say amen, somebody.
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:45] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you. Hallelujah.
[1:18:48] Devil job is to keep you messed up
[1:18:54] and some of you like it
[1:18:57] because you see you in a
[1:18:59] system of your life. a system and you're
[1:19:02] not ready yet to give up your system. It
[1:19:04] fail. You know it fail cuz you failing
[1:19:06] with it too. Amen. Yes. So if it
[1:19:10] failing, why keep doing it? Hallelujah.
[1:19:13] Why keep accepting what to be what you
[1:19:16] in? Why not say let's turn this thing
[1:19:19] upside down? Let's flip this thing over.
[1:19:23] Yes. Let's challenge what we never
[1:19:24] challenged before. Amen. Challenge
[1:19:26] yourself. It's hard for us as a church
[1:19:28] here in Trinidad. what we do here
[1:19:30] because we have nobody to follow.
[1:19:35] And where we go, no other has gone
[1:19:36] before. I say it plainly.
[1:19:40] What we do, I don't know what others are
[1:19:42] doing, but what we doing is hard because
[1:19:44] now we see like, you know, oh, they
[1:19:46] doing that so we doing so. No, no, no.
[1:19:48] We are like pioneers.
[1:19:53] We are fighting for a promise. A promise
[1:19:55] of dynamics. People no longer believe
[1:19:58] dynamics because they feel they got it
[1:20:00] already. They don't know they got it to
[1:20:01] get. But we are pressing to a promise
[1:20:04] that God has made. Come on now. Come on
[1:20:06] now. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:20:11] Glory. Understand this. The call watch
[1:20:15] was not to come out of Egypt under
[1:20:17] Pharaoh's grip.
[1:20:19] That wasn't the object. Redemption is in
[1:20:21] two parts. coming out of and going into
[1:20:25] the call to come out as rejoicing as it
[1:20:28] is as relieved as you are from Pharaoh's
[1:20:31] whip
[1:20:33] and your duty under Pharaoh. Amen. As
[1:20:36] light and as nice you feel that's not
[1:20:38] the objective are free are free are free
[1:20:41] from Pharaoh. You sing special that's
[1:20:42] fine
[1:20:45] but that's not the objective to come
[1:20:47] out. Amen. The objective is to go in.
[1:20:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:52] God promised them Canaan land. Amen. And
[1:20:55] you would find out Canaan doesn't
[1:20:57] represent millennium. It represent war.
[1:21:01] But you know what glorious about it? It
[1:21:03] represent the age of the overcomer.
[1:21:06] Oh, I love that. I love that. That means
[1:21:08] Ephesians brings on the overcomers.
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:14] I talking when you leave service, it's
[1:21:15] had a high hand like that sword. Anytime
[1:21:17] you meet the devil, he getting all of
[1:21:18] that. You're slapping him left and right
[1:21:20] and left and right. That's what we're
[1:21:21] talking about. That is what it does.
[1:21:23] Because you have the whole armor of God,
[1:21:25] prospect of righteousness, the sword of
[1:21:27] the spirit, helmet of salvation. Come
[1:21:29] on, give the Lord a shout inside of you.
[1:21:35] [Applause]
[1:21:38] It's hard. Hallelujah. It's hard.
[1:21:41] Hallelujah. To do things others have
[1:21:43] never done. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:45] Hallelujah. That's it. I see churches
[1:21:47] relaxed. I see people happy with their
[1:21:49] pastor. They contend people have
[1:21:52] deciphering inside of here. I sorry for
[1:21:53] them. We have people in our church is
[1:21:55] real satisfied you know. Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] They cipher with everything.
[1:22:02] They don't even have to have Jesus.
[1:22:04] They have a building. They have a nice
[1:22:06] pastor. Handsome looking and everything
[1:22:08] else. Nice deacon and everybody nice.
[1:22:11] It's a nice place to go. Nice
[1:22:13] fellowship.
[1:22:15] Amen. Praise God. They love the pastor
[1:22:17] more than God. My God.
[1:22:19] They love the church more than God.
[1:22:21] Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] Christ is not in their hearts. The
[1:22:26] church is in their hearts. They're like
[1:22:28] nuns and priests. Hallelujah. Under the
[1:22:31] pope of Rome.
[1:22:34] The nuns not serving Jesus Christ. Yes,
[1:22:36] Lord. The nun sermon in Rome.
[1:22:39] The priest serving Rome. Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] He represent God to them. He is God to
[1:22:45] them. But we have no such gospel.
[1:22:47] There's another one.
[1:22:50] That's not what we preach. We preach you
[1:22:52] are kings and priests.
[1:22:55] We preach you have to press your way
[1:22:56] into the kingdom. We preach you can't
[1:22:59] say you love the pastor. Forget about
[1:23:01] it. Many love me and I love her too. I
[1:23:04] am not your husband. Come on, give God
[1:23:06] some
[1:23:07] praises. Glory to God. Your husband is
[1:23:09] Jesus Christ.
[1:23:11] Your husband is the revealed word. So
[1:23:14] when he preach the revealed word, you
[1:23:15] hear it from your husband.
[1:23:20] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh glory to
[1:23:24] God. Glory to God. This is not about
[1:23:27] what church you like. This is what God
[1:23:29] has spoken. The land had roared. Who can
[1:23:32] but fear? The Lord God had spoken. Who
[1:23:35] can but prophesy? And we have a prophecy
[1:23:38] that there's going to be another
[1:23:40] Ephesians. The bride must come into
[1:23:42] view.
[1:23:46] What bride? An Ephesians pride. Go
[1:23:50] ahead. No Galatians pride, no
[1:23:52] Corinthians pride, no Hebrew pride, but

[1:26:03] In Ephesians, we are predestinated unto
[1:26:05] adoption. In Ephesians, after you
[1:26:08] believe, you were sealed with the Holy
[1:26:10] Spirit of promise. In Ephesians, you are
[1:26:13] no longer strangers and foreigners, but
[1:26:15] fellow citizens with the saints and the
[1:26:18] household of God.

[1:26:28] and meekness, with longsuffering,
[1:26:30] forbearing one another in love,
[1:26:32] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:26:34] spirit in the bond of peace. There is
[1:26:35] one body in Ephesians, one spirit in
[1:26:38] Ephesians. There's one hope of your
[1:26:39] calling. Don't tell me some other group
[1:26:41] believes something different from what
[1:26:41] we believe. This is what they're
[1:26:43] supposed to believe because the whole
[1:26:44] mess is supposed to come back to this.
[1:26:47] It's supposed to straighten everything
[1:26:48] out and come back to one Lord, one
[1:26:49] faith, one baptism. How many don't like
[1:26:51] me? They don't like and contest. God is

[1:26:54] I'm preaching. There is going to be
[1:26:56] another Ephesians. One Lord, one faith,
[1:26:59] one baptism.
[1:27:05] That's against my faith. I don't see it.
[1:27:07] So until you see what kind of glasses
[1:27:09] you wear. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.

[1:28:02] want to be servants of God? Is that a
[1:28:05] servant? You I'm not talking about men,

[1:28:54] perfecting of the saints. If you ain't a
[1:28:56] saint that's not for you for the saints.
[1:28:58] That's why you have to live like a
[1:28:59] saint, act like a saint. It's for the
[1:29:01] perfecting of the sanctified ones.

[1:30:29] something different. Praise God. You
[1:30:31] could leave here thinking in your mind,
[1:30:33] it going to be different. I want it to

[1:30:37] is in your home. You could change that
[1:30:38] atmosphere because you say so. You
[1:30:40] believe so. You expect so. Yes, you
[1:30:43] could change it. You could leave it with
[1:30:44] some oil in your lamp. You could leave
[1:30:45] it with some oil in your spirit. You
[1:30:47] could leave yourself anointed with fire,
[1:30:49] with presence and power that when you
[1:30:50] walk into your home that demons and
[1:30:53] devils in your house begin to leave all
[1:30:56] now. So they say, "Get ready to pack up

[1:37:07] deliver. The Holy Spirit coming to give
[1:37:08] you a task to do. Amen. A job. A job to
[1:37:12] do. Moses brought them out. Joshua took
[1:37:13] them in. Moses was the man to bring them
[1:37:16] out. Joshua was the man to take them
[1:37:18] into the land. Joshua was old. I like
[1:37:20] that. Hallelujah. And God tell him,
[1:37:23] Joshua, you're old, but there is
[1:37:27] more land to be taken. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:37:30] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Say out loud,
[1:37:32] more land. More to be taken. Say it
[1:37:35] again. More land. More to be taken.
[1:37:39] We're not satisfied for books and tapes.
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:45] We are not satisfied to say God isn't a
[1:37:47] prophet.
[1:37:49] There's more land to be taken. Oh, glory
[1:37:53] to God. Is there a land of adoption?
[1:37:55] There's a land of perfection. Yes. There
[1:37:58] a land of spoken word. Yeah. The land of
[1:38:00] power over the element. Isn't that
[1:38:03] right? Power over the fish. Power to
[1:38:05] demonstrate the power of God. Signs,
[1:38:08] wonders, and miracles. There's more land
[1:38:09] to be taken. Why are you defeated in
[1:38:12] your own home? Why are you defeated in
[1:38:14] your own marriage? How come you're not
[1:38:16] seeing that land is yours? How come
[1:38:19] you're not seeing that devil have to
[1:38:20] come off your husband, come off your
[1:38:22] wife, come off your children? How come
[1:38:24] you're not seeing that?
[1:38:26] How come you're accepting this is how
[1:38:29] it's supposed to be? That's not true.
[1:38:39] That's not true. Amen. That's not true.
[1:38:43] One time you know the story tell the
[1:38:45] book of Joshua they tell some man they
[1:38:47] fighting. They say we're going to take
[1:38:48] that man head off. We want food. I'm
[1:38:50] retired. The man say you know food or
[1:38:54] whatn not and and like if you know you
[1:38:56] going to take it he want to come back
[1:38:57] and put licks on you. Them fellas went
[1:38:59] and take off and take that country. You
[1:39:01] know these guys wasn't studying their
[1:39:03] army strength and numbers. You know all
[1:39:06] they were considering is what God said.
[1:39:07] Amen. God told Joshua, let's go back at
[1:39:09] that. God told Joshua, "Every place,
[1:39:13] you put your foot is yours." God told
[1:39:17] Joshua, "No man
[1:39:19] shall be able to stand before thee all
[1:39:22] the days of thy life
[1:39:25] as I was with Moses. I will be with
[1:39:27] you." Hallelujah. I will not fail thee.
[1:39:30] Nor forsake thee. Only one thing I want.
[1:39:33] Stop studying other people
[1:39:35] interpretation.
[1:39:36] Meditate on the word that the prophet
[1:39:39] brought day and night.
[1:39:43] I am not hearing you. Don't put your own
[1:39:46] idea to what the just take the word and
[1:39:48] meditate on a day and night in order to
[1:39:50] have good success. Not success but good
[1:39:54] success. God want us to be more
[1:39:56] successful successful than success. He
[1:39:58] want good success. Oh yeah. He want your
[1:40:01] cup to run over. Hallelujah. Some of you
[1:40:05] so mean. You just want a little thing in
[1:40:07] your cup. God want your cup. Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] Hallelujah. I just loving it. Praise
[1:40:15] God. You see God filter in filtering
[1:40:18] out. Filtering out the Hebrew spirit.
[1:40:20] Filter out the Galatian spirit. Filter
[1:40:22] out the Corinthian spirit and bring on
[1:40:24] Ephesians spirit. You saw God filtered
[1:40:26] down with with with with um with with
[1:40:28] Gideon. Isn't that right? All of them
[1:40:30] who just gone in the water and dive in
[1:40:32] the water the feelings at the
[1:40:33] beach that no burden all the studies the
[1:40:36] self they die head fall first
[1:40:40] but 300 of them was looking like a
[1:40:44] dog licking the water and they're
[1:40:47] looking out
[1:40:49] looking out for the enemy. You're
[1:40:51] drinking, but don't drink stupid.
[1:40:55] Drinking like if just you and you alone
[1:40:57] and you going through.
[1:41:00] Drink and look. Watch and pray. Drink
[1:41:04] and be on your guard. Eat and watch.
[1:41:07] Rejoice and watch. Don't rejoice. I give
[1:41:11] the devil. It's only for a season. He
[1:41:12] going
[1:41:14] for say amen on that one. The devil left
[1:41:17] Jesus for a season, you know. Yeah.
[1:41:19] Devil take a break sometimes. He tired
[1:41:22] haunt you. He had to go by someplace
[1:41:24] else. God tell me where you are. He said
[1:41:26] to and fro upon the earth. When he leave
[1:41:29] you, he going through. Afterwards, he
[1:41:31] coming through. Let him when he going
[1:41:33] through, you better rejoice. Stuck up
[1:41:35] with ammunition. Get your bums. Get your
[1:41:39] get
[1:41:40] your build up your
[1:41:42] fortification. He going through. Next
[1:41:45] time he coming too, straight to you. Oh,
[1:41:48] give the Lord some praises people. But
[1:41:51] we understand his tactics. We understand
[1:41:54] his tricks. That is why we going to
[1:41:56] overcome. Every age the devil like
[1:41:59] tricks. Every age the overcomers
[1:42:01] overcame. Oh, glory to God. Alpha and
[1:42:04] Omega. The first bride and the last
[1:42:06] bride, the same bride. Glory. I feel
[1:42:09] good this morning. Are you with me? You
[1:42:12] may be seated. The early church, they
[1:42:14] were adopted. Amen. That fire in the
[1:42:16] spirit, soul, body, mechanics was
[1:42:18] quickened by the Holy Ghost. But they
[1:42:20] didn't live long enough to go in the
[1:42:22] rapture. That's right. They have to go
[1:42:23] down in the ground. Amen. But we we
[1:42:26] going back and pick up what they had.
[1:42:27] Amen. Quick and power going to be all
[1:42:29] over you in your hands too in your
[1:42:32] tongues. Oh, glory God. Off your body.
[1:42:35] Oh, glory to God. It take curt off body.
[1:42:37] And the anointing was upon the curtains.
[1:42:39] Oh, hallelujah. Anointing everywhere.
[1:42:42] They preached long nights. And when that
[1:42:44] man fell dead in church, Paul just
[1:42:47] raised him from the dead and continue
[1:42:49] preaching. That's another Ephesians.
[1:42:52] Come on now. That's another
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:58] Ephesians. You see it? Now somebody fall
[1:43:02] dead. They call the bat cemetery. They
[1:43:04] call the funeral home. But in Paul age,
[1:43:07] he wasn't called a funeral home. Paul
[1:43:09] raised the dead and continued preaching.
[1:43:10] Amen. Oh my. What kind of church that
[1:43:12] was? Do you want that that kind of
[1:43:14] church? I I want to belong to at that
[1:43:16] kind of church that the dead can't stay
[1:43:18] dead. The backsliders can't stay back.
[1:43:21] Something going to pull you. Something
[1:43:22] going to pull you. Something going to
[1:43:25] pull you. Go. God could pull you out.
[1:43:27] Like Isaac preached when he called
[1:43:29] Lazarus from the grave. He was still
[1:43:30] wrapped in grave clothes. So he had to
[1:43:32] come out like this. He out. He out. He
[1:43:35] out from his darkness. He out from
[1:43:36] death, but he he still he's still tied
[1:43:38] up. You You could come out and still
[1:43:39] tied up. We're going to untie you. We're
[1:43:41] going to unwrap you. We're going to
[1:43:42] unravel you. That's what we are here
[1:43:44] for. I came to break the spirit off of
[1:43:46] your life. I have the authority to do
[1:43:48] that. Come on, say amen, somebody. We
[1:43:50] got the authority to do that. Glory to
[1:43:53] God. You can't deliver yourself, but we
[1:43:55] have a word. We have an authority and we
[1:43:59] have a power behind this word. Oh, give
[1:44:01] the Lord some praises,
[1:44:03] people. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:07] Hallelujah.
[1:44:09] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] Let me say it. Brother Baron said uh
[1:44:13] Bible Ephesians let no corrupt
[1:44:15] communication proceed out of your mouth.
[1:44:17] Amen. Amen. You can't talk like a
[1:44:20] Jezebel. You can't talk like your mouth
[1:44:22] to talk. You have somewhere between your
[1:44:24] nose and your mouth and and ching.
[1:44:25] You're just talking just open your mouth
[1:44:26] and saying welcome to your mouth. No.
[1:44:29] Talk like a talk like a saint.
[1:44:32] Talk like a Christian. Be kind,
[1:44:35] tender-hearted, be patient. Isn't that
[1:44:38] right? and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:44:39] God, whereby you are sealed until the
[1:44:41] day of redemption. Let all bitterness
[1:44:43] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:44:45] speaking be put away from you. Be kind
[1:44:47] one to another, tender-hearted,
[1:44:49] forgiving one another, even as God for
[1:44:51] Christ's sake had forgiven you. Let no
[1:44:53] foul or polluting language. This is in
[1:44:55] the amplified. Let no foul or pollutant
[1:44:58] language or evil word, nor unh wholesome
[1:45:00] or worthless talk ever come out your
[1:45:03] mouth, but only such speech as is good
[1:45:05] and beneficial to the spiritual progress
[1:45:07] of others.
[1:45:09] Hallelujah. If you're texting, don't
[1:45:11] text foolishness. Text something that
[1:45:12] will edify and build up somebody. You're
[1:45:15] going to write something on Facebook.
[1:45:16] Write something that will edify and
[1:45:18] build somebody, not something that say,
[1:45:20] "Ouch."
[1:45:22] Hallelujah. What is this? Don't do that.
[1:45:28] Do not grieve the Holy Spirit. Do not
[1:45:30] offend or vex or sadden him. This is the
[1:45:32] amplified. Of whom you are sealed, mark,
[1:45:34] branded of God's own secured for the day
[1:45:36] of redemption. Let all bitterness,
[1:45:38] indignation, and wrath, passion, rage,
[1:45:40] and bad temper, resentment, anger,
[1:45:42] animosity, and quality. Paul is speaking
[1:45:45] to the church.
[1:45:48] Christians have that body. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:45:51] Brawling, clamor, contention, slander,
[1:45:53] evil. speaking abusive, blasphemous
[1:45:56] language be banished from you with all
[1:45:57] malice, spite, ill will, or basis of any
[1:46:00] kind. Become useful and helpful and kind
[1:46:02] to one another. Tender-hearted,
[1:46:04] compassionate, understanding, loving,
[1:46:06] kind, and so forth. Amen. Oh,
[1:46:08] hallelujah. Turn away your parents and
[1:46:10] fathers. Don't provoke your children to
[1:46:12] rat, but bring them up in the fear and
[1:46:14] admission of God. Finally, my brethren,
[1:46:16] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[1:46:19] of his might. Put on the whole armor of
[1:46:22] God that you may be able to stand
[1:46:23] against the ws of the devil. For we r
[1:46:25] not against flesh and blood, but against
[1:46:27] principalities and spirit, against
[1:46:29] powers, against rulers of the darkness
[1:46:30] of this world, against spiritual
[1:46:31] wickedness in high places. So friends,
[1:46:33] that is a synopsis of what Ephesians is.
[1:46:36] So now you understand what you don't
[1:46:37] want. You don't want Galatians. You
[1:46:38] don't want Corinthians. You don't want
[1:46:40] Hebrews. You want a perfect church.
[1:46:42] Amen. You want not Jacob grace. You want
[1:46:44] Joseph perfection. The capstone word
[1:46:47] manifested. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. That
[1:46:50] is what you want. You want chosen
[1:46:52] perfection, the capstone word manifested
[1:46:54] among us in your heart in your life. You
[1:46:58] want a thirst for perfection, not
[1:47:00] excuses. Well, forgive. Well, and
[1:47:03] somebody come with some foolish excuse.
[1:47:05] We don't want no excuses. It's either
[1:47:07] you're fighting or you're not fighting.
[1:47:09] Either you're going forward or going
[1:47:10] backward. Are you pressing or you're not
[1:47:11] pressing? No excuses. Oh, glory to God.
[1:47:14] Some bron wanted to be at the border.
[1:47:15] And Joshua say listen to fight than they
[1:47:17] want to go by border go by the border.
[1:47:18] Some people like to live at the border.
[1:47:19] Just where the world is, they want to be
[1:47:20] right there as close as possible.
[1:47:24] There are people who have more friends
[1:47:25] in the world than in church. That is
[1:47:27] their choice because they have problems
[1:47:29] with brethren. There's always problem
[1:47:31] that say last week, let's fight.
[1:47:35] I just love that. Let's fight. But after
[1:47:39] we fight, we are family. What we
[1:47:41] fighting for? Fighting for what's right.
[1:47:43] Amen. Oh, glory to God. Isn't that
[1:47:45] right? Because if we get it right, no
[1:47:47] sick is coming here and going to leave
[1:47:48] you sick.
[1:47:51] [Applause]
[1:47:53] Nobody come here b leave you here bound.
[1:47:56] When they walk in the building, the
[1:47:57] anointing is flowing back and forth.
[1:47:59] There was a time brother Brandon walked
[1:48:00] into the pulpit and cripples had to come
[1:48:02] out the wheelchair. He said the angel
[1:48:04] was present. He didn't have to speak a
[1:48:05] word. The anointing came in and
[1:48:07] everything changed. Oh, glory to God.
[1:48:10] It's going to change for your life if
[1:48:11] you believe it. I don't care what you
[1:48:13] have been in. God can deliver you. I
[1:48:16] could drop a big question on you right
[1:48:18] now. Is anything too hard for God? It
[1:48:21] means changing your mind.
[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:28] But what happened to this message so
[1:48:30] back right now? They don't even believe
[1:48:31] in miracles.
[1:48:34] People don't believe in miracles. They
[1:48:35] don't believe in miracles. They don't
[1:48:36] believe that God is able to change and
[1:48:38] transform the situation around them. My
[1:48:41] God. One time some lepers was in a
[1:48:42] building inside Israel. Yeah. Elijah
[1:48:45] make a prophecy about what was going to
[1:48:46] take place and those lepers call it
[1:48:48] dingy fate. A fate based upon reason.
[1:48:50] They say if we stay here we will die. If
[1:48:52] we go out to the enemy we will die.
[1:48:54] These are lepers. They hungry. They say
[1:48:56] you know what? Let's go out. We could
[1:48:58] die here or we could die there. We
[1:48:59] choose to die outside looking for food.
[1:49:03] And when them fellas step out, God
[1:49:04] caused some thunder and some lightning
[1:49:06] and some rumblings and the enemy dropped
[1:49:08] everything and run.
[1:49:12] Because the Lord was working for them.
[1:49:14] And when them guys got to the camp, they
[1:49:16] seen food, they seen gold, everything
[1:49:18] was theirs. They had a good feast. They
[1:49:22] swing on the hammock. Then they said,
[1:49:23] "This is not
[1:49:25] right." The whole village down there
[1:49:27] starving. Let me go and tell them.
[1:49:32] That's how they went to get the report.
[1:49:33] Food,
[1:49:35] dingy fate. All God waiting for somebody
[1:49:39] to step out. Amen. People like safety
[1:49:42] thing. Safe. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:49:46] You're safe. You have two friends. God
[1:49:48] bless you. God bless you. Punch your
[1:49:49] start and go
[1:49:52] home. After service, the same two
[1:49:54] people. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:49:56] Punk start. Go home. You're safe. The
[1:50:00] friends like you. You like them.
[1:50:04] That is my friend.
[1:50:08] Jesus boss his own disciples. He said
[1:50:10] you can't love your own. Hallelujah. The
[1:50:13] Pharisees love their own too. Everybody
[1:50:15] have their particular friend. He said
[1:50:16] you have to love those that hate you,
[1:50:18] don't like you. Amen. Amen. Amen. How
[1:50:22] you going find them?
[1:50:25] There are people who disagree with you.
[1:50:26] Some people have problems with you and
[1:50:29] you have to show love. Give them a good
[1:50:31] hug. Amen. A good greeting and let the
[1:50:35] love vibrate from your spirit in your
[1:50:36] heart. Not
[1:50:40] not that not that kind of hunger. That's
[1:50:42] just a physical thing. We're not talking
[1:50:44] about that. We talking about something
[1:50:46] from within.
[1:50:48] Isn't that right? Hallelujah. Are we in
[1:50:50] the word? Glory. Hallelujah. You got to
[1:50:54] press on. You got to do something
[1:50:56] different. You got to extend yourself.
[1:50:59] H. You got to stretch. They say when
[1:51:02] people building muscles and they're
[1:51:03] lifting iron, you can't just lift the
[1:51:04] same iron every time.
[1:51:06] You're not building any muscles. You're
[1:51:08] you're breaking a
[1:51:10] sweat. When you want to bring the
[1:51:12] muscles, you have to lift higher and
[1:51:13] higher and and and more heavy and so on
[1:51:15] to strain and pull and pump. I don't
[1:51:18] lift iron. I just taking a report. This
[1:51:20] is just pure information purposes. I
[1:51:23] have no such revelation. I'm not into
[1:51:24] into that. But this is what I understand
[1:51:27] must be done. So if you have to get
[1:51:29] muscles of faith,
[1:51:36] You have to begin to exercise it and
[1:51:39] stretch. You got just have faith just to
[1:51:42] bounce your start and come to church.
[1:51:43] That's why you do it for years.
[1:51:45] Hallelujah.
[1:51:47] But when you start to say, "Wait a
[1:51:48] minute. Are you going to have a
[1:51:49] revival?" You know, it's starting here
[1:51:51] right now. And I taking it back home and
[1:51:53] I'm going to drop it up on my family.
[1:51:56] Come on now. that that that is
[1:51:57] stretching a little bit because you
[1:51:59] can't stay that and go home and do
[1:52:01] normal things. You have to go and check
[1:52:02] the family now. Say what going on? I
[1:52:04] come to pray for you. Are you ready? Oh
[1:52:07] hallelujah. They say what's wrong with
[1:52:09] daddy boy? What wrong with me brother?
[1:52:11] What wrong with me sister? You start to
[1:52:12] take charge. Hallelujah. You're
[1:52:15] stretching your faith. You walk inside
[1:52:17] the house and say I come to claim this
[1:52:19] place for the kingdom of God. The blood
[1:52:21] of Jesus is against you, Satan. My God.
[1:52:24] Hallelujah. You start to call out a work
[1:52:26] of darkness. All them demons hiding in
[1:52:29] the cupboard, in the kitchen, in the
[1:52:31] bedroom, wherever those demons are, they
[1:52:33] start to wake up and wipe their eye and
[1:52:35] say, "Let's get out of here." It look
[1:52:37] like somebody with rank.
[1:52:40] Somebody with authority, somebody with
[1:52:43] some kind of authority walk inside of
[1:52:45] the house. We got to get
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:50] out. Glory. Glory. Glory. You have to
[1:52:54] understand how it work in the spirit
[1:52:56] realm. When those sons of skia wanted to
[1:52:58] get power like the Ephesians church to
[1:53:01] cast out devils and they come and see
[1:53:04] some devils and they want to cast them
[1:53:06] out. Come on devil in the name of Paul.
[1:53:08] Jesus that Paul
[1:53:09] preach they don't have faith to preach
[1:53:11] the but they claiming faith. Paul
[1:53:14] preached the devil tell them Paul I
[1:53:16] know. Hallelujah. Peter I know. Who are
[1:53:19] you? Yes. And they jump on them.
[1:53:23] You don't play with that. Oh,
[1:53:25] hallelujah. So those demons know Paul.
[1:53:29] Those demons know Peter. Those guys had
[1:53:31] rank. That is another Ephesians. Those
[1:53:34] guys had authority. That is another
[1:53:36] Ephesians. When they walk, demons
[1:53:39] scatter. I'm not hearing you. Praise
[1:53:42] God. It come like you a teacher. When
[1:53:43] you go in that classroom, all kind of
[1:53:45] demons upon them children. But when you
[1:53:47] see a get empowered and you walk into
[1:53:49] that classroom, them demons under
[1:53:51] arrest.
[1:53:52] because you claim that whole thing on
[1:53:55] your job. You have to do that. You have
[1:53:57] to ask God protection and covering. You
[1:53:59] can't just walk. People come with demons
[1:54:01] and no witchcraft, all kind of evil
[1:54:03] powers on the job. You can't walk
[1:54:05] unprotected. You have to walk with the
[1:54:07] armor of good. That's what we are
[1:54:10] talking about. It's a war.
[1:54:18] Oh, glory to God. You don't walk with a
[1:54:20] protection. Somebody threw some spirit
[1:54:22] upon you. You come home, that spirit
[1:54:23] upon you. You act up in your own home.
[1:54:25] You don't even know why you're acting
[1:54:26] like that. Some demon upon you because
[1:54:28] you pick it up somewhere along the way
[1:54:29] without even understanding the warfare
[1:54:31] that's going on. Church is not a game.
[1:54:33] Church is not playing. A demon wasn't
[1:54:35] playing. The devil wasn't playing
[1:54:36] because the the the serpent was so close
[1:54:39] to man. The devil opportunity to inject
[1:54:41] himself into man because of that very
[1:54:43] serpent was so close to man. So Lucifer
[1:54:46] drop into the serpent and go and
[1:54:48] interfere with Eve that he could inject
[1:54:49] himself and bring a different race of
[1:54:51] people on the earth. It's a seed that's
[1:54:53] on the earth belong to the devil, they
[1:54:55] could never be saved. Oh, glory to God.
[1:54:58] Hallelujah. Didn't name not in the land
[1:55:00] book of life. But you are privileged
[1:55:02] this morning to know that before the
[1:55:03] foundation of the world, God put your
[1:55:05] name in the lamb's book of
[1:55:09] life. Glory to God. You might be broken,
[1:55:12] but you're still a son. You might be
[1:55:13] defeated, but you are still a daughter.
[1:55:15] You might be flat out, but you are still
[1:55:17] a son. You might be wounded, but you are
[1:55:19] still a son and daughter of God. Oh,
[1:55:21] glory to God. You still have something
[1:55:22] to shout about. You still have something
[1:55:24] to praise God about.
[1:55:31] Are Ephesians church?
[1:55:34] Do you see her? Yes, sir. Do you see it?
[1:55:37] Amen. Do you see how easy to belong to
[1:55:39] any church, any group? Hallelujah. and
[1:55:41] not still miss the Ephesians mark. Oh,
[1:55:43] hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Praise the
[1:55:46] name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:55:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:50] Brother Brandham says, watch, we are
[1:55:51] promised according to Revelation 10
[1:55:53] according to Malachi 4, St. Luke 17:30
[1:55:56] that there's going to come an Ephesians
[1:55:58] to this. There's a promise, friends.
[1:56:00] There must come an Ephesians that
[1:56:04] sevenfold mysteries of the word must be
[1:56:06] unfolded. And it's in the loud decent
[1:56:09] age in which it takes place. The prophet
[1:56:11] said it himself. He didn't promise no
[1:56:13] Pentecostal church. He didn't promise no
[1:56:16] a Corinthians church or or Galatians
[1:56:18] church or Hebrew church. He promised
[1:56:19] another Ephesians. That is promised in
[1:56:22] this age. What's Laudisia? Cold, formal,
[1:56:25] lukewarm and so on. Have need of
[1:56:27] nothing. A rich church. They figure
[1:56:29] everything is fine. But they don't know
[1:56:30] the wretched, miserable, naked, and
[1:56:32] porn. They don't know it. That's that
[1:56:33] that's outia. But Ephesians is what I
[1:56:35] preach to you. Amen. Ephesians is that
[1:56:38] bridge to take you over to glory land.
[1:56:41] We have to cross over to glory and
[1:56:42] Ephesians is that bridge. That's the
[1:56:44] only bridge that God have. The rest is
[1:56:46] filthy church ages. Filthy church.
[1:56:49] That's what he saw in the vision. Isn't
[1:56:50] that right? So watch. He said therefore
[1:56:53] he said I think we are living in
[1:56:55] Ephesians again. Now in the last days we
[1:56:57] are given the understanding by the word
[1:56:59] that we are going to understand it
[1:57:01] because there will come an Ephesians age
[1:57:03] to it. And now how much more you promise
[1:57:06] by believing in the Bible to this very
[1:57:08] age. We are living the Ephesians age
[1:57:10] again. We have got seven church age and
[1:57:13] we are promised. You see it again that
[1:57:14] at the loud recent church age there
[1:57:16] would be another Ephesians.
[1:57:19] Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] That is the expectation.
[1:57:24] Glory. Glory. Another what? Ephesians.
[1:57:28] Ephesians. No excuses. Well, we have
[1:57:32] seen it. So how you seeing it is what
[1:57:35] the prophet said. Amen.
[1:57:39] Even when we come to the end, watch the
[1:57:41] last message is supposed to straighten
[1:57:43] that all up to bring these things to one
[1:57:45] Lord, one faith, one baptism. What is
[1:57:48] that? Another Ephesians. Oh, praise the
[1:57:50] name of the Lord. Praise be to Jesus.
[1:57:52] Hallelujah. And then he said, we said
[1:57:54] this last week, the hidden mysteries of
[1:57:56] Revelation 10:1-7, the last message to
[1:57:58] the last church, which is seven
[1:58:00] thunders. Isn't that right? Then he
[1:58:02] said, "Now you see what coming to the
[1:58:03] Jordan meant. We are all down here now.
[1:58:05] Let's cross over now. Let's quit
[1:58:07] playing. Let's cross to the other side
[1:58:09] now cuz it all belongs to us. It's all
[1:58:11] ours." Them visions never fail. They
[1:58:13] can't fail because they come from God.
[1:58:15] And I believe it with all that's within
[1:58:17] me. We are not the Harland that will run
[1:58:19] back into the wilderness. We will cross
[1:58:21] Jordan. The separation. God break to us
[1:58:24] the seals that's on the back of the
[1:58:25] book. Let us enter into this great
[1:58:28] place. Now, this is
[1:58:30] 1964 paradox. This is after the seven
[1:58:33] seals was opened. He's saying, "God,
[1:58:36] break to us the seals in the back of the
[1:58:37] book." That's the seven seal. That's the
[1:58:39] seven thunders. He's asking for the
[1:58:41] seven thunders. Listen. Watch. Watch
[1:58:43] that. Watch. Let us enter into this
[1:58:45] great place now. For Joshua divided to
[1:58:47] the people the inheritance that God has
[1:58:49] left for them. Oh, hallelujah. God
[1:58:51] requires a Jordan in every life. God
[1:58:54] requires a Jordan in every life. There
[1:58:56] must be things to kill you. There must
[1:58:58] be things to pain you. There must be
[1:58:59] things to hurt you as it was. To break
[1:59:01] your human spirit. The object is to
[1:59:04] break your spirit. Oh, hallelujah. To
[1:59:06] keep you alive in your flesh, but to
[1:59:09] make you die out. That you could come
[1:59:11] alive in the spirit. That you could be
[1:59:13] strengthening the inner man as a son, as
[1:59:15] a daughter of God. So he bring
[1:59:16] heartaches, he bring pain, he brings
[1:59:18] mind battle for you to die out. Oh,
[1:59:21] glory to God. Hallelujah. One time there
[1:59:23] was a sister. Oh, glory to God. have a
[1:59:25] husband who was a worldly person and she
[1:59:28] was a Christian. She wasn't just a
[1:59:30] message believer. She was a Christian.
[1:59:32] She wasn't just a church member. She was
[1:59:34] a Christian. And at the time he brought
[1:59:36] some friends home and they begin she
[1:59:38] begin to serve them things to drink and
[1:59:40] to eat and they let it fall in the
[1:59:41] ground and keep making mess on the
[1:59:43] ground and throwing it down and whatnot.
[1:59:44] And she would clean it up and treat them
[1:59:46] kindly and nice and so forth. And the
[1:59:48] husband tell the friends, "You see, you
[1:59:50] see, I tell you, she's a Christian."
[1:59:52] Amen.
[1:59:54] Amen. I tell you she's a Christian.
[1:59:56] Amen. What if she had take the weight
[1:59:58] and bang it on the head and say, "This
[2:00:00] is my house. I ain't taking no nonsense
[2:00:01] or nobody come to bring no man inside
[2:00:03] here to wreck up my house and nasty at
[2:00:05] my house and what and take a broom and
[2:00:06] run them out."
[2:00:09] What was that man testimony? Sorry
[2:00:11] fellas, I thought she was a Christian.
[2:00:14] Hallelujah. But she lived something.
[2:00:20] What What hidden mystery that was?
[2:00:25] That was Christ. That was the spirit.
[2:00:27] Hallelujah. That's what have to be seen.
[2:00:29] Could we go over? Yes, sir. Could we go
[2:00:31] further? And the church organization,
[2:00:33] denomination has failed and they will
[2:00:35] not take the church over. God will raise
[2:00:37] up a new system and denominational
[2:00:39] system by the power of God that will
[2:00:41] take the church into the promised land.
[2:00:43] Organization and denomination has messed
[2:00:45] it up. Each one after their own
[2:00:46] theology, each one after their own
[2:00:48] thinking. But God will take his Holy
[2:00:50] Spirit. We raise up his Joshua that will
[2:00:52] take the church to the promise with no
[2:00:55] denominational strings tied anywhere.
[2:00:59] So listen, we know that there's a land
[2:01:00] somewhere. Isn't that right? There's a
[2:01:02] power somewhere and we are trying to go
[2:01:04] into that promised land. Isn't that
[2:01:06] right? Joshua knew that land. Praise be
[2:01:09] to Jesus. And he said, "Now when we went
[2:01:11] to the river, it divides us. It
[2:01:13] separates us. Once on the other side,
[2:01:17] something happens to you." Isn't that
[2:01:19] right? Hallelujah. So the first stage is
[2:01:21] to come out. The second stage is
[2:01:22] sanification through the blood that
[2:01:24] kills all the human desires of evil.
[2:01:25] That's the second stage of the journey.
[2:01:27] But the third stage is when they cross
[2:01:29] Jordan into the promised land where the
[2:01:32] inheritance laid. The inheritance never
[2:01:35] laid in Egypt though God blessed them in
[2:01:37] Egypt. Isn't that right? The inheritance
[2:01:39] lay where? In the promised land. And
[2:01:42] what is between you and the promised
[2:01:43] land? Jordan. What is between you and
[2:01:45] the promised land? What is between you
[2:01:47] and the promised land? Where's your
[2:01:49] inheritance? Across Jordan. So you got
[2:01:51] to cross Jordan. Isn't that right? Oh,
[2:01:53] praise the name of the Lord. Do you
[2:01:55] believe that? Blessed be the name of the
[2:01:57] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now,
[2:01:59] Canaan land, watch the book of
[2:02:02] Ephesians, this from adoption. All
[2:02:04] right. Let me see where I'm at here now.
[2:02:06] All right. Settling your belts now. If
[2:02:10] you haven't put on your seat belts, put
[2:02:11] it
[2:02:12] on cuz we're about to ride. Yes. You
[2:02:16] thought we was going to stop the car and
[2:02:18] let you out? No. Let's say buckle on
[2:02:20] your seat belts. All right. Now, the
[2:02:22] book of Ephesians I was saying is one of
[2:02:24] the greatest books of the New Testament.
[2:02:26] The book of Ephesians draws it and
[2:02:28] positionally places the church. Now,
[2:02:31] Israel was brought up of Egypt and there
[2:02:33] are three stages. One stage is leaving
[2:02:35] Egypt. Next stage is wilderness. Third
[2:02:37] stage was Canaan. So, Canaan does not
[2:02:40] represent the age of the millennium. It
[2:02:41] only represent the age of the overcomer.
[2:02:44] the dispensation of overcoming. So I
[2:02:46] expect your testimony of overcoming
[2:02:48] after this service and going far
[2:02:51] testimonies. Oh now catch it now. See
[2:02:54] now get the victory. Hallelujah. Now see
[2:02:56] what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm
[2:02:58] supposed to be overcoming. Isn't that
[2:03:00] right? Hallelujah. Now watch. Because
[2:03:02] Canaan they killed and burned and took
[2:03:04] cities. There's no debt in the
[2:03:06] millennium. Watch another thing it does.
[2:03:09] It brings up justification by faith
[2:03:10] after they believe in Moses left Egypt.
[2:03:13] sanification truth under the pillar of
[2:03:15] fire and the atonement of the
[2:03:16] sacrificial lamb. Then enter into the
[2:03:19] land that had been promised that had
[2:03:22] been promised. Promised. Now what is the
[2:03:26] land promised to the New Testament
[2:03:27] believer? Question. Brother Abraham
[2:03:29] answers the promise is the Holy Spirit.
[2:03:35] Say it after me. The promise is the Holy
[2:03:38] Spirit. So the Holy Spirit is the
[2:03:41] promise. So all the journey is to take
[2:03:43] us to the Holy Spirit. All the mysteries
[2:03:48] have to take us to the Holy Spirit. All
[2:03:51] the revelations have to take us to the
[2:03:54] Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit is
[2:03:56] the land of promise. We don't have the
[2:03:59] pyramid here. But after brotherly
[2:04:01] kindness, there's a slot. Hallelujah.
[2:04:03] And that slot marks what? Holy Spirit.
[2:04:06] on top that splut my LOV that's Christ's
[2:04:09] corporate body but beneath that is his
[2:04:11] spirit that is what you come out allow
[2:04:14] this year for you come allow this to
[2:04:16] enter into holy spirit do you understand
[2:04:18] what I'm saying so we are journeying
[2:04:21] into the promised land we are journeying
[2:04:23] into the holy spirit land do you believe
[2:04:26] that so what's your promise the holy
[2:04:29] spirit
[2:04:30] [Applause]
[2:04:32] what's your promise
[2:04:34] say it out loud what's your promise
[2:04:37] That spirit is dynamic. Oh, give the
[2:04:40] Lord a shout inside of here.
[2:04:44] All
[2:04:45] right. Abraham quote the scripture. It
[2:04:47] shall come to pass. I'll pour my spirit
[2:04:48] Joel too. Praise God. Adoption. Did you
[2:04:50] notice Joshua before they crossed
[2:04:52] Jordan, he said, "Go to the midst of the
[2:04:54] camp, clean your clothes. Sam, every one
[2:04:55] of you, let no man come at his wife or
[2:04:57] within three days, you'll see the glory
[2:04:59] of God."
[2:05:00] He says it's a process of getting ready
[2:05:04] to inherit the promise. So this promise
[2:05:07] is not a kind of everything goes. It's a
[2:05:10] process. That's right. And getting
[2:05:11] ready. All right. Let's continue
[2:05:13] question and
[2:05:14] answers.
[2:05:16] Now if that exactly up to your place
[2:05:19] this morning, here you come. Today the
[2:05:21] church has come to justification through
[2:05:22] Lutheration through the Methodist. Now
[2:05:25] up to the time of the promise. This is
[2:05:27] brother Brown again in question answers.
[2:05:28] Listen carefully. The promise is the
[2:05:32] baptism of the spirit. Hallelujah. Which
[2:05:35] is promised all through the Old
[2:05:37] Testament and new. The promise, behold,
[2:05:41] I send the promise of my father upon
[2:05:43] you. That is the promise. Are you ready?
[2:05:48] Amen. The promised land is to live in
[2:05:53] this land of the Holy Spirit. Amen. That
[2:05:56] God promised for the church. Amen. Is to
[2:05:59] live in the power of the spirit. It's
[2:06:02] another world. It's another land. You
[2:06:06] have to come out of the conditions that
[2:06:08] you have been in to come and live in
[2:06:11] this promised land to receive the
[2:06:14] promise. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:06:18] Remember the promise. You shall receive
[2:06:20] power from on high after the Holy Ghost
[2:06:22] is come upon you. So, let's go back to
[2:06:24] adoption. Moses being a type of Christ.
[2:06:28] led the children up to the promised
[2:06:30] land. Then Moses did not take the
[2:06:32] children in the promised land. Joshua
[2:06:35] took the people in and divided up the
[2:06:37] land. Jesus paid the price, led them up
[2:06:40] to the Holy Spirit. Then God sent down
[2:06:43] the Holy Spirit and he positionally
[2:06:45] placed the church in order. Each man
[2:06:48] filling him with his presence of his
[2:06:49] being, you see what I mean?
[2:06:52] Predestinated to be called to this
[2:06:53] gospel. So Jesus brought them up to the
[2:06:57] promised land, but Joshua, the Holy
[2:06:59] Ghost, take them over in the upper room.
[2:07:02] Isn't that right? Jesus told them, "If I
[2:07:05] don't go, the comforter will not come.
[2:07:07] I've got to go for the comforter to
[2:07:09] come. I am with you, but the comforter
[2:07:12] going to be in you. I will not leave you
[2:07:15] comfortless." The word is a comfort. But
[2:07:18] when the comforter is come, which is the
[2:07:20] Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in
[2:07:22] my name, he will lead you and teach you
[2:07:24] and bring things back to remembrance and
[2:07:26] show you things to come. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:29] What is it? The Holy Ghost coming upon
[2:07:31] your life to show you things to come and
[2:07:34] bring things back to your remembrance.
[2:07:37] Hallelujah. Could you give the Lord a
[2:07:38] praise offering? You have a promise of
[2:07:41] the Holy Ghost. That's your personal
[2:07:44] promise. Don't let no man take that from
[2:07:46] you. Don't let no church rob you from
[2:07:48] that. That's your promise. That's the
[2:07:50] promise of God. Amen.
[2:07:53] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:07:55] Thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:58] Hallelujah. For the believers and Caleb,
[2:08:00] Joshua outfit that was going on to the
[2:08:02] promise, they move over into the land.
[2:08:04] Hallelujah. And sat long in the land as
[2:08:05] a possession. We never stop at
[2:08:07] justification, sanification. Let us go
[2:08:10] on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:08:13] Let's not stop at believing on the Lord
[2:08:14] Jesus, being baptized. Let's not stop
[2:08:16] because he came from a life of sin. But
[2:08:18] now we press, here we go, into a
[2:08:20] position to a promise of the baptism of
[2:08:23] the Holy Ghost. For Peter said in the
[2:08:25] day of Pentecost, for the promises unto
[2:08:27] you and to your children and to them
[2:08:29] that are far off, even as many as the
[2:08:31] Lord our God shall call. Hallelujah. So,
[2:08:34] Ephesus here sets us like Joshua
[2:08:37] positionally. Notice Joshua after
[2:08:40] crossing over the land and taking the
[2:08:42] land, he divided the land. Ephraim here.
[2:08:45] Amen. Manister here. This one here, God
[2:08:49] here, Benjamin here, he divided the
[2:08:52] land. Oh, glory to God. Notice this just
[2:08:55] burns our hearts. Each one of those
[2:08:58] Hebrew mothers giving birth to those
[2:09:00] children. She spoke the very place in
[2:09:03] their labor pains where they would be
[2:09:06] positioned in the promised land. And
[2:09:08] Joshua not knowing this, but by
[2:09:11] inspiration, led of the Holy Spirit
[2:09:13] positionally placed them just where the
[2:09:15] birds say they're supposed to be. So the
[2:09:17] mother's grown and said, "God," the
[2:09:19] mother's grown and said, "Ephraim." The
[2:09:21] mother has grown and said Benjamin. And
[2:09:23] every one of them by the groanings was
[2:09:25] to be placed positionally in the land.
[2:09:28] Oh, hallelujah. and the Holy Spirit know
[2:09:31] where you belong. Amen. What position
[2:09:34] for you to be in? Oh, glory to God. But
[2:09:38] the mothers had to grown to get the
[2:09:40] name.
[2:09:42] Hallelujah. Thank you. Then brother, I'm
[2:09:44] bringing to something here. He say how
[2:09:46] God set in the church through the labor
[2:09:49] pains. Oh, glory to God. Not just
[2:09:51] singing special through labor pains. You
[2:09:54] got to get some pains. Oh, glory to God.
[2:09:56] A woman who just have a baby and just
[2:09:58] have a baby. She have 9 months to go
[2:10:00] through and then there's something
[2:10:00] called labor pain. Oh, glory to God,
[2:10:03] water bag break, then the blood, then
[2:10:05] praise God, a baby is coming. But she go
[2:10:08] into something called labor pain. And
[2:10:10] when labor pain start to affect her, she
[2:10:12] can't stop it. Oh, glory to God. Because
[2:10:14] time up for that baby. Time up. And I
[2:10:17] feel that God going to say time up. We
[2:10:20] have been waiting long enough looking
[2:10:22] for the promise of dynamics. Looking for
[2:10:24] the promise of the father is about time
[2:10:26] up. bring forth the Messiah because the
[2:10:29] Messiah must be identified. The Messiah
[2:10:31] going to be on the earth. Oh, say amen.
[2:10:33] Somebody time up. You waited long
[2:10:36] enough, grown long enough, hang in there
[2:10:38] long enough, prayed long enough.
[2:10:41] [Applause]
[2:10:46] Glory. So these bunch of ministers
[2:10:49] fooling themselves if they don't come
[2:10:51] through labor pains
[2:10:53] thinking they are five-fold ministry.
[2:10:55] Praise God. Because they say so. My
[2:10:58] Jesus. Amen. My Jesus.
[2:11:01] God has set some. Amen.
[2:11:04] Not the association said some. God has
[2:11:08] set some through labor pain. They get
[2:11:11] tremendous sometime.
[2:11:14] Hallelujah. Amen. I get 10% even on that
[2:11:17] one. Amen. Because they were tremendous
[2:11:19] and pain was in the same line.
[2:11:21] Hallelujah. They get tremendous
[2:11:22] sometimes.
[2:11:24] Amen. Amen. There we go. Are you ready?
[2:11:27] Amen. When a church is groaning, what
[2:11:30] church? Galatians. No. They're not
[2:11:32] growing. That's right. Hebrews, no. They
[2:11:35] on milk. Amen. What about Corinthians?
[2:11:38] They they even burden sin. So he's
[2:11:40] talking about Ephesians. When a church
[2:11:42] is groaning, Amen. under the persecution
[2:11:45] of the outside world. Now that is not
[2:11:49] people in party and dance. No, that's
[2:11:51] church world. Hallelujah.
[2:11:53] believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[2:11:56] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[2:11:59] real as it was to Pentecost. Don't try
[2:12:03] to expose away from me. Don't try to
[2:12:06] tell me that I have it already and I got
[2:12:08] it again. Don't try to tell me it's it
[2:12:10] see the real thing only. Hallelujah.
[2:12:13] Tell me it rightly divided. Tell me the
[2:12:17] new birth is a birth and tell me the new
[2:12:19] birth is an experience. Tell me the
[2:12:21] revelation comes first. Tell me the
[2:12:24] experience comes after. Tell me the seed
[2:12:26] is in the soul. And tell me the spirit
[2:12:29] have to strike the seed in the soul.
[2:12:32] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:12:38] [Applause]
[2:12:40] Don't tell me I'm a manifested son in
[2:12:42] seed form. That is foolishness.
[2:12:47] You can't be a manifested son in seed
[2:12:49] form. A seed is a seed to become
[2:12:53] manifested. The seed have to go through
[2:12:55] process. It have some seeds don't even
[2:12:57] make it up. They stick up so and die.
[2:13:00] Hallelujah. That is potential.
[2:13:04] Hallelujah. You have a seed. You have a
[2:13:06] potential crop. That is potential. Let
[2:13:09] the rain fall. Let the sunshine and let
[2:13:11] the birds come around. Some fell on the
[2:13:14] wayside. Some of the birds are listen.
[2:13:16] Some of the birds take it. Amen.
[2:13:19] Oh, you not hearing me? Hallelujah. So,
[2:13:22] in other words, you have to grow into
[2:13:24] that manifestation. As many as receive
[2:13:27] him, the word to them gave he power to
[2:13:30] become.
[2:13:35] That means you have to add to your
[2:13:37] faith, virtue, and knowledge and
[2:13:39] temperance and patience. You can't set
[2:13:42] because you're in church. You can't set
[2:13:43] because you believe a prophet. You have
[2:13:45] to add. Peter said so. Having escaped
[2:13:48] the corruption that is in the world
[2:13:49] through lust, loss of the eyes, loss of
[2:13:51] the flesh. You escaped that to get this.
[2:13:56] You escaped that to come into
[2:13:59] [Applause]
[2:14:04] this. Receive that. You can't stop.
[2:14:08] You're going to have lust of the eyes,
[2:14:09] lust of the flesh, that have money,
[2:14:10] woman, popularity. All that will always
[2:14:12] be there. That's the world. All that is
[2:14:15] in the world. But what God call us to is
[2:14:17] overcome. You have to tell yourself that
[2:14:19] you are going to be in Ephesians where
[2:14:21] the overcoming will begin where you have
[2:14:23] to take mountains and and and and fight
[2:14:26] for what is right and burn down cities.
[2:14:28] Sometime you have to burn the past you
[2:14:29] know light a match and burn it. Don't
[2:14:32] have no boyfriend in the closet to bring
[2:14:33] him back out. Kill him dead to the
[2:14:36] world. Debt to worldly girlfriend.
[2:14:38] Worldly boyfriend. You kill that. You
[2:14:40] cut that off. Why? You're going on
[2:14:42] inheritance.
[2:14:44] Hallelujah. How many want inheritance?
[2:14:47] [Applause]
[2:14:48] Hallelujah.
[2:14:52] Hallelujah.
[2:14:53] Hallelujah. If you're tired, stand up.
[2:14:56] Shout, "Praise God because I ain't
[2:14:57] finished yet." Amen. Right now, I
[2:15:00] throwing in a second gear, second win.
[2:15:02] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. We going
[2:15:04] to have an Ephesians church and a church
[2:15:07] that want to line up. They say, "Give me
[2:15:09] word, preacher. Drop it on me. Give it
[2:15:12] to me." Hallelujah. I want it.
[2:15:19] I wish brother could preach a bunch like
[2:15:21] you. Amen. Had it hard enough. That's
[2:15:24] right. He alone speaking and them people
[2:15:26] just fanning and thing like that and
[2:15:27] they wait for the prayer line. Yes. Yes.
[2:15:31] Hallelujah. Half the thing good over the
[2:15:34] head. And because he's a prophet, he
[2:15:36] could prophesy. I see the bride called.
[2:15:38] I see the bride sealed. Hallelujah. See
[2:15:40] the bride. See only seen the bride.
[2:15:42] seeing the bride. He got talk about
[2:15:44] church. Church is trouble. Church is
[2:15:46] shock. You know, I see the shock. I see
[2:15:48] the shock. I see the shock. We want to
[2:15:49] see each other.
[2:15:51] Hallelujah.
[2:15:53] Amen. You're looking for bride. Not
[2:15:56] bridesmaid.
[2:15:58] Amen.
[2:16:00] Have a girlfriend, your fiance, is she
[2:16:03] looking for the bridesmaid is part of
[2:16:05] the bridal party, but they're not the
[2:16:07] bride.
[2:16:09] Hallelujah. We want to be bride or
[2:16:11] bridal party.
[2:16:15] No, you needed by the party, but it have
[2:16:18] a bride.
[2:16:21] And sometimes there are people in your
[2:16:22] life, God ordained that they help you.
[2:16:24] That's right. By troubling you. Amen.
[2:16:27] Amen. Amen.
[2:16:31] Amen.
[2:16:33] That's right. The trouble coming good,
[2:16:34] you know, hot and heavy. Because when
[2:16:37] you get them troubles, nobody
[2:16:40] knows. And yet yet nobody in church.
[2:16:43] Nobody knows. You're not gossiping. The
[2:16:46] trouble I've seen but
[2:16:48] Jesus. Jesus said, "That's my son. That
[2:16:50] my daughter." You're going through your
[2:16:52] struggles and you're acting right.
[2:16:53] You're doing right. God must bless you.
[2:16:57] I know God bless us for staying with the
[2:16:59] word. I know God blessing me and God
[2:17:01] will bless me for staying with the word.
[2:17:05] Friend or no friend?
[2:17:07] I'm getting more and more detached from
[2:17:09] human spirit and feelings and emotion.
[2:17:11] One time I had a boss and sister, she
[2:17:13] cried on the phone. I said, "Listen, I'm
[2:17:14] not your husband." You know, I'm a I'm
[2:17:15] the pastor of the church. I tell like it
[2:17:17] is I am not there with you when you're
[2:17:18] crying. I tell her what I supposed to
[2:17:20] tell her. She cried and cried and cried
[2:17:22] and cried. What to do with that crying?
[2:17:24] That's your own female spirit is what
[2:17:26] the word say. So I supposed to be caught
[2:17:28] up in your human spirit. Oh God, she
[2:17:29] cry. Oh God, I cried too. You crying by
[2:17:33] yourself cuz you have to die. Amen. When
[2:17:36] the word come is the word friend or no
[2:17:39] friend you see what I'm talking
[2:17:42] [Applause]
[2:17:44] if you married to an don't do like
[2:17:47] saf change your
[2:17:51] name don't do likes of fire say that man
[2:17:54] was always a crook God help
[2:17:56] me all right so watch they get
[2:18:00] tremendous sometime believing the Lord
[2:18:02] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:18:03] just as real as was the Pentecost how
[2:18:05] they grown moan and cry under labor
[2:18:08] pains. But when they are born one and
[2:18:11] positionally born two into the kingdom
[2:18:14] then the Holy Ghost when then the Holy
[2:18:17] Ghost not before then the Holy Ghost
[2:18:19] sets in the church some apostles some
[2:18:22] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[2:18:24] evangelists and in there he get speaking
[2:18:26] in tongues interpretation in tongues.
[2:18:28] What did God tell the prophet? Do the
[2:18:29] work of evangelist. But he was placed as
[2:18:32] that Elijah. When you open the word, six
[2:18:35] seals. Christ was the seventh seal. He
[2:18:37] opened six seals. Christ veiled in him
[2:18:39] the seventh seal. But he was vindicated
[2:18:41] to be that Elijah because the word comes
[2:18:43] to a prophet. And he went with the
[2:18:44] king's sword, flipped the whole pyramid
[2:18:47] open and brought back the word of God.
[2:18:49] He went west to bring back the
[2:18:50] interpretation of the white rock, the
[2:18:52] granite stone. Hallelujah. He came back
[2:18:55] with the word that vindicated him to be
[2:18:57] in Malachi 4 that Elijah prophet. He was
[2:18:59] not positionally placed as an adopted
[2:19:01] son in the kingdom of God to reveal God.
[2:19:04] And then later on he said come to the
[2:19:06] unveiling of the mighty God. God was
[2:19:08] veiled in that
[2:19:10] manifil. He wasn't waiting on the angel.
[2:19:12] The angel was in him. Oh give the Lord a
[2:19:14] shout of praise. Oh give the Lord a
[2:19:17] shout in the house.
[2:19:23] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:19:25] Then that prophet prophesied that the
[2:19:27] pillar of fire will be veiled in the
[2:19:29] adopted sons. Are you telling me there's
[2:19:31] no adopted sons? There's not going to be
[2:19:33] any adopted sons. There will be an
[2:19:35] adopted sons. Not based upon their
[2:19:37] preaching, not based upon the shouts of
[2:19:39] their churches, but based upon their
[2:19:40] behavior. He want the Holy Spirit giving
[2:19:43] reports. That son is just like mine. He
[2:19:45] walk like me. He talks like me. He acts
[2:19:47] like me. He operates like me.
[2:19:53] That's that's adoption. Are you
[2:19:55] understanding it? You may be seated.
[2:19:57] Then go to have a ceremony, not a
[2:19:59] private ceremony, public ceremony. Go
[2:20:02] bring out in the open. He said he will
[2:20:04] let it be made known among men. You
[2:20:07] can't even keep it a secret. He would
[2:20:09] make sure he identify this is my beloved
[2:20:12] son in whom I'm pleased. Hear him. Look,
[2:20:15] look him here. Look, look, look at
[2:20:16] daughter here. Look, look at here. He
[2:20:18] going to identify his son. And listen,
[2:20:20] the son will not be ashamed of the
[2:20:21] father and the father will be ashamed of
[2:20:22] the son. The son love the father, the
[2:20:24] father love the son. Son doeth that
[2:20:26] which pleases the father. Who going to
[2:20:28] stop that? When God begin to take the
[2:20:30] robe off of his sons. Understand this.
[2:20:31] The devil went in God's Eden and threw
[2:20:33] on God's masterpiece. And now God choose
[2:20:36] Satan Eden to come to unveil his
[2:20:38] masterpiece. Oh my God. And the same
[2:20:41] alpha church which is the Ephesians
[2:20:42] church was God masterpiece. He was that
[2:20:45] was an alpha bride. And now God come
[2:20:46] through omega bride to unveil a
[2:20:48] masterpiece. And and God waited for
[2:20:50] Satan to lose all the naked women, all
[2:20:52] the pornography. He waited for the
[2:20:54] internet. He waited for everything to be
[2:20:56] set just right. Everybody connected.
[2:20:58] When China, something happened to China
[2:21:00] and the whole stock market all around
[2:21:01] the world start to go downhill. Oil
[2:21:03] going down. Things beyond the control of
[2:21:05] governments. They book the oil at $80.
[2:21:07] Now the oil $40. They can't stop what's
[2:21:10] going to happen because they can't buy
[2:21:11] or sell until they take the mark of the
[2:21:13] beast. The whole financial system is
[2:21:15] connected all together around the world.
[2:21:17] Oh glory to God. So what happened way in
[2:21:19] some other country affect the next
[2:21:20] country way across there and what
[2:21:22] happened here going to affect some place
[2:21:24] across there. Why? The prophet said the
[2:21:26] Holy Ghost will go across the world
[2:21:28] overnight. You have to understand what
[2:21:30] is happening. There's a supernatural
[2:21:31] power about to break forth into the
[2:21:33] church. No man could stop. The heavens
[2:21:35] will shut up for many years. And Elijah
[2:21:37] said that even through a rain will fall
[2:21:39] till I call for it. But there's a people
[2:21:41] about to be raised up that going to
[2:21:43] unlock the heavens by speaking the seven
[2:21:45] tunnels by revelation. And they're going
[2:21:47] to lock the heavens and the rain is
[2:21:49] going to begin to fall and nothing going
[2:21:51] to stop it. Your sins can't even stop
[2:21:53] it. Your past can't stop it. Your
[2:21:55] failures can't stop it. What you have
[2:21:57] been through can't stop it because the
[2:21:59] mouth of the Lord has spoken
[2:22:04] it.
[2:22:06] Hallelujah.
[2:22:07] Hallelujah. You may be seated. I'm
[2:22:10] talking about family in the last days
[2:22:11] for the hearing of the true word. They
[2:22:13] run to the east or the west. They can't
[2:22:14] find it. We got people preaching their
[2:22:16] own thing. Understand this. People can
[2:22:18] preach Bible. They have big churches,
[2:22:19] 20,000, 10,000. All kind of churches.
[2:22:21] They don't have to believe a prophet.
[2:22:22] They can believe whatever they want and
[2:22:23] have a church. That is church. That's
[2:22:26] not bride. That's church. The bride is
[2:22:28] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone.
[2:22:30] Bar said he came to bring you his the
[2:22:32] mate, the revealed word. That's your
[2:22:34] husband. He said that's your mate. So
[2:22:36] when the revealed word comes to you,
[2:22:38] your husband is coming to you. Glory to
[2:22:41] God. Glory to God. Why son of man come?
[2:22:44] to bring seed. Amen. Amen. To sew the
[2:22:48] bribe. To put a seed in you. Amen. And
[2:22:50] that you could get pregnant.
[2:22:52] Amen. Pregnant with God. Hallelujah.
[2:22:55] Carrying a baby. Carrying baby Jesus.
[2:22:58] Pregnant with God. Carrying a
[2:22:59] manifestation locked up in your life.
[2:23:01] All the potentials in that seed. Oh. Oh.
[2:23:04] Glory to God. All the power is in that
[2:23:05] seed. All God's glory is in the word.
[2:23:08] All God's glory in the seed. And that
[2:23:10] seed is inside of you. The secret is the
[2:23:12] word is in the bride. Oh, glory to God.
[2:23:15] You can't study while you was backing
[2:23:16] for so much years and oh missing so much
[2:23:18] years and they can't make it. No. Jesus
[2:23:20] give a parable to handle that. He talk
[2:23:22] about the pay the same penny workers
[2:23:24] working whole day. People working for 40
[2:23:26] years, 30 years waiting for dynamics and
[2:23:28] you come in the last hour and you say
[2:23:29] pay time now. Well, that's what I'm
[2:23:31] talking about. Pay time about to come
[2:23:33] forth. Dynamics about to come forth.
[2:23:35] Power about to come forth. Stop studying
[2:23:37] how long it was backing. Stop solving
[2:23:38] how long you was out of it. Forget about
[2:23:40] it. Study what God promised. He promised
[2:23:42] dynamics. He promised the Holy Ghost. He
[2:23:45] promised a super church. He promised a
[2:23:46] super race. He promised another
[2:23:48] Ephesians. The bride that Ephesians
[2:23:50] bride will come into view again.
[2:23:56] [Applause]
[2:24:00] Hallelujah. Wonderful. According to
[2:24:02] Ephesians 4. Amen. Isn't that right?
[2:24:05] Hallelujah. Everybody gets something.
[2:24:07] You have a place for everybody. Not just
[2:24:09] the preachers get something. Fight for
[2:24:10] ministry. Fight for ministry. Oh, I get
[2:24:12] tired of that because it's flesh and
[2:24:14] blood parading the beef
[2:24:16] trying to say fivefold ministry. No
[2:24:18] death, no cross, no crucifixion. But
[2:24:20] abandon was a prophet, you know. He was
[2:24:22] not fivefold minister, you know. He was
[2:24:25] a major prophet, you know. Hallelujah.
[2:24:27] According to Malachi 4, this scripture
[2:24:29] wasn't in in in Ephesians 4. You know,
[2:24:31] he wasn't Ephesians 4 prophet, you know.
[2:24:33] He was a prophet like not to Moses.
[2:24:35] Hallelujah. that that level like Isaiah,
[2:24:38] that level of prophet, you know,
[2:24:40] and he lost his wife. Amen.
[2:24:44] And he lost his child.
[2:24:46] And he lost the anointing for 5 years.
[2:24:52] Amen. He was not a Pentecostal preacher.
[2:24:54] He was a prophet.
[2:24:56] Amen. Almost killed himself and the gun
[2:24:58] couldn't go off. Amen. He got depressed.
[2:25:02] That's right. He wants to give up.
[2:25:04] That's right. And God take him through.
[2:25:07] Later on in adoption, he said he could
[2:25:09] turn your wife against you. He could
[2:25:10] take your wife. He could take your
[2:25:12] child. He could do discuss your
[2:25:13] sickness. He says the test that could
[2:25:16] come. Amen. Amen. You haven't reached
[2:25:19] that yet. You haven't even seen the
[2:25:21] wilderness.
[2:25:23] Amen. And some of you
[2:25:26] like we're dead. But if you were dead
[2:25:29] now, don't say, "Lord, no wilderness,
[2:25:30] please."
[2:25:33] Now, we need the wilderness. Yes sir. We
[2:25:35] need to test because that is what will
[2:25:36] form into the word image.
[2:25:41] No test, no forming.
[2:25:44] Are amen getting so light. You
[2:25:45] understand what I'm saying? You have to
[2:25:46] understand that. You know the pressure
[2:25:49] is what changes and molds and shapes.
[2:25:53] That is what going to do it for you. You
[2:25:55] can't run from it. You can't hide from
[2:25:57] it. You have to understand what you have
[2:25:59] to go through. Not taken out of but go
[2:26:02] through.
[2:26:05] If God rescue you, you ain't go through.
[2:26:08] He rescue you. When you go through it,
[2:26:11] you are changed.
[2:26:16] Now listen, if your eye feeling sleepy,
[2:26:18] rub it. Get a match stick, stick it,
[2:26:21] open your eye, keep your eye open, but
[2:26:23] don't sleep on me right now. Don't get
[2:26:25] weary on me right now because we are in
[2:26:27] the word and we got to get this. You got
[2:26:29] to see what it is. You got to see what
[2:26:31] you're pressing on into. Oh, glory. You
[2:26:34] got to see what you're fighting for.
[2:26:35] You're not fighting for brother oid. No,
[2:26:38] you're not fighting for this church. No,
[2:26:40] we don't have that kind of thing. You're
[2:26:41] not fighting against a group. Glory.
[2:26:43] Glory. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:26:47] Hallelujah. We have no enemies out
[2:26:49] there. Praise God. We have enough
[2:26:51] enemies out there.
[2:26:54] You are your own enemy. Amen. Amen.
[2:26:58] They don't want to say amen on that one.
[2:27:00] Amen. You are your biggest enemy. If you
[2:27:02] could get with you, you'll be fine. But
[2:27:04] you are in the way. Let me Oh my God.
[2:27:07] Hallelujah. Let me challenge you. What
[2:27:09] would you do if there was no restraint
[2:27:11] upon your life?
[2:27:15] How far would you go if there was no
[2:27:17] hindrance upon your life? No sin, no
[2:27:20] complexes, no issues. If you could have
[2:27:23] break out of your past, you're going
[2:27:25] home and your mother was so and your
[2:27:27] father was so that why you are so too.
[2:27:31] I'm talking about all that nonsense and
[2:27:33] that is nonsense. That have nothing to
[2:27:35] do with the cross on Calvary. What if
[2:27:38] you were unhindered? What if what was
[2:27:40] binding you was taken off of you this
[2:27:43] morning? Would you run? Hallelujah.
[2:27:45] Would you dance? Would you shout? What
[2:27:49] if you had no hindrances? I can't speak.
[2:27:52] I can't talk. I have no education. I
[2:27:55] can't write. What if you had no limits?
[2:28:00] I want you to answer me.
[2:28:02] I can't love.
[2:28:04] I can't trust. I get I get problems to
[2:28:08] be open.
[2:28:09] What if What if that could break off for
[2:28:12] you? Where where would you do? What
[2:28:14] would you do? Amen.
[2:28:18] If there's no sin in your life and there
[2:28:19] is nothing hindering you, what would you
[2:28:21] do at this moment? No issues. You're
[2:28:25] going past what your neighbor did you?
[2:28:27] You gone past what this one tricked you
[2:28:29] and what this one would dishonor. You're
[2:28:31] going past who lie. No issues. No
[2:28:33] against anybody. You are free indeed.
[2:28:37] Would you sit there like that?
[2:28:43] [Applause]
[2:28:45] You may be seated. What if you have no
[2:28:48] issues? I don't have a husband. I don't
[2:28:50] have a wife. I'm not tall enough. I'm
[2:28:52] not pretty enough. I'm not big enough.

[2:29:13] that yoke upon you because they clouding
[2:29:16] your mind because that's your children
[2:29:18] and you're overburdened with them and
[2:29:19] you can't even pray good because you
[2:29:21] can't even see the will of God for your
[2:29:22] life because you're concerned about

[2:29:56] job. That for somebody else to do. That
[2:29:59] for sister to do. That for sister so and
[2:30:02] so to do. That's what brother to do.
[2:30:03] That's brother George to do. That's what
[2:30:05] if there was nothing like that. There
[2:30:07] was just a open sea in which you only
[2:30:10] seeing the will of God. Amen. And
[2:30:12] there's no hindrance. And then you're in
[2:30:14] that wheelchair and you you you
[2:30:16] recognize there's nothing hindering you
[2:30:17] from coming out that wheelchair there.
[2:30:19] There's nothing hindering you from your
[2:30:20] arm. There's nothing hindering
[2:30:21] you from making an effort to move that
[2:30:24] finger there because you never even
[2:30:26] tried. But something tell you, you know
[2:30:27] what? I like holding my hand like
[2:30:29] this all the time. The doctor tell me
[2:30:30] the finger can't move. And you decide to
[2:30:31] make an effort and you're watching your
[2:30:33] finger and say move. You got to move.
[2:30:34] You got to move. I've got to do
[2:30:35] something. There's no hindrance. There's
[2:30:37] no hindrance of faith. All things are
[2:30:38] possible to them that believe. And the
[2:30:40] first finger move, the second finger
[2:30:42] could move, the third finger could move.
[2:30:43] Your hand could move. What could hinder
[2:30:45] you? Praise God. Hallelujah. Have no
[2:30:48] idols before me. Don't put the movies
[2:30:51] before God. That's an idol. Don't put
[2:30:52] the internet before God. That's an idol.
[2:30:55] Don't put Facebook before God. That's an
[2:30:56] idol. Don't put your church before God.

[2:31:35] Pharaoh chariots and them dead in the
[2:31:37] sea? All your past washed away. All your
[2:31:40] sins washed away. Oh, glory to God. Who

[2:32:02] Hallelujah. Yeah. What if that sinful
[2:32:03] unclean thought wasn't bothering you
[2:32:05] where it is? What would you do? Thank
[2:32:08] you, Jesus. Things that you can't even
[2:32:09] speak to other people. Jesus. And your
[2:32:11] mind racing because devil just slamming
[2:32:14] your mind. Hallelujah. What would you do
[2:32:16] if you get free from all of that? Free
[2:32:18] from all the unclean thoughts and the
[2:32:19] evil thoughts and the lustful thoughts
[2:32:21] and you begin to get free from all of
[2:32:22] that. What going to happen to your life?
[2:32:25] Would you break out as a son of God?
[2:32:26] Would you break out of a daughter of
[2:32:27] God? Would you break out to serve God
[2:32:29] with all your heart? You shall find me
[2:32:31] when you seek me with all your heart.
[2:32:34] All your heart means the movie out. All
[2:32:36] your heart means pornography out. All
[2:32:38] your heart means the world out. All your
[2:32:40] heart means the filth of the world out.
[2:32:42] All your heart. All your heart. All your
[2:32:45] heart. Oh glory to God. Want all of your
[2:32:48] heart. Oh, don't put no idol inside of
[2:32:50] there. Don't let the movies ground you
[2:32:52] because inside of there. Don't need
[2:32:54] worldly friends ground you because
[2:32:55] inside of there you shall find me when
[2:32:58] you seek with all of your heart. God
[2:33:00] want your heart this morning. Not your
[2:33:01] head, your heart. If you have a desire
[2:33:03] for God to activate what's in your
[2:33:05] heart, he going to activate that today.
[2:33:07] Yes. He going to anoint you with a
[2:33:08] passion to know the word. He going to
[2:33:10] anoint you with a cry to get in the
[2:33:11] spirit. He going to anoint you with a
[2:33:12] fervent desire to please God. How many
[2:33:15] want that this morning? How many want
[2:33:17] that? Another Ephesians.
[2:33:20] Oh, glory to God. Reject the Galatians
[2:33:22] church. They are good. They are fine.
[2:33:24] They in the message. Reject it.
[2:33:28] You may be seated. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[2:33:31] we go. We spend some time today. I'm
[2:33:32] telling you,
[2:33:36] you say brother rejected. Yes. Rejected
[2:33:39] because when that which is perfect is
[2:33:41] come, hallelujah. That which is in part
[2:33:44] is done away. Hallelujah. God don't need
[2:33:46] a Galatians or Corinthians or Hebrews.
[2:33:48] He don't need that. He need Ephesians
[2:33:51] because that is the vision of the bride.
[2:33:54] [Applause]
[2:33:56] So I don't care who preacher, who
[2:33:57] minister, if they're not preaching the
[2:33:59] word as spoken by Malachi 4, I'm not
[2:34:02] interested.
[2:34:04] I am not interested. Any cuckoo
[2:34:07] revelation, any new revelation, it must
[2:34:10] be as the prophet said it because the
[2:34:12] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[2:34:14] will say the same thing.
[2:34:18] Hear me church.
[2:34:21] Hear me good. The spirit, hallelujah,
[2:34:24] the prophet and the bride will say the
[2:34:26] same thing.
[2:34:28] Hallelujah. You may be seated. The
[2:34:30] problem is the people in the message
[2:34:31] don't know the message because the
[2:34:33] people have been preaching their own
[2:34:34] thoughts for a long time. That's right.
[2:34:36] Because they figure they are little mini
[2:34:38] prophets. They bringing revelations. The
[2:34:40] truth. Amen. Amen. Give example. years
[2:34:44] ago I met met a brother and we were in a
[2:34:47] fellowship and he says justification is
[2:34:50] like this pick up a piece of wood with
[2:34:52] moss in it. So he start there going off
[2:34:55] because that song is a real revelation
[2:34:58] cuz in those days they like to say that
[2:35:01] trainer do have wheat so we can't use
[2:35:02] our wheat type so we make our own type.
[2:35:05] Amen. So say okay go ahead sanification
[2:35:08] take the most out of it. Holy Ghost you
[2:35:11] shape the wood. I said, "Okay." I said,
[2:35:14] "What did Brother Brandon say?"
[2:35:16] Justification think about dirty glass.
[2:35:19] Sanification, wash the glass, bapt the
[2:35:22] Holy Ghost, you pour milk into the
[2:35:23] glass. I said, "You afraid the milk or
[2:35:25] what?"
[2:35:27] I said, "Now with your revelation is the
[2:35:30] moss and the wood is the same wood."
[2:35:32] Yes. No new element added. You just
[2:35:35] scrape the moss off the wood and shape
[2:35:37] the same old wood. Yes.
[2:35:39] But with the brother Brandham type, you
[2:35:42] introduce a new element. You pour milk
[2:35:44] into the glass. That is the Holy Ghost
[2:35:46] representative there. Now watch. If you
[2:35:49] don't know the word, that type sounds
[2:35:51] good. It's so close it could deceive the
[2:35:54] lick if possible. But that is
[2:35:55] foolishness. You a want to get no scrape
[2:35:58] off no moss and shape your old wood. You
[2:36:01] the same old man just a new tie on you.
[2:36:03] You feel to put blue today and yellow
[2:36:05] tomorrow. Every day you're changing your
[2:36:07] tie because you feeling if anybody have
[2:36:09] a brand new tie, they're feeling brand
[2:36:11] new. What kind of foolishness is that?
[2:36:12] You can't preach that kind of gospel.
[2:36:13] There's got to be a fire. That's what
[2:36:15] I'm saying. They're not preaching it,
[2:36:17] but we going to preach it till fire
[2:36:19] come. Fire have to come.
[2:36:23] Hallelujah.
[2:36:25] Fire has to come. Holy Ghost fire. Who
[2:36:28] said that? John said there's one
[2:36:30] standing among you. He going to baptize
[2:36:32] you with the Holy Ghost and fire. John's
[2:36:34] essay there's one stand among you. He go
[2:36:36] get a revelation of who you are and
[2:36:38] explain the seed inside your soul.
[2:36:40] That's not what John said. He said
[2:36:42] baptism of fire.
[2:36:49] What is water baptism? Take you and put
[2:36:52] your full body down in water. Amen. What
[2:36:55] is fire baptism? Take you and put your
[2:36:58] whole in your spirit. When you come out,
[2:37:00] you're drenched. You're staggering like
[2:37:01] drunk men. Oh, glory to God. your whole
[2:37:04] being drenched with the spirit. You're
[2:37:06] drunk.
[2:37:07] Drunk with the spirit. You could get
[2:37:10] drunk. These people are not drunk as you
[2:37:13] suppose. But this is that
[2:37:16] new land. This is that Holy Ghost land.
[2:37:20] This is that Canaan land.
[2:37:23] Do you want
[2:37:24] [Applause]
[2:37:27] it? Or do you want to hold on to your
[2:37:29] dreams or your own interpretation or the
[2:37:32] Lord show you? The Lord tell you and the
[2:37:34] Lord tell you. Lord tell you nothing.
[2:37:37] Hallelujah. You tell yourself you had a
[2:37:40] dream. You talk to your own self.
[2:37:42] Something in your own mind. Lord tell
[2:37:44] you that the Lord spoke to me. Spoke to
[2:37:46] you. I told you what tell you. The Lord
[2:37:49] tell me don't tell
[2:37:50] you. That is how I know the devil.
[2:37:54] Because I am the watchman and I'm to
[2:37:57] protect you from evil spirits talking to
[2:37:59] your head. So when you tell me God tell
[2:38:01] you, I'll say what God tell you. He said
[2:38:03] I can't tell you because the Lord tell
[2:38:04] me don't tell you. I know the devil
[2:38:06] talking to you. The devil taking you a
[2:38:07] private escort into his his thing.
[2:38:15] Long time when you have your dream, you
[2:38:17] just say you have a dream. You know
[2:38:18] that's something called human thumb.
[2:38:20] That's right. That's right. A
[2:38:22] breastplate. You have to come and speak
[2:38:23] it. Hallelujah. The high priest to the
[2:38:26] high priest. Let us speak the dream in
[2:38:28] front of that. And if it light up is
[2:38:31] God. If it don't light up, go and dream
[2:38:34] again.
[2:38:37] Amen. Take a reboot on that dream cuz
[2:38:39] God ain't talk to you. That is how they
[2:38:41] knew it in the Old Testament. Every time
[2:38:42] somebody have a dream, I get a dream
[2:38:44] from the Lord. Bring it forth.
[2:38:46] Priest come with a breastplate. Speak.
[2:38:51] Some people used to just do so when they
[2:38:52] see that. So I going back here.
[2:38:57] Some people had the confidence to turn
[2:38:58] right back. They don't even bother to
[2:39:00] just speak the dream because that they
[2:39:01] know not no fire coming on that. But
[2:39:03] when God is in that dream and you speak
[2:39:05] it's at a glow. They know it's God.
[2:39:07] That's what God put there. So don't tell
[2:39:09] me you have something and you can't
[2:39:11] speak it. Bring it to the human thumb.
[2:39:14] We have it right here.
[2:39:16] [Applause]
[2:39:21] In one of those brothers age I don't
[2:39:22] know is Martin or one of them guys that
[2:39:25] fell used to get a gong a robe used to
[2:39:28] pee on
[2:39:29] him like a supernatural robe and used to
[2:39:33] get people excited and somebody said
[2:39:36] something wrong with that I don't
[2:39:38] understand how that feel like in that
[2:39:39] robe I explain that but I I get that
[2:39:42] they went to Martin one of the messenger
[2:39:45] the agent say Martin we go bring Martin
[2:39:46] for him man when you see Martin that
[2:39:48] rope
[2:39:49] disappear when the messenger of the age
[2:39:52] come they can't come with no funny
[2:39:53] cuckoo business and thing you know go
[2:39:55] them fellas come with the light of God
[2:39:57] you know Satan does impersonate Satan is
[2:39:59] how all kind of gimmicks all kind of
[2:40:01] thing like that it's got to be the word
[2:40:07] hallelujah
[2:40:09] years ago a brother came I didn't know
[2:40:12] him he heard about me and he come on the
[2:40:14] job and talking about first principle
[2:40:16] and second principle and prophesying so
[2:40:18] he's talking to the next brother and my
[2:40:19] and he's back west to me. So I came up
[2:40:22] to him and he turned to me. He said,
[2:40:24] "Don't doubt now." Are you talking about
[2:40:26] something? Hallelujah. Talking stuff and
[2:40:28] don't doubt now. See like you're
[2:40:29] doubting and talking like that like he's
[2:40:32] a prophet and I'm standing there and the
[2:40:34] Holy Spirit spoke to my heart. Tell me
[2:40:36] he have that old Pentecostal prophet
[2:40:37] spirit upon him. Don't believe receiving
[2:40:39] nothing. When he finished talking like
[2:40:42] that, you know, I listen to him. The
[2:40:44] other brother was trembling who you
[2:40:45] talking to and he tell me all what he
[2:40:47] say and all he said. I said I said he
[2:40:49] could float in the
[2:40:51] air. I reject that totally. No man can
[2:40:55] come and tell me thus say the Lord. You
[2:40:56] speaking thus say the Lord J. And God
[2:40:58] had talked to that guy at all. Now he's
[2:41:00] a
[2:41:03] politician. He going up for election and
[2:41:05] if you meet him he say he's going to
[2:41:07] win. He
[2:41:10] solo he's
[2:41:12] independent and he if you meet him he's
[2:41:15] so excited. He said she's good. Of
[2:41:17] course, he's going to be next prime
[2:41:18] minister. Totally
[2:41:21] insane. And he was once in the prophetic
[2:41:25] realm. Now, what if I believe that
[2:41:27] foolishness? That's what I'm saying. You
[2:41:30] have to be on the word and try the
[2:41:34] spirits.
[2:41:36] Somebody said, "Lord, send me to
[2:41:39] you." Try that and call the pastor.
[2:41:46] Call the pastor. Don't be afraid to call
[2:41:48] the pastor. Be there for you. Amen. Oh
[2:41:50] yes. Oh yes. He a watchman in the house.
[2:41:53] Yes. He's a watchman in the tower. God
[2:41:55] put him there to see things that you
[2:41:57] can't see. Amen. To hear things you
[2:41:59] can't hear. Yes. To discern things you
[2:42:01] can't discern. Sometimes your figure is
[2:42:03] God. It's not God. It's a spirit. It
[2:42:05] have religious spirits. In personal
[2:42:07] Christianity religious spirits. My God.
[2:42:10] It come like like when a church small a
[2:42:12] church small small church somebody say I
[2:42:15] want to sing a special yeah I see it
[2:42:16] already and man spinning the the um the
[2:42:19] books I have a special I have a
[2:42:24] special and it's been the song book and
[2:42:27] after a while they the um the I see a a
[2:42:31] song and they excuse the voice
[2:42:36] um and they start to sing not that good
[2:42:40] for 20 people and 15 people. We could
[2:42:42] tolerate that. But as we grow, we need
[2:42:45] people who could sing. Amen. If you
[2:42:47] can't sing, don't try. You do have the
[2:42:50] gift. Not everybody could. Not everybody
[2:42:52] could sing, you know. No, not everybody
[2:42:55] could play music. I know somebody tried
[2:42:57] to play bass and if they finger swell
[2:42:59] and they still up to now can't play the
[2:43:01] bass. But I'm saying you have to have a
[2:43:03] gift. It's a gift to play piano. It's a
[2:43:05] gift to play guitar. It's a gift to
[2:43:07] sing. If you don't have it, bless those
[2:43:09] who have it and see your gift. Your gift
[2:43:11] may be to bake bread
[2:43:14] or to write poems. You don't know. But
[2:43:17] some other gift than those. We want the
[2:43:19] people with the gifts that could do what
[2:43:21] God called them to do and do it well.
[2:43:25] Oh, hallelujah. What is that? That's
[2:43:27] going to be Ephesians church. Not small
[2:43:30] church. Not country church. No, a bride
[2:43:32] church. That bride coming in preview
[2:43:35] again. Could we take a little more?
[2:43:37] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. So by one
[2:43:40] spirit we are baptized into one body.
[2:43:42] Isn't that right? So election looks back
[2:43:44] to fornowledge and predestination look
[2:43:47] back to destiny. So when you're elected,
[2:43:50] you recognize you were fornown of God.
[2:43:52] But when you know you are predestinated,
[2:43:53] you have a destiny. Then what are we
[2:43:55] pressing onto? Then what are we going on
[2:43:58] to? We are here already. We know we have
[2:44:00] been elected. We know we have been found
[2:44:02] of God. But what are we predestinated
[2:44:05] onto? We are predestined unto adoption.
[2:44:08] We are predestined unto another
[2:44:10] Ephesians. We are going to have it.
[2:44:13] Oh, Peter going to feel proud.
[2:44:18] Oh, I feel good to say that. Peter and
[2:44:20] Paul going to feel proud of this last
[2:44:22] day. Church, we cannot fail.
[2:44:25] We got to produce another Ephesians.
[2:44:28] Paul saying those people going to be
[2:44:30] just like us. Peter, here they come. Oh,
[2:44:33] hallelujah. They going to have a revival
[2:44:34] in Trinidad. They're going to have a
[2:44:35] revival around the world. Here they
[2:44:38] come. That first bride and the last
[2:44:39] bride is the same bride. Here they come.
[2:44:42] The first church and the last church is
[2:44:44] the same church. Here they come. A
[2:44:45] spoken word with pride. What happened in
[2:44:48] Joshua? Oh my God. Joshua was winning
[2:44:50] the battle and he wanted to take a rest
[2:44:52] day. Isn't that right? And he know if he
[2:44:55] don't cut them off now, they're going to
[2:44:56] come out to fight him and he won't get
[2:44:58] that break. So what Joshua did? He said,
[2:44:59] "Son, stand still. Moon hang over
[2:45:01] Agelon." and he licked them up because
[2:45:04] he wanted some more time to deal with
[2:45:07] those
[2:45:08] Philistines. God help us. God help us.
[2:45:12] We say son stand still. Moon hang over
[2:45:15] there. We going to deal with those
[2:45:18] Philistines. Got to deal with them
[2:45:21] starting
[2:45:23] today. That's
[2:45:27] Ephesians. That's Ephesians spoken word
[2:45:31] speaking the word. Oh hallelujah.
[2:45:34] Hallelujah.
[2:45:35] Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. How the
[2:45:39] church go to labor pain. What about God
[2:45:41] labor pain. Hallelujah. God labor pain.
[2:45:43] Here we go. When God are you ready in
[2:45:48] his labor pain
[2:45:50] was bringing forth you. Amen. Amen.
[2:45:57] Oh, we this is good today. And it's a
[2:45:59] teaching message, but this is this is
[2:46:01] good today. I believe everybody
[2:46:02] understanding this. I just talked to you
[2:46:04] about the church going through labor
[2:46:06] pains. What you didn't know is that God,
[2:46:10] went through labor pain to bring forth
[2:46:14] you.
[2:46:15] [Applause]
[2:46:18] You see Jesus died on the cross and was
[2:46:20] finished. But God
[2:46:23] slay the lamb
[2:46:26] in his mind
[2:46:28] before the foundation of the world and
[2:46:31] before you came forth
[2:46:34] God was in travail.
[2:46:36] Oh hallelujah.
[2:46:38] That means you got to come forth. The
[2:46:41] devil is a liar.
[2:46:43] [Applause]
[2:46:44] He's messing with your mind.
[2:46:52] Let's read it. God in his labor pain,
[2:46:56] Yes, sir. was bringing forth you.
[2:46:59] Hallelujah. Knowing what you would do.
[2:47:02] Yes, sir. He positionally placed you
[2:47:04] into his own body. To be a housewife, to
[2:47:08] be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be a
[2:47:12] prophet, to be this, to be that. He
[2:47:15] placed you positionally.
[2:47:18] Amen.
[2:47:19] Amen.
[2:47:22] Businesses just burn down and build back
[2:47:25] up
[2:47:26] sometime. Build back up more powerful.
[2:47:29] And you want to tell me God can restore
[2:47:30] a son back into position better than he
[2:47:34] was before.
[2:47:39] It have preachers backslide. It have
[2:47:42] believers backslide. It have other
[2:47:44] people backslide. Praise God. And if a
[2:47:47] son step forward and God restore him,
[2:47:50] bless him, give him a gift of ministry,
[2:47:52] he can minister and preach the gospel.
[2:47:54] Jealous people have to find out he
[2:47:56] should not preach, this one shouldn't
[2:47:57] preach, that one. Who's supposed to
[2:47:58] preach? Who's supposed to be called? Hal
[2:48:02] is not man calling man. It's God calling
[2:48:05] man. Baram preach a whole message called
[2:48:08] God called man. He preached for a
[2:48:11] purpose to prove in this last day the
[2:48:13] men that God have called no man hand
[2:48:16] could be upon those men.
[2:48:19] No man going to be upon those men.
[2:48:21] That's why this church is different
[2:48:23] because we are subject to minister
[2:48:24] association, people association,
[2:48:27] believers association, message
[2:48:29] association, no association whatsoever.
[2:48:32] Oh, glory to God. We just in the word.
[2:48:36] This is a sovereign church. We do what
[2:48:38] we want to do, how we want to do it,
[2:48:41] when we want to do it. Led by the spirit
[2:48:44] to do it.
[2:48:52] Glory. Don't even think about comparing
[2:48:54] us. Hallelujah.
[2:48:57] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. We are
[2:49:00] pressing on opposition of dynamics to
[2:49:04] the mechanics. You can't bypass the
[2:49:06] upper room. Jesus said, "Behold, I send
[2:49:08] the promise of my father upon you, but
[2:49:10] tar in the city of Jerusalem." You can't
[2:49:12] remove Tar.
[2:49:14] You feel how tonging. So you move T and
[2:49:17] you tell the people, "Hey, up upper
[2:49:19] room, let me move because you see a
[2:49:22] revelation come forth. The word is
[2:49:24] inside of you. Jesus open your
[2:49:25] understanding to the scriptures. Jesus
[2:49:27] open your mind to the word. You are
[2:49:29] fine." Fine. Let Peter walk out under
[2:49:32] that anointing.
[2:49:35] When I say look him in there, Peter run
[2:49:36] for his life because there is no power
[2:49:38] inside of there. There's only fine
[2:49:41] because a man say you're fine. You're
[2:49:43] good because you and me Goliath. Yes.
[2:49:45] See no giant or no bees run you down.
[2:49:51] Nothing run you down.
[2:49:54] All you have is your own problem that
[2:49:55] you half of them you create for your own
[2:49:57] self and you're all in trial and tested.
[2:50:00] Half of them is your attitude, is your
[2:50:01] mouth, is your talk, is your ways, is
[2:50:03] your behavior bounce back and hit you,
[2:50:05] flashing inside your face. And that
[2:50:07] given you your own personal pressure.
[2:50:09] Amen. That is not wilderness yet. That's
[2:50:11] not Goliath yet. Oh, Peter run for his
[2:50:14] life. Apostle Peter, mouth champion
[2:50:16] Peter, the Lord, I bid you, bid me to
[2:50:17] come walking on the water. Peter, when
[2:50:19] the action drama start, Peter run for
[2:50:22] his life. And well, I don't know him.
[2:50:23] Deny him three times when drama really
[2:50:25] start. You see, drama wasn't starting
[2:50:26] all the time. Peter was Apostle Peter as
[2:50:29] it was without the Holy Ghost.
[2:50:30] Hallelujah. The man don't even know what
[2:50:32] spirit he's of. Bunch of them on the
[2:50:34] Matthew 10 anointing preaching the
[2:50:35] gospel. Oh, hallelujah. They have no
[2:50:38] real revelation anchor down inside of
[2:50:40] them yet because trouble was coming.
[2:50:42] Calvary was coming. Jordan was coming.
[2:50:43] Gethsemane was coming. And those guys
[2:50:45] were not prepared for that. But Jesus
[2:50:47] was prepared for that because his road
[2:50:49] was set before him. Come on, preach back
[2:50:53] with me. Let's get into second gear. Oh,
[2:50:55] hallelujah. Praise God. But watch this.
[2:50:58] The vision showed Peter converted. Oh
[2:51:01] my. The vision after you are converted.
[2:51:04] The devil want to sift you as wheat. But
[2:51:07] I see a vision. I see you delivered. I
[2:51:10] see you free. I see you anointed. I see
[2:51:14] you filled. I see the bride coming in
[2:51:17] preview again.
[2:51:23] So Jesus let Peter have it. He know give
[2:51:25] them the truth. Hallelujah. So now we
[2:51:27] hold back on people because they want to
[2:51:28] make them feel bad. We hold back on
[2:51:30] disasters. We hold back on truth. But
[2:51:32] truth is what going to set people free.
[2:51:35] Jesus didn't hold back and say boy.
[2:51:36] Peter. Okay boy. All right. Peter. Okay.
[2:51:39] Keep on pressing on.
[2:51:41] He say you deny me. Yes. Me? No. Me? No.
[2:51:44] Yes. Three times. Yes. Not just once,
[2:51:48] you know. Yes. He tell how much times
[2:51:50] too.
[2:51:51] But I see something about you.
[2:51:53] Hallelujah. Peter, I want to give you
[2:51:54] the whole scroll. You'll deny me, but
[2:51:56] you'll be converted. Hallelujah. You'll
[2:51:58] deny me, but you have a work to do. You
[2:52:00] deny me, but you have to strengthen the
[2:52:01] brethren.
[2:52:02] [Applause]
[2:52:06] What? What if Peter was one of a
[2:52:08] depression, poor me, sad, sack type of
[2:52:11] person that all he hearing is deny me,
[2:52:13] deny me, deny me, deny me. Oh God, deny
[2:52:17] me. Peter miss service for three
[2:52:20] services because he's still studying.
[2:52:22] deny me, I'll deny him because the
[2:52:24] master's word doesn't always come to
[2:52:25] pass. What happened, Peter? You didn't
[2:52:26] hear you'll be converted.
[2:52:29] What do you want to hear? Yes. What
[2:52:31] truth do you want to hear about your
[2:52:32] life? How miserable you are, how dumb
[2:52:34] you are, how sinful you are, what you
[2:52:36] want to hear about your own life, you
[2:52:37] know that yourself.
[2:52:41] But you have to be caught up in the
[2:52:42] vision.
[2:52:44] Something bigger than yourself.
[2:52:48] [Applause]
[2:52:50] If you have a vision of somebody, give
[2:52:52] $10. They're not a vision. You could ask
[2:52:54] me and I'll give you $10. Hallelujah.
[2:53:00] That is not a vision. A vision is always
[2:53:04] Hallelujah. Bigger than you.
[2:53:08] Amen. You You heard that? A vision is
[2:53:12] always bigger than you. Bigger than
[2:53:15] where you are. That's why God tell
[2:53:16] Ezekiel, "Come down. Come now, come now
[2:53:18] to the valley full of dry bones and say,
[2:53:20] "Can these bones live?"
[2:53:23] Prophesy.
[2:53:27] Against all odds, it's just bones.
[2:53:30] Hallelujah. But prophesy. Praise God.
[2:53:32] And I prophesy. Amen. And bone come to
[2:53:35] bone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I
[2:53:37] prophesy. And flesh and bone and flesh
[2:53:39] and everything else. A vision.
[2:53:42] Speak. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Yes,
[2:53:46] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When
[2:53:48] Colonel Sanders got his chicken recipe
[2:53:51] and those days America was home cooking
[2:53:53] loving
[2:53:54] people and he come with his fries and
[2:53:56] fried chicken. They told him nobody
[2:53:59] ain't leaving the home cooking to eat
[2:54:01] your fried thing. He was turned down. He
[2:54:04] was rejected and everything else.
[2:54:06] Colonel Sanders is dead and they're
[2:54:09] frying chicken like
[2:54:10] crazy all around the world because the
[2:54:13] colonel had a vision that was bigger
[2:54:16] than what they had
[2:54:18] and he stuck with it. Amen. And they
[2:54:20] still have the colonel he dead and gone.
[2:54:22] But you still see me picture the colonel
[2:54:23] with the man with the white beard.
[2:54:27] Jesus had a vision. Yes, sir.
[2:54:30] Hallelujah. But the bride saw a vision
[2:54:32] of the bride coming into view again.
[2:54:37] Brother Brandham is dead,
[2:54:40] but not division.
[2:54:44] Division is for an appointed time.
[2:54:47] [Applause]
[2:54:50] I believe division is now. I believe we
[2:54:54] are breaking.
[2:54:58] All right, sit down a minute. Sit down a
[2:55:00] minute. Oh, glory to God. We are in the
[2:55:02] word. The spirit is in the camp. Amen.
[2:55:05] One time Barab had a vision. But time
[2:55:08] being healed. You know the story. And
[2:55:10] the old woman sitting on a
[2:55:12] chair wiping her glasses resting down.
[2:55:16] He came to the house. The woman wasn't
[2:55:19] there. He said bring the baby. He prayed
[2:55:22] for the baby. The baby got worse
[2:55:25] because he said he went ahead of the
[2:55:28] vision. Yes. Yes. Yes. And when there's
[2:55:31] a vision, you have to wait for it to
[2:55:34] unfold.
[2:55:36] So you have to wait all night long
[2:55:39] waiting because he said the vision show
[2:55:41] this old lady
[2:55:43] when morning come. Granny coming with
[2:55:46] her glasses. Granny coming to the house.
[2:55:49] Amen. He can't tell her put the glasses
[2:55:51] there. Amen. That's not how it works.
[2:55:54] She got to do all of that. So when he
[2:55:57] comes in, he know the vision is nearer,
[2:56:00] the healing is nearer, deliverance is
[2:56:02] nearer, revival is nearer, Holy Ghost is
[2:56:05] nearer, breakthrough is
[2:56:07] [Applause]
[2:56:12] nearer. Your appointed time is nearer
[2:56:20] because the vision has been unfolded.
[2:56:23] Granny begin to talk. Hallelujah. And
[2:56:25] then because she come from the cold,
[2:56:27] hallelujah, into the house at warm, her
[2:56:30] glasses fogged up. Oh, hallelujah. You
[2:56:33] not hearing what I'm saying? Her glasses
[2:56:36] fogged up. So granny have to get the
[2:56:38] cloth and wipe the glass. And she wipe
[2:56:41] the glasses. Granny rest on the glasses.
[2:56:44] When she rest on, he said, "Bring the
[2:56:45] baby for me. Bring that child for me."
[2:56:49] My God, that devil, that sickness, that
[2:56:51] disease, that condition could not
[2:56:54] remain.
[2:56:55] [Applause]
[2:57:01] Baby was healed.
[2:57:03] Baby was healed. We can't go ahead of
[2:57:06] the vision. We bring a stumbling. Things
[2:57:09] will go wrong. You may be seated if we
[2:57:10] go ahead of the vision. But once you
[2:57:12] begin to see the bride coming in viewer,
[2:57:15] I'm showing you a picture of the word,
[2:57:18] not Galatians, not Hebrews, not
[2:57:20] Corinthians, but another Ephesians going
[2:57:23] to be unfolded in front your eyes.
[2:57:26] There's going to be a super church,
[2:57:28] that's in Ephesians. Seventh revival,
[2:57:30] that's in Ephesians. A five-fold
[2:57:32] ministry, that's in Ephesians.
[2:57:33] Perfection, it's in Ephesians. One mind,
[2:57:35] one accord, that's in Ephesians. One
[2:57:37] Lord, one faith, one baptism, that's in
[2:57:39] Ephesians. Press husbands press in
[2:57:41] Ephesians.
[2:57:46] Wives press
[2:57:48] into Ephesians. That is your land. That
[2:57:52] is your land.
[2:57:54] Hallelujah.
[2:57:56] Let your husband say she really loved
[2:57:58] me. Yes, Lord. Let your wife say she he
[2:58:00] really loves me. Hallelujah. He cares.
[2:58:03] Hallelujah. God cares. We were sinners
[2:58:05] and he loves so much he came down to get
[2:58:07] us. Hear love and vex and love and
[2:58:10] angry. He love much care to go beyond
[2:58:13] the sin to begin our faults to go and
[2:58:16] see our condition and say you know what
[2:58:17] I come to pick you up this morning. I
[2:58:20] come to raise you above what you have
[2:58:21] been in. All these years you have been
[2:58:23] sloppy. All these you have been lazy and
[2:58:26] slutful. But I come to let you know you
[2:58:28] don't belong there. Corinthian church is
[2:58:30] not your church. Galatian church is not
[2:58:32] your church. Amen. Hebrew church is not
[2:58:35] your church. You belong to Ephesians.
[2:58:37] And by one spirit you are baptized into
[2:58:39] that body because you don't join
[2:58:40] Ephesians. You are baptized by Holy
[2:58:43] Ghost into another Ephesians. That's how
[2:58:45] you cross Jordan. You can't join
[2:58:47] Ephesians. If he's not a group, if he's
[2:58:50] not a church name, Ephesians is one
[2:58:53] baptism. Amen. Even as there's one
[2:58:56] faith, even as there is one Lord, that
[2:58:59] is Ephesians. Do you want to belong to
[2:59:02] it? Do you want to be part of it?
[2:59:04] Because all that build on the earth
[2:59:06] shall bush the beast whose names are not
[2:59:08] written in lamb's book of life before
[2:59:10] the foundation of the world. Don't put
[2:59:12] your job before God. I know how nice
[2:59:14] your pay is. Don't put your job before
[2:59:16] God. Put God first. Oh, glory to God.
[2:59:19] Let him be your strength. Let him be
[2:59:21] your joy. Let him be your peace. Let him
[2:59:24] be your comforter. Let him be your
[2:59:26] lawyer. Let him be your
[2:59:28] [Applause]
[2:59:30] everything. Amen.
[2:59:32] Oh, thank you, Father. Hallelujah.
[2:59:35] So listen to this. Hallelujah. All the
[2:59:38] peoples, there will be millions times
[2:59:40] millions that will walk religion and be
[2:59:42] deceived. The only ones that will not be
[2:59:45] deceived. Are you ready? Are those who
[2:59:48] have come into the promised land who
[2:59:50] before the foundation of the world had
[2:59:52] their names put on land book of life and
[2:59:54] come over into the promised land and
[2:59:56] enjoying it.
[2:59:58] If you're not enjoying it, something is
[3:00:00] wrong. Hallelujah. You have to be
[3:00:02] enjoying it. Hallelujah. You have to be
[3:00:04] what? Enjoying it. But say if you're
[3:00:06] hungry and somebody give you money, you
[3:00:09] will be happy because that money is
[3:00:11] fate. That money is the purchasing power
[3:00:13] to get the bread. You don't reach the
[3:00:15] bakery yet, but you're happy because you
[3:00:17] have the purchasing power. You could
[3:00:19] shout a little bit. You could dance a
[3:00:20] little bit. All the time you had no
[3:00:22] money, but now you have the purchasing
[3:00:24] power. All you need is to find the
[3:00:25] bakery. The vision is to get to the
[3:00:27] bakery. Bakery means bread. Bakery means
[3:00:29] a pie or something like that. Get to the
[3:00:31] bakery. I'm going to get what I want
[3:00:33] because I've got the money. And that's
[3:00:34] when faith is revealed to you. That's
[3:00:36] when the mystery come down from God as
[3:00:38] the word of God and give you a
[3:00:40] revelation and bring the plainness of
[3:00:42] God. Then you could shout. Then I know
[3:00:44] when you start to shout, when you start
[3:00:46] to rejoice, when the joy of God is upon
[3:00:48] your life, I could know that you have
[3:00:50] revelation because revelation is not
[3:00:52] water. Revelation is wine. Notice those
[3:00:54] children with water. People just clap a
[3:00:56] little things like that. They shake
[3:00:57] their head like that because they
[3:00:58] understanding what the preacher is
[3:01:00] saying. But when you see revelations
[3:01:01] start to break, that is wine. Wine
[3:01:03] brings stimulation. Wine make you act
[3:01:06] unsemly. When everybody sitting, you are
[3:01:08] standing because wine is upon your life.
[3:01:10] When everybody hands down, your hands up
[3:01:12] because wine is doing something for you.
[3:01:15] Jesus turned water into wine. It doesn't
[3:01:18] have to say water only. We could turn it
[3:01:20] into wine today. Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[3:01:25] Oh, let me see if I could wrap up here.
[3:01:29] Oh, glory to God.
[3:01:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:01:36] Oh, glory to God. Glory to God.
[3:01:38] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. What
[3:01:43] says, "Not for a show, but that they
[3:01:45] might see the emphasis is here that this
[3:01:48] is the thing that bridges between
[3:01:49] denomination and glory land." Oh
[3:01:52] hallelujah. Oh blessed be the name of
[3:01:54] the Lord. Almost finished here. Oh
[3:01:56] blessed be the name of the Lord. So
[3:01:58] listen to this. Hear what we have
[3:01:59] promised. Brother Brandham said angelic
[3:02:02] beings is ordained ministers of God to
[3:02:05] come to the earth to bear record of God
[3:02:07] and they work through mortal beings just
[3:02:10] as they did through Daniel. And God gift
[3:02:14] here we go is the spirit of God in the
[3:02:17] form of an angel. Yes sir. Hallelujah.
[3:02:21] And he is here tonight to minister to
[3:02:23] you people. I'm only his mouthpiece and
[3:02:26] everyone assure of that and worship God
[3:02:29] and give him praise and be humble.
[3:02:31] Hallelujah. God gift is the spirit of
[3:02:33] God that come down in the form of an
[3:02:37] angel. So we are promised for the
[3:02:39] Ephesians. It's not man's ministry. It
[3:02:42] will be the ministry of Jesus Christ in
[3:02:44] the form of apostles, pastors, teachers,
[3:02:48] evangelists. God positionally placing
[3:02:51] men into that position where Christ
[3:02:53] could be manifested. Hallelujah. It's
[3:02:56] not the man. It's going to be Christ
[3:02:58] manifested in the man. So we are looking
[3:03:01] for God to place his spirit in the form
[3:03:05] of an angel. That's a promise of a gift
[3:03:08] of the ministry to the ministry by the
[3:03:10] ministry. Isn't that right? So this is
[3:03:13] what it's all about. Now watch adoption.
[3:03:15] I'm going to close up please. Adoption.
[3:03:19] Is that right, brother? Say waiting.
[3:03:21] God, are you ready? Trying to place his
[3:03:24] church in position to manifest himself.
[3:03:28] Getting one that he can work through and
[3:03:30] say, "There is my spirit flowing
[3:03:34] freely." It is amazing that ministers
[3:03:37] don't quote this. It's amazing that
[3:03:40] they're trying to bring to the people
[3:03:41] the more mysteries, knowledge,
[3:03:44] information, the more they are
[3:03:47] messengers of God. But all the
[3:03:50] revelation is to bring us into behavior
[3:03:53] that God could put us in a position that
[3:03:55] God can say, "There is my spirit
[3:04:00] flowing
[3:04:02] freely." Because what's your promise?
[3:04:05] The Holy Spirit. Amen. What's the
[3:04:07] promised land? The Holy Spirit. So
[3:04:11] ultimately when all adds up, it's to get
[3:04:14] the spirit inside of you. What's the
[3:04:17] work of the ministry? To pour the
[3:04:20] virtues into the people. The minister
[3:04:23] cannot pour what he don't have.
[3:04:26] Hallelujah. What's Ephesians? While
[3:04:29] Peter had spake these words, the Holy
[3:04:33] Ghost fell upon them that heard the
[3:04:37] word. The watering spirit was upon
[3:04:40] Peter. So when he spoke, the water was
[3:04:43] right there to water the seed that he
[3:04:46] was preaching. Are you with me? The
[3:04:49] mechanics and dynamics was together. Oh,
[3:04:52] give the Lord a shout of praise. Are you
[3:04:54] with me? Peter wasn't just preaching the
[3:04:58] word. The water was there. So while
[3:05:01] Peter spoke the word, the spirit grabbed
[3:05:04] it and they were filled with the Holy
[3:05:06] Ghost. May God fill you with the Holy
[3:05:09] Ghost. God bless you. The Ephesians
[3:05:12] bride is coming into view. May the Lord
[3:05:15] bless you.
[3:05:21] Oh, give him praise this morning.
