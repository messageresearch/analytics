[15:01] in the
[15:02] new testament
[15:04] amen
[15:12] amen
[15:14] so uh reading from saint john chapter 15
[15:17] amen and we also want to read from
[15:19] matthew 25 14.
[15:22] as a matter of fact we'll read from
[15:23] matthew first
[15:25] so you could find booker saint matthew
[15:26] first
[15:28] and that's chapter 25
[15:31] and uh verse 14
[15:36] amen and then you'll find saint john
[15:38] after amen
[15:39] so praise god
[15:42] hallelujah matthew 25 verse 14
[15:47] and uh
[15:49] this is jesus given a parable here
[15:52] after that he had spoken about the
[15:54] ten versions
[15:56] he goes into this story here speaking
[15:58] about the coming of the lord and so on
[16:00] and this is matthew 25 verse 14
[16:04] and it says for the kingdom of heaven is
[16:05] as a man
[16:07] traveling into a far country
[16:10] who called his own servants
[16:12] and delivered unto them his goods
[16:15] and onto one he gave five talents to
[16:17] another two
[16:19] and to another one
[16:21] to every man
[16:22] according to his several ability
[16:26] and straight away took his journey so he
[16:29] left amen
[16:30] and then he that had received the five
[16:33] talents went
[16:34] and traded with the same and made them
[16:36] other five talents
[16:38] and likewise he that received two
[16:41] he also gained another two
[16:44] but he that had received one
[16:46] went and digged in the earth
[16:48] and hid his lord's money
[16:51] verse 19 after a long time the lord of
[16:53] the of those servants cometh and
[16:55] recognized with them
[16:57] and so he that had re had received five
[16:59] talents came
[17:01] and brought uh other five talents saying
[17:03] lord thou deliver us unto me five
[17:05] talents behold i have gained beside them
[17:07] five talents more his lord said unto him
[17:10] well done thou good and faithful servant
[17:13] thou has been faithful over a few things
[17:15] and i will make the ruler over many
[17:17] things enter thou into the joy of the
[17:18] lord
[17:19] he also that had received two talents
[17:21] came and said lord thou deliver us unto
[17:22] me two talents behold i have gained uh
[17:25] gained two other talents beside them his
[17:27] lord said unto him well done
[17:29] uh good and faithful servant thou has
[17:32] been faithful over a few things and i
[17:33] will make thee ruler over many things
[17:35] enter thou into the joy of the lord
[17:38] then
[17:38] he that had received the one talent came
[17:41] and said lord
[17:42] i knew thee that thou art a hard man a
[17:44] hard man reaping where thou hast not
[17:47] sown
[17:48] and gathering with our has not strong
[17:50] and i was afraid and went and hid thy
[17:52] talent in the earth
[17:54] law
[17:55] there thou hast that is dying
[17:58] and as lord answered and said unto him
[18:00] thou wicked and slaughterful servant i
[18:03] knew is that i reap where i sowed not
[18:04] and gathered where i not strawed
[18:07] uh that take the um though orders to
[18:09] have put my money to the exchanges
[18:12] and then at my coming i should have
[18:13] received mine own with usury
[18:16] take therefore the talent from him
[18:18] and give it unto him which hath ten
[18:21] talents
[18:22] uh for to everyone that hath
[18:25] shall be given and he that hath
[18:28] he shall have abundance
[18:30] but from him that hath not shall be
[18:32] taken away even that which he hath
[18:36] and cast ye the unprofitable servant
[18:39] into the outer darkness
[18:41] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[18:43] teeth i know you want to uh we want to
[18:45] turn on to saint john 15 and reading
[18:47] from 1 verse 1

[21:49] hallelujah
[21:51] hallelujah that's who you are
[21:53] amen amen isn't that right
[21:55] hallelujah just before i begin you man i
[21:59] i think about friday i went out with the
[22:02] family and everything and i think we
[22:03] went uh went out went to the beach and
[22:05] so on just went strolling for a walk
[22:08] and um
[22:09] and we met up with a guy
[22:11] i think he was from another
[22:13] i don't know i don't know what kind of a
[22:15] denomination he was from
[22:17] but um you know he was talking to us and
[22:19] so on
[22:20] talking about the lord he just kind of
[22:22] pulled up alongside us and and we were
[22:24] just talking and fellowshipping about
[22:25] about jesus amen
[22:27] and um this man he was
[22:30] real excited
[22:31] about about god or jesus about about
[22:34] about the word
[22:36] he was about sad about the scriptures
[22:37] excited about the bible and you know it
[22:40] was it was such a thing to see because
[22:42] you don't see a lot of people like that
[22:44] these days
[22:46] you know he didn't ask me what church i
[22:48] went to up to now i met him we spoke
[22:50] about 15 20 minutes or something i think
[22:52] something like that not to know he
[22:53] hasn't asked me what church i go to or
[22:55] where i fellowship we was just talking
[22:57] on the word amen
[22:59] amen and enjoying each other's company
[23:02] enjoying each other's fellowship
[23:04] my god and we could begin to talk to him
[23:06] and so on and he began to say brother i
[23:08] tell you he said sometimes the word
[23:10] become a fought and he said sometimes i
[23:13] just he said i just can't sit still
[23:15] he said he said when the word come forth
[23:16] to touch power and such anointing you
[23:18] say you just want to jump up
[23:20] and you just want to scream and you just
[23:22] want to shake his fist in the air and
[23:23] say come on preach that word preach that
[23:26] word
[23:28] and i'm almost 100 percent sure that
[23:30] this man is hearing nothing about seven
[23:32] thunders
[23:33] about perfection about adoption
[23:37] about a fifo ministry about a prophet
[23:40] about our apostle i don't think he's
[23:42] hearing any of this stuff but he's so
[23:44] excited about god
[23:45] and i begin to think wow he's got amen
[23:49] what we call the bare necessities
[23:51] he's hearing amen what we call the bare
[23:53] minimum amen just the basic fundamental
[23:56] gospel and yet with that he is so
[23:58] excited
[23:59] i begin to think what about us
[24:02] what about we who are fat and sassy what
[24:05] about we who are getting a hundred
[24:07] percent
[24:09] a hundred percent every time
[24:11] every sunday every thursday
[24:14] my god you have a meal in the barrel you
[24:18] have oil in the cruise
[24:20] every time
[24:22] on the button praise god
[24:24] oh hallelujah you have no excuse this
[24:26] morning
[24:27] not to shout and praise god you have no
[24:30] excuse not to lift up your voice oh and
[24:33] give praise unto god forever and ever
[24:36] and ever and ever
[24:38] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[24:40] oh hallelujah
[24:42] to hear what we hear
[24:44] and to see what we see
[24:46] amen so much we're benefiting from we're
[24:48] so thankful for this ministry that god
[24:50] has given us amen by means of
[24:53] brotherhood amen and and so on and bring
[24:55] in the word hallelujah isn't that right
[24:57] we're thankful to have a pastor after
[24:59] god don't choose him hallelujah isn't
[25:01] that right are you thankful this morning
[25:04] amen
[25:06] to keep us on the street and narrow amen
[25:08] to keep the messiah ship straight that's
[25:10] what it's all about amen hallelujah hey
[25:13] man amen so we're here to earnestly
[25:15] contend this morning amen
[25:17] please god so i said that to set the
[25:19] tone amen praise god so you praise you
[25:21] worship you stay in the atmosphere you
[25:23] stay in the spirit
[25:25] i feel god wants to speak this this
[25:27] morning
[25:28] and he gave me this thought here about
[25:30] the story you just read here
[25:33] concerning uh
[25:34] the parable of the talents
[25:36] and i know that many people
[25:38] refer to the story in many ways some
[25:41] people call it parable of the talent
[25:43] some people call it parable of the five
[25:45] talents or whatever
[25:47] and there's also another account of the
[25:48] story in saint luke
[25:50] uh which talks about a servant who went
[25:51] away but i want to take it to the
[25:53] context of saint uh of saint matthew
[25:57] because uh in the context here in which
[25:59] jesus related story he was actually uh
[26:02] in a chapter before or prior to this
[26:05] with matthew 24 where he was on the
[26:08] mount of olives isn't that right and he
[26:10] was speaking to the disciples about when
[26:11] the end shall come it's not right
[26:13] so he's speaking about the end of the uh
[26:15] uh the end of the world and so on and uh
[26:18] the coming of the lord so it's in this
[26:21] context that we are taking this story
[26:22] this morning because uh we believe uh
[26:25] that we are in the time of the coming of
[26:26] the lord isn't that right
[26:28] hallelujah hallelujah so we want to draw
[26:30] from uh this context this morning amen
[26:33] so that's why i chose saint matthew
[26:35] amen's account of the story amen because
[26:38] prior to that uh he was talking about
[26:40] the ten virgins isn't that right
[26:42] five wise and five are foolish
[26:44] amen hallelujah isn't that right
[26:47] amen but we want to take the context of
[26:49] the story here so without further ado my
[26:51] title this morning
[26:53] uh
[26:55] the inspiration and how it came to me or
[26:57] how god quickened it to me rather
[26:59] the unprofitable servant
[27:01] that's my title this morning amen
[27:04] and my subject is hearing is my father
[27:06] glorifying that ye bear much fruit
[27:10] my inspiration
[27:12] is sealer
[27:13] pause
[27:14] think on this
[27:15] amen amen hallelujah
[27:18] so
[27:19] we're here to do some thinking this
[27:20] morning amen
[27:22] hallelujah we had to take inventory this
[27:24] morning
[27:25] every once in a while it's good to step
[27:26] back
[27:27] and look at your life
[27:29] and see if it measures up to the gospel
[27:32] isn't that right every once in a while
[27:34] it's good to stop
[27:36] put down the tablet
[27:37] put down the smartphone stop
[27:39] think for a second
[27:41] is my life worthy of the gospel
[27:43] hallelujah isn't that right is it truly
[27:45] measuring up
[27:47] if the lord were to return would i be
[27:49] unprofitable
[27:50] amen these are the questions that
[27:52] started coming out to me when i began to
[27:54] study this text here amen
[27:57] so let me begin this morning amen
[27:59] so in the story i seen matthew amen uh
[28:02] we read about it five talents isn't that
[28:04] right
[28:05] and he's speaking about the coming of
[28:06] the lord in this context here
[28:08] hallelujah
[28:10] amen and then so now
[28:13] i began to study this parable i began to
[28:15] read it over and over and over and then
[28:17] every time i read it something else
[28:19] would jump out at me
[28:20] amen
[28:22] and um
[28:24] when he begins the story here jesus
[28:25] begins to talk begins to speak he says
[28:28] first thing he introduces he says that
[28:32] this man went off our country isn't that
[28:34] right
[28:35] and he brought forth his servants
[28:38] isn't that right
[28:39] he didn't just bring anybody
[28:41] he didn't just bring the man on the
[28:43] street isn't that right
[28:44] he didn't just bring against her or
[28:47] you know just any kind of person
[28:49] amen this man brought forth his servants
[28:53] and the word servant if you look it up
[28:55] it means a follower or it means a person
[28:59] who expresses submission
[29:01] or recognizance somebody who recognizes
[29:04] authority isn't that right
[29:06] a follower of the lord
[29:08] so these are the men that came towards
[29:10] the lord that was written in this story
[29:12] isn't that right it wasn't just anybody
[29:14] they were all silvers
[29:17] it's not are you following me this
[29:18] morning
[29:19] many men hallelujah praise god so they
[29:22] were servants isn't that right
[29:24] and these servants of the lord were
[29:26] given talents
[29:28] and from what i began to research when i
[29:30] looked up the word talent because you
[29:32] always hear the word talent and it's a
[29:34] common misconception that our people
[29:36] would say
[29:37] that a talent is like an ability like he
[29:40] gave somebody an ability to do something
[29:42] which is incorrect
[29:44] um
[29:45] he gave them the talents according to
[29:47] their ability
[29:49] amen isn't that right
[29:51] but the talent itself wasn't uh like an
[29:54] ability he didn't give them an ability
[29:56] he gave what he gave according to their
[29:58] ability
[29:59] amen
[30:00] okay so we're rightly placing the word
[30:02] here this morning amen
[30:04] so what is the talent so i looked it up
[30:06] uh because the word intrigued me and
[30:08] what it really means uh means is that a
[30:10] talent represents a sum of money right
[30:13] now in those days i think they would
[30:14] weigh stuff to measure the value of it
[30:18] so a talent of gold would be worth such
[30:20] and such a talent of bronze would be
[30:23] worth such and such a talent of silver
[30:25] and of course obviously a talent of gold
[30:27] would be more uh valuable than a talent
[30:29] of silver or maybe prawns or brass or
[30:31] whatever amen
[30:32] so this is how they measured
[30:35] uh
[30:37] possessions
[30:38] amen
[30:39] and the story goes on to say
[30:42] that this lord i know i'm building up to
[30:45] it real slow but i'm getting somewhere
[30:48] so sailor think on this
[30:51] amen
[30:53] so
[30:54] you know and this is what a talent is so
[30:56] it's really a large sum of possessions
[30:58] that he gave to these men
[31:01] and um
[31:02] when they they did the math i ran the
[31:04] numbers and what they were saying was
[31:06] that a talent is actually worth 20 years
[31:10] of a day's laborers wage
[31:12] so when you run the numbers that's
[31:14] almost about three-quarter of a million
[31:15] dollars
[31:17] okay so we're talking about a lot of
[31:18] money here
[31:19] amen amen it's not right so even the one
[31:22] who got one
[31:24] had a lot of money
[31:26] even the one who had one talent
[31:28] had a lot to do with
[31:30] amen it wasn't that he just had a little
[31:32] coin or a little um what you call a
[31:34] shilling he didn't he didn't know that
[31:36] he had that he had a lot of money
[31:39] at three quarter of a million dollars he
[31:41] could do a lot with that i wish i had
[31:42] that right now
[31:45] and so you know so this is where we're
[31:47] taking the context from so i'm trying to
[31:48] paint the picture here
[31:50] so you can get an idea of why this lord
[31:53] was so angry
[31:54] when he came back from his his journey
[31:58] okay
[31:59] all right
[32:00] so then he okay so where are we at here
[32:02] now
[32:04] so
[32:05] why did i say that so what what the lord
[32:08] did he divided his possessions among
[32:09] them and he departed isn't that right
[32:11] and he divided his possessions among
[32:13] them they were great possessions
[32:16] the five talents of two towns and one
[32:17] talent they were all
[32:19] great possessions
[32:20] and i can't help but think
[32:22] how god is so merciful to us
[32:25] that he would give us great possessions
[32:28] by means of his word
[32:31] say amen somebody
[32:32] amen amen what we take light in church
[32:35] what do we take light for books and
[32:37] tapes
[32:39] is great possessions
[32:47] oh we're going to say some things this
[32:48] morning
[32:49] what we take like what we take for
[32:51] granted every sunday
[32:53] every thursday even every day of the
[32:54] week
[32:55] is a great possession
[32:58] hallelujah
[32:59] some of us take
[33:01] the word for granted isn't that right
[33:03] what he has given us in this hour and
[33:05] this season
[33:06] god has actually given us an opportunity
[33:08] to escape
[33:10] say amen someone
[33:11] an opportunity escape the darkness
[33:14] an opportunity to escape the world and
[33:16] its corruption
[33:18] hallelujah isn't that right how does he
[33:20] do that he brings a word to you
[33:22] amen and then he raises a standard how
[33:25] by taking that same word
[33:27] and making it more positive
[33:30] making it more positive making it more
[33:32] real to you
[33:34] isn't that right
[33:36] he can't anoint anything else he's not
[33:38] looking for anything else he says my
[33:40] word shall not return to me void
[33:43] but it shall accomplish
[33:45] the purpose that i have sent forth
[33:48] for it to accomplish
[33:50] so if god wants to accomplish anything
[33:52] this morning
[33:54] the first thing he has to send is his
[33:56] word
[33:58] same and somebody
[34:00] hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[34:04] look at yourself for granted in you is a
[34:06] seed
[34:07] in you is a seed of what you are to
[34:09] become
[34:11] and that seed is the word of god
[34:13] and that seed is why you are believing
[34:16] what you are believing this morning
[34:18] according to your abilities this morning
[34:20] so much has been granted to you this
[34:22] morning

[34:38] this hour

[34:44] it was a word of god
[34:45] that defeated satan in the wilderness
[34:48] no spirit
[34:50] no signs
[34:51] no wonders
[34:53] nothing that you could look upon to
[34:54] desire

[35:06] god took that word
[35:08] hallelujah and did something to the
[35:11] devil
[35:12] that to this day he still has headaches
[35:14] about it
[35:15] to this day satan still has nightmares
[35:17] about it
[35:19] what jesus did to him in the wilderness
[35:21] with just the word alone
[35:25] oh hallelujah and somebody same

[40:28] when he died
[40:30] and isaiah was leaning on him all the

[41:42] of uziah it was too scary to look at
[41:45] there was no place for him left to go
[41:48] there was nobody left to talk to
[41:50] he had to go and find god
[41:53] in the temple
[41:54] i wonder that's why you come this
[41:56] morning
[41:57] there's no place for you to run this

[42:35] laid before the altar of god he knew he
[42:37] couldn't go the same way anymore
[42:40] he knew he couldn't continue in his sin
[42:42] in his filth in his mind and his
[42:45] thinking
[42:46] he began to lean on god and on all of a
[42:49] sudden he had come to cold from off the
[42:51] altar here come the seraphs with the
[42:54] tongues of fire
[42:56] to cleanse his lips oh i made a seraph's
[42:59] come blasting through here this morning
[43:02] and baptized you with the holy ghost and
[43:05] fire
[43:11] oh hallelujah

[43:32] anointing here this morning that is
[43:34] accompanied by seraphs that is
[43:36] accompanied by anointed angels of the
[43:39] most high god

[43:43] morning oh hallelujah hallelujah

[44:07] great possession
[44:10] let's come back to this here now
[44:12] my god
[44:14] where are we at
[44:17] god has given us great possessions isn't
[44:18] that right
[44:20] hallelujah we take it for granted
[44:23] coming here in church i want to praise
[44:25] halfway we want to come late we want to
[44:26] do what we want to do and yet you have
[44:28] great possessions
[44:31] sitting on it
[44:32] sleeping on it
[44:36] i wonder what god thinks
[44:41] we so self absorb
[44:43] think about ourselves
[44:45] think about our needs and what we want
[44:47] why don't you think about god for a
[44:48] change
[44:51] see amen somebody
[44:53] he's so self-centered
[44:56] what a condition to be in
[45:00] what god has given us what is great
[45:02] possession see and god sends his prophet
[45:05] uh before the great and terrible day of
[45:06] the lord isn't that right
[45:08] it gives us an opportunity to change
[45:10] an opportunity to bring forth fruit
[45:13] isn't that right
[45:15] hallelujah
[45:16] amen isn't that right so your life has
[45:18] to produce something
[45:20] you can't say you're coming to this
[45:22] church here and it's just gonna pass
[45:23] through no no it's not gonna work like
[45:26] that you have to produce something
[45:29] you have to have something to show for
[45:31] otherwise what's the purpose
[45:33] what's the purpose of you coming here
[45:35] why are you coming here for why you're
[45:37] wasting your time don't waste your time
[45:39] time runs out
[45:42] you won't always have all the time in
[45:44] the world we always have all the time to
[45:47] do this and to that sooner or later like
[45:49] but oversaid time runs out
[45:52] and then when time runs out you can't do
[45:54] anything about it again
[45:55] when the lord came back to his servants
[45:57] to find out the report about what they
[46:00] were doing with the talents what they
[46:02] were doing with the possessions that he
[46:04] gave them
[46:06] one of them had an evil report
[46:09] isn't that right time had already run
[46:11] out
[46:12] it was time for them now to give an
[46:13] account
[46:14] it was time for them now to uh own up to
[46:17] what they were doing all them years
[46:19] hallelujah in the lord's absence isn't
[46:21] that right

[47:23] that's what you're supposed to be doing
[47:24] not sitting there just doing nothing
[47:27] taking up space
[47:29] nobody likes a a tree that doesn't bring
[47:31] forth fruit
[47:32] think about it
[47:34] one time my dad i think he had a
[47:36] some seeds and he decided to plant it i
[47:39] think he thought it was a lime or lemon
[47:40] or something
[47:41] and he put it in the center of the yard
[47:43] he said well this thing is going to be
[47:44] the price of my garden
[47:46] and you put it in there and it begin to
[47:48] grow about six months to a year two
[47:49] years
[47:50] and every year looking forward for
[47:52] something from the tree
[47:56] today could be the day oh this could be
[47:57] the season this could be a year now
[48:00] and nothing
[48:03] not even a blossom
[48:08] obviously over time we realized that the
[48:10] tree was useless
[48:13] so we uprooted it
[48:15] dug it out
[48:16] and something else took its place
[48:20] amen
[48:22] what's the point of that
[48:24] nobody likes that not even jesus likes
[48:26] that
[48:27] one time jesus come walking down with
[48:29] his disciples
[48:30] and he went up to a tree
[48:32] it was a fig tree
[48:34] and he looked at a tree
[48:36] and a tree brought forth no fruit
[48:38] and he was hungry
[48:40] and in his hunger
[48:42] jesus looked at the tree and cursed the
[48:44] tree to the roots
[48:47] that thing vexed jesus so much
[48:51] that he literally cut it off from the
[48:52] life itself
[48:56] isn't that right
[48:57] i'm trying to show you how much god
[48:59] hates on
[49:00] fruitfulness god hates
[49:03] somebody who is unprofitable
[49:06] somebody who is not bringing forth as
[49:09] they should
[49:10] is not doing as they should he said
[49:12] every vine that bring it forth i'll
[49:15] purge it that it bring forth more fruit

[50:16] a dog know when you love him
[50:18] a dog a dog a simple animal knows when
[50:21] you love it
[50:23] he'll come wagging his tail because
[50:24] you're vibrating something
[50:26] your life is emanating something five
[50:28] feet away from the animal he could feel
[50:30] that presence coming off of you
[50:32] whether it's an evil presence a good
[50:33] prayer he could tell he's not a fool god
[50:35] put something in him to pick that up
[50:38] isn't that right
[50:39] hallelujah and the devil will know when
[50:41] you are vibrating something different
[50:45] say man zambani
[50:47] even the devil

[51:42] his mouth praise god hallelujah
[51:44] hallelujah but that's what uh he's going
[51:46] to get in this end time but because
[51:48] they're going to be some sons of god
[51:50] there are going to be some daughters of
[51:51] god that are going to stand for him
[51:53] they are going to live for him
[51:55] they are going to live the life of jesus
[51:57] christ

[52:12] follow
[52:13] stem that belief and mining they shall
[52:16] cast our devils they shall heal the sick
[52:19] raise the dead
[52:20] they shall speak in other tongues if
[52:22] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[52:25] harm them praise god
[52:27] that is the word of god that is the
[52:29] fruit you are going to produce
[52:36] oh same as somebody
[52:39] hallelujah
[52:42] email
[52:43] genesis 128.
[52:45] god spoke in the beginning he said let's
[52:46] make man in our inaudible likeness
[52:49] when he made that man what did he do he
[52:51] said let that man be fruitful
[52:53] and multiply
[52:54] and replenish the earth
[52:56] and subdue it and take dominion over it
[52:59] and let him take over let him take
[53:01] charge let him take rulership
[53:04] be fruitful
[53:05] that's what he told the first man
[53:08] hallelujah hallelujah before they were
[53:10] anywhere created he told that first man
[53:12] that's birdman genesis one man he told
[53:14] them be fruitful
[53:16] multiply
[53:17] replenish the earth in other words make
[53:20] some more ones like me
[53:22] isn't that right
[53:23] hallelujah isn't that right because in
[53:25] that one sun the seed sun what other
[53:28] suns to come forth isn't that right
[53:30] to be in that same image
[53:32] hallelujah and if he had begun to speak
[53:34] those sons into existence we all know
[53:37] that we would be here in that same
[53:38] perfectness
[53:40] isn't that right he was supposed to
[53:42] speak us and we will comfort
[53:44] because in that sea lay other seeds
[53:48] isn't that right
[53:50] you look at one seed you tell itself
[53:52] it's just one seed
[53:53] but in that one seed has the potential
[53:56] to bring forth other seeds just like
[53:58] itself
[54:00] but it has to be in the right condition
[54:03] it has to be in the right environment
[54:05] something has to happen to that seed it
[54:07] has to go through a process
[54:09] a process of death
[54:11] a process of rotting a process of
[54:13] forming isn't that right and then the
[54:15] blade come up and then the process is
[54:18] isn't that right coming on to the fruit
[54:20] again
[54:29] so if adam was to speak isn't that right
[54:32] he was to produce more sons
[54:34] like him isn't that right
[54:36] we all know that he got cut off from it
[54:38] lost his inheritance hallelujah the
[54:41] devil didn't
[54:43] leave the tree to grow long enough for
[54:44] it to get into that spot
[54:46] where he could begin to produce more
[54:48] suns
[54:48] hardly because he can handle more suns
[54:50] like adam no no no no
[54:52] adam was too powerful to contend to it
[54:54] that's why he come through eve
[54:56] that's why he come through the
[54:57] by-product you couldn't go to adam
[55:02] shame and somebody
[55:04] oh hallelujah
[55:07] the devil saw that thing he wanted to
[55:09] cut it off
[55:10] he saw a family unit
[55:12] if she saw a unit moving in the
[55:14] direction of god
[55:15] hallelujah and he said let me cut that
[55:17] thing off before it gets to a place
[55:19] where i can't control it
[55:20] so he decided to slip his interpretation
[55:22] in there
[55:23] we all know that that's how man fell
[55:26] holly isn't that right
[55:27] and through that fall it produced two
[55:29] sons
[55:30] cain and abel
[55:32] isn't that right
[55:33] hallelujah there was a man in his fallen
[55:35] condition
[55:37] and i believe uh adam
[55:39] sometimes i guess he would talk to his
[55:41] sons like any good father would
[55:44] and tell his sons about the garden
[55:46] and about how things used to be
[55:48] and about the kind of power he had
[55:50] and the kind of authority he had
[55:52] and the presence of god like it was
[55:54] there
[55:55] in the cool of the evening when god
[55:56] would come down to speak to him
[55:59] abra amen and cain were listening to
[56:01] endless messages
[56:04] that that adam had to talk about the gun
[56:07] almost every message was about the
[56:08] garden almost every message was about
[56:10] amen power and speaking and the spoken
[56:13] word and anointing in
[56:18] same man somebody
[56:21] adam
[56:22] departed unto them great possessions
[56:33] same man somebody the word is breaking
[56:35] this morning
[56:37] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[56:40] he departed unto them great possessions
[56:42] they might seem like much to you and i
[56:44] but those stories told of a redemption
[56:47] those stories were told about how man
[56:49] was to come back to this spot
[56:51] hallelujah to come back to this mountain
[56:54] to worship god
[56:56] in his trueness and his fullness in his
[56:58] likeness and his being
[57:00] oh my hallelujah
[57:02] adam cain and abel they were given great
[57:04] possessions
[57:06] and he and they come a time when god say

[57:54] something nice to look at something
[57:55] pleasant to taste
[57:57] but god rejected that thing
[58:00] because they were not about god
[58:02] they were not they were not the product
[58:04] of what adam was trying to present to
[58:06] them all along
[58:08] that wasn't what what god was looking
[58:10] for
[58:11] god was looking for wasn't looking for
[58:12] cain's natural ability god wasn't
[58:14] looking for cain's commonness god was
[58:16] looking for cain's hard work and and and
[58:19] and you know this kind of thing natural

[1:04:09] different kind of a ministry what was he
