[14:05] here
[14:07] called us by name predestinated us
[14:10] before we
[14:11] even had a consciousness or a
[14:13] realization of who we are and whose we
[14:15] are and we
[14:16] thank you tonight lord for preserving
[14:18] our lives lord and for
[14:20] giving us through your grace lord the
[14:23] opportunity to see

[14:39] express our gratitude enough
[14:41] lord we sometimes make attempts we use
[14:46] different words but if we really were to

[14:49] and consider lord how much of a blessing
[14:52] you have been to us
[14:54] lord even when we did wrong even when we
[14:58] lord would have messed up and when we

[15:37] lord you continue to see the potential
[15:39] in us you look
[15:40] lord pass our present situation and see
[15:43] the seed

[17:13] do and have not done
[17:15] lord we lay our lives at your feet and
[17:17] we come to
[17:18] the sacred scriptures the word to see
[17:20] how we reflect to this word to see how
[17:23] our behaviors and different situations
[17:25] different lord opportunities that may
[17:27] come to us
[17:28] lord and if we lord could take this book
[17:31] as an example
[17:32] of how we should live because this book
[17:33] is you so father if there's anyone sick
[17:35] in our midst tonight may
[17:37] your healing virtue your reign of the
[17:39] presence of the lord fall upon them in

[17:43] lord establish our altars in our homes
[17:45] and on our lives and
[17:47] lord you said we could preach too much
[17:49] we could sing too much but we can never
[17:51] pray too much father i just feel led
[17:53] right now to
[17:54] lord to take this this time to lord to
[17:58] call upon your name and to put
[18:00] you first lord lord there are so many
[18:02] needs
[18:03] lord and lord we are needy people lord
[18:06] yes we are gonna get into the word but
[18:09] father you said we

[18:12] and
[18:13] lord our hearts lord there are so many
[18:15] needs in the church that
[18:17] lord may be expressed and there are
[18:18] those needs that are not even expressed
[18:20] lord
[18:21] lord may you minister to every situation
[18:23] tonight lord you know the
[18:24] situations that i don't know you know
[18:26] the situations that lord we can never
[18:28] understand that your people go through
[18:30] and by your
[18:31] grace and your wisdom and by your
[18:33] decision and your sovereignty
[18:35] lord you pass each of us through our own
[18:37] journeys to come to you
[18:39] lord some through the water some through
[18:41] the fire some to the flood lord but
[18:43] lord all through that blood father so
[18:46] father
[18:47] lord may you lord meet each of us lord
[18:50] at the point of our needs lord we commit
[18:52] the service tonight into your hands in
[18:54] the precious name of jesus christ amen
[18:56] and amen and amen
[18:58] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[18:59] here one more time
[19:01] in the presence of the lord the bible
[19:04] said where there are two or three
[19:05] gathered
[19:06] in his name there he is in the midst and
[19:09] we thank god for his love
[19:11] for preserving life for bringing us back
[19:13] one more time
[19:15] and it's not something that we could
[19:16] ever take for granted
[19:18] um we are not promised tomorrow so we
[19:21] are so grateful
[19:22] uh to be here right now and to take full
[19:26] use and to redeem the time and take full
[19:28] advantage
[19:29] of the opportunities that are given to
[19:30] us uh to be
[19:32] better christians to be better sons to
[19:34] be better daughters to be
[19:36] better men women better servants better
[19:39] examples
[19:40] and to raise above the mediocrity that
[19:45] has become so pervasive and so normal in
[19:47] this world that we live in and we
[19:49] realize that as we look through
[19:50] scripture and we look through the word
[19:51] of god
[19:52] god is not about average and mediocre
[19:55] and halfway and
[19:56] by chance and by accident he's a god of
[19:58] perfection
[19:59] you know when he was finished after each
[20:02] day in genesis he said it is good it is
[20:04] good
[20:04] it is good it's not it was poke or poke
[20:07] it's not it was okay
[20:08] it's not it it could pass it was good he
[20:10] was satisfied he was pleased
[20:13] and through scripture you see this type
[20:15] and this parallel
[20:16] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[20:18] pleased that god wants to be pleased
[20:21] with our behavior with our conduct with
[20:23] our attitude
[20:25] with how we deal with different
[20:26] situations and through
[20:28] the word we realize that situations will
[20:30] come to us to try us to test us
[20:32] not because god feeling tries or
[20:34] testifies but over would say
[20:36] but it is to ensure that the metal and
[20:38] the quality of our character
[20:40] is being honed for leadership you know
[20:43] and last week
[20:44] by the grace of god we started to look
[20:46] at joseph and
[20:48] it is it is a simple story many
[20:51] know it many have studied it but through
[20:53] that simple story as it unfolds
[20:56] we see the character of a man being
[20:58] molded and
[20:59] many of us in the same situation
[21:03] may be inclined to respond differently
[21:06] you know and sometimes you only know
[21:08] what's in you
[21:10] when a situation arises and
[21:13] that understanding is what gives
[21:16] rise to how god has to operate because
[21:19] if
[21:20] everything your daily life your daily
[21:22] situations
[21:23] are to your expectation then there is
[21:26] nothing
[21:26] to bring out the parts of you that you
[21:28] don't know exist
[21:30] and you would surprise yourself what's
[21:32] locked up in you that situations have to
[21:34] come
[21:35] to raise up you know there are people
[21:37] who who never thought
[21:38] that they would backslide they were
[21:39] people who never thought they would make
[21:41] certain mistakes there are people who
[21:42] never thought they would succeed they
[21:44] didn't even realize that success was in
[21:45] them
[21:46] and it was crisis it was desperation it
[21:49] was
[21:49] some situation that that that sparked
[21:53] a response in them an attitude in them
[21:56] that led to them being where they're at
[21:57] and uh for
[21:59] for for those who have been along this
[22:01] journey with us
[22:02] i i i am one who looks for the practical
[22:05] side of this because for a very long
[22:07] time i've seen
[22:08] a disconnect a misalignment between the
[22:11] word and daily living
[22:13] and it troubles me uh how the word could
[22:15] be so clear
[22:16] and there's this challenge to reconcile
[22:19] our behaviors our attitudes
[22:21] our lives with this word because the
[22:23] moment our lives and this world gets
[22:25] connected
[22:26] it is not a performance it's not a show
[22:28] it is it is not something that you could
[22:30] put on it's authentic
[22:31] you know and and and that authenticity
[22:34] is what we are fighting for
[22:36] you know when you live a life a life of
[22:39] lies
[22:40] you know you you begin to forget which
[22:42] lie you tell to who
[22:43] you know but when you are truthful and
[22:45] you're honest and there's this
[22:47] connection between this word that we
[22:49] teach and we preach
[22:50] and your daily living the effort of it
[22:52] the transparency of it
[22:54] that is really what the thunder is that
[22:56] shakes the devil because you close the
[22:58] windows the doors in your life
[23:00] that that you give no room for the devil
[23:02] to begin to move in your life and that
[23:04] is what we are
[23:05] want to encourage each of us for to deal
[23:08] with the challenges of life that will
[23:11] come to us
[23:12] in ways that we don't expect sometimes
[23:14] it's just exhaustion he's just tired
[23:16] you know sometimes you're just
[23:17] overwhelmed and and and that's okay
[23:20] because when you look at jesus own
[23:22] experience and we have preached it
[23:23] before
[23:24] that when jesus had to go and and and
[23:27] deal with that man
[23:28] on the other side the man who who who
[23:31] had legion upon him
[23:32] you know all those devils upon him the
[23:34] bible said they had to to carry jesus to
[23:37] the boat
[23:37] and we have taught that that would carry
[23:39] was to physically lift
[23:41] because jesus was so tired from his
[23:42] ministering that he was exhausted
[23:45] so there are times in our lives when we
[23:46] will have to deal with
[23:48] exhaustion and deal with with the
[23:50] burdens and
[23:51] and their situation that will confront
[23:53] us that we did not expect and
[23:55] the to the very best of our planning we
[23:57] cannot plan for everything because
[24:00] it is the nature of this call it human
[24:02] experience
[24:03] you know and and we're trying to
[24:05] reconcile this human experience
[24:07] in in this dimension and this realm that
[24:10] god has
[24:10] put us here to prove that despite all
[24:13] that comes to us the seed in us
[24:15] is resilient enough to withstand
[24:18] anything
[24:18] he that is greater in you is that
[24:21] greater than what's in the world you
[24:22] know so
[24:23] so we are thankful tonight that we are
[24:24] still standing that itself is a reason
[24:26] to be appreciative
[24:28] that after all is said and done we are
[24:30] still standing
[24:31] we still believe you are you might be a
[24:33] wounded eagle
[24:34] you might you might have some feathers
[24:35] that is not in the right place
[24:37] but you're still an eagle you're
[24:38] identified with eagles you know it's
[24:40] like i think brother branham said
[24:42] the man who came to church with without
[24:43] eternity he just had gums
[24:45] and they said listen maybe they're
[24:46] looking my i use my gum but i'm using
[24:48] whatever i have
[24:49] because that is my testimony you know so
[24:52] we come tonight
[24:53] once again um i i i wouldn't
[24:56] jump over the ceiling and say i have all
[24:58] my strength i told my wife
[25:00] just before this i feel exhausted you
[25:02] know but
[25:03] i am reporting for duty with my physical
[25:05] exhaustion
[25:06] um because i believe that the purpose
[25:09] that god called us for
[25:10] is bigger than sometimes our individual
[25:12] situations
[25:13] and true christianity is is living for
[25:16] each other
[25:16] you know and it follows my lot tonight
[25:18] to try to encourage us
[25:20] and i'm using me with us i'm placing
[25:22] myself in there as well to encourage
[25:24] us to to press encourage us to fight
[25:27] encourage us to act encourage us to do
[25:30] encourage us to persevere encourage us
[25:33] to overlook
[25:34] certain things that that that we allow
[25:37] to affect us too much
[25:38] and to shake it off like like like paul
[25:42] shook off this little point or shook up
[25:43] the snake
[25:44] you know you can't let everything get to
[25:46] you you know
[25:47] you know and um you know sometimes when
[25:50] you look back and you see your response
[25:52] on how you respond to certain situations
[25:54] and
[25:54] you start to see maturity when you
[25:56] realize you don't have to respond that
[25:57] way anymore
[25:58] because you get a deeper understanding
[26:01] of what you can control and what you
[26:03] cannot control you know
[26:04] so i truly believe that the word of god
[26:08] comes to make us complete it comes to
[26:10] make us whole
[26:11] you know and the bible gives us these
[26:13] references you know
[26:14] entire wanting nothing complete finish
[26:17] a lot of the word speaks to this
[26:19] finishing putting the
[26:20] finishing touches on our lives many of
[26:23] the things that we speak in bible study
[26:25] and we speak in church we know we heard
[26:27] we read you know we have been around for
[26:29] a while
[26:30] so so there's there's not much that we
[26:33] could say tonight that you me
[26:34] we may have never heard before but the
[26:36] reality is
[26:37] the finishing touches take time the
[26:40] hardest part of building a house
[26:41] is putting the finishing touches
[26:43] especially if you're particular there
[26:45] are some people
[26:46] who are not too particular about things
[26:48] you know
[26:50] anything goes the pain to run on the
[26:52] side of the wall they really care
[26:53] somebody paint the wall and paint the
[26:55] light switch there whatever that they
[26:56] are all paint then you hold light richly
[26:58] wall
[26:58] but there's some people who don't
[26:59] tolerate that they want to make sure
[27:01] that the light switch i get paint
[27:03] they want to make sure they put it tape
[27:04] first to make sure only parts that's
[27:06] supposed to get pain supposed to get
[27:08] paint
[27:08] that is when you have a level of
[27:10] consciousness
[27:11] on how things are finished you know and
[27:14] and many of us
[27:15] we struggle with attention to details
[27:19] you know we we tolerate things because
[27:21] we don't want to take the time
[27:23] to pay attention to the to the finer
[27:26] details
[27:27] and and anybody who is in the business
[27:30] of finishing
[27:31] you know it's easy to is it it's easy to
[27:34] mix concrete
[27:35] and put it in a wheelbarrow and try it
[27:37] in a foundation
[27:38] you know you're not you have to be a con
[27:40] a construction expert to take a
[27:42] wheelbarrow and through it and you're
[27:43] casting out flow and casting our flow
[27:44] but you see when you're finished cut the
[27:46] floor and you're putting moulding
[27:48] and these finer things you can't just
[27:51] pick up anybody
[27:52] and tell them putty molding in place the
[27:54] art of finishing
[27:56] anything you need to slow down a little
[27:58] bit because you want it on a certain way
[28:00] you want it done just right
[28:01] and i believe that we are in the phase
[28:05] of our journey here in this age of the
[28:07] finishing
[28:08] nobody finishing of these seven seals
[28:10] nobody the finishing of the body
[28:12] the finishing touches that bring it
[28:14] brings it to perfection
[28:16] and our promise is perfection and
[28:18] because god is perfect
[28:20] and his desire is for us to be perfect
[28:22] he will take time
[28:24] and he will spend as much time as he
[28:26] needs
[28:27] to make sure these finer things in us
[28:29] that we should have
[28:30] are being displayed and the things that
[28:32] would not make it to the other side
[28:34] will be eliminated from our existence i
[28:37] don't know if this is helping anybody
[28:39] i know this is bible study but sometimes
[28:41] in these settings
[28:42] we get inspired to just have a
[28:43] conversation that will motivate all of
[28:45] us
[28:46] to to be patient about the process
[28:49] you know you cannot rush perfection you
[28:52] can't be perfect overnight
[28:53] it takes time it takes introspection
[28:56] it takes reflection it takes analysis
[28:59] but anthony was preaching
[29:01] a few weeks ago about that masterpiece i
[29:03] know sometimes you just
[29:04] sit for a while and you look at it to
[29:07] make sure
[29:08] that the vision is being maintained and
[29:10] that that that that
[29:12] there is an alignment with what was in
[29:14] your heart originally
[29:15] and to make sure that that the next spot
[29:17] you touch is the right spot to touch so
[29:19] i pray tonight
[29:20] that through this word for however long
[29:22] we are here tonight
[29:24] that god would put some finishing
[29:25] touches in our lives
[29:27] some finishing touches as husbands
[29:29] finishing touches as
[29:30] fathers finishing touches as sons
[29:33] finishing touches as wives
[29:34] and and and i have to believe that you
[29:37] know you have some finishing to do
[29:39] you know i know i have some finishing to
[29:41] do i want god to begin to operate on me
[29:44] so that i have the right words the right
[29:46] expression the right life
[29:48] so that the words and the life are in
[29:50] line and the word the life and the word
[29:52] is in line
[29:52] and that should be our desire tonight so
[29:55] i pray that you are encouraged and
[29:57] motivated
[29:58] and um last week i was i i
[30:03] we were looking at joseph and it's such
[30:05] a powerful story
[30:06] and um you know sometimes when you slow
[30:10] down and you think about it
[30:11] not many of us could handle the
[30:13] experience that joseph went through
[30:16] not many of us could deal with the
[30:20] deep deep rejection of family
[30:24] you know it is not expressed in that way
[30:26] but that is what it was
[30:28] the deep rejection of siblings and
[30:31] being thrown out of your house thrown
[30:34] out of your family
[30:36] being almost forgotten completely and
[30:40] when you understand deeply and you spend
[30:42] time
[30:43] contemplating the experience that joseph
[30:45] would have had at a
[30:46] young age barely able to have a deep
[30:49] understanding of
[30:50] the emotional impact and the
[30:52] psychological impact because these
[30:54] things are real we'd be foolish
[30:56] to to live in this in this in this
[30:58] spiritual construct
[31:00] where things don't go wrong and and and
[31:03] we cover it up with
[31:04] with we fight in the fight to not deal
[31:07] with the fact that joseph would have
[31:08] been broken
[31:10] he would have been disappointed he would
[31:12] have been hurt
[31:14] he would have felt rejected you know
[31:16] we'd read in scripture
[31:18] how he he cried and he screamed
[31:21] you know which shock at the fact that
[31:25] the people he grew up with his skin
[31:28] his blood would give him a way of not
[31:31] knowing the outcome not knowing
[31:33] the consequence not knowing where he
[31:36] would end up not knowing if he would
[31:37] live or die
[31:39] and for those brief moments of his last
[31:41] look at his brothers
[31:43] the thoughts flashing through his mind
[31:45] would i ever see them again
[31:47] would i ever come back to my home again
[31:49] would i ever see my father again would i
[31:51] ever see my family again would i
[31:52] ever see my people again and being
[31:54] snatched into a new experience and
[31:56] having to reconcile
[31:58] dealing with the unknown dealing with
[32:01] uncertainty
[32:02] dealing with having to confront
[32:04] decisions he would have never had to
[32:06] make before
[32:07] we would have read last week how he was
[32:09] not even familiar with the terrain
[32:12] of where they would have the sheep and
[32:13] the farming because when he got to where
[32:15] he expected them he found himself lost
[32:18] and somebody had to tell him where his
[32:19] brothers might be he didn't even have a
[32:21] understanding of the of the places they
[32:24] might even carry them
[32:25] because he was unfamiliar with what his
[32:27] older brothers would have done
[32:29] he was protected he was his father's
[32:32] favorite child
[32:33] so there are certain things he would not
[32:35] have had to do and experience because
[32:37] that's how favorites typically are they
[32:39] are protected they are served and all
[32:41] these things
[32:42] and how god would would have to shake
[32:44] that experience and bring him into a
[32:46] spot
[32:47] that he went from being a favorite to
[32:49] being a slave
[32:51] and yet still in the condition of being
[32:53] a slave
[32:54] how the blessing of the lord and not
[32:56] just the blessing of the lord
[32:58] but you could be blessed and be lazy
[33:00] with a blessing you know
[33:03] you could be blessed and do nothing with
[33:05] your blessing
[33:06] you could be blessed and and sit there
[33:09] with a blessing
[33:10] you know and we read the scriptures and
[33:12] many people don't don't study it enough
[33:14] but the bible says gifts and callings
[33:16] are without repentance
[33:17] and that means that when god gives
[33:18] something he doesn't take it back he
[33:20] gives it without hesitation he gives it
[33:24] and there are many people who are gifted
[33:25] and they do nothing with their gifts
[33:29] so you'll see paul exhorting timothy
[33:31] study to show yourself approved
[33:34] the gift is there we're not questioning
[33:37] if the gift is there
[33:38] but if you don't study you can't show
[33:40] yourself approved
[33:41] so there is a responsibility placed on
[33:44] us to do more
[33:45] to do extra to towards mastery
[33:51] they call jesus good master for a reason
[33:53] because he demonstrated a level of
[33:55] mastery so there's nothing that is there
[33:59] that is said in in a way
[34:01] that that makes it confusing or
[34:03] distracting it is just we have to
[34:05] realize
[34:06] what is possible we have to realize that
[34:09] god put us here
[34:10] and and what we need to do for the
[34:12] journey that god gave us
[34:13] it's already in us you know
[34:17] the challenge for us is to break out of
[34:20] the limitations imposed by others or
[34:22] even what we put on ourselves
[34:25] to break out higher so we would have
[34:28] ended last week
[34:29] uh at around the end of genesis
[34:32] 41 where
[34:36] after joseph was 17 years old
[34:39] and he would have been snatched at that
[34:40] time we find him the bible says
[34:43] 30 years old in front of pharaoh
[34:46] 13 years from being kidnapped snatch
[34:51] abandoned whatever adjective you want to
[34:53] use
[34:55] 13 years of drying out 13 years of
[34:59] coming into his own as it were 13 years
[35:01] of maturing 13 years of
[35:03] deeper life experiences 13 years of
[35:06] coming to
[35:07] a realization that he could have done
[35:10] and achieve what he didn't know was
[35:11] possible and
[35:12] had he stayed at home this would have
[35:13] never taken place so
[35:15] as we read you know he named one of one
[35:18] of his sons
[35:18] from for the lord has made me forgot
[35:21] forget my my sufferings and
[35:23] and and he has reached this spot where
[35:26] life is fine
[35:27] in so much that he almost went almost
[35:30] overboard
[35:31] you know i i know you may have never
[35:33] heard that before but the reality is
[35:35] he didn't express interest in
[35:39] let me send food to my father i wonder
[35:41] how they are doing
[35:43] so it's almost like he he and maybe it
[35:46] was a protective measure we're having a
[35:47] conversation
[35:48] because maybe he protected himself
[35:50] emotionally from his family
[35:52] so he's sitting there in power in egypt
[35:54] and we see joseph
[35:56] hasn't reached out to his family
[35:59] maybe he didn't want to know the truth
[36:01] of their well-being
[36:02] maybe he still was dealing with his own
[36:05] issues and
[36:06] and all these things but but we find now
[36:08] in genesis 42 this is where we at from
[36:11] verse one
[36:12] we would have switched from joseph
[36:14] coming into power and being responsible
[36:16] for
[36:16] the distribution of the stored up food
[36:18] agreeing to
[36:20] genesis 42 verse one now when jacob saw
[36:24] that there was corn in egypt
[36:26] jacob said unto his sons why
[36:29] do we look one upon another
[36:33] i love that in the amplified
[36:37] that last statement is why are you
[36:39] staring at one another
[36:40] in bewilderment and not taking action
[36:46] so here it is this is seven years of
[36:50] plenty of past
[36:52] famine is in the land obviously this is
[36:54] not a day into the famine
[36:56] because they would still have food some
[36:58] time would have passed and the food they
[37:00] would have had
[37:00] would have been dwindling going down
[37:02] going down going down
[37:04] and jacob and his old age saying ollie
[37:06] here watching one another
[37:08] and all you're not taking no action all
[37:10] i could just let get back
[37:11] into worse and not do anything about it
[37:13] you know and many times
[37:15] we may think that way as parents about
[37:17] children
[37:18] or we may be the ones seeing stuff
[37:21] happening around us
[37:22] and refusing to take action and we're
[37:24] looking around at one another
[37:26] and this looking out one round of one
[37:28] another is about responsibility here
[37:31] it's about who is going to do it
[37:34] so you're looking around one another
[37:36] nobody taking action
[37:38] but everybody looking around seeing i
[37:40] wonder who i wonder if
[37:42] i wonder how so it took jacob's rebuke
[37:46] for his sons to even get off the seat as
[37:49] it were to get into action
[37:51] why is it for some of us to get into
[37:54] action and have to take a rebuke
[37:59] we could spend time in this verse one we
[38:01] can spend the whole evening right here
[38:02] you know
[38:04] jacob saw that there was corn in egypt
[38:06] he is not the young one on the block
[38:09] he is the father he is the head of the
[38:11] home
[38:12] and he has multiple children he has 10
[38:16] sons
[38:18] all i'm sure with their own ambitions
[38:20] all with their families coming up on all
[38:22] these things going on
[38:23] and none of them making a decision to
[38:25] say we can do something about it none of
[38:27] them
[38:27] come to daddy and say daddy i want to go
[38:30] and take this action
[38:31] he has to now drive and inspire
[38:34] and motivate and looking at them seeing
[38:37] that none of them
[38:39] speaking of leadership taking leadership
[38:41] i know
[38:42] many of you haven't spent time in this
[38:43] one verse like this
[38:46] if jacob took no action there would be
[38:49] no verse two of this story let me nail
[38:51] that down a little bit
[38:52] if jacob didn't light a fire light a
[38:56] fire under his sons to say why
[38:57] do you look one upon another you're not
[39:00] doing anything with your life you're
[39:02] sitting down here
[39:02] watching your food going down you're
[39:04] watching every day saying guys there's
[39:06] less rice and oh goose is less rice yes
[39:08] oh let's see the rice going on hey the
[39:11] flower lower this
[39:11] dude followed uh you know so so and
[39:14] nobody taken action to solve the problem
[39:20] it speaks volumes about the young people
[39:23] of that day
[39:25] and it speaks volumes about the young
[39:27] people of this day
[39:29] and we see now there's a parallel
[39:31] between that day and this day
[39:32] because there are many young people who
[39:34] without putting fire under them or
[39:36] speaking to them or
[39:38] motivating them or chastising them or
[39:40] telling them to get up and do something
[39:42] they will sit there looking at one
[39:43] another that looking at one another
[39:46] is akin to looking for leadership if
[39:49] somebody move we
[39:50] we go we're going to move but if nobody
[39:52] moving i said you know here
[39:54] it is that fear of being willing to
[39:56] stand out to be different
[39:59] to recognize that there's a need and
[40:01] decide that listen somebody has to do it
[40:03] why not me somebody has to get up
[40:06] why not me why not no why not find a way
[40:12] it also speaks to the fact that jacob
[40:14] was bringing
[40:15] information to his sons that they should
[40:17] have been aware of
[40:20] i want to read it one more time i hope i
[40:22] go into slowly
[40:24] but i want us to be conscious because
[40:26] right now the world is in its famine
[40:28] in many ways the world is in a hard time
[40:32] in many ways
[40:32] economically emotionally psychologically
[40:36] morally spiritually there's famine
[40:40] everywhere
[40:41] do you know where there's corn do you
[40:44] know where there's grain do you know
[40:45] where there's opportunity in your
[40:46] spiritual dimension do you know where
[40:48] there's opportunity financially are you
[40:49] gonna
[40:50] sit down and not update your resume
[40:54] are you going to sit down and say it's
[40:56] it's going down it's going down
[40:59] and not do anything about it
[41:03] genesis 42 is as relevant today as it is
[41:07] the story of then
[41:09] now when jacob saw so even though jacob
[41:11] was old
[41:12] or older even though jacob was in a
[41:15] position where
[41:16] maybe he wasn't the one expected to work
[41:19] he still kept his pulse
[41:20] on where the economic activity was he
[41:22] still kept his pulse
[41:24] on on on where opportunity lay he still
[41:26] kept his fault
[41:27] are you on the pulse of what's happening
[41:28] around you
[41:31] by the grace of god last sunday we were
[41:33] speaking about knowing and how it is
[41:35] important
[41:35] to know to be aware not of foolishness
[41:38] but to be aware of what's important
[41:41] hunger famine despair was in the land
[41:43] and those sons
[41:45] sat there looking at one another people
[41:47] sit
[41:48] in churches looking at one another sit
[41:50] in their homes
[41:51] looking at one another sit in their jobs
[41:53] looking at one another
[41:55] nobody willing to make a decision to
[41:57] take action
[41:58] famine death
[42:01] and no action this can be brought all
[42:05] the way into kings
[42:07] even the lepers who are the gate took
[42:09] action
[42:10] they looked at one another for a while
[42:12] and they decided to take action
[42:13] themselves
[42:14] nobody had to put a light under them to
[42:16] say get up and do
[42:18] but here it was jacob had to prod his
[42:21] sons
[42:21] get up do something wake up make up your
[42:24] bed brush your teeth
[42:25] go to work send out a resume go to
[42:28] interview go knock on the door and see
[42:29] there's an opportunity
[42:30] why why do we have to in the midst of
[42:34] crisis
[42:35] not have a personal desire to say i want
[42:38] to get up and pray
[42:39] i'm going to read a book this has to be
[42:42] real to you
[42:47] i told you there's one verse we can
[42:48] spend the whole time you know
[42:51] so when jacob saw that there was corn in
[42:53] egypt
[42:54] food in egypt opportunity in egypt the
[42:57] solution in egypt
[43:00] jacob said unto his sons why do you look
[43:02] one upon another
[43:04] verse two and he said behold i have
[43:06] heard that there is corn in egypt get
[43:08] you down there in order
[43:10] go down there and buy for us from thence
[43:12] that we may live and not die
[43:15] so jacob was saying your lack of action
[43:17] your lack of vision your lack of having
[43:20] a plan your
[43:21] failure to analyze the risk that we are
[43:24] in
[43:25] and the fact that this road that we are
[43:27] in will lead to death unless something
[43:29] is done
[43:30] now i have to instruct you to do it
[43:36] verse 3 and joseph's 10
[43:38] [Music]
[43:39] went down to buy corn in egypt
[43:43] verse four but benjamin joseph's brother
[43:47] jacob sent not with his bridge in for he
[43:49] said les paul adventure
[43:51] mischief befall him so jacob is being
[43:56] he's managing his risk
[44:00] he is sending the ten sons he said not
[44:03] benjamin
[44:04] because i've already in his heart we
[44:06] know the pain as a father
[44:09] he said i've already lost joseph i'm not
[44:12] willing i'm not willing
[44:14] to take this risk do you know what risks
[44:16] you are not willing to take
[44:18] do you know the risks that you are
[44:19] willing to take and not willing to take
[44:25] the bible said which man when building a
[44:27] house don't consider
[44:28] don't consider the inputs the cost the
[44:31] value
[44:31] what he's building we need to spend more
[44:35] time analyzing our risks
[44:37] analyzing our moves analyzing our
[44:40] strategies
[44:42] we need to spend time meditating because
[44:44] the world has the answers but we need to
[44:46] spend the quality time to see what god
[44:49] wants
[44:50] us to see in scripture how he wants us
[44:52] to move in scripture
[44:54] verse five i hope this is helping
[44:56] somebody this evening
[44:58] and the sons of israel came to buy corn
[45:01] among those that came
[45:03] for the famine was in the land of canaan
[45:06] and joseph was the governor over the
[45:09] land
[45:10] and he it was that soul to all the
[45:14] people of the land
[45:16] and joseph's brethren came and bowed
[45:18] down themselves before him
[45:20] with their faces 38.
[45:23] you know i was sharing with brother ovid
[45:25] about a week or so ago
[45:27] i was in a program a training program
[45:30] and
[45:34] we as going through scripture about how
[45:36] much god wants us to
[45:38] be detailed and i was in a study of
[45:42] how god instructed moses to write
[45:46] down the details of his journeys
[45:51] and how god instructed moses to write
[45:53] down the names of the men who are going
[45:55] into war so he could give a clear
[45:56] account
[45:57] a lot of people don't understand that
[45:58] these things are in scripture
[46:00] and i'm reading joseph was governor over
[46:02] the land and it was he that sold to all
[46:05] the people of the land
[46:06] which meant that joseph took his a
[46:09] direct hand
[46:10] into the affairs of this he didn't he
[46:12] didn't even delegate the management of
[46:14] this thing this one this thing was too
[46:15] important
[46:16] for him to delegate there's a balance
[46:19] between being a leader and delegating
[46:21] and knowing what you have to take
[46:22] responsibility for
[46:25] some of us believe that leadership and
[46:27] management is about handing out
[46:29] responsibilities to people
[46:30] but many times some people they are not
[46:32] able to manage the gravity
[46:34] of the depth of the responsibility that
[46:37] sometimes you have to
[46:38] confront within the context of your
[46:40] experience but here it was joseph was
[46:43] governor
[46:43] and it was he specifically he we're not
[46:46] trying to re
[46:47] it was he it was that soul he is there
[46:50] managing this thing for himself
[46:54] mind-blowing he is directly responsible
[46:57] because he don't want to take it for
[46:58] granted or take a chance that anybody
[47:01] mess this thing up
[47:02] there are some things you could delegate
[47:04] there are other things you have to know
[47:06] how important it is and the things that
[47:09] are
[47:09] most important for which your success is
[47:12] being measured
[47:13] because the reason joseph is governor is
[47:15] for the success of this
[47:16] initiative to store up food for seven
[47:20] years
[47:21] and to ensure that is budgeted for the
[47:23] next seven years of uncertainty that
[47:24] they're dealing with
[47:28] anybody with me tonight so i don't know
[47:32] how many of you
[47:33] seeing life business decisions budgeting
[47:36] planning
[47:36] everything is wrapped up in this you
[47:38] know the longer your spending is a
[47:39] little bitter i didn't realize there's
[47:40] so much
[47:41] so much meat and so much meat on this on
[47:44] this thing we eat in here
[47:50] number 7.
[47:54] at least let me read verse 6 one more
[47:56] time and joseph was the governor over
[47:57] the land
[47:58] and he it was that soul to all the
[48:00] people of the land
[48:01] and joseph's brethren came
[48:05] and bowed down themselves before him
[48:07] with their faces to the earth
[48:10] and in so doing they effectively
[48:12] fulfilled the dream
[48:15] that the 17-year-old joseph had
[48:19] now bear in mind the subtle message
[48:21] being expressed here
[48:23] they came with everybody else joseph
[48:27] is managing his affairs so so
[48:31] the unfolding of it is unique it is not
[48:33] as if joseph saw his brothers walking to
[48:35] him
[48:37] the scripture is very clear they came
[48:39] with all the people
[48:41] joseph's version came bound themselves
[48:43] before him with their faces city earth
[48:46] so the first picture that joseph has of
[48:48] his brothers
[48:49] is men with their faces to the earth he
[48:52] doesn't know who they are yet because
[48:53] they have not
[48:54] lifted their heads off the ground yet he
[48:56] doesn't know who he's ministering to yet
[48:58] he doesn't know who he's about to sell
[49:00] to yet
[49:01] he just sees ten men with their heads in
[49:03] the ground
[49:05] he doesn't even realize that vision
[49:08] scripture
[49:09] dream is being fulfilled
[49:15] by this time joseph is in egypt so long
[49:17] the spiritual anchor
[49:19] of being with his father these are
[49:21] things that
[49:22] he himself may not have even been
[49:24] remembering
[49:26] because we would see it later he only
[49:28] remembered it afterwards he
[49:29] wasn't thinking about it at that point
[49:31] at that point his mind is occupied with
[49:33] the effective administration
[49:35] of what was stored and the effective
[49:37] distribution of what was stored
[49:40] anybody with me tonight so let me read
[49:43] it again carefully
[49:45] so joseph's brethren came and bowed
[49:47] themselves before him with their faces
[49:49] in earth
[49:50] next verse verse 7 and joseph saw his
[49:52] brethren
[49:55] so i want you to picture this scene
[49:57] joseph is there next
[49:59] and the scene clears ten men head on the
[50:02] ground
[50:02] and they lift their faces and joseph saw
[50:06] his brethren and he knew them
[50:10] he recognized them he discerned them
[50:13] but made himself strange unto them
[50:17] make himself strange is not just about
[50:20] appearance now
[50:22] because let me let me read it in the
[50:24] amplified
[50:27] he he hid his identity in other words
[50:30] he withheld the expression of who he was
[50:34] obviously if you do the mathematics he
[50:37] was 17 years old when he left
[50:39] at this point this is about 20 plus
[50:41] years later
[50:45] 17 and 13 is 30 30 plus seven years of
[50:48] plenty
[50:50] that'll be 37. so 20 years plus have
[50:53] passed he's no longer the 17 year old
[50:55] boy
[50:56] who is running wrong telling dreams 37
[50:59] plus years have passed so in other words
[51:01] the last time they had seen him the last
[51:02] time he had seen them was over 20 years
[51:05] old
[51:05] but he reserved himself from the
[51:07] expression of who he was
[51:09] by not identifying himself to them
[51:11] calling them my name he restrained
[51:12] himself it takes
[51:13] great discipline to do that
[51:17] not just hiding himself but restraining
[51:19] his emotions
[51:20] his feelings few people
[51:24] would be in that position and not feel
[51:25] something
[51:28] few people i am i have to
[51:31] and when i have to look at myself i
[51:33] wonder how i would have felt
[51:36] you wouldn't really know unless you
[51:37] walked the shoes that you put your foot
[51:39] in
[51:39] in his shoes you know if you were thrown
[51:42] into the well and
[51:43] soul into slavery and and all these
[51:45] things to confront the reality of
[51:47] yourself
[51:47] so let's go i don't want to take up too
[51:49] much time tonight i don't know if this
[51:50] is helping anybody and joseph saw his
[51:52] brethren
[51:52] and he knew them but made himself
[51:54] strange unto them
[51:56] and speak roughly unto them and he's
[51:59] telling
[51:59] them whence comey of course you know
[52:02] where they're coming from
[52:04] when you say once in other words where
[52:06] you're coming from
[52:08] and they sent from the land of canaan to
[52:10] buy food
[52:12] and the bible says again
[52:15] and joseph knew his virgin didn't he say
[52:18] in verse 7
[52:20] so you know when the bible when his
[52:22] scripture repeats itself
[52:25] it it it it it enforces the so
[52:28] it's almost like he's been overwhelmed
[52:30] by the recognition with
[52:32] disabled brothers it's not like he
[52:35] forget them between verse seven and and
[52:37] and and and
[52:38] and and verse eighteen it is it what it
[52:41] means is the
[52:42] all the memories coming back and joseph
[52:44] knew his bridging
[52:46] but they knew him not and look at verse
[52:48] 9 for the first time
[52:51] and joseph remembered the dreams
[52:55] the memories coming back his story
[52:58] coming back
[52:59] humans as it is our nature to block from
[53:02] our memory
[53:03] unpleasant experiences
[53:07] it is a protective mechanism of the mind
[53:09] of the spirit
[53:12] we talk about reasoning and memory and
[53:14] conscience these are the
[53:15] the senses of the spirit it is it is
[53:18] natural
[53:18] for you to want to distance yourself
[53:20] from pain from suffering
[53:22] from situations that you you didn't feel
[53:25] good about you
[53:26] it was not pleasant so certain things
[53:29] about joseph experience he would have
[53:31] repressed and here it was
[53:32] as a rush as a as a as a flood it comes
[53:35] back to him
[53:36] and joseph remembered the dreams which
[53:38] he dreamed of them and said unto them
[53:40] yeah spies
[53:43] to see the nakedness of the land here
[53:45] come so he accused his brothers
[53:47] you are spies you have come and he
[53:49] amplified with a malicious purpose
[53:52] to observe the undefended parts of our
[53:54] land
[53:55] no joseph knew them he knew who they
[53:59] were
[54:00] so what is joseph doing now joseph is
[54:03] trying he's testing he is going through
[54:06] his own emotions a lot is happening
[54:08] there
[54:08] at that point in time
[54:12] and they said unto him name my lord but
[54:15] to buy food are thy servants come
[54:18] we are all one man's sons we are true
[54:21] men or honest men
[54:22] thy servants are no spies
[54:26] in the amplified it actually says we are
[54:27] honest men your sins are not spies
[54:30] you can imagine the the trial to
[54:32] reconcile that statement we are honest
[54:33] man
[54:34] and joseph's saying
[54:40] i know i know i know what you did
[54:45] and he said unto them but to see the
[54:48] nakedness of the land you have come
[54:50] in other words to see the undefended
[54:53] part of the land
[54:56] and they said thy servants are 12
[54:57] brethren the sons of one man in the land
[55:00] of canaan and behold the youngest
[55:02] is this day with our father and one is
[55:04] not
[55:06] so that one who is not they're talking
[55:08] about joseph
[55:12] you know what it is to be there being
[55:14] described being mentioned and let me
[55:16] tell you
[55:16] one is not you don't exist them ten i'm
[55:19] in front of joseph
[55:20] and tell him you existed on it they even
[55:23] realized
[55:28] and joseph said to them that is it that
[55:30] i speak unto you saying
[55:32] he has spies all they just can film it
[55:36] let's just confirm it hereby shall he be
[55:39] proved
[55:41] by the life of pharaoh you shall not go
[55:44] forth hence
[55:45] except your youngest brother come here
[55:50] send one of you and let him fetch your
[55:52] brother and you shall be kept in prison
[55:55] that your words may be proved whether
[55:57] there be any truth in you or else
[55:59] by the life of pharaoh surely you are
[56:01] spies so if you say you're
[56:03] if all let's say all you're honest and
[56:04] only true bring your youngest brother to
[56:07] me
[56:08] and he put them all together into ward
[56:10] for three days
[56:15] which is in what is prison there you
[56:16] lock them up you get them out three days
[56:19] you know what see who that tree is
[56:24] ah yeah yeah yeah
[56:28] and joseph said unto them the third day
[56:29] this do and live for i fear god
[56:34] if you be true men let one of your
[56:36] brethren be bound in the house
[56:39] of your prison goyi carry corn for the
[56:42] famine of your houses
[56:43] so of course joseph know his father need
[56:45] food you know his family need food
[56:47] so you say let's leave one man here you
[56:49] wrestle all you go
[56:50] verse 20 but bring your youngest brother
[56:53] unto me
[56:54] so shall your words be verified and you
[56:57] shall not die
[56:58] and they did so
[57:01] verse 21 and they said to one another so
[57:04] no
[57:04] i don't know when last they had a family
[57:08] meeting
[57:08] you know finally things could be a
[57:10] delicate
[57:12] delicate thing i don't know when lies at
[57:14] a family meeting
[57:15] but this thing forced a family meeting
[57:17] and they said
[57:18] one to another earlier in this verse
[57:21] they were just looking at one another
[57:22] no at least they talking to one another
[57:25] they said
[57:26] one to another we are verily guilty
[57:29] they do an analysis they presented the
[57:31] evidence they sentence themselves
[57:33] and say we are verily guilty concerning
[57:36] our brother
[57:37] in that listen and this is where it gets
[57:40] painful
[57:41] in that we saw the anguish of his soul
[57:44] reading this is painful because
[57:47] they now are admitting that they saw the
[57:50] anguish
[57:52] of his soul so they saw the pain that
[57:56] joseph was going through
[57:57] and they still made a decision to let
[58:00] him go
[58:00] you see why god has to deal with them
[58:03] also in a certain kind of way
[58:06] i want us to wait because it's not just
[58:08] joseph being dealt with here
[58:11] these are the sons of jacob these are
[58:13] the tribes of israel we dealing with you
[58:14] know
[58:16] uh-huh so for the tribes of israel to be
[58:21] lined up effectively we have we read
[58:22] them in gideon oh this tribe is on a
[58:24] mountain this tribe is a water tribe
[58:26] these are all the tribes
[58:27] represented here and the issues in their
[58:30] lives have to come to before
[58:32] what was in darkness have to come to
[58:33] light the issues that need to be fixed
[58:35] need to be confronted and addressed
[58:37] because it can't move on
[58:39] the whole reason they're coming into
[58:40] egypt is because god do this to preserve
[58:42] life
[58:45] to preserve the life of judah and the
[58:47] lion of judah but also to preserve his
[58:49] people
[58:50] the children of israel these are the
[58:52] children of israel
[58:53] now admitting because of the situation
[58:57] we messed up we didn't deal with it
[58:59] right we saw the anguish
[59:01] we saw the pain we saw the situation and
[59:03] we still let it go
[59:07] this is god dealing with the tribes of
[59:09] israel
[59:10] i wanted to see it here because if the
[59:13] foundation is not right
[59:14] the building can never hold so god has
[59:17] to deal with these men
[59:19] who would be the patriarchs as it were
[59:22] of
[59:22] all the descendants that would come from
[59:24] the line of israel
[59:28] and they said to one another verse 21 we
[59:30] are verily guilty
[59:34] truly we are guilty in the amplified
[59:37] regarding our brother joseph
[59:39] i'm reading from the afterlife because
[59:41] we saw the distress
[59:42] and anguish of his soul when he pleaded
[59:46] with us
[59:46] believe it is not ask
[59:51] plead it is not oh god oh carry me
[59:54] pleaded
[59:55] is is a level of desperation plea were
[59:58] to let him go
[59:59] yet we would not listen and you have to
[1:00:01] fight to his cry
[1:00:03] so his distress and anguish has come on
[1:00:05] us
[1:00:07] what a reconciliation that he has to
[1:00:09] deal with
[1:00:11] what a what a personal experience all of
[1:00:14] these men have to come to terms with
[1:00:19] it would not be surprising if they
[1:00:21] themselves
[1:00:22] had repressed the pain they caused
[1:00:26] he says we're going real g piano
[1:00:33] it is not unlikely
[1:00:38] that over the course of the last 20
[1:00:40] years they wouldn't have had
[1:00:42] moments not just of regret of their
[1:00:45] actions
[1:00:46] but of the pain across their father
[1:00:48] jacob
[1:00:50] jacob was never the same when joseph was
[1:00:53] taken
[1:00:55] it was not something that jacob took
[1:00:57] lightly
[1:00:58] and he himself had said he would go to
[1:01:01] his grave
[1:01:02] with this situation so it is not as if
[1:01:04] they could have just left it so they
[1:01:05] would have had to put up protective
[1:01:07] measures
[1:01:08] around their mind and heart and
[1:01:09] situation because of this thing but here
[1:01:11] it was
[1:01:12] with the way they are being treated in
[1:01:13] egypt it all come
[1:01:15] 34 it all surfaces
[1:01:21] verse 22 and reuben
[1:01:25] answered them do you remember her reuben
[1:01:29] we studied it last week reuben has said
[1:01:32] i'm saying
[1:01:33] speak i not unto you wasn't it i say
[1:01:36] do not sin against this child
[1:01:40] out of all that i wonder how reuben
[1:01:41] would have felt
[1:01:43] after year one year two year three
[1:01:45] because he was going to say
[1:01:46] let us not kill this boy they wanted to
[1:01:48] kill him you know
[1:01:50] and reuben answered them saying speak i
[1:01:52] not unto you saying do not sin against a
[1:01:54] child
[1:01:54] and you were not here therefore behold
[1:01:57] also his blood
[1:01:58] also his blood is required
[1:02:02] now listen to the paradox of the
[1:02:04] situation here now this is unfolding
[1:02:06] yeah bear in mind they had the encounter
[1:02:08] with
[1:02:09] joseph in the throne room joseph pass
[1:02:12] judgment give them our three days
[1:02:14] get them out of the weekend in jail
[1:02:16] clear their heads over think about it
[1:02:18] whether spies or whatever
[1:02:19] and now he releasing them and they are
[1:02:21] talking
[1:02:22] and and check this verse 23 and they
[1:02:25] knew not
[1:02:26] that joseph understood them for
[1:02:30] he spake unto them by an interpreter
[1:02:33] so it is now coming out to us that
[1:02:36] joseph's interaction with them all along
[1:02:38] was through his interpreter
[1:02:42] and they didn't realize that joseph who
[1:02:46] zafnat paneer would be his name to them
[1:02:48] was actually
[1:02:49] understanding what they were saying
[1:02:53] and in hearing their conversation
[1:02:57] this almost king
[1:03:00] second only to pharaoh driver of the
[1:03:03] second chariot
[1:03:06] wife husband of asana father of manasseh
[1:03:09] and ephraim
[1:03:12] the man who says who go go who come
[1:03:16] come look at verse 24
[1:03:19] and he turned himself about from them
[1:03:22] and wept
[1:03:29] hearing the conversation hearing the
[1:03:32] remorse
[1:03:33] hearing the regret hearing
[1:03:37] the honesty hearing the words of these
[1:03:41] brothers who he
[1:03:43] up until this point he didn't know where
[1:03:44] they stood
[1:03:47] but hearing them without them knowing he
[1:03:50] was hearing
[1:03:52] they were not speaking to catch his
[1:03:54] attention they didn't know who he was
[1:03:56] nor expect them to understand their
[1:03:57] language but he recognized something
[1:04:00] changed
[1:04:03] he turned himself about from them
[1:04:08] so in the amplified he turned away from
[1:04:11] his brothers and
[1:04:12] left the room and wept
[1:04:15] that's a kind of weeping it's a hard to
[1:04:18] describe weapon
[1:04:20] i can't even describe it i can't put
[1:04:21] words into this
[1:04:23] i try to wrap my mind around what
[1:04:26] emotions
[1:04:27] joseph was going through
[1:04:30] started in egypt as a slave now he
[1:04:32] there's nothing else he could possibly
[1:04:34] want
[1:04:35] again and seeing this
[1:04:38] brings back the rush of memories the
[1:04:40] rush of pain the agony the despair the
[1:04:43] sadness
[1:04:44] maybe he felt a tinge of regret there's
[1:04:47] a love for his brothers that
[1:04:48] it's impossible sometimes no matter what
[1:04:50] your brother do you you know you still
[1:04:51] love them
[1:04:54] all of that weeping is an emotion when
[1:04:56] words no longer
[1:04:58] could be used to express what you feel
[1:05:01] sometimes you try to put things into
[1:05:02] words and and only sounds come out
[1:05:04] because
[1:05:05] words can't capture what you feel they
[1:05:07] can't that's why when a baby cries
[1:05:09] it's because they can't express what
[1:05:11] they feel they don't know how to put it
[1:05:12] into words
[1:05:13] sometimes they go to praying sometimes
[1:05:15] they go to tiring before the lord and
[1:05:17] and you find yourself crying about a
[1:05:19] situation because you don't even know
[1:05:20] how to tell the lord what you need him
[1:05:22] and the situation
[1:05:24] we don't know what jesus was going
[1:05:26] through but it was overwhelming enough
[1:05:27] for him that he had to
[1:05:28] walk away turn his back leave the room
[1:05:32] close the door and cry
[1:05:37] unlike great men great leaders
[1:05:40] decision makers those who are expected
[1:05:43] to
[1:05:43] rise above the situation the bible says
[1:05:46] and return to them again
[1:05:47] obviously he would have dried his tears
[1:05:50] composed himself
[1:05:52] lifted himself out of that refrain this
[1:05:55] mind to deal with him again because
[1:05:57] as a leader you can't show that kind of
[1:05:59] weakness sometimes
[1:06:01] you can't show the time when you're
[1:06:03] you'll move away from the crowd to deal
[1:06:05] with your
[1:06:06] personal issues your personal feelings
[1:06:11] anybody with me tonight this is real now
[1:06:13] we still in
[1:06:14] this one chapter here you know
[1:06:18] dealing with the expectation of those
[1:06:19] around you
[1:06:21] and we'll see later on i don't know if
[1:06:22] you'll get it today or not
[1:06:24] because this was not the only time he
[1:06:26] would cry with emotion
[1:06:28] later on the bible said he cried so much
[1:06:31] the whole house of pharaoh
[1:06:32] him clearly it meant the issues he
[1:06:35] locked up
[1:06:36] and he protected and he hid all his time
[1:06:38] it was a lot for him to deal with
[1:06:46] verse 24
[1:06:53] and he turned himself about for them and
[1:06:55] wept and returned to them again
[1:06:57] and the bible now switched the word a
[1:06:59] little bit the subtle
[1:07:01] subtle switch here
[1:07:04] and communed with them commune is
[1:07:07] different from talk
[1:07:10] communed means that there's a change a
[1:07:13] switch just took place
[1:07:15] in joseph's perception of his brothers
[1:07:20] that private moment when he cried
[1:07:24] something clicked on the inside and he
[1:07:27] adjusted
[1:07:28] his position with them communing we talk
[1:07:31] about communion
[1:07:33] communities are talking computing is is
[1:07:35] it brings a
[1:07:36] level of relationship into the
[1:07:40] conversation
[1:07:43] and commute with them and still and took
[1:07:46] from them simeon
[1:07:47] and bound him before their eyes
[1:07:54] i want us to see the two sides of this
[1:07:56] he bound simeon
[1:07:57] we know why he's doing it because he
[1:07:59] wants benjamin to come
[1:08:02] but now think of simeon simeon is
[1:08:05] experienced being bound
[1:08:08] simeon can now give a testimony of what
[1:08:10] it was like to be bound in egypt
[1:08:12] he could identify a bit more he could
[1:08:14] have more empathy more understanding
[1:08:16] of what joseph would have gone through
[1:08:18] his other brothers who were not bound
[1:08:20] go through a second period of dealing
[1:08:22] with now with uncertainty
[1:08:23] the first they caused this one they
[1:08:25] didn't cause
[1:08:27] the first they were part of now they are
[1:08:29] witnesses too
[1:08:30] anybody with me so i want us to
[1:08:33] understand
[1:08:34] how this whole thing unfolds here right
[1:08:37] bound them before their eyes
[1:08:39] that that is struck in a certain way for
[1:08:41] us to understand
[1:08:42] that joseph didn't take semen away from
[1:08:44] them and they didn't see it
[1:08:46] they are witnessing this so for them
[1:08:48] it's a second brother
[1:08:49] being tied up like i said the first one
[1:08:52] they were part of
[1:08:53] here they have no control
[1:08:56] and there's many in this story of
[1:08:57] situation we could control and those
[1:08:59] that we cannot control
[1:09:00] joseph was taken against his control
[1:09:04] in the first situation those brothers
[1:09:05] felt they were in control now they
[1:09:06] understand what they should not be in
[1:09:08] control
[1:09:09] they were powerless they were in another
[1:09:10] man's land they were in another man's
[1:09:12] castle
[1:09:14] they know after what it feels like when
[1:09:16] decisions are made about your destiny
[1:09:18] or the destiny of your family and you
[1:09:20] have no say no
[1:09:21] influence no power to make a difference
[1:09:26] is this helping anybody i hope this give
[1:09:28] you some insight here tonight right
[1:09:32] verse 25 then joseph commanded to fill
[1:09:35] their sacks with corn
[1:09:36] in other words he's selling food with
[1:09:38] them making sure he wants to make sure
[1:09:40] they get food here he ain't playing that
[1:09:42] after all he said and done daddy home
[1:09:46] nothing could separate his love for his
[1:09:47] father or his father's love for him
[1:09:49] is a type of god's love for us and our
[1:09:51] love for the father
[1:09:55] commanded to fill their sacks with corn
[1:09:57] and to restore every man's money into
[1:09:59] his sock in other words
[1:10:01] you say their money not good here their
[1:10:03] money not good you know you have people
[1:10:04] you have people they are going to eat i
[1:10:06] think i said your money you're good
[1:10:07] you're away listen
[1:10:08] no you're not good
[1:10:12] do you say i can't take the money and to
[1:10:15] restore every man
[1:10:16] money in his sack and to give them
[1:10:18] provision for the way
[1:10:19] so he give them the food they came for
[1:10:21] put back the money they came to pay for
[1:10:23] the goods put it back in the sack he had
[1:10:25] to let me there
[1:10:26] he just put it in the sack and he gave
[1:10:27] them food for them to eat
[1:10:29] on the road so they'd have to cook they
[1:10:31] could just eat
[1:10:32] on the way home and thus did he unto
[1:10:35] them
[1:10:36] and they laid the asses with the corn
[1:10:38] and the parted vents
[1:10:40] and as one of them opened his sack to
[1:10:42] give his ass provinda in the inn in
[1:10:43] other words to feed it
[1:10:45] he aspired his money you see the money
[1:10:47] in there
[1:10:48] and he behold it was in his sacks moat
[1:10:50] and he said until his bedroom
[1:10:52] my money is restored
[1:10:55] and lo it is even in my suck and their
[1:10:58] heart feel them
[1:10:59] well this is one of the only this is one
[1:11:01] of the unique scriptures where
[1:11:03] money is restored and manhattan feeling
[1:11:10] normally when money restored is that is
[1:11:12] that jubilant
[1:11:13] exciting time isn't that say even if i
[1:11:16] sack the money so and his heart failed
[1:11:18] he said this is the first time where
[1:11:20] more money is a bigger problem
[1:11:24] and they were afraid saying one to
[1:11:26] another
[1:11:27] what is this that god had done unto us
[1:11:31] because as far as they see this is
[1:11:33] judgment upon
[1:11:34] judgment upon this is all they're not
[1:11:37] reaping they see
[1:11:38] they sowed 20 plus years ago coming back
[1:11:41] to them in a wave after wave after wave
[1:11:44] verse 29 and they came unto jacob their
[1:11:47] father
[1:11:48] unto the land of canaan and told him all
[1:11:50] that we fell at them saying
[1:11:52] the man who is the lord of the land
[1:11:55] speak roughly to us these big hard black
[1:11:58] men come home
[1:12:00] and say the man who is the lord of the
[1:12:02] land
[1:12:03] speak roughly to us
[1:12:08] and took us for spies of the country
[1:12:12] and we said unto them we are true men we
[1:12:14] are honest men we are no spies
[1:12:17] we be 12 brethren sons of our father one
[1:12:22] is not
[1:12:22] and the youngest is this deal with our
[1:12:24] father in the land of canaan
[1:12:26] and the man the lord of the country said
[1:12:28] unto us
[1:12:29] hereby said i know that you are true men
[1:12:32] leave one of your bridging here with me
[1:12:34] and take food for the famine of your
[1:12:36] households and be gone
[1:12:38] and bring your youngest brother unto me
[1:12:40] well you can imagine jacob at this point
[1:12:42] somebody say hold up hold up hold up
[1:12:43] where what what
[1:12:44] what hold up hold up hold up
[1:12:48] i was going dong with you over the road
[1:12:50] with here but not my benjamin
[1:12:52] not no no no no and bring your youngest
[1:12:56] brother unto me
[1:12:57] then shall i know that he are no spies
[1:12:59] but that he are true men
[1:13:01] so will i deliver you your brother and
[1:13:03] you shall traffic in the land
[1:13:07] and it came to pass as they empty their
[1:13:09] sacks that behold
[1:13:10] every man's bundle of money was in his
[1:13:13] sack
[1:13:14] and when both they and their father saw
[1:13:16] the bundles of money they were afraid
[1:13:18] they plural even jacob and jacob their
[1:13:22] father said unto them me
[1:13:23] have he be read of my children
[1:13:26] joseph is not and simeon is not
[1:13:30] and he will take benjamin away all these
[1:13:32] things are against me
[1:13:35] now you see how as a father
[1:13:39] he is processing this thing here
[1:13:49] and reuben
[1:13:52] speak unto his father
[1:13:56] saying slay my two sons
[1:14:00] so this is like parts of scripture where
[1:14:01] i try to
[1:14:03] figure out you know that you know
[1:14:05] something there are people who try to
[1:14:06] bring solutions and you look at them and
[1:14:07] be like
[1:14:08] get just go order room
[1:14:15] you know they say when they brainstorm
[1:14:16] in all ideas play it on a table there
[1:14:18] some people will be like
[1:14:19] we brainstorm and leave him audio room
[1:14:21] and reuben speaking if i'm saying slay
[1:14:23] my two sons
[1:14:24] if i bring him not to be how'd that
[1:14:26] solve any problem how
[1:14:27] exactly is that solving the problem at
[1:14:29] hand kill my two sons
[1:14:31] if i bring him up today deliver him into
[1:14:33] my hand and i will bring him to thee
[1:14:34] again
[1:14:36] reuben's saying if i go down with
[1:14:38] benjamin i do i don't bring mark
[1:14:39] benjamin
[1:14:40] kill my two sons that making sense
[1:14:43] but i have to give rubella at least a
[1:14:45] for effort he's trying none of the other
[1:14:46] ones at least offer any kind of solution
[1:14:48] ruben didn't make no sense but at least
[1:14:51] he tried he had an idea
[1:14:52] it's better to have a idea that is a bad
[1:14:55] idea and no idea at all
[1:14:56] so reuben at least had an idea he said
[1:14:58] if i go with benjamin
[1:14:59] and benjamin do not come back kill my
[1:15:01] two sons and that will solve the problem
[1:15:05] jacob made up his mind he said verse 38
[1:15:08] and he said
[1:15:09] my son shall not go down with you for
[1:15:12] his brother is dead
[1:15:14] and he is left alone if mister befall
[1:15:16] him by the way in which you go
[1:15:18] then shall he bring down my gray hairs
[1:15:20] with sorrow to be grieved
[1:15:22] all right so in the amplified it says
[1:15:24] but jacob said my son shall not go down
[1:15:26] to egypt with you
[1:15:27] for his brother's dead meaning joseph
[1:15:29] and he alone is left of rachel's
[1:15:31] children
[1:15:32] remember jacob and rachel so this is
[1:15:34] only two children rachel had so i don't
[1:15:36] lose
[1:15:37] one i'm not losing this one if any harm
[1:15:39] or accident should happen to him on the
[1:15:40] journey
[1:15:41] you are taken then you will bring my
[1:15:42] gray hair down to sure
[1:15:44] you're placing that in sorrow right so
[1:15:46] could we take a little more could we
[1:15:47] just go into in the verse 43
[1:15:52] so again verse 43
[1:15:56] verse 42 ends with jacob making up his
[1:15:59] mind
[1:16:00] that he's not going we're not going
[1:16:03] we're not going
[1:16:04] benjamin not going we're not going we're
[1:16:06] not going
[1:16:07] but then verse 43 starts with the famine
[1:16:10] was sore in the land in other words
[1:16:12] crisis intensifies
[1:16:17] in other words the situation gets worse
[1:16:19] so you can't just you have to
[1:16:21] re-evaluate your position
[1:16:24] you know you have people who who who
[1:16:25] make a decision i ain't changing my mind
[1:16:27] i change my mind
[1:16:28] in my mind well sometimes it will come
[1:16:30] in life you have to change your mind
[1:16:32] and the famine was so in the land you
[1:16:35] have to re-evaluate the situation
[1:16:38] and it came to pass when they had eaten
[1:16:40] up the corn
[1:16:41] corn is done which they had brought out
[1:16:45] of egypt their father said to them go
[1:16:47] again buy us a little food
[1:16:49] this is now jacob realizing that again
[1:16:52] if
[1:16:53] this is like the beginning of 42 if we
[1:16:55] take no action
[1:16:57] all are we including benjamin everybody
[1:16:58] did
[1:17:01] and judah speaking i'm saying the man
[1:17:05] did solemnly protest unto us saying
[1:17:08] you shall not see my face except your
[1:17:11] brother be with you
[1:17:12] so judah is saying the man tell us if we
[1:17:14] coming back we better bring our brother
[1:17:16] so this idea you have unless you're
[1:17:18] willing to change your mind
[1:17:20] this is not going to happen
[1:17:24] judah is saying now if god will send our
[1:17:27] brother with us
[1:17:28] we will go down and buy the food
[1:17:31] verse 5 but if god will not send him we
[1:17:34] will not go down for the man said unto
[1:17:36] us
[1:17:36] you shall not see my face except your
[1:17:38] brother be with you
[1:17:41] look at verse six so it's a lot at play
[1:17:44] here
[1:17:48] now this is we don't know how much time
[1:17:50] passed but
[1:17:52] you know when you're going back to
[1:17:53] situations and i say why why are your
[1:17:55] moves so
[1:17:55] here here here here jacob now
[1:18:00] israel and isn't it wherefore dead he's
[1:18:02] so ill with me as a telling man whether
[1:18:04] you had yet a brother
[1:18:06] so jacob now go on back in time and
[1:18:08] rewind
[1:18:09] and let me read any amplified so he
[1:18:11] seeker he said and israel jacob said
[1:18:13] why you treat me so badly by telling the
[1:18:15] man that you had another brother
[1:18:17] and they have another in italics as in
[1:18:20] to emphasize is another brother so in
[1:18:22] other words why would they open on their
[1:18:23] mouth and talk if
[1:18:24] they just go down there and buy the food
[1:18:26] and come back home and i'll talk all
[1:18:27] this talk we wouldn't be going through
[1:18:28] this all i go back and forth back and
[1:18:30] forth bringing food
[1:18:31] i don't have the stress why are they
[1:18:32] open all about
[1:18:35] verse seven and they said the man asked
[1:18:38] us straightly of our state
[1:18:42] and of our kindred so now we are getting
[1:18:45] pieces in verse 43 of the conversation
[1:18:49] from
[1:18:49] from chapter from we're getting pieces
[1:18:51] in chapter 43
[1:18:53] of the conversation that took place in
[1:18:54] chapter 42
[1:18:56] that moses knows how to give some
[1:18:58] clarity to the nature of the
[1:19:00] conversation
[1:19:01] the man asked us strictly of our state
[1:19:03] and our kindred saying
[1:19:04] is your father yet alive it's not the
[1:19:06] kind of question that someone would ask
[1:19:09] have he another brother because he knows
[1:19:11] ten he knew benjamin benjamin was a
[1:19:12] little younger than him there
[1:19:13] so it is natural interest and the
[1:19:16] question would have been genuine
[1:19:17] question so
[1:19:18] so these brothers would not think any
[1:19:20] malicious thing about it
[1:19:22] you know have you another brother and we
[1:19:24] told him according to the tenor
[1:19:27] tenor of those words is is to speak to
[1:19:29] the tone the quality
[1:19:31] the nature of the questions it was it
[1:19:33] was genuine question of genuine interest
[1:19:36] so it came to us he was asking genuine
[1:19:39] questions about us
[1:19:40] so we answered there was no reason to
[1:19:42] think he wanted anything malicious
[1:19:45] look what he said could we could we
[1:19:47] certainly know that he would say bring
[1:19:49] your brother down
[1:19:50] so this is jacob's still dealing it's an
[1:19:52] argument in the aussie you know if what
[1:19:53] i did shut up
[1:19:54] i'll not have to deal with this but
[1:19:55] daddy the man was asking us nice
[1:19:58] questions
[1:19:58] if we found our life if you have an
[1:20:00] ex-brother i mean the way he asks the
[1:20:01] question i don't think he's going to ask
[1:20:03] me to bring you down don't get vex with
[1:20:04] us
[1:20:05] and judah said unto israel's father send
[1:20:08] the lad
[1:20:08] with me verse 8 and we will arise and go
[1:20:12] that we may live so judah for the first
[1:20:15] time now bring in a level of context
[1:20:18] now you remember that when we were
[1:20:21] speaking about joseph
[1:20:22] the story of judah and timah was slid in
[1:20:25] there
[1:20:26] and i was saying that because of the
[1:20:28] importance of judah
[1:20:29] out of all the sons of jacob he is
[1:20:32] a unique son because out of judah is the
[1:20:35] lion of the tribe of judah
[1:20:36] so judah himself has a special role
[1:20:40] a special transition judah was also the
[1:20:42] one who
[1:20:43] said send him down to egypt so he has to
[1:20:45] know get recalibrated
[1:20:47] he has to now speak differently he has
[1:20:49] to have a change in nature to be worthy
[1:20:52] to be out of the alignment
[1:20:53] of judah right so here judah now begins
[1:20:55] to reposition out of all the brothers
[1:20:58] reuben had a brilliant idea kill my two
[1:20:59] boys but now judah coming now with a
[1:21:01] whole different positioning
[1:21:03] and judas is telling the israelites
[1:21:05] father send the lad with me and we will
[1:21:06] arise and go that we may live and not
[1:21:08] die
[1:21:09] both we and dao and also our little ones
[1:21:12] i will be surety for him
[1:21:14] of my hand shall do require him if i
[1:21:16] bring him not unto me
[1:21:18] and set him before thee then let me bear
[1:21:20] the blame forever
[1:21:22] so judah is saying i am willing to take
[1:21:24] full responsibility
[1:21:26] full responsibility is a manager's
[1:21:28] situation
[1:21:29] here it is judah is now actually
[1:21:31] beginning to
[1:21:32] to to show signs of undoing what he did
[1:21:36] earlier
[1:21:37] he has now taken responsibility for
[1:21:39] restoration not even understanding the
[1:21:41] role he is playing in restoration
[1:21:43] right
[1:21:47] verse 10 for except we had lingered
[1:21:52] with the skeptics here
[1:21:55] for if we are not in the amplified
[1:21:57] support if we had not delayed like this
[1:21:59] surely by now we would have returned the
[1:22:00] second time
[1:22:01] so judaism we don't have time to waste
[1:22:03] let us stop this argument
[1:22:04] because the more time we spend talking
[1:22:06] about talking about this it just makes
[1:22:07] it worse for us
[1:22:08] so a decision has to be made very
[1:22:09] practical very pointed
[1:22:12] except we had lingered solely now we
[1:22:13] would have returned the second time in
[1:22:14] other words
[1:22:15] if we had acted when we should have
[1:22:17] acted and carried benjamin back
[1:22:19] we would already have food eating right
[1:22:21] now all right
[1:22:22] and their father israel said unto them
[1:22:25] if it must be so
[1:22:27] so he took judah's advice
[1:22:31] and it's it's powerful this is a father
[1:22:33] the same father who had to light fire on
[1:22:35] them
[1:22:36] in the beginning of 42 is not being
[1:22:39] presented
[1:22:40] with arguments to make him change his
[1:22:42] position
[1:22:44] so i tell people all the time listen
[1:22:48] if you want to present something to me
[1:22:49] that's a different direction explain it
[1:22:51] justify it
[1:22:53] make it make sense but you can't just
[1:22:56] say we want to do it because i want to
[1:22:57] do it
[1:22:58] so judah's argument was sound it was on
[1:23:00] point
[1:23:01] it came across with sincerity it came
[1:23:03] across with honesty we
[1:23:04] we're going to close soon so the father
[1:23:07] changed his position
[1:23:09] all right so the father is saying to
[1:23:11] them if it must be so now
[1:23:13] do this take up the best fruits in the
[1:23:16] land
[1:23:17] in your vessels and carry down the
[1:23:19] manner present
[1:23:20] [Laughter]
[1:23:22] go along with a gift a little balm
[1:23:25] and a little honey spices and milk nuts
[1:23:29] and almonds
[1:23:29] now this here is wisdom in demonstration
[1:23:33] this is what judah and they might think
[1:23:34] about jacob in his
[1:23:37] in his maturity is thinking about how
[1:23:39] can we appease this how can i guarantee
[1:23:41] this thing how can i
[1:23:42] what else can i do that this thing could
[1:23:44] be as smooth as possible
[1:23:48] and verse 12 and take double money in
[1:23:50] your hand
[1:23:53] so judah is wearing everything and the
[1:23:54] money that was brought again in the
[1:23:56] amount of your sacks so that's
[1:23:57] double money plus the money that came
[1:24:00] back to you so that is three times the
[1:24:01] money
[1:24:02] you there is three portions of money
[1:24:03] you're going down to each of it
[1:24:05] carry it again in your hand per
[1:24:07] adventure it was an oversight
[1:24:10] take also your brother and her eyes go
[1:24:12] again unto the man
[1:24:14] and god almighty give you mercy before
[1:24:17] the man
[1:24:18] now it's so interesting that i keep
[1:24:19] calling him the man the man the man the
[1:24:20] man the man
[1:24:21] and they're talking about their brother
[1:24:22] and the son
[1:24:25] you know how sometimes people say they
[1:24:26] have a problem with the man they call
[1:24:28] the government the man they call this
[1:24:29] money man demanding man
[1:24:30] we're going for the man they call he
[1:24:31] boss the man and and here it is you
[1:24:33] don't understand that the man they
[1:24:34] dealing with here
[1:24:35] is the brother and the son so now you
[1:24:37] see how things
[1:24:38] may not appear as radia right
[1:24:43] and god almighty verse 14 give you mercy
[1:24:46] before the man
[1:24:47] that he may send away your other brother
[1:24:50] and benjamin
[1:24:51] if i be bereaved of my children i am
[1:24:53] bereaved
[1:24:54] and the men took that present and they
[1:24:57] took double money in their hand
[1:24:58] and benjamin and rose up and went down
[1:25:00] to egypt
[1:25:01] and stood before joseph and when joseph
[1:25:04] saw
[1:25:05] benjamin with them he said to the ruler
[1:25:07] of his house
[1:25:08] bring these men home and slay and make
[1:25:12] ready for these men shall dine with me
[1:25:15] at noon you imagine the the
[1:25:18] mental drew these brothers they don't
[1:25:21] understand what's going on
[1:25:22] they can't figure that one minute they
[1:25:24] have been accused of spies
[1:25:25] next minute they end prepared for a
[1:25:27] feast and the man did as joseph bade
[1:25:30] and the man brought the men into
[1:25:32] joseph's house and the men were afraid
[1:25:35] naturally because they were brought into
[1:25:37] joseph's house
[1:25:38] and they said because of the money that
[1:25:40] was retaining our sacks
[1:25:42] at the first time are we brought in that
[1:25:44] he may seek
[1:25:45] occasion against us in other words he
[1:25:48] may seek an opportunity against us
[1:25:49] and fall upon us and take us for bond
[1:25:52] men
[1:25:52] and our asses so in other words you're
[1:25:54] going to take everything now i want us
[1:25:56] to catch
[1:25:58] what guilt makes you do
[1:26:02] because of their guilt because of their
[1:26:04] fear
[1:26:05] they are seeing in this situation what
[1:26:08] is not real
[1:26:11] we we're going to close it in a bit you
[1:26:13] see when you have a distorted perception
[1:26:15] of your
[1:26:15] of of of your reality you see things
[1:26:18] only from your own lenses
[1:26:20] joseph not trying to kill them jews are
[1:26:22] not trying to put them in prison
[1:26:23] those are not trying to make them slaves
[1:26:25] but they're dealing with their own
[1:26:27] issues
[1:26:28] and their own issues is creating a false
[1:26:31] reality
[1:26:33] i want us to see this there in this is
[1:26:36] all in their minds
[1:26:37] they are they have built a false story
[1:26:40] of what is happening
[1:26:41] a narrative that is not accurate because
[1:26:44] of their own
[1:26:44] personal issues you
[1:26:48] you you see this you see if you don't
[1:26:50] have the truth and the reality of the
[1:26:52] truth how you can make
[1:26:53] your own world a crazy messed up world
[1:26:56] by your own devices and your own
[1:26:57] imagination
[1:26:58] that's imagination run wild right there
[1:27:03] verse 19 and they came near to the
[1:27:06] steward of joseph's house
[1:27:07] and they communaled him at the dorby
[1:27:09] house commune here don't just mean to
[1:27:11] okay
[1:27:11] it's like they tried to pull him in the
[1:27:12] confidence
[1:27:15] listen listen also we came indeed the
[1:27:18] first time to buy food
[1:27:19] we did this i don't know we don't tell
[1:27:21] nobody they say but here it is
[1:27:23] we about to go to the house but before
[1:27:24] we go in the house and we get killed
[1:27:26] because we believe we don't get killed
[1:27:28] or two in prison so but
[1:27:30] you know we look like we could talk i
[1:27:31] just let you know we came the first time
[1:27:33] and we brought money and it came to pass
[1:27:35] when we came to the end that we opened
[1:27:37] our sacks
[1:27:38] and behold every man's money was an
[1:27:39] emotive sack our money and full weight
[1:27:42] and we have brought it again in our hand
[1:27:46] and the other money have we brought down
[1:27:47] in our hand to buy food we cannot tell
[1:27:49] who put our money in our socks
[1:27:54] and the man of the gate say he said
[1:27:56] peace be unto you fear not
[1:27:58] your god and the god of your father
[1:28:01] had given you treasure in your sacks
[1:28:04] i had your money and he brought simeon
[1:28:07] out unto them
[1:28:08] you imagine the emotions therefore i
[1:28:10] said no what going on
[1:28:12] and the man brought the men into
[1:28:13] joseph's house and gave them water
[1:28:16] and they washed their feet and he gave
[1:28:18] their asses proven in other words he
[1:28:20] feed the animals
[1:28:20] and they made already the present and
[1:28:23] and they
[1:28:24] the men the brothers
[1:28:27] they made ready the present against
[1:28:29] joseph
[1:28:31] at noon for they heard they would eat
[1:28:33] bread there and when joseph came home
[1:28:36] they brought him the present which was
[1:28:37] in their hand into the house
[1:28:39] and bowled themselves to him to the
[1:28:41] earth
[1:28:42] again prophecy dream ministry being
[1:28:45] unfair
[1:28:46] and unveiling so josephine will watch
[1:28:48] and process all of this
[1:28:50] and he asks them of their welfare how
[1:28:52] are you doing
[1:28:53] how was he trip you see how you could be
[1:28:56] going to your own issues on somebody
[1:28:58] genuinely interested but in your mind
[1:29:00] you're like you want to kill me you know
[1:29:01] look how did you try to kill my this
[1:29:03] i don't know what to say so now you're
[1:29:04] measuring your words and said
[1:29:07] is your father well the old man of whom
[1:29:09] you speak
[1:29:10] is yet alive and the answer thy servant
[1:29:13] or father is in good health
[1:29:15] he's yet alive and they're bowed down
[1:29:17] their heads and made obesions so now
[1:29:19] fellas
[1:29:20] going through now every time they get to
[1:29:21] bow they're born
[1:29:25] these same brothers back in the
[1:29:27] beginning see we will never bow
[1:29:29] we never go bowl now we bought every two
[1:29:31] minutes they're boring
[1:29:32] we finally good brother good the family
[1:29:36] good
[1:29:36] the call is good everything good
[1:29:39] everything that is it but in obesity
[1:29:42] and he lifted up his eyes and saw his
[1:29:44] brother benjamin his mother's son
[1:29:48] i wonder what emotion is going through
[1:29:50] him at this point in time because if
[1:29:52] that takes a supreme level of control
[1:29:55] and said is this your younger brother of
[1:29:58] whom
[1:29:59] you speak unto me and he said god be
[1:30:02] gracious and to be my son
[1:30:08] hallelujah i'm almost done could he take
[1:30:11] some more
[1:30:12] almost we almost trying to wrap up here
[1:30:14] i just wanna
[1:30:16] and joseph made his for his bowers
[1:30:18] they'd earn upon his brother in the
[1:30:20] amplified that's it and joseph
[1:30:21] hurried out of the room because his
[1:30:24] heart was
[1:30:25] deeply touched over his brother
[1:30:29] so this is the second encounter and this
[1:30:31] is even
[1:30:32] even more emotional than
[1:30:35] his experience when he heard him
[1:30:37] speaking about him
[1:30:41] and joseph made haste for his brother
[1:30:43] that you and a bunch brother and he
[1:30:44] sought
[1:30:44] where to weep lord help us so joseph is
[1:30:48] looking for a place to cry
[1:30:51] this is this is a lot you know
[1:30:54] this is this is human this is this is
[1:30:57] there's nothing against joseph we
[1:30:58] preached about joseph but
[1:30:59] this is the man going through the
[1:31:01] experience he now sought where to weep
[1:31:03] and he entered into his chamber this is
[1:31:05] like you're you're in a situation and
[1:31:07] you're you want to get away you don't
[1:31:08] want nobody to see this level you don't
[1:31:09] want to wait to see your vulnerability
[1:31:11] you don't want anybody to see how this
[1:31:13] has an effect on you
[1:31:14] and your and you're trying to find a
[1:31:16] place where you could get a loan away
[1:31:18] from everybody else
[1:31:19] and he entered his chamber and wept
[1:31:22] there
[1:31:28] i'm about to close and he washed his
[1:31:30] face
[1:31:33] why would he wash his face he doesn't
[1:31:36] want nobody to know
[1:31:38] he doesn't want but you know it still
[1:31:40] hurts
[1:31:42] it still hurts there's still
[1:31:46] pain there not just the pain of the past
[1:31:50] but the pain of the missed opportunities
[1:31:53] the pain of the relationship that should
[1:31:54] have been there that wasn't this was his
[1:31:56] brother the pain of the years that he
[1:31:59] and his brother could have spent
[1:32:00] together
[1:32:00] and they didn't the pain of
[1:32:03] eating christmas dinner together that
[1:32:05] didn't happen
[1:32:07] the pain of new year's greetings
[1:32:10] for 20 years that didn't happen
[1:32:13] all of this is there captured in that
[1:32:15] moment
[1:32:17] he washed his face and went out
[1:32:20] and refrained himself you hear me keep
[1:32:23] saying
[1:32:24] it takes a lot of control
[1:32:27] a lot of control
[1:32:31] verse 31 then he washed his face and
[1:32:34] came out
[1:32:35] and restraining himself that's the
[1:32:36] amplified said let the meal be served
[1:32:41] we all have moments when we restrain
[1:32:43] ourselves
[1:32:45] we all have moments when we don't want
[1:32:46] nobody to see the vulnerability
[1:32:48] of our lives whatever situation it is
[1:32:51] here it is
[1:32:53] nothing against joseph i'm getting ready
[1:32:54] to close out here
[1:32:59] and they set on for him by himself
[1:33:06] verse 32 in the amplified so the servant
[1:33:08] served joseph by himself
[1:33:10] in honor of his rank
[1:33:14] in other words joseph didn't at that
[1:33:16] point he can even eat with him
[1:33:19] he eat by himself
[1:33:23] maybe he didn't have the strength to sit
[1:33:24] with them to eat
[1:33:26] maybe he didn't want to break down again
[1:33:30] but just he thought that they were fine
[1:33:32] and they were there his father was fine
[1:33:34] the family was there
[1:33:35] and they were in the same room was
[1:33:37] enough
[1:33:38] sometimes that's just enough to know
[1:33:42] that they're okay
[1:33:44] and they set on him set on for him by
[1:33:47] himself
[1:33:48] and for them by themselves in the
[1:33:50] amplified i'm getting ready to close so
[1:33:52] the servant served joseph by himself in
[1:33:54] honor of his rank
[1:33:55] and his brothers by themselves and the
[1:33:58] egyptians who ate by with them by
[1:33:59] themselves
[1:34:00] because according to customs the
[1:34:02] egyptians could not eat food
[1:34:04] with the hebrews for that is load some
[1:34:06] to the egyptians
[1:34:09] so it still gives you the context of all
[1:34:11] that is happening there
[1:34:13] and they sat before him the first born
[1:34:16] according to his birthright
[1:34:18] and the youngest according to his ute
[1:34:20] and the men
[1:34:21] marveled at one another marveled at one
[1:34:24] another because they couldn't
[1:34:26] understand they couldn't figure out what
[1:34:28] is going on
[1:34:33] so understand this as well so understand
[1:34:36] what is happening
[1:34:37] so now joseph brother was seated by the
[1:34:39] stuart in the amplified because
[1:34:40] it's it's something easy to miss this so
[1:34:43] joseph stewart
[1:34:45] basically placed the sons of jacob
[1:34:49] in order of age around the table
[1:34:54] so they were marveling at how
[1:34:57] the stuart would know who is first born
[1:35:00] to who is youngest in exact order i want
[1:35:02] us to understand what that's saying
[1:35:04] there in scripture
[1:35:06] so them them fellas going through a real
[1:35:08] real real experience
[1:35:10] and they sat before him the first born
[1:35:12] of contest but right and the youngest
[1:35:13] according to is youth and the men
[1:35:15] marvel at one another in the amber fight
[1:35:17] in the order of their birth
[1:35:19] all right and he took
[1:35:22] and sent messes unto them messes
[1:35:25] mess hallel senior army toward so he
[1:35:27] told the portion of food
[1:35:30] and joseph selected and sent portions to
[1:35:32] them from his own table
[1:35:35] but benjamin's portion was five times as
[1:35:38] much as any of this
[1:35:42] five times only seen that
[1:35:47] and he took a certain on them from
[1:35:49] before him but benjamin's mess was five
[1:35:52] times so much as
[1:35:53] any of this and they drank and will
[1:35:54] marry with him
[1:35:57] so that brother come and it's five times
[1:35:59] his grace grace grace says you know so
[1:36:01] that's it for tonight let's just bow
[1:36:03] here with our prayer
[1:36:05] our heavenly father lord we thank you
[1:36:07] tonight lord for
[1:36:09] the magnitude lord of this simple
[1:36:12] bible story as it were lord and how we
[1:36:15] can see so much
[1:36:16] in our own lives lord and how you
[1:36:19] put it all here in the word in scripture
[1:36:22] these subtle messages that we could
[1:36:24] look now in 2021
[1:36:27] and see how much order how much of
[1:36:30] the story the emotions the the elements
[1:36:33] of it that you
[1:36:34] you have kept here that we can look at
[1:36:36] it and see
[1:36:37] what each person is going through and
[1:36:39] how you were working your way out and
[1:36:40] how you were dealing with each one and
[1:36:42] dealing with their lives and lord how
[1:36:44] you are so interested in how everything

[1:37:01] of us
[1:37:02] given the opportunity where we were down
[1:37:04] and we now in power
[1:37:05] we would take the opportunity to just
[1:37:07] retaliate and respond
[1:37:09] but we see joseph who he didn't
[1:37:12] retaliate
[1:37:13] he didn't have a negative response he is
[1:37:16] working towards reconciliation
