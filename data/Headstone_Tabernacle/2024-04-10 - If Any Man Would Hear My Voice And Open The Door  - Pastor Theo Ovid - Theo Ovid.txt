all the way all the way Hallelujah all the way the way Hallelujah [Music] GL GL all the way all the way God bless you and welcome so good to be here this evening and uh we have some how do you say it sad news and and glad news sad news but the Peter chandel passed away today and um um it felt at first like a gut a punch in the gut and um but God knows all things I had the privilege of being with him in Ivory Coast and I preached for him up the last Wednesday I came back on on on Friday and to hear this news was just stunning but it just reminds us that this is not the only life that we're not here forever and we have uh our long home yes sir I like to say this way brother Peter's gone to his long home uh his work on Earth is complete and we want to pray for his wife and family and church before we go further tonight and as I told my wife I said all this is a wake up call because this shows us who is in charge this shows us who's in charge and it begs to wonder uh people's attitude people's behavior people bitterness anger and and hatred and Malice and plain plain wickedness and mockery of Christianity expect to wonder what people think this life is all about you work to live and you live to die you work hard to get stuff and gain stuff and yet a man's life doesn't consist of the things that he possess it and you fight to possess things that canot take you over Yonder and here it is I'm looking forward for him to be in our meetings in July to minister for us here it is we have plans we have thoughts and God have a different thought because when the saints of God cross over God see I bring a son home I bring a child home Hallelujah and then to think because you know I processed things a certain way it hit me it was effective of me and afterwards I said I begin to think how God sees it how God thinks it it's not gone too soon it's gone the right time he has set us boundaries that we cannot cross we think we can cross them but we can't he set those boundaries and as long as we live the best thing to do is to live uh you know like Ram says live live a life that is worthy of the gospel live a life that will be pleasing to God live a life that will glorify God and this was his first time in IV coast and he it was tremendous the anointing the atmosphere the Believers and it was I told him I said brother Peter I so glad you choose to come because other brothers could make a different situations came up and it happened that uh uh he had to take two Services I took two services but Sala took one and but Paul own jaob closed off the last service and exalted us and have a prayer line and and afterwards I came back to London and and preached my brother Peter um Wednesday night and the Lord blessed and it was quite an experience and I didn't have a clue that that was the last time I'll be seeing my brother I didn't have a clue but God knows all things and it it tells us how we have to work we don't have this as I told somebody you know I see bigger fish fryer people have attitudes and they figure they big and they own and they walk with this aggression and you know two piece of money in the pocket and they figure they own and whatnot and afterwards everything kept crumbling but it's lessons for us to learn it's things for us to think about and as we approach the service this evening I want you to think about what you need deliverance from and what you need a breakthrough I want you to have that in your heart because deliverance and breakthroughs is personal it has to be what ticken inside of you a lot of us I don't know why I'm talking this now I'll just talk a lot of us we tend to look outwardly we tend to see what others are doing to justify our own stuff to justify our own self and we make excuses but when come face to face with us and the word there's nobody else to see you can't see this one that one well she doing it he doing it this one no no you don't see that that you see yourself and that is where we have to come to each one of us not I'm in the message forget that forget that the message is the gospel which is a transformation in your heart and life the Bible speaks about a human heart is desperately wicked who can know it about God who could really know what's inside somebody's heart what's in your child heart what's in your husband heart what in your wife heart who could really know what's in but God knows and he knows it's wicked inside of there just a matter of time you know that's why he said a new heart I'll give you because you know the wicked one we have can't work a a heart towards God an attitude towards God an attitude towards his people then he said I'll give you a new spirit Oh Glory to God that you can get along with your neighbor get along with the word and then God could prepare you to get his Spirit a new heart a heart towards God a new spirit that you could get along with others and then God could give you his spirit that you could continue to obey his word and walk in the light of his word this is what become to Church to do to learn of him to learn who this God Is to learn his requirements and want to obey it to resist the devil to resist temptation to resist evil not say a given a given a given no you have to resist by resisting you show you love God by resisting you know you're coming in obedience to God by resisting what the devil have to offer Oh Glory to God is not anything goes this is what the society want to bring to us anything goes but that's not God program God told his son and daughter in G the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die he told them that he told Adam that Adam told Eve that and the devil was still able to come use the serpent to give them a different picture all together we want to correct all of that because the prophet said this end time bride will not be like Eve she will not fall like Eve glory to God hallelujah praise God he said that woman was made to be deceived and be deceived deceive and be deceived deceive is when you're thinking right when you actually think in your SP Spirit you are right and you're dead wrong and you go bully down the road like that that was Eve think she right and look at us today dying people only a matter of time you know oh yes only a matter of time that's why youth is Vanity beauty is Vanity handsome and good-looking vanity after 50 years what what what US is all about that's what you're used to be you look at them black and white pictures you look at the old photos in the photo magazine but that disappear so all so when you so so so so the conclusion of the matter fear God and obey his commands fear God because he keeps his word and I don't think the people catch that years have been seing this message the message has not seen judgment yet the message world has not seen God's judgment that is why they continue in the behavior and the attitude the same God that brought them out of Egypt killed them two million people same God he brought them out and he judged them that same God is not the mayor of ARA or the mayor of San Grandy or the mayor of Trinidad you're serving it's not the Prime Minister you're serving you when you come you come to serve God Almighty when Moses brought them to the mountain and the fire had to shake they said don't let God speak let Moses speak and then God said good I will send you men that will be my mouthpiece and that is where the phrase come man shall live by bread alone but every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so God put His prophets as his mouthpiece so when they speak it's different when they speak it's judgment when they speak is God speaking it's not man speaking and after the Prophet come it have faithful ministers and Messengers to Echo the same thing the prophet have said God sent a message in this last day a way you think about it you could have be a Baptist you could be a Hindu Muslim Pentecostal Jehovah Witness whatever but God call you out not for you to be backsliding inside the church not for you to be dead inside the church God call you out for a purpose praise God you see brother Peter Chandler he was a genuine Christian just like brother zigma Coen brener these are genuine people see their life see their walk see their attitude no hidden agenda no no no funny business genuine people it are few like them praise God and for years I've been watching him I know him and I tell myself anytime I get an opportunity I will try to connect with him and get back back on you know how I know him and so like that because he was treated terribly in years ago and I said if I get a chance I will try to see if I could get that corrected and the first opportunity I got and inviting preach that he said brother what the other minister might think I said forget that they would appreciate they would love and and it was appreciated and and he was a blessing and so on and what not he has a certain personality type everybody not have the same personality type somebody are passive somebody aggressive some people are militant some people are this way and that way God build different people and and have them a certain way and you cannot choose how God set up that man because God buil that man from his mother's womb God loose that man a certain kind of a way I am built a certain way I Dem manage a certain way you can change that I can't even change that I'm built a certain way praise God because we have spirits to deal with it's not no joke plating if you caral and natural and you don't know what going inside of here you think I could take size you I could pick this brother and pick this sister I have no time for that everybody have cases everybody have condition everybody have challenges everybody looking for a breakthrough that's why you here today you're looking for a breakthrough you're looking for deliverance that's what you here for you Ain come here to pose you come here to show your clothes you come here to get delivered from you oh give the Lord sh did you get that you come here to get delivered from you from your own self from your own thoughts and ideas that is what you come to get delivered from they get a revolution in your mind a revolution in your thinking and don't bring your old wise fables and what your grandmother tell you and when your grandfather tell you to kick them foolishness out and somebody tell you you can't make it and this and that forget [Music] that Jesus come to free people from their past from their fears from their sin to get them delivered and he said who the son of man set free is free indeed you could go free this evening free from your past free from your sins free from your [Applause] fears Glory one major thing hinder that freedom is your pride pride is a killer you know oh yes because you had to humble yourself if Jesus said go and dip seven times you have to dip seven times not in the water you want in the water he said to go by go along in dirty Jordan and dip seven times Oh Glory to God do what God tell you not this is not a party you party how you want you eat what you want this is not buff style business this is the Lord said this is thus sayth the Lord but give the Lord a shout in the house this is what you have to come to to obey Hallelujah this God said If my people that is called by my name not everybody else this is my people now if to call by my name shall humble themselves and pray you can't pray and then humble you have to Humble first to pray if you don't humble yourself your prayer will not be effective Oh Glory to God humility brings you down humility acts you don't know about it you don't understand it you have to humble yourself and then pray oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises if you can humble yourself you're wasting prayer you only saying prayers like those Pharisees you're only saying stuff humble yourself God I don't know yes Lord I failure Lord I'm miserable Lord I'm no good when an anointing hit Isaiah he said he say who is me not who is them who is them mothers who is my sister who is my brother he said who is me you have to come to that spot you're wretched in yourself and you're Bing looking at this one looking that one you pick and choose because you're looking at the eyes of humans a fancy car means what a big house means what a plane means what you fly here and fly there means what that is nothing time and chance happen to all man glory to God God could have put you and your father could have be a multi-millionaire time and chance happen to all man but that don't mean you was going to be in the gospel God choose a root for the gospel to come to you there's a road that God choose for you to pass there's a road that just cut off for you for the go to come to you you didn't choose it God choose it God brought you out no man can come except the father draw [Applause] [Music] me one day I'm going to preach on that scripture elizah when God said what iniquity have you found in me that's a scripture you know what iniquity have you found in me I treat you bad didn't I forgive you didn't I bring you out didn't you take up my name and I answer your prayer God bless people and afterward they turn their back on him God bless people and afterward they don't even talk to God no more God bless people and they Curse God and curse this one but they same out they bless God they cursing somebody else what iniquity have you found in me that you turn your back on me I'm going to get to the scripture hallelujah hallelujah humble yourself that's why some people don't get their prayer answered because they're praying but there's no humility God have to break your spirit to Humble you something has to happen to defeat you God resist the proud you're a Christian and you're proud he pushing you back in the spirit realm you're trying to go forward and you can't go you can't get no breakthrough Hallelujah the pride hindering you your pride like chains your Pride CH I'm talking to somebody tonight

can some you can see somebody fall some sister and she pregnant she B sh what about them who having sex and your belly not showing fornicating and nothing happening but you're sitting down with a

overcoming the word overcome of course you know what it means you've got to have something to overcome and this church age the Holy Spirit was speaking about here in laia church age as we have just been through it needed a rebuking laia had to be rebuked because it was in it's different towards Christ it put Christ out outside and Christ was trying to get back on the inside that is love after he had been put out of his own house was trying to come back in he that will open the door I'll come into him see the church itself the whole that put him out but notice his call here is not to just the church he that overcome it not the church he the church body it's he that overcometh the individual that will overcome now so he's not talking to church this not church folks this is the individual this is you you got to make your choice Hallelujah I love making choices Hallelujah you see because when when you don't act you make excuses so tell somebody if I help you and I want to help you and I give I help you with what land house money whatever it is and you curse me and you hate me afterwards it must I must never say I shouldn't have helped you I must never said that this is how I live I help you because I choose to if you turn down and curse me afterwards that is your choice but I wanted to help you you could curse me afterwards if you want but that's my choice so I have no regrets helping you because it was my choice and that's how I live that's how I encourage my children to live live by the actions that you chose to do not by your reactions he hit me therefore hit him back that's you reacting he cured me therefore I cuss him back that's you reacting when you choose to give blessings is it a cursing that's that's that's you a different realm all together so you got to choose your actions you make a decision to serve Christ that is your choice your brother don't want to serve him that is his business your mother don't want to serve it that is his her business your father that is his business but you make a choice I am going to serve God myself if my brother not going I going if my father not going I am going I'm not depending upon anybody to serve the Lord it is my choice oh give the Lord some Praises it's got to be your choice your choice to praise your choice to worship your choice to want a breakthrough your choice to want Deliverance it got to be your choice to humble yourself your choice to hit the altar Lord your choice say help me I'm sinking your choice glory of God Peter was walking on the water then he start to sink he had tried backstroke FR stroke you know I want people look like I I a know what doing so he trying to pretending Peter could swim he was a fisherman but he did the writing he said help me I am sinking Hallelujah some of you sinking but your pride go nothing that go working help me I'm sinking I want Deliverance I want you to pull me out the mess I am and only only you could pull me out of it and I come tonight for a hand a hand I come tonight for a rope that I could hold on to and and a hand come and pull me out pull me out of my situation pull me out of my condition Oh Glory to God rip the veil of what's hindering me hindering my home H in my house glory to God hallelujah praise God we come for extra prayer tonight you know don't you don't know what attacks of the enemy loose against you loose against your family loose against your house and you are here because we come here to break the PS of wickedness we come here by the anointing of God to speak into your life to speak into your situation oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house somebody going to go free inside of here oh glory to God the authority coming back in the church to cast those Devils out glory to God to

some Praises glory glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he want to heal you he want to deliver you he want to fill you he want to baptize you he want to revive you he want to restore you he want to forgive you [Applause] a compromising father will not rebuke his son a compromising mother will not rebuke her daughter because she's a silly compromiser but the Bible said knowing that this is loud need an age knowing that this age needs a sharp rebuke from God sometime you have to give the children a sharp rebuke is a rebuke you know yeah am when our clergy get so soft and dirty like some age grandfather to be his grandchildren ever what they do is perfect I know about that I agean thing you but you love your grandchildren and just get away with the grand grandparents where they can't get rid of mother and father that's right so the grandchildren love to go by Grandpa love to go by grandma because they could get away but God is not a grandparent he not any grandparenting that human he's only father he only have sons and daughters he does any grandparents s all right so watch this now it's been said so much that God is a good god until they try to make God a big Doty grandfather or like a Sant close then you see but he's not he's a father a father of righteousness or correction and love is always corrective not sometimes always love corrects no matter how bad it hurts it's still corrects a real mother will correct her children a real dad will correct see it gets so soft and Doty he said I he said course he lug the other day a beach lug and I jump on it and a great chunk fell off it was real rot and Duty I said that's the way Christians are becoming dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become Duty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means and I begin to think of this text overcome keeps life in you overcome do what shout out keep life overcoming keeps life in you if you have a bad attitude you have a temper you have a and your you you say Lord help me to overcome it overcome it it gives a charge inside of you it keeps life inside of you and then you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ The Joy of serving Christ there something called The Joy of serving Christ nobody are forcing you to cover your knees you have Muslims you see them the toes covered and all and the face knows only the eyes have it you only seen the eyes and they had a black veil and the Sun hot you know the son is right now they might say no God son is hot I can't no no no they wearing that am so we had a beg no Christian to pull and dress and dress properly and like that's that's ABC stuff you're getting a real fight if we are trying to follow watch then you are Christian supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and experience the joy of serving Christ Living in church where such is going on he's rotting twice as quick living right under it so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or Le this part of the message we should live constantly in the gra of Christ to stay in the Life of Christ that you'll be fruit bearing yes now he says now this is the greatest sinful age the greatest it's more sin in this age than ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight than it was in any age therefore there are certain sins you have to be prayed for prayed with to get rid of you can't even Pray by yourself you have to get somebody anointed to pray with you for you to get that breakthrough I I'll say it again there are certain things you have to be prayed for and prayed with to get it off of you because sin does attach itself to you you know haunting you terrorizing you it has to be broken off of you that's what they come to church for to get things busted off of you that you can say I am free how many want to be free you have to be free God desire is for you to be free you know is when you have Kings and back doors that you allow the enemy to come in that is how you have a a hole in your life because of things that you do and say and act and it open up a door for the enemy to come in and then the San have a right to do that a right to be there but the spirit come to cancel all these things amen all the demons and assignment had to be cancelled Oh Glory the devil come to steal Rob and Destroy he has an objective and you have to fight that back glory to God is Jesus say I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly so Jesus come to give you life Abundant Life Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God let me let's go this is the age okay all right so it's more sin than in any age I ever been and the PA are Satan many times what all right back there in early ages Christian could uh belong to Christ could be beheaded for it so if you to be a saint in them times you're losing your head say you're dying for the law you're a Christian and the six time to head said n nothing that I for that you know you know you know that Saint in those times the saint in time get lose the head so the chch was pure it had serious people in those times all right so it's deceiving now so what it's so close the people so live people can live clean holy life not be sinful adulterers Drinkers and they can live above that and still not be right with it this is the age of Life personal life of Christ where the chemical of his body what was in him and watch you see here we go let's go justification never put him in you're saved all right right you receive Christ justification have put him in sanctification just clean the place for him but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost come it put him in the people let me say this word the Mysteries that put him in is the Holy Ghost have to come in so they should put you on your alert you want the Holy Ghost you know you don't have it you want it you start with that and then God could bless that want into a desire and then Jesus word come into effect blessed are they that hunger and thirst after right this day shall be filled so first you don't know you get a word now holy ghost puts him in then you want it you say I want that I want that Hallelujah and after that now you start to hunger for it oh God I hungry for righteousness you're hungering for for for Filth and unbelief no you're hunger for righteousness and they blessing upon you you're walking with that blessing you ain't get it yet but you are blessed you are blessed to be hungering you are blessed to be tasting glory to God hallelujah praise God we went by home and we and I yesterday at home talk dealing with a family and S like that and to hear the daughters expressing their desire for God it was kind of mindblowing this one A Min skirt this one a pass this one aing and everything else but there's a thirst in their spirit for God and it's almost as if we were sent there at the right time and I and you know you could see a heart that that that want God want a reality I find that was so rare because one of them it was a funeral and we had and she asked to for me to pray for her in the presence of everybody she she didn't care she I need I need and I pray for her in front of everybody you don't see those things you don't see those things everybody just in the photo copy machine pop po press pray copy and everybody just the same thing with they split pants and they split this and they split this and everything else and the tattoo and everything else just copies I told them you could be original original is different you don't have to be like anybody else you could be original authentic and be you you don't have to be anybody else and God going bless you I know it for a fact God could take you from nothing and bless you and let your cup run over and make a way for you oh glory to God hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus justification of put in sanctification never just cleanse the place for him but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit come it it put him in the people now they turn him out when they begin to show himself he's the same yesterday today and forever they don't want the spirit of the Lord because they disagree it does not agree with their their thoughts and ideas so in in in in the on Noah day eight people overcome Noah Three Sons their wives Noah and his wife in every age God had Overcomers and God going to have Overcomers in this age and in this time praise and the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing praise God and surrender it to him oh praise the name of the Lord you said watch he says um the thing you have to overcome to yourself he said in Daniel's days there was four Overcomers that could stand the test of fire and lion and we are expected to be tested and that's the reason the right back there he that come to God must first be tested tested with what the word how think about that not with drugs not in marijuana what the word so when the word come and present itself to you God test you if you receive that am if you believe that you have to accept the word and then you're going to be tested oh glory to God so when you receive the word God will test you on the word Oh Glory to God clean up your life that's the word God will test you on that Hallelujah you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you and when the test is given is to see whether you overcome or not to him that overcome it the test is the greatest thing that can ever happen I don't think that strike people yet the test is is the greatest thing that ever happened to you when I first heard that news about brother Peter Chandler it was hard but then I didn't feel to come I didn't feel to preach it was like a suck it was just like a suck the out of you but then I I have a service I have a responsibility I still had to come and Minister the word I remember the time but had you pass away and I couldn't tell the church because I want to break down before preaching and I wait till at the ending to to to say what happened but I had a message to deliver and it seem like tonight I have to be able to stand here and Minister the word what happened around your life I can't I can't I can't let that affect what has to happen here this here is the house of God this here represent the Throne of God this here have to be the word of God and you come in because you have a need inside of there that God want to address God want to minister to you glory to God when the pillar of fire came down and it came down the pillar of fire didn't come down and pull the people out of Egypt the pillar of Fire come down to get a man to go to Egypt because God have to work with the laws that he put on the earth he has to find a man to get the people out you have a find a man to bring the word praise God so God find a man Nam Moses and send Moses to bring the people out God find a man this this evening to minister to you because you have to come out God have to use somebody or give the Lord a shout in the house if we going to have a breakthrough service God have to use somebody to act that PR true oh give the Lord a shout in the house you may be seated when they came up to the Red Sea mountains and boat s sites there was nowhere to turn to Moses begin to cry unto God God said why cry unto me speak and move forward he made a way where there was no way nobody could understand a way in the middle of the sea but God Made A Way in the middle of the sea and in the middle of your trial in the middle of your testing in the middle of your tribulation in the middle of your pain in the middle of your stress oh give the Lord a shout this same God Can Make A Way because he's the same yesterday today and forever Glory don't think only you are stressed like how that Terry don't think for one minute you alone are stress some people think that they know oh God nobody knows the trouble I see nobody knows everybody can sing that song everybody can sing that same song the trouble I've seen nobody know but Jesus and people under stress and pressure people just some people don't know what to do some things above your pay grade some above your your mindset and only God could intervene and I am learning more and more is when things are crazy around you you could trust God when you don't know the next step you could trust God when you don't know how this going to work out you could trust God you don't trust God when things are fine you trust God when things are crazy oh give the Lord a shout in the house that is when you trust God oh glory to God when you need a car not want need a car and you have no car when you need a car and you have no money that's how you trust God because you have to make way for the money to get the car go give the Lord a shout in the house and he is a way maker he can make a way for your finances he can make a way on your job he can make a way for you oh give the Lord a praise if the bank don't want to give you credit he can make a way for this to change your mind or change the bank or get the Lord has shout in the house that's the God we talking about you have changing Banks to you [Applause] [Music] know I was reading a book negotiating for for Bank and whatnot and I I went and call this bank called that bank and when I go to my bank the bank tell me I think 11% I said but that bank gave me 9% they all we can see what we could do then they reduce the R I said I learn something I learned something don't take what they're saying challenge them and that's what I did I challenged them I said that bank taking in other words I can move you know there move you can't overcome let's do the test given and when the test is given is to see if you can overcome or not and the test is the greatest thing that can happen to us I believe it's written in the scripture Our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it is testing time it is one good evidence to us that God is with us when we are tested for all the children of God are tested and tried all are tested and tried let me read the top part of this scripture we read unto the sh of L he said write these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy Works talking to you I know about you you are neither cold nor hot I would that th would cold it hot but because th are lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spe into my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich I'm creasing Goods have need of nothing and knowest thou not that thou wretched miserable poor blind and naked I con to buy of me go tring far that all must be rich white green men that all must be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear that anoint thine eye with eyes have that th may see he called them to repent repent is to turn around repentance is looking inwards repentance is not looking outward what others doing and based upon what others doing you repent repentance is about you you in a mirror you and you alone not you and the pastor say it so and then no no no not you and nothing else not you and the Elder not you and no excuse you and you alone Hallelujah the tendency we have is to look outwardly what others have done and doing but if you are lukewarm you see it am you are back you know it you're not where you're supposed to be you know that that you have to address that you nobody could to address that for you the pastor can repent for you it's all about you oh glory to God I wear a long dress but that is nothing if there's something other than that there are some people blaming things but the thing is on the inside of them oh glory to God you know about neon hymon not NE hmon

amen it is not new pages you turn it is not a new life you start is a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to [Music] Perfection I want you to all to play in the cross in the cross Jesus was totally completely man he could cry like a man eat like a man he could become man he was totally physical human being he had desires and Temptations He was a man not an angel above temptation but God God took a complete man to bring a total deliverance and he filled him with his Spirit the Holy Ghost without measure he was our example we are men and women we are also Christians he is our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of God that we might subject to the kingdom of God s since God can't force himself on us that's why he said If any man hear my voice and open the door you have to make the choice to open the door of your heart you have to make a choice to want him to have the pinenes to want to be a servant of Christ I think Dwight Moody was challenged by a evangelist one day and say God is yet to find a man who is so surrendered to him the world is yet to see what God will do with a man that is fully surrendered to God and Dwight Moody said I want to be that kind of man you must want this thing as a reality you must want to be used of God you must want to be a tool of God [Music] jesusall tell my [Music] right so shall find rest
