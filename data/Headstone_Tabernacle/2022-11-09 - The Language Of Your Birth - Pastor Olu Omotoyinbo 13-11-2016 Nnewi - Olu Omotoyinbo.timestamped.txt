[21:30] morning
[21:31] if you have a Bible it's like you pay
[21:33] attention quickly to a few portions of
[21:34] scripture
[21:49] I'd like invite attention to Acts 2
[21:51] Romans 7 and Romans 8.
[21:56] the book of Acts chapter 2.
[21:58] uh speaking about the day of Pentecost
[22:09] Acts 2 and um
[22:12] everything was one
[22:15] and if you have a marker Roman 7 I'll
[22:18] read from verse
[22:19] 7.
[22:23] and then Romans 8
[22:25] verses 105 asked you
[22:28] um everything was one
[22:35] the former Chinese
[22:37] of all that Jesus began both to do and
[22:40] to teach
[22:41] until the day in which he was taken up
[22:43] after that he through the Holy Ghost had
[22:46] given Commandments unto the apostles
[22:48] whom he had chosen
[22:50] to whom also he showed himself alive
[22:52] after his passion but many infallible
[22:54] proofs being sin of them 40 days and
[22:57] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[23:00] kingdom of God
[23:01] and being assembled together with them
[23:03] commanded them that they should not
[23:04] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[23:07] promise of the Father which saith he ye
[23:09] have heard of me
[23:10] for John truly baptized with water for
[23:13] he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[23:14] not many days hands
[23:17] when did therefore will come together
[23:18] they asked of him saying Lord will at
[23:22] this time restore against the kingdom to
[23:24] Israel
[23:25] and he said unto them it is not for you
[23:27] to know the times or the seasons which
[23:30] the father had put in his own power
[23:33] but you shall received power after that
[23:35] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he
[23:38] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[23:39] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[23:42] Samaria and on to the uttermost part of
[23:45] the Earth
[23:47] and when he had spoken these things
[23:48] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[23:52] cloud received them out of their sight
[23:54] and while
[23:57] um they looked steepestly
[23:59] I'm sorry I'm already asked you
[24:02] I was wondering the only sounding
[24:04] familiar
[24:05] I'm so sorry
[24:07] I'm so sorry
[24:09] maybe I should speak on that
[24:13] anyway I'm so sorry I asked you dear
[24:15] Pinnacles
[24:17] um verse one so we have to go through
[24:19] this all over again okay I'm sorry I'm
[24:21] getting old
[24:23] I'm so sorry actor Arie from verse 1.
[24:27] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[24:29] come they were all with one Accord in
[24:32] one place
[24:34] and suddenly there came a sound from
[24:36] Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind
[24:39] and it filled all the house where they
[24:41] were sitting
[24:42] and they apparent to them clothing
[24:43] tongues like as of fire and he set upon
[24:46] each of them
[24:47] and they were all through the Holy Ghost
[24:49] and began to speak with all the tongues
[24:51] as the spirit gave them utterance
[24:54] and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[24:56] devout men out of every nation under
[24:59] heaven
[25:00] now when this was noised abroad the
[25:03] multitude came together and were
[25:06] confounded because that every man had
[25:10] every man had them speak in his own
[25:13] language
[25:14] and they were all amazing Marvel
[25:17] same one to another behold and not all
[25:21] these which speak galileans
[25:25] and how here we every man in our own
[25:28] tongue wherein we were born
[25:31] parthians amides and elamis and the
[25:34] Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and
[25:37] Cappadocia in punters and Asia
[25:40] freygar and panfilia in Egypt and in the
[25:44] past of Libya about sarin and strangers
[25:47] of Rome Jews and proselytes critics and
[25:51] Arabians we do hear them speak in our
[25:54] tongue the wonderful works of God
[25:57] and they were all amazed and whined out
[25:59] no they're confused
[26:02] you were perplexed
[26:05] saying one to another what minute this
[26:10] amen
[26:11] what minute this Acts 2 38
[26:16] then Peter said unto them
[26:18] repent and be baptized every one of you
[26:21] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[26:24] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[26:26] remission of saints and you shall
[26:28] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[26:30] amen Romans 7.
[26:39] let me get this from verse 15. you can
[26:41] you can when you get home you can read
[26:43] from verse seven all the way down well
[26:45] let's pick it up from verse 15. for that
[26:48] which I do I allow not
[26:50] but what a word that do I not but what I
[26:54] hate that do I
[26:56] incredible
[26:57] what I don't want to do that's what I do
[26:59] what I want to do I can do it incredible
[27:03] even I do that which I would not I
[27:07] consent unto the law that it is good
[27:10] now then it is no more either do it but
[27:13] sin that dwelleth in me
[27:16] for I know that in me that is in my
[27:18] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[27:22] his present with me but how to perform
[27:24] that which is good I find not
[27:28] for the good that I would I do not but
[27:31] the evil which I would not that I do
[27:35] how many can relate
[27:39] now if I do that I would not it is no
[27:44] more either do it but sin that dwelleth
[27:47] in me
[27:49] I find them alone that when I would do
[27:52] good evil is present with me
[27:55] for I Delight in the law of God after
[27:57] the inward man but I see another law in
[28:00] my members warned against the law of my
[28:03] mind
[28:04] I'm bringing bringing me into captivity
[28:07] to the law of sin which is in my members
[28:11] all wretched men that I am
[28:14] who shall deliver me from the from the
[28:17] body of this death
[28:20] I thank God
[28:22] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[28:24] so then with the mind I myself serve the
[28:29] law of God but with the flesh the law of
[28:33] sin
[28:34] chapter 8.
[28:36] there is therefore now no condemnation
[28:39] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[28:42] walk not out to the flesh but after the
[28:44] spirit
[28:46] for the law of a spirit of life in
[28:49] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[28:52] law of sin and death
[28:54] for what the law could not do in that it
[28:56] was weak through the flesh
[28:58] God's saying his own son in the likeness
[29:01] of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin
[29:04] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[29:07] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[29:09] walk after the flesh but after the
[29:11] spirit for this that are in the flesh do
[29:14] mind the things of the flesh but if that
[29:16] after the spirit the things of the
[29:18] spirit
[29:19] amen may the Lord are these bless the
[29:21] written of his holy words God bless you
[29:23] you may be seated
[29:32] God bless you again and good morning one
[29:34] more time
[29:36] and so for my thank you again for that
[29:37] tremendous tremendous
[29:39] um song God Is Bigger Than all my
[29:41] problems amen I feel the same ways that
[29:44] are from and I'm sure we all feel the
[29:46] same with his mind
[29:47] God bless you well this morning
[29:49] um
[29:50] um
[29:51] so this mine are trust I won't roll you
[29:53] too long
[29:54] um I want to speak on the subject of the
[29:58] language of your birth
[30:00] I mean the language of your birth
[30:03] and I got a few kind of scriptures here
[30:06] um Galatians 5
[30:08] um 16-21 and Galatians 5 16 to 21 and
[30:12] 17-22 and then also my inspiration is
[30:17] the repellent of predestination
[30:21] you know what a repellent is about mamco
[30:23] repellent but we call it repellent you
[30:25] know when you have um um
[30:27] books that book your plant like ants and
[30:31] wheat hands that you know eat your
[30:34] plants you spray those plants with what
[30:36] you call a repellent
[30:38] when mosquitoes trouble in your home you
[30:40] spray a repellent insect mosquito insect
[30:44] repellent or muscular repellent when
[30:46] cockroaches are a problem in your house
[30:48] you spray the room or the house with a
[30:51] repellent and when those cockeries or
[30:54] insects or termites whatever come there
[30:56] they move back so brother Branham said
[30:58] the same way
[31:00] predestination is a repellent
[31:03] and God spreads you with the repellent
[31:06] of predestination and that's my
[31:09] inspiration this morning amen are you
[31:11] happy
[31:13] amen amen Amen brother bam said
[31:17] predestination that's the mystery and
[31:19] truly if you and I really
[31:21] can get away from our human thinking our
[31:26] human thing which is our problem mainly
[31:29] get away from our human thinking but you
[31:31] know what many times we are trying to
[31:33] get away from our human thinking and try
[31:35] to we are not called to do that
[31:37] we're not called to do that we're not
[31:39] called to do anything in the flesh
[31:40] nothing not a single thing in the flesh
[31:43] because when you try to do that in the
[31:45] flesh you are walking with willpower
[31:47] I'll try to do it I will do it I will
[31:49] struggle it doesn't work it will never
[31:51] work
[31:52] Paul said the law of sin is in the flesh
[31:56] we're not called to even do a single
[31:59] thing with the flesh Allah we were
[32:00] speaking last night gods are foreign
[32:03] knowledge saw you struggling in the
[32:05] flesh struggling in the flesh he didn't
[32:08] look on that if he was going to look
[32:09] upon how many times you'll fail how many
[32:11] times you fell and got up you will not
[32:12] even call you
[32:14] but God looked upon the heart because
[32:16] God doesn't judge the way man judges God
[32:19] saw in your heart the desire the desire
[32:22] for him and God just who will want it
[32:25] who will know money who has a desire on
[32:27] the inside of them for God who wants God
[32:30] who want in spite of their challenges in
[32:33] spite of falling and Rising who wants it
[32:36] on the inside of them that's what God's
[32:38] looking for
[32:39] and When God says that that's what he
[32:42] grabs the whole of so God doesn't deal
[32:44] with this flesh here he deals with the
[32:46] heart
[32:46] amen so we don't will on the outside
[32:48] here we will in the heart
[32:51] amen amen amen amen May 7 19 46.
[32:57] an angel came to William Branham
[32:59] amen
[33:10] you can shut it off
[33:13] an angel came to William Branham and you
[33:16] know the story even though
[33:18] um some try to dispute it these days
[33:20] that never happened and all that stuff
[33:21] that's fine there
[33:24] their problem
[33:26] at Green's Mill and um and he had been
[33:30] having some expansion in his life and
[33:32] some were telling me it's an evil spirit
[33:34] I'm somewhat you know he felt this was
[33:36] God because it didn't he didn't see it
[33:39] out of the scriptures I mean they don't
[33:41] see it was different from what the Bible
[33:43] said could take place
[33:46] so he hadn't experienced that again he
[33:48] said no I am not going to come back
[33:50] until God speaks to me about this so you
[33:52] went away and had a little place where
[33:54] he meets God and went to Green's Mill a
[33:57] little place where he locked himself up
[33:58] God if I don't hear from you I'm not
[34:00] going anywhere and he prayed and prayed
[34:02] and prayed and prayed and prayed how it
[34:04] will be good to have Christians like
[34:05] that again
[34:06] amen and brother Brown wasn't an Auburn
[34:08] at the time
[34:09] he wasn't an old man at all so anyway so
[34:11] he he was just in Aesthetics
[34:14] and so he prayed and right about 11 pm
[34:17] at night he said a lot came in the room
[34:19] and from the light a man appeared and he
[34:23] once he had his voice the man said that
[34:25] fear not he said once heard that voice
[34:27] he knew right away this is the same
[34:29] voice that I spoke to him all the time
[34:30] the symbols of the angel of God that had
[34:32] been with him all the time amen an angel
[34:35] is he's standing right by your side
[34:37] that's our heritage as sons of God
[34:39] I know some in the past have over beaten
[34:43] these angels and but it's true it's but
[34:44] the problem said you can't believe God's
[34:46] word and not believe in angels not
[34:48] believe in angels to save you Angels
[34:50] don't save us angels are servants that
[34:52] are sent to minister unto us The Heirs
[34:55] of Salvation angels protect us Angels
[34:58] watch over us and just take a report
[35:00] back to God about our Behavior amen
[35:03] Angels keep us on our toes the very fact
[35:05] that we know Angels around makes us
[35:06] conscious that Heavenly a Heavenly Host
[35:09] is watching us amen so an angel the
[35:13] angel came and once he spoke but mama
[35:14] said he knew right away this was the
[35:17] same angel that had always spoken to him
[35:19] and said I've been sent from the prince
[35:22] of God to tell you that
[35:24] give you have been given a message that
[35:27] will forerun the second coming of Jesus
[35:29] Christ and began to speak your brother
[35:31] Branham and tell him different things
[35:32] and bobans asked him like that oh yeah
[35:34] and and you'll be sent with a sign and
[35:37] all that and things like that bam said
[35:39] the people won't believe me he said no
[35:42] I'll give you a son like Moses I give
[35:43] you two signs one in the hand and all
[35:45] that and my mom said but the ministers
[35:48] will not believe me then it's not for
[35:50] the ministers it's for the people
[35:51] because the missiles usually and you and
[35:53] I experience that are not seeing
[35:54] anything against Ministries because I'm
[35:55] one myself but the truth is that we
[35:57] ministers cause most of the trouble the
[36:00] people don't have a problem mostly it's
[36:02] the ministers that cause a problem with
[36:03] the things we teach with our Behavior
[36:05] with the things we tell the churches
[36:07] with ministers like the Army Pastor
[36:09] myself so I'm talking to myself here
[36:11] amen many times we are saying things
[36:13] there a person has a fight with this
[36:15] church here and his truck people must
[36:16] get in that fight they must buy their
[36:18] pastors fight
[36:21] the angel told him it's not for the
[36:23] ministers it's for the people
[36:25] they're not sent to the minister you are
[36:27] sent to the people
[36:29] Jesus himself didn't come to the
[36:30] ministers he came to the lost sheep of
[36:33] the House of Israel it's not a minister
[36:35] thing
[36:36] [Applause]
[36:46] and brother one other thing brother said
[36:48] everything that angel told him he
[36:51] checked up with the scriptures he didn't
[36:53] say because of the Angel and with the
[36:54] prince of God it shed it up from the
[36:57] scriptures every single thing that angel
[37:01] told him he checked up from the
[37:02] scriptures and the Bible said beloved
[37:05] believe not every Spirit but try the
[37:08] spirits see if there of God
[37:11] if you are from Lagos check me out
[37:13] whatever you go to check the watch from
[37:15] the puppet check it out
[37:17] amen that's your heritage that's your
[37:20] that's your responsibility as a
[37:22] Christian as a Believer you may be
[37:24] seated
[37:25] [Applause]
[37:30] so brother Benham said brother said
[37:33] you check everything out that then you
[37:34] told him
[37:36] and then the angel told him these very
[37:38] very memorable words
[37:39] that you know what
[37:41] on Earth many speak just everyone
[37:43] chatter as a police
[37:45] but they don't seem to realize that in
[37:47] heaven the thoughts of man's heart
[37:50] speak their thoughts speak louder
[37:54] in heaven than they are what do on Earth
[37:56] and that's where I want to start from
[37:58] this morning your thoughts actually
[37:59] speak
[38:00] amen we know a word is a thought
[38:03] expressed but because those who watch
[38:05] those thoughts become what they actually
[38:07] speak those words speak in heaven they
[38:10] speak on Earth
[38:14] your thoughts speak your words speak
[38:17] your life speaks
[38:19] I'm sure you heard the phrase action
[38:22] speak louder than words
[38:24] your thoughts speak your thoughts
[38:27] actually Awards your first actually are
[38:29] things as a matter of fact nothing
[38:31] happens but what you think about it
[38:33] first
[38:34] and your thoughts they are words your
[38:36] thoughts are things
[38:39] and nothing is going to Define you more
[38:41] than the quality of thinking in your
[38:43] heart
[38:47] it's not so much what you do on the
[38:49] outside as a matter of fact there's
[38:50] nothing you and I can do but what we
[38:52] think about it first so your words are
[38:54] thought your thoughts are words and your
[38:56] thoughts speak
[38:57] your words speak your life speaks amen
[39:02] can you say Amen
[39:04] amen
[39:06] hallelujah amen
[39:10] so anyway when the angel told him that
[39:12] Amen brother was a revelation to him
[39:14] that your life speaks
[39:16] because your life is made up of your
[39:19] thoughts your words and your actions in
[39:23] other words your life speaks

[39:28] your life is something that somebody can
[39:30] read they can hear they can see your
[39:33] life speaks can you say Amen
[39:37] so each one of us here we are speaking
[39:39] even though we are not speaking even
[39:41] though you are not saying what you are
[39:42] speaking that's the authority and the
[39:45] Heritage God gave you as a human being

[39:50] saying one word
[39:52] you can influence a whole generation

[40:00] your behavior your actions can speak
[40:03] more than you it was what even will
[40:07] your thoughts speak in heaven larger
[40:10] than the Zion out here I didn't say one
[40:12] word I didn't see anything no your
[40:14] thoughts speak

[47:33] White Man Poor Man rich man wealthy man
[47:36] amen King George whoever we are all born
[47:39] the same way our breath comes the same
[47:41] way and so the language of our birth is
[47:43] universal the same way
[47:45] amen
[47:47] I know the story
[47:49] when God made man
[47:51] there's no need for human bath
[47:53] no Adam spoke a language
[47:57] the language of his birth the land where
[47:59] he came from
[48:01] the prince of God
[48:03] the book of redemption
[48:05] the Lamb's Book of Redemption where
[48:07] God's life was in that book and Adam
[48:09] spoke and spoke from that book he lived
[48:13] from that book that was the language
[48:14] that his life spoken
[48:16] amen but then something happened in
[48:18] human birth even the back by sex was
[48:21] introduced and the whole program changed
[48:23] but let me leave that alone for a while
[48:25] amen
[48:26] all right
[48:32] [Applause]
[48:35] amen
[48:37] so the language of your birth the
[48:39] language of your life the same language
[48:41] in every way on the face of the earth is
[48:43] a universal language because we're all
[48:45] upon the same way
[48:47] and we all speak the same language the
[48:49] language of our birth
[48:51] so what's this language about what is it
[48:55] amen what is it
[48:57] is the language
[48:58] is the language of human nature
[49:01] it's the language that human nature
[49:02] speaks
[49:03] and that's why it's Universal because
[49:05] all of us being human beings we have the
[49:07] same nature same human nature we all
[49:10] have this in nature
[49:11] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell and
[49:15] those Believers that had worked with
[49:17] Jesus Christ and others that had
[49:19] believed their testimony about 120 of
[49:21] them in the upper room the Holy Ghost
[49:22] Came Upon them and they were sealed
[49:24] baptized the Holy Ghost and adopted at
[49:27] the same time those things happen at the
[49:29] same time because God was trying to set
[49:31] a foundation the foundational Christian
[49:33] Church God Jesus I prophesied upon this
[49:35] walk I will build my church and the
[49:37] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[49:39] it and this was that prophecy coming
[49:41] into fulfillment the church was being
[49:43] born on the day of Pentecost and so the
[49:45] Holy Ghost came to birth to give back to
[49:48] that church and they were born again
[49:50] each one of them and they were also
[49:52] adopted at the same time and that's
[49:54] where Pentecost misses it Pentecost
[49:56] cannot separate that on the view of
[49:57] Pentacles they didn't just received the
[49:59] basement of the Holy Ghost no they
[50:00] received the Batman of the Holy Ghost
[50:01] and immediately they were also adopted
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:08] and that's what Pentecost misses
[50:10] beyond your bottom of the Holy Ghost

[51:17] what he's saying I understand what he's
[51:18] saying
[51:26] and they set those memorable words
[51:30] how he outcome these men are Jews
[51:34] how come
[51:36] they are speaking a language you
[51:38] understand
[51:39] they're speaking a language of the land
[51:41] of our birth
[51:50] the language they were speaking was the
[51:52] language of human nature
[51:54] and you speak the language all the time
[51:58] you and I speak the language all the
[52:00] time because your life speaks
[52:03] your life speaks amen Oh Glory to God
[52:07] Amen so on the dear panickers

[52:51] Julians yet they all had the same
[52:54] language the language of their birth
[52:57] amen unlike them
[53:00] we have a natural place
[53:02] of our birth
[53:04] and our natural breath speaks
[53:07] you know many times you say oh that's
[53:08] how you realize that that's how they
[53:09] talk you ever heard that oh that's our
[53:12] evil said that's just how they do

[54:01] what's human nature
[54:04] that nature is in the soul
[54:07] your life is speaking from the soul
[54:12] life is really in the soul that's where
[54:14] you have birthed from that's where you
[54:16] are born from

[54:23] the Garden of Eden and then Eve later
[54:26] go put his cities genius life his nature
[54:30] in the soul of Adam
[54:34] and that Soul lived out the Bible said
[54:35] Man became
[54:37] a living soul
[54:39] so the life that man was leaving was his
[54:41] soul actually walking around
[54:44] his son actually was leaving and walking
[54:46] around
[54:47] that was the language Adam's life was
[54:49] speaking and what was that life here the
[54:51] life of a Son of God was going through
[54:54] the Garden of Eden Man became a living
[54:56] Soul he wasn't Man became an alive Soul
[54:58] because he can be alive and dead
[55:03] but Adam was leaving
[55:06] the two different things living is a
[55:08] present active active action living
[55:11] present tense
[55:14] his soul was living in other words
[55:17] nature the nature of God in Adam's Soul
[55:20] was living out as Adam walked through
[55:23] the garden and that was the language
[55:25] Adam's life spoke the language is not so

[57:57] path speaking
[58:03] you are either born from above or born
[58:06] from here
[58:07] those are the children that's why it was
[58:09] a universal language whether you are
[58:10] born in Europe or in America or China it
[58:12] doesn't matter it's out from above or
[58:14] from here
[58:15] and if you are from here you speak to an
[58:17] invested language the language of human
[58:19] nature if you are from above it speaks
[58:21] one in Versa language the language of
[58:22] God's nature
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:27] whether you are evil hausa your Aruba
[58:29] whatever it is China man it doesn't
[58:32] matter you are either born from above or
[58:35] born from below when you are born from
[58:37] above you are speaking from the land of
[58:39] your path the land of human nature
[58:41] and the language of life is going to be
[58:43] the language of human nature
[58:48] was the language
[58:49] the law of sin and death in your members
[58:56] the law of sin and death in the flesh
[59:00] what I would I would not
[59:03] that which I don't want to do that I
[59:06] find myself doing
[59:07] you can help it is the land is the
[59:09] language of the land of your birth you
[59:11] cannot help no matter how hard you try
[59:13] you cannot help it if you could help you
[59:15] would not need a savior come on somebody
[59:18] say Amen
[59:19] if you could help it we would not need a
[59:21] savior
[59:21] [Applause]
[59:23] if you could help it if your will power
[59:26] could do it we will not need Jesus
[59:27] Christ he would have died in vain then
[59:30] so ask yourself this morning what what
[59:33] language is my life speaking is my life
[59:36] speaking the language of the land from
[59:38] heaven or is my last language from here
[59:40] or is my life speaking a mixture of both
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:52] [Music]
[1:00:10] so
[1:00:12] in your soul because this language is
[1:00:15] language of human nature and human
[1:00:16] nature is the same thing
[1:00:19] when you're created man or when you
[1:00:21] formed man
[1:00:22] when he created a man on the sick day
[1:00:24] the god of Eden you know the story
[1:00:26] Manning just he didn't just tap from
[1:00:28] that 60 when God created man has is
[1:00:30] beginning from way back yeah his Origins
[1:00:32] from way back and that's very scientists
[1:00:35] who want to talk about the origins of
[1:00:36] life
[1:00:42] and start it and say my side from a
[1:00:43] tadpole
[1:00:44] because they know even they know that
[1:00:46] money just start you know like that
[1:00:48] there's something that precedes men they
[1:00:50] know that themselves so they want to
[1:00:52] prove and say like that okay monster
[1:00:53] from a tadpole and from a tadpoles were
[1:00:55] higher being to a higher one then to an
[1:00:57] ape to a chimpanzee and then man was
[1:00:59] formed
[1:01:02] they are right in the sense that they
[1:01:04] know man come from a from some other
[1:01:07] being but they think man came from a
[1:01:08] lower being but man actually come from a
[1:01:10] higher bin
[1:01:16] and all man was supposed to do was to
[1:01:18] leave
[1:01:19] was to leave
[1:01:23] a life from the land of his birth
[1:01:26] which is from heaven
[1:01:29] which are from the man of God we from
[1:01:31] the mind of Christ from the back part of
[1:01:34] the beginning
[1:01:35] what life is that the life of God
[1:01:37] himself
[1:01:39] the life of a seven spirits of God with
[1:01:42] the Bible calls the mindful fruit
[1:01:45] mindful fruit and Adam was in the garden
[1:01:48] and Adam lived a life from this land of
[1:01:51] his birth and Adam's life spoke he spoke
[1:01:54] the language of his path
[1:01:56] many times 95 of of communication of
[1:02:01] speaking is non-verbal
[1:02:03] so when we're talking about your
[1:02:04] language it is not what what what what
[1:02:06] was 95 of speaking science will tell you
[1:02:09] is non-verbal
[1:02:11] your attitude is a speaking you just
[1:02:14] come in you just have an attitude you
[1:02:16] are speaking
[1:02:17] daddy and mommy talk to you you just
[1:02:19] squeeze your face you are speaking
[1:02:23] your son does something you just take a
[1:02:25] look at them and just blink you are
[1:02:27] speaking you haven't said one word
[1:02:29] that's what you call non-verbal
[1:02:32] communication most of our communication
[1:02:34] comes like that
[1:02:36] your son is running all over this place
[1:02:37] here you just look at me and say I'll
[1:02:39] just call him like that hey son
[1:02:41] that's all you say you understand so
[1:02:43] mommy doesn't like this that doesn't
[1:02:44] like this
[1:02:49] so when we talk language it's not just
[1:02:51] words
[1:02:52] is your whole life
[1:02:54] your thoughts your attitudes your
[1:02:57] thinking your words your speech
[1:03:00] that's your life that's the language
[1:03:02] here
[1:03:04] and this is what comes from the heart
[1:03:06] and when Adam was walking through the
[1:03:08] garden Adam was speaking from the line
[1:03:11] of his path Hallelujah there was a Son
[1:03:14] of God birth on the face of the earth a
[1:03:17] Bones on a fear son that have full
[1:03:20] anointment authority to walk on the face
[1:03:22] of the Earth in the in the place of his
[1:03:24] father God
[1:03:25] a tree never died before Adam no nothing
[1:03:29] could die before Adam Adam had all
[1:03:31] authority on the face of the Earth he
[1:03:33] was speaking from the land of his birth
[1:03:34] that was the language of his birth
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:49] a tree brought his view Adam could just
[1:03:52] move that tree out of the way
[1:03:54] a tree Too Tall Adam could just say that
[1:03:56] you to come down
[1:03:58] he was an amateur God on the face of the
[1:04:01] Earth that was the language his last
[1:04:03] spoke the language of a Son of God born
[1:04:06] from the Throne of God born from the
[1:04:08] back part of God's mind
[1:04:09] [Applause]
[1:04:17] but the devil didn't like that and he
[1:04:19] got jealous
[1:04:20] and he went in there you know the story
[1:04:22] and cut them to sin and in that
[1:04:24] introduced another nature
[1:04:27] another nature you may be seated
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:40] brother Brown said God is trying to
[1:04:43] condition his children
[1:04:46] condition them by finding a way into
[1:04:48] their hearts I could read you the quote
[1:04:50] but take it from him but Venom said that
[1:04:52] condition is children to work will get
[1:04:55] into their hearts and when they can get
[1:04:56] into their hearts then he can make them
[1:04:58] do on the face of this Earth here what
[1:05:00] he brought them to the Earth to do
[1:05:04] because there's a nature in there you
[1:05:06] can't do anything but live by what your
[1:05:08] nature dictates
[1:05:10] how many times many of us pride
[1:05:12] ourselves that's me that's just who I am
[1:05:14] that's my nature well where's that
[1:05:15] nature from the land of which bar is he
[1:05:17] talking from
[1:05:21] we get so proud that's my nature that's
[1:05:23] how we are my family we just like to say
[1:05:24] it straight well that's fine but what
[1:05:27] land of your back is that nature
[1:05:29] speaking from from The Book of Life or
[1:05:31] from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:33] it cannot be both ways can somebody say
[1:05:36] hallelujah
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:45] thank you Peter
[1:05:50] you may be seated
[1:05:57] Adam walked through the garden he had
[1:05:59] only one land
[1:06:01] that he come from
[1:06:04] the land from the back part of elohim's
[1:06:06] mind they learned from The Book of Life
[1:06:07] and so he lived a life from the
[1:06:09] lambsical Redemption
[1:06:12] he was the book of redemption manifested
[1:06:15] he was the manifested Lambs of
[1:06:17] redemption walking up and down the earth
[1:06:19] a Son of God on the face of the Earth
[1:06:21] and Adam come on you Brothers come on
[1:06:23] you husbands
[1:06:26] but the problem said Adam
[1:06:28] recognize that Eve was the weaker vessel
[1:06:31] so he dealt with that according to
[1:06:33] knowledge recognition was a weaker
[1:06:35] vessel
[1:06:37] a woman for a thousand times I think the
[1:06:39] Bible says a thousand times before a man
[1:06:41] falls one time
[1:06:43] so how do you square up to your wife
[1:06:45] every time she misbehaves like that
[1:06:47] she's weaker than you a thousand times
[1:06:50] can I get any can I get witness back can
[1:06:52] I get a witness back
[1:06:54] oh don't be quiet on me can I get a
[1:06:55] witness back
[1:06:57] I don't want these young men and women
[1:06:58] who don't know what their husband and
[1:06:59] wife relationship looks like to be
[1:07:01] talking I want those of you who know to
[1:07:03] give me a witness back
[1:07:05] I can hear you
[1:07:07] no you're a little too quiet this is
[1:07:09] Sunday morning I cannot hear you
[1:07:12] amen amen Brothers to you glory
[1:07:18] you maybe see that
[1:07:20] just talking to you
[1:07:22] or you maybe see that
[1:07:26] the language of Adam's birth from the
[1:07:29] land of his birth
[1:07:32] God could look at Adam and say how over
[1:07:35] here are we the Angels who look at Adam
[1:07:37] how are here we this man speaking the
[1:07:39] language of the land we know
[1:07:42] brother Venom said Adam he anointed Eve
[1:07:45] with his word image Spirit Adam was
[1:07:48] loving he was kind he was sweet that's
[1:07:51] how Adam rode his home
[1:07:53] in there you have enough strictness in
[1:07:56] there you have not known nonsense but it
[1:07:58] was covered up with the spirit of
[1:07:59] sweetness loving kindness and tenderness
[1:08:02] that's how Adam Road is home the
[1:08:05] language of his birth
[1:08:07] can you say Amen
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:17] Ambassador doing he anointed Eve with
[1:08:20] his own word image spirit
[1:08:22] that's how it became like Adam little by
[1:08:26] little by little by little because Adam
[1:08:29] was leaving
[1:08:31] the line his life was the language
[1:08:33] of his bath the lion was born from him
[1:08:39] and then
[1:08:41] the devil didn't like that too much
[1:08:42] there was jealousy jealous of you right
[1:08:44] now you think that me I'm so useless
[1:08:46] nothing happened to me but I don't even
[1:08:48] know whether this Christianity is
[1:08:49] working for me or not
[1:08:50] I I get that
[1:08:52] I get it I get it he's not working for
[1:08:54] you I get it I get it
[1:08:57] but let's just talk I just let's just
[1:08:59] come together and let's come let's come
[1:09:01] to God said uh come and let us reason
[1:09:04] together
[1:09:05] the reason is not so useless anyway
[1:09:08] it's useless when it's risen against
[1:09:09] God's word even God is inviting you to
[1:09:12] come and reason with him so let's reason
[1:09:14] together I'm just about ready to give up
[1:09:16] this Christian race it's not working for
[1:09:17] me at all and all that so I can be like
[1:09:18] the boys can't be like the girls I can't
[1:09:20] be like this one here I can do this I
[1:09:21] can't do that here anytime each other
[1:09:22] they always condemning you I can't get
[1:09:23] it on your neck
[1:09:25] I understand I get that
[1:09:27] I get that
[1:09:36] the devil is jealous of you in your
[1:09:39] similarly frustrated condition
[1:09:41] is jealous
[1:09:43] but you are sitting there what mean at
[1:09:46] this what's going on here I don't know
[1:09:48] what all this means I don't understand
[1:09:50] this here
[1:09:52] I don't even understand this message
[1:09:54] like a bondage for me I don't understand
[1:09:56] this here can't be like everybody else
[1:09:58] can be like the children can be like
[1:09:59] other people can be like this yeah not
[1:10:01] be like that I don't understand this
[1:10:02] here
[1:10:03] I get that
[1:10:05] I get it
[1:10:06] you may be seen it
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:17] let us have a conversation
[1:10:19] on the world
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:24] so the devil was jealous of Adam and Eve
[1:10:27] and watch what he said watch what he did
[1:10:29] he got in there and you know the story
[1:10:31] he talked to Eve and all that stuff and
[1:10:32] and he told her you can't be happy this
[1:10:35] way you cannot be happy he said as God
[1:10:36] said sure I'm gonna say I'm a very
[1:10:38] wonderful garden one can you see all so
[1:10:40] beautiful and everything oh yeah it's so
[1:10:42] beautiful I mean we just have everything
[1:10:43] we need here and whatever whatever we
[1:10:45] can just check it out our resources
[1:10:46] never run dry the pile of meal never
[1:10:48] fails and God takes care of us we don't
[1:10:50] have a whole lot but God takes care of
[1:10:51] us we are just coming and fine then we
[1:10:53] say oh yeah
[1:10:54] you think you believe your testimony
[1:10:57] he doesn't
[1:10:58] he does not
[1:11:00] he doesn't believe anything you say
[1:11:03] the devil doesn't believe anything you
[1:11:06] say
[1:11:14] and when the devil doesn't mean your
[1:11:15] testimony many of us will get shaken is
[1:11:17] our testimony really true
[1:11:19] is it really true
[1:11:21] he's got really real
[1:11:23] because the boys in school don't see why
[1:11:25] you should leave the way you live and
[1:11:26] the girls who don't say why should lead
[1:11:28] the way you live you start doubting your
[1:11:29] testimony
[1:11:30] is it the right way to live why can't I
[1:11:32] be like everybody else what can I do
[1:11:34] what they are doing they are Christians
[1:11:36] who anyway and what does it matter
[1:11:38] that brother Commander said yesterday
[1:11:40] all our girls trying to go the way of
[1:11:42] the world in their dressing there's
[1:11:44] towels in there where they look and you
[1:11:45] take a look at them you're not sure
[1:11:46] whether they're Christians or not
[1:11:48] because it's in my soul it wasn't me on
[1:11:50] the outside no a joyful heart makes a
[1:11:52] merry continent most on the inside shows
[1:11:55] on the outside
[1:11:57] as a matter of fact whatever is on the
[1:11:59] outside is because on the inside
[1:12:01] that's right let me leave that alone let
[1:12:04] me see that
[1:12:06] so the devil got
[1:12:13] inspired to talk to Eve that's how the
[1:12:15] devil gets to you too
[1:12:17] he said to talk to Eve chair to have a
[1:12:19] conversation with her try to talk to her
[1:12:23] that she got a language that she'll
[1:12:24] understand he said everything is fine
[1:12:26] and down here oh yeah
[1:12:28] it's God can everything be fine
[1:12:31] you can do everything here sure
[1:12:32] I've never looked around oh yeah and God
[1:12:35] even shall they say they said what what
[1:12:37] what did God say and he said we can take
[1:12:39] everything but that one exactly
[1:12:42] that one he said should not take that's
[1:12:44] where the Secret Lives
[1:12:46] the one he doesn't want you to take
[1:12:48] that's the one he is keeping that from
[1:12:50] you for a reason
[1:12:52] sometimes from a reason
[1:12:54] you know friends
[1:12:56] the devil knows you and I he doesn't
[1:12:58] know us on the inside he sees us on the
[1:13:00] outside
[1:13:01] and she's our complaints he sees
[1:13:04] everything that we say we Grumble like
[1:13:06] this he has all that
[1:13:08] and so the devil specializes as he did
[1:13:11] with Eve that one single Eve had
[1:13:14] everything by her own testimony the only
[1:13:17] thing God kept away from her
[1:13:19] the only thing documentary from her for
[1:13:21] her own protection
[1:13:24] that was the thing the devil singled out
[1:13:27] the one thing God kept away the devil
[1:13:30] told her you can be happy not having
[1:13:32] access to this tree of knowledge of Good
[1:13:34] and Evil
[1:13:36] and with time Eve brought that story
[1:13:39] when you the devil is telling you those
[1:13:41] things here it's not just telling you he
[1:13:43] wants to get into your soul
[1:13:46] he wants to introduce another nature in
[1:13:48] there and once he introduce the other
[1:13:50] nature there he told Eve what's God
[1:13:52] talking about so you should wait wait
[1:13:54] for what I can show you right now
[1:13:56] how to bring life into the world I can
[1:13:59] show you right now how to be like God
[1:14:03] that's what God gave us everything I'll
[1:14:05] show you a faster way to get the
[1:14:07] promises done
[1:14:10] and according to us so condition her
[1:14:13] mind
[1:14:14] condition her twisted and conditioned
[1:14:16] her
[1:14:18] God in high emotions
[1:14:21] and once he did that the devil had her
[1:14:24] and the deal was done
[1:14:26] and came forth and showed a husband and
[1:14:29] Abel came forth and that's why another
[1:14:31] nature was introduced
[1:14:33] the two lands were introduced the land
[1:14:36] of the Lamb's Book of redemption and the
[1:14:38] land of The Book of Life
[1:14:45] and every man from Adam and Eve Cain and
[1:14:49] Abel had a book of life the land of the
[1:14:52] about a book of human nature every
[1:14:54] single thing that you did on the face of
[1:14:56] these are there everything is recorded
[1:14:58] everything is recorded recorded and you
[1:15:02] live right out of that book
[1:15:04] you live right out of that land
[1:15:06] every man every woman boy and girl live
[1:15:09] right out of that land of human nature
[1:15:11] the way we are conditioning our hearts
[1:15:13] that's how we are born we will spawn and
[1:15:16] shaping iniquity we're coming to this
[1:15:18] world speaking lies
[1:15:19] Amen in my flesh that lies no one good
[1:15:22] thing what I would I would not when I
[1:15:24] would do right evil is present that's
[1:15:27] the land of our birth
[1:15:30] that's the Book of Life
[1:15:33] your book of natural life is written in
[1:15:35] there I mean there every act that you
[1:15:38] did is written there
[1:15:43] that's a natural birth
[1:15:45] but thank God
[1:15:47] thank God that's not the end of the
[1:15:49] story
[1:15:50] there's another story there's another
[1:15:51] side to the story there's another ending
[1:15:53] to the story
[1:15:55] there's another birth
[1:15:57] to take us back
[1:16:01] that's right brother
[1:16:03] now well we're truly
[1:16:06] born from
[1:16:09] and God was looking before the function
[1:16:10] of the world this all happened a split
[1:16:12] second time
[1:16:14] God first mention of God look upon the
[1:16:16] Earth this land of natural birth
[1:16:18] and so who is wanting to get out of that
[1:16:21] land who is wanting to stay there
[1:16:24] if God were to look on our actions not a
[1:16:27] single one of us will he pick
[1:16:29] but God looked upon their heart God
[1:16:32] looked upon our hearts look upon the
[1:16:34] design I had what do they want in there
[1:16:37] what do they want in there if God was
[1:16:40] look upon our falling up and rising up
[1:16:42] and falling and falling he was look upon
[1:16:43] our fornication our filthiness our sins
[1:16:45] he will not take a single one of us but
[1:16:48] no he not look upon our upon our bodies
[1:16:50] Upon Our flesh you look upon our hearts
[1:16:53] because God doesn't judge from the
[1:16:55] bodies are from the flesh from the
[1:16:57] outside he judges from the heart so God
[1:16:59] look in our hearts and look for that
[1:17:01] desire
[1:17:07] and that brings us right back to the
[1:17:09] dear Pentecost
[1:17:10] these guys were confused
[1:17:13] they have the apostles the 2120 in the
[1:17:16] upper room speaking the language of
[1:17:17] their birth
[1:17:19] just like you are hearing your own life
[1:17:21] today speaking the language of your
[1:17:23] birth
[1:17:24] amen that anger the bitterness the
[1:17:27] filthiness the fornication the secret
[1:17:30] sucking name it put it there
[1:17:32] even all the classy sins the anger
[1:17:35] the impatience
[1:17:40] the language of our birth
[1:17:43] and God is not telling you stop that
[1:17:46] stop that stop that because for the
[1:17:49] foundation of the world that's not what
[1:17:50] he looked for
[1:17:51] he did not look for who was topping that
[1:17:53] stopping that stopping that no he looked
[1:17:56] for who had the desire
[1:18:02] foreign
[1:18:11] of that natural path into the land of
[1:18:14] the spiritual path
[1:18:16] amen amen Oh by far knowledge he chose
[1:18:21] them by far knowledge he elected them
[1:18:23] and stand their names in The Book of
[1:18:25] Life
[1:18:27] and by foreknowledge he spread them he
[1:18:30] spread them with a precious blood of
[1:18:33] Jesus Christ but with their Sanctified
[1:18:34] and that precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18:36] is their repellent
[1:18:38] against anything the devil will throw at
[1:18:40] them and without repellent on them he
[1:18:43] established them now predestinated them
[1:18:45] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:18:46] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:54] Oh Glory
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:19:03] you maybe see that
[1:19:09] so here we are
[1:19:10] we believe we are God's sons and others
[1:19:13] and if we are not we'll get you in a
[1:19:15] minute here we are
[1:19:18] amen God's grace is upon us
[1:19:22] and we're God's sons and the others and
[1:19:24] we believe our names have been
[1:19:26] transferred from The Book of Life into
[1:19:28] the Promised Book of Life
[1:19:33] and we have been born from the alarm
[1:19:36] but you're not really born from Islam's
[1:19:37] alive until you are baptized to the Holy
[1:19:40] Ghost on Fire
[1:19:41] the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:43] your election in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:19:46] and too many of us are comfortable
[1:19:48] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:49] too many of us so we end up living as
[1:19:52] though today we are in the lamps in The
[1:19:53] Book of Life tomorrow when the Lambs you
[1:19:55] got life then tomorrow when they'll book
[1:19:57] a life when the alarms look alive we're
[1:19:59] just us to and Flow by every single win
[1:20:01] of Doctrine but not anymore
[1:20:03] not anymore
[1:20:05] you are either in the Book of Life or in
[1:20:07] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:15] oh Hallelujah
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] you may be seated let me tell you what's
[1:20:23] been going on
[1:20:35] the language of your life it's a lived
[1:20:37] voice
[1:20:39] it's in your heart it's in your soul
[1:20:40] your heart is your soul is what they
[1:20:42] call the subconscious some call it the
[1:20:44] unconscious it's your soul that is
[1:20:46] subconscious being the inner man the man
[1:20:49] on the inside the man that comes from
[1:20:51] another land
[1:20:54] foreign
[1:21:00] said
[1:21:02] what I would I would not
[1:21:04] who is that man speaking the man here or
[1:21:07] the man on the inside
[1:21:10] it was the man here he wouldn't complain
[1:21:12] but the man on the inside is wondering
[1:21:14] this man on the outside is just doing
[1:21:16] what I don't want to do
[1:21:20] I don't want to live like that how many
[1:21:23] ever feel that way I don't want to live
[1:21:25] like that oh yes we all do the way I
[1:21:28] feel that way many times I don't want to
[1:21:30] live like that
[1:21:32] oh Hallelujah we come from God we say
[1:21:36] that so many times don't we we come from
[1:21:37] God and we're going back to God again so
[1:21:39] the language of our birth should speak
[1:21:42] the language they quit from heaven
[1:21:43] brother Branham said we have to wear two
[1:21:46] for being one on the other to die one
[1:21:48] from Heaven to live we live our lives on
[1:21:51] Earth here like they do up in heaven but
[1:21:54] how many of us actually live like that
[1:21:57] we're waiting for the Dynamics to come
[1:21:58] no
[1:22:00] the Dynamics only manifest you to the
[1:22:02] world
[1:22:03] as a son and daughter of God that come
[1:22:06] from the back side of the beginning the
[1:22:08] Dynamics doesn't make you a son the
[1:22:10] dynamic manifest you to the wall as a
[1:22:13] son can you say Amen
[1:22:16] Oh Glory to God Amen
[1:22:20] oh brother
[1:22:23] so here we are
[1:22:25] like all those people on the deal
[1:22:26] Pentacles they were confused and you
[1:22:28] might be confused today

[1:22:34] my life that I want I come for
[1:22:36] convention after convention but the
[1:22:37] community about the Isley Brothers
[1:22:43] Redemption and I believe that but are no
[1:22:46] ones that go out I'm going to go the
[1:22:47] same route again
[1:22:49] that's been your experience that's been
[1:22:52] your testimony
[1:22:54] and I know you can relate
[1:22:56] I know many can relate

[1:28:48] marching victoriously that's how he

[1:36:23] upon that world and informing the womb
[1:36:25] of a virgin amen his son is born not

[1:38:16] wrong thing like he tries many times to

[1:38:28] why he had been spread
[1:38:31] that Jesus with a repellent of
[1:38:34] predestination

[1:42:42] Amen what it means this morning is a
[1:42:47] call going out to exchange
[1:42:50] the life from The Book of Life to
[1:42:53] exchange for the life from the Lamb's
[1:42:56] Book of redemption and it doesn't take a
[1:42:59] whole year to do it it happens right
[1:43:01] here now it's an exchange one is going
[1:43:06] in one is going out it's an exchange how
[1:43:11] many will lock that exchange this
[1:43:12] morning
[1:43:13] how many would love that exchange this
[1:43:14] morning
[1:43:15] oh so your language of your birth can
[1:43:19] really speak from the land of your path
[1:43:21] Oh Glory to God amen Amen brother panel
[1:43:26] said here now listen I want to talk to
[1:43:28] you while they're coming have faith
[1:43:30] if you I've never received Jesus Christ
[1:43:32] here's your chance
[1:43:34] the prescription one minute this
[1:43:36] um Peter went through all that preaching
[1:43:38] to answer that question to bring up in
[1:43:41] their heart a thirst
[1:43:43] for repentance
[1:43:46] that's all we need to do wherever you
[1:43:48] are at today if you haven't received
[1:43:49] Jesus Christ or you have received Jesus
[1:43:51] Christ and you have you are you don't
[1:43:54] have the Holy Ghost repent
[1:43:56] if you have the Holy Ghost and you just
[1:43:58] found out you are not having the victory
[1:43:59] there's something wrong repent
[1:44:02] every one of you
[1:44:07] repent
[1:44:09] that's where the Christian Gospel starts
[1:44:11] from
[1:44:13] that's where the exchange starts from
[1:44:17] exchanging the life of the book of
[1:44:19] redemption
[1:44:21] and getting out of the life in the Lambs
[1:44:23] I mean getting the life from the
[1:44:24] convention and exchange for the Lamb's
[1:44:26] Book on life oh repent
[1:44:29] if you never know Jesus Christ repent
[1:44:34] if you know Jesus Christ
[1:44:36] of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:39] if you have the battle of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:40] and you still find you are shaky
[1:44:42] exactly the point I'm making because
[1:44:45] after the battle of the Holy Ghost you
[1:44:47] are predestinated unto the adoption
[1:44:49] there are still seven birth pains
[1:44:55] to grow up into
[1:44:57] the attacher of a perfect man
[1:45:01] Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[1:45:06] glory to God Amen
[1:45:11] amen
[1:45:13] you exchange the Life in The Book of
[1:45:15] Life which comes by natural birth
[1:45:18] for the previous needed life in the
[1:45:20] Lamb's Book of Life which comes by
[1:45:21] spiritual bath
[1:45:23] amen
[1:45:25] but the problem said here now listen I
[1:45:27] want to talk to you why they're coming
[1:45:28] have faith
[1:45:30] you come up here he that will confess me
[1:45:32] before men he will not comfort from my
[1:45:33] father now you confess what you are
[1:45:36] now you confess what what where you are
[1:45:40] how you've neglected God you confess
[1:45:42] them as wrong and say that I'm sorry God
[1:45:45] that I did that
[1:45:47] I'm sorry find favor with God
[1:45:50] then watch what he will do for you
[1:45:53] that you were wrong and it will take
[1:45:56] care of the rest of it this is not to
[1:45:57] condemn you this will catch you free
[1:46:00] just confess you're wrong and we'll take
[1:46:02] care of the rest of it because this
[1:46:04] Spirits here don't really have power
[1:46:05] over you
[1:46:08] don't really have power
[1:46:11] sin deceives you sin is a Deceiver

[1:46:46] of Hell into the devil's eye blinding
[1:46:50] from the gospel and yet go beyond that
[1:46:53] and peek out of them souls and bring
[1:46:56] them in you are still God you are still
[1:46:58] Jesus the reason when we thank thee for
[1:47:01] this there's John in here they are your
[1:47:04] children there's only one thing they can
[1:47:06] do is to come and confess that they're
