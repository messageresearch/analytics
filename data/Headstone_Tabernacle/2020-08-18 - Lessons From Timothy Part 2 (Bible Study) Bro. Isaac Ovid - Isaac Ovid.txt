so much brother anthony god bless you church such a great privilege to be gathered once again can we just bow our heads for a word of prayer tonight uh gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord to be able to gather in this way in this time lord and to see how lord you would allow us to be able to do things in in in in in such a way that we could still be drawn closer to you lord in our daily walk or daily talk father we could still lord make it a priority lord to put you first in our lives and we could go beyond our feelings we could go beyond our emotions we could go beyond lord the physical challenges that we may have lord and lord there's so many needs so many situations lord among your body of believers lord within this local church we thank you for lord calling us for such a time as this lord we lord we are so appreciative and so grateful that you lifted the scales from our eyes that we could see you lord both in the scripture lord and more than that to see you in the reveal word that brought lord a further revelation and shine more light on the scriptures that we could be walking in the light tonight so father lord as we approach this little study tonight lord it's not a preaching service it's a conversation lord i like to type into the cool of the evening lord when he would come down for fellowship so too we have gathered tonight just to have fellowship around your word lord to encourage one another to law to say something that could motivate us to push us to push us to a new limit to push us lord pass lord a sound barrier the prophet would say lord it's so easy to get stuck in a routine it's so easy to get stuck in a comfort zone with the things that we are used to do and the way we used to do things and lord to see how lord natural man has discovered that to create a new habit lord it takes a certain amount of time for a new habit to be formed lord and we want to be in the habit of the word a habit of prayer a habit of consecration a habit of lord trying to find lord who you are lord a deeper understanding of who you are lord and lord so that we can be so grounded in the present truth so father tonight may you lord break the scales from our eyes and lord may you help us lord help us in our homes help us to how we deal with our jobs and a lot of workplaces and and and the school situations or the home situations or whatever the challenge might be father lord we are not in a new season the whole world is trying to figure things out lord but we thank god that lord you have already figured things out and lord the pathway to glory has already been defined lord the highway to heaven is already defined so we thank you for your grace lord i pray you bless all those that are in this room tonight those that would join us along the way as it were lord may you bless those for whatever reason couldn't be here tonight lord and lord may you reveal yourself to us lord me lord i want to cast down my thoughts cast all my understanding and lord surrender to you father so may you speak to us tonight if there's anyone who needs healing tonight lord lord let your people be confident that healing is still available and healing can happen in this service lord and father if there's anyone who may be depressed feeling down feeling overwhelmed lord as a as this little study progresses may you lift that off of your people that we can leave this lord study tonight feeling confident feeling persuaded feeling a bit lighter knowing that the cares of this world are being dropped off from us so father we commit the service into your hands we commit the the study into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen it's certainly a great privilege uh to be here once again on this tuesday this bible study this time where we come together and just have a conversation about jesus and his word and how he has hidden himself in the world and how he wants to be made known and we thank god for the ministry of the prophet malachi 4 that he would come to shine light on the scriptures that the book to us is not a closed book it's an open book so we can go anywhere in the scripture and uh make more sense to it because the ministry of that elijah that prophet was the tire of all the loose ends and you know but over has been speaking about the dangers of loose ends of when things are not tied up when things are not closed up when things are not in their place it creates room for the enemy to operate so we are being challenged we are being encouraged to close the doors to close the windows to tie up the loose ends to make no room for the enemy to move you know so you know and but the branham would type this as sealed in and sealed out so sealed in and the enemy is sealed out you know and and moving along that that carriage we as it were that box cow when the inspector puts a seal of approval it sealed all the way until your redemption so we thank god tonight um for his love for his mercy anybody thank god for life this evening for being in the land of the living i know i do thank god that you have the strength to even be in this service tonight there's so many people you know i was i was hearing i guess a speech coming out of the u.s you know the u.s is also heading into elections so they have all these things and and you know sometimes it's when you sometimes it's not just what is said it's how it is said that brings it in focus you know so uh somebody was speaking and they were talking about this corona virus and i don't want to just you know you know use it as a talking point but was making a statement that every 80 seconds in the united states someone dies from the coronavirus and it's one thing to hear about that counts and this is happening but when it is said like that and you can look at the the the statistics it is true but it puts a whole different perspective that every 80 seconds somebody is dying from the coronavirus you know and this this time this this clock of time that is ticking that does not stop ticking you know by the time it is sad but by the time the service is over it is unfortunate that more people would have gone on because of this and and that is one situation because that is what is in the mainstream media right now but as time ticks things are unfolding things are changing there are forces that are moving forces in the spiritual realm forces in the ecclesiastical realm forces in the financial realm in our own country within 24 hours a new government is in place there's so much that that that that is moving there's so much that is happening and brother branham would make the reference that when he looked at the natural he looked at the the horse and buggy he looked at the car he looked at the airplane he looked at the astronaut and and he saw the progress of man in his natural if i want to use the word evolution of progress of achievements and he looked at the church and said but wait a minute if the world is moving at this peace what about the church what about the bride in advancing what should be advanced in a deeper understanding uh where we activate he would he would bring that and and and it challenges us that every day we should be making progress every single day we should be making progress you know and one of the reasons i love these sessions so much because it's not it's not us preaching a pulpit it's a conversation you know so um you know i i'm not being held to a rubric or a standard from anywhere else we are sovereign so we want to have a conversation because god expects the best from us you know and and uh many people you know they're very light about what god's expectation is you know when you look at how genesis was structured when you looked at the approach that god took to lay out everything when you looked at how specific he is and specific he was when he talked about how he wanted noah to build the act it wasn't billaboutner it wasn't a dua king he was very very specific because he is a very specific god you know he has very specific expectations of us you know when he called gideon it was for a specific thing when he called moses it wasn't moses i have a job for you no moses was given a job description every individual that god put his hands on it was not an arbitrary thing it he was putting his hands on them to do a specific thing so even when brother branham was on the it's it was to do a specific thing this elijah this messenger this prophet was to do certain things and the reality is if god put individuals in place to do certain things and we have seen it through scripture it is impossible for that thing to not be to be accomplished i want to say that one more time if god puts his hands on somebody to do a specific thing it is impossible for that thing not to happen and a classic example is jonah as much as jonah was running away from his purpose is as much as he was running to his purpose all right so you're familiar with it but as much as jonah was running away from his purpose is as much as jonah was running to his pooper so i want to encourage the young people i want to encourage the parents i want to encourage uh the church i want to encourage those that are that are dealing with different challenges i don't want to use the word just struggling but dealing with challenges because challenges are a part of life and you have to deal with it you know you could try to ignore it you could brush it aside for a season but until the challenge is dealt with it remains a challenge and one thing i've learned you know in the short years i'm on this it is it is not that life just gets easier there's no such thing as life getting easier but it is as our as our maturing in the world and in our experiences we can begin to get more developed we begin to process things a little different we begin to look at things a little different things that used to bother us five years ago cannot be affecting us the same way as it is now if that is happening then we are we are missing the mark somewhere because all through scripture it's about adding it's about maturing it's about ripening it's about progress it's about doing things to be able to handle more responsibility you know i was sharing with my wife today in looking at the situation i see that person avoids responsibility and you see responsibility is a big word because we are still in the book of timothy and timothy is a big book that deals with responsibility because as we would have discussed paul is getting ready to leave and he's placing increased responsibilities on timothy as he is preparing to leave the scene and the reality is when jesus walked on the earth and he was preparing to leave as he is leaving he is assigning responsibility you know and he cannot give responsibility to somebody who is not responsible or we we speak about it in spiritual terms adoption you know about my father's business his signature of the son is as good as the father but it comes down to being able to handle responsibilities there are responsibilities that we have to deal with as men their responsibilities we have to deal with as women their responsibility as fathers their responsibilities as sons their responsibility on your job there's responsibility in your neighborhood you cannot get away from responsibilities and as much as the natural has field in bringing a deep appreciation of responsibilities it's it's so much more that we as believers supposed to be exemplaries or examples of what it is to be responsible discipline and responsibility go hand in hand i don't know why i'm saying this it's not part of my notes but i just kind of relaxing i don't know if it'll help somebody i don't know if it'll encourage somebody but discipline and responsibility go hand in hand when they found jesus in the temple after mary and joseph had quite honestly forgotten about him when you look at the context of scripture for about three days plus they had forgotten jesus so caught up in the festivities the celebrations that was only after a while they recognized that jesus wasn't there and when they went back to him he said i have to be about my father's business he understood his responsibilities it is a responsibility to be here tonight it's a responsibility to be committed to the word yes it's discipline but it's also a responsibility because it means god has an expectation of what you do with it you know when we we're familiar with the quote what we see should put our souls into action to make a church to make a revival that we are not coming here tonight as as pentecostals as baptists has met this as message we are coming here as sons and daughters really coming to an appreciation and understanding of our responsibilities of our position position and responsibility when you get a promotion in your job to a new position that new position comes with increased responsibilities when you move within your company that position comes with increase and expectation of discipline you cannot go higher and have less discipline they cannot go higher and have less responsibility anybody with me tonight is this is this helping anybody you know so you hear it a lot in the pentecostal room a new level a higher level we're going and people don't want more responsibility because the behaviors are still operating at the original level all right so it is expected the higher you go because of the position you hold you have to say things a certain way when you hold no position you could talk all you want because nobody places weight on what you say if you have no position but by virtue of your question that is why when people look at the political landscape and they compare leadership because without being political you could address leadership you can look at leadership and we have made a point before during this whole coronavirus thing on a worldwide global scale studies have been done how different countries address the situation and how different styles of leadership and the world is placed lightly because not because you are in a position of leadership makes you a leader the same way not because you're a male it makes you a man or because you have children it makes you a father so people in different positions so looking at it biblically saul was king but in his position as king god saw him as a failure and while he is in office god is saying i found a better man so i want to challenge us that we get out of anything what we put into it and your as your responsibilities increase and as your understanding of your role if i could use the phrase in the economy of god there are many people who are listening this and say well is this is this the message the the message is is a life so there are many people who get so caught up in in the technical aspects over the random quality mechanics of the situation and when it really comes down to dealing with the pressures and struggles of life they feel the examination so i want to encourage us tonight that we are preparing to pass the examination that is what all of these things are for to pass the examination in life so that when people look at you and your past you can see you can't even take credit for it because it was god who took you through it was god who carried you through and that should be an encouragement to us all so i want to encourage every single person in this room tonight young old whether you're working you're not working whether you're between jobs whether you have a business to to lift your head high not because of pride or achievement but lift your head because you're not supposed to be down and depressed and discouraged lift your head above your situation and look up because your redemption draws nigh when you look up so i want to challenge you as a church as a body of believers we have a choice to accept our situation or do something different about it all right i might a little motivational tonight but something when i'm motivating you are motivating myself as well we have a choice to accept our situation or do something about it we talk about the lepers they sat there they say if we stay here we die if we go out we die the equal sign is dead but if we stay here nothing change if we go there at least there's a small possibility that something could work out and but abraham said that was the lowest kind of faith when you rate the scale of feet from 100 that might not be a one you call it dingy feet but he said when those guys begin to move they didn't even understand what they were walking into and they god allowed situation to unfold for them to meet a whole camp of food and blessings that they had to relax and enjoy themselves before they tell anybody else about it so i want to encourage you church smile smile put a smile on your face laugh at your situations laugh at the circumstances somebody will say what what trouble is this smile put a smile on your face look the devil in his face and say you're not taking my joy away because the joy of the lord is his strength every day i look into get your joy every day looking for peace of mind every day you wake up in the morning and say thank god for today yes you don't know how you're going to pay the bill but you thank god for today you don't know how you're in the city but you're going to work out but your thank god anyhow you don't know how the situation will be resolved but it can't go any anyhow when you study i'm gonna get to the scripture in a bit if this is okay with you when you study people who have achieved a lot of it they when they battle any mind i was reading you know somebody i was trying to do something on this this this this coroner arresting her people so thing but i was i was i was i think listen to a video reading about uh survivor and they were saying you know one thing they realize is that when you almost lie down and begin to accept it it's it's almost like he was making his point someone said he various way to just lay down and take it he said he changed his mind and said you know what i don't get them anyhow and and and doctors talk about they talk about the placebo effect they talk about the power of positive thinking and talk about the power of faith and they show through different situations how important it is to have they will call it a positive mind we can call it the right perspective or faith because fate makes you look at the impossible and cd possible it's the same principle faith makes you look at what shouldn't happen and say it could happen they will say it's a positive mindset and and they're being positive but it's principles that they are tapping into how much more we who have been given access to to talk about things like perfect feet or or super feet or or rapturing feet so it underscores i can understand in ages going past though but not this age this is the age where fear is supposed to be squashed under our feet because in this age we're not just talking about divine healing we're talking about rapture so so when the brotherhood say how can we have faith for divine healing if how could your faith would erupt your rather if you can't even have faith for divine healing so that's my little introduction tonight i pray that you're giving the devil a run i pray that you are doing all in your power to bring the devil under your feet this is not something the pastor could do it's not something the assistant pastor could do it's not something the deacon supposed to do you have power you have power and i want you to understand that if you understand who you are understand your responsibility understand what's given to you when god called gideon he didn't give gideon something he was calling out of gideon what was already there can i say that one more time when he said gideon down mighty man of allah he wasn't given he didn't have books of allah he was identifying what he was seeing in gideon so when god called you it is not calling with a plan to give although you will get certain things along the journey he is calling you because his foreknowledge has already identified certain things in you that lets him know that he could work with you i don't know if this is helping anybody tonight because one of the greatest tricks that the devil plays on your on your mind you know so i will share something with you church um so the last two days or so i wasn't feeling 100 percent now so i telling my wife boy i ain't feeling together now gone on my phone i see where the car is laughing and i go on and look up covet symptoms they try to eliminate i say well i i had this i had this i said but i feel a hundred percent too tall enough i feel like i ain't feeling good at all i go on and take a tomorrow eternal and i'm checking my temperature by now i'm i'm becoming an expert because i know the temperature i know the ranges i really think so but what i say for you letting your mind just race so just to show you how how your mind is such a powerful thing so i mentioned i think i mentioned to my dad last night or so my feelings weren't thinking he said something i'm gonna try and say probably just he said get up early sleep get that early sleep now the reality is for days and days and days i push and i'm doing this and doing that so you know when you're just going to go and go in your body just tired so last time i said let me go to sleep early i'm biting awake in this morning i feel so strong i feel so good and i say look how your mind and that is what the enemy uses you know the enemy has only one place to wage war it is in your mind and if the devil can convince you that you're not going to make it every devil can convince you that oh go away wasted time then the battle could be won right there you know but as you begin to go above the situation and you begin to begin to take authority over it and begin to realize who you are and begin to realize that that the devil has his job to do but we have our job to you your whole outlook begins to change this is encouraging anybody and and and people because listen it's so easy you know and it happens in every walk of life work shaking up you wanting i might you want to get fired i might you want to get fired i might and you there and the boss even looking at you but you're allowing your mind to go there if you place your trust on the promise of god not the promise of god for that specific job but the promise of god and he will take you off your needs that if it is allowed because nothing could come nigh job and let's go out allow it so if it is allowed that your job at your pacific location have to be adjusted it will mean that god has something better for you you know can i get a witness in the house anybody anybody in the house tonight all right so let's let's get a little a little study i hope i didn't take up too much of my time i don't tend to be too long tonight uh just to kind of recap from last week before we continue reading where we were at for those who were here just to kind of refresh your memory and for those who may not have been here we were introducing this interesting character in scripture by the name of brother timothy and we placed context on who he was because he was made very how do i say noticeable because of the attention that paul formerly known as saul placed on him we would have talked about how paul who was saul was a pharisee of the pharisees and we know about him an academic a writer we know that peter was an unlearned man we know that that that a lot of the brothers who were around jesus were were simple men but for god to write in new testament and for letters to be written he had to find an academic and he found that in this man who was saul who became paul who was so convicted and so persuaded of what he was that it took an actual encounter with god for him to change his mind and we we talked about that and we talked about paul being a messenger to the first age and out of the seven stars that the bible would reference paul would be the first all the way to william branham all right and we talked about that that that paul would be the gold standard or the benchmark so when you read anything written by paul realize that all of the ages that would follow would reference what paul presented because paul was uniquely positioned to be a connector so to speak between the the the jews and those who were trained under the old law and they want to introduce if i could say the new law that was that connection to the gentiles that if jesus hadn't blinded the jews agendas wouldn't even have a chance but as paul's ministry would expand we would understand and we were trying to come to an understanding last week of all the letters within all the letters that paul wrote that he wrote to the ephesians to colossians the galatians the philemon to timothy the titus the hebrews to the romans so thessalonians the corinthians the philippians the bulk of the new testament we made a reference to the fact that it is very interesting when someone is coming to the end of their ministry or the end of their time because you're very careful with what you say and how you see it and and what seeds you leave because you know you don't have too much time to say too much more so you're very careful with how you position things because you really have no time to waste and we have to see it ourselves that when we come to meetings like these we really don't have time to waste because the landscape is shifting and before you know it this world is finished it sounds as if it's been said for a long time but nobody has ever been in this position to see that blending of time into eternity and we would have mentioned last week that careful research would position that paul's letters to timothy would have been among the last that he would have written in so much that he would have said in second timothy 4 and we'll and we should get to it tonight for i am now ready to be offered at the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept defeat and we talked about it is interesting that his young protege as it were this timothy was a unique brother to begin with a young man raised by his grandmother raised by his mother his father is a unbeliever his father was a greek and yet still this young man made a decision and we have always preached on this and maybe just encourage you that life is about decisions we've said it over and over it's a decision to save it's a decision to spend your money it's a decision to pray is the decision to not pray is it its decision to wake up early it's a decision to wake up elite it's a decision to watch a movie it's a decision to watch your teeth it's a decision to follow the news it's the decision to it's a choice and i remember as a young man preaching youth services many years ago i was building off of the economic term opportunity cost it's one of the first principles you learn in economics and the principle is if you have five dollars and the five single five dollars allow you to buy one of two things whatever you choose to buy what you rejected economics or economists call the opportunity cost it is that thing you gave up to acquire what you went with and this is a powerful principle because what it means is that when somebody say they didn't have time to pray what they're really saying is something else was more important than praying when somebody said they didn't get time to finish their schoolwork it meant something else took priority over their schoolwork and when you amplify this and make it more in focus when you look at the fact that every single man woman child on this earth has the very same 24 hours some people it are people with 28 hours that do people with with 40 hours in a day everybody has the same exact amount of time and that's a powerful concept because if you see that every single person has the same amount of time available then when you look at the character of a man or the character of a woman or what a man has achieved in the spiritual or any natural or whatever it is it means that what really separates those who have in a spiritual realm any natural realm from those who do not have the what is really the management of time can i say that one more time what really separates is the management of time and if you live by the principles of scripture that gives you insight into you know the bible say wake up early like scripture you know do i say consider the ant simple things when you go through it and and and that's why i love it because we can take consider the aunt how we toys and it goes through all these examples and you read through proverbs and you see when those cities are in in in in so that means if you're a man given the appetite put a knife to your truth dice bible that's in the bible you know if you're a man given to appetite so if you like to eat depending on where you go put a knife to your own truth in other words behave yourself conduct yourself get in our order that is scripture so so these principles that the bible would show us about in in all labor there's reward so how could you expect a reward if there's no labor it's a principle whatever your soul your reap that's a principle so you're so certain good things you will reap good things just so bad things you'll reap these are principles and they're people in a natural who live by these principles and would achieve a certain measure and i see a certain measure of success because god is a god of his law and of his promises so that's why we say the rain will fall on the just and the unjust because it's principles all right so i'm coming to the point about choice and how timothy although it would seem as if he didn't have the best home that he would have grown up and he didn't grow up in the house of a pastor or a deacon or a believer so to speak that was he didn't have a father figure or a role model and i would have made the point last week and i hope it resonates with you for every person who speaks of what they did not have and want to use it as a reason to to account or make and i want to be careful saying there's excuses for where they're at i can show you somebody with the very same limitation who made a decision to go beyond it and you have a choice and this is one of the greatest decisions you have to make tonight you can live in the realm of negativity and look at the negative influences around you and there are people who are inspired by negativity when you're inspired by negativity you can have a party and it's called a pity party so when you're inspired by negativity you spend your time glorifying what car workout what can happen what is impossible you're what you cannot do what you can achieve what we never have but if you change your focus and your eyes and your mindset on what is possible and what is happening and what should be accomplished and achieved then your whole disposition begins to change anybody with me i don't know if this is inspiring anybody at all but i i trust that it is so timothy had to make a decision and the thing about it is your spiritual success just as your natural success is based on little decisions little decisions that we make every single day could destroy your life could destroy family to destroy your spiritual walk because you allowed a simple situation to get out of hand let's get back on on theme so we would find out that timothy made the right decisions and in making the right decision he was privileged to be able to travel with paul throughout many locations beyond the fact that he traveled with paul we will realize that many of the books that we read in the new testament you could almost say were co-authored by timothy so we would read that paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother and that timothy would be on the quality supporting end the supporting role the advisory role because he would be there with paul you know sending greetings sending encouragement sending admonition you know to each of these groups who had their own unique challenges so he would be aware of these challenges he would be aware of their situations he would be aware of all these things and then when we come to first and second timothy it'll be the first time that timothy is not sharing he is not helping he's not advising he's not admonishing he's not teaching he's not representing paul but he is now being given instruction and it's very important to us because many of us sometimes we find ourselves in the role of being a teacher or a help or advisor but it's important that we learn how to be taught and we learn how to be encouraged we learn how to be you know and and and the best example that i could see of that and i've said this before you know is is jesus the word made flesh would sit in the temple from just about age 12 as it were uh all the way to to the time that he has to take his place is his ministry as it were you know 18 years of of silence and the bible said it was his custom to be in the temple which meant jesus subjected himself to the very same thing that any young person growing up like he was would have done and at no point in time did he break ran so to speak to show he was anything more than just a believer so it is a great lesson in maturity to understand that no matter your position you could be humble no matter your station you can get advice you're not above learning from anybody so i consider myself a student of scripture i don't consider myself learning in any way but by the grace of god i love the word i love the believers and i love most of all seeing progress seeing growth peter would say add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge in other words i want to see your progress i want to see you increase i want to see you grow from strength to strength to strength so may the lord bless us tonight if you have your bibles we would have reached we were in second timothy and we were in chapter 2 and we would have reached about verse 15. so i just want to pick up from verse 14 and we're going to continue there uh for maybe a few minutes or so half hour or so and and see where we would read by the grace of god and to encourage you as we just study this together to see both try to understand if i can say that what paul is trying to share to timothy and not just what he's sharing to timothy for his edification but what timothy also had to be trying to pick up from this one two and thirdly that after all of these years have passed because it's here for a purpose for us to take instruction from it as well so when paul is speaking you have to see okay how does this help me my family house the church because this here is words of life to us all right so let's start from second timothy 2 and verse 14 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but to the subverting of the hearers all right so that's 2 verse 14 we would have read that last week as well uh and in another translation that verse 14 says remind them of these things in other words the things that i've been talking about remind them of these things and charge them before god in other words hold them before god not to quarrel about words which does no good but only ruins the hearers all right so it's an encouragement to us as believers and in life don't waste time talking about things that have no value don't waste time there's so many things to do when you have a limited time you really have to choose what to do with your time you know if you want to talk about u.s elections and this and that for the whole day you can spend your whole day doing it you know but what is the profit about it how does it benefit you how does it advance your objective spiritually naturally family wise all right and then he goes on study to show yourself approved which is what we are doing right now we are studying so that we could show ourselves a proof we want to have a clear understanding we want to have a clear understanding and an appreciation of what this means how does it apply to me so learning is not just about reading it's about how does it help me what change should i expect when i go through this all right should i serve a proof unto god a workman that needed not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but and again paul is reinforcing it here but son so now we reach a new part we we we we know it's a new territory from last week but sun profane and vein babblings for they will increase onto more ungodliness i want to read that one more time but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase onto more ungodliness the bible said the book of prophets are fool when he is silent is considered wise paul is encouraging timothy and i want to read it in another translation but avoid irreverent babble for it will lead people onto more and more ungodliness so i want to encourage you this is not about a great mystery because there are people who know great mystery and they cannot stop talking shipping us they know a lot of things about the message but catch them after work when they're not in the environment of believers and put them in the middle of a discussion about politics about the election about the government about dddd you name it they have something to say that would qualify as irreverent bubble for it will lead people into more and more ongoing you know much families and how much fights and and situations because people just said the wrong thing people are you are you and talk so much until they said what couldn't be taken back but here it is now i want you to understand the context of this conversation this is paul the apostle messing with the age speaking to a minister so he is warning a young minister a young believer because your cabinet minister you know they believe her he shouldn't be heard and saved as a believer so i want you to also see the parallels that it also applies to being a believer so listen don't talk stupidness control how you speak so when people meet you as a believer one of the attributes that you should exhibit or one of the things you should not exhibit his irreverent bible for it will lead people into more ungodliness all right and their word will eat as dot a conquer another word for kang is gangrene in other words the words have an effect on people of whom is and paul is actually naming brothers who are guilty of this thing so for them brothers you know when you read scripture and you see names names have meanings and contexts these brothers lord help them paul is using them as the reference of what not to do lord let us be examples of what to do when people call your name let your name be called as an example of what to do and what and not what not what you should not be doing but here it is policing these two brothers who considering the truth have heard hear how they've heard seeing the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some now i want you to catch this here now paul is speaking about two brothers because within context these would have been brothers who or or or men who around the faith so to speak who because the bible they bible their bible till they battle into heresy and have in fact overthrown the fate of some so they talk they talk they talk until by the time they finish talk people lost their feet so paul is encouraging can the church say amen so and then paul goes on in verse 19. nevertheless in other words all that being the case the foundation of god standing sure having this seal your lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that name it the name of christ depart from iniquity can the church say amen now he goes on so your personal life now he said but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor so he's making a very interesting positioning here he is saying there are different kinds of vessels some are gold some are silver some are wood and clay despite you being gold you could be gold and honorable or gold and dishonorable i want you to see that you could be silver and honorable and it could be silver and dishonorable you could be wood and honorable you could be wood and dishonorable you could be clay and honorable you could be clay and dishonorable in other words no matter your station there's a choice of being honorable or dishonorable everybody seeing that so paul is painting a tapestry for timothy to understand no matter what your station you have a choice to be honorable or dishonorable so he goes on 21 if a man therefore purge himself from these now this is not god purging no this is if a man and that would purge in this context mean cleanse so therefore if anyone cleans himself from what is dishonorable everybody with me so if a man therefore pulls himself from these he shall be a vessel under honor sanctified and meet for the master's use that word is fit or useful to the master so in other words paul now is coming home to timothy and saying you have work to do and this is what a lot of people don't like to hear that they have the actual work to do so as much as i come tonight and highlight this you have a choice to do to be honorable to push yourself from the dishonorable to push yourself from the conversations from the friends from the whatsapp chats from the facebook groups from the websites from the movies from the newspapers from whatever it is that could contaminate you that you could be honorable so here paul is actually bringing a message of sanctification right here anybody with me everybody with me and whatever i've been preaching about it i'm just showing you everything that is preached and is brought to the prophetic message you can find it in scripture you just have to slow down take your time and read it and meditate on it and then he goes on so he's nailing it down now flee also youthful lust so just after you deal with dishonorable and honorable keep going in for the kill flee also youthful lust you'd hear preach avoid shady places but this flea don't mean walk away you know this flea flea is not even running her young brothers young sisters this flea is not walk it's not even run it's not jog away this is run for your life you know flea also youthful loss and i like how this is positioned because youthful lust is not speaking to young people oh boy youthful lust is not speaking to young people it is speaking to the lust associated with being young so you could be 70 years old with youthfulness oh help us jesus so this is not a message here to young people it's a message to the entire church flee also youthfulness but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart listen carefully i want to say it again i want you to see this follow righteousness faith charity peace with them the operative teaching here is not just follow after charity and he says no it is how you follow you are following with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart this sounds familiar this sounds like when the prophet said if you want to get the holy ghost spend time with people who have the holy ghost anybody remembers that so he say in following in following righteousness and faith you're supposed to be following it with them so it means your associations your friends the people around you you're with them who you spend your time with them and you do things with them they should be following the same principles and that call on the lord out of a pure heart one of the reasons and again i don't like excuses if if anybody spend enough time with me he would know i don't like excuses and maybe maybe something i got from the way god treated moses but when moses finished talk and talk and talk and had all his excuses god say you're still going one of the greatest challenges that i've seen with young and old is people who have created stronger bonds and friendships quote unquote with people who don't share their values their beliefs their trajectory their direction so you have a situation and instead of talking to somebody who is of defeat because i am sharpening iron and confess your fault one to another these scriptures may not have resonated with them just yet they go for advice and counsel from people who have no foundation in word and scripture so they are following after other things and they confide in people who really cannot have their best interest because they don't know what best interest looks like is this speaking to anybody so the point i want to make about excuses is when people say to me well i don't have any friends in church oh i do have any believers who are friends but you have friends in in your job right so so isn't that also a choice isn't who you who you choose to talk with and spend time with and deliberate about isn't that also a choice that you make so again if something is really important to you it should be that you put extra to get it you know and i was sharing with my wife recently you know you look at people do do things and stuff and i say you know when somebody really wants something you know because they will go all out to get it they already want it they will go all out because it's important to them you ask somebody for a favor they say well i'll do it i'll do it for you but but and it you can't vex with them because when they have to do something for themselves that is important to them you listen you need to wake up three o'clock in the morning the upper tree in the morning you know because they find it important to them so i want to challenge you don't make the mistake of having all these friends in your workplace or in your school or in a neighborhood who are not sharing this because in the attempt to flee youthful lust you have to this is the instruction of timothy unto us tonight follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart we can spend the whole next 30 minutes talking about the pure hard part because people call on you lord but many not with a pure heart pure heart means a heart without an agenda a heart without you know uh uh uh how do you say boy i'm i'm blessed and not stressed anything and there's no attempt to reconcile those statements with a life so it's not from my place of genuineness so you have the psalmist david who was always saying creating me a clean heart a pure heart renewing the right spirit within me and all of these scriptures is to see he paralyzed through the word so that we can reflect and look at our daily lives because the word friends have to have an impact on daily lives i don't know if this has been anybody but my deep desire is to see the world living me and the world living in us is not a sunday wednesday night tuesday bible study friday night situation we're dealing with situation on the job in your work in your neighborhood in the bank and you tell me boy i get so vexed with that bank man here give me the loan and think and what's not and you give up customer a long time ago but in your heart your formerly same energy uniformly words or no but the energy when they translate the energy of what your walker the banquet that i'm considering is the same thing because you still have issues that you have to resolve and when you look at it that is not how jesus was would would would conduct himself that is not how the prophet would behave himself can the church say amen so what we are fighting for is a life and when you strip back all the cosmetics strip back all the acting strip back the great performing and academy awards stellar award behavior we do god bless you behind that barrier behind that veil that inner man has to be dealt with and that is what the word comes to deal with the inner man to strip out to perform surgery by the word by the scripture so that we can grow up to be sons and daughters of god that could handle the responsibility and he could say dear is my spirit flowing freely friends for the spirit of god to flow freely it means there's no hindrance there's no obstacle there's nothing that could stop god flow into your life sickness can't stop him flowing your past cast up and throw him don't cast up him fluid his spirit could flow freely because you have brought everything on the subjection and kind of chill say man at this rate prove it this is a study of timothy part two it looked like we might have to do a part three because we move in slowly we move in we win straight tonight but i hope it's been a blessing to you i hope that you are enjoying this as much as i am and um and and and you want to take it and apply it in your daily walk okay so but foolish this is verse 23 now this is interesting but foolish and unlearned questions avoid but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strife in another champion they have nothing to do with foolish and ignorant controversies you know that they breed quarrels you know people like to pick fights they get that pleasure they get that pleasure and see like they know they know just what to say to get you to respond a certain way and if you don't know how to avoid either the situation or the people before you know it you'll be in a strife winner so but interestingly just to put things in context every scripture you could read about timothy there is nothing to suggest that timothy was like peter when you look at peter peter comes across as he ready peter is like peter fella if you're in trouble you're one peter with you you know if you're ever in a problem you have people around you who you you know they go they would jump they would jump they would jump in the fight peter is the kind of one somebody testing it people say were you i i hear i with your hair with you don't worry i with you timothy doesn't come across like that kind of man timmy comes across very meek very gentle in fact theologians would say he was he almost came across a little sickly you know very very vitamin but here it is paul is encouraging him but foolish and unlearned question avoid knowing that you'll end up in a coral and listen nobody has ended up in a quarrel and felt good about it anybody is there anybody in this room tonight who went through a coral and he didn't have no headache your blood pressure didn't raise your choke is it is there anybody who like warling so as a principle so many times and when you read this and you see paul is speaking to timothy as a son so if your father never tell you this this is paul in a role of a father speaking to a son in the ways of life and your way of living to avoid issues the quarrel that you end up here in is not the devil portuguese this is you encouraging and getting involved in foolish and alone questions and creating your own issues all right anybody with me all right good let's move on so that what was said is now a background to introduce and pause writing when you read this it's really profound like it is really racist because it's almost like he lays a foundation creates almost like the opposite situation paints a picture of what not to do and then comes them back to what to do and the sermon of the lord so he's speaking to him as a minister as a young ma as a young man servant of the lord and but this applies to all of us because we are all in our own little worlds a servant but ibrahim teaches us that everybody is a preacher you mean you may not preach any pulpit but your your your your your preachers so many you live your sermon and the servant of the lord must not strive and that word strive in that context is not must be quarrelsome so whenever you see a brother or sister just quarrel something you know it that's not a it's not quarrel back with them just pray for them just remember them and pray they're working out they're still working on it but don't get any quarrel because brought up here they're not into problems and the several law must not strive wheaton waiting on the promise waiting on an answer waiting for you still small voice that is something that we have to practice practice patience there's so many things we think we want in life and many times we get into trouble because we rush to do things without exhibiting patients so they're just dropping that in there in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves friends there will always be opposition all the people who do agree with you even paul and peter didn't see eye to eye but it's how you manage it it's how you deal with it if god per adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will so that's the end of chapter two and we're gonna just go a little bit into second timothy three this is a big one because you see it through the message you see it always been identified as a bucket second timothy tree spirits is a whole bunch of spirits there's a whole bunch of spirits in there but this know also that in the last days powerful scripture perilous time shall come and i don't know about you but this is spiritual times it's a time of difficulty this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god against that backdrop your apostle paul goes on having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away and i think everybody here would have heard this before but i deliberately wanted to read it slowly because whatever you see going on in the world you can find it under one of these things without self-control lovers of self proud abusive disobedient appearance despises of those that are good lovers of pleasure one and lovers of god it is easy to for people to do what goes against god versus coming under subjection to god you speak to somebody who has been here for some time they would say when 20 40 50 years ago everybody walked the street to say good morning good morning but as time passed what they call manners are to go away all of that is part of the what is called the apostasy falling away part of this breakdown what they call a breakdown in society is really a spiritual condition disobedient appearance it's a spirit so it's not the child it's a spirited you know the spirit of the age and then what makes it an insult is that these conditions can be wrapped into having a form of godliness and this is where it gets destructive now because you have people who are exhibiting these behaviors but they have a form of godliness so they they're trying to be spiritual trying to be religious but denying the power thereof because denying the power because the power brings you under subjection to god but if and say was your holy was given for power to pray power to live a holy life power to speak so the power of god you can't tell me you have the power of god and you have the holy ghost and you and you're exhibiting these behaviors and these behaviors exist not just in the world friends they actually operate within the church within the framework of the church and brother branham said within every setup three kinds of believers so it is it is not that that we are ignorant of this but we have to understand that this is also now prophecy that we are living in when we see this for of this sort are they which creep into houses so if you never read it before i want you to understand it creep in the houses and lead captive silly woman laden with sins led away by divers lust ever learning but robert preaches this a lot ever learning i'm never able to come to the knowledge of the truth so the more information they get the more knowledge the more revelation the more ideas you're getting more but you're not getting closer to the truth and i've spoken this before you see you can't hide in front of the truth because no lie can stand in front of the truth so you closely get the truth a good example is like isaiah coming into the presence of god when you're away from the truth you can't see so if the truth is light and light is true the further your way you can't see your issues you can't see your faults but if you instead of learning and you're getting closer to the truth you will never see an issue so you can't even come out of what you're in because the closer you come to truth or the light you begin to see your issues and any issues is not anybody else you know the issue becomes you and you could only you know when you're really coming contact with the truth or the light because you're now focused all your fingers in yourself who is me that's the only thing somebody who comes to the light will will begin to say where is me because you will see the light with no highlights wait a minute wait a minute i need to fix this i need to fix that paul is saying ever learning and that's why you have people who wait a message for years they know a lot of stuff but the truth is not there because survive what is coming or what is dealing with right now with just knowledge you cannot survive with jessica information you have to meet the truth the knowledge of the truth and paul goes on now as janice and jamboree witstered moses so do these also resist the truth and i want to do a teaching sometime with this issue of truth because this is this is the real this is the real real real thing here jesus said i'm the way i'm the truth i'm the life most people can't confront the truth i'll say that again most people cannot confront the truth because you have to be really prepared to deal with the truth there's some people say well i can't do this and i can't do this and if they already hear the truth behind what is holding them back they don't want to accept it i'll give you another example the truth has to deal with blame as well so you have people saying well the reason i am this way is because this happened but the real truth is you can't blame anybody else for your decisions and your actions you know but it's easy it is convenient it is convenient to blame other situations for your position but the truth now places it squarely back on your responsibility to take action we will spend some more time talking about that now as janice and jamboree withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning defeat but they shall proceed no further for their follies shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was so paul is saying the same way janice and jamborees ended up being exposed those who operate the same way men of corrupt mind reprobate concerning defeat who come to deceive and you see they will all to be exposed so this is this is now a whole shift in paul's instructional timothy around our behavior and he's saying and now we've committed a doctrine and friends we cannot be ignorant of the issue of doctrine we cannot be ignorant on the devil trying to clot your mind from seeing what your portion is what your inheritance is what your spiritual possession should be nothing should distract you from your spiritual journey and purpose of adoption of perfection of the holy ghost of seven living voices because that is where we want to be that is what we should be displaying can the church say amen so now paul begins to give some measure of the antidote so to speak and begin to speak to encourage him now but thou has fully known my doctrine now that's a powerful statement so paul is speaking to a preacher and we have lady background so friends as believers as sons and daughters can you make a statement that you fully know the doctrine that you understand this message that if somebody comes with something that's beautifully presented that you can say no that is not what it is because paul will be the same one to say if an angel comes from heaven and he says something different let him be accused so this whole thing is about studying to be approved to understand induction so when you hear something because i've said it before it is impossible to prepare you for every count of it because common defense will always exist so the best defense we have is to make sure that the truth is so plain that you understand what a real dollar looks like so that when a culture will come you can say this is not that this is not that this is not that anybody with meat tonight but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long suffering charity patience everybody with me persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecution i endured but out of them all the law delivered me that's powerful out of all of these afflictions out of all of these persecutions i endured and the lord delivered me anybody could say that there was a lord that delivered you so many situations you have gone through in your journey to be here tonight and it's not your effort that took you through but is the lord that brought you through any church say amen yay and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution i want to say that one more time all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution and then paul goes on we're almost done yeah we're actually gonna we're gonna make it to where i wanted to be at tonight just a few more minutes but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived now that scripture right there i don't even know what to deal with that because evil men and seducers shall what's worse and worse deceiving and being deceived no but a clearance it's one thing to be deceiving people it's the next thing when you see people and you yourself being deceived in them whether it's create that that is a that's a scary thing and what's worse and worse which means false doctrine false interpretation misappropriating scripture taking a prophet message and and the amount of craziness has come out of people who have done horrible harm with the script any message and when you thought it couldn't get worse there's worse when you thought they can create a new crazy adoption there's a crazy adoption and then you realize what's worse than was deceiving and being deceived but and i love this no matter how bad it gets no matter if it gets worse and worse no matter if they become deceived and they themselves deceiving and it doesn't matter but continue thou in the things which joe has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them in other words continue let me oh hallelujah anybody with me tonight but as for you but as for you continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed knowing from whom you have learned it hallelujah and that from a child though has known the holy scriptures you see the importance of knowing the scriptures and i've said it on congress location one of the greatest weaknesses in the message message believers do not know the bible and the ministry of that elijah was to shine more light on scripture so you have to study body message and the scripture because this word this written word this is the foundation but the branham himself had to go in scripture to find himself so his and he made the point clear he said whenever the angel came to me i checked what the angel said in scripture so if you don't know what scripture says how can you verify if is the right angel so that is but a branham himself had his own test he said when the angel came and brandon when you said he said it was it's been about six months since i saw the angel and when he came the angels looked at me and walked away and you have all these encounters but you see when he and judge speak i would first go and check the scripture to make sure that what the angels say and lining up in scripture so we want to be a church that is a word church a church that's built on this message of the hour but the church has also based firmly in scripture so that when paul's saying but from a child though has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise under salvation true faith which is in christ jesus can the church say amen we almost finished and then paul nailed it down he said all scripture all scripture i want to nail it down it's given by inspiration of god and that's why brother branham said he said if you read the bible and don't see jesus in every verse read it again because all scripture is given by inspiration of god and it's profitable you want to make a profit you can make a guaranteed profit here it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so but ibrahimovic you want to grow as a christian read your bible pray every day and you'll grow we sing it in sunday school read your bible pray every day show me somebody in argument show me somebody in baccanal show me and by something i mean believers there in these situations i mean you will show me somebody who's not reading and praying every day hallelujah show me somebody who can find their way in life under this covenant because when you leave the world you're on a new covenant the principles that apply to the world don't apply to you when you leave the world let me say that one more time when you leave the world you are under a new covenant and that new covenant means the all rules no longer apply because you know better you you understand better can the church say amen all scripture is given by buffet style this thing you can't say well i like this and i don't like this and i don't like this all scripture is given by inspiration of god and it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness why there's a purpose that the man of god may be perfect we want perfection thoroughly furnished unto all good works so we don't want to take things for granted we don't want when the exam come we didn't know this answer we didn't think this was on the book we didn't know we want to ensure that we keep the main thing remaining no compromise with that but we want to spend quality time in the world so that this becomes our source this becomes our reference point where the brahman said i don't if you you remember i think you gave the story of this supposed to came out to pray and he said he could have see it was a pretty person he was a prayer or warrior he could see the parade so it comes out of your life if you pray it comes out of your life if scripture and the word is your source it troubles me when people know more about politicians and more about geography and geology and all these things and i don't know that you can find geography and geology and chemistry and biology and philanthropics all in scripture and if you get this right it'll change your life it'll change your work it'll change your talk can the church say amen i'm gonna wrap up here we on the home stretch i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preached a word so this is i take a minister myself and i'm challenging you with this with your life preach you would be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhorted all long suffering and doctrine so when are tired you still have to do it when you don't feel like doing it it's let you do it because it's a responsibility for the time will come when and we in that time now when they will not endure sound doctrine what is sound doctrine when something is sound it means it can be defended it means it is properly established i have heard people use scriptures and connect scriptures that cannot be connected you realize it new schema cannot be connected misappropriate scripture and because they want to run with one's quote or one word for something to be sound it has to line up but a time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts and that's the problem after their own desires after their own interests after what they would like to happen and the way they wanted to happen and the way they were seeing it and how they would like it to unfold shall he shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables these are the community last words that paul is speaking so paul is speaking out the greatest warnings to timothy on the eve of his departure so if you want to give more weight to the words as they come down this is it preach the word be instant in season out of season lockdown no lockdown churches can meet do it and zoom whatever you have to do reprove rebuke exhort with all long long suffering say it over and over again the book of accent and with many other words did they many other words they found other ways to say it because they want to get the message home that you're going to make it that you have to make it that you have to separate yourself and you have to do things differently but you have to sell out surrender all with all long-suffering and doctrine so you understand the foundation of your belief because if you don't people could blow you away but if you understand and you know why you do what you do what is the purpose then nobody can move you for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall be heaped to themselves teachers having itching ears they want to hear something new something nice they they their other twinkling story tell me that a little different i never hear that before oh we know nobody ever said it the prophet never said that they shall turn away their heirs from the truth and shall be turned into fables but watch dow in all things endure affliction affliction do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of that ministry and we're going to end with these last three verses and we're done tonight for i am not ready to be offered so this is the context now showing this is he's wrapping up his ministry here the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight hallelujah i have finished my course it is something powerful when you know you finish your mission i have finished my course i have kept defeat henceforth is laid up for me he is speaking knowing knowing what his position was there was no doubt in his mind henceforth has laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word and we said it last week but the branham was comforted by that statement i've preached what paul preached so i want to challenge the church tonight as we bring this study of timothy to a close and we will see what the lord will will take us through that you continue to study the word continue to make the scriptures a joy make the scriptures a place of refuge when they have questions go into the scripture you might actually see something unfold you'll say wait a minute what i'm going through is right here because there's nothing new under the sun that scripture also so what you are going through somebody else has already gone through what you are going through somebody has already went through that so i want to encourage you to keep your head up stay in courage let's just bow our heads for our word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you tonight lord for this little study around the scripture not uh a great explosion of mystery and and and trying to to to to bring our weight on the people lord but uh to take the scriptures and just breathe some some life in it that you could walk on the pieces of the bible and lord as a humble bunch of believers we can understand how each piece of the puzzle fits into this plan of redemption law that you saw before the world even began how in your great divine mystery lord you were unfold from eternity through time to back to eternity and to close out this great race lord you would have a bright elect an elect lady a lady about to come into power and how the enemy would try to distract and try to deter and try to to bring all kinds of opposition but lord in the midst of it all we could find ourselves lord under the canopy of life around your word and we could only look into the scripture this way lord because of your grace send us a prophet lord a prophet who would lord go into the mind of god and see lord the things you would want us to see in such a time as this lord to see the plainness of god and lord who you are your nature your being your attributes and what we are to become so father may you bless your sons and your daughters lord as we continue to strive lord to get into that place to our position lord to be placed in christ lord even adoption lord where you could say there's my spirit flowing freely where lord is not us identified with the message but the message identifying with us not us identifying with you but you identify with us so lord we long for the day when he could place that seal of approval lord and sons and daughters who have died out died out to their ideas to their emotions and their feelings to what they were like and they have yielded completely to the mind of christ so may you break every chain that may be holding your people back if there's anyone sick tonight lord god may you heal and may you touch if there's anyone going through anxiety tonight may you lift the anxiety the nervousness the tension the prophet preacher message letting all the pressure lord may we let all of the pressure tonight to know that all will be well lord we love you tonight we appreciate you we thank you you
