[30:25] I want to get something clear for you
[30:29] you might be thinking what is going on
[30:32] brother Bradham clarify this in
[30:36] 1962.
[30:39] he said the Beast
[30:42] churches
[30:43] core churches
[30:47] they are not churches
[30:50] let me be sure
[30:53] that's on record
[30:57] they are not churches
[31:04] people join them
[31:07] but you cannot join the Church of the
[31:11] Living God
[31:13] you're born into it
[31:17] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:20] s
[31:23] and when you are baptized with the Holy
[31:26] Ghost
[31:28] these virtues
[31:33] by the Holy Ghost
[31:36] and therefore
[31:38] he that is born of God
[31:55] be clear on these things
[31:58] the Church of the Living God
[32:01] is based on the Bible
[32:04] we can never do those things
[32:06] it is not hating anybody
[32:10] it is loving the Bible
[32:13] that's what it's all about
[32:15] I hope that helps somebody
[32:18] shall we stand to our feet as we go into
[32:21] the word
[32:22] I've got control here Tech Team
[32:27] and I want to talk today
[32:31] to me a very meaningful subject
[32:37] from faith dinner faith
[32:42] from Faith to Faith and I want everybody
[32:47] to say
[32:49] I'm not content
[32:57] [Music]
[33:20] [Music]
[33:27] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[33:30] from the West and his glory from the
[33:35] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[33:39] come in like a flood just look around
[33:42] you it's coming like a flood the spirit
[33:45] of the Lord
[33:47] shall lift up a standard against him God
[33:55] is never
[34:04] bloody
[34:05] foreign
[34:33] and such as do wickedly against the
[34:37] Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries
[34:41] but the people that do know their God
[34:46] shall be strong and do exploits
[34:57] he
[35:01] is
[35:11] Saint Luke 17 5 leak
[35:24] amen so faith can be increased
[35:31] the apostles said unto the Lord
[35:35] increase our faith
[35:43] amen Romans 1 17.
[35:58] for therein is the righteousness of God
[36:04] revealed
[36:06] from faith to Faith
[36:10] as it is written
[36:11] the just shall live by faith
[36:17] is
[36:26] amen and then Romans 10 verse 17.
[36:32] so then
[36:34] faith
[36:36] cometh by hearing
[36:39] and hearing by the word of God Amen is
[36:49] amen amen one Peter 1 7 Empire I said
[36:55] watch this that the trial of your faith
[37:00] being much more precious
[37:04] than of gold that perisheth
[37:07] though it betrayed with fire
[37:12] might be found unto praise and honor and
[37:17] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[37:24] is
[37:36] wonderful let's just power heads in a
[37:38] word of prayer
[37:39] no we've jumped ahead
[37:43] um we just we just come to take us back
[37:45] to the

[38:12] but something is increasing
[38:16] it's getting greater
[38:18] it doesn't seem so
[38:21] but it's getting bigger
[38:24] God I bless and thank you today
[38:28] guidance stair us as we go forth in the
[38:32] name of Jesus Christ may we leave this
[38:34] place different people
[38:37] that we may be ready
[38:39] and Lord as your scripture says
[38:42] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[38:46] Ed
[38:49] from faith
[38:50] unto faith in Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:54] and amen amen you can be seated sayings
[38:56] God bless you richly we maybe missed a
[38:59] slide there but uh we're just going to
[39:02] move forward those are the um
[39:05] can we just uh it seems to be not
[39:08] working now
[39:10] okay we've read that we're going to go
[39:13] down to one I want to start over here
[39:16] brother Branham says I hope there's just
[39:18] one slide we've missed there okay he
[39:20] says I can't heal you
[39:23] that's very important Church
[39:25] brother Branham can't heal
[39:30] so when you're looking for healing
[39:33] remember brother branham's Ministry
[39:38] was there to to show you
[39:42] what to do second for fair and what
[39:46] things are holding it back
[39:49] because when we when we think of this
[39:53] are you the healer look you've missed
[39:56] everything
[39:58] don't look at brother Branham as a
[40:01] Healer
[40:03] Jesus has already healed you
[40:08] at the cross
[40:10] his prophetic Ministry
[40:13] is there to help you
[40:16] to know what's wrong
[40:19] why you're not getting healed
[40:21] that's our prayer Lord Jesus he used to
[40:26] talk to them
[40:28] and he used to to say things to Gary
[40:43] he was there as a uh like like a jack of
[40:47] a car
[40:48] as you press the jacket
[40:51] the car goes up
[40:53] and he lifted up their faith
[40:57] to get them to because he can't change
[41:00] the rules
[41:02] you have to have the faith
[41:05] I can't heal you
[41:08] but Jesus Christ
[41:10] has healed you
[41:12] when he died at Calvary
[41:15] do you believe it if God will reveal to
[41:19] me
[41:20] what you are
[41:22] and who you are
[41:24] and something about you
[41:28] that you will accept your healing
[41:31] it's not it's not William Branham that
[41:34] did it
[41:36] but he brought you up
[41:40] because he can't change
[41:42] he has to do
[41:45] something
[41:46] to show you why
[41:50] why I'm able to show people
[41:52] what they're holding back in their lives
[41:56] if they need to confess
[41:58] because the healing
[42:00] has already been done
[42:03] but he's got to find out why
[42:07] why aren't they being healed and remove
[42:10] the obstacles and then it says you're
[42:13] healed
[42:14] praise be to God so I want to get that
[42:18] real When you pray for healing
[42:21] Jesus Christ
[42:26] something happened like all the
[42:29] obstacles were removed
[42:31] and Christ a Christian was the one who
[42:35] did it
[42:35] in fact he healed her at the cross
[42:39] but she accepted what he's already done
[42:42] hallelujah
[42:45] let's go a bit further with this
[42:47] amen it's sticking can you just help me
[42:50] to go across
[42:52] something must be good going to happen
[42:54] when this starts maybe we can change
[42:56] this around
[42:58] see if you can take a shot press it one
[43:01] more time
[43:02] I depend on this
[43:04] he says healing
[43:07] he says when I'm gone
[43:09] when William branham's gone
[43:12] which he is
[43:16] when I'm gone
[43:18] healing isn't gone
[43:37] that is healing
[43:39] when I'm gone
[43:41] healing isn't gone
[43:44] are you ready I expect a big amen on
[43:47] this healing
[43:51] ought to even be more
[43:55] than it was before we came here
[43:59] after brother
[44:02] healing should have gone from Faith
[44:05] to Faith
[44:07] it should have gone even higher
[44:10] he says healing ought to be more
[44:14] we shouldn't we say oh the prophet's
[44:17] gone
[44:18] no no because Jesus Christ has already
[44:22] healed us
[44:23] can you shout a big Amen on that one
[44:27] he says healing ought to be more
[44:30] please than it was before we came here
[44:35] that's the purpose is to get the people
[44:39] in their minds
[44:42] in the spirit of the last days
[44:45] we are in the latter day
[44:48] he said do you believe that the world is
[44:53] in the spirit
[44:54] of the latter days
[44:58] the blessing this marriage that marriage
[45:03] we don't hate anybody
[45:06] whatever
[45:41] [Music]
[46:06] impossible
[46:25] but may God wants his church
[46:29] so in the spirit
[46:32] they will just fit in wherever God
[46:34] leaves them
[46:37] that's what we want we don't want Jesus
[46:40] to say to us
[46:42] little faith
[46:46] we don't want that
[46:50] we have heard the word that has come to
[46:52] the prophet
[46:54] it says the world
[46:58] but God wants the church so in the
[47:01] spirit
[47:03] wherever he leaves them they'll go
[47:08] he says he if we can't have faith
[47:12] for Divine Healing
[47:15] [Music]
[47:16] are we going to have for the rapture
[47:24] friend I mean there's a Time coming
[47:27] that when there is a church a rising
[47:31] upper Church
[47:34] it should be more
[47:36] than when brother Brandon was here
[47:40] it shouldn't be less
[47:43] No it should be even more
[47:47] we can't have faithful Divine Healing
[47:52] how are we going to have faith for the
[47:54] Rapture
[47:56] we've got to move out friends

[49:16] but one huge step for mankind
[49:21] I'm telling you church when brother
[49:24] Brown that was a huge step for mankind
[49:28] because that was the end of the world
[49:31] the seventh seal ends and ends time
[49:35] huge steps
[49:38] and he said he even said I believe those
[49:40] standards will be revealed
[49:42] to get the bride together

[1:10:05] because Christ is the mystery of God
[1:10:09] revealed

[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:18] who God is
[1:11:21] they
[1:12:21] never acted like us
[1:12:25] probably men of few words
[1:12:31] just one not from God
[1:12:49] God just nodded
[1:12:56] Hallelujah maybe God is nodding to you
[1:13:00] maybe there's something he wants you to
[1:13:02] do
[1:13:05] one little note from God
[1:13:11] how could they know
[1:13:16] how could they know they had the virtues
[1:13:22] qualifications
[1:13:24] and the first little nod to the premiere
[1:13:28] of God
[1:13:30] compared with everything here
[1:13:33] and they knew it was the word of God and
[1:13:38] away they went yeah they didn't have to
[1:13:41] worry about nothing else
[1:13:47] something is rising here
[1:13:50] something is getting bigger
[1:13:52] amen is getting more powerful
[1:13:55] your prayers are changing
[1:13:58] hey man if you want yourself to change

[1:14:08] change yourself
[1:14:10] amen start confessing bigger things
[1:14:15] God can move that mountain for me
[1:14:18] if you want bigger things
[1:14:27] not just a faith
[1:14:33] everybody says
[1:14:35] Donald Trump says that remember Donald
[1:14:37] Trump lady everybody got faith we want
[1:14:40] to go from faith
[1:14:43] okay
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:15:23] again not just a face
[1:15:26] everybody
[1:15:28] but a perfect faith
[1:15:33] Build It Up In Here yes
[1:15:46] by his perfect word
[1:15:49] which is sharper than a two-way sword
[1:15:54] we are coming now
[1:15:57] to the Perfection
[1:16:00] because people has to come to this
[1:16:05] amen amen they have to come to this in
[1:16:09] order for the Rapture
[1:16:11] you can't do your thing for sure you
[1:16:14] can't have Frank Sinatra faith
[1:16:18] I did it my way
[1:16:21] you can't have that Faith no you've got
[1:16:25] to have perfect faith
[1:16:44] in order for the Rapture
[1:16:46] that's what's holding it away
[1:16:50] waiting for that church
[1:16:53] to come to that perfect
[1:16:56] raptured faith I said foreign
[1:17:57] because the revelations is
[1:18:03] you cannot have
[1:18:06] a revelation in Revelation without it
[1:18:09] being faith
[1:18:12] hallelujah amen this is
[1:18:17] a revelation
[1:18:20] because it's something that's been
[1:18:23] revealed to you
[1:18:27] I will build my church
[1:18:29] the gates of hell would I Prevail
[1:18:33] faith is something that's been revealed
[1:18:36] to you
[1:18:37] like it was to Abraham Abraham he would
[1:18:41] call anything contrary
[1:18:44] to what was revealed to him
[1:18:47] as though it wasn't so son existed
[1:18:50] Abraham now faith that is what faith is
[1:18:55] the revelation of God
[1:18:58] the church is built upon Revelation
[1:19:02] Revelation the whole entire body
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:09] was saved by revelation
[1:19:29] foreign
[1:19:42] I'm expecting
[1:19:46] expectations
[1:19:50] expectation I know what God's about to
[1:19:53] do
[1:19:54] let your subconscious God reacting
[1:19:58] then the faith of God
[1:20:01] will confirm we'll back it up
[1:20:04] because your faith it won't do much
[1:20:11] you need to go from Faith to Faith from
[1:20:15] your faith to God's faith
[1:20:18] you have to go you have to do that
[1:20:21] God's faith Moves In Love foreign
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:49] he says if you've got aim he said that's
[1:20:53] the problem people have a mental Faith
[1:20:57] instead of heart Faith
[1:20:59] you have to go from mental Faith
[1:21:03] to Heart Faith
[1:21:06] from Faith to Faith if you say you
[1:21:10] believe
[1:21:11] and you don't get the baptism
