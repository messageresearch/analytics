compassion for those who are struggling and they don't know what to do open balls of compassion the compassion of god made go out this morning by your word and by your spirit then jesus may ask it amen god bless you and welcome to our sunday morning service be so glad that you're here this morning i pray that god bless you so each of your bibles i'd like you to turn to matthew chapter 24. we want to read from verse 36 to 51. and ii peter 3 we want to read from 1-14 matthew chapter 24 reading from verse 36 but of that day and hour no no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only this is in red this is jesus speaker but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark i knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field one shall be taken the other left two women shall be crying at the mill the one shall be taken the other left watch therefore for you know not what our your lord that come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the teeth would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such a hour as he think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord had made rule over his household to give them meat and due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing there will i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods and but and if that evil servant shall see in his heart my lord delete his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that savior and shall come in a day when you look at not for him and now when he's not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping a nation of teeth praise the lord we want to go to second peter chapter three verse one this second epistle beloved i know right unto you and both which i steal up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that they shall come in the last days coffins walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of create the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of water and in the water and whereby the world that then was being overflowed and water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserve unto fire against the day of judgment and peridition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the lord glory is not slack considering his promise some men come slackness but his lone suffering to us what not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away but great noise and the elements shall melt with fruit and heat the it also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up see and then and all these things shall be dissolved let me say that one again see and then that all these things shall be resolved what manner of persons ought to be in all holy conversation and godliness and that conversation not talk that's living looking for visiting and hasting unto the common of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be resolved and the elements shall melt with truth and heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth when dwelleth righteousness and wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found in him in peace without spot and blameless let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word bless it interpret our hearts this morning take me out to the way and and lord whatever you once said me you open my mouth to speak it or what you don't want me to see me i close my mouth lord jesus just shut the mouth of the lions then father god shut my mouth lord and just give me the words that your people need to hear this morning and jesus might ask it amen you will be seated oh praise god god bless you again and welcome it's good to be in the house of god i trust them that uh you are you are pressing on by god's grace amen and you are fighting this great fight of fate who praised god we have a title this morning and the title is a question and from the scriptures where is the promise of his coming as a title where is the promise of his commandment trust by the end of this series we'll be able to answer that question the promise of his coming but he is coming you know but they know we have a promise of his coming or praise in the middle of the lord so i have a context scripture first thessalonians 4 i would not have to be ignorant brethren considering them which are asleep that you sorrow not as others who have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so also with which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord and this here is his coming this weekend to you by the word of the lord that we which alive remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself have not been with pastor bishop pope minister apostle or prophet evangelist the lord himself shall these sentiments with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words the bible exhort us to comfort one another that the lord himself the coming of the lord is upon us it's at hand praise god and we who are alive and remain praise god so it speaks about the dead being raised and it speaks about you who are alive and remain there's gonna be a bunch of people that's gonna be alive and remain praise god one will be taken one will be left oh glory to god two being a field one taken one left oh do we believe this is the word this morning we not killing time in church who want to kill time they're going to kill time but they're going to be a bunch of people that will believe the promise of the father they're going to believe what god has said oh glory to god and peter was exhorting them he come to stir up their minds to remember praise god the same god is not slack concerning his promise whatever god said he's promising he will bring it to pass praise god people are saying where is the promise of his coming oh glory to god the skeptics discovers praise god walking all the message walking all the anointing praise god walking away where is the promise that is coming oh glory to god you may be seated yeah let's go but abraham the coming of the lord is a mystery we don't know when he's coming or how he's coming but we know he is coming oh glory to god the community what a mystery we don't know when or how but he's coming and so was all the mysteries of god waiting for his last day after it's already been completed then he reveals and show what he has done so god wait till the seventh h till this last age to send a prophet that he could he could look back and see from all the ages what he has already done oh glory to god watch after it's already completed then he reveals and show what he done never give his mystery in full so all the brothers that went on before never got the full mystery you only give it in part through seven ages part of it part of it part of it everybody packing a part is only in the last days god sent a messenger to tie up all the parts do you see what you're getting to you see one coming to you not pat the bible said this way when that which is in part is when when that which is perfect is come then that which is part is done away with so god is requiring that which is perfect all seven parts all seven mysteries all seven thunders all glory to god has to line up praise god has to come back as the full token even the time message that we could leave here there's a bunch of people leaving here i am convinced of it oh praise the name never give his mystery in full then he says just like comparing the seven seals now when god used martin luther for the coming out of that church or that church age when he used john wesley he gradually brought him out and was revealing in them that church age revealing where so they were living out something that couldn't be explained hallelujah looter level justification where's the level of sanctification and they were actually living all the age that they were living in without knowing as a whole age their life was thundering and that was a mystery to the devil so the devil couldn't understand these beard drinking praise god justified men in luther's time but sanctification didn't come yet so while they clinging and glassing and drinking their beers they were justified by faith believing a word message from luther but then wesley came to bring a sanctification i say it cannot be no swagger cigarette smoking be a drinking believer you have to clean that up so then the message of sanctification turned into their souls and that got them sanctified because god was preparing them for the next step which was the holy ghost oh give the lord i shout god wasn't just bringing them out to justify them god wasn't just bringing them to sanctify them he was bringing them to clean them up that he could put his spirit inside of them so when the spirit fell it fell on a bunch of people to pentecostals speaking tongues and signs and wonders but there was no life because the word has not been restored it took a profit to get the full word to be restored and they rejected the prophetic message oh glory to god they perfected malachi 4. god said whole i sent you oh glory elijah the prophet when when before the territory of the lord so malachi 4 that elijah is the promise of his coming once you see elijah you know he is coming elijah is a guarantee oh glory to god he is coming oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he was ready on his way because the lord himself is with a shout he does three things when he coming down a shout a voice and a trump he has already started oh glory to god as a bride to be hewn out there's a pride to be harvested all glory that god harvest time is beautiful harvest time is a tremendous time when you put the seed in the ground and you see the corn pip out and you mold it you watch it grow you get the weeds away from it you see it getting mature and stronger then it put out a flower then i put other fruit you see a small little something come out but you know it had more to come and when it come into full fruition when it comes to maturity what a joy to come with the sickle okla what a joy to come with a sharp knife what a joy to reap the harvest and the husband man has been long waiting to reap the harvest of the earth and god himself as the husband man has been waiting a long time to harvest this pride or 1962 five planets lined up these are infant church oh glory to god at church in his infancy i think on thursday it had five or seven planets lined up i wonder what that represents or all these years is it a bride coming to maturity right here in july hot july sun coming into maturity the face praise god the challenges that lays ahead all glory look good hallelujah hallelujah so he was revealing in them that church could imagine god revealing in you the seventh seal oh glory to god silence was on the deer and something was living on the deer all glory to god there was silence in heaven not on earth silence in heaven for the space of half an hour but a message already getting to somebody because he said the secret is the word is in the bride so even though there was silence in heaven for half an hour the secret remains a supernatural element over the secret that's inside of you you can't explain it you struggle out here you stumble out to here you get out of here you get out of this trouble and this trouble and that trouble oh god you don't know how you got out but you got out god make you an escape one oh glory to god you escape the devil you escape all kind of funny cookie business you escape them you escape false pastors false shepherds fall preachers false teaching you escape that oh give the lord a praise you're not saying the lord delay is coming oh hallelujah we're not saying that there is no more delay oh hallelujah hallelujah glory my god watch when he was using wesley he was gradually brought them out and was revealing in them that church age one goes back to the bible now and find out but in the last days the reason that there was such a tremendous thing he spoke of and showed those seven thunders in luke and life magazine and packed that circle of cloud he said they surely seven thunders and look at night magazine and then that circle of cloud and light they couldn't understand but don't know don't know it yet but here telling go there and wait these mysteries to be revealed and once what happened just exactly the way he said it would do did you notice in that picture even the angel on the right when he was being materialized coming along with his wings back his head sitting sideways there it is right there in the picture just exactly months before it happened he's going to bring the body of believers together to reveal and take up them lost ends oh praise god so god is not in the loose ends business he does tie up his business hallelujah all the loose areas and stuff he sent a prophet to tie up all the loose ends and he's quoting i saw the right hand of him i said upon a throne a book written written and he's saying the writing was on the inside and on the back side sealed with seven seals he didn't say writing on the outside the writing was on the inside but on the back side sealed with seven seals and he's going deeper now the writing is on the inside of the book but the back side had seven seals on the back of it that was written well that wasn't written in the book now this is the revelator talking in the days of the voice of the seven names and all the mysteries that is written within should be finished hallelujah so brother branham as malachi 4 that elijah came to deal with the mysteries that was written within but the mighty angel the one with the straight black wings the one revelation 10 that had the book open seven thunders came out of his mouth and when he uttered like a land roar it and then seven thunders come up out of his mouth he came to deal with the seals on the back of the book oh glory to god the mighty angel himself the lord himself i saw a mighty angel come down from heaven with the book open all the time was book was sealed but now the book is open and the seals on the back of the book which are seven thunders which are seven voices oh glory to god that mighty angel he came to deal with that or give the lord some praises then whatever i'm saying he said no he himself not me he's interpreting revelation 10 7. revelation 10 7 says the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begin the song the mystery of god should be finished always wonder about that phrase as he created saving the prophets right so he's interpreting it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all this mystery that is written within should be finished in other words he's saying all the loose ends will be tied up then in the days of the voice and seventh danger all the losing will be tied up to make way for the next messenger which is the lord himself hallelujah hallelujah because god remember william branham came as elijah elijah made a river who messiah which was son of man jesus so john made a way for jesus he was told to make a way where he was tall in the bank ohio river 1933 as john the baptist was sent to for run the first covenant of christ you have a message that would run the second coming of christ and that message unfolded to a first pull she was second pulled and the turtle was to catch the bride so he started with healing ministry building up to come to the message to get to you all glory to god not with filler material but with the real deal the real thing oh glory to god because when you see the message you can't unsee it oh give the lord a shout when you really see the message you cannot unsee it [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so then when he referred to the perfect man he said this being this being you don't know this teaching this revelation he call it a being this being when it is completed is the servant of god in the church of god that is called in the rapture if it is not completed not going in the rapture you ever see two magnus i wish i had it here now according to where you put it push push it aside that is too negative or so but for the punch so if you have negative on this side negative inside and you do like that it does resist when you're switching the wrong negative positive it's just like that well that is what this has to do with the rapture when this is completely new and the magnet pass over you it's it [Applause] you have to go you have to connect you're not connecting because you're 100 years in the church that's not the connection this being when it's completed you're not connecting because you read all the books no just be disappearing when it's competing you're not connecting because you're listening to all the tips no there's being when it's completed hallelujah how are you written me now so brother brown let me say it again now in the days of the voice of the civilian show all this mystery that's written within should be finished it should be taken care of in that day do you see what i mean congratulations to email are you following me they say amen then now my words now then is the time for the seven voices of revelation 10 to be revealed when the book is finished there is only one thing left that's the seven mysterious voices of thunder that was wrote on the back side of the book that john was forbidden to write and then he said let me read it i saw another mighty angel coming from heaven crew with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his face as the sun his feet just fell as a fire he had his hand a little book open see and he had set his right foot upon the sea left on the earth and he cried with a lord voice as when the lion wrote and when he cried seven thunders out to the voices when the seven thunder uttered the voices i was about to write there was something said it wasn't a noise something was said he was about to write i heard a voice of heaven seen unto me look where the thunders was not in heaven on earth the thunders never uttered from heavens they uttered from the earth no one they say wait till them seven thunders utter the voices of that group so the sun is not saying in front of jesus mode the eternals have to come to a group of people that could take the word so all these years all go on to see if they could take the word you know whether your husband leave your wife leave your children leave you whether you're a sick bed when you're in a hospital whether you're tired whether you're wary whether this go this come don't want somebody like it they don't like you it doesn't matter he's testing to see he could take the word not just take the word but hand it there you have to be able to apply it you have to slice and cut you have to do something with that word oh glory to god you can't sit in it you have to chew on it praise god digest it and prophesy prophesy of deliverance so out of your mouth to be called supposed to be prophecy not negativity prophecy not not not negative stuff prophecy i'm going to be delivered i'm going to be changed oh glory to god hallelujah bullet woman you have to get that bullet spirit over you prophesy bullet spirit you have to go praise god i want to be a real genuine wife in the bible or give the lord some praises all of you are slack lazy husband you don't want that spirit your glory to god prophesy that slack lazy spirit have to go praise god because you don't want to be caught up in the spirit of laziness you can't make the rapture with laziness giving all diligence act to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and patience and goddess and brotherly kindness giving all diligence they have no laziness inside of there if you do these things you shall never fall he that lack of these things is blind can't see your fire off and forgotten he was once purged or give the lord some praises if you can't hallelujah god don't want to blind that laodicea he called you all to shine light we had to put your foot in this hour or them devil neck you have to walk on it you have to be a conqueror you have to be overcomer you have to begin to believe just what is being spoken to you this morning oh glory to god hallelujah there can't be a dishrag come on same and somebody there can't be a pushover same and somebody you have to get to this puppy every place you put your foot is yours [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god something the devil jumped on your wife your devil jump on your husband never jump on your children the devil didn't jump on peter at all and jesus rebuke him get behind me satan don't take the devil can't jump on this one and that one but we are more than conquerors and we have to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks oh glory to god oh thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i've got a voice of heaven saying seal up those things with the seventh and is uttered write them not it's on the backside when the book is completed not to say on the front side he said on the back side after it's all done completed then these seven thunder voices is the only thing that is stuck to the book that's not written in the book oh my i wish i could get that that the people could don't feel don't fail please don't disturb i'm fixing to leave you don't fail you ever listen listen but i'm talking to this church he said these seals are on the back side of the book and at the time that the seven is sung then all the missions that were written in the book is completed and immediately the book that was opened is written within is closed the mysteries of god is finished and this is the mysteries of god the queen of the church and these are the things the mysteries is over and when the seven angels sounds out every mysteries is over let him be whoever he may be god word can fail but in the days of the voice of the seven angel he quote in the scripture when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his sibling the prophets now those things wrong so he explained the mysteries in the book rome the all the protestant churches denomination denomination after her has become a heartless all those mysteries that the prophet spoke of will be revealed on this all when the seven angel rises in the loudest church age he begins to sound for the true trumpet because it will be contrary but will be inspired it will be an inspired prophet there's no way to figure it out oh my god hallelujah thank you jesus praise god so the scripture we read you talk about watch he said um and then if that evil servant shall say in his heart my law delete is coming no it's not an evil unbeliever it's evil servant saying saying in his heart my lord delays he's coming and begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunk now watch if you say the lord is coming you could party you could do whatever they want see that like when god tell abraham you have a son he didn't tell him when it was to be 25 years later so god didn't leave abraham to go and fool around for 24 years and then the 25th year he ran back in church boy hallelujah then we will never testimony or by faith abraham one two we never testimony stack another promise of god true and believe no he was boxing for 24 years and six months before the promise come ibra struggled back into church looking for promising manifesto it's a working show with god because your fate and your

you have to go through process he came unto his only only receiver not but as many as receive him to them he gave power to become and you could say how you are you know but you could take what the world declare and make yourself a christian yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i know some of you want some instant tablet christian tablet they don't have that you know take two pills and everything will be all right it's not working so you know every day is a fight you don't like it let me guess some more every day is a struggle it's a struggle praise god thing but isaac preaching it praise god hallelujah the in one man and the outward man the flesh man and the spirit man at war then stopping they're still fighting when you leave here is a battle could be going on there's a war this war has started heaven oh glory to god praise god in a battle and you have to fight praise god you know the coming of the lord as a battle also oh glory to god what battle the coming of the lord oh glory to god praise god and the skeptic want to know where is the promise of his coming when we are going to be witnesses of his coming because you are to be reflected in the uncommon sun oh glory to god your life will be a reflection of that perfection and your life reflected him mean he is coming oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hope we give the lord some praises hallelujah and you know over the years i've preached on this this part i'm going to now from the second coming of the lord about the lost coin and when barbara read that scripture which woman having these coins when lost one wouldn't seek glitch until she finds it and only a prophet could take a scripture like that and said this here have to do with the crime of the lord nobody else could do that you see coins and fine coins lost coin and he takes he said this is considered in the coming of the lord a husband was coming i endorse this didn't have a ring you'd have a coin on the wrong head a ban and every coin represents a certain vote you and so on what's your wife towards your husband or and if you're following adultery or whatever it is they will take it to the temple take out a coin that represented virtue or whatever it is when your husband come home and see in that condition he divorced you that is always in those times so the woman lost her coin she can't risk her husband coming home and she don't have a coin where supposed to be so she began to sweep she swept the floors she swept the cobwebs she saw the mat the problem said the neighbors could see the dust flying that's when you come to a place you don't care what the person next to you in front you think about you cleaning up your life about you repenting about you straighten up you have nothing to do with that you're not playing churchill you cleaning up because your husband coming he is coming he is coming he is coming and if he come and make your off key you know he's finished with you so she searched and searched and searched she swept the floors she swept the cub reps she lit a candle he said every cannon here ought to be lit tonight oh glory to god hallelujah i preaching it over and over over the years but something struck me this time like i never saw it that way before i'll never be gonna no he said she was defiled in any way it was seen by the people they brought her before the priests they brought witnesses she had been found such and such the priest seen her she was a mad woman took the coin out she had been doing wrong when her husband returned he found that she had been marked he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman he did not want such a woman it was getting dark she realized she had lost something time for husband to come it was getting late the church better be examining themselves by the word of god not by what other members do you must say it good not by what other members do that some people like to make that excuse he doing that she's doing that so i could do it too no what does the word say the church ought to be examining himself by the word of god our purity our loyalty our devotion we have become tactless tale bearers cigarette smokers backpackers paints of jezebels everything in the calendar that the rest of the world does the christian churches association in those things today they could hardly tell one from another it's time we took inventory it was getting late it was so late chatted like a candle she's got a candle so she went from daytime creating nighttime cleaning i like that kind of woman she started cleaning the time nobody's getting late night time she has been coming she has said oh god or daughter no no no no no was the time my husband coming back i don't know when he's coming he can come any hour he can come before morning so i might as well like the camera and keep on looking and seek and you shall find he that seeks shall find he that asks shall be given to him that knock it shall be open she was seeking until come on shout out until you have to seek until you want to break through don't stop now press on until your daughter rather backside now praise god until oh glory to god he's everybody said not only should the counter she got a broom and she went to sleep no brother if there ever was a need of a lighting of a candle descending forth of the gospel light the holy ghost back into the church not so much for emotion here we go not for some fantastics not for some emotional worker not for jump for joy but for a heart certain experience when men and women get right with god we are the end time she made a candle to give her light and brother every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that she got a broom and the neighbors could see the dust flying like when they're clean you know if you're proud and you don't want any neighbors to see those flying you could sweep it under the carpet you could push it slow you could practice in a bag and walk carefully to the dustbin but she wasn't bothered with no neighbors her burden was the coin and her husband coming in another was the coming of the lord that becomes the burden now you are supposed to be wife of the lamb you are supposed to be bride of jesus christ your husband is coming we are coming to church just to come to church our whole hopes and our own expectation is in the coming of the lord if he's not coming our belief he's in vain if he's not coming we waste 40 50 years we have not wasted we have not followed conor levine's fables oh glory to god we are fully persuaded that what he has promised he was able to perform and we have seen the promise of his coming we know he already said elijah elias has already come oh glory to god did you hear what i said before that day behold i sent you elijah last is already come oh glory to god hallelujah the promise of his coming has already come then what's left hallelujah the covenant of the capstone oh glory to god the coming of the headstone it's coming for our pride daniel saw it his eyes saw a stone cutted with all the hands of men that stone at a destination that's thrown at the knuckled man's kingdom because the kingdom of god was about to be established do you believe that let's continue here oh praise god she see the neighbors because he did us flying she had a real house clean in time her husband was about to come and she caught up her without one coin out she was a harlot brother we the church of the living god in this great art we're now living it behooves us a checkup go before god light the candle of the word and examine ourselves and find out if we are not falling short and especially when we see all these things coming we are the end time the coming of christ is at hand there's not one hope in the world for the church look the church is lolian this is a prophet speaking he's speaking by prophecy by vision by inspiration he's talking about the church and his condition after coronavirus some people can see them in church honey i wonder if they look in the service or they're doing something else right now or just hearing it when are they playing close attention all over the world when people fall off you know oh yes corner of it come like a filter it not only kill people physically you know they seem to have killed people spiritually too that not even goliath that not even does not even be a lion test there are viruses all over the world unbeliever make believer all different religions class creed country have you name it culture food whatever it's it all over the world and christians get conquered the church is lolian the church has no conscience no more you can hardly wake them up somebody should be praised to pray from lca london where people were seeing a scary scripture seeing they see nothing hearing they hear no that is scary the hearing and the hear that they're not hearing the seeing having not seen a blindness of deafness the hearing word they know is the truth but they they can't do nothing about it but the truth will be on could could people be lost eternal loss i don't know it's serious you know because the word that they heard israel wasn't mixed with faith and that got him into trouble very few was able to apply what they were hearing all were here in the gospel all was here in moses but all wasn't mixing what they were hearing with fate because faith is how you're going to approach this new season not feelings not emotions emotions is something else you know oh yes a song a feeling a atmosphere and you're caught up in it god gave man that to deal with things down here it's a good thing god give your imagination a little bit doesn't help you you might go crazy say i imagine you're getting over it imagine you're flying somewhere going somewhere god gave you a conscience memory affection reason all these things to deal with the atmosphere down here that is still not god yet but to talk to him to get to him had to go past that it's a sixth sense that's deal with him a sixth sense called faith and these lepers who said if you will stay here we'll dive in gossip real dead anywhere we die be moving so without food up too then we are starving at least we make your bread and their little dingy fate bomb says faith based on reasoning if we stay with that the calculation facility there which one which one boat is dead and they decide to move then i sit down here all these years are dying i ain't moving you will die you better move with the cloud you better move with the pillar of fire people love the church more than love god they love the church more than i love the word because when the word challenges you to operate and deal differently you have to accept that i became a brother of your sister you come to speak a separation praise god your husband can be a liar praise god your sister could be a liar it doesn't matter your mother brother doesn't matter any man word contrary to the word is a liar my word is true your sense is lying to you if you not agree with the word tell your senses sit down and shut up sometimes i tell them listen you want to see them say oh am i going to church praise god i ain't going with my feeling your feelings are still up there feeling you stay there everyone i go in the church i walk in my faith i come to church by faith i end up feeling good this morning but i just had to come to church this morning all of a sudden faith started to arise throwing your soul when i think back about my life when i think about all what god brought me out i said god is the future put him in his soul that keep me on the catholic church it's the fear to put him a soul that made me step out of this and step over that i step on the church and step on the group step up to all kind of stuff i walk out and leave them back because faith inside of they're moving oh glory to god every time i move it's bringing me closer to the word oh give the lord i shout not away from the word closer to the word that's why you're moving glory to god be moving this way today to bring us closer to him promise of his coming so watch the church has no conscience no more you could hardly wake them up the bible said they would come in that condition and they will say the law our lord delay is coming and this is the path somehow i i don't know how i never kind of picked this up in this way but then he said they will say lo our lord is coming and they will be devouring and biting one another fighting around just exactly at that hour so now i could see what led the prophet up to when the church finds his brotherly love because with brotherly love you can't fight your brother you forgive your brother all glory to god i know understand the revelation of the lord the latest coming brings a certain blindness upon those servants that doesn't see the right picture and they figure by cutting somebody down it puts them up this one not in a five-fold they have authority to do that who only fight for who not in the fight for who is this who is that who is there them and how people believe in that believe in that and god already to a prophet talk about not man picking five vo god has set in the church there's that man appointed you know people voting when god set god said when god wanted to say something goddess do something about it you know go on to place david as king he get samuel to go to the house of jesse and say anoint one of them and we know the stories that david was anointed praise god so when god ready to anoint you are gonna anoint you you're a god lock god next for the anointing god will come and anoint you the bride will be anointed you will be anointed praise god praise god you heard a message last last wednesday night nothing on the stop praise god the plan of god according to election god elected you this hour your father couldn't stop you your mother couldn't stop you from coming to this message you had to see it you must obstacle the terror put in your way to blind you from this message and yet to come to remember london yet you come to any hole you had to come true your name is on the book that's why you're here your name is on the book [Applause] [Music] glory glory to god and once you see it you can't see it the coming of the lord first testimony 4 16. so to say the lord then is coming is to also say i do not really believe first thessalonians 4 16. i don't believe the shout is on watch he said the jewish loss of light depending because there is also light the baptist laws are light every light seems to be gone he said the pentecost are people homeless acting like the methodist messengers i climbed the baptist baptizing the lutheran lutheran act like the catholic we are the end time that comes along she had a whole stream in time she scrubbed the floor she swept the wall she took down the cupboard she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now now if the churches don't recognize they lost something they're looking for nothing you know because they think they oh yeah before i'm saying no they think they have it they have the support of the people they think they are it right watch this part prophecy i don't care if you are methodist baptist pentecostal presbyterian come let us rejoice together and prophecy now when that time come speaks when that time when the church finds it's brotherly love so you mean it look as if it could be lost there there will be issues where bloody love is concerned some of you hope you get tired of me talking about this but people say what but you always know my brother i really love very love yeah i will stop music because that's a blood-free age and and here is bob fate is based on forgiveness so if you don't understand and see the picture of why it has to have brought in love and why you have to stop riling yourself up against your brother because sometimes you relevance heaven there and fight and battle they're helping you know that you're taking that you know what's going with him stop that cut that out don't want bad for your brother don't want how they sit um where so ever reap don't go that route you're paying for your sins don't go that route who are you paying for yours don't go there because you like you or you prophesy you're looking for a waiting of the past they will reap what you show and you're looking for them to read and when god said that bless them so you recognize your word it's just that you own your word dino god would you speak because i have mercy upon whom i have mercy don't get me started right now i'll have mercy upon whom i have mercy you you can't tell god to have mercy upon this one and that one i don't care what they have done god have a right to do that the thief on the cross that's the lord remember me i don't care what you see if you can see the fridge the stove he's very steep that come inside your own house are you washing our old teeth is it good for you could they get you you're paying for your deeds okay missing a fridge i can't get the cold water you sell it and imagine it remember me and you and your foolishness still was your odds you just said yeah say father forgive them don't know what you're doing they're killing them and they will forgive them you know what we're doing and this steve said remember me and she said today you'll be with me you know [Applause] them pharisees and sadducees are sure where they going you know but but jesus tell that cinnamon no in the church never get baptized never see what the bible looked like oh it's called like but you never hear a script in his ears never will without prayer he said lord remember me he said the day he will be with me [Applause] god will have mercy upon oh god have mercy if this don't make you shout this morning and give god a shout of praise that you know what will so guaca bring you oh god bless you all god could fight you seek you out glory hallelujah hallelujah what joseph brothers did to him was a real piece of wickedness you know julian was very young when you were sold out you know how old he was when i was about 17 around 17 years

spirit from we don't hear just daily justification sound vacation back in the holy spirit and now right into the time of the coming of the headstone the church prophecy has got to be so perfectly like christ until christ and the church can unite together the same spirit and if the spirit of christ is in you it makes you live the life of christ act the life of christ do the works of christ see heather believe it on me the works that i do shall we do also jesus said that now are you ready are you ready for this prophecy now we are going to have we got a ministry coming in [Music] try to share that with the ministers some of them don't want to bother with that they think they have it already they got it they got it they got it again they don't believe it but they got to take it he's prophesying here we have a ministry coming that's just exactly like the life of christ that's not brother over ministry done about the team ministry then he says what does that ministry identify the coming of the lord so this ministry prophesied when that comes on the scene that ministry will identify the coming of the lord and the covenant of the lord is in three parts shout out voice trump brother branham identify the shout the shoutback of his coming will the bride identify the voice [Music] the voice part of his coming hallelujah praise be to me let me hit the home stretch here brother branham now this is where i'm going to clarify this shout to you by his own words from the rapture to message the word rapture the bible is not even used at all we just put up that word here the bible said caught up being caught up we read here i read second thessalonians what we read for cesarean for i want you to notice a great thing taking place here the words say in second thessalonians three things to happen before the lord himself appears quickly now for the lord himself sent from heaven with a shout with the voice of angela trump he said three things happen a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before jesus appears now a shout out jesus does all three of them when he is descending what why is he sending he [Music] jesus doing all three yes a shout out what is the shout out it's the message going forward so you see where the shout is right you have it on books and tips that message going forth right the living bread of life bringing forth the bride is the unchanging god he promised it and according to malachi 4 they return again a prophet in the land the first thing come and he starts his you mean the lord will be ascending it already started when you plant a corn you're getting a full air already started you know when the first rain fall and push out the little stock up you on your way to harvest you know it's only a matter of time it grow mature leaves and so on and put out the little fine kind of gold looking here and then the corns that have formed there you can't pick it yet because it's still curly it's still golden afterwards the sun starts to beat it and when i get dry ice a plant called nps you know so i ain't talking from book you know i'm talking from realizing moldy corn moldy peas i love to see corn grow it was a joy to pick it as a joy when you hold it and crack that so sometimes a little thing you know you put a bite in it and all you're waiting for to cook you put a bite in a young corn anything like that you taste so good that is harvest you're talking about oh glory to god so once that seed go down that's why god said my word shall be delivered when god drop a seed he could turn his back and walk you know [Music] god drop a seed in you and just turn it back and walk and you're going to your own piece of hell but he know that word cannot return void that word will bring forth after its kind that word glory the secret is the word is in the bread or the seed is in the bread oh the pyramid is in the bride that's the secret [Applause] the first thing when he starts he sent from heaven with a shout what is it a message to get the people together to get what what seven thunders does gather the bright together so when the lord himself is sending russian ten what do you what all commanders mode seven thunders the tower they shout to counter the bride together so the seven thunders is the bright message we can't get it wrong and undock it and hide it and go say it we're shouting out to the rooftop oh glory to god i ain't saying it because somebody else said i'm saying because this is the prophecy for the bride exclusive bright promise the church remember to take whatever they want but this is for the bride oh glory to god is the message to get the people together a message comes forward first lamb trimming time rise and trim your lamps hallelujah behold the bridegroom comet some of them didn't have oil in their lamp but it's lamb trimming kind first thing is a trumpet a voice a shout then a voice then a trumpet shout he's going on deeper a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice and lord voice saint john 11 that call lazarus from the grave that voice will be in the bride that's why your your family will be delivered because when jesus called for lazarus lionel can say i have him to come i have feeling led no no when that voice is lazarus lazarus had no choice when that voice had to thunder oh glory to god you're backstage children loved ones whoever it is when that voice had a quote to them like that they come in they come in they come in they come in they come in come on give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god praise god hallelujah no longer praying i've been praying for a while concerning backstage coming back and one by one i see them coming back one by one by one i can't say a whole ton come back but one by one by one because it's a prophecy it's a sign oh glory to god they have to come back because they are sons and daughters of god and when the evil shadows begin to fall the prophet had a vision he said it will come back to get bread oh glory to god they're going out but they're coming back when the evening shadows begin to fall hey hey hallelujah famine all over the land for the hearing of the true word of god oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the third thing is the trumpet and that's the feast of the trumpets that will be the bright supper the lambs suffer with the bride in the sky the first thing comes from it is message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride oh glory the ones that died so the first thing a message seven thunders gather the right together next sleep in scenes and the bible talk about the arose and appear to many is that the bible you've been some of them who sleep and going on from here going to appear to others to let them know the time is at hand you will recognize this one and recognize that one and don't recognize that one oh glory to god hallelujah in the theophany hallelujah praise god oh glory to god then you reckon another time there's a hand they're not appearing to any anybody you know their parents are those who go in oh glory to god they hear what i said they will appear to those who are about to leave oh glory to god hallelujah and all of that together your face has to rise now you know there's a land beyond the river there's a curtain next year there's a failure to break through praise god praise god it is earthy to be dissolved we have another building waiting oh glory to god that never be mentioned it's right here a little faster than this one oh glory to god i didn't mention a little here [Applause] glory glory jesus was passing through walls anything you know before he was glorified

in the heavens in the sky we are right here ready now the only thing the only thing are you ready the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen oh you mean we can't go green no you say your faith has to be ripe then you have to lay into presence right and fit oh glory not teaching presence oh my my god we can't forgive and not forget i could forgive you but i always remember that you done those evil things then you're forgiven but in the sight of god in the sight of the pride is justified she never done it in the first place standing there married to the virtuous son of god never seen in the first place why she was for ordained she was trapped into this and when she heard the truth and comfort the blood cleanser and she stands virtuous there is no sin on her at all no sin on her at all oh give the lord some praises blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah i'm almost done here now watch in the last days of malachi 4 elijah is to come with the very word

back forth and fought message of life i will restore justification brought back the pulp sand vacation brought back the back doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaf pentecostals clap your hand and rejoice in so if the messenger clap and rejoicing did not even depend because atmosphere yourself you need all you need justification you need sanctification you need a clapping of the lead and a clapping of the hand you need the holy ghost what was the fault the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that christ has finally here we go after justification being planted some vacation being planted baptism holy ghost organization died out and christ has centered himself like the cap of the pyramid what is it the holy ghost bunch being honed out so it can

praise is from brother barry o'brien uh speaking of sister elysia he is feeling a lot better today and thanking god for his love so we're really truly happy to hear that and we'll continue to remember her in prayer also and another note of praise uh this is from sister suzanne dunda good morning and god bless saints i want to thank the lord for placing me back in the house of the lord after being out of church for 12 years it was not an easy road to walk things was very tough but god kept me through every trial that came my way and there were times when i wanted to give up because my life wasn't a mess and i've tried so many times but nothing was working out and there's one are deciding i need my blessing so i decided to take back of the lord where i had left him it's not such a powerful statement didn't the prophet teach us god never leaves us but we are the ones who leave him and if you want to pick up the pieces you need to go right back to where you left him and i was all desperate and happy finding back the lord so now she's speaking about now what is the experience coming back into fellowship but the devil did not like that so he decided to place a very tough trial on me by letting my daughter leave home and from that d she left my life felt empty and i was not at rest and i was in tears every day but after but i said preach that message last sunday it's not the same with me anymore no more tears again i'm at rest now that message but isaac peace was for me thank you brother isaac for that message i can never be the same and may god richly bless you and your family just want to thank brother ovid for the stand he has made throughout the years of hard labor in this ministry and thanks all the scenes with their prayers god bless you all richly sister susan so that's such a tremendous encouragement and a blessing and a great position that you could be at rest on the promise of god considering your house and your family amen amenity going to play something for prayer requests we have two prayer requests uh today from uh brother kelly south uh in the us he and his wife they're struggling through the covet 19 virus if you want to remember them in prayer and we also want to remember and pray our precious pastor riemann thompson in south africa brother luke son who has ministered so tremendously sent a message to us yesterday greetings servants of god please keep our past in your prayers he went to see the doctor in the week for an overall checkup and he's not doing too well and has to take time off he has lost weight no appetite

him brother kelly salt and his wife there in the us and anyone else in here this morning we want to keep remembering this is the elysee o'brien in prayer for complete and total healing and a restoration of every thing that has to be remedied by the great physician we want to remember sister margot in prayer and so many requests that have not been written or articulated but we hold in our hearts this morning by the grace of god and so shall we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we thank you for the words of promises law that you have given to us lord not just

messenger and how many lord were healed and delivered and saved under that great ministry and even now lord we read notes of praises almost every service lord and lord and there's so many i know that are have notes or praises that they have not even written because just to be in the house of god is worthy of a note of praise just to be able to lift our hands and to be here to be identified with lord those that have seen their names that in and of itself is a note of praise lord even after you gave your disciples power you said don't rejoice because you have power but rejoice oh because your names are written so father we all have a reason this morning to praise you and to thank you because you called us you chose us you wrote our names in blood father and you made a promise lord when we

great purpose lord that you have written about us we thank you for the promises that are applied to us we thank you lord for the faith that we are mixing with the word of to see this thing come to flesh into a reality so if heavenly father we want to pray lord for brother kelly sultan his wife lord that even now the angel of the lord would move into that home father lord uncover that family with your blood by your stripes lord they are healed today lord may they have a complete recovery in the mighty name of jesus may all be well fathered lord we pray for our sister margo father that the

to perform a healing miracle upon her lord there's power in the church of the living god over every sickness every disease every attack of the enemy and as the bride comes into a full realization of who she is the authority of the church would increased father lord he said how could we have faith for a rapture if we can't even have faith for divine healing so father we look for a miracle today in the mighty name of jesus christ even now mediation of the lord walk into her room and may you touch her from the crown of her head to the soles of our feet father mean his request turn around as a note of praise up for your honor and for your glory lord we are here to lift the name of jesus higher lift him up for the world to see oh father god we pray for a continued healing of sister elysium

name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated for a few announcements so our first this will be a major announcement is that due to a number of factors the convention for july we will be adjusting the dates of the convention and due to a number of factors as well it will be primarily a virtual convention so officially the dates of this year's convention will be july 28th to the 31st july 28th 29th 30th and 31st and it'll be a primarily virtual convention so remain in prayer remain under great expectation as we still navigate a number of factors towards the teal end of this pandemic and what god wants to do for us i truly believe in my heart we don't have too much time left and i believe that we have to do everything we can do while we could do it as we redeem the time we see the world falling apart we see what's happening in the medical realm and we see what's happening in all these things that are happening politically and economically and just stacking you know layers of what has been prophesied both in scripture as well as our prophet's message you don't need much to know the end is upon us people who i know don't even know about church saying the end is upon us so much more we who have been given insight and to reveal word of our god so be in prayer be in consecration not just for the convention but there are many people who are struggling as broadband was preaching about this this pandemic took all people in different ways people have lost zeal and lost joy and allowed the stresses of life to affect them in so many ways and as we preached both today last wednesday last sunday but getting into that place of rest and resting on god's word we really want to begin to continue to stay in the spirit as we progress throughout whatever time god has for us before this world is burned with the food and heat you know it makes you question so many things we do for the natural and for the physical when that is just temporary and it would not last and only what you do in the spiritual economy of god is what will last what you do for the kingdom of god that will last what you do for the people of god will last what you do for him is what will last so be on the great expectation be in prayer for the ministers for the virtual convention and it's a great responsibility on the technical team um here the tabernacle and those around the world who will be part of making this a possibility remember them in prayer as well in addition uh there will be a fundraising activity on july 10th uh just putting you
