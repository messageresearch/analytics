[20:37] Hallelujah.
[20:39] Glory to his precious name this morning.
[20:42] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[20:45] Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[20:48] let's just turn to Psalms 34.
[20:54] Reading from verses 1-9
[20:56] [Music]
[21:01] from Psalm 34, it says, "I will bless
[21:02] the Lord at all times. His praise shall
[21:06] continually be in my mouth. My soul
[21:09] shall make a boast in the Lord. The
[21:11] humble shall hear thereof and be glad."
[21:14] Oh, magnify the Lord with me. And let us
[21:17] exalt his name together. I sought the
[21:20] Lord and he heard me and delivered me
[21:23] from all of my fears.
[21:25] They look unto him and were lightened
[21:27] and their faces were not ashamed.
[21:30] The poor man cried and the Lord heard
[21:34] him and save him from out of all his
[21:38] troubles. The angel of the Lord encamped
[21:41] around those
[21:43] that fear him and deliver them. Oh,
[21:47] taste and see that the Lord is good.
[21:49] Blessed is the man that trusts in him.
[21:54] Amen.
[21:55] Let's just bow heads for the prayer.
[22:00] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[22:02] grace. We thank you for your mercy. We
[22:04] thank you Lord for guarding us together
[22:06] Lord Father in the spot of ground to
[22:08] give you worship, to give you praise, to
[22:10] give you glory, and to give you honor.
[22:12] Lord, bless this time of worship. Bless
[22:15] this time of praise. Be with us. Have
[22:18] your perfect way in the service. In the
[22:20] precious name of Jesus Christ, I pray.
[22:23] Amen.
[22:25] And sing that song. Be magnified, oh
[22:26] Lord. Amen.

[24:24] And I have believed
[24:27] in a lie
[24:31] that you were unable
[24:35] to help me.

[44:45] God bless you. Appreciate Jason.
[44:49] [Music]
[44:53] You know as brother Isaac said that when
[44:56] somebody have their storm they could
[44:58] talk about that storm. When you have
[45:01] your storm is what you're going to say
[45:03] is what you're going to do is what going
[45:05] to act. And I tell my wife I said there
[45:08] has to be a reason why Jesus would watch
[45:11] them in a storm and say be a good child.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? you are doing
[45:16] opposite to what the devil want you to
[45:18] do.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Disaster, stress, uh uh all kind of
[45:22] things that going off key. It's supposed
[45:24] to make you weak, supposed to make you
[45:26] bowed, supposed to make you cower and
[45:28] and so on like that. And here it is.
[45:30] Jesus said, "Be a good chair.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; It is high. Be not afraid." What that
[45:36] shows is a demonstration of faith that
[45:39] you believe he could work this thing out
[45:42] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the storm
[45:44] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the trial.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; In the midst of your mind backwards, in
[45:48] the midst of what you're going through
[45:49] right now, he could work things out for
[45:52] his honor and his glory. Sometime we
[45:54] don't know. We don't know how we're
[45:56] going to work out, but we trust him.
[45:59] Hallelujah. He we we trust him that he
[46:01] going to make a way. Hallelujah. He
[46:04] going to provide. He going to open up
[46:05] doors. That's what we are here for to
[46:09] see him make that way. Oh, God bless
[46:11] you. So this morning we have uh but
[46:14] Anthony will speak up be speaking the
[46:15] word for us this morning. Appreciate
[46:17] him. Praise God. And I want to just read
[46:21] back this for for you. Amen. From what
[46:24] we read in prayer meeting, this one
[46:25] verse uh uh from Exodus 4 rather. It
[46:28] says, "And Moses took his wife and sons
[46:30] and set upon us and he returned to the
[46:31] land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of
[46:34] God in his hand.
[46:36] And the Lord said unto Moses, "When thou
[46:38] goest to return unto Egypt, see that
[46:41] thou do all those wonders before
[46:44] Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand,
[46:47] and I will harden his heart, that he
[46:49] shall not let the people go." And thou
[46:52] shalt say unto Pharaoh, thus sayeth the
[46:55] Lord, Israel is my son. So God is
[47:00] telling Moses specific words
[47:02] &gt;&gt; to say to Pharaoh.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; He's putting Israel in context.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Israel is my son, even my
[47:10] firstborn, and I say unto thee, let my
[47:13] son go,
[47:14] &gt;&gt; that he may serve me."
[47:16] &gt;&gt; And if thou refuse to let him go,
[47:18] behold, I will slay thy son, even thy
[47:22] firstborn.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; So that is where every firstborn in Eve
[47:25] shall die.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; That don't come under the blood. The
[47:28] blood was the requirement
[47:30] &gt;&gt; to be safe and to secure.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; So God make it known in no uncertain
[47:34] terms
[47:35] &gt;&gt; that Israel is my son.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know this morning, you
[47:38] are his son.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; You are his daughter.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; And God want you to be let go.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; God want you free.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; God want you delivered.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; God want you delivered and free to serve
[47:49] him.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Not to be a better how how do you say it
[47:53] now? A better you and a better me and a
[47:56] better version of yourself. of what kind
[47:57] of foolishness not that
[47:59] &gt;&gt; the call out of Egypt is that he might
[48:01] serve me.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; So in other words in Egypt you can't
[48:04] really correctly serve God as you ought
[48:06] to
[48:07] &gt;&gt; in bondage you can't serve God as you
[48:09] ought to. So God want you out of
[48:11] bondage.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; God want you out of Egypt. God out out
[48:14] of what you're in. Isn't that something
[48:16] this morning? Isn't that right? But
[48:18] Abraham said here he says now Pharaoh
[48:20] double italia bricks because he put
[48:22] pressure on them. He was completely
[48:23] Moses was completed in the hands of God.
[48:25] But the people wasn't delivered because
[48:27] they were still murmuring. And one night
[48:29] when God ordained the lamb would be
[48:31] killed, a type of Christ, the blood was
[48:33] dipped in his weeds, common weeds. And
[48:36] Israel became completely delivered with
[48:39] not a hope left behind. All that
[48:42] belonged to them was delivered. Now you
[48:44] see how I'm reading this. You have to
[48:45] see yourself. You have to see your
[48:47] family. You have to see all that belong
[48:49] to you delivered. You have to ride with
[48:51] the word. You have to ride with what
[48:53] God's saying to you because God is
[48:55] speaking to you by the word. So he said
[48:57] their families, their loved ones,
[48:58] everything was delivered when they
[49:00] completely come under the blood. Then he
[49:02] said this, that's when the church shall
[49:04] be completely delivered. When everything
[49:06] comes under the blood, when your sins
[49:08] come under the blood, when you're
[49:10] smoking, when you're gambling, when
[49:11] you're cheating, when you're stealing,
[49:12] when you're lying, when everything is
[49:14] brought under the blood, there'll be a
[49:16] total deliverance. If you have wronged
[49:18] somebody, make it right. You can't bring
[49:20] that under the blood. It won't stay. You
[49:23] can't bring it. Something won't let you
[49:24] do it. And when yourself is completely,
[49:27] totally brought under the blood,
[49:30] there'll be a total deliverance. There
[49:32] will be a freedom like you never known
[49:35] before. When everything is brought under
[49:37] the blood, brought in submissive to the
[49:41] kingdom of God, then there's real
[49:43] deliverance. So, we have a choice just
[49:45] like Adam had, just like Eve had. We
[49:47] have a choice to do right, to do wrong.
[49:49] To take of the tree of life or the tree
[49:50] of evil and and good and knowledge of
[49:52] good and evil. And if you notice
[49:53] everything man has is is have a good
[49:55] part and a bad part. The tablets the
[49:57] this that anything might make it have
[49:59] good part and bad part because it's a
[50:01] knowledge of good and evil and manlong
[50:03] with that. But we are called to a higher
[50:05] kingdom. We are called to a higher
[50:06] order. This is not the only world. You
[50:09] could live your life a normal life,
[50:11] ordinary life with nothing, no care in
[50:13] this world. But there's a program of God
[50:15] that is on his way that no man could
[50:18] stop. Oh, praise God. There's a
[50:20] deliverance coming that no man can stop.
[50:22] You have to want that deliverance. You
[50:24] have to want that breakthrough. You have
[50:26] to want that victory. You have to want
[50:28] it. You have to desire it. If any man
[50:30] thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[50:32] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[50:34] Hallelujah. He say, "If any man want to
[50:36] drink, he if any man thirst, he want you
[50:38] to be hungering for God, thirsting for
[50:41] God." That's why you come here for this
[50:42] this morning. You're coming for a
[50:44] breakthrough. You're coming for a
[50:45] reality. You're coming for something to
[50:47] speak to you. God could use anyone. Give
[50:50] the Lord some praises. God could use
[50:51] anything. God could use a song. God
[50:54] could use a poem. Is the Lord a shout.
[50:56] God could use a preacher. God could use
[50:58] anybody to bless you this morning. Oh,
[51:00] give the Lord some praise. Let's all
[51:02] stand and give God a shout in the house.
[51:05] Hallelujah.
[51:06] [Music]
[51:08] Hallelujah.
[51:10] Where he leads
[51:14] me I
[51:17] would follow.
[51:20] Hallelujah.
[51:22] Where he leads
[51:25] me I
[51:29] would follow my Lord. My Lord where he
[51:34] leads
[51:36] me. I
[51:39] could follow.
[51:41] [Music]
[51:43] I'll go with him.
[51:47] With him
[51:50] all
[51:52] the way.
[51:54] God bless his brother until he comes.
[51:55] Where he leads me when
[51:59] Thank you.

[52:05] [Music]
[52:07] Oh hallelujah. Where he leads
[52:11] me, I
[52:14] will follow.
[52:16] Where he leads me. Oh.
[52:22] [Music]
[52:30] I'll go with
[52:34] with him

[52:42] I'll go with him. I'll go with him
[52:47] through
[52:49] the judgment.
[52:53] Oh,

[52:58] through the judgments.
[53:03] [Music]
[53:04] Oh, I'll go with him
[53:08] through
[53:11] the judgment.
[53:14] Oh,

[53:22] Oh,

[54:17] Let us praise him this morning.
[54:20] for his goodness
[54:22] and his mercy.
[54:24] Oh, for his faithfulness
[54:27] and for his love.
[54:30] Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus.

[54:51] our trust in him. How many appreciate
[54:53] the Lord today?
[54:56] How many truly thank God to be in his
[54:58] presence

[56:17] Amen. Just one second here. All right.
[56:22] All right. Praise. Praise God. Okay. So,
[56:25] sorry about that. St. Mark chapter 4, we
[56:28] want to read from in the New Testament.
[56:30] St. Mark chapter 4 and we want to read
[56:33] from verse 35 for scripture reading this
[56:37] morning. Amen.
[56:45] reading from the book of Mark chapter 5
[56:49] and
[56:50] Mark chapter 5 and verse 35. Yeah.
[56:56] Yeah. Mark chapter 5 and verse 35. And
[56:59] it says, "While he yet spake,
[57:02] there came from the ruler of the
[57:04] synagogue's house certain which said,
[57:08] thy daughter is dead. Why troublestest
[57:11] thou me?
[57:13] Uh, sorry, why troublest thou the master
[57:15] any further? Just talking about Gyrus,
[57:17] right?
[57:19] So Jesus is on his way to heal Gyrus's
[57:22] daughter. And they receive some terrible
[57:25] news
[57:27] uh from one of his servants, saying,
[57:28] "Thy daughter is dead. Why troublest
[57:31] thou the master any further?" And as
[57:34] soon as Jesus heard
[57:36] uh the word that was spoken, he saith
[57:39] unto the ruler of the synagogue, "Be not
[57:42] afraid,
[57:44] only believe."
[57:46] And he suffered no man to follow him
[57:48] from that point, save Peter and James,
[57:51] and John the brother of James. And he
[57:55] cometh to the house of the ruler of the
[57:57] synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and
[58:00] them that weep, and wailed greatly.
[58:04] And when he was come in, he saith unto
[58:07] them, Why make ye this ado, and weep,
[58:11] the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; And they laughed him to scorn. But when
[58:18] he had put them all out, he taketh the
[58:22] father and the mother of the damsel, and
[58:24] them that were with him, and enterth in
[58:27] where the damsel was lying. And he took
[58:31] the damsel by the hand, and sth unto
[58:34] her, Talithumi,
[58:36] which is being interpreted, damsel, I
[58:39] say unto thee, arise.
[58:43] And straight away the damsel arose, and
[58:46] walked. for she was of the age of 12
[58:50] years. And they were astonished with a
[58:53] great astonishment.
[58:56] And he charged them straightly that no
[58:58] man should know it and commanded that
[59:01] something should be given her to eat.
[59:04] And God add blessing to the reading of
[59:06] his word. Let us bow our hands. Almighty
[59:10] God, we are grateful to you this morning
[59:12] for all things. Lord, you give us life
[59:16] and life eternally. Dear God, we are
[59:18] thankful to you this morning for all
[59:21] that you've done for us, Lord Jesus. And
[59:23] Lord, now we come into this house of
[59:26] praise and worship and the word and
[59:28] correction. Father, we pray that you
[59:30] would speak to our hearts this morning.
[59:32] Take me out of the way, Lord. Lord, this
[59:35] thought that you have put upon my heart
[59:36] to share with your people. I pray that
[59:39] you would come and breathe life into
[59:40] your own word this morning, dear God.
[59:42] For no one else can touch us like you
[59:44] can. No one else can speak to our hearts
[59:47] like you can and make the word real this
[59:50] morning as a living fire, Lord. Lord,
[59:53] that we could be inspired to move toward
[59:55] the direction of your grace, Lord. Grant
[59:58] it, almighty God, we pray your presence
[59:59] come down in a special way this morning
[1:00:01] as we preach and as we talk about you,
[1:00:03] Lord. Father, may you draw near to us
[1:00:05] and help us and minister to us along the
[1:00:07] way as we need as we draw strength from
[1:00:10] you this morning, Lord, for the journey
[1:00:12] that lays ahead for us. Granted,
[1:00:14] almighty God, bless the word now. Bless
[1:00:16] this portion of the service. May you
[1:00:18] bless your people mightily in Jesus
[1:00:20] name.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] We're happy to be in the house of the
[1:00:35] Lord this morning
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; where there's praise, honor, and glory.
[1:00:40] Amen. And we'd like to take a title for
[1:00:42] this morning's message.
[1:00:45] She is not dead. She is only sleeping.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's the title I have this morning.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; She is not dead.
[1:00:55] She is only sleeping.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; There's a particular story that inspired
[1:01:01] me recently. I was listening to a
[1:01:04] lecturer or educator by the name of Sir
[1:01:08] Ken Robinson
[1:01:09] and he shared a little thought that I
[1:01:11] thought was quite interesting and he was
[1:01:13] talking about something called Death
[1:01:15] Valley. Death Valley's hidden bloom.
[1:01:19] Uh and he was talking about Death
[1:01:20] Valley. It's actually a place a real
[1:01:22] place. It's a desert valley in a place
[1:01:25] called California and Nevada in the
[1:01:28] desert. and it is known for its extreme
[1:01:32] temperatures and low elevation.
[1:01:35] It's part of what they call the Death
[1:01:37] Valley National Park. It's the largest
[1:01:40] national park in the cont uh contiguous
[1:01:44] United States and it holds the record
[1:01:47] for the lowest hottest and driest
[1:01:50] conditions in North America. It is the
[1:01:54] driest place in North America. It
[1:01:57] doesn't get more dry than Death Valley.
[1:02:00] Nothing grows there.
[1:02:03] If you want to plant peas, if you want
[1:02:05] to plant chive, if you want to plant
[1:02:07] tomatoes, you don't go to Death Valley
[1:02:10] cuz it will die.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; It's Death Valley.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Nothing grows there. There's no
[1:02:17] encouragement there. Nothing grows there
[1:02:20] because it doesn't rain, hence the name
[1:02:22] Death Valley. But apparently in the
[1:02:24] winter of 2004
[1:02:27] it rained.
[1:02:29] A phenomenon actually happened where it
[1:02:31] actually rained after years of this
[1:02:34] never being an occurrence. Right? It
[1:02:37] rained 7 ines of rain in Death Valley in
[1:02:39] the winter of that year. And in the
[1:02:42] spring of 2005, the following year, a
[1:02:45] remarkable thing happened.
[1:02:48] The floor of Death Valley was actually
[1:02:50] covered in flowers.
[1:02:53] Hallelujah.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It only lasted for a little while. But
[1:02:56] what it proved was that dead death
[1:02:59] valley is not dead.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; It's just laying dormant.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's just laying in a state of slumber.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; It's just laying in a state of sleep,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; in a state of rest. and laying below the
[1:03:16] surface of the earth were seeds of
[1:03:19] possibilities,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; waiting for the right conditions
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; to come about.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And once the right conditions were met,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; it had to bring forth life. And a desert
[1:03:33] that was once dead
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; with no signs of life,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; home to snakes and rattlesnakes and
[1:03:40] cactus, came to life and brought forth
[1:03:44] flowers.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And it just goes to show that dead is
[1:03:49] not dead.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; It's only sleeping. And it doesn't
[1:03:53] matter how dead you feel this morning
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; or what is troubling your mind or what
[1:03:58] you've been going through seemingly for
[1:04:01] a long time.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe those conditions are dry this
[1:04:05] morning. Maybe you don't feel anything.
[1:04:08] But I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:04:10] that that that that there is a promise
[1:04:13] that there is a possibility
[1:04:16] that maybe you can't see with your
[1:04:18] natural eyes. But laying below the
[1:04:21] surface of what you can feel this
[1:04:24] morning is something that is more real
[1:04:27] than what you can see with your eyes.
[1:04:30] Laying below the surface this morning
[1:04:33] are seeds of possibility.
[1:04:36] Seeds of deliverance,
[1:04:39] seeds of restoration,
[1:04:41] seeds of power, seeds of hallelujah, of
[1:04:45] the Holy Ghost, of dynamics, of you
[1:04:48] being healed, of you being delivered, of
[1:04:51] you being restored, of you being
[1:04:53] baptized. There are seeds this morning.
[1:04:56] That seed was always there just waiting
[1:04:59] for the right conditions, waiting for
[1:05:02] the right environment. And this morning
[1:05:05] we are in the right atmosphere. This
[1:05:08] morning we are in the right environment
[1:05:12] for those seeds that God puts in your
[1:05:17] soul to come forth with new life this
[1:05:21] morning. God is ready. After years of
[1:05:25] dormcancy, after years of sleep, after
[1:05:29] years of slumber, after years of
[1:05:32] silence, I believe in 2025,
[1:05:37] God is getting ready to pour life into
[1:05:40] those seeds this morning. Those seeds
[1:05:43] are in your heart. Seeds that you've
[1:05:46] been praying about, that nobody knows
[1:05:49] about. Those seeds are in there. And the
[1:05:53] devil try to make you feel dry. The
[1:05:56] devil try to make you feel weary. The
[1:05:58] devil try to make you feel like it would
[1:06:01] never happen for you. But I'm here to
[1:06:04] tell you tonight that the devil is a
[1:06:06] liar. God is here this morning and he's
[1:06:10] here to bring you to life.
[1:06:13] Every seed is going to bring forth after
[1:06:16] its kind.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Can I get amen?
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:21] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:24] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Doesn't matter
[1:06:27] the situation. Doesn't matter the
[1:06:29] circumstance. Doesn't matter how dead
[1:06:32] you feel, how dead your prayer life
[1:06:34] feels, how dead your family feels, how
[1:06:37] dead your atmosphere feels, your home,
[1:06:39] it feels like there's no hope. It feels
[1:06:42] like the devil's got it all. But I'm
[1:06:44] here to tell you tonight that there is a
[1:06:47] man in here who could turn on the
[1:06:50] lights. Oh, and he's turning on the
[1:06:53] light this morning
[1:06:57] that you could see a possibility
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; with your spiritual eyes.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:09] There is a possibility this morning
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; There is a possibility this morning
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; for your wife, for your husband, for
[1:07:20] your son, your daughter, your your
[1:07:23] family situation, your finances, your
[1:07:26] business, your career. Don't matter what
[1:07:29] it is, there is a possibility this
[1:07:32] morning because there's a hope that
[1:07:35] exists outside of what you can see right
[1:07:37] now. that is more real than this one.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; There's a world a whole world happening
[1:07:44] outside of your world
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; that is more real than this one
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; that is influencing this world right now
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; doesn't just because you can't see it
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean it's not there.
[1:07:57] God sent us a prophet
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; in the end time to give us evidence
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; of this Holy Ghost land of promises of
[1:08:05] this supernatural land that we are to
[1:08:08] possess
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; of healing the sick of raising the dead
[1:08:12] of casting out devils. His whole life
[1:08:15] was representation of that new land that
[1:08:18] we are going to possess. That one day we
[1:08:21] are going to live in that atmosphere
[1:08:23] every single day. Until healing becomes
[1:08:27] normal. Until miracles become normal.
[1:08:30] Until missing limbs being restored
[1:08:32] become normal. Until we speak organs
[1:08:35] into existence, hands begin to grow back
[1:08:38] house. People begin to release.
[1:08:40] Hallelujah. from prison and from
[1:08:42] supernatural chains because we were
[1:08:45] meant to live in that land
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; all the time
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; because that is where you come from.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; You come from that landlord.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, and the devil has you only hold you
[1:08:57] bondage
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; in Egypt. But but we're coming out of
[1:09:01] there
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; back to our land of possession,
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; back to our position in Christ.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Because no
[1:09:10] one can take you out of your position.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Do you believe it this
[1:09:15] morning?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; So wherever Jesus goes, there is
[1:09:19] possibility.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Wherever he goes.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what the circumstance he
[1:09:26] meets.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; There's possibility this morning.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; When they first told him, when Gyrus
[1:09:32] first came up to him and said, "My
[1:09:33] daughter is gravely ill."
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Uh she's near death.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The first report was that
[1:09:38] she was near death.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; She wasn't dead yet at that moment.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know what happened between then
[1:09:45] and the next report, but it moved from
[1:09:47] bad to worse.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; She moved from near death to death
[1:09:52] itself.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And even that didn't stop Jesus.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; When Gyrus first came to him and said,
[1:10:00] "Lord, I have a grave issue." He said,
[1:10:02] "Let's go." All right.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He grabbed Gyrus and all his disciples
[1:10:06] and they were going down
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; to Gyrus's house
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; to heal, to do something, to speak
[1:10:13] something.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe this morning
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; that Jesus is a time waster.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste time.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; So if he headed down there,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; at the first report,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; he already knew
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; that he could do something about it.
[1:10:30] And if the second report didn't hinder
[1:10:32] him,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; then we got to know that something is
[1:10:34] about to happen
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is on his way.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, and when Jesus is on his way, can't
[1:10:42] the devil stop you? Something's got to
[1:10:44] happen, brother Popwell, because he's on
[1:10:46] his way. And this morning, he is on his
[1:10:49] way. He is already here this morning.
[1:10:52] The Lord himself has descended from
[1:10:55] heaven with a shout. He is on the earth
[1:10:58] right now. He wouldn't be here if there
[1:11:02] wasn't a possibility
[1:11:04] for you this morning and for your
[1:11:07] situation.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that right? He wouldn't give
[1:11:12] it the time of day if he didn't know he
[1:11:16] could do something about it.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; But he knew he could do something. So he
[1:11:21] confidently walked
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; and the disciples followed him and Gyrus
[1:11:26] followed him and many other people
[1:11:28] although also thronged Jesus
[1:11:32] and is in this scenario is where we find
[1:11:34] the woman with the blood issue because
[1:11:37] while Jesus was on his way to perform a
[1:11:40] miracle there was a certain woman who
[1:11:43] had an issue of blood who had something
[1:11:45] she needed and she decided she needed to
[1:11:49] interrupt the program just before Sunday
[1:11:52] pray for Gyrus's daughter. She not a
[1:11:56] need
[1:11:57] and she was willing to interrupt the
[1:11:59] program because she told yourself
[1:12:02] something. Oh, you got to talk to
[1:12:04] yourself. What are you telling yourself
[1:12:07] this morning? As a man thinkketh in his
[1:12:10] heart, so he is. If you tell yourself
[1:12:13] you can't make it, then you'll never
[1:12:15] make it. But if you tell yourself, I am
[1:12:18] a son. I am a daughter of God from
[1:12:22] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:12:24] I was predestinated to be healed, to be
[1:12:27] delivered, to be restored. If you tell
[1:12:30] yourself that this morning, then there's
[1:12:32] not enough devils in this universe that
[1:12:36] can stop you from receiving the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost, from being healed, from being
[1:12:41] delivered, from being restored.
[1:12:47] They can't stop you. because you've got
[1:12:50] faith.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; To bore hole, pass through all of that
[1:12:54] doubt
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; and get to Jesus.
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; You've already got what it takes
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; when you conquered in your heart.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; That woman of the blood is, you
[1:13:05] conquered everything in her heart
[1:13:06] already.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Before she even approached that line.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of that press, while
[1:13:13] everybody was grabbing at the top,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; she decided to do something different.
[1:13:18] She decided to crawl. She went where
[1:13:21] they least expected it. She went down on
[1:13:23] the dirt, down in the floor. She took
[1:13:26] her chances down there because everybody
[1:13:28] was trying to grab him up here and touch
[1:13:29] Jesus and want to be part of Jesus and
[1:13:31] want to take pictures with Jesus. She
[1:13:33] didn't come to take pictures. She didn't
[1:13:35] come to have a conversation. She didn't
[1:13:37] come to shake hands. She didn't come to
[1:13:40] join a church. She had a need that was
[1:13:43] greater than that. Do you have a need
[1:13:45] this morning? Are you ready to interrupt
[1:13:49] the program? To interrupt the flow of
[1:13:51] things? Is your need greater this
[1:13:54] morning? Greater than your mind battle,
[1:13:56] greater than your struggle, greater than
[1:13:58] what the devil throw in your direction.
[1:14:00] Is your need to find Jesus this morning?
[1:14:04] Oh, if you seek for him, you shall find
[1:14:07] him. When you seek for him with all of
[1:14:11] your heart,
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; she touches Jesus.
[1:14:17] and she gets what she asked for, what
[1:14:19] she's praying for,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; what the doctors couldn't provide.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; What modern medicine could not provide
[1:14:26] for her at that time.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; At that critical hour of her life,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; she got what she came for
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; from Jesus.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday. He's the same
[1:14:38] today. He's the same forever. Don't care
[1:14:42] how much modern medicine that they have
[1:14:45] nowadays. It cannot replace the healing
[1:14:49] touch of Jesus. If you need a healing
[1:14:52] touch, he is here to heal every
[1:14:54] sickness, heal every disease, heal every
[1:14:58] frustration in your mind, every worry,
[1:15:02] every burden in your mind. He's here to
[1:15:05] heal it this morning. He's here to bring
[1:15:07] deliverance to the captive. He's here to
[1:15:10] bring peace in your troubled soul. He's
[1:15:13] here to bring rest to your weary soul.
[1:15:16] He's here to do something for you
[1:15:20] that no one else can.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Oh, hallelujah. Glory.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Wherever Jesus goes, there is
[1:15:33] possibility
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; because in him is life.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in him is light.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; And this light is the light of the
[1:15:41] world.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; It is the light of men.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; In him there is no darkness at all.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; I'm told when you light a match and you
[1:15:53] hold it up against the wall, you will
[1:15:55] see the shadow of the matchstick. But
[1:15:57] you'll never see the shadow of the flame
[1:15:59] because a flame don't cast no shadow.
[1:16:02] And Jesus is the light. There's no
[1:16:05] darkness in him at all that you can
[1:16:07] find.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? There's only light.
[1:16:10] There's only possibility.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; The blind sees wherever he goes. The the
[1:16:18] sick is being healed.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go in scripture, the
[1:16:21] cripples are walking out of their beds.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible even said at a certain place
[1:16:25] that many more miracles that Jesus
[1:16:27] performed
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; that are not recorded in the scripture,
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; but these have been recorded. that you
[1:16:34] might believe
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; that he is the son of God
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; that was sent forth into all the world
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; to die for the sins of man
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and to make us free. Isn't that right?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? The grass the the
[1:16:47] cripples are walking. Isn't that right?
[1:16:48] The gospel is preaching power
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; wherever Jesus goes. Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; The message called life in 57 the
[1:16:54] prophet said here and I find out that
[1:16:56] when he said I give unto them eternal
[1:16:59] life he said it comes from the word the
[1:17:02] Greek word Zoe z o e zoey
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; and zoe is god's own life
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; and then as sure as we are a partaker of
[1:17:13] zoey we exist eternally like god exists
[1:17:18] eternally
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; therefore by being partaken of God,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; we actually become eternally blessed and
[1:17:25] saved forever and ever without end
[1:17:27] without beginning. We become a part of
[1:17:31] God.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. When we are sure
[1:17:35] as we are partakers of Zoe, then we
[1:17:38] exist eternally like God exists
[1:17:42] eternally.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; And therefore by partaking of God, we
[1:17:46] become eternally blessed and save
[1:17:49] forever. we become a part of God. So
[1:17:53] therefore, by partaking of God, we
[1:17:56] become a part of God. Let me say that
[1:17:59] one more time. By partaking of God, we
[1:18:02] actually become a part of God. Oh,
[1:18:06] hallelujah. Isn't that right? That's why
[1:18:08] in Revelation, they keep telling John,
[1:18:10] "Come and see. Come and see." Because
[1:18:12] you've got to see this thing for
[1:18:14] yourself. You've got to partake of it
[1:18:17] and understand what's going on. It can't
[1:18:19] be somebody else's experience. It cannot
[1:18:23] be somebody else's testimony. It cannot
[1:18:26] be somebody's else's idea or someone
[1:18:29] else's report of what is happening. You
[1:18:31] need to come and see. Oh, that's why
[1:18:34] David said in the Psalms, "Oh, taste and
[1:18:37] see that the Lord is good. Blessed is
[1:18:41] the man that trusteth in him. You've got
[1:18:45] to taste this thing for yourself. If you
[1:18:49] haven't tasted of it, then you haven't
[1:18:52] partaken of it. And if you haven't
[1:18:54] partaken of it, then you can't become a
[1:18:57] part of God.
[1:19:00] Oh, you can't talk about the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:03] You've got to have the Holy Ghost. You
[1:19:06] can't talk about salvation. You've got
[1:19:08] to have salvation. You can't talk about
[1:19:11] sanctification. You've got to have
[1:19:13] sanctification. You've got to partake.
[1:19:16] You've got to taste and see that the
[1:19:20] Lord is good. Oh, that his mercies is
[1:19:23] everlasting and that his truth endure to
[1:19:26] all generations. You've got the taste of
[1:19:29] it in the trial, brother Batist. You got
[1:19:32] the taste of it in the storm. That's the
[1:19:34] best time to taste Jesus. Oh,
[1:19:38] hallelujah. He's the sweetest thing I
[1:19:40] know. Because when the storm is around
[1:19:42] you, when there's no light that you can
[1:19:44] see with your eyes, you believe that
[1:19:47] there's a God in your heart that never
[1:19:50] failed you yet. And you could lift up
[1:19:52] your hands in the midst of your
[1:19:54] circumstance and say, "Though he slay
[1:19:57] me, yet will I trust him. I love him." I
[1:20:03] want the devil to know that I love him
[1:20:06] this morning. And there's no heights, no
[1:20:09] depths that can separate me from the
[1:20:12] love of God
[1:20:15] that is in Christ Jesus.
[1:20:18] For who he forneew, he called, and who
[1:20:21] he called, he had justified. And who he
[1:20:24] had justified, he had already
[1:20:28] glorified. What shall we then say to
[1:20:31] these things? If God be for us, who can
[1:20:35] be against us? Oh,
[1:20:39] hallelujah. Can the devil with all his
[1:20:42] mind battles, with all his misery be
[1:20:44] against you? I say nay. Who can lay
[1:20:47] charge against God's elect? It is God
[1:20:50] that justifyth. It's God that justified
[1:20:52] you before the foundation of the world
[1:20:56] that your face will be counted for
[1:20:58] righteousness. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:21:00] Hallelujah. stand there
[1:21:03] with the faith of Abraham
[1:21:06] in your situation
[1:21:09] and get the same victory
[1:21:12] and conquer like the early fathers
[1:21:13] conquered.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Same faith it take to slay Goliath was
[1:21:19] the same faith Peter had to say rise up
[1:21:21] and walk. It's
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; not a different faith.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Same faith.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; It's faith.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Pure possibility. Amen. and in God.
[1:21:31] Isn't that right? All right.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Me hurry along here.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; So, by partaking of God, we actually
[1:21:38] become a part of God. Isn't that right?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. So, it's so it's so you've
[1:21:44] got to know him for yourself.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; You've got to know him.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Because to know him is life.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Not just the word,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; but the author of the word.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; To know him.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? To have a relationship
[1:21:58] with him.
[1:22:00] That's what we aspire to do this
[1:22:02] morning.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; And it's only when you taste it for
[1:22:06] yourself.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; That's when you can truly tell others
[1:22:10] about it.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Because now you become a witness.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; A true witness
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; of what he's done for you in your life.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; It's not someone else's account
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; or someone else's story about what he's
[1:22:22] done,
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; but you have your story that you could
[1:22:25] tell
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; about how you overcome. And the Bible
[1:22:29] said they overcame him by the blood of
[1:22:31] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:22:34] testimony that glorifies God in their
[1:22:38] age. And right in this age of 2025, you
[1:22:41] are going to have a testimony
[1:22:44] of taste and see that what the Lord has
[1:22:47] done for me. Oh brother, come and see.
[1:22:51] Sister, come and see. Auntie, come and
[1:22:55] see. Uncle, come and see. Oh, what the
[1:22:58] Lord has done for me. He gave me joy
[1:23:02] when I had no joy. He He gave me peace
[1:23:05] when I had no peace. He gave me love. He
[1:23:08] gave me friendship.
[1:23:11] Oh, hallelujah. He gave me something
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; more than gold
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; in my soul.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. Like a
[1:23:22] stream running down.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Second Peter Peter
[1:23:27] 4:1 says, "Whereby given unto us
[1:23:28] exceeding great and precious promises,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; That by these he might be partakers of
[1:23:33] the divine nature,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:23:38] the world through lust."
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? You become a partaker,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; of the divine nature of God
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; when you partake of this life.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; This life that he has revealed in the
[1:23:48] last days that we are to partake of
[1:23:51] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:23:52] and so on. Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; That's why we are we aspire to this with
[1:23:57] all diligence.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because by partaking
[1:24:00] of this, we become a part of God.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Oh my.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; For so entrance shall be ministered unto
[1:24:07] you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:24:08] kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. So
[1:24:11] dead isn't really dead. It's just laying
[1:24:14] dormant.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; We live in the realm of the natural. So
[1:24:19] therefore when we see something dead in
[1:24:21] our world
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; in our context through our eyes
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; as far as we are concerned it is a lost
[1:24:28] cause.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; It is finished at that point.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; When the servant came the second time
[1:24:33] with the report
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; he was coming to tell him that why you
[1:24:36] bothering with this mission anymore.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Cancel the mission. Best we abort the
[1:24:41] mission because because your daughter is
[1:24:44] dead.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; There's no hope for her. She she she has
[1:24:47] already gone beyond the point of no
[1:24:50] return.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; But with God that doesn't exist
[1:24:54] and because with God that doesn't exist,
[1:24:57] his son will do likewise because Jesus
[1:25:00] said, "I do that which the father had
[1:25:02] shown me." So if God is not moved by the
[1:25:05] death report, then Jesus is not moved by
[1:25:08] the death report because you are living
[1:25:10] in time but he is living in eternity.
[1:25:14] Oh, so when the doctor says time of
[1:25:16] death, oh, it's 11:20 a.m. God has a
[1:25:19] different story. He says time of life
[1:25:22] forever, forever, for always. There's no
[1:25:26] end of life. There is no beginning of
[1:25:28] days. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:32] Oh, glory, glory, glory.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; With God, all things are possible. And
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; if your objective of today's service
[1:25:41] today is to get to you is to see that
[1:25:43] there is a possibility
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; that lies beyond the natural
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; that God is able to do for you today.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that that's our objective to
[1:25:52] be here this morning and I pray that God
[1:25:55] will anchor that to you today. Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; By the word of God.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; So because there is no way back from
[1:26:01] that. We can't see any other possibility
[1:26:03] outside of death because we've never had
[1:26:05] an experience beyond death that that
[1:26:08] confirms to us that that that anything
[1:26:10] is possible. That's what our natural
[1:26:12] eyes tell us. But today, God is
[1:26:16] supernatural.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; He is not natural.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He is supernatural.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Anything that you could explain with
[1:26:24] science and with with this and that is
[1:26:26] called natural. But when science has
[1:26:28] reached its limit, when man has reached
[1:26:31] its limit, when we are out of
[1:26:33] explanations, then that is what we call
[1:26:36] the supernatural. Oh, natural science
[1:26:39] can do this. Modern technology can do
[1:26:42] that. But when God could bring somebody
[1:26:45] back from the dead, when God could raise
[1:26:47] up a broken life, a forgotten life, a
[1:26:51] brother or sister who gave up on
[1:26:54] themselves, a young man, young woman who
[1:26:56] said they're far gone, there's no point
[1:26:59] of return for me. When God does that for
[1:27:02] an individual, that is supernatural.
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:10] And that is what the gospel can do.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; That is what Jesus can do.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; For someone who believes,
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; it is to him that believeth this
[1:27:20] morning.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in God this morning?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus told that silver, he said, "Don't
[1:27:25] be afraid.
[1:27:27] Only believe.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; All things are possible
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; if you only believe."
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hey, just keep your eyes on Jesus.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Don't look to the left. Don't look to
[1:27:38] what is being said on the right.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Just keep your eyes focused on the goal
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; cuz Jesus can get you there.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus alone.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? So today he is
[1:27:50] supernatural.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He exists. What does that mean?
[1:27:54] He's supernatural. Meaning he exists
[1:27:56] outside of the realm of possibilities.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Outside of the natural and earthly realm
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; that you can see with your eyes.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; And of course. Yeah. Amen. Right? Isn't
[1:28:08] that right? So, what is laying in you
[1:28:10] has got to come to life.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There's a reason Jesus has
[1:28:15] come down the road this morning.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; He's come to get you
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; because there's something special about
[1:28:20] you
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; and you are being called to a higher
[1:28:23] place.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; He's going to resurrect you this
[1:28:26] morning.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Bring you out from the dead works of in
[1:28:30] this life and bring you onto life
[1:28:32] eternal life in Jesus Christ. Holy
[1:28:35] Spirit works. That's what he's here to
[1:28:37] bring you to this morning. And there is
[1:28:39] no devil that can stop him on his
[1:28:41] mission this morning. Uh he will get to
[1:28:44] you and uh and and return unto you
[1:28:48] according to the time of life.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I was studying Genesis
[1:28:53] recently and I realized something here
[1:28:55] again and the scripture actually shows
[1:28:58] us where animal life comes from.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I know we probably read this before, but
[1:29:04] I want us to read it again. we'll kind
[1:29:06] of catch what he's saying. What they're
[1:29:07] saying here in Genesis. It's no mystery
[1:29:09] that a fish can't help but swim. You
[1:29:11] know, it always says it fish swimming is
[1:29:13] built into the fish. Flying is built
[1:29:16] into the bird.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? It's built in. They
[1:29:19] can't help but do it.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Look at this. The fish of the sea and
[1:29:22] the fowl of the air. When God proclaimed
[1:29:25] this creation, he said in Genesis 1:20,
[1:29:28] which 120, he said, "And God said, let
[1:29:31] the waters bring forth abundantly the
[1:29:34] moving creature that hath life
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; and foul that may fly above the earth."
[1:29:40] Let me say that one more time cuz I feel
[1:29:42] you didn't you didn't get that. And God
[1:29:44] said, "Let the waters bring forth
[1:29:47] abundantly the moving creature
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; that had life."
[1:29:52] In other words, it was the mouth of God
[1:29:53] that spoken it, but the water, God used
[1:29:57] the water as an incubator
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; of the word. Just like he used Mary as
[1:30:03] an incubator for the word to come forth,
[1:30:06] he used the sea as an incubator, as a
[1:30:09] womb to bring forth every moving
[1:30:12] creature, every fish, every squid, every
[1:30:16] crustation, everything that is seen,
[1:30:19] every millions of species of fish was
[1:30:22] actually come out of the sea itself. It
[1:30:24] means out of the water itself came forth
[1:30:27] every creature,
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; every fish, every whale, every
[1:30:32] crustation. Isn't that right?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Both great and small. Isn't that right?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me read
[1:30:39] it here. And God created great whales
[1:30:42] and every living creature that move it,
[1:30:45] which the waters brought forth
[1:30:47] abundantly
[1:30:48] after their kind, and after every winged
[1:30:51] fowl of its kind. And God saw that it
[1:30:55] was good. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:58] Isn't that right?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And then when you skip down, lower down
[1:31:01] now to 124, he said he talks about the
[1:31:05] beast and creeping things. Let me read
[1:31:06] it. And God said, "Let the earth bring
[1:31:09] forth the living creature
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and after its kind, let the earth bring
[1:31:13] forth." Oh, so the voice of God spoke on
[1:31:16] it, but the earth had a job to do.
[1:31:19] Though the voice of God spoke it, the
[1:31:21] water had a job to do. The waters had to
[1:31:24] bring forth of every fish. The earth had
[1:31:27] to bring forth of every beast of the
[1:31:29] field, every creeping thing that
[1:31:32] creepeth upon the earth. The earth had a
[1:31:34] job to do. And when God had created all
[1:31:36] of it, ask me a question, preacher.
[1:31:39] Where did man come from? Genesis 1:26.
[1:31:43] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:31:47] image, after our likeness, and let them
[1:31:51] have dominion over the fish, over the
[1:31:54] fowls, over the creeping thing." Oh, man
[1:31:57] didn't come from the earth originally.
[1:32:01] He come from God. Oh, this flesh man
[1:32:05] come from the earth. But where do we
[1:32:07] come from this morning? Oh, brother
[1:32:10] Brham said, "When God created me,
[1:32:13] William Brham, I was before the
[1:32:16] foundation of the world. He made my
[1:32:19] being, he made my spirit, I wasn't
[1:32:22] conscious of it." He said, "But I was
[1:32:24] there." He said, "Oh, I don't believe
[1:32:26] you're getting it. Wait just a minute."
[1:32:29] He told his disciples, he knew them
[1:32:32] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:32:35] Paul said here that he chose us in him
[1:32:38] before the world began. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:32:44] Oh, are you getting it this morning? Oh,
[1:32:47] brother said, "There's some part of me.
[1:32:50] There's some part of Alman Neville.
[1:32:52] There's some part of the rest of you
[1:32:53] here. There's some part of you, somebody
[1:32:55] of you, my brother, some part of you, my
[1:32:58] sister, that Jesus Christ before the
[1:33:01] world ever began." Oh, and the Brother
[1:33:04] Benham said, "I think that people today
[1:33:08] are possessed with this spirit or the
[1:33:12] spirit of the part of the angelic
[1:33:14] beings. You are possessed with the
[1:33:17] spirit that rotated off of God that
[1:33:21] never fell in the beginning and resisted
[1:33:24] the devil's lie. You are possessed this
[1:33:27] morning with a supernatural spirit. That
[1:33:30] spirit won't let you back down. That
[1:33:32] spirit will not let you give up. That
[1:33:34] spirit woke up this morning with the
[1:33:37] Holy Ghost. That spirit woke you up this
[1:33:40] morning. You put your clothes on. You
[1:33:43] came into the house of God. Uh you said,
[1:33:45] "I'm coming for deliverance. I'm coming
[1:33:48] for healing. I'm coming for
[1:33:49] breakthrough. I'm coming to get mine."
[1:33:53] Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:33:56] Woo! Somebody praise him. Somebody
[1:33:59] shout. You are possessed with that
[1:34:02] spirit this morning. Oh
[1:34:06] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:34:10] Hallelujah. Brother Oid said it before.
[1:34:13] He said if some man is possessed with
[1:34:15] the spirit of devils. Hallelujah. 10,000
[1:34:19] devils upon him. He'll have the strength
[1:34:21] of 10 men. He could fight and kick.
[1:34:24] Isn't that right? He's got power.
[1:34:26] Natural power. And if demons could do
[1:34:28] that to a man, what about a son? What
[1:34:31] about a daughter of God that is fully
[1:34:34] possessed by the spirit of the living
[1:34:36] God? They become omnipotent. They become
[1:34:39] unstoppable. They become undefeated
[1:34:43] because God is in you and God is with
[1:34:45] you to defeat the enemy on any ground he
[1:34:49] comes upon.
[1:34:51] Oh, because you are possessed.
[1:34:54] Oh, by this attribute son spirit that
[1:34:58] you once was
[1:35:00] in the beginning and before the
[1:35:03] beginning. Isn't that right?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, wonderful. I feel we got that this
[1:35:08] morning. Amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; That's great. Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can move on. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:35:14] Give him praise.
[1:35:16] Oh yes. Rejoice ever more. Oh, rejoice,
[1:35:21] oh my soul. forget not all his benefits.
[1:35:25] He chose you. He put something in you
[1:35:28] this morning
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; to defy the odds.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; No matter how the circumstance look, God
[1:35:36] put a faith in your soul
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; to go beyond possibilities
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; and see the impossible made possible.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; God be praised.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you are possessed with
[1:35:50] that spirit this morning. Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Something possessed me this morning
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; to get out of my bed
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; and to give God glory
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; and to put on my clothes because I know
[1:36:00] something has got a hold of me. I went
[1:36:04] to a meeting one night and my heart was
[1:36:07] right and something got a hold of me. It
[1:36:11] held me in primary school. It held me in
[1:36:13] high school. It held me in college. It
[1:36:16] held me here on the streets. It held me
[1:36:19] on the job. It's still holding me. It's
[1:36:22] still keeping me. It's keeping my wife.
[1:36:25] It's keeping my family. It's keeping my
[1:36:28] finances. I am possessed with a spirit
[1:36:31] this morning that lets me praise him,
[1:36:34] that lets me worship him. And it won't
[1:36:36] let me doubt. It won't let me back down.
[1:36:39] It won't let me give up. It won't let me
[1:36:42] get. Oh, I've got to get a hold of him.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; He alone has the answer.
[1:36:51] Jesus alone. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] Glory.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Angelic beings associate together.
[1:36:59] I hope you get that. He said that just
[1:37:02] dropped right down. I said, look, if you
[1:37:04] got the Holy Spirit in you, then you are
[1:37:06] a candidate for association with the
[1:37:10] unseen world, with the supernatural.
[1:37:14] Oh, you are a candidate. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:37:17] Hallelujah. Glory. When you get that
[1:37:19] Holy Spirit inside your soul, but the
[1:37:22] Bible said when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:37:24] into the human heart, you become a
[1:37:27] two-fold being. One on earth to die, but
[1:37:30] one in heaven to live. Oh, your body
[1:37:32] might be subject to death, but in your
[1:37:34] soul, you are passed from death unto
[1:37:37] life. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, you come from
[1:37:40] God. You go back to God. That's why God
[1:37:44] redeemed you because of seed in you had
[1:37:46] to come to life just as God redeemed the
[1:37:49] earth.
[1:37:51] Listen, there's no scripture that says,
[1:37:53] "Let there be seed." It's in Genesis
[1:37:55] 1:11. We say God said, "Let every seed
[1:37:58] bring forth after its kind." And then
[1:38:00] the Bible explained that the seed was in
[1:38:02] itself in the earth. So when God created
[1:38:05] the earth, the seed was already inside
[1:38:07] of it. And what God was just doing was
[1:38:10] preparing the earth for the seas to come
[1:38:13] forth. That's why God redeemed you.
[1:38:16] That's why God paid the price for you.
[1:38:18] That's why God died for you on Calvary.
[1:38:21] He was preparing a groundh.
[1:38:28] He had to redeem you. He redeemed the
[1:38:31] earth by water. He redeemed the earth by
[1:38:33] blood. He'll redeem the earth by fire.
[1:38:36] He'll do for you the same because
[1:38:38] there's a seed inside of you
[1:38:41] that's got to come to life. Oh,
[1:38:45] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, set me free.
[1:38:53] Hallelujah.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's wonderful.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; In his body, he has earthly contact with
[1:38:59] your five senses. But in your spirit,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; you have contact with God through the
[1:39:05] Holy Ghost
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; and the angels of God visit you,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; speaks with them. Isn't that right? They
[1:39:11] are messengers sent from God
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; to reveal and to bring messages from God
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; to the individual
[1:39:18] in you is a seed of potential
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; ready to bring forth season, bring forth
[1:39:23] fruit in your season of life. Isn't that
[1:39:25] right? And there's coming forth another
[1:39:28] time of life
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; real soon.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; We believe it to be true
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; and that you are going to bring forth
[1:39:34] Christ.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to bring forth Messiah.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Psalms 126 and verse 5 says, "They that
[1:39:40] sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that
[1:39:44] goeth forth and weep it, bearing
[1:39:47] precious seed shall doubtless come again
[1:39:50] with rejoicing, bringing his sheav with
[1:39:53] him." Yes, there's a time of weeping,
[1:39:56] but it's not forever. Psalms 30 said
[1:39:59] weeping may endure for a night, but joy,
[1:40:03] joy, joy cometh in the morning. Weeping
[1:40:06] is not forever. Weeping is just in this
[1:40:09] natural realm. But there's going to come
[1:40:11] a time when Jesus himself will go around
[1:40:15] the table of the lamb and wipe every
[1:40:18] tear from the eyes. Oh, hallelujah. He's
[1:40:21] going to keep heal you from all your
[1:40:23] hurts. help you of all your troubles.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He loves you this
[1:40:29] morning. and he's here to minister to
[1:40:31] you and encourage your heart even now.
[1:40:36] God is able to do something for us this
[1:40:39] morning that even though you're sewing
[1:40:41] tears,
[1:40:43] sewing praying, hallelujah, sewing seed,
[1:40:46] seeking, sewing seed and labor, sewing
[1:40:49] seed, oh, without a visible sign of
[1:40:52] possibility of newness of life, uh
[1:40:55] you're on the cross. You're bearing all
[1:40:58] things, believing all things, and hope
[1:41:00] in all things, knowing that charity is
[1:41:02] coming. Charity is on its way. Charity
[1:41:06] upon a perfectness. Charity, the
[1:41:08] absolute is coming to seal the virtues
[1:41:12] inside of your soul and give you a brand
[1:41:15] new touch and cap off your life.
[1:41:19] Oh,
[1:41:20] so that you go no more out.
[1:41:24] Amen.
[1:41:25] but that you become a pillar
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; in the house of the go our God.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Feeling fine this morning.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Sarah's womb was dead.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; As far as man knows.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Sarah's womb was dead.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; It was barren.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; She couldn't bring forth nothing. Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; And more than that,
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; she was too old to bring forth children.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; So there was no possibility in this
[1:41:59] earthly realm
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; of her ever bringing forth the promised
[1:42:02] son, Isaac.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; But that has nothing to do with God.
[1:42:06] Because when God called Abraham out of
[1:42:08] the tent, he said, "Look up at the
[1:42:10] stars. Count the stars. I'm waiting for
[1:42:13] you. Count if you could finish. When
[1:42:16] you're finished, tell me when you're
[1:42:17] finished." Oh, the answer is still
[1:42:19] wrong. You can't count it. He said, "So
[1:42:22] shall thy seed be." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:24] Hallelujah. You are going to bring forth
[1:42:26] a son. Oh hal. And that seed, oh
[1:42:30] hallelujah. Is going to be the seed of
[1:42:32] nations. Oh, and through your wife
[1:42:34] Sarah, she's going to bring forth this
[1:42:37] promised son. God didn't talk to Sarah.
[1:42:40] God talked to Abraham. Therefore,
[1:42:42] Abraham had to have faith for himself
[1:42:45] and his house, to walk and stagger not
[1:42:48] at the promise of God through unbelief.
[1:42:51] But he was strong, giving praise to God.
[1:42:55] Did Abraham have struggles? Yes, he did.
[1:42:57] Did Abraham have mind battles? Yes, he
[1:43:00] did. But the Bible doesn't record that.
[1:43:03] What the Bible says was that Abraham
[1:43:05] staggered not at the promise of God. Oh,
[1:43:09] you have struggles. You have trials. You
[1:43:12] have testings. But the seed inside your
[1:43:14] soul is testifying something back this
[1:43:17] morning. Uh that in 2025
[1:43:20] you come up all the road. Many fell off
[1:43:23] on the left. Many fell off to the right.
[1:43:26] But you staggered not at the promise of
[1:43:29] God. Oh hallelujah. But you were strong
[1:43:32] in your faith. Uh oh. In your age, in
[1:43:35] your hour, in the most evil age that
[1:43:37] there was. God put a faith in your soul,
[1:43:40] my brother, a faith in your soul, my
[1:43:42] sister, and he is going to reward it
[1:43:45] with a glorious, wonderful baptism of
[1:43:49] the Holy Ghost. That sweet Holy Spirit
[1:43:52] is going to sweep over your soul and
[1:43:55] seal you
[1:43:57] into the kingdom of God by the fire of
[1:44:00] the living God that comes into the human
[1:44:03] heart. A literal experience.
[1:44:08] that you must have
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; in order to meet him in the
[1:44:11] resurrection.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Out there yonder,
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; he's got to have something in here to
[1:44:17] recognize you up there. Representation.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; He promised to send down your
[1:44:23] representation by fire in your soul and
[1:44:27] confirm the faith that you have in him.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. In your word for your day. He's
[1:44:35] going to anoint your word for your day.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; He's going to anoint you to manifest
[1:44:40] Revelation 22:17. He's going to anoint
[1:44:42] you
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; with a special anointing
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; for the bride in the last days.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what we are waiting on.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; We're waiting for the spirit to come
[1:44:51] upon us.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I remember a friend
[1:44:55] was a student Yeah. was telling me
[1:44:58] something or somebody somebody's telling
[1:44:59] me something about juvie
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; and they were saying that they went and
[1:45:04] play Juvie
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; and apparently there's this thing that
[1:45:07] they wait on
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; they wait on the breaking of the day
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; and the person described it they said
[1:45:12] there's a spirit that happens there's
[1:45:14] something that breaks upon the people
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; just about the breaking of the day
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; they said anybody who experienced jo
[1:45:21] that's what they're waiting for it's not
[1:45:23] so much the music it's not too much the
[1:45:25] mud mass and the this but what they
[1:45:26] waiting on is for that spirit of freedom
[1:45:29] to come upon them that lets them loose
[1:45:32] that makes them break their bands and
[1:45:33] jump and carry on and revalry and so
[1:45:36] forth. They are actually waiting on a
[1:45:38] spirit to come upon them and I said my
[1:45:41] if the people in the world are waiting
[1:45:43] on a demonic entity to come upon them to
[1:45:46] give them freedom then what are we
[1:45:48] waiting on this morning? Brother
[1:45:50] Brandham said you know what I'm waiting
[1:45:51] on. I'm waiting on the angel of God. We
[1:45:55] are those angelic spirits. We are
[1:45:57] waiting for our spirits to come upon us.
[1:46:01] The spirit of the living God to give us
[1:46:04] power to heal the sick. Give us power to
[1:46:07] raise the dead. Give us power to give to
[1:46:09] make us real Christians so that we could
[1:46:12] walk holy, walk reverence, walk in a way
[1:46:16] that God will be pleased with us that he
[1:46:18] could tap us on the shoulder and say,
[1:46:20] "My son, I speak to you by my spirit.
[1:46:24] Turn left on this street. Turn right on
[1:46:27] this street. You don't have to know all
[1:46:28] the answers. We just trust in God. Uh
[1:46:31] cuz he has a plan for your life. He
[1:46:34] knows
[1:46:36] what's going to happen real soon.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; And he wants to position you
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; for his mighty working power
[1:46:44] to be wrought in your life. Isn't that
[1:46:46] right?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Time is hurrying on.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; So Sarah's womb was dead,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; but it didn't stay dead for long.
[1:46:54] One time Abraham is out there in the
[1:46:56] desert.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Three men come up the road.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; It's an empty desert
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; with three men walking up the road.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; There are not many visitors in the
[1:47:06] desert. So if three men come walking up
[1:47:08] the road, that's got to be something
[1:47:10] special. It's got to be a special
[1:47:13] visitation. It's got to be coming for
[1:47:15] them. They were headed in their
[1:47:17] direction. And Abraham said, "Get the
[1:47:19] feast ready. Get the fire ready. Get the
[1:47:22] table ready. We are about to have a
[1:47:25] visitation. 25 years on believing, but
[1:47:28] the visitation is finally here. And my
[1:47:31] brother, my sister, you've got to be
[1:47:33] under expectation for your visitation.
[1:47:37] Angels are getting ready to visit you
[1:47:40] real soon. You better get ready this
[1:47:42] morning. Get the house cleaning this
[1:47:44] morning. Sweep the cobwebs. Sweep out
[1:47:47] the floors. Let the neighbors see the
[1:47:50] dust flying. We are getting ready for a
[1:47:53] special mighty visitation.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:47:58] to visit you
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; according to your time of life.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Aon's rod was dead.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; It was dead, but it wasn't dead.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; But your natural eyes was it was a stick
[1:48:15] for a long time.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Bible actually records Aon rod was what
[1:48:19] the rod god used. Aaron lifted up his
[1:48:21] rod and miracles begin to happen. Signs
[1:48:24] and wonders begin to happen. God used
[1:48:26] the dead rod, hallelujah, to do all
[1:48:29] forms of miracles. But one time Aaron
[1:48:32] left that rod in the right place. He
[1:48:35] forgot that rod in the right place. Oh,
[1:48:38] hallelujah. In the presence of the
[1:48:39] shikina glory. Oh, overnight. What was
[1:48:43] for years dead? What was for years just
[1:48:46] a old stick that God used to defy the
[1:48:49] mighty kingdom of Egypt? What was a old
[1:48:52] dead stick? God. And in the presence of
[1:48:55] God, that stick once more came to life.
[1:49:00] Oh, it bued. It blossomed. It brought
[1:49:03] forth fruit. Oh, because it was
[1:49:06] connected to something. something you
[1:49:09] can't see with your eyes. But you know,
[1:49:11] you can feel it's a supernatural and
[1:49:14] it's a lifegiver to the word. And when
[1:49:17] God spoke every tree into existence,
[1:49:20] that stick had a genetic code inside of
[1:49:23] it. And when it was in the presence of
[1:49:26] the creator, when it was in the presence
[1:49:29] of the master, certain things uh begin
[1:49:33] to happen. And when you are in the
[1:49:36] presence of the master, certain things
[1:49:38] have got to happen. The sick are here,
[1:49:42] the blind sea, the walk. Uh you
[1:49:45] receive your portion
[1:49:48] in the presence of the master. Oh,
[1:49:53] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:56] That's why it's so important to be in
[1:49:58] the presence of the master. When you at
[1:50:00] work, press to be in the presence of the
[1:50:03] master. When you on the job, when you on
[1:50:06] the street, uh that's why prayer is
[1:50:08] important. Uh it keeps the atmosphere.
[1:50:11] It keeps the anointing on you while
[1:50:14] you're driving your car. Lord, I want to
[1:50:16] be uh in the presence of the master. I
[1:50:20] want to be sitting at your feet. Uh I
[1:50:22] want to be drinking from your cup. I
[1:50:24] want to be feasting at your table,
[1:50:26] surrounded by your glory, in your
[1:50:29] presence. That's where I long to be. Uh
[1:50:33] that's where I want to be always. Help
[1:50:36] me to be immersed in the presence of
[1:50:38] God. I want to be so immersed in the
[1:50:41] presence of God that doubts do not fase
[1:50:44] me, that trials don't phase me, that
[1:50:46] circumstances don't phase me. When
[1:50:48] things don't work out, that's all right.
[1:50:51] As long as I'm in the presence of Jesus,
[1:50:54] I'll make it. I'll be okay. He's with me
[1:50:58] in the trial. He is with me in the
[1:51:01] storm. Oh, may that be your testimony
[1:51:06] as a Christian.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; That's what real Christianity is.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Come alive again.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about Ezekiel.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; All right. Ezekiel once was stand in a
[1:51:23] valley of dry bones.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; God had him to be there.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "The hand of the Lord
[1:51:30] was upon me."
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And carried me out in the spirit of the
[1:51:33] Lord
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; and set me down in the midst of a valley
[1:51:37] which was full of bones. And he caused
[1:51:40] me to pass by a rem roundabout. And
[1:51:43] behold, there were many in the open
[1:51:45] valley. And lo, they were very dry. And
[1:51:49] he said unto me, "Son of man, can these
[1:51:52] bones live?" And I answered and said,
[1:51:55] "Oh Lord God, thou knowest?" And he said
[1:51:59] unto me, "Prophesy
[1:52:01] upon these bones and say unto them, oh
[1:52:05] ye dry bones." Oh, you got to prophesy
[1:52:07] this morning. Prophesy from the word of
[1:52:10] God, can these dry bones live? The word
[1:52:14] of God is here to answer that question
[1:52:17] this morning. that is not dead. It's
[1:52:19] only sleeping. It's only dormant. It's
[1:52:22] only waiting on a word from the Lord, on
[1:52:26] a word from the master to take what was
[1:52:29] once dead and bring it to life again.
[1:52:32] You are coming alive this morning. Lift
[1:52:35] up your hands. Give the Lord a shout of
[1:52:38] praise. Let every creeping thing, let
[1:52:41] everything that had breath, praise God.
[1:52:44] Let the new breaths of God come into you
[1:52:47] this morning. While you're worshiping,
[1:52:50] while you're praising, while you're
[1:52:52] defying the enemy, the Lord will send
[1:52:54] his ambushments and rock the enemy in
[1:52:58] your home, in your life, in your soul,
[1:53:02] in your heart, in your family. He is
[1:53:04] doing it now.
[1:53:07] Lift up your hands and claim the victory
[1:53:10] of God
[1:53:12] in the house of Almighty God.
[1:53:14] Hallelujah.
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:53:19] Glory. Glory. Glory. Oh my.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh ye dry bones.
[1:53:26] Hear the word of the Lord. Thus sayeth
[1:53:29] the Lord unto these bones. Speak to your
[1:53:33] bones this morning. Oh, whatever ache
[1:53:36] you got in your bones, speak to them
[1:53:38] bones this morning and say unto these
[1:53:40] bones, behold, I will cause breath to
[1:53:44] enter into you, and ye shall live, and I
[1:53:48] will lay senu upon you, and bring up
[1:53:50] flesh upon you, and cover you with skin,
[1:53:53] and put breath into you, and ye shall
[1:53:56] know that I am the Lord."
[1:54:00] And Ezekiel said, "So I prophesied as I
[1:54:04] was commanded and as I prophesied, while
[1:54:07] he had spake these words, while he was
[1:54:10] prophesying, there came a noise and
[1:54:13] behold, a shaking, and the bones came
[1:54:16] together." Oh, those bones are coming
[1:54:21] together this morning. What was
[1:54:23] scattered? What was like a puzzle? What
[1:54:26] couldn't be figured out? Those bones are
[1:54:30] coming together this morning. Bone to
[1:54:33] bone. The hip tie connected to the
[1:54:35] cheekbone and the leg bone to the
[1:54:37] kneebone and the kneebone to the
[1:54:39] footbone. And God knows where every bone
[1:54:42] is this morning. Let bone come to bone.
[1:54:45] Let every backsliden bone. Hear the
[1:54:47] voice of God this morning. Ricochet
[1:54:50] throughout the earth. The sons of God
[1:54:53] are coming back. Keep not thy sons from
[1:54:56] me. God is going to drag them from the
[1:54:58] east. Bring them from the west. Bring
[1:55:01] them from the north. Bring them from
[1:55:03] far.
[1:55:06] House of Israel.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; What is God doing?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Getting a bride together from the east,
[1:55:17] from the west, from the north, from the
[1:55:20] south. Isn't that right? And even
[1:55:22] brother oid shared with us on the Friday
[1:55:23] night service, the prayer service. He
[1:55:26] said God scattered us throughout the
[1:55:27] earth. Why? So that he could deal with
[1:55:30] us as individuals. He want some through
[1:55:33] the waters, some through the flood, some
[1:55:36] through great mountains, some through
[1:55:38] valleys, but all through the blood, some
[1:55:41] through storms, some through trials. But
[1:55:44] we've all got to have a testimony of how
[1:55:47] we overcome. You got to have something
[1:55:49] to tell David. When he threw Goliath,
[1:55:52] what are you going to say? When Joshua
[1:55:55] overcame the Amalachites, what are you
[1:55:57] going to say? When Elijah had to fight
[1:56:00] them prophets of Bale, what are you
[1:56:02] going to say? You've got to have a
[1:56:04] testimony this morning that I made it
[1:56:07] through the darkest hour, through the
[1:56:09] most evil age. God was with me. He is my
[1:56:13] rod. He is my staff. He was my fortress.
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:19] Hallelujah.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; He kept me from going crazy. He kept me
[1:56:24] from losing my mind. He kept me Oh, he
[1:56:28] kept me. God kept me from cracking my
[1:56:32] mind. He kept me uh He kept my family
[1:56:36] though they were wayward though they
[1:56:38] were straight away. He kept them. It was
[1:56:40] only God and God only. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:44] He's keeping you this morning. Lift up
[1:56:47] your hands and acknowledge the one who's
[1:56:50] been keeping you this morning. He's
[1:56:52] keeping your feet from falling. He's
[1:56:54] keeping your eyes from straying away
[1:56:56] from the truth.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:57:06] When I beheld and lo, the su and the
[1:57:09] flesh came upon them. The skin covered
[1:57:12] them,
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; but there was no breath in them.
[1:57:16] So it required another prophecy.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; The bone came together.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; The s news was upon it.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; The skin had covered it.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; The job was almost complete.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; But it needed one more prophecy. One
[1:57:30] more prophecy. He told Ezekiel,
[1:57:32] "Prophesy again. One more time. But this
[1:57:35] time, you're going to prophesy to the
[1:57:37] wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say unto
[1:57:41] the wind, thus sayeth the Lord, come
[1:57:44] from the four winds, O breath, and
[1:57:47] breathe upon these slain, that they
[1:57:50] might live. Oh, God is doing a work in
[1:57:53] your life. He's putting bones to bone.
[1:57:56] He's putting flesh upon those bones.
[1:57:58] He's putting skin upon those bones. We
[1:58:00] are being prepared by the Lord in the
[1:58:03] presence of God. What are we being
[1:58:05] prepared for? One more prophecy. Oh, the
[1:58:08] bride hasn't had a revival yet, but she
[1:58:11] is waiting for one more prophecy to come
[1:58:14] to pass that the wind of God, the wind,
[1:58:18] the breath of God, the same Holy Ghost
[1:58:20] wind that came into the upper room that
[1:58:24] blew through the upper house uh and
[1:58:26] filled all those that were sitting. That
[1:58:29] same holy lick of fire that sat upon
[1:58:32] each of them. Not just the apostles, but
[1:58:35] all of them received a lick of fire.
[1:58:39] Mary received her lick of fire. Martha
[1:58:43] received her lick of fire. Oh, and you
[1:58:46] are going to receive every man, every
[1:58:50] woman, every husband, every father,
[1:58:53] every deacon, every elder, every
[1:58:55] minister. Oh, downstairs, upstairs, in
[1:58:59] the back, technicians, receive it, oh
[1:59:01] the Holy Ghost. Oh, oh, breath of God.
[1:59:05] Uh, breathe upon these slain that they
[1:59:08] might live. Oh, you are like Samson this
[1:59:12] morning. You see a possibility that
[1:59:15] despite your eyes, you see a
[1:59:17] possibility. Oh, breath of God, breathe
[1:59:21] one more time. Once more, Lord, pour out
[1:59:25] your Holy Spirit. Once more, Lord, pour
[1:59:28] out your anointing. Once more, Lord,
[1:59:32] do what you can do,
[1:59:35] what you promise to do in this end time,
[1:59:41] in these last days.
[1:59:43] How we need the spirit of God
[1:59:46] more than ever,
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; more than ever before.
[1:59:52] Oh my, it's a privilege.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; to see what is needed in this hour
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; so that we could cry out for it.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; When the disciples went into the upper
[2:00:04] room, they cried out.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; They were waiting, taring, praying,
[2:00:08] seeking, looking
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; for a visitation.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Tarry in the city."
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Until you be endued.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Don't tarry until you feel tired.
[2:00:19] Don't tarry until you feel defeated.
[2:00:21] Don't tarry until you feel upset or
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; until you're hungry. Don't tired. No,
[2:00:25] no, no.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Tar until
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; until power is come to you.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Until you are endued with power from on
[2:00:33] high.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Until you get a portion from heaven,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; stay there
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; until you are visited with this mighty
[2:00:42] spirit
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; that is promised to come upon you.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And that's what they're waiting on. And
[2:00:48] that's what we're waiting on this
[2:00:49] morning
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; because with what we've got, we can't
[2:00:53] hardly do it.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; We can't have enough faith for a tut,
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; much less for the rapture. God help us.
[2:01:00] But God will visit us and give us power.
[2:01:04] Men who were once afraid to go out in
[2:01:06] public. They slammed the door open when
[2:01:09] they receive this Holy Ghost. And they
[2:01:12] said, "Men and brethren, what shall we
[2:01:14] do to be saved?" He said re repent every
[2:01:17] one of you and be baptized in the name
[2:01:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:01:22] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This
[2:01:26] gift that we have received shall come
[2:01:28] upon you also. Oh hallelujah.
[2:01:31] Hallelujah.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Oh and you'll do the same things we did.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, miracles. Isn't that
[2:01:38] right?
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; doing the same things.
[2:01:43] evidence that the same spirit is there.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're looking for this
[2:01:47] morning.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A continuation of that
[2:01:51] spirit. Oh my. Me hurry. A long time is
[2:01:53] going.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; So he prophesied as he commanded and
[2:01:56] breath came into them
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; and they lived
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; and stood up on their feet.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; An exceeding great army.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, God's got an exceeding great army
[2:02:06] out there. But they're waiting on the
[2:02:08] breath of God to come by a prophecy
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; to make them live
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; and act and move as God had for them to
[2:02:17] move. Isn't that right?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; According to the will of God,
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; isn't that right?
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:24] Oh my. I believe we got it this morning.
[2:02:26] Amen.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Lazarus was dead. Jesus said, "I go wake
[2:02:30] him." Matter of fact, he stick along a
[2:02:32] little two days more when he heard the
[2:02:35] report that he was gravely ill.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Well, isn't that right? And he waited.
[2:02:39] And some might think that was crazy.
[2:02:41] What What are you waiting on? But he was
[2:02:43] waiting on the right time. Waiting on
[2:02:45] the right season. And when the right
[2:02:47] season came, he said, "Lazarus is
[2:02:50] sleeping. But I go wake him." Oh, he is
[2:02:53] not dead as you think. He is not cut off
[2:02:55] as you suppose. Oh, hallelujah. I'm
[2:02:58] going. I've got a mission now. Oh,
[2:03:00] hallelujah. I'm going to wake up that
[2:03:02] which was dead. That which was once cut
[2:03:04] off, that which was lost. Oh, that which
[2:03:07] is seemingly lost. God is going to wake
[2:03:10] up the dead. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that
[2:03:12] right? Isn't that right? Hallelujah.
[2:03:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, St. John 11
[2:03:17] says, "These things he said after he
[2:03:18] said unto them, our friend Lazarus
[2:03:20] sleepeth, but I go that I might wake him
[2:03:22] out of sleep." And then said his
[2:03:24] disciples, "Lord, if he sleep, he shall
[2:03:27] do well."
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; They're thinking, "That's it. Let him go
[2:03:30] and rest in peace. And he said, "How be
[2:03:32] it Jesus speak of his death, but yet
[2:03:33] they thought that he had spoken of
[2:03:35] taking a rest in sleep." Oh, so I
[2:03:36] thought he was sleeping in the natural,
[2:03:38] isn't it? All right. So he said, "He do
[2:03:39] well. He's taking a rest." Then Jesus
[2:03:41] said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead."
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Now they understood he's dead. Praise
[2:03:45] God. And I go wake him. He said, "And
[2:03:47] I'm glad for your sakes that I was not
[2:03:49] there
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; to the intent that he might believe.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, let us go unto him." And
[2:03:54] verse 20 says, "Then Martha, as soon as
[2:03:56] she heard that Jesus was coming, went
[2:04:00] and met with him, but Mary sat still in
[2:04:02] the house." This was Martha's
[2:04:04] conversation.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And then Martha said unto Jesus, "Lord,
[2:04:08] if thou has been here, my brother had
[2:04:10] not died." Oh, hallelujah. What a word.
[2:04:13] Praise God. Hallelujah. She knew that if
[2:04:15] Jesus was in town, Lazarus couldn't stay
[2:04:18] in that condition because he is the
[2:04:20] healer. And once he is around, the sick
[2:04:23] cannot stay sick. Once Jesus is around,
[2:04:26] the dead cannot stay dead. Ba said, "If
[2:04:29] you had been here, he would not be
[2:04:31] dead." That's why he lingered two days
[2:04:34] more. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because
[2:04:36] there was something he wanted to perform
[2:04:38] and he still came down the road because
[2:04:40] he knew that there was a possibility. He
[2:04:43] wouldn't go somewhere unless he knew
[2:04:45] there was something he could do about
[2:04:46] it. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[2:04:51] And she said, "I know that even now
[2:04:53] whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; God will give it to thee, oh she had
[2:04:59] faith, and even now if you speak,
[2:05:02] something could change. Even now if you
[2:05:04] speak, the situation can turn around."
[2:05:07] Jesus said unto her, "Thy brother shall
[2:05:10] rise again." Martha said unto him, "I
[2:05:13] know that he will rise again in the
[2:05:15] resurrection and at the last day." Oh,
[2:05:18] she's plugging into the word now. But
[2:05:19] Jesus said unto her, "I am the
[2:05:22] resurrection and the life." You might be
[2:05:25] looking for a far off promise, but now
[2:05:27] faith is. Resurrection is not just
[2:05:30] tomorrow, but it is right now. Now is
[2:05:34] resurrection power. He said, "I am the
[2:05:37] resurrection and the life. He that
[2:05:40] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[2:05:44] yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth
[2:05:47] and believeth in me shall never die. She
[2:05:51] said, "Believe thou this?" She said,
[2:05:53] "Yeah, Lord, believeth thou this this
[2:05:56] morning?" We say, "Yes, Lord. Whoever
[2:05:59] believe in him shall not die, but they
[2:06:02] shall live." God is on a mission this
[2:06:05] morning. The dead cannot stay dead. The
[2:06:08] cannot stay crippled. The silent
[2:06:10] cannot stay silent. Oh, you got to make
[2:06:13] some noise. some Holy Ghost noise. When
[2:06:16] Jesus comes around, when Jesus is in
[2:06:19] town, he's passing by your pew. He's
[2:06:22] passing by your aisle this morning. Say,
[2:06:25] "Touch me that I'd never be the same
[2:06:29] again." Oh,
[2:06:32] touching Jesus
[2:06:34] is all that really matters this morning.
[2:06:37] Do you believe it? Give the Lord
[2:06:38] praises.
[2:06:53] Oh my.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus walked down there. Everybody
[2:07:01] walking around not sure what's going to
[2:07:03] happen. But then he spoke a word unto
[2:07:05] them. Roll away the stone. Hallelujah.
[2:07:08] Hallelujah. And they started to
[2:07:10] complain. They said, "But Lord, he's
[2:07:11] four days dead. Isn't he stinking?
[2:07:14] Hallelujah. Doesn't he stink it?" And
[2:07:15] Jesus answered unto them, "Don't you
[2:07:17] believe the word that I said unto you?
[2:07:20] Oh, roll away the stone. Don't you
[2:07:22] worry. Something is about to happen. But
[2:07:24] I need to get doubt out of the way. I
[2:07:27] need to get fears out of the way because
[2:07:29] what's about to happen? There can be no
[2:07:32] restrictions. God has to get everything
[2:07:34] out because his glory is getting ready
[2:07:36] to be manifested. His power is getting
[2:07:39] ready to be manifested. God is getting
[2:07:41] ready to do something. Oh, that no eye
[2:07:43] has seen that no ear has heard. Oh, nor
[2:07:47] can it produce this morning. Oh,
[2:07:50] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe
[2:07:52] it?
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Life is getting ready to come forth.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Because life is getting ready to come
[2:07:57] forth. Doubt and fear cannot occupy the
[2:08:00] same space. We got to have faith in this
[2:08:03] place this morning. Roll away your
[2:08:05] stone. Roll away all your ideas. Roll
[2:08:09] away all your fears. Roll away all your
[2:08:12] worries. Roll away all your mind
[2:08:14] battles. Roll away all your hindrances.
[2:08:17] It might take a great effort this
[2:08:19] morning, but I challenge you to do it.
[2:08:22] Do something about your deliverance. Do
[2:08:24] something about your breakthrough.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen. When God is getting
[2:08:30] ready to do something, he is the God
[2:08:32] that is unlimited in his power. But he
[2:08:35] always makes a way for you to
[2:08:37] participate in your own miracle. God
[2:08:40] wants you. You don't hear me this
[2:08:41] morning. God wants you to participate in
[2:08:45] your own miracle. He wants you to
[2:08:47] participate in your own breakthrough, in
[2:08:50] your own deliverance. There's something
[2:08:52] you've got to do. Martr had to roll away
[2:08:55] the stone in order to see Lazarus come
[2:08:58] back from the dead. In order to see
[2:09:00] water turn to wine, somebody had to go
[2:09:03] and draw the water pots. Somebody had to
[2:09:06] go do the job. In order for you to see a
[2:09:09] miracle, God has you had to participate
[2:09:12] in your own miracle. If you want to see
[2:09:14] the valley full of ditches, you got to
[2:09:17] dig ditches. Oh, if you want to see them
[2:09:19] full with water, if you want to see a
[2:09:21] miracle in your life, then there's
[2:09:23] something you've got to do. You've got
[2:09:26] to pray. You've got to cry. You've got
[2:09:29] to call on God. You've got to get next
[2:09:32] to God. You've got to do the job. You've
[2:09:35] got to do the work. There's something
[2:09:37] you've got to do. You've got to get
[2:09:38] sanctified. You've got to get next to
[2:09:41] God. Throw out all the TV. Throw out all
[2:09:44] the trash. Throw out all the internet.
[2:09:46] Throw out every distraction, everything
[2:09:49] that would hinder you uh from getting
[2:09:51] your blessing, from getting your
[2:09:52] breakthrough, from getting your miracle,
[2:09:55] you've got to roll it away. Roll away.
[2:09:59] Roll away grudges. Roll away this trial,
[2:10:02] that circumstance, what this one did to
[2:10:05] you, what that one did to you. Roll it
[2:10:07] away this morning. Say, "Lord, I'm
[2:10:10] getting it out of my mind cuz I need a
[2:10:13] miracle this morning. And my need is
[2:10:15] greater than my stone. Roll away your
[2:10:18] stone. My need is greater than my stone.
[2:10:21] My need is greater. What I want from God
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; is more important
[2:10:28] than the stone that is in front of me.
[2:10:32] and I won't let it hinder me
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; from what God is about to do
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; in my life. Isn't that right?
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Believeth thou this.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; So Gyrus daughter
[2:10:50] coming back around to this. Getting
[2:10:52] ready to rounds up. Amen.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Do you love him today?
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; And while he yet speak
[2:11:02] He was just b busy ministering to the
[2:11:05] woman who touched him who had the blood
[2:11:08] issue. That's right.
[2:11:11] She was just finished ministering to her
[2:11:12] and saying, "Go in way. Go in peace. Thy
[2:11:14] fate has made thee whole. Go in peace
[2:11:16] and behold of thy plague." While he was
[2:11:19] yet saying this, a second report come.
[2:11:22] Why trouble is the master? But he told
[2:11:24] him, "Don't be afraid. Only believe."
[2:11:26] And from that point on, he took three
[2:11:28] men with him. Peter, James, and John.
[2:11:31] And he said, "Come with me." That's not
[2:11:33] the first time he took those three men
[2:11:35] with him. Praise God. Isn't that right?
[2:11:37] Praise God. But he took these men with
[2:11:39] him. Hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[2:11:41] Because they had faith to see what was
[2:11:42] about to happen next.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; He needed faith atmosphere to be in
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; because something was about to break
[2:11:48] forth.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; And when he come down to the scene, he
[2:11:51] we meet awake. Things are moving very
[2:11:54] quickly. They have already stopped the
[2:11:55] clocks in the house. They've already
[2:11:58] throw the sheet over the girl. They've
[2:11:59] already beun to prepare the biscuits and
[2:12:01] to prepare the the they begun to send
[2:12:04] out RSVPs and notes letting everybody
[2:12:06] know that our daughter is dead and
[2:12:08] there's no more hope. The Bible said he
[2:12:10] came and found a tumult a tumultuous
[2:12:13] situation. Uh people are weeping in a
[2:12:16] corner. Someone is is grieving in a
[2:12:18] corner. Someone is washing up the sick
[2:12:20] bay and the sick bed and the cloths
[2:12:22] because there's no more hope now. And
[2:12:24] this is the hopeless condition
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; that Jesus comes down to meet down in
[2:12:28] Gyrus's house.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; He come down there to meet awake. He
[2:12:32] heard that she was in the edge of death.
[2:12:34] Now she's at death. It's beyond that
[2:12:37] point now. Hallelujah. It took him a
[2:12:39] while to get there, but Jesus always
[2:12:41] gets there. And he gets there on time.
[2:12:44] It might seem as if he's late, but don't
[2:12:47] you worry. He is right on time. He is
[2:12:50] right on schedule. Sometimes God wait
[2:12:53] until things seem impossible. Sometimes
[2:12:56] God wait until things seem out of cater,
[2:12:59] until things seem out of hand. But with
[2:13:02] God, all things are possible. Everything
[2:13:05] is in his hand. He is right in control.
[2:13:09] He is right in charge. He's still on the
[2:13:12] throne this morning. Whatever you need
[2:13:14] this morning, he's still on the throne.
[2:13:17] Whatever sickness, whatever challenge
[2:13:19] you are facing this morning, God is
[2:13:22] still on the throne.
[2:13:25] And he's still able to do something
[2:13:28] about your condition this morning. Oh,
[2:13:30] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:13:32] Hallelujah. Isn't that right?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, and he said, "Why
[2:13:37] make ye this a do and weeping and so
[2:13:39] on?" He said the damsel is not there
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; but she is sleeping
[2:13:44] and the Bible said they laughed him to
[2:13:46] scorn.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; He let them laugh.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; He let him laugh cuz sometime you laugh
[2:13:51] the first time it sounds sweet but but
[2:13:53] it gets sweeter the second time and the
[2:13:55] third time. And they laughed until he
[2:13:57] his name was a disdain. They laughed him
[2:14:00] until he was a heretic. until he could
[2:14:02] be seen as no more than just a a mad man
[2:14:05] who has come long after the fact to try
[2:14:08] to do something about a situation that
[2:14:10] is too far gone to do anything about.
[2:14:13] But with God, all things are possible.
[2:14:16] And he didn't say what he said idly. He
[2:14:19] is a God that could speak and could back
[2:14:21] up what he speaks. Oh, she is not dead.
[2:14:25] She is sleeping. Not only that, I'm
[2:14:27] going to prove that she is sleeping. We
[2:14:30] have come to wake her up from sleeping.
[2:14:34] Oh, isn't that right? And they laughed
[2:14:35] him to scorn. But the Bible said when he
[2:14:38] had put them all out, he get rid of
[2:14:41] them. He taketh the father and the
[2:14:43] mother. Oh, let them be witnesses of
[2:14:45] what is about to happen. If nobody want
[2:14:47] to believe, you sit here and see the
[2:14:50] works of God. And the mother and the
[2:14:52] father and Peter, James, and John in
[2:14:54] their was in the room with him. And he
[2:14:57] took the damsel by the hand, and he said
[2:14:59] unto her, "Damsel, I say unto thee,
[2:15:03] arise." And straight away, the damsel
[2:15:06] arose and awaits, for she was of the age
[2:15:10] of 12 years. Oh, and she rose from the
[2:15:13] dead. Oh, hallelujah. May you rise from
[2:15:17] your ashes this morning. Oh, may you
[2:15:20] rise from the newness of life. Oh, he
[2:15:22] promised to deliver you. He promised to
[2:15:25] restore you. Isn't that right? And the
[2:15:28] bride today, she is sleeping. She's in a
[2:15:31] state of slumber. She's in a state of
[2:15:33] coma toes. In this message, the Bible
[2:15:36] says while the bridegroom tarried,
[2:15:38] musician can get ready. While the
[2:15:40] bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered
[2:15:43] and they all slept. And the prophet said
[2:15:45] here, he said, "No, that's the reason
[2:15:46] today that revivals were supposed to
[2:15:49] have that denomination's revivals. We
[2:15:52] haven't had a real stirring. No, no, no,
[2:15:54] no. Don't think we've got revivals. We
[2:15:57] haven't. They've got millions and
[2:15:59] millions of church members, but not a
[2:16:01] revival nowhere. There are churches,
[2:16:04] churches, brides, brides all over the
[2:16:06] world, but there's no revival nowhere.
[2:16:09] The bride hasn't had a revival yet.
[2:16:13] There's been no revival. There been no
[2:16:16] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[2:16:19] yet. We are looking for it now. The
[2:16:22] prophet said it will take those seven
[2:16:25] unknown thunders back there to wake her
[2:16:29] up again. He will send it. He promised
[2:16:33] it. Oh, and that's what we're waiting
[2:16:36] on. No other life could work in this
[2:16:39] bride. But these seven mysterious
[2:16:41] thunders have got to thunder to the
[2:16:44] bride. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:16:47] Once more this world will hear direct
[2:16:50] from God. Oh hallelujah.
[2:16:55] That's the life that will work in you
[2:16:58] that will raise up what was once dead
[2:17:01] and quicken into life ever more. He said
[2:17:04] listen here. He'll send it. He'll
[2:17:06] promise it. You can begin to stand. He
[2:17:07] said now watch. He said there was voices
[2:17:10] but all how we need in Jeffersonville is
[2:17:13] thousands of live voices. That's the
[2:17:15] thunder of God. Thundering out in
[2:17:18] sweetness and holiness and purity.
[2:17:21] Undefiled lives walking around in the
[2:17:24] earth today. You can play something
[2:17:25] softly. Without a blemish. Yes, sir.
[2:17:29] Real Christians. That's the thunder
[2:17:31] against the enemy. The devil don't care
[2:17:33] how loud you can holler. The devil don't
[2:17:36] care how much you can jump, how much you
[2:17:37] can do or this or shout. But what hurts
[2:17:40] the devil is to see that sanctified holy
[2:17:43] life consecrated to God. Say anything to
[2:17:46] him. Call him anything. Just as sweet as
[2:17:49] it can be and move right on. Oh my. That
[2:17:53] throws him away.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's the thunder that'll shake the
[2:17:57] devil. Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe it
[2:18:00] this morning? Amen. Amen. He said,
[2:18:02] "Well, just like you could say he could
[2:18:04] preach like Billy Graham or Roberts,
[2:18:06] some great influential speaker." He
[2:18:07] said, "No, the devil. No, no, no. The
[2:18:09] devil just laughs at that. He don't pay
[2:18:12] no more attention to that than nothing.
[2:18:14] You can get all the theology you wanted
[2:18:16] to and all the seminary training
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; and the devil just sit back and laugh at
[2:18:21] that.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; But when he sees that life,
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; oh my, that's what makes the difference.
[2:18:27] He said, look at those disciples down
[2:18:28] there, that maniac child with epilepsy
[2:18:30] saying, "Come out of him. Come out of
[2:18:32] him, devil. Come out of him." The devil
[2:18:33] just sat there and said, "Aren't you
[2:18:34] making a pretty shame of yourself?" He
[2:18:36] said, "Jesus told you to cast me out,
[2:18:38] and not one of you can do it." He said,
[2:18:40] "But brother, when they see him come,
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; one come walking quietly." Uh-uh. Oh my.
[2:18:45] He didn't have to say nothing.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; That devil was already scared right
[2:18:50] then. He knew he had to leave right
[2:18:53] because here come alive. Not only a
[2:18:56] sermon, but a life. And it said, "Come
[2:18:59] out of him, oh my." And that done it
[2:19:02] quietly. And he knowed what he was
[2:19:04] talking about. He knew what he was
[2:19:06] doing. May the Lord bless you this
[2:19:08] morning. I'm finished. May you come to
[2:19:12] life in your time and season. May God
[2:19:14] bless you as we sing and worship the
[2:19:16] Lord. Amen. God bless you as you come.
[2:19:19] Let's lift our hands and worship him.
[2:19:21] Let's lift our hands and praise him.

[2:19:25] and live in me, dear God. Father, is
[2:19:27] that your prayer today? Lift up your
[2:19:29] hands and just worship him right now.

[2:19:33] need you, Jesus. I need your presence. I
[2:19:36] need your power. I need your spirit. Oh,
[2:19:39] hallelujah. Live me this morning. Glory
[2:19:43] to God. Grant it, oh God. Amen.

[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; What a faith message and encouragement
[2:38:34] that don't look with your eyes. It's not
[2:38:38] what your eyes see. It's through the
[2:38:40] eyes of God. I was astonished when I saw
[2:38:42] how God saw Israel as his son. Tell
[2:38:45] Pharaoh that's my firstborn. Let him go
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; that he might serve me. And God want you
[2:38:51] to serve him. That's the reality. Let's
[2:38:53] bow our heads and close our eyes.
[2:38:56] Amen.
[2:38:58] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[2:39:00] presence. We thank you for your son and
[2:39:02] servant. But Anthony O'Brien, may you
[2:39:04] visit him, recharge him. Lord, bless him
[2:39:06] in a special way. He and his wife and
[2:39:08] family. And oh God, may you bless your
[2:39:10] people now as they go to their homes.
[2:39:12] May your presence be with them in a
[2:39:14] special way. such a sobering message
[2:39:16] that in the midst of different
[2:39:18] situations, we could still see Jesus
[2:39:20] coming our way, coming down and we have
[2:39:24] to have that faith. Jesus had to get rid
[2:39:26] of so much people to get them out all
[2:39:28] that negativity to get them out of the
[2:39:30] room. Get them from away from that girl
[2:39:33] 12 years old needing a miracle. And
[2:39:36] father, it was done. I say unto thee,
[2:39:38] arise. She just spoke it and it was
[2:39:40] done. Father, may we leave here on
[2:39:42] speaking condition with you. Bless your
[2:39:44] sons and daughters. Bless your children
[2:39:46] here in our midst. Bless the people who
[2:39:49] are not feeling well or whatever. May
[2:39:51] they be touched by the angel. In Jesus
[2:39:53] name we ask it. Amen and amen and amen.
[2:39:56] God bless you as brother Jesus comes and
[2:39:58] please close us in some songs as we
[2:40:00] dismissed. Amen. God bless you. Praise
[2:40:01] the Lord.
[2:40:04] [Music]
[2:40:06] You have a seat.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:13] Oh, we
[2:40:15] must work
[2:40:17] while it is there,
[2:40:21] spreading
[2:40:23] the word of God as we walk along the
[2:40:27] way,
[2:40:30] willing
[2:40:34] to do his will,
[2:40:38] spreading
[2:40:40] the word of God till it reaches
[2:40:43] throughout the hill.
[2:40:46] We must witness to everyone we meet. And
[2:40:50] in every song we sing,
[2:40:54] we must tell them the sooncoming
[2:40:59] king. Just pause one minute. You know,
[2:41:01] as you sing that song, that's a
[2:41:02] beautiful song. When last have you
[2:41:04] testified to somebody?
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; When last have you invited somebody?
[2:41:09] When last have you given somebody a word
[2:41:11] from the Lord? to encourage them to come
[2:41:12] out to hear the word of God. I want to
[2:41:15] encourage you to do that because God
[2:41:18] have to work. But Anthony said God spoke
[2:41:21] to the waters to bring forth creatures.
[2:41:24] He spoke to the earth to bring forth the
[2:41:26] beasts. God is speaking to you through
[2:41:29] you that there'll be other sons and
[2:41:31] daughters. Somebody testify to you. Who
[2:41:34] are you testifying to?
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:41:40] we
[2:41:41] shall work
[2:41:44] while living in this day,
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; spreading
[2:41:50] the word of God as we walk along the
[2:41:55] way,
[2:41:57] willing
[2:42:01] to do his will.
[2:42:06] spreading the word of God till it
[2:42:10] reaches throughout the hill.
[2:42:14] We must witness to everyone we meet and
[2:42:18] in every song we sing.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; We must tell them about the soon coming
[2:42:26] king.
[2:42:29] Oh, sing in me.
[2:42:33] word
[2:42:35] just while it is
[2:42:39] spreading
[2:42:41] the word of God as we walk along the way
[2:42:48] willing
[2:42:52] to do his will.
[2:42:56] spreading
[2:42:58] the word of God till it reaches
[2:43:01] throughout the hills.
[2:43:04] We must witness to everyone we meet. And
[2:43:08] in every song we sing,
[2:43:12] we must tell them of the soon coming.
[2:43:18] [Music]
[2:43:21] The harvest is plentiful,
[2:43:25] but the laborers are few.
[2:43:29] There are so many jobs in God's vineyard
[2:43:33] for all of us to do.
[2:43:37] We must witness to everyone we meet. And
[2:43:41] in every song we sing,
[2:43:45] we must tell them all of the soon
[2:43:49] coming.
[2:43:52] God bless you.
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:44:28] [Music]
[2:44:35] Heat. Heat.
[2:44:39] [Music]
[2:45:16] Hey.
[2:45:19] [Music]
[2:46:06] Ah,
[2:46:08] [Music]
[2:46:11] heat.
