[11:40] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[11:42] that you present your bodies a Living
[11:44] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[11:47] is your reasonable
[11:57] sin confed this world but be transformed
[12:01] by the renewing of your mind that you
[12:03] may prove what is that good and
[12:05] acceptable and perfect will of
[12:17] God 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse
[12:24] 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where

[12:41] changed into the same image from glory
[12:44] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[12:55] Lord Galatians 4:19
[13:00] Paul
[13:01] speaks my little children of whom I
[13:04] travail in birth again until Christ be
[13:08] formed in

[13:19] prayer heavenly father I thank you to be

[13:49] elderly and stir up the young people

[13:54] Us in Jesus name I
[13:56] ask amen and amen amen
[13:59] God bless you my SE want to than brother
[14:04] uh precious brother
[14:08] ber giving me this invitation to be
[14:11] here this opportunity to be
[14:14] here okay so I have a
[14:16] title how can we be formed into the word
[14:20] image
[14:22] question Friday
[14:24] night you're
[14:27] predestinated to be formed
[14:31] before I get into
[14:33] it I just want to make a bridge from
[14:35] Friday to
[14:38] today Hebrews
[14:40] 4 Paul
[14:42] speaks there remain therefore AR rest of
[14:44] the people of
[14:47] God for he that enter into his
[14:51] rest had SE some his own
[14:55] works as God did from him
[14:59] then he said these words let us labor
[15:04] therefore to enter into that
[15:08] rest that rest for us is Charity it is L
[15:16] love it's a
[15:19] labor from
[15:22] Faith to enter into
[15:24] charity do you get me now there a
[15:27] struggle
[15:29] it's a
[15:31] labor you are laboring with a
[15:35] faith which is which is with
[15:38] Revelation that is not real to you yet
[15:41] by
[15:43] experience in other words you have
[15:46] revelation we have
[15:49] Revelation but it's not real yet by
[15:53] experience the prophet said what is
[15:57] feet Fe is
[16:00] something that is revealed to
[16:02] you but is not
[16:05] yet but you believe it will
[16:08] be so when God spoke to
[16:12] Abraham Abraham had a
[16:15] revelation but he couldn't show nobody
[16:18] Isaac he didn't have an
[16:21] experience to produce the
[16:23] revelation of what he had so I have an
[16:27] inspiration from
[16:30] Revelation to
[16:32] experience Mary received the word from
[16:35] the
[16:36] angel but it was not real to her in
[16:40] experience without any
[16:42] sensation she ran and give a
[16:45] testimony I'm going to have the
[16:48] Messiah so there is a
[16:51] revelation and there is the
[16:53] experience now brother bam said Paul had
[16:57] an intellectual faith
[17:00] but he didn't have Divine
[17:02] Faith there's quite a
[17:05] difference between intellectual
[17:07] faith and divine Faith Divine faith is
[17:12] divine
[17:13] revelation is When Heaven reveals
[17:17] it in intellectual
[17:20] faith is your knowledge or our
[17:23] understanding and our thoughts about the
[17:26] matter and removing by faith
[17:29] that's intellectual
[17:31] Faith he says what it must
[17:33] be a divine
[17:37] revelation that come out of the
[17:39] heart so the intellectual
[17:42] faith is not good
[17:46] enough but it only brings you to the
[17:48] Holy
[17:50] Spirit but the holy spirit is a personal
[17:53] experience of the
[17:56] bir so the intellectual faith
[17:59] brings you up to the Holy
[18:01] Spirit but the holy spirit is by
[18:05] experience oh give the Lord some
[18:07] Praises so you can understand
[18:10] now how Moses with
[18:14] knowledge or
[18:16] information or
[18:17] Revelation from his
[18:20] mother of his
[18:23] calling when he killed that man in
[18:27] Egypt he run for his life because he
[18:31] only had an intellectual
[18:34] conception but when that same
[18:37] man met the pillar of
[18:39] fire that was an
[18:41] experience that changed what he
[18:44] has for intellectual faith into divine
[18:48] revelation and that transformed that
[18:51] man that change that man so when you
[18:55] move from revelation
[18:58] to
[18:59] experience it changes you oh praise the
[19:03] name of the Lord are you getting it
[19:05] now Satan knew the
[19:09] Bible he knew the word he said but say
[19:12] he was like a walking
[19:15] Bible but Jesus knew where he was
[19:18] standing so
[19:20] Satan CAU the
[19:22] word talk the word preach the word does
[19:27] revelation
[19:29] because if he had a
[19:31] revelation he never touched
[19:33] Jesus he said if th be if th be because
[19:38] he didn't know and Jesus said it's also
[19:43] written get behind me
[19:45] Satan so said Satan knowed by
[19:51] knowledge but Jesus noted by
[19:55] experience he noted by revelation
[19:59] so friends you have got to go beyond
[20:03] text and Beyond the word
[20:06] letter and come to divine
[20:10] revelation that takes you into an
[20:13] experience now Faith claims it
[20:17] now now Fai
[20:20] is
[20:22] Hope could hinder you because you're
[20:25] hoping for it to
[20:27] happen but it says it is mine I claim it
[20:33] I claim my
[20:34] children I claim my healing this morning
[20:39] I claim my
[20:40] Deliverance this morning I claim my
[20:44] breakthrough this morning hope
[20:47] says God said so I'm expecting this
[20:51] somay I'm expecting it
[20:54] someday but Faith you have it right now
[20:59] I'm I'm say reading it's your personal
[21:03] property it's your work it's your
[21:06] personal
[21:08] property that's what faith is is that
[21:12] right so Faith stands
[21:14] up and takes over and
[21:17] rues when Faith
[21:20] speaks everybody keeps
[21:23] still bam he say on
[21:27] record say this with all my
[21:30] heart if any man if any person will take
[21:35] the right mental
[21:38] attitude towards any Divine
[21:41] promise that God has
[21:44] made it will bring it to
[21:47] pass it's the attitude towards what he
[21:51] said so you could understand
[21:54] now like the Bible said all heard Moses
[21:58] his
[21:59] word but most of
[22:02] them the word that they
[22:05] heard will not mixed with
[22:07] faith and because of that it had no
[22:11] effect upon
[22:13] them so you could sit here and just sit
[22:17] here you could sit here and just here
[22:21] with your ear if there a lecture coming
[22:23] to you but if you mix what you are
[22:26] hearing
[22:29] fath it becomes a
[22:31] reality in your
[22:33] spirit because faith is a
[22:37] substance Oh Glory to
[22:40] God is not
[22:42] empty
[22:43] expel is a
[22:45] substance of what you're hoping
[22:48] for hallelujah
[22:50] hallelujah is the money of the bread you
[22:54] have to
[22:55] purchase you're hungry
[22:58] you you don't have bread but somebody
[23:01] give you
[23:02] money you're still hungry you can't eat
[23:05] the money but the money is the
[23:08] purchasing
[23:09] power to get the bread so when they get
[23:12] the money you can sh you can praise God
[23:17] you can smile because you have the
[23:20] purchasing power to get what you
[23:24] want glory to God hallelujah oh oh
[23:28] Hallelujah brother is trying to bring a
[23:31] certain Faith to the
[23:33] people a certain Faith so that they
[23:36] could get some of the
[23:38] promises effective to them so here what
[23:41] he said here now I have seen Saka
[23:46] cancer leave people by the same
[23:50] thing now
[23:52] maybe you won't able to receive it
[23:56] enough just to deliver you all of of a
[24:00] sudden so maybe you might not that great
[24:02] fith to get that breakthrough for the
[24:04] cancer or the tumor or whatever to
[24:07] be so you bring an
[24:10] alternative but I might say
[24:14] tonight I want to talk to you a
[24:17] moment and say this if you can't receive
[24:21] enough
[24:23] Faith to be healed
[24:26] instantly then you take the adopted baby
[24:32] root did you ever hear about adopting a
[24:37] baby if you take a young
[24:39] woman and she's married and she and a
[24:44] husband she is scared she isn't going to
[24:46] have a
[24:49] baby she wants one but she's
[24:52] scared and job said the things that I
[24:56] fear must come upon me
[25:00] you take that same
[25:02] woman and let her adopt a
[25:05] baby and then she'll have
[25:08] one it quiets
[25:13] her if you haven't got enough
[25:16] Faith to receive now as a
[25:19] miracle then take the adopted baby
[25:24] attitude explain what that is
[25:28] say

[25:34] I'll go from here
[25:36] tonight praising you just the same as I
[25:40] was
[25:42] well so you may be
[25:44] sick but if you take the adoped baby
[25:47] root thank you Lord for healing
[25:49] me thank you Lord for delivering me I am
[25:52] praising
[25:53] you if you don't praise him you don't
[25:57] believe
[25:59] because Abraham St
[26:01] not at the promise of God to
[26:07] unbelief so God promises is
[26:11] true but says can we walk up
[26:15] there and take a hold of God's
[26:19] promise and say it is

[27:58] here are some comments I want to share
[27:59] with
[28:01] you the season of
[28:04] adoption is
[28:06] coming first for fivefold
[28:10] Ministry adoption
[28:13] Time by Dynamics to the
[28:16] mechanics to go
[28:19] out with the ministry of Jesus
[28:22] Christ these
[28:24] men these adopted men
[28:28] these
[28:29] sons who was going to be
[28:32] adopted would have the Father's
[28:35] Love
[28:37] approval and
[28:40] Confirmation these time tested
[28:44] son would have been formed into the word
[28:48] image capped by the Capstone of
[28:54] Love they would have this ministry of
[28:57] perfection
[29:00] for the Bride of Jesus
[29:02] Christ this

[29:07] International because it would be to the
[29:10] body of
[29:12] Christ the
[29:14] manifestation of
[29:16] Dynamics would
[29:18] identify that the season is here so I
[29:21] just want to finish off on

[29:42] image so your
[29:44] purpose that God put you
[29:46] here is to get you back to the image
[29:51] that man fell from because God said let
[29:55] us make man in our image
[29:58] and in our
[30:00] likeness God has
[30:02] purpose and he will not cancel that
[30:06] purpose he has purpose that you are

[31:58] and he knew all
[32:00] things but we bypass
[32:03] that you come like
[32:05] Adam you come like me you come from
[32:10] attribute the
[32:12] flesh to be
[32:14] tempted oh we missed the word that's why
[32:19] we have to be
[32:20] tempted oh let's go again we have never
[32:24] become the
[32:26] word we just become
[32:29] fleshman not the word which makes it
[32:34] clear you will never be the
[32:37] word unless you were a thought at the
[32:41] beginning that proves the predestination
[32:45] of
[32:45] God because the word is a thought
[32:50] expressed so in God's
[32:52] mind in the back part of his
[32:55] mind you are a seed
[32:58] a gene a
[33:01] GM
[33:02] attribute the back part of his
[33:05] mind this was before the
[33:09] beginning Oh Glory to God because in the
[33:13] beginning what's the word but before the
[33:16] beginning what the thought or the
[33:20] attribute Satan he came in the
[33:24] beginning but you you were before the
[33:27] beginning
[33:28] in his mind in his thinking and that is
[33:32] why I talk
[33:34] about because will take Faith to take a
[33:37] hold of
[33:38] it God give it I claim it and it is mine
[33:44] I believe it I receive it that I was in
[33:48] God's
[33:49] thinking if I was a
[33:51] thought I can become the
[33:54] word because the word is a god Express
[33:59] to God so if you have to be formed into
[34:03] the word
[34:04] image means you have to be a
[34:08] thought in God's
[34:11] mind stop looking at your
[34:13] flesh stop looking at
[34:16] your I am preaching to you

[38:11] to
[38:14] Hallelujah you
[38:19] see this thing sweet
[38:21] you and my friend in Grenada will say
[38:24] eat it nice
[38:28] this this word is eat nice taste
[38:32] good you say in order to stand
[38:36] Temptation listen to these words now in
[38:39] order to stand
[38:42] temp you had to bypass your
[38:47] theophany we're going to find out why
[38:49] that
[38:50] is you had to come down in
[38:53] flesh to be tempted by sin
[38:59] I'm I'm I'm still reading these are not
[39:01] my
[39:02] thoughts but you byass
[39:05] the and become flesh
[39:08] man to be tempted by
[39:11] sin and when this
[39:14] body receives the spirit of
[39:17] God The Immortal Life inside of
[39:20] you shows this body in
[39:26] subjection won have to
[39:28] say if I could just quit
[39:34] drinking just get into
[39:37] Christ because your
[39:39] body is subject to the
[39:42] spirit and your
[39:45] body becoming subject to the
[39:48] spirit try to live the right kind of
[39:52] life and when you become subject to that
[39:55] spirit
[39:57] it throws your whole being subject to
[39:59] that
[40:02] Spirit are you
[40:03] ready and that
[40:06] spirit is nothing in the
[40:09] world but the seed word made
[40:14] manifest or
[40:18] Quicken Jesus said the words that I
[40:22] speak they are spirit and they are life
[40:26] so Jesus Jesus released the
[40:29] spirit in word
[40:32] form so when you receive the
[40:35] seed God has just turn the
[40:39] switch and that word turn into
[40:43] Spirit that's why Jesus said the kingdom
[40:47] is within
[40:48] you because the word is within you and
[40:51] when the word turn to
[40:54] Spirit you in the Kingdom you're not
[40:57] looking for the kingdom the kingdom is
[41:00] in you give the Lord
[41:02] pra so when people reject the
[41:05] word they reject the spirit so the
[41:09] foolish
[41:10] virgin hallelujah hallelujah they
[41:12] couldn't get the
[41:13] oil they didn't have that word in them
[41:16] to turn into the
[41:18] spirit Oh Glory to
[41:20] God remember we told you the Holy
[41:25] Spirit fell on the Pentecostal
[41:29] they couldn't come to
[41:30] Perfection they couldn't manifest Christ
[41:33] they manifested gifts because the word
[41:36] was
[41:36] lacking and the word comes to the
[41:39] prophet and they reject the
[41:41] prophet now the word is what forms the
[41:44] word
[41:46] image image has to be created from the
[41:50] word
[41:51] itself the PC
[41:54] that so God couldn't adopt them
[41:57] when the prophet came he brought
[42:00] on the age of
[42:02] adoption I'm going to close this part to
[42:04] wrap up
[42:07] this Holy
[42:10] Spirit pick up your pick
[42:13] up and it said this in these last days
[42:18] the true bright
[42:20] Church comes to The
[42:23] Headstone will be a super
[42:25] Church a super
[42:28] as they near the great
[42:31] headstone here we go there will be so
[42:34] much like
[42:36] him there will
[42:38] be in his very
[42:41] image in
[42:43] order to be United with him they will be
[42:47] one what you see now is not going to see
[42:51] them you see people fighting and
[42:55] struggling but the prophet
[42:58] I claim
[43:01] it it is
[43:03] mine the bride will be not maybe will be
[43:10] that's a prophecy hanging over you you
[43:13] believe you the bride do you believe you
[43:15] the bride but you have to be in his very
[43:19] image that means you have to be formed
[43:23] to the
[43:24] word Oh Glory to God here's the secret
[43:29] the word is in the
[43:30] bride and she has the mind of
[43:34] Christ to know what he has done with the
[43:38] word so that that wraps up
[43:43] Friday all right I finish Friday Part
[43:46] all right this is this morning all about
[43:52] the so God tell Samuel
[43:57] one of Jess's
[43:58] son and you know what
[44:01] happened and the tall son came
[44:04] in with that fancy suit and that cologne
[44:09] good Samuel said surely this is
[44:13] he God said hold
[44:15] it
[44:17] so not so far don't just go anint
[44:21] because the man looking
[44:25] good and you know the
[44:28] story for David
[44:30] but we choose by
[44:32] sight I'm reading God choose by
[44:38] character you see God know the
[44:41] inside hallelujah hallelujah do you get
[44:44] it now the character of the
[44:48] church is what Jesus looks
[44:50] for is not right he is looking for a
[44:55] character there we go he chooses a
[44:59] bride to reflect his
[45:02] character here we go he is looking for
[45:06] the
[45:07] day for the bride to be
[45:12] formed form you see this building
[45:16] here one day it was
[45:23] gravel that was building material
[45:27] that was not the
[45:28] building that building
[45:30] material is what was taken and formed
[45:33] this
[45:35] building so what you have got and what
[45:38] we have got by The Prophet's
[45:41] message is building
[45:45] material those
[45:47] virtues fa virtue knowledge right on up
[45:54] that's building
[45:55] material but the same building
[45:58] material have to be
[46:03] formed you don't take a bag of
[46:07] c and it up in the
[46:09] air and say building it doesn't build so
[46:14] have to mix
[46:15] it
[46:17] gravel water you have to
[46:20] labor have to lay the brick Brick by
[46:24] Brick come on to me
[46:28] come you got to labor Oh Glory to
[46:34] goduck Virtue by virtue hallelujah
[46:39] hallelujah is looking for the
[46:41] day prophecy that the bride for the
[46:44] bride to be
[46:46] formed Hebrews
[46:48] it just like he
[46:50] was he's got to be the same
[46:53] flesh Same
[46:55] Spirit and until the church becomes
[46:59] that they not
[47:02] one so therefore how could the Holy
[47:05] Ghost behave in one
[47:08] man and
[47:11] misbehave in another
[47:14] man something is
[47:17] wrong the Holy Ghost canot behave in
[47:19] one and misbehaving the other because
[47:23] the Holy Ghost will conform your nature
[47:28] his nature the
[47:30] Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's
[47:35] go he said I know your
[47:39] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[47:41] your
[47:44] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[47:46] so many
[47:49] people they
[47:51] wonder if God really loves
[47:55] them how can God be
[47:58] just and L
[48:01] him if he stands by and watches his
[48:04] people
[48:07] suffer you see they could not figure out
[48:10] God's
[48:12] love are you ready
[48:14] Church they
[48:16] thought that love meant no
[48:20] suffering they thought that love meant a
[48:24] baby with parental care
[48:29] but God
[48:31] said his love was elective
[48:35] love the proof of his
[48:38] love is
[48:40] election no matter what happen his love
[48:43] have
[48:44] proven that God has chosen
[48:47] you to
[48:49] Salvation to the sanctification of the
[48:52] spirit and the belief of Truth
[48:57] he may commit you to
[48:59] death as he did Paul he may commit you
[49:03] to
[49:04] suffering as he did
[49:06] job that is his
[49:09] prerogative he is
[49:11] Sovereign but it is all with a
[49:14] purpose listen to this if he did not
[49:18] have a
[49:19] purpose then he will be the author of
[49:22] [Music]
[49:24] frustration and not peace
[49:27] are you ready his purpose is that after
[49:32] we suffer a while we would be made
[49:36] perfect come on now Hallelujah don't
[49:39] pull back don't pull back
[49:44] after
[49:48] suffer glory to God hallelujah
[49:51] hallelujah be made
[49:53] perfect be established
[49:57] strengthen be
[49:59] settled oh
[50:04] myre 8 speaking about Jesus though he
[50:09] were a
[50:10] son here we go yet he learned he
[50:14] [Music]
[50:15] obedience by the things which he
[50:19] suffered or Prophet or
[50:22] evangelist we talking about Jesus he
[50:25] learned
[50:28] come on now we we wasn't born
[50:32] obedience we wasn't born children of
[50:35] God of
[50:37] God because all have
[50:41] sin so don't play
[50:44] self-righteous all
[50:46] have and come short of the
[50:49] glory but Jesus
[50:54] OB in plain language
[50:57] the very character of
[51:00] Jesus was perfected by
[51:03] suffering and according to
[51:06] Paul he has left his
[51:09] church a measure of
[51:12] suffering that they
[51:14] too by their faith in
[51:17] God while suffering for
[51:20] him would come to a place of
[51:24] perfection then the question was
[51:27] why did he want
[51:29] this
[51:30] answer James 1
[51:34] 2-4 you ready for
[51:36] it my brethren count all
[51:40] joy you quiet the
[51:43] place my brethren counted all
[51:47] joy when you fall into divver

[51:58] patience
[52:00] patience have a perfect
[52:03] work that you may be perfect and
[52:07] entire wanting
[52:09] nothing why does he do that Romans eight
[52:14] if

[52:19] God if we claim to be
[52:23] children

[52:27] you have inheritance then you have
[52:30] property you have land you have money
[52:32] you have
[52:33] houses something because you

[52:40] says for I
[52:43] reckon that the
[52:45] suffering of this present
[52:49] time are not worthy to be
[52:53] compared with the

[1:01:30] pit men I don't even know if they
[1:01:33] Sav because you're not seeing any
[1:01:36] Christlike you're seen a Waring
[1:01:39] Spirit unprincipled
[1:01:42] spirit and they hate the sovereignity of
[1:01:46] the local
[1:01:47] church they hate that because if they
[1:01:50] pull that
[1:01:51] off then they can come and take
[1:01:54] over preach it
[1:01:56] because God love it because that's how
[1:01:59] the nian
[1:02:00] Spirit come in the
[1:02:03] beginning big churches try to conquer
[1:02:06] smaller
[1:02:07] churches and then they take the
[1:02:09] anointing from the people and put it on
[1:02:12] a
[1:02:14] message I call it a message
[1:02:16] Po and a message po everybody supposed
[1:02:20] to follow this
[1:02:26] from rooms and he on in the

[1:02:35] character is f to
[1:02:38] rule and the little temporary
[1:02:41] suffering that we go through

[1:02:46] compared with the glory that we
[1:02:48] revealing
[1:02:50] us when he comes get start isn't it
[1:02:54] strange
[1:02:56] that God wants us to develop Christ like
[1:03:01] character that comes through
[1:03:04] suffering no sir and we all have
[1:03:08] trial we are all tried and chasen
[1:03:12] as here this bum the
[1:03:16] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:03:19] being

[1:10:00] prove my love to
[1:10:02] him and I think my church know this
[1:10:04] thing by
[1:10:06] Heart by believing what he
[1:10:09] said and by conducting
[1:10:12] myself with
[1:10:14] joy amidst the
[1:10:17] trial he in his
[1:10:20] wisdom allows to come to pass
[1:10:25] amen so that
[1:10:28] means next
[1:10:30] service everybody inside of him should
[1:10:33] be coming here with

[1:10:37] joy
[1:10:39] everybody because whatever you're going

[1:10:47] with
[1:10:48] David David said I was glad when they
[1:10:53] said unto me let us go
[1:10:56] into the house of the
[1:10:57] Lord so the goal of God is a Christlike
[1:11:02] character producing the fiery fness
[1:11:06] of naked I came into the
[1:11:09] world but naked we shall not go we will
[1:11:13] take our

[1:11:33] patience there is absolutely no other
[1:11:35] way to gain
[1:11:38] patience it has to come by the
[1:11:43] tri and a Fai that is not
[1:11:47] tested cannot be
[1:11:50] trusted so if you claim to have
[1:11:54] faith was in a prophet to turn our
[1:11:58] hearts back to the Fai of the
[1:12:00] father it has to be a
[1:12:04] tested that becomes an approved

[1:29:37] had to leave because here come a life
[1:29:41] not a sermon but a life he said come out
[1:29:45] of him so listen to this this is where
[1:29:48] the real Ministry comes
[1:29:51] in the ministry of Jesus Christ but Ram
[1:29:54] says the church is
[1:29:56] weak we are broke
[1:29:58] up but that is the way it's supposed to
[1:30:02] be so don't open big we break up we
[1:30:05] broke up
[1:30:07] kind he said that's is how it's supposed
[1:30:11] to broken up
[1:30:13] but we need there will come a
[1:30:16] message and listen to these words now we
[1:30:20] need the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:30:24] fit The Headstone
[1:30:27] y soat
[1:30:30] man talking about Ephesians
[1:30:32] 4 you say remember don't try to take the
[1:30:36] other man
[1:30:37] office some evangelist some
[1:30:40] pastors some
[1:30:42] teachers for the Perfection of the
[1:30:46] Saints who are the Saints sanify one for
[1:30:50] the working of the
[1:30:52] ministry and then brand
[1:30:54] slip in a
[1:30:56] mystery for Revelation right
[1:30:58] here for the working of the
[1:31:00] ministry the ministry of Jesus
[1:31:04] Christ so men who claiming to be def
[1:31:08] fightful
[1:31:10] Ministry they can't claim
[1:31:12] that they have to have deep
[1:31:15] Ministry of Jesus
[1:31:17] Christ you're hearing about speak
[1:31:22] from this is Ministry God give
[1:31:25] me but I have to be placed
[1:31:30] positionally with the ministry of Jesus
[1:31:33] Christ to be effective in
[1:31:37] Ministry so right now I am doing the
[1:31:40] work of a
[1:31:41] pastor for almost 40 years
[1:31:44] whatever waiting to be placed by
[1:31:47] Dynamics I can't place
[1:31:50] myself because God steps in the church
[1:31:54] not man
[1:31:55] appoint when God
[1:31:59] man do you understand that when God put
[1:32:02] you in position and put his stamp upon
[1:32:04] you your sign just as good
[1:32:07] as GL God as
[1:32:11] God who you H is
[1:32:14] H who you fire is
[1:32:17] fir are you with me all right am now
[1:32:21] watch he said billing he said now watch
[1:32:24] it start with faith and virtue and so
[1:32:26] right then we are waiting for the
[1:32:30] headone which is love and he
[1:32:33] controls and he's the strength of every
[1:32:35] one of these
[1:32:37] things all right okay so Peter said here
[1:32:41] first seven
[1:32:42] things Faith to
[1:32:45] love and then the watch and then the
[1:32:47] love of God the Holy Ghost after adding
[1:32:51] all these seven things
[1:32:54] Christ in the person of the Holy
[1:32:57] Ghost comes upon
[1:33:00] you in the true baptism of the Holy
[1:33:03] Ghost and you got all these virtues SE
[1:33:06] to
[1:33:07] you when when a man possesses these kind
[1:33:12] of
[1:33:13] things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:33:17] him no matter you might speak with
[1:33:21] tongue and but until these virtues go
[1:33:24] into
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:26] you and when these virtues grow in watch
[1:33:30] words now every word is
[1:33:32] important and you add it to that then
[1:33:34] you become a living
[1:33:37] Monument then begin to pray and this is
[1:33:40] for the five
[1:33:42] Ministry Build Me Up Oh Lord into
[1:33:45] this let Christ be my
[1:33:47] head working on the foundation my
[1:33:51] faith let virtue
[1:33:54] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:33:59] and brotherly kindness working me oh
[1:34:02] lord is my
[1:34:03] prayer live or
[1:34:05] die sink or
[1:34:09] drunk friend or no
[1:34:11] friend let Christ
[1:34:15] virtue his
[1:34:17] knowledge flow
[1:34:21] out flow out that I might be able to
[1:34:25] teach
[1:34:27] those so in other words God have to
[1:34:32] empower the
[1:34:34] ministry with
[1:34:36] virtue and knowledge the flo of the
[1:34:40] people no we cannot give what we don't
[1:34:44] have we have to have it to give it not
[1:34:48] have it just by
[1:34:50] Revelation but have it by experience
[1:34:53] expence Oh Glory to God now Jesus said
[1:34:57] as many have received
[1:34:59] him the word to them give
[1:35:03] power to become the sons of God so
[1:35:07] virtue right after
[1:35:09] Faith it's a power it's a spirit to make
[1:35:13] you add the rest of the life Oh Glory to
[1:35:17] God so watch this let me finish this
[1:35:20] here for God has set in the church
[1:35:25] prophets teachers and so
[1:35:27] on what for for the
[1:35:30] perfecting are you ready and bringing
[1:35:33] all these virtues into
[1:35:36] it for that
[1:35:39] Perfection of the coming of the Son of
[1:35:41] God so the fight for Ministry is to
[1:35:44] bring these
[1:35:45] virtues into you so you got stay
[1:35:49] home and be perfected reading book
[1:35:55] there's got to be a f
[1:35:56] Minister
[1:35:58] stand to minister to you because the
[1:36:01] spirit picks up what you have
[1:36:03] need hallelujah hallelujah the spirit
[1:36:06] know exactly what you have
[1:36:07] need Oh Glory to God and the
[1:36:12] spirit way to to that is that the man
[1:36:18] his Minister Spirit dropping down to
[1:36:21] speak
[1:36:23] hallelujah hallelujah the prophet
[1:36:26] says when these things are operated in
[1:36:29] you then you are
[1:36:31] sealed Oh Glory to God that is where
[1:36:34] Visions
[1:36:35] come it's operating in you so the
[1:36:40] ceiling is the
[1:36:42] evidence that the word image is
[1:36:45] formed the spirit is
[1:36:47] here to operate it now you can operate
[1:36:51] it by revelation
[1:36:53] I let say this way you know husband and
[1:36:55] wife
[1:36:56] talking and they
[1:37:00] quarreling and there's a knock on the
[1:37:04] door
[1:37:06] witness God
[1:37:09] bless
[1:37:12] just so in other words according to who
[1:37:15] comes by the
[1:37:16] door hallelujah
[1:37:19] hallelujah but it wasn't Hallelujah
[1:37:21] inside there
[1:37:24] you see you operating
[1:37:25] it you play nice guy you play nice girl
[1:37:30] but when they start to operating
[1:37:32] you by the spirit it's different for
[1:37:37] example when the two people was making
[1:37:39] love in the
[1:37:44] church said to him if you say blind
[1:37:47] they'll be
[1:37:48] blind if it's a de they will
[1:37:51] die whatever I'm give some Cho

[1:38:07] option and then come and give a
[1:38:09] testimony speak the
[1:38:11] word and they die in
[1:38:16] church
[1:38:18] muscles with power see why God not
[1:38:20] giving them
[1:38:22] power watch this

[1:43:40] spot in order to stand
[1:43:43] Temptation you have to bypass your tea
[1:43:46] off and to become
[1:43:49] fresh to be tempted by sin
[1:43:53] that's why you are
[1:43:56] here the fold
[1:43:59] Ministry Pastor Prophet
[1:44:01] ET by the ministry of Jesus
[1:44:04] Christ through the ministry of Jesus
[1:44:08] Christ will bring the
[1:44:10] bride to
[1:44:13] Perfection by
[1:44:15] horning or
[1:44:17] shaping the
[1:44:19] bride into the wood image
[1:44:23] of Jesus Christ these are my
[1:44:26] words which blueprint is
[1:44:29] form in second Peter
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:34] 14 and as you start to be formed to the
[1:44:36] world
[1:44:38] image the Dominion of
[1:44:40] sin will release his grip off of
[1:44:44] you as you start to be
[1:44:47] shaped the
[1:44:48] grip that the devil have on
[1:44:52] you take his hands off because you're
[1:44:55] being
[1:44:55] formed you're being shaped because the
[1:44:59] Bible says that we shall be changed from
[1:45:02] glory to glory to glory even as by the
[1:45:06] spirit of the Lord Oh Glory of God the
[1:45:10] glory of Fai the glory of
[1:45:13] virt to back off towards
[1:45:17] your towards the image you are growing
[1:45:21] there some people only getting all in
[1:45:23] the
[1:45:24] message they're not changing the grow is
[1:45:27] to learn to learn is to grow have to
[1:45:31] change have to be better than last year
[1:45:35] come on back to me you want to be a
[1:45:37] better
[1:45:38] man
[1:45:39] Hallelujah that's what God
[1:45:42] tell I found a better
[1:45:45] man was good
[1:45:53] God you are being changed from glory to
[1:45:57] glory and still
[1:46:00] hold is broken off of
[1:46:03] you
[1:46:05] says Abraham
[1:46:07] calling Isaac
[1:46:10] election Jacob
[1:46:12] Grace
[1:46:13] Perfection nothing against him that is
[1:46:17] God working his way
[1:46:19] out and he said Luther Lu Wesley Wesley
[1:46:25] Pentecost the
[1:46:27] Capone so was Abraham was Luther
[1:46:31] Faith Wesley Wesley Isaac is not right
[1:46:36] Pentecost hallelujah hallelujah Jacob
[1:46:39] Grace but the word message is
[1:46:44] perfection brought the J Perfection
[1:46:48] message because said Perfection is in
[1:46:50] Joseph that is God in you working his
[1:46:56] way hide himself in you the
[1:47:00] word working his
[1:47:02] way God you into the
[1:47:06] word blessed the Lord hallelujah
[1:47:10] hallelujah almost done God was that
[1:47:13] great
[1:47:14] spirit isn't that right no God is
[1:47:18] eternal he was perfect perfect love
[1:47:22] perfect peace
[1:47:23] perfect Joy all those seven
[1:47:27] spirits that made up
[1:47:29] God was
[1:47:31] Perfection he's talking about Elohim
[1:47:34] because before he was God he was Elohim
[1:47:38] and then when the Angels were
[1:47:39] created then he became God so before the
[1:47:43] beginning there was seven perfect
[1:47:46] Spirits the Fountain of God in those
[1:47:50] Spirits was your thoughts was you the je
[1:47:54] isn't that right and the prophet said
[1:47:57] and the only way we can come back to
[1:48:00] Perfection is to come after to that
[1:48:03] Perfection which is God oh glory to God
[1:48:07] patience tested don't you
[1:48:11] worry Satan will K them for
[1:48:13] you I I'm adding virtual
