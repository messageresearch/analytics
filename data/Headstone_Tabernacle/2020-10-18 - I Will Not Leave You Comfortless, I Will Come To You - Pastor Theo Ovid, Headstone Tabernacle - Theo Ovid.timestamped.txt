[38:09] uh before we get into the word i
[38:12] have something i'd like to share with
[38:13] you uh
[38:16] i preached a message on the sunday 20th
[38:19] september
[38:20] and the message was judgment is set a
[38:23] time
[38:24] of lingering a space of grace
[38:28] and i i truly believe the lord put it
[38:31] upon my heart
[38:32] to present that word to you i feel uh it
[38:35] was a word from the lord
[38:37] and i got a testimony and we didn't read
[38:39] it but
[38:40] this testimony i was given my brother
[38:42] terrence and i want to share it with you
[38:44] now
[38:45] he said dear brother to you i just
[38:47] wanted to give this testimony concerning
[38:49] the message you preach on sunday
[38:50] twentieth
[38:51] twenty twenty about three weeks ago
[38:54] while i listened to the message called
[38:56] heisen and simplicity
[38:57] albuquerque new mexico the anointing of
[39:00] the holy spirit
[39:02] could have been felt coming off the tape
[39:03] while brother branham
[39:05] was exhorting the church to receive the
[39:07] holy ghost
[39:08] i had a tremendous experience in the
[39:10] spirit
[39:11] and after the service the holy spirit
[39:14] put it on my heart
[39:15] to call you and tell you that after you
[39:18] preach your message you should play this
[39:20] part
[39:21] of the tape so that the prophet could
[39:23] exhort
[39:24] and inspire the believers to get
[39:26] desperate to receive the baptism of the
[39:28] holy ghost
[39:29] however i never called you because the
[39:31] enemy came immediately and brought my
[39:34] battles and thoughts and saying you
[39:35] can't do that you cannot tell the pastor
[39:37] what you should do and
[39:38] that you know that'll be out of place
[39:40] and what you are looking for is
[39:42] is a good rebuke i eventually said in my
[39:45] heart
[39:45] lord he is your pastor and you have to
[39:48] speak to him
[39:49] so when you said on sunday which is the
[39:51] sunday 20th that you are finished
[39:53] and you turn on the prophet to teach the
[39:56] people
[39:57] to receive the holy ghost my mind was
[40:00] blown
[40:00] for here you are doing exactly what the
[40:03] holy spirit said you should do
[40:05] and i believe that that message was
[40:07] dossier at the spirit
[40:08] the anointing of the holy spirit was so
[40:10] real even my parrot was praising the
[40:12] lord
[40:13] i thank and praise the lord for the way
[40:15] he is using you
[40:16] to feed his sheep spiritual food and due
[40:18] season may god bless you
[40:19] when god richly bless you and your wife
[40:22] and family
[40:23] brother terrence of it oh praise the
[40:25] lord amen
[40:27] hallelujah isn't that something so i
[40:29] just felt that the lord wanted that read
[40:32] and shared with you this morning oh
[40:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[40:37] where do we go from here okay so right
[40:40] in your home
[40:40] where you are this is not the message
[40:42] yet no this is just a backdrop
[40:44] i'll just share something with you i
[40:46] want you to never to psalms 105.
[40:48] um um
[40:52] and maybe akashi we could read together
[40:55] but
[40:56] i would certainly love you to read it
[40:57] together with me right where you are
[40:59] psalms 105 says verse 1 3 4
[41:02] or give thanks unto the lord call upon
[41:05] his

[41:16] in his holy name let the heart of them
[41:19] rejoice
[41:20] that seek the lord seek the lord and his
[41:22] strength
[41:23] seek his face ever more remember his
[41:26] marvelous works that he done
[41:29] his wonders and the judgments of his
[41:31] mouth
[41:32] oi seed of abraham his servant a
[41:35] children of jacob is chosen
[41:37] he is the lord our god his judgments
[41:40] are in all the earth he had remembered
[41:43] his covenant forever
[41:44] the word which he commanded to a
[41:46] thousand generations
[41:48] which covenant he made with abraham and
[41:50] his oath
[41:51] unto isaac and confirmed the same unto
[41:54] jacob for a law
[41:55] under israel for an everlasting covenant
[41:57] singing
[41:58] unto thee will i give the land of canaan
[42:02] the lot of your inheritance when they
[42:04] were but
[42:05] a few men in number yey very few
[42:08] and strangers in it when they went from
[42:12] one nation
[42:13] to another from one kingdom to another
[42:15] people
[42:16] he suffered no man to do them wrong yea
[42:20] he reproved kings for their sake saying
[42:22] touched not my anointed
[42:24] and do my prophets no harm moreover he
[42:27] called for a famine upon the land
[42:30] he break the whole staff of bread he
[42:33] sent
[42:33] a man before them even joseph who was
[42:36] sold
[42:37] for a servant whose feet they hurt with
[42:40] fetters
[42:40] he was laid in iron until the time
[42:44] that the word came the word of the lord
[42:46] tried it may god bless his word
[42:48] god bless you and that is just something
[42:51] that
[42:52] was kind of stirring me before i didn't
[42:55] have this
[42:56] when i wanted to preach this but this
[42:57] came to me and i wanted to
[42:59] meditate a little bit upon this word of
[43:01] the lord tried him
[43:03] the word of the lord tried him and um
[43:07] it's very interesting when you
[43:10] look at things from a different
[43:12] perspective i want you to think it's not
[43:14] your wife trying you your husband trying
[43:16] your children the balls the job the car
[43:18] the this no money whatever no i want you
[43:21] to look at
[43:22] what really is doing the trying is the
[43:24] word
[43:25] i want you to think about in the
[43:26] gardener eden what was given to adam
[43:28] the word the day you eat thereof that
[43:31] day you die
[43:32] that was the word that he shared with
[43:35] his wife eve
[43:37] that was the word he gave to her isn't
[43:39] that right and
[43:40] and gave her that word and that that she
[43:42] had to hold on to now when the serpent
[43:43] came
[43:44] uh the serpent said what did god say she
[43:47] gave him the word
[43:48] the day we eat thereof that did you die
[43:51] but he put a little knot inside a deer
[43:53] and she accepted that knot all she had
[43:56] was to do was said
[43:57] you shall not you shall surely die god
[44:00] said so
[44:00] i believe it god settle it go your way
[44:03] i'm not going to change my mind
[44:05] no no you see so because it was
[44:08] twisted and she received it that brought
[44:12] her into
[44:13] a different experience that changed
[44:16] everything hallelujah a false word
[44:20] a false revelation a false light
[44:23] bringing someone into a different
[44:24] experience and she fell
[44:27] and she died now let's switch to joseph
[44:30] hallelujah god called joseph he was
[44:34] a special son he was given the wrote
[44:36] ruben of any color
[44:37] but his ordination and his placement
[44:40] was to be at the right hand of pharaoh
[44:43] now
[44:44] joseph cannot ups himself and take
[44:46] himself from the land of canaan and say
[44:48] pharaoh i come to be right hand that
[44:50] can't work
[44:51] so therefore it has to have a road and a
[44:54] process
[44:54] how to get joseph to
[44:58] his position and this is where we miss
[45:01] many a times our own experiences what we
[45:03] go through
[45:04] and why we go through them but is unto a
[45:07] purpose
[45:08] god of a destiny for your life and a
[45:10] place for your life
[45:11] and he has a process by which he gonna
[45:13] get you from where you are
[45:15] to where you supposed to be so here it
[45:18] is joseph his brethren rejected him
[45:21] he's not enemy now he's not some haters
[45:23] now this is his own
[45:24] his own brethren they reject him so much
[45:26] to the point they hated him
[45:29] to the point where they're selling more
[45:31] to egypt joseph having a rough time
[45:34] a terrible experience but is all have a
[45:36] design and a mind and
[45:38] intelligence and a purpose and an intent
[45:40] behind it to get him
[45:42] into his position joseph lands in egypt
[45:45] and he find himself working as gardener
[45:47] and get himself a promotion
[45:50] okay he was doing quite well so
[45:52] inspiring was he
[45:53] with his life in his job and his work
[45:56] that he got a promotion to head
[45:58] potiphar's house
[46:00] his wife under that spirit of lust
[46:02] pushing a move on joseph
[46:03] he rejected that because here why he was
[46:06] staying
[46:07] with the world it doesn't matter he
[46:09] jesse was tempted
[46:11] but he was aware of that word of destiny
[46:15] that was upon his life
[46:16] and that is why he run for his life that
[46:19] running
[46:20] for his life brought him into prison
[46:23] but you see he couldn't go from potiphar
[46:25] house to the right hand of pharaoh
[46:27] it doesn't work that way because pharaoh
[46:30] have a butler and a baker that jordan
[46:33] gonna meet in prison
[46:34] and the connection to pharaoh has to be
[46:37] somebody
[46:37] joseph have to meet and the only place
[46:40] he could meet that person is in fear
[46:42] in the prison and the only way he could
[46:44] get into prison
[46:45] is to be wrongly accused so god set up
[46:48] the drama
[46:49] oh glory to god the word of the lord is
[46:51] still trying
[46:52] hallelujah when he interpreted dreams of
[46:54] the bake and the butler
[46:56] and we know the story the baker was
[46:57] going to be killed the butler was going
[46:59] to be restored he told the butler
[47:01] remember me
[47:02] but joseph had a time of lingering a
[47:05] time
[47:05] of lingering to wait until god's time
[47:09] because once god time break nothing
[47:13] changed everything changed after that is
[47:15] everything normal
[47:17] joseph in prison he interpret and dream
[47:20] he could look to the bars he could
[47:22] preach his revelation
[47:24] nobody bought him with joseph it looked
[47:26] like the vision is dead
[47:28] it looked like everything flat it looked
[47:30] like it's not going to happen
[47:31] but that is not so god have an appointed
[47:35] time
[47:36] so here is joseph lingering until god is
[47:38] ready and
[47:39] when god is ready clicks turn a key
[47:42] and give pharaoh a dream and pharaoh
[47:45] called his wise men to interpret
[47:47] and then he said heads off if you can't
[47:50] come and give some revelation all these
[47:51] smart
[47:52] men in your spirit you have this
[47:53] revelation
[47:55] you have this big this vision and you
[47:56] have this and that
[47:58] come interpret this from me they
[47:59] couldn't see a p they couldn't say a
[48:01] word
[48:02] then they bought the heart was to say
[48:03] there was a man in prison
[48:06] his name is joseph and then the pharaoh
[48:09] could say
[48:09] sent for joseph so i want to show you
[48:12] something
[48:13] there was there was no other route
[48:17] for joseph to pass to get into his
[48:20] position
[48:21] and your part today glory hallelujah
[48:26] i hope you see it hallelujah
[48:29] god have a root and there is no way
[48:32] you could escape that route there's a
[48:35] certain part
[48:36] a walk a journey that you have to get
[48:40] to to get into your position so joseph
[48:42] hat was to go to prison
[48:44] to go to prison he had to pass through
[48:46] 45 experience oh glory to god to get the
[48:48] potiphar he has to be kicked out by his
[48:50] brothers
[48:51] oh glory to god and the rest speaks for
[48:53] itself
[48:54] so the word of the lord is what was
[48:57] trying him
[48:58] not his brothers hallelujah
[49:01] not potty for wife oh glory to god
[49:04] not the butler he ungrateful wretch are
[49:07] telling me go into pharaoh's right hand
[49:09] uh
[49:09] going back to be restored and look he's
[49:11] going his way no no no
[49:13] not the butler not potiphar's wife
[49:17] not his own brethren but the word of the
[49:20] lord
[49:21] because when the brethren came to show
[49:23] you how
[49:24] joseph was disconnected from the
[49:27] humanistic
[49:28] realm that have issues as to what you do
[49:31] me
[49:31] 10 years ago and 20 years ago and you
[49:34] shouldn't have done that he said
[49:35] god send me ahead
[49:39] to preserve life so joseph
[49:43] by vision and revelation could see the
[49:46] intelligence
[49:47] and the mind of god i wonder many at
[49:49] times
[49:50] how many people think what does god
[49:53] think about this
[49:55] before they do this before ministers say
[49:57] this and preach this and
[49:59] reveal this and show this and and
[50:01] whatever do they ever
[50:02] think what does god think about this all
[50:05] the political
[50:06] machinations all the manipulations
[50:10] all of that do they ever think what does
[50:13] court think about this but judgment is
[50:16] set
[50:17] and that means god changes his mind
[50:19] about that at all
[50:21] he's already set and for the bride
[50:24] a time of lingering and a space of grace
[50:28] so may may the lord bless you and i find
[50:31] that um
[50:31] it was stirring upon me that sometimes
[50:33] we don't look at this way we see the
[50:35] wife and the husband and the children
[50:37] and this and the dad and the boss
[50:39] but is it so so the wife
[50:43] commit adultery or some kind of thing
[50:45] and you come adultery too
[50:46] because no no no i did not always work
[50:50] so somebody do you something i want to
[50:52] do them back and the reason you do them
[50:53] back is because they do you first
[50:55] that is not so is what are you seeing
[51:00] are you behaving correctly this one
[51:02] costs you them because the casino cost
[51:04] them back
[51:06] that is not that using flesh and blood
[51:08] but when you see the word
[51:11] train you then you could say like job to
[51:14] your wife
[51:15] you speak like a foolish woman
[51:18] hallelujah because job understood
[51:22] it wasn't the woman it was the pressure
[51:24] and the stress
[51:25] in heaven god was boasting about job i'm
[51:28] not going past the time i was supposed
[51:30] to go here
[51:31] but i want to show you what was the
[51:32] battle there's not a man like him
[51:35] you can't make him curse me god could
[51:38] boast
[51:39] he could go through whatever but he's
[51:40] going to stay
[51:42] with the world so god bless you
[51:45] we want to stand now we want to go into
[51:47] the word i have two portions of
[51:49] scripture to read for you
[51:50] genesis 18 verse 14 and also sin john
[51:54] chapter 14 verse 12 to 26
[51:56] these are two scriptures this morning
[51:57] genesis 18
[51:59] 14 and uh
[52:02] sin john 14 who praise the name of the
[52:05] lord

[52:49] you forever even

[53:40] i will come unto him and make our board
[53:43] with him he that loveth me not keep it
[53:45] not my sayings

[54:48] the baptism of the holy spirit
[54:50] and an inspiration a personal
[54:52] appointment
[54:53] with the supernatural and i want you to
[54:56] note
[54:56] praise the lord let me just look back at
[54:58] this here and jesus was speaking
[55:00] uh here he said um
[55:03] uh i will pray the father he will give
[55:06] you
[55:06] another comforter that he may babble you
[55:09] forever
[55:10] even the spirit of truth so you

[55:28] comfort less i will come to you
[55:30] and he said at that day you shall know i
[55:31] am in the father and my and
[55:33] and he and me and i knew and he had my
[55:36] commandments and keep at them
[55:37] so he's not talking them or he give the
[55:39] holy spirit to them that
[55:41] obey him so he's not he that talk it and
[55:43] explain it and
[55:44] and share it no he that had my
[55:47] commandments and
[55:48] keeped them in other words you're
[55:50] staying with your word you're staying
[55:52] with the word
[55:53] he said uh uh you're standing in such a
[55:56] way
[55:56] that that even if you can't hear from
[55:58] god the devil can't move you
[56:00] because you're standing on the word
[56:02] you're you're able to say god said so
[56:04] so whatever whatever we are preaching it
[56:07] has to be dusty of the lord
[56:09] that's how it should be because we
[56:12] posters say god said so not the pastor
[56:14] interpreted so no but god said so that
[56:16] is thus yet alone that is the word that
[56:18] that can't fail
[56:20] heaven will pass away but that word
[56:21] can't pass away i will love him
[56:23] and will manifest myself to him okay
[56:25] what i want to get this power
[56:28] he said but the comforter which is the
[56:30] holy ghost
[56:31] whom the father will send in my name o
[56:34] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[56:36] praise
[56:37] god thank you lord jesus the comforter
[56:40] whom the father will send in my name
[56:42] thank you jesus blessed be the name of
[56:44] the lord
[56:50] he shall teach you all things and bring
[56:53] all things a remembrance
[56:54] whatsoever i've said unto you oh praise
[56:57] the name of the lord so we thank god for
[56:58] that
[56:59] that the comforter is promised and he's
[57:01] going to come
[57:02] i will come to you that abnormal fight
[57:04] for ministry and pastor and evangelist
[57:06] and apostle
[57:07] and teacher and prophet that there's a
[57:09] promise that god made isn't that right
[57:11] that the father will come to you isn't
[57:13] that why we will come to you
[57:14] isn't that right praise the name of the
[57:16] lord so but abraham says
[57:18] he says no he says no um
[57:21] this is from a message the deity of
[57:22] jesus christ he said praise god
[57:25] he said they will have a form of
[57:26] godliness but deny the power thereof
[57:28] from such turn away and they are taken
[57:31] their stand
[57:32] communism taken their stand and praise
[57:34] god the holy ghost is taking its
[57:37] turn and when the enemy come like a
[57:38] flood then it raises the standard
[57:40] against it that's right
[57:41] and the church has taken her stand i
[57:43] mean the holy ghost church
[57:45] and that's what i'm interested in
[57:47] friends oh dear i pray for the sick but
[57:49] in here
[57:50] i'm interested in one thing and that's
[57:52] the born-again church
[57:54] that is what i'm interested in i'm not
[57:57] interested in bylaws
[57:58] deacons and so forth and orders of
[58:00] churches i'm interested in the baptism
[58:03] of the holy ghost
[58:04] upon the church for this day that we are
[58:06] living in he's not talking about
[58:07] pentecost he is not about 1906. he
[58:10] talked about the baptism he goes for
[58:11] this day
[58:12] there's a promise of the holy ghost for
[58:13] this day oh glory to god can we say amen
[58:17] hallelujah for this day we are living in
[58:19] that's the fundamental part
[58:21] and that is what we are looking for
[58:24] so who is this comforter then jesus and
[58:27] he said i'll give you another comforter
[58:28] even the spirit of truth
[58:30] whom the world cannot receive because it
[58:32] needn't know it and nor
[58:33] see it him but you know him for he
[58:35] dwelled with you
[58:36] in a body of flesh now amen but shall be
[58:40] in you
[58:40] and will abide with you forever and then
[58:43] he begin to talk about a sacred trust
[58:45] you know what a trust is and his
[58:46] inheritance is a heritage
[58:48] that we inherit as believe in children
[58:50] it's a sacred trust
[58:51] the word itself is the vitamins the word
[58:54] itself
[58:55] god's word is the vitamins oh glory to
[58:57] god and he said we have a sacred trust
[58:59] to treating
[59:00] christ the word and the prayer a sacred
[59:02] trust
[59:03] like a contract inheritance a word to
[59:05] you the word
[59:06] christ and prayer is a sacred trust you
[59:09] don't want to break it as a covenant
[59:11] hallelujah is an agreement is what gives
[59:13] you access rights
[59:14] to the things and the blessings of god
[59:16] hallelujah glory to god
[59:19] and that's the reason i am so dogmatic
[59:21] as i would call it
[59:22] on standing on this word no matter what
[59:25] anybody else says
[59:26] if it's not with the word i don't
[59:28] believe it so when he says
[59:30] our church who believe the holy ghost is
[59:31] just as real as it was in the pentecost
[59:34] i will not move from that i don't care
[59:36] what mysteries a man
[59:37] reveal what mysteries a man preach new
[59:40] mysteries whatever it is
[59:41] praise god i will not move from that it
[59:44] must be
[59:44] the same holy ghost that they had in
[59:46] their pentecost
[59:48] we know it's not another pentecost in
[59:50] the weight of 120 in the upper room we
[59:52] know that
[59:53] that's that that's obvious but the holy
[59:55] ghost that they got is the same holy
[59:57] ghost you have to receive
[59:58] oh glory to god hallelujah oh my
[1:00:01] hallelujah
[1:00:02] praise god i live by the word it's our
[1:00:05] inheritance the word
[1:00:06] you say oh god let us think of it the
[1:00:09] deepness of it
[1:00:10] it's our privilege is this sacred trust
[1:00:12] that god has put to his church
[1:00:14] god give us his word the to the church
[1:00:17] and that
[1:00:17] sacred heritage is ours it's a gift from
[1:00:20] god
[1:00:21] not to just compromise on this and cut
[1:00:23] this out and throw this out and add this
[1:00:25] and to suit our own taste
[1:00:27] but to preach the full word so it's not
[1:00:30] customizing to suit the church taste
[1:00:32] and the message word taste and what the
[1:00:33] feed know is what god required this hour
[1:00:36] he said if we don't get it right we will
[1:00:38] miss the rapture
[1:00:39] we can't we can't go with rapture with
[1:00:41] all these
[1:00:42] letters and and information and no it
[1:00:45] has to have power
[1:00:46] it has to have something to take the
[1:00:48] church out oh glory to god hallelujah if
[1:00:51] this could have taken rapture
[1:00:52] if this was rapture power then we we
[1:00:56] should be rapture already
[1:00:57] if we take something more than books and
[1:00:58] tapes it will take something more than
[1:01:01] just a fightful ministry for something
[1:01:03] more than that
[1:01:04] it will take the power of god hallelujah
[1:01:06] putting men in position
[1:01:07] and there's a journey to put you in
[1:01:09] position jesus couldn't come
[1:01:11] to be before time johnny even comments
[1:01:14] on the baptized yet oh jesus is coming
[1:01:16] forward
[1:01:17] jesus had to wait he had to wait because
[1:01:20] i'm 25 years old and i have revelation
[1:01:22] now
[1:01:23] on our story books of the bible and are
[1:01:24] going down to the temple you
[1:01:26] entertainment
[1:01:27] you have to wait oh glory to god you
[1:01:30] have to watch
[1:01:31] because god were to tell him they have
[1:01:32] to have a foreigner before you
[1:01:34] oh glory to god so when john was
[1:01:36] baptized and jesus was watching what was
[1:01:38] happening
[1:01:38] he still had to wait he can't just go
[1:01:40] because john baptized and he had to wait
[1:01:42] until the appointed time because god has
[1:01:45] to talk to john
[1:01:46] and god tell john the one upon whom you
[1:01:48] see that dub descendant
[1:01:49] he gonna baptize them with the holy
[1:01:51] ghost and with fire
[1:01:52] it's not preached but there's still the
[1:01:54] word of god there's a baptism of the
[1:01:56] holy ghost
[1:01:56] on fire and no preaching or change that
[1:01:59] the message didn't change that
[1:02:02] i have no modern holy ghost and when you
[1:02:04] when he went quick unto you
[1:02:06] and mary said be done unto me according
[1:02:08] to thy word and mary get
[1:02:10] produced messiah is that right that same
[1:02:12] area to hit the upper room
[1:02:13] don't bring no kind of contrarian ultra
[1:02:16] timing dislocating the word
[1:02:18] mary said be it done on me according to
[1:02:19] your word and then she got she manifest
[1:02:21] christ
[1:02:22] is that right that same area to get in
[1:02:24] your room and stagger like everybody
[1:02:26] else
[1:02:26] and be stripped like everybody else and
[1:02:28] go to the process like everybody else
[1:02:30] to get that fire oh glory to god to get
[1:02:33] that power
[1:02:34] and there's a power promise i'm going to
[1:02:36] appreciate till i see it

[1:06:36] our eyes is on you look at the lord i
[1:06:39] shout oh glory to god
[1:06:40] our eyes is on you
[1:06:44] why is on you man
[1:06:47] that was jehoshaphatel the lord the
[1:06:50] armies are almost
[1:06:51] around us he said god look at our
[1:06:52] children everybody come out and fast and
[1:06:54] pray
[1:06:55] they stand up in the city they say oh
[1:06:57] god isn't that you the god the judge of
[1:06:59] the whole earth
[1:07:00] that you just intervene in your fears of
[1:07:02] men god look at what condition
[1:07:04] we have no condition to fight this great
[1:07:05] enemy our eyes is on you
[1:07:08] oh glory to god then the spirit of the
[1:07:10] lord came upon jehaziah
[1:07:12] and said tell them tell them tell them
[1:07:15] they don't have to fight for this battle
[1:07:18] it's not tears
[1:07:19] it is the lord's and tonight this battle
[1:07:22] is not ours
[1:07:22] it is the laws you're going to fight for
[1:07:24] us tell them
[1:07:26] oh glory to god oh god the lord i shout
[1:07:29] wherever you are
[1:07:30] oh hallelujah hallelujah the spirit have
[1:07:34] to come upon somebody
[1:07:35] who call me the god we have to hear from
[1:07:38] the spirit
[1:07:39] oh glory to god healing heart and air
[1:07:42] let them hear
[1:07:43] but the spirit sees unto the churches
[1:07:46] but what a man stood in the back room
[1:07:48] last night what the spirit
[1:07:50] said unto the churches
[1:07:54] thank you lord now
[1:07:58] he says what that's the reason if you
[1:08:01] stay with the word the way god wrote it
[1:08:03] there'll be all kind of things happening
[1:08:05] among you
[1:08:13] it's supernatural it's the power of god
[1:08:16] it's the witness of the spirit
[1:08:18] all he actually just stayed with the
[1:08:19] word and then bear reproach for the word
[1:08:22] because all that is part of the package
[1:08:24] when you get a promise you have to have
[1:08:25] a barren period
[1:08:26] you have a time of lingering a time for
[1:08:28] the mockers and the scoffers to laugh
[1:08:30] and have a good time
[1:08:31] but you're saying what god said what
[1:08:33] abraham is supposed to do
[1:08:34] when god tell him as an old man you'll
[1:08:36] have a son what that man was supposed to
[1:08:38] do but the my bible tell me he staggered
[1:08:41] not
[1:08:41] at the promise of god to unbelieve what
[1:08:43] was strong in faith given praise and
[1:08:45] glory to god
[1:08:46] what he supposed to do but give god
[1:08:48] praise
[1:08:49] because he was fully persuaded tonight
[1:08:52] are you fully persuaded
[1:08:53] that this will become dynamics to the
[1:08:54] mechanics but i am persuaded
[1:08:56] that's why i preach the way i preach my
[1:08:58] soul like a crazy man
[1:09:00] but i believe it with all my heart oh
[1:09:02] glory to god the god that
[1:09:04] was will of william branham is still
[1:09:05] alive tonight
[1:09:07] oh glory to god listen about it right
[1:09:09] i'm here
[1:09:10] that's the reason if you stay with the
[1:09:12] word the way god wrote it
[1:09:14] there'll be what kind of things
[1:09:15] happening among you every word will be
[1:09:17] fulfilled
[1:09:18] listen i'm on the expectation just
[1:09:21] myself
[1:09:22] of seeing this shaken power come on oh
[1:09:25] what i supposed to unexpect
[1:09:26] what what coronavirus shaking of the
[1:09:28] world what happened to our power
[1:09:31] what was beyond the expectation we have
[1:09:33] to have the power to shake up
[1:09:34] coronavirus and whatever the virus
[1:09:38] whatever thing had to come coming he
[1:09:40] said they go stop cancer sons of god
[1:09:42] manifested they're going to stop
[1:09:43] diseases stop it
[1:09:45] arrest it catch it or bind binders up
[1:09:48] lock it up
[1:09:49] oh hallelujah god if god can get
[1:09:53] a people under his control if
[1:09:56] he will get a man or woman that won't
[1:09:58] compromise on this word
[1:10:00] but will stand there like the rock of
[1:10:01] ages that will believe every word of it
[1:10:04] and believe that he's behind it a man
[1:10:06] who believes it you must act like it
[1:10:08] if you don't act like it you don't
[1:10:10] believe it but if you believe it
[1:10:11] act like it and you can put it to work
[1:10:14] and the word will be with you
[1:10:16] the word will be in you we lost our
[1:10:18] heritage
[1:10:19] because we compromise when we compromise
[1:10:21] we can't
[1:10:22] expect watch god to keep his promise to
[1:10:25] us
[1:10:26] because we have broken it upon the
[1:10:28] secret trust
[1:10:29] and defile the trust that god given us
[1:10:32] look at history the old testament
[1:10:33] men of god anointed full of purpose and
[1:10:36] afterwards
[1:10:36] god bless them they do this and then
[1:10:38] they screw up and mess up because they
[1:10:39] break
[1:10:40] they break the word as they break the
[1:10:42] word god could only work listen listen
[1:10:44] true his word not
[1:10:48] our feelings
[1:10:51] not our history that's why i don't go
[1:10:54] back to much in history you know
[1:10:56] church history and church history like
[1:10:57] that by history
[1:10:59] history of experiences people could say
[1:11:02] god was with them 20 years ago but could
[1:11:04] they say god with them now
[1:11:06] that the history
[1:11:11] but he's the same yesterday then forever
[1:11:14] when all them was dancing coming out of
[1:11:15] egypt they were dancing in the spirit
[1:11:17] you know
[1:11:18] the anointing all out all over them
[1:11:21] jubilee trumpet song
[1:11:23] everybody singing specials and making
[1:11:24] their own song and the music
[1:11:30] amen when they fire overseas and skype
[1:11:32] 30 years
[1:11:33] our father is it man in the wilderness
[1:11:35] and jesus said under everyone
[1:11:37] dead same god that brought them out same
[1:11:41] god judge them
[1:11:43] the message world hasn't seen judgments
[1:11:45] of god yet
[1:11:46] yet because god said begin at my
[1:11:49] sanctuary
[1:11:51] then they begin at the ancient men who
[1:11:52] were before the house
[1:11:54] that is still yet to come glory to god
[1:11:58] god
[1:11:58] judgment is lingering oh hallelujah
[1:12:01] praise god
[1:12:08] and that's what we inherit that's what
[1:12:11] we inherit is the word
[1:12:13] and in the time of strain
[1:12:16] in the time of perplexity in the time of
[1:12:20] distress
[1:12:21] in the time of perilous time they found
[1:12:24] comfort
[1:12:25] and keeping the word the word is god's
[1:12:28] comfort
[1:12:29] isn't that right hallelujah
[1:12:32] when you know that you can walk down
[1:12:35] even to the valley of the shadow of
[1:12:36] death
[1:12:37] and know that god said so you can't say
[1:12:40] why the pastor said it
[1:12:42] the church said it you can say god
[1:12:45] said so and that's the comfort we get
[1:12:48] that is where i can find comfort now
[1:12:50] that is where you found your comfort
[1:12:52] he that believeth in me though he would
[1:12:54] dead yet shall he live whosoever lives
[1:12:56] and believeth in me shall never die
[1:12:57] believers doubt this
[1:12:59] it's the comfort we get from god's word
[1:13:02] noah had met god he heard god he had
[1:13:05] god's word
[1:13:06] so it didn't make any difference what
[1:13:07] anyone had said noah had god's word
[1:13:10] so it was a comfort to him when the
[1:13:12] critics would come
[1:13:14] and was going on what they were doing
[1:13:16] criticizing him we laughing at him
[1:13:18] it was enough to discourage him
[1:13:20] everybody coming back and saying look up
[1:13:21] in the hill
[1:13:22] that fanatic what the hell sitting what
[1:13:23] he's building what kind of outfit is
[1:13:25] that
[1:13:26] what is the business out of it's
[1:13:28] nonsense yet the
[1:13:29] comfort noah had because it was god's
[1:13:32] word
[1:13:33] it was a comfort he knew god said so
[1:13:36] noah had a consolation that while he was
[1:13:39] building this
[1:13:40] while he was making this act he knew
[1:13:42] that he was comforted
[1:13:44] because he had the word of the lord that
[1:13:45] told him that's the instructions
[1:13:47] what if someone said noah what do you
[1:13:49] mean by building that ultra gopher wood
[1:13:51] you know that would if there would water
[1:13:53] it would first thing it would sink
[1:13:55] but noah was following instructions god
[1:13:58] said go forward
[1:13:59] god eat believe it go for wood watch
[1:14:01] this go they tell him go forward
[1:14:02] and pitch in him he said go forward
[1:14:07] rather continue and keep walking until
[1:14:08] we further revelation come to put pitch
[1:14:10] in that
[1:14:11] now if god one day argue with god god
[1:14:13] this were there good
[1:14:14] this would have this the word and he
[1:14:15] complaining and complaining you see
[1:14:17] he he something wrong with noah but no
[1:14:20] bullet would go forward
[1:14:21] because i was so absorbent to get the
[1:14:23] pitch because god given
[1:14:24] revelation after revelation in his
[1:14:26] timing
[1:14:27] when you have reason to see it when you
[1:14:29] have reason to know it
[1:14:31] when you have reason for it to be
[1:14:32] unfolded to you he's going to unfold it
[1:14:34] so you have to lock god's neck for
[1:14:36] something oh glory to god he will reveal
[1:14:38] it
[1:14:38] he's going to unfold it he's going to
[1:14:40] confirm it he's going to manifest it
[1:14:42] he said it oh glory to god amen
[1:14:47] all right you love him this morning
[1:14:50] oh glory to god moses had a
[1:14:52] responsibility of two million people
[1:14:55] when he let him out of egypt how he's
[1:14:56] going to feed two million people women
[1:14:58] pack a little bunch and
[1:14:59] kneaded bread on top their head for 40
[1:15:02] years of their journey
[1:15:03] how he's going to feed them how many
[1:15:05] babies could be born each night in a
[1:15:06] group of people like that
[1:15:07] how many all and in film how many
[1:15:09] clothes will wear out where will i get
[1:15:11] clothes where will i feed them
[1:15:13] he said mo they said god said so surely
[1:15:15] i'll be with you
[1:15:16] god had to tell him i will send manner
[1:15:18] god was arranging everything up front
[1:15:20] or give the lord a shout we just have to
[1:15:22] walk in obedience and god going to open
[1:15:24] up the windows of heaven and bless you
[1:15:27] all glory to god hallelujah glory to god
[1:15:32] thank you lord jesus hallelujah
[1:15:35] all these heroes but abraham says they
[1:15:38] could look back and see
[1:15:40] where the one kept the word and was
[1:15:41] comforted and this one
[1:15:43] he looked back and seen he followed the
[1:15:45] word and come out and was comforted
[1:15:47] it was promised but listen brother one
[1:15:49] day
[1:15:50] that word was made flesh oh glory to god
[1:15:54] that's it that word was made flesh
[1:15:57] that comforting word that word of
[1:16:00] comfort
[1:16:01] was made flesh hallelujah in the form of
[1:16:03] a man
[1:16:04] the word of god that brought comfort was
[1:16:07] made a man here among us
[1:16:08] we could handle the word in our hands we
[1:16:10] could shake hands with the word of god
[1:16:12] he was the word in the beginning was the
[1:16:14] word and the word was with god
[1:16:16] and the word was god and the word is
[1:16:18] made flesh and well among us that word
[1:16:20] was
[1:16:20] god was made flesh the comforter he
[1:16:23] lived on earth we see that he was the
[1:16:25] word
[1:16:26] he acted like god he looked like god he
[1:16:29] preached like god
[1:16:30] he he like god he was god in every
[1:16:32] manner he was god
[1:16:34] hallelujah what a comfort it was to
[1:16:36] those galileans
[1:16:37] oh my and then they see him go up to
[1:16:39] calvary the son of man go up jerusalem
[1:16:42] put hands in hands of sinful men how
[1:16:44] could they stand it
[1:16:45] their heart was broken they were really
[1:16:47] depressed they was all in gloom
[1:16:49] isn't that right but then look at the
[1:16:51] promise he made i will not leave you
[1:16:53] comfortless
[1:16:54] oh glory to god i will not leave you
[1:16:55] comfortless i will pray the father
[1:16:58] he will send you another comforter oh
[1:17:01] glory to god
[1:17:02] which is the holy ghost and he will
[1:17:03] abide with you forever
[1:17:05] so first the only word word word word
[1:17:07] word then the word will become flesh
[1:17:09] i know the word made flesh prophesy i
[1:17:12] will not give you comfortless but i'm
[1:17:13] gonna come to you
[1:17:14] the person coming to you know i am going
[1:17:17] to come to you
[1:17:17] so my person coming to you know some
[1:17:20] bishop some message pope
[1:17:21] no i will come to you or give the lord a
[1:17:25] shout
[1:17:25] it's the same eye that told abraham i
[1:17:28] will certainly return unto thee
[1:17:31] according to the time of life
[1:17:33] and savior shall have a son or give the
[1:17:36] lord a shout it was no man coming
[1:17:38] it was power coming dynamics coming the
[1:17:41] holy ghost coming
[1:17:42] oh give the lord a shout no wonder jesus
[1:17:44] told them behold i
[1:17:45] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:17:47] but carry me
[1:17:48] to jerusalem until you be endured power
[1:17:51] from on high
[1:17:53] power
[1:17:56] then what is that word today what is our
[1:18:00] comfort today
[1:18:01] is when we receive the baptism of the
[1:18:04] holy ghost
[1:18:06] and the power of the living god living
[1:18:09] in us
[1:18:10] what i'll read it again what is the word
[1:18:13] of god
[1:18:14] what is our comfort today is when we
[1:18:17] receive
[1:18:18] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:18:20] power
[1:18:21] of the living god lives in us that is
[1:18:24] when the word
[1:18:25] of the living god we stand that word is
[1:18:27] made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:18:29] now that same word that was made flesh
[1:18:32] and dwelt among us has become our flesh
[1:18:34] he is with you now but he shall be in
[1:18:37] you
[1:18:37] now that same word that the prophet
[1:18:40] spoke that same word
[1:18:41] that are made flesh that same word
[1:18:43] dwells in the church therefore if we
[1:18:45] don't compromise that word
[1:18:47] we stay right with it if we don't
[1:18:49] compromise it that same word living in
[1:18:51] you
[1:18:52] will produce the same thing that it did
[1:18:55] when he was made flesh because your
[1:18:58] flesh holds it
[1:19:00] your flesh holds it don't remember the
[1:19:03] word was invisible until
[1:19:05] it became flesh so how a man could claim
[1:19:08] the word made flesh word in him calling
[1:19:10] him and
[1:19:10] not a sign or a wonder you wonder about
[1:19:13] that
[1:19:14] that's the only one they'd have you know
[1:19:16] you wonder how that could be as
[1:19:18] they claim so it means that the claim is
[1:19:20] false
[1:19:22] because when omnipotent speaks the
[1:19:24] miraculous take place
[1:19:26] and miraculous is the confirmation of
[1:19:28] omnipotence
[1:19:30] that's the only way he knows omnipotence
[1:19:31] a man standing talk and talk and explain
[1:19:33] and explain he could say for us
[1:19:35] that don't have to be omnipotent
[1:19:36] speaking that could be a head intellect
[1:19:38] running like crazy
[1:19:40] but when now nibbled and speaks that is
[1:19:42] logos
[1:19:44] hallelujah the fire of god speaking the
[1:19:47] word of god
[1:19:48] hallelujah then miraculous must take
[1:19:50] place
[1:19:51] oh hallelujah what abraham said
[1:19:55] almost again therefore if we don't
[1:19:56] compromise with that word we stay right
[1:19:58] with it
[1:19:59] if we don't compromise it the same word
[1:20:01] living in you
[1:20:02] will produce the same thing that it did
[1:20:04] when it was made flesh because your
[1:20:06] flesh
[1:20:06] holds it that's the reason visions can
[1:20:09] break through the song barrier
[1:20:10] that's the reason a vision can break
[1:20:12] through time barry and say
[1:20:13] thus here the lord it shall be so and so
[1:20:16] that's the way it is what is it the word
[1:20:19] coming forth from a spirit you see me
[1:20:22] you do not see me you see my body you
[1:20:24] don't see me i don't see you
[1:20:25] because i only see your body this is my
[1:20:27] hand but who is me
[1:20:29] that owns the hand this is my buddy but
[1:20:31] who is me it's a spirit
[1:20:32] and if i'm born again if you are born
[1:20:35] again
[1:20:36] it is god's holy spirit god's
[1:20:39] word living in us and if we compromise
[1:20:43] don't compromise upon this word and say
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:46] if we compromise upon this word and say
[1:20:48] we have the spirit of god
[1:20:49] how can we claim to have god's spirit
[1:20:51] when god's spirit testify of his own
[1:20:53] word
[1:20:54] that is why when the holy spirit told
[1:20:55] the prophet pick a pen and write he said
[1:20:57] no one can make the bride do otherwise
[1:21:00] so they could talk they talk and walk
[1:21:01] the talk but they can't make the baby
[1:21:02] otherwise
[1:21:03] because she have dust saved the lord or
[1:21:05] she keeps still
[1:21:06] you hear what he might have not an
[1:21:08] interpretation you know just say
[1:21:10] the lord or keep still so the bride
[1:21:13] could find
[1:21:13] god said so god said so god says oh your
[1:21:16] pastor says so that he
[1:21:17] say so but i want to hear what god say
[1:21:20] oh glory to what does the bible say oh
[1:21:23] hallelujah isn't that right
[1:21:25] so watch he will never move an inch from
[1:21:28] it no matter what denominations say
[1:21:30] or he's going to move from it when it's
[1:21:31] god's own word i'll be with you
[1:21:34] the comforter you shall send the
[1:21:36] comforter and they gather in the upper
[1:21:37] room
[1:21:38] and they wait a dear until the day of
[1:21:40] pentecost isn't that right
[1:21:42] for precept must be upon c precept
[1:21:44] isaiah 28
[1:21:45] and he that's what he said he would do
[1:21:47] paul referred to the epistles
[1:21:49] of man with other lips would he speak to
[1:21:51] the people and when the holy spirit came
[1:21:53] it came exactly with the word and when
[1:21:55] it comes again
[1:21:56] here we go when it comes out again
[1:21:59] when it moves into a church that's born
[1:22:02] again
[1:22:02] it will come with the power and
[1:22:04] demonstration of its
[1:22:06] being not more talk we had
[1:22:09] 50 years of mechanics 50 years of
[1:22:11] revelation teachers ministries
[1:22:13] 50 years of man in the hour and who
[1:22:15] super and one more revelation and mighty
[1:22:17] teacher
[1:22:17] and nobody could teach like them and
[1:22:18] nobody could apostle like them and
[1:22:20] nobody could evangelize like them and
[1:22:21] nobody could profit like them whatever
[1:22:22] it is
[1:22:23] all that passed for 50 years but you see
[1:22:25] this here
[1:22:26] when the holy ghost comes it comes with
[1:22:29] the power
[1:22:30] and demonstration of its being not a man
[1:22:33] by the purpose sorry
[1:22:34] number six is out it's being oh glory to
[1:22:38] god he talked about the thunders coming
[1:22:39] forward he said he is him moving
[1:22:41] in and out and then you're worshiping
[1:22:43] the living christ him
[1:22:45] moving in and out among you i know man
[1:22:47] man the pulpit
[1:22:48] plain messiah i'm playing god
[1:22:52] hallelujah hallelujah play in the holy
[1:22:56] ghost
[1:22:57] hallelujah think about it now only man
[1:22:59] couldn't be holy she's a pope
[1:23:00] and that's a liar oh hallelujah man
[1:23:03] playing holy ghost holy ghost is the
[1:23:04] holy ghost
[1:23:05] it's not right don't shut yourself up in
[1:23:07] the cells of some organization like a
[1:23:09] seller somewhere
[1:23:10] an unbelief to the nine gods word i
[1:23:12] don't care what the bishop or anybody
[1:23:13] say
[1:23:14] let the word come in you made flesh
[1:23:17] by the power of the holy ghost and take
[1:23:19] over your flesh and control you
[1:23:22] and testify through you the works and
[1:23:24] the mighty powers of the living god
[1:23:26] that's right no matter what the churches
[1:23:27] say
[1:23:28] those denominations only put you in a
[1:23:30] cellar and you are hiding himself from
[1:23:32] the blessed sunlight i know that to be
[1:23:34] the truth
[1:23:35] do you want to stay in that cellar
[1:23:36] nobody does don't get in that cellar
[1:23:39] come out in the sunlight come out where
[1:23:41] the word can
[1:23:42] take the word and believe the word and
[1:23:44] the word will manifest itself to you
[1:23:46] and manifest itself through you and
[1:23:48] manifest his word bringing it to pass
[1:23:50] if we expect god to keep his word if we
[1:23:53] expect god
[1:23:54] to do the things for us that we are
[1:23:55] asking we will never be able to do it
[1:23:58] till we get back
[1:23:59] and obey what god said we have got to go
[1:24:02] back
[1:24:02] where we left off at we have got to go
[1:24:04] back to pentecost how much time the
[1:24:06] prophet said that what is he talking
[1:24:07] about you know the word seals
[1:24:11] the breaking of the seals back to
[1:24:13] pentecost the seals come to bring us
[1:24:15] back to pentecost
[1:24:17] because the seals was the scattered word
[1:24:19] that he had to tie up
[1:24:20] and bring it tight up into the wood to
[1:24:22] bring down the holy ghost
[1:24:25] so this breaking of the seals was not
[1:24:27] because he seals as a mystery
[1:24:29] are we so beyond pentecost right now you
[1:24:31] know it come like saying we don't need
[1:24:32] justification because i was looter
[1:24:34] we don't need signification that was
[1:24:35] wrestling we don't need pentecostal
[1:24:37] experience that was pentecost we just
[1:24:39] need a word
[1:24:40] oh yeah the word is consist of
[1:24:42] justification
[1:24:43] sanification and the holy ghost the word
[1:24:45] consists of all of that
[1:24:46] so you can't say because you have the
[1:24:48] word you don't need justification you
[1:24:49] have to be justified
[1:24:51] as if you never did this you have to be
[1:24:52] sanctified god god wants a holy life
[1:24:54] yeah god god ain't coming to unsung
[1:24:56] divine vessel you have to be satisfied
[1:24:58] so you need wesley you need looter you
[1:25:00] need pentecost you need your whole thing
[1:25:01] is i will restore in four stages oh
[1:25:04] glory to god hallelujah isn't that right
[1:25:07] luther justification where's the
[1:25:08] signification the pentecostal but from
[1:25:10] the holy ghost
[1:25:11] and the protagonist brought the word
[1:25:12] elijah the word come to the prophet
[1:25:14] isn't that right no we have the word now
[1:25:16] we can see what the stature is of a
[1:25:18] perfect man now we can see what
[1:25:19] perfection is
[1:25:20] now we can see what the vision is and
[1:25:22] fit everything into the vision
[1:25:23] oh glory to god so tight devil can't
[1:25:25] move you you're seeing
[1:25:27] now we could press towards the mark of
[1:25:28] the high calling because we see the mac
[1:25:30] now the only time he wasn't seeing no
[1:25:32] mark you see in church but when you see
[1:25:33] the mark of the eye calling
[1:25:35] then you know where you're pressing on
[1:25:36] to then you know what you could
[1:25:38] there onto
[1:25:38] then they're gonna always get locked in
[1:25:40] onto they get focused
[1:25:41] oh glory to god when you're not focused
[1:25:44] here everywhere everywhere everywhere
[1:25:46] everywhere everywhere no focus you can't
[1:25:47] hit the targets at all
[1:25:48] when you're shooting arrows every
[1:25:51] successful business
[1:25:53] everybody who i've achieved have
[1:25:54] somebody who have the pinpoint focus
[1:25:57] you're all focused where you're going
[1:26:00] you have to have focus
[1:26:04] hallelujah i think was the guy who was
[1:26:07] working on the light
[1:26:08] when they had a light bulb how much how
[1:26:10] much
[1:26:11] wrong thing he made how much how much
[1:26:12] mistakes how much how much things

[1:26:27] next man working on the telephone he was
[1:26:29] here he could communicate man we could
[1:26:31] do this thing
[1:26:32] now if these guys didn't run ahead and
[1:26:34] make a way we couldn't be where we are
[1:26:36] right now with the phone
[1:26:38] if the right brothers then go ahead and
[1:26:39] say you know boy this this car thing we
[1:26:41] could get up in the air
[1:26:42] somebody have to try it of course the
[1:26:44] first thing crashed of course people
[1:26:46] laugh at them look at them but they're
[1:26:47] trying to play bird

[1:27:27] happy to be on the expectation for a
[1:27:30] revival or glory to god who want to be
[1:27:32] dead
[1:27:32] when you could get a revival oh glory to
[1:27:34] god oh you said whenever you have a
[1:27:36] strike jesus god wash the dishes oh
[1:27:38] glory to god
[1:27:39] hallelujah people don't talk about that
[1:27:42] another one would revive another mono
[1:27:45] would revive her
[1:27:46] i talk about what he said a revival is a
[1:27:49] move of god in power
[1:27:51] a move of who of god not a movement man
[1:27:54] he said god is suffering he have a right
[1:27:56] to start a revival he can stand a
[1:27:57] revival right here this morning oh glory
[1:28:00] to god with such a few people inside of
[1:28:01] here and you leave your soul revive and
[1:28:03] so charge up people want to know what
[1:28:04] happened to you
[1:28:05] oh glory to god hallelujah thank you
[1:28:07] lord jesus
[1:28:09] let's continue a little bit now
[1:28:12] we believe that after a person being
[1:28:15] justified by faith
[1:28:17] he has peace with the lord jesus christ
[1:28:20] but it's possible
[1:28:22] that this same person could have habits
[1:28:26] such as drinking smoking
[1:28:29] doing things that he should not do
[1:28:32] filthy
[1:28:32] habits of the flesh then we believe
[1:28:36] that the blood of jesus christ
[1:28:39] sanctifies this person for the service
[1:28:41] of the lord
[1:28:43] and we believe in sanctification
[1:28:45] according to hebrews 13 12 where jesus
[1:28:48] also
[1:28:49] that he might sanctify the people with
[1:28:51] his own blood
[1:28:52] suffered without the gates and we
[1:28:54] believe that sanctification
[1:28:56] is taught in the new testament and meant
[1:28:59] for the believers through the new
[1:29:00] testament age which
[1:29:02] we are now living in we also believe
[1:29:06] that after the person has been
[1:29:08] sanctified
[1:29:10] the unclean habits are gone from the
[1:29:12] person
[1:29:13] he is a believer on the lord jesus
[1:29:15] christ his habits are gone
[1:29:18] we believe that then he is a candidate
[1:29:23] for the baptism of the holy spirit oh
[1:29:25] glory to god when i
[1:29:27] hear that terminology hallelujah
[1:29:29] becoming a candidate
[1:29:30] for the baptism of the holy ghost after
[1:29:33] justification
[1:29:34] after sanctification after heart has
[1:29:36] prepared made ready
[1:29:38] you're ready you are candidate for the
[1:29:40] baptism
[1:29:41] of the holy ghost go give the lord some
[1:29:43] praises hallelujah
[1:29:45] which comes as a filling for the
[1:29:49] believer
[1:29:50] and then when the believer many times i
[1:29:53] have taught it like picking up a glass
[1:29:55] out in the chicken yard
[1:29:57] justification is picking it up ready to
[1:29:59] use it with a purpose in heart
[1:30:01] that's what god does to the sinner he's
[1:30:03] still filthy then he is cleansed by the
[1:30:06] blood of jesus christ
[1:30:07] and the word sanctify is a compound word
[1:30:09] which means
[1:30:10] clean and set aside for service and in
[1:30:13] the old testament the
[1:30:15] altar sanctified the vessel it was set
[1:30:18] aside for service
[1:30:19] then we believe that the holy spirit is
[1:30:22] put in
[1:30:23] the same vessel in service
[1:30:26] that the holy spirit is not another step
[1:30:29] of grace
[1:30:30] but more of the same grace that fills
[1:30:33] the believer
[1:30:34] to the extent here we go that signs
[1:30:37] and wonders such as the apostolic gifts
[1:30:39] spoken of in first corinthians 12.
[1:30:42] the filling to the extent that it
[1:30:45] produces the signs
[1:30:47] wonders such as the apostolic gifts
[1:30:49] spoken
[1:30:50] in first corinthians 12 manifest
[1:30:52] themselves
[1:30:53] true disbeliever when the holy spirit
[1:30:56] comes in to take up the gift
[1:30:58] i believe that the scripture teaches
[1:31:00] that gifts and call in the world
[1:31:02] repentance
[1:31:02] that when we are born in this world we
[1:31:05] are sent here
[1:31:07] by one purpose that is of god and that
[1:31:10] before we even become adults
[1:31:12] while we were yet children the gifts
[1:31:15] that we have of god is in us
[1:31:17] then i want to say that again
[1:31:23] before we become adults while
[1:31:26] we were young children the gifts that we
[1:31:29] have
[1:31:30] of god is in us then and
[1:31:33] only the filling of the holy spirit
[1:31:36] put these gifts into operation
[1:31:39] but we have them in the beginning such
[1:31:42] as teachers
[1:31:43] and apostles and prophets and gifts of
[1:31:46] tongues
[1:31:46] nine spiritual gifts according to first
[1:31:48] corinthians 12. now we believe that
[1:31:49] these gifts are in operation today
[1:31:51] and they should be in every local church
[1:31:55] oh glory to god i trust you're being
[1:31:57] edified this morning
[1:31:59] now we believe in water baptism in iran
[1:32:00] tabernacle by mercy
[1:32:02] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:32:03] which is the apostolic teaching of the
[1:32:05] bible
[1:32:05] and all members of the commerce of
[1:32:08] commerce to the brahms
[1:32:09] who desire such i may at any time
[1:32:11] request to be immersed
[1:32:13] in the name of the lord jesus may
[1:32:14] consult the pastor
[1:32:16] and if they have repented and believe in
[1:32:17] the lord jesus christ the pastor will as
[1:32:19] soon as possible
[1:32:21] baptize them immediately this does
[1:32:24] bring them into the fellowship of the
[1:32:27] believers
[1:32:28] we believe that by water baptism we are
[1:32:31] brought into a
[1:32:33] fellowship but by
[1:32:36] the baptism of the holy spirit we are
[1:32:39] brought
[1:32:40] into the members being members of the
[1:32:43] body of jesus christ which is
[1:32:44] all over the world no man can make you a
[1:32:48] member of the body of christ
[1:32:49] the holy ghost is what does make you a
[1:32:51] member of the body of christ
[1:32:53] you could belong to a fellowship but it
[1:32:55] takes the baptism of the holy ghost to
[1:32:57] push you into that body
[1:32:58] and that body is a wrong word nobody can
[1:33:01] put you in
[1:33:02] and no man can't take you out oh give
[1:33:04] the lord a shout i feel good this
[1:33:05] morning hallelujah
[1:33:07] but by the baptism of the holy spirit we
[1:33:09] are being
[1:33:10] made members of the body of christ which
[1:33:13] is
[1:33:14] all over the world who is that spirit
[1:33:17] then
[1:33:18] what is the holy ghost it is christ in
[1:33:20] you the comforter
[1:33:22] and that's the holy spirit when the
[1:33:24] comforter has come
[1:33:25] he will do the same things that i've
[1:33:27] done while the comforter is in me i'll
[1:33:29] pray the father
[1:33:30] that he will give you another comforter
[1:33:32] isn't that right i will not be
[1:33:33] comfortless
[1:33:34] no that's the comfort of christ that is
[1:33:37] what the holy ghost is
[1:33:39] it's christ isn't that right praise the
[1:33:42] name of the lord do you love him this
[1:33:43] morning
[1:33:44] trust your amen worshiping him there
[1:33:47] amen
[1:33:48] revelation 15 3 says says and they sang
[1:33:51] the song of moses the servant of god
[1:33:53] and the song of the lamb saying great
[1:33:55] and marvelous that i works
[1:33:56] lord god almighty just untrue and i ways
[1:33:58] the king of saints do you see it the
[1:34:00] lamb
[1:34:01] the high priest holding his blood as an
[1:34:03] atonement and the mercy for our sins is
[1:34:05] the lord god almighty
[1:34:07] that is his present office that is what
[1:34:10] he is doing now
[1:34:11] pleading his blood for our sins but one
[1:34:13] day
[1:34:14] that lamb will become the lion of the
[1:34:18] tribe of judah
[1:34:19] he will comfort in power and glory to
[1:34:23] take his authority to reina's king he is
[1:34:26] the common king
[1:34:27] of this earth of course that does not
[1:34:29] say he's not king now for he is our king
[1:34:31] king
[1:34:32] of saints right no it's a spiritual
[1:34:34] kingdom
[1:34:35] it is not of this world system even as
[1:34:38] we are not of this world
[1:34:39] that's the reason we act different from
[1:34:41] the world our citizenship
[1:34:43] is in heaven we reflect the spirit
[1:34:46] here we go listen we reflect the spirit
[1:34:50] of the world of our rebirth where jesus
[1:34:53] is the king
[1:34:54] i want to say that again we reflect the
[1:34:57] spirit
[1:34:57] of the world of or rebirth where jesus
[1:35:00] is king we are not trinidadians we get
[1:35:02] delivered between that spirit
[1:35:04] america the spirit germany of the spirit
[1:35:07] england of the spirit is a spirit that's
[1:35:09] not the holy spirit
[1:35:10] holy spirit is the word here oh glory to
[1:35:12] god is one spirit
[1:35:13] one lord one baptism hallelujah oh glory
[1:35:17] to god amen
[1:35:18] praise god our citizenship is in heaven
[1:35:21] we reflect the spirit
[1:35:22] of the world or of our reboot with jesus
[1:35:26] king
[1:35:26] that is why our women don't dress in
[1:35:29] men's clothing
[1:35:30] or cut their hair or use those cosmetics
[1:35:32] and other things
[1:35:33] that the world likes so much that is why
[1:35:35] our men don't drink and smoke and carry
[1:35:37] on sin
[1:35:38] our dominion is the dominion over sin
[1:35:41] oh glory to god i feel good about that
[1:35:42] one tonight our dominion
[1:35:44] is dominion over sin and it is enforced
[1:35:47] through the power that is in the spirit
[1:35:49] of christ that indwells us
[1:35:51] every kingdom on earth is going to be
[1:35:53] torn down but ours will remain oh glory
[1:35:56] to god and we have been talking
[1:35:57] about the offices and the manifestation
[1:35:59] of the one true god
[1:36:01] beholding his glory in a scriptural
[1:36:03] study but he is not to be known
[1:36:05] intellectually
[1:36:06] he is known spiritually by spiritual
[1:36:09] revelation
[1:36:10] this same one who was known as jesus
[1:36:12] after the flesh went back to
[1:36:14] the pillar of fire but he promised he
[1:36:16] would come again and dwell among his
[1:36:18] people
[1:36:18] by the spirit and on the day of
[1:36:20] pentecost that pill of fire came down
[1:36:22] and it separated itself into tongues of
[1:36:24] fire upon each one of them
[1:36:26] what was god doing he was separating
[1:36:29] himself
[1:36:30] into the church giving all those men and
[1:36:33] women
[1:36:34] a part of himself he divided himself
[1:36:38] among the church was the holy ghost he's
[1:36:41] getting part of him
[1:36:42] oh hallelujah who would send another
[1:36:45] comforter
[1:36:46] who was with them the disciples already
[1:36:48] but not
[1:36:49] in them that was christ then in verse 23
[1:36:52] speaking of himself and the father he
[1:36:54] said we will come there it is
[1:36:56] the spirit is coming the same spirit of
[1:36:59] god that manifests as
[1:37:00] father and a son will yet manifest
[1:37:04] in many one god who is spirit
[1:37:07] that's why no man can ever come along
[1:37:08] and say the holy man is a pope or the
[1:37:11] holy man is a bishop or priest
[1:37:12] the holy man is christ the holy spirit
[1:37:15] in us how dare the iraqi declare the
[1:37:17] laity has no word to say
[1:37:19] each one has something to say each has a
[1:37:21] work each has a ministry the holy ghost
[1:37:24] came
[1:37:24] at pentecost and separated itself from
[1:37:26] each that it might be fulfilled
[1:37:28] way of christ said at that day you shall
[1:37:30] know i am in the father
[1:37:31] even me and i and you the great i am the
[1:37:34] almighty god has come a spirit
[1:37:36] to fill his true church he has a right
[1:37:38] to move any way he wants
[1:37:40] give the lord some praises he has a
[1:37:41] right to do what move
[1:37:43] anywhere he wants and upon anybody he
[1:37:46] wants to
[1:37:47] or give the lord some praises oh glory
[1:37:49] to god nobody can tell god don't move
[1:37:51] here
[1:37:51] don't move here don't bless that one
[1:37:53] here don't anoint that one here
[1:37:54] oh glory to god i think what condition
[1:37:56] you in god can still come to you
[1:37:58] he promised i will come to you oh glory
[1:38:00] to god i will not leave you comfortless
[1:38:02] you see your tears you see your prayers
[1:38:05] oh hallelujah
[1:38:06] he could come upon anybody he wants to
[1:38:08] we don't make any holy men among us
[1:38:10] but the whole true congregation of the
[1:38:13] lord is holy
[1:38:14] because of the presence of the holy
[1:38:15] spirit it is he
[1:38:17] the holy spirit that is holy not the
[1:38:18] congregation in itself
[1:38:21] oh my hallelujah these things say that
[1:38:24] faithful and true witness now i want to
[1:38:26] show you what i thought in the thought
[1:38:27] of the faithful
[1:38:29] you know we often talk about the great
[1:38:30] unchanging god whose word does not
[1:38:32] change
[1:38:33] when we speak of him after that manner
[1:38:35] we often get a view of him
[1:38:37] that makes him seem very impersonal and
[1:38:40] as though god made the whole universe
[1:38:42] all the laws that pertain to it and then
[1:38:44] stood back
[1:38:45] and became a great impersonal god it is
[1:38:48] as though god made a way of salvation
[1:38:50] for lost mankind and the way being the
[1:38:53] cross
[1:38:53] and then when the death of christ had
[1:38:55] atoned for sins his resurrection given
[1:38:57] us a door
[1:38:58] to him just folding his arms stood back
[1:39:01] it is as if we
[1:39:02] measured and believe in a great creator
[1:39:04] who haven't created
[1:39:06] and lost personal interest in his
[1:39:08] creation
[1:39:09] now i say that this is how too many
[1:39:11] people are apt to think
[1:39:13] but that is wrong thinking for god is
[1:39:16] governing in the affairs of men right
[1:39:19] now
[1:39:20] hallelujah he is both creator and
[1:39:22] sustainer
[1:39:24] colossians 1 16 for by him were all
[1:39:26] things created
[1:39:27] that in heaven that are in earth visible
[1:39:29] and invisible
[1:39:30] whether it be thrones or dominions or
[1:39:32] principalities or powers
[1:39:33] all things were created by him and for
[1:39:36] him and he is before all things
[1:39:38] and by him all things consist oh could
[1:39:41] we take some more
[1:39:42] he is a sovereign god by his own counsel
[1:39:46] he purposed the plan of redemptive
[1:39:47] salvation
[1:39:48] for his own elect which he foreknew the
[1:39:50] son died upon the cross
[1:39:52] to establish the means of salvation and
[1:39:55] the holy spirit
[1:39:56] carefully executes the will of the
[1:39:59] father
[1:40:00] he is working all things at this moment
[1:40:03] according to the purpose of his own will
[1:40:06] he is right in the midst of it all he is
[1:40:08] in the midst of his church can we give a
[1:40:10] shout
[1:40:11] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah
[1:40:14] he is in the midst of his church you

[1:44:13] philippians 1 6 being confident of this
[1:44:14] very thing
[1:44:15] that he which had begun a good work in
[1:44:18] you will perform it
[1:44:19] until the day of jesus christ he's a
[1:44:22] true witness
[1:44:23] and this word true is the same word we
[1:44:25] saw back in revelation 3 7 you recall it
[1:44:27] is not true
[1:44:28] as in contrast with false it has a
[1:44:30] richer deeper meaning by far
[1:44:32] it expresses perfect realization
[1:44:35] in contrast to partial realization now
[1:44:38] back in philippian age
[1:44:40] the coming of the lord was joy nine what
[1:44:42] great love that age manifested for him
[1:44:44] it reminds me of those beautiful words
[1:44:45] in first peter 1 8 whom having not seen
[1:44:48] ye love
[1:44:49] in whom though now you see him not yet
[1:44:51] believe him
[1:44:52] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:44:54] full of glory with them
[1:44:55] we rejoice also we haven't seen him but
[1:44:58] we have felt him
[1:44:59] we know him now as much as our limited
[1:45:02] senses can let us
[1:45:04] but one day hallelujah it will be face
[1:45:06] to face
[1:45:07] this is for this age he is coming
[1:45:10] at the end of this age partial
[1:45:12] realization
[1:45:14] will be made perfect realization
[1:45:16] completed realization hallelujah
[1:45:18] we have been looking through a glass
[1:45:19] darkly but soon it will be
[1:45:21] face to face hallelujah we have been
[1:45:24] going from glory to glory and soon we'll
[1:45:26] be right into the glory
[1:45:27] and his glory we will shine we shall be
[1:45:30] like him
[1:45:30] isn't that wonderful amen we will be
[1:45:33] swallowed up in life
[1:45:34] then we will realize realization he is
[1:45:37] the faithful and true witness
[1:45:38] now we think of that word witness oh my
[1:45:41] he said the holy ghost is the witness to
[1:45:43] that the spirit bear record of the word
[1:45:45] isn't that right
[1:45:46] the world hated jesus it killed him but
[1:45:48] god loved him
[1:45:49] and he went to the father the proof
[1:45:52] listen
[1:45:53] that he went the father is that the holy
[1:45:55] ghost came
[1:45:57] if jesus had not been received of the
[1:46:00] father
[1:46:00] the spirit would not have come and that
[1:46:03] is found in sin john 16
[1:46:05] he said nevertheless i tell you the
[1:46:06] truth it is expedient
[1:46:08] for you that i go away for if i go not
[1:46:11] away
[1:46:12] the comforter will not come unto you oh
[1:46:15] my
[1:46:16] but if i depart i will send him unto you
[1:46:19] and when he come he will reprove the
[1:46:22] world of sin
[1:46:23] and of righteousness and of judgment of
[1:46:25] sin because they believe not on on me
[1:46:27] of righteousness because i go to my
[1:46:29] father you see me no more of judgment
[1:46:32] because they have the prince of this
[1:46:33] world is judged the presence of the holy
[1:46:35] spirit
[1:46:36] in this world instead of jesus being
[1:46:38] here proves that
[1:46:40] jesus was righteous went to the father
[1:46:43] but also in sin john 14 18 i will not
[1:46:46] leave you comfortless
[1:46:47] i will come to you he sent the comforter
[1:46:50] he was the comforter he came back in
[1:46:53] spirit
[1:46:53] upon the true church he is faithful and
[1:46:56] the true witness
[1:46:57] in the midst of the church but one day
[1:47:00] he's going to come back in flesh again
[1:47:01] he will prove then who is the only wise
[1:47:04] potent
[1:47:05] potentiate oh my hallelujah i'm on the
[1:47:08] home stretch here now
[1:47:09] oh praise god why would we need the holy
[1:47:11] ghost today
[1:47:12] why would we need divine healing why
[1:47:15] would we need this and how would we need
[1:47:17] another pentecost
[1:47:18] we are all civilized they were too but
[1:47:20] you see if whatever it takes to begin
[1:47:23] with
[1:47:24] whatever god give them to begin with
[1:47:26] that must ever remain
[1:47:28] and the tactics of reasoning is what
[1:47:31] satan use
[1:47:32] and that is what he uses reasoning we
[1:47:35] know our enemy
[1:47:36] because our enemy no brethren i have let
[1:47:38] away from doctrine
[1:47:39] he said i've got to see this any enemy
[1:47:42] any person any church
[1:47:46] any organization any individual
[1:47:49] that reasons against one
[1:47:52] punctuation of god's word is your enemy
[1:47:57] anybody that said the holy ghost is real
[1:47:59] the enemy anybody say that the holy
[1:48:01] ghost is not the same and he's not the
[1:48:02] same yesterday forever
[1:48:04] enemy oh glory to god anybody i said you
[1:48:06] cannot have a personal
[1:48:08] appointment with the supernatural that's
[1:48:09] the enemy talking to you they want you
[1:48:11] to have a point appointment with the
[1:48:12] pastor in the church
[1:48:13] they want you to be church bond they
[1:48:15] don't want your flight like eagles
[1:48:17] because everybody have a personal
[1:48:18] appointment with the supernatural
[1:48:20] he said if you love me you will keep my
[1:48:22] commandments and i am the father not i
[1:48:24] am the pastor
[1:48:25] i am the father not i am the bishop i am
[1:48:27] the father not i am the apostle i am the
[1:48:29] pharaoh

[1:48:50] part but this we're talking about
[1:48:52] you alone have to keep your appointment
[1:48:55] nobody else could keep that appointment
[1:48:56] but you
[1:48:58] oh glory to god you have to be dear you
[1:49:00] can't send anybody
[1:49:01] for that appointment oh my hallelujah

[1:49:11] be nothing wrong should be halfway
[1:49:12] through
[1:49:13] oh my this one i want to get to here
[1:49:16] talking about jesus by his faith in the
[1:49:18] word he can conquer
[1:49:20] both debt hell and the grave we know
[1:49:22] that god is god that perfect fit in
[1:49:24] god's perfect word
[1:49:25] he conquered everything he can come in
[1:49:27] contact with debt
[1:49:28] could not even stand in his presence
[1:49:31] listen to this beautiful
[1:49:32] sickness could not stand in his presence
[1:49:36] flowing from him was like
[1:49:40] rivers of virtue going out constantly
[1:49:44] and that's why i challenged some of the
[1:49:45] ministers show me a man on
[1:49:47] it right now that had to mention jesus
[1:49:48] christ not one
[1:49:50] they could talk what the talk and all
[1:49:52] the mystery talk but this is what we're
[1:49:54] talking about here
[1:49:57] rivers of virtue flowing
[1:50:00] constantly not rivers are torque
[1:50:04] not rivers of revelation not rivers of
[1:50:06] interpretation
[1:50:07] i'm not talking about that not rivers of
[1:50:09] teaching
[1:50:12] sickness could not stand in his presence
[1:50:16] flowing from him him was the rivers of
[1:50:18] virtue
[1:50:19] going out constantly virtue going from
[1:50:22] his garments
[1:50:24] these people laying in his shadows put
[1:50:26] their finger on his garment and was
[1:50:27] healed
[1:50:28] when the woman done that everybody
[1:50:30] wanted to touch his garment
[1:50:31] caused the scene that there was virtue
[1:50:33] going from him constantly
[1:50:35] flowing like rivers of water he that
[1:50:37] believeth on me
[1:50:38] as the scripture had said out of his
[1:50:41] belly shall flow rivers of
[1:50:42] even water this specie of the holy ghost
[1:50:45] that was not yet
[1:50:46] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god is
[1:50:49] this the bible
[1:50:53] is this the word this is the bible
[1:50:57] we could take what we preached and put
[1:50:58] it right back inside the bible
[1:51:00] say if somebody came to the mercy of
[1:51:02] jesus christ where is the virtue
[1:51:04] flowing like rivers of living water
[1:51:06] where is sickness being challenged
[1:51:08] oh glory god that is what they're saying
[1:51:10] here rivers flowing constantly
[1:51:12] and now we say if he abided me and he
[1:51:15] brought the word to you and my words
[1:51:16] abide in you
[1:51:18] then walk in the same way virtues
[1:51:20] flowing from you
[1:51:21] the rivers of god fountains of blessings
[1:51:24] just flowing out to the people
[1:51:27] see what i mean you're not bluffing it
[1:51:29] you are not imagining it
[1:51:30] it's actually taking place i'm still
[1:51:32] reading
[1:51:35] can't bluff this thing there's not after
[1:51:37] service handles on books and tapes
[1:51:40] this is not that playing tips and no
[1:51:42] votes you flowing out
[1:51:43] that's not what we talking about you
[1:51:46] can't give what you don't have
[1:51:48] you might not have it to give it oh we
[1:51:51] can give revelation this is a vindicated
[1:51:52] message we can get explanation we could
[1:51:54] get quotes we can repeat
[1:51:56] scripture and court but this there is no
[1:52:00] impersonation to this
[1:52:01] oh give the lord a shout let me say it
[1:52:02] again there is no impersonation to this
[1:52:06] no impersonation virtues flew in from
[1:52:10] you
[1:52:11] the rivers of god's fountains of
[1:52:12] blessings flowing out to the people
[1:52:15] see what i mean you're not bluffing it
[1:52:17] you're not
[1:52:18] imagining it it's actually taking place
[1:52:21] and you see if you just imagine it it
[1:52:24] won't don't do any good
[1:52:26] but if it is really there it really
[1:52:28] happened oh that's some perfect faith
[1:52:30] you see
[1:52:30] instead of a human being it was a super
[1:52:33] super superhuman being
[1:52:35] and that makes a super being not only a
[1:52:37] human being but he's a son and daughter
[1:52:39] of god
[1:52:39] of the super super super super life that
[1:52:42] was in him
[1:52:42] comes back upon you and changes you from
[1:52:45] a sinner
[1:52:46] and the seal of the world a church
[1:52:47] member nomination of god
[1:52:49] are born again christian filled with the
[1:52:51] spirit and the life
[1:52:52] of god is flowing from you like sparks
[1:52:56] of an anvil
[1:52:57] as you walk full of virtue and love and
[1:53:00] gentleness
[1:53:00] as the holy spirit moving and speaking
[1:53:02] oh my there you are
[1:53:04] hearing the message watching the pillar
[1:53:07] of fire
[1:53:08] and blessed assurance have passed some
[1:53:09] debt onto life
[1:53:11] it's not wonderful this morning lust for
[1:53:14] money lots of big things lust for
[1:53:15] popularity
[1:53:16] these things are dead to the believer we
[1:53:18] don't care tend to cut it why should i
[1:53:20] care live or die
[1:53:21] sink or drown this is the thing
[1:53:25] that i'm interested in the kingdom of
[1:53:27] god
[1:53:28] whether i maintain my home whether i
[1:53:30] maintain my family
[1:53:32] whether i maintain whatever let me
[1:53:34] maintain christ
[1:53:38] our hope of glory build me up oh lord
[1:53:41] into this
[1:53:42] for the ministry now let christ be my
[1:53:45] head
[1:53:46] working through me on my foundation my
[1:53:50] feet that's in him
[1:53:51] let virtue knowledge
[1:53:54] temperance patience godliness and
[1:53:58] brotherly kindness work in me
[1:54:00] oh lord is my prayer i don't care
[1:54:04] live or die sink or drown drone
[1:54:07] denomination or no denomination friend
[1:54:10] or no friend
[1:54:11] minister friend or no minister friend
[1:54:14] message friend or no message friend
[1:54:15] friend or no friend
[1:54:16] let that work in me let
[1:54:20] christ's virtue his knowledge
[1:54:23] flow out that i might be able to teach
[1:54:27] those
[1:54:28] so for his virtue to flow out we have to
[1:54:31] have it
[1:54:32] for it to flow out not teach out flow
[1:54:35] out that i might be able to teach
[1:54:37] so the correct teaching will come from
[1:54:39] the virtue power
[1:54:40] powered by the virtue of christ oh my
[1:54:43] not my intellect
[1:54:44] not by understanding and just knowledge
[1:54:47] but by the virtue of christ
[1:54:48] for god has set in the church
[1:54:51] apostles prophets teachers
[1:54:55] pastors and evangelists all for the
[1:54:57] perfecting
[1:54:58] and here we go this is a big one and
[1:55:00] bringing
[1:55:01] all these virtues into it to that
[1:55:04] perfection
[1:55:05] of the coming of the son of god because
[1:55:08] what was revealed
[1:55:09] son of man according to luke 17 30. what
[1:55:12] after what happened after son emmanuelli
[1:55:14] in new testament after jesus came son of
[1:55:16] god spirit keep making the upper room
[1:55:18] so son of man come back again according
[1:55:20] to luke's literary what happened the
[1:55:21] next
[1:55:22] son of god spirit come back to the sons
[1:55:24] of god
[1:55:25] and these virtues to be brought into the
[1:55:27] people
[1:55:28] hallelujah by a fightful ministry they
[1:55:31] can't preach that into the people
[1:55:32] no it has to be there to flow out oh not
[1:55:35] something there
[1:55:36] each one of these stones are materials
[1:55:38] that that one
[1:55:39] this is a material of this each one of
[1:55:41] these virtues belong to him
[1:55:42] are gone oh my thank you lord
[1:55:46] so jesus we know he said mark you said
[1:55:48] have faith in god for very like sin to
[1:55:50] you
[1:55:50] if you shall say to this mountain be
[1:55:51] moved and be those cast in the sea
[1:55:55] have no doubt in your heart you shall
[1:55:56] have what those things would you seek on
[1:55:57] the past
[1:55:58] okay so you give the two pull first then
[1:56:00] you go into the second point therefore
[1:56:02] when i say
[1:56:02] whatever things you desire when you pray
[1:56:05] believe you receive them you shall have
[1:56:06] them
[1:56:07] and then you come down to the first pool
[1:56:09] when you stand praying forgive
[1:56:11] if you have against any so let's reverse
[1:56:14] it now
[1:56:15] before you could ask you have to be able
[1:56:18] to forgive
[1:56:19] so you could forgive then they could ask
[1:56:21] then they could get to the next step
[1:56:22] that you could speak
[1:56:23] isn't that right so then barbara said
[1:56:25] this if you do not forgive
[1:56:27] neither will your father which is heaven
[1:56:28] forgive your trespasses
[1:56:30] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:56:34] so once you have your horse in your
[1:56:36] grudges pack up stuck up like if it's
[1:56:37] our investment
[1:56:39] you know we have no faith working there
[1:56:40] at all you're struggling
[1:56:42] you believe the word but forgiveness is
[1:56:45] not really prominent it's not dear in
[1:56:47] front there
[1:56:48] faith is based on forgiveness then and
[1:56:51] then as we said this morning trying to
[1:56:52] get the church into a place
[1:56:54] where we could really see apostate times
[1:56:56] moving among us
[1:56:57] that's what we all hunger it's just
[1:57:00] laying right at the door we see it
[1:57:02] but we want to see more of it we want it
[1:57:04] to flow
[1:57:05] that to help us flow out to others
[1:57:08] so this must be our desire that we could
[1:57:11] be so yielded and surrendered
[1:57:12] with the spirit of forgiveness you know
[1:57:14] just what happened to brotherly kindness
[1:57:16] what happened on top brother christ is
[1:57:18] what holy spirit
[1:57:19] so true brotherly kindness you have
[1:57:21] access to holy spirit
[1:57:23] because i take faith to bring down the
[1:57:25] holy spirit
[1:57:26] so god put brotherly kindness the top of
[1:57:28] this age put at our virtue
[1:57:30] the virtue of this age is broadly kind
[1:57:32] of spirit of forgiveness and so enough
[1:57:34] hatred
[1:57:34] so would have jealousy and envy and
[1:57:36] sometimes when somebody jealous and envy
[1:57:38] god help them oh my just mess up the
[1:57:41] spirit they message they believe the
[1:57:42] word they're preaching all kind of thing
[1:57:43] like that but they messed up
[1:57:45] there's no faith to access holy spirit
[1:57:48] remember jesus as we had the lesson this
[1:57:52] morning
[1:57:52] he never used his power for himself he
[1:57:54] used it for others
[1:57:56] and that is what he was sent for and you
[1:57:58] think sometime why would a man that was
[1:58:00] so full of power like him
[1:58:02] would have to be sick i read in a book
[1:58:04] somewhere
[1:58:05] where he was raised up the boy the
[1:58:06] widow's son from name and the prince of
[1:58:08] house of david he sat on a rock and
[1:58:10] grown with a headache
[1:58:11] he bore over infirmity bear means to
[1:58:14] pack them
[1:58:15] see he had sickness from jesus
[1:58:21] oh my hallelujah he had sickness
[1:58:24] he had temptations he had trouble
[1:58:27] he had frustration so do you have
[1:58:29] temptations
[1:58:31] do you have trouble do you have
[1:58:32] frustration jesus had it too all right
[1:58:34] just as we have because he had to be the
[1:58:36] right kind of a mediator
[1:58:38] so he had to be a partaker the husband
[1:58:41] of the fruit
[1:58:42] isn't that right now the new birth you
[1:58:44] have the new birth by being believing on
[1:58:46] the lord jesus christ by having
[1:58:48] faith accepting him as their savior
[1:58:50] that's burt
[1:58:51] because you're apart from death in the
[1:58:52] life he that heareth my words and
[1:58:54] believe it on him and sent me has
[1:58:55] everlasting life see
[1:58:56] he's got life because he believes that's
[1:58:58] the same group
[1:59:00] that had to go to pentecost to be
[1:59:02] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:59:05] hallelujah holy ghost is
[1:59:08] power facilities all right where you are
[1:59:11] say powerful service
[1:59:13] right in your house a powerful service
[1:59:15] not
[1:59:16] joining church power for service holy
[1:59:19] ghost
[1:59:19] is powerful service so when talk that
[1:59:22] you have to be born again and apply that
[1:59:23] to the holy ghost
[1:59:24] many of the methodists and so forth are
[1:59:26] wrong there it cannot
[1:59:28] it won't cope with the scripture you get
[1:59:30] things sideways
[1:59:31] you receive the new word after this no
[1:59:34] you receive power
[1:59:35] acts on it after the holy ghost has come
[1:59:38] upon you
[1:59:39] they had already believed eternal life
[1:59:40] and so forth but they had
[1:59:42] they had to have the holy ghost for
[1:59:44] power
[1:59:45] what the holy ghost is for say power
[1:59:48] power
[1:59:49] in your house power power to pray power
[1:59:51] to overcome
[1:59:52] power to forgive power to repent power
[1:59:54] to make things right holy those come to
[1:59:56] give you power
[1:59:58] oh glory to god amen so watch they had
[2:00:01] to have holy ghost
[2:00:02] for power you shall be witnesses unto me
[2:00:04] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[2:00:06] because the holy ghost is a witness of
[2:00:09] the resurrection
[2:00:10] showing that you have become
[2:00:13] an adult in christ i think that word
[2:00:15] reading again because the holy ghost is
[2:00:17] a witness
[2:00:18] of the resurrection showing that you
[2:00:20] have become an adult
[2:00:22] in christ he that heareth my words and
[2:00:24] believe in him that sent me
[2:00:26] hat present tense everlasting life and
[2:00:28] shall not come to judgment
[2:00:30] but is passed from death unto life the
[2:00:32] holy spirit
[2:00:33] is an experience of being filled
[2:00:36] and endured with power for service the
[2:00:39] holy spirit is not an understanding
[2:00:41] it's not a knowledge and then a book
[2:00:43] being read the holy ghost
[2:00:45] the holy spirit is an experience of
[2:00:47] being filled
[2:00:48] and endured with powerful service one
[2:00:50] more time the holy spirit
[2:00:52] is an experience of being filled and
[2:00:54] endured powerful service
[2:00:55] but confession and receiving christ is
[2:00:57] to have faith and make a confession
[2:00:59] and feel free that god has forgiven you
[2:01:01] of your sins
[2:01:02] but the filling is what put you in
[2:01:05] service
[2:01:06] oh my hallelujah when peter went to the
[2:01:09] corners house
[2:01:10] the baby said why peter speak these
[2:01:11] words before they were baptized
[2:01:13] while people speak these words the holy
[2:01:15] ghost fell upon them
[2:01:17] why why why don't you fall upon them why
[2:01:19] here the reason why because they were
[2:01:20] all
[2:01:21] on the expectation now you are on the
[2:01:23] expectation you will god will seal you
[2:01:25] into the kingdom of god
[2:01:26] something that'll be real to you so you
[2:01:28] have to be on the expectation
[2:01:30] so if the ministers if the pastors don't
[2:01:32] preach the holy ghost and to put
[2:01:34] the people on the expectation how could
[2:01:36] they receive the holy ghost
[2:01:37] how could they get the holy ghost they
[2:01:39] think they have it already and they got
[2:01:40] it to get
[2:01:41] oh glory to god baptist doctrine come
[2:01:43] back again you have it because you
[2:01:45] believe the message
[2:01:46] oh hallelujah but he said have you
[2:01:47] received since you believe
[2:01:49] he said they got the holy ghost why they
[2:01:51] were under expectation
[2:01:53] oh glory to god and revelation brings
[2:01:56] you under an expectation
[2:01:57] for manifestation water don't save a man
[2:02:00] it takes the blood of jesus christ
[2:02:01] there's no life in water
[2:02:02] life comes in the blood cell it takes
[2:02:04] sanctification
[2:02:06] to cleanse that life to kill the desire
[2:02:08] of sin
[2:02:09] then the holy spirit comes into that
[2:02:11] clean vessel
[2:02:12] and set it aside in work and service the
[2:02:14] altar
[2:02:15] sanctify the vessel but it's the filling
[2:02:18] that put us in his service
[2:02:19] it was set aside for service but now
[2:02:22] it's got to be put in service
[2:02:23] and the holy ghost puts the church in
[2:02:26] service
[2:02:27] oh my so why it is after 50 years we
[2:02:30] still hang our wrong in church
[2:02:32] think about it now because dynamics have
[2:02:35] to come
[2:02:36] to put the bride in service to put the
[2:02:38] bride
[2:02:39] in place to do what the bride's supposed
[2:02:41] to do
[2:02:42] oh glory to god that's why he said wait
[2:02:45] till the poor
[2:02:46] strike the church he said when the poor
[2:02:47] of this church rises
[2:02:49] it will bring the brethren oh glory to
[2:02:51] god when the poor vicious rises
[2:02:52] he said it's coming oh hallelujah if you
[2:02:55] don't believe that
[2:02:56] believe the vision he saw hallelujah man
[2:02:58] went down so good seeds isn't that right
[2:03:00] next man go and save so bad seed after
[2:03:02] him and then everybody's dry and dry and
[2:03:04] the lord sent us the rain
[2:03:06] sun as the rain everything's drying up
[2:03:08] tell us
[2:03:09] everybody jump up good bad ugly
[2:03:12] different
[2:03:13] everything jumping up why rain what
[2:03:15] happened right now with family land
[2:03:18] things dry oh glory to god church is

[2:03:24] saw seeds all around the world
[2:03:26] all the same condition oh hallelujah
[2:03:29] dry everywhere oh glory to god but but
[2:03:32] there's going to be a people on the
[2:03:33] earth
[2:03:34] that should be under great expectation
[2:03:36] not expectation great expectation
[2:03:38] for the manifestation oh hallelujah
[2:03:41] god is a god of reality don't just take
[2:03:43] a creed don't take a sensation
[2:03:46] take a reality take real god is
[2:03:48] something
[2:03:49] god is a reality that gives you
[2:03:51] assurance
[2:03:52] it gives you hope it gives you faith it
[2:03:54] gives you the spirit
[2:03:56] it gives you signs it gives you wonders
[2:03:58] it does
[2:03:59] it just like it did in christ because
[2:04:01] that was his purpose of
[2:04:03] coming to bring god to man and make god
[2:04:06] and man
[2:04:06] one and when he comes in his power of
[2:04:09] his resurrection
[2:04:10] to make people live and act and behave
[2:04:13] themselves
[2:04:14] to change their attitudes to change
[2:04:16] their ways to change their living
[2:04:18] they don't want nothing to do with that
[2:04:20] they want to live just the way they want
[2:04:21] to live they want to continue right on
[2:04:22] living the way they live
[2:04:24] always can't work friends this whole
[2:04:26] thing is to bring a change
[2:04:28] oh my hallelujah ii peter one tree
[2:04:31] according to his divine power had given
[2:04:34] unto us all things
[2:04:35] that pertain unto life and godliness

[2:04:38] knowledge of him that i call us to glory
[2:04:42] and virtue oh my all that ever
[2:04:46] would be in the world would be redeemed
[2:04:48] god go all that ever that would be
[2:04:50] redeemed
[2:04:51] god put their name on the lamb's book of
[2:04:54] life
[2:04:54] before the world ever come into creation
[2:04:57] and the antichrist in the last days is
[2:04:59] gonna be
[2:05:00] so close like the real thing the real
[2:05:02] church
[2:05:03] everything like judas was until it would
[2:05:05] deceive the very lick
[2:05:06] if it was possible but no man can come
[2:05:09] to jesus
[2:05:10] except god sends him and all that god
[2:05:13] did
[2:05:13] give to him will come to him and when he
[2:05:16] takes that book
[2:05:18] are you ready the last name
[2:05:22] see all in the lutheran age he pulled
[2:05:24] them out
[2:05:25] all in the wesley age he pulled them out
[2:05:28] all in different ages and the
[2:05:29] pentecostal age he pulls them out
[2:05:31] they're over deer won't be judged with
[2:05:33] them they are rapturing
[2:05:35] but when the last name comes out
[2:05:38] that was put on the lamb's book of life
[2:05:40] that was flamed from the front in the
[2:05:42] world
[2:05:42] when the last name has been redeemed
[2:05:46] not just put but redeemed
[2:05:49] his work is finished he comes forth
[2:05:52] to claim what he has redeemed that makes
[2:05:55] our heart bleed
[2:05:57] but it went on a thousand years later
[2:05:59] there will not be one more redeemed no
[2:06:01] one can be redeemed
[2:06:02] unless they want the lamb's book of
[2:06:04] light before the foundation of the world
[2:06:06] who are they i don't know nobody else
[2:06:08] knows just god alone
[2:06:10] i'm trusting that every one of us our

[2:07:00] when i saw this i saw
[2:07:01] i that just gave me so rejoicing
[2:07:04] but when the body has been formed

[2:08:19] oh give the lord i shout hallelujah
[2:08:22] then we go to see him and to meet him in
[2:08:24] the resurrection he that heard my words
[2:08:26] and believe it on him that sent me has
[2:08:28] eternal life
[2:08:28] shall not come into judgment but let's
[2:08:30] pass some death into life
[2:08:32] oh my when god himself
[2:08:35] okay let me skip down a little bit he
[2:08:36] said when the great spirit of god which
[2:08:38] is love god
[2:08:39] the great rainbow we could imagine how
[2:08:41] it looks like and just
[2:08:43] he looks like a rainbow them spirits the
[2:08:45] perfect spirit of love
[2:08:46] red blue the perfect spirit of
[2:08:49] fellowship
[2:08:50] all those perfect spirits and then they
[2:08:52] begin to condescend coming down
[2:08:53] and from failure agapo love to feel your
[2:08:56] love
[2:08:56] don't lust down to the lowest then god
[2:08:59] himself become man jesus
[2:09:01] and came down the same way to the lowest
[2:09:04] pits of hell
[2:09:05] and picked out those who he knew before
[2:09:08] the foundation of the world
[2:09:09] whose name were written on the book and
[2:09:12] redeemed them back to himself there you
[2:09:14] are
[2:09:14] the story of redemption cannot be fully
[2:09:17] known until we see him
[2:09:19] and stand his likeness and that is why
[2:09:21] we are not a denomination
[2:09:22] oh man if the baptist turned me down the
[2:09:25] method is the pentecostal
[2:09:26] upon the initial evidence speaking in
[2:09:28] tongues being the holy ghost and that's
[2:09:29] the reason we are not pentecostals
[2:09:31] we don't believe that speaking in
[2:09:33] tongues makes you feel with the holy
[2:09:34] ghost no man
[2:09:35] no more than believe living in a band
[2:09:37] would make you a big
[2:09:39] no sir no manner we believe living in a
[2:09:40] king's palace would make you a king
[2:09:42] because it doesn't you could be a
[2:09:44] servant oh hallelujah we believe
[2:09:46] that you receive the holy ghost by an
[2:09:48] experience not by
[2:09:50] mythical intellectual conception of the
[2:09:52] scripture but by an experience
[2:09:54] that you alone know and this receiver in
[2:09:56] the holy ghost
[2:09:57] does not annoy the quotation you could
[2:09:59] have the battery goes 24 hours and still
[2:10:01] be lost
[2:10:03] because the prophet said that but is
[2:10:05] where the person get that baptism
[2:10:07] oh glory to god hallelujah so that
[2:10:10] doesn't say
[2:10:10] no holy ghost because the prophet said
[2:10:12] you can have the holy ghost of baptism
[2:10:14] and still be lost
[2:10:15] 24 hours a day hallelujah the baptism of
[2:10:19] the holy ghost is a personal experience
[2:10:21] if your name is in the land book of life
[2:10:24] you will walk in the light
[2:10:25] you will see the light and god will
[2:10:27] reveal it and you will walk in it
[2:10:29] now what i'm not saying i'm not taking
[2:10:32] you back to my church
[2:10:33] yeah i am not taking you back to a
[2:10:37] church
[2:10:38] i am taking you back to the bible what
[2:10:41] did paul say
[2:10:42] if an angel from heaven preached any
[2:10:44] other thing
[2:10:45] let him be a curse oh my hallelujah
[2:10:48] this church is sovereign it is sovereign
[2:10:50] in itself we have no bishops
[2:10:53] we have no general overseers we have
[2:10:55] jesus
[2:10:56] he's the bishop he's the general
[2:10:58] overseers he's a head pastor
[2:11:00] he's the king he's the lord isn't that
[2:11:02] right now watch
[2:11:04] no man can do it no other person no
[2:11:06] matter how good you are
[2:11:07] it's got to be revealed to you then you
[2:11:09] see who jesus is
[2:11:11] here's the predestinated plan in plain
[2:11:13] view
[2:11:14] just as other seed the word of god
[2:11:18] is a seed and i know you're going to
[2:11:20] rejoice on this one
[2:11:21] and must have the grumpy pier beforehand
[2:11:24] if you sowed seed and just straight out
[2:11:27] there on the ground
[2:11:27] it will do no good the birds will pick
[2:11:29] it up you throw it among tissues and
[2:11:31] tones they will choke it out pretty soon
[2:11:33] jesus parable said so the ground has to
[2:11:36] be made ready first
[2:11:38] here we go are you ready god in
[2:11:40] sovereign grace
[2:11:42] prepares the heart first he prepared you
[2:11:47] he prepared you before the foundation of
[2:11:50] the world
[2:11:51] to receive him in this age so you are
[2:11:54] not
[2:11:54] know being ppm he prepared you
[2:11:58] before the foundation of the world to
[2:12:00] receive him
[2:12:01] in this age he foreknew you by his full
[2:12:04] knowledge
[2:12:05] and ordain you to eternal life he
[2:12:08] knew you therefore he prepared you and
[2:12:11] that
[2:12:11] is the reason you staggered out of these
[2:12:14] things and staggered into what you have
[2:12:16] now
[2:12:16] it was god leading you to the place
[2:12:19] where your dinner to be
[2:12:21] he prepared your ground beforehand we'll
[2:12:23] give the lord some praises
[2:12:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:28] praise god oh glory to god
[2:12:32] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[2:12:34] that's about three more pages
[2:12:36] and we're going to close oh glory to god
[2:12:37] better give you god by the music
[2:12:39] music oh my oh my
[2:12:42] hallelujah so he christ was god's wheat
[2:12:46] that had been raised from the dead he
[2:12:48] was god's first fruit
[2:12:50] of them that slept he was god's sheath
[2:12:52] hallelujah and because he was the first
[2:12:54] son
[2:12:54] of god to come to maturity to be god he
[2:12:57] was plucked from the earth
[2:12:59] and waved over the people remember the
[2:13:01] old testament when they get the first
[2:13:03] sheep that was mature
[2:13:04] the priesthood come before the lord and
[2:13:05] wave it and it's a testament that others
[2:13:07] come in
[2:13:08] lord i bring the first fruit to you the
[2:13:10] first one that comes to maturity
[2:13:12] is being waved it's a testimony others
[2:13:14] come in just like this one coming here
[2:13:15] oh glory to god and jesus
[2:13:17] he was the god's first fruit of them
[2:13:19] that slept isn't that right
[2:13:20] hallelujah he was with uttar pentecos
[2:13:23] when there came a song from heaven
[2:13:25] like a wave in russian mighty wind was
[2:13:27] brave over the people the pentagons are
[2:13:28] people that was in pentecost waiting for
[2:13:30] the blessing to come
[2:13:31] and is to be wave again we realize in
[2:13:34] the last day are going to look something
[2:13:35] today
[2:13:36] wave how wave again the son of man again
[2:13:41] the son of man will reveal or wave again
[2:13:44] over the people
[2:13:45] why would god bring all these seals and
[2:13:47] all these revelations
[2:13:48] and all these messages to wave over the
[2:13:50] people first pull second pull to pull
[2:13:52] why would he wave it he waving it
[2:13:54] because others coming
[2:13:56] that's why the prophet said what you see
[2:13:57] manifested temporarily
[2:13:59] will be manifested in his fullness when
[2:14:01] the press come down
[2:14:02] that doesn't cancel out these signs
[2:14:03] shall follow belief we have to have sin
[2:14:06] mark 16
[2:14:07] because he said the devil know assuredly
[2:14:09] that the true church
[2:14:10] is sin mark 16 not in the text not

[2:14:32] first malachi 4 different scriptures
[2:14:34] that we are acquainted with that the
[2:14:35] word again is way over the people
[2:14:38] what word that the dead traditions of
[2:14:41] man is dead
[2:14:42] and the son of god is alive again with
[2:14:43] the baptism of the holy ghost right
[2:14:45] among us
[2:14:46] and giving us life he's like he's not
[2:14:48] talking about pentecost baptism you know
[2:14:49] what's speaking in tongues and they're
[2:14:50] crazy really crazy money god splitting
[2:14:52] he's talking about the real holy ghost
[2:14:54] it's not right christ was the first one
[2:14:56] to raise from all the prophets and so
[2:14:57] forth
[2:14:58] isn't that right there will be a chief
[2:14:59] wave again in the last days
[2:15:01] waving at the sheath what was the sheath
[2:15:03] the first one that come to maturity
[2:15:05] the first one has come to mature the
[2:15:07] first one that proved
[2:15:08] it was a wheat it was wave hallelujah i
[2:15:12] am
[2:15:12] sure that you see what i'm talking about
[2:15:14] it was way over the people
[2:15:15] and the first time they will come
[2:15:17] forward for the bright age for
[2:15:18] resurrection out of dark
[2:15:20] denominationalism
[2:15:21] will be a message hear the message that
[2:15:23] the full
[2:15:24] maturity of the word has turned back
[2:15:28] again
[2:15:28] to its full power and being waved over
[2:15:31] the people
[2:15:32] by the same signs and wonders hallelujah
[2:15:35] what did the prophet say in 1965 he said
[2:15:37] our faith isn't ripe enough
[2:15:39] oh glory to god our faith is
[2:15:40] intellectual he said the faith that they
[2:15:42] get right
[2:15:43] that means faith is not just faith faith
[2:15:44] could be intellectual faith have to
[2:15:46] ripen
[2:15:47] faith could grow faith could be
[2:15:48] increased so he's talking about the time
[2:15:50] will come
[2:15:51] when that faith will be so powered up it
[2:15:53] will go to virtue it will go to
[2:15:55] knowledge
[2:15:55] it will go to temperance it will go to
[2:15:57] patience it will go to godliness it will
[2:15:58] go to brotherly kindness i
[2:16:00] will tap into the source itself of the
[2:16:02] holy spirit
[2:16:03] isn't that right hallelujah he said oh
[2:16:06] man
[2:16:06] it was god's quickening power he was
[2:16:08] waved to them the word which he was was
[2:16:10] waved back
[2:16:11] to them on the day of pentecost the word
[2:16:13] made manifest
[2:16:15] hallelujah praise god hallelujah he said
[2:16:19] we put too much stress on the mechanics
[2:16:21] nothing on the dynamics it needs the
[2:16:23] dynamic power of god
[2:16:24] the resurrection paul of jesus christ
[2:16:26] upon the church to manifest
[2:16:28] and to bring the past this is gasoline
[2:16:31] it might be a gasoline can
[2:16:33] but it could still be water
[2:16:37] so somebody say they have gasoline
[2:16:39] saturday
[2:16:41] because they can outside say gasoline
[2:16:43] actually they paint on gasoline
[2:16:44] cyanide
[2:16:50] what you have in that can and let's
[2:16:52] strike the match and push it on earth
[2:16:55] and when you're slightly matched and
[2:16:56] nothing happens you know your eye water
[2:16:58] fully man hallelujah if it's gasoline
[2:17:01] it's blowing up that's the proof it's
[2:17:03] gasoline
[2:17:04] he said it might as well be water isn't
[2:17:06] that right he said watch
[2:17:08] let me say again we put too much stress
[2:17:10] on the mechanics nothing on the dynamics
[2:17:12] hallelujah praise god oh glory to god i
[2:17:16] wonder
[2:17:16] like he passes phrase the dynamics boy
[2:17:18] you don't want to talk about it
[2:17:20] because the law you see you see dynamics
[2:17:23] takes it out of man's hand
[2:17:27] let me say that again dynamics
[2:17:30] takes it out of man's hand man could
[2:17:34] make declaration
[2:17:35] and make prophecy and say who is shocked
[2:17:37] and who out of it and cut this one off
[2:17:40] and say this one is this a nigerian but
[2:17:42] when dynamics come
[2:17:43] waiting what do with jesus he said with
[2:17:45] small miracles and build right up
[2:17:47] you know what floor them when lazarus is
[2:17:49] reasonably dead when he finished with
[2:17:50] that resurrection they say
[2:17:51] old man go up there let me call a
[2:17:53] conference let me have minister
[2:17:54] association they all come from one time
[2:17:56] because they don't continue that's a
[2:17:57] church finish
[2:17:59] everybody will follow that man and
[2:18:02] that's where they get their money and
[2:18:03] they change the city they pull judas and
[2:18:05] sarah could bribe somebody and think to
[2:18:06] sell him out and what the holy
[2:18:09] oh hallelujah now remember judas and
[2:18:11] make it to the upper room
[2:18:14] he make it in the preaching part he make
[2:18:17] it in the teaching part
[2:18:18] he make it under jesus ministry he make
[2:18:20] it with the books and tapes
[2:18:22] he makes us make it happen church but he
[2:18:24] didn't make it to the dynamics
[2:18:28] think of it he didn't make it to the
[2:18:31] upper room
[2:18:32] only elected made it up there oh what i
[2:18:35] think
[2:18:36] jesus stopped him from preaching the
[2:18:37] whole time he was preaching
[2:18:39] he said new season new time hallelujah
[2:18:41] wait yeah they get this power now you
[2:18:43] know
[2:18:43] because he pressed command the
[2:18:45] congregation is coming down
[2:18:46] and they can't tell if you believe the
[2:18:47] message that can't work they'll lock you
[2:18:49] up
[2:18:50] they go shut you up oh glory to god but
[2:18:53] when you see the power come
[2:18:54] they can't lock up and shut you up oh
[2:18:56] glory to god you forget the god of the
[2:18:57] open prison those are what
[2:18:59] hallelujah the god of power you know
[2:19:01] remember god going to display this
[2:19:03] bright you know
[2:19:03] you have anybody in the corner
[2:19:08] just as god was unveiled he could pull
[2:19:09] the rope over this bride
[2:19:11] this is my wife here see how we could do
[2:19:13] about this
[2:19:14] oh glory to god didn't god tap the devil
[2:19:16] and say come come come here man why his
[2:19:18] check out his name is job there's none
[2:19:20] here like him
[2:19:21] there where you going he said two and
[2:19:23] four all in here he's about to miss this
[2:19:24] one here
[2:19:25] oh come here check this one out he said
[2:19:26] but i see he put the heads around this
[2:19:27] man
[2:19:28] he says not because i want to put that
[2:19:30] around him it's what in him
[2:19:32] hallelujah i know what i put in him god
[2:19:34] knew what joe was made of sin before the
[2:19:35] foundation of the world so you could
[2:19:37] tell the devil you could watch but you
[2:19:38] can't you can't change that man and make
[2:19:40] him curse me
[2:19:41] oh glory to god and when job gets
[2:19:43] stripped so and stripped and strip and
[2:19:44] strip
[2:19:45] oh my hallelujah he was still standing
[2:19:48] is not something
[2:19:49] so watch he said no what he said
[2:19:53] it needs the dynamic power of god the
[2:19:55] resurrection power of jesus christ
[2:19:58] watch upon the church to manifest and to
[2:20:00] bring the past that this is gasoline
[2:20:02] it might be in a gasoline can it could
[2:20:04] still be water but see the only proof of
[2:20:07] it is to put the life on it
[2:20:08] and prove whether it is gasoline or not
[2:20:10] oh my
[2:20:11] when you try to put the holy spirit in a
[2:20:13] denomination you get a splutter
[2:20:15] you ruin your engine full of carbon i'm
[2:20:17] so glad there's a ten thousand octane
[2:20:19] power
[2:20:20] the word of god and the holy ghost to
[2:20:21] light it up and resurrect the power of
[2:20:23] god into a man's life
[2:20:25] or a woman's life into a church that
[2:20:27] will show that cousin like don
[2:20:29] under the dynamic of the holy ghost
[2:20:31] which came backhand and waved over the
[2:20:33] people on the day of pentecost isn't
[2:20:35] that right
[2:20:35] there was the first sheave come upon the
[2:20:37] prophets which was the son of god the
[2:20:39] king of all the prophets there have been
[2:20:40] churches churches brides brides churches
[2:20:42] churches
[2:20:42] but there's got to come one there's got
[2:20:45] to come one
[2:20:46] a real bride there must come one that
[2:20:48] not only got the mechanics but the
[2:20:50] dynamics of it
[2:20:51] to make that church live and move in the
[2:20:54] poor and this is what we're striving for
[2:20:56] to make a church that will live
[2:20:57] and move in the power of his
[2:20:59] resurrection until we come to that place
[2:21:01] until we find the place what good does
[2:21:03] it do to polish our hubs
[2:21:04] what does it do to give her a facelift
[2:21:06] or some a nice job
[2:21:07] what does it do when there's no dynamics
[2:21:10] no matter how much mechanics prove to be
[2:21:11] right
[2:21:12] there's got to be dynamics to make it
[2:21:14] work to play something
[2:21:16] that is what he proved that's what
[2:21:18] easter proved
[2:21:19] he wasn't only the word but he was god
[2:21:22] himself
[2:21:23] the dynamics in the word that made the
[2:21:26] body of jesus
[2:21:27] cold stiff and dead in the grave shake
[2:21:30] the life
[2:21:31] and rise again and roll away from the
[2:21:33] stone and he
[2:21:34] that was dead so dead till the sun he
[2:21:37] was dead
[2:21:38] the moon said he was dead the star said
[2:21:41] he was dead
[2:21:42] all nato said he was dead and now the
[2:21:44] whole world has to recognize
[2:21:46] that he's alive again he was not only
[2:21:48] the mechanics god's word
[2:21:50] he was the dynamics to prove it
[2:21:53] oh praise i could we stand and just give
[2:21:55] god some praises and worship
