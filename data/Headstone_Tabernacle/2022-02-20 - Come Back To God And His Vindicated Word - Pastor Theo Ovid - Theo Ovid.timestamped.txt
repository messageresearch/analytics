[16:01] the intellectual go beyond the
[16:03] humanistic realm and enter into the
[16:05] realm of revelation father god come on
[16:07] in your word this morning reveal
[16:09] yourself by your word and confirm your
[16:11] word with signs wonders and miracles we
[16:14] ask in jesus name god bless you thanks
[16:15] again for coming we want to open the
[16:17] bible says in john chapter 5 reading
[16:19] from 33 to 47. second peter 1 reading
[16:23] from 17
[16:25] to 21
[16:26] blessed be the name of the lord welcome
[16:29] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[16:36] jesus speaking in saint john chapter 5
[16:39] 33 this is in red
[16:41] he sent unto john and he bear witness
[16:44] unto the truth
[16:45] but i receive not the testimony from man
[16:49] but these things i say that you might be
[16:51] saved
[16:52] he was a burning and shining light
[16:55] ye were willing for a season to rejoice
[16:57] in his light but i have a greater
[17:00] witness than that of john
[17:02] for the works which the father had given
[17:05] me to finish
[17:06] the same works that i do be a witness of
[17:09] me remember john had no signs and
[17:10] wonders john had just a repentance
[17:12] message but jesus is saying for the
[17:14] works which the father had given me to
[17:16] finish the same works that i do be a
[17:19] witness of me that the father had sent
[17:21] me and the father himself which had sent
[17:24] me had borne witness of me you have
[17:27] neither heard his voice at any time no
[17:30] senior shape and you have not his word
[17:32] abiding in you for whom he had sent him
[17:36] you believe not so jesus is telling them
[17:38] if you have the word in you you will
[17:40] know who god said
[17:42] search the scriptures verse 39 for in
[17:44] them you think you have eternal life but
[17:47] there they will testify of me and he
[17:50] will not come to me
[17:52] that he might have life
[17:54] i receive not honor from men
[17:56] but i know you that you have not the
[17:59] love of god in you
[18:00] i am come in my father's name and you
[18:03] receive me not
[18:05] if another shall come in his own name
[18:08] him you will receive
[18:10] how can he believe which receive honor
[18:12] one of another and seek not the honor
[18:14] that only comes from god only
[18:16] do you not think that i will accuse you
[18:18] to the father there is no there is one
[18:21] that accuses you even moses in whom you
[18:23] trust if you believe moses you would
[18:26] have believed me for he wrote of me in
[18:28] other words if you believe the prophecy
[18:30] of moses he was going to believe me
[18:32] become a fulfillment of the prophetic
[18:34] utterance that was released from moses
[18:36] mouth
[18:36] but but verse 47 but if you believe not
[18:39] his writings how shall you believe my
[18:42] words oh glory to god and let's go to
[18:45] second peter 1
[18:48] reading from verse 17
[18:52] for he received from god the father
[18:54] honor and glory when there came such a
[18:58] voice to him from the excellent glory
[19:00] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[19:03] pleased and this voice
[19:05] which came from heaven we heard when we
[19:08] were with him in the holy mount these
[19:10] brothers giving testimony
[19:11] we have also a more sure word of
[19:15] prophecy where until you do well
[19:17] that you take heed as unto a light that
[19:20] shines in a dark place until the dead on
[19:24] and the d star arise in your hearts
[19:26] knowing this first
[19:28] no prophecy of scripture
[19:31] is of any private interpretation
[19:34] for the prophecy came not in all time by
[19:36] the will of man but holy men
[19:39] of god speak as they were moved by the
[19:42] holy ghost let us pray father we read
[19:44] your word and we come this morning and
[19:47] ask that you interpreted your hearts
[19:49] lord take me out of the way i'm being
[19:51] calvary's cross and may you be glorified
[19:53] amidst your people in jesus name i ask
[19:55] it amen and amen you may be seated
[19:58] praise god for a few moments the time
[20:00] that we have here
[20:02] i have a title come back to god
[20:05] and his vindicated word
[20:07] not just come back to god
[20:09] come back to god
[20:11] and his vindicated word
[20:13] another inspiration we have a sure word
[20:15] of prophecy
[20:17] praise god amen
[20:19] so we don't believe cuddling divine
[20:21] fables we have a short word of prophecy
[20:24] but
[20:27] that's the way the gospel is today
[20:30] it can only be seen
[20:32] in the way that god presents it to you
[20:37] and if
[20:38] it's presented to you
[20:40] outside of the continuity of the bible
[20:43] then it's not god telling you that
[20:46] you can't make the bible lie
[20:49] it's the infallible word of god
[20:52] it has to agree with the continue of his
[20:55] the rest of his word
[20:57] it just can't say one place and there's
[20:59] something else and do this over hit and
[21:01] scatter he hits the target every time
[21:04] the word does so you have to make it in
[21:07] the continuity of the rest of the world
[21:10] therefore his way has always been in the
[21:13] word to send a prophet before that time
[21:16] before he makes his word vindicated
[21:19] so before god vindicate his word he
[21:21] sends a prophet
[21:23] hallelujah the prophet brings what the
[21:25] prophecy
[21:26] hallelujah and then god come and fulfill
[21:29] the prophecy
[21:30] then the word is indicated
[21:32] so the prophet have to catch the word
[21:34] from god because the word comes from a
[21:36] prophet no prophet no word
[21:38] no word no vindication oh glory to god
[21:42] hallelujah praise god do you believe
[21:43] that
[21:44] are you ready
[21:46] are you ready
[21:47] and the seer
[21:49] was the one who had the interpretation
[21:51] of the written word
[21:53] what does he mean by that the seer
[21:55] the seer is one who could see ahead and
[21:58] come back and foretell
[22:00] so when you see a man speak a prophecy
[22:03] and it come to pass he's a seer
[22:06] he could see ahead of time he could see
[22:08] what's coming and then you know that
[22:10] qualifies the man
[22:12] to interpret the word
[22:14] all glory to god so when he said behold
[22:17] i sent you elijah the prophet it means
[22:20] he said in a seer and when that seer
[22:22] began to speak you know any
[22:24] interpretation of the word come on that
[22:25] seer is from god and that word is
[22:29] vindicated with that's not a theologian
[22:32] studying bible and explaining things
[22:35] that's why he says say what the tapes
[22:37] say because the seer alone has the
[22:40] interpretation of the written word or
[22:42] give the lord a shout
[22:44] so no man can come behind the prophet
[22:47] and try to interpret what the word say
[22:49] you have to say what the tapes say
[22:51] because it's already interpreted by the
[22:54] seer and the sea alone could only
[22:57] interpret the word
[22:58] or give the lord a shout in the house
[23:00] that is why revelation 10 8-11 when the
[23:04] voice told john take the book and eat it
[23:07] he could only prophesy from what he eat
[23:09] from the book and the open book from the
[23:12] mighty angel what's dropping in the
[23:14] hands of that prophet
[23:18] that seven angel messenger
[23:20] so here christ come with the book open
[23:22] every mystery revealed he comes with a
[23:24] book open right
[23:25] and there's a seventh angel waiting to
[23:27] catch it
[23:28] so right in revelation 10 10 1 mighty
[23:30] angel
[23:31] there's no angel from the earth that's
[23:33] the lord from heaven the lord himself
[23:35] descending with a shout he's coming for
[23:38] a bride he come with the book open that
[23:40] book of names your name my name our
[23:44] names that's what the book have in it
[23:46] that's what this message about if they
[23:48] say baptist it is a catholic it is a
[23:51] pentecostal it had your name in it
[23:53] what give the lord i shout
[23:55] glory to god
[23:57] and your name is the word and the word
[24:00] comes to the prophet so when the mighty
[24:02] angel came out with the open book he
[24:04] handed to revelation 10 7. okay the lord
[24:07] i shout let's make him be excited this
[24:09] morning he handed to revelation 10 7.
[24:12] the angel is on the earth
[24:16] glory
[24:17] glory
[24:19] in other words
[24:20] angel from heaven
[24:22] hunt into an angel on earth
[24:24] angel on earth is called the seventh
[24:26] angel or the seven angel messenger and
[24:29] after the angel cut the book
[24:31] the book the angel and look at the book
[24:33] the voice tell john go to the angel
[24:35] that's time i don't want to land on the
[24:37] foot and see and ask for the book and
[24:40] say give me the book don't let the book
[24:42] say any angel him you have to take the
[24:44] book and eat the book and prophesy again
[24:48] and the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[24:51] of prophecy that's what we have this
[24:53] morning that's what we claim this
[24:55] morning that's what we believe this
[24:57] morning that we have the testimony of
[24:59] jesus which is the spirit of prophecy oh
[25:02] give the lord a shout in the house oh
[25:05] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[25:09] let me be seated
[25:11] enough toast in the toast in the bibles
[25:14] and books
[25:15] and messages from theologians and bright
[25:17] men
[25:18] there may be no prophets in them in the
[25:19] head
[25:20] they made great matter they meant
[25:22] education and intellect and where they
[25:24] intellect they try to stretch and
[25:25] interpret what they think it means
[25:27] i remember doing literature in school
[25:29] and sometimes one in line shakes percy
[25:31] and the amount of bag asked me right
[25:33] something hold them know
[25:34] you know you talk to shakespeare
[25:36] shakespeare
[25:37] shakespeare even know that all i'm
[25:38] thinking inside
[25:42] yeah that to be or not to be in a whole
[25:44] they wanted my two essays on the
[25:45] statement to be or not to be what is to
[25:47] be will be
[25:49] a whole long and i was astonished when
[25:51] you're looking back at past papers of a
[25:53] little one in line and somebody write
[25:56] four or five pages
[25:58] of an essay on one line say and i i also
[26:01] wonder i wonder if shakespeare was
[26:03] thinking about all that thing you're
[26:04] talking about
[26:05] i don't think so
[26:08] now you see me real man hallelujah
[26:11] people love man religion become man
[26:13] invented
[26:16] man make it
[26:18] when you come to this bible and this god
[26:21] no money make that
[26:25] that's why he said have no other gods
[26:27] before me who talking
[26:29] god almighty himself
[26:31] you have no paper god no woman god no
[26:33] man god no car god no money god no
[26:35] french god no stove god no land god no
[26:38] god before me
[26:40] [Applause]
[26:44] all right let's go
[26:45] asia was the one who had the
[26:48] interpretation of the written word
[26:52] saying all these liars that have these
[26:53] false prophets lying how down trump come
[26:55] back in power what kind of lie are they
[26:57] like and listen they have talking to
[26:58] other followers you know
[26:59] just going over the next lie i said the
[27:01] lord told me and i fly up to heaven and
[27:03] i come and see this and i see that they
[27:04] see nothing some demon take them into
[27:07] some channel
[27:08] they come back talking with some devil
[27:10] tell them
[27:11] they are not of god
[27:12] jesus said many false prophets arise and
[27:15] people listen to these men now they may
[27:17] say 80 things from the scriptures but we
[27:20] don't want eighty percent
[27:21] this is not eighty percent bride this is
[27:24] a hundred percent
[27:25] they may prophesy and sometime i hit it
[27:28] might miss like guessing
[27:29] pow pow we not want no guessing and
[27:31] hitting and listen every prophet in the
[27:34] bible was dossier the lord
[27:35] god said lord honor man's interpretation
[27:38] just say lord is the word for the hour
[27:40] oh glory to god that's why you have to
[27:42] know what is being spoken that is not
[27:44] man's intellect and gray matter pumping
[27:47] word oh give the lord a shout in the
[27:49] house
[27:50] so the seer
[27:52] is the only one
[27:54] who has the interpretation of the
[27:56] written word
[27:58] not the seer and the fivefold
[28:02] me see it good
[28:03] not the seer and the fight for ministry
[28:06] no this year alone
[28:10] that's why the fightful ministry have to
[28:11] say what the tapes say
[28:14] because they're not authorized to
[28:16] interpret it
[28:17] they ought to write to reflect it or
[28:18] echo it
[28:19] or speak it back
[28:21] or follow on to on or of it all right
[28:24] let's continue
[28:25] he forced all things to come
[28:27] when he spoke the things that was to
[28:29] come and proved that he was a seer then
[28:32] he knowed
[28:34] they know he had the right
[28:36] interpretation of the scripture because
[28:39] god through him
[28:41] manifested the written scripture for
[28:44] that day
[28:45] don't be stressful wake up
[28:48] that was the plain
[28:49] identification
[28:51] a seer
[28:52] a foreteller a teleport and the only way
[28:56] that they knowed he was getting the
[28:58] right
[28:59] interpretation of the scripture because
[29:02] what he said come to pass
[29:04] then they knowed he was called of god
[29:06] god said that and then they noticed that
[29:09] it did it come right back in continuity
[29:12] with the word for that day
[29:14] now
[29:16] we realize
[29:17] all
[29:18] the mysteries of god
[29:21] is
[29:22] made known to prophets
[29:25] and them alone
[29:30] all
[29:32] all means what
[29:33] all means all
[29:36] there is no mystery that a man has to
[29:38] come outside of the prophet to reveal it
[29:41] he could show what has already been
[29:43] revealed
[29:44] [Applause]
[29:46] but he cannot bring a new mystery
[29:48] another mystery a mystery that was never
[29:51] unfolded by the man that god have sent
[29:55] oh glory to god and jesus told them he
[29:58] said if i come in my father's name oh
[30:00] glory to god jesus said i ain't coming
[30:03] my own name i come in my father's name
[30:05] and you don't want to receive it but
[30:07] another would come in his own name well
[30:09] the lord show me the lord i show you
[30:11] nothing silly and shut up oh give the
[30:13] lord a shout the word come to a prophet
[30:16] the prophet put it on books and tapes
[30:18] and we draw from it we eat from it we
[30:22] feast on it what are you feasting on
[30:26] youtube and all kind of foolishness what
[30:28] are you feasting on
[30:33] facebook and all kind of nice coats and
[30:36] nice scenes and what that died of
[30:38] vindicated wood
[30:39] get back to god
[30:41] come back to the vindicated word of god
[30:44] god has a vindicated word in this day
[30:48] oh glory to god are you with me
[30:50] all right let's continue
[30:52] we realize that all the mysteries of god
[30:56] is made known to prophets and them alone
[30:58] amos 3 7
[31:00] hallelujah
[31:02] o praise the name of the lord so when
[31:04] the disciples was rocking the boat and
[31:07] jesus was the the voters rocking rather
[31:09] and they wake up jesus said master he
[31:11] said here am i careless not the dope you
[31:13] perish just in deep sleep you said no
[31:15] going on up there you say oh where is
[31:17] your faith or your little faith
[31:19] forgetting he is with us
[31:21] calling jesus on the scene to act people
[31:23] today said if if i could only know for
[31:26] sure that it was him
[31:27] if i could just be sure
[31:30] how could they be sure
[31:32] how was the disciples show of it now
[31:35] listen
[31:36] not because he was an educated man as
[31:38] far as we know he wasn't
[31:40] he only had the wisdom of god
[31:42] but we don't have no record of him ever
[31:44] going to school but some great priest or
[31:46] some great renowned person no we have no
[31:48] record of that how could they rest
[31:50] assured we are sure that there were the
[31:53] christ how could they because here we go
[31:56] they seen
[31:58] the promised word
[31:59] vindicated
[32:01] in other words made manifest
[32:05] make known
[32:10] so when you talk about sons of god
[32:12] bringing up the mysteries making them
[32:14] known
[32:15] you could make known by words
[32:17] and you could make known by
[32:19] manifestation
[32:20] in other words
[32:22] um um
[32:23] you could say well i i i will give you a
[32:26] cake
[32:27] a cake is what i'm going to make
[32:29] that's words
[32:30] when the cake is baked
[32:32] and presented and you cut a slice dining
[32:34] words you know
[32:36] you're tasting the cake
[32:38] as long as you're talking okay talk like
[32:40] a talk
[32:41] and it has to wait till you beat the egg
[32:43] and put the sugar and put whatever
[32:45] ingredients to make up the cake when the
[32:47] cake is baked
[32:49] then you have a cake you know
[32:51] not when it's mixing you know you have
[32:52] the mixer spilling it up no it'll be no
[32:54] nice cake mixture
[32:56] hallelujah you can make cupcakes with
[32:58] her but you want a whole cake
[33:00] oh glory to god will god have a whole
[33:03] word for the bride
[33:05] to be manifested
[33:06] or give the lord a shout
[33:08] and you have to be under expectation for
[33:11] manifestation
[33:13] if i train you to listen to talk you'll
[33:15] come he will talk on sunday and talk on
[33:17] wednesday and more talk and more talk
[33:19] and more talk but when you understand we
[33:22] have to walk the talk and we have to
[33:23] make a change that would make a revival
[33:26] when you understand you have something
[33:28] to do and you have the place to act then
[33:30] it's a different thing altogether it's
[33:32] not about me oh god it's about the
[33:34] prophecy
[33:35] oh give the lord i shout because the
[33:38] prophecy didn't come by gray matter the
[33:40] prophets didn't come by man's intellect
[33:42] the prophecy came by man as they were
[33:44] moved by the holy ghost
[33:47] oh glory to god in the same holy ghost
[33:49] that movement to fulfill the prophecy
[33:52] will the same holy ghost have to mount
[33:54] you
[33:55] to move you into action
[33:57] oh glory to god
[34:00] because the scene the promise was
[34:01] vindicated in other words mean manifest
[34:04] made known
[34:05] the living word i promise was made alive
[34:08] here we go
[34:09] projected right through that body
[34:14] and they knew that was god in him
[34:16] not letter
[34:18] to his actual body
[34:20] that's why the first sign of virtue when
[34:22] the woman pressed her way through all
[34:24] these men and touched jesus and he who
[34:26] touched my clothes
[34:29] so i felt virtue left me
[34:31] he had it that's why he could release it
[34:36] that woman didn't just judge flesh and
[34:38] blood
[34:39] she actually touched an access of power
[34:42] that ministered to her needs
[34:45] okay the lord i shall do you understand
[34:46] what i'm saying without a healing touch
[34:49] she was a dead woman in a short time
[34:51] but she needed something more than the
[34:53] men and women that were standing around
[34:55] jesus it made her desperate oh god have
[34:58] mercy
[34:59] did you get what i'm saying it made her
[35:02] desperate because she had a deep need
[35:07] [Applause]
[35:10] [Music]
[35:12] there are some people
[35:13] as long as you get injured with your bad
[35:15] attitude disrespects whatever you have
[35:16] and you feel it getting through life you
[35:18] don't need to change you know
[35:20] you bully your way you bounce your way
[35:22] through and everything else there's
[35:23] nobody needs a change in them
[35:24] no
[35:25] how about god they're still in the heat
[35:26] up
[35:27] that was god has changed the thing
[35:29] when that man came to jesus and bought
[35:31] my daughter and said come on come on
[35:32] pray for sheena yeah last he get courage
[35:34] he could call you because he said fast
[35:35] he's unstoppable she's all them people
[35:37] had to deal with somebody come and tell
[35:39] me forget their daughter dead
[35:43] how would you feel to be in that
[35:44] position
[35:45] when you now get the courage to break
[35:47] past the church membership and church
[35:48] leadership and in the spiritual
[35:50] environment around you

[35:53] actual deliverance and when you're about

[38:58] just a gloomy foggy day
[39:00] but in the evening time

[39:06] for 50-plus years
[39:08] the only year in the world
[39:10] here in the world
[39:11] hearing the word but the even light
[39:14] or is the same light as the morning
[39:16] light

[39:55] time the light will shine again
[39:58] it will be light and in this evening

[56:51] voice of god the last days
[56:57] [Music]
[56:59] you can take some more bumps
[57:02] you ready
[57:05] what did he ever say that i would as a
[57:06] lamp
[57:08] onto my feet
[57:09] and i light under my part
[57:11] if the lamp have no light they're
[57:12] problems
[57:14] but your wood is a lamp and in the lamp
[57:16] at the light
[57:17] here what the prophecy here now the word
[57:20] is what leads you to light
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:26] no matter how much observatories how
[57:28] many things the wise men why are you out
[57:30] of your mind two years was in traveling
[57:32] the past many nations say where you
[57:34] going we have seen a star
[57:36] in the east and we come to worship him
[57:39] and when they line up in jerusalem
[57:41] no national headquarters they didn't
[57:42] have the answer they went up and down
[57:44] the streets where is he born king of the
[57:47] jews they know nothing about it
[57:49] so they call on the word of the lord
[57:51] that followed that star was leading them
[57:53] to the eternal light guide us to thy
[57:55] perfect light i hear the bomb and the
[57:58] word
[57:58] is what guides you to light
[58:01] and the light is what makes the world
[58:03] vindicated
[58:08] so it's a little bit more than word word
[58:09] word word right
[58:11] you see it though
[58:12] i wanted to be trained to listen
[58:15] because somebody will come in their own
[58:16] name talking woodward woodward wood
[58:18] because you need them to bring more wood
[58:20] we say we don't need you we need okay so
[58:23] for abraham let's look at this now
[58:25] quickly
[58:28] abraham 25 years saying isaac prophecy
[58:31] god says so eyes are coming
[58:33] all so you know that you know people the
[58:35] doctors saying ibram cuckoo
[58:38] um abraham that didn't make no sense
[58:40] 25 years when god came down
[58:43] to vindicate or confirm the word he come
[58:45] and say i will return unto you
[58:48] and i not coming to tell you're coming
[58:55] do you see what i'm saying
[58:57] after 25 years an assurance come
[59:00] to confirm the prophecy is still on
[59:03] in other words this thing is still alive
[59:06] don't think this prophecy dead
[59:08] don't think because it's staying long
[59:10] it's dead
[59:11] i come to tell you this morning when an
[59:13] enemy coming like a flood the spirit
[59:15] raises a standard and take the same
[59:18] prophecy and make it more positive take
[59:21] the same word and make it more positive
[59:24] in other words the prophecy is alive
[59:26] today
[59:29] next 28 days time of life
[59:33] so here abraham
[59:35] angel gone
[59:36] i'm here saying oh god angel god what
[59:38] are you doing
[59:40] [Music]
[59:41] angel not on that abram
[59:44] angel gone
[59:45] prophecy is active his fate is no one
[59:48] anointed
[59:49] because he just got a word
[59:51] from the angel
[59:52] i will return him to dee
[59:54] and god's an angel in this last day a
[59:57] seventh angel messenger and we have a
[1:00:00] word a show with a prophecy from that
[1:00:02] angel of our time of life
[1:00:05] oh give the lord a shout that's why i'm
[1:00:08] still excited all glory to god when this
[1:00:11] message hit me when i was 17 years old i
[1:00:13] was excited god held all hell hallelujah
[1:00:17] might go like i was speaking tongues i
[1:00:18] couldn't help the excitement i could
[1:00:20] only be 64 years old and i'm just as
[1:00:23] excited as when i started out so don't
[1:00:25] tell me you're half dead half cold
[1:00:27] foolishness come on dallas you loud is
[1:00:29] here get back to god
[1:00:32] come back to the vindicated world
[1:00:37] the word
[1:00:38] is what guides the light
[1:00:40] and the light is what makes the wood
[1:00:42] vindicated
[1:00:44] oh blessed be in the name of the lord
[1:00:46] in the beginning god said that there'd
[1:00:47] be light and when the manifested word of
[1:00:49] god when the word of god was manifested
[1:00:51] there was light first god spoke it
[1:00:53] let there be light there's a word it
[1:00:55] might take a million years but when it's
[1:00:57] manifested then there's light
[1:00:59] praise god so man can say whatever you
[1:01:00] want we don't realize god
[1:01:02] when it's vindicated when it's
[1:01:04] manifested when it's confirmed well god
[1:01:06] said behold i sent you elijah the
[1:01:08] prophet and that was malachi 4 and
[1:01:11] william branham stepped right into that
[1:01:12] scripture that scripture is already
[1:01:14] fulfilled but there's another part to it
[1:01:17] and he
[1:01:18] shall turn
[1:01:20] the hearts of the children
[1:01:22] back to the faith
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:29] so all this word let me say this way all
[1:01:31] these mysteries histories revelations
[1:01:34] inspiration have to take us back to the
[1:01:35] fate
[1:01:36] where we manifest christ because the
[1:01:38] works vindicate the word

[1:01:45] lawyer here have a clue with lord what
[1:01:46] law you're talking about hallelujah

[1:02:31] after the prophet left i said are people
[1:02:33] playing prophet imposters and
[1:02:35] impersonators coming after the
[1:02:37] vindicated would go forth they can't
[1:02:39] come before they had to wait till the
[1:02:40] prophet speak they come and prop
[1:02:42] themselves up
[1:02:43] prop themselves up with the message of
[1:02:44] the hour and preach their own revelation

[1:04:18] and behave their self but they want to
[1:04:19] misbehave inside of here they will shut
[1:04:21] them out elsewhere but they want to open
[1:04:23] them up inside of here but feel free you
[1:04:26] free and i free to bless you rebuke your
[1:04:28] amen oh glory to god is not what freedom
[1:04:31] one way is freedom two ways i said this
[1:04:34] is not your father's house this is my
[1:04:36] father's house you can't come with your
[1:04:38] old ways and bring it inside of here
[1:04:39] we're going to smoke you out
[1:04:41] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:04:43] the passage of the house this morning
[1:04:45] hallelujah
[1:04:47] oh glory to god amen so in the beginning
[1:04:50] god said let there be light and when the
[1:04:52] manifested word of god when the word of
[1:04:54] god was manifested there was light god
[1:04:56] spoke it and what what if it didn't
[1:04:58] manifest then it wasn't like yet but
[1:05:01] when he spoke it then it was manifested
[1:05:04] vindicated his word was vindicated light
[1:05:07] come into existence so when you talk
[1:05:09] about the manifestation songs of god
[1:05:10] he's not about people preaching message
[1:05:15] if that is it we manifested long time
[1:05:17] last 50 years we manifested when he said
[1:05:19] he manifested the sons of god he doesn't
[1:05:21] want to communicate explaining something
[1:05:23] since i hope these words is helpful to
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] there are no manifestation i talk i talk
[1:05:28] talk talkification
[1:05:30] i don't know anything like talkification
[1:05:32] why don't manifesting sons of god he
[1:05:34] said he said um i'm a person of crops
[1:05:37] burning i send you rain
[1:05:39] so we had a dry season right now every
[1:05:41] time fire burning a fire burning here
[1:05:42] somebody have a whole field like they
[1:05:44] brought a line down here and manifesting
[1:05:46] sons of god you need rain i send you
[1:05:47] rain and neighbor jesus christ and that
[1:05:49] word
[1:05:51] go straight to his land
[1:05:53] create rain and fall right there
[1:05:56] that's something impossible
[1:05:57] impossible when moses said let there be
[1:06:00] frogs
[1:06:01] it's frogs coming in
[1:06:02] flies flight is coming you know out of
[1:06:04] his mug it was coming out you know
[1:06:06] oh glory to god and wait till them seven
[1:06:08] thunders order their voices to that
[1:06:11] group they could slice and cut they
[1:06:12] could open their mouth whatever they say
[1:06:14] they could shut the heavens
[1:06:21] out of the mouth of god
[1:06:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:27] and that's the only way it can be done
[1:06:29] now is when the word is vindicated god's
[1:06:33] written word is vindicated then it shows
[1:06:36] light
[1:06:37] oh my my my
[1:06:39] god word vindicated proved that the
[1:06:42] baptism of the holy ghost is just the
[1:06:44] same as it ever was on the day of

[1:07:33] let's continue on the omstress now the
[1:07:35] gospel came nothing more only but true
[1:07:38] power and manifestation of the word
[1:07:40] power and manifestation
[1:07:42] the word
[1:07:43] vindicated is the gospel
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:49] so the word preach is a seed of the
[1:07:51] gospel
[1:07:52] but when the word is vindicated that is
[1:07:54] the gospel so when he said go into all
[1:07:57] the world and preach the gospel he is
[1:08:00] talking about manifest his person
[1:08:03] manifestation
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:08] foreign
[1:08:09] he's coming for it a word
[1:08:11] vindicated bride
[1:08:13] hallelujah
[1:08:14] brother brown
[1:08:16] notice moses david reflected the coming
[1:08:18] of the perfect bridegroom so was luther
[1:08:20] wesley and pentecost reflected the
[1:08:22] coming of the perfect bride now notice
[1:08:24] these fellows appeared to talk about
[1:08:26] these fortunately these guys
[1:08:28] let's call them for now these guys
[1:08:30] goddang anointed yeah they just yes
[1:08:32] right now they're false
[1:08:34] only many rainfall they could be
[1:08:36] anointed
[1:08:37] i thought it dries a biscuit
[1:08:39] because the money coming for on
[1:08:40] everybody you know
[1:08:42] oh if you thought it's going coming on
[1:08:44] you no it'll come at the bright face
[1:08:48] you saw trying to change the
[1:08:50] money
[1:08:51] and they say by a certain time you had
[1:08:53] to bring in all the old dollars
[1:08:55] so if they're coming
[1:08:56] all the way to spend by
[1:08:58] respecting that that has zero value you
[1:09:00] can have a million of those dollars
[1:09:02] it has zero value you were supposed to
[1:09:04] send it in by time
[1:09:08] so you have to get the original first
[1:09:11] which is you the money the currency
[1:09:12] first so god after anointing bride first
[1:09:15] should be called aside and anointed
[1:09:17] hallelujah to show them this is my bride
[1:09:20] and then the others get anointed
[1:09:21] afterwards they say are we doing what
[1:09:22] you're doing too
[1:09:25] but the seed is all going to make the
[1:09:27] difference
[1:09:28] now let me tell you let me comfort you
[1:09:29] now the rain coming
[1:09:32] don't worry about that you know worry
[1:09:34] about the seed
[1:09:35] they want your planting
[1:09:37] you know if you don't plant i don't know
[1:09:38] whether it's come from tea mario and
[1:09:39] weed something i know where there's come
[1:09:41] from
[1:09:41] the land could be dry or clean in land
[1:09:43] and whatnot yeah planting them things
[1:09:44] you know just rain fall and they're
[1:09:46] coming
[1:09:48] i have no plan anything it will take
[1:09:50] over your land
[1:09:53] they have a gift to be there i don't
[1:09:54] know what the birds bring i don't know
[1:09:56] but the deer
[1:09:57] so therefore as a farmer you have to
[1:09:59] plant your seed
[1:10:04] you're not controlling the sonoran
[1:10:06] you can say really i demand you in jesus
[1:10:07] name they come out tomorrow
[1:10:10] and sunlight sunshine better don't stay
[1:10:12] away tonight you know can need a dryness
[1:10:15] or need this no you can't talk to you
[1:10:16] something like that it's not going to
[1:10:18] come out and shine on you just like that
[1:10:19] ignore you
[1:10:21] you're not controlling that so all your
[1:10:23] action as a fisherman to fish as a
[1:10:25] farmer to plant is in fate
[1:10:28] when a fisherman put on his line you
[1:10:29] know he catching you know crab snake
[1:10:31] while being away
[1:10:33] king fish shack you don't know where
[1:10:34] catching there you know by fate you're
[1:10:35] putting it
[1:10:36] and you're pulling your feet back
[1:10:39] when you're taking somebody that big old
[1:10:40] tire coming up
[1:10:43] you're going to fish retire you're going
[1:10:44] to fish a fish
[1:10:46] you see what i'm talking about now
[1:10:47] so i am saying your attitude and action
[1:10:50] has to be one of fate god i trust you
[1:10:52] this morning i stretch it for my loved
[1:10:54] ones i stop worrying
[1:10:56] searching for my family i stopped
[1:10:57] worrying
[1:10:58] structure for the future
[1:11:00] your future is in god

[1:11:38] doctrine but after their own lust
[1:11:41] you see it's what inside of you
[1:11:43] what you're calling for
[1:11:45] hallelujah after their own lusts shall
[1:11:47] heap for themselves teachers have an
[1:11:49] itching ears

[1:12:19] you he's longing for you he wants to
[1:12:21] transform you by the renewing of your
[1:12:24] mind

[1:12:29] which you are part of that desires in
[1:12:31] you and he sent his transforming power

[1:12:40] his transforming power his word
[1:12:42] vindicated proven to bring you out of
[1:12:44] this religious deformity of ignorance
[1:12:47] that you're walking in naked blind
[1:12:48] miserable don't even know it oh blessed
[1:12:51] be the name of the lord but a random
[1:12:53] reading saying you know they will come
[1:12:54] in their name and you will receive them
[1:12:56] quoting jesus you won't receive me
[1:12:59] the word vindicated and proven before
[1:13:01] you as he was right then so he's today
[1:13:03] don't you miss that people across this
[1:13:05] nation another will come at church and
[1:13:07] you believe that because you just do any
[1:13:10] way i won't vindicate it he's never any
[1:13:13] time vindicated anything in our church
[1:13:15] outside of the message i was given
[1:13:16] looter justification wesley sonification
[1:13:19] pentecostal restoration of the gift and
[1:13:21] after that as soon as they make the
[1:13:22] nomination they died he said i oh praise
[1:13:26] god
[1:13:27] i'm almost done here he said but they
[1:13:28] love
[1:13:30] their traditions more than they love the
[1:13:34] vindicated word of god and that's what i
[1:13:36] discover and you know some time ago i
[1:13:38] also have problems with brother brown
[1:13:40] talk about three kind of believers i
[1:13:42] just couldn't catch the unbeliever
[1:13:45] i could see they make believers the
[1:13:46] sneaky one
[1:13:47] looking for it to make a mistake looking
[1:13:49] for something happens
[1:13:50] they never really believed just waiting
[1:13:52] for something to neg the people like
[1:13:53] that waiting to grace aha you see you
[1:13:55] see you see you see you see right you
[1:13:56] see
[1:13:57] i had a true believer but the unbeliever
[1:13:59] smart guy
[1:14:00] he believed to him about the unwon
[1:14:04] they're choosing what they believe
[1:14:07] and their ministers who preaching this
[1:14:08] message were unbelievable
[1:14:10] they don't believe the prophet
[1:14:13] they believe themselves
[1:14:15] they believe what commented them they
[1:14:17] believed their vision of the revelation
[1:14:19] i remember time we wanted to get we
[1:14:21] wanted to get a picture painted of the
[1:14:22] cloud so he went to this artist to kill
[1:14:25] him picture come and when
[1:14:27] when we go back the picture it was
[1:14:28] completely completely different
[1:14:30] she said but they know what we want we
[1:14:32] want to pick a picture of the club to
[1:14:33] hang up she said well i pinned my
[1:14:34] interpretation of it
[1:14:38] i think we paid
[1:14:40] peterman get away you know now you give
[1:14:42] a picture to paint but she actually
[1:14:45] painted an interpretation her
[1:14:46] interpretation
[1:14:48] what have we seen for a while now
[1:14:50] everybody could hear the same thing but
[1:14:51] they're not processing the same way
[1:14:53] all heard the word but it was mixed that
[1:14:55] wasn't mixed with fate with everybody
[1:14:57] and god wasn't pleased with everybody so
[1:14:58] even though we're preaching this and
[1:15:00] we're hearing everybody the same thing
[1:15:01] what go into your mind your thoughts
[1:15:05] i don't know what going through it
[1:15:07] that is where we divine revelation
[1:15:09] because when the spirit comes it won't
[1:15:11] reveal one way
[1:15:12] his way
[1:15:13] god's way
[1:15:15] oh my
[1:15:17] hallelujah
[1:15:18] what about him says now lord triest by
[1:15:20] your spirit if there be any evil among
[1:15:22] us lord any unbelief of the word any
[1:15:25] person here father that will not
[1:15:26] puncture every promise of god with an
[1:15:28] amen may the holy spirit come down now
[1:15:30] the white horse rider while his spirit
[1:15:32] the spirit of christ and the feast of
[1:15:33] antichrist call his own call him out may
[1:15:36] they now repent come quickly to you
[1:15:37] father and be filled with the oil and
[1:15:39] wine and be changed from the
[1:15:41] denominational robe of cain's debt unto
[1:15:44] the snow white robe of eternal life
[1:15:46] given all by the bridegroom and then
[1:15:48] they will go out here we go they will go
[1:15:50] out to the wedding supper someday in the
[1:15:52] vindicated word of the resurrection
[1:15:55] oh my hallelujah do you love him this
[1:15:57] morning
[1:15:59] notice the vindicated word in his body
[1:16:02] is the very victory and the reason for
[1:16:04] his death oh my hallelujah
[1:16:07] children of disobedience rebelled
[1:16:09] against abel's revealed revelation
[1:16:12] vindicated of god that he was righteous
[1:16:14] there's a few more we're going to close
[1:16:16] and today
[1:16:17] the world today is dedicating themselves
[1:16:19] to the knowledge which came by satan
[1:16:22] dedicating themselves to what
[1:16:24] knowledge
[1:16:25] and man's day is glorified not the word
[1:16:28] of god but by the knowledge he has
[1:16:31] that's what man is evident by he no
[1:16:33] plenty he he he he he know measures a
[1:16:35] long time
[1:16:36] man's days glorified by the man his
[1:16:40] works man's works are exalted above
[1:16:42] god's word and manifested works the
[1:16:45] wisdom of satan which he gives the eve
[1:16:47] at the beginning now listen don't miss
[1:16:48] this the wisdom of satan is exalted to
[1:16:51] the throne of worship in man above the
[1:16:54] vindicated word of god for the hour
[1:16:57] our churches proves that by schools of
[1:16:59] learning
[1:17:01] that they learn more than god's word
[1:17:02] knows about it
[1:17:04] they have exalted listen their own
[1:17:06] knowledge so-called from satan
[1:17:10] above the vindicated promise of god
[1:17:12] made clear before them
[1:17:14] people believe in that denomination more
[1:17:16] than they believe god
[1:17:18] and god is the word god is the word and
[1:17:20] he exalts himself above all that's
[1:17:23] called god and there's only one god and
[1:17:25] god is the word
[1:17:27] he said watch
[1:17:29] christ's bride fell for it before and
[1:17:30] took the intellectual knowledge of some
[1:17:32] seminary preacher instead of believing
[1:17:34] pure vindicated word the anointed ones
[1:17:36] jesus said they are teaching for
[1:17:38] doctrine the interpretation of the
[1:17:40] scripture of man see not the word of god
[1:17:42] not his vindicated word i'm going to
[1:17:44] close with this and this is where i get
[1:17:46] the title from
[1:17:47] but abandoned today
[1:17:49] instead we're going to play something
[1:17:50] instead of the church doing that
[1:17:53] we sell out a membership
[1:17:55] start off bringing them in
[1:17:57] anything get more than the methodist has
[1:17:59] got or the baptist has got get more than
[1:18:01] the oneness has oneness has more than
[1:18:03] the trinity or the one two-nil so what i
[1:18:05] don't know it's a bunch of worldlies
[1:18:07] it's a bunch of nonsense come back to
[1:18:09] god
[1:18:10] and his vindicated word
[1:18:11] that's where i get it from come back to
[1:18:13] god and then again
[1:18:14] don't be caught up in facebook
[1:18:16] youtube
[1:18:17] what kind of preachers people saying
[1:18:19] things and the same thing you never hear
[1:18:20] before and they stimulate you another
[1:18:22] jewish man they'll be talking jewish
[1:18:24] thing and they caught them in that with
[1:18:25] some kind of sticks and water you have
[1:18:27] kind of jewish jewelry and ritual and
[1:18:29] whatnot but does not do with what we are
[1:18:31] talking about here
[1:18:33] that has nothing to do with promising
[1:18:35] the bride he said when you see the
[1:18:37] message the rest is full of material
[1:18:39] come on man
[1:18:40] god give you a gift give him a box it
[1:18:43] wrap about all kind of tinsel and
[1:18:44] whatnot you're untied a gift you untie
[1:18:47] the paper you rip off the paper you take
[1:18:48] off the box all the little stringy thing
[1:18:50] you take all that and you get to the
[1:18:51] gift

[1:18:54] thing be the main thing
