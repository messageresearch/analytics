[21:54] may god bless you richly for this
[21:58] yes the time we live in
[22:01] is a special time everything
[22:04] is heading towards a final climax
[22:08] satan is building his eden unstoppable
[22:12] as it was in the days of sodom so it is
[22:15] here on earth today
[22:18] we need much grace to hold on to what we
[22:21] have already received
[22:23] and what we possess and we need a lot of
[22:27] grace
[22:27] that the bride may come into her stature
[22:30] of
[22:30] christ because there's a final verb for
[22:33] the bride
[22:34] that only the bride will have
[22:38] she is the final voice to the final age
[22:42] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1
[22:46] speaks of the cloud of witnesses around
[22:49] us
[22:51] yes they cannot be completed
[22:55] without us and we cannot stand
[22:58] without them here on earth as the body
[23:01] of jesus christ
[23:03] they are a part of christ they are a
[23:05] part of us
[23:06] since we too are part of christ
[23:10] it is restoration time
[23:13] the bride will stand on this earth in
[23:15] her full stature
[23:18] the promises for this day are so
[23:22] unique never before has there been a
[23:26] group of people on earth
[23:28] who have been given this kind of
[23:30] promises
[23:32] listen what the prophet said of this
[23:35] time
[23:40] and they could not be made perfect
[23:42] without us
[23:44] and now the entire holy spirit
[23:47] visits the church making god in human
[23:50] flesh
[23:51] as he did before sodom the burning there
[23:54] which was a type then abraham
[23:58] he appeared to him and all the things
[24:01] that he hasn't done down through the
[24:04] ages
[24:05] in the church ages he is now doing
[24:10] back to the world because the messages
[24:12] and the messages and the messages
[24:15] has to wind up in the entire world
[24:19] and in the last days the seven seals
[24:21] being open was to pick up
[24:23] every struggle that's been left off in
[24:26] it
[24:27] and make the whole thing in one great
[24:30] big body of the bride that them
[24:34] who lived back there was not perfect
[24:36] until
[24:37] this church be perfected the bright
[24:40] group
[24:41] in the last days to bring them in
[24:44] and all together be taken up see
[24:51] the bright group has to be perfected
[24:55] to bring them in think about brothers
[24:58] and sisters
[25:00] they are awaiting of us that we will
[25:03] come
[25:04] into our position they depend on us
[25:09] what a responsibility for the bride
[25:12] today
[25:13] adoption time placing of suns
[25:18] the next quote i like to share with you
[25:20] is so deep for me
[25:21] i really cannot explain how how it will
[25:24] be
[25:26] but something on my inside is pulling
[25:29] while i'm reading this quote of the
[25:31] prophet
[25:32] i am so glad to see him personify
[25:36] himself right among us
[25:38] i'm longing to see this manifested in
[25:41] our day
[25:42] we live on the edge when our eyes are
[25:44] opened
[25:46] listen what the prophet said
[25:52] but i'm not him
[25:57] but he is standing among you and his
[26:00] shoes i am not
[26:01] worthy to lose when he comes
[26:04] makes his self known and today he is
[26:08] standing among
[26:08] us in the person of the holy ghost
[26:12] manifesting himself more and more coming
[26:15] into his church
[26:17] making himself known because him and the
[26:20] bride
[26:21] and the group will be the same
[26:24] making himself known
[26:27] and one day you will see that the one
[26:30] that you feel in your heart
[26:32] and see his identification will become
[26:35] personalized before you then you
[26:38] and he are one
[26:41] you are united by the word and the word
[26:44] was in the beginning
[26:46] will go back to the beginning which is
[26:48] god
[26:50] and that day you will know
[26:54] that i am in the father father the
[26:56] father in me
[26:58] i in you and you in me hallelujah
[27:02] we are here hallelujah i am so glad to
[27:04] see him personifying himself
[27:07] right among us and see what he promised
[27:10] for the world
[27:11] not what somebody's emotions singing and
[27:14] jumping and dancing but by his
[27:18] word amen he is making
[27:21] himself known
[27:25] oh hallelujah are we
[27:29] in a real expectation to see
[27:32] this promise manifested
[27:36] brothers and sisters i appreciate
[27:40] you holding such a virtual conference
[27:44] there in ghana to strengthen the bride
[27:46] of christ
[27:47] so that she can come together in one
[27:50] accord
[27:51] and in harmony we know
[27:54] that this goes along with the placing of
[27:57] sons
[27:57] the adoption time which is a noble topic
[28:01] for this conference
[28:03] this is a topic that if the lord tarries
[28:06] will
[28:06] certainly carry us through the coming
[28:08] year 2021
[28:11] my most fervent wish is
[28:15] that the bride of christ
[28:18] will come closer denominational walls
[28:22] will be torn down
[28:24] doctrines will give way to the revealed
[28:27] word of this hour
[28:28] and the perfect love of god will take
[28:32] shape in our hearts god bless you
[28:36] all mightily there in ghana i am joined
[28:39] to you with my heart
[28:42] i want to close while we listen to a
[28:44] quote from the prophet
[28:52] what's the next verse having a form of
[28:54] godliness
[28:55] but denying the power thereof
[28:59] no spiritual discernment
[29:02] when you got spiritual discernment and
[29:04] the holy ghost is upon you you have
[29:06] spiritual discernment
[29:08] it says amen to every promise of god
[29:12] paul said those days would be we got it
[29:14] it's here it's on us
[29:16] and we look and see it we hear it from
[29:20] everywhere

[29:24] together
[29:25] the bible said assimin ourselves
[29:27] together and that's the more when you
[29:28] see that day approaching
[29:31] it ought to be one revival after another

[29:36] every church and every place

[29:40] churches with one heart and one accord

[29:44] man-made theology and crown

[38:46] the blessings that they have been to us
[38:48] down through the years and thank you for
[38:50] your labor
[38:51] especially in this convention god richly
[38:54] bless you
[38:56] so today um i would like to speak on the
[39:00] topic preparation for the manifestation
[39:03] of the sons of god
[39:05] and that's a topic that we all know
[39:06] about and brother solomon's gathers
[39:09] together in this
[39:10] manifestation of the sons of god revival
[39:13] services
[39:14] and um i believe brother solomon's
[39:16] inspiration is
[39:17] the placing of sons adoption time and
[39:20] adult
[39:21] and at adoption time that's when sons of
[39:24] god are going to be
[39:25] manifested born sons true sons failed
[39:28] sons
[39:29] placed sons adopted sons are going to be
[39:31] manifested and they split to the world
[39:34] what the eternal life that they have in
[39:36] jesus christ means
[39:37] like it was said of christ uh um we
[39:40] beheld this life
[39:41] the life as of the the glory as of the
[39:44] only begotten son of god
[39:45] and this bride when she's anointed
[39:48] as police sons adopted sons that same
[39:52] eternal life which was with the father
[39:54] which was
[39:54] in the sun and which has been packed
[39:57] passed on to this bride
[39:58] him in the form of a word message will
[40:00] be manifested one more time and one more
[40:03] time the war will see
[40:04] and hear direct from god as he did on
[40:06] the day of pentecost
[40:07] so my title preparation for the
[40:09] manifestation
[40:10] of the sons of god um
[40:14] i got a few corner scriptures genesis 1
[40:17] verses 26 to 28
[40:19] and genesis 2 and verse 7. also romans 8
[40:22] verses 18 through 23 now romans 8 verse
[40:26] 19
[40:27] says are are written these wise for the
[40:29] earnest
[40:30] expectation of the creature waited for
[40:33] the manifestation of the sons of god
[40:35] i'm sorry you may be seated if i haven't
[40:37] as you sit down
[40:38] already and if you're not seen already
[40:40] you may please be seated
[40:42] god bless you so romans 8 19 says for
[40:45] the earnest expectation of the creature
[40:47] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[40:49] of god
[40:51] now only two people in the bible
[40:54] were categorically stated to be sons of
[40:57] god
[40:57] now the rest of us we know where else is
[41:00] it was only spoken
[41:01] in their genealogy uh a description of
[41:04] them spoken
[41:06] of as sons of god the lord jesus christ
[41:10] and adam who was said of adam the son of
[41:14] god
[41:14] jesus christ the son of god but the rest
[41:17] of us
[41:18] become sons of god of course we always
[41:21] were sons we was
[41:23] a son of god like adam way back before
[41:25] definition of the world
[41:26] we were all veiled in the son of god
[41:28] jesus christ but
[41:29] when we started being displayed and
[41:32] manifested on the face of the earth
[41:34] only two sons the original son of god
[41:39] god's example sits on jesus christ was
[41:41] one and then adam was the other one
[41:44] that was called the son of god the rest
[41:46] of us
[41:47] become sons of god
[41:50] so here is this uh uh our um
[41:53] topic here before us the manifestation
[41:56] of the sons of god
[41:57] and we know we are sons of god the bible
[42:00] says beloved now are we the sons of god
[42:03] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[42:05] but we know that when he shall appear
[42:07] we shall be like him so we know we are
[42:09] sons of god
[42:11] and it's for a reason that only adam and
[42:14] jesus christ were
[42:15] expressly stated to be sons of god
[42:18] because
[42:18] way back before the foundation of the
[42:20] world got in his plans
[42:22] when he was in labor pains bringing
[42:25] forth sons god had this plan which you
[42:27] know the story
[42:28] had the plan his purpose his desire to
[42:31] have sons
[42:32] on the face of the earth who will
[42:33] manifest his eternal life
[42:35] who will show forth his life and his
[42:37] life is eternal life
[42:39] show for his life and that life will
[42:41] display god
[42:42] that life will show for god in this
[42:44] world here
[42:45] on this earth and and and
[42:48] that life will be a display
[42:52] an expression of god who god is
[42:55] his being how he lives how he behaves
[42:58] himself
[42:59] his attributes characteristics to to
[43:02] rule to reign to
[43:03] to to to to to do things on visas that
[43:06] only god can do
[43:08] and god determine in his wisdom
[43:12] that adam will be the first one and the
[43:13] original plan was that
[43:15] after adam all the sons will come forth
[43:17] and adam will
[43:18] speak these sons from the from the uh uh
[43:21] uh
[43:21] from the from the ground from the earth
[43:24] uh
[43:25] just like adam himself was made from
[43:27] god's hands
[43:28] right straight from the from from from
[43:30] the from the earth
[43:32] all the suns were to come forth and adam
[43:34] was gonna was supposed to speak them
[43:36] but before he could get to that spot he
[43:38] fell
[43:39] by sin and god had to move on with the
[43:42] program god
[43:42] god had to have an alternate program
[43:45] which is all in god's plan
[43:47] because all of these things were done by
[43:48] god to bring forth his attributes and
[43:50] his characteristics who he
[43:52] is expressing all his characteristics so
[43:55] nothing out of cater
[43:56] but god's original plan adam couldn't
[43:59] wait adam couldn't wait to fulfill that
[44:02] and so god had to change the plan so
[44:03] once adam came as the son of god none of
[44:06] us
[44:06] who are also sons of god like adam could
[44:09] come like he did
[44:12] and the only one that could come after
[44:14] that was jesus christ
[44:16] our lord himself the example sits on god
[44:19] himself
[44:20] god himself was the only one who could
[44:23] come exactly
[44:24] the son of god on the face of the earth
[44:26] because he wasn't born
[44:28] like the provided way that adam sin made
[44:30] us ought to come
[44:31] by he was born right straight by the
[44:34] spirit of the living god exactly
[44:36] how we would have been born if adam had
[44:38] not fallen by sin
[44:41] so here we are the bible says romans 8
[44:45] every creature all creation is longing
[44:49] and
[44:49] waiting and looking for the
[44:51] manifestation of the sons of god
[44:54] why because all creation
[44:58] all nature was created when was created
[45:01] this earth was created so
[45:02] sons of god will inhabit it and express
[45:05] god on the face of this earth that was
[45:07] the program that was the plan
[45:10] and adam came here as the son of god the
[45:13] original son
[45:14] and god gave him absolute total control
[45:17] and power and authority over this earth
[45:19] and adam had this at the right under
[45:21] control he
[45:22] ruled and bestowed the earth like a son
[45:25] of god
[45:26] with full power and authority on the
[45:28] face of the earth for god
[45:30] nature adam was the master of the earth
[45:33] nature
[45:34] obedience the wings obeyed him this the
[45:37] the
[45:37] the elements obeyed him and adam could
[45:41] do
[45:41] anything he wanted the face of this idea
[45:43] and nature was happy
[45:45] because that's the purpose nature was
[45:46] created for but once
[45:48] adam singh and fell he lost
[45:51] all control over nature once adam seen
[45:54] and fell
[45:55] he became corrupted and with him all
[45:58] nature fell
[45:59] and all nature was corrupted and so
[46:01] nature since that time has not been
[46:03] able to fulfill the purpose god created
[46:06] for
[46:08] and that's why all nature has grown in
[46:10] crying longing to go back
[46:12] to that purpose for which god created
[46:15] amen
[46:16] in the first place and nature has been
[46:19] subject to made subject to vanity like
[46:21] adam
[46:22] since adam fell nature has been all
[46:24] nature all
[46:25] creature has been subject to vanity
[46:30] corruption all these natural disasters
[46:35] climate change nature is all the
[46:38] earthquakes and the tornadoes and the
[46:40] storms
[46:41] all nature is groaning crying
[46:44] longing to go back to that place to
[46:47] where
[46:47] it will fulfill its purpose that god
[46:50] created it for and that's why nature
[46:52] itself is groaning crying
[46:54] longing for the sons of god to be
[46:56] manifested because
[46:57] nature knows and believes that promise
[47:00] the sons of god are coming back
[47:02] nature knows there's a promise hanging
[47:03] over sons of god that they're going to
[47:05] come back to where adam was
[47:07] before he fell by sin nature knows that
[47:09] so
[47:10] all nature all creature is longing
[47:12] groaning for that time
[47:14] because nature knows once adam is
[47:17] restored back adam once adam's
[47:19] race is restored back to the original
[47:21] place
[47:22] it's rightful place as blessed sons
[47:26] adopted sons manifested sons nature
[47:29] knows that it
[47:30] also will be restored back and delivered
[47:32] into the glorious liberty
[47:34] of the sons of god so all nature is
[47:37] growing and we ourselves grown within
[47:39] ourselves
[47:40] longing for that adoption time and so
[47:44] we know there's promise a manifestation
[47:47] of the sons of god
[47:48] we know there's promise a time when
[47:51] god's sons are gonna
[47:53] be restored back to their rightful
[47:55] condition
[47:56] like nature we we ourselves are groaning
[47:58] like nature groaning to
[48:00] go back into our ought to be conditioned
[48:03] and like brother branham told us that's
[48:04] why
[48:04] when we get sick we want to get well
[48:06] because we know of a place where we did
[48:08] not have to be sick in the first
[48:10] instance all nature is groaning
[48:14] and so we look forward with anticipation
[48:16] for this time
[48:18] the manifestion of the sons of god amen
[48:21] but more important than than than
[48:23] looking for the time more important than
[48:25] the event itself
[48:26] is to know how to get there how to get
[48:29] to that event
[48:30] because it's not about knowing about the
[48:32] event it's knowing about
[48:34] how to make sure when that event happens
[48:37] you and i will be a part of that event
[48:39] and that's why we're gonna know how to
[48:41] prepare for the event
[48:42] we're gonna know how to prepare to make
[48:45] sure
[48:45] that we are part of that event when the
[48:48] event actually does happen
[48:51] revelation 9 7 says let us be glad and
[48:54] rejoice and give honor to him
[48:56] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[48:58] and his bride has made herself ready
[49:00] so we want to make ourselves ready so
[49:02] that when this manifestation of the
[49:04] students have gone this adoption time
[49:05] strikes
[49:06] you and i will be a partaker of it
[49:08] brother banham says the church is going
[49:09] to be there
[49:10] but it's up to me it's up to you to make
[49:13] sure we are
[49:14] going to be there by the grace of god we
[49:16] know we are predestinated
[49:17] from before definition of the world and
[49:19] we know we are going to be there and
[49:21] all that we need to do to be there the
[49:23] holy spirit himself in us
[49:25] will work his way out amen and make sure
[49:28] that
[49:28] we are there by the grace of almighty
[49:31] god because we are predestinated
[49:32] to take that glorious stand so preparing
[49:36] to be there
[49:38] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[49:40] preparation for the manifestion of the
[49:42] sons of god
[49:42] now the strength of preparation is very
[49:45] basic and very fundamental
[49:47] to human existence it's a is a human
[49:50] commonality that we just have to prepare
[49:53] we do it without even thinking
[49:55] preparation is part and parcel
[49:57] of the human experience god made it that
[50:00] way god
[50:01] built it into human existence that we
[50:03] prepare before if
[50:04] events though that have to happen we
[50:06] prepare before
[50:08] we before before we do anything we
[50:10] prepare
[50:11] to get results that we want to we could
[50:13] prepare poorly we could prepare very
[50:15] well
[50:16] but the results we get depends uh the
[50:18] results we get depend on the quality of
[50:21] the preparation
[50:22] that we bring forward to to the effort
[50:25] after the effort on hand so if i have an
[50:27] event
[50:28] coming up next year i start preparing
[50:31] for that event
[50:32] so preparation is a very very
[50:34] fundamental
[50:35] uh and basic part of the human
[50:38] experience and preparation is god's way
[50:42] that he has whipped into life
[50:44] to make sure that we get life right to
[50:46] make sure that we get
[50:48] uh ready for the event so that we will
[50:51] go through
[50:51] life not just happening things just
[50:54] happening to us and we are reacting to
[50:55] things
[50:56] but we are we prepare for uh uh uh the
[51:00] the events
[51:01] of life and this whole life in itself
[51:04] our very
[51:05] whole existence on the face of the earth
[51:08] is a preparation
[51:09] we are here in preparation for when we
[51:12] live here
[51:13] so life is about a preparation
[51:14] preparation is basic
[51:17] and it's a very very fundamental
[51:21] our principle in human existence and
[51:24] preparation time
[51:25] it's time to get ready let us be glad
[51:27] and rejoice for his bride has made
[51:29] herself ready she has spent a period of
[51:30] time to get herself ready
[51:32] so that she'll be there at the wedding
[51:33] supper in the skies and
[51:35] it's her job to get herself ready amen
[51:40] so preparation time is getting ready
[51:42] time
[51:43] uh brother branham said on the message
[51:46] um revelation chapter five part two
[51:50] now he's preparing for the opening of
[51:52] those seven seals of redemption see
[51:54] that's what the fifth chapter is that's
[51:56] the reason i cannot read it and then
[51:58] just take it from there
[52:00] and talk on it and give the other parts
[52:02] of the scripture is because it isn't
[52:04] vast by vast
[52:05] something that's happening it's
[52:06] preparing for something to happen
[52:08] in other words before nothing happens
[52:10] there's a preparation
[52:12] before the thing happens before it can
[52:14] happen there's got to be a preparation
[52:17] is preparing for something to happen it
[52:20] continues
[52:20] and if you get the preparation right
[52:23] then
[52:23] you are ready for it then and that's the
[52:26] way it is by faith
[52:27] or with anything else amen so if you get
[52:30] the preparation right
[52:32] we'll get the main event exactly right
[52:36] so we thank god to understand these
[52:38] things we thank god for
[52:39] a prophet who uh uh uh um
[52:42] reveal these things to us who taught us
[52:45] these things
[52:47] now talking about preparation
[52:50] if you prepare rightly like i just read
[52:53] to you brother banham said
[52:55] you are ready for the main event then
[52:57] and we're talking about a preparation
[52:58] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[53:00] so we want to get the manifestation
[53:02] right we want to be sure that we are
[53:04] there we are there we are part of the
[53:07] manifestation of the sunset we are part
[53:09] of those sons
[53:10] that are going to be complacent born
[53:12] sons
[53:13] adopted sons manifested sons but here
[53:17] while we are working towards that we
[53:19] gotta get the preparation right
[53:21] and brother banham said of preparation
[53:23] to get the preparation right
[53:25] three things here number one you've got
[53:27] to know
[53:28] and have a very very uh uh uh clear
[53:32] understanding of of what what it is you
[53:35] are preparing for
[53:37] number one a clear-cut understanding
[53:41] very clear vision
[53:42] of what it is you are preparing for
[53:44] number two
[53:45] a clear vision and understand of the
[53:49] steps that you need to take to get to
[53:52] what you are preparing for to receive
[53:54] and get
[53:54] what you are preparing for it's not
[53:56] enough to know what you are preparing
[53:58] for
[53:58] we are praying for the manifestation of
[54:00] the sons of god number two
[54:02] how do we get to this manifestation of
[54:05] so what are the steps
[54:06] involved in getting us to this
[54:08] manifestation of the sons of god
[54:10] and number three simple just carry out
[54:13] the steps
[54:13] get in action get in action with the
[54:17] steps to become a manifestation of god
[54:21] amen and that's exactly what god did
[54:25] god always prepares there's nothing that
[54:28] he does
[54:29] but what he prepares because the
[54:31] preparation
[54:32] is the principle that comes straight
[54:34] from the mind of god himself
[54:36] because god knows that life
[54:39] got with preparation into life so that
[54:43] we can get the best out of life we can
[54:45] get the best out of life here
[54:47] and the best out of life after here when
[54:50] we prepare and prepare very rightly
[54:53] and brother branham he told us that god
[54:56] always prepares amen always prepare
[54:58] whatever god does
[55:00] he prepares for it on a message uh from
[55:03] 1953 11 11 53
[55:05] preparation brother branham said now
[55:07] preparation
[55:08] god before he does anything he always
[55:11] prepares for it
[55:14] as he spoke in the bible before we go
[55:16] over to fight a war
[55:18] like jesus said no man's going to be at
[55:21] the house he sits down
[55:22] and says whether he has enough to do it
[55:25] any man going to fight a war he sits
[55:26] down
[55:27] to see whether he has enough to fight
[55:29] the war or he will start the war and
[55:31] find that he did not have
[55:33] what he took so that's all about
[55:34] preparation
[55:37] quote before we go to fight a war first
[55:40] we have to prepare for that war
[55:42] if you are going to get married you
[55:44] prepare for that time
[55:46] and you have preparations and before you
[55:49] come to church
[55:49] you made preparations the ambulance to
[55:52] bring you
[55:53] or your loved ones to bring you or you
[55:55] had to get a certain amount of money
[55:56] ready
[55:57] before you could come it's all
[55:59] preparations
[56:00] and god always prepares and god always
[56:04] prepares
[56:05] the people for the events that's just
[56:08] about to happen
[56:10] that's who god is so god this
[56:12] manifestation of the sons of god
[56:14] is not something that's catching him
[56:15] unawares god always prepares so god
[56:18] was preparing for this manifestation of
[56:20] the sons of god from way back
[56:22] before the foundations of the world and
[56:23] as a matter of fact
[56:25] god before the definition of the world
[56:27] which you know the story
[56:28] we all know the story because we ha we
[56:31] we have
[56:32] been privileged to have heard the voice
[56:33] of god spoke to us
[56:35] through a prophet a 20th century prophet
[56:38] a vindicated prophet
[56:39] who had the word of the lord and brother
[56:42] branham taught us
[56:42] and let us understand that way back
[56:45] before the foundation of the world way
[56:47] back before the beginning way back
[56:49] before there was the stars the
[56:51] the moon the sun the milky way the
[56:54] galaxies the universe god dwelt all
[56:56] alone by himself
[56:58] and god dwelt in light that no man could
[57:01] approach
[57:02] where god was all alone by himself and
[57:05] he was known at that time not as god
[57:06] but as elohim ela elohim the
[57:09] self-existent one the one who existed
[57:11] all by himself and in him
[57:13] he had thought he had he had he had he
[57:15] had thoughts about what he would like to
[57:17] do
[57:18] in this future coming because he was
[57:22] from the deathless endless eternity past
[57:26] no man can get there he dwelled in light
[57:28] unapproachable light
[57:30] where he dwelt all by himself he was
[57:32] spirit
[57:33] no certain form but spirit
[57:36] uncovered all space and time
[57:40] and on the back part of his
[57:43] spirit mind he had these thoughts on him
[57:47] in
[57:47] in him and all of these thoughts the
[57:50] bomb call it you put it all together and
[57:52] call it a 3-4 mystery
[57:54] and the sum total of all of this year
[57:56] was that god
[57:58] elohim wanted to have
[58:01] sons who would represent him sons
[58:05] who will display him sons who will be in
[58:08] fellowship with him sons
[58:09] who will express his characteristics to
[58:12] the world that he was gonna form in the
[58:14] future
[58:15] sons who will be an expression of his
[58:18] being of his character of his being
[58:20] his nature how he lives how he talks
[58:24] how he behaves himself how he thinks all
[58:26] about him he wanted these ones to be
[58:29] an expression of himself a manifestation
[58:32] of god and that's where the origins of
[58:35] the manifestation
[58:36] of the sons of god come from right
[58:38] straight from the back parts of elohim's
[58:41] mind
[58:42] and so elohim began to plan how
[58:45] he was going to make this come to pass
[58:47] and the first thing he did
[58:49] in this procedure in this planning stage
[58:53] this preparation stage was he had all
[58:56] these great plans on his mind
[58:59] how he was gonna have these sons and he
[59:02] was gonna have that
[59:03] in the world rule the earth on his
[59:05] behalf
[59:06] express him have fellowship with him
[59:09] unfortunately he did
[59:10] he wanted this journey to be on the
[59:11] earth first needed he formed himself
[59:14] change his mask
[59:16] because he wanted to be in his image and
[59:18] his thought on his mouth was
[59:20] let us make man in our image after our
[59:23] likeness
[59:24] but elohim was spirit no certain image a
[59:28] spirit don't have any
[59:29] certain image you can make an image of a
[59:32] spirit he covered all space and time
[59:35] so first thing elohim did was to
[59:39] get himself into a form of which he
[59:42] could now form
[59:43] an image of so elohim
[59:47] formed himself and poured all of these
[59:50] thoughts and desires into a body
[59:53] he formed himself into it but it is a
[59:55] spirit but it's a body that had a
[59:57] form now a spirit body
[1:00:00] elohim covered all space and all time
[1:00:03] but he had this
[1:00:04] the the he formed himself into
[1:00:07] a body and that was the beginning of the
[1:00:10] creation of god
[1:00:11] elohim himself became his own creation
[1:00:14] and
[1:00:14] he formed himself into what he called
[1:00:17] the spirit body
[1:00:19] which was called the logos which is the
[1:00:21] word which is the theophany
[1:00:23] and in this theophany which is elohim
[1:00:26] elohim is spirit
[1:00:27] the logos is the word and elohim and the
[1:00:29] and the logos are one and the same thing
[1:00:31] the spirit is the word and the word is
[1:00:33] the spirit
[1:00:35] elohim coming right down to where he
[1:00:37] could form man
[1:00:39] to live on the face of the earth because
[1:00:40] brother branham said he began to form
[1:00:42] himself towards flesh
[1:00:43] in a theophany
[1:00:47] and when elohim uh uh uh formed himself
[1:00:50] into ethiopia
[1:00:51] a spirit body then he could make
[1:00:54] an image of this theophany you could
[1:00:57] make an image of this theophany body
[1:00:59] which is the word which is the the the
[1:01:03] logos
[1:01:04] and off of this logos world
[1:01:07] he formed an image now and
[1:01:10] that's how it was become the image of
[1:01:13] the world the image of the theophany the
[1:01:15] image of the logos
[1:01:17] and off of that he formed adam
[1:01:21] in his own image after his likeness
[1:01:25] on the face of the earth and there was
[1:01:28] adam
[1:01:28] an image of the world an image of the
[1:01:31] theophany
[1:01:32] an image of elohim it wasn't elohim it
[1:01:35] wasn't the theophany it wasn't the word
[1:01:37] but it was an image of the theophany it
[1:01:40] was an image of the world
[1:01:42] it was a word image elohim prepared
[1:01:47] and formed himself into ethiopia
[1:01:51] and then formed off of that theophany an
[1:01:54] image
[1:01:55] of himself and that became the spirit
[1:01:58] man in genesis 1 26
[1:02:01] but he said there was no man to till the
[1:02:04] soil
[1:02:05] this was a spirit man who are the
[1:02:07] authority
[1:02:08] god sons on the face of the earth he was
[1:02:11] a spirit man
[1:02:12] but the son that god is looking for must
[1:02:15] be
[1:02:15] expressed manifested on the face of the
[1:02:17] earth
[1:02:18] tangible that you can touch you can feel
[1:02:21] because he started to form toward flesh
[1:02:23] in ethiopia so one more step in there to
[1:02:26] do
[1:02:26] you know to put this spirit man in a
[1:02:28] body of flesh and that's what he did in
[1:02:30] genesis 2 7.
[1:02:32] so he had elohim form man in his own
[1:02:35] image and that's where you have genesis
[1:02:38] 1 26
[1:02:40] elohim prepared for this song manifested
[1:02:43] song in genesis 2
[1:02:44] 7 by forming a word image
[1:02:47] the forming of the word image was the
[1:02:49] preparation
[1:02:50] that enemy had to do first before he
[1:02:53] could get the sun
[1:02:54] in flesh manifested on the face of the
[1:02:56] earth
[1:02:57] an adopted son amen a son
[1:03:00] who will display and manifest his
[1:03:03] glories on the face of the earth
[1:03:05] so elohim amen there he was
[1:03:09] i said preparation you got to know what
[1:03:11] you're looking for elohim
[1:03:12] you wanted a son number two what steps
[1:03:15] to take
[1:03:16] elohim took the steps from himself from
[1:03:18] elohim into logos
[1:03:20] and from logos he created an image
[1:03:23] and then lastly he put this word image
[1:03:26] into a flesh body
[1:03:28] and that's where you have a son of god
[1:03:31] manifested in flesh the what image in
[1:03:34] flesh
[1:03:35] the word made flesh adam on the face of
[1:03:39] the earth
[1:03:40] an expression of god on the face of the
[1:03:43] earth
[1:03:43] a manifested son of god on the face of
[1:03:46] the earth
[1:03:47] adam was a manifested son
[1:03:50] what does it mean to be a manifested son
[1:03:53] adam shows us
[1:03:54] and when jesus christ the second adam
[1:03:56] came he showed us in greater detail what
[1:03:58] it means to be a son of god on the face
[1:04:00] of the earth
[1:04:02] brother branham said um adam
[1:04:05] three things adam had three things
[1:04:08] because when he failed he lost these
[1:04:09] three things
[1:04:10] what it means to manifest your son
[1:04:12] number one adam had
[1:04:14] eternal life number two he had
[1:04:16] fellowship with god
[1:04:17] god loves fellowship and eternal life
[1:04:20] must always be manifested because first
[1:04:23] john says
[1:04:24] this eternal life which we have seen
[1:04:26] which was manifested
[1:04:28] eternal life is always manifested it's
[1:04:30] not alive it
[1:04:31] doesn't you have eternal life it's on
[1:04:33] the inside of you but it's gonna be
[1:04:35] manifested
[1:04:36] and that's why the word must always make
[1:04:38] me flesh his
[1:04:39] life must always be expressed in flesh
[1:04:42] on the face of the earth
[1:04:44] amen so
[1:04:47] adam had number one eternal life
[1:04:50] number two fellowship with god and
[1:04:52] number three had an inheritance
[1:04:54] in his eternal life what does that mean
[1:04:57] that inheritance meant adam
[1:04:59] was given the earth by god his father
[1:05:02] for an inheritance i know you know these
[1:05:04] things but just to get a message
[1:05:05] together for you
[1:05:06] he he had this earth as an inheritance
[1:05:09] like a man uh who looks at his son
[1:05:13] who has uh uh uh uh come of foolish
[1:05:16] and responsible and gives him an
[1:05:18] inheritance go and run this for your
[1:05:20] father go and run this group this comedy
[1:05:22] for your father
[1:05:24] and that's what adam was god gave adam
[1:05:26] the earth to run
[1:05:28] and rule for him as his inheritance
[1:05:32] and wants to be adam alone because all
[1:05:34] the sons were to come forth adam was
[1:05:37] to speak other sons from the from
[1:05:40] underneath the ground from where he
[1:05:42] himself came from
[1:05:44] to speak them out but adam before he
[1:05:47] could get to that time
[1:05:50] he fell by sin by listening to his
[1:05:53] wife's
[1:05:54] sin he followed her into sin and so that
[1:05:58] program couldn't go on no more
[1:05:59] and so that's why we couldn't come
[1:06:03] to these are their sons of god like adam
[1:06:06] came
[1:06:07] and the only one who could come a son of
[1:06:09] god
[1:06:12] straight from the hand of god like adam
[1:06:14] did was god himself
[1:06:16] the lord jesus christ
[1:06:19] he came here right straight from the
[1:06:22] spirit of god
[1:06:25] and came into flesh not born by sex
[1:06:29] not born by any human uh interaction at
[1:06:32] all nor human influence
[1:06:34] this was very god himself living in
[1:06:35] human flesh this was the theophany not
[1:06:38] an
[1:06:38] image of the theophany like adam was
[1:06:40] this was the theophany itself
[1:06:42] put in flesh because the bible said in
[1:06:45] the beginning was the word
[1:06:47] the theophany the logos and the logos
[1:06:49] the theophany the flesh
[1:06:51] was the i mean the theophany the word
[1:06:53] was god
[1:06:55] and the being was the word and what was
[1:06:56] with god and the word was god
[1:07:00] and the word the theophany the lord was
[1:07:02] made flesh
[1:07:03] and dwelt among us that couldn't be said
[1:07:06] of adam
[1:07:06] adam was the theophany image
[1:07:10] the word image made flesh an
[1:07:14] image of the word a portion of the word
[1:07:17] midflesh was adam but that was enough to
[1:07:20] make him
[1:07:20] an amateur god on the face of the earth
[1:07:23] so jesus christ came
[1:07:26] amen as very god on the face of the
[1:07:28] earth in human flesh
[1:07:30] and he showed us in a great in greater
[1:07:33] detail what it meant to be a son of god
[1:07:35] on the face of the earth
[1:07:36] adam showed us explain to us what adam
[1:07:40] was in the garden of eden because adam
[1:07:42] had absolute total complete control on
[1:07:45] the face of the earth
[1:07:46] as a placed sun as an adopted sun as a
[1:07:49] manifestation on the face of the earth
[1:07:51] that's how we started on this earth and
[1:07:54] that's how we are leaving this earth
[1:07:56] that's how we are going to come back on
[1:07:57] this to rule and reign
[1:07:59] amen in the millennium in the new
[1:08:02] jerusalem
[1:08:03] sons of god will destroy the universe
[1:08:07] of this earth and
[1:08:11] rule and reign on behalf of god their
[1:08:14] father
[1:08:15] that was the program god had and the
[1:08:18] devil thought he
[1:08:19] truncated it but god's purpose can never
[1:08:21] be defeated
[1:08:22] so adam was a manifesto son adam was a
[1:08:26] very
[1:08:26] replica of what it i mean was it was a
[1:08:29] very
[1:08:29] expression of what it meant to be a
[1:08:31] manifested son
[1:08:33] and adam could speak adam could name
[1:08:35] adam could do whatever i wanted to do
[1:08:37] brother branham taught us
[1:08:38] now listen here on the on on the message
[1:08:42] um it's been about adam he said um
[1:08:46] on the message the fundamental
[1:08:47] foundation of faith for faith brother
[1:08:49] branham said
[1:08:50] now god when he made man in the
[1:08:52] beginning he made him superior to
[1:08:54] anything on earth
[1:08:56] he gave him the jurisdiction of
[1:08:57] everything on earth to control
[1:08:59] everything on earth
[1:09:02] man control the animal life he
[1:09:05] controlled the
[1:09:06] foul life in other words the broads of
[1:09:09] the air
[1:09:09] he controlled the fishes of the sea amen
[1:09:13] he controlled
[1:09:16] the winds he controlled the plant life
[1:09:20] man he control everything man was made
[1:09:23] as a secondary god on earth
[1:09:25] that's a manifested son excuse me
[1:09:30] an amateur god on the earth the ruler
[1:09:33] the cr
[1:09:34] the the the the the the the uh
[1:09:37] uh uh the lord on the earth
[1:09:41] he was made a secondary god on the earth
[1:09:43] he was given the power to control all
[1:09:45] things
[1:09:46] all elements of the earth that was adam
[1:09:49] adam was given these great powers but
[1:09:51] then the power that he was given to make
[1:09:54] himself
[1:09:55] is where he fell and i'll explain that
[1:09:57] to you
[1:09:59] adam's problem was self-life
[1:10:03] and that's been the problem this year
[1:10:06] being a god on the earth that's eternal
[1:10:08] life that's god's own life zoe
[1:10:12] displayed expressed that has nothing
[1:10:15] about a man that's not about you and me
[1:10:17] that's god's life
[1:10:19] in us working its way out that dominion
[1:10:22] that authority that control that's god
[1:10:25] himself
[1:10:26] working his way out that's the life of
[1:10:27] god that's eternal life
[1:10:29] it's in our life is not hallelujah i'm
[1:10:31] saved thank god i'm saved
[1:10:33] yes and so much more eternal life is a
[1:10:37] display of the glory of god eternal life
[1:10:40] is god's own life that's eternal on
[1:10:42] end in life and that life on the face of
[1:10:44] the earth
[1:10:45] subdues multiplies
[1:10:49] replenishes dominates that's the life of
[1:10:52] god
[1:10:53] that's the eternal life that's what adam
[1:10:54] had that's the life adam had and that's
[1:10:56] what he's saying here
[1:10:58] and adam exercised this power
[1:11:01] but then the power that he was given to
[1:11:03] make himself
[1:11:05] that's where he fell and adam could
[1:11:07] speak to the winds
[1:11:08] and the winds will stop he could speak
[1:11:11] to the trees
[1:11:12] and they would obey him he could speak
[1:11:15] to the wildfire
[1:11:16] it would obey him he could speak to the
[1:11:18] waters ever what it was
[1:11:21] everything obeyed adam
[1:11:25] now that is the beginning of man that's
[1:11:27] where we began
[1:11:28] and that's where we are going to end of
[1:11:31] course there's no ending to us but on
[1:11:32] the face of this area we are coming back
[1:11:34] to that spot
[1:11:35] because this eternal life that's in us
[1:11:37] is of god
[1:11:38] and god is the beginning and the end in
[1:11:40] other words the beginning
[1:11:41] and the ending at the same spot the
[1:11:44] first
[1:11:45] and the last in other words the first
[1:11:47] and the last at the same
[1:11:48] spot the alpha and omega in other words
[1:11:51] the alpha and omega are one and the same
[1:11:53] thing
[1:11:55] the first church and the last church are
[1:11:57] one and the same thing
[1:11:59] and if that was the beginning of man
[1:12:01] that is going to be the ending of man
[1:12:03] also amen because that's just the very
[1:12:06] nature of god
[1:12:08] so he said now that is the beginning of
[1:12:09] man that's what
[1:12:11] god given power over everything on the
[1:12:14] earth
[1:12:16] now through the fall he lost that power
[1:12:20] and i just told you the fall is the
[1:12:23] power to make himself that's where he
[1:12:25] fell
[1:12:26] now through the fall he lost that power
[1:12:29] then he becomes
[1:12:30] unconscious of the fact he just forgot
[1:12:33] it he just couldn't make it out anymore
[1:12:37] because he lost eternal life so he lost
[1:12:39] it all because that's eternal life that
[1:12:41] was being expressed through him
[1:12:43] he lost it all and now through the fall
[1:12:45] he lost the power then he becomes
[1:12:47] unconscious of that fact
[1:12:48] after losing his relationship and
[1:12:50] friendship with god
[1:12:51] fellowship with the father then he lost
[1:12:53] that and all of his great channels
[1:12:56] become clogged up and he couldn't get
[1:12:59] through
[1:13:00] now what adam was in god christ has
[1:13:03] redeemed us back to
[1:13:05] what adam was crushing us back to so we
[1:13:08] can go back there
[1:13:10] so we can go back there to make him the
[1:13:13] first and the last
[1:13:14] the beginning and the end the alpha and
[1:13:17] the omega
[1:13:19] the end is but the beginning we
[1:13:22] we got started from where we end up at
[1:13:25] we end up at
[1:13:26] where we got started adam said that as
[1:13:27] an adopted son we are end up as adopted
[1:13:30] sons of god and that's how we leave this
[1:13:31] earth
[1:13:32] that's how we are going to leave this
[1:13:33] earth and we come back god's sons and
[1:13:36] daughters
[1:13:37] in a brand new world amen to take over
[1:13:41] and rule and reign for our eternity
[1:13:44] with our father god on the throne
[1:13:48] amen so
[1:13:51] excuse me so he said now adam
[1:13:54] what adam was in god christ has redeemed
[1:13:56] us back to that
[1:13:58] now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:14:00] bring it back to its origin again
[1:14:03] to where god started from that's what
[1:14:05] we're going back to
[1:14:08] placed sons adopted sons manifested sons
[1:14:12] that's
[1:14:13] where we are going back to that's where
[1:14:15] christ redeemed us back to
[1:14:17] what adam lost the devil authority
[1:14:20] truncated the program no
[1:14:22] god just used the devil as a tool to
[1:14:25] to to give the program a pause so that
[1:14:28] god's attributes or in himself will come
[1:14:31] out of a redeemer
[1:14:33] of a savior of a deliverer if adam never
[1:14:36] fell
[1:14:37] you would never god will never get a
[1:14:39] chance to express
[1:14:40] his attribute as a redeemer as a savior
[1:14:45] so the devil is only a tool in god's
[1:14:47] hands we give the devil too much credit
[1:14:49] sometimes
[1:14:50] the devil can do a thing to you it's
[1:14:53] only a tool in god's hands
[1:14:56] too many of us have too much confidence
[1:14:58] in the devil's powers rather in god's
[1:14:59] powers
[1:15:01] we are so sure the devil can will
[1:15:03] disturb along the way but we don't give
[1:15:05] god the same credibility
[1:15:07] that god has a life in his hands and the
[1:15:09] devil is only a tool in his hands
[1:15:11] he can't move one inch by what god
[1:15:14] allows him to move
[1:15:15] he can go beyond one inch if god don't
[1:15:18] give him the chance to
[1:15:19] and he cannot touch you either amen
[1:15:23] remember job
[1:15:26] go talk with lucifer and say where have
[1:15:28] you been he said i've been just here and
[1:15:29] there to and fro
[1:15:30] see i'll be considering my seven job
[1:15:31] said yeah because you put a hedge around
[1:15:33] him
[1:15:34] said god sure i'll i'll let you touch
[1:15:37] him
[1:15:38] the devil couldn't even touch job until
[1:15:41] god allowed him to
[1:15:42] because god knows job needed a double he
[1:15:45] was going to give job a double portion
[1:15:46] but there was no way he could do it
[1:15:48] until job lost
[1:15:49] all that he had and god can do that so
[1:15:52] he let the devil
[1:15:53] a tool in his hands do that the devil is
[1:15:55] only a tool
[1:15:57] the devil don't have no power but what
[1:15:59] god power god gives him
[1:16:01] and what power we give him to because
[1:16:04] when we
[1:16:04] are so sure the devil is going to do
[1:16:06] something it's faith it's negative faith
[1:16:08] we are
[1:16:08] exhibited many times but thank god for
[1:16:11] the prophet of malachi 4
[1:16:13] who let us understand that we are going
[1:16:15] back to bronson's field sons place sons
[1:16:18] adopted sons
[1:16:20] who are going to speak like adam and
[1:16:22] their words are going to be
[1:16:23] backed so brother branham syria
[1:16:25] continues this quote here
[1:16:27] amen he said what adam lost christ
[1:16:30] has uh redeemed us
[1:16:34] back to and when uh um
[1:16:38] um i'm sorry
[1:16:41] what what adam was in god christ assumes
[1:16:43] us back to to that
[1:16:45] now redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:16:46] bring it back to his origins again
[1:16:49] and adam never had to be sick he never
[1:16:51] had to die
[1:16:52] he never had to worry he never had a
[1:16:54] heart ache
[1:16:55] he never had fear he just climbed up in
[1:16:58] the
[1:16:59] arms of the father and just like a child
[1:17:02] everything was his
[1:17:04] and whatever he asked why he just got it
[1:17:08] everything obeyed him because he was
[1:17:10] god's child
[1:17:11] and the child is heir of all things
[1:17:14] that was adam that was what we were
[1:17:17] supposed to be
[1:17:18] but for the fall but christ has within
[1:17:20] us back and we're going back there
[1:17:22] that's what our adopted sons is all
[1:17:24] about we're going back there
[1:17:27] now when man fell he lost this and now
[1:17:30] what he lost in the fall
[1:17:31] christ come
[1:17:34] uh as a redeemer did you ever stop to
[1:17:37] think
[1:17:38] that christ you didn't did you ever stop
[1:17:40] to think what christ you didn't ask for
[1:17:42] he gave us everlasting life he brought
[1:17:45] us back to the eternal fellowship
[1:17:47] and relationship to god that adam lost
[1:17:50] to be god's sons and daughters again to
[1:17:53] restore back
[1:17:54] all that adam lost in the fall all that
[1:17:57] adam lost in the fall
[1:17:59] the eternal life the fellowship the
[1:18:01] inheritance in life
[1:18:03] amen so that was a manifested son
[1:18:07] and that's how adam lived on the face of
[1:18:09] the earth
[1:18:11] he was literally absolutely god on the
[1:18:13] face of the earth
[1:18:16] until he fell by sin
[1:18:19] and when he fell he lost it all because
[1:18:21] the chin of command
[1:18:23] it was god over adam
[1:18:27] adam over the earth and the control
[1:18:30] as long as god had control over adam
[1:18:32] adam had control over the earth
[1:18:34] when god lost control over adam adam
[1:18:37] lost control over the earth
[1:18:39] it was a chain of command
[1:18:42] and once adam fell by sin the earth
[1:18:46] all nature fell adam became corrupted
[1:18:49] all nature became corrupted
[1:18:50] and thus all nature is groaning longing
[1:18:53] to
[1:18:54] get back to its ought to be conditioned
[1:18:57] and so there you have it the life of a
[1:18:59] manifested son
[1:19:01] of a place son of an adopted son adam
[1:19:03] and even before the fall
[1:19:05] but then he fell and lost all this
[1:19:09] now so many things we could say about
[1:19:10] the fall so many things
[1:19:12] but let me just narrow it down here
[1:19:14] because he said the power he was given
[1:19:15] to make himself that's where he fell
[1:19:18] do you know what caused the fall what
[1:19:21] caused the fall
[1:19:22] was a little shift in focus
[1:19:25] lucifer in the serpent was
[1:19:29] persistent and he succeeded in getting
[1:19:33] eve he knew he couldn't do with adam
[1:19:37] so he went to eve and succeeded in
[1:19:40] getting eve
[1:19:41] to get a little shift in focus from this
[1:19:43] eternal life
[1:19:45] that god gave them that they had in the
[1:19:46] garden of eden that was
[1:19:48] an in absolute authority and rulership
[1:19:51] and control over the earth
[1:19:56] that was god's own life in them that
[1:19:58] eternal life was god's own life
[1:20:00] the life of the father and by a little
[1:20:04] shift in focus from that eternal life
[1:20:07] god eternal life god's own life in them
[1:20:09] god's
[1:20:10] plan for them by a little
[1:20:13] shift in focus from that eternal life to
[1:20:16] self-life adam lost it all
[1:20:19] he focused on self he focus on himself
[1:20:23] that power was supposed to make himself
[1:20:25] to control himself that's where he
[1:20:27] failed
[1:20:28] and that's what caused all of this
[1:20:29] trouble
[1:20:31] how how did this happen the serpent
[1:20:35] succeeded in shifting
[1:20:36] helping eve to shift her focus from
[1:20:40] all that god has done for her and adam
[1:20:43] here was this beautiful world here was
[1:20:46] this beautiful earth
[1:20:48] and adam and eve had total complete
[1:20:51] control
[1:20:52] over this earth
[1:20:57] can you believe it the devil succeeded
[1:21:00] in shifting the
[1:21:01] focus shifting her focus from all of
[1:21:04] that
[1:21:06] to one small tiny thing that
[1:21:10] god did not do for her
[1:21:13] can you relate of course you can
[1:21:16] of course you can
[1:21:20] of course i can too that's how we are
[1:21:23] the form made us like that the power to
[1:21:26] control himself that's where he fell
[1:21:29] the power to control ourselves that's
[1:21:32] where we fail many times
[1:21:34] the power over self-life that caused the
[1:21:38] fall
[1:21:39] that's where we feel many times so the
[1:21:42] serpent succeeded in
[1:21:44] shifting his focus from all that god has
[1:21:46] done for her
[1:21:47] to the one thing he did not do for her
[1:21:51] he told her he questioned her
[1:21:54] contentment
[1:21:55] he told her as god said don't eat of
[1:21:58] this tree
[1:21:59] it's not about all that god said you
[1:22:02] could do
[1:22:02] it was about the one single thing that
[1:22:05] god said to not
[1:22:06] do which was for their own good i won't
[1:22:10] have time to go into all that but
[1:22:11] it was for their own good and the devil
[1:22:15] this happened sweet talked her you see
[1:22:18] that god
[1:22:19] look at what he did to you look at what
[1:22:21] he did against you he kept this from you
[1:22:26] how to make life in the world all of
[1:22:29] this oh yeah but
[1:22:31] how can you be did you give all of this
[1:22:33] yes i know
[1:22:34] but how can you be happy how can you say
[1:22:36] you are content
[1:22:37] you are happy you are satisfied if you
[1:22:40] don't have this i'm talking about
[1:22:42] how can you be happy he questioned her
[1:22:45] contentment
[1:22:46] he questioned her satisfaction he helped
[1:22:48] her to shift her focus from eternal life
[1:22:50] to self-life
[1:22:55] he shifted the focus from everything god
[1:22:57] has done for her
[1:22:59] he belittled it and she did it with him
[1:23:02] to the one single thing single thing
[1:23:06] that god withheld from her
[1:23:08] that became the issue the one thing you
[1:23:10] don't have
[1:23:11] that i don't know how that becomes the
[1:23:12] issue not all that god has done
[1:23:17] and shifted our focus to your self-life
[1:23:20] away from eternal life
[1:23:21] what is self-life that power to control
[1:23:24] himself
[1:23:25] what is self-life self-life
[1:23:28] is what someone has done against you
[1:23:31] look at what god said has god said
[1:23:33] oh yeah don't mind what i said i know
[1:23:35] how to bring forth life
[1:23:37] if he didn't give you that it hasn't
[1:23:39] given you anything yet
[1:23:40] all of this is just to a smoke screen to
[1:23:43] to make you feel you have something
[1:23:45] when you don't really have what you
[1:23:47] think you have and he was lying to her
[1:23:49] because he is the father of lies the
[1:23:51] liar and the father of lies
[1:23:53] but he's succeeding shifting her focus
[1:23:56] to self-life
[1:23:57] and once again that self-life mode
[1:24:00] you are a gonna
[1:24:03] self-life what someone is doing against
[1:24:05] you what someone
[1:24:07] has not done for you and
[1:24:11] what that does that results in a focus
[1:24:14] on self i me
[1:24:17] and myself the three important most
[1:24:20] important people in the world
[1:24:22] become i me and myself
[1:24:25] whereas the most important thing in the
[1:24:27] world you should be
[1:24:28] god and your relationship with god
[1:24:30] should be your eternal life
[1:24:31] your fellowship with god
[1:24:35] and the inheritance in life should be
[1:24:37] her most important focus
[1:24:39] but she did it from that to i me
[1:24:42] and myself god did all this yes but he
[1:24:46] didn't do this for me
[1:24:48] what someone did to me what someone did
[1:24:50] against me what someone did not do
[1:24:52] for me a focus on
[1:24:55] self self life the power to control
[1:24:59] himself
[1:25:00] that's where he fell and that's where
[1:25:02] many of us fell
[1:25:05] on the other hand god's eternal life
[1:25:08] had a different focus it wasn't focused
[1:25:12] on
[1:25:12] god it was focused on adam and eve their
[1:25:14] happiness their joy
[1:25:19] eternal life is focused on what has been
[1:25:21] done for you
[1:25:25] self life is focused on what has not
[1:25:27] been done
[1:25:28] for me eternal life is focused on what
[1:25:31] has been done
[1:25:32] for you what god has done what somebody
[1:25:35] else has done
[1:25:37] the eternal life is focused on gratitude
[1:25:40] looking for the gratitude looking for
[1:25:42] the positives
[1:25:43] in the midst of the same negatives
[1:25:45] looking for the positives
[1:25:47] looking for what i call the offset in
[1:25:50] positives when things look negative
[1:25:52] don't let the devil focus you on that
[1:25:54] when you force you on that that self
[1:25:55] life that was cause that's what caused
[1:25:57] all of this trouble from eden right down
[1:26:00] to today
[1:26:01] a focus on self life
[1:26:05] eternal life is focused on gratitude
[1:26:08] appreciation
[1:26:09] what has been done for you
[1:26:13] what god has done what someone he has
[1:26:16] done
[1:26:16] the the the gratitude in your heart
[1:26:19] appreciation you have that's why david
[1:26:21] was so beloved by god
[1:26:23] they will come in the midst of the the
[1:26:26] the the most difficult
[1:26:27] they will come praising god and thanking
[1:26:30] god and
[1:26:31] and praise that's why because they were
[1:26:32] the man after my own heart
[1:26:35] but too many of us complain about this
[1:26:37] complaining about that community about
[1:26:38] this
[1:26:38] and we just get so focused on that
[1:26:40] self-life and when you get in that mode
[1:26:43] that's just the atmosphere the devil can
[1:26:45] thrive in very very strongly
[1:26:48] because that's what caused the fall
[1:26:55] self-life is so focused on self
[1:27:00] and that's what inspires evil in us
[1:27:04] eve was so focused on what god hasn't
[1:27:06] done because the devil should have
[1:27:08] focused
[1:27:08] till it inspired the evil in her
[1:27:12] i mean inspired he opened up to evil
[1:27:15] and that evil inspired every negative
[1:27:18] thing in her
[1:27:19] immediately she started living on
[1:27:22] physical life to her husband
[1:27:24] and had a child out of her marriage to a
[1:27:28] husband
[1:27:29] a focus on self-life just think
[1:27:33] anything that we do that's wrong i could
[1:27:36] prove to you
[1:27:38] i could stand here and profit for hours
[1:27:40] and show you
[1:27:41] is a focus on self life that's the
[1:27:44] premium of your sin
[1:27:45] of your problem of your attitude bad
[1:27:47] attitude of your challenges that you
[1:27:48] have
[1:27:52] brother brahm said the greatest enemy i
[1:27:55] have is william branham
[1:27:57] she is the greatest enemy i have is
[1:27:59] william branham he said the greatest
[1:28:00] gift
[1:28:01] is to learn how to get william branham
[1:28:03] out of the way
[1:28:05] to get me out of the way and let god's
[1:28:08] life god eternal life come through come
[1:28:10] forth
[1:28:12] and so uh joining back to this garden of
[1:28:15] eden
[1:28:15] has got to take your self-life that's
[1:28:18] going to take yourself
[1:28:19] i was going to take care of it because
[1:28:21] that's what god has in trouble in the
[1:28:22] first instance
[1:28:23] so quickly self-life inspires
[1:28:28] inspired eve to know evil to
[1:28:31] know wrong to know things that are wrong
[1:28:34] and to generate evil and wrong from deep
[1:28:36] within her
[1:28:39] while on the other hand eternal life is
[1:28:42] what inspires knowing
[1:28:44] good whatsoever things that appear
[1:28:47] whatsoever things that are lovely
[1:28:49] whatsoever things are holy
[1:28:50] whatsoever things of a good report think
[1:28:52] on these things
[1:28:56] self-love is focused on what has not
[1:28:58] been done for you
[1:29:00] or what has been done against you
[1:29:03] my husband did this to me my wife didn't
[1:29:05] do this for me
[1:29:06] my daddy didn't do this for me the
[1:29:08] pastor didn't do this for me they didn't
[1:29:10] do this against me
[1:29:11] self-life
[1:29:15] but in love is focused on what has been
[1:29:18] done for me gratitude
[1:29:19] thanksgiving appreciation so why
[1:29:24] self-life i mean while eternal life is
[1:29:26] focused on gratitude
[1:29:27] appreciation things given adoration
[1:29:31] self-life is focused on dissatisfaction
[1:29:34] like the serpent may leave to be
[1:29:36] dissatisfied dissatisfaction
[1:29:39] discontent
[1:29:43] and that dissatisfaction is what
[1:29:46] inspires
[1:29:48] knowing evil because after the fall god
[1:29:51] said the man has become as one of us
[1:29:54] knowing good and evil the man had gotten
[1:29:57] out to a state to where
[1:29:59] knowing good and evil it's not knowing
[1:30:01] like you say i know president trump i
[1:30:02] know
[1:30:03] is the president of america no knowing
[1:30:06] good and evil
[1:30:06] is to know at an intimate level the man
[1:30:10] before the fall
[1:30:11] only knew good because eternal life is
[1:30:14] good the good and great god
[1:30:16] of eternal life was living on the inside
[1:30:18] of him but when
[1:30:20] eve allowed herself to be
[1:30:23] to be to uh uh uh to to to
[1:30:27] her focus to be shifted by lucifer in
[1:30:30] the serpent
[1:30:32] from eternal life to self-life
[1:30:36] see the problem we're in today
[1:30:39] question her contentment and self-life
[1:30:42] is all about your emotions self-life
[1:30:46] the devil knew that if i can get in high
[1:30:50] emotions i control her because friends
[1:30:52] whatever whoever anything that controls
[1:30:55] your emotions
[1:30:56] controls you
[1:31:01] these are the things that keep us from
[1:31:04] this eternal life we have eternal life
[1:31:07] but the entire life must always be
[1:31:09] expressed eternal life
[1:31:10] is not just a talk it's not an
[1:31:12] expression
[1:31:15] they take notice and say you have been
[1:31:17] with jesus
[1:31:18] the power the living god will be in the
[1:31:20] living church the bride
[1:31:22] even before the dynamics comes upon us
[1:31:26] but because they focus on self-life
[1:31:29] self-life
[1:31:30] is so mad up your emotions the serpent
[1:31:33] got into our emotions and she started
[1:31:36] feeling bad
[1:31:38] at what god hasn't done for her feeling
[1:31:41] bad
[1:31:41] at how god has left her feeling bad i
[1:31:44] got into this guy didn't do that look at
[1:31:46] what this person has and i don't have
[1:31:48] that and all that
[1:31:49] i emotionally got all clogged up and
[1:31:52] when our emotions got that way
[1:31:54] she became nasty she became adulterous
[1:31:57] whoever control your emotions controls
[1:32:00] you whatever controls your emotions
[1:32:02] controls you and so once the serpent got
[1:32:05] to that spot con
[1:32:06] had emotions under control he could make
[1:32:09] her do
[1:32:10] anything to make us believe anything
[1:32:14] whether it was true or not true it not
[1:32:18] matter then
[1:32:19] oh hallelujah
[1:32:22] so whatever adam lost christ
[1:32:26] has redeemed us back to and that's the
[1:32:29] second adam
[1:32:30] our lord and savior and redeemer he has
[1:32:32] redeemed us back to
[1:32:33] everything that adam lost he has sort of
[1:32:36] back to the eternal life
[1:32:37] he's only back to the fellowship with
[1:32:39] god we should go back to these
[1:32:40] inheritance in life
[1:32:43] how did he do it
[1:32:47] he rested back to us a power a
[1:32:50] power to prepare for the coming of the
[1:32:54] lord
[1:32:54] to prepare to go back to adopted sons to
[1:32:57] prepare to go back to
[1:32:59] manifestations a power that comes from
[1:33:02] his life
[1:33:04] this eternal life isn't him and when he
[1:33:06] died on calvary's mountain
[1:33:08] he went to the grave and on the third
[1:33:10] day rose again and went to the father
[1:33:12] and came right
[1:33:13] back again with her power to prepare us
[1:33:16] for this
[1:33:17] great event that's ahead of us through
[1:33:19] seven church ages
[1:33:20] to prepare his bride for the
[1:33:22] manifestation of the sons of god to
[1:33:24] prepare his bride for adoption time
[1:33:27] placed sons bronson's field sons who
[1:33:30] will stand there like adam one more time
[1:33:32] and
[1:33:33] speak and their watch will create itself
[1:33:36] just like that they will be set of them
[1:33:39] they could speak like adam could speak
[1:33:41] could name could control the winds
[1:33:43] it could be it will be said of these
[1:33:44] children the sons of god
[1:33:46] when they speak the winds obey when they
[1:33:49] speak
[1:33:50] demonstrable when they speak the animal
[1:33:52] kingdom trembles
[1:33:55] amen right now we pray for the sick
[1:33:58] we are meant to pray for the sick
[1:34:00] because too many people
[1:34:01] misunderstand and they look for signs
[1:34:03] and wonders and all there are signs and
[1:34:05] one has gone underneath the bride
[1:34:07] but because you don't see it you you you
[1:34:10] are more fascinated by the
[1:34:12] what the thinset and all the on the on
[1:34:14] the outside
[1:34:16] cut it off the power of god is in the
[1:34:19] church of the living god the power god
[1:34:21] is in the world
[1:34:22] in the bride in the message the power of
[1:34:25] god is here
[1:34:26] don't you see the power of the living
[1:34:27] god in the church the bride
[1:34:29] the sick are healed the death is the
[1:34:31] death hasn't stopped
[1:34:33] that's going on right now but right now
[1:34:36] we pray for the sick sometimes they get
[1:34:38] healed
[1:34:39] sometimes they don't but when we get
[1:34:42] right
[1:34:42] back to these inheritance in life this
[1:34:44] place sounds these are adopted sons
[1:34:47] these sons of god coming back these
[1:34:49] manifest their sons
[1:34:51] every time the demons will scream for
[1:34:53] their life
[1:34:56] you won't even have to pray you just
[1:34:59] speak the word
[1:35:01] and the demons will tremble you speak
[1:35:02] the word
[1:35:05] and the word will create itself just
[1:35:08] like that
[1:35:09] so jesus the second adam has come and
[1:35:12] died
[1:35:13] and restored us back to this year on
[1:35:16] that journey back
[1:35:17] to what adam lost he has restored back
[1:35:19] the eternal life here he stood back the
[1:35:22] fellowship
[1:35:22] here he stood back the inheritance in
[1:35:24] life and
[1:35:25] what is he doing he was the same one
[1:35:27] that prepared adam
[1:35:29] to get to this manifestation of the sons
[1:35:33] of god
[1:35:33] he was one that prepared adam to become
[1:35:35] the word made flesh
[1:35:37] he prepared adam by pouring the word
[1:35:40] into adam
[1:35:40] by pouring the seven spirits of the
[1:35:43] logos into adam
[1:35:45] to make him the image of god to make him
[1:35:48] a what image
[1:35:49] he prepared adam by forming him into the
[1:35:51] word image
[1:35:53] an image of the word and then put this
[1:35:56] image
[1:35:57] into flesh anointed this image by the
[1:35:59] spirit of god in the flesh
[1:36:01] and adam became the word made flesh and
[1:36:04] when he became the word made flesh
[1:36:05] it was then that the man was actually
[1:36:09] given a name
[1:36:10] adam not before the spirit man was not
[1:36:14] given a name in scriptures
[1:36:15] but was well became the flesh man that's
[1:36:18] why he was given the name adam
[1:36:21] he was only said of a spirit man male
[1:36:23] and female created in them
[1:36:24] boy would he put a name to it but in
[1:36:27] genesis 5 after the
[1:36:29] spirit man the word image that had been
[1:36:32] formed had been placed in flesh
[1:36:34] it was after that time that the flesh
[1:36:36] man was named adam
[1:36:38] the son of god manifested on the face of
[1:36:41] the earth
[1:36:43] hallelujah so
[1:36:47] jesus died and he is the same god
[1:36:50] that prepared adam she was the same god
[1:36:52] that's preparing his bread through seven
[1:36:54] church ages
[1:36:55] because he died and he has paid the
[1:36:57] price for us to go back to
[1:37:00] all that adam lost the fellowship the
[1:37:03] eternal life the inheritance in life
[1:37:08] and jesus says in young 14 that we read
[1:37:12] in my father's house there are many
[1:37:13] mansions if you are not so out i told
[1:37:16] you i go to prepare a place for you
[1:37:20] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:37:22] i will come back
[1:37:24] and receive you unto myself that where i
[1:37:28] am
[1:37:28] there you may be also
[1:37:31] now every scripture has at least two
[1:37:34] different meanings
[1:37:36] and so we can apply this to
[1:37:40] different meanings to this but
[1:37:43] here is the angle i want to come to from
[1:37:46] this
[1:37:46] the the uh in this message here
[1:37:50] jesus said i go to prepare a place for
[1:37:52] you and it's commonly said
[1:37:53] he's gonna prepare the place is the
[1:37:56] theophany bodies that we bypass
[1:37:58] he's gonna be paid for us
[1:38:01] and then you come in the rapture to take
[1:38:03] us home that is true
[1:38:04] that is very true but here's the point
[1:38:08] here
[1:38:09] the theophany bodies that we bypassed
[1:38:12] are not just being prepared right now
[1:38:14] those still funny bodies were always
[1:38:16] there
[1:38:17] so when he said i go to prepare a place
[1:38:19] for you in a sense it's talking to
[1:38:22] anybody but in the real
[1:38:23] actual sense those theophany bodies were
[1:38:25] always there we bypass them not because
[1:38:28] they were not there
[1:38:29] we bypassed our theophany so that we can
[1:38:31] come here and be able to be tempted in
[1:38:33] the flesh
[1:38:34] that's why adam could fall that's why it
[1:38:36] could fall because they bypass their
[1:38:38] fear funny bodies
[1:38:39] that's why she could get detoured into
[1:38:41] self-life and adam could get it into
[1:38:43] self life because they bypassed their
[1:38:45] feel funny bodies
[1:38:47] so the suffering boys were always there
[1:38:49] so when he said i got a prayer place for
[1:38:50] you and that place is the fear for
[1:38:52] anybody
[1:38:53] yes but it's not just in preparation so
[1:38:56] that's not
[1:38:57] exactly what it means it means that and
[1:39:00] so much more
[1:39:02] he said and if i go and prepare a place
[1:39:05] for you
[1:39:06] i will come again
[1:39:10] and receive you unto myself that where
[1:39:14] i am there you may be also what he's
[1:39:17] saying here friends
[1:39:18] as i'm fixing to wind down here what
[1:39:20] he's saying here friends
[1:39:22] is that he's gone to prepare the place
[1:39:25] for us
[1:39:25] that place is there and he will go
[1:39:28] before the father to present himself as
[1:39:30] the first fruits of the resurrection
[1:39:33] and then come back begin on the day of
[1:39:35] pentecost
[1:39:37] to begin to prepare us for that place
[1:39:43] if i go and prepare place i will come
[1:39:45] back
[1:39:46] it will come back in the rapture yes but
[1:39:48] it comes back
[1:39:49] in every single church age through a
[1:39:53] message
[1:39:54] so he comes back with a preparation a
[1:39:56] message to prepare
[1:39:58] his children his sons and daughters in
[1:40:00] every one of those ages
[1:40:01] and they are prepared exactly like adam
[1:40:03] was prepared
[1:40:04] by the seven spirits of god which is the
[1:40:07] one of god
[1:40:08] which is the theophany of god which is
[1:40:10] the lord of god
[1:40:12] and it comes back in every age you know
[1:40:15] the dear pentecost
[1:40:16] with that with without preparation
[1:40:20] with the water god the spirit of god to
[1:40:23] prepare these children and form them
[1:40:25] into the word
[1:40:26] image and our image
[1:40:29] gets anointed into the flesh that where
[1:40:31] he is in that age who he
[1:40:33] is in that age those sons and daughters
[1:40:35] will be there in that age with him
[1:40:38] because the word in the age anointed
[1:40:41] makes you the anointed world make sure
[1:40:43] they are not a messiah
[1:40:44] and when your your word for your age is
[1:40:47] anointed in you by the spirit of god
[1:40:49] you become an anointed messiah for that
[1:40:51] age
[1:40:54] and so the preparation is talking about
[1:40:57] is to come back and bring back that
[1:40:59] preparation in the form of a message
[1:41:02] i will come back and receive you unto
[1:41:05] myself
[1:41:06] that where i am i am i am present tense
[1:41:10] i
[1:41:10] am in every age there you will be also
[1:41:14] and so in every age the same god that
[1:41:16] prepared adam by the forming of the word
[1:41:18] image that same god came back down on
[1:41:21] the day of pentecost
[1:41:22] to begin to prepare his children to go
[1:41:25] back to what adam lost and when he came
[1:41:28] back on the pentacles
[1:41:29] he showed that what he said was exactly
[1:41:32] what he was going to do
[1:41:33] he came back and with the spirit
[1:41:36] under the pentacles and thus performed
[1:41:39] them into the word
[1:41:40] image on the spot and anointed that what
[1:41:42] image in their flesh
[1:41:44] right at the same time and throughout
[1:41:46] that age
[1:41:48] just what adam had genesis 1 26 the
[1:41:51] preparation
[1:41:52] the forming of the word image and then
[1:41:55] what image
[1:41:56] anointed and placed in flesh for the
[1:41:58] placing of sons
[1:41:59] genesis 2 7. on the day of pentecost
[1:42:03] they had it booked at the same time
[1:42:06] the preparation came down in the form of
[1:42:09] the word
[1:42:10] that he had spoken to them and the
[1:42:11] spirit of god anointed that one in their
[1:42:14] souls
[1:42:14] and thou what become the anointed war in
[1:42:16] them then under christ on the inside of
[1:42:18] them
[1:42:19] and then thou would was anointed into
[1:42:22] their flesh
[1:42:23] till they became the word made flesh
[1:42:25] till they spoke
[1:42:26] their watch manifested itself just like
[1:42:30] that
[1:42:31] created itself just like that there were
[1:42:33] gods on the face of there like adam was
[1:42:35] in the garden of eden
[1:42:38] born sons fearless sons adopted songs in
[1:42:41] the
[1:42:42] first church of pentecost
[1:42:45] but like it happened hidden the devil
[1:42:48] came again
[1:42:49] because god has them in seven church
[1:42:51] ages
[1:42:53] if he closes up at that time you and i
[1:42:55] will not be there but god's program
[1:42:57] allowed the devil to come again but to
[1:42:59] show you and i that
[1:43:00] this is it this redeemer has redeemed us
[1:43:04] back and that church of pentecost was
[1:43:07] only the first
[1:43:08] fruits that the church has been restored
[1:43:10] back with him back
[1:43:11] to that again of eden again
[1:43:17] and when that was lost when the devil
[1:43:19] came against it again he said i will
[1:43:21] restore see other lord
[1:43:22] i will get that church right back
[1:43:24] because i have done paid the price
[1:43:26] and so in every age he come right
[1:43:30] back in every age with a message with
[1:43:33] the word
[1:43:34] the to to form them into his image
[1:43:38] he was faithful to send a messenger each
[1:43:40] time with the word
[1:43:43] and that word is seven spirits the just
[1:43:46] shall leave by faith luther said
[1:43:48] thou contained the seven spirits of god
[1:43:51] that was all god revealed to them in
[1:43:52] that age
[1:43:53] and that connected the seven spirits of
[1:43:54] god and the seed of the kingdom in that
[1:43:57] it received that word
[1:43:58] i will come again to you and receive you
[1:44:01] unto myself
[1:44:02] in other words i'll come to you and you
[1:44:04] receive me i'll receive
[1:44:06] you myself and i will come right back on
[1:44:08] you and anoint that word into your flesh
[1:44:11] for your day and age so you'll become
[1:44:13] the anointed messiah
[1:44:14] for that age and luther and his people
[1:44:17] have the mechanics
[1:44:18] the world that formed them into the
[1:44:20] water image
[1:44:21] for their age and age and the mechanics
[1:44:24] and the dynamics
[1:44:25] that launched the mechanics into the
[1:44:27] flesh
[1:44:29] for that day and age
[1:44:33] preparing them preparing them
[1:44:36] for this great time they couldn't go in
[1:44:39] the rapture
[1:44:40] because the time was not yet and that's
[1:44:43] why they are waiting on you and i
[1:44:45] that's why they're without us cannot be
[1:44:48] made perfect
[1:44:49] and that's why all nature is waiting and
[1:44:52] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:44:54] sons of god in this end time here
[1:44:57] to bring up the dead in christ to bring
[1:45:00] everyone back to their ought to be
[1:45:01] conditioned
[1:45:02] and we are here standing for them
[1:45:05] and so it was he prepared them in every
[1:45:07] church age
[1:45:08] until he come to this last age and he
[1:45:12] sent a mighty prophet that great elijah
[1:45:14] prophet with the word of a living god
[1:45:16] in order that a perfect bride might come
[1:45:19] forth
[1:45:19] for the perfection of the son of god
[1:45:22] again
[1:45:23] the perfection the coming of the
[1:45:26] perfection
[1:45:27] of the son of god the son of god coming
[1:45:29] back in
[1:45:30] perfection and with perfection
[1:45:34] with the entire word of believing god
[1:45:38] with the entire holy spirit
[1:45:40] with the entire seven spirits of god all
[1:45:42] the losings tied up
[1:45:44] entire word of god for this edge here
[1:45:48] presenting to you and i and we get that
[1:45:52] word
[1:45:52] and by that what informs us again into
[1:45:55] the word image
[1:45:58] and that's what jesus said he that will
[1:46:01] come after me
[1:46:02] let him take up his cross and deny
[1:46:05] himself
[1:46:06] that self-life and
[1:46:09] take up his cross deny himself and
[1:46:12] follow me
[1:46:13] that's the secret here the word in seven
[1:46:16] church ages
[1:46:18] the one in seven churches from paul
[1:46:19] arenas man in columbus
[1:46:21] all the way down up to this edge here is
[1:46:24] targeted
[1:46:25] a self-life to kill the self-life so
[1:46:30] that eternal life
[1:46:32] will be the thing that will rule and
[1:46:34] reign in you and i every single day of
[1:46:35] our lives
[1:46:36] while we are waiting for the spirit to
[1:46:38] anoint the word in
[1:46:39] us to bring about the manifestation of
[1:46:42] the sons of god
[1:46:44] so what do we find jesus said he that
[1:46:47] will come
[1:46:48] after me who will be like me
[1:46:51] after our likeness like god on the earth
[1:46:54] which spoken with an adopted son likes
[1:46:57] in matthew 17
[1:46:58] whoever will come after him let him take
[1:47:00] up his cross
[1:47:01] daily deny himself daily denying himself
[1:47:05] is denying himself that self
[1:47:08] life that caused the problem that that's
[1:47:10] what's causing your problem
[1:47:12] it's not your husband it's not your wife
[1:47:15] it's not your dad it's not your mom
[1:47:17] it's not the president it's not the
[1:47:18] government self
[1:47:20] life is what's causing the problem
[1:47:23] either will come after me to become like
[1:47:26] me
[1:47:26] after our likeness let us make man in
[1:47:29] our image
[1:47:30] after our likeness is sending the world
[1:47:34] shaping you shaping your spirit
[1:47:37] into his image
[1:47:40] and then if you will really become like
[1:47:42] him to become a god on the earth
[1:47:45] after me a god on the earth like me that
[1:47:48] inheritance in life
[1:47:50] deny yourself the discipline of
[1:47:53] preparation
[1:47:54] deny yourself and follow me
[1:47:58] follow the world and that's what it
[1:48:00] means we come here to take testing on
[1:48:02] the world
[1:48:03] we coming with baptists that theophany
[1:48:05] so they can come here and be tested by
[1:48:07] the world
[1:48:10] and until the time that is our what
[1:48:12] comes the manifestation of the sons of
[1:48:14] god
[1:48:14] adoption time the word of the lord will
[1:48:16] trials god will bring every filthy thing
[1:48:19] to try you and i
[1:48:21] and if you don't understand that self
[1:48:23] life is what was turning the way
[1:48:25] god allows lucifer to come to you and i
[1:48:28] again like him to eve
[1:48:30] to try to focus on self-life
[1:48:33] but we have been too well trained he
[1:48:35] failed but this bride is not going to
[1:48:37] fail
[1:48:39] amen this bride is not going to fail
[1:48:42] she's predestined to not fail
[1:48:46] while where he focus on self-life this
[1:48:49] bright focus is on eternal life and
[1:48:50] brother bob's the only two types of life
[1:48:52] there are eternal life and self life
[1:48:55] self life caused the fall and jesus gave
[1:48:57] us the antidote
[1:48:59] how to get rid of self-life he's
[1:49:01] preparing us by his word message
[1:49:03] through seven church edges and in this
[1:49:06] age here
[1:49:07] all the messengers of the seven churches
[1:49:09] have been wandered into one for us
[1:49:11] into malacca for the message of the
[1:49:12] seven seals and the seven thunders
[1:49:14] and thus shaping us holding us
[1:49:17] shaping our spirit preparing us forming
[1:49:20] us in the
[1:49:21] into the image of the world shaping us
[1:49:24] to becoming like the world
[1:49:26] but in addition to that when we take
[1:49:29] that word
[1:49:32] it kills self-life so god
[1:49:36] we come here to take testing on the
[1:49:37] world testing by the world that's what
[1:49:40] i feel funny for and when we are tested
[1:49:42] on the world
[1:49:43] we take the world unlike if we took
[1:49:46] lucifer's lie
[1:49:47] and focus on self-life we take the world
[1:49:51] and focus on eternal life
[1:49:53] and when you focus on the world and
[1:49:55] refuse
[1:49:57] lucifer's lives reflect self-life that's
[1:49:59] where growth and maturity comes in
[1:50:03] the growth and maturity that comes from
[1:50:05] taking the world
[1:50:07] from taking the world and refusing to
[1:50:09] take anything contrary to the world
[1:50:12] that's how you form yourself into the
[1:50:13] word image
[1:50:16] romans 8 says we have been predestined
[1:50:18] to be conformed to the image of jesus
[1:50:21] christ
[1:50:22] that's how you form yourself into the
[1:50:25] image of jesus christ that's how you
[1:50:28] form yourself
[1:50:29] into the image of the world and when god
[1:50:33] can see that
[1:50:35] because the what you made is spirit the
[1:50:37] word in genesis 1 26 is a spirit man
[1:50:42] and when god can see that there's a
[1:50:45] promise of dynamics
[1:50:47] the spirit of the living god to anoint
[1:50:50] your what
[1:50:50] image in you
[1:50:53] and you become the anointed word image
[1:50:56] and that another word image will be
[1:50:57] another in your flesh
[1:50:59] will be the glory of god over you it
[1:51:01] will chant through your clothes
[1:51:03] all around will be the glory of god
[1:51:06] demons will scream in their presence
[1:51:10] it will be the son of god sons of god
[1:51:13] coming back
[1:51:14] tell me my brother tell me my sister
[1:51:17] when was there a time that the sons of
[1:51:19] god were
[1:51:20] ever to be manifested out of the outside
[1:51:22] of this time
[1:51:24] before the atonement before the
[1:51:27] uh utmost ever brought forth it couldn't
[1:51:29] have happened there couldn't have been
[1:51:30] manifestation but now
[1:51:32] all things have been brought shaping
[1:51:34] shaping down to a headstone
[1:51:36] to a manifestation of the sons of god
[1:51:39] oh hallelujah the holy spirit
[1:51:42] the promise of the dynamics will pour
[1:51:44] upon you
[1:51:46] and you anoint your what image in you
[1:51:49] and
[1:51:49] turn that what image into spirit a
[1:51:52] spirit man one more time and you are
[1:51:53] gonna see sons of god
[1:51:55] with absolute total control and power
[1:51:57] and authority
[1:51:59] like genesis 1 26 and then one more
[1:52:01] thing that what will be anointed in your
[1:52:03] flesh
[1:52:05] and when it's entering the flesh
[1:52:08] you'll be given three more words here ye
[1:52:12] him and you'll get against
[1:52:16] sons of god bless sons
[1:52:19] adopted sons manifested sons speak
[1:52:23] and their words will be backed we'll be
[1:52:25] back again to the garden of eden
[1:52:27] like adam was will demonstrate what
[1:52:30] jesus demonstrated
[1:52:32] and thank god that greed elijah prophet
[1:52:35] of malachi 4
[1:52:36] already demonstrated these things to you
[1:52:38] and i in this end time here in this age
[1:52:43] a man prepared by the spirit of god and
[1:52:47] who overcame self-life overcame himself
[1:52:52] and the word of god had free flow in his
[1:52:54] heart it was formed into the one image
[1:52:57] and the holy spirit anointed the word
[1:52:59] image in him
[1:53:00] and anointed the word made into his
[1:53:01] flesh till he could speak
[1:53:04] and the words will create themselves
[1:53:06] just like that we have seen that that's
[1:53:08] been the
[1:53:08] micah was the first fruit that has been
[1:53:10] waved over us
[1:53:12] for acceptance they signed before
[1:53:14] acceptance before the love that we are
[1:53:15] coming to
[1:53:16] and we are coming to oh hallelujah we
[1:53:20] are coming
[1:53:21] sons of god are coming back oh
[1:53:24] hallelujah
[1:53:25] let me do one two quotes and then i'll
[1:53:27] be ready to close
[1:53:28] brother branham said um on who is this
[1:53:32] mercy zarek
[1:53:34] you come like adam you come like me
[1:53:38] you become from the attribute to the
[1:53:39] flesh to be tempted by sin
[1:53:42] that's why adam could be tempted and
[1:53:44] fall
[1:53:46] but when this life is finished here if
[1:53:48] this other tabernacle be dissolved
[1:53:50] we have one already waiting that's where
[1:53:52] we go that is the word
[1:53:55] then we can look back and see what we've
[1:53:57] done
[1:53:58] the word the theophany we go back to the
[1:54:00] theophany
[1:54:02] but right now the what image of our
[1:54:04] theophany is spirit
[1:54:06] genesis 1 26 1 26 28 spirit
[1:54:09] this what image in us now is no word
[1:54:12] we are forming a sentence of the word
[1:54:14] image but for it to become the word
[1:54:16] image
[1:54:17] fully formed statue of christ in us the
[1:54:20] spirit has got to strike it
[1:54:22] to make us the anointed messiahs for
[1:54:25] this day and age
[1:54:27] and that will be the spirit that will
[1:54:29] live in our theophany bodies
[1:54:31] oh my that's what he's saying here we go
[1:54:34] back to the world
[1:54:36] it is other the banana could be resolved
[1:54:37] we have one already waiting
[1:54:39] that's where we go we go to the world
[1:54:41] the theophany
[1:54:42] then we can look back and see what we've
[1:54:44] done
[1:54:45] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:54:47] become the word
[1:54:48] the theophany amen we have never become
[1:54:51] the world
[1:54:52] we've just become the flesh man not the
[1:54:54] word
[1:54:55] but look clearly makes it clear
[1:54:58] that you will never be the world unless
[1:55:00] you was a thought
[1:55:01] at the beginning that thought with that
[1:55:04] eternal life proceeding on the inside of
[1:55:06] you that can receive the word
[1:55:08] to be found into the word image to be
[1:55:10] prepared for this manifestation of the
[1:55:12] sons of god to be prepared for this
[1:55:13] place sons of god
[1:55:17] but i look clearly makes it clear that
[1:55:19] you will never be the world
[1:55:20] unless it was a thought at the beginning
[1:55:22] see
[1:55:23] you can be the world unless you are a
[1:55:26] thought
[1:55:26] you have to be in the thinking first but
[1:55:29] you see
[1:55:30] in order to stand temptation you have to
[1:55:32] bypass the theophany in the world
[1:55:34] you have to come down here in flesh to
[1:55:37] be tempted by
[1:55:38] sin and adam fell and self-life coming
[1:55:42] there
[1:55:42] self-life that's where all the sin comes
[1:55:45] from
[1:55:46] and then if you will stand all the
[1:55:48] father given me
[1:55:49] will come to me and i'll raise him up
[1:55:51] again at the last days
[1:55:52] see you have to be first and then you
[1:55:55] see he come right down the regular line
[1:55:57] from attribute
[1:55:58] before the foundation of the world his
[1:55:59] name is put on the lamb's book of life
[1:56:02] then from that it become the word the
[1:56:04] theophany that's jesus christ
[1:56:05] that could appear disappear and then
[1:56:07] become the flesh and return back again
[1:56:10] and resurrected that same body in a
[1:56:11] glorified condition
[1:56:13] but you bypass the theophany and become
[1:56:16] flesh man to be tempted by
[1:56:20] sin and then either seminar could be
[1:56:24] resolved we have one already waiting we
[1:56:27] have not yet the bodies
[1:56:29] but look when this body
[1:56:32] receives the spirit of god when you
[1:56:34] become a christian
[1:56:36] this forming of the word image preparing
[1:56:38] you to go back
[1:56:41] to the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:56:42] when you go back to born sons fear sons
[1:56:44] adopted sons who will speak
[1:56:46] and their word is back prepare to go
[1:56:48] back to where adam was
[1:56:49] before he fell by sin
[1:56:53] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:56:55] god the immortal life inside of you
[1:56:57] it throws this body in subjection to god
[1:57:01] hallelujah he the son of god does not
[1:57:02] commit sin
[1:57:05] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:57:07] to them that are in christ jesus
[1:57:09] they walk not after the flesh but after
[1:57:11] the spirit
[1:57:12] he that will come after me let him take
[1:57:15] up his cross deny himself
[1:57:17] deny himself not walk out of the flesh
[1:57:19] but after the spirit
[1:57:20] eternal life versus self-life that's the
[1:57:23] problem
[1:57:24] that's the whole story
[1:57:28] there you are that spirit on the inside
[1:57:31] of the world
[1:57:32] throws the flesh subject you don't have
[1:57:35] to say if i could just quit drinking
[1:57:37] if i quit smoking just get in christ and
[1:57:40] it's all gone see
[1:57:41] because your body is subject to the
[1:57:43] spirit
[1:57:44] self life deny himself
[1:57:48] cut off the flesh lust of the eyes lust
[1:57:52] of the flesh prayer
[1:57:54] life self life that's what is hindering
[1:57:57] us from
[1:57:58] the adoption right now self life
[1:58:03] but it's all according to god's plan
[1:58:05] because god has sons and daughters who
[1:58:07] are predestinated who are actually
[1:58:09] growing up
[1:58:10] into christ in all things forming
[1:58:12] themselves into the word image of jesus
[1:58:14] christ
[1:58:15] oh hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:58:19] what is it and then when you become
[1:58:21] subject to the spirit
[1:58:22] it throws your whole being subject to
[1:58:24] that spirit and the spirit is nothing in
[1:58:26] the world
[1:58:27] but this seed word made manifest or
[1:58:31] quickened
[1:58:32] hallelujah made a life and when the
[1:58:34] bible said don't do this
[1:58:36] the body quickly turns to it there is no
[1:58:37] question right now
[1:58:40] don't do this your flesh obeys it
[1:58:45] and what is it is the earnest of the
[1:58:46] resurrection
[1:58:48] this body will be raised up again
[1:58:50] because it's already studied
[1:58:52] it was one subject to sin and my
[1:58:54] uncorruption but now it's got the
[1:58:56] earnest
[1:58:57] it's turned heavenly now that's the
[1:58:59] enemies that you are going in the
[1:59:00] rapture is there earnest
[1:59:02] oh hallelujah a sick person laying dying
[1:59:06] nothing left but death that's what would
[1:59:08] happen
[1:59:09] i've seen shadows of people don't eat up
[1:59:11] with cancer and tuberculosis and
[1:59:14] see them persons a little while after
[1:59:15] that perfectly normal and strong
[1:59:18] if there's no divine healing then there
[1:59:20] is no resurrection because the vanillin
[1:59:21] is the earnest of the resurrection amen
[1:59:24] the earnest of the
[1:59:25] adoption amen
[1:59:30] you know what ns money is don't you it's
[1:59:33] a down payment
[1:59:34] he was wonderful our transgressions
[1:59:38] um with his stripes we are healed notice
[1:59:40] how wonderful we love him
[1:59:42] now these bodies submit to the spirit
[1:59:44] have not yet entered into the word form
[1:59:47] yet
[1:59:47] but we are still in the flesh form but
[1:59:50] subject to the word
[1:59:51] keeping the flesh subject that's how we
[1:59:53] get to these adoption of sons
[1:59:55] the what image keeping the flesh subject
[1:59:58] the world
[1:59:59] the preparation is the message of the
[2:00:01] day and age
[2:00:02] and the preparation is the message from
[2:00:04] malachi from the seven seas and the
[2:00:06] seven thunders
[2:00:07] and we will form ourselves into the word
[2:00:09] image
[2:00:10] and that keeps the flesh under mix up
[2:00:13] with our hearts and our lives and keeps
[2:00:15] the flesh under
[2:00:16] oh glory amen
[2:00:19] now this body is straight to the spirit
[2:00:21] i'm not entering the world from yet
[2:00:23] but we're still in the flesh from both
[2:00:24] subjects to the world debt in the flesh
[2:00:26] will take us there
[2:00:27] oh glory to god amen amen
[2:00:30] and when this robe of flesh is dropped
[2:00:32] there is uh another body
[2:00:34] that's that's going to pick up this body
[2:00:37] here glory to god amen
[2:00:38] we come here predestinated by god
[2:00:41] to be formed into the word image because
[2:00:44] we have been predestinated
[2:00:46] from the beginning and that's what this
[2:00:48] is about
[2:00:49] preparation being formed into the word
[2:00:52] image
[2:00:53] and then the word image will be anointed
[2:00:55] by the dynamics upon our mechanics to
[2:00:58] turn it into spirit
[2:01:00] and the spirit will you now with our
[2:01:01] flesh and then
[2:01:03] we'll have sons of god back again on the
[2:01:06] face of the earth
[2:01:07] the word living in flesh again the
[2:01:10] spirit of
[2:01:11] god united with the flesh of man making
[2:01:13] you and i
[2:01:14] the anointed messiahs for this day and
[2:01:17] age
[2:01:18] brown suns field songs play songs
[2:01:21] adopted sons manifested sons who will
[2:01:24] speak
[2:01:25] and their words will be backed
[2:01:28] that's the promise that's why we are
[2:01:30] here that's where we're in preparation
[2:01:32] and that's why we're here to form into
[2:01:35] the word image god's not going to do
[2:01:36] that for you
[2:01:37] you are the one to do that form yourself
[2:01:39] take the word
[2:01:40] deny yourself take up your cross and
[2:01:43] follow the after the world
[2:01:45] as you do that what image is being
[2:01:47] formed on the inside of you the image of
[2:01:50] the world you are becoming more like him
[2:01:52] what is the word image
[2:01:53] is the horning of your human spirit
[2:01:56] is the shape in the transforming the the
[2:01:59] transformation of your human spirit
[2:02:01] from emotions from affection memory
[2:02:05] reasoning imagination consciousness
[2:02:06] shaping and holding your human spirit
[2:02:08] from the emotions that cause the fall in
[2:02:10] the first instance
[2:02:11] that the power self-life shaping is your
[2:02:15] human spirit the forming of the word
[2:02:17] image shaping and transforming your
[2:02:19] human spirit
[2:02:20] from self-life to eternal life the
[2:02:23] spirit of god the seven
[2:02:24] spirits of god of the theophany taking
[2:02:27] over your spirit
[2:02:28] and when that happens the word in the
[2:02:31] soul will have no prayer with you human
[2:02:33] spirit
[2:02:33] you will anoint your flesh and you will
[2:02:36] speak

[2:02:40] shine from your soul

[2:02:50] speak thus see other lord
