[1:03:23] Romans chapter 9.
[1:03:24] I want to read from verse 1 to 26.
[1:03:31] I say the truth in Christ I lie not my
[1:03:34] conscience also bearing me witness in
[1:03:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:37] that I have with great heaviness and
[1:03:39] continual sorrow in my heart for I could
[1:03:42] wish that myself were accused from
[1:03:44] Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen
[1:03:47] according to the flesh who are
[1:03:49] Israelites to whom put in the adoption
[1:03:51] and the glory and the covenants and the
[1:03:53] given of the law and the service of God
[1:03:55] and the promises whose are the fathers
[1:03:58] of a whom considering the flesh Christ
[1:04:00] came who is over all God bless forever
[1:04:03] amen not as though the word of God are
[1:04:05] taking non-effect but they are not all
[1:04:07] Israel which are Israel so you see Paul
[1:04:09] speaking with a burden here neither
[1:04:12] because they are the Seed of Abraham are
[1:04:14] they all children but in Isaac shall thy
[1:04:18] seed be scold specific that is which is
[1:04:21] at which are the children of the flesh
[1:04:23] these are not the children of God but
[1:04:25] the children of the promise accounted
[1:04:27] for the seed so you know who you are
[1:04:30] this morning A Child Of Promise the
[1:04:32] children of Promise of accounting for
[1:04:34] the seed for this is the word I promise
[1:04:36] at this time will I come and Sarah shall
[1:04:39] have a son not only this but when
[1:04:41] Rebecca also had conceived by one even
[1:04:43] by Our Father Isaac for the children
[1:04:45] here we go be not yet born need to have
[1:04:48] done any good or evil that the purpose
[1:04:50] of God according to election might stand
[1:04:53] none of works but of him that call it it
[1:04:57] was said unto the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:04:59] younger that is written Jacob have I
[1:05:01] loved Esau have I hate it what shall we
[1:05:03] see them is there unrighteousness with
[1:05:05] God God forbid for he said to Moses
[1:05:09] I'll have compassion and whom I have
[1:05:12] compassion so then it is not him that
[1:05:13] will it or him that run it but it's God
[1:05:16] that shortness he for the scripture said
[1:05:18] of pharaoh even unto the same purpose
[1:05:20] have I raised thee up that I might show
[1:05:22] my power in thee and that my name might
[1:05:26] be declared toward all the Earth
[1:05:27] therefore see on whom he will have mercy
[1:05:30] and whom he will he had net thou will
[1:05:33] say unto me why that he yet find fault
[1:05:36] for who had resisted his will
[1:05:39] man who are thou that are replies
[1:05:42] against God shall the thing formed say
[1:05:45] to him that formed it why hast Thou made
[1:05:47] me thus hat not the power the Potter
[1:05:50] power over the clay all the same lump to
[1:05:53] make one vessel unto honor and another
[1:05:55] under dishonor what if God willing to
[1:05:59] show his right and to make his power
[1:06:01] known endured with much long-suffering
[1:06:03] the vessels of Wrath fitted to
[1:06:06] destruction that he might make known The
[1:06:08] Riches of his glory unto the vessels of
[1:06:10] Mercy which he had a four prepared unto
[1:06:13] Glory even us
[1:06:16] not of the Jews only but also of the
[1:06:18] Gentiles for he said also say I will
[1:06:21] call them my people which were not my
[1:06:23] people and her beloved which was not
[1:06:24] beloved I shall come to pass that in the
[1:06:27] place where it was said unto them you're
[1:06:28] not my people they shall be called a
[1:06:31] children of the Living God Isaiah is
[1:06:34] also cry concern in Israel though the
[1:06:36] number of the children of Israel be as
[1:06:38] the son of the sea a Remnant shall be
[1:06:40] saved for he will finish the work and
[1:06:42] cut it short in righteousness because a
[1:06:44] short work will the Lord make upon the
[1:06:46] Earth
[1:06:46] o praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:06:50] let's borrow his father we thank you for
[1:06:51] your word we pray your blessing upon
[1:06:53] your people father as we approach your
[1:06:55] word now when Jesus we ask it amen you
[1:06:57] may be seated or praise be to Jesus
[1:07:00] again it's a blessing to be here it's
[1:07:03] good to have all of you out here this
[1:07:04] morning amen the presence of God we
[1:07:07] wouldn't always have these privileged
[1:07:08] friends there's a prophecy hanging over
[1:07:10] us that they're going to close us down
[1:07:12] they will have to because the Bible is
[1:07:14] being challenged now as an old-fashioned
[1:07:17] book now you don't have to live by that
[1:07:18] book but your Bible is our constitution
[1:07:21] that's the way we base our faith is upon
[1:07:24] the Bible is our constitution we cannot
[1:07:26] go against the constitution of of of the
[1:07:28] Bible it's not right every country a
[1:07:30] nation have a constitution and they live
[1:07:32] by that Constitution the judges the
[1:07:34] magistrates everybody live by that
[1:07:35] Constitution when we have a constitution
[1:07:37] that's the Bible praise and let every
[1:07:40] man's world be a lie and let God would
[1:07:42] be true so man could say one what they
[1:07:45] want by all this gender abundance
[1:07:46] foolishness God would declare what they
[1:07:48] want what everything is
[1:07:49] all praise the name of the Lord
[1:07:52] so this morning I have a title
[1:07:55] and the title is the question of why
[1:07:59] strange title but
[1:08:01] this is what I have for you this morning
[1:08:02] the question of why
[1:08:05] of a subject
[1:08:07] God's will
[1:08:08] perfect
[1:08:09] or permissive will
[1:08:12] God's will
[1:08:14] the question of why come why am I going
[1:08:16] through this
[1:08:17] why the fall why my situation why my
[1:08:20] husband why my wife why my children this
[1:08:24] question of why
[1:08:25] is a question that is deep inside of man
[1:08:29] children have that question why this why
[1:08:31] why
[1:08:33] because it's a desire to understand the
[1:08:36] causes
[1:08:37] the motivations the attitudes and
[1:08:40] behavior of people
[1:08:42] so why he could come under different
[1:08:44] areas they could come under calls and
[1:08:47] where you ask
[1:08:48] why did something happen
[1:08:51] what what factors led to this situation
[1:08:55] another wanted Commander motivation why
[1:08:58] did someone do something what is the
[1:09:00] motive behind it why why is she acting
[1:09:02] so
[1:09:03] why she did that why he did that there's
[1:09:06] a reason behind that isn't that right
[1:09:08] and sometimes we do that to explore in
[1:09:11] science hunting the question of this why
[1:09:14] and there's why on the purpose why am I
[1:09:17] here
[1:09:18] and that has come addresses the why that
[1:09:21] addresses Who You Are
[1:09:23] why you are here the purpose that you're
[1:09:25] here that's what y also answers and then
[1:09:28] there's another why under justification
[1:09:31] why should I believe this
[1:09:34] why is this the right thing to do
[1:09:36] you're telling me that but why should I
[1:09:38] believe that why should I accept that so
[1:09:41] all these are questions why
[1:09:44] the first time God asked that question
[1:09:47] why
[1:09:49] God accept him was in Genesis chapter
[1:09:51] four we knew the story Adam knew his
[1:09:53] wife conceived the account said I've
[1:09:55] gotten a man from the Lord she'd be
[1:09:57] against his brother Abel
[1:09:59] it was keep up the Sheep King with the
[1:10:00] till of this ground in the process of
[1:10:02] time he came to pass that Cain brought
[1:10:04] the fruit of the ground and offered unto
[1:10:06] the Lord Abel also brought the first
[1:10:08] thing of his flock of the fat and the
[1:10:10] Lord had respect on the Abel and his
[1:10:12] offering but on the cane and his
[1:10:14] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[1:10:17] very rot and his continents fell
[1:10:19] he had a fallen face full incontinence
[1:10:22] then the Lord said unto Cain why at thou
[1:10:26] wrote
[1:10:27] why is thy continence full
[1:10:31] if thou doest well shall thou not be
[1:10:34] accepted and if thou doest not dwell sin
[1:10:37] lied at the door and unto D shall be his
[1:10:39] desire and thou shall rule over him and
[1:10:41] Cain talk with Abel his brother came to
[1:10:44] pass and went in the field Cain rules up
[1:10:46] against Abel his brother and slew him
[1:10:48] and the Lord said the king where is he
[1:10:50] but thy brother he said I know not am I
[1:10:52] My Brother's Keeper he said what has
[1:10:55] thou done The Voice
[1:10:58] of thy brother's blood cries into me
[1:11:01] from the ground
[1:11:03] so the first question of why that God
[1:11:04] asked in the Book of Genesis was why are
[1:11:07] you you're right why are you so angry
[1:11:10] and why are your faces falling
[1:11:13] who prays the name of the Lord just want
[1:11:15] to go through scriptures and we're gonna
[1:11:16] go further right this is from Joshua
[1:11:19] chapter 5. they're in the land now they
[1:11:21] cross over
[1:11:22] you are crossed over Jordan crossing
[1:11:24] over Jordan and whatnot Moses is dead
[1:11:26] take the people over but hear what
[1:11:28] happened chapter five came to pass when
[1:11:30] all the kings of the amorites were on
[1:11:32] the side of Jordan West were all the
[1:11:34] kings of the Canaanites which are by the
[1:11:36] Sea heard of the Lord had dried up the
[1:11:38] Waters of Jordan from before the
[1:11:39] children of Israel until we were
[1:11:41] Passover that their hearts melted
[1:11:43] that is drama
[1:11:45] imagine you in your kingdom and hear God
[1:11:46] dry up the river and the people coming
[1:11:49] over that is man that is the make man
[1:11:51] trembling you know the hearts start to
[1:11:53] melt watch
[1:11:55] and neither was there spirit in them
[1:11:57] anymore because of the children in
[1:11:59] Israel
[1:12:00] at that time the Lord said to Joshua
[1:12:03] make thee sharp knives
[1:12:05] and circumcise again the children of
[1:12:08] Israel the second time and Joshua made
[1:12:11] him sharp knives and circumcised the
[1:12:13] children of Israel at the hill of the
[1:12:15] foreskin and this is the cause why
[1:12:19] Joshua did circumcise so even though
[1:12:22] they were in the land they still had to
[1:12:24] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:25] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:27] still the circumcision that god require
[1:12:30] it doesn't annul the circumcision of the
[1:12:32] Holy Ghost it does not know the
[1:12:34] experience of the Holy Ghost people want
[1:12:36] to talk about Mary said be Eternal to me
[1:12:38] according to Thy word that's not it you
[1:12:39] know that's saying Mary had to go to the
[1:12:40] upper room that's that's wrongly divided
[1:12:43] in the road the word that's misquote in
[1:12:45] the scripture we're talking about a
[1:12:47] Divine experience where fire power white
[1:12:50] light come through you and leave a
[1:12:52] portion of himself inside of you you
[1:12:53] have to want that you have to desire
[1:12:55] that you have to look for that you can
[1:12:58] just sit down in church and believe
[1:12:59] stuff you have to say I want the reality
[1:13:02] back what God has promised
[1:13:11] is walk by faith talk by faith live by
[1:13:14] faith until you come into that Covenant
[1:13:16] of that burning light that you alone
[1:13:18] know that you have met God that you have
[1:13:21] met the pillar of fire nobody can talk
[1:13:22] about you nobody got school a lot of you
[1:13:25] your car belief takes now and yeah I
[1:13:27] believe it again they have no Revelation

[1:13:31] Rock I will build my church and the kids
[1:13:33] are there will never be well against it
[1:13:35] even the Revelation you can stand you
[1:13:38] could fall but you will stand no devil
[1:13:40] could get you to deny God no devil can
[1:13:42] get you to deny his promise
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:46] no husband no wife no children no trial
[1:13:49] nothing present nothing to come gonna
[1:13:52] stop you from standing on what God have
[1:13:54] said
[1:13:55] okay the Lord I shout bye for no white
[1:13:58] husband or husband he said whether I
[1:14:00] maintain my family or not let me
[1:14:02] maintain Christ

[1:14:14] everybody
[1:14:15] continue let them get frightened and run
[1:14:17] them out he said circumcised
[1:14:19] you see God can't break his laws
[1:14:22] his son does rise every morning in the
[1:14:24] east certainly West listen you know what
[1:14:28] I was certainly salt this time you know
[1:14:31] you sound on your own
[1:14:33] the son can't do that
[1:14:35] it is a law
[1:14:36] this is a principle

[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:48] his word is above us all
[1:14:51] and we have to respect that and
[1:14:53] reference that and acknowledge that is
[1:14:56] not what you think
[1:15:01] came to pass why Joshua they circumcised
[1:15:04] why why all the people
[1:15:07] that came out of Egypt that were males
[1:15:09] even all the men of War died in the
[1:15:11] wilderness by the way afterwards they
[1:15:13] came out of Egypt all the people that
[1:15:15] came out was circumcised but all the
[1:15:17] people that were born in the wilderness
[1:15:19] by the way when they came forth of Egypt
[1:15:22] they had not been circumcised for the
[1:15:24] children Israel walked 40 years in the
[1:15:26] wilderness till all the people that were
[1:15:27] Men of War which were came out of Egypt
[1:15:29] were consumed because they obeyed not
[1:15:32] the voice of the Lord
[1:15:34] they will consumed why
[1:15:37] because they obeyed not the voice of the
[1:15:40] Lord unto whom the Lord swear he would
[1:15:43] not show them the land
[1:15:44] which the Lord sway unto their fathers
[1:15:46] and he would give them a land flowing
[1:15:48] with milk and honey but their children
[1:15:50] whom he raised up in their Stead
[1:15:53] Hallelujah you get that
[1:15:56] listen when they were in Egypt God was
[1:15:58] seeing their children you know
[1:16:00] he really wasn't making us you know two
[1:16:03] million people drifting out in the
[1:16:04] message and the Moses the books and
[1:16:06] tapes but after that two million two
[1:16:09] making it
[1:16:12] a few days to cross over
[1:16:14] but because I'm on the leaf because I'm
[1:16:17] backslid Minister because of men without
[1:16:19] the anointing without Revelation without
[1:16:21] inspiration without Vision they fooled
[1:16:24] the people and so we counted this Holy
[1:16:26] Ghost Land and this land of promise is
[1:16:28] the land of the Holy Ghost we have to
[1:16:30] live in it we have to walk in it we have
[1:16:32] to wake up in it okay the Lord some
[1:16:34] Praises it's not a land of just talk

[1:16:43] promise is the land of the Holy Ghost he
[1:16:45] says another land you have to come out
[1:16:47] of your land to go into this land God

[1:31:35] oh praise God Amen
[1:31:37] let's go
[1:31:39] with brown
[1:31:48] I had in my mind as Easter sealed then I
[1:31:51] was wondering why it was so rejected
[1:31:54] and how that people would refuse it why
[1:31:57] was it so condemned and I was thinking
[1:31:59] then it is not always condemned that all
[1:32:01] the people doesn't condemn it but God
[1:32:04] here we go listen carefully
[1:32:05] God has so Made A Way
[1:32:08] that man is placed
[1:32:10] into a position to where he is forced to
[1:32:13] make decisions
[1:32:17] man cannot live on earth without making
[1:32:19] a decision
[1:32:21] God forces the issue to him
[1:32:24] so sometimes God has forced the issue
[1:32:27] that's why certain things happen and you
[1:32:29] don't know why
[1:32:31] but the why is to force the issue
[1:32:34] for you to make a decision
[1:32:37] they come like a sea in the water the
[1:32:39] water clean the water nice the water
[1:32:41] good but you're not drinking
[1:32:43] you could tell people what a good you
[1:32:45] know you could testify how a water truck
[1:32:47] you know come here it's of good water
[1:32:49] but you a tasting the water at all
[1:32:53] so go out to force the issue
[1:32:56] for you to make a decision
[1:32:58] and the recession of fruits with it
[1:33:02] good or bad
[1:33:04] and you will reap the Harvest of your
[1:33:05] decision
[1:33:06] with your fruits
[1:33:08] here we go man cannot live under it
[1:33:12] without making a decision
[1:33:13] God forces the issue to him he must make
[1:33:17] some decision and there's a time when
[1:33:20] you have to make a decision of schooling
[1:33:22] you have to make a decision of who you
[1:33:24] will marry you have to make a decision
[1:33:25] of different things now when the Garden
[1:33:27] of Eden there are two boys
[1:33:29] the decision was forced upon man to make
[1:33:31] a decision
[1:33:32] and we find that the time came
[1:33:36] between King and Abel that the decision
[1:33:38] has to be forced because the time of
[1:33:40] worship had come
[1:33:42] so when they're growing up God are ready
[1:33:43] for them yet when God ready he forced
[1:33:45] the issue he said worship time now
[1:33:47] let me see your Revelation or who you
[1:33:49] think I am
[1:33:50] Cain bought fruit and Abel bought the
[1:33:52] blood with the lamb is that right now
[1:33:55] watch this though each boy I provided a
[1:33:57] way to make a worship to God you notice
[1:33:59] between right and wrong that this is a
[1:34:01] part
[1:34:02] there's just one little breath of
[1:34:04] difference
[1:34:06] that's enough to make a shaking huh
[1:34:10] and the wrong in the last days has been
[1:34:13] prophesied
[1:34:15] to be so close
[1:34:17] to the right that it would deceive the
[1:34:20] very elected if it was possible
[1:34:23] between right and wrong
[1:34:25] Hallelujah no them boys they came to the
[1:34:28] altars made worship I was thinking how
[1:34:30] many altars this morning and churches
[1:34:31] there's beautiful flowers upon the
[1:34:33] altars and so on like that and somewhere
[1:34:35] the way it came because he brought in
[1:34:37] the fruits of the field made his service
[1:34:39] to God it was rejected because he did
[1:34:42] not come the right and precise way that
[1:34:44] God had ordained to come
[1:34:46] but he had made his offering done
[1:34:47] everything religiously just as his
[1:34:49] brother but he was rejected and because
[1:34:52] here we go this is deep because he was
[1:34:56] he was still side then it caused a
[1:34:58] jealousy to rise in him because he was
[1:35:01] greedy
[1:35:05] jealousy because he was greedy
[1:35:08] that greed has always been right and
[1:35:12] wrong
[1:35:13] wrong trying to overthrow the right
[1:35:16] to this power play with ministers and
[1:35:19] pastors and people and influencers I
[1:35:22] have parents like that you know
[1:35:23] competition between husband and wife and
[1:35:26] the mother pushing a move the wife
[1:35:28] pushing her move to have power over the
[1:35:29] children
[1:35:32] all right
[1:35:34] don't worry
[1:35:39] that doesn't mean that is not the truth
[1:35:46] it's okay you know I
[1:35:48] doesn't matter who you react you know
[1:35:51] I have a package here to deliver you
[1:35:52] know
[1:35:54] and believe you me I'm going to deliver
[1:35:56] it
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:00] watch
[1:36:01] it is
[1:36:04] it's greed
[1:36:06] always been right and wrong wrong trying
[1:36:09] to over to the right it started in Eden
[1:36:11] it come down to the ages it come down to
[1:36:14] the end International Affairs it comes
[1:36:16] down into church Affairs it come back
[1:36:18] into home life
[1:36:19] greed here we go trying to rule
[1:36:23] or ruined trying to overpower
[1:36:27] or trying to push out
[1:36:30] all that in the house
[1:36:36] so it's so easy for our wife to become a
[1:36:39] genuine Bullhead
[1:36:40] if there's such a thing
[1:36:42] genuine genuine one you know inside the
[1:36:45] house
[1:36:46] because they don't want to subject
[1:36:47] themselves they don't want to Humble
[1:36:49] themselves and if they can't humble
[1:36:51] yourself to your husband or your myself
[1:36:52] to even the word in the ministry here
[1:36:57] if your attitude is no man can't tell
[1:36:58] you anything and you're on your own and
[1:37:01] what that will God say
[1:37:02] there's a reason God put leadership a
[1:37:05] certain way there's a reason that God
[1:37:07] put orders in a way man bats didn't not
[1:37:10] in position to lead
[1:37:12] woman step forward become man messed up
[1:37:18] being Mel you know is that a man you
[1:37:20] know
[1:37:22] yeah sure again you know
[1:37:25] born m-a-l-e male doesn't mean that's a
[1:37:28] manual
[1:37:29] there are many men like sissies
[1:37:32] they're like females and God separate
[1:37:34] them male and female
[1:37:36] he did he did that
[1:37:42] so God desire for man is to put him into
[1:37:45] leadership
[1:37:46] the lead is home I remember time asking
[1:37:49] a question to somebody Brothers I said
[1:37:51] save your wife working for more money
[1:37:52] than you stand
[1:37:58] because some Churches you know what they
[1:38:00] do
[1:38:00] tell your wife stop working
[1:38:04] because the white money pocket have uh
[1:38:07] maybe messing up the man's mind
[1:38:10] I said brother I saved the wife working
[1:38:12] for more money than you you still have
[1:38:13] to provide leadership
[1:38:16] you still have to go to God
[1:38:18] to be led by the spirit of God because
[1:38:21] you are the person that God wants to
[1:38:22] talk to
[1:38:25] so the money that they issue that's
[1:38:26] secondary
[1:38:27] is the leadership under God because when
[1:38:29] Adam was under God the whole earth was
[1:38:31] under him
[1:38:32] but when you listen to his wife Eve
[1:38:34] she listened to Satan
[1:38:36] okay the Lord I shout in the house then
[1:38:39] Adam got disconnected from his Source
[1:38:41] disconnected from his Powerhouse
[1:38:44] then everything fell because the man
[1:38:46] fell how do you not know why your hoax
[1:38:48] is that it is because you mister is not
[1:38:51] in position
[1:38:53] [Applause]
[1:38:55] and you're asking why
[1:38:57] the question is why
[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:04] then you blame your wife
[1:39:06] then you blame this one then you blame
[1:39:09] that one you do the blame game
[1:39:11] when God tell Adam Adam what's going on
[1:39:13] with you why are you naked why are you
[1:39:15] why are you hiding she said woman you're
[1:39:17] gonna
[1:39:18] he makes sure God know who gave him that
[1:39:22] here's how I find her I pick her up I
[1:39:24] look for her he said the woman you give
[1:39:25] me
[1:39:26] and when God comes to the woman he said
[1:39:28] he said she said he said
[1:39:30] he said well God have no words for
[1:39:33] disciplant he said I'll go let's go to
[1:39:35] my sight
[1:39:46] okay the Lord I shout in the house
[1:39:54] worry
[1:39:56] let me read this again
[1:39:59] greed has always been right and wrong
[1:40:01] wrong trying to overthrow the right he
[1:40:04] started okay so you see now this is
[1:40:06] where the nicolaitan Spirit come in
[1:40:10] among his people and afterwards no men
[1:40:13] started to take a little power smaller
[1:40:15] indeed then the conduction next mate is
[1:40:19] Bishop Ash Bishop 20 Bishop over bishop
[1:40:21] and and right up the Pope
[1:40:23] and they over through the churches so
[1:40:26] therefore God always want the
[1:40:27] sovereignty of the local church
[1:40:29] these greedy guys they may want no
[1:40:31] sovereignty they want control they want
[1:40:34] to have lean over so somebody looking
[1:40:36] you can imagine somebody look on my
[1:40:37] shoulder this morning but you can't go
[1:40:38] there you know
[1:40:40] could you imagine if I had a board
[1:40:43] behind me
[1:40:45] active you know
[1:40:47] a man says something on a woman
[1:40:50] went off that he come over
[1:40:54] I was in my videos
[1:40:56] and you might say something
[1:41:00] man Street nap yes
[1:41:06] it has come down to the ages it come
[1:41:08] down to this enters National Affairs it
[1:41:10] come down Church of years it comes down
[1:41:12] home life greed trying to rule and ruin
[1:41:16] trying to overpower push out
[1:41:18] let's say about that you see what
[1:41:19] happened in America right now everything
[1:41:21] is dictatorial the far right they don't
[1:41:24] care no more they raise their good
[1:41:25] Christians they're ready to kill anybody
[1:41:27] that don't believe in sit like them
[1:41:28] and the Donald of course he sharpened
[1:41:31] the Spear of what this press could look
[1:41:33] like
[1:41:35] Bible prophesy that America that status
[1:41:38] alarm will become
[1:41:40] that America will not be recognizable a
[1:41:43] few years from now you'd want to know
[1:41:45] where is about the home of The Bravery
[1:41:47] free
[1:41:49] they are brave and they're free
[1:41:51] oh my my my do you get what I'm saying
[1:41:54] now
[1:41:54] things are changing you know
[1:41:57] changing
[1:42:02] you know
[1:42:05] you have to change you know are you the
[1:42:08] same person it was two years ago five
[1:42:09] years ago something wrong with you
[1:42:12] every day things are changing
[1:42:17] the question is why are you in that
[1:42:19] condition
[1:42:24] what is hitting you from breaking out
[1:42:28] this is the challenge you inspire we'll
[1:42:30] be talking with preacher we'll be
[1:42:31] teaching
[1:42:32] all right we see things working
[1:42:34] everywhere it always has the same thing
[1:42:36] trying to overrule overall
[1:42:40] down to the Old Testament God in the
[1:42:43] days of the prophets I got several of
[1:42:44] them written here he said he in a garden
[1:42:47] when the true voice of God the true
[1:42:48] worship of God was condemned sent out
[1:42:50] and killed in the Garden of Eden the
[1:42:52] voice of God hushed by greed and
[1:42:54] jealousy has been that way in the church
[1:42:56] ever since the harsh the voice of God
[1:42:59] if you notice as soon as the voice of
[1:43:01] evil was silent God was upset to take
[1:43:04] his place
[1:43:05] which was nothing but a pre-easter
[1:43:07] right he said God kept his voice alive
[1:43:10] with the prophets they spoke the word of
[1:43:12] God they stoned them as soon as they
[1:43:14] would Stone one put him away God would
[1:43:16] raise up another one they stole that one
[1:43:19] and put him away glories up another one
[1:43:20] he always kept his witness alive down to
[1:43:23] the ages he kept his voice alive before
[1:43:25] the people all the way from Eden so we
[1:43:28] supposed to be eunuchs we're not
[1:43:29] supposed to bring our own seed for the
[1:43:31] Branham what the son of man was
[1:43:33] revealing Asana man the son of man was
[1:43:35] revealing the prophet Malachi 4 which is
[1:43:37] Luke 17 today Jesus Christ was revealed
[1:43:39] through a prophet and the son of man is
[1:43:41] the soul of The Good Seed so if I'm
[1:43:43] seizing this message every book you pick
[1:43:45] up our season it once you read it you
[1:43:47] hear it you're listening you're getting
[1:43:48] seeds inside your system the devil can't

[1:43:52] once they're hearing it listening to it
[1:43:54] please be preaching it it sees inside of
[1:43:56] here so I'm not supposed to come and
[1:43:58] preach my seed I supposed to preach this
[1:44:00] word seed
[1:44:01] because the secret is the word is in the
[1:44:03] bride how did the word get into the
[1:44:05] bride you received the seed the son of
[1:44:07] man is the sower of The Good Seed so
[1:44:09] immune the night have the cedar your
[1:44:12] flesh might be corrupt and in problems
[1:44:14] but instead of the seal because the
[1:44:16] season for the heart oh can the Lord has

[1:46:39] from the presence of the Lord he running
[1:46:41] from the anointing he running from
[1:46:42] leadership he runs from Direction and he
[1:46:45] went to Japan found a ship going to
[1:46:46] churches and he said pay the fear there
[1:46:48] of yet money
[1:46:50] went into it go with them from the
[1:46:52] presence of the Lord so he had in the
[1:46:54] presence so and he grew nongso
[1:46:57] but the Lord
[1:47:00] did not man no
[1:47:02] say the Lord
[1:47:04] but the Lord sent out a great will into
[1:47:06] the sea who sent it
[1:47:09] the lord and there was a mighty Tempest
[1:47:11] on the sea so the ship was like to be
[1:47:13] broken
[1:47:14] it was five then the marinas was afraid
[1:47:18] and cried every manner to his God all of
[1:47:20] a sudden everybody get religious
[1:47:22] who are sharply
[1:47:24] who are beads who hit and pan who ring
[1:47:27] and Bell who's smoking canceling and
[1:47:30] incense everybody praying right now
[1:47:33] that is what condition does you know it
[1:47:36] is break people you know it is bring it
[1:47:38] to your knees you know this ship
[1:47:40] wrecking you know it have no foundation
[1:47:42] and National the boat rocking you know
[1:47:44] it's not like a stand up and concrete
[1:47:46] you know you need waters you know
[1:47:48] [Applause]
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:58] of them
[1:48:00] but Jonah was down into the side of the
[1:48:02] ship fast asleep
[1:48:05] sometimes when you're running from God
[1:48:07] you sleep extra
[1:48:09] you almost don't want to wake up
[1:48:11] you almost don't want God to talk to you
[1:48:13] at all just only pray very shortly bless
[1:48:16] me Lord Jesus name amen
[1:48:17] because I long enough God will tell you
[1:48:20] no
[1:48:23] but we speak
[1:48:26] Jonah fast asleep
[1:48:28] master came to him and said what meanest
[1:48:31] though
[1:48:32] a sleeper I'm still reading arise
[1:48:37] call upon thy God he's a Believer he's
[1:48:40] able to be a Christian ship rocking do
[1:48:43] not sleeping
[1:48:47] yeah

[1:48:53] ship rocking believer sleeping
[1:48:59] emotional make emotional
[1:49:02] she said what means the whole sleeper
[1:49:04] arise called upon thy God so if be that
[1:49:07] God will think upon us that we perish
[1:49:09] not and they said everyone to his fellow
[1:49:11] come let us cast lots that we may know
[1:49:13] whose cause this evil is come upon us
[1:49:17] so the car slots and the Lord fell upon
[1:49:19] Jonah
[1:49:21] them fellas rolling dice
[1:49:27] and Jonah get caught in that
[1:49:29] how how could you explain unbelieving
[1:49:32] Men cast lots and find out this Jonah
[1:49:35] foreign
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:49] for whose causes evil is upon us what is
[1:49:52] that occupation
[1:49:54] where's your push he's a believer you
[1:49:55] believe this message you're Christian
[1:49:57] what is your occupation
[1:49:59] from whence comes down what is that
[1:50:02] country and what people are though
[1:50:04] he said unto them I am a Hebrew
[1:50:07] and I fear the lord the god of Heaven
[1:50:09] which had made the Sea and the Dragon
[1:50:14] foreign
[1:50:22] why has doubt done this
[1:50:24] for the man knew he had fled from the
[1:50:27] presence of the Lord
[1:50:28] because he had told them
[1:50:30] then said they unto him what shall we do
[1:50:32] unto thee that the sea may be calm unto
[1:50:35] us
[1:50:36] for the sea rotten was tempestuous he
[1:50:38] said take me up and cast me fought into
[1:50:40] the sea so shall the sea be calm unto
[1:50:43] you for I know for my sake this great
[1:50:45] Tempest is upon you
[1:50:48] this is a level of honesty and sincerity
[1:50:51] that a man come to The Possession and
[1:50:53] point to say you know what is my fault
[1:50:55] because my wife is me
[1:50:57] not my uncle is me
[1:50:59] it's not for children it's me it is my
[1:51:01] fault
[1:51:02] and if you throw me out
[1:51:04] take me out of the way watch this one
[1:51:08] nevertheless
[1:51:10] the man ruled her to bring it to land
[1:51:12] but they could not for the sea wrote and
[1:51:14] was tempestuous against them wherefore
[1:51:16] they Cried unto the Lord and said oh
[1:51:18] Lord let us not perish for this man's
[1:51:20] life lay not Upon Us innocent blood for
[1:51:23] thou Lord has done it as it pleases thee
[1:51:25] they took up Jonah casting forth into
[1:51:27] the sea and the Sea see some region
[1:51:30] fling him over and sometimes there's
[1:51:33] certain things God wants you to fling
[1:51:35] fling it overboard
[1:51:37] get it out of your life
[1:51:39] amen and you will see all calm things
[1:51:41] you shall change things
[1:51:43] you're coming into obedience you're
[1:51:46] coming back to the original commission
[1:51:47] that God called you and give you
[1:51:51] then the men fear the lord accidentally
[1:51:53] and offer the sacrifice of the Lord and
[1:51:54] made those and the Lord had prepared a
[1:51:56] great fish to swallow Jonah Juno was in
[1:51:58] the belly of the fish three days and
[1:52:00] three nights and Jesus said as Juna was
[1:52:01] in the belly
[1:52:02] shall be we know the story Jonah end up
[1:52:06] opening when the fish opening mouth
[1:52:07] Jonah said land straight to never God
[1:52:09] has been prepared
[1:52:10] so Jonah around natashes and permissive
[1:52:13] will
[1:52:15] but the ship of the of this the fish
[1:52:18] took him as God's perfect will
[1:52:20] so God could take permissive and get it
[1:52:22] back into perfect
[1:52:25] it's all part of God's program
[1:52:28] Jonah here
[1:52:30] one of the Minor Prophets we find an
[1:52:32] example of all of us every one of us we
[1:52:34] always running from something
[1:52:35] we run from trouble we want one from
[1:52:38] responsibilities we all prone to do that
[1:52:40] we are prone to run and we have to stand
[1:52:43] and face it out we find ourselves
[1:52:45] running sometimes we find ourselves
[1:52:47] prone to run from work
[1:52:49] we don't want to work
[1:52:51] as much our rubbers and thieves today
[1:52:54] they just don't want to work they find
[1:52:56] you must work and they must rub you
[1:52:59] and they get you know
[1:53:01] a fast pay sometimes we found ourselves
[1:53:03] they want to run from work we don't want
[1:53:05] to work some people just think they can
[1:53:06] make their living without working I
[1:53:08] think as Solomon said watch an ants and
[1:53:11] so on we got so many things we got so
[1:53:14] many things we have to do so much
[1:53:16] responsibility everybody has got to face
[1:53:18] a certain responsibility
[1:53:21] look when you choose your wife to get
[1:53:23] married choose your husband you've got
[1:53:25] to take a responsibility when you when
[1:53:27] you build a home nice pretty home then
[1:53:29] remember the mad woman you have the
[1:53:30] responsibility of Tourism children and
[1:53:32] you've got to think of them pretty slick
[1:53:34] walls and going to have a little dirty
[1:53:36] handprints all over them you got a
[1:53:38] responsibility of educating the children
[1:53:39] you've got responsive clothing and
[1:53:40] freedom some people do great work some
[1:53:42] people do terrible work but it's still a
[1:53:44] responsibility
[1:53:46] you see some people put on a good work
[1:53:47] some people don't have bad work
[1:53:49] but it's a responsibility to train and
[1:53:51] if you don't know you get the ability
[1:53:53] you you learn you you want to absorb
[1:53:56] knowledge and information that you could
[1:53:58] teach that you could support your family
[1:53:59] isn't right many times it is true that
[1:54:03] ministers many times shook a
[1:54:05] responsibility for standing for the
[1:54:06] child of God when they're confronted
[1:54:08] with it they will shoot up
[1:54:09] responsibility oh praise God so Jonah I
[1:54:12] want to challenge you don't shook
[1:54:13] responsibility take up responsibility
[1:54:15] ask God to give a responsibility because
[1:54:18] responsibility makes you responsible
[1:54:20] praise God Holyoke have a business and
[1:54:22] give it to our son that we were done
[1:54:24] three word
[1:54:25] he's not responsible he gonna mess up
[1:54:27] the business you spend 20 years to build
[1:54:30] a business and in one six months your
[1:54:32] son breast break it right back down so
[1:54:34] you want a son like the father thinking
[1:54:36] like the father having a vision of what
[1:54:38] the father has isn't that right oh glory
[1:54:41] to God glory to God there's one more
[1:54:45] are you enjoying the world today
[1:54:47] all right second Kings chapter one verse
[1:54:51] one then more rebel against Israel after
[1:54:53] the death of ihab
[1:54:57] fell down to the lattice in his upper
[1:55:00] chamber that was in Samaria and was sick
[1:55:02] and he sent Messengers and said unto
[1:55:04] them go inquire to balzi verb the god of
[1:55:06] ekron whether I shall recover the
[1:55:08] disease so he sentences
[1:55:11] find out what going on with him but
[1:55:13] first three the angel of the Lord 17
[1:55:15] Elijah the Tish bite arise
[1:55:18] go to meet The Messengers of the king of
[1:55:21] Samaria and see unto him is it not
[1:55:23] because there is not a God in Israel
[1:55:25] that you go to inquire of belzibar the
[1:55:27] god of Akron now therefore Dusty at the
[1:55:30] Lord Thou shalt not come down from that
[1:55:32] bed
[1:55:33] without going up thou shall surely die
[1:55:35] and Elijah Departed
[1:55:43] that bed is that dead man inside of
[1:55:46] there is there a god why you want to go
[1:55:48] to bed
[1:55:50] why you want to go backwards
[1:55:51] when a reality of behold I send you
[1:55:53] Elijah the Prophet come in this hour
[1:55:57] God is not dead
[1:55:58] he may be silent but he's not dead he
[1:56:01] may not respect react but he's not dead
[1:56:04] he may just be silent but not dead
[1:56:06] God is not dead he's still alive
[1:56:09] he kept us all these years
[1:56:12] Oh Glory to God amen amen
[1:56:15] Jeremiah 8 22 is there an Obama in
[1:56:17] Gilead
[1:56:18] is there no physician there why then is
[1:56:21] not the health of my daughter of my
[1:56:23] people recovered
[1:56:24] why oh blessed being of the Lord
[1:56:28] brother Branham if God is going to bring
[1:56:30] the people to judgment it has to have
[1:56:32] something to judge and by it has to have
[1:56:34] a standard if you're going to judge him
[1:56:36] by the Catholic church and the Greek
[1:56:38] church is lost so God's standard is
[1:56:40] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the
[1:56:42] word the word of God he will judge them
[1:56:44] by this Bible for this is the word and
[1:56:47] we wonder why we got so much a confusion
[1:56:49] so much organization so much differences
[1:56:51] separating Brotherhood is because there
[1:56:53] is no bam in Gilead it's because he has
[1:56:55] no physician there I wonder if God would
[1:56:57] ask us that question
[1:56:59] no God was the physician but it was the
[1:57:03] king's stubborn will
[1:57:05] here we go check yourself now
[1:57:08] and that's what the matter in the nation
[1:57:09] today it's people own stubborn will
[1:57:13] nobody else you know
[1:57:14] is you and you
[1:57:16] you fighting about you there's some
[1:57:17] people don't want to be spoken to
[1:57:19] because they want to do their own thing
[1:57:21] they don't want nothing come Cherry
[1:57:23] praise God and Jesus when he prayed our
[1:57:25] father he said praise God thy kingdom
[1:57:27] come thy will be done on earth when
[1:57:31] Jesus he said not my will
[1:57:34] but thy will be done but when you have a
[1:57:37] stomach will that's not defending all
[1:57:38] together
[1:57:41] not because we don't have the same God
[1:57:43] across the Red Sea with his people and
[1:57:44] fed them 40 Years of wilderness it's not
[1:57:46] because we don't have the same God we
[1:57:47] are in the beginning this is the
[1:57:48] people-owned stubborn way they don't
[1:57:50] want to bow down
[1:57:52] they don't want to have anything to do
[1:57:53] with Holiness and purity of living the
[1:57:55] Bible way of living they would rather
[1:57:57] belong to a church put their name on a
[1:57:59] book watch and live like the rest of the
[1:58:01] world and that the bow down to the
[1:58:03] promises and the Commandments of
[1:58:04] almighty God praise God but Stephen read
[1:58:06] it in the exaltation in permission
[1:58:09] if you love me keep my Commandments if
[1:58:12] you love me keep my word
[1:58:14] you're showing your love to God you
[1:58:16] probably say how do we show our love to
[1:58:18] God by conducting ourselves with joy I
[1:58:21] miss the trials he in his wisdom send
[1:58:22] away
[1:58:23] because I missed your child's day is a
[1:58:25] possibility
[1:58:27] so you can't get worthy to be tried
[1:58:29] worthy yeah to be tested
[1:58:33] Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God so
[1:58:36] today you don't have to stay in Hell

[1:59:26] are people get away from the word you
[1:59:28] will never be able to get straightened
[1:59:30] out until we get back on the right path

[2:00:01] dies right on the doctor's doorstep you
[2:00:03] can't blame the doctor
[2:00:04] he had the medicine

[2:00:13] talking and they're talking and they're
[2:00:14] sharing and they're sharing all kind of

[2:00:25] disease that there's nothing to be cured
[2:00:27] can cure to the inside you know God has
[2:00:30] the medicine inside of his kingdom that

[2:12:43] I'm going to read from verse one numbers
[2:12:46] are talking about a prophet yeah
[2:12:50] a prophet now talk to God
[2:12:53] Prophet that could from God but he like
[2:12:55] a little money
[2:12:58] you like little politics
[2:13:01] he could be bought
[2:13:03] he could be bribed
[2:13:06] and valak was the king
[2:13:08] he want Israel cursed
[2:13:10] because what God bless is
[2:13:13] what God blesses
[2:13:15] what God blesses
[2:13:16] and what you bless God bless no man can
[2:13:19] or give the Lord some praises
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:23] Israel knew
[2:13:24] they were blessed and balak knew they
[2:13:28] were blessed so he's trying to erase the
[2:13:31] blessing change the blessing shape The
[2:13:34] Blessing by trying to get a profit to
[2:13:37] curse Israel
[2:13:38] that's what Numbers 22 is about let's
[2:13:39] read
[2:13:40] and the children of Israel said forward
[2:13:42] pitched the plains of Moab on the side
[2:13:44] of Jordan my Jericho and balak or the
[2:13:48] son of the pork saw all Israel had done
[2:13:51] to the amorites this is history now yes

[2:13:59] there were many
[2:14:00] more was distressed because of the
[2:14:03] children of Israel and more absolutely
[2:14:05] now shall this company lick up all that

[2:18:33] night to go you know they're talking
[2:18:34] about the original God said
[2:18:38] and and what the anger was killed
[2:18:41] against him because he went and the
[2:18:43] angels of the Lord stood in the way for
[2:18:44] an adversary against him and he was
[2:18:46] riding upon his ass and his two Silvers
[2:18:48] with him and the ass saw the angel of
[2:18:50] the Lord standing in the way and he saw
[2:18:52] Jordan in his hand and he asked him
[2:18:54] aside out of the way and went into the
[2:18:56] field and Balaam smote the ass to turn
[2:18:58] her into the way but the angel of the
[2:19:01] Lord stood in the part of The Vineyards
[2:19:02] a wall being on this side a wall on that
[2:19:04] side and when they asked all the angel
[2:19:06] of the Lord she trusts herself against
[2:19:07] the wall and crushed billion's foot
[2:19:09] against the wall and he smoked again
[2:19:12] and the anger of the Lord went further
[2:19:13] and stood in the narrow place but there
[2:19:15] was no way to turn left or right and
[2:19:18] when they asked all the angel of the
[2:19:19] Lord she fell along on the Balaam and
[2:19:21] belam anger was kindled and he smoothed
[2:19:23] the ass with the staff and the Lord
[2:19:26] opened the mouth of the ass and she said
[2:19:28] unto the alarm what have I done unto
[2:19:30] thee
[2:19:32] they were smitten me three times
[2:19:35] and Bill I'm said unto the ass because
[2:19:37] there was mock me I would dare with a
[2:19:39] sword in my hand nor I would kill thee
[2:19:41] and the answer am I not dynast upon
[2:19:44] which dog has ridden ever since I was
[2:19:46] unto dying this day was I ever wanted to
[2:19:48] do unto thee and he said knee then the
[2:19:51] Lord opened the eyes of Balaam and he
[2:19:54] saw the angel of the Lord standing in
[2:19:55] the way his sword drawn in his hand he
[2:19:58] bowed on his head he fell flat on his
[2:20:00] face and the angel of the Lord said unto
[2:20:02] him where four dollars spitting on us
[2:20:04] these three times behold I went out to
[2:20:06] withstandly because thy way is perverse
[2:20:09] before me
[2:20:11] so that way of going contrary to God's
[2:20:14] original plan God see it as previous
[2:20:17] and the I saw me in tune for me
[2:20:22] these three times unless she attempt for
[2:20:24] me surely now I had slain thee and save
[2:20:26] our life and Bill I'm said unto the
[2:20:28] answer of the Lord I have sinned for I
[2:20:31] knew not that those students in the way
[2:20:32] against me no dear for evidence please
[2:20:34] Thee I will get me back again
[2:20:36] and the age of the Lord go with the men
[2:20:38] but only the word I shall speak unto
[2:20:41] thee Thou shalt speak so balam went to
[2:20:43] the prince of balak when Barack heard
[2:20:46] that Dylan was come he went out to meet
[2:20:47] him under the city of Moab which is by
[2:20:49] the board of Amman which is the utmost
[2:20:50] quote and Balaam said on the battle and
[2:20:52] the belam did I not even see sent on the
[2:20:55] diet according
[2:20:56] to me I am not able to prove more detail
[2:20:59] honor

[2:21:04] anything the word that God put in my
[2:21:07] mouth that shall I speak
[2:21:10] and they came to kiss not and balak
[2:21:13] offered oxen and sheep sent the Dilemma
[2:21:15] to the princes with him killed the past
[2:21:18] on the moon and back to Balaam brought
[2:21:20] him up to the high peace of bial that he
[2:21:22] might see the utmost part of the people
[2:21:23] the back part of the people chapter 23.

[2:21:36] know the word he said Bill me seven

[2:29:23] loved you we worship in equity but he
[2:29:25] love you when he wasn't sin he still
[2:29:27] love you he still love you this morning
[2:29:29] oh great praise him praise him praise
[2:29:31] him he said you have not chosen me but I
[2:29:34] have chosen you he chose you
[2:29:36] [Applause]
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:44] Jacob here we go his whole soul wants to
[2:29:48] get the boat right and that is what God
[2:29:50] recognizing him to be spiritual his
[2:29:52] whole soul was against the Holy Ghost Oh
[2:29:54] Glory they got every service every time
[2:29:55] every prayer meeting he saw a
[2:29:57] possibility maybe today is my day maybe
[2:29:59] today is my time oh glory to God he
[2:30:01] wasn't talking negative he was talking
[2:30:03] positive and he had the right kind of
[2:30:05] monitor back him up right kind of
[2:30:07] spiritual influencer to back him up he'd
[2:30:08] have mothers back on the chair in the
[2:30:10] wrong way wrong direction oh give the
[2:30:12] Lord some praises
[2:30:14] there we go this is deep notice it
[2:30:17] always caused them natural to hit the
[2:30:19] spiritual
[2:30:21] not the other way around
[2:30:24] this is the one-way Street right now
[2:30:27] one way
[2:30:29] it caused the natural to hit the
[2:30:31] spiritual it caused King to hate Abel it
[2:30:33] caused Korra to hit Moses it caused
[2:30:35] Judas to hate Jesus on and on it goes it
[2:30:38] caused the natural to heal the spiritual
[2:30:39] just as king and the beginning is
[2:30:43] so they say why this person treats me
[2:30:45] like that
[2:30:46] kind of
[2:30:47] natural
[2:30:49] but they can't stand you but they're not
[2:30:52] with you
[2:30:58] watch this
[2:30:59] even they try to destroy the influence
[2:31:04] to disconnect people from the ministry
[2:31:07] when I passed the Blaster next minute
[2:31:10] killing them to other people
[2:31:12] ministers on a big stab and a knife
[2:31:15] behind it back so God bless you brother
[2:31:19] yeah you caught jealousy
[2:31:22] you try to just throw the influence to
[2:31:24] try to destroy everything because it's
[2:31:26] nothing but jealousy
[2:31:28] it started in King but it was jealousy
[2:31:31] it's still the same today when the
[2:31:33] natural canal and spiritual meet
[2:31:34] together it's proved with Satan not
[2:31:36] aware because jealousy comes from Satan
[2:31:42] no jealousy come from Satan
[2:31:45] I will be like the most high I want to
[2:31:48] be like God I want to be on top of
[2:31:49] everybody and God put the boots on him
[2:31:51] and kick him out
[2:31:58] because of jealousy comes from Satan and
[2:32:00] then because of impersonation of the
[2:32:01] truth somebody tried to impersonate
[2:32:03] something that isn't there isn't
[2:32:05] ordained to do that see God watch does
[2:32:08] not change his mind about his original
[2:32:11] word
[2:32:12] who he calls who he ordains no one else
[2:32:15] can take that place no one else could
[2:32:17] take Moses place no matter how much
[2:32:19] chorus raised up how much data it was
[2:32:21] Moses God has called regardless and if
[2:32:24] people here we go are you ready
[2:32:26] and what you're cycling now buckle on
[2:32:28] your belt I am moving yet and I groove
[2:32:31] here and I'll stop it until I finish
[2:32:33] this book
[2:32:35] are you ready to close yet you know
[2:32:37] so don't even think about it I ready to
[2:32:40] rumble okay the Lord some praises
[2:32:43] Hallelujah here we go if the people
[2:32:47] won't walk in this perfect will
[2:32:50] he does have a permissive will he will
[2:32:54] let you walk
[2:32:57] just like in the beginning it was not
[2:32:59] God's perfect will for children to be
[2:33:00] born on the Earth to sex
[2:33:02] no sir God created Man Out of the Dust
[2:33:05] of the earth breathe a breath of life
[2:33:06] into him he became a living Soul he took
[2:33:10] that man a help mate made a wife to him
[2:33:12] that was God's first on original will
[2:33:14] When sin come in and did things it did
[2:33:18] he permitted man to marry a wife legally
[2:33:20] and I've turned by her multiply
[2:33:22] replenish the Earth that's how you're
[2:33:24] going to do it but you see it was never
[2:33:26] his perfect will therefore all these
[2:33:28] things at the beginning has to have an
[2:33:30] end all sin has to come to Annihilation
[2:33:32] all sin has to be done away with
[2:33:34] therefore in the great Millennium when
[2:33:36] the Resurrection comes we will not have
[2:33:38] to be reborn Again by our fathers and
[2:33:40] mothers but God like he did in the
[2:33:42] beginning will call man from the dust of
[2:33:44] the earth his help mate with him that's
[2:33:47] the way he did it at the beginning okay
[2:33:49] the Lord some praises
[2:33:51] so therefore God does never change his
[2:33:53] mind about anything but he will permit
[2:33:56] you to go on now this is a long way
[2:33:58] around to get where I want to go and
[2:33:59] saying here God
[2:34:01] will permit you to do something
[2:34:03] this is this is deep and even bless you
[2:34:06] in doing it
[2:34:08] but still it isn't his perfect will
[2:34:11] God permitted Israel to take a law
[2:34:14] Exodus 19 chapter when Grace had already
[2:34:16] given them a prophet pillar fire
[2:34:18] sacrificial lamb delivering power they
[2:34:20] cried off our law
[2:34:22] it wasn't God's will but it was injected
[2:34:25] because man wanted it and he was cursed
[2:34:28] by the very law that he wanted
[2:34:30] it is best to have God's will that's
[2:34:32] what he taught us that will be done thy
[2:34:34] kingdom come thy will be done we must
[2:34:36] submit ourselves to his will and his
[2:34:39] word don't question it believe it don't
[2:34:41] try to find a way around it just take it
[2:34:43] the way it is
[2:34:44] so many wants to go wrong get along some
[2:34:46] way when you go you find yourself going
[2:34:48] on you find God blessing you but you're
[2:34:51] working in his permissive will and not
[2:34:53] his perfect will he permits us as I said
[2:34:55] he will not let it be his perfect will
[2:34:57] but he will make it work the honor and
[2:34:59] blessed perfect will childbearing by sex
[2:35:01] is one of that all right
[2:35:04] do you get that now
[2:35:05] okay all right
[2:35:07] so Moab
[2:35:09] okay
[2:35:10] now difference between Mormon Israel
[2:35:13] what was the difference in them
[2:35:14] fundamentally both were right Moab did
[2:35:17] not have the Vindication of God with
[2:35:18] them they were only a nation a group of
[2:35:19] celebrities Israel had a prophet with
[2:35:21] them they are expecting rock with them
[2:35:23] they had a pillar of fire they had a
[2:35:25] brass Supreme for healing that the
[2:35:26] blessings of God moving right among them
[2:35:27] and they will call Ocean of God but more
[2:35:30] I've seen Israel with something that
[2:35:32] didn't have they seen a mighty power
[2:35:34] among Israel it was a prophet and that
[2:35:36] Prophet was Moses they know that when
[2:35:38] the battle went wrong they raised up his
[2:35:40] hands held it up there and the battle
[2:35:41] changed so it didn't have such as that
[2:35:43] and they tried to match it with politics
[2:35:45] with a political pull they sent over
[2:35:48] another country a higher profit to come
[2:35:50] over so they can have a prophet you are
[2:35:52] Prophet Ayah Prophet too
[2:35:54] right and they will have power among
[2:35:56] them like Israel had among them do you
[2:35:58] see the kind of comparison can you see
[2:35:59] the Canada church today notice they were
[2:36:01] both going to have Prophets The only
[2:36:03] difference was Moses the prophet of God
[2:36:05] his King was God that's where you get
[2:36:08] his orders Balaam he had a king his King
[2:36:11] was balak
[2:36:16] said come down and curse me these people
[2:36:19] right come down now we want to notice
[2:36:22] that this man was a prophet ordained of
[2:36:24] God but he sold his birthrights for
[2:36:26] political reasons
[2:36:28] you can't say is not a prophet of God
[2:36:30] in the prophet he can't say you know
[2:36:32] seek the Lord the heaven God he was
[2:36:35] but he's one of them that could be
[2:36:36] bought
[2:36:40] notice the difference each had heard
[2:36:43] Moses was God balak was but Balaam was
[2:36:46] balak notice God said to the alarm after
[2:36:48] he heard the true cut decision don't go
[2:36:50] yes then God says well go no you can do
[2:36:54] the same thing here we go if you don't
[2:36:57] want to walk in the truth listen to this
[2:36:59] young people listen to this carefully
[2:37:02] if you don't want to walk in the truth
[2:37:04] you can go and have a great ministry
[2:37:07] certain you can but you are taking his
[2:37:09] permissive will you be a walking over
[2:37:11] his word you you possibly suddenly
[2:37:13] in permissive will so you cannot just
[2:37:16] say God is blessing me are you in his
[2:37:19] permissible or are you in his perfect
[2:37:22] will God's will which one
[2:37:26] like he did bailam he was a success but
[2:37:29] he couldn't curse the people he couldn't
[2:37:30] do it cause every time he starts with a
[2:37:32] curse he blessed see he couldn't do it
[2:37:34] and when he come being prosperous and
[2:37:36] achievement he told his people
[2:37:37] afterwards you know what he tries to get
[2:37:38] him to come his adultery and that's what
[2:37:40] bring the Judgment of God upon them oh
[2:37:43] hallelujah praise God Amen but Abraham
[2:37:46] said this you know
[2:37:47] you talk about here we found out Bill
[2:37:49] and went down there he began to teach
[2:37:50] the people an error he ran away in the
[2:37:53] way of Balaam or what he did he taught
[2:37:55] balak and the children of Israel to
[2:37:56] commit adultery and a plague struck the
[2:37:58] nation of Israel and the people
[2:37:59] thousands of them died in one day and
[2:38:01] while they were there before the altar
[2:38:02] of God praying here come an Israelite
[2:38:04] man with a mediate woman an
[2:38:06] international woman and went into the
[2:38:07] tent and the priest's son walked over
[2:38:10] took a javelin and killed them both and
[2:38:12] that state goes right
[2:38:14] could imagine the sin of adultery and
[2:38:16] that whole thing but judgment to the
[2:38:18] world camp and when this priest son saw
[2:38:19] that being they're gonna attend they
[2:38:20] killed both of them and the Rats stopped
[2:38:24] Hallelujah note something had to be done
[2:38:27] to stop
[2:38:29] hallelujah praise God I'll get two women
[2:38:32] on that that's all right
[2:38:34] what happened Balaam he's succeeded in
[2:38:37] within Israel what did he do he weakened
[2:38:39] the camp God let him go and weaken their
[2:38:41] Camp it polluted the whole Camp when
[2:38:43] some Doctrine starts that's not the
[2:38:45] Bible like I am Holy Spirit Doctrine all
[2:38:47] his false teaching that's foolishness
[2:38:49] that's not God at all God has speak that
[2:38:51] that is not in the Bible
[2:38:53] but the penalty they push it people
[2:38:55] receive it in their spirits and they run
[2:38:57] off with that Plumb of the word of God
[2:38:59] Plumb off the beaten path watch when
[2:39:01] watch when some Doctrine starts that's
[2:39:03] not the Bible truth it pollutes the
[2:39:04] whole Camp somebody raised up with a
[2:39:06] different idea like Korra say well this
[2:39:07] that the other I got a different idea it
[2:39:09] pollutes the whole Camp that's what done
[2:39:11] the whole church camp today
[2:39:19] remember here we go
[2:39:22] don't tell me right now they had to eat
[2:39:25] Angels food they had the word of God
[2:39:27] every night made manifest they eat the
[2:39:29] food they drink from the rock they did
[2:39:31] see Miracles they watched Moses seen his
[2:39:33] prophecies and then finally they
[2:39:35] listened to a false teacher coming among
[2:39:37] them and teach wrong he weakened the
[2:39:40] camp and prospered by it he might build
[2:39:42] a building on a building he might have
[2:39:44] great denomination he might have added
[2:39:46] thousand times thousand gone Green books
[2:39:47] Mighty works that's all right but as
[2:39:50] long is not with the word of God you
[2:39:52] better stay away from it God don't
[2:39:54] change his mind stay right with the word
[2:39:56] cause that is what going to come out of
[2:39:59] the end the word praise God when you say
[2:40:01] brother Branham I do so and so it don't
[2:40:04] bother me
[2:40:06] my mother let me do it don't bother me
[2:40:08] I had no pressure at home so what the
[2:40:10] problem is the home slack there is no
[2:40:13] real Anchor Point in the house there is
[2:40:16] real no straight out how your children
[2:40:18] will respond to straighten out in the
[2:40:19] church
[2:40:22] when you as parents are straight them in
[2:40:24] the house
[2:40:26] to talk to me like that my father
[2:40:29] rebuked me like that my father don't
[2:40:30] correct me like that my mother don't say
[2:40:32] nothing at all let me put I'll paint my
[2:40:34] toes paint my nose paint my fingernails
[2:40:36] everywhere I want to paint
[2:40:38] when they come to church they want to
[2:40:39] tell me about paint
[2:40:44] you say brother man I might do something
[2:40:45] so don't bother me God blessing me every
[2:40:47] day I sing in the spirit that's in the
[2:40:49] spirit he permit it go ahead that's
[2:40:50] right but what are you doing going to do
[2:40:52] I wear shorts I do this it don't bother
[2:40:55] me I know my faith is in Christ not what
[2:40:56] I wear
[2:40:58] it's not familiar
[2:41:00] but the Bible said there was something
[2:41:01] to it you make a stumbling block like
[2:41:04] they landed
[2:41:05] but God will prosper you why He blesses
[2:41:07] me I don't doubt that
[2:41:11] is permissive will not his perfect will
[2:41:13] God doesn't change his mind because He
[2:41:15] blesses you he bless Israel right there
[2:41:17] for 40 years what did they do married
[2:41:18] wise raise families kiss the children
[2:41:20] pay their ties live right out there and
[2:41:22] God bless him in the wilderness
[2:41:23] sentiment manner on and on and every one
[2:41:25] of them perish
[2:41:27] cause they've never kept his original
[2:41:29] permissive his original word
[2:41:31] the top of the permissive way go ahead
[2:41:33] but you remember when the left cameish
[2:41:36] they never journeyed any further they
[2:41:38] just went around in the wilderness where
[2:41:40] they could have been out in two days
[2:41:41] after that there could have been a
[2:41:42] promised land they Journey 40 years
[2:41:44] every one of them died but Joshua Caleb
[2:41:47] the ones that stayed with the original
[2:41:48] word God help us God don't change his
[2:41:51] will he don't change his mind but he
[2:41:53] will bless you oh glory to God
[2:41:56] hallelujah
[2:41:57] glory to God amen amen amen let's head
[2:42:01] to home stretch watch look God said go
[2:42:03] on he will give him permission to go on
[2:42:05] there's a permissible of God and not the
[2:42:07] original will of God you see what
[2:42:08] trouble he got into and any man here we
[2:42:11] go
[2:42:11] that builds anything any organization
[2:42:14] anything outside upon the word of God is
[2:42:16] shaking sons and will fall
[2:42:19] every group
[2:42:21] every Ministry that got built upon the
[2:42:23] world will fall I look out is standing
[2:42:26] strong now it will fall because the only
[2:42:28] word are going to understand
[2:42:30] it has to peel upon the rock
[2:42:33] it will die assures anything because the
[2:42:36] word of God is growing body the word of
[2:42:38] God is the growing body of the Bride you
[2:42:40] can't have all foot all arm all time
[2:42:42] these things come in their season
[2:42:45] so adoption coming in a season anybody
[2:42:48] come to claim the adapter now just as a
[2:42:49] clung
[2:42:51] it had after the season of adoption
[2:42:53] praise God I can't be no serious thing a
[2:42:55] man claiming to power he castles Some
[2:42:57] Devil he adopted is that right the
[2:42:59] problem says somebody claims something
[2:43:00] try it
[2:43:04] feel free to claim anything
[2:43:07] if you want to claim to be a prophet
[2:43:08] fine you'll have a child too
[2:43:10] Hallelujah try that see this is right if
[2:43:13] it is right work with it and say thank
[2:43:15] you Lord send us some more until
[2:43:17] everybody find their place are you with
[2:43:20] me we supposed to try we are supposed to
[2:43:22] say because they come from America or
[2:43:23] before you come from Jacksonville
[2:43:24] because you come from there is right no
[2:43:26] it has to be Underwood
[2:43:28] Oh Glory to God isn't that right
[2:43:31] hallelujah praise God these things come
[2:43:34] in a season oh let's finish off here now
[2:43:37] so this is the cap of it here but
[2:43:39] abandon in the exposition he said to
[2:43:41] Jesus he was talking about watch
[2:43:44] Israel came to the borders of Moab
[2:43:46] missions get ready
[2:43:48] we are brothers let us pass to your land
[2:43:50] if all people are no animals eat or
[2:43:52] drink anything we will pay for it Israel
[2:43:54] saying that King palak got very excited
[2:43:56] that head of the nicolaitan punch
[2:43:58] nicolitan Bunch was about was not about
[2:44:00] to let the church come true with signs
[2:44:02] and wonders and diverse manifestation of
[2:44:03] the Holy Ghost with their faces shining
[2:44:05] with the glory of God look look how
[2:44:06] powerful but I'm reflect this year
[2:44:09] foreign bunch
[2:44:14] come true with the signs wonders divers
[2:44:17] manifestations the Holy Ghost with their
[2:44:18] face shining with the glory of God it
[2:44:20] was too risky he might lose some of his
[2:44:22] crowd so balak refused an evil Pastor in
[2:44:25] fact so great was his fear of them he
[2:44:27] went to an island Prophet called balam
[2:44:29] and asked him to mediate between him and
[2:44:31] God and petition the almighty took us
[2:44:33] Israel and rather than important
[2:44:35] but Balaam being eager to take part in a
[2:44:37] political fear become a great man was
[2:44:39] only too glad to do so but seeing he had
[2:44:41] to approach and receive audience from
[2:44:43] God to get the people kissed he could
[2:44:45] not do it by himself he went to ask God
[2:44:47] if they could have permission to go now
[2:44:49] isn't that just like nicolaitan we have
[2:44:51] today the curse everyone that won't go
[2:44:53] their way when Bill yeah the Chris
[2:44:55] shocked
[2:45:00] I just laughed for that
[2:45:02] no he said he's a shock but you're a
[2:45:05] shark
[2:45:10] they're watching his seat and calling me
[2:45:12] a shop
[2:45:14] you see we're not in a position to judge
[2:45:15] people like that this one Falls I can't
[2:45:18] say that Force Anointed The United come
[2:45:20] here to make them false
[2:45:23] when you're looking hit them so they
[2:45:24] will be false anointed
[2:45:26] Dynamics I don't make them that and
[2:45:28] dynamic will make you too bright when
[2:45:30] Dynamics hit you so all them for just go
[2:45:33] just spill others out of you
[2:45:41] so forget it then my paper rainbows
[2:45:45] called rainbow one and taking God
[2:45:47] rainbow to make make it their
[2:45:49] foolishness but but we call it a real
[2:45:51] rainbow
[2:45:52] isn't that right

[2:49:19] and make it fit our Dogma Creed or
[2:49:21] something let us take the word as it is
[2:49:24] believe in the Full Gospel all that
[2:49:26] Jesus taught us to do we do not believe
[2:49:28] that the Acts of the Apostles as a
[2:49:30] framework we believe is the word of God
[2:49:31] is the acts of your Holy Spirit and the
[2:49:34] apostles and we believe that the same
[2:49:36] Holy Spirit Lord that come upon them and
[2:49:38] the way they acted they'll do the same
[2:49:40] thing in us when it comes upon us if
