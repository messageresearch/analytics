written our hearts granted father in Jes name I ask it amen God bless you it's good to be back in Trinidad it's good to be back home from India and was a real blessing I thank you for your prayer I know I had to be in in there somehow and U it worked out beautifully and at the last service I I end up having to take thetion four Services Straight actually and um final service voice never broke and the last service I was just as strong as the first service so I thank God for strength I thank God for the support for prayer and I pray God that you know God bless you continue praying for us pray for the ministry love to see what the Lord will do tonight so tonight I have something up my heart I to share with you and I call it prayer connections and if you have your Bibles I like to turn to 1 John chapter 1 we want to read 5 to 10 then we want to go first John chapter 2 and read a portion down there and then we leave a portion in J and the grace of God J 42 so we want to go to First John 1 and we want to read from verse five this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we see that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleans us from our sin now let's reverse that it said if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another so if we not having Fellowship that mean somebody body is not walking in the light some kind of darkness is there now listen to this part verse seven again if we walk in the light so I'm in the light you are in the light we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us us not just me alone us from all sin now if we see we have no sin so you saying that but have sin or you this one have sin that one sin you don't if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us let's go to St John the first second chapter read from verse three hereby first John 2 hereby we know that we know him how we know him if we keep his commandment verse four he that sayth I know him and keep not his commandment is a liar and the truth is not in him now John is talking to Believers he's not talking to unbelievers he's talking to church folks okay verse five but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that seeth he abide in him but himself also to even as he want Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which he had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning again a new commandment I write unto you which things is true in him and in you because the darkness is path the True Light now shineth so this is where John goes deeper in verse 9 he that sayth he is in the light and hated his brother now remember I want you to focus they not Sinners he's talking to right this is church folks he that seeth he's in the light and hated his brother is in darkness even until now doesn't matter what they believe Doesn't Matter What doctrine verse 10 he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and WTH in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that Darkness has blinded his eyes Okay I want scripture here before we get to Job 1 Peter 3 verse 1-7 and something I want to get here remember what we call the prayer connections all right I know it doesn't sound I can connect it but we we get it 1 Peter 3 verse1 says likewise you wise be in subjection to your own husbands not any man your own husbands and if any obey not the word which is the husbands not BR they also May without the word be W by the conversation of their wives that conversation is way of life not to right verse two while they behold your Chase way of life conversation coupl with here whose adoring let it not be the outward adoring of platin here we we a BL put on a parel but let it be the hidden man of the heart so it identifies here the quality of spirit Christian wi should have and what they play in them in other words not your clothing not wearing of gold or put an apparel that not what you're pushing but what you have here verse four but let it be the hidden man of the heart in which it is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit Meek and quiet Spirit not carrying on Raam muffing you loose and you you know well Street like Behavior no no no me Qui Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old times the holy woman also who trusted in God orain or themselves being subject unto their own husbands even as Sarah obey Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters are as long as you do well and not afraid with any amazement so what we seeing here see this this as long as this will shock you that this is the order of God but this is the part I want to get you at verse seven likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel as being ears together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hinder and I want to look at it closely here now that your prayers be not hindered that means we can do things or things can affect us that our prayers are actually hindered now when we come to like a prayer meeting like what we have tonight A vir prayer meeting and you're being exalted you have to be aware that God will give us keys keys that would unlock doors unlock opportunities and luck and opening to help you then because you don't want to pray in V you don't want to be wasting your time you spend an hour praying and praying come like if you're using a sh play or say Hing Mary and you know God not really recognizing that that is just killing time we don't want to kill time we want to know that like how cour said I've heard your cry I have heard your prayer this particular scripture addressing Connection in prayer how a wrong connection with wife could affect a husband prayer we could reverse it also a wrong connection with your husband affects the wife prayer hindered your prayer actually get hindered so in other words if a sister is not in the spirit of this word that we just read here what prayer God will hear from her if she can't respect her husband H her husband listen to her husband she's not in the word she's in her own self in her own thing right now husband now he has to have wisdom and dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the one as unto the weak of vessel and being ears together of the grace of God that your prayers be not hinded so we don't want any hindrance tonight so I'm going to show you tonight that your prayer is not an isolated thing even though you in your own house in your own room is not just you and that's you and you alone but there are prayer connections and this is where I want to go to the text which is substantive text tonight J and the Lord here we go turned the Captivity of joob when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before now I wouldn't wary you with this because I know you know the story right now job's story is Affliction by Satan under God's permission right job lost his wealth his children his health and was less to suffer his friends who came to comfort him accused him of being a Sinn job you know job carry on but he never cured God right God finally answered job out of a willing challenged job and job eventually humbled himself I've heard of the by the I see the and so like that then God rebuked job's friends for speaking wrongly about him and commanded them to offer sacrifices and to ask job to pray for them but here's the thing the Bible says the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for him this is what I identify as a prayer connection the Captivity of job in other words job couldn't get his breakthrough until he did this act he couldn't go and fast for 40 days and 40 nights and come back and say hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory Glory Hallelujah no no no no no he have some friends or some brethren that has fely accused and God want job to be in a position to pray for these people now he can't pray for them these Bunch are richet oh God I can't take it no more and them no no no that's not what he had to forgive them he had to feel for them and he has to pray for them and then God released Jo so sometimes your prayer of greatr have to do with a connection maybe your husband maybe your wife maybe your children maybe your father mother uncle aunt boss whatever it is there may be some other person that is connected that that that has to be dealt with so until job obeyed God and showed compassion and forgiveness he couldn't get that way through and when he did that God blessed you and restore his prosperity and give him twice as we say give him double for his trouble he double up all what job had so it identifies that suffering is not always a result of sin suffering could be part of a test of Fai suffering could be also part of getting spiritual growth but it shows how you could press on in prayer and stand the word like how the prophet said it that job couldn't hear from God but the devil could move it so when we talk about prayer and connections connection is like relationship now I want to go into now briefly relationship and things so God could show if God shows you can get things you could ask for car house land husband wife you could get things higher pay better job blessings things but what he's interested in is relationship relationship now a relationship is there we go is the way two or more people are connected or the way they behave towards each other you cannot have a relationship with yourself let me repeat that you cannot have a relationship with yourself you have to relationship with somebody else two people right so you could say two men have a good working relationship the way in which two or more people feel and behave one each other so in John 13 Jesus said this same thing that John referred to what we read a new commandment I give to you talking to the disciples that you love one another as I have loved you so even if you have issues with your brethren Jesus was saying I am not talking about the issues among another I want you to love each other as I love you so what you're drawing from is God's love his love and he says now as I have loved you that you also love one another then he make this BMB statement and John 1325 by this shall all men know to are might now this is a whole Sy by itself if you have love one for another not if you have books not if you have tapes not if you talking the same talk and message talk and Doctrine talk and whatnot not that but if you have love one for another relationships is the way two or more people are connected or the way they behave towards each other relationship is also a connection between two or more facts like the relationship or the connection between smoking and cancer the relationship between or connection between hating anger and cancer it is a known fact people who in hatred and in Anger they tend to get tumors ulcers all kind of stuff right because they inviting Spirits they inviting chemical reactions and breaking in the body then I Spirit s in the next minute they have some tumor they have some kind of issue and now listen friends as I wrap up here try to W you can build a relationship you can develop a relationship you can establish a relationship you could have good relationships you could have close relationships you could have working relationship one time I was working with a guy principal about he's a cook but guess what he's the boss so we couldn't have a friendly you know body body relationship but had a working relationship to make sure whatever work needs to be done I to do it but you could have things and no relationship you could have money car house possession and no real con you live a selfish life is all about you yours maybe your husband children and the story ends right there now I want to share this with you but brother have an experience of a man that came to prayed for he was blind and the first thing he saw the man had no food platform and the first thing he said he slipped off his shoes give him my coat his should was much bigger he wanted to give him his coat his feet was much larger and I thought Paul's fellow probably never eat a decent meal in his life and I thought that look what happened to him he's blind Paul fellow if my daddy would have lived he'd be about that age and he said these words you have to feel for people if you can't you can never help anybody so you see like how God say He Love A Cheerful Giver you could give but you're not you're not happy to give you could actually share but you're not happy to share you're doing it because the law say or the words say or the rules say but you don't have the spirit behind it and brother Brandon says you have to feel for people if you can't you can never help anybody you've got to feel for them youve got to take it upon yourself and I just put my arms around him to see what he's he's getting into it he put his arms around him I said Heavenly Father be merciful to this poor man and I looked out there I see him standing looking at me out in front out there with his eyes and I know if he ever open his eyes it was over I just waited a few moments he Glory of Glory to God you know and he could see as good as I could stand stand on the platform and brother whatever I'm talking about to effectively pray for somebody you have to feel for them even if somebody is problematic to you you if you keep praying for that person you cannot hate that person you feel sorry for that person you'll have compassion for that person because that's a person that Jesus died for but abam said this not and I thought you know you have to feel the person's condition or you will never help you have got to hear these words enter into their suffering if you just go wholeheartedly it will never work you've got to place yourself maybe a big gang of little children out there somewhere question tonight do you want things or do you want to be a disciple some people use church and the gospel and the Lord and everything else as a tool a tool to satisfy their lust or satisfy their desire just their ambition what do you want tonight things or you want to come in obedience to God's word and the LA Matthew 6 we almost there right Matthew 6 Jesus speaks therefore I say unto you take no thought of your life what you shall eat what you shall drink so he's addressing desires that we have we pay the rent right this these are things that we need to get done for yet for your body what you shall put on like clothing is not life more than meat and body more than rainment R all the air for they so not neither do they reap no gu into BS yet your heavenly father feeded them right are are you not better than these which of You by giv thought can want cubert statue and you talk about the field field and so not part wherefore if God so CL the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into you of shall he not much closethe you be fit so the things he's saying God will take care of that go take care of that verse 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink where it shall we be clothed for here we go after all these things do the Gentiles seek so don't do like Gentiles they after this in that way for your heavenly father know it that you want them no he said your heavenly father know it that you have need of all these things now God promised to supply your needs not your wants your needs he know you need clothes he know you need food he know you need shelter you know you need money to pay a rent he know you need this you need that what you need so the need part is not an issue he know what you have need of these are things but verse 33 say it but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteous and all these things shall be added unto you so he is saying don't seek things seek relationship don't seek things seek the connections them take their for no thought for tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient of the days the evil thereof okay you're almost there pray connections Abraham Abraham never fight before never had a battle before he was in the desert and you know the story Abraham L lot had toward Sodom the mayor the city down there he's doing fine there but judgment coming all right and Abraham know that he is connected to lot and he decide to plead for lot pray for lot bear in mind lot don't have a clue his Abraham is praying for him and pleading for him if there's 50 righteous would you destroy Sodom if there's 30 if there's 20 if there is 10 he is going down that road because he want to see lot delivered that is the real Spirit of Christ it has a prayer connection he could have said man get bless with me you make up a bed he go sleep in it we so he go reap no no no no no no that is not the connection he had here so after Abraham plead we know the story Angel was dispatched to get lot up but listen to Matthew 18 tonight Jesus said I say unto you if two of you shall agree on it as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done them of My Father which is in heaven Jesus put a clause not just you now in your pray Clos but if two of you shall agree look how much of us has here tonight we could agree tonight on God's presence and power and God healing and God virtue and God strength if who of you shall agree that means Jesus is expecting us to connect Jesus is expecting us to have prayer connection pray Partners pray connection all you want to see it it's not just you soloing and nobody know what I going through and nobody come and look for me nobody shake their hand have no love and Breen are reaching out and this and that all that kind of foolishness you'll get all that nonsense and you would examine your own heart and life you don't come like somebody complain nobody come and look for them andbody pray with them and and GRE them and what when reverse the question do you look for anybody no do you pray anybody no do you go no so they don't do but they want to be done you a big shot you want to be on some Throne to be served you're not looking to serve why not begin to serve why not begin to pray and reach out so this is a key right here if two of you should agree do you agree with anybody there some people miserable they contentious they contenter us you say boo they say B they just go opposite just just because they have a kind of I don't know a kind of crazy nature of going opposite to the trend of things they don't want to fall in line they want to be different and they being obnoxious being IND different because they don't want to be in Harmony and the Bible talk about us being in the spirit then forget in Ephesians you talk about equality of spirit you have to begin to maintain that order of spirit okay what speaking about Unity of one God in church on their Pentecost but the Holy Ghost came from heav rushing Mighty wi the intellectual said men and virgin what shall we do and Peter said repent every one of you he baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of his sins you Char the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children to them that are far off even as Lord of God shall call there is what God wants you filled with here we go he wants you filled with the Holy Ghost then you'll be United what to what to a church no sir you'll Beed what to a Creed no sir you'll Beed to God and you and him will be one and as he as the father is one and what spirit will live in you the same works that the Holy Spirit performed when it was here in Christ Jesus shall be performed in you he said he will do it Jesus prayed for that now he says in the prayer tonight our Heavenly Master pray to the father that we be one he and God is one how CL with God was the life and spirit in him and if we are one with him we will be life and spirit of him will be in us then Earthly here we go Anana intellectual conception C and dogas will fade out and a new generated Born Again version experience of the baptism of the holy spirit will take place in the human heart then you'll be one then brother will really be brother sister will be sister your objectives and your motives and all that you are and all that you ever want to be or try to be will before the kingdom God no matter what church you represent where you go oh this is a beautiful quote this is a beautiful what you will be have in your heart the kingdom of God true there are so many people today who says that the holy spirit is not real today while tens of thousands of them and millions are saying it is not so there are many enjoying the blessings of mostly are poor people people who have been dejected and rejected by the world people who have been thrown over of their churches because they believe God to be God and they are been filled with the spirit they are one in purpose they are one in heart who are those people and but say Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic je witness Orthodox Jews all together they become one not one to a Creed not one to an denomination that's the working of the devil to intellectual conceptions but the working Holy Spirit the kingdom of God in you God sets on the throne of your heart in his control room listen carefully Saints controlling your emotions controlling your Powers controlling your conceptions making you one with him fellowship and in love and God fills you with love there a word we don't hear much of we hear Mysteries and all kind of Revelations and so on but God fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creature Creation in Christ then here we go then the love you go out and seemingly the bird seem different how different it is when Christ come or you can look back and think how I ever stay away from it how did I ever reject it everything is different B you have no enemies they all look sweet you can forgive everything that's ever been done the bitterest of enemy you can pray for on the Street's pause right a bden Myster b b bit of enemy people want to Fellowship another something wrong something is very wrong the bitterest of enemy you could pray for him on the street not only that put your arms around him and lift him up no matter what Creed or denomination belong he a preater whose Christ died and that's what God wants you to fill with that's the filling that's the kingdom that we all want praise the Lord last quot on we done get butam says isn't it wonderful I love him my heart I love him if I know any heart I believe you do too so together we are his children we love one another no I can't love him without loving you pause on that pause on that tonight if you say you love God you can love your brother says a liar you're lying you're not talking the truth I cannot love him without loving you and if I say I love him and don't love you read the Bible said I am a liar if you wanted to love me or love my family the choice was what do I want you to do love me or love my family you love my family I'd rather you love Billy Paul and love me if it come to that kind of Showdown I'd rather you do it I want you to listen to me because Billy is not a minister but I want you to listen to me I tell you when you want to love somebody really love them you say I want to either love you or Billy you love Billy God feels the same way about us then I know you can't love Billy without loving me was he part so I can't love God without loving you because you are part of God and we love one another and I think that is very let us bow ahead heavenly father I thank you Lord for this prayer connection I try to show your people here tonight that job until he prayed for his friends his accusers he couldn't get that breakthrough he couldn't get that double portion he couldn't get that double bless Lord instead of two or three would agree they could have what they ask for Lord Abraham had was to connect with lot's condition to pray for him Lord it was like a sign of adoption going after his Fallen brother and getting him back and everything else like that but the fact is he had that prayer communion Lord help us tonight to stand in Christ dead to have that connection we are not in this thing alone devil pull people aside in a corner and they have their own mind battles and fights and fears and thinking they're fighting all alone and everything else and the devil just beaten up in a corner here we are in this virtual room Lord together in prayer asking for your intervention ask him for your virtue ask that you reveal to us who and what we have to connect with who we need to pray for and love and serve and bless and help God time is running out as I was sharing with my wife I recognize that people have dreams and visions and inspiration and somehow they never get all of it fulfilled they may get some but that's how life is we don't have enough time to fulfill all we have in our hearts but while we have time may we do the best we can Lord I pray for the elders in the church ministers in the church deacons the trustees the offers I pray for the lady I pray all those are here tonight that you would Minister to them and meet their needs may they have confidence and truth that you are God that Supply our needs you know what we have need of but you encourage Us by your own word to seek first the king father God may you blessed tonight in and may your power take a hold tonight in a special of your Saints as they get and pray in Jesus name I ask it amen so God bless you thanks for being here tonight and I pray that these words will challenge you we challenge you to move a little higher to move a little further not just to say I'm in church and your prayer that just a religious atmosphere that you religious story if you come into obedience with this why you and your husband can't agree why you and your brother can't agree why you and your sister can't agree if two would agree on touching anything what you're agreeing on you're agreeing on the word you're agree in following in obedience to the word and God going to bless you tonight so God be with you as
