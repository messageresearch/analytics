[53:35] Hallelujah.
[53:37] Holy hallelujah.
[53:40] Praise God. Praise God.
[53:43] Praise God.
[53:46] Praise God.
[53:49] Praise God. Let's worship the Lord right
[53:52] now. Father, we bless you and praise
[53:54] you. We thank you for your presence. We
[53:56] thank you for your spirit Lord. We thank
[53:58] you for being here among us as you
[54:01] promised you would be have the prayer
[54:03] minister this morning and we approach
[54:04] your word. May you speak to our hearts
[54:06] in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen.
[54:09] You be seated. Oh, praise God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here tonight today.
[54:19] Praise the Lord.
[54:21] Uh if you haven't heard the exhortation
[54:24] from Friday, you should listen to it. Go
[54:26] back and listen to it. Praise God. Is a
[54:28] very very important something that I
[54:29] believe that God put upon my heart to
[54:32] share with you. And um praise the Lord.
[54:35] Amen. So I wonder if I could get
[54:38] something from that this morning.
[54:41] Didn't plan to, but
[54:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[54:46] Praise be to Jesus.
[54:51] um uh spoke about what excuse does how
[54:55] excuse and shifting blame like what Adam
[54:57] did keep you away from repentance
[55:00] because you're looking for escape
[55:01] hatchet into what you have done and so
[55:03] on doesn't make any sense and we show
[55:06] how David when he was accused when he
[55:08] was caught David said I have sinned I
[55:12] have failed and then mercy was extended
[55:14] to David
[55:15] &gt;&gt; so where was Adam and Adam was very
[55:18] crafty Uh he said when God say what have
[55:21] you done you know how you know you're
[55:22] naked he said the woman you give me
[55:24] making sure God understand you give me
[55:26] that woman and if you think that woman
[55:28] that's never going to happen so you see
[55:29] that's what excuses does it gives a
[55:32] justification and it gives something to
[55:34] minimize sin or justify your present
[55:36] position by making excuse by blaming
[55:38] this and blaming that but when you own
[55:40] up then there's mercy extended to you
[55:43] and grace extended to you so this to me
[55:45] is very very important and we come to
[55:47] the spot that we get deeply sincere here
[55:49] and you hear me over and over saying
[55:51] maturity is when you accept
[55:52] responsibility for your actions and your
[55:54] attitude. I'd like to blame anyone and
[55:56] say this and that but no but I take a
[55:58] choice a responsibility to act and to do
[56:02] like I used to teach my children share
[56:03] my share with my children you want to be
[56:05] able to have no regrets from this
[56:07] standpoint you treat somebody right
[56:09] treat somebody loving and caring if they
[56:11] treat you badly that have nothing to do
[56:12] with how you treat them
[56:14] &gt;&gt; is a choice you make and you're not
[56:16] taking back your choice you must never
[56:17] say I'm sorry I help them sorry I give
[56:20] them I'm sorry you must never say that
[56:23] it must be your choice because when God
[56:25] choose to love you. It was his choice.
[56:27] When you wasn't loving him back when you
[56:29] wasn't expressing mercy and grace to
[56:31] God, back love back to God, he expressed
[56:34] love to you.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God want us to do that
[56:37] to one another.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; God want us to help one another and pick
[56:40] each other up. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Blessed be the name of
[56:44] the Lord. So, praise God. We are
[56:47] grateful to be here this morning. Praise
[56:50] God.
[56:51] We didn't have that special, right? Did
[56:53] we?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; We could do it, sir.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we have a musical that we like
[56:58] to instrumental rather we like to play
[57:00] for you. Sister Naomi going to play
[57:01] something for us this morning and then
[57:03] I'll come back into the word. Praise to
[57:04] God.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:39] Heat. Heat.
[57:44] Heat. Heat.
[58:46] Heat. Heat.
[58:53] Heat. Heat. N.
[59:26] Heat. Heat.
[59:34] Heat.
[59:47] Heat.
[1:00:15] Glory.
[1:00:17] Hosana.
[1:00:19] Hosana.
[1:00:25] Don't sleep.
[1:00:37] One more time.
[1:00:52] Hallelujah.
[1:00:59] Jesus died and rose again. God bless
[1:01:01] you. Amen.
[1:01:04] At this time, I'd like you to turn your
[1:01:05] Bibles to three portion of scripture. We
[1:01:07] want to read from John chapter 7 verse
[1:01:10] 37-39. If you're writing it down, Acts
[1:01:12] chapter 19 1-2 and Acts chapter 8 14-17.
[1:01:19] Praise the name of the Lord. Thank you
[1:01:21] once again for coming out this morning.
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; We look and see what the Lord will do
[1:01:24] for us.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Reading from St. John
[1:01:27] chapter 7, reading from verse 37. In the
[1:01:30] last day, that great day of the feast,
[1:01:33] Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any
[1:01:35] man thirst, let him come unto me and
[1:01:37] drink. He that believeth on me, as the
[1:01:40] scripture had said, out of his belly
[1:01:43] shall flow rivers of living water. But
[1:01:48] this spake he of the spirit,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; all right?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Which they that believe on him should
[1:01:53] receive,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; For the Holy Ghost was not yet given.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Acts 19:1-2.
[1:02:02] It came to pass that while Apollos was
[1:02:04] as current, Paul having passed through
[1:02:07] the upper coast came to Ephesus and
[1:02:10] finding certain disciples, he said unto
[1:02:12] them, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; since he believed?" And they said unto
[1:02:18] him, we have not much so have heard
[1:02:20] whether there be any Holy Ghost.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 8, reading from verse 14.
[1:02:29] And when the apostles written by
[1:02:30] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:02:32] received the word of God,
[1:02:35] they sent unto them Peter and John,
[1:02:39] who when they were come down, prayed for
[1:02:43] them that they might receive the Holy
[1:02:45] Ghost.
[1:02:47] For as yet he was fallen upon none of
[1:02:52] them.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Note the words.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Only they were baptized in the name of
[1:02:57] the Lord Jesus.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Then laid their hands on them and they
[1:03:02] received the Holy Ghost. Let's pray.
[1:03:04] Father, we thank you for your word this
[1:03:06] morning. And I pray it would enlighten,
[1:03:08] inspire, bring revelation, inspiration,
[1:03:11] and transformation to the lives of
[1:03:12] people gathered here. May you break the
[1:03:14] bands of wickedness. Unlock their
[1:03:16] understanding. Open up your word to
[1:03:18] them. Bring clarity to your people. In
[1:03:21] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be
[1:03:23] seated. And I want to invite you to give
[1:03:24] God some praise as you sit down.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; I have to fight for every inch. That's
[1:03:34] what I'm doing here right now.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; So when I tell you sit down and praise
[1:03:37] God because I want some no praise demon
[1:03:39] to take their exit. We have no praise
[1:03:40] demons to fight. No praise demons is
[1:03:43] them that are sitting on your top lip
[1:03:44] and don't and you can't say amen and you
[1:03:46] can't rejoice and you can't raise your
[1:03:48] hand because you're worried about what
[1:03:49] happened out there. That's them demons
[1:03:51] we talking about. We want to kick them
[1:03:53] out. Want to get them the boots like how
[1:03:56] Satan get kicked out of heaven. We want
[1:03:57] to kick them out of heavenly places
[1:03:59] inside of here. And when you do that,
[1:04:01] you create an atmosphere of praise and
[1:04:03] thanksgiving that angels could come down
[1:04:06] and the glory of God could fill the
[1:04:08] house and God could fill it with joy
[1:04:10] unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Good to see you, Sister
[1:04:14] June. God bless you. Welcome back.
[1:04:16] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. All right, let me get
[1:04:22] the title.
[1:04:25] The spirit which they that believe on
[1:04:27] him should receive.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; That's the title.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; The spirit.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Glor
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; which they that believe on him
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; should receive.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus own words now.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Do you get it now?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:04:46] had said out of his belly shall flow
[1:04:48] rivers of living water. So this here was
[1:04:51] a prophecy
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; because the Bible went on next to say
[1:04:54] but this spake he of the spirit
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; which they that believe on him should
[1:04:59] receive
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; because that Jesus was not yet
[1:05:05] glorified.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is something that is
[1:05:07] given
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is something that you
[1:05:10] must receive
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is something that
[1:05:13] must fall upon you.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Where I get that scripture from? Look it
[1:05:16] right here.
[1:05:21] Hallelujah.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Now the apostles which were at Jerusalem
[1:05:24] heard that Samaria received the word of
[1:05:26] God.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So they had the word.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; They had the books. They press and play.
[1:05:31] They had the tapes. They had exorters
[1:05:33] and preachers. But they had the Holy
[1:05:34] Ghost yet.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Do you shout in the house?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; So they have to send for Peter.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; They have to send for Peter.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? and John who when they
[1:05:48] come down prayed for them
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; that they might receive this thing
[1:05:52] called the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; For as yet he was fallen upon none of
[1:05:57] them.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And to the group in Acts 19, it says we
[1:06:02] have not and much so heard
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; about any Holy Ghost.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; We don't even know we have to receive
[1:06:08] this thing.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; I thank God hearing about it because I
[1:06:12] know if I hear it,
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; I could receive it. If I don't hear it,
[1:06:16] if I don't hear about it, I don't even
[1:06:18] know it's for me. Okay, the Lord I
[1:06:21] shout. Hallelujah. He said, "Have you
[1:06:24] received the Holy Ghost?" Since you
[1:06:26] believe, not when you believe, but since
[1:06:30] you believe. Are we in the word this
[1:06:32] morning? Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:06:34] the house.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] So the title from Jesus words the spirit
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; which they that believe on him should
[1:06:44] receive
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; and have an inspiration another book of
[1:06:47] acts
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; not another message church another book
[1:06:51] of acts not another denomination another
[1:06:54] book of acts we are going to have
[1:06:56] another book of acts and the holy ghost
[1:06:59] is who wrote that book of acts that
[1:07:01] wasn't man's doing that was god's doing
[1:07:04] that was the operation of the spirit of
[1:07:06] god oh give the lord some praises.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "The works that I do,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; shall you do
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; and
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; greater."
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And we were taught that this greater
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; is to impart
[1:07:25] eternal life.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; It's a powerful That's a big one.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; That's beyond signs and wonders. Now,
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; So, this is the prophet saying here now.
[1:07:35] How much greater is it to say that this
[1:07:36] sick woman laying here, I can pray a
[1:07:38] prayer of faith and she'd be healed.
[1:07:39] That's a great thing. And that's what he
[1:07:41] was doing then. He said, "Greater than
[1:07:43] this shall you do. I'm going to give you
[1:07:45] power not only to raise him up for a
[1:07:48] while, but to give him eternal life
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; which will be eternal forever."
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Poor, blind, wretched people. How do you
[1:07:57] miss that? Don't you see what the
[1:07:59] greater thing is? That's the greatest
[1:08:01] thing that could ever happen was to
[1:08:05] impart
[1:08:06] eternal life to people.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; What is eternal life? The life that he
[1:08:12] lived, the life that was in him impart
[1:08:15] that to others.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Can a man do that? A son of God can.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever sins you remit to
[1:08:24] them that remitted. Whosoever sins you
[1:08:26] retain, to them that retain." And here
[1:08:28] is where the Catholic Church and many
[1:08:30] others make their big mistake. They go
[1:08:32] out and say, "I forgive your sins." That
[1:08:34] that wasn't it. How did they get their
[1:08:36] sins forgiven in the Bible? Peter
[1:08:38] answered the question of the day of
[1:08:40] Pentecost. What can we do to be saved?
[1:08:43] He said, "Repent every one of you and be
[1:08:46] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:08:48] the remission of your sins." And if
[1:08:50] you're inside of here and you haven't
[1:08:52] been baptized, you have to repent and
[1:08:53] get baptized in Jesus name.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Not in father, son, and holy ghost. in
[1:08:57] Jesus name
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; for the remission of your sins and you
[1:09:01] shall receive
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; this thing called the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You shall receive. You have
[1:09:06] somebody to receive. If we tell you
[1:09:08] downstairs we have cake or we have food
[1:09:10] or whatn not when you when you go
[1:09:12] downstairs don't miss it. Go and receive
[1:09:13] it. It's up to you to walk out and don't
[1:09:15] take none.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; If there are boxes of sandwiches and
[1:09:17] whatnot, we say when you leave the
[1:09:18] service you have sandwiches to pick up
[1:09:20] and you walk through the door and walk
[1:09:21] out fast. That's your business. But
[1:09:24] everybody who want it will go and take
[1:09:25] it and receive it because it's a promise
[1:09:27] if you go downstairs there is this there
[1:09:29] for you. Well Peter said repent every
[1:09:31] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:09:33] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:09:35] your sins and
[1:09:38] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:09:40] Ghost because the promise give the Lord
[1:09:44] a shout it's a promise. It's a promise.
[1:09:48] It's a promise. It's not something we
[1:09:50] have behind the pulpit here. It's a
[1:09:52] promise. The promise is unto you and to
[1:09:56] your children too and to them that are
[1:09:58] far off.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; It means everybody supposed to get this
[1:10:04] thing.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; It's not only for us these apostles.
[1:10:08] It's for you
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and your children and them that are far
[1:10:11] off. It go even further than that. As
[1:10:14] many as the Lord our God shall call. Oh,
[1:10:16] give the Lord a shout. It's not only for
[1:10:20] the Jews, it's for the Gentiles also.
[1:10:22] It's so the good. Hallelujah. So the
[1:10:24] wretched is to the miserable. It's for
[1:10:27] the prostitute. Whosoever well could
[1:10:30] come and receive of this thing. Give the
[1:10:32] Lord a shout.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And this Holy Ghost is just as real as
[1:10:43] it was in that day. Do I shout in the
[1:10:46] house? We are not imagining anything.
[1:10:49] Hallelujah. We not figuring out
[1:10:51] anything.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You see why Satan
[1:11:02] is so against the book of Revelation,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; spiritual revelation. He's against it.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; He's against the ministry today.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Why? It's revealing Christ.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Let the church go on with this great
[1:11:15] denomination and organization. It's
[1:11:17] little flowery messages and so forth.
[1:11:19] Let them go on with that. Satan won't
[1:11:20] bother with that. His ears are talking
[1:11:22] this talk.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; They don't have no troubles. Everybody
[1:11:26] pat them on the back.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; But when there comes a time
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; when God through the Holy Ghost
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; reveals Christ back in the church
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; with the power
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; and demonstrations of healing the sick
[1:11:41] and making the signs that he said would
[1:11:43] follow the believers come to pass, then
[1:11:45] Satan turns over in his bed and he does
[1:11:47] something about it. Just like him for
[1:11:50] years. I'm telling you, they will not
[1:11:52] close us down for doing what we doing
[1:11:53] this morning.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; We are just another church, another
[1:11:58] group, another fellowship, another
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Satan not interested in that. Satan
[1:12:04] don't believe we who we are.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; The press come down and the press and
[1:12:12] the press. What press?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; You pressing your own stuff with your
[1:12:14] foolishness.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Devil is not coming down on you. You
[1:12:18] doing your you, you doing you.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And if you doing you, the devil hands
[1:12:23] off.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look how they acting stupid.
[1:12:25] Leave them alone.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; I touching them. Leave them. They been
[1:12:28] the folly. Let them fight one another,
[1:12:30] cuss one another, hate one another, bit
[1:12:33] against one another. I ain't touching
[1:12:34] that. I have other work to do. He busy,
[1:12:36] you know, two and four over the earth,
[1:12:37] you know,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; but let them strike the unity of the
[1:12:40] faith. Let them strike forgiveness. Let
[1:12:43] them strike brotherly kindness. Let them
[1:12:45] come under expectation. Let them come
[1:12:47] just and devout and sanctified
[1:12:48] worshiping God. Fire going to fall in
[1:12:51] this place. Signs and wonders going to
[1:12:54] be the going to work right in
[1:12:56] this place. Blind will see right in this
[1:12:59] place. Don't get me started this
[1:13:01] morning.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to roll? You know,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; you may be seated.
[1:13:10] And Friday prayer meeting we read to you
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; God's servants can't get into action
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; till the people pray
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; if you put the anointing on the man
[1:13:25] alone you're not praying know
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; you're waiting for your bishop to come
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; he not here this morning you know
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; bishop missing you're wishing for some
[1:13:33] pope to come
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; but if you recognize as a believer
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; you have an opportunity unity
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; and a part and a purpose to light the
[1:13:45] match
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; of this revival fire.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You will change how you talk in your
[1:13:53] house. You will change how you pray in
[1:13:55] your house. You will change what you do
[1:13:57] in your house because there's an angel
[1:13:59] watching you. The Lord a shout.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Did you hear that?
[1:14:07] There's an angel watching you.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; We preach certain quotes for years
[1:14:15] because we want you to know the word.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he is marking the
[1:14:18] people now.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Some to get the Holy Ghost and some to
[1:14:20] be judged.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Satan comes over in his bed. He does
[1:14:28] something about it. Until that time,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Satan don't care how much church you
[1:14:34] join.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; See, look. He he he joined that one. He
[1:14:38] joined that one. He going that one. He
[1:14:39] going to one. He got this one. He he
[1:14:40] like the pastor. They looking more
[1:14:41] messages and he have more mysteries and
[1:14:43] he's deeper and he speak some long long
[1:14:45] services. T them preaching too short.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Satan don't care how much you join.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; He don't care how much. But when Christ
[1:14:56] here we go reveals to you that he's the
[1:14:59] son of God.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And the works he did you do also. Not
[1:15:03] some other works but the same works.
[1:15:06] They are not giving out books like the
[1:15:07] works. Hallelujah. The same works that I
[1:15:10] do shall you do also. You have to
[1:15:13] believe that and these signs shall
[1:15:15] follow the pastor. No, them that believe
[1:15:19] some pastor don't even believe. Okay,
[1:15:20] the Lord has shout at the house but them
[1:15:23] that believe. Come on you believers. Let
[1:15:26] me say amen. Don't watch and stare. Say
[1:15:30] amen. Open your mouth and say amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me the works that I
[1:15:44] do
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; shall do also
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; do the same works and greater than this
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; here we go.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Christ could not preach the baptism of
[1:15:54] the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; We warming up.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Christ could not preach
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; He could not bring it to them because
[1:16:12] the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been given.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; So he told them,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; "If I don't go,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; the comforter is not going to come."
[1:16:25] So you can't receive this once I'm here
[1:16:27] in this way.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; But I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to you. Okay. The Lord
[1:16:35] I shout a little while the world seeth
[1:16:37] me no more but you are going to see me
[1:16:40] today.
[1:16:43] This spirit that they had to receive it
[1:16:47] was on its way. Oh glory to God. Give
[1:16:50] the Lord a shout. And I say this
[1:16:53] morning,
[1:16:55] it's on its way.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:17:01] My God, the praises of God's in the
[1:17:03] house this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:07] Hallelujah. So Christ couldn't preach
[1:17:10] it, but his disciples could. His
[1:17:14] ministers could, his apostles could, his
[1:17:18] pastors could
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; something stretch, something strike my
[1:17:29] freshman Clarence. Jesus
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; in his postresurrection ministry when he
[1:17:35] raised from the dead and appear and
[1:17:37] appeared to the private meeting with
[1:17:39] disciples all he could have said was
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; receive he the Holy Ghost oh this is
[1:17:45] powerful he couldn't give it to them he
[1:17:47] said receive ye the Holy Ghost behold I
[1:17:50] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:17:54] but t in the city of Jerusalem until you
[1:17:58] receive power from on high going to bust
[1:18:01] your kind of spirit. You're going to
[1:18:02] break your kind of nature. You're going
[1:18:04] to break. Oh, you can't do this and you
[1:18:06] can't overcome this and you can't get
[1:18:08] victory over this. You're going to bust
[1:18:10] that. Oh, give the Lord a shout. All
[1:18:12] what you can overcome. You're going to
[1:18:14] overcome. It's the Holy Ghost on fire.
[1:18:17] They're going to keep you alive. They
[1:18:19] give you power to pray, power to
[1:18:21] overcome, power to say, "I'm sorry."
[1:18:24] Power to say that you're wrong.
[1:18:39] Hallelujah.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; So this this morning is loaded.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You might have to go back
[1:18:47] and listen to the tape, but this is
[1:18:48] loaded this morning.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; All right. He could not bring it to them
[1:18:53] because the Holy Ghost hadn't yet been
[1:18:56] given. But when Jesus came and
[1:18:59] sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost
[1:19:02] returned, then they could impart eternal
[1:19:06] life to the people. And that's the
[1:19:08] greater.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; But the signs and wonders Jes Jesus
[1:19:15] plainly said in Mark 16, go into all the
[1:19:18] world, preach the gospel. How far? All
[1:19:19] the world, every creature. As long as
[1:19:22] the gospel is being preached, these
[1:19:24] signs shall follow them.
[1:19:27] that believe.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; So Moses was rejected and Jesus was
[1:19:36] rejected and they rejected the message
[1:19:39] from Samuel. Isn't that right?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham says, "This is the
[1:19:44] law of God to receive a vindicated
[1:19:47] servant." Note his words, not servant,
[1:19:50] but vindicated servant.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Moses was vindicated.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Jesus was vindicated.
[1:19:56] Samuel was vindicated and he turned them
[1:19:58] down.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So then he said this here. Now this is a
[1:20:01] law of God. The law is to receive a
[1:20:05] vindicated servant.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Verily, verily I say unto you, he's
[1:20:08] quoting scripture.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; He that receive whosoever I send
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; receiveth receives me. And he that
[1:20:17] receives me receive him that sent me. A
[1:20:20] vindicated servant. He said there's a
[1:20:22] thousand servants laying there. is the
[1:20:23] law of God. So Jesus said, "He that
[1:20:26] receives them that I send receives me."
[1:20:29] And now them that he send them that
[1:20:32] receives me receive and send me. Wish we
[1:20:34] had time to linger on that.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Then he said these words,
[1:20:38] "You can only serve God
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; as you do and believe the servants that
[1:20:45] God sends."
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; He's going deeper. You can only serve
[1:20:49] God on earth as God's servants that are
[1:20:53] sent on earth by divine inspiration
[1:20:57] interpret the word to you.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; So God vindicated this man called
[1:21:01] William Brham as the 20th century
[1:21:03] prophet as Malachi 4, Luke 17:30,
[1:21:06] Revelation 10:7. He was the vindicated
[1:21:09] prophet that interpret the word by
[1:21:12] divine inspiration to us.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And he said when a church is groaning
[1:21:18] under the persecution of the outside
[1:21:20] world that this Holy Ghost is just as
[1:21:23] real when as it was in Pentecost when
[1:21:27] they are born and positionally born then
[1:21:31] God sets in the church not before
[1:21:35] God sets in the church pastors and
[1:21:37] prophets and teachers evangelists by
[1:21:39] what the Holy Ghost
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; not man anointed not manappointed but
[1:21:44] God called man. Oh God, if God call you,
[1:21:48] God call you. God can't cancel his
[1:21:50] calling upon you. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:21:52] shout. Hallelujah. If God elected you,
[1:21:55] God elected you. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:21:58] Praise God. I enjoy that message Isaac
[1:22:01] brought in Malachi. He said, you say, "I
[1:22:03] don't love you." Praise God. Let me show
[1:22:05] you. Praise God. It wasn't Esau Jacob's
[1:22:08] brother. Let me show you what hate looks
[1:22:09] like. Oh, glory to God. Don't talk about
[1:22:12] I love you. My love is elective love.
[1:22:15] Praise God. I could send you through the
[1:22:16] flood. I could send you through trials.
[1:22:18] I could send you through whatever you
[1:22:19] want to go, whatever you have to go
[1:22:21] through. But don't tell me, don't ever
[1:22:23] say it's not my love.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So therefore,
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; God's channel is men, servants, that he
[1:22:38] vindicate those men.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Vindicate those servants and then you
[1:22:41] believe them to be genuine servants of
[1:22:42] God. All right. But Abraham said that
[1:22:46] proves that his message is through his
[1:22:49] servants always has. Now the power of
[1:22:52] the believing church.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Christ has all power in heaven. He said
[1:22:57] all power is heaven is given to me.
[1:22:58] Christ have all power. He is the seed
[1:23:02] word in his body.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And he in us becomes the seed word in
[1:23:10] us. Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And all that was in God, he poured into
[1:23:15] Christ.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ, he poured into
[1:23:18] the church.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's the power.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Now, remember God's law of reproduction
[1:23:23] after its kind. The seed of Christ, the
[1:23:26] word must come through his body.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; That is why that sent for Peter and John
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; because those bunch of people only had
[1:23:34] books and tapes.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; They only had the word alone. They
[1:23:37] believed the message, but they didn't
[1:23:38] have the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost
[1:23:40] can only come
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; through the body. This is after
[1:23:43] Pentecost now. There's not going to be
[1:23:45] another 120 in no room. That happened
[1:23:47] back there. Not going to happen again.
[1:23:49] The Holy Ghost now is poured out on
[1:23:52] individuals.
[1:23:55] Come on now. Come on now. Come on
[1:23:57] tabernacle. Give me a shout. This is the
[1:23:59] word we talking about. The Holy Ghost is
[1:24:01] poured out on individuals. So you can
[1:24:03] sit there telling yourself, "The Holy
[1:24:06] Ghost could pour out on me.
[1:24:18] Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; It could happen. You know,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; not next week, today.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; So all this thing about they need no
[1:24:35] pastor, they want no pastor and and
[1:24:36] whatn not on there. Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Watch it. You know,
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; it has some bent up people that come
[1:24:42] into this message. You know,
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; it has some bent up minds twisting this
[1:24:45] word. You know,
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; we have a pattern.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And this is another book of acts.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; We have a pattern which is the Bible.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Brother didn't come and preach outside
[1:24:54] the Bible. You know,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; he came to reveal what is in this book.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; This book is the the typost.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; This book is the anchor point.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Wherever the angel tell him, you got to
[1:25:04] check it here.
[1:25:06] And Paul said, "If an angel come down
[1:25:09] from heaven and preach any other gospel,
[1:25:13] oh give the Lord a shout, let him be a
[1:25:16] cursed
[1:25:18] much as a trillion that angel." Oh, give
[1:25:20] the Lord a shout, much less a smoke out.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This one come from heaven
[1:25:34] and Paul said light them a fire.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Paul went and put himself on the line.
[1:25:40] He said I come back
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; and preach something different that I
[1:25:44] originally bring. Let me be a curse.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Wipe me out too.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. We coming to the word. You know
[1:25:50] I want a church with discernment. I want
[1:25:53] a church with revelation. I want a
[1:25:55] church that is anchored. I want a church
[1:25:57] that wind can't blow your hair and blow
[1:25:58] your hair. I want a church rooted and
[1:26:00] grounded. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:26:04] Hallelujah.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; A new season is here.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; You hear what I said?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; A new season is here.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; I believe all my heart.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; These are thing I preach already. And
[1:26:22] listen, this my I just like you know
[1:26:24] sometimes you know this book,
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; this Bible, this message
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; it just sometime you it right there. But
[1:26:31] when it's time for you to see God, open
[1:26:33] your eyes. And and I am hoping that you
[1:26:35] see what I see how I see it.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; I'm hoping you catch it this morning.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Brother, the seed of Christ,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; must come through his body.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Not through a denomination,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; but through a bornagain seed of the
[1:26:54] word. It must come true. Remember that.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; How does my seed come? Through the body.
[1:27:00] How does the apple seed come? Through
[1:27:01] the body. Seed is through the body.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And the church is the body of Christ.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You see how we bring it?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; The body of Christ.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus talked about how he build his
[1:27:13] church.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; He said flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:27:16] unto you and upon this rock
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; I will build my church. So he have a my
[1:27:23] church.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Not everybody church is Jesus church. He
[1:27:26] have your own my church. I will build my
[1:27:28] church and with my church he gets a hell
[1:27:32] prevail against it because my church is
[1:27:34] built upon revelation. When God reveal
[1:27:37] it to you, there's enough devils in hell
[1:27:39] to throw that off from inside of you to
[1:27:42] move you from that. There's a song like
[1:27:44] I like old song faith of our fathers
[1:27:47] living still in spite of fire, dungeon
[1:27:50] and sword.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; The faith of our fathers is living
[1:27:54] still.
[1:27:55] Money can't change it.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Riches can't change it.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Nothing can change that faith.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; So, how does the apple seed come?
[1:28:06] Through the body. Seed is through the
[1:28:09] body. And the church is the body of
[1:28:11] Christ. And when he's talking about the
[1:28:13] church, he's not talking about this
[1:28:14] tabernacle here. He's talking about the
[1:28:16] body of Christ. And by one spirit,
[1:28:19] that's how you get into that body.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; You can't join that body. You join your
[1:28:23] family. You wake up as a baby with your
[1:28:25] D power and just sign up and just can I
[1:28:27] join? You're coming. You're coming
[1:28:28] through. No hands. Somebody give you
[1:28:31] birth. Somebody bed you
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; and they tack a name on you. You born
[1:28:36] into a name. So if your name last name
[1:28:38] is John, you are born into John.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And then your name Harry John or John
[1:28:42] John
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; or tall John or Mr. whatever they put
[1:28:47] attack on you. But those two names are
[1:28:49] not important. The next name, partter
[1:28:51] name is the name you make for yourself.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on now.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; They they could name you Esau.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; They could even name you Kane. Say, but
[1:29:05] you you can't. That don't mean you king
[1:29:09] with you.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; But the name you make for yourself,
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; that's different all together.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; That speaks volume.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:29:18] Hallelujah.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Like in in funerals I say, "Oh, some
[1:29:21] people die as if they never live."
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; No track, no record, no nothing. Just
[1:29:27] nothing. No footprints on the sands of
[1:29:29] time. No legacy, nothing you could say
[1:29:32] while there live a life out. No, you
[1:29:35] don't want to be like that.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Leave some footprints.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; In in Lagos, I you heard me preach about
[1:29:43] the lighthouse. The lighters don't argue
[1:29:46] just stand there and shine.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Darkness coming, darkness going, rays
[1:29:50] roaring. What the light stand that what
[1:29:52] good that that put light for.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; And Jesus say you are the light of the
[1:29:56] world.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Stand up like a lighthouse.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You said if you're moving, you're old,
[1:30:00] but you're still like a lighthouse.
[1:30:01] You're still shining some light.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Go over your old and you stay old. You
[1:30:08] have a old for purpose. You have to have
[1:30:10] some wisdom is coming out your mouth.
[1:30:11] Some people just get old, you know. No
[1:30:14] wisdom at all. You know,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Like a 70-y old man in a 50-y old body.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, no.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; 15.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; A 70-y old man with a 15y old mind.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be like that.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about he don't want to
[1:30:32] get old and crabby.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; One of the worst thing to become is a
[1:30:35] crabby crabby person.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; You're grumpy. You're grumpy. Everything
[1:30:38] is a grump. Is a grump is a grump.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Nobody want to be around you. Help
[1:30:44] us God.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; But Ion say the right thing. Help us.
[1:30:50] Help us. Help us. Help us. The children.
[1:30:53] So the children. So I remember years ago
[1:30:54] tell say do yourself. No. I say forget
[1:30:57] them you know. I said don't get big and
[1:31:00] old and leave. Fix yourself up and
[1:31:02] encourage you because I say serve
[1:31:04] Christ.
[1:31:06] And they were small when I said look at
[1:31:08] them now.
[1:31:10] Everybody
[1:31:11] child
[1:31:13] that child here come
[1:31:18] big man on inside your house
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; all right let's go
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Paul Jesus
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; was afraid that the people would watch
[1:31:27] some kind of big words he would say
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; some kind of education so Paul was
[1:31:32] educated
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; because God needed that gift and that
[1:31:36] talent to expound on the old testament
[1:31:39] and write the you
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Peter couldn't do that. He was a
[1:31:42] fisherman cross body got read or right
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; like issues you can't put a pen and
[1:31:47] paper and a man say write and things
[1:31:48] like that you understand I'm saying so
[1:31:50] Peter would have been limited
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; to write these apostles this epistles
[1:31:54] but Paul was gifted
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; to do that
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and God used him to do that so it's not
[1:31:59] like God don't interested in somebody
[1:32:01] educated or education no it's the
[1:32:03] capacity and the yielding that we have
[1:32:05] that yielding to God
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; so because of that Paul said I didn't
[1:32:10] come to you with enticing words of man
[1:32:12] wisdom
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; that your faith may not rest on the
[1:32:15] wisdom of man because when I bring that
[1:32:17] word so and twist
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; never see it so I didn't come with that
[1:32:24] never see it so thing
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; I came that your faith may rest in the
[1:32:29] power of God
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; and my preaching and teaching reflected
[1:32:33] that
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; so he said it here now I never come to
[1:32:39] you in speaking words intellectual you
[1:32:41] that but that your faith might be some
[1:32:42] sinary thing but I come to you with the
[1:32:44] simplicity in the power and
[1:32:47] demonstration of the Holy Ghost that
[1:32:49] your faith should rest in the word of
[1:32:51] God.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; So if God pull the rug under me and I
[1:32:55] gone tomorrow when I say gone out of
[1:32:57] here
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; you go backside.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I never preach me.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I hope me is not in none of your heart
[1:33:07] but I that won't preach in here at all.
[1:33:09] In other words, if I go on tomorrow, the
[1:33:11] word is still God. You know, nothing
[1:33:13] changes. The shout continues. The
[1:33:16] promise continues because we laying a
[1:33:18] seed and hoping it come to life. That's
[1:33:21] what brother talk about. Give the Lord a
[1:33:24] praise in the house.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; We put in a tape.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, your tape this morning. You back. If
[1:33:33] you say that, you back.
[1:33:36] Hallelujah.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; There's a tape playing here.
[1:33:39] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; You can watch it on the screen here.
[1:33:43] Right now, you're seeing a tape playing
[1:33:45] right now. You're not here to see me.
[1:33:47] You're here for the word. You're here to
[1:33:49] get something inside.
[1:33:56] Your training is not to a leader. Your
[1:33:59] training is to the word.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; I told her brother, every cult leader,
[1:34:03] whether in this message or out, when
[1:34:05] they fall, the whole thing fall down.
[1:34:07] That's true. That's true.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; I said church in America went from
[1:34:09] 15,000 to about 1,000 people and then
[1:34:11] out, close out
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; in four months time
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; because the cult leader got flattened
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; by what is in man
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; and the three things they have to deal
[1:34:23] with. Lust of the eyes, lust of the
[1:34:25] flesh,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; and the pride of life. And them hit get
[1:34:28] them get hit with all
[1:34:31] not just one, you know, all all. Let's
[1:34:33] hit them.
[1:34:35] Hallelujah.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; And the incredible thing about these
[1:34:38] guys, they have the money,
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; they have the cars, they have the
[1:34:42] private jets, they have the campuses,
[1:34:44] they have the fame, they even write
[1:34:46] books and all.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; They are multi-millionaires. And
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Satan collapsed them.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; The god of this evil age.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; What did our prophet taught us? He
[1:34:59] taught us that if the Pentecostals had
[1:35:02] received the word, rapture rapture take
[1:35:04] place already
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; because the word is what gives character
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; not gifts
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and we have seen enough gifted people
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; with no life.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; We not interested in so much how much
[1:35:16] gift you have. We love your gift but do
[1:35:18] you have something else besides that?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; What else you bring to the table?
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; What else do you bring to the table? I
[1:35:25] have a gift. Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That what the man had very talented.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; He give him the gift. He g him to do
[1:35:30] what thing and he come the master come
[1:35:31] back and say hey oh master so glad you
[1:35:34] come back. The same gift you give me.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; He dig it up and give him.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; He say wicked he call wicked you know.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; We just take it easy on people you know.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; But God see wickedness you know.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; At least they could have put it in the
[1:35:50] bank.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know it's half% they're
[1:35:52] giving now
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; of getting one at least
[1:35:56] at least I'll get a.5% on my money but
[1:36:00] to bury it
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; inflation is more than that you know
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; then Jesus made an astonishing statement
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; when he said give it to the man who made
[1:36:11] the most give him him
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; then he said to him that had not the
[1:36:15] little that he have
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; will be taken away from him
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; don't be in trouble. You know,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; you better come good. You know,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; God want productivity. You know,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; God want your praise and worship. You
[1:36:27] know, I look at if your roof blow off
[1:36:28] last night and you're supposed to be sad
[1:36:30] this morning, show God your faith by
[1:36:32] giving him praises right here in this
[1:36:34] house right now. Give the Lord a shout
[1:36:43] because this is what demonstrates faith.
[1:36:45] Not when things going smooth, not when
[1:36:47] things going good. When you don't have
[1:36:49] the answer to the question that you're
[1:36:51] asking God, you don't have the answer,
[1:36:55] you could trust him still
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; because he knows best. And Romans 8:28
[1:37:00] still applies. And we know that all
[1:37:02] things work together for good. Glory to
[1:37:04] God. You want this, you want that, but
[1:37:06] let God's will be done.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:37:14] The denominational churches will not the
[1:37:17] the denominational churches will
[1:37:19] outnumber the bride a thousand to one.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And he quote a scripture Isaiah 54:1.
[1:37:26] Sing, O baron, thou that does not bear,
[1:37:28] breathe out into singing and cry aloud.
[1:37:30] Thou that not travail with child. For
[1:37:31] more are the children of the desolate
[1:37:35] that the children of the married wife
[1:37:36] sayeth the Lord.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; More are the children of the than
[1:37:40] the married wife. Outnumber us many
[1:37:42] times. Though there be more in numbers,
[1:37:44] they have no true father.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; The denominational kinds is represented
[1:37:49] in Jude 8:13. That's a secular church.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Jude call them clouds without rain
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; forming in their own shame.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal church I'm still reading
[1:37:59] is represented by second Timothy 3.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; That is in the message now.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; but denying the power because they have
[1:38:10] seals. Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; They have words.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; But they don't want the power of God.
[1:38:19] You see, because the power of God
[1:38:20] handles all of us, you know.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; The power of God doesn't make the
[1:38:23] minister bigger and the sheep smaller.
[1:38:26] You know, the power of God come to
[1:38:27] flatten everybody. You know,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; notice all of them was in the upper
[1:38:31] room.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Peter saying I'm Peter. You know, I had
[1:38:33] to go up there. No, I outside the room
[1:38:34] and I want to show that I have a higher
[1:38:37] post for I with Mary Mary Magdalene in
[1:38:41] that crowded room the door closed and
[1:38:42] door shut. I'm not in that. I am brother
[1:38:45] Peter. I walk with I walk on water. I
[1:38:47] want you to know I walk on water.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And somebody will say talk all Peter
[1:38:52] talking somebody say deny Christ three
[1:38:53] time. He said all right all right all
[1:38:55] right.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; You see all have sinned and come short
[1:38:59] of the glory.
[1:39:01] And you inside of here who feel you're a
[1:39:03] big shot above anybody else because
[1:39:04] you're they're dressing longer or
[1:39:06] brighter or taller or whatever it is.
[1:39:08] You think in your own mind you're
[1:39:09] fooling yourself because all of us have
[1:39:11] come short of the glory of God. All of
[1:39:13] us need this Holy Ghost, the spirit
[1:39:18] that God promised that you have to
[1:39:20] receive
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; the sealed church, the real church, the
[1:39:30] true sperm.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; That's why when God told the prophet
[1:39:33] pick up right, he said out of a group,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; out of the church, a group will of the
[1:39:38] true seed of the word,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; God represent Christ, a beloved bride.
[1:39:41] So it has to come the true seed of the
[1:39:43] road word and that true seed means no
[1:39:45] man's idea interpretation.
[1:39:48] Man shall not by bread alone but by
[1:39:50] every word from the mouth of God means
[1:39:51] by the words of the prophets.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; This Bible is the words of the prophets
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; because God big enough to ensure that
[1:39:57] whatever words he want in this book it's
[1:39:58] in this book.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; So he want these words for a purpose
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; for our examples. All right.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[1:40:10] Let's see how this book of acts working
[1:40:12] here. Now
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; there's from Acts chapter 8. We want to
[1:40:14] read from verse 25 to 38. I know a
[1:40:16] little teaching this morning but I feel
[1:40:18] this is important foundation for what
[1:40:19] God is about to break out among us.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He will break it among us. Acts 8 28-38.
[1:40:25] And they when they are testify and
[1:40:28] preach the word of God return to
[1:40:30] Jerusalem and preach the gospel as many
[1:40:32] villages of the Samaritans.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; So now the church is unmoved. The gospel
[1:40:37] is spreading. These disciples and
[1:40:39] apostles, they are lit up with the power
[1:40:40] and presence of God.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Verse 26. And the angel of the Lord
[1:40:44] spake unto Philillip, not the minister
[1:40:47] association.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Not some man overseas talking to
[1:40:50] Philillip.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; The angel spoke to Philillip
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; and said, arise,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; go towards the south unto the way that
[1:40:57] go from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is the
[1:40:59] desert.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; And he arose and went.
[1:41:02] And behold, a man of notice the angel
[1:41:05] will tell him everything to do.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Just arise. Go there.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Philip goes there and watch verse 27. He
[1:41:12] arose and went. Behold, a man of
[1:41:13] Ethiopia and Enoch, Enoch of great
[1:41:16] authority under Candice, Queen of the
[1:41:19] Etopians, who had the charge of all her
[1:41:21] treasure, had come to Jerusalem to for
[1:41:23] to worship, was returning, sitting in
[1:41:26] his chariot, reading Isaiah's the
[1:41:29] prophet. Then the spirit said unto
[1:41:32] Philillip, note again who is directing
[1:41:34] this thing.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Go near and join thyself to this
[1:41:38] chariot. Philip rant to him, heard him
[1:41:42] read the prophet Isaas and said,
[1:41:44] understand this thou what those readers?
[1:41:47] He said, how can I except some man
[1:41:50] should guide me? And he desired
[1:41:53] Philillip that he would come and sit
[1:41:55] with him. The place of the scripture
[1:41:58] which it read was this. He was led as a
[1:42:01] sheep to the slaughter like a lamb down
[1:42:03] before a sharer. So opening not his
[1:42:05] mouth. In his humiliation his judgment
[1:42:08] was taken away. Who shall declare his
[1:42:10] generation? For the life is taken from
[1:42:12] the earth. And the uno answered
[1:42:14] Philillip and said, I pray he of whom
[1:42:16] speaketh the prophet of this of himself
[1:42:18] of another man. Here we go. Then
[1:42:21] Philillip opened his mouth and began at
[1:42:25] the same scripture
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and preached unto him Jesus.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You hear what he preached?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; People preaching Brandham.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham came to introduce
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Brother Bram came
[1:42:47] to do what? Introduce who?
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Introduce who?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; One more time. Introduce who?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. As John the Baptist was
[1:42:54] sent to Veron the first coming, you have
[1:42:56] a message that would forun my second
[1:42:59] coming. Brother Brandham came to
[1:43:01] introduce Jesus Christ.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Not message popes, message wars or
[1:43:07] church wars. He came to introduce Jesus.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Says we want to see Jesus.
[1:43:13] Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; And when they went their way, verse 36,
[1:43:17] they came unto a certain water. And Uno
[1:43:19] said, "Here is water." What hinder me to
[1:43:22] be baptized? That man was desperate.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; That man was a seed.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That man was a son.
[1:43:28] God wasting time. He has sent Philip to
[1:43:30] waste time. When a man see water, he say
[1:43:32] look water there.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; What? What hinderest me to be a
[1:43:34] baptized?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Watch this now. And Philip said unto
[1:43:40] him, "If thou believest with all thy
[1:43:41] heart, thou meest."
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; And he and said, "I believe
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ is the son of God."
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And he commanded the chariot to stand
[1:43:51] still.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; And they went both down into the water,
[1:43:54] both Philillip and the uno, and he
[1:43:57] baptized them.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Praise God.
[1:44:01] Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelu Brandom.
[1:44:05] Now remember the gospel was never
[1:44:07] committed to angels. God never committed
[1:44:09] his preaching of the gospel to an angel.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; So the angel, praise God, is wrong if
[1:44:14] he's different from the word.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Notice Philillip was at Pentecost
[1:44:18] Jerusalem to worship.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; How many say amen to that?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. The uno has been with the
[1:44:24] deities and the elders and everything
[1:44:26] else. Why didn't he get something but a
[1:44:29] punch? But what I'm saying he was with
[1:44:30] the deities. He was the best of the best
[1:44:32] in the message, but he didn't get
[1:44:34] nothing.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came back studying the
[1:44:38] prophecy of Isaiah. Although, here we
[1:44:40] go. An angel directed Philillip to him,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; but the germ of life
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; had to come through the body.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And Philillip, give the Lord a shout.
[1:44:51] Where did the germ come from?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Through the angel.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; The angel train where to go. An angel is
[1:44:58] a messenger. But here is a son. Philip
[1:45:02] had the germ, the message, the word.
[1:45:05] That is how a child can be born. And
[1:45:08] Philip laid hands upon him. And he was
[1:45:11] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:13] And there comfort the spirit of God. Now
[1:45:16] the German to come from the body. What
[1:45:18] body? Christ's body. And Philillip was a
[1:45:21] member of that body. There's going to be
[1:45:24] another book of acts.
[1:45:26] Give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; There's going to be another book of
[1:45:31] acts.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:37] And this is the same thing happened with
[1:45:38] Peter in Acts 10. Peter was in the ropes
[1:45:41] and rotop angel direct him to
[1:45:43] Cornelius's house. And the Bible said
[1:45:44] while Peter speak these words. Not the
[1:45:46] angel, not the canon. While Peter spake
[1:45:49] these words, he was in the body. He had
[1:45:51] the word and the angel directed it. But
[1:45:53] the life come through the body. And you
[1:45:55] know what happened? Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; They were filled
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; and didn't get baptized yet
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; because his heart was right.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; He was just he was devout. He was a
[1:46:06] giving person. He gives so much that God
[1:46:09] had a memorial for that man
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; and he ain't saved yet. But God
[1:46:13] watching. You think God not watching you
[1:46:15] and your selfishness? There's not God
[1:46:16] watching you the behavior. God watching
[1:46:18] you know.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; You think me pastor watching you? Pastor
[1:46:20] don't have them kind of eyes.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; I not watching you. Gal
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; if I watching you get away because I
[1:46:29] ain't seen you. Much time I come here
[1:46:31] and ask me this person said she said
[1:46:34] yes. I say I ain't see them. That person
[1:46:35] say yes I a see them.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I not like they downstairs they upstairs
[1:46:44] and I a see them
[1:46:46] see me play do so sometime.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:46:54] So Paul
[1:46:56] on his way to Damascus a vision directed
[1:46:58] him to Ananas.
[1:47:00] Ananas had the gym.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Paul get knocked out his horse blind
[1:47:05] like a bat
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; and God tell him go by an ass
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; boy.
[1:47:11] What if an ass was contrary and then the
[1:47:13] Holy Ghost
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; that wicked man boy persecuting the
[1:47:18] church and you touching that man?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Nah. God cast on that man to me.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; You see how you have to be different?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; You saw people have to be converted.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; This man, he was Saul
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; persecuting the church.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He is the message. He gets the
[1:47:34] inspiration. Here's the revelation. He
[1:47:35] fighting.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; He was witness to Steven's death.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; That man got flip over. Turn upside
[1:47:42] down. Smoke him out
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; and tell him go ass.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; What if an ass didn't have the Holy
[1:47:49] Ghost?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Just bad behavior. to train that
[1:47:51] behavior but thank God he was not
[1:47:53] trained that natural kind of human he
[1:47:56] had a man filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:58] when I finished with him he received his
[1:48:00] sight and he received the Holy Ghost too
[1:48:02] the Lord I shout what I'm telling you
[1:48:04] you are going to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:48:09] it's a promise
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; but I saw the Lord appear to you in the
[1:48:17] road coming down here
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; where the Lord came to the prophet
[1:48:20] prophet side and said, "He come, he has
[1:48:22] sent me here that I might lay my hands
[1:48:24] upon you that you would be healed and
[1:48:26] receive the Holy Ghost, receive your
[1:48:28] sight." And the scales fell off his
[1:48:30] eyes. He rose and was baptized in the
[1:48:32] name of Jesus Christ. And Paul was going
[1:48:34] to raise up to be one of the mightiest
[1:48:36] prophet, the original prophet in the
[1:48:37] early church.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; No other man stood in Paul's position.
[1:48:43] But yet Paul had to be humble enough to
[1:48:46] go to Annias because that is what God
[1:48:48] want because Anias had the germ. And
[1:48:51] when he received the Holy Ghost, he now
[1:48:53] have germ.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet talk about
[1:48:59] the birth this born again going from
[1:49:00] mouth to mouth.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; From the mouth.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; So the angel directed it. Paul had seen
[1:49:08] him. It takes the spirit of God.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the seed to give it life
[1:49:12] eternal.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Could we continue?
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Good.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; St. John 663.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that quickenth.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; The flesh profitth nothing. The words
[1:49:27] that I speak unto you, they are spirit
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; and they are life.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; So words are not just words.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; So while Peter spake these words, The
[1:49:40] Holy Ghost fell.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Acts 10. Right.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Peter spoke the word and the Holy Spirit
[1:49:46] is the word.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Because Cornelius received the word and
[1:49:51] the seed germ was in Peter.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; So God
[1:49:57] God disguised the Holy Ghost
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; in the form of the word.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it this way.
[1:50:06] Um in the beginning was the word. He
[1:50:09] said, um, what? As many as receive him
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; to them,
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; give he power
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; As many receive who's him? The word
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; to them.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; So the word is spirit also.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; All right. So God hid the Holy Ghost as
[1:50:28] the word. What did the prophet say? The
[1:50:31] secret is
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; the word is in the bride.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; That's where the devil can't touch you
[1:50:37] now. when that word get inside of you.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; The devil can't touch that now.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; It's in the bride. Isn't that right?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; So all these years
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; we have been sowing the Holy Ghost
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; in the form of word promises.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Peter said it this way. By these
[1:50:53] promises you become partakers of his
[1:50:56] divine nature.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; So you come to church to receive promise
[1:50:59] after promise after promise. Afterward
[1:51:01] is inside of you now.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You are jammed with the word.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; You are full with the word. You are
[1:51:07] pregnant with the word. You are pregnant
[1:51:09] with God.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; So watch the real message has been sown
[1:51:16] into you as a seed.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; But Ram says that's why I'm so zealous
[1:51:20] of the seed that I sow. He said he come
[1:51:22] to bring the Bible. The Bible has a
[1:51:24] seed. The entire message is really the
[1:51:25] Bible. Seed form placed inside of you.
[1:51:27] The revealed word. Isn't that right? So
[1:51:29] those that receive the seed, the word,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; the spirit, which is the oil,
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; now you could understand
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; in the parable of the wise and foolish
[1:51:42] virgins why the foolish cannot get the
[1:51:45] oil.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Because they turn down the word
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; that could change into spirit
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; in them.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:59] 1 Corinthians 4:20, the kingdom of God
[1:52:00] is the word made power. I'm still
[1:52:03] reading if you want to put that down.
[1:52:05] What is the kingdom of God? It's within
[1:52:07] you.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; The kingdom in you. And Jesus told them
[1:52:10] say low here, low there, it here, it
[1:52:12] here. He said don't follow them.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; I say that you know.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that you know they say it's
[1:52:17] here. It here come across here.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He said don't bother with that.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; The kingdom is
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; he told his own disciples that.
[1:52:26] Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; But said here now when the word comes in
[1:52:31] here,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; what does this word begin? It turns
[1:52:35] itself into power.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; That is why Jesus knew what he was
[1:52:41] talking about. He knew because when he
[1:52:43] prayed in St. John 17, he said, "Father,
[1:52:45] I have given them thy word.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And to receive it,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; sanctify them by thy truth.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth." So he knew the word
[1:52:52] was in the disciples. Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; So they already had power in them
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; in the form of the word
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; but it will take the spirit
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; to activate.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Activate
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; that was in them.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; So when you get a brand new cell phone
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; and you don't get activated they can't
[1:53:15] make no calls. You know we don't talking
[1:53:16] about WhatsApp. Leave WhatsApp out of
[1:53:18] this.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; We don't Wi-Fi thing. You have to go to
[1:53:22] the company, get it activated
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; for it to be valid. Then other than
[1:53:26] that, you might as well put it block the
[1:53:27] door or something. So like the rest on
[1:53:29] paper or something. It can't do nothing
[1:53:30] then.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; But once it activated, you could make
[1:53:34] calls and you could receive calls.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; So when God activate what's inside of
[1:53:38] you, you could make calls
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; and you can receive calls. We talking
[1:53:43] about horizontal now, vertical now. You
[1:53:46] could call heaven and heaven could call
[1:53:47] you. Okay. The Lord I shout
[1:53:51] Hallelujah. Are you with me this
[1:53:52] morning?
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This activation
[1:53:56] make you be calling vertical.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; They could call up and up could call
[1:54:00] down.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Back in tune.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Because when Adam fell, he said line
[1:54:06] break.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Adam couldn't call and God, you know.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Thorns and thistles and you know
[1:54:12] trouble.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Trouble is serious life.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Old age,
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; back pain,
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; death.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go and work
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; by the sweat of thy brow. All the time
[1:54:23] he speaking the word of God.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Oh it by the sweat of thy brow thou
[1:54:30] shalt eat bread.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Dust thou art. Dust thou art and thou
[1:54:34] shall return.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; There's a sentence in there. You know,
[1:54:39] watch.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; What are you looking for, friend? Now
[1:54:43] they are looking for a kingdom. What is
[1:54:45] the kingdom? It's on earth now. It's a
[1:54:49] spirit. It's the mystical body of Christ
[1:54:52] in there. They come out of Presbyterian,
[1:54:55] Methodist, Pentecost, and everything
[1:54:56] else. They are in this kingdom. They are
[1:54:59] born in there. They come in there by the
[1:55:01] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; And they're in the kingdom. It have
[1:55:05] nothing to do with joining no church
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; and joining. No, they come into the
[1:55:08] kingdom. I don't care what titles they
[1:55:10] have over them. Bapt Baptist, Methodist,
[1:55:12] and whatnot. Or this interpretation,
[1:55:14] that interpretation. The spirit makes us
[1:55:16] brethren. Amen.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Because only one Lord, there's one
[1:55:20] spirit, there's one baptism. Are you
[1:55:21] with me?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; So, how can the foolish virgin get the
[1:55:24] oil when the oil was veiled as seed and
[1:55:28] they fight it and reject it? So then
[1:55:31] when the Holy Ghost begin to baptize the
[1:55:33] people, what can you say? The oil is the
[1:55:36] word.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; So this germ we're talking about now is
[1:55:40] connected to the ministry of Jesus
[1:55:42] Christ. Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; So the ministry of Jesus Christ will be
[1:55:46] that germ, that sea germ in the body
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; that will be given out
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; that will be released.
[1:55:52] So the ministry of Jesus Christ will be
[1:55:54] the seerm and that will actually be in
[1:55:56] the five-fold ministry body.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; And I believe with all my heart we have
[1:56:01] to see evidence of this virtue from
[1:56:03] Christ because Christ had it in him.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; It wasn't temporary. It was permanent.
[1:56:09] And not just permanent, it was resident
[1:56:11] because the woman with the blood issue
[1:56:13] who told herself, if I could just touch
[1:56:14] the hem of his garment and she touched
[1:56:16] his garment, she got whole.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; She was healed. And Jesus said, "I felt
[1:56:21] virtue left me."
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Before he said that, disciples said, he
[1:56:25] said, "Who touched my clothes?"
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; That was his reaction.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Who touched
[1:56:31] my clothes? Disciples said, "Everybody
[1:56:33] touching you." He said, "No, I felt
[1:56:36] virtue. Somebody pull out. Somebody
[1:56:38] withdraw.
[1:56:39] Hallelujah.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; She didn't she didn't have to have a
[1:56:43] long dress. She didn't have to look in
[1:56:45] messages and what not. No. Was that an
[1:56:47] ordinary sinner, a simple person who fed
[1:56:49] up give the doctor all the money and it
[1:56:51] didn't work. It's pressure pressure. Her
[1:56:53] husband telling her don't go to that
[1:56:55] small church. Don't hear that old noise.

[1:56:58] time it dies it. When she wake up in the
[1:57:01] morning, she look in the mirror. She
[1:57:02] said I am going to be healed today. I'm
[1:57:04] getting a breakthrough today. I'm
[1:57:06] getting Holy Ghost today. I'm going to
[1:57:08] be touched today. She told herself. Some
[1:57:11] of you not even talking to God and God
[1:57:13] help me. Help you. You're not talking to
[1:57:15] yourself. Start to talk to yourself now.
[1:57:17] Tell yourself something now. I coming
[1:57:19] for a breakthrough. I coming for
[1:57:21] victory. I coming Hallelujah. to be
[1:57:23] inspire. Don't talk that. Talk to
[1:57:25] yourself. This woman, she told herself
[1:57:28] if I could touch. I know scripture for
[1:57:31] that. You know, she make up your own
[1:57:32] scripture. Okay. The Lord has shout. She
[1:57:34] believe what she said. If I could touch
[1:57:37] his garment.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Not the man.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; She wasn't trying to touch his flesh.
[1:57:44] Not the man.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Just the garment.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; I will remain whole.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And God set it up. No, that's right. The
[1:57:52] him.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Not even the garment. She going to hug
[1:57:54] the man.
[1:57:56] Hallelujah. Glory.

[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. him
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; and God set it up that Jesus was
[1:58:06] standing there all alone and the woman

[1:58:10] Hallelujah. Glory. She touch him and she
[1:58:13] walk by hold and she come to church give
[1:58:14] her a testimony. Saints I was walking I
[1:58:17] see Jesus all by himself.
[1:58:20] And I touched him was made whole that

[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; The bank teller, they have no job to do.

[2:00:58] effect. Oh, glory to God. How many want
[2:01:01] to make a withdrawal this morning? If
[2:01:03] you withdraw, it have an effect. He
[2:01:05] said, "I felt weak. I felt virtue left
[2:01:08] me." But when he took, look at the
[2:01:10] woman. He didn't talk about his virtue.
[2:01:12] He said, "Woman, die faith."
[2:01:20] And why did a prophet man be seated? Why
[2:01:23] did he send Malachi 4? To turn our
[2:01:26] hearts back to the faith of the fathers,
[2:01:28] not to sitting on a bunch of bench and
[2:01:31] and have everything up in your head.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Something have to move in this place,
[2:01:36] man.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Someone to move in this message.
[2:01:47] Got
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; some real intellectual giants in the
[2:01:49] message,
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; not intellectual dwarfs.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; This is Goliath family.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; It's giants.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And put a man and prophesy that David's
[2:02:07] coming. Amen.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Not e David. David's plural.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; They coming for them.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Got them giants strong, you know.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; They big. They bad. They bold. They
[2:02:18] aggressive. They know the word. They
[2:02:20] know the mysteries. They have all kind
[2:02:22] of stuff behind them. You know,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; but they have no power.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; They have no real inspiration.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; God will deal with that.
[2:02:37] Every man-made system will fall.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Every man-made kingdom would fall.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; And this morning, we serve and notice
[2:02:45] the giants.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; To every giant,
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; there's a stone.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; There's a rock.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; We coming to get you. Oh, give the Lord
[2:02:55] some praises. Why? Why we saying that?
[2:02:59] Because these giants pins down the
[2:03:01] church
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; and pin down God's people. That's the
[2:03:05] issue with the giants.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; If you're by yourself and you have your
[2:03:08] giant fellowship and you have your giant
[2:03:10] party and and and weddings and so on,
[2:03:12] that's fine.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; But when the giant
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; have God's people bound,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; that's different.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what David encountered, you
[2:03:21] know,
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; 40 days. That's that's more than a
[2:03:23] month.

[2:03:34] and bad. You a you ain't talking.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Everybody silent.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; And the sharpening sword.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; All right.

[2:03:42] boots.

[2:03:51] going to fight Gol.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; And when David come,
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; They try to belittle him.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Don't let that belitting spirit be upon
[2:04:00] you. You know, be careful. Yeah,
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; they start to be David. What you doing

[2:04:08] going on,
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; right? They're like a TV show for them.
[2:04:12] You know, 40 days, 40 nights, they

[2:04:16] watching TV.

[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; because David didn't understand what's
[2:04:45] going on. David never saw Golad before.
[2:04:47] I know. So David see who is that
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; uncircumcised

[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; But it's over your life. Kings and
[2:09:26] priests unto God and we shall reign on
[2:09:28] the earth. There's a power to strike the
[2:09:30] church. He said when the power of this
[2:09:32] church rises, it will bring the
[2:09:34] brethren. May it rise today. May it rise
[2:09:37] with you. May it rise in your heart.
[2:09:47] Hallelujah.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; To be born of the water and spirit
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; brings us back to the spoken word
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; like it was in John 3.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; To be born of water and spirit. What
[2:10:04] does it do? It bring you right back to
[2:10:06] the place where you should have been
[2:10:07] from the beginning.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go back now in Genesis. Adam was
[2:10:11] to reproduce himself.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; The wife given to him was to reproduce
[2:10:15] another son.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; By spoken word.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; So Adam was supposed to speak into Eve.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; She conceived and another spoken word
[2:10:23] son comes out.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Because of the fall it fell into sex.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; So then it fall now into the human six
[2:10:30] sense five five senses and so on. The
[2:10:33] first teaching Jesus brought was you
[2:10:35] must be born again
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; of the word
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; and the spirit.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was pointing them right back to
[2:10:41] what it was supposed to be in the
[2:10:42] beginning.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; So when you are born again is not of
[2:10:45] your mother,
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; not of your father.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; This is a second birth.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; This is the new birth.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Because the question Nicodemus have, can
[2:10:55] a man enter his mother's womb a second
[2:10:57] time? Amen.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus say, but oh gosh, you in this
[2:11:00] business long time and that's where you
[2:11:01] going to talk.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; How supposed to work?
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; All right, let me read it. Acts John 3.
[2:11:07] There was a man in the Pharisees named
[2:11:08] Nicodemus.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; John 3 chapter one, a ruler of the Jews.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; The same came to Jesus by night, said
[2:11:15] unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou were
[2:11:16] a teacher come from God. For no man can
[2:11:18] do these miracles that thou doest except
[2:11:20] God be with him. And Jesus answers unto
[2:11:23] him, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[2:11:24] except a man be born again, he cannot
[2:11:26] see the kingdom."
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man
[2:11:31] be born when he's old? Can he enter the
[2:11:34] second time in his mother's womb and be
[2:11:35] born?" And Jesus answered, "Verily,
[2:11:38] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[2:11:41] born of the water and of the spirit, he
[2:11:44] cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[2:11:46] That which is born of the flesh is
[2:11:48] flesh. That which is born of the spirit
[2:11:50] is spirit.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; So clearly he is saying you sir are born
[2:11:54] of the flesh.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; The birth I'm talking about is of the
[2:11:57] spirit.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; I'm happy tonight to know that there are
[2:12:05] people that still believe in the blood
[2:12:06] of Christ.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; I do not believe in the social gospel we
[2:12:10] have today.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; These cults going around saying there is
[2:12:13] no such thing as the blood and the Holy
[2:12:16] Spirit. You are not a Christian when you
[2:12:18] do that. You can't be a Christian
[2:12:21] without being born again.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. You can't be no matter
[2:12:25] what you try to pro profess. He said no
[2:12:29] man can say Jesus the Christ only by the
[2:12:31] Holy Ghost.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; If you're just taking what somebody
[2:12:33] said, you're going to be that what
[2:12:35] someone said. You will never know it
[2:12:37] until the Holy Ghost has filled you with
[2:12:39] his presence and witnessed to you that
[2:12:43] he is the Holy Spirit
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; and it is right.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Let's go. You are a time being until you
[2:12:51] are born again.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; That's a big one.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; You are a time being until you are born
[2:12:58] again. then you are eternal being
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; and the only way you can get it is to
[2:13:04] have part of God in you
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; which is eternal life.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. Now remember he didn't
[2:13:11] say you ought to be born again. He said
[2:13:13] you must.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is absolutely you've got
[2:13:17] to do it. Not you ought to. Not you're
[2:13:20] better off if you're dead but you must.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then if it is that essential
[2:13:28] and that great and it's totally
[2:13:30] impossible to enter the kingdom of
[2:13:31] heaven or even see it until we born
[2:13:33] again and so many different
[2:13:35] interpretations of that word born again,
[2:13:37] we ought to seek it out with all our
[2:13:39] hearts to find out what it means.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; So no matter how we try to think we are
[2:13:45] right in saying a creed or joining a
[2:13:47] church, you are still what you were
[2:13:49] until you are born again. Yeah.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; So people joining churches, joining
[2:13:53] groups, changing their beliefs does that
[2:13:55] doesn't mean nothing.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; You are what you are
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; your soul by what's in your heart. Isn't
[2:14:00] that right?
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; So he said now watch until you actually
[2:14:04] born again of the spirit of God. It
[2:14:05] doesn't change you. Your creed joining
[2:14:08] church changing your ideas your good
[2:14:10] intentions as good as it might be is
[2:14:13] still not right. There is something got
[2:14:15] to happen. There's the key here.
[2:14:16] Something have to happen. The new birth
[2:14:18] is an experience. something taking
[2:14:20] place. So it can't just be a hearing the
[2:14:22] word. Something have to happen
[2:14:24] operational in your heart. An
[2:14:27] experimental experience where men get
[2:14:30] right with God. Something happen on the
[2:14:32] inside that nobody can explain. You
[2:14:35] can't explain it. Oh, give the Lord a
[2:14:38] shout. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:40] Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:14:45] Praise God. Praise God.
[2:14:47] There's a song they sing. Something got
[2:14:49] a hold of me. Hallelujah.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Something got a hold of me.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was in that meeting that
[2:14:59] night.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my heart went bright,
[2:15:02] but something got a hold of me. It was
[2:15:06] the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. The Holy
[2:15:09] Ghost. The Holy Ghost. Oh, give the Lord
[2:15:12] a shout. I the message don't want but we
[2:15:16] want it. It's the Holy Ghost.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Something must take place.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Brother Abraham says, "We
[2:15:26] reason we have to be born again is
[2:15:28] because the Bible teaches us that we
[2:15:30] were all born in sin, shaped iniquity,
[2:15:33] come to the world speaking lies." Then
[2:15:35] that shows our nature to begin with is
[2:15:37] sinful to start with.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; So you can't start with you and your
[2:15:40] good behavior. Leave a child on his own,
[2:15:41] the child will go in one direction in
[2:15:43] the world.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you you could be
[2:15:46] pastor pastor child deacon child that
[2:15:48] child doesn't matter
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; because of their nature.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Bible say they born in sin you know.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; So how your children is sin this sin
[2:15:57] that
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; how you think your child is so special
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; that is foolishness.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; How you think you are special so special
[2:16:08] better than who? serious.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; I want to preach something and tell them
[2:16:15] I want you to think there's not
[2:16:17] emotions.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to think through.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; You are better than who? Your children
[2:16:23] or child is better than which child?
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Think about time and chance happen to
[2:16:27] all men.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Time and chance happen to all men.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Then it shows our nature to begin with
[2:16:37] is sinful to start with. We are no good
[2:16:39] to begin with. So we cannot claim
[2:16:42] anything by our shrewdness, our
[2:16:44] sincerity, how great we are or how
[2:16:47] little we are.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; We are all together wrong to begin with.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; We are all together
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; wrong. There is nothing at all we can do
[2:16:58] about it. Jesus said who by taking
[2:17:00] thought can add one cubit to his statue.
[2:17:02] You can think all your thoughts, all
[2:17:03] you're dreaming, read it, study it,
[2:17:05] examine it, everything else. That can't
[2:17:07] help yourself one iota. So just throw it
[2:17:09] all out.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; I have a word for you. Throw it all out.
[2:17:13] I am so glad it does. He said because it
[2:17:15] laid in the thought of knowing something
[2:17:17] smart, we poor illiterate person be left
[2:17:19] out. All right. The churches always make
[2:17:21] it complicated. God makes it simple.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; And I said something I think last
[2:17:26] service. God likes clarity because his
[2:17:30] burden was that his sea is so
[2:17:31] mysterious. He want to know how to
[2:17:33] reveal himself.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; So therefore say God revealed himself in
[2:17:36] simplicity.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; So God is interested in clarity even
[2:17:40] till two habac right the vision and make
[2:17:43] it plain
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; not make it complex. So as we get nearer
[2:17:47] to the coming of the Lord it's supposed
[2:17:48] to be simpler
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; less complex
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; because we getting nearer to love
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; and love doesn't make you act a little
[2:17:54] stupidy you know.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I say stupid in the sense of
[2:17:57] when brother Brandon faced the bull, he
[2:18:00] spoke to the bull.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Who speaks to the bull?
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Not madness. Can you say bull between
[2:18:08] the vials and the woos and the trumpets
[2:18:10] and the sixth trumpet and the seventh
[2:18:11] trumpet just between have something
[2:18:12] inside of there and the six v
[2:18:15] six seed and seven seed.
[2:18:19] If he had told her to the bull, the bull
[2:18:21] lick him up and
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; he forget to kill a bull.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Walking through the field, he forget his
[2:18:28] gun. He said if he had the gun, he shoot
[2:18:30] the bull, pay for the bull, no problem.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; There's a there's logic.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Pow.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Not kill a bull. You know, I killed the
[2:18:39] bull.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; But something came over him
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; and love take a hold upon him. He had no
[2:18:46] fear for the bull and the bull snorting
[2:18:48] coming for him.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Bull, I'm a servant of Jesus
[2:18:51] Christ. I'm passing through the field to
[2:18:53] pray to pray for some man that's sick."
[2:18:54] He said, "I didn't mean to disturb you.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Go back and lie down."
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Now, when he said go back and lie down,
[2:19:02] the bull was on his way.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the bull saying all right. You
[2:19:08] know that, you know, the bull was
[2:19:10] already charging heading down for the
[2:19:12] prophet. No, it screech. It match breaks
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; and then turn around. I'm going to lie
[2:19:17] down.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "I wish this could happen
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; all the time."
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; So it means that same veil that Adam
[2:19:29] had, that Eve had before the fall, that
[2:19:32] anointing, that covering, that cover
[2:19:34] your imagination, your conscience, your
[2:19:35] memory, your affection, your reasoning,
[2:19:37] that Holy Ghost. Hey.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That that's coming back.
[2:19:42] That is coming back.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; That is coming back.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; So if if you in your senses, you ain't
[2:19:55] talking to no bull.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Because humans don't talk to bull.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; That's what it looks like. But when you
[2:20:02] go back to the garden of Eden, when you
[2:20:04] see where God tell Adam have dominion
[2:20:07] over cattle and the beast, Adam could
[2:20:10] tell the B move so so so all your head.
[2:20:12] So
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; mountain move so he was in speaking
[2:20:15] terms and he had the spoken word and
[2:20:18] that's why Jesus could say if you shall
[2:20:19] say to this mountain sin mark and don't
[2:20:22] doubt in your heart you can have what
[2:20:23] you say
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; because he know we are sons. Notice the
[2:20:27] angels are servants but we are sons. The
[2:20:30] angel directed Philillip, but Philillip
[2:20:32] had the germ.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; God called you. You are sons. Angels are
[2:20:36] here to assist you.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:20:40] Give the Lord a praise.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Amen.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; So, watch.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; I love this one.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Now, no man could save the other.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's one B. It makes no
[2:21:01] difference what anyone's tried to say.
[2:21:05] No man can save another no matter how
[2:21:08] smart what his office is. Let him be a
[2:21:12] pastor, priest, bishop, cardinal or
[2:21:16] pope. He cannot have one thing to do
[2:21:19] with savings any man's life because he's
[2:21:23] a sinner himself.
[2:21:32] So all these message popes who think you
[2:21:34] know Simon the sorcerer thought he was a
[2:21:35] very great man.
[2:21:38] Bible said that you know Simon the
[2:21:40] sorcerer this man doing magic voodoo
[2:21:43] obia wherever they have necromancy
[2:21:45] whatever they have now whatever they
[2:21:46] call witchcraft
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; and he joined the church
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; he get baptized
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; he get baptized in her
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; and when he saw the power demonstrated
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; he say how I getting that
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; he offer money
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; he was willing to pay because he wanted
[2:22:05] to Stay great.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; He was an image consultant. He was an
[2:22:08] image man.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; He want to keep that great image.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; He doing magic. Now he that kind of
[2:22:16] magic power that I don't have
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; God judged that foolishness in
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; because he wanted to continue his
[2:22:23] foolishness in the church.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; So we got to keep our eye out for for
[2:22:28] Simon the sorcerer.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; All you laugh.
[2:22:37] That's the book of acts here.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; We still in the book of acts now.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; There's going to be another book of
[2:22:42] acts.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; So you have to expect analysis of
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; you can expect dynamics. You can expect
[2:22:47] ton of the sorcerer. You can the whole
[2:22:49] gamut of the book of acts you know but
[2:22:51] we going to write the this will be a
[2:22:53] continuation of the book of acts.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; All right. What? So regardless of the
[2:22:58] office a man holds be it pastor, priest,
[2:23:01] bishop, cardinal or pope, he cannot have
[2:23:03] one thing to do with man's s in life
[2:23:05] because he's a sinner to begin with.
[2:23:06] Born in sin and shaping iniquity come
[2:23:09] speaking lies. He's a liar to begin with
[2:23:11] and any word that he would be a lie if
[2:23:14] it's contrary to God's word and plan.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Here we go. If the Virgin Mary
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; had to go in the upper room
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; and stay there
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; till she was filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:23:25] in such a way till she staggered like a
[2:23:28] woman that was drunk
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; under strong drink.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; How are you going to get in anything
[2:23:32] less than that? Yeah.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Now this Mary mind you the same Mary
[2:23:36] that say turn unto me according
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; years ago I was telling us about the
[2:23:41] Holy Ghost not the church and she tell
[2:23:43] me about Mary say word I say that Mary
[2:23:46] upper room she said I never thought
[2:23:48] about that
[2:23:50] you see it's cool to say word
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; it done no experience no fire no nothing
[2:23:59] bride
[2:24:00] ghost without sensation
[2:24:04] But Mary has to go in the upper room.
[2:24:06] Hear what the prophet says here.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; The reason Mary had to go in the day up
[2:24:11] at the day of Pentecost and receive the
[2:24:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost just like the
[2:24:14] rest of them did is because she was born
[2:24:17] here as a mortal
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; and had to be born again before she
[2:24:23] could go to heaven
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; and she give birth to Jesus.
[2:24:29] So our humanness cannot make it.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Our effort cannot make it.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Our righteousness is as filthy rags. So
[2:24:36] we cannot present ourselves. We have to
[2:24:38] present the blood sacrifice
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; that Christ has died for us.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; And that blood is what is speaking on
[2:24:44] our behalf.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; To give us the victory over the world
[2:24:47] and over sin and over everything else.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Could we say amen?
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; To be born of the spirit. Here we go.
[2:24:56] is to believe and obey the teaching of
[2:24:58] the Bible
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; And a man that is born of the spirit
[2:25:03] will obey God's word regardless of what
[2:25:06] traditions tell him.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; What to be born means to be birthed from
[2:25:10] above.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; And then that kingdom is so much higher
[2:25:14] than this kingdom.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; To be born of the spirit is to believe
[2:25:18] and behave yourself in the spirit. is to
[2:25:21] understand and believe with your heart
[2:25:23] that Jesus is the Christ and this is the
[2:25:25] word
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; and no other words can be added to it or
[2:25:27] taken from it without your name taken
[2:25:29] out of the book of life. That's a strong
[2:25:31] one. Born again means birthe it from
[2:25:33] above.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; So your vibes, the atmosphere you live
[2:25:37] in is from above.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; So when Bar is on the platform and he's
[2:25:41] praying for the sick people and you see
[2:25:42] a man come up there
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; and he said you're not here for
[2:25:47] sickness. He said, "You're a preacher.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; You're a Christian.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; You here for revival."
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; What what what what is he picking up?
[2:25:55] What what what is the discernment of
[2:25:56] that?
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; The man's spirit.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; So I like to say this way. Somebody's
[2:26:01] spirit, let's say it is like colors
[2:26:03] then. So if you're dishonest, that have
[2:26:06] a color vibration.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; If you're insincere, that have a color
[2:26:10] vibration with it.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; And somebody in the spirit could see
[2:26:13] that see see it. And if you're clear and
[2:26:16] honest, that that also vibrates.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; So people actually walk with
[2:26:20] atmospheres.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet said there
[2:26:23] some people you don't want to be around
[2:26:24] them at all
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; just because of the atmosphere that's
[2:26:27] around them.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; So you could create the atmosphere you
[2:26:30] want around your life.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; By the things you say, by how you live,
[2:26:35] by what you think, by what you speak,
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; it create a certain atmosphere.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Do you want that?
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Remember we born with a certain nature.
[2:26:42] You know,
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; so you may want you may have a lot of
[2:26:45] temper. You might be a temper fighting a
[2:26:47] bus show and whatnot. But that don't
[2:26:48] mean that you evil or wicked. You know
[2:26:50] that just how your nature is.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Our next person might be very impatient.
[2:26:53] They can't they can't wait. They blow
[2:26:56] the top if somebody come late or
[2:26:57] something. So our next person So all of
[2:26:59] us have different qualities, different
[2:27:00] things. But all of us need help from the
[2:27:02] Holy Ghost.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Say sweet your temper with prayer.
[2:27:10] Sometime your grandfather had it, your
[2:27:11] great grandfather something passed down.
[2:27:12] I don't know how it does work but it is
[2:27:14] passed down
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; but you want to have the right attitude
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; because you want your breakthrough. And
[2:27:21] if you see all kind of contrary take
[2:27:22] passing down. You see how it stop right
[2:27:23] here? You know
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; you don't want to pass it down any
[2:27:25] further and stop right here. You know
[2:27:26] you kill it.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; You said this d right here. So
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; all right.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; So I trust you blessed this morning.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; I ain't finished yet. You know
[2:27:38] I'm feeling strong like a
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; I feel like a good two three four hours
[2:27:42] right now. They say woo
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; I'm to the pastor today boy.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to dismiss already? Are
[2:27:48] you ready yet? I am so relaxed this
[2:27:51] morning.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you for your prayer.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Some
[2:27:56] it means that you're praying for me. All
[2:27:58] right let's go.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Watch this here now. What is the seed of
[2:28:02] life? The word of God. His word is a
[2:28:05] seed.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Here we go. And his spirit is the water.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word of God. And he was
[2:28:11] busted open that life. The life is
[2:28:14] inside the seed. And this life which is
[2:28:16] spirit, water flowing over the spirit
[2:28:19] over the seed of God will bring forth
[2:28:21] the life of the seed. Isn't that right?
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; He Jesus was the seed that Eve should
[2:28:27] have produced. So he was that seed and
[2:28:31] the only way life could be in the
[2:28:34] reproduction of life had to come through
[2:28:36] that seed. That seed had to die in order
[2:28:41] to spread out the life.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; So that is why come back to the
[2:28:44] scripture we read Jesus said out of his
[2:28:46] belly shall flow rivers of living water.
[2:28:50] This spake he of the spirit
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; that they would receive because the Holy
[2:28:55] Ghost was not yet given.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was not yet glorified. For
[2:28:59] him to be glorified, he have to go and
[2:29:01] die.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; And when he die, the spirit released and
[2:29:04] that was the beginning of the end of
[2:29:06] Satan.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Because once his spirit is released, he
[2:29:09] going to pick up the seeds upon the
[2:29:11] earth.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; Which is you
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; that was hidden
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; under darkness.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh God have
[2:29:17] mercy to. Do you get that now?
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When darkness covered
[2:29:21] the earth, God's darkness and and and
[2:29:23] darkness was upon the face of the deep,
[2:29:25] the spirit of God moved upon the waters.
[2:29:26] And God said, "Let there be light."
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; But the sea was already under there.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the sea was already
[2:29:32] there?
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let there be light." The
[2:29:33] light break forth so the sea could come
[2:29:35] forth. So God put you in Laia. God put
[2:29:38] you in this world. God put you under
[2:29:40] darkness. And this message come with
[2:29:42] even light. Let there be light. And here
[2:29:45] you are. You are going to come forward.
[2:29:48] Give the Lord some praising.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Glory. Oh, we on your home stretch.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; Let me So, um I'm now on page 12. Uh 15
[2:30:01] pages. So, just pages.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; The reason that God manifested himself
[2:30:08] so perfectly in Jesus is because he was
[2:30:10] the seed word. All right.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; The germ word itself, the germ that was
[2:30:16] inside the seed and the life in the
[2:30:18] seed. He was the germ word of God. So
[2:30:21] Jesus had to be broken open in order for
[2:30:24] that seed to let forth his life to water
[2:30:28] other seed that was coming.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. So he just
[2:30:33] died on Calvary for my sins. He died to
[2:30:35] release the spirit. This spirit that you
[2:30:38] are to receive.
[2:30:41] Hallelujah.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; Watch. He said, watch.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; In order for that seed to let forth his
[2:30:48] life to water other seeds coming even he
[2:30:50] said other sheep I have of this fool.
[2:30:52] This they were going to see that they
[2:30:54] are going to get that word and say right
[2:30:56] with it and I'm sending forth my spirit
[2:30:58] to water it.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; All God sons must be the same.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; To be born of the word and the spirit
[2:31:07] brings us back to the spoken word again.
[2:31:09] Almost done. What was he? He became a
[2:31:11] man. God made flesh dwell among us.
[2:31:13] Isn't that right? And washed by the and
[2:31:15] then in him dwelt in him. There come the
[2:31:18] life of God manifesting himself through
[2:31:21] Christ. God was in Christ. The anointed
[2:31:24] one. Christ being the anointed one. A
[2:31:26] man that was anointed. God dwelling in
[2:31:28] him. What was it? Here we go. The germ
[2:31:32] with the flesh.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; The anointed one. Hallelujah.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Flesh
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; being anointed
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; with the spirit of God
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; produced the word of God made manifest.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; So when you say the spirit is upon me
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; because he had anointed me.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; He being that germ word,
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the spirit,
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; he was full of the Holy Ghost.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; He had the fullness of God dwelt in him
[2:31:59] bodily.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; He had the whole thing.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Then the Holy Spirit
[2:32:05] was in him
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; come down to water the word to make it
[2:32:09] grow. What is it? God manifesting
[2:32:13] continuing the work of his first son,
[2:32:16] his only begotten and died for our high
[2:32:19] breeding life that he might reconcile us
[2:32:21] back to be sons of daughters of God that
[2:32:24] through the church. Here we go. Might
[2:32:26] flow the same life.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; By the word continue to work and
[2:32:31] manifested in Christ. The Bible has got
[2:32:34] to be in you. The word is a seed. As
[2:32:36] long as it's laying here, it won't do
[2:32:38] nothing. But when it comes into here,
[2:32:41] when it comes into the heart, it begins
[2:32:43] to manifest by the Holy Spirit. The
[2:32:46] works of God, then vision comes, then
[2:32:49] power comes, then humility comes. All
[2:32:51] you know it all is gone. You become
[2:32:53] nothing. Christ becomes alive. You die.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; And he lives.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; There it is. Cuz he died, I live. When I
[2:33:02] die, he lives again. When I die, he
[2:33:04] promised me life. And I died out of
[2:33:07] myself in order that I can have life.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Almost done. So then you
[2:33:13] watch. So the Bible is manifested again
[2:33:15] like in the early days of Christ. Cuz
[2:33:17] you are a predestinated seed just like
[2:33:21] Christ was.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Just like Christ was. Just like Christ
[2:33:24] was. You are today a predestinated seed.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Here we go. Are you ready? Oh my. He
[2:33:32] said now though these disciples were
[2:33:35] predestinated seed and they hauled
[2:33:37] themselves up.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; In the upper room,
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; these seeds,
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; the word was laying there without life
[2:33:44] in it. That's right.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Remember earlier we talked about the
[2:33:50] kingdom. The word turned into power and
[2:33:51] spirit.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Mission come please.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Remember that.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Here he said the disciples had the word
[2:33:57] in them
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; laying in them without life. And watch
[2:34:01] something. And all of a sudden, here
[2:34:03] come a sound from heaven.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; As the waters begin to gush down, it
[2:34:08] actually fill all the house where they
[2:34:10] were sitting and the seeds begin to
[2:34:12] grow. It begin to manifest itself.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; So I am seeing how the birth is coming
[2:34:16] now.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; The seed can only come through the body.
[2:34:20] I'm closing.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1 11-14. in whom also we
[2:34:25] obtain an inheritance, being
[2:34:27] predestinated according to the purpose
[2:34:29] of him who workketh all things after the
[2:34:31] counsel of his own will. That we who
[2:34:33] should who who we should be to the
[2:34:35] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[2:34:37] Christ in whom you also trusted. Here we
[2:34:40] go. After you heard the word of truth,
[2:34:43] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[2:34:45] also after you believed, you were sealed
[2:34:49] with that Holy Spirit of promise.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not when you believe. After
[2:34:52] you believe, God put the seal upon you.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; That seal of the Holy Spirit promised,
[2:34:57] which is the earnest of inheritance
[2:34:59] until the redemption of the purch
[2:35:01] possession,
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; unto the praise of his glory.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; I'm finished.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; And I want to close off.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; With this story from Cornelius.
[2:35:09] And I'm going to read first Acts 1:2 and
[2:35:11] then go down to 21. Let's read it
[2:35:13] quickly and we're going to close. There
[2:35:15] was a certain man in Cesarian named
[2:35:16] Cornelius,
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; a centurion of the band called the
[2:35:19] Italian band.
[2:35:22] description of this man.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; A devout man.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; One that feared God.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; With all his house.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Which give much arms to the people and
[2:35:34] pray to God always.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Acts 10:21. So we find out this is what
[2:35:40] we want to get to to be like him.
[2:35:44] just
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; devout,
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; giving, praying always,
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; fear God.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; That is the atmosphere that Cornelius
[2:35:55] was in.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; God tell him send for Peter.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; The angel dealing with Peter to go to
[2:36:02] Cornelius's house.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; Now watch how this match now the
[2:36:07] condition. Cornelius is not rotten in
[2:36:09] spirit. He means the devil getting
[2:36:12] trouble. He carrying any cussing. No,
[2:36:13] no. Just devout, worshshiping,
[2:36:18] freegiver, helpful, a man who have a
[2:36:22] testimony. That's the man who sent for
[2:36:24] Peter.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; Begin to close.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; Peter
[2:36:29] went down to the men which was sent unto
[2:36:30] him for Cornelius. Behold, I am he whom
[2:36:32] you seek. They said, Cornelius, he had
[2:36:34] the testimony. A centurion, a just man,
[2:36:37] not so church member, you know, not no
[2:36:39] man told in Bible. He's a centurion, a
[2:36:42] just man, one that feared of God, of
[2:36:45] good report among all the nation of the
[2:36:46] Jews, was warned from God by holy angel
[2:36:49] to send foreign to his house and to hear
[2:36:51] words of thee. Then call ye him, lodged
[2:36:55] them, and on the more Peter went. And
[2:36:57] what Peter took him up and saying, okay,
[2:36:59] I'll skip down. Let me go down there.
[2:37:02] Verse 30. And Cornelius said, four days
[2:37:05] ago, I was fasting. All right.
[2:37:10] He say I want to do church fasting this
[2:37:12] week.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; his fasting was personal.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; His fasting because he want to seek God.
[2:37:20] He want to hear from God. He didn't know
[2:37:22] God yet, but he is fasting.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I
[2:37:28] was fasting until this hour. And the
[2:37:29] ninth hour I prayed in my house, and
[2:37:31] behold, a man stood before me a bright
[2:37:33] clothing and said, Cornelius, thy
[2:37:35] prayers heard. that arms uh had a
[2:37:39] remembrance in the sight of God. His
[2:37:41] giving was remembered by God. God
[2:37:44] recognized the heart of that man.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Let's go. All right. Send unto Japa.
[2:37:50] Call Simon whose name is Peter. He
[2:37:52] lodged in the house. And immediately I
[2:37:54] sent for thee and is well done that thou
[2:37:56] would come. Now therefore we are present
[2:37:59] before God to hear all things that are
[2:38:01] commanded of thee of God. Then Peter
[2:38:03] opened his mouth and said, "Of a truth,
[2:38:06] I perceive that God is no respector of
[2:38:07] persons, but in every nation, he that
[2:38:10] feared him and worketh righteousness is
[2:38:11] accepted with him. The word which God
[2:38:13] sent in his children." And he began to
[2:38:15] preach how God anointed Jesus with the
[2:38:17] Holy Ghost from with power went about
[2:38:19] doing good and healing all that
[2:38:21] oppressed the devil. And we are witness
[2:38:23] of these things. And they slew him, hang
[2:38:25] him on the tree, and God raised him on
[2:38:27] the third day and whatnot. And he
[2:38:28] commanded us to preach the gospel to him
[2:38:31] gave all the prophet witness. And while
[2:38:33] Peter spake these words, the Holy Ghost
[2:38:36] fell on them that heard the word. And
[2:38:38] they that of the circumcision which
[2:38:40] believe were astonished as many as came
[2:38:42] of Peter because on the Gentiles was
[2:38:44] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:38:47] And I'm saying to you today from this
[2:38:48] day go forward expect come believing
[2:38:51] that God will pour it upon you the Holy
[2:38:54] Ghost because you heard the word you
[2:38:56] received the word and God going to fill
[2:38:58] you with the Holy Ghost. Oh blessed be
[2:39:00] the name of the Lord. Oh give the Lord
[2:39:02] some praise. Could we stand? Hallelujah.
[2:39:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:39:07] Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:39:11] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Praise
[2:39:14] God. Praise God. Praise God. Brother
[2:39:17] Kelly, share something with me. He said
[2:39:19] this message called the unpardonable
[2:39:20] sin. I don't believe there's any man or
[2:39:22] woman could ever face Jesus Christ and
[2:39:24] truly repent of their sins with a true
[2:39:27] full surrendered heart saying, "Lord, I
[2:39:29] truly believe. But what God would place
[2:39:32] on them, the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:34] right at that time, let's bow our heads.
[2:39:35] Heavenly Father, I've preached your
[2:39:36] word. I've shared what I believe you put
[2:39:38] upon my heart to share with your people.
[2:39:40] Now deal with them, Father, and fill
[2:39:42] them with your presence. fill them with
[2:39:43] your presence and we baptize their souls
[2:39:45] with the Holy Ghost. I commit them into
[2:39:47] your hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[2:39:50] Amen. God bless you. Thanks again for
[2:39:51] being here. Why don't you turn around
[2:39:52] and shake somebody hands as brother
[2:39:54] Jason come and sing songs.
[2:40:05] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:40:13] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:40:21] For every breath that I am in
[2:40:27] I will sing
[2:40:29] of the goodness
[2:40:31] of God.
[2:40:34] I love you all.
[2:40:39] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:40:44] All my days
[2:40:46] have been held in your hands.
[2:40:51] From the moment that I wake up
[2:40:55] until I lay my head.
[2:40:59] Oh, I will sing
[2:41:01] of the goodness
[2:41:03] of God.
[2:41:08] And all my life you have been free.
[2:41:13] Hallelujah.
[2:41:16] Oh, all my life you have been so so
[2:41:20] good.
[2:41:23] With every breath that I am,
[2:41:29] I will sing
[2:41:31] of timidness.
[2:41:34] I love your voice.
[2:41:36] I love your voice. Have led me through
[2:41:39] the fire. For you have led me through
[2:41:42] the fire.
[2:41:46] In darkest night,
[2:41:48] you are close like no other.
[2:41:53] I knew you were the father.
[2:41:57] I've known you as a friend.
[2:42:00] And I have lived in the goodness of God.
[2:42:10] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:42:16] Hallelujah. For all my life, you have
[2:42:19] been so so good.
[2:42:25] Every breath that I am able
[2:42:30] and I will sing of the goodness of God.
[2:42:35] Just one more time.
[2:42:37] Oh,
[2:42:39] all my life you have been.
[2:42:44] All of my life. For all my life, you
[2:42:48] have been so so good.
[2:42:54] Everywhere that I am able.
[2:42:59] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:43:04] of God.
[2:43:07] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:43:11] of God. I will sing. I will sing
[2:43:16] of the goodness
[2:43:19] of God.

[2:51:30] brother OIT said as he was speaking
[2:51:31] during the service, he said you have to
[2:51:33] go listen to it again. There is so much
[2:51:36] that was said this morning. And God
[2:51:37] bless you, brother O. May God strengthen
[2:51:39] you. May he anoint you,
[2:51:42] continue to use you, and we pray that

[2:51:51] from Sister Stephanie Knights. Greetings
[2:51:53] in the precious name of the Lord. I want
[2:51:55] to thank God for our safe return and for

[2:51:59] Happy new year to all and may God richly
[2:52:01] bless you. So, welcome back. May God

[2:52:06] We do have two prayer requests. One from
[2:52:09] sister Anmarie Steel. I would like that
[2:52:11] you can pray for my granddaughter
[2:52:13] Zaniah. I believe she has fallen under
[2:52:15] the sickness of constant fever,
[2:52:17] headache, and other medical problems.
[2:52:19] And I would like for you to pray that
[2:52:21] she would get better. And we also want
[2:52:24] to uh remember, please pray for my dad
[2:52:28] Andy DDA. He is a dialysis patient and
[2:52:32] has developed an infection. We are
[2:52:34] trusting God for complete healing and
[2:52:36] strength. from Sister Abigail uh DDA
[2:52:39] Harry. So, we want to remember them in
[2:52:40] prayer. And if there's anyone this
[2:52:42] morning that you want to show by raising
[2:52:44] your hands as we approach the throne of
[2:52:45] grace this morning, you know, as brother
[2:52:48] preached, that woman uh who wanted to
[2:52:52] touch the hem of his garment, you know.
[2:52:54] So, if you have a need this morning and
[2:52:56] you want to make a withdrawal this
[2:52:58] morning and you want to raise your
[2:52:59] hands, you might be here in the
[2:53:01] sanctuary downstairs on the live stream
[2:53:05] or even if you're watching this tape
[2:53:06] after the fact as we approach the throne
[2:53:09] of grace this morning. Our gracious
[2:53:11] heavenly father, we thank you this
[2:53:12] morning for words of eternal life and
[2:53:14] how it quickened our hearts Lord to be
[2:53:16] reminded Lord of who we are and who's we
[2:53:20] are and the promise that belongs to us
[2:53:21] and the requirements for us and Lord the
[2:53:24] great divine purpose that you express
[2:53:26] through your word and father that you
[2:53:28] send this great Elijah prophet to ensure
[2:53:31] that we could see in the word what's
[2:53:33] applicable for our day our time our
[2:53:35] season and how you use your manservant
[2:53:37] our pastor to Lord bring a present tense
[2:53:40] reality of spiritual food in due season.
[2:53:42] Lord, our hearts are truly burning
[2:53:44] within us and rejoicing to see Lord the
[2:53:47] unfolding of every promise in the word
[2:53:49] and to see the signs and the times and
[2:53:51] all these things and we have stood
[2:53:53] behind this sacred desk so many times
[2:53:55] and brought Lord prayer requests to you
[2:53:57] and time and time again we have seen
[2:53:59] your healing touch. We have seen your
[2:54:01] miracle working power. We have seen
[2:54:03] prayer requests become notes of praises,
[2:54:06] Father. And Lord, we want to bring Lord
[2:54:08] Zaniah before you, Father. Lord, under
[2:54:11] this sickness of fever and headache and
[2:54:13] all these medical problems. And Lord,
[2:54:15] there's no medical problem you cannot
[2:54:17] handle. There's no sickness you cannot
[2:54:19] deal with. And Lord, there are so many
[2:54:21] others struggling with these same
[2:54:22] symptoms. Lord, we pray there God for a
[2:54:25] complete and total healing in the mighty
[2:54:27] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, Lord, not
[2:54:29] just for her, but for everyone else with
[2:54:31] these same symptoms, these same issues,
[2:54:33] these same challenges, Satan, the blood
[2:54:36] of Jesus is against you. We apply the
[2:54:38] blood. We plead the blood. We make a
[2:54:41] withdrawal this morning, knowing who we
[2:54:43] are, knowing that the there's power in
[2:54:45] the church of the living God, over every
[2:54:47] sickness, over every disease, Father. So
[2:54:50] Lord, may this request come back as a
[2:54:52] note of praise and for Lord Andy DDA,
[2:54:55] Father. Lord, coming down with an
[2:54:56] infection, Lord, with the dialysis
[2:54:59] condition is an infection on top of a
[2:55:01] problem that's already there, but
[2:55:03] Father, we plead the blood this morning.
[2:55:05] And we say, Father, not just deal with
[2:55:07] the infection, but the very reason for
[2:55:09] dialysis in the first place. Lord, you
[2:55:12] are a miracle working God. You are still
[2:55:15] a mighty healer. You are still Jehovah
[2:55:17] Gyra, Jehovah Rafa, Jehovah Ni, you are
[2:55:20] still El Shai. You are still the
[2:55:22] everpresent help in time of trouble in
[2:55:25] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Lord,
[2:55:27] may we find Diddy wherever he is. And
[2:55:30] may the angel of the Lord move into that
[2:55:32] room, Father, and touch and heal from
[2:55:35] the crown of his head to the soles of
[2:55:36] his feet. And for Father, every request
[2:55:38] that was raised here this morning, every
[2:55:41] hand that was raised this morning, every
[2:55:43] plea, every cry, whatever it might be,
[2:55:46] be it physical, mental, financial,
[2:55:48] family, situation, there's nothing you
[2:55:51] cannot handle. We bring your people
[2:55:53] before you. We bring every request
[2:55:55] before you. We say, Father, may you do a
[2:55:58] work upon your people, Father. May you
[2:56:00] touch each brother, touch each sister,
[2:56:02] touch those that are here, touch those
[2:56:04] that are connected online, touch those
[2:56:06] that would watch the tape. May you bring
[2:56:08] strength back to Lord, your son and
[2:56:10] servant, our pastor, brother over this
[2:56:12] morning. May you touch him with the
[2:56:13] crown of his head to the soul of his
[2:56:15] feet. May you bless his wife, Lord. May
[2:56:17] you bless the ministers. May you bless
[2:56:19] the elders, the deacons, the ushers, the
[2:56:21] trustees, the musicians, the technical

[2:56:26] hospitality, parking, every ministry,
[2:56:29] every office, every help, every
[2:56:31] government. We hand the church to you,
[2:56:33] Father. May you have your perfect way
[2:56:35] upon your people. And may you bring us
[2:56:37] back at the appointed time, Father, in
[2:56:39] the mighty precious name of Jesus
[2:56:41] Christ, Father. Lord, may you be with
[2:56:43] your people in the name of the Lord
[2:56:45] Jesus Christ. And the church says,

[2:58:56] there are many who would be blessed by
[2:58:58] it as well. there. It is not a question
[2:59:00] and answer on a specific topic. It is if
[2:59:02] you have a question and answer on your
[2:59:04] heart, we cannot guarantee we'll get to
[2:59:06] answer every single question. But we do
[2:59:09] want to have a pulse and certainly um an
[2:59:12] understanding or a means to be able to
[2:59:14] help you along the journey. The Bible
[2:59:16] says to be ready to give an answer, you
[2:59:18] know, and if there's a question, brother
[2:59:20] Brandham himself had many services that
[2:59:23] were around questions and answers so he
[2:59:25] could help the people along the journey.
[2:59:27] So we did this some time ago and we want
[2:59:29] to be able to have another session
[2:59:31] again. So the last Sunday of this month
[2:59:33] we have dedicated to having a special
[2:59:36] question and answer service. So if you
[2:59:37] have a question on your heart um we have
[2:59:39] also made it easy. You don't need to put
[2:59:42] your name. You don't need to come and
[2:59:44] and disclose it directly. There's a box
[2:59:46] downstairs. Uh it currently says
[2:59:49] suggestion box. Um don't be stumbled by
[2:59:52] that. It is the question and answer box.
[2:59:54] All right. So feel free to write your
[2:59:57] question and submit it anonymously. Um
[3:00:00] you can start doing that as early
[3:00:01] yesterday and certainly next Sunday as
[3:00:04] well so that during the course of uh
[3:00:06] next week Lord willing we'll prepare the
[3:00:08] responses and by the grace of God have a
[3:00:10] time where we could um help the church
[3:00:12] along that way. Um in keeping with that
[3:00:15] as well on that day we are trying to put
[3:00:17] together a very small refreshment
[3:00:19] package for those who would be
[3:00:21] interested in that type of refreshment.
[3:00:23] a very nominal cost of $25. Um so if
[3:00:26] you're interested in um participating in
[3:00:29] that refreshment activity, we'd ask you
[3:00:31] to reregister so we could make
[3:00:32] provisions. Alternatively, you are free
[3:00:34] to walk with your own refreshment if if
[3:00:36] that's the case. Um but we certainly
[3:00:38] want to have the option available to you
[3:00:40] um if you want to participate in that as
[3:00:42] well. Um again, it is open to the entire
[3:00:45] church and we believe and trust it'll be
[3:00:48] a blessing to the entire church um with
[3:00:50] a focus on the young people uh in
[3:00:53] particular as well. So we trust that
[3:00:55] that communicates that clearly. We'd
[3:00:57] have sent this out via the WhatsApp
[3:00:59] group, but this just brings a bit more
[3:01:01] clarity and a bit more focus uh upon it
[3:01:05] as well. Um let me just check something
[3:01:09] here.
[3:01:11] Okay. So, those are the main ones. So,
[3:01:13] in addition, we'd ask ROI and myself,
[3:01:15] we're asking you to remember us in
[3:01:17] prayer um during the course of this
[3:01:19] week. Uh he'll be traveling to the US.
[3:01:22] And I'm heading over to Nigeria. So,
[3:01:24] remember us in prayer um as we enter
[3:01:27] this new year uh trusting the Lord to
[3:01:29] take care of his people and his purpose
[3:01:32] and his plan. Remember us uh in prayer
[3:01:35] as well. and maintenance team group
[3:01:38] three is carded to serve today. Please
[3:01:41] meet with mother Andy Henry after the
[3:01:44] service and next week uh Lord willing
[3:01:46] group five is carded to serve which is
[3:01:49] uh brother Blackman's group is carded to
[3:01:52] serve. I also have a a note here if we
[3:01:55] just want to go back to prayer one more
[3:01:56] time. Brother Anthony O'Brien is not
[3:01:58] feeling well. So we want to remember him
[3:01:59] in prayer. Let's just bow our heads one
[3:02:02] more time. Heavenly Father, we want to
[3:02:04] remember your servant, brother Anthony,
[3:02:06] at this time, Lord. Lord, not feeling
[3:02:09] well and praying that the angel of the
[3:02:10] Lord would meet him at the point of his
[3:02:12] need and touch your servant completely
[3:02:15] from the crown of his head to the soles
[3:02:16] of his feet, Father. May you restore his
[3:02:19] strength. May you, Lord, bring a speedy
[3:02:21] recovery, Father. And Lord, we commit,
[3:02:24] Lord, him completely into your hands in
[3:02:26] the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:02:29] And amen. So, I believe I have
[3:02:31] everything covered. So, just one more
[3:02:33] time, uh, service will be a live stream
[3:02:35] service only this coming Wednesday.
[3:02:37] There'll be no service this coming
[3:02:39] Friday. Next Sunday, Lord willing, after
[3:02:41] the service, there'll be a baptism
[3:02:43] service. We already have one candidate
[3:02:46] scheduled. If you are interested in
[3:02:47] being baptized, speak with one of the
[3:02:49] deacons or the elders and we'll uh work
[3:02:52] towards facilitating that. And then the
[3:02:54] last Sunday of this month, special
[3:02:56] question and answer service. Uh we
[3:02:58] invite you to submit your questions
[3:03:00] anonymously in the suggestion box
[3:03:02] downstairs. And if you are interested in
[3:03:04] participating in the refreshments that
[3:03:06] will be made available, the cost is $25
[3:03:09] and we'd ask you to register for
[3:03:10] catering purposes. Outside of that,
[3:03:12] you're free to walk with your own
[3:03:14] refreshments. So may the Lord richly
[3:03:15] bless you. Have a wonderful week by the
[3:03:18] grace of God and may God keep you.
[3:03:20] Brother Jason.
[3:03:23] Amen.
