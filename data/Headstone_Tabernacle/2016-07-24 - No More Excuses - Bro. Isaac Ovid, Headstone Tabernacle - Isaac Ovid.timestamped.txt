[49:06] self-righteousness that is really
[49:07] Antichrist anti- God and anti every
[49:10] principle of Christianity that God put

[1:00:45] the same he said you either get better
[1:00:48] or you get worse but I believe in my
[1:00:51] heart this morning there are some people
[1:00:53] in the house who want to get better they
[1:00:56] want to change they want a new walk they
[1:00:59] want a new talk they want an experience
[1:01:03] they want to meet the pillar of fire
[1:01:05] they want to hear from God for
[1:01:08] themselves somebody give God
[1:01:11] worship Hallelujah you may be seated I'm
[1:01:15] going to warn you this morning
[1:01:17] Hallelujah God Ador worship he requires
[1:01:21] worship the very definition of God is
[1:01:24] object of worship some of you playing
[1:01:27] games in here this morning because under
[1:01:29] different circumstances and at different

[1:01:35] you come to the house of God we come to
[1:01:37] give him our all give him our everything
[1:01:41] we come to push as we have never pushed
[1:01:43] before be our Advent here today could be
[1:01:47] our day and God loves it when he hears
[1:01:50] you reach out to him he loves it when
[1:01:53] you cry and
[1:01:55] he loves it when you screamed and say

[1:02:01] not today today is my day I'm not going
[1:02:05] home unless I get a touch from the Lord
[1:02:08] if that is your prayer then God could do
[1:02:11] something for you if that is your desire
[1:02:14] then God could do something for you you
[1:02:16] may be
[1:02:17] seated brother brandom in the message
[1:02:20] Mighty God unveiled he said I am
[1:02:22] identified look at the prophet's
[1:02:25] identification away with the dead
[1:02:27] churches in the message they have
[1:02:29] nowhere to go but the Bram said I'm
[1:02:31] identified with a group that feels the
[1:02:34] spirit of God if you ain't feeling the
[1:02:37] spirit of God but the Bram has nothing
[1:02:39] with you he said I'm identified with a
[1:02:41] group that feels the spirit of God I'm
[1:02:44] identified with a group that knows he's
[1:02:47] unveiled to know he's unveiled means
[1:02:50] that every mystery is revealed the
[1:02:53] mystery of Who You Are the mystery of
[1:02:55] who God is the mystery of where you come
[1:02:58] from the mystery of where you're going
[1:03:00] the mystery of why there's power inside
[1:03:03] of you right now that your sin cannot
[1:03:06] stop your situation cannot stop because
[1:03:09] that seed that's inside of you comes
[1:03:12] from God and it's going back to God can
[1:03:15] I get a witness in the house this
[1:03:17] morning oh you may be

[1:03:29] words it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:03:32] yesterday today and forever I'm
[1:03:34] identified with that group they may be

[1:03:55] testing I'm not ashamed of the reproach

[1:10:39] brother bram's message he said on the
[1:10:41] day of Pentecost they had a super church
[1:10:44] it was a powerful church it was a holy
[1:10:46] ghost L Church there was no sin in the
[1:10:49] church when ananas came up to Peter he
[1:10:51] didn't realize that the pillar of fire
[1:10:54] had tabernacled itself on Peter's heart
[1:10:57] and Peter was no longer in the driver's
[1:10:59] seat but the Holy Ghost was in the
[1:11:01] driver's seat so when he thought he was
[1:11:03] lying to Peter he was lying to the Holy
[1:11:05] Ghost and God killed him on his
[1:11:09] spot Hallelujah in that super Church
[1:11:12] Peter would walk and the light of the
[1:11:14] sun would shine on Peter and Peter's
[1:11:17] shadow people were being healed in his
[1:11:19] shadow that's the attributes of a super
[1:11:23] Church

[1:11:56] another word that Paul said but he knew

[1:14:07] everything you just have to show up and
[1:14:14] come it's not on you it's on
[1:14:17] me it's not your job it's my job just
[1:14:20] come he sent out invitations come
[1:14:24] don't worry about what you're wearing
[1:14:25] come because in those days when you are
[1:14:27] invited they provide a robe for you so
[1:14:29] don't worry about your clothes don't
[1:14:31] worry about the food there's no
[1:14:33] admission fee there's no cost to you

[1:14:54] that goes into it there's a lot of
[1:14:56] sacrifice there's a lot of time there's
[1:14:59] a lot of planning and this great man
[1:15:01] this certain man he took a lot of time
[1:15:04] because he wanted his guests to have the
[1:15:06] very best treatment he didn't want him
[1:15:08] to just have chicken he wanted chicken
[1:15:10] and fish and steak and pork and shrimps
[1:15:13] and cavar he wanted to make sure it was
[1:15:16] a delectable Cuisine of the finest

[1:16:19] excuses
[1:16:21] excuses yes and There's Something About
[1:16:23] This Thing Called
[1:16:25] excuses because an excuse is when you
[1:16:27] pass on the responsibility for your
[1:16:30] action unto someone else or something
[1:16:36] else and they are good
[1:16:38] excuses they are bad

[1:16:48] that's that's legitimate amen amen amen
[1:16:51] there's nothing wrong with buying land
[1:16:52] no there there's no sin in mind a piece
[1:16:54] of property and I say I bought five yoka
[1:16:57] boxing all right and I have to go and
[1:16:59] try them see if they're running right
[1:17:03] see if they can handle weight
[1:17:06] amen this was not them saying I going
[1:17:09] into a party I going into a club I go
[1:17:12] and watch a movie these were not the
[1:17:15] excuses that they had all right the last
[1:17:18] one is a noble one he say I got
[1:17:21] married God
[1:17:23] Almighty and I'm the man of my house so
[1:17:27] I can't come because I got to make sure
[1:17:29] my
[1:17:30] wife is all
[1:17:32] right be all that as it may at the end
[1:17:35] of the day God being a god of results
[1:17:39] and this being a parable he is
[1:17:41] interested in only one thing
[1:17:44] results he's not interested in your
[1:17:46] reason he's not interested in your
[1:17:48] excuse he's interested in what happened
[1:17:51] and what the story was he he wants to
[1:17:53] know that you attended what he invited
[1:17:57] you
[1:17:59] for so a word goes out to the servant
[1:18:02] who comes back depressed and explains it
[1:18:03] to the m he say listen go to the
[1:18:06] highways to the byways because I have
[1:18:08] prepared too much for all of this food
[1:18:11] to go to waste there's too many books
[1:18:14] there's too many tapes there's too much
[1:18:15] anointing there's too much fire there's
[1:18:17] too much inspiration there's there's too
[1:18:20] much hidden under the seven seal that
[1:18:23] I've been prepared for all this time for
[1:18:25] there to be nobody to enjoy this
[1:18:29] food he said go out to the highways go
[1:18:32] to the byways go invite people who look
[1:18:35] like they're not going to make it but
[1:18:36] they're going to make it go invite some
[1:18:38] people they might be messed up right now

[1:19:58] excuses that they made in the days of
[1:20:01] Luther because the standard was set but
[1:20:04] the days of Luther they made excuses
[1:20:06] that's why they couldn't meet the
[1:20:07] standard and that's why the Hool ghost
[1:20:09] had to move on because they made excuses
[1:20:11] but the bandom even said excuses is
[1:20:13] denomination he said your Creed could
[1:20:15] become your excuse but I'm a deacon in
[1:20:17] this church that's why I can't go to
[1:20:19] that group and he said all of that is
[1:20:21] excuses
[1:20:31] said they made excuses in the days of
[1:20:33] Moses they made excuses in the Days of
[1:20:35] Elijah they made excuses in the days of
[1:20:38] Christ and they make excuses
[1:20:43] today
[1:20:45] hallelujah
[1:20:47] hallelujah brother brandham said in the
[1:20:50] message is your life worthy of the
[1:20:52] Gospel he said if Israel 2,000 years ago
[1:20:55] would have accepted the invitation they
[1:20:57] were given they wouldn't be as they are
[1:20:59] today 2,000 years ago Israel turned down
[1:21:03] the invitation to come to the wedding
[1:21:05] supper and they turned it down and went
[1:21:07] into
[1:21:08] judgment Hallelujah wondering about
[1:21:11] Jesus when did this man get his learning
[1:21:14] what school is he from is this not the
[1:21:16] carpenter
[1:21:19] son can the church say Amen but the
[1:21:21] Brandon went on he said Jesus was trying
[1:21:23] to tell them that their excuses was what
[1:21:26] killed the
[1:21:27] prophets that's the prophet's word and
[1:21:30] what killed the righteous to come he
[1:21:32] said they accepted their Creeds that men
[1:21:34] had given them instead of taking the
[1:21:37] word of God and by doing so had made a
[1:21:39] word of God of none
[1:21:43] effect can the church say
[1:21:46] Amen so as a people we have become very
[1:21:50] good Hallelujah at making excuses that's
[1:21:53] right I've made too many
[1:21:56] mistakes I've never done this before I

[1:23:47] excuses in our minds of why we cannot
[1:23:49] forgive come on now but we're in church

[1:23:53] you just cannot let it go
[1:23:56] am hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:00] excuses but the word this morning is no
[1:24:06] more
[1:24:12] excuses thank you Lord can the church
[1:24:16] more say
[1:24:17] Amen can I talk about Moses a little
[1:24:21] bit amen
[1:24:23] God had reached a point his limit with
[1:24:25] what was happening with the children of
[1:24:27] Israel all right so he said I've I've
[1:24:30] heard the cries of my people and I've
[1:24:33] come
[1:24:34] down and God had to find the right
[1:24:37] manall the right person the right
[1:24:40] individual maybe didn't feel good about
[1:24:42] themselves but that didn't matter
[1:24:43] because God has his own plan that's
[1:24:45] right and God had to interrupt his plan
[1:24:49] interrupt this man's life Called Moses
[1:24:53] just the same way God has to interrupt
[1:24:54] us so many times but put different
[1:24:56] situation in front of us to catch our
[1:24:58] attention because we get so used to the
[1:25:00] hustle and the buzzle and we have to
[1:25:02] recognize the devil's job and I said
[1:25:04] this on Tuesday night in maraba the
[1:25:06] devil's job is to use your job to use
[1:25:09] your neighbor to use the weather to use
[1:25:11] your paycheck to use your bank account
[1:25:13] to use the car not working to do
[1:25:15] everything in his power to give you an
[1:25:17] excuse to not see who you really are and
[1:25:20] not realize the potential that God has
[1:25:22] for
[1:25:25] you so God has to interrupt Moses's life
[1:25:29] and drops down and consumes drops down
[1:25:31] on a on a tree and Pillar of Fire comes
[1:25:34] down and and attracts in in the mountain
[1:25:36] and Moses sees it he said this is
[1:25:38] something because it's on fire but it's
[1:25:40] not burning and Moses comes up there and
[1:25:42] God begins to speak to Moses I've heard
[1:25:44] the cries of my people there are some
[1:25:47] people who need Deliverance Moses had
[1:25:49] been living so long in the message 40
[1:25:51] years in the message message amen
[1:25:53] hallelujah that he had lost the
[1:25:55] burden and God is saying to Moses I've
[1:25:57] heard the cries of my people you have
[1:25:59] family down there that need delivered
[1:26:01] yes you have sons and daughters and
[1:26:04] neighbors and relatives people you grow
[1:26:05] up with who need Deliverance I got to
[1:26:07] send somebody but you got to
[1:26:09] go you have got to go you have got to do
[1:26:13] it you have got to forgive you have got
[1:26:16] to love you have got to drop your heart
[1:26:18] you have got to pray I've come down but
[1:26:21] you got to go

[1:26:24] you got to go I came down with a message
[1:26:27] through a prophet but you got to go I'm

[1:31:10] way out yes that's right but I realize
[1:31:13] something you see when you get desperate
[1:31:15] that's right come on when you get
[1:31:16] desperate there's no room for excuses in
[1:31:19] those four men who had the friend
[1:31:21] Hallelujah who with the with the
[1:31:23] condition of py am he was shaking and
[1:31:26] trembling he was an involuntary country
[1:31:29] he lost the control and they heard that
[1:31:31] Jesus was in the town having a house
[1:31:35] meeting when they heard that brother
[1:31:37] Mikey they say we got to get our friend
[1:31:39] to
[1:31:41] Jesus they didn't make his condition an
[1:31:44] excuse they found a way to put him on
[1:31:46] the bed they were walking on the road
[1:31:48] like this because he was shaken that
[1:31:50] wasn't the excuse your car can have
[1:31:52] three tires that's no
[1:31:56] excuse doesn't matter what the situation
[1:31:59] is there is no excuse for you getting
[1:32:02] what you came to get this
[1:32:04] morning you may be
[1:32:06] seated and brother Jerome when they got
[1:32:09] to the house meeting God loves to create
[1:32:12] situation to test if you're going to
[1:32:14] make an excuse if you're going to have a
[1:32:16] reason for why you're not praying why
[1:32:18] you're not sighing why you're not
[1:32:20] desperate I mean they God there the
[1:32:21] house is full convention overflowing
[1:32:24] there's no room those guys had a
[1:32:26] legitimate excuse we cannot get to Jesus
[1:32:30] but those brothers because of
[1:32:31] desperation they took the approach no
[1:32:33] excuses we got to get this man to Jesus
[1:32:37] they analyze the situation I don't know
[1:32:39] you may be seated if there was an
[1:32:40] engineer in the group Hallelujah prise
[1:32:43] God you may be seated analy the building
[1:32:46] he said well if we go up to the side and
[1:32:49] go to the top and we dig a hole with
[1:32:51] this circumference I don't know how they
[1:32:53] did it however they did it they found a
[1:32:55] way they didn't make an excuse they were
[1:32:58] probably shaking on the way of the house
[1:33:00] that didn't matter to them they were
[1:33:02] determined to get to
[1:33:05] Jesus you may be seated when you take
[1:33:08] the approach as a Christian no excuses
[1:33:11] nothing will stop
[1:33:14] you you may be seated and that's why I
[1:33:17] realize a lot of people don't have faith
[1:33:20] that's right said to the young people I
[1:33:22] said listen if the job that you are in
[1:33:25] is taking you away from God you are in
[1:33:28] the wrong
[1:33:29] job don't tell me you need this job to
[1:33:32] pay the bills if it's taking you away
[1:33:34] from God because if you make the
[1:33:36] decision to follow God he's going to
[1:33:38] give you the right
[1:33:45] job no more excuses you may be seated so
[1:33:49] don't tell me because of your job is why
[1:33:51] your skirt have to be on the edge
[1:33:54] right millimeters you just shift a
[1:33:57] little
[1:33:57] bit Hallelujah no more
[1:34:02] excuses hallelujah hallelujah I have to
[1:34:05] quote there I may get it or not but the
[1:34:07] brand said that's why he preaches as
[1:34:09] hard as he can because on the day of
[1:34:11] judgment God don't want to hear your
[1:34:18] excuse this is not man's standing God
[1:34:22] accepts no
[1:34:25] excuses it's the life or
[1:34:28] nothing so you have to understand and
[1:34:31] that's why I said some a couple of
[1:34:32] months ago prove
[1:34:35] God prove God Amen that's what the world
[1:34:39] needs to see the unfailing realities but
[1:34:41] the Brandon preach of the Living God
[1:34:43] Amen is either he's Jehovah Gyra or he's
[1:34:45] not Jehovah Gyra but if he is your
[1:34:48] provider he is obligated to provide for
[1:34:51] you
[1:34:52] put him to the
[1:34:55] test no excuses no more excuses Give me
[1:35:00] liberty or give me debt I want to be a
[1:35:03] real Christian or no Christian at all no
[1:35:06] more
[1:35:16] excuses God will force the issue in your
[1:35:19] life to bring his plan Amen to
[1:35:23] accomplishment hallelujah look at Gideon
[1:35:26] Gideon the Mighty Man of
[1:35:28] Allah excuse number one I'm from the
[1:35:31] smallest tribe
[1:35:33] amenu is a this is a a triumverate of of
[1:35:38] excuses and from the smallest tribe and
[1:35:41] if you analyze the whole tribe my family
[1:35:44] is the smallest family in the smallest
[1:35:47] tribe but Lord I want to go deeper than
[1:35:50] that smallest tribe smallest family and
[1:35:53] I'm the smallest one in my
[1:35:59] family so when you talk about this
[1:36:01] Gideon Mighty Man of
[1:36:03] Valor somebody else can't be talking
[1:36:07] about me and God say say you are the one
[1:36:10] going when your excuses finally run out
[1:36:14] and you have no more excuses you're
[1:36:16] still

[1:36:21] this sings down inside of your heart
[1:36:24] Hallelujah I'm tired of people telling
[1:36:27] me they don't have time to
[1:36:30] pray and and you have an excuse for
[1:36:34] that you don't have time to read the
[1:36:38] Bible there is there an excuse for
[1:36:41] that you come to church when you want to
[1:36:45] is there an excuse for that where are
[1:36:47] you going when you don't put God
[1:36:52] first what message do you believe when
[1:36:54] you have a a excuse a justification a
[1:36:57] reason for why you can't

[1:37:22] excuses Give me
[1:37:24] liberty or give me debt it's good to
[1:37:28] shout and jump but there are people in
[1:37:30] the house with all kind of stuff on the
[1:37:33] inside that only you know and God know
[1:37:35] is there and that's what we want to deal
[1:37:37] with this
[1:37:39] morning it's easy to talk about now it's
[1:37:42] your brother it's your sister somebody
[1:37:44] did you but there's some stuff that some
[1:37:46] of us carry on the inside that we don't
[1:37:48] want nobody to talk about we don't want
[1:37:50] nobody to address we want to mine it and
[1:37:53] grow it up until it becomes so big it
[1:37:56] takes you over
[1:37:58] completely Hallelujah many time we talk
[1:38:00] about the enemy on the outside and it's
[1:38:02] this and it's that and it's this and
[1:38:04] it's that and it's this and it's that
[1:38:05] but what do you do when the
[1:38:08] enemy is on the
[1:38:12] inside it's easy on the outside to do
[1:38:16] the whole show you know God bless you
[1:38:18] God with the Raymond Thompson I believe
[1:38:20] it was so beautifully at the convention
[1:38:22] said brother brandham used to love to go
[1:38:24] to the hills to the mountains because he
[1:38:27] got tired of shaking brother's hands who
[1:38:30] saying God bless you and he's seeing
[1:38:31] that there was no love for him in their
[1:38:37] hearts Hallelujah so I'm going beyond
[1:38:41] the visual this morning I'm going beyond
[1:38:44] the external this morning and and say
[1:38:46] there's no excuse amen for that Envy
[1:38:49] amen amen amen there's no excuses for
[1:38:52] the jealousy in your heart there's no
[1:38:55] excuse for the animosity there's no
[1:38:58] excuse Young Brother young sister for
[1:39:00] how you disrespect your parents even if
[1:39:03] you don't say it but it's on the inside
[1:39:05] we want to dig that up this
[1:39:09] morning you are who you are when you are
[1:39:12] alone by
[1:39:15] yourself that's the real you amen all of
[1:39:19] mankind has his ability act trinidadians
[1:39:23] are uniquely gifted in that area amen
[1:39:27] amen we have very good actors amen put
[1:39:31] on a great show Sunday Thursday Tuesday
[1:39:34] youth service meet them on the street
[1:39:36] able to switch quickly from work
[1:39:38] vernacular to God bless you you read
[1:39:40] that
[1:39:46] book
[1:39:49] Hallelujah no more
[1:39:51] excuses Hallelujah
[1:39:54] excuses the Bible said in the scripture
[1:39:57] where that great man got
[1:40:00] angry at the
[1:40:03] excuses and understand this as I said
[1:40:05] earlier they were relatively
[1:40:08] legitimate you can't tell a man don't
[1:40:10] buy his land and don't mine his property
[1:40:13] and take care of his wife those are
[1:40:16] responsibilities amen but God is digging
[1:40:18] deeper to say you have to prioritize
[1:40:21] this specific invitation to the wedding
[1:40:24] supper this invitation to the Holy Ghost
[1:40:27] this invitation to the
[1:40:32] Rapture let the cares of this life choke
[1:40:36] you and while you may have good motives
[1:40:38] and good objectives and try to do the
[1:40:40] right thing and do be nice to people and
[1:40:44] read and pray and do all the nice
[1:40:46] mannerisms you still miss the
[1:40:47] fundamental aspect of its def Thunder
[1:40:51] the life that shakes the
[1:40:53] devil and it's the token the Holy Ghost
[1:40:57] itself is what God is looking for amen
[1:41:01] when the Bible says put a mark upon
[1:41:04] those that sigh and cry for the
[1:41:06] abomination in the city we have become
[1:41:08] so
[1:41:10] insensitive to the abomination in the
[1:41:12] city amen now we accept
[1:41:15] it when the Abomination should make us
[1:41:18] feel a certain way enough to make you s
[1:41:21] and cry amen when said you saying oh God
[1:41:24] have mercy you just see things and just
[1:41:26] let it go without catching a
[1:41:28] burden for it amen amen what is your
[1:41:32] excuse this morning for not sighing
[1:41:34] Hallelujah for not crying what is your
[1:41:37] excuse this morning for not building a
[1:41:39] prayer altar in your
[1:41:41] house Hallelujah your wife cannot be
[1:41:45] your excuse no your husband cannot be
[1:41:48] your excuse having no money cannot not
[1:41:51] be your excuse not being able to pay the
[1:41:53] rent is not an excuse not having a house
[1:41:56] is not an excuse not having a husband or
[1:41:58] a wife or a boyfriend or that's not an
[1:42:02] excuse praise God hallelujah thank you
[1:42:12] Lord hallelujah you see when you really
[1:42:14] look now at the excuses from a deeper
[1:42:16] level you see it's it's really a
[1:42:18] decision is being made you know
[1:42:22] those that were invited made a choice
[1:42:26] not to
[1:42:27] go so the excuse is really an
[1:42:30] explanation of why you didn't do it
[1:42:34] am so the question this morning is what
[1:42:38] is more
[1:42:40] important than
[1:42:44] thisall but another way what does it
[1:42:46] profit a man to gain the whole
[1:42:49] world and lose his
[1:42:55] soulelujah for God so loved the world he
[1:42:58] sacrifice everything he gave his only
[1:43:01] begotten son that that we could have
[1:43:02] this access this morning Hallelujah
[1:43:05] there is nothing to gain without
[1:43:07] sacrifice
[1:43:09] hallelujah hallelujah GL Hallelujah
[1:43:12] there is no reward without sacrifice yes
[1:43:16] you want success in your school you have
[1:43:19] to sacrifice Hallelujah how do you
[1:43:21] measure that sacrifice you study you go
[1:43:24] to your class you read you review that's
[1:43:27] the
[1:43:28] process that's the sacrifice sometimes
[1:43:31] you want to go and play sometimes you
[1:43:32] want to go out but you make a sacrifice
[1:43:35] because you have an exam coming up and
[1:43:36] because you want results and you want
[1:43:38] the reward you have to make a choice to
[1:43:42] sacrifice certain things because you
[1:43:44] want right Hallelujah the
[1:43:49] reward you want buy a house you want to
[1:43:51] buy a car you want to buy something of
[1:43:53] value you can't spend the same way you
[1:43:56] did when you didn't want those things
[1:43:58] all of a sudden you decide to have a
[1:43:59] budget because you're saving to
[1:44:02] something there will be days when you
[1:44:03] want to eat a
[1:44:05] KFC you want a three piece but you know
[1:44:08] you settle for now
[1:44:09] stackpack two
[1:44:11] piece because there's a
[1:44:14] sacrifice it's also good for your health
[1:44:19] too because you want a
[1:44:22] reward but there's a
[1:44:25] misconception with the kingdom of God
[1:44:28] that people want to come to church and
[1:44:30] then they look to the
[1:44:32] pastor pray for
[1:44:36] me they come to church and they expect
[1:44:39] things to happen that because they came
[1:44:42] to church they are now on this register
[1:44:45] that now opens up the door to unlimited
[1:44:48] blessings unlimited favor without
[1:44:53] sacrifice and that does not
[1:44:56] exist Hallelujah you have to
[1:45:00] sacrifice the Bible says we bring a
[1:45:03] sacrifice of praise praise itself is a
[1:45:06] sacrifice some of you in here don't even
[1:45:08] want to praise and that's that's that's
[1:45:11] that's a sacrifice that you could that
[1:45:12] you must be able to do because a
[1:45:15] sacrifice of praise is when you don't
[1:45:17] feel like praising Hallelujah he is
[1:45:19] still worthy of the praise so you
[1:45:22] sacrifice your feeling you sacrifice
[1:45:24] what's happening in your life and it's a
[1:45:27] sacrifice of praise because you are
[1:45:29] acknowledging that he deserves a praise
[1:45:31] whether you have money or no money
[1:45:34] whether you're sick or not sick whether
[1:45:36] you're having a good day or a bad day
[1:45:38] you make a choice to sacrifice and to
[1:45:41] give God praise and worship because he
[1:45:44] is God and there's none like him there's
[1:45:47] none higher than him there's none
[1:45:49] greater than him there's no God like
[1:45:51] Jehovah and it's a sacrifice of praise
[1:45:54] because when the Praises go up the glory
[1:45:57] of God must come
[1:46:06] down you may be
[1:46:11] seated talk about those all night payam
[1:46:14] meanss thank you Lord and that's why
[1:46:15] brother Bram said you could sing too
[1:46:17] much you could preach too much you could
[1:46:20] dance too much but you could never
[1:46:24] pray never pray too much amen that's
[1:46:27] right that's right and we need to bring
[1:46:29] back the church to that level of sighing
[1:46:32] and crying a church that is not sighing
[1:46:34] and crying is
[1:46:38] dying because the shouting and the
[1:46:40] jumping on the outside doesn't deal with
[1:46:42] the issues on the
[1:46:45] inside there's a surgery that needs to
[1:46:47] take
[1:46:48] place you can't go go to a hospital
[1:46:51] surgery and do what you want before the
[1:46:53] doctor tell you before you come in for
[1:46:54] the surgery don't eat for 24
[1:46:56] hours there's certain things you have to
[1:46:59] do in preparation for the surgery amen
[1:47:01] amen that's just the way it
[1:47:04] is Joshua told the people sanctify
[1:47:07] yourselves amen because in a few days we
[1:47:10] are going over you can do what you
[1:47:14] want amen no
[1:47:16] more
[1:47:19] excuses I pray that the light this
[1:47:21] morning would shine upon the
[1:47:23] seeds in your
[1:47:26] soul that you could
[1:47:28] recognize what time are we living in the
[1:47:32] woman with the issue of blood she had
[1:47:34] been in that condition for some
[1:47:37] time she spent her money she got
[1:47:41] results the doctors told her what was
[1:47:43] going
[1:47:45] on she spent more money and the
[1:47:49] condition wasn't getting better
[1:47:52] better she could have blamed the doctor
[1:47:55] she could have blamed the medication she
[1:47:56] could have blamed stress she could have
[1:47:58] done whatever she wanted but when she
[1:48:00] heard Jesus was in town she had no
[1:48:04] excuse nobody was going to stop her
[1:48:07] because she didn't want that
[1:48:09] opportunity to pass her by amen amen so
[1:48:13] she began to press away yes to
[1:48:17] Jesus and around Jesus was there were so
[1:48:19] many people she didn't make that an
[1:48:24] excuse she didn't make the crowd an
[1:48:26] excuse she didn't make what other people
[1:48:29] doing an excuse and that's why when God
[1:48:31] speaks to your heart you have to respond
[1:48:33] to God you're not responding to me you
[1:48:36] responding to his word hallelujah so if
[1:48:38] something trips inside of your heart and
[1:48:40] you want to jump that's on you it
[1:48:42] doesn't matter if anybody else jumping
[1:48:44] anybody else shouting it's you and
[1:48:49] God
[1:48:50] give us more individuals who will be so
[1:48:54] focused on the promise of God that they
[1:48:55] would have no
[1:49:06] excuses thank you
[1:49:10] jesusall brother Bram said
[1:49:13] here their excuses is their
[1:49:16] Creeds and
[1:49:18] denominations you see your belief could
[1:49:20] be an excuse that's right and but as
[1:49:24] long as the denomination your excuses
[1:49:27] try to shadow that seed that you know
[1:49:30] actually lays there you were taking the
[1:49:33] part of lot he said throw them things
[1:49:35] away and let the gospel light shining
[1:49:37] upon there the power of Jesus
[1:49:40] Christ keeping the light off of it will
[1:49:43] keep it from living because if the light
[1:49:46] ever gets to it it'll spring forth to
[1:49:48] life amen but the B said that's the
[1:49:51] reason the people say don't go to some
[1:49:52] of them kind of meeting they afraid some
[1:49:55] of the light will strike one of their
[1:49:59] members but the B said remember the
[1:50:01] woman at the well she was a prostitute
[1:50:03] she stood there there stood the priest
[1:50:06] they had seen Jesus tell Nathaniel I saw
[1:50:08] you when you were under the Fig Tree and
[1:50:10] all that and this little woman when she
[1:50:12] walked up there in her immoral State at
[1:50:15] the well living with six men and when
[1:50:16] she walked up there in that state Jesus
[1:50:19] said bring me a drink the conversation
[1:50:22] started go get your husband and come
[1:50:24] here she said I don't have
[1:50:26] any you said the truth you've got five
[1:50:29] and the one you're living with not your
[1:50:30] husband she said I perceive that you're
[1:50:32] a
[1:50:33] prophet and that goes on but the B said
[1:50:36] that settled it when the light flashed
[1:50:38] across the seed laying in that little
[1:50:40] old harot the hot days was over enter
[1:50:44] the street she went glorifying God she
[1:50:48] didn't even make her pass an excuse she
[1:50:50] didn't worry what anybody else said
[1:50:51] about her she said come see a man who
[1:50:54] told me the things I've done isn't this
[1:50:57] the Messiah what was it the light got to
[1:51:00] that seed back under the shadow of that
[1:51:03] prostitute shelter so God found way for
[1:51:06] the
[1:51:07] light to get to that
[1:51:10] seat God himself you may me see that you
[1:51:14] have to understand God himself lives by
[1:51:16] that no excuses you
[1:51:18] know God thank you Jesus so it's not
[1:51:22] something just for you and God don't
[1:51:23] live by those
[1:51:25] rules when it was time for God to do
[1:51:27] Deliverance the Bible said he was so
[1:51:30] tired he said take me to the other side
[1:51:33] and he went to sleep on the boat and it
[1:51:35] was under the way to the other side that
[1:51:37] the devil come and bring up the storm
[1:51:40] they they they could have said let's go
[1:51:41] back to the shore and the other and and
[1:51:43] go back to where we came from but God
[1:51:45] had a destination because there was a
[1:51:47] man on the other side who needed
[1:51:49] Deliverance and the storm was not going
[1:51:51] to be an excuse Jesus tiredness was not
[1:51:54] going to be an excuse the Bible said you
[1:51:57] maybe see that Jesus was so tired the
[1:51:59] word carried they used in the original
[1:52:02] language meant physically to lift so
[1:52:05] they physically lifted Jesus into the
[1:52:07] boat amen but he was so focused on
[1:52:10] delivering that one man on the other
[1:52:12] side he didn't let his tiredness P
[1:52:14] excuse the storm was an excuse and when
[1:52:17] he got to the other side there's a man
[1:52:19] screaming out for help with demons on
[1:52:22] him named
[1:52:26] Legion and the amount of demons he had
[1:52:29] was also no excuse because when Jesus
[1:52:31] came to deliver there's no excuse he
[1:52:35] come to deliver and when God come to set
[1:52:37] you free the odds could be against you
[1:52:41] but there's no excuse you're going to be
[1:52:43] delivered can the Church Say
[1:52:48] Amen
[1:52:54] she may be seated Hallelujah could you
[1:52:57] take some more I'm going to drive this
[1:52:59] home this morning but the B said let's
[1:53:01] compare something amen he said let's
[1:53:03] let's let's let's let's make a
[1:53:04] comparison amen let's compare the life
[1:53:07] of St Paul Paul the Apostle to the Rich
[1:53:10] Young
[1:53:11] Ruler listen carefully to the prophet he
[1:53:13] said the same light struck both men
[1:53:17] that's right am both had the same
[1:53:20] invitation from Jesus Christ their Bo
[1:53:24] was well trained in the scriptures they
[1:53:27] were both theologians you remember Jesus
[1:53:29] told the Young Rich ruler keep the
[1:53:31] Commandments he said well I've done
[1:53:32] these things from my youth he was a
[1:53:35] trained man so was Paul both were well
[1:53:38] trained in scripture Paul used to go to
[1:53:41] Gia and and he was he was trained in
[1:53:43] scripture both were well trained both of
[1:53:45] them had the word listen carefully one
[1:53:48] had it from knowledge
[1:53:51] the other had it from The Germ of life
[1:53:53] in it amen so when the light flashed
[1:53:55] across in front of Paul he said Lord who
[1:53:57] are you amen he said I'm Jesus here I am
[1:54:01] and he was ready the light struck both
[1:54:03] men one was
[1:54:05] gerti and the other was not amen that's
[1:54:08] the way it is church spiritual and
[1:54:11] church natural that's why brother the
[1:54:13] Bram Tau he said in every Church there
[1:54:16] are three kinds of Believers so you
[1:54:19] can't get upset when we preach as hard
[1:54:20] as we can to live right and people can't
[1:54:23] meet the mark because in every Church
[1:54:26] there are three kinds of Believers is
[1:54:29] everybody with me listen to the prophet
[1:54:31] the rich man had his
[1:54:35] excuse he couldn't do it he was to weigh
[1:54:39] down with too many friends of the
[1:54:42] world you remember Jesus Des eared he
[1:54:45] said help you sell all you
[1:54:47] have give to the porn follow
[1:54:51] me and he couldn't do it and the say he
[1:54:54] couldn't do it because he had an excuse
[1:54:57] and you have said everything you cannot
[1:54:59] do there will be an
[1:55:01] excuse there's a reason for it so this
[1:55:04] man walked
[1:55:06] away sorrowful Jesus loved him amen amen
[1:55:10] but he had so many excuses he couldn't
[1:55:13] do
[1:55:13] it but the BAM said notice the rich man
[1:55:16] had his
[1:55:17] excuses listen carefully he never
[1:55:19] forsake his testimony this is powerful
[1:55:22] he's in church living He but we find out
[1:55:25] that he went to great business he had
[1:55:28] knowledge he went to such a place till
[1:55:30] he had so much increase till he had to
[1:55:32] build new bonds to put things in and
[1:55:36] when he died and some Bachelor priest
[1:55:39] with his color turned around preach his
[1:55:40] funeral no doubt and when he did he said
[1:55:43] they might have put the flags at half
[1:55:45] mast this brother Brandon and said our
[1:55:47] dear beloved brother mayor of this city
[1:55:51] now he is in the arms of Almighty
[1:55:53] because he was such a great member of
[1:55:56] the church he did so and so and so and
[1:55:59] the Bible says the prophet said in hand
[1:56:02] he lifted up his eyes being in
[1:56:06] torment and remember he still wanted to
[1:56:09] hold his profession in hell he seen
[1:56:12] Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham and he
[1:56:14] said Father Abraham and but Abraham took
[1:56:17] that said still calling him father
[1:56:21] so what he knew and what he lived was so
[1:56:23] ingrained in him he had it
[1:56:26] intellectually Hallelujah the said he
[1:56:28] took his knowledge and went to an
[1:56:29] intellectual church and when the light
[1:56:32] struck him he turned it down but BR said
[1:56:35] if that isn't the Modern Trend of the
[1:56:38] church today no matter what God flashes
[1:56:42] across their path the pillar of fire or
[1:56:45] whatever else it might be they're still
[1:56:47] with their knowledge they can explain it
[1:56:50] away yes and go to the intellectual
[1:56:54] group for some social standing listen to
[1:56:56] The Prophet if this doesn't apply to
[1:56:59] this day amen
[1:57:01] hallelujah but listen to The Prophet but
[1:57:03] Paul was already in the social standing
[1:57:05] with great knowledge a great scholar
[1:57:08] under gel a right hand to the high
[1:57:10] priest in so much till he went to the
[1:57:13] priest and got orders to put all them
[1:57:15] holy rollers in
[1:57:17] jail but when the light struck his path
[1:57:21] and he seen that the same Pillar of Fire
[1:57:23] that led Israel through the Wilderness
[1:57:25] was Jesus Christ he forsook all that he
[1:57:28] knowed and he came to the life can the
[1:57:30] church say amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:35] hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah
[1:57:38] my Hallelujah hallu hallu no more
[1:57:43] excuses excuses Hallelujah from the
[1:57:46] message of wedding supper I just want to
[1:57:48] touch on the scripture a little bit but
[1:57:50] the B said as soon as the invitation was
[1:57:52] made and given out any excuses was made
[1:57:55] oh yes one married a wife and the other
[1:57:56] brought him Oxon you know the story but
[1:57:58] that's the way it is today God made the
[1:58:01] supper ready send the preacher to preach
[1:58:03] the faith what happened oh I can't go
[1:58:06] because I'm a deacon in another church I
[1:58:08] just couldn't do that well I couldn't go
[1:58:10] because it would lower my Prestige the
[1:58:12] prophet said your prestige oh I couldn't
[1:58:14] go because I don't believe them old Holy

[2:01:07] spirit God's love can the church say
[2:01:13] amen
[2:01:16] hallelujah hallelujah and brother Bram
[2:01:18] goes on
[2:01:20] in the wedding supper speaking about the
[2:01:22] robe he said how would it be if you get
[2:01:26] invited to this wedding supper and
[2:01:28] there's somebody sitting out with a
[2:01:29] fancy suit on this table and somebody
[2:01:31] with Rags on this table and this one
[2:01:33] wearing what they want so he said it was
[2:01:35] the custom and the tradition that when
[2:01:38] you come to the house you are given a
[2:01:40] robe so that every single person who
[2:01:42] comes into the supper is
[2:01:45] looking the same way amen and mother bam
[2:01:48] said that robe is nothing but the
[2:01:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen
[2:01:54] because when you come in the right way
[2:01:56] you receive the
[2:01:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but it's
[2:02:01] very difficult to preach the baptism of
[2:02:03] the Holy Ghost if you don't have it or
[2:02:06] if you've never experienced it you have
[2:02:07] to find a way to build a bridge above it
[2:02:09] hallelujah or try to dig under it but we
[2:02:12] want to go through brother kangali until
[2:02:14] every last one is sealed into the
[2:02:17] kingdom can the church sh amen so the
[2:02:20] invitations are out tonight friends
[2:02:23] Hallelujah and the call is out to see
[2:02:25] who would respond to the core Hallelujah
[2:02:28] and the angel of the Lord is here and
[2:02:30] he's handing out robes he's handing out
[2:02:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is the
[2:02:36] one to give the experience not the
[2:02:38] preacher but he is the one but the B
[2:02:40] said that robe is a type that of Elijah
[2:02:43] and
[2:02:44] Elisha of Christ and his church that
[2:02:47] when that mantle was dropped down the
[2:02:49] church was supposed to wrap itself under
[2:02:52] that canopy put on the whole armor of
[2:02:54] God put on the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:57] Ghost not just on their flesh but on the
[2:02:59] inner man amen so that it'll be in the
[2:03:02] control
[2:03:04] tower and it's something that when every
[2:03:06] man has been invited by the said you
[2:03:08] can't go by the door of the church if
[2:03:11] you go by the door of the church you'll
[2:03:13] get mixed up in theology
[2:03:15] amen
[2:03:17] H he said and I am the door to the
[2:03:20] Sheepfold Hallelujah he said it must be
[2:03:22] that you go through Christ but the B
[2:03:25] said he always wondered how Jesus could
[2:03:28] be the door to the Sheepfold and he
[2:03:29] brought out that the shepherd would lay
[2:03:31] as the door that when the Sheep come in
[2:03:34] he would lay across the entrance as the
[2:03:37] door so that if a wolf or anything try
[2:03:39] to get in they have to go through him
[2:03:43] and he is saying here that you have to
[2:03:44] go through Christ it's not the church
[2:03:47] you go to it's not who your Pastor is
[2:03:49] you must go through Christ Hallelujah
[2:03:53] you must go through the baptism of the
[2:03:55] Holy Ghost you must at the life it must
[2:03:58] be a living faith must be a living
[2:04:00] virtue must be a living knowledge must
[2:04:02] be Temperance patience godliness broadly
[2:04:04] kindness charity there's no other
[2:04:06] way can the
[2:04:09] church say
[2:04:12] Amen there they were when this robe come
[2:04:14] on but the B said I don't mean some big
[2:04:16] robe that some company made out here
[2:04:19] that's on the outside for man to be seen
[2:04:21] But The Robe that Christ gives
[2:04:26] you he said you will be he said the holy
[2:04:28] ghost that was in Christ comes into the
[2:04:30] believer that's got the invitation to
[2:04:33] the supper amen and the say when that
[2:04:36] rope comes in there there's a little
[2:04:37] hidden power that comes down in your
[2:04:40] heart that all the devils in hell can't
[2:04:43] make you doubt it amen that hidden power
[2:04:46] not with a great big something across
[2:04:48] your forehead and a doctor of divinity
[2:04:51] it's a inside hidden power it's been
[2:04:54] God's program since the first lamb was
[2:04:56] slain in the Garden of Eden Samson had
[2:04:59] it he had a hidden power what was it a
[2:05:01] touch of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and
[2:05:04] brother Bron goes on to talk about
[2:05:05] Samson he said Samson had shoulders he
[2:05:07] said he didn't have shoulders like a
[2:05:08] like a bando he said Samson was a little
[2:05:10] bitty mama's boy a little curly-headed
[2:05:13] shrimp hallelujah hallelujah he said
[2:05:15] that's what fooled the people he was
[2:05:17] just an ordinary boy and had seven
[2:05:19] little curls hanging down his back
[2:05:21] looking like a little
[2:05:22] that's right everybody would laugh
[2:05:25] at him a type of the Holy Ghost Church
[2:05:27] and he was a weakling but when the hour
[2:05:29] come and God wanted to use him he was a
[2:05:32] giant brother God wants a church that he
[2:05:35] can lay his hand on I don't care how

[2:07:16] fire started to burn them it was hotter
[2:07:18] than the fire was the hidden power was
[2:07:21] hotter than the fire in a fiery
[2:07:25] furnace my my my peter had it after
[2:07:29] Pentecost and when he went to the gate

[2:12:15] identified with the word so if you find
[2:12:18] yourself making excuses this morning you
[2:12:20] need to hit the Altar and say Lord I
[2:12:22] need a touch from the Holy Ghost I need
[2:12:24] the Holy Ghost I need to be filled I

[2:12:33] experience hallelujah it's there to make
[2:12:36] it so the Holy Ghost will follow the
[2:12:38] word just exactly that's what the Holy
[2:12:41] Ghost is to do it's to make you make you
[2:12:44] man turn your head from them half naked
[2:12:46] wom and quit lusting after them yeah
[2:12:49] church members that what's it's supposed
[2:12:51] to do it's to quit making you smoke and

[2:12:58] Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life
[2:13:01] it makes you quit gossiping makes you
[2:13:03] quit playing cards shooting craps and
[2:13:05] all these other things that you do
[2:13:07] around the corner it'll make you quit

[2:13:14] it'll do it'll quit making you want to
[2:13:16] marry somebody else's wife these are the
[2:13:18] prophet's words
[2:13:20] now it's to make you live a holy life
[2:13:23] that's what the Holy Ghost is power for
[2:13:26] to set your affections on the things
[2:13:28] above where God stands the mind of
[2:13:31] Christ in you Hallelujah he said you

[2:13:39] say I can't do it oh I just can't sure
[2:13:42] you can't but the Holy Spirit comes for
[2:13:45] that
[2:13:46] purpose that's what the Holy Ghost is
[2:13:48] for not by your strength not by your
[2:13:51] might but by the spirit of the Lord and

[2:19:53] was a GPS it was taking him to where he
[2:19:55] needed to be keeping him away from
[2:19:57] destruction because no weapon formed
[2:19:59] against Peter could Prosper there was a
