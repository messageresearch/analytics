[53:39] scripture Malachi 3: six for I am the
[53:43] Lord and I change
[53:45] not I am the Lord and I change not may
[53:48] the Lord have a blessing to the reading
[53:50] of his word you may be seated this
[53:52] morning in the presence of the Lord it's
[53:53] certainly a great privilege to be be
[53:55] here and brother over asked me to just
[53:57] greet the church before we go into the
[54:00] message this morning uh he wanted us to
[54:03] hear that message uh from uh India and
[54:06] have you been blessed with the India
[54:07] meetings thus far amen what a time in
[54:10] the presence of the Lord so this morning
[54:13] we'll be going back to India for I
[54:15] believe it's a final service that he's
[54:16] playing for the church so we on the
[54:18] great expectation uh for that and I
[54:22] spoke with him yesterday he preached on
[54:23] Friday night and he'll go going to be
[54:25] speaking this morning again uh two
[54:27] different churches so we pray that the
[54:29] Lord would strengthen him and minister
[54:31] to him for such a time as this and just
[54:35] before we go to the tape just for a few
[54:37] minutes I am the Lord and I change not
[54:41] you know when you look at what's
[54:43] happening around the world the
[54:45] governments change policies change
[54:48] procedures change Medical Practice
[54:50] change the technology is changing but in
[54:54] the background of all of that God is
[54:56] saying I am the Lord and I change not
[55:00] God is not changing his standard of
[55:03] Holiness he's not changing his standard
[55:06] of righteousness he's not changing his
[55:09] standard of what it takes to be a
[55:10] Christian in such a time as this and you
[55:13] might change jobs you might change
[55:15] careers you might change a lot of things
[55:17] but God is saying I am the unchanging
[55:20] God and sin is still sin and Holiness is
[55:23] still Holiness and right rightousness is
[55:26] righteousness the bar could be lowered
[55:28] in some places and what may and and you
[55:31] know it growing up years ago there were
[55:32] things that were unacceptable and things
[55:34] that have become acceptable and in the
[55:37] midst of this God is saying I don't care
[55:39] what people accept I don't care what
[55:41] they push on the television I don't care
[55:43] what they normalize on the news and what
[55:45] they normalize in the media I am God and
[55:48] I change not man could change but God
[55:51] will not change and can the church say
[55:54] amen and
[55:55] and the reality is that's how the devil
[55:57] is the devil has tried to change his
[55:59] tactics to get to you and try to to to
[56:01] make it easy and to tell you it's all
[56:03] right you could do that and you could
[56:04] get away with it but God said I am God
[56:06] and I change
[56:08] not no flesh could glory in my presence
[56:12] the way you want to live can glory in my
[56:14] presence your interpretation of it can
[56:16] glory in my presence I want a holy walk
[56:20] I want a holy life I want a Sanctified
[56:22] walk I want a Sanctified life I want you
[56:25] to be 100% or no percent he said I
[56:27] rather you hot or I rather you cold I am
[56:31] God and I change not I didn't change for
[56:34] Moses I didn't change for Abraham I
[56:36] didn't change for Noah I didn't change
[56:37] for Elijah I didn't change for Peter I
[56:40] didn't change for John I didn't change
[56:42] for William brandham and I'm not
[56:43] changing for this bride I will reward
[56:46] those that stand I will fill those that
[56:49] are hungry and thirsty after
[56:50] righteousness the policy is still the
[56:53] same blessed are they that hunger and
[56:55] thirst after righteousness they shall be
[56:58] filled I am the Lord and I change
[57:01] not I will judge sin and I will bless
[57:04] those that are
[57:05] [Applause]
[57:06] thirsty so I don't care what they do in
[57:09] your job I don't care what they changing
[57:11] your school and okay what they say it's
[57:13] okay to do with now not with God even if
[57:16] people in the church drop their standard
[57:18] God is not dropping his standard I am
[57:22] the Lord and I change not
[57:27] and the Bible I read says God is no
[57:30] respector of persons he doesn't respect
[57:32] me he doesn't respect you he respects
[57:34] his word he honors his word uh he stands
[57:37] with his word uh he protects his word
[57:40] and the spirit is obligated to follow
[57:43] his word so we want to be a word CH
[57:46] Church a word bride a word people can
[57:48] the Church Say
[57:53] Amen I'm almost done 6 more
[57:57] minutes in the message convinced and
[58:00] then concerned brother Bram said God
[58:01] gave the promises and when God gave the
[58:04] promise to Abraham he said he would
[58:06] possess the Gate of his enemies and so
[58:10] Shamar believe that in other words
[58:12] Shamar could have rested on the Word of
[58:14] Promise that was given to Abraham
[58:16] because he understood that God was not a
[58:18] changing
[58:20] God and this morning we could rest on
[58:23] every promise that was placed in every
[58:26] scripture that was given to every
[58:28] Prophet that was given to every judge
[58:30] that was given to every man of God we
[58:32] could stand this morning because he is
[58:34] God and he changed
[58:35] [Applause]
[58:38] not brother Bram said God only needs one
[58:42] man just let him get one man in his hand
[58:45] the world will think he's crazy but he
[58:47] will drive home the gospel listen to
[58:49] when when he's thoroughly convinced that
[58:52] Jesus Christ Remains the Same yesterday
[58:54] to today and forever under anything else
[58:57] he will stand true and go on because he
[58:59] is Thoroughly convinced that God is
[59:04] God and I have one more quote in the
[59:07] message future home of the Heavenly
[59:09] bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said
[59:11] if he ever healed a person he has to do
[59:14] it again when the same conditions is
[59:17] met because he's the same God in other
[59:20] words God is a scientist he's a great
[59:23] astronaut he is looking for a certain
[59:26] formula when you make certain chemicals
[59:29] it doesn't matter The Chemicals React a
[59:30] certain way he said once a conditions
[59:33] and meant the reactions got to take
[59:34] place once the word and spirit comes
[59:37] together something has to take place
[59:38] when God people gather together on one
[59:40] Min or one Accord something have to take
[59:42] place when you confess your fault one to
[59:44] another something has to take place when

[1:12:58] this do this your own
[1:13:03] conscience brother give a
[1:13:06] story of a woman you go to
[1:13:10] church and then she divorced her
[1:13:13] husband she went with this one and that
[1:13:16] one she playing piano in
[1:13:20] church she don't want to listen to her
[1:13:22] husband
[1:13:24] she don't want to fall in
[1:13:26] line she want to look like the world and
[1:13:29] act like the
[1:13:31] world one day some sickness took her
[1:13:34] like
[1:13:36] cancer and she was
[1:13:39] dying and a preacher came to her
[1:13:42] bed and asked her are you ready to meet
[1:13:45] the
[1:13:48] Lord I am fine I am
[1:13:50] fine I didn't ask you to come to see me
[1:13:55] I don't want to hear
[1:13:57] you now watch
[1:14:00] this all where you have
[1:14:04] doctor
[1:14:06] lawyer all the pride of being driving
[1:14:08] some fancy
[1:14:11] car GC
[1:14:14] CX all where you have all those
[1:14:18] subjects and you are proud of your
[1:14:22] family all of that is in the human
[1:14:25] Spirit now when you
[1:14:28] die your
[1:14:30] spirit begins to break
[1:14:33] up so the blood begins to
[1:14:38] leave and your human
[1:14:40] Spirit begins to break
[1:14:43] up when you think you're

[1:14:59] Realm of the human
[1:15:02] spirit and that human
[1:15:04] spirit is what breaks
[1:15:07] up so when the woman thought she was
[1:15:11] saved as she was
[1:15:14] dying and her spirit begin to break
[1:15:17] up a pastor came to look for
[1:15:20] her and then all of a sudden

[1:15:41] soul is what will go in the presence of
[1:15:45] God your condition of your
[1:15:48] soul so you can't take any

[1:22:49] it Jesus in Matthew
[1:22:51] 7 Jesus
[1:22:54] speaking he said whosoever Hearth these
[1:22:56] sayings of
[1:22:58] mine and doth
[1:23:01] them I would liken him unto a wise
[1:23:05] man that his house upon a
[1:23:08] rock and the rain
[1:23:11] descended and the flux
[1:23:14] came and the winds
[1:23:17] blew and beat upon that
[1:23:21] house and it fell
[1:23:23] not for it was founded upon a
[1:23:26] rock and everyone that hear these says
[1:23:29] of
[1:23:31] mine and do it them
[1:23:33] not shall be liken to a foolish
[1:23:37] man that built his house upon a
[1:23:41] sand and the rain
[1:23:44] descended the floods
[1:23:46] came the winds
[1:23:48] blew and beat upon that house
[1:23:53] and it
[1:23:54] fell and great was the fall of
[1:23:58] it and it came to
[1:24:01] pass when Jesus had ended his
[1:24:04] saying the people were astonished at his
[1:24:09] Doctrine for he taught
[1:24:11] them as one having
[1:24:17] Authority as the
[1:24:20] Scribe let's go here a little
[1:24:24] bit the person that built a house upon
[1:24:27] the
[1:24:29] sand beautiful
[1:24:31] house it may be better than the house
[1:24:34] that the man built upon the
[1:24:38] rock but the rains have come
[1:24:43] yet the floods hasn't arrived as
[1:24:48] yet you could painted blue pink yellow
[1:24:51] green
[1:24:53] you could have first floor second floor
[1:24:55] third
[1:24:57] floor everybody in the village admir the
[1:25:01] house they taking pictures of the
[1:25:04] house but that house was built upon a
[1:25:09] sand what is Jesus
[1:25:11] saying he is saying judgment is
[1:25:15] coming a storm is
[1:25:18] coming a flood is
[1:25:21] coming a rain is
[1:25:24] coming ready or
[1:25:26] not it's still
[1:25:28] coming and when it
[1:25:31] comes according to what you have as a
[1:25:36] foundation
[1:25:37] stand or your house will
[1:25:41] fall glory to God and this come to every
[1:25:46] family every
[1:25:48] home every
[1:25:51] marriage happened that you didn't
[1:25:56] expect it doesn't you know the Bible
[1:25:59] talk about Jesus in a
[1:26:02] boat and the Bible said the winds were
[1:26:06] contrary it's not because somebody sin
[1:26:08] in the
[1:26:10] boat is not somebody living a contrary
[1:26:14] life cancer might take
[1:26:17] you kidney
[1:26:19] problem
[1:26:21] sickness you didn't ask for
[1:26:24] that you might find yourself in a
[1:26:27] wheelchair you get in an
[1:26:30] accident winds blowing
[1:26:33] contrary there are things you can't
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:36] explain but you have
[1:26:40] confidence God will make it work for
[1:26:42] your
[1:26:44] good what I'm telling you in
[1:26:47] there a storm is
[1:26:50] coming where have you you build
[1:26:54] it when Peter told
[1:26:57] Jesus toward the

[1:27:09] Rock I will build my
[1:27:12] church and the Gates of
[1:27:15] Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:27:18] it now the word
[1:27:21] prevail
[1:27:22] is to wrestle and
[1:27:25] overcome it means the Gates of
[1:27:30] Hell will challenge
[1:27:32] it will attack
[1:27:35] it but it cannot defeat
[1:27:38] it this
[1:27:40] Army that God has raising
[1:27:43] up will not be
[1:27:46] defeated this
[1:27:48] pride in
[1:27:50] India going to stand on the
[1:27:53] word he says nothing going to stop this
[1:27:57] Pride not even

[1:28:15] Rapture praise the name of the
[1:28:18] Lord you will be seated glory to God
[1:28:22] when
[1:28:23] Jesus received the Holy Ghost without
[1:28:28] measure he was led by the
[1:28:31] spirit Into the
[1:28:36] Wilderness Into the
[1:28:39] Wilderness to to be tempted of the
[1:28:43] devil and Jesus had to
[1:28:47] overcome the lust of the
[1:28:49] eyes the lust of the flesh
[1:28:53] and the pride of
[1:28:55] life that was a personal
[1:28:59] battle between
[1:29:01] Jesus and the devil no Pastor
[1:29:06] involved no church
[1:29:09] involved
[1:29:11] involved Prophet
[1:29:13] involved this is
[1:29:15] Jesus and Lucifer Lucifer and Lucifer
[1:29:19] Lucifer didn't know who he was
[1:29:23] so he told
[1:29:24] Jesus if th be the Son of
[1:29:28] God turn these stones into
[1:29:31] bread now the Bible said he
[1:29:36] hungered he was
[1:29:38] hungry and Jesus had the power to turn
[1:29:43] the stone into
[1:29:45] bread but
[1:29:47] Jesus Ro back on the
[1:29:49] word he said man
[1:29:53] live
[1:29:55] by by every
[1:29:58] word proceed out of the mouth of
[1:30:02] God Jesus overcame the
[1:30:06] Devil by the
[1:30:09] way because he
[1:30:11] knew you were
[1:30:13] coming and you have to
[1:30:16] overcome the
[1:30:18] Devil by the word he never us his
[1:30:25] power nothing to
[1:30:28] Satan so then the
[1:30:31] devil took him to a high temp
[1:30:35] temple and begin to tell
[1:30:38] him the
[1:30:40] scriptures he said if you jump down from
[1:30:44] there Bible said the Angel going to hold
[1:30:46] you
[1:30:49] up he's trying to tempt Jesus
[1:30:53] to make a
[1:30:55] show he try to Temp
[1:30:58] Jesus Jesus kep behind me Satan he
[1:31:00] rebuked
[1:31:02] him the final picture from the
[1:31:06] devil he showed
[1:31:09] Jesus curv
[1:31:13] screen he said all these

[1:31:38] behind me
[1:31:42] Satan Hallelujah thou sh serve the Lord
[1:31:45] thy
[1:31:50] God Satan was
[1:31:53] shocked he still didn't know who Jesus
[1:31:58] was overcome the Devil by the
[1:32:03] word what did Jesus do
[1:32:06] afterwards he went into the
[1:32:09] temple and he found the book of
[1:32:12] Isaiah Isaiah
[1:32:16] 61 all the
[1:32:18] years he was sitting in church
[1:32:22] saying
[1:32:23] nothing hearing all the
[1:32:26] interpretation but this
[1:32:29] day call for
[1:32:31] somebody to read the
[1:32:34] scriptures and here come brother
[1:32:37] Jesus brother Jesus pick up the
[1:32:41] cles and begin to find the prophet
[1:32:45] Isaiah he found the prophet
[1:32:49] Isaiah remember in those days
[1:32:53] it wasn't a book like
[1:32:54] this it was actual
[1:32:58] Scrolls so you have to find the
[1:33:01] Scrolls and open the
[1:33:04] scroll find Isaiah
[1:33:07] 61 he said the spirit of the
[1:33:10] Lord is upon me because the
[1:33:15] Lord anointed
[1:33:17] me good
[1:33:20] Tiding the
[1:33:23] meek had sent me to bind up the broken
[1:33:30] heart claim Liberty the
[1:33:33] captives and the opening of the prison
[1:33:36] them that are
[1:33:37] bound to proclaim the acceptable ear of
[1:33:40] the
[1:33:42] Lord and he
[1:33:44] stopped but then
[1:33:46] Isaiah there's a come there to proclaim
[1:33:50] the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:33:53] Lord and the day of Vengeance of our
[1:33:57] God you may be seated so Jesus
[1:34:01] deliberately
[1:34:04] stopped in the middle of a
[1:34:07] sentence because he
[1:34:09] knew this day of
[1:34:12] vengeance is for our
[1:34:14] time and the scripture we
[1:34:17] read Isaiah said the day of vengeance is
[1:34:21] in my
[1:34:23] heart and the year of my
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:26] redeemed is come in the midst of
[1:34:31] judgment God bringing forth
[1:34:34] Redemption isn't that something
[1:34:37] else oh glory to God and you know when
[1:34:41] you start to talk about
[1:34:44] judgment people get nervous and
[1:34:47] frightened because in the early
[1:34:50] church it had anas and
[1:34:54] saf they sold their goods and so
[1:34:57] on and brother anas
[1:34:59] came and Peter stood
[1:35:02] there and said is this
[1:35:05] all he said
[1:35:07] yeah say but but that's not
[1:35:10] true you light of the Holy
[1:35:13] Ghost they didn't
[1:35:15] understand that the
[1:35:18] snake that was in Peter's
[1:35:20] heart
[1:35:22] got
[1:35:26] firebombed God blow out the snake out of
[1:35:28] Peter
[1:35:31] heart put a throne
[1:35:34] there and God was sitting on
[1:35:38] it
[1:35:40] outside was the same brother
[1:35:43] Peter but
[1:35:45] inside was God
[1:35:48] himself Oh Glory to God the same Peter
[1:35:50] was
[1:35:52] that Deni
[1:35:54] Jesus the Same
[1:35:56] Peter that did what he
[1:35:59] did he was carrying
[1:36:03] God now the wife
[1:36:05] came and the wife they ask her but you

[1:36:19] wife she knew her husband was a
[1:36:23] rascal she didn't have to support his
[1:36:28] lies but she do the same
[1:36:31] thing and she fell dead they packed her
[1:36:35] out the Bible said no man joined
[1:36:41] them God added to the
[1:36:45] church as would be
[1:36:47] saved now listen to this
[1:36:49] carefully it's not that God want to
[1:36:52] judge them in that way you
[1:36:55] know God was trying to protect the Bride
[1:36:57] of that
[1:36:59] day do you understand that they were

[1:44:09] years the message was to come to the
[1:44:14] ACT Noah believe

[1:45:22] in when he's brought his family
[1:45:25] in the Bible say and God shut the

[1:46:00] door couldn't open the
[1:46:03] door stopped

[1:48:24] there so you're not going to be over
[1:48:26] there because over there so
[1:48:30] Believers not
[1:48:32] doubters so now is the time to get a
[1:48:34] character
[1:48:37] change and that's why Peter said given
[1:48:40] all
[1:48:43] diligence
[1:48:45] virtue knowledge temper all these things
[1:48:49] here it's
[1:48:50] it's a life it's a
[1:48:52] change but call it blood
[1:48:57] transfusion take your blood
[1:49:00] out and put the blood of Jesus
[1:49:02] in and it brings the faith of
[1:49:06] Jesus not your
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:09] faith not your faith the faith of
[1:49:13] Jesus the virtue of
[1:49:16] Jesus the temperance the patience of
[1:49:19] Jesus
[1:49:21] praise the name of the Lord but Bram
[1:49:25] when atomic
[1:49:26] bombs and people are
[1:49:29] scared and signs of flying
[1:49:33] sorces yeah he's
[1:49:36] prophesying let the
[1:49:38] people let that little
[1:49:41] FL that little
[1:49:44] Remnant God will give that
[1:49:48] Elijah let that little remn go to
[1:49:50] calling out on
[1:49:53] God Watch What
[1:49:55] Happens there will be a national
[1:49:59] Showdown prophecy now there will be a
[1:50:03] power that they have never seen
[1:50:08] before the trouble of it
[1:50:11] is this time is going to be too late for
[1:50:14] them the doors will be
[1:50:17] closed do you see where we are going
[1:50:21] identifying to
[1:50:23] you what is about to
[1:50:25] happen the Bible call it the times of
[1:50:28] the
[1:50:30] Gentiles the Bible call until the
[1:50:32] fullness of the Gentiles come
[1:50:35] in when the Jews told Jesus on the
[1:50:39] cross may your blood be upon us and our
[1:50:44] children God scatter
[1:50:47] them the Judgment of God scattered the
[1:50:49] Jews
[1:50:52] all over the world but in the
[1:50:56] 60s they started get a desire to go back
[1:51:00] home and God used
[1:51:04] Hitler Hitler he killed 6 million
[1:51:09] Jews and the prophet said it was the
[1:51:11] gentle hand of
[1:51:14] Jehovah guiding them back to the
[1:51:16] promised
[1:51:18] land
[1:51:21] and
[1:51:22] Stalin evil
[1:51:24] men were
[1:51:27] used drive them back to the promised
[1:51:30] land that they could be a
[1:51:33] nation because Jesus like
[1:51:36] Joseph have to appear to his
[1:51:40] Brethren but before God goes to the
[1:51:45] Jews has to close off the Gentile
[1:51:48] age
[1:51:51] now the Jews was cut
[1:51:54] off that we could be grafted
[1:51:57] in so
[1:51:59] we have to be grateful to
[1:52:02] God the Bible said he came onto his
[1:52:06] own his own receive him
[1:52:08] not and many has receed him to them he
[1:52:11] give power to become the
[1:52:14] sons so when the Jews rejected
[1:52:18] Jesus the gospel turned to the
[1:52:21] Gentiles and now out of the
[1:52:25] Gentiles Jesus gets a
[1:52:29] bride that's you here this
[1:52:32] morning can you get it now so
[1:52:36] Noah was a sign of Deliverance to his
[1:52:40] people and a sign of judgment to the
[1:52:42] Lost World the
[1:52:45] unbeliever listen to this the very
[1:52:48] Waters
[1:52:50] that choke the world and drunk the
[1:52:53] world was the only means of saving
[1:52:58] Noah the only thing that could save him
[1:53:01] was the
[1:53:04] judgment and the only thing that could
[1:53:06] save the church today is the
[1:53:10] Judgment the
[1:53:12] Judgment yes huh
[1:53:18] Hallelujah
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:25] so Noah's
[1:53:27] message was the
[1:53:29] mechanics the rain that
[1:53:32] fall was the
[1:53:34] Dynamics and the AR floated isn't that
[1:53:37] right praise God let me get home here
[1:53:40] now on the
[1:53:42] token he said the blood was a token or
[1:53:47] identification the blood identif the
[1:53:50] worship had slain the
[1:53:55] lamb and he was not
[1:53:57] ashamed he wanted everybody to see
[1:54:01] it so the blood on the door
[1:54:06] post was evidence that the lamb had
[1:54:10] died God told
[1:54:12] them not if you're a Jew I'm going to
[1:54:15] pass over
[1:54:17] you not if you m say I'm going to pass
[1:54:20] over
[1:54:22] you he said when I see the
[1:54:26] blood not when the pastor see
[1:54:29] anything have nothing to do with the
[1:54:32] pastor no when I see the
[1:54:36] blood Moses told them take the
[1:54:40] blood and put it on the door
[1:54:43] post anybody
[1:54:46] passing they can see
[1:54:48] blood Oh Glory to
[1:54:51] God some people
[1:54:53] think they don't want they want to be a
[1:54:56] Christian

[1:54:59] secretly you can't be a secret
[1:55:03] Christian a Christian is a public
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:08] life he said the blood the token must be
[1:55:15] applied or the Covenant is not an
[1:55:18] effect
[1:55:20] no you have to apply the
[1:55:22] token before
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:26] judgment you have to apply the
[1:55:29] token before the wrath of God pass
[1:55:31] through the
[1:55:34] land before it
[1:55:36] happens I'm still reading for there is
[1:55:39] coming a
[1:55:40] time when you will not be able to apply
[1:55:43] the

[1:55:51] it you apply it to your
[1:55:54] home you apply it to your

[1:56:08] distance you hear people
[1:56:11] screaming and the noise getting closer
[1:56:13] and closer and
