[24:03] amen god bless you thanks for coming out
[24:05] tonight
[24:06] and if you have your bibles i like to
[24:09] read two portions of scripture
[24:11] uh from luke chapter 22 we want to read
[24:13] verse 39 to 46
[24:16] and also in john chapter 15 when i read
[24:18] from verse 1 to 8.
[24:21] luke chapter 22 reading from verse 39
[24:27] this is jesus in the garden of god
[24:30] gethsemane and he came out and went and
[24:33] he was warned
[24:34] to the mount of olives and his disciples
[24:36] also followed him
[24:38] and when he was at the place he said
[24:40] unto them pray
[24:41] that you enter nuts into temptation and
[24:44] he was withdrawn from them about a stone
[24:46] cast
[24:47] kneeled on and prayed saying father if
[24:49] thou
[24:50] be willing remove this cup from me
[24:53] nevertheless not my will but thine
[24:57] be done and they appeared an angel unto
[25:00] him
[25:00] from heaven strengthening him
[25:04] and being in agony he prayed more
[25:06] earnestly
[25:07] and his sweat was it were great drops of
[25:09] blood falling down to the ground
[25:12] and when he rose up from prayer and was
[25:15] come to his disciples
[25:16] he found them sleeping for sorrow
[25:20] he said unto them why sleepy
[25:23] rise and pray we see enter into
[25:26] temptation
[25:27] and reading from saint john 15 verse 1 i
[25:30] am the true vine
[25:31] my father is the husband man every
[25:33] branch in me
[25:34] that bear it not fruit he take it away
[25:36] and every branch that beared fruit
[25:38] he pushed it that he may bring forth
[25:40] more fruit
[25:41] now you are clean through the word which
[25:43] i have spoken unto you abide in me and i
[25:45] knew as a branch cannot be a fruit of
[25:47] itself
[25:48] except it abide in the vine no more can
[25:52] ye except you abide in me i am divine
[25:55] yeah the branches
[25:56] either abide it in me and i in him the
[25:58] same bringing forth much fruit
[26:00] for without me you can do nothing if a
[26:03] man i bite not in me
[26:04] is cast photos that merge and is
[26:06] withered
[26:07] and then gather them and cast them into
[26:10] the fire and they're burned if you abide
[26:12] in me
[26:13] my words abide in you you shall ask what
[26:15] you will
[26:16] and it shall be done unto you hearing is
[26:18] my father glorified
[26:20] that you bear much fruit so shall you be
[26:22] my disciples may god
[26:23] bless this word you may be seated or
[26:25] praise the name of the lord tonight
[26:28] uh i'm so grateful to be here tonight
[26:31] it's always a privilege to come into
[26:33] god's presence unto his spirit
[26:36] amen under the anointing of god and
[26:39] uh i have a title tonight not my will
[26:43] but thine be done and we certainly
[26:46] appreciate the message on sunday
[26:48] have we done enough have we done enough
[26:51] that was
[26:52] such a blessing to me and i um i like
[26:55] that action word have we done not have
[26:57] we heard
[26:58] enough have we done
[27:01] enough now this same scripture in
[27:04] matthew i just want to read it this is
[27:06] we read it from and that's why i get it
[27:08] from not my will but that be done
[27:10] but in matthew 26 36 to 44 jesus said
[27:13] then come at jesus
[27:14] with them under a place called
[27:16] gethsemane and send disciples city here
[27:18] while i go and pray under so he took
[27:20] with him peter and two sons of zebedee
[27:22] and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[27:25] then city unto them my
[27:26] soul is exceeding sorrowful
[27:31] even unto death this is the same jesus
[27:33] that multiplied
[27:34] bread and fish same jesus that turned
[27:36] water into wine
[27:37] same jesus that raised the dead this is
[27:39] jesus saying that my soul
[27:41] suffer even unto death tarry here and
[27:44] watch with me
[27:46] he invited them to watch with him and he
[27:48] went a little further
[27:49] and fell on his face and prayed saying
[27:52] oh my father if it is be possible let
[27:55] this god pass from me
[27:57] nevertheless not as i will but there's
[27:59] all wilt and he comment on the disciples
[28:01] and found him asleep and said unto peter
[28:03] what could you not watch with me one
[28:05] hour
[28:07] watch and pray that you enter not into
[28:09] temptation
[28:10] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[28:13] flesh is weak he went
[28:14] away again the second time and prayed
[28:16] saying oh my father
[28:18] if this cup may not pass from me except
[28:20] i drink it thy will be done
[28:23] and he came and found them asleep again
[28:25] for their eyes were heavy
[28:27] and he left them and went again and
[28:29] prayed at two time
[28:31] saying the same words so much for
[28:33] encouragement so much for partners and
[28:35] friends and people who
[28:36] backing you up and supporting you when
[28:39] you come to this spot
[28:41] you know sometime ago i preached we'll
[28:43] drive you to calvary and then to the
[28:44] rapture
[28:45] but before you hit calvary there's a
[28:47] stop and get so many
[28:49] there's a journey to this garden called
[28:51] gethsemane
[28:53] and let's let's go to tonight
[28:57] nowhere is adoption identified
[29:01] with with a man's sermon teaching
[29:04] preaching or revelation
[29:08] nowhere in the message you could ever
[29:11] find
[29:11] a man's teaching revelation
[29:15] human information knowledge bringing him
[29:18] to adoption
[29:21] adoption has always been tied to
[29:23] behavior
[29:25] tutoring child training
[29:28] sanctification obedience to the father's
[29:31] will
[29:32] pleasing the father and about the
[29:34] father's
[29:35] business this word will
[29:40] means to want or to choose
[29:43] you have to want it you have to have a
[29:46] desire for the will of god
[29:48] to be in your life to influence your
[29:51] life
[29:52] to take a upon your life
[29:55] and people realize and sometimes it's
[29:57] too late that the choices they made
[30:00] they pay the penalty and price of the
[30:02] decisions
[30:03] that they made so we say the seeds of
[30:06] today the fruit of the more disease of
[30:08] the day
[30:08] today is the first day of the rest of
[30:10] your life you can't change your past
[30:12] your past is what it is
[30:14] but what you do today or tonight or this
[30:17] very hour
[30:18] could affect your future so you are
[30:20] still in a position
[30:22] to make decisions decisions
[30:26] right decisions hallelujah i love him
[30:29] tonight
[30:30] i believe that this is what lord want me
[30:33] to share with you tonight
[30:35] hallelujah not my will but dying be done
[30:39] done to do it because you could know the
[30:42] will and don't do it
[30:44] the world could be revealed to you and
[30:45] you don't do it you still have to come
[30:48] to terms
[30:49] not just to catch the will but to do
[30:53] the will hallelujah
[30:56] now we read that scripture if you
[30:58] abandon me my words abide with you
[31:00] let me just go back just a little bit
[31:01] dear this part here i'm the true vine
[31:05] my father is a husband man every branch
[31:07] i mean that they're not fruity take it
[31:09] away
[31:09] that is no if or no but
[31:13] so what i want to say to you tonight you
[31:15] have no choice but to produce
[31:18] the object of the gospel is not that we
[31:21] in the church
[31:23] the object here is that we be a fruit
[31:26] he's very plain there's no if it's not
[31:28] but or maybe or any message he don't
[31:30] have that
[31:31] he said my father is a husband man these
[31:33] have no satanists here
[31:35] this year they're not in their business
[31:37] they don't need every temptation they're
[31:39] not that
[31:39] you know this is something completely
[31:41] out of that satan not in a picture here
[31:43] tonight
[31:45] this has to do with i am the true vine
[31:48] my father is the husband man
[31:50] every branch in me that bear it not
[31:52] fruit he take it away
[31:54] every branch that buried fruit he purged
[31:56] to bring forth more fruit
[31:59] oh glory to god i see no devil inside of
[32:01] there is not lucy inside of there like
[32:03] just you
[32:04] and god you and the word you and your
[32:07] desire to be fruit bearing
[32:09] oh glory to god and the food to be food
[32:11] bearing there's a condition
[32:13] and the condition is if you are bad in
[32:15] me
[32:16] and my words are bad in you you could
[32:18] talk and yap and say what you want to
[32:20] say but if you
[32:21] abide in me and my words abide in you
[32:23] then you're in a position to ask
[32:25] whatever
[32:25] you will and it shall not maybe
[32:29] not perhaps it shall be done unto you or
[32:32] give the lord a shout
[32:33] nobody could keep you the bride from
[32:35] that nobody could keep
[32:37] individuals from that that is your word
[32:40] that is your seed
[32:41] that is what your rays are for and then
[32:44] he closed off with hearing is my father
[32:45] glorified
[32:48] that you bear much fruit so shall you be
[32:50] my disciples
[32:52] hearing is my father glorifying so if
[32:56] you want to glorify
[32:57] father is not just fruit or more fruit
[32:59] is much fruit
[33:01] so god in the improving business the
[33:02] multiplying business
[33:04] the progressing business the add-in to
[33:06] business oh gloria
[33:08] you can't give god back what you he give
[33:10] you you have to add
[33:11] more an attitude you have to have some
[33:12] interest on top of it
[33:14] that's your favorite virtue of knowledge
[33:15] you have to put some things and pile it
[33:17] up
[33:17] on top of that who praise them all
[33:21] you love him tonight so if you don't
[33:23] bear fruit
[33:24] you will be cut off so the objective
[33:28] is to come to spiritual immaturity to be
[33:31] a fruit
[33:33] because a new shoot can be a fruit it's
[33:35] not mature yet
[33:37] it's not ready yet it's not ripe yet
[33:40] isn't that right so god's purpose for us
[33:44] is to be a fruit isn't that right
[33:48] not producing is not an option
[33:52] you will be cut off and the evidence of
[33:55] abiding is the fact
[33:56] that you can ask what you will and it
[33:59] shall be done to you
[34:01] let's continue psalms 40
[34:04] jesus psalms 40 sacrifice and offering
[34:07] though this not desire
[34:09] man ears has doubt opened burned
[34:12] offering and sin offering
[34:14] has thou not required then said i lo i
[34:16] come
[34:17] in the volume of the book it is written
[34:19] of me i delight
[34:22] to do thy will oh my god ye
[34:25] thy law is within my heart
[34:29] it has to be in your heart scale upside
[34:32] brought wood as it was in my heart
[34:34] it has to be in your heart to even want
[34:37] the will of god for your life
[34:39] because i'm not doing anybody else no
[34:40] your wife your husband children
[34:42] neighbor church the elder deacon pastor
[34:44] doesn't do with him
[34:45] that has to do with you because the will
[34:48] is personal
[34:49] you have a like personal place in christ
[34:52] the will for your life that's for you
[34:54] alone
[34:55] you alone can hold the script of that
[34:57] you alone can hold your revelation of
[34:59] that
[34:59] i can't give you that revelation god
[35:01] have to give you that revelation and you
[35:02] have to find out the will of god for
[35:04] your life and go and do it
[35:06] not just hear it and speak it back but
[35:09] get the job
[35:11] done john 4
[35:14] 4 30 then went out of the city and came
[35:17] at
[35:17] him and in the meanwhile his disciples
[35:20] prayed him saying master eat
[35:22] and he said to them i have meat to eat
[35:23] that you know not of
[35:25] and therefore said the disciples one to
[35:27] another had any man brought him or to
[35:29] eat
[35:29] and jesus said unto them my need
[35:33] is to do the will of him that sent me
[35:35] and to finish his work
[35:38] so jesus was passionate unto his purpose
[35:41] that he was raised up for he even said i
[35:44] always do that which
[35:44] pleases my father his father already
[35:48] said this is my son in whom i am
[35:51] well pleased so it was a harmony and
[35:53] agreement
[35:54] because jesus he stood with his father's
[35:58] word
[35:59] isn't that right he said now watch my
[36:02] meat is to do the will of him has sent
[36:03] me and to finish his work
[36:05] say not ye there are four months and yet
[36:07] they come at harvest
[36:08] behold i said to you lift up your eyes
[36:10] and look on the field
[36:12] for their right already to harvest
[36:15] jesus was here confronting the greatest
[36:19] test that he had ever had gethsemane
[36:23] lead just before him wear that once and
[36:26] final
[36:26] all sufficient tests must come
[36:29] when the burden of the entire world laid
[36:32] upon his blessed shoulder
[36:34] there was no one in all heaven or earth
[36:36] could ever stood it
[36:38] but him and to know this is the burden
[36:41] you know
[36:42] and to know that all of the sins
[36:46] past sins present since
[36:50] future sins rested upon this decision
[36:56] let me say it again all sins past
[37:00] present future rested upon decision and
[37:03] it was one of the greatest
[37:04] victories that christ ever won or
[37:08] proved his great messiahship as when he
[37:10] said to god
[37:11] not my will thine be done that was
[37:14] the greatest victory he ever won
[37:17] not cast no devils not multiplying bread
[37:20] and fish
[37:21] not doing any kind of mind he works he
[37:23] fell on his face
[37:25] and prayed and that was
[37:29] greatest victory hallelujah
[37:32] it was one of the greatest victory that
[37:34] christ ever won or
[37:36] proved his great message as when he said
[37:38] to god not my will then be done
[37:40] that was the greatest victory ever won
[37:42] all the demons of torment was a wrong to
[37:45] tempt him
[37:46] and the triumph and when we get right
[37:48] with god
[37:49] when our hearts become pure and the holy
[37:52] spirit
[37:53] has taken his place in our hearts it's
[37:55] the most glorious thing to have a
[37:56] testament
[37:57] [Music]
[38:00] hallelujah the bible said our testings
[38:02] and trials are more precious to us than
[38:04] sylvan goal
[38:05] of this world so we should be thankful
[38:08] gethsemane he went a little further i
[38:11] like that part
[38:12] there's a whole message myself he went a
[38:14] little further sometimes you have to go
[38:16] a little further
[38:18] further beyond the noise further beyond
[38:21] the family
[38:22] further beyond the voice of the wife or
[38:24] the voice of the husband or the voice
[38:25] the children the voice of competences
[38:28] neighbors
[38:29] go further are you prepared to go to the
[38:31] freezer
[38:32] the wise version did they went for you
[38:35] don't get extra oil
[38:36] the bride will do more i believe with
[38:40] all my heart
[38:41] he went a little further then we find
[38:44] out
[38:46] i'll just skip that little bit if you
[38:47] make a mistake some woman make a mistake
[38:49] some man made a mistake some boy or girl
[38:51] made a mistake don't sink
[38:53] scream out and disappear lord save me or
[38:56] perish
[38:57] get desperate about it god will hear you
[38:59] he always he has a desperate soul
[39:01] that's what i'm trying to tell you about
[39:04] our dear lord jesus himself
[39:06] in the world greatest battleground
[39:07] gethsemane he cried out in despair
[39:09] should he take the sins of the world or
[39:11] should he just remain on earth with his
[39:12] beloved disciples
[39:14] what he wanted to do but watch his
[39:16] humility
[39:17] as he humbled himself not my will but
[39:19] then be done humble himself to the word
[39:22] the promised word of the god of heaven
[39:25] notice then
[39:26] he went a little further and he went a
[39:28] little further
[39:29] how much more ought we to go a little
[39:31] further
[39:32] and notice the scripture said in luke he
[39:34] prayed earnestly
[39:36] brother sister if jesus had to pray
[39:38] earnestly
[39:39] how much more have we got to pray
[39:41] earnestly if christ the god of heaven
[39:43] made flesh had to pray earnestly then
[39:45] how much more we
[39:46] sinner saved by grace but earnestly if
[39:49] the decisions
[39:51] and this is your thing about the weight
[39:53] how we interpret
[39:54] how we take decisions how we make
[39:57] decisions
[39:57] how we go about choosing and making
[40:00] we're going to do this we're going to do
[40:01] that
[40:01] it's so very important oh hallelujah if
[40:04] the decision
[40:06] prays god throw the son of god into
[40:07] despair what will it do to you and i
[40:10] desperately we must cry oh
[40:13] god are you ready tonight the spirit
[40:16] left him
[40:17] in the garden of gethsemane
[40:22] he had to die a man
[40:26] so that was a real grit and grime
[40:30] and that started off with having a
[40:32] desire
[40:33] and making a choice to do god's will
[40:37] because he had his own will that's why
[40:40] he said
[40:40] not my will but dying
[40:43] be done we could do what you want to do
[40:46] go away i want to go read where you want
[40:48] agreed meet who you want to be
[40:50] choose whatever friends you want to have
[40:52] go and do this and go that's your will
[40:54] that's your choice
[40:55] but his will is different remember you
[40:58] say my thoughts are not your thoughts
[40:59] my ways are not your ways so when the
[41:02] revelation of his will begin to come
[41:03] down to you which would
[41:04] will it gonna begin it gonna start it's
[41:07] already started
[41:09] but more will come to you because god
[41:10] has to bring us to a spot
[41:12] and to a place not just us as a group
[41:16] but you as an individual hallelujah
[41:19] nobody can put you in the kingdom you
[41:21] know
[41:21] do you have the press the kingdom is
[41:24] preached but you have to press
[41:25] your way into the kingdom of god do you
[41:28] believe that tonight
[41:29] hallelujah the spirit left him in the
[41:32] garden of gethsemane
[41:33] you have to die a man remember friends
[41:35] he didn't have to do it
[41:36] that was god anointed that flesh which
[41:38] was human flesh he didn't
[41:40] he went up there as god he would have
[41:42] never died that kind of debt but he
[41:43] can't kill god
[41:45] but remember he went dear with you in
[41:47] him
[41:48] and god had never separated the bride
[41:50] from the groom so when god looked down
[41:52] upon the body of christ he saw both male
[41:54] and female
[41:55] it was all redeemed in one body oh glory
[41:58] to god or his representation
[42:00] in the garden of gethsemane was also
[42:03] representing you
[42:04] so if he could make it so can you if he
[42:06] went through his get sam and he soaked
[42:08] and you
[42:09] because just as he went to calvary you
[42:10] have yours
[42:12] and you are what you all get 72 by the
[42:14] decisions and choices you make
[42:16] even tonight oh glory to god hallelujah
[42:20] he saw what male and female it was all
[42:21] redeemed in that one buddy
[42:23] they are one same word same word spoke
[42:25] the groom speaks the bride
[42:27] how can the bride come and fail to
[42:29] manifest everything that promised of him
[42:31] and the groom come he wouldn't be the
[42:33] bride it wouldn't be the bride
[42:34] when he did everything even to proven it
[42:36] by risen from the dead
[42:38] afterwards the bride have to do
[42:41] the same thing have to be the exactly
[42:43] the same word
[42:44] she would be in the last days oh glory
[42:47] to god hallelujah
[42:49] do you believe that so what the elder
[42:51] says when they say who is worthy to take
[42:53] the book on the loses he's thereof
[42:55] he said it was not worthy they said weep
[42:56] not the land of the tribe of judah
[42:58] has prevailed oh glory to god to take
[43:01] the book isn't that right
[43:02] there was one voice came from the elders
[43:04] saying the four beasts don't reap john
[43:06] oh don't be broken-hearted don't weep
[43:08] for the land of the
[43:10] judah the root of offspring of david has
[43:12] prevailed prevailed me so wrestling
[43:14] overcome
[43:15] and the garden of gethsemane is when the
[43:18] blood dropped down from his face
[43:19] he was overcoming oh glory to god think
[43:22] about that
[43:23] when the bible said revelation in the
[43:25] book of symbols when the bible said the
[43:27] language
[43:27] but judah prevailed it was a god in
[43:29] gethsemane he was beaten that devil
[43:31] oh glory to god by accepting the choice
[43:34] to pay the price on our behalf
[43:36] oh that's why we should be praising him
[43:38] tonight that's why we'll be
[43:39] thanking him tonight that's how the book
[43:41] gets open that's why we could go back to
[43:43] the book of authority and dominion
[43:45] all glory to god that's why we could
[43:47] claim our redemptive rights
[43:49] because this son that was worthy he
[43:51] stepped forward to pay the price oh
[43:54] glory was a blood price
[43:55] and he had to make that decision oh
[43:58] glory to god hallelujah you have to make
[44:00] your decision
[44:02] oh glory to god i see your loved ones
[44:03] and family delivered do we believe that

[44:57] to behave
[44:58] ourselves and act correcting ourselves
[45:01] and bringing the members of our body
[45:04] into the discipline to the word

[45:08] present day at the approaching of the
[45:09] lord jesus

[46:02] my hands
[46:02] his eyes is my eyes and your eyes
[46:05] because he's a spirit
[46:06] but he can work to us to manifest and to
[46:09] do his will
[46:10] what god wants to do with the church
[46:13] tonight
[46:14] he wants to do with an individual is to
[46:17] find somebody the holy spirit is
[46:18] searching
[46:19] to find men he can take him out to a
[46:22] certain place

[46:42] won't go to church look what condition
[46:44] the church is in
[46:46] so the condition the church is in and
[46:47] all the kind of misbehavior and whatnot
[46:49] god can't put no gifts and powers on
[46:51] that
[46:52] something has to happen to get the
[46:54] church in condition
[46:56] but there's a prophecy hanging over that
[46:58] that the church will come in condition
[47:00] oh glory to god the condition of the
[47:02] word so if god can't do it to the body
[47:04] oh glory to god he will pick out
[47:07] individuals

[47:11] a revival he will take individuals

[47:33] and mercy
[47:34] i was wretched and miserable and poor
[47:37] and blind
[47:38] and by the grace of god he has healed me
[47:40] and i'm strong and healthy by the grace
[47:41] of god
[47:42] i have good acts i sight i have eat
[47:44] drink whatever i have need of
[47:46] he never promised me to supply my wants
[47:48] my knees and if
[47:49] i am cast away at that day and i cannot
[47:52] see where i would be but if i knew that
[47:54] i was wrong
[47:55] and god was chose me to be wrong i would
[47:58] want to stay wrong
[48:00] and because that i want to do his will i
[48:03] love him till i want his will to be done

[48:40] god

[48:59] and he'll they will have his potentials
[49:02] for he is their head and they are
[49:04] subjects to his head
[49:05] his headship notice what harmony jesus
[49:08] never did anything
[49:09] until he seen the father the father
[49:11] showed him that harmony between god and

[54:08] oh glory to god and jesus knew the time
[54:10] was at hand for him to step forward
[54:12] to be identified by his witness ministry
[54:15] and when that dynamics came upon him
[54:16] nobody see it but john
[54:18] he saw a dove the one upon whom you see
[54:20] the dog staying and remaining that's the
[54:22] one
[54:22] nobody else saw it and jesus was just
[54:25] walking
[54:25] and led by the spirits into the
[54:27] wilderness to overcome that devil
[54:29] oh glory to god the lust of the eyes the
[54:31] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[54:33] and he overcome lucifer by himself in
[54:36] the wilderness without any demonstration
[54:38] of power
[54:39] only it is written it is written to
[54:41] prove you could stay with the word
[54:42] and overcome by the word oh give the
[54:44] lord a shout in the house
[54:46] oh glory to god the anointing was off of
[54:48] him he was tasting the test and facing
[54:51] it
[54:51] without any set of power and he gave the
[54:53] devil a amen a bruised face
[54:55] when he finished with him in the
[54:57] wilderness and then the bible said he
[54:59] returned who glory gave the lord a shout
[55:01] tonight
[55:02] he returned in the power of the spirit
[55:05] oh glory to god the spirit hit him come
[55:08] on for him
[55:08] send him to the wilderness and come back
[55:10] upon him vindicating him but the spirit
[55:12] went and disguised yourself as the word
[55:14] to give the word test to jesus
[55:16] and you overcome the by the word itself
[55:19] it is written it is written
[55:20] it is also written here this big bomb
[55:23] here they
[55:24] do only his will as a bride
[55:28] only israel
[55:31] no one can persuade them
[55:34] different they have thus
[55:37] saith the lord or they keep still they
[55:41] then they will do the works of god
[55:44] for it is himself in them
[55:48] continuing his word to fulfill as he did
[55:51] complete in his days
[55:53] all things when he was here he did not
[55:55] complete all thing he was here
[55:56] for it was not time yet so he's going to
[55:58] finish the work
[55:59] in his wife all glory to god
[56:03] so brother brahm you will see here oh my
[56:06] hallelujah
[56:08] oh you love him tonight and then he's
[56:10] talking about adoption he was talking
[56:11] about the purpose
[56:12] is seeing your position in christ seeing
[56:15] it's not something that you just stumble
[56:16] into
[56:17] something that you merited somewhere but
[56:19] it's what god did for you himself
[56:21] not that you were so good and you went
[56:23] to church one night and some porn
[56:25] brother led you to the altar
[56:26] it wasn't that it was god before the
[56:29] foundation
[56:30] of the world predestinated you to eating
[56:32] a life
[56:33] and when you get there that day no
[56:35] wonder 14
[56:36] 24 elders laid on their crowns everybody
[56:38] laid down their crowns everyone fell on
[56:39] their face they didn't have one thing
[56:41] they could say
[56:44] no preacher no elder no nothing all
[56:47] praise to the lamb
[56:48] god will gather in him all things that
[56:50] that day
[56:51] oh how if we only know and recognize who
[56:54] he was
[56:55] oh you say we start with the eight verse
[56:57] wherein he has a boundary towards us
[56:59] and all wisdom and prudence having been
[57:01] known unto us the mystery of israel he's
[57:03] quoted from ephesians
[57:04] the mysteries of israel now remember how
[57:07] we hung onto that
[57:08] how many was here this morning let's see
[57:10] how we stuck on that the mystery of his
[57:13] will
[57:13] no it's not just a little thing then
[57:17] it's a mystery god's will
[57:20] is a mystery and each
[57:23] man has to seek out
[57:27] the will of god for his or herself
[57:32] god's mystery let's go around again
[57:35] god's will
[57:36] is a mystery and each
[57:40] man has to seek out the will of god
[57:44] for his or herself god's mystery
[57:47] so you can't claim god mystery is for
[57:50] you to be in church
[57:52] you have to know why you come to church
[57:54] if all i'm saying no you want deeper
[57:56] than that
[57:56] that you're going to church you want a
[57:58] little more than that what god called
[57:59] you
[58:00] unto because jesus wow
[58:04] i was thinking about that quote where
[58:05] bomb said the spirit left him in
[58:06] gethsemane i was thinking then all he
[58:09] could rely on of who he was
[58:11] because the anointing but ramos says the
[58:13] help of fate
[58:14] god could drop your notion upon you and
[58:15] help your faith tonight
[58:17] but real faith is a revelation of who
[58:20] you are
[58:22] so when jesus said uh no man eat of thee
[58:25] he knew who he was he cursed the victory
[58:27] that's his real fate he he's saying that
[58:30] because he's feeling anointed
[58:31] and he feels hallelujah no no he don't
[58:34] have to do all of that
[58:35] it's because of who he is he can speak
[58:38] and that's where the bride will come to
[58:40] that we're going to blow the pentecostal
[58:41] mind because they might have waited for
[58:43] another
[58:43] thing and thing and doing this and what
[58:45] kind of sting and rain
[58:47] all kind of carrying on but this bride
[58:49] will just be speaking
[58:50] hallelujah in the authority and the
[58:53] revelation of the faith that is inside
[58:55] of you
[58:56] oh glory to god nothing could stop that
[58:57] you know that's superior that would be
[58:59] god's seeds that'd be god speaking
[59:01] and you wouldn't be saying in jesus name
[59:03] because it would be you would be in
[59:04] jesus
[59:06] when you speak is is his name hallelujah
[59:09] you'll be speaking in his name
[59:11] just a word healed see
[59:15] hallelujah dumb speak
[59:20] that's adopted son that is christ
[59:23] reproduce again you know that is the
[59:25] reproduction
[59:26] of jerusalem oh glory to god hallelujah
[59:31] oh praise god you love him tonight
[59:34] hallelujah
[59:35] let's continue my my my my mind
[59:38] and when he was um teaching them to pray
[59:42] matthew 6 he said after this manner
[59:43] therefore pray he
[59:45] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[59:46] be thy name
[59:48] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[59:51] earth as it is in heaven
[59:53] that's the first thing he said your
[59:54] kingdom come we're expecting that
[59:55] kingdom to come
[59:57] we're letting you know that your will
[59:58] will be done and eat as this is
[1:00:01] revealed in heaven oh my give us this
[1:00:03] day our daily bread
[1:00:05] and forgive us our debts as we forget we
[1:00:08] give our debtors
[1:00:09] and neither start into temptation but
[1:00:12] deliver us
[1:00:14] from all evil for thine is the kingdom
[1:00:17] the power and the glory forever and ever
[1:00:18] amen for if you forgive men that
[1:00:20] trespasses
[1:00:21] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:00:23] you but if you forgive not mend the
[1:00:25] trespasses neither will your heavenly
[1:00:26] father forgive your trespasses
[1:00:30] and god put brotherly kindness right at
[1:00:32] the top
[1:00:33] right on this age when the prophet said
[1:00:36] the bride will display the blood of her
[1:00:38] age
[1:00:38] so therefore the blood of brotherly
[1:00:40] kindness will be the voice of the
[1:00:42] bride's voice in this hour
[1:00:44] god put it there he put it there and put
[1:00:46] faith to be there
[1:00:47] because our heart turned back to the
[1:00:48] fate of the fathers so right on top of
[1:00:51] their brotherly kindness
[1:00:52] and then our fate is based upon
[1:00:54] forgiveness so it's
[1:00:56] still come where there has to be a
[1:00:57] manifestation of the spirit of
[1:00:59] forgiveness upon a bride
[1:01:01] that will drive you to forgive and drop
[1:01:03] your oaths and to be humble
[1:01:06] knowing that faith to pull down the cap
[1:01:09] the thing to take us out
[1:01:11] the thing that can't feel faith to do
[1:01:13] that is based upon this
[1:01:15] vigorously talking about here so god
[1:01:17] allow a lot of issues
[1:01:18] family issues church issues business
[1:01:21] issues all kind of issues
[1:01:22] over the years to build up and grow and
[1:01:24] everything else and people take the
[1:01:25] going down the road
[1:01:26] thinking they could go on their own it's
[1:01:28] not working that way yeah there is one
[1:01:30] lord
[1:01:31] there is one fate there is one body
[1:01:34] all praise the name of the lord do you
[1:01:36] believe that tonight
[1:01:38] so jesus did the works of his father
[1:01:42] because the father was in him that
[1:01:45] is why the works was done because the
[1:01:48] father was in the sun do you believe
[1:01:50] that
[1:01:51] he was the incarnate god and that god
[1:01:53] the father which is the father of jesus
[1:01:56] christ the great spirit
[1:01:57] dwelt in the fullness of his power in
[1:02:00] jesus christ
[1:02:01] which was the tabernacle of god made
[1:02:04] flesh
[1:02:04] and dwelt on earth representing the word
[1:02:08] and jesus was the word and the bible
[1:02:11] said
[1:02:12] the words in john 1 the word was
[1:02:14] invisible now listen close
[1:02:17] the word was invisible until
[1:02:20] it was made flesh and when the
[1:02:23] and then the word become visible and
[1:02:26] through
[1:02:27] his sacrificial death at calvary and his
[1:02:30] resurrection
[1:02:32] positionally place his church
[1:02:35] in that realm that the same
[1:02:38] invisible god could come
[1:02:41] into the individual and make the world
[1:02:45] visible
[1:02:46] hallelujah i wish my church could get
[1:02:49] that
[1:02:51] if you could see it friends the
[1:02:53] invisible god made visible
[1:02:55] let's see the part again and through his
[1:02:57] sacrificial debt
[1:02:59] at calvary and his resurrection
[1:03:04] positionally place his church in that
[1:03:06] realm
[1:03:07] that the same invisible god could come
[1:03:10] into the individual
[1:03:12] and make the word visible how
[1:03:16] sin john 15 if he
[1:03:20] abide in me and my word
[1:03:23] abide in you you can ask what you will
[1:03:29] and it shall be done unto you
[1:03:32] for when omnipotent speak
[1:03:35] the miraculous have to take place
[1:03:40] because omnipotence is god himself
[1:03:43] so a man can't claim to be veiling this
[1:03:46] omnipotence and there is no miraculous
[1:03:49] that doesn't even make sense once
[1:03:53] omnipotent speak the miraculous
[1:03:58] must not maybe not perhaps
[1:04:03] must i want to say must
[1:04:06] must if omnipotence is speaking
[1:04:10] which is god the word made flesh
[1:04:13] that means the spirit itself the father
[1:04:16] is speaking to the son the word
[1:04:19] hallelujah must take place
[1:04:22] oh glory to god that's why jesus could
[1:04:25] tell his disciples by prophecy
[1:04:28] and by inspiration the same works that i
[1:04:31] do
[1:04:32] shall you do also because it shall come
[1:04:34] to pass
[1:04:35] this word will be abiding in you and my
[1:04:38] father and i
[1:04:40] at that day you shall know because i am
[1:04:42] going to come into you
[1:04:44] and activate the word in you to make you
[1:04:47] reproduce what i did
[1:04:48] you going to do also it is impossible
[1:04:51] for it not to happen
[1:04:52] oh glory to god i come to do thy willow
[1:04:55] god
[1:04:55] as it is written of me in the volume of
[1:04:57] the book and the book was
[1:04:59] unsealed and the volume has been
[1:05:01] unveiled
[1:05:02] that we can know what the will of god is
[1:05:05] to go and do it
[1:05:06] oh you say what we see should make a
[1:05:08] church that will make a revival
[1:05:11] that people should fly from everywhere
[1:05:12] saying the seven thunders that are
[1:05:14] written
[1:05:14] is being made manifest oh glory to god
[1:05:18] we have to make a revival
[1:05:19] a church that will see that they call to
[1:05:21] make this revival
[1:05:23] people don't want it they laugh at it
[1:05:24] that's okay but we're gonna have a
[1:05:26] bright revival
[1:05:28] even a seven thunder revival oh glory to
[1:05:31] god hallelujah i'm almost done believe
[1:05:33] it or not hallelujah
[1:05:35] oh god i'm excited tonight i come to the
[1:05:38] bible of god as the written of me
[1:05:40] glory to god a prophecy came over the
[1:05:42] prophet
[1:05:44] night hallelujah and this is what it was
[1:05:47] february 11 1961 because that was chosen
[1:05:52] the narrow part because that was chosen
[1:05:56] the narrow path the hardaway
[1:06:00] that was walked of your own oh glory to
[1:06:04] god when jesus was wrestling with this
[1:06:06] human spirit
[1:06:06] if it's possible let this god pass it
[1:06:08] not once you pray on those three times
[1:06:11] he was wrestling it's a choice
[1:06:14] hallelujah and sometimes that choice is
[1:06:15] not the devil and the devil and the
[1:06:17] devil is you
[1:06:19] your choice you're choosing
[1:06:22] what you decide you want to read where
[1:06:25] you want to go what you want to say
[1:06:26] how you want to say your choice
[1:06:31] before i say because i was chosen the
[1:06:34] narrow path
[1:06:36] the harder way that was walked
[1:06:40] of your own choosing in other words
[1:06:43] i didn't have to do it i consider and go
[1:06:45] with them if i want to but i stayed with
[1:06:47] the word
[1:06:48] that was picked the correct and precise
[1:06:51] decision
[1:06:52] and it is my way hallelujah
[1:06:56] if you notice it punctuated an underline
[1:06:59] if you notice it wrote in french
[1:07:01] spoken french he said because of this
[1:07:03] momentous decision
[1:07:05] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee
[1:07:10] because of what a momentous
[1:07:14] decision there is power in choice
[1:07:20] not my will but i will be done
