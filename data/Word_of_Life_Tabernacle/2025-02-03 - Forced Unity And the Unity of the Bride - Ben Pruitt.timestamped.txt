[31:19] Genesis 11 and verse 1 Genesis 11
[31:24] And1 and uh kind of continue what we
[31:27] talk talked about this morning but just
[31:29] a little bit different vein as we talk
[31:31] about the unity of the bride and also
[31:34] forced Unity forced unity and contrast
[31:38] that with the unity of the Bride aren't
[31:42] you glad to be Marching In step with the
[31:44] word of the Lord that's where we want to
[31:46] stay right in the perfect will of God
[31:50] Genesis 11
[31:52] And1 says the whole earth was of one
[31:54] language and of one speech and it came
[31:57] to pass fast as they journeyed from the
[31:59] East that they found a plain in the land
[32:01] of Shar and they dwelt there and they
[32:05] said one to another go to let us make
[32:08] brick and burn them thoroughly they had
[32:11] brick for stone and slime they had for
[32:13] Mortar and they said go to let us build
[32:16] us a city and a tower whose top May
[32:20] reach unto Heaven listen to this let us
[32:24] make us a name lest we be scattered
[32:27] abroad
[32:28] upon the face of the whole earth of
[32:29] course you know how the story ended they
[32:31] were confused in their language unable
[32:33] to complete their project and divided
[32:36] all over the face of the earth I pray
[32:38] the Lord with that his Blessing to the
[32:40] word you may be
[32:45] seated if you were to go to a Catholic
[32:48] church and not to knock on the Catholics
[32:51] because there are brother brandom taught
[32:53] us that there are good people among them
[32:56] in that group in that system but the
[32:58] system is
[32:59] rotten right but if you were to go to a
[33:01] Catholic Church in Chicago or in LA or
[33:04] in Rome or anywhere else in the world
[33:07] chances are you would hear the same
[33:09] scripture
[33:10] read and the preacher would be preaching
[33:14] the same thing anywhere you would go uh
[33:18] in Catholic online says it this way is
[33:20] the Catholic Mass the same everywhere in
[33:22] the world and it says the structure of
[33:25] the mass has two parts the Liturgy of
[33:26] the word the Liturgy of the Eucharist so
[33:28] they're very formal in their worship and
[33:31] it says the Liturgy of the word
[33:32] celebrates the word of God we hear one
[33:33] or two readings from the Bible plus a
[33:35] Gospel reading uh and the readings are
[33:38] the same
[33:39] everywhere uh except for some Churches
[33:41] have different feast days the the second
[33:44] part is Liturgy of the Eucharist which
[33:46] they believe that's the literal body and
[33:47] blood of the Lord that they're that
[33:49] they're eating of course we know that's
[33:51] not true we know it's a a symbol of the
[33:54] body and blood of the Lord but they
[33:56] believe that's the literal body and
[33:57] blood of the Lord Lord so they take what
[33:59] they call the mass the the Eucharist and
[34:02] it follows the prayer of the faithful
[34:03] where they celebrate the Lord's
[34:04] sacrifice said this Mass happens
[34:07] everywhere every day in Catholic
[34:08] churches throughout the world and they
[34:11] look at that as one of the greatest
[34:12] aspects of the Catholic Church wherever
[34:14] you go in the world you can attend Mass
[34:16] oh it's the same as it would be if you
[34:18] were at your local Parish so if I'm a
[34:20] Catholic and I stop in a church
[34:21] somewhere in uh overseas uh it may be in
[34:25] a different language but the same exact
[34:27] MTH
[34:28] and what that is is a forced Unity right
[34:31] a forced Unity so if they don't do that
[34:35] if they would deviate from that they
[34:37] would be removed from their position we
[34:39] don't want to ever get that way in the
[34:41] message of the hour but I have a freedom
[34:43] tonight to preach what the Lord lays on
[34:44] my heart a and the ability to preach and
[34:47] maybe brother Jason uh preached this
[34:49] morning from a different text than I did
[34:51] or brother Matt might preach from a
[34:53] different text than what I would but we
[34:55] have a freedom to do that we are not a
[34:57] in a forced Unity but we're under the
[35:00] headship of the word so we don't we
[35:03] don't have to all take the same approach
[35:05] or the same uh the same ideas or
[35:08] anything like that the same opinions but
[35:10] we want a Unity of the word so when they
[35:14] uh built the Tower of Babel they did
[35:15] that for the purpose they said let's
[35:17] make us a name let's create us a city
[35:20] and that city was Babylon which becomes
[35:23] mystery Babylon Revelation chap 17 it
[35:26] said There came one of the seven angels
[35:28] which had the seven vials and talked
[35:30] with me saying unto me come hither I
[35:32] will show unto the the Judgment of the
[35:34] great that sth upon many Waters
[35:36] with whom the kings of the Earth have
[35:38] committed fornication and the
[35:39] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[35:41] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[35:43] he said he carried me away in the spirit
[35:45] Into the Wilderness I saw a woman sit
[35:47] upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of
[35:49] names blasphemy having seven heads and
[35:52] 10
[35:54] horns excuse me the woman was arrayed in
[35:57] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[35:58] gold and precious stones and pearls and
[36:01] she had a golden cup in her hand full of
[36:03] Abominations and filthiness of her
[36:05] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[36:08] name written mystery Babylon the great
[36:11] the mother of harlots and Abominations
[36:13] of the earth now we're all we've been
[36:15] around long enough we know what this is
[36:17] that's that denomination that Roman
[36:19] system right she sat on seven heels it's
[36:22] very apparent from the scripture who she
[36:24] is even the Catholics if you pull up
[36:26] their commentaries tell you that that's
[36:28] Rome even the Catholics will tell you
[36:31] that that's Rome so it's the the
[36:33] Catholic church and her daughters so she
[36:37] has daughters and brother bam taught us
[36:39] that that was the names of blasphemy was
[36:41] the names of the denominations that they
[36:44] had made they made themselves a name but
[36:47] we don't worship under the name of
[36:51] William brandom or the name of Ben prid
[36:53] or the name of Word of Life Tabernacle
[36:56] that's not what we worship under we
[36:58] don't worship under the name of brother
[37:00] so and so's church we worship under the
[37:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in in the
[37:05] place where he put his name which was in
[37:07] Jesus Christ now so that's what we
[37:09] worship under now when Paul instructed
[37:12] Timothy he he never give him a list of
[37:14] scriptures to read right right when you
[37:17] going have to help me preach tonight he
[37:19] he never gave him a a quota of how many
[37:22] scriptures there was never a h a letter
[37:26] from Paul that said Timothy I want you
[37:28] to deal with this scripture um Sunday
[37:31] and this one the next Sunday and this
[37:32] one the next Sunday what did he tell
[37:34] Peter he said I Char or Timothy rather I
[37:36] charge thee therefore before God and the
[37:39] Lord Jesus Christ who will judge the
[37:41] quick the alive and the dead and his
[37:43] appearing in his kingdom preach the word
[37:46] yes he said I'm commanding you to do
[37:48] something preach the word Don't Preach
[37:50] your ideas don't say something different
[37:52] don't come after some new idea preach
[37:54] the word preach what you've been taught
[37:56] in one place he said preach those things
[37:58] that teach those things you've heard of
[37:59] me among many
[38:00] witnesses preach the word preach where
[38:03] we can say it in this day say what's on
[38:05] the tape say say what the tape say say
[38:07] what the messenger said preach the word
[38:10] be instant in season out of season
[38:11] reprove rebuke exort with all
[38:13] longsuffering and Doctrine but there's
[38:15] nobody telling us what to how to do that
[38:18] because that would be a forced Unity
[38:20] right would take us right back into the
[38:22] Catholic church and we don't want that
[38:25] church we want we want to be listen I
[38:27] want to fellowship with everybody but I
[38:29] don't want anybody sitting here and tell
[38:31] me because I believe God's big enough to
[38:33] let me know what you need and to tell me
[38:35] and maybe if I'm not if I'm not tuned in
[38:38] like I should be maybe brother Joel or
[38:39] brother Stewart or one of the other
[38:41] brothers will come by and preach to you
[38:43] and preach exactly what you have need of
[38:45] why because we don't tell people what to
[38:47] preach we're under the leadership of the
[38:49] Holy Ghost sons of God are led by the
[38:51] spirit of
[38:53] God right so we don't want that coming
[38:56] here we want we don't want forced unity
[38:59] in any way shape or
[39:01] form or we'll all listen to the same
[39:03] preacher or the same tape or read the
[39:05] same scriptures or take communion at the
[39:07] same time it's not what the Bible
[39:09] teaches right brother Brandon taught us
[39:12] to be United with the word yeah when
[39:14] brother preach uniting time and sign he
[39:17] preaches this said teach me thy or he
[39:19] reads this as a text Psalms 8611 teach
[39:22] me thy way oh Lord I will walk in thy
[39:25] truth unite my heart heart yes what did
[39:29] the what did what did the messenger come
[39:31] to do to turn the hearts back right so
[39:34] David Cries Out unite My Heart To Fear
[39:37] Thy Name I want my heart to be United I
[39:40] not not a United head not a not a group
[39:43] think not a think like somebody else and
[39:45] have church when everybody else wants me
[39:47] to but let let my heart be
[39:49] United to the word and if my heart is
[39:53] United to the word I won't be deceived I
[39:55] won't be tossed by every window of
[39:57] Doctrine so let me be United with the
[40:00] word whether whether so and so believes
[40:02] it or not whether everybody else is
[40:03] doing it or not if everybody else gives
[40:05] up what am I going to do my heart's been
[40:07] United with the word and if everybody
[40:09] else leaves the message I can't leave
[40:11] why because my heart is united with the
[40:13] word it's not my head it's not just my
[40:17] thinking but my heart
[40:20] yes oh my that's what I want said unite
[40:23] my heart yes now brother manister we
[40:26] know the holy Holy Ghost is here we know
[40:29] the Holy Ghost is life oh I believe that
[40:32] tonight but Brethren do you realize it's
[40:34] only working in a stump no he's talking
[40:36] that Pentecostal church that unrestored
[40:39] church right or partially restored
[40:41] church he said did you think that you
[40:43] realize that's a part my friend the
[40:45] spirit is only working a stump the Bible
[40:46] said it would be a stump he said what is
[40:48] it we've got disunified body we've got
[40:51] Brotherly Love scattered from side to
[40:53] side he said weigh down in the heart of
[40:55] every born again man this morning
[40:57] morning in their hearts they want to
[40:59] embrace one
[41:00] another in their hearts they want to oh
[41:04] my I've seen so many people that wanted
[41:06] to love one another and spend time
[41:07] together and have meetings together you
[41:09] know what gets in the way
[41:12] preachers a lot of the time that's what
[41:14] gets in the way and I think some of us
[41:16] need to get down on an altar and
[41:17] recognize that it's not about us anymore
[41:20] it's about the word unite My Heart Lord
[41:22] to the unity of the word
[41:25] yes but the he said brother BR said
[41:28] there's many a preacher that belongs to
[41:29] churches of different denominations
[41:31] would love to walk in here this morning
[41:32] take the Oneness and Tess and threeness
[41:34] and forget their differences he said but
[41:36] what is it what's keeping them from it
[41:38] their organization if they get caught in
[41:41] that Bunch they'll get excommunicated he
[41:43] said that's a false Unity yes that's a
[41:46] false Unity the Bible said so again he
[41:50] said so now the great Harlot of
[41:51] Revelation 17 these balum teachers with
[41:53] their false Doctrine is marrying the
[41:56] church into that kind of a man yes he
[41:57] said watch when it comes to The Showdown
[41:59] of the end time look at the weakness of
[42:01] it now he said 900 and something
[42:04] different organizations one pulling one
[42:06] way one the other no Unity among them
[42:08] and they're trying to bring Unity not
[42:11] backed by the word of God God's original
[42:13] plan they're taking in by politics and
[42:15] organization so again go back to the
[42:17] vision brother BR saw the preview of the
[42:19] Bride what was it a witch leading them
[42:22] leading them separated by Nations
[42:24] separated by different things and he's
[42:26] leading their denom ational system and
[42:28] it's a forced Unity but you and I do not
[42:31] have a forced Unity we never will right
[42:34] right because brother brand said they
[42:35] won't there won't be another
[42:37] denomination we're at the end right the
[42:39] wheat has come back to the wheat again
[42:41] and it's time to get in the grain amen
[42:44] but I know people will make it
[42:45] organizations and things around the
[42:47] message but the message will never
[42:49] denominate right so we don't want to
[42:51] forced unity and that goes down even to
[42:52] the local churches we bring it on down
[42:54] we focus on down today realize that goes
[42:57] down even to our relationships with one
[42:59] another even our marriages everything
[43:00] about it is not a forced
[43:03] Unity huh right if the only reason that
[43:06] you're married is because you got a
[43:08] piece of paper that says you're married
[43:09] that's a
[43:11] problem so well I have to be married to
[43:13] her cuz the law says you know no it
[43:16] ought to be a Unity of the
[43:17] heart a Unity of the heart it says no
[43:21] matter what come good or bad rich or
[43:23] poor we're going to stay together that's
[43:25] the way it ought to be with us in this
[43:26] message that's the way it ought to be
[43:28] with us in the word of God a Unity of
[43:30] Heart Lord I I'm not going to I'm not
[43:32] just going to get mad cuz the preacher
[43:33] says something I don't like or maybe
[43:35] somebody says something I don't
[43:36] understand I'm just going to get mad and
[43:38] leave no I want a Unity of the heart
[43:40] where I I'll serve the Lord no matter
[43:42] what the preacher says no matter what
[43:44] the somebody else says no matter what
[43:45] they do let me serve God
[43:49] right he said it's weak because it's not
[43:52] God's original plan they're taken in by
[43:55] politics and organization God don't
[43:56] change his mind he stays right with his
[43:58] word he said heavens and earth will pass
[44:00] away but my word won't he said he stays
[44:02] with his original word they made
[44:05] themselves a name but God put his name
[44:07] in Christ yes amen and brother brandom
[44:11] and it'll do you good to go and and and
[44:13] listen to God's provided place of
[44:15] worship if you haven't heard that in a
[44:16] while that's a wonderful sermon because
[44:18] brother brandham deals with that and so
[44:20] many people think well this is where the
[44:22] bride's got to be gathered and this is
[44:23] where it's got to be brand said I'll
[44:25] tell you where it'll be it'll be in
[44:26] Christ
[44:27] it'll be in Christ it'll be you being
[44:29] gathered to the word and me being
[44:30] gathered to the word and everybody
[44:32] around the world being gathered to the
[44:33] word and then we'll get along with one
[44:35] another because we're Christians because
[44:38] we've been gathered to the
[44:39] word again he said we see this forced
[44:42] religion right in view to bring all the
[44:44] little groups into one great Unity they
[44:46] call it some of them that believe in
[44:47] this and some believe in that some deny
[44:49] this and some deny that the Bible said
[44:51] how can two walk together except they be
[44:52] agreed it'll never work we've got to be
[44:54] in an agreement and what in agreement
[44:57] with what not in agreement with one
[44:58] another as much as we got to be in
[45:00] agreement with the word see the problem
[45:02] is we thought we could only fellowship
[45:03] with those we agreed with personally on
[45:07] yeah in reality what he's looking for is
[45:10] an agreement of the word yeah what's
[45:12] your standard what do you go back to yes
[45:15] right not not our personal feelings
[45:17] about one another but what is what do we
[45:18] go back to the word of God right the the
[45:21] message of the hour he said we got to be
[45:23] in agreement with the word with God
[45:25] that's what it's got to be in agreement
[45:26] with he said we find out a forced Unity
[45:28] was represented by groups of people at
[45:30] Babylon he said God cannot put his name
[45:32] in such a thing as that he never did and
[45:35] he never will oh they tried it they put
[45:37] their name into it put his name into it
[45:39] but it's not so they can call themselves
[45:41] The Church of God or the Church of
[45:43] Christ or the Church of Jesus Christ
[45:44] whatever they want to call it the
[45:46] Catholic church but brother BR said
[45:47] we're the real Catholic church right
[45:49] Catholic means Universal we're we're the
[45:52] we're the bride of Christ but we're what
[45:54] is it h what is it it's a false Unity
[45:56] they put his name on it but he didn't
[45:58] put his name on it anybody can call
[46:01] themselves Mrs PR but I gave a ring to
[46:03] one woman I United in marriage with one
[46:05] woman I'm United in heart with one woman
[46:08] yes are you with me now and he's United
[46:11] with one bride and we're not separated
[46:13] by Church names yes sir we're not
[46:15] separated by Word of Life Tabernacle
[46:17] some other Tabernacle we are only we are
[46:20] bound together by cords of love that's
[46:22] why we ought to care for one another and
[46:24] and care what goes on in elsewhere and
[46:26] and care for each other and about each
[46:28] other
[46:31] yes the only thing keeping you together
[46:34] I don't know why I'm going back to this
[46:35] but the only thing keeping you together
[46:36] in your marriage is that marriage
[46:37] certificate you've got a
[46:39] problem I mean that's good you're
[46:41] staying together it's better than
[46:43] separating better than divorcing but why
[46:46] don't you get United in heart
[46:48] again come back to a place where you
[46:50] begin to have some
[46:52] agreement and you find out your little
[46:54] disagreements fade away when you find
[46:56] out what have in
[46:58] common we don't we don't want a forced
[47:00] Unity or a false Unity we want a true
[47:03] Unity with the word 1 Corinthians 12:12
[47:06] Paul said as the body is one and hath
[47:09] many members and all the members of that
[47:11] one body being many are one body so also
[47:15] is Christ for by one Spirit are we all
[47:19] baptized into one body whether we be
[47:21] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[47:23] free we've all been made to drink into
[47:25] one spirit
[47:29] see my body is made of many different
[47:30] members but we all drink the same water
[47:32] yes right the body is not one member but
[47:35] many if the foot shall say because I'm
[47:37] not of the hand I'm not of the body is
[47:38] it therefore not of the body and Paul
[47:40] begins to continue talking about the
[47:42] differing parts of the body and how that
[47:45] just because they're different doesn't
[47:47] mean that they're not in unity it just
[47:50] means they need to learn to work
[47:51] together right listen to Just because
[47:54] you're different you young people just
[47:55] because you're one's different from from
[47:56] the other that don't mean you can't be
[47:58] in unity it just means you got to learn
[47:59] to work together yeah because if you get
[48:02] to a place where your hand don't work
[48:03] with your arm you got a problem right if
[48:06] you get to a place where your foot don't
[48:07] want to work with you no more but JT
[48:09] it's a problem isn't it you you just
[48:11] don't want to receive commands no more
[48:13] but I want my my whole part of the body
[48:15] to receive the command from the brain
[48:17] from the head which is Christ and let me
[48:20] work with another part of the body who's
[48:22] not the same as me right but yet is part
[48:25] of the body so Paul continues talk about
[48:28] the differing parts of the body and and
[48:31] so we realize our unity in Christ is not
[48:33] based on
[48:35] sameness right brother Brandon said
[48:37] God's not a Sears and robu Harmony
[48:39] House we're just not all going to be the
[48:43] same right it's just not going to be
[48:46] that way you know if you've been to one
[48:47] McDonald's you've been to about all of
[48:48] them and I pointed out to my daughter
[48:51] Melody who still cares about McDonald's
[48:53] and her life and and uh the rest of us
[48:56] are done with it you know we're over
[48:58] McDonald's but Brit or Melody Britney
[49:01] Melody still likes McDonald's and and so
[49:04] I pointed out to her there's one in
[49:05] Jonesboro that's a little bit different
[49:07] it's got the Arches still I pointed that
[49:09] out to her the other day and boy she
[49:10] wanted to go there because it was
[49:12] different you know but you go in almost
[49:14] any McDonald's in the world I've been in
[49:15] McDonald's in the Philippines and I got
[49:17] me an egg McMuffin it tasted good it
[49:20] tasted exactly like an Egg McMuffin in
[49:23] at the McDonald's right down here right
[49:26] right why it's
[49:28] sameness uniformity that's not what God
[49:31] does right but God gives us the
[49:34] ingredients and lets us make the dinner
[49:37] does that make sense he gives us the
[49:39] ingredients and then we get to and he
[49:40] said don't add to it don't take away
[49:42] from it but but it has a little maybe a
[49:43] little more seasoning here a little more
[49:45] seasoning there and he does that God
[49:47] calls men to certain areas he calls
[49:49] certain groups of people to work
[49:51] together why does he do that because he
[49:53] knows that they can work together for a
[49:55] certain purpose it's part of the body
[49:57] One Church might shout a little bit more
[49:58] than somebody else one Church might have
[50:00] a little bit different kind of music and
[50:01] if we're not careful we let our
[50:02] preferences dictate who we fellowship
[50:05] with and really we ought to fellowship
[50:06] with anybody who will Fellowship around
[50:08] the atonement the fact that Jesus died
[50:10] for my sins and he's the same yesterday
[50:12] today and forever he can still heal you
[50:14] he can still save you we believe the
[50:16] message of the hour there's things we
[50:17] can Fellowship around yes are you with
[50:21] me now yeah and we move the same
[50:24] direction though we would disagree
[50:25] bitterly in some are
[50:27] but we're one body as long as we don't
[50:30] try to bring uniformity of thought
[50:33] that's not what we do we're never going
[50:34] to think the same about everything
[50:37] because we've all been through different
[50:38] things we'll get to that maybe a little
[50:40] bit
[50:40] later how does an I I'm not going to
[50:44] hold you long tonight so y'all going to
[50:45] have to listen
[50:47] fast how does an earthquake happenes
[50:50] anybody
[50:51] know you know matne how an earthquake
[50:53] happened
[50:57] that is exactly the tectonic plates
[50:59] smashing together that's exactly what I
[51:01] had written down I'm glad I was
[51:06] right that's good man the tectonic
[51:09] plates I remembered that somewhere in
[51:10] the non-schooling that I did I
[51:13] remembered the words tectonic plates you
[51:15] know and I I put the that in my mind
[51:17] that and I had to go look it up to see
[51:18] if it was right so he knew it I figured
[51:21] he did tectonic plates come together and
[51:25] when they do they they against one
[51:27] another right and when they do it
[51:29] produces friction and and and they'll
[51:31] pull and they keep pulling and right now
[51:34] there's a I seen an article this week
[51:36] said get ready Missouri well they've
[51:38] been saying that for 200 years because
[51:40] we haven't had earthquake in a long time
[51:42] but they're saying Get Ready Missouri
[51:43] there's about to be an earthquake why
[51:45] because that strain is there and they
[51:47] know it's there and it's just in a bind
[51:49] and one day it's going to shake that's
[51:52] right and why is it going to shake
[51:53] because you got two opposing forces
[51:56] grinding against one another and we call
[51:59] that a fault line right that's a fault
[52:02] line now all of us have fault lines in
[52:05] our lives churches have fault lines
[52:08] people have fault lines in their
[52:09] Fellowship there's fault lines in
[52:11] marriage and I don't have time to
[52:12] address all of them tonight but there's
[52:13] some places especially as a body where
[52:16] these fault lines meet a and and and
[52:18] you'll see people just start to grind
[52:20] against one another but the good thing
[52:22] would be if it just rub off all the all
[52:24] the rough edges and we could be one one
[52:27] right though we're maybe different
[52:29] people but we could be one but but the
[52:31] tectonic plate if you look at a map of
[52:33] the tectonic plates you'll find that
[52:34] there's one that ends right there at
[52:36] California that's why they have so much
[52:37] trouble there there's a tectonic plate
[52:39] that ends right there a plate just right
[52:41] at the edge of the ocean just just
[52:43] changes and there's another plate and
[52:45] they just come against one another so we
[52:48] don't want to be that we want to move
[52:49] the same direction though we're
[52:51] different but we're all under one
[52:53] headship we're all following one leader
[52:56] we've all heard the same duck if you go
[52:58] back to what I said this morning and
[53:00] we're following him back to the Homeland
[53:02] yes we all heard the same certain sound
[53:05] amen and we're going back to a place
[53:08] we're going to meet in that City one day
[53:11] right and but these fault lines come
[53:13] because of our
[53:15] Humanity right our souls have been saved
[53:18] right and I talked to Brothers Brothers
[53:20] two-thirds of us not been saved and so
[53:22] our souls have been saved our bodies
[53:23] have not our Spirits have not and that's
[53:26] why you you got to be careful getting a
[53:27] religious spirit on you cuz your spirit
[53:29] hasn't been
[53:30] saved and if it's not under control of
[53:33] the Soul you get a religious spirit on
[53:34] you and think you're better than
[53:35] everybody
[53:36] else right and pretty soon what all
[53:38] that's happening is you've gotten a
[53:40] religious spirit and it's just as carnal
[53:42] as anybody else right right just as
[53:45] carinal as a drinker and the smoker and
[53:46] anybody else though you may look great
[53:48] but you're just as carnal as anybody
[53:50] else because it's a religious spirit God
[53:51] help us not to be that way but to let
[53:54] the inner man control the outer man then
[53:56] there will be peace and love and joy and
[53:58] contentment and all of those things good
[54:01] so so those plates move the opposite in
[54:04] the opposite direction creates a fault
[54:06] line and there's fault lines just as
[54:08] human humans a major fault line among
[54:10] humanity is race yeah right race is a
[54:14] fault
[54:15] line and uh you know but I want you
[54:18] again to call your attention back to the
[54:20] vision brother BR said they all March
[54:22] together yes right all the bride March
[54:25] together
[54:26] you know that all Races come from Noah's
[54:28] Three
[54:30] Sons right all Races come from Noah's
[54:33] Three Sons so brother Brenham tells us
[54:36] this and I know some of you sitting
[54:38] there thinking some of you well educated
[54:39] message people sitting there thinking
[54:41] well you know there was the serpent seed
[54:43] well think about it all Races come from
[54:46] Noah's Three Sons they're the only ones
[54:47] come across the ark brother the B said
[54:48] serpent seed come across through the
[54:49] women so we that's settled right but but
[54:53] but so everybody goes back to Noah y
[54:57] right and and through that everybody
[54:58] goes back to Adam yeah right everybody
[55:01] got the same blood it's all mixed up
[55:03] don't be sitting there trying to think
[55:04] you're better blood than somebody else
[55:05] you're
[55:06] not I'm not we were Gentiles we were out
[55:09] of the Ark of Safety we were away from
[55:11] the away from the mercies of God and God
[55:14] called us brother said with clubes on
[55:15] our back and everything else and going
[55:17] out there and wars and everything else
[55:19] and God called us out of that to his
[55:20] wonderful Kingdom to be his bride he
[55:23] elected Us by grace to be that it's only
[55:25] by grace sister Bethy we can ever become
[55:28] anything in God's kingdom that's all it
[55:29] can be we want to we preach the truth we
[55:32] try to live the truth we try to do A's
[55:33] right but it'll only be by grace that
[55:35] we're going to make it but Brandon said
[55:37] if you get to the other side of the
[55:38] river and you find me he said you'll
[55:40] find me singing Amazing Grace how sweet
[55:42] the sound that saved a Wretch like Me
[55:44] that was me I know I was lost but now I
[55:47] fin was blind but now I
[55:49] see every one of us has got to come out
[55:52] of something right every one of us has a
[55:54] background but we all come from one
[55:57] blood from Adam that's right that's what
[56:01] brother Brandon teaches say the little
[56:02] denominational barriers keep our
[56:03] fellowship apart but God loves us just
[56:06] the same we're his children his grace
[56:08] overrides the whole thing and he loves
[56:10] us all whether we're white brown yellow
[56:13] black it doesn't make a bit of
[56:14] difference to him we all come from one
[56:16] person Adam you realize there's
[56:17] different cultures and different things
[56:19] and we could get into that and how we
[56:21] God made us beautiful like that he
[56:23] didn't he didn't necessarily want
[56:25] everything all mixed up
[56:27] but he wants to all get along right
[56:30] right so he said whether we're white
[56:31] brown black or yellow we could transfuse
[56:33] blood to each other
[56:35] yeah
[56:37] right you know when I see a mother and a
[56:40] father struggling with their baby and I
[56:43] see that here in the States and how they
[56:46] care for that baby and I can go all the
[56:48] way to the other side of the world and
[56:49] preach to those people and they and they
[56:51] have the same care for their baby for
[56:53] their little one as what the mother and
[56:55] father does here here it's the same and
[56:57] they're completely different completely
[56:59] different Lifestyles different jobs
[57:00] different education no no different and
[57:03] praying for a little baby over there and
[57:04] praying for a little baby over here it's
[57:06] the same yeah they both believe God's A
[57:08] Healer right they both believe in in in
[57:11] what the Bible says if you lay hands on
[57:12] the sick they shall recover right and so
[57:15] we see maybe a miracle here a miracle
[57:17] over there and it's the same God are you
[57:20] with me now the same care though that
[57:22] they have for one another and you look
[57:23] at that and realize that that that that
[57:25] we're much more the same than we are
[57:28] different and we could save each other's
[57:30] life even by blood
[57:32] transfusion but I'm so thankful that one
[57:34] come he said who was made different from
[57:37] all of us you realize there oh my we
[57:40] have our different races and things but
[57:42] God wanted a super race a master race
[57:45] and he didn't create it by the way
[57:46] Hitler wanted to create it how did he do
[57:48] it he become the lowest of the low he
[57:51] didn't steal in his way to power but he
[57:53] become the lowest of the low and he
[57:55] created a Pat with his own
[57:58] blood Hallelujah by interjecting his own
[58:01] blood not by sexual Union but by the
[58:03] power of the Holy Spirit his blood is on
[58:06] every one of us making us
[58:08] new oh my we could transfuse blood to
[58:11] each other save each other's life by
[58:12] blood transfusion but I'm so thankful
[58:14] aren't you thankful tonight that one
[58:16] come who has made different from all of
[58:18] us and through the transfusion of his
[58:20] blood We Live Forever The Lord Jesus who
[58:22] was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God
[58:25] yes I know there's people in the message
[58:26] would fight me on that but he was God
[58:28] the Bible says we're saved by the blood
[58:30] of God right brother said it was
[58:33] emanuel's blood yes Oh my he say so
[58:35] we're so thankful for that breaking down
[58:37] all the middle walls of partition and
[58:39] bringing us into one lovely Fellowship
[58:42] together the Bible says he ha made of
[58:45] one blood acts 17:26 all someone say all
[58:48] nations of men for to dwell on all the
[58:50] face of the Earth and hath determined
[58:52] the times before appointed so in other
[58:55] words the times that they would be born
[58:56] in and the bounds of their habitation
[58:58] where they would be born he determined
[59:01] that yeah right brother brand said it
[59:03] this way he said he knew the place and
[59:04] time the bed and time that you would be
[59:06] planted in right he already knew that
[59:09] but here he said this is the scripture
[59:11] for you it's determin the times before
[59:13] appointed and the bounds of their
[59:15] habitation God allowed us to live where
[59:17] we live and be what we are we should be
[59:19] happy with that we should not try to
[59:21] change it be something we're not but God
[59:22] knew everything about us even the color
[59:24] we would be before the foundation of the
[59:27] world do you know God knew the color of
[59:29] your
[59:31] hair do you know that I know some of
[59:34] y'all like me you know you wish you had
[59:36] a different color hair you wish you had
[59:37] hair don't you yeah I saw that I wish I
[59:42] had hair some of us would like to start
[59:44] a Hair Club for Men you
[59:48] know you know we we just like to have
[59:50] hair I thought about it I had a man last
[59:53] week take me aside and just to tell me
[59:56] uh the church I was preaching at they
[59:58] have those spotlights and I guess one
[1:00:01] was shining blind in
[1:00:03] him and he made sure after service to
[1:00:06] come in pastor's office and tell me
[1:00:08] that but he was he was joking with me
[1:00:10] but I you know I was I said hey you know
[1:00:13] we've all got our problems you
[1:00:16] know but God knew what color of hair I
[1:00:18] had and brother brand said he knew every
[1:00:19] one I lost and where it's at he said I
[1:00:22] haven't lost one of them praise the Lord
[1:00:27] but but and I don't want to Blind nobody
[1:00:29] but I can't help it God just made me
[1:00:30] this way you
[1:00:32] know but God allowed us to live where we
[1:00:35] live and be what we are and he knew the
[1:00:37] color of our hair brother R said you the
[1:00:39] color of hair you have the color eyes
[1:00:42] you have the stature that you're in God
[1:00:46] seen you before the foundation of the
[1:00:47] world now I'm not preaching this for
[1:00:48] Doctrine but I just want you to
[1:00:49] understand this this is why I've taught
[1:00:51] my daughters you're beautiful like you
[1:00:53] are you don't need a bunch of stuff
[1:00:56] right to be beautiful your hair is
[1:00:58] beautiful why God made you with that
[1:01:01] hair your your face is beautiful God
[1:01:03] made you with that face and you're
[1:01:06] beautiful the way you are and I'm so
[1:01:08] thankful that God God made us with a
[1:01:11] with a design with a purpose in our
[1:01:12] hearts amen we're all different well you
[1:01:15] know some people are more intense and
[1:01:17] some people smile all the time and some
[1:01:18] people are happy and and I look at some
[1:01:20] of these little kids they just make me
[1:01:21] happy to look at them you know and some
[1:01:23] like to dress up and some don't like to
[1:01:25] dress up but but that's part of it we're
[1:01:27] different but God made us to be one body
[1:01:30] he said we all come from one we come
[1:01:32] from the mind of God if you're the bride
[1:01:34] you come from the mind of God before the
[1:01:36] foundation of the world God seen you
[1:01:37] he's seen you a human being like you are
[1:01:40] he said and though there come a million
[1:01:41] years yet he said there's nothing can
[1:01:43] keep you from coming back to that
[1:01:45] Perfect Image that God ordained for you
[1:01:47] in the beginning hear me Church there's
[1:01:49] nothing that can keep you from coming
[1:01:51] back to that image no matter what
[1:01:53] happens in the meantime there is nothing
[1:01:55] that can separate you from the love of
[1:01:57] God yeah Hallelujah he said my sheep
[1:02:00] hear my voice a stranger they will not
[1:02:02] follow the Sheep will follow the
[1:02:03] shepherd all the way back to their
[1:02:06] original condition brother Jeff isin't
[1:02:09] that wonderful don't don't you want to
[1:02:11] go back I want to go back to my original
[1:02:13] condition I want to go back to the
[1:02:15] thought he had in his mind of me yes
[1:02:18] amen Revelation 5 and9 says they sung a
[1:02:21] new song saying thou worthy to take the
[1:02:24] book and open the seals there for th was
[1:02:25] slain has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:02:28] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[1:02:31] and people and nation and has made us
[1:02:33] under our God Kings and Priests and we
[1:02:35] shall reign on the
[1:02:39] earth another fault line people have his
[1:02:44] finances there's always been a poor
[1:02:47] people that Envy the rich there's always
[1:02:50] been rich people who oppress the
[1:02:52] poor it's always been that way not every
[1:02:55] rich man oppresses the poor not every
[1:02:57] poor man envies the rich but it's but
[1:03:00] it's always been an element of that but
[1:03:02] that's not God's way some men are gifted
[1:03:05] to make money others are not we don't
[1:03:06] want to have an
[1:03:08] earthquake are you with me now yeah we
[1:03:11] want to make sure these fault lines are
[1:03:13] covered we we understand understand
[1:03:16] these things the way it's supposed to be
[1:03:17] the way God wants it to be we're moving
[1:03:18] in the same direction yeah so some men
[1:03:21] are gifted to make money others aren't I
[1:03:24] bless the Lord I Thank God for those of
[1:03:26] you who are gifted to make money and me
[1:03:27] and brother
[1:03:30] Joel we're just not you know my dad was
[1:03:33] a man gifted to make money he wasn't
[1:03:34] gifted to keep money but he was gifted
[1:03:36] to make
[1:03:38] it that's why we didn't we didn't get an
[1:03:40] inheritance you know but he can make
[1:03:43] money some people just are some people
[1:03:45] like King mides and everything they
[1:03:46] touch turns to gold and some people
[1:03:49] don't many of us don't a Christian will
[1:03:52] provide for his own yeah right brother
[1:03:54] Brandon said a Christian will do that
[1:03:55] and be gentleman but not everyone is
[1:03:57] blessed the same
[1:03:59] materially and and we're all blessed in
[1:04:02] different ways but brother Bram says
[1:04:03] this in the Full Gospel business a
[1:04:05] minute I I'll get off of this pretty
[1:04:06] quick but he said I think today as I
[1:04:08] look around and see rich men poor men
[1:04:10] all fellowshipping together there's
[1:04:11] something about it we have on Common
[1:04:13] Grounds one Common Grounds that is
[1:04:16] Christian fellowship and each man maybe
[1:04:19] the man and someone spoke like the
[1:04:21] brother was talking about the Lord had
[1:04:22] blessed him with so much money and he
[1:04:24] said the other people maybe maybe you
[1:04:26] think you don't have that much money it
[1:04:27] must have been interesting in these Full
[1:04:28] Gospel businessmen breakfast because
[1:04:30] they'd get up and boast about how much
[1:04:31] money they had right cuz it was
[1:04:33] basically a Kanas club and brother
[1:04:36] Brandon's preaching messages like the
[1:04:37] Rapture to him you know right which is
[1:04:40] just in conru I'm so glad they put it on
[1:04:42] tape because they didn't get none of it
[1:04:44] you know and brother Brandon's preaching
[1:04:46] those sermons those great Mysteries to
[1:04:48] them and they're they're in there
[1:04:49] debating about who made the most money
[1:04:50] and so they get up and
[1:04:52] testify and so what you hear on tape is
[1:04:54] not all the service they'd have
[1:04:55] testimonies they'd have different
[1:04:57] preachers preach and things and and they
[1:04:59] have they' get up and testify oh the
[1:05:01] Lord blessed me I found an oil well you
[1:05:04] know and I I got I I got a fleet of
[1:05:07] Cadillacs and you know how even they do
[1:05:09] today some of the descendants of that
[1:05:11] movement they'll get up the preachers
[1:05:12] will get up and brag about how big their
[1:05:13] house is I don't do that cuz I got
[1:05:16] nothing to brag
[1:05:17] about but they'll get up and brag about
[1:05:20] that kind of stuff and brag about their
[1:05:21] you know now today it's got to be
[1:05:24] careful here but it's message pastors we
[1:05:25] just try to upgrade our trucks you
[1:05:30] know how you know how successful you
[1:05:33] are it's okay you can
[1:05:35] laugh but and I thank God but see some
[1:05:38] men will be more successful they will
[1:05:40] yeah right even in Ministry some men are
[1:05:42] going to be more successful in money
[1:05:44] some men are going to be more successful
[1:05:45] some less but I would just want to be
[1:05:48] where God placed me but these men would
[1:05:50] get up and and testify about that
[1:05:52] brother brand notices it and he says
[1:05:54] like the brother the Lord had blessed
[1:05:55] him with so much money and the other
[1:05:56] people maybe you think you don't have
[1:05:57] that much money you don't want to give
[1:05:59] your
[1:06:00] testimony it may not sound the same said
[1:06:03] but God has G you something
[1:06:06] yes yes you may not have all the money
[1:06:08] in the world but God's G you something
[1:06:10] right he said it's like what brother
[1:06:11] deesa said he hasn't give this man it's
[1:06:12] alog together different right right it's
[1:06:15] a difference and brother brandom said he
[1:06:16] dealt with that himself because he tells
[1:06:18] the story of going to Tulsa and seeing
[1:06:19] the great buildings and and Oral Roberts
[1:06:21] and all them that built the Great
[1:06:23] buildings he felt so small cuz brother
[1:06:25] brandom had had a trailer with a
[1:06:27] typewriter and that was his office and
[1:06:30] answered all these letters and he had as
[1:06:31] much opportunity for money as they did
[1:06:34] but the Lord just didn't lead him that
[1:06:35] way he didn't make him that and he saw
[1:06:38] all that they had built and it
[1:06:39] intimidated him a little bit he he felt
[1:06:40] bad about it he he said he said and and
[1:06:44] he said the Holy Spirit told him I just
[1:06:46] love this he said he said I'm your
[1:06:49] portion they have a portion yeah you
[1:06:51] don't have to Envy them I'm your portion
[1:06:53] oh I'm so glad that he could be our p
[1:06:55] portion today whether we're rich or poor
[1:06:57] whether we got money in the bank or not
[1:06:59] he could be our
[1:07:01] portion he said I'm your
[1:07:03] portion and brother Brandon follows that
[1:07:06] up he said now I know how some
[1:07:07] businessmen would feel to hear that man
[1:07:10] how God is blessing yeah right sometimes
[1:07:13] you talk about the church and I get kind
[1:07:14] of self-conscious about it because we've
[1:07:16] had so many good things happen and I
[1:07:18] deal with pastors many times who just
[1:07:20] constantly dealing with problems and
[1:07:21] things bad are happening and and like
[1:07:23] that and you say how's your church doing
[1:07:25] you know you know and I say well
[1:07:26] everything's good you know we just love
[1:07:28] one another and and we just try to keep
[1:07:31] it that way you know and we have our
[1:07:32] little problems and things but we get
[1:07:34] over it and and we get past it but when
[1:07:37] I tell them that it's always when your
[1:07:38] church is growing it's always hard
[1:07:40] because there's some brother whose
[1:07:41] Church isn't growing that don't mean
[1:07:43] he's any less of a Preacher right right
[1:07:45] or any less of a man of God are you with
[1:07:47] me now God has to be our portion no
[1:07:51] matter what's happening in our ministry
[1:07:52] what's happening in your life he said no
[1:07:54] I know how some bus this man would feel
[1:07:56] to hear that man that how God is
[1:07:57] blessing but remember God is your
[1:07:59] portion too brother God is your portion
[1:08:02] when we come together our fellowships
[1:08:04] are the same we Fellowship one with
[1:08:06] another yes oh so we ought to we ought
[1:08:09] to get along that it shouldn't be a
[1:08:10] fault line Among Us yeah we should be
[1:08:12] headed the same direction Bible say seek
[1:08:14] you first the kingdom of God and his
[1:08:16] righteousness all these things shall be
[1:08:18] added unto
[1:08:21] you see and again we could we could
[1:08:24] promote a false un of Prosperity Gospel
[1:08:26] but God didn't make us all to be
[1:08:28] financially prosperous I believe anybody
[1:08:31] can be you go ahead and be that if you
[1:08:33] want to that helps me I'm all for
[1:08:35] it right but but but God didn't make us
[1:08:38] all to walk the same path that's right
[1:08:41] some of us he made contented with
[1:08:43] less again I don't mean that should
[1:08:45] means you should be in debt or something
[1:08:46] like that if you can get out of debt get
[1:08:48] out of debt but God didn't make us all
[1:08:49] to be the same right he made us
[1:08:51] different for different works right
[1:08:53] right so we would understand people
[1:08:55] differently another fault line is
[1:08:57] personality do you know the reason
[1:08:59] brother brand uses why the godhead can't
[1:09:01] be a trinity of persons is because that
[1:09:03] would mean three different personalities
[1:09:05] can you imagine what the trinitarian
[1:09:07] godhead makes God it makes him a godhead
[1:09:10] of persons which is like okay what are
[1:09:12] we going to do about you know should we
[1:09:14] flood the people or bring fire or what
[1:09:16] should we do and they just all have to
[1:09:17] have a discussion and I heard a
[1:09:19] trinitarian pastor talking about it he
[1:09:20] said well the Holy Ghost is the Divine
[1:09:22] eavesdropper that comes down and listens
[1:09:24] in and when the Father and Son make a
[1:09:26] decision he goes off and come on church
[1:09:28] it's just it's paganism yeah it's
[1:09:31] paganism that's not what God does at all
[1:09:33] God is United within himself right right
[1:09:36] what he speaks is never wrong he never
[1:09:38] has to say anything twice he's the same
[1:09:41] today yesterday and forever I'm so
[1:09:43] thankful we have a god like that if you
[1:09:45] ever made a decision brother BR said he
[1:09:46] never made another decision he never had
[1:09:49] to if you ever if you ever made a
[1:09:50] decision about to save you he'll never
[1:09:52] make a decision to lose you right right
[1:09:55] he can he made the right decision the
[1:09:57] first time yes but we're not like that
[1:10:00] right we have personality so that
[1:10:01] becomes a false a fault line so he said
[1:10:04] how that God trying to place his people
[1:10:06] he said when God places one they know
[1:10:08] the whole church wants to be like that
[1:10:09] one have the same kind of things do the
[1:10:12] same things but he said we're cut out
[1:10:14] different yes we're we're we're made
[1:10:17] different look at the words he uses
[1:10:19] we're natured different of different
[1:10:23] personalities and it's okay amen amen
[1:10:26] right that's okay each one for a he said
[1:10:30] we're positionally placed different each
[1:10:32] one for a different work maybe one for
[1:10:35] just a little kind of a work another for
[1:10:38] a large
[1:10:39] work but see it's when the the little
[1:10:42] man begins to Envy the little work
[1:10:44] begins to Envy the large work or when
[1:10:46] the large work begins to look down on
[1:10:47] the little work then that's when you
[1:10:48] have problems that's the fault line
[1:10:51] brother brand said I believe it was
[1:10:52] David or one of the prophets said I'd
[1:10:54] rather be a doorman at the house than to
[1:10:55] dwell in the tents with the wicked give
[1:10:57] me my position at the door getting
[1:10:59] walked
[1:11:00] on right we bought some new doormats
[1:11:02] recently let me be one of those yeah
[1:11:05] rather than just not being there at all
[1:11:07] right I'd rather do that there are
[1:11:08] people in the church who are perfectly
[1:11:10] qualified to have certain offices in the
[1:11:12] church but they don't have the
[1:11:13] personality for it don't have the nature
[1:11:15] for it that's okay not everybody's meant
[1:11:17] to be a deacon not everybody's meant to
[1:11:18] be and we shouldn't look at that like
[1:11:20] that we should look at as opportunity to
[1:11:22] serve but there is something you can do
[1:11:24] yeah there's something you can do
[1:11:26] brother BR talked about how that every a
[1:11:28] bell would be crafted he said with a
[1:11:30] certain ting to it a certain tone and
[1:11:34] every Bell had to have its own tone and
[1:11:36] he and and so they would use these bells
[1:11:38] to play music and what they would do is
[1:11:40] they each one had to have just the right
[1:11:42] amount of brass in it just the right
[1:11:44] amount of materials different materials
[1:11:46] in it to make a different sound so that
[1:11:49] at the end you could have music because
[1:11:51] if they all sounded the same it don't
[1:11:53] sound very good just give you a headache
[1:11:56] come on church we all try to be the same
[1:11:57] and just give God a headache but we
[1:11:59] don't want to do that we want to play
[1:12:01] Beautiful music to him so how do we do
[1:12:03] that he's got to make us with specific
[1:12:05] materials crafted in a certain way to
[1:12:08] produce a certain tone from our lives
[1:12:10] yes brother B said he's a great
[1:12:12] Refiner's furnace that where he has to
[1:12:14] put these things Upon Us trials and
[1:12:16] persecutions and things to mold it
[1:12:19] together what's he doing come on Church
[1:12:21] what's he doing to our brothers and
[1:12:24] sisters who are suffering Maybe when we
[1:12:25] suffer what's he doing to us he's
[1:12:28] crafting us yes molding us making our
[1:12:31] testimony
[1:12:33] ring maybe the only way that your
[1:12:35] testimony could ring is to go through
[1:12:37] what you went through but just remember
[1:12:39] you're in the hands of
[1:12:40] God
[1:12:42] right Hallelujah make our testimony ring
[1:12:45] for a certain time a certain note that
[1:12:47] he wants to rang out on a certain day
[1:12:50] yes I thought about that as I went to
[1:12:52] Brother Ben's because I grew up around
[1:12:54] that church and but if I had ended up
[1:12:56] there or brother Ben had ended up here
[1:12:57] things might have been different it
[1:12:59] might not have worked
[1:13:01] yeah right cuz God put us where he
[1:13:03] wanted us cuz we had we've been made a
[1:13:06] certain way to Ting a certain a certain
[1:13:09] sound yeah for a certain place and time
[1:13:12] I say God let me be used that way yes
[1:13:15] but brother said we're made different
[1:13:16] we're all made different but we all see
[1:13:18] one we see different but we all see one
[1:13:20] thing that's Jesus Christ let's look at
[1:13:23] him yes amen
[1:13:25] the Bible said even the word come no
[1:13:27] Prophecy of the scriptures of any
[1:13:28] private interpretation the prophecy came
[1:13:30] not in Old Time by the will of man but
[1:13:32] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[1:13:34] by the Holy Ghost what were they they
[1:13:35] were God's bells and he made them a
[1:13:38] certain way to teting a certain thing
[1:13:40] off of their life a note that could
[1:13:41] become the scripture and you today we're
[1:13:44] the interpretation of it we're the
[1:13:46] reality of it we're the walking word
[1:13:48] we're the manifested word so what does
[1:13:50] God want to do for us he wants to make
[1:13:51] us and mold us so that we can give off
[1:13:53] that certainty so our test testimony can
[1:13:55] have a ring to it amen I'm almost done
[1:13:59] just bear with me now for just a few
[1:14:01] minutes how does 66 men over more than
[1:14:04] 4,000 years produce a masterpiece it
[1:14:06] fits exactly together it's God's Unity
[1:14:09] right man can't do that but the unity of
[1:14:11] the spirit does that the unity of the
[1:14:13] spirit and the word they weren't the
[1:14:15] same but they spoke with one voice
[1:14:16] because they were inspired by one spirit
[1:14:19] I lastly I'll deal with this Generations
[1:14:22] can be a fault line it just means
[1:14:25] difference in ages for those of you who
[1:14:26] went to public
[1:14:28] school generation every generation
[1:14:30] thinks the next one is completely
[1:14:37] nuts and I'll be
[1:14:40] honest I look at my kids
[1:14:43] and I didn't do things like that but
[1:14:46] then I remember it's a good thing they
[1:14:48] don't do everything like I
[1:14:52] did and and and we need to remember that
[1:14:55] because someone wrote one time he said
[1:14:58] our sire's age was worse than our
[1:15:00] grandsires we their sons are more
[1:15:01] worthless than they so in our turn we
[1:15:04] give the world a progyny yet more
[1:15:05] corrupt well that's fatalistic isn't it
[1:15:07] you know who wrote that Horus in 20
[1:15:12] BC right the young people
[1:15:15] right I'm just trying to lighten this up
[1:15:17] a little bit as as we get ready to close
[1:15:19] but someone this was a writer said
[1:15:22] modern fashion seemed to keep on growing
[1:15:24] more and more base the ordinary spoken
[1:15:26] language has steadily
[1:15:28] coarsened said people used to say raise
[1:15:30] the carriage Shaft or trim the lampwick
[1:15:32] but people today say raise it or trim it
[1:15:34] and you know how language has gotten
[1:15:36] dumbed down we have all seen that in our
[1:15:39] generation but you know who wrote this
[1:15:41] Yoshida Kinko a Japanese man in the year
[1:15:49] 1330 someone said in 1904 that never has
[1:15:52] youth been exposed such dangers of
[1:15:53] perversion and arres in our own land
[1:15:56] increasing urban life with his
[1:15:57] Temptations prematurity sedentary
[1:16:00] occupations sounds like somebody's
[1:16:01] reading today right that's what's
[1:16:04] happening today but that's the way they
[1:16:06] viewed the Youth of that day and that
[1:16:08] was some of our grandparents right right
[1:16:11] and and the active life is most needed
[1:16:13] early emancipation a lessening sense of
[1:16:15] both Duty and
[1:16:17] discipline and and I will say this let
[1:16:19] me say this let me let me stand up for
[1:16:21] old people for for old people I try to
[1:16:23] for our seniors that sounds better
[1:16:25] doesn't it let me stand up for our
[1:16:27] seniors for a minute because our seniors
[1:16:28] have been through some things and they
[1:16:30] know some things but Danny was telling
[1:16:32] us a story earlier and he got telling
[1:16:35] this story and it was but Danny was
[1:16:37] interesting I I enjoyed it and but he
[1:16:39] got telling a story about being a
[1:16:41] 10-year-old boy carrying water he said
[1:16:43] he went look the first time he earned
[1:16:44] Social Security was at 10 years old it's
[1:16:46] hard for me to relate to
[1:16:48] that and my children can't relate to it
[1:16:51] at
[1:16:52] all right because they just had so much
[1:16:55] handed to them but the truth is if I was
[1:16:57] raised in this generation I might act a
[1:16:58] lot like
[1:17:00] them but it's but we should help them
[1:17:03] with our knowledge with our
[1:17:05] understanding right and try to help them
[1:17:07] because we do need to help they do need
[1:17:08] help they do need instruction we have to
[1:17:11] help them but remember that that there
[1:17:13] have been other Generations come before
[1:17:14] us thought the same things about us and
[1:17:17] and yet some many of those things are
[1:17:18] valid and I believe we should honor our
[1:17:20] elders in Leviticus 19:32 it teaches us
[1:17:23] Thou shalt rise up before the Hy head
[1:17:25] that means gray hair right and honor the
[1:17:28] face of the old man and fear thy God I
[1:17:32] am the Lord the Bible tells us even as a
[1:17:34] young Minister I've been young and now
[1:17:36] I'm old I kind of identify with that but
[1:17:38] I'm a younger Minister and I look at an
[1:17:40] older pastor and I don't rebuke an older
[1:17:42] Pastor I might rebuke Joel but
[1:17:46] yeah but I don't rebuke an older Pastor
[1:17:49] right I I'm careful with that why
[1:17:52] because the Bible says don't do that
[1:17:55] rebuke not an elder but in treat him
[1:17:57] with like a father right he could be
[1:17:59] wrong old people are wrong sometimes but
[1:18:02] our seniors can be wrong but let's treat
[1:18:04] them
[1:18:05] right right we all got to treat them
[1:18:07] right see an elder Saint uh you know
[1:18:09] doing something that maybe they
[1:18:10] shouldn't be doing sometimes they want
[1:18:11] to do it but but if they shouldn't be
[1:18:13] doing something then maybe we should
[1:18:14] help out be willing to pitch in and you
[1:18:16] kids be willing to pitch in I saw I'm
[1:18:18] going to call attention to it again I
[1:18:20] saw Kennedy carrying around a stack of
[1:18:22] plates and I know those weren't all hers
[1:18:24] they were everybody's plates and she's
[1:18:26] carrying them all and and she uh and and
[1:18:29] I hollered at across the parking lot I
[1:18:31] said Kennedy thank
[1:18:32] you thank you for doing that huh we
[1:18:36] should encourage our young people
[1:18:38] there's things that we can do to help
[1:18:39] one another yes that's
[1:18:42] fine we can do that and and and we we
[1:18:46] should uh when you see them when you see
[1:18:48] somebody and I want but I want to
[1:18:50] encourage you young people when you see
[1:18:51] somebody an older person that needs help
[1:18:54] go help them it may be the best
[1:18:55] experience of your life we're going to
[1:18:58] do a some kind of banquet for the for
[1:19:00] our seniors coming up and when we get a
[1:19:03] chance to do that I I want our young
[1:19:05] people to be involved because I want
[1:19:06] them to look at be able to learn from
[1:19:08] their parents their grandparents and
[1:19:11] because some of these people come up in
[1:19:12] a different place than you did they've
[1:19:13] been through some things they know some
[1:19:15] things CU they've seen some
[1:19:18] things and but there'll always be a
[1:19:20] friction between Generations because no
[1:19:22] two generations are the same they're not
[1:19:23] supposed to be Grand said if you see he
[1:19:26] said if you see a little grandchild
[1:19:27] running around Grandma all the time she
[1:19:28] probably has candy in her
[1:19:31] pocket right we're not made the same
[1:19:33] right there will always be friction yes
[1:19:36] but we're one body how many believe that
[1:19:38] today we all want to go back to way it
[1:19:40] used to be I I think about that you know
[1:19:42] we've been restored back to the early
[1:19:43] church but if I brought
[1:19:46] slabs of wood in here for you to sit on
[1:19:48] I wonder how many of us would
[1:19:52] come right that's what they did
[1:19:55] if we had have church in a cave with no
[1:19:59] electricity then there'd be no Heating
[1:20:01] in air you talk about hot in the summer
[1:20:04] and cold in the winter but they were
[1:20:06] faithful to the house of God that's the
[1:20:08] people that Paul wrote to they were
[1:20:09] having churching Cav and Paul said you
[1:20:11] should assemble yourselves
[1:20:13] more as you see the day approaching but
[1:20:16] what what what is it every generation is
[1:20:18] different because we've had a different
[1:20:19] standard to live in but the standard
[1:20:20] ought to be God's word that's what the
[1:20:23] standard we have to live up to is the
[1:20:24] word of God not the living conditions
[1:20:26] I'm not giving up my air conditioned
[1:20:28] vehicle but I want my standard to be the
[1:20:30] word of God isn't that what you want
[1:20:31] your standard to be that's what we all
[1:20:33] want and you young people ought to honor
[1:20:35] your elders you ought to look forward to
[1:20:37] to to a time when you can help somebody
[1:20:40] that's what we want we want to help
[1:20:42] people and our elders ought to want to
[1:20:43] help our young people
[1:20:45] too I'm here to help you I want I want
[1:20:48] you to know as a pastor I'm here to help
[1:20:49] you it's never too late at night it's
[1:20:51] never too early in the morning it's
[1:20:53] never too difficult of a time there's
[1:20:55] never a time I wouldn't want to hear
[1:20:57] from somebody because I want to know you
[1:20:59] say well it's not a big deal but if it's
[1:21:00] something that you think you ought to
[1:21:02] call me about call me about it why
[1:21:04] because that's what I'm here for kind of
[1:21:07] hurts my feelings if nobody ever asked
[1:21:08] for help right that's my whole job what
[1:21:11] am I supposed to do right and so I want
[1:21:13] you to do that I want you to ask me to
[1:21:15] pray many times that's all I can do but
[1:21:18] I can pray I got time that some of you
[1:21:21] don't have cuz you're working all the
[1:21:23] time I got time to get on my and pray
[1:21:25] before God I say God help me to do that
[1:21:27] God help me to put more time in study
[1:21:29] and prayer for the people of
[1:21:31] God that's the standard we all ought to
[1:21:33] be trying to help one
[1:21:36] another I'm G to skip on down I told you
[1:21:38] I was closing I'm almost out of
[1:21:41] time we want to suffer the little
[1:21:44] children as Jesus said to come but he
[1:21:48] said we all should be like little
[1:21:49] children yes we should all be like
[1:21:52] little
[1:21:53] children but the Bible tells us this in
[1:21:55] Galatians 6:2 bear ye one another's
[1:21:58] burdens all of us all of us right can we
[1:22:02] be real and and understanding that we
[1:22:04] don't all understand each other's
[1:22:06] burdens that's right if you go down a
[1:22:09] few verses from that Paul says each man
[1:22:12] must each one must carry his own burden
[1:22:13] it seems like it contradicts but it
[1:22:15] doesn't contradict it just says I don't
[1:22:18] always understand somebody else's burden
[1:22:21] I don't know why they're wired the way
[1:22:22] that they are it's it's impossible for
[1:22:24] me to comprehend why somebody is the way
[1:22:28] that they are exactly I can think about
[1:22:30] it I can do psychoanalysis you know in
[1:22:32] my brain say Well they're this way
[1:22:34] because of this but it's really
[1:22:35] impossible for me to know because I
[1:22:38] didn't go through what they went through
[1:22:40] and they didn't go through what I'm
[1:22:41] going through or have been through so
[1:22:45] how do you bear a burden if you don't
[1:22:47] understand it let me ask you
[1:22:51] this how how did Simon help Jesus I've
[1:22:55] preached it to you many times but never
[1:22:58] brought out this point listen how did he
[1:23:00] help him there's no way that Simon who
[1:23:03] carried Jesus cross could have ever
[1:23:07] understood the load that Jesus was
[1:23:09] bearing right he can't comprehend it
[1:23:13] there's just no way the weight of the
[1:23:16] sins of the world were not on Simon
[1:23:19] right he didn't go to Gethsemane right
[1:23:22] he wasn't there it was in possible for
[1:23:25] him he can't carry the whole burden of
[1:23:28] the sins of the world listen you can't
[1:23:31] carry the appointed burden or someone
[1:23:33] else you can't do that you're not always
[1:23:34] going to understand but what can you do
[1:23:37] pick up the cross yes so he picked up to
[1:23:41] carry the the physical load to help in
[1:23:44] what way he could help right he was just
[1:23:47] a man big enough and strong enough that
[1:23:49] he could carry across and he was
[1:23:50] compelled to do it let me be that kind
[1:23:52] of a man let me be somebody who's
[1:23:54] willing to Bear somebody else's burdens
[1:23:56] even if I don't understand it
[1:24:00] yes how could he
[1:24:02] comprehend what was going through the
[1:24:04] mind of Jesus who had never done
[1:24:06] anything
[1:24:07] wrong and was spit
[1:24:10] on killed by his own children beaten by
[1:24:14] his own children Simon couldn't
[1:24:17] understand as the musicians come how
[1:24:19] could Simon he couldn't understand it
[1:24:21] that was Jesus burden yes but when the
[1:24:24] Body of Christ was weak yes at its
[1:24:27] weakest
[1:24:28] point
[1:24:30] right Simon just happens to be at the
[1:24:32] right place at the right time yes and
[1:24:36] the Bible says he was compelled to carry
[1:24:39] the cross and we preached about he made
[1:24:40] a made a difference in his
[1:24:42] family because he picked up the burden
[1:24:45] that he couldn't
[1:24:46] understand said I'll help you I'll pray
[1:24:50] for
[1:24:51] you I don't know what you're going
[1:24:53] through cuz I didn't live in your age
[1:24:54] but I I'll help you is there a way I can
[1:24:58] help you is there a way I can do that
[1:25:01] could shouldn't we be looking for that
[1:25:03] church see that's not forced Unity or
[1:25:06] false
[1:25:07] Unity that's un the unity of the bride
[1:25:11] all marching together because we have
[1:25:13] one example and that's Christ in the
[1:25:16] message of the hour I don't always
[1:25:18] understand I don't understand what
[1:25:19] brother brandham went through I don't I
[1:25:21] don't have that kind of
[1:25:22] ministry but I can help carry this
[1:25:24] message yes right Lord help me to carry
[1:25:28] it yes I don't understand what many of
[1:25:30] you mothers go through yeah I've never
[1:25:32] given child
[1:25:34] birth we men can't we can't understand
[1:25:37] that but we can bear the burden pick up
[1:25:39] the cross help out yeah are you with me
[1:25:43] now yes what if we all made a commitment
[1:25:45] to do that I know it's been different
[1:25:47] today what if we all made a different
[1:25:49] commitment to do that as a church and
[1:25:50] say Let's help one another yes let's
[1:25:52] pull for one another yeah let's strive
[1:25:55] to come in at the Straight Gate and walk
[1:25:58] together till we reach the other side
[1:26:01] all we have is each other let's not take
[1:26:03] that lightly Let's help one another
[1:26:05] sometimes helping is is reminding
[1:26:09] someone of their Duty sometimes
[1:26:11] it's sometimes it's encouraging
[1:26:15] sometimes sometimes it's rebuke but just
[1:26:18] make sure it's helpful it's all it's
[1:26:21] what we want to do we want to do what's
[1:26:23] right we want these kids to be raised up
[1:26:26] I I I'll be honest with you I don't want
[1:26:28] them to experience the same things I did
[1:26:30] I want them to experience a Rapture
[1:26:33] before they're even old enough to go
[1:26:36] out and brother man you want them to
[1:26:38] have your experience no I want them to
[1:26:40] experience a change of a body they go
[1:26:42] from 9 or 10 or 12 or whatever they are
[1:26:45] to being perfect in his sight and having
[1:26:47] a new body that's what I
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:50] want want with all of my heart but if
[1:26:53] there's another generation let me help
[1:26:55] them all I can give my life for them so
[1:26:58] that the Next Generation can walk
[1:26:59] forward and be better than we were and
[1:27:01] keep marching up like he said the bride
[1:27:03] was we don't want them to be like we
[1:27:05] were we want them to be better we want
[1:27:07] to we want something better for them if
[1:27:10] that's your desire let's stand together
