Lord and have our sins become white as snow I pray you granted today bless every person heal the sick we pray and touch those that are in need in Jesus name we pray amen second Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 17 second chronicles 2017 and we'll go back to that scripture after a little bit I'm not going to hold you very long at all this this evening and um we're gonna have a um some practicing they're going to practice some music after the service the ones that are going to be doing that in the meetings musicians in the meetings and appreciate all your hard work they told me the fellowship mostly cleaned I think this afternoon and in between services so thank you thank you all whoever did that thank you for doing that and and we appreciate you in the church we're going to I think work on that maybe Tuesday night we're gonna set out some chairs and things this afternoon what's an exciting time and I want to talk to you this afternoon about preparation preparation because we've been making a lot of preparations for people to come for visitors for uh for friends for family for people that are coming in and for for Ministry but for the meetings we need to make sure that we make a preparation for in our own Hearts to receive from God and that's what we need I uh before I read the scripture I've also got some prayer claws these are the uh the ones that brother Brandon prayed over actually actually I believe it was a sheets that was in his room from some time ago and they'd gotten put away but I have some of those that they've cut up so if you need a prayer cloth I'm going to leave those up here while the brothers preach the morning of the Lord will be here if you need a prayer cloth we've got them here for you and I appreciate that the person that got those to me and uh there's there's several of those if you need one for yourself or for a family member we believe that God uses that as he did with Paul there's nothing special about any man but I do think that that it is a special thing brother Brandon prayed over those or at least had those in his possession and uh but we're gonna we're gonna believe that God will will heal the sick and whatever we have need of he'll meet that need second chronicles 20 17 you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you amen God bless you you can be seated speak to you about preparation for victory and you go to fight a war how you prepare for that war shows what you believe will happen if you prepare in a kind of a way it says well we know that the enemy is greater than we are we know that we won't be able to really do anything we're just going to put up a fight and we're all going to die uh and then and then it'll all be over you don't put as much preparation into it but when you know that Victory Is Possible then you begin to prepare for victory not for defeat but I want to tell you tonight that Victory is not just possible but Victory is actually promised to us by by God we know that when we leave this age you can believe what you want to but I don't believe we're going to leave here A bunch of people that are half dragging our way into heaven and just barely made it in on the skin of our teeth and we're just barely able to make it and we're weakened down and we're gonna look at all these other agents and say boy you guys had it but us we just barely made it I don't believe it's going to be that way at all I believe there's going to be a group of people here at the end time that's going to go in in a full force that we're going to be the people of God we're going to be the the soldiers that that are fully equipped and and fully able and I think the other ages are going to come up to the Overcomers of laodicea they're going to come up to us and say how did you make it you face the hardest battle but you had the greatest victory yeah and so when we prepare for this age we're not preparing for defeat we're not preparing for Doom and Gloom and we're not preparing for uh for for things to just go wrong we're preparing for God to move we're preparing for the sick to be healed we're preparing for for God to move on for our children we're preparing for backsliders to come back home I get tired of people preparing for the end times preparing for for a squeeze preparing for something else you can prepare for the tribulation if you want to but I'm not preparing for tribulation I'm preparing for a rapture I'm getting ready to go home this is not the end this is not the last time or we're going home it's the last time for the world it's the end time for the world it's the end of struggling nature brother says that 7c was the end for everything else but for the bride it's not the end for the Eternal amen it's the beginning Hallelujah hey man when God prepares to do something he prepares for victory and we must prepare for victory and even if everything else is defeat say anything of Noah when no one prepared the ark he wasn't preparing for what the world was preparing for you'd have heard the rain was coming you might have built a great big shelter or some great great kind of thing but that's not what Noah did Noah prepared for victory he didn't prepare to be drowned he didn't prepare for his children to be overcome listen we live in an age when the children are being overcome by perversion when the people are being overcome by Church entity going to be overcome by cold formalism but we are not preparing for our children to be overcome by this world we are preparing for victory for our children to have a victory we're preparing we're building an ark amen God was going to prepare to destroy the enemies of the world and Noah had to build a way to prepare something to ride through it yeah amen and brother random in that message preparation or God has provided away he said what are we trying to do with this word this morning he said it's build something for you to ride through on your victory we're building something for you to have Victory they didn't build the ark so they would all die they built the ark so they would live this message was not built so that we would die this message was here was sent to us so we would live [Applause] are you with me so far Moses prepared for victory he said or Noah rather prepared for victory God's word thus saith the Lord see right through on his word God said so Moses prepared for victory by coming in the presence of the burning bush we talked about that Wednesday night and again this morning a little bit how he come in the presence of the logos how he come in the presence of uh the warmth of the of the power of God God made his presence known to Moses brother Benson and stranger God Appears in fire he said they say this is Wildfire well I admit we got some wildfire I'll admit that today but I'd rather have a little Wildfire than no fire at all wouldn't you he said the trouble of it is with you teachers come on you're trying to sit back and say oh I'm good I enjoy a good teacher with the best of them but I want teaching that teaches me about possibilities not teaching is teaching me for failure I don't want a denominational Doctrine I don't want a doctor that doesn't know by the day whether I'm coming in or going out or what is truth and what's not truth we want teaching that teaches us about the word of God which shows us what our end is what our Victory is not teaching that prepares us for some oh every the message is being deceived and everybody's falling apart I I would like to contradict that today can we just contradict that and be like Joshua and Caleb and say we're more than able to take the land [Applause] let's prepare for victory amen the medicine you teachers you're trying to sit back and say back there on the day of Pentecost it's happening back there they had this he said you're trying to let the people that's cold get worn by painted flowers you can't warm by a picture yeah well you can't get well you can't Warren by a picture what's that what the heck's fun but what you got now that's it yeah you can't warn by painted fire talking to theology what they did back there what he was there he is now just the same Samson prepared for victory I buy a shamgar rather prepared for victory by encouraging his family yeah yeah do you know that brother Brandon said that the year before he put all the all the corn up and all the grain every year they come back down and stole it but it's silly prepared for the eventuality one day he was going to be an overcomer and so he put the he put it up some of you that are sick and you've been sick for a long time but every time you come to the house of the Lord every time you get down on your knees to pray you ought to prepare for victory you ought to put up put in more word more word more word more faith why because you're preparing not for defeat so I Was Defeated last year but this might be your year and shamgar stood there and brother remember this little Sandbar he he got his place filled up got his food all laid up his weed and all those the year before the Philistines took it away from him he said I can see him his poor little wife out there in the Seas all out of her dress and little children standing there real peeking their faces all drawn down about like some of these little churches have been kicked and beat oh feeling my oats tonight yes sir I don't have to preach three services like some of these little churches that's been been kicked and Beat Around by some of these theological Cemetery embalmers he said you know that puts me in mind of a morgue they take a dead man that's already dead shoot a lot of fluid into him to be sure he stays dead it ain't good when they don't stay dead because your job is to be the embalmer right that's what they are that's that's all their purpose is shoot fluid in a dead man to make sure he stays there but we're not here to embalm dead people we're not here to shoot fluid in a man's ideas to make them stay dead we're here to preach we're here to raise the Dead we're here to preach the gospel of Resurrection the gospel of Life yeah that don't believe that stuff that's what the embalmers say so don't go around one of the meetings nothing but a bunch of fanatics that's what the embalmers say I don't want to be an embalmer to you that's what the embalmers say he said that's the way they do just keep him dead don't go around one of the meetings done but a bunch of Finance oh mercy how can you believe he said then I can see this great big bin of wheat he said well now honey I hear shamgar saying now sweetheart maybe the children maybe we got the Harvest in maybe we can feed them a little bit we're going to have a Revival pretty soon maybe some of these people he said have a little he said you know how the pastor gets his church set up to the place it's what we're doing today yeah all right we're getting ready yeah our meeting coming say well what's going to happen after the meeting we'll get ready for the next service and the next thing you know what we're really getting ready for get ready for the Rapture we're preparing to go home there's another meeting in the air hey man but we're getting ready did the pastor gets his church set up to the place and the first thing you know shamgar was standing there talking to his wife and she looked so pale I could see the tears on his cheeks poor little thing she starved to death these little children how hungry they look no clothes on Philistines big old fat potato bug where's the picture right there big old fat potato bug Philistine come right in take it right out just as fast as he can make it he said that's the way the devil will do yeah chop it right away from you take everything you can get come right around rob you if every bit of experience you've got take everything away from you telling you there's no such a thing pointing to some old crowbate laying on the bank what is important to some scarecrow something that that failed something that didn't work but that's not what we're pointing to we're pointing to the word of God we are not a bunch of Pentecostals with a bunch of emotion without a word we have an open book we're standing here with an open book we have a message of the hour that's a reality to us do you believe that today I want to back up for nobody we're not confused about how many gods there are we're not confused how to baptize we're not confused how to raise our children we're not confused oh my we're not confused whether or not to have church we know what God taught us we know what a prophet said in this hour and because we know where we're standing we know who we are we can Rejoice with the best of them yes sir because we know who we are as righteous in the nation Rose he grabbed that Ox goat jumped to the window and challenge 600 Philistines stood there and beat their heads in what was he doing though he's before he went and beat the Philistines head in he was preparing his family for victory yeah and it's not always going to be this way we're not always going to live under this we're not always going to be like this it's not always there's coming a day when there when there's no more sorrow when there's no more pain there's Victory ahead [Applause] [Music] well that's good yes he said not a warrior not at all but he was an Israelite he was circumcised if tonight you're circumcised with the Holy Ghost you don't have to wait till you're trained to be a warrior God bless your heart claim your god-given privilege and beat their heads in how many want to do that in this meeting I'm going to do that tonight claim your god-giving privilege and in quit giving in to him every time he says boo at you like the man had the dream he said every time he said the devil said boo he got smaller but when he said boo bath and the devil got smaller David prepared for victory yeah yeah how'd he do he come in the name of the Lord that's what we come in tonight we're not confused about what name we come in we come in the name of the Lord first Samuel 17 45 David said to the Philistine thou cometh to me with a sword with a spear with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom that has to fight and you knew whose name he came in because it worked you know if you got the right name because if you got the right name it works there's power in the name of Jesus if you got the name it works [Music] Here Come Little David brother said just the bouncing in the spirit you know I told you this morning I've read you I've read you everything brother Branham said as far as I know both sides however the brown talked about Still Waters Run Deep and all of these things but there's a time that you need that Stillness there's a time you need that death there's a time you need to be bouncing in the spirit everything has a place we realize that there's a time for all of those things but there's a time you need to get excited sometimes you need to get in the spirit of God just get to bouncing in the spirit Hahaha he said oh what a Holy Roller Victory already all right David had Victory before he ever cut the Giant's head off before he ever threw a stone before he ever picked up a stone he already had the victory and Saul in his army were already defeated before they ever faced the Giant because they couldn't believe that they could ever face that giant and win so they cowered in their tits when they should have went out and faced it but instead of doing that they were shaking in their boots but David was dancing why he was bouncing in the spirit because he had already got the victory he had prepared for it he'd come in the name of the Lord Oh my he said why he placed the name of the Lord God of Israel before him all devils in Hell couldn't wait across that Little David just a dancing in the spirit Oh Glory Hallelujah and brother Brown talks about David being a dancer he said David was a dancer yes he said he was dancing one day and and here come uh here his wife looked out the window and saw him she was embarrassed by him he said if you don't like that watch this he danced with some more huh it's a dancer again there there's a place you don't dance just to dance I'm asking somebody told you to dance but if you ever got your your your feet baptized with fire Hallelujah you close brother talks about that Turtle it couldn't find a way to make him move all right yeah but there's one way to make a turtle move put fire under it yeah build a fire on him some of some of us Turtles would move and so if we had a fire under us I'll include myself in there for the herald some of us Turtles would move with a fire built thunderous I'll tell you that's what we need it's a fire of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what if you're a dancer some people aren't dancers some people probably shouldn't dance but if you're if you're a person that dances when you get the victory if you get the close enough to the fire you'll dance if you're a person that shouts when you get to Victory you when you get close enough to the fire you'll Shout are you with me now amen my goodness David was a dancer he said here he went up there just to dancing in the spirit as hard as she could Why by faith he saw the victory glory to God he saw the victory he took his little old sling in there one of these stones and he even dance and here it comes coming around all right oh he said what was it he had five they were both laughing at the other one Goliath was laughing at David because he was an insignificant little little young man didn't mean nothing to the world he was laughing at David but David was laughing at Goliath because he knew he'd come in the name of the Lord he knew he had the victory and what was he said he had five stones f-i-a-f-a-i-t-h and five fingers wrapped this string around j-e-s-u-s he said here he comes oh brother look out Goliath you got to fall when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold of that little Old Stone and picked up a speed about a thousand miles per second struck that giant between the face and he fell forward yeah he said there goes David Marching In pulling old Goliath's head behind in Victory God prepared him a man to take care of it why can't he go why can't he haul the head of Goliath behind him because he went up dancing believe him Hallelujah the upper room just one more example here and we'll move on in the upper room brother man said brother about several hundred years after that the Church of God will become tied down yeah get tied down sometimes but I can hear one thing saying behold I send a promise for the father upon you I want this gospel preached in all the world I want science to follow the Believers I want to heal the sick till I come again I'm going away but I give you the keys to the kingdom whatever you ask him my name that I'll do but before you do this I got to prepare you he said they climbed up the hillside something to the temple stayed in the upper room until all of a sudden they got to a place one said I don't care if I'm a Methodist oh my God another one said I don't care if I'm a Baptist God don't you see what we've gotten to do if we're not careful we've gotten carnal yeah yeah I'm a Word of Life Tabernacle almost so and so whatever it is but we've gotten carnal said are you not yet carnal he said when they got up in the upper room they all come in one Accord in one place and they say I don't care if I'm a Baptist or a sad you see all he said until all the differences got out of them amen and when they did they started blessing God and about that time the preparation Come From Heaven oh this is the preparation that we need cloven tongues like fire and they come out and they begin to stagger like drunk men but the man said they Spilled Out the windows they spilled down into the street staggering like drunk men he said that was God's preparation God hasn't changed his plan that was to be until Jesus come back again it sounds ridiculous to an ordinary man why the very idea you mean I have to go down and act like a maniac he said you'll either do that or stay out either one you want to yeah I'd rather prepare for victory Jehoshaphat made preparations for a battle that he knew he couldn't win by himself let's just be honest with each other we're living in a time when you can't win against Leo to see it by yourself you can't win against the enemy let's come up ahead in front of you by yourself you can't win against that cancer by yourself you can't win against that Stroke by yourself you can't win against that heart disease by yourself you can't win against old age by yourself slow down preach amen that's the age we're living in you can't win by yourself and Jehoshaphat knew all these other tribes and kingdoms had come up against him and he knew militarily there was no way there was no Hope of Victory and so what did he do he started praying and fasting yeah yeah now that'd do us some good it'd be all right to pray and fast a little bit and see if God would move because we know we can't have a successful service without the spirit of God it is not because we're talented that we can feel the presence of God if you were here Wednesday night we felt the presence of the Lord so rich in the building you can't make that happen you don't do that by Talent you don't come before even our regular Services you don't make that happen or our meetings you don't make that happen by Talent it's God chooses to come Among Us we can't win on our own all we can do is ask God lord would you help me would you help me I can't do it but I'm coming in your name and I'm going to believe you I'm gonna believe your word hey you've heard you've probably heard me preach on this before but I just want to encourage you with this before we before we go now Joshua fat began to pray in the fast and spirit of God began to move in the congregation yeah I like that in verse 14 it tells us that that a levite of the sons of asaph begin to prophesy the spirit of the Lord and Mystic congregation I don't know this but he is a singer because he's sons of asaph and we know he's a singer right so I don't know how he prophesied but I think maybe he prophesied in song because he actually that would be his job that would be his office the spirit of the Lord might not come like he would have Prophet or something else but it was on him as it was a it was a prophecy in song you believe you can prophesy when you sing yeah every time you think I'm going to make it he already said that I could what do you do and you're prophesying you're prophesying in music so now Jehoshaphat that's why it's so bad when you go out in the world you begin to get these worldly music look at the confession of it and some Christian music by the way is that way as well so-called Christian the confession is Doom and Gloom the confession as well all my all my problems all my might as well get and get my beer and begin to drink it that's not what the confession of a Christian ought to be I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry well you got a friend who sits closer than a brother [Applause] you got somebody that'll stick with you aren't you glad for that today make preparations for victory not for defeat so he's saying he he gave them a prophecy prophesied perhaps through his music and he said hearken y'all Judah you inhabitants of Jerusalem Thou King Jehoshaphat does saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's tomorrow go you down against him behold they come up by the Cliff of this you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jerusalem you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves I love this stand you still now they've still had to prepare they still had to go up they still carried weapons but he said when you get there Hallelujah you're not gonna have to fight the fighting's gonna be done for you amen he said set yourself stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem you can preach gloom and doom if you want to but I want to preach something that'll cause the people to set themselves yeah stand still and see the salvation of the Lord fear not or be displayed tomorrow go out against him for the Lord will be with you Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the cohathites of the children of the Court had stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a a loud voice huh a loud voice on high so they got up on a platform [Laughter] and people had to start putting their earplugs in oh we don't allow such as that sometimes when you need a victory you might want to allow it you hadn't had a victory in 70 years maybe you need to let somebody get up on the platform sing with a loud voice [Applause] they stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and they Rose early in the morning oh my after being encouraged by the singing They Rose early in the morning went forth Into the Wilderness of Toccoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said now here he's going to preach to him he's going to tell them what the word says hear him heal Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe his Prophet so shall you prosper believe what the spirit spoke to you believe what came what the word the book that was open in your hours when you consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord watch that they should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army this is a strange Army they weren't just a marching band out there just got to keep the people in line and Rhythm but this was a a bunch of singers going out saying praise the Lord the Lord is beautiful the Lord is Beauty and his Holiness he's beautiful in his simple he's Mighty in his accent they're going I'm praising God walking before the Army can you imagine how that encouraged the army hear the musicians of them singers as they got up there they'd prayed up they got ready before the man you just come dragging in but but he's had him get up early in the morning and he had him go in front of the people and he said now you go and you you seen something that'll help him he went out before the Army and say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they begin to sing now watch somebody's got to sing somebody's got to praise we can all praise can't we we may not all be able to sing although when we sing a congregational song We ought to all sing but we may not all be able to sing but we can all praise and the Bible says when they began to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount fear which will come against Judah and they were smitten yes for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount fear utterly to say and Destroy them in other words they started fighting amongst themselves let the enemy do that come on could we just do that let the Enemy Fight among himself we don't want to do that that's not what the people of God do you don't ever find the people of God begin to fight among themselves defeating themselves not when they were led by God not when they were following the word but it was always the enemy a camp in confusion turns on its own as the famous the Roman general famously went into the camp for the of Carthage and the first Carthage I think did it to them and then they turned around did it to Carthage they went into the camp at night and they set fires everywhere yeah and when they set a fire everybody wakes up oh no a fire I'm gonna fight who said it and kill them there's stumbling around the dark and they go out and kill somebody and kill him they're killing their own men yeah why because a camp in confusion fights among themselves but the Romans knew if they could get the camp and disarray the next day the battle would be easy oh God help us if you just recognize today that's what the enemy is trying to do why don't we turn that around on him when we come together in unity and we begin to sing and to praise I don't care what somebody says about me I don't care if I get to be the main one in the kitchen or not I don't care if I get to be the main one in the church or not I don't care if I can get to sing a special I don't care if anybody knows my name I'm gonna come put my shoulder to the wheel I'm gonna be one who sits in the house of God and worships God and Praises God and when I I'm not gonna fight among the people I'm gonna fight the enemy [Applause] when they begin to praise God the enemy became in confusion everyone helping to destroy another Spirit of Satan yeah People Help destroy somebody see somebody wounded laying on the ground yeah walk by and put a spear in them yeah Spirit of Satan yeah remember the man that come to David and Saul had been laying there on his sword he tried to commit suicide he wasn't able to and the man run to David thinking David would reward him because he killed Saul Saul even asked him to anyone thinking to get a reward and David killed him said don't touch God's anointed yeah you don't kill the man of slaying on the ground shoot him full of poison yeah words of poison I need to watch what we say are you hearing me tonight oh look we don't need to we don't need to do that let God take care of it let God fight our battles they helped to destroy one another when Judah come towards the Watchtower in the wilderness they looked to the multitude behold there were dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and then escaped walked out there expecting this great battle but God said I'm going to fight for you but here they come out and they begin to walk out and begin to look well there's there's that cancer it's dead yeah yeah look at this right there's that that unforgiveness the thing I held my heart for so long but when I began to praise when I began to partake in the meeting it began to leave me yeah yeah there's that squabble between the husband and a wife instead there's that that church problem there there's that there's that sickness all those things whatever it is that's going on in your life they begin to walk around and they begin to look they're dead they can't hurt me no more what did Miriam do when she realized that her taskmasters had been destroyed she began to sing and begin to dance because there had been a victory Victory had been prepared for them he said and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies now think about this for a moment if you've ever killed a spirit in your life how many have ever had God just come in and take something away from them I probably all have at some point now what what happens is when you lose that you also gain something because what was happening is that Spirit was clogging you up you were unable because that Spirit was hogging all the all the gold and all the silver that Spirit was hugging all the precious jewels that Spirit was hugging your joy it was taken away every time you saw that brother you just oh you just couldn't stand it but when God took that away from you when you let it go and and you begin to praise God and that thing began to leave all of a sudden you begin to realize there's joy there's peace there's long suffering there's a fruits of spirit why there were great riches among the dead bodies precious jewels which they stripped out for themselves and more than they could carry and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much and on the fourth day they assembled themselves they had a meeting you know when we should kill the those things tonight [Music] don't spend one more night with the frogs that's what Pharaoh decided he'd do he put it off for another day just had that many more problems to deal with why spend one more night with a bunch of dead stinking frogs why spend one more night with a bunch of plagues falling all around you why spend one more night Let it go Let the Body die let the old flesh and your old feelings and the old things die away so that you can gather on the fourth day Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday if you gather on Wednesday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday get rid of it today by the fourth day you'll be ready to have church [Music] lay it down Let It Go all right say well they haven't let it go it doesn't matter but don't you want them Jewels yeah don't you want that Joy don't you want that peace don't don't look away for them to let it go you can take it from them let that body die yes on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Baraka for there they bless the Lord Baraka means the valley of blessing oh my God I love this not because not because God blessed them in the valley but because they blessed God in the valley oh God let my valleys be named the valley of blessing not because I was blessed in the valley but because my day when I didn't feel like it when I didn't know when I didn't have a way to go he blessed me in the valley it's spite of my struggles in spite of my circumstances he blessed me anyway they called it the valley of blessing for there they blessed the Lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of Baraka and to this day and they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem and Jehoshaphat in the Forefront of them to go again to Jerusalem yawning I wish he'd let go 10 minutes earlier we'd have 10 more minutes to drive home oh I'll tell you what all these Church problems I'm about to sit at home until they're solved sit you sit at home they might be I'm telling you to stay home but be better just lay that thing down let that be one of the dead bodies or if I'm the church problem let me die to myself that may be crucified [Applause] they didn't go back with sad long faces they didn't go back tattling on their neighbors what do they do they returned to Jerusalem with joy with joy for the Lord to be the Rejoice other enemies what do we read this morning when we come in to Zion when we get to heaven what are we going to do therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall
