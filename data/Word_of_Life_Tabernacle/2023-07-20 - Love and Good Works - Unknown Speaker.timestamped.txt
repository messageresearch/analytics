[35:24] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 19 we're going
[35:26] to read down through verse 25.
[35:30] Hebrews 10 19-25
[35:33] such a blessing to be in the house of
[35:35] the Lord one of the brothers over the
[35:38] weekend said let's make Church
[35:39] attendance great again and
[35:41] so it is great to be in the house of the
[35:44] Lord amen and so good to see all of you
[35:46] I know some are gone but the Harvey took
[35:49] his wife out for their anniversary and
[35:51] took her somewhere so I thank the Lord
[35:53] for for these deacons and faithful
[35:56] people that we have and all of you
[35:57] you're faithful to the house of the Lord
[35:59] Hebrews 10 19 says having therefore
[36:03] Brethren boldness to enter into the
[36:06] holiest by the blood of Jesus
[36:09] that means there's nothing off limits to
[36:12] a child of God the very presence the
[36:15] very Shekinah presence of God himself is
[36:18] open to The Believer by a New and Living
[36:21] Way which he hath consecrated for us
[36:24] through the veil that is to say his
[36:26] flesh
[36:27] and having an high priest over the house
[36:30] of God
[36:32] let us draw near with a True Heart in
[36:36] full Assurance of Faith having our
[36:39] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
[36:41] our bodies washed with pure water
[36:45] let us hold fast the profession of our
[36:48] faith without wavering
[36:50] or he is faithful that promised
[36:53] and let us consider one another to
[36:56] provoke unto love and to Good Works
[36:59] not forsaking the assembling of
[37:01] ourselves together as the manner of some
[37:03] is but exhorting one another and so much
[37:06] the more as you see the day approaching
[37:08] I pray the Lord with that is blessing to
[37:10] the word you may be seated
[37:14] Paul is speaking to born-again believers
[37:17] saints of God I believe we're preaching
[37:20] to the Saints here tonight on a
[37:21] Wednesday night a people who know God
[37:24] people who have had an experience with
[37:27] God not only an experience with God but
[37:29] who have walked with God people people
[37:31] who have seen a change in their life and
[37:33] and they know what it is to come before
[37:35] God they know you know what it is to
[37:38] approach the grace of God with boldness
[37:40] to come boldly Before the Throne of God
[37:43] you know what it is to make mistakes but
[37:45] you also know what it is to be forgiven
[37:47] and and so you have a boldness about you
[37:50] and you have a high priest that can be
[37:52] touched by the feeling of your infirmity
[37:55] aren't you glad for that tonight our
[37:58] great High priests that can be touched
[37:59] in that way of
[38:01] I I don't want to hold you long tonight
[38:03] but I want to look at these scriptures
[38:05] as they as I was reading them earlier
[38:07] this week it struck my heart that we we
[38:09] are too if we're in this condition if we
[38:12] are the children of God if we have
[38:14] boldness to come before God if we have a
[38:17] high priest he said let us
[38:20] in other words there's something that
[38:21] we're supposed to do after having he's
[38:25] done so much for us he's given us so
[38:28] much and he's blessed us so much can you
[38:30] say Amen to that tonight he we are
[38:33] blessed as brother window preached the
[38:34] other night we are a blessed people he
[38:36] said but let us
[38:38] so the US he's talking about is us
[38:41] saints of God children of God Believers
[38:45] as we would say today of the message of
[38:47] the hour
[38:48] let us
[38:50] that's who he's talking to and so verse
[38:54] 22 he said 22 he said let us draw near
[38:58] huh let us join here and I would say
[39:01] this to you that once you've been born
[39:03] again once you've you've had an
[39:05] experience with God once you you you've
[39:08] believed the message of that or maybe
[39:09] you've been walking that way for years
[39:11] but now is not the time to to go back
[39:14] now is not the time to fall off now is
[39:17] not the time to get lukewarm but now is
[39:19] the time to let us draw near
[39:22] draw near that's something we have to do
[39:25] now God has done so much for us but
[39:27] we've got to draw near
[39:29] it's available to us the way it's open
[39:32] Calvary paid for for our an atonement
[39:35] for us but brother Harold we have to
[39:37] draw near
[39:38] we've got to Kindle that passion as
[39:41] brother window talked about on a Sunday
[39:43] we've got to do that and so we have
[39:45] boldness we we are able to approach the
[39:48] grace of God let us draw near
[39:50] let me just say Amen to that tonight
[39:53] let us draw near
[39:55] with a True Heart
[39:57] or a sincerity
[40:00] brother Brandon when he had that Vision
[40:02] about the Mambo which was the snake and
[40:04] there's a lot to that Vision I preached
[40:06] on it to you before but how that the
[40:09] vision of the snake when he saw it and
[40:11] it was the last serpent that would be
[40:12] defeated he said it was death it
[40:15] represented death and this message is a
[40:18] is a message that causes us to overcome
[40:21] death
[40:22] right we're going home there's we will
[40:24] not all sleep but we shall all be
[40:26] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[40:27] of an eye and so there had to be that
[40:29] death had to be defeated and brother
[40:31] Branham not knowing what to do he stood
[40:33] there and he asked the angel he said
[40:34] what shall I do and he said you've got
[40:36] to be more sincere than what you are now
[40:40] he's speaking to a prophet of God who
[40:42] had drawn near with sincerity but he
[40:44] said there's a higher place you can come
[40:46] to there's there's a greater sincerity
[40:48] that you can come to I believe that's
[40:50] true for us church as much as we've
[40:53] heard and as much as we know and as much
[40:55] as we've experienced of the presence of
[40:57] God as much of the goodness of God as we
[40:59] fail over the weekend we can still draw
[41:01] near there's a place for us there's
[41:04] there's a there's a sincerity a level of
[41:06] sincerity that we can come to
[41:10] let us strong here
[41:12] with a true heart with sincerity in full
[41:16] Assurance of faith
[41:20] Hallelujah so our sincerity does not
[41:23] make us question our salvation
[41:26] but in our sincerity we are to have a
[41:29] full Assurance of faith
[41:31] knowing that we have been born again
[41:34] and we live in that age of full
[41:36] assurance
[41:37] this is the age of that brother random
[41:39] said this he said my Ministry is not to
[41:42] personally contact each one it's to
[41:44] bring forth the full Assurance of the
[41:47] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and tell
[41:50] them look and live
[41:52] so in other words he's saying my my
[41:54] Ministry is not just to lay hands on
[41:56] people and heal the sick but it's to
[41:58] cause the people to know but Alan that
[42:00] that Christ has is risen from the dead
[42:02] that he's alive
[42:04] and people miss that many times we miss
[42:06] the uh the forest for the trees we we
[42:09] see all the little doctrines and little
[42:11] things but his ministry was to show us
[42:13] that Jesus Christ is still the same
[42:16] yesterday today and forever to show us
[42:18] that he is there is a resurrected Lord
[42:20] Jesus who's alive today
[42:22] and who's able to take care of what we
[42:25] need today how many believe that today
[42:28] is to bring that full assurance
[42:30] and and so Paul says full Assurance
[42:33] comes
[42:34] from having your heart sprinkled
[42:36] to cleanse from a guilty conscience
[42:39] and that's what it's going to take
[42:41] because all of us could have a guilty
[42:43] conscience tonight but you need your
[42:45] heart sprinkled by the word of God by
[42:48] the blood of God all desire of sin to be
[42:51] gone
[42:52] and though you make mistakes but the
[42:54] desire is to serve God your want to has
[42:58] been changed
[42:59] your bodies have been cleansed Paul says
[43:02] by pure water the washing of water of
[43:06] the word aren't you glad for that today
[43:09] so he said let us draw near
[43:12] now in verse 23 that's we're going to
[43:15] get down to where I what I want to talk
[43:16] about tonight he said let us
[43:19] again
[43:21] all right he's not talking to the
[43:23] Baptist or the Methodist or somebody
[43:25] else down the street or another church
[43:26] he's talking to us
[43:29] let us someone say let us
[43:33] let us hold fast
[43:36] let us put our anchor down
[43:39] let us hold fast the profession of our
[43:43] faith without wavering for he is
[43:46] faithful that promise the profession is
[43:48] the confession of our faith let us hold
[43:52] our confession without wavering right in
[43:56] other words I know that God sent a
[43:58] prophet without wavering I know I've
[44:00] been born again without wavering I know
[44:03] I'm a Child of God without wavering let
[44:07] us hold fast no matter what comes or
[44:09] goes no matter what wind blows no matter
[44:11] how many times the devil tries to come
[44:13] and say oh there's nothing to the
[44:15] message of the hour there's nothing to
[44:16] the preaching of the word there's
[44:18] nothing to the move of the spirit let us
[44:20] hold fast
[44:22] let us hold fast it's important for our
[44:24] children that we hold fast it's
[44:27] important for our families that we hold
[44:30] fast
[44:31] let us hold our profession or our
[44:33] confession without wavering
[44:36] for he is faithful the promise he said
[44:39] he would heal me I believe it he said he
[44:43] would save my children I believe it he
[44:45] said there would be a people a bride
[44:47] without spotter wrinkle I believe it let
[44:49] us hold fast our confession
[44:52] without wavering
[44:54] he is faithful that promise
[44:57] so the Amplified version of that says
[44:59] this way so let us seize and hold fast
[45:03] and retain without wavering the hope we
[45:07] cherish and confess and our
[45:10] acknowledgment of it for he who promised
[45:13] is reliable and faithful to his word
[45:17] brother Brown speaking about that that
[45:19] verse he said but when we woke up before
[45:21] God
[45:22] let's not go saying well now I just
[45:25] wonder if everything is all right
[45:27] are you a Christian well I hope I am he
[45:30] said that's no way to come
[45:32] brother believe the story
[45:35] accept it and be born again then walk up
[45:38] with pure faith knowing this that God
[45:41] has promised and God can't lie how many
[45:44] believe that tonight
[45:46] promised and God can't lie
[45:48] God promised me eternal life if I
[45:50] believed on his son Jesus Christ I
[45:52] believed it and he'd give me eternal
[45:54] life he said I made many mistakes I
[45:56] still make them we'll always make them
[45:59] but when I make them the Holy Spirit
[46:01] tells me that's wrong then I Repent
[46:03] right there Lord forgive me didn't mean
[46:05] to do it you helped me now
[46:07] and I walk right on the same thing
[46:09] because just no sooner than it goes from
[46:11] my lips if we confess our sins he is
[46:14] just to forgive them
[46:16] he said is that right Hallelujah the
[46:18] devil say you know what I'll tell you
[46:20] you were supposed to go do a certain
[46:22] thing you didn't do it
[46:23] has ever told you that
[46:26] huh you didn't do it all oh you sinned
[46:29] didn't you say I confessed it
[46:32] well I tell you no don't talk to me
[46:36] I'm not gonna come to before God I'm not
[46:39] going to come before the throne of grace
[46:40] with a wavering confession
[46:43] so he's tell the Devil he's going to
[46:45] talk to me no sir I have perfect faith
[46:48] in he who told me
[46:50] oh do you have perfect faith in him
[46:52] tonight not perfect faith in myself but
[46:54] perfect faith in him
[46:56] and he who told me if I confess my
[46:59] wrongs he would forgive me
[47:00] so I confess it just go on away from me
[47:03] I don't care nothing about you anyhow so
[47:06] just keep moving on
[47:08] right I don't care nothing about the
[47:10] devil he is but Jesus said it this way
[47:11] he has nothing in me
[47:13] yes he has no part with me there is
[47:16] there's no part that the devil has with
[47:18] us he don't want nothing to do with us
[47:19] just tell him to quit talking
[47:21] shut up devil
[47:24] all right just quit talking just confess
[47:27] it hold your confession without wavering
[47:30] walk boldly he said right on into it if
[47:33] death lays there that's all right move
[47:35] right on with it move right on into it
[47:37] with a perfect faith that God has
[47:39] promised he would raise you up at the
[47:41] last days
[47:42] oh isn't that wonderful
[47:44] let us
[47:46] oh this is simple tonight but I just
[47:48] something I wanted to get to
[47:51] I know you're all tired I'm tired from
[47:54] the weekend and y'all work so hard but
[47:57] let us let us take a moment
[47:59] and look at where we're at
[48:02] just examine our own lives let us
[48:05] let us and let's reflect on what we were
[48:09] doing this weekend
[48:11] what were we doing let us
[48:14] let us consider one another
[48:17] all right that's what we were doing
[48:19] considering one another
[48:21] that word consider means to take careful
[48:24] note of each other's spiritual welfare
[48:28] it denotes attentive Continuous Care
[48:31] yeah like the care that you give to a
[48:34] child
[48:34] when they're out on the parking lot and
[48:36] they're running around you know they're
[48:37] there so you're all they're always on
[48:38] your mind and you're always thinking
[48:40] about you want to make sure they didn't
[48:41] cross the across the the street and go
[48:44] off in the woods somewhere you always
[48:46] have to know where they're at if they
[48:47] get too quiet you go looking for them
[48:49] right it's careful a tentative
[48:52] Continuous Care let us consider one
[48:55] another
[48:56] in other words so I should consider I
[48:59] should consider whether brother Peter
[49:00] maybe he's gotten down and or gotten a
[49:03] little bit worried about something I
[49:04] should consider brother Peter and when I
[49:07] do something I want to consider brother
[49:08] Peter make sure that it doesn't harm him
[49:11] right as preachers we should have the
[49:13] same motto that that the doctors have
[49:15] first Do no harm
[49:17] right because we can do a lot of harm
[49:19] so before we go to fix anything let's
[49:22] see let's consider one another before we
[49:25] go to say something to somebody
[49:27] before we go to do what God has called
[49:29] us to do let's consider one another
[49:32] and what I'm doing really helpful is it
[49:35] really helpful to the body
[49:37] oh I was so happy to see so many people
[49:39] working together and and putting their
[49:42] shoulder to the wheel you don't know
[49:43] what that does for me because I see that
[49:45] as real Christianity because as much as
[49:49] I love the shouting and the running and
[49:51] the and all of that that that's part of
[49:52] it we want that we want to move in the
[49:54] spirit but real Christianity is when you
[49:57] see somebody staying late when they
[49:58] didn't have to pick it up after people
[50:00] when they wouldn't have to yeah
[50:03] helping people when they wouldn't have
[50:05] to caring about somebody else who could
[50:07] never care back for them who wouldn't do
[50:10] it for them
[50:11] but they care anyway while you're
[50:13] considering one another let us
[50:16] right so you said we're I'm born again
[50:18] I'm a Child of God
[50:20] let us consider one another
[50:23] it's what I'm doing good for the body
[50:26] let's consider one another take careful
[50:28] note of each other's spiritual welfare
[50:30] that's not just the pastor that's all of
[50:32] us
[50:34] can't tell you whether Harvey's gone
[50:35] tonight so I'll brag on him he don't
[50:36] have internet so
[50:39] I know they're not watching
[50:43] brother Harvey is uh
[50:45] if God can't count how many times that
[50:48] some of you all have walked in and
[50:49] brother Harvey will come tell me but the
[50:50] so-and-so was just a little bit
[50:52] a little bit down today you may want to
[50:54] check on him
[50:56] but so-and-so look they're going through
[50:57] something I talk to them they're going
[50:59] through something that's considering one
[51:01] another
[51:02] now that's his job as a deacon one of
[51:04] one of his many jobs as a deacon that's
[51:06] all of our jobs
[51:08] not just the deacons consider one
[51:10] another
[51:11] and you kind of you have to think about
[51:14] people
[51:15] what would I be in I was trying today I
[51:19] sometimes we can't see from the other
[51:20] person's viewpoint
[51:22] and we're on this mountain and we're
[51:24] looking over at the other mountains
[51:25] saying why are they acting like they're
[51:26] acting we can't see
[51:28] if we could ever go out into the other
[51:30] mountain and we'd look back at us and
[51:32] say well that's why
[51:33] right we can't see and so things look
[51:36] different from somebody else's
[51:37] perspective
[51:38] you may not always understand what the
[51:40] pastor is doing because he many times
[51:43] the pastor stands on his own Mountain
[51:45] you can't he's in an office that you
[51:47] don't have
[51:48] a deacon the same way a trustee the same
[51:51] way you don't always understand what
[51:52] people are doing but it's because you
[51:53] don't have that office you don't see
[51:54] what they see
[51:56] right and many times that's what happens
[51:58] to us as Christians just we look at
[51:59] other churches why do they do things the
[52:01] way they do well maybe it's not right
[52:02] but maybe they we don't see what they
[52:04] see
[52:05] but let us consider one another
[52:08] is that okay let's consider one another
[52:11] let's like take careful note of the
[52:14] spiritual welfare of the people in the
[52:15] body
[52:16] especially in our own church but as
[52:18] other churches as well even
[52:27] even so let's consider one another let
[52:30] us provoke
[52:32] some of you said amen praise the Lord
[52:36] all right oh but it don't stop there
[52:40] let us provoke
[52:42] now that we're provoking the in the in
[52:45] the original is is what it sounds like
[52:48] it's a view to incitement
[52:50] it's to stimulate it's provocation
[52:53] irritation
[52:55] contention
[52:57] right and I can't help but think of of
[53:00] someone who's ever met a person who's
[53:02] real peppy in the mornings
[53:05] and they just they get up and it's just
[53:07] everything's good it had flowers and
[53:10] Daisy whoa it's so wonderful you know
[53:12] and you ever met you ever worked for
[53:14] somebody like that my goodness I'm a
[53:16] morning person but not like that
[53:20] it'll just drive you crazy it's irritant
[53:23] but they're always talking to you but
[53:25] you know what if you watch it after a
[53:27] while you get in a better mood yourself
[53:30] because that person's in a good mood
[53:32] they let everybody know it they're
[53:34] they're irritating something but not to
[53:36] in a bad way
[53:38] the Hebrew derivation of this word is a
[53:42] splinter
[53:44] let us be a splinter
[53:48] hahaha
[53:49] and this is an encouraging splinter
[53:53] yes you get a splinter under your
[53:54] fingernail by The Herald or something
[53:55] you just just always staring you
[53:59] try to get rid of it
[54:02] but this is what he's saying when he
[54:03] says exhort one another to attend church
[54:08] be a splinter under each other's nail if
[54:10] you have to
[54:12] just make sure you're okay
[54:16] all right let us
[54:18] provoke
[54:20] that's like a like a friend who reminds
[54:22] you you're on a diet
[54:24] huh like somebody will remind you you're
[54:27] going to the gym
[54:29] are you with me now
[54:30] let's stir up good works
[54:33] and love
[54:35] so brother random takes it this way he
[54:37] said provoke their means to encourage
[54:39] so it's that constant encouragement
[54:41] let's see it's not in a bad way at all
[54:42] it's that constant encouragement
[54:45] encourage one another into love into
[54:47] good works
[54:48] now watch it's got to be you first have
[54:50] to encourage them to love and then to
[54:53] good works because without love you
[54:56] can't do the good works that that a
[54:58] Christian would do because the good
[55:00] works that a Christian does are not
[55:01] forced on the Christian they're not
[55:04] they're not something a Christian does
[55:05] just because well I should do that
[55:07] that's not what it is at all but it's
[55:09] the fruit of a Christian Life
[55:11] good works to a Christian is just what a
[55:14] Christian is
[55:15] and so it's the night it's a it's the
[55:18] gifts or the fruits of the spirit rather
[55:19] that are operating in the life of the
[55:22] Christian and so he said if you see a
[55:24] brother in the church that's got
[55:25] something against the other brother
[55:27] don't say something to stir that thing
[55:29] up
[55:31] don't say something to stir that thing
[55:33] up but say something that'll bring them
[55:35] together
[55:37] that's a real world application isn't it
[55:39] that was your quote brother Joel
[55:43] I'd say like brother Wendell say that's
[55:44] your opportunity to shout
[55:48] don't say something to stirred up say
[55:50] something that'll bring them together
[55:52] provoke one another into good works and
[55:54] to love is what we must do
[55:57] it's what we must do you say well I I
[56:00] must wear long hair if I'm a woman I
[56:02] must have a dress that covers me I must
[56:05] if I'm a man not cussed and not drinking
[56:07] I smoke but a prophet of God said we
[56:09] must
[56:10] encourage one another
[56:12] we must provoke one another to Good
[56:15] Works into love
[56:17] we it's what we must do it wasn't just
[56:19] written to be nice Paul's not just
[56:21] giving us filler
[56:23] he's not just saying it because it's
[56:25] something to say
[56:27] it means every bit as much as every
[56:29] other part of the Bible
[56:30] provoke one another unto love and good
[56:34] works by your example I believe you did
[56:36] that this weekend you were encouraging
[56:38] other people to work harder encouraging
[56:41] others to do better encourage how are
[56:43] you doing it by doing it yourself
[56:48] oh my I love that I love to see that
[56:51] what is that
[56:53] brother said that's a man that's born
[56:55] again
[56:57] he constantly reminded you can speak in
[56:59] tongues and not have it you you could
[57:02] run the aisles and not have you could
[57:03] shout and not have it but if you ever
[57:05] get to a place where you where the good
[57:08] works of Christ comes out of you out of
[57:10] From the Inside Man not from the outside
[57:13] that's a man that's born again one who
[57:16] provokes to good to love and to Good
[57:18] Works
[57:20] he said if you my my brother tonight
[57:22] don't feel that way when you see your
[57:24] brothers falling out and sharp words
[57:26] between one another if you don't feel
[57:29] like bringing them together
[57:32] let me make it as plain as I can Church
[57:35] he said it's your time to go to the
[57:37] altar
[57:39] if you like the fact that people are at
[57:42] Arts if you if you enjoy people making
[57:45] fun of one another and and laughing at
[57:47] one another and attacking one another
[57:51] now it's your time to go to the altar
[57:54] all right God help us tonight it's easy
[57:56] to do isn't it because people do stupid
[57:58] stuff
[58:00] and it's easy to just pick at them
[58:02] but what we should be doing is trying to
[58:04] bring them together
[58:06] he said that's right there is something
[58:07] happen in your life there is something
[58:10] Oh my he said if you don't feel that way
[58:12] there's something you've been deceived
[58:14] in
[58:15] you haven't the experience that God
[58:17] wants you to have I know that's hard
[58:18] church but it's what a prophet said
[58:21] he said for Jesus when he was reviled he
[58:23] reviled not again and when he was spoken
[58:26] evil of he spoke not back again and when
[58:28] they've done evil to him he turned and
[58:30] did good to them when they persecuted
[58:33] him and nailed him to the Cross we heard
[58:34] about that Saturday morning didn't we he
[58:36] looked down and said father forgive them
[58:39] for they don't know what they're doing
[58:42] he said if that kind of spirit is not in
[58:43] you the Holy Ghost has never entered you
[58:45] yet for that was the Same Spirit was on
[58:47] Christ Jesus the Bible said let it be in
[58:50] you Christ is in his church
[58:52] he said now Brandon Tabernacle you bunch
[58:54] here we don't have any organization
[58:56] don't have any sign cards and so forth
[58:58] the only thing we have here is
[58:59] fellowship
[59:01] he say to you who are fellowshipping in
[59:02] Jesus Christ with us tonight and
[59:04] fellowshipping every night and every
[59:06] time we're always happy to have you here
[59:08] we want you to be here he said you don't
[59:10] have to join us the only thing you have
[59:12] to do is come worship with us amen and
[59:15] we expect every one of you to hold the
[59:16] true mystery of God in your heart
[59:18] without wavering
[59:19] come to the worship
[59:21] and come to the altar he said brother
[59:24] Ben you know I'd be I'd be more
[59:26] comfortable with fewer people but the
[59:28] prophet of God said if you want to
[59:30] fellowship with us come to the worship
[59:32] come to the Altar and so forth and Love
[59:35] One Another Empty pews never inspired me
[59:37] to preach
[59:39] it's true but but I'm fine with it if
[59:42] that's what God wants me to preach to
[59:43] I'll preach to the ceiling if God wants
[59:45] to be preaching silly but I believe
[59:47] it'll do a whole lot more good if there
[59:48] were people here to hear us
[59:51] so he said if you come to the worship
[59:53] come to the Altar and somewhere love one
[59:54] another be in harmony with one another
[59:56] and if you see a brother getting out of
[59:58] the way go to him be reconciled with him
[1:00:00] if you can that's right he said that's
[1:00:02] what we got to do
[1:00:04] and friends if you ever what are you
[1:00:06] doing if you don't do that you're only
[1:00:07] making yourself a miserable creature not
[1:00:10] a Christian well that's hard that's what
[1:00:13] a prophet said that's right all that
[1:00:15] you're doing is in vain
[1:00:17] let us
[1:00:19] see how serious it is
[1:00:22] let us consider one another
[1:00:24] not a suggestion
[1:00:26] it's what God expects out of us
[1:00:28] let us consider one another let us
[1:00:31] provoke one another
[1:00:33] to love and good works there's got to
[1:00:35] come a point in time at which we
[1:00:37] actually become what we say
[1:00:40] and we actually begin to do what we say
[1:00:43] and say God help me tonight
[1:00:45] there's a certain amount of hypocrite in
[1:00:47] every person
[1:00:49] you know you're a three-part being
[1:00:50] there's a certain amount of you that's
[1:00:51] an unbeliever certain amount of you
[1:00:53] that's a make-believer
[1:00:55] but down on the inside there's a real
[1:00:56] seed of God I believe there is in every
[1:00:58] one of you tonight a real seed of God
[1:01:00] you're here on a Wednesday night
[1:01:01] somewhere there's a seed of God on the
[1:01:03] inside that begins as it grows whether
[1:01:05] it says it's like a button a little
[1:01:07] button of light but adjacent as you as
[1:01:09] you receive the Holy Spirit that's just
[1:01:11] a little glow he said of light when
[1:01:13] you're born again he said as you grow it
[1:01:15] just gets bigger and it gets bigger and
[1:01:16] bigger and finally it fills your whole
[1:01:19] body it's about time that it filled our
[1:01:21] whole body it's about time it filled our
[1:01:24] hands to do the work of God it's about
[1:01:26] time I filled our feet to go where God
[1:01:28] wants us to go it's about time they
[1:01:29] filled our tongues and caused us to
[1:01:31] Bridle our tongue
[1:01:34] it's about time the message become real
[1:01:38] instead of just being something we talk
[1:01:40] about it's something we debate about and
[1:01:42] something we argue about it's about time
[1:01:44] it become a reality and it affected us
[1:01:47] in our jobs it affected us at home it
[1:01:49] affected us on the street
[1:01:51] affected the way we think about people
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:55] and we know we are not saved by good
[1:01:57] works and we know that tonight
[1:02:00] there's a fruit
[1:02:02] of the tree
[1:02:04] they're the fruit the show what Vine it
[1:02:06] is the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:02:09] the branches do
[1:02:11] and the branch shows what the life is in
[1:02:13] the Vine
[1:02:15] good works glorify the father Matthew 5
[1:02:17] and 16 let your light so shine before
[1:02:19] men that they may see your good works
[1:02:21] and glorify your father which is in
[1:02:23] heaven
[1:02:26] I'm going to get real basic here for a
[1:02:28] moment
[1:02:29] because we live
[1:02:31] you know we don't live up here we live
[1:02:33] down here
[1:02:35] we live with our feet firmly planted on
[1:02:37] the earth if any of you don't let me
[1:02:39] know how you do that
[1:02:41] most of us we live down here
[1:02:44] and so I found that when it comes to
[1:02:47] good works for the body many times women
[1:02:50] are better at that than men
[1:02:54] it's just the truth and I want to honor
[1:02:57] you sisters in that and and we're going
[1:02:59] to go and show how women can be greatly
[1:03:01] honored in the scripture by doing good
[1:03:04] works for the body right for the people
[1:03:06] of God and I know maybe that's a little
[1:03:09] bit strange but I just it's more
[1:03:11] noticeable it's some it seems like
[1:03:12] because women are many times more given
[1:03:14] to hospitality and and to act do the
[1:03:17] actual work and I know some of you some
[1:03:19] of y'all worked really hard this weekend
[1:03:22] and we want to do everything we can to
[1:03:24] make it easier for you in the coming
[1:03:25] years if we do this again when we do it
[1:03:28] again we want to we want to make it
[1:03:30] easier on you it's easy as we can but
[1:03:32] the fact that you worked hard there's a
[1:03:34] blessing in that
[1:03:35] because it's it's not because somebody
[1:03:37] told you to do it it's not because you
[1:03:40] had to drag yourself to do it it's
[1:03:41] because you wanted to
[1:03:43] it was a desire to do it
[1:03:45] and there was a woman that we don't even
[1:03:48] know her husband's name and we he was
[1:03:50] there but we don't even know much about
[1:03:52] him but she was the shunamite woman you
[1:03:54] remember the story
[1:03:55] the Bible says in Second Kings 4 8 that
[1:03:57] it fell on a day that Elisha passed to
[1:04:00] shoot him where was a great woman
[1:04:03] and what that means is she was a rich
[1:04:04] woman or a woman of substance
[1:04:07] and she constrained him to eat bread
[1:04:10] so she invited him to dinner
[1:04:13] she sees God's Prophet walking along the
[1:04:15] road
[1:04:16] and the Bible said she constrained him
[1:04:19] said you need something to eat
[1:04:21] like your mama does when you go back
[1:04:23] home
[1:04:24] you know how it is you go back home and
[1:04:26] mama's always got something on the stove
[1:04:28] at least my mama does that's how I got
[1:04:30] part of why I got to this size
[1:04:32] mama's always got some pie mama's always
[1:04:34] got some cake mama's always got
[1:04:36] something to eat
[1:04:37] right you know especially always got
[1:04:39] something for Joel to eat
[1:04:42] and so every time he passed by she
[1:04:45] constrained him come in and eat with us
[1:04:47] no I'm not going to take no for an
[1:04:49] answer we're going to fix you a meal
[1:04:51] see you don't realize it wasn't just the
[1:04:54] church that we had that was important
[1:04:56] but actually the meals that we have
[1:04:59] together is a very biblical thing to do
[1:05:01] in fact it's the way the early church
[1:05:04] operated
[1:05:07] it's a very biblical thing to do and I
[1:05:10] don't have time tonight to go through it
[1:05:11] all but I can show you where it was
[1:05:13] called their love feasts they always ate
[1:05:16] together when they had church now we
[1:05:18] can't do it every time we have church
[1:05:19] but we do when we can
[1:05:22] because there's something about that
[1:05:23] you're you're providing a service to the
[1:05:25] people of God and so it was as often as
[1:05:27] he passed by he turned him thither to
[1:05:29] eat bread
[1:05:30] and she said it to her husband behold
[1:05:32] now I perceive that this is a holy man
[1:05:35] of God which passeth by us continually
[1:05:37] let us make a little chamber I pray thee
[1:05:40] on the wall let us set for him there a
[1:05:43] bed now watch how detailed that she is
[1:05:45] in setting up a man would never think of
[1:05:48] all of these things
[1:05:50] woman she thinks of everything she said
[1:05:53] let's make him a bed at a table and a
[1:05:57] stool and a Candlestick so she said a
[1:06:00] political place with a desk in it so he
[1:06:03] can do his work
[1:06:04] and it's where he can study
[1:06:07] and it shall be when he cometh to us
[1:06:09] that he shall turn in thither
[1:06:11] and so you all know the story because of
[1:06:14] this association with a prophet that
[1:06:16] they actually received a child
[1:06:19] and then the child died
[1:06:21] and here's here you say why would God do
[1:06:24] that but God wasn't done with her yet
[1:06:26] because she was friends with the prophet
[1:06:28] and she provided him a place to stay
[1:06:30] because she asked him to eat with her
[1:06:33] when the time comes she needed a
[1:06:36] resurrection
[1:06:39] the little things don't matter they do
[1:06:41] matter
[1:06:43] because she put her shoulder to the
[1:06:45] wheel and helped the prophet of God
[1:06:48] all of a sudden oh I can think of
[1:06:51] something tonight I won't call any names
[1:06:52] but over my life I can think of many
[1:06:54] women that have helped me in my Ministry
[1:06:56] many many and women that have taken an
[1:06:58] interest and provided a place for us to
[1:07:00] stay and provided money for us when we
[1:07:02] didn't have anything people that took an
[1:07:04] interest men and women both that took an
[1:07:06] interest in our lives and there will be
[1:07:07] a blessing in that
[1:07:09] not just us but every one of you can
[1:07:11] think of those things
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:15] and so it's she they received a child
[1:07:18] and the resurrection of that child
[1:07:19] because she provided a place for a
[1:07:22] prophet to stay something for him to eat
[1:07:25] she asked him over to dinner I'm not
[1:07:27] trying to get asked over for dinner now
[1:07:29] if you want to do that
[1:07:31] it's up to you that's not the point of
[1:07:34] the message you did that this weekend
[1:07:37] huh
[1:07:39] see the Bible says some hundreds of
[1:07:41] years later Jesus said this he that
[1:07:43] receiveth the prophet in the name of a
[1:07:45] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[1:07:47] he that receiveth the righteous man in
[1:07:49] the name of a righteous man shall
[1:07:51] receive a righteous man's reward it
[1:07:53] questions and answers to ask brother
[1:07:54] random what is a prophet's reward
[1:07:56] and he said Jesus said whosoever
[1:07:58] receiveth the prophet yeah he said he
[1:08:00] receives the prophet's reward our
[1:08:01] prophet's reward is to be a friend with
[1:08:04] the prophet
[1:08:06] I love how simple a prophet was
[1:08:08] he said whosoever receives a righteous
[1:08:10] man in the name of a righteous man
[1:08:12] receives a righteous man's reward so
[1:08:14] it's not just limited to prophets he
[1:08:16] said if they want to know what a
[1:08:18] prophet's reward is is to be a friend to
[1:08:20] the prophet see that's a reward he's
[1:08:23] your friend
[1:08:24] you don't know when you might need the
[1:08:26] body of Christ
[1:08:28] you don't know when you might need their
[1:08:30] prayers you don't know when you might
[1:08:31] need to hear a good message you don't
[1:08:33] know when you might need somebody to
[1:08:35] step in and be there for you
[1:08:38] and so you become friendly with one
[1:08:40] another
[1:08:41] because you might need them sometimes
[1:08:43] might come in handy sometimes
[1:08:45] he said like the shunamak woman it might
[1:08:47] come in handy sometimes see it did with
[1:08:49] her he said Watch God's servants
[1:08:52] now
[1:08:54] in the New Testament he said well that's
[1:08:56] the Old Testament those were prophets
[1:08:57] look at the New Testament Acts chapter 9
[1:09:00] verse 36 is this okay tonight
[1:09:03] it's for women
[1:09:06] who made a difference
[1:09:09] not by stepping out of their role and
[1:09:11] stepping out into a role of trying to
[1:09:13] lead the church
[1:09:14] but by fulfilling what God called them
[1:09:17] to do
[1:09:18] and so they become friends to prophets
[1:09:21] or friends to people in the church in
[1:09:23] Acts 9 36 there was that Joppa a certain
[1:09:25] disciple named Tabitha which by
[1:09:28] interpretation is called Dorcas
[1:09:30] this woman was full of good works and
[1:09:32] alms Deeds which she did I love the way
[1:09:34] it puts it she was full
[1:09:37] of good works
[1:09:39] she was full of good works and alms
[1:09:43] Deeds which she did so things were acts
[1:09:45] of charity
[1:09:47] verse 37 it came to pass in those days
[1:09:49] that she was sick and died and when they
[1:09:52] had washed they later in an upper
[1:09:54] chamber
[1:09:55] now when they later in it up her chamber
[1:09:57] I want you to notice how different her
[1:09:59] funeral was from someone who's always
[1:10:01] fought
[1:10:03] someone who's always fussed
[1:10:06] someone who's always been cantankerous
[1:10:09] because many times they have a big
[1:10:10] funeral but people show up to make sure
[1:10:12] they're dead
[1:10:16] hahaha
[1:10:20] I mean there's some people like that
[1:10:22] it's just like you know what I'll be
[1:10:25] honest with you I don't want to standing
[1:10:26] by my grave brother Joe talking about
[1:10:28] well he did me wrong here and he did me
[1:10:31] wrong here and
[1:10:32] treated me badly here
[1:10:34] God help me
[1:10:36] especially if it's true you know if they
[1:10:37] want to make stuff up that's fine
[1:10:40] but if it was true and but notice how
[1:10:42] different this funeral was they later in
[1:10:45] an upper chamber
[1:10:46] and immediately they go looking for
[1:10:48] somebody to pray for
[1:10:50] she's already dead
[1:10:52] brother Danny but she was such an
[1:10:54] important part of the church
[1:10:57] that they said we don't want to make it
[1:10:59] without sister Tabitha
[1:11:01] isn't that the way you want to go
[1:11:04] we don't want to make it without sister
[1:11:06] Tabitha she here she's got sick and
[1:11:08] she's died and it wasn't her time and
[1:11:10] maybe she died at a younger age we don't
[1:11:12] want to make it without Tabitha and so
[1:11:15] what they did it says for as much as lit
[1:11:17] it was neither Joplin it was uh the one
[1:11:19] that gotten saved under Paul's Ministry
[1:11:21] uh seller of purple I believe and the
[1:11:23] disciples had heard that Peter was there
[1:11:25] they sent unto him two men Desiring him
[1:11:28] that he would not delay to come to them
[1:11:31] and then Peter arose and went with them
[1:11:34] so they've they've laid her up this
[1:11:36] whole time
[1:11:37] to let the man of God have an
[1:11:39] opportunity
[1:11:40] to come by and pay his respects or pray
[1:11:43] for her whatever it is maybe they didn't
[1:11:45] even didn't even hope to believe that
[1:11:47] she could be raised from the dead but
[1:11:49] they just didn't want to see sister
[1:11:50] Tabitha go that way
[1:11:52] they just didn't want to see her in to
[1:11:54] be like that oh that I could be such a
[1:11:57] child of God that people didn't want to
[1:12:00] see me go
[1:12:01] Paul could have such confidence in his
[1:12:04] own life and Ministry that he said for
[1:12:06] me to to die is gain
[1:12:09] and to live is Christ he said now to
[1:12:11] live is better for you
[1:12:14] think about that for a moment we want to
[1:12:16] be the kind of Christian that it's not
[1:12:18] like well we just got in on the skin of
[1:12:19] our teeth but for me to live in this
[1:12:21] world it's better for you
[1:12:26] well it makes you think don't it
[1:12:29] sometimes I think I'm worth more dead
[1:12:30] than alive I know I am financially
[1:12:33] because of Life Insurance
[1:12:36] but really
[1:12:38] it would us continue continuing with the
[1:12:41] church would it be better for the church
[1:12:44] I believe every one of you is better
[1:12:45] that you're alive
[1:12:47] right it's better that you're alive
[1:12:50] because you make the church better you
[1:12:52] showed that this weekend now watch
[1:12:54] for as much as litter was not a jopping
[1:12:57] they sent two men Peter Rose went with
[1:12:58] him when he was come they brought him to
[1:13:00] the upper chamber all the widows stood
[1:13:02] by him weeping and showing the coats and
[1:13:05] garments which Dorcas made when she was
[1:13:08] with them
[1:13:09] showing the things that she had given
[1:13:11] them
[1:13:16] thought of something but Joe remind me
[1:13:18] to tell you something later
[1:13:20] 40 but Peter put them all forth and
[1:13:24] kneeled down and prayed
[1:13:26] and turning him to the body said Tabitha
[1:13:29] arrives I love this
[1:13:32] they were in no condition to believe
[1:13:34] but they knew they wanted sister Tabitha
[1:13:37] to live
[1:13:38] and so he puts them all out and when he
[1:13:41] did he said Tabitha arise and she opened
[1:13:43] her eyes and when she saw Peter she set
[1:13:47] up
[1:13:48] I love it and he gave her his hand and
[1:13:51] lifted her up and when he called the
[1:13:52] Saints and widows presented her alive
[1:13:54] and it was thrown throughout all Joppa
[1:13:56] and many believed in the Lord why was
[1:13:58] she in that position her friends didn't
[1:14:00] want to let her just go that's why the
[1:14:03] man who got healed that was let down
[1:14:05] through the roof you remember he had
[1:14:07] four friends that thought so much of him
[1:14:09] that they said we're not going to let
[1:14:11] our friend lay here and not be healed
[1:14:13] because he can't get through the crowd
[1:14:14] we're going to let him we'll break the
[1:14:16] roof open and let him down oh that's the
[1:14:18] way we ought to be if I have a brother
[1:14:20] or a sister that's hurting let me make a
[1:14:22] hole in the roof if I have to and let
[1:14:24] him down so they get to Jesus
[1:14:30] Marion are you still with me tonight
[1:14:33] I'm not going as fast as I thought I
[1:14:35] would but it'll be just a minute longer
[1:14:37] I thought I'd be done in 30 minutes
[1:14:40] Mary and Lazarus and Martha were friends
[1:14:43] of Jesus
[1:14:44] the Bible says Jesus loved Martha and
[1:14:47] her sister in Lazarus
[1:14:49] he loved them now they met because they
[1:14:51] invited Jesus to dinner in fact Martha
[1:14:53] did
[1:14:54] you see the
[1:14:55] way this is going
[1:14:57] there's something about inviting Jesus
[1:14:59] to dinner that results in Resurrection
[1:15:03] of the Dead
[1:15:06] you say well I can't do that today you
[1:15:08] remember the old story The Man Who
[1:15:09] invited Jesus and he didn't show up and
[1:15:12] he didn't show up and he said Lord you
[1:15:13] said you would come but in the meantime
[1:15:15] there was a beggar and there was a
[1:15:17] little girl and there was another there
[1:15:18] was another man come by he fed all of
[1:15:20] them
[1:15:21] and he said I was the beggar I was the
[1:15:23] little girl brother Brandon tells that
[1:15:25] story
[1:15:26] why because it's in as much as you've
[1:15:28] done to the least of these my little
[1:15:30] ones you've done it unto me he said
[1:15:33] so here now Martha and met Jesus because
[1:15:36] our Mary met Jesus Lazarus met Jesus
[1:15:38] because Martha invited him to dinner
[1:15:41] came to pass they went he entered in a
[1:15:43] certain Village and a certain woman
[1:15:44] named Martha received him into her house
[1:15:46] she had her sister called Mary which
[1:15:49] also said that Jesus feet and heard the
[1:15:50] word
[1:15:51] but Martha was covered about much
[1:15:53] serving now you don't know the story
[1:15:55] she's busy washing pots and pans
[1:15:58] now we know that there's there's a time
[1:16:01] for both things right there's a time to
[1:16:04] hear the word and there's a time to be
[1:16:07] washing the pots and pans
[1:16:09] right and we have to be careful that's
[1:16:10] why we we're trying to do our best to
[1:16:12] think of ways to lessen the load on
[1:16:14] individuals because we don't want you to
[1:16:16] miss the spiritual aspect of the meeting
[1:16:19] we don't want you to miss the we don't
[1:16:20] want to get so busy in church that we
[1:16:22] forget that there's something going on
[1:16:25] Jesus is speaking
[1:16:27] but Martha was comfortable with my
[1:16:28] serving and came to him and said Lord
[1:16:29] that's not care that my sister has left
[1:16:31] me to serve alone bitter therefore that
[1:16:33] she helped me and Jesus answered and
[1:16:35] said to her Martha Martha Thou Art
[1:16:37] careful and troubled about many things
[1:16:39] but one thing is needful in other words
[1:16:41] he said if all this if we didn't get fed
[1:16:42] but we heard from Jesus that would be
[1:16:45] enough
[1:16:46] that's the one thing that we need
[1:16:48] but yet the good work of feeding Jesus
[1:16:51] didn't go unnoticed
[1:16:54] he said Mary had chosen the good part
[1:16:55] which shall not be taken away from her
[1:16:57] but Martha had her reward
[1:17:00] you remember it was Martha that when
[1:17:02] Jesus was coming when she heard him
[1:17:04] coming in John 11 20 she went and met
[1:17:06] him but Mary said still in the house
[1:17:09] and then sent Martha unto Jesus Lord if
[1:17:12] thou has been here my brother had not
[1:17:13] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[1:17:16] thou would ask of God God will give it
[1:17:17] to thee like had he writes she said the
[1:17:19] right thing
[1:17:21] why she was she was willing to give she
[1:17:24] was willing to invite Jesus in and all
[1:17:26] of this happened because she constrained
[1:17:28] Jesus
[1:17:29] to come eat dinner
[1:17:33] Matthew 10 42 he said whosoever shall
[1:17:35] give one to drink give to drink unto one
[1:17:37] of these little ones a cup of cold water
[1:17:39] only in the name of a disciple
[1:17:43] that's what I am today that's what you
[1:17:44] are
[1:17:45] apparently I say unto you he shall in no
[1:17:47] wise lose his reward
[1:17:50] that woman said I the woman that seen
[1:17:53] God in Elijah the shoot of my woman she
[1:17:54] said I think it's nice enough we do
[1:17:55] something for the servant of God God
[1:17:57] will respect it
[1:17:58] while she was just a few hundred years
[1:18:00] ahead of time Jesus said if you give one
[1:18:02] of my disciples a cup of cold water it's
[1:18:03] a judgment it won't be forgotten he said
[1:18:06] we failed to see the power that God has
[1:18:07] placed in his people God has been his
[1:18:09] people how many believe that today he
[1:18:11] said you believe that God was with his
[1:18:12] people one time when he walked on the
[1:18:13] Earth but now God is in his people a
[1:18:15] little while in the world sees me no
[1:18:17] more you'll see me for I will be with
[1:18:19] you and in you to the end of the world
[1:18:20] he said God dwells moves Works in
[1:18:22] mankind God don't work through orders he
[1:18:25] doesn't work through organizations he
[1:18:26] works through individuals God works in
[1:18:28] man God doesn't do the work today
[1:18:32] everybody's sitting around waiting for
[1:18:33] God to move and in the same quote I
[1:18:36] didn't bring it but brother Branham said
[1:18:38] that he said David duplessis said he
[1:18:40] said that there's this he said these
[1:18:42] Pentecostals are lazy he said they're
[1:18:44] sitting around waiting on God to do
[1:18:45] something he said and brother Brandon
[1:18:47] Falls set up he said God doesn't do the
[1:18:48] work today
[1:18:49] he energizes a projection Spirit into
[1:18:51] men to do so he said I am the vine the
[1:18:54] vine don't bear fruit you are the
[1:18:56] branches
[1:18:57] Look what Jesus says in Revelation 2
[1:18:59] when he begins to talk speak to the
[1:19:01] churches the church ages
[1:19:03] verse two he said I know that works
[1:19:06] the labor and thy patience
[1:19:09] he said the works don't matter but he
[1:19:11] said they did
[1:19:12] how thou can it's not bear them with
[1:19:14] your evil and now it's tried them would
[1:19:15] say they are Apostles and are not has
[1:19:17] found them Liars it's born as patients
[1:19:20] from a namesake that's labored and
[1:19:22] that's not fainted
[1:19:23] I was worried about that this weekend
[1:19:26] I'll be honest with you I got to a point
[1:19:28] Sunday afternoon I was I was done
[1:19:31] and I still had a couple of dinners I
[1:19:33] knew and some hosting to do and so I
[1:19:35] I've never done this before I went home
[1:19:37] and somehow everything survived without
[1:19:39] me
[1:19:42] about three o'clock Sunday afternoon I
[1:19:43] went home I drove off the side of the
[1:19:44] road going home
[1:19:46] I'm about wrecked my truck but it's just
[1:19:48] you know but it's worth it
[1:19:51] it's worth it all of you I know how
[1:19:52] tired you were for my name's sake you
[1:19:55] said you labored and he said I know
[1:19:57] I see it
[1:19:58] but you've not fainted
[1:20:01] brother Branham says this he said how
[1:20:02] beautifully the Savior praises and
[1:20:04] commends his children he takes full
[1:20:06] account of their fine spiritual attitude
[1:20:08] and behavior he knows that there is
[1:20:10] weakness among them but as yet he does
[1:20:12] not crowd against it isn't that just
[1:20:15] like the Lord he knows how to encourage
[1:20:17] Us in the right matters discourage Us in
[1:20:20] the wrong matters he said we could all
[1:20:22] learn a good lesson right here in
[1:20:23] running the church and our families let
[1:20:26] her steal we could all learn a good
[1:20:27] lesson in that God deals with each one
[1:20:30] of us in exactly this way he doesn't
[1:20:33] just come and beat you over the head
[1:20:34] with what you did wrong he says I see
[1:20:36] your Works your Works won't save you but
[1:20:39] I see your works
[1:20:41] are you with me now
[1:20:43] we could all learn a good lesson here
[1:20:46] he said don't ever be discouraged saying
[1:20:47] of God for God is not ungracious I'm
[1:20:50] closing if the musicians want to come he
[1:20:52] said God is not ungracious to forget
[1:20:54] your labor of love
[1:20:56] whatever we do even giving a cup of cold
[1:20:59] water to someone has a reward and a
[1:21:02] blessing from the Lord
[1:21:06] I think of a little story brother
[1:21:08] Branham told about the little girl and
[1:21:10] the King I've told it here recently
[1:21:12] the little girl wants to go out and
[1:21:14] honor the king a little school girl
[1:21:15] she's standing by the side of the parade
[1:21:17] route she got a little flag in her hand
[1:21:20] and the king is coming through there in
[1:21:22] Canada where they would the English king
[1:21:25] the British king would not come very
[1:21:26] often but under that constitutional
[1:21:29] monarchy they still honored the king and
[1:21:31] here he come and he was he was driving
[1:21:33] by him and she weighed but she was
[1:21:35] little
[1:21:36] she was lost in the crowd
[1:21:38] and she was crying afterwards and the
[1:21:40] and the people said her teacher said why
[1:21:42] why are you crying didn't she wave your
[1:21:44] flag said yes didn't you clap for the
[1:21:46] king yes
[1:21:47] but he didn't see me
[1:21:49] I said didn't you see him yes but he
[1:21:51] didn't see me
[1:21:53] but brother Branham tells us he always
[1:21:54] tells that story and he follows it up
[1:21:56] and he says but he said Christ sees
[1:21:58] every Sparrow
[1:22:01] do we really believe that today he said
[1:22:04] he sees every sparrow that falls to the
[1:22:06] ground he said he sees your good works
[1:22:09] he knows what you're going through he
[1:22:11] knows how it hurts he knows how tired
[1:22:13] you are but he sees what you do he sees
[1:22:15] that you do it anyway
[1:22:18] and he's going to reward you for every
[1:22:20] single
[1:22:21] one of them
[1:22:24] you know how much God appreciates you
[1:22:26] doing good things for his children
[1:22:29] he's going to give people eternal life
[1:22:33] because they stopped on the side of the
[1:22:34] road and changed the tire
[1:22:37] there's going to be people in heaven
[1:22:43] because they bought your dinner and they
[1:22:44] didn't even know you
[1:22:48] that's how much you cares about his
[1:22:49] children
[1:22:50] how much more brother Joe would he do to
[1:22:52] a child of God
[1:22:54] who did something for another child of
[1:22:56] God
[1:22:57] a Tabitha
[1:22:59] who made clothes
[1:23:00] for the people of God
[1:23:02] I assume to my woman who made a little
[1:23:05] room for the man of God
[1:23:07] people who work for the children of the
[1:23:09] people of God people who do things and
[1:23:11] and if I start calling names I'll be in
[1:23:13] trouble but Logan and his dad stood out
[1:23:15] there for hours out in the out in the
[1:23:17] sun cooking hamburgers the other day God
[1:23:19] sees that
[1:23:21] he sees that he sees the cleaning and he
[1:23:23] sees the he sees the people that were
[1:23:25] there he sees what you did I'm not
[1:23:26] trying to just make you feel good
[1:23:27] tonight but I want you to know you might
[1:23:29] be tired but God sees it let us continue
[1:23:33] let us provoke to love and good works
[1:23:36] let us continue to do what we're doing
[1:23:38] keep
[1:23:39] keep moving on because there's coming a
[1:23:41] day you'll be rewarded for what you did
[1:23:44] a day's coming I'm so glad for that
[1:23:47] I said but brother Ben I've made
[1:23:48] mistakes let us come boldly to the
[1:23:50] throne of grace
[1:23:52] not confessing our mistakes those are
[1:23:54] already confessed I trust they are
[1:23:56] tonight but confessing our confessing
[1:23:59] Our God confessing the blood confessing
[1:24:03] his cover of every sin and once we come
[1:24:06] that way let us provoke into love and
[1:24:09] good works let us consider one another
[1:24:12] I believe Paul's words are good don't
[1:24:14] you
[1:24:15] I believe they matter
[1:24:16] power hits together
[1:24:26] every one of you took time out of your
[1:24:28] day or your week
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:32] time to come to the house of God
[1:24:35] you did that tonight
[1:24:37] so I didn't get nothing out of it but
[1:24:38] you encouraged as a preacher
[1:24:45] we underestimate the power of a cup of
[1:24:47] cold water in a desert
[1:24:50] a place like Israel a cup of cold water
[1:24:51] is a big deal
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:54] a place like laodicea and encouraging
[1:24:56] words a big deal
[1:24:58] sweeping the floor is a big deal
[1:25:00] telling somebody you love them is a big
[1:25:02] deal
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:06] in a desert where people have lost their
[1:25:08] ability to love and care for one another
[1:25:11] when people have lost their ability to
[1:25:13] to reach out
[1:25:15] let's be different let us consider one
[1:25:18] another
[1:25:19] let us provoke to love and good works
[1:25:23] let us do better
[1:25:27] I know it's hard sometimes some of you
[1:25:28] guys work when you when you can't you
[1:25:31] give when you can't
[1:25:33] God sees that he knows that
[1:25:36] Jesus looked at the little widow woman
[1:25:38] and put her two mites in and he said
[1:25:41] he said he wouldn't stop her
[1:25:44] brother Brandon with how do you write
[1:25:46] when Hattie Wright came and he had
[1:25:49] twenty dollars in his pocket because he
[1:25:51] knew he said to take her all year to
[1:25:52] earn that
[1:25:53] did you hear that twenty dollars in his
[1:25:55] pocket to give back to her but the Lord
[1:25:57] said no
[1:25:58] don't do it what was he doing but while
[1:26:00] he was there
[1:26:01] because she was friendly and she she did
[1:26:04] something for the prophet of God for the
[1:26:05] church
[1:26:07] put it in the building fine while he was
[1:26:08] there
[1:26:10] God did something Supernatural and she
[1:26:13] become like a preview of The Rapture
[1:26:15] when she spoke the word and and her sons
[1:26:18] come back
[1:26:20] one day the bride will speak the word
[1:26:22] and we'll see our loved ones again
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] don't underestimate the power
[1:26:29] I'm doing something for the people of
[1:26:31] God
[1:26:32] means something church I want to thank
[1:26:34] you for that Heavenly Father
