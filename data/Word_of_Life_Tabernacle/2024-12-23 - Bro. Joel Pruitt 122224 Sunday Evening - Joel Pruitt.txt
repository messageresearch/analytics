building I pray you would just meet every need in Jesus name amen amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen some of you is happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight Lord amen and if you have your Bibles with you let's uh turn over to Romans chapter 9 Romans chapter 9 and verse 14 say Amen when you get it amen amen Romans chapter 9 and verse 14 what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I may show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth and Romans chapter 8 verse 28 very very familiar scripture here just read a few few verses Romans chapter 8 ver 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us and you may be seated may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word tonight if I could title this it would be his purpose his purpose I believe that every one of us tonight have a purpose how many believes that and I believe that if we're walking in his purpose then everything in our life Works according to his purpose and his plan and for our good it doesn't always feel good it does it isn't always things that we enjoy going through but everything that we go through every test you've been through every trial you've been through everything that's happened I don't care if it's a family problem I don't care what it is it may be a trial but whatever it is God has allowed you to go through that for his will and his purpose so many times we can look at a per at something going on in our life and we can say and I don't have my timer set but I'll look at the time just to see where we're at God God puts us through things and many times we'll we'll we'll look at it and say well I must not be in the will of God or many times we'll say why did this happen to me but if we'll only realize that if we love God and we believe on God then everything that we're going through is for his plan it is for his purpose and so we are part of his Symphony can you say amen and we're part of this great machine that God has placed here on Earth and he called it the body of Christ and it's a it's a machine that would it's a Well oiled machine and if you're a holy ghost filed believer and you're walking in the promises of God and you're walking in the will of God then you realize that God is using you for a purpose it is for his Divine Purpose in our lives and brother Brandon would say it like this he said you have to become part of the word to know God's Symphony his symphony is when it's playing you understand you're marching with the beat of the time you're watching for the works that I do shall you also greater than this shall you do these last days oh my the great changing of the time we get into the beat of the word can you say amen and we find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it and he says how does how he does that if you if you get into the word you find out how he did it at the beginning then you know how he's doing it all the time so if you look back you can look at any uh uh you can look at anything that God has done and you'll know that God always works the same way what can you say Amen so if you put you you'll find in Moses that he actually uh Moses was born for a purpose uh in the land that he was born in and he was born for a purpose in those people and he was raised a certain way for a purpose and it it looked like Moses was raised in a way that he would have everything he ever wanted it was look like that everything was going to go smooth for Moses but also part of God's purpose was when he was in the backside of the desert and he married a high-tempered wife that was also part of God's purpose and so all these things it look it looked like that God uh was was was working in Moses's favor when he was in the palace but God was also there on the backside of the desert so just because you're in the backside of the desert or just because it looks like you're going through a trial that is still working for your good that is still part of his purpose that is still part of the plan of God so everything you go through just because it feels bad doesn't mean it's for your bad just because it feels like you're going through the trial of your life doesn't mean that you're really in in a bad spot just because you're sitting here this afternoon and maybe you've got children that are not saved and just because you feel like your marriage isn't where you want it to be that doesn't mean you're out of the will of God many times God is allowing you go to go through that to fulfill his plan later in life just because maybe a minister would go through a hard time and and maybe he would get to maybe get called on God maybe he'd be a minister of of the gospel and and a god- calleded man but he can go through something because God knows what's coming down the road and he's got to prepare his servant for what's to come so God would get Moses ready for a great a great thing that was coming and so he had to get him out there on the back side of the desert and he had to actually get Moses in a place where he would not rely on his own abilities he would not rely on what he thought was right he would not rely on what he had learned under under pharaoh and and what he had learned in the land of Egypt but he had to get him alone so that he could hear what God had for his life he had to get him in a place where he could know that God was still in control of everything Moses had no control am mean he had no idea what he was doing but he when he went down there into Egypt remember he was a fully surrendered man to the word of God he was fully surrendered even though he was old in age and and he was well stricken in age brother BR would talk about he said he was an old man walked down there with a Crooked Stick and and a wife straddling the mule and he would go down in there it was nothing that he thought in his mind would be acceptable to take over Egypt but what it was he was in the plan of God and he was going according to God's purpose for his life so it it doesn't matter what we think about it he said you ain't got no thought coming amen if you think about something you think well this is what I need to do because God wants to work through me in this way just get yourself out of the way and let God use you and that will always work out according to his purpose what can you say man so brother Brandon would go on to say it like this he said we find his purpose the hour that we're living get into the rhythm of it and he said if you get into the word you'll find out that how he did at the beginning is how he was always going to do it all the time brother BR goes on down here and he talks about expressions and he says God is expressing himself and he said many times the S so n seems to be many times far away but when he begins to shine the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings and every life no matter where it's buried how deep how far in the waters or in the Sands or in the Rocks it'll rise to the glory of God why because God is expressing to us showing us just what he's doing his purpose is to show us through the flowers and through the Sun and through the trees and through all life that he is the resurrection and the life so when you look at a flower that is springing in the springtime that flower is for a purpose to show you that there is a resurrection when you look at a tree that is blooming with new life that is to show you there is a resurrection but when you see that the leaves are falling and things are starting to die you can see there is a death coming and there is there's got to be a burial but then at that time you can then see that there will be a resurrection all these things are for a purpose to show you that God really is and that God really does what he says he's going to do and so brother BR would go on down he said it like this God resurrects his life when it serves his purpose and if the flower serves its purpose and God has a resurrection for the flower how much more for our sister who serves her purpose in life and God has a resurrection for those that serves their purpose amen if you serve his purpose then God has a resurrection for you well can you say Amen tonight if you'll just come under submission to the word of God that is the will of God and then God will use you for his service and God will use you and raise you up for his purpose welcome the church say Amen tonight brother Brandon would go on down he says if you notice these flowers are not all the same color of flowers they different in color showing that God is a god of variety he likes different colors mixing it together making the bouquet that he loves God a god of variety he has his white flowers he has his red flowers he has all colors of flowers and putting them together he serves his purpose what can you say man he has big mountains and little Hills and plain and he has deserts and he has seas and he has the oak tree and the palm tree everything Blended together in its place where God the God of all nature can live and enjoy his being as living in his creatures in time that's serving his purpose so all these things are for his purpose if we ever realize that we're really pretty small in this economy of God but everything you do is is already seen of God and is already worked out for a purpose in God's mind God God knew that the acorn would fall and the reason he would allow it to fall into the ground and actually bring up another Oak so there's a purpose for that falling everything that we see around us in nature serves a purpose are you still with me tonight everything that we do serves a purpose purpose when a man stands in this Pulpit the purpose is not to be seen or heard but is to help the people it is to fulfill the word of God by preaching the word to the people when a man stands here it's not for self- Glory it is not so he can stand here and try to out preach somebody or look better than somebody but it's to stand here under the submission of the word of God and through foolishness of preaching Souls would be saved and so God wants somebody to get into his economy into his Symphony and do what the Great Master of the orchestra would say do and he wants somebody to play the part that he has called him to play in this great economy so if you're just a doormat in the house of God then we should be the happiest doormat we can be in the house of God Amen if you're just a if you're a singer in the house of God if you're a song leader a deacon whatever you are stay in your position and God will work that position for his glory and his good and so I I hope y'all are okay tonight I know this is simple but we need to recognize that in this day we are serving his purpose can you say amen and we're not serving our own ideas or our own purpose and and so you can say well I'm doing what's best for me and what's best for my family what's best for you and what's best for your family is to serve him and let him use you for his purpose can you say Amen so brother B would go on down and he says God never changes when God says anything that must forever remain if God I I if if uh if a man come to God and God healed that man on the basis of Faith he has got to do the next man the same way or he acted wrong when he healed the first man if he saved a man under the blood and that only if he saved a man under the blood and that only and will let somebody else get in just under education or being some Theologian or something without the shed blood applied to him then he acted wrong when he required blood for the first man see he must ever remain the same his purpose has always been the same his actions has always been the same can the church say amen and so when you see people today trying to change the program of God then you can say that that is not as it was at the beginning it was not so at the beginning but we are going back to the word because that is our absolute can you say amen amen our absolute is not a program our absolute is not something that that we've made up or our absolute is not even our pastor or or sometimes there's an absolute Authority that comes from a certain position but that is not our absolute today our absolute is the word of God and if we can submit ourselves to the word of God we are in his will and being used for for his purpose well can you say amen and so brother Brandon we go on down remember now we we've looked at nature God showing himself through nature his purpose for all these things in nature is to show us that he is it is to show us that God still works in nature brother brandom says that's what he would he read nature as his first Bible he he would look at nature and he would see he would see signs in nature he would see he would see how how a tree remember when the when he went and he talked to that uh that Infidel there when he was going to squirrel hunting and he talked talks to him about the tree and and how that how how the Apple about August here the leaves would start falling and the and and the apples would fall from the tree and he would actually sit there and prove according to Nature that God was real and so that even an Infidel had to see it and I say tonight if you can even look at nature you can see that God is still God and God doesn't change if you can look and when you're out hunting in the in the woods and things I don't do those things but you that do you can look out there and maybe you can just feel God all around you because the tree you're in God made it the deer you see God made it the the squirrels that are there God made it when you look up and you see the skies whatever is around you God made every bit of that and it serves a purpose even now all these hundreds of years later and thousands of years later God's purpose is still here today so brother B would go on and he also shows a purpose through his people and God would actually show a purpose through a man that would sit here and bring his children to the house of God and and actually uh come under the authority of the word and this day that is you are serving God's purpose for your generation you have come to the message of the hour you have not been lost in leosia but you have come under the purpose that God has chosen for you today and so God has ordained you for your purpose today and he is working that purpose for his good are you still with me tonight and so brother brand said God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be simple see now he always works in Simplicity but God in the beginning that that could say that he could have made the sun preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preach the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose and he never changes it welcome the church say amen he never changes his purpose and his way of doing things he never took men out of the pulpit and said we don't need men standing there anymore no he he said preach the word be instant in season and out of season he always had a man to stand in the pulpit and preach the word now listen if somebody else comes and tells you if an angel from heaven would come and tell you we don't need preachers in the Pulpit I say don't listen to that devil that is trying to lie to you on we have one Prophet messenger and he has come and told us that God never changes his program he's always working in Simplicity God in the beginning he could have made anything preach the gospel but he chose men to stand in this Pulpit brother Stuart if he chose a man then he's got to have a man that will be submitted to the word of God he has to have a man that is willing to take on that word and actually do it it is through the foolishness of preaching that our young people are going to be saved it is through the foolishness of preaching that your children are going to be saved it is through the foolishness of preaching listen what man calls foolish God calls great to because you can look and say well that that we don't need the preachers in the Pulpit no more look it don't make any sense for a man to stand In a Pulpit anymore but God is still using men in the Pulpit today so brother Brandon would say it like this he goes on he said he never changes it he never ordained denominations he he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was men welcome the church say amen amen so you can look and you can say well this just makes more sense if it is not with the program of God it is not for his purpose and God will not ordain that thing that is outside of his will or his purpose but if you are in the will of God then you are under the word that God has given you for this day so brother Randon would go on and he says like this he says or any Angelic being it was men and when he brought Deliverance to the people down there he sent a simple human being born of a simple family and a bunch of slaves now remember this is Moses he's talking about he said now oh my what a God he is unfolding himself in Simplicity now I bet nobody looked at that that basket going down the Nile there and thought there's the deliverer they didn't know yet what was to come but God was already there working for their good God was working for the good of the slaves and the slave pit in the mud pits of Egypt even when God was still in his little baby floating down the river well can you say am man tonight so God was working in in his will and his purpose the whole time so Moses is floating down the river and the crocodiles can't take him out even though he's in a bad situation God is protecting him for his purpose and so he gets down there and he learns and and he learns all the things that that you would think a man should know by carnal by carnal carnality we would think think that Moses is in a pretty good condition Moses is saved from being uh being killed and Moses is put over here and and he's got a great palace to live in and his own mother gets to raise him and she gets paid to do it these are all good things but remember God had put him in that condition so that he could deliver the people in the end see we don't always see the working of God we don't always see the will of God coming about but God has it in his mind the whole time and his purpose is being fulfilled before you even when you don't see it come on so when you see Moses there's a baby it don't look like God's purpose is being fulfilled where is our deliverer they're looking for a man or an army or they're looking for somebody that can come in and take over Egypt and God comes in humility in Simplicity but God is still working for his purpose can the church say Amen am brother bandam goes on down he says he is unfolding himself in Simplicity now notice he had him trained in worldly wisdom so that he could so that he could fail and show that it isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered by think about it tonight church he did that so that you would know that we can't overcome by wisdom he let him be trained all the way back then so that we would know that wisdom will never overcome our enemy and so he would go on down and say like this he says now notice he had him trained and he goes on and he says but it isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered by it's by faith that we are delivered he let him go in and get such an education until he could teach the Egyptians WID wisdom he was so smart God was with that simple family and who could perhaps may not write their name and Moses was took into the highest of schooling with such a great education until he could teach the wisdom to the teachers he could teach the Geniuses and he said yes and God let him get that way so he could display himself in humility and to show that wisdom has nothing to do with it can the church say amen and Moses miserably failed in his genius brother brandham said oh yeah oh yeah he let him get that way for his purpose that's right so he has a purpose the whole time he let him fail for his purpose so when you fail you say well God must not be in this what I'm doing that doesn't mean that God's not in it God is working for his good even when it doesn't feel like he's working for his good and His glory is always going to be brought about through the believer even when you don't feel like his glory is coming uh coming in the right way or maybe you feel like well I'm letting God down but if God is behind it just trust in God if God is for you who can be against you if God has raised you up for such a time as this no weapon formed against you can prosper the weapons will be formed but they cannot take you out why because of his purpose and his will and his divine plan nothing can stop you from the will of God in your life well can you say Amen it may not look like you're in his will but you've been in his will the whole time Brother David your past it it it does Define your future in the sense that God knew what you would go through so that he could see what you would become there are things today that you would never allow in your home because of what you went through in the past and maybe that served a purpose for your next Generation maybe there's things I went through as a young person that actually made me the way I am so that I would not allow things in the Next Generation you see it may have looked like hell on Earth at the time but God let me go through those things so that the Next Generation would not suffer what I went through well I'm is preaching to you tonight maybe you had to go through something and come a certain way to the place that you are so that God could use those things to perfect you into the person that you are today many times we look back and we say well if God would have just been there then or if God would have showed up at that time or if God would have changed this situation God was there all the time he never left you he never left you without his purpose in mind and God has raised you up for this time with his purpose in mind to fulfill the word in your Generation Well I wish the church would quit blaming God for your problems and start thanking him for what he's brought you through quit worrying quit quit blaming him but saying well look at my past look at my family history that does not define who you are now but his plan all the time will Define where you're going because God has always looked ahead in time and seen the future of man you can't see tomorrow you don't know what tomorrow holds but he knows the very end of this thing and he knows who's going to be there and who's not going to be there so thank him for the trials that you're going through thank him for the things that have happened in your life because it's all been for your good and for his plan and purpose can the church say Amen tonight amen he said he let him get that way for his purpose so Moses is going out of Egypt and he and he kills a man on the way out and and he goes into a desert it looks like all hope is gone for the Egyptians down there that are stuck in Egypt it looks like God's people are going to have to wait on another delivery well are you all right tonight I know you ate a lot this afternoon but let me just go ah a and preach to you for a minute God all the time in that whole situation knew that it was going to take 40 years for Moses to unlearn what he had learned in Egypt but he didn't do that on listen it was for his purpose the whole time because there had to be a certain time that Pharaoh was going to be hardened now the Bible says to him that he will he lets their heart their hearts be hardened and there had to come a ramies that would raised up that would be raised up and actually be sitting on the throne there had to see God knew the actual time that needed to be for all all things to be fulfilled he couldn't do it in another day or another age but he had to wait until the people were ready to line up with the word and when the people were ready the messenger would come and the people would fall right in line with the word well can you say amen and another quote I don't have it with me but brother bandam said God could never send his message until the people were ready to line up with it and so when Moses sent was sent down to Egypt listen the first time he was sent and he was just a he was just a rich kid sent down there and he was raised in the palace and and he was next in line to be Pharaoh but when God got done with him he was ready to be the deliverer to the people but God had to come as a baby now I want to bring this around to Christmas time God had to come as a baby before he could go to the temple and teach at 12 years old and he had to go in the temple and teach at 12 years old before he could go and and be in the synagogues as a 30-year old man and then he had to go through all those things to be led and and fulfill scripture all of his life until he would come to a time in life where he would actually go and do the will of his father and and then he would actually turn water into wine and the Miracles would start to happen and people would start to recognize him listen the elect would catch the message as it came in that day there was a virgin that was ready though listen a lot of times we realize we we see that that there was a baby in the manger but but but somebody had to have that baby somebody had to be ready for the word to be born inside of them somebody's got to be ready for the word to be born in them today well come on somebody the word that is born in you somebody has to be ready for it or the word came in vain sir if there's nobody to accept the word then why would the word even come Brother David when the word came to you it came at a time when you needed the word in your life amen God is not going to send the word to somebody and they turn it down if God has placed a seed in you then God has put that seed in you because he knows that there is something in there to respond and to grow what he has already ordained to grow and there's going to be Believers growing out of that family listen I do believe there's been people associated with this message because their kids were ordained to life I do believe that there may be there I I I've heard years ago that there was a brother in Canada and I forget his name now but he was in Canada and he had a he had a son that ended up becoming a preacher and I believe it was his grandkids that ended up really being a big help and and in the missions and things like that and and but God had brought a man who never quit smoking I believe was the story and I may have it wrong but there was a man that would he come to the message knew the message was associated with the message but could never lay down his habits why because he was actually looking that God was using that man for the next generation and the third generation after that God is always using who he needs to use or using the program that he has chosen to use to get his message out and to fulfill his will for the hour listen church I don't think any of us recognize the really the the the omnipotence of God he is in this room right now doing what he wants to do in your life he is fulfilling himself through you Brother David and brother Joe and and brother Isaac you look things and when life gets hard and life gets really tough on us sometimes and and and and the bills don't seem to want to get paid or or you know well come on somebody sometimes it's just just life right life happens but God already saw your life and already knows what tomorrow holds he already knows what the future is for you and he is working all things for your good so every trial for his uh for his glory it is for your good and every everything that you've went through that looks like it should have taken you out everything is working for you your good it's hard to say this is for my good In the Heat of the battle but it is for your good why because it's what the word said and just because there's an enemy that comes against you and causes a trial remember he goes right on and down right on down and says that no weapon form shall prosper so I think we just need to recognize that we are just writing in the plan of God and we are participating in in what God has for us we don't always understand the mind of God we don't always have to figure out what God wants for us but we are going to just do what God says and stay with his word and God will back up his word and he will not allow one enemy to take out one of his children he will not allow the he will not allow pharaoh to come down there and get his children why because just because it looks like you're at the Red Sea just because it looks like there's no hope coming just because it looks like that nothing's going to work for you God shows up with a pillar of fire God shows up with the word of God and God shows up and delivers his children Time After Time battle after battle come on somebody if you've ever been in a battle you know somebody delivered you from that battle if you've ever had a a problem in your life somebody had to bring you through that problem if you've ever been in a situation you did not see a way out of somebody brought you out of that situation it was God himself that did it and God will not change his way of doing things if God Did It for brother Stewart he can do it for brother Caleb and if he's done it for brother Harold he can do it for brother Ben if God has done it for one he'll do it for everyone in this building God is no resp Spectra of persons but every one of you are operating in his plan for his purpose can the church say amen amen and so he shows himself through nature he shows himself through prophets and and people that have always been listen everything that God needed was was always shown in his word he did not leave us without a witness he did not do something in this age that was peculiar to the word it was not something so different that he'd never done it before no God had brought prophets before so that we could see what was to come in this God had already fulfilled his word in times past and if he did it then he can do it now well can you say Amen we're not we're not walking blindly after a message but we can see it in the scriptures that there's already been prophets that have come and they've always come according to the word for their generation and when it was fulfilled the Believers could look back and say it was already written and now this day the scripture is fulfilled see it was God's purpose all the time it was God's plan all the time to be fulfilled at his certain time when the people were ready to catch that word that was to come so the people have got to be ready to catch it or it won't do them any good what can you say Amen so when you look at people and and and they're just not really walking in the message yet maybe it's not their time yet maybe they need to go through something to bring them to the message of the hour don't get discouraged when you see people that aren't lining up to the message of the hour because many times that's just because they they they they're following after the Flesh and they're not walking after the spirit many times they're walking after what grandma said or what Grandpa Paul said or or what my church thinks or or what I think or what my opinion is or what some Facebook preacher has posted but listen just because those things have got your mind distracted don't let those things take you from the purpose of God in your life and the purpose of God in your life is to line up with the message of the hour under the messenger that has come and not after somebody else listen church we have a purpose every one of us have a purpose but we are not to line up with something outside of our purpose don't walk after false gods don't walk after other things and if you do God is going to have to bring you back and you may have to go through things and things may have to hurt you and listen you you may go through battles that you didn't think you could come through but now if you're one of his and I believe you are tonight then I believe God's going to still bring you through listen we can go to Jonah and brother Brandon would say it like this and I don't have time to read the quote but brother Brandon would say Jonah was coming to Nineveh he said and actually he said it was actually working in God's perfect will the whole time because he said there was people that had to be shown listen um no Jonah was over here and he was supposed to go this go to Nineveh and and he would actually go uh he would actually go to Tarsus and and when he would get on his way there uh brother Brandon would say listen he said it looked like he was out of the will of God but God would use that for his Perfection and for his will and Jonah would actually be in the will of God and would overcome things listen if God had left him he had never come out of that ocean but God had a fish prepared before he ever made the wrong decision and before you ever made a wrong decision before you ever had a bad thought and before you ever walked out on God God was already there to bring you back God was already looking at you saying that's my child the devil can come after you the devil can put you through everything but the devil cannot have your life why because God already called you to be his son amen if a prophet of God can get out of the will of God and it still be used for his good then if you've been out of the will of God God can still use your bad for his good he can still use your weaknesses for his Purp perfect strength and just and in your weakness he said he'll he'll become strong and and so when you can actually look at yourself and say you know what I've been walking according to my mind and and my flesh and my battles and and it's all about me listen if you can lay that down and walk in the word again then you'll see the overcoming power of God in your life you'll see God moving again you'll you'll sit in a service and God will raise you up again to enjoy the house of God there'll be things happen why because you're not walking after the flesh but after the spirit in his purpose is that all right tonight I know I'm all over the place but BR would say it like this I do have this quote he wasn't out of the will of God he was doing just as God makes everything work together for good to them that love God that's right and we're called according to his purpose so everything Jonah loved God he just didn't feel he wanted to do what God Said to do sometimes we feel the same way about going to church let me get let me catch my breath for minute sometimes we don't feel like going to church even though we know it's the will of God to go to church man the church gets quiet when you say stuff like that it is the will of God to go to church that doesn't mean you're not saved when you don't go it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that you're it doesn't mean that you're not going to make it just because you missed a service but I'll say this you know God will use that for his good maybe sometimes you'll get you'll be at home on a on on a church service day or Wednesday night or whatever it is and maybe just maybe that's where you'll find conviction that you need but whatever it is God will use those things and the pastor saying good Lord I wish he'd preach and sto meddling but you know everything works together for your good come on how many love God here today almost everybody here loves God and that's a good thing we're about 95% in so the other 5% of you you all be the altar at the end of service because you need to love God but if you love God than all things think of your worst battle come on that thing will work together for your good all things well I mean you could just go into detail I mean I could go into detail about my life but you already know the worst thing that's ever happened in your life all things is that okay all things now brother Brandon would go on and I love how he deals with this and it's Christmas time so I tried to put this in here he said now we see here how that this little Bethlehem yet being unnoticed a little place not noticed too much of the outside world just the smallest of the Cities but nobody paid any attention to it but yet God had in his purpose that there's where all these things would happen oh yeah all up until this time God was working and preparing a place there was no room in the end because God had to be born in Simplicity God had to be born in humility and for him to do that it had to be he had to come to the lowest place in the city at a time when there would he couldn't come at a time when all the hotels were open he couldn't come when the holiday and express was offering free breakfast he had to come on well come on son listen I'm trying to wake somebody up wish somebody would wake up look at y'all you look like you're gonna be fun to preach to for a minute God everybody awake all right God come in humility do you know what that means anybody look at the way he was born look at the look at his birth God couldn't come as a king he couldn't come as an angel he couldn't come because everybody would have recognized him had he come and ascended descended down through the heavens had he descended in such a way that he split the the heavens wide open and he come down and he maybe he was riding on a big white horse and he come down and said hey it's me you know that would have been nice because then everybody would have believed but it would have been too easy for him there had to be something to hide it from the wise people of the day or the wisdom of men and actually be revealed to people who could really catch the Revelation somebody had to be looking for him to come in in a way of humility somebody had to be looking uh for God to come in that way listen and that the ones that were looking for it found it and so is it today when the word comes in a little church in Hardy Arkansas when there's bigger churches better programs can you say Amen bigger congregations and yet when the word's preached then God is actually here doing what he promised to do the whole time he never comes in the mainstream he never comes listen I'm not talking about big churches being wrong I I I bigger we are the better I'm PR growth everybody knows that and listen I I but but but but I think we ought to just go ahead and just say it like this we're never going to be the biggest group in the world come on we're never going to have the biggest congregations in the world there's going to be a lot of churches that are going to have have 10 times your numbers and that's okay because I'm not looking for the numbers I'm looking for an individual to become a Powerhouse and actually let the word be born in Simplicity again let the word be born in the heart of a man let the word be born in the heart of a housewife that will actually take her position and do what God has called you to do in this day God has not called you to be rulers of the world but he has called you to be Sons and Daughters of a living God he has not called you to be set up here and and be the president of the United States even because why politics is corrupt and if you put a good man in the white house then brother bandam said he'd come out corrupt just like the rest of them and so if we put one of our good young people in the white house I don't have a whole lot of Hope for them but I'll say tonight if they could just be a good Christian and let the word operate in their lives then that is God's purpose for them God's purpose is not to be a king God's purpose is not even to be the best preacher or the greatest preacher or have the biggest church or or have the listen have the nicest car whatever it is it doesn't matter those are all good things those are all fine things to have but God wants somebody who will humble themselves and recognize that this message is not living just in in Jeffersonville or not living just in Tucson or not living just in Hardy Arkansas but it is living in the in the individuals in the heart of the believer can you say Amen so God wants somebody to Humble themselves so that his purpose can be fulfilled in our lives he's taking these young sisters here and these young Brothers here to fulfill his purpose for the Next Generation listen if there's 20 years down the road you're going to look at these men and you're going to find out that the way they were raised is going to have an effect on the way that they're going to be you if you find out that if the parents never go to church the kids ain't never going to church and if you take the kids and you start letting them wear makeup at 8 years old or 10 years old you're going to find out that they're going to do it even worse when they're 18 years old and you're going to find out that if you let your if you have a backsliding home your kids are going to become backsliding what can you say amen and what we've got today is we've got people who have lowered their standards because of peer pressure and we've decided that we can walk after our own ways and we can still make it but what you failed to realize is God had a purpose in your life and God had a plan for your life and the perfect will of God for you is to be in the house of God and to bring your children to the house of God the perfect will of God is to do what his word has already said the the the perfect will of God is not to just say well I'm going to make it by the skin of my teeth or I'm going to well come on somebody God does not want you to just uh to just walk out here and say well God's got me no everything you do God had already had in his mind but he knows what decision you'll make and some decision will will will harm your family some decisions will cause scars in you that you'll live with for the rest of your life yes it's going to work for your good yes it's going you're an overcomer yes your children are going to make it but you need to go ahead and realize we might as well Walk In The Word of God and work according to his will now so that our children don't have to pay the price in the Next Generation well can you say amen and I believe there's going to be young sisters here that may be Preachers Wives or there's going to be young sisters here that may grow up and be a Deacon's wife or or maybe they'll just be a person on fire for God and and and and help with children Whatever It Is God has a purpose for their life that you may not know about but God wants us to act now a a in a way that would fulfill his purpose according to his word and you know you say well how do I know the purpose of God for my life the word of God is your blueprint it is your map it is what you need to walk in his will what is the will of God it is the word of God what can you say amen and if we'll follow the word of God we're in his perfect will and our children are going to turn out right why because the word already tells us if you raise them if you raise them in the fear and the admonition of the Lord if a child that is raised right they'll not flee from it they'll not depart from it now now I I'll say this they may they may struggle they may fight demons they may every devil in hell is trained on our young people today but God is not going to let one of them be lost if you'll just hold them in the presence of God if you'll just hold the banner over them and say you know what my house shall be saved me and my house he said thy and thy house shall be saved and if you'll believe for your house then not one of them will be lost I don't care what the circumstances around them are I don't care how bad it looks or how gloomy it gets I wanted to say like this tonight I'm just trying to preach to you a little bit encourage somebody to walk in the word of God again and if you get your house right and you start praying again and get your Bibles out on the table and and maybe turn your TV off for once in a while and go ahead and just start meditating with your kids and and maybe get in that prayer closet again and start recognizing that I need more time with God and I need more time in the house of God let these things become become common again to you and say you know what I I enjoy going to the house of God again I enjoy singing in church again I enjoy praising again I enjoy worship again what is it it is God fulfilling his purpose in your life when you line up to the word of God I know God's going to make it all work out right anyway but why do we have to be pulled from here and pulled to there why don't we just walk in his purpose why don't we just walk in his plan amen sister Stephanie God saw what you'd go through and he brought you back anyway but you know it's a whole lot of easier if you just submit yourself at a young age to the to the will of God it's a whole lot easier if you don't have to bear the scars of yesterday it's a whole lot easier if you don't have to be drugged to church what can you say man it's a whole lot easier if you don't have to be you know come to church with a bad attitude it's a whole lot easier if you just enjoy yourself in the house of God it's a whole lot easier if you say you know what I'm here I'm might as well Rejoice while I'm here I might as well worship while I'm here I might as well go ahead and have a good time why because church is not just to come in and and just be and and feel like you you you you have to be there no God wants you to be there and you love God and you gladly do the will of God why because it was his purpose for you to be here tonight and receive whatever it is that you're expecting to receive tonight if you came expecting something bad then buddy you might get it but if you came expecting something that's going to change your life if you came expecting something that's going to change your children if you came with expectations tonight then God and His Sovereign Grace is going to give you what you have need of here tonight it's not who's standing in the Pulpit it's not what they're saying it's a heart to receive what God is speaking to the people sometimes we'll we'll sit here and we'll say well I just wish I knew what to say to the people listen I'm I believe I believe in all these things that we need to get prepare and studying all this but sometimes I believe that God just needs to move a man out of the way and speak to the people because I think sometimes we get so tired so low down on ourselves and we start feeling so depressed and we start feeling like we ain't good enough no nobody's good enough but if you're here tonight God saw you and brought you here for his purpose God didn't put you here just to just to be a doom and gloom Christian and I feel like my time is about to run out maybe it did run out that's what happens when I don't have don't have a timer brother Ben said I could have some of his time from this morning and y'all are quiet now praise the Lord let's just work on right down to the end of it brother brandom said that was his purpose of dying that he could still project himself through his church and make every word through every Age act just exactly the way it's supposed to act that was his purpose now brother brandham goes on down he says now God passes the Nobles and gets the weakness God passes those who thinks there's something to take somebody that don't know nothing in order to work his purpose in their life that's what we get God said to Paul my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weak the more you can yield to me the better I can use you the more you can forget about your education the more you can forget about your denomination the more you can forget about your stuff and yield yourself to me the more I can use you because you become weak and he said I'll make my own purpose strong what can you say man I'm almost done don't get scared he said I'll make my own purpose strong God can make strength out of weakness is that all right he said that's the reason he always does it when he chose his disciples he said the humility of his own son when he was born in a manger in a manure Barn in the cow stall and was wrapped in swalling clothes see he could have come through a palace he could have come down the quarters of heaven and a full Angel salute but he chose to make Christ the example for us and he brought him in humility now as the musicians would go ahead and come I'm going to wrap this up he said he would come in humility now listen Church anytime you see a man that's boasting saying look at me look at what I've done look at the look at my program look at look at this no I want you just go ahead and notice something that God never came that way God wouldn't even use a prophet that would point to himself and say look at my Ministry look at the way I am look at look at what I've done no he would say it's not me it's him it's not me it's him that's speaking it's not him that's doing these things it's him listen Church it's not brother brandom doing those things it was him that's s him and so many times we're sitting there and we're saying well well I I'm following a man no we're not following a man we're we're following a God that the man pointed us to amen we're we're following a message that was that was ordained to come in an age that we're living in why to fulfill his purpose of a return of the hearts of the people all these things have had to come from some from the mind of God and be fulfilled in this time and so we are in fulfillment of scriptures today and we are acting according to his purpose can you say amen and so I don't want to look at I don't want to look at Brother David and say well brother David's not in the will of God no brother David's walking according to the way God is leading him and and and brother steuart and brother Allan these brothers God is is ordaining steps that they're going to take and God knows the very move they're going to make and the Very step they're going to take everything about it he knows before they ever take a step he knows the step he knows if it's going to if it's going to walk in into a battle or if he's walking in into a victory he knows this afternoon if there's one of you who have a need if you need something in your heart God already knows if you're going to submit yourself to the word tonight and and and go ahead and take a hold of the promises of God God knew who would and who wouldn't so his purpose was to become humil humility his purpose was to Blind the eyes of the wise and Pro but reveal it to us God's machine is still in operation God's symphony is still marching to the beat of the word we are in his purpose tonight how many believes that amen we're in his purpose Brother Bruce you're in God's purpose you're walking according to his purpose brother Danny you've been walking in this way a long time but you're still walking in his purpose amen every one of you here tonight there's a purpose for your life and when you're walking in line with the word of God God is working these things out for your good you may have to submit your ideas you may have to submit your own mind so that his purpose can be fulfilled wonder if we could stand together tonight I know this is simple and it's probably been some shotgun in a little bit but I want you to just know something tonight God is working in Simplicity and if I could say nothing else but this right here he would say what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us how many's ever felt the weapons of the devil formed against you and not one of them have prospered and not one of them ever will see we we don't often know the plan of God but we know we're in his plan we don't often know the mind of God but we're in his mind we don't often know a whole lot of things but we know who knows all things if you have a need tonight just if you bow your head where you are God knows what you have need of maybe that trial that you're in not maybe but that trial you're in tonight just know that it's working for your good and for his purpose if you want to with your hands I see several hands up in the building just go ahead and pray to them right where you're at I know it's Christmas time and sometimes you know we get so caught up in Christmas that we forget that God came in humility in such a humble way that we think it's got to be tinsel or glamour as a pastor taught this morning we sometimes even the message gets a little tinsel on it but I wonder if tonight we could just humble ourselves and say Lord I want to be in your will for your purpose in my life want to march in the symphony that God has placed me in faith faithfully and become part of the word to know God Symphony for me and find his purpose of the hour that we're living Heavenly Father you see every hand that's up you see every eye that's closed and Lord you see every need behind every heart Lord I pray you would take these cut up words tonight and go into somebody's life and somebody's heart and move upon them Lord we pray Lord for every need in this building work it for your good tonight every sickness may it be a testimony of your goodness every trial Lord may it be a testimony that there's still an overcoming people in the land and I pray tonight Lord in this church I pray that every one of us would rededicate our lives at this Christmas time to say Lord let your word be born in my heart let your word come to me in a humble way and a simple way and change me from the evil that I've allowed in my home let let me change the the way I act Lord in front of my children let me change the way Lord that that I talk Lord help me to become more like you and to fulfill your purpose in my life I pray Lord you'd move upon these people touch
