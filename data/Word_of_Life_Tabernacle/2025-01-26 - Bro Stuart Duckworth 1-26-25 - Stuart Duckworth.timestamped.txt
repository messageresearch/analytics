[38:40] the
[38:42] Divine Simon Peter a servant and Apostle
[38:45] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[38:48] obtained like Precious faith I like that
[38:52] with us through the righteousness of God
[38:54] and our Savior Jesus Christ
[38:57] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[39:00] through the knowledge of God and of
[39:02] Jesus our lord according as his divine
[39:06] power hath given us unto us all things
[39:09] that pertain unto life and godliness
[39:12] through the knowledge of him that hath
[39:13] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[39:17] are given unto us exceeding great and
[39:20] precious promises that by these ye might
[39:23] be partakers of the divine nature having
[39:26] escaped the Cor coruption that is in the
[39:28] world through lust amen you can be
[39:31] seated this
[39:37] morning he's talking here to partake of
[39:40] his divine
[39:42] power and his divine power has given us
[39:45] all
[39:46] things he says here to be made partakers
[39:49] of the divine nature and I just kind of
[39:53] something that I thought of of what are
[39:55] we inspired by are we inspired more of
[39:59] of of the things of this Earth of the
[40:01] things of this life or are we inspired
[40:04] more of the things above and I just
[40:06] trust by the end of this service we're
[40:08] more inspired by the things above
[40:12] amen but what you just think of what are
[40:16] we inspired by what or who is inspiring
[40:20] us to do the things that we do to say
[40:23] the things that we say what are our um
[40:26] motives and OB objectives what are our
[40:29] what are our desires what what is
[40:32] sitting on the control tower of your
[40:34] heart and for the Christian for the
[40:36] believer that should be the Holy Ghost
[40:40] That should be the one that's motivating
[40:42] you the one that you know uh when the
[40:45] humanity there's always going to be
[40:47] Humanity there but that that Holy Ghost
[40:49] has our Humanity in
[40:52] check and he's the one that's uh
[40:55] ultimately controlling us and inspiring
[40:57] us and and influence influencing Our
[41:01] Lives yes and is that how you want to
[41:03] live that is that how we want to be we
[41:05] want to be more uh controlled by the
[41:08] Heavenly than by the Earthly because the
[41:10] Earthly will will keep you down it will
[41:12] drag you down but the Heavenly amen the
[41:15] portion of the word that has been
[41:17] allotted to us that portion of Heaven
[41:20] has called us and it is should be
[41:22] drawing us up higher and drawing us from
[41:26] the things of this life
[41:29] so what is motivating us what is your
[41:31] and what is your attitudes what is your
[41:33] attitude towards him this morning what
[41:35] is your life testifying of Are We
[41:38] drawing from him or are we drawing from
[41:41] the Earthly are we drawing from him if
[41:42] we're drawing from him from him is it's
[41:45] life it's sustaining life it's victory
[41:48] it's overcoming power and from him if if
[41:51] we're drawing from him it's that
[41:53] sustaining
[41:55] life and brother R says here
[41:59] 1963 testimony he said there there's a
[42:02] spirit behind everything yeah and I I
[42:05] don't know if I'd ever even listened to
[42:07] this sermon I I've listened to a lot of
[42:08] them I feel like I listened to most of
[42:10] them but um this sermon was just such a
[42:13] a faith Builder but he says here the
[42:16] church was put here for a purpose there
[42:19] is a spirit behind this church where he
[42:22] was preaching at certainly there's a
[42:24] spirit behind your home behind every
[42:26] building behind everything there is a
[42:29] spirit a motive and objective and this
[42:32] church here uh comes here to greatly
[42:35] exalt some human system or something
[42:38] then its motives is not right but if
[42:40] it's put here to try to achieve
[42:42] something for the kingdom of God then
[42:44] the motive and objective both is right
[42:46] and the motives if the motives is
[42:49] directed that way isn't that what we
[42:52] want our motives to be this morning not
[42:54] to build up ourselves not to build up uh
[42:57] this church and what we can do not to
[42:59] build up our idea but to do something
[43:02] for the kingdom of God that's why we're
[43:04] here this morning that's why we serve
[43:07] God is to do something for Jesus do
[43:09] something that would bring him glory the
[43:11] only thing that you're that's going to
[43:13] matter over in in heaven over in glory
[43:17] on the other side of the Rapture is what
[43:19] you do for him not what you can do for
[43:21] yourself or build up but what you can do
[43:23] for him right those are the ET etal
[43:27] things and those are the things that
[43:29] that are going to last the people that
[43:31] you can influence the people that you
[43:33] can that you can help and and and we as
[43:36] the children of God Amen we should treat
[43:39] each other with respect we should treat
[43:41] each other as Sons and Daughters of God
[43:43] as the Sons and Daughters of God that we
[43:48] are we're here to
[43:50] help that's the purpose of the church is
[43:53] to help and to to carry on to be the
[43:56] body of Christ to be what he was when he
[44:00] walked the Earth we are brother and said
[44:02] we We Are The Reincarnation of him back
[44:05] on this Earth in in your life in my life
[44:08] from the greatest to the least by the
[44:11] Holy Ghost it's him back in
[44:15] you but I I just begin to think that you
[44:19] know what what has influenced me as as a
[44:21] man as a as a young child as a as a
[44:25] teenager um you know I grew up around
[44:27] the message I grew up hearing these
[44:29] things and and and what what drew me
[44:32] what what has inspired me why do I
[44:34] believe what I believe and and we know
[44:37] that that we are identified by this word
[44:40] with this word not just by just by
[44:43] somebody handing you a book or or you
[44:46] opening your Bible and and reading a
[44:48] scripture and something but but we are
[44:50] identified because we are the gene seed
[44:52] of God and because uh we are the word we
[44:56] were able to receive the word and so we
[44:58] are identified in that way but but by
[45:02] the way of of ministry and by the way of
[45:05] of of the seventh angel and and the
[45:07] Elijah Prophet we have been influenced
[45:10] and I believe this morning you should be
[45:11] inspired by the message of the hour you
[45:14] should be so inspired that you want to
[45:16] feed upon it that you want to listen
[45:18] that you want to listen to it that you
[45:20] want to hear it that you want to open
[45:21] your Bible that you want to receive
[45:24] inspiration amen from from the word of
[45:27] God yes and let that rule your life let
[45:31] that be what motivates you because
[45:33] brother renam said he said our motives
[45:36] and our objectives everything that we
[45:38] are our desire should be on Jesus
[45:42] Christ but I begin to think that you
[45:44] know what what is the n what is the
[45:46] nature or the spirit behind the message
[45:49] of the hour uh and I I believe it was
[45:52] not to build up a man or to build up a
[45:54] Ministry or there was something that we
[45:57] could make a relic out of and so
[45:59] something that we could just simply
[46:00] point back to but I believe it brought
[46:02] us something I believe it brought us
[46:04] something that would Inspire Our Lives
[46:06] amen for the for the rest of our lives
[46:09] that once we came in contact with it we
[46:11] could never be the same because it was
[46:13] something that changed us something that
[46:15] inspired us it was something from Heaven
[46:18] something that was a man-made come on
[46:22] right so I look the very Spirit of the
[46:25] message itself
[46:27] was to point us to Jesus Christ brother
[46:30] Bram never pointed us to himself but he
[46:33] always tried to point us to Jesus Christ
[46:36] never pointed us to his own ideas but he
[46:39] would try to take us back to the word
[46:41] back to the word point us back to that
[46:44] right to have the right kind of Faith so
[46:47] the spirit of the message itself to me
[46:50] was to glorify Christ to point us to him
[46:55] the spirit of the message is to point
[46:57] you to him and inspire you and draw you
[46:59] to God you begin to see the things that
[47:03] you know as a as a young person or as a
[47:05] young adult or whenever you receive the
[47:07] message or come in contact with it no
[47:10] doubt we' seen the picture of the pillar
[47:12] of fire and how the supernatural
[47:14] identified itself with this message with
[47:17] this ministry and that has inspired us
[47:20] that's something that we look to and
[47:22] it's something that's different than
[47:23] nobody else had that the the scientific
[47:26] that came the lens caught that and it
[47:28] took a picture of that and for after
[47:31] 2,000 years God identified himself back
[47:33] in that form again why because he was
[47:36] identifying himself he was inspiring a
[47:39] generation he was inspiring amen Sons
[47:42] and Daughters of God right good
[47:45] yes we seen the pillar of fire how it
[47:48] has identified
[47:49] itself we begin to look at the
[47:51] manifestation of the son of man and how
[47:54] that Ministry from the Scripture it had
[47:56] to come Jesus said whatsoever I the
[47:59] things that I do shall ye do also so
[48:02] that Ministry had to come Jesus spoke
[48:04] more of his second coming than he did
[48:06] his own death and mean he talked about
[48:08] the return of the son of man when that
[48:10] Ministry would come and that Ministry
[48:12] man when it when it was manifested there
[48:14] was nothing like it there'll never be
[48:17] nothing else like it why because it was
[48:19] sent to the church it had to come back
[48:21] to the Gentile church and inspire you
[48:24] and I amen something from the heavens
[48:26] something from the scriptures something
[48:28] Divine amen not something from the Earth
[48:31] but something Divine inspiring you and I
[48:34] that we could see God
[48:38] manifested that's what should Inspire us
[48:42] yes we we've seen the manifestation of
[48:45] the son of man we've seen the
[48:46] supernatural we've seen the the the
[48:49] we've heard about the things and we we
[48:51] we've heard testimonies of of the
[48:53] supernatural that was so identified in
[48:56] the Ministry of Elijah and the ministry
[48:59] of the seventh
[49:00] angel and me as a as a young young young
[49:04] man I you know you would hear it
[49:07] sounding so strange you'd hear squirrels
[49:09] were spoken to existence and this was
[49:11] spoken to existence and this cancer was
[49:14] spoke out of existence and I just
[49:16] couldn't understand that as a as a child
[49:18] squirrel why would God do that but God
[49:21] had to vindicate his word in this hour
[49:23] he had to inspire you and I amen and
[49:26] that that is what has inspired us amen
[49:28] such Supernatural such creating power
[49:31] amen amen and brother Brandon would
[49:34] identify that as a third pool Amen in
[49:36] that third pool a as as those things
[49:39] were being created it was
[49:41] identifications it was to let us know
[49:43] what was coming and he would say the
[49:45] third pole is the opening of the word
[49:47] the fullness of the third pole the
[49:50] fullness of that Ministry was to give us
[49:52] an open word something that would
[49:54] Inspire us something that would turn our
[49:56] Hearts back amen because it is these
[49:58] Mysteries these divinely revealed
[50:01] Mysteries he said that that will
[50:03] literally turn the hearts of the
[50:04] children back to the faith of the
[50:06] Pentecostal fathers not to not to build
[50:09] up a kingdom not to bring us to another
[50:11] denomination but to bring the power of
[50:13] God to bring the Divine Among Us amen
[50:16] something that would change your nature
[50:18] amen these precious great exceeding
[50:20] precious promises these things that were
[50:22] manifested to us amen that we might be
[50:25] made partakers of that divine nature
[50:28] amen that Supernatural wasn't just for
[50:30] brother brown but that Supernatural is
[50:32] for you this morning amen when he spoke
[50:34] those things amen it wasn't exclusive
[50:37] amen but whatsoever you say you say to
[50:40] this mountain be thou removed and be
[50:42] thou cast in the sea you can have
[50:44] whatsoever you ask
[50:46] for but you got to be inspired by
[50:49] something this morning amen those
[50:51] scriptures inspired the word is inspired
[50:53] but you yourself have got to be divinely
[50:56] inspired this
[51:01] morning that's what we've been inspired
[51:04] by the ministry of the seventh angel the
[51:07] sounding of that voice the ministry of
[51:10] Elijah literally turning our hearts back
[51:14] to be influenced
[51:18] amen and in that message testimony you
[51:21] should go listen to it brother
[51:24] randam he starts out he starts talking
[51:26] about the tapes and how they're
[51:28] recording the tapes he said I went back
[51:30] and listened
[51:31] myself amen yeah trying not to say Amen
[51:34] a bunch this morning I'll try come
[51:39] on but he
[51:41] himself went back to listen to that
[51:43] voice yes because there was an anointing
[51:46] speaking through him there was a voice
[51:50] Beyond his voice and you got to look
[51:53] behind Beyond the Veil of the man this
[51:55] morning to see the voice of God to hear
[51:58] the voice of God and if you can look
[52:01] beyond that you can receive inspiration
[52:03] this morning amen you can receive
[52:05] inspiration when you turn on turn on a
[52:08] tape and you begin to feed on the voice
[52:10] of God for your day you're not feeding
[52:13] on a man he said we're feeding on the
[52:15] unfailing body word of the son of man
[52:18] you can go listen to Christ the mystery
[52:20] of God revealed I guarantee you can go
[52:22] listen to it a hundred times and you'll
[52:24] hear something new amen every time you
[52:26] here there will be something fresh when
[52:28] you turn on the message if you come with
[52:30] an Earnest heart say God inspire me by
[52:33] the revealed word of this hour turn my
[52:36] heart let my heart be turned back in
[52:38] this hour to the faith of the
[52:40] Pentecostal fathers all right one I
[52:44] guarantee you there'll be something
[52:45] fresh yes that's good sir amen yes there
[52:51] will be something fresh for you this
[52:53] morning if you if you desire that
[52:56] there's something something fresh
[53:00] amen yes sir
[53:04] good so that's the nature I believe
[53:06] that's the nature of this message it was
[53:09] the power of the spoken word it was the
[53:10] opening of the word and these things
[53:12] have inspired us that's what we
[53:14] identified with this morning yeah in
[53:18] 1964 then Jesus came and called he says
[53:21] Identify yourself in your present State
[53:23] now where you're
[53:25] standing with some with some Bible
[53:27] character where would you have been
[53:29] where would you have lived in Noah's
[53:30] time where would you have been where
[53:32] would you have been in the days of the
[53:34] Lord Jesus when he was here on Earth in
[53:36] his flesh what group would you be
[53:38] identified tonight just think of it he
[53:41] said just look back in a Looking Glass
[53:43] we can see where whatever we what we are
[53:46] now that's what we'd have been back
[53:48] there that's what we'd have been back
[53:50] there because the spirit that's in us
[53:52] now identified back there that's the
[53:54] same spirit that was on them back there
[53:57] yes amen how would you be identified
[54:00] this morning amen would you would you
[54:02] would you be in the ark would you be
[54:05] there building the ark with Noah or
[54:07] would you be the one of them just
[54:08] laughing at him yeah and and the message
[54:11] the message was it's going to rain we've
[54:14] got to build an ark we've got to build a
[54:17] boat something that will carry us over
[54:19] and this boat was was something that was
[54:21] designed by God a certain way that would
[54:23] carry them through would you call that
[54:26] fanaticism would you call it crazy so
[54:29] you got to look back and see the spirit
[54:31] that you're under now and that will tell
[54:33] you
[54:35] then when Jesus begin to tell the
[54:37] disciples the
[54:39] truth he begin to brother R say he begin
[54:42] to let the hammer down to clean out the
[54:44] church he begin to let the hammer down
[54:47] and the 70 walked away and Jesus asks
[54:50] his disciples will you go also and Peter
[54:53] there said under the inspiration said
[54:55] Lord to whom would we go is that would
[54:58] that be your response in this hour is
[55:01] that your response when the word comes
[55:03] and it cuts and it cleans amen and it
[55:06] drives away and it cuts away the things
[55:08] from our life amen can you handle the
[55:10] truth in this hour because that's what
[55:12] the message does that's what the message
[55:14] it sets you apart in this hour if you
[55:16] can take the cleaning out of God Amen if
[55:19] you can stand there as a son and be
[55:21] perished amen it sets you apart in this
[55:25] hour good

[55:31] leave to not leave but say Lord you have
[55:34] the words of eternal life you have the
[55:36] words of
[55:37] inspiration we've been touched by this
[55:40] ministry we've been touched by the
[55:41] things you said it cuts me it hurts
[55:44] sometimes but we've been inspired Amen
[55:47] to stand and to stay with the truth

[56:25] want to we just want to stir up your
[56:26] mind this morning to uh awaken you Amen
[56:30] to these things just that word obtain
[56:33] means to be one's lot to cast lots to
[56:37] obtain by a lot to receive by Divine
[56:40] allotment obtain to cast lots determined
[56:44] by a
[56:45] lot so we look at casting a lot there
[56:47] and stay with me
[56:49] here in the Bible times many things were
[56:52] determined by casting a lot and and it
[56:55] would be like today or you know flipping
[56:57] a coin we're going to you know we're
[56:59] going to see uh who's going to buy a
[57:01] lunch so we'll flip a coin you know it
[57:04] would be kind of something like that or
[57:06] rolling the dice as it would be and
[57:10] so casting this lot and and in those
[57:13] times they would way I understand it
[57:15] they would take stones and just to maybe
[57:18] make it simple you would write a y on
[57:21] this Stone and n on this stone for yes
[57:23] and no and and maybe have another one
[57:25] with a why and a no on on each side and
[57:28] you would throw that and you would bring
[57:29] your question you would bring your
[57:31] desire or whatever uh answer you needed
[57:34] you would bring that and you would cast
[57:36] that lot and it would let you know what
[57:40] to
[57:41] do and so they would cast these stones
[57:43] and and Aaron would cast a lot on the
[57:45] day of atonement to determine which
[57:48] goats they use for
[57:49] sacrifice Joshua divided up the land by
[57:53] casting lots Nehemiah used lost to
[57:56] determine who carried the wood used to
[57:59] burn upon the altar at Jerusalem's
[58:02] Temple
[58:04] Jonah after he ran trying to get out of
[58:07] what God told him to do got on this ship
[58:11] going to going to tarus got on this ship
[58:14] trying to avoid the task but they're on
[58:16] that ship they ran into a storm and they
[58:19] was in jeery of of of losing the ship
[58:22] and those on the ship used lots to
[58:24] determine it was Jonah and his behavior
[58:27] that had put their lives at risk and the
[58:29] winds and the waves after the prophet
[58:31] was thrown into the sea that they
[58:33] finally turned
[58:36] calm
[58:38] Jesus Matthew
[58:40] 27-35 and they crucified him and parted
[58:42] his garments casting lots that it might
[58:45] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[58:47] prophet they parted my garments among
[58:49] them and upon my vesture they did cast
[58:52] lots so here in a in an evil away they
[58:57] gambled away Jesus's garments two young
[59:01] ladies had made him brother R said two
[59:03] young ladies had made him this garment
[59:05] it was without seam it was one piece
[59:09] they had made this this garment brother
[59:10] Ram said he he went he lived in this
[59:13] this garment he went to sleep in it and
[59:15] he died in it this Was His Garment and
[59:18] they fulfilled the scripture that it
[59:20] might be fulfilled and they gambled away
[59:22] they they cast
[59:24] lots and so they were inspired to do
[59:27] that I want to say this morning what are
[59:29] you inspired to do are you inspired to
[59:32] to lift up the word are you inspired to
[59:35] to to to turn away from the word I I
[59:38] want to be inspired to lift up the word
[59:43] amen when Judas had betrayed Jesus and
[59:47] faed they cast their loss this where I'm
[59:49] trying to get to they they cast their
[59:51] lost for replacement in Acts one before
[59:53] the Holy Ghost fell before the
[59:56] leadership of the Holy Ghost they cast
[59:58] lot and it fell upon maias and brother
[1:00:01] Brown said the church chose Mathias but
[1:00:04] God chose Paul and he says here in the
[1:00:07] sign of this time he said look even the
[1:00:09] apostles after they had tried to choose
[1:00:10] one because of Judas Fallen the cast
[1:00:13] lots and the fell my th and that was the
[1:00:15] best that they could do with the Keys of
[1:00:16] the Kingdom before the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:20] there is not a scripture wrote where
[1:00:21] mithas he says did anything he said but
[1:00:24] God chose Paul a little ill-tempered
[1:00:27] fellow but he had to throw him on his
[1:00:29] back one day let him look up a while and
[1:00:31] he said I'll show him the great things
[1:00:33] that he must suffer for me he said see
[1:00:35] the church chose Mias but God chose Paul
[1:00:39] and see that's the difference God always
[1:00:41] does the Choosing by his election his
[1:00:44] election God does that by his election
[1:00:46] and by his for knowledge amen amen it's
[1:00:50] God's election that does the right kind
[1:00:52] of choosing you and I we can make the
[1:00:54] wrong decision but God's decision is
[1:00:57] always the right decision it's not by
[1:01:00] man's choosing or by chance of casting
[1:01:02] lot the church would have never chose
[1:01:05] Paul they would have never chose him he
[1:01:06] was a murderer and and persecuting them
[1:01:10] but as that word obtained it says but
[1:01:12] but by Divine allotment by Divine
[1:01:15] allotment by by divine inspiration God
[1:01:17] knew the plan that he had for Paul he
[1:01:19] knew the election and the the destiny
[1:01:21] that he had for him and by Divine
[1:01:23] allotment and the counsil of God's own
[1:01:26] will he chose Paul to be his messenger
[1:01:29] by his own counsel by his own advice he
[1:01:32] didn't need to ask nobody about it but
[1:01:34] by his own advice by his own counsel he
[1:01:37] chose
[1:01:38] Paul amen chose Paul above the others
[1:01:43] Paul said I was like one born out of
[1:01:46] season he never knew Jesus in the flesh
[1:01:49] but he met that Pillar of Fire he chose
[1:01:51] Paul to be one of the Seven Stars in his
[1:01:53] right hand to reflect the light the
[1:01:56] power of Jesus Christ to reflect divine
[1:02:00] inspiration good
[1:02:02] Budd we look here Peter these scriptures
[1:02:05] here be Peter being one that cast a lot
[1:02:09] from
[1:02:10] meas no doubt in this epistle was
[1:02:13] somewhat he somewhat had Paul in his
[1:02:17] mind speaking of those you this morning
[1:02:21] that obtained by Divine allotment this
[1:02:23] precious Faith through the right ousness
[1:02:26] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:29] the the world may Overlook you the
[1:02:32] church May Overlook you they may have
[1:02:35] overlooked you the world may have
[1:02:36] overlooked you I may overlooked you but
[1:02:39] the Holy Ghost this morning the Holy
[1:02:41] Ghost knows who he is by God's election
[1:02:44] he has called you in this hour and just
[1:02:46] as Paul was was called to represent the
[1:02:49] light and every messenger that came was
[1:02:52] called to represent the light for that
[1:02:54] day but they passed that light on and we
[1:02:56] become light Bears they were light bears
[1:02:58] under that influence of that light and
[1:03:01] that that word that portion that came
[1:03:03] and we become amen we become inspired by
[1:03:06] that same portion and I want to say this
[1:03:08] morning Be Inspired this morning by what
[1:03:10] God's given you be inspired amen not by
[1:03:13] me screaming and shouting and yelling
[1:03:15] amen but get into the word get into
[1:03:17] Christ amen there's an anointing in this
[1:03:20] message there's an anointing a Rapture
[1:03:22] anointing that will lift you up from the
[1:03:24] Earthly and bring you to the Heavenly
[1:03:27] yes oh come on buddy it's good good
[1:03:31] preacher the Holy Ghost knows this
[1:03:34] morning who's
[1:03:36] his are you his this morning amen you
[1:03:39] identify
[1:03:40] yourself with him and he identifies
[1:03:43] himself with you he knows who are
[1:03:46] his we just s to look at Paul's
[1:03:48] experience of divine experience acts 9
[1:03:53] And1 and Saul yet breathing out
[1:03:55] threatening and Slaughter against the
[1:03:56] Disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[1:03:58] priest and desired of him letters to
[1:04:00] Damascus to the
[1:04:02] synagogues that if he found any of this
[1:04:05] way whether they be whether they're men
[1:04:07] or women he might bring them bound into
[1:04:09] Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came
[1:04:12] near to damasc and suddenly there shine
[1:04:15] round about him a light from heaven so
[1:04:19] here was Paul here was Paul though he
[1:04:22] was elected here was Paul running as
[1:04:24] hard as he could
[1:04:26] riding as fast as he could with these
[1:04:29] letters full of hatred but there he was
[1:04:32] struck down by a voice by a light from
[1:04:37] Heaven amen he was struck down to the
[1:04:39] Earth by this light at the sound of this
[1:04:41] voice screaming Saul Saul why
[1:04:44] persecutest thou me and so we look there
[1:04:47] that whatever you do to the elect of God
[1:04:51] that's the same as doing it to Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ Jesus wasn't walking in the face
[1:04:55] of the Earth but as the church was being
[1:04:57] persecuted they were persecuting Jesus
[1:05:00] and so whatsoever you do to the least
[1:05:02] amount Jesus said you've done it unto me
[1:05:04] and we should always watch how we treat
[1:05:07] one another always watch what we say in
[1:05:11] the church age book he said elect can't
[1:05:13] persecute elect elect doesn't persecute
[1:05:16] anyone right that's right but we look
[1:05:18] here Paul he didn't know he was elected
[1:05:22] he didn't know
[1:05:24] yet but he was about to find
[1:05:26] out you had that moment where you found
[1:05:29] out come on right you're running as hard
[1:05:33] as you can yeah you're running away from
[1:05:35] the things of God you're you got hatred
[1:05:37] in your heart towards this one and that
[1:05:39] one but something struck you down you
[1:05:41] came in contact with the light with a
[1:05:45] voice acts 9
[1:05:47] and5 he he said who art thou Lord and I
[1:05:50] said he and the Lord said I am Jesus
[1:05:52] whom thou persecutest it is hard for
[1:05:55] thee to kick against the Pricks and he
[1:05:56] trembling and astonished said Lord what
[1:05:58] wil thou have me do and the Lord said
[1:06:00] unto him arise and go into the City and
[1:06:03] as shall be told thee what thou must do
[1:06:06] yes so after this Divine calling and
[1:06:10] inspiration Paul's life was completely
[1:06:12] changed one minute he's riding as hard
[1:06:15] as he can one way in that direction and
[1:06:18] the next he's going to complete opposite
[1:06:21] instead of him looking to
[1:06:23] persecute and kill he became the one
[1:06:26] being persecuted and hunted but that's
[1:06:29] what happens when when you turn to God
[1:06:32] Amen we were running as as hard as we
[1:06:34] could the other way we were running
[1:06:35] towards hell we were driving 100 miles
[1:06:38] an hour towards hell we were going that
[1:06:41] direction nobody could talk us out of it
[1:06:44] but a lot shown in your path one day
[1:06:46] someone a Christian somebody somebody
[1:06:49] just came and spoke something to you and
[1:06:51] Shine the Light to you somebody said why
[1:06:54] don't you come to church and that little
[1:06:56] bit of hope that little bit of glimmer
[1:06:58] uh maybe maybe God does care about me to
[1:07:00] send somebody my way amen that's the lot
[1:07:03] of Jesus Christ shining amen through you
[1:07:06] and
[1:07:07] I is to give hope to a dying generation
[1:07:11] come
[1:07:12] on amen amen nobody ever talked to you
[1:07:16] nobody ever preached about you against
[1:07:20] you what what does God really think
[1:07:23] about you right
[1:07:26] if he's correcting me that means he
[1:07:28] loves me that's right right that's
[1:07:32] right so he was going one way and he
[1:07:35] turned around and going the
[1:07:37] next and we were running as hard as we
[1:07:40] could and when something changed in us
[1:07:43] we didn't we didn't try to go back that
[1:07:45] way we turned and we went the other way
[1:07:47] yes right right and when you start
[1:07:50] serving when you start serving God and
[1:07:53] begin to obey this revealed truth all
[1:07:56] hell gets upset brother R said all hell
[1:07:59] is against this truth all hell is
[1:08:01] against this teaching all hell is
[1:08:04] against the move of God in your life
[1:08:05] friends will forsake you family will
[1:08:07] forsake you but I want to say this
[1:08:09] morning if you're divinely inspired by
[1:08:12] something greater than yourself if
[1:08:14] you're divinely inspired by the power of
[1:08:17] God and by the nature of God there's
[1:08:19] nothing that can turn you back amen
[1:08:22] you'll either fight you'll either fight
[1:08:24] your way to hell this morning or you'll
[1:08:26] fight your way to heaven boys you can
[1:08:28] make up the decision you can you can
[1:08:30] figure out what you want to do young

[1:09:03] way or that
[1:09:06] way
[1:09:10] amen so it's and it's it's by this
[1:09:14] Divine
[1:09:15] allotment that God has called you and I
[1:09:19] obtain this precious
[1:09:20] Faith Divine allotment God not by chance
[1:09:25] not by Rolling of the dice not by this
[1:09:28] brother's choosing and this sister's
[1:09:30] choosing of of who's in and out but God
[1:09:32] divinely alloted God divinely chose you
[1:09:36] in this hour from his
[1:09:42] thinking you love the Lord this morning
[1:09:47] amen Lord I how long have I've been
[1:09:49] preaching only 10 minutes
[1:09:56] feels like an
[1:10:00] hour Revelations
[1:10:03] 181 this is what we've been influenced
[1:10:05] by revelations 18:1 and a strong Angel
[1:10:07] claim proclaiming with a loud
[1:10:11] voice come down from heaven proclaiming
[1:10:14] with the loud voice B said he had great
[1:10:16] power and the Earth was lightened with
[1:10:20] his glory this was the ministry of God
[1:10:23] upon the Earth it's the Cry of the holy
[1:10:26] spirit in this hour in this last days
[1:10:28] and that cry was come out of Babylon
[1:10:31] come out of the confusion of this world
[1:10:33] and his false systems and it goes on
[1:10:36] there how how the The Babylon this this
[1:10:39] system this world this world this chaos
[1:10:41] it had become the habitation of the
[1:10:43] devil of every foul and unclean Spirit
[1:10:46] the spirit of hatred the spirit of
[1:10:48] hatred for the revealed truth amen that
[1:10:51] would clean and purify their souls unto
[1:10:54] God and this is what I believe we we
[1:10:57] should we've been influenced by
[1:10:58] revelations 18:4 and I heard another
[1:11:01] voice just as Paul heard that voice
[1:11:03] we've heard another voice from the
[1:11:05] scripture saying come out of her my
[1:11:07] people that she be not partakers of her
[1:11:09] sin and that she receive not of her
[1:11:13] plagues amen that's the voice that
[1:11:15] called out in this hour that's the voice
[1:11:17] that has spoke forth in this hour a
[1:11:20] Ministry the voice of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] that come to the Earth Amen to to call
[1:11:24] out a Church to call out a people Amen
[1:11:27] to influence a people to inspire people
[1:11:30] to come out and brother R says here does
[1:11:34] God change his mind he says the church
[1:11:37] itself that the word church means called
[1:11:39] out come out those who have come out
[1:11:41] come out of her my people be ye separate
[1:11:43] sayith the Lord and I will receive you
[1:11:45] unto myself touch not the their unclean
[1:11:48] things the Church of God is called out
[1:11:50] of the world out of the chaos you're no
[1:11:52] more of the world and when God calls you
[1:11:55] out out when God calls you out he
[1:11:57] doesn't call you out so he can lose you
[1:11:59] he doesn't call you so you can go back
[1:12:01] and get all muddled up and get filthy
[1:12:03] again but when God calls you out he
[1:12:05] calls you out and he sanctifies you holy
[1:12:08] and he fills you holy yes right yes and
[1:12:11] me he brings us to himself good buddy he
[1:12:15] brings us out by this divine power and
[1:12:18] places into us this divine nature as
[1:12:21] Peter talked about amen and that nature
[1:12:23] will it changes your old nature it
[1:12:26] changes your old ways it changes your
[1:12:28] old filthy habits you had a nature to
[1:12:31] sin we were born with a nature to sin
[1:12:33] but when that new nature comes when that
[1:12:35] divine nature comes it's his nature and
[1:12:38] it kills out that old sin nature amen
[1:12:40] and it gives you the nature of God and
[1:12:42] when that nature of God comes in it
[1:12:44] begins to influence your spirit it
[1:12:46] begins to influence your flesh and you
[1:12:48] begin to alline up with the word of God
[1:12:50] and when you get out of the way when you
[1:12:52] get out of Step amen It's Quickly there
[1:12:54] to line you back out that's right we've
[1:12:58] got to stay yes under that inspiration
[1:13:01] that's right stay under that influence
[1:13:04] more than the other I hope this is all
[1:13:06] right this
[1:13:09] morning let's read you a quote here
[1:13:13] 1963 almighty God we thank thee tonight
[1:13:15] from the depths of our hearts for the
[1:13:17] love of Christ that's been shed abroad
[1:13:19] in our hearts in these last days by the
[1:13:22] Holy Spirit we thank thee because that
[1:13:24] we have the the privilege of assembling
[1:13:26] ourselves together and worshiping thee
[1:13:28] and having this Blessed assurance that
[1:13:30] someday you're coming for your church we
[1:13:33] thank thee to be the lightbearers of
[1:13:35] this age to be here ready to manifest
[1:13:37] the promised word for your age that
[1:13:39] we're living in knowing that in the
[1:13:41] beginning you allotted out your word
[1:13:44] knowing the end from the beginning each
[1:13:46] age you allotted your word to that age
[1:13:48] and he says somehow we don't know how it
[1:13:50] ever happened but in each age each of
[1:13:53] those ages as we look back upon th word
[1:13:56] and we see there was an anointing that
[1:13:58] come in that age that fulfilled that
[1:14:00] word and we can look here this morning
[1:14:03] we don't know how God's going to do it
[1:14:04] how's he going to Rapture his church how
[1:14:06] how's he go make make it all work out
[1:14:08] how's he going to line everything out
[1:14:10] and and manifest every promise but
[1:14:12] there's an anointing amen if you can
[1:14:14] look back if your faith can look back as
[1:14:16] the prophet said if we can look back
[1:14:18] every time that anointing came down to
[1:14:20] manifest that promise that alloted
[1:14:23] word that's good so we're depending upon
[1:14:26] that anointing the anointing of that of
[1:14:28] this age yes and the days that we're
[1:14:31] living in he says there's an allotted
[1:14:32] word I promis for this age and we
[1:14:33] believe that the holy spirit is here on
[1:14:36] the earth now trying to find Hearts to
[1:14:39] manifest and to bring it to pass by
[1:14:41] vindicating the word that's now
[1:14:43] prophesied for this day and this hour I
[1:14:46] say this morning the holy spirit is
[1:14:48] still calling he's still searching for
[1:14:51] hearts he's still looking for somebody
[1:14:53] that can he can anoint the devil's
[1:14:55] looking for somebody that he can anoint
[1:14:57] somebody that he can influence and if
[1:14:59] he's on the scene God is that much more
[1:15:02] on the scene this morning if you can if
[1:15:04] you can look into the world and see how
[1:15:06] influenced they are God is here
[1:15:09] searching out and trying to influence

[1:28:57] will produce a perfect faith brother B
[1:28:59] said look what you were look what loved
[1:29:02] you were how how low you were what done
[1:29:04] that that was perfect love that came
[1:29:06] your way and It produced a perfect faith
[1:29:08] in you to see what love done when you
[1:29:11] were unlovable love came by love was
[1:29:14] projected and it brought forth of faith
[1:29:16] when that love was projected it brought
[1:29:18] forth a faith a perfect faith in a
[1:29:20] perfect
[1:29:21] God and So Divine love produces Divine
[1:29:24] faith and divine love and joy in the
[1:29:27] Holy Ghost and it the Bible says it came
[1:29:29] with much
[1:29:31] Assurance Divine love
[1:29:35] 1956 and when Divine love has been
[1:29:38] projected I love this and it comes to
[1:29:40] his
[1:29:41] destination Sovereign Grace takes its
[1:29:43] place yes and now he said now can you
[1:29:46] think of that now ponder over it he says
[1:29:48] so we get it real close now when Divine
[1:29:50] love is projected and it comes to its
[1:29:53] Destiny then Sovereign Grace takes it
[1:29:55] over and brother Brandon would use St
[1:29:58] John 3:16 when God so loved the world
[1:30:00] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:30:03] whosoever should believe in him should
[1:30:05] not perish but have everlasting life we
[1:30:09] needed a savior we needed a redeemer and
[1:30:12] God's Divine love projected produced
[1:30:15] Jesus Christ amen Sovereign Grace came
[1:30:18] and It produced Jesus Christ to you and
[1:30:20] I amen God so loved the world that he
[1:30:23] projected that Divine love he projected
[1:30:26] that Sovereign Grace and It produced a
[1:30:28] savior It produced A Healer It produced
[1:30:30] a redeemer that whoo
[1:30:33] whosoever whosoever should believe in
[1:30:36] him should not perish but have
[1:30:39] everlasting life and so when Divine
[1:30:41] loves it it come when hey brother said
[1:30:44] when Divine love comes to its end get
[1:30:47] this now when it comes to its end
[1:30:50] Sovereign Grace takes over and his grace
[1:30:53] this morning it's unmerited favor that
[1:30:55] means you didn't do anything to deserve
[1:30:57] it that you couldn't work it up that you

[1:31:01] election amen when when when when love

[1:31:11] and it projected Sovereign Grace it came

[1:33:51] and when the end of the mystery when go
[1:33:53] when the mystery of God has been
[1:33:55] finished according to the scriptures and
[1:33:58] it was declared that time should be no
[1:34:01] longer yeah and the seventh seal he says
[1:34:05] we must remember that this seventh seal
[1:34:07] is the end of time it's of all things
[1:34:10] that's right these these things written
[1:34:11] in the seven seal book sealed up of the
[1:34:14] Plan of Redemption from before the

[1:40:55] looking back of what somebody else said
[1:40:57] about the opening of the word in the
[1:40:59] Seven Seals amen he he had to forget
[1:41:01] every bit of that he had to forget every
[1:41:03] bit of that and he sit in the room every
[1:41:05] night amen he had when that angel would
[1:41:08] come amen it would begin to show him
[1:41:10] what that meant and he was under that
[1:41:12] divine inspiration Amen to bring forth
[1:41:15] that word he had to empty himself and I
[1:41:17] say in this hour we've got to empty
[1:41:19] ourselves Amen to receive of the

[1:42:13] know it myself what time the father has
[1:42:16] put in his mind God Alone knows it the
[1:42:18] spirit and so Jesus said himself it
[1:42:21] wasn't even for me to know this because
[1:42:24] if if the devil knew the day and the
[1:42:26] hour he would get that thing all twisted
