grateful for that sister Allison with us this morning and her family doing better I know steuart struggled a little bit and and let's be praying for him and and each one that's had this Gabe still out with that and and I know God's A Healer we believe that and you know we live in a world where they've taken care of just about everything where you can take a pill for just about everything well this is something you can't just take a pill for and get over it it's it's there and but we have a God who still heals it and he heals any virus or anything that the devil can create he already knew what it was and or the devil perverts it but God is the Healer we're thankful for that today I wanted to tell you if I don't get a chance to tell you Merry Christmas and have a wonderful Christmas with your family we'll let you know about Wednesday night I'm not sure if we can get folks here to have church we'll have church and we'll do our best to do that but I'll let you know if something changes on that and uh we'll go from there let's bow our heads together and U let's just thank God for all that he's done for us I know that it's a a difficult time a difficult hour but we we have a god who's still on the throne and and and especially ask him for these needs as well Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come to you as a body of Believers today and Lord you said we're two or three are gathered together in your name that you would be in the midst of them and we believe that Lord and we trust your word that you said you would be here and you are here and so we thank you for all that you do for us every day and we ask you Lord to just come and and and fill this place with your presence today I pray Lord that Lord it would not be just limited to those that are here but those that are watching and those Lord even at home that are sick I pray God that you would just move where they're at today and may the spirit that we feel here go down where they're at and May there be a complete healing this morning Lord for each one father we know that you're still a Healer you're still God nothing has changed Lord with you and though this world changes and new sicknesses come and go Lord we know you're still the Healer we know you're the same yesterday today and forever so I ask you to come and heal each and everyone that is sick today and in need father for those that are quarantined maybe feeling alone this morning I pray you would help them God and I pray that you'd come down where they are and help them to to know that you're with them Lord we thank you for all that you've done for us thank you for this church and Lord for them enabling us to do what we've done here in the church and we're we're so thankful for that to have a a nice place so we can worship you and and and we thank you for your many blessings materially and physically Lord and especially what you do for us in our souls and we're so thankful that you're building your new creation within us thank you for that we ask these things in your precious name amen amen God bless you turn with me to acts 7:44 kind of a a little bit different sermon for a Christmas message but maybe you'll see how it goes after a little while Acts chapter 7 and verse 44 you bear with us many are are streaming this morning and we had a little hiccup with that and we've had to unplug everything plug everything back in and and so just bear with us if it's not exactly what it should be it will be before before very long it's just trial and error getting it back set back up Acts chapter 7 and verse 44 our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he hath appointed speaking unto Moses that he should that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles that Jesus is Josh UA into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how Beth the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands I sayeth the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayeth the Lord what is the place of my rest I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to to the word you may be seated this morning you can judge the kind of a house that a man will build on what kind of a man that he is or what kind of a family they are if you don't have much money you don't build much of a house unless you just have have the ability to borrow a lot of money but usually if you don't have much money you don't put in the the the solid marble and and the Walnut and all the the different exotic woods and maybe you build a small house would just just fit it'll be home for you but you build according to your ability you build according to who you are and so if we could think this morning what kind of a house would god build if he could build himself one and we know when when David wanted to build him a house he wanted to build him a house of Cedar he wanted to build him a house that was like house and he built his Palace that he built for himself and and Nathan the prophet said do all this in your heart and then he went home and he come back later that uh the next day and God had showed him a vision and he said tell him I took him from the Sheep coat and his hands have been blood he's been in war and all these things and he he won't build me a house but his son will build me a house but the almighty doesn't dwell in temples made with hands so here's a place that God would allow them to build a place place of service to him a place that he would bless with his presence but what kind of a house could contain omnipotence what kind of a temple would contain that and you know when we I began thinking about this when we did the repairs on the on the church here because as we begin to do these things we realize that we're not doing it for God God was happy with it does that make sense God was happy with it he would be happy in a brush Arbor he would be happy I've been in churches overseas where they didn't have nothing but just little plastic folding chairs no walls just a roof he's happy there he's happy with that God's happy with with those places he's happy with what we had we did this for us right we want to make it comfortable for God's people we want to make a place where we can be comfortable worshiping God but but God is not bound to walls and if he did build himself a house what kind of a house would that be it would be beyond our imagination you could think what would an omnipotent God do if you had an unlimited amount of money an unlimited amount of power an unlimited ability to speak things into existence what kind of a house would you live in the joke probably wouldn't look like yours or mine and you've been walking around maybe for a while and you've been building on your house or repairing things maybe over years and and me and brother Danny was talking about how that something if if you don't notice it maybe and then you notice that it's you say well I'll fix it one of these days and then as you live there it just keeps it remains broken it don't bother you and somebody else might come in a new owner might come in and and try to fix all that stuff but but it don't bother you it just stays that way because you don't have an unlimited amount of resources you don't have an unlimited amount of Manpower you don't have an unlimited ability to do that but God does God could have made himself any kind of house that he wanted to when he built himself a house he made it out of flesh and blood Hebrews 10:5 says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me he didn't build himself a place with gold and like the temple that that they had built for him he didn't build himself that kind of a place he built himself a house out of flesh and blood out of Bones out of DNA like yours and like mine he built himself a house we were in His image and he came in the image of man now brother Brandon put it this way in Oneness he said then came Jesus he said now we're coming somewhere he said then came Jesus the expressed image of God the woman's seed conceived by God himself he said the great architect built himself a body he built himself a body and he didn't build himself a body with superhuman strength right he didn't build himself a body with the ability like Superman to jump over buildings or with x-ray vision he built himself a body that got headaches he built himself a body that got tired he built himself a body that looked like everybody else in that part of the world he built himself a body that was just just like any other man but it was God the great architect built himself a body and he said he didn't have to borrow any Timber from anybody from the woman or the man so brother random is introducing us a concept that God didn't have to borrow the the the germ or the egg or anything from the woman or the man in order to build himself a body he didn't borrow anything because he's a Creator he is omnipotent right oh that ought to make us feel good about the situation we're in no matter what it is if you're sick today and if you're in need you know that God built himself a body if he built himself a body he can build you a new body he can he can create in you Wellness he can he can give you your health back he's omnipotent he can do whatever he wants and so he built himself a house he didn't borrow any of the materials he didn't go around and see if he could well I'll see if the Pharisees can give me some some material for my word body no he he he already had the word was already spoken he in the volume of the book it was already written of him he didn't he didn't borrow materials from the Pharisees he didn't borrow from from some other religion somewhere but he built himself a house and he said he said I think of Steven on that day when he stood and said you uncircumcised and hard and ears you stiff necks you always resist the Holy Ghost he said like your fathers did so do you what a what a sermon that would have been to listen to I would have loved to have listened to Steven's sermon that day but it made him mad he said uh Solomon built him my house but how be it the the most high don't live in houses made with hands but a body has s prepared a body has St prepared he said he didn't have to borrow any Timbers anywhere Hebrews the 11th chapter he said in the second or third verse says the world was framed by the word of God that things were made out of things that don't appear amen God just said let there be and there was he didn't have to go over and say Mr Moon would you loan me a little Timber Mr star would you let me have some calcium he said God don't do that he said but you see now why that man was more than just a teacher as people say he is today he said a a philosopher or a good man or a prophet he was Emmanuel and I want you to think about that because we know Jesus wasn't born on December 25th but he know we know he was born and he was born Emmanuel right Emmanuel and it he he was the son of God which is Jehovah God made manifest in his attributes of displaying himself in a body that he built himself he built it didn't get any help from Joseph didn't get any help from Mary she just had to say be it unto me according to your word and God built himself a body and I want us this to encourage us because God is building himself a bride he built it himself he he don't need any help from me you don't need any help from you you don't need any help from the neighbor right You' never seen a preacher put back on his coat have you he never built himself a body made out of uh made out of great big Cathedrals right he he didn't go out and borrow some from the denominations and build himself a bride he build it himself and no amount of of legalistic teaching no amount of of me beating you over the head with something no amount of of of of effort that we could put forth could build a body for God God has to do that but when he does it he does it right amen amen and so brother b as it reflected he said the sinful nature of man could not do the thing that he did see he said so it had to be God making and reflecting himself in the man making a mirror that we might see that perfect man which is Christ he said there uh which is Christ Isaiah 7:14 says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that's all the materials God needed to build him a house is his word think about that for a moment how did he make the Sun the Stars the moon all the things that are here how did he make the first atom at M atom how did he make the first molecule how did he do that he did that by his word right it had to be his word and if he did that by his word then we know that it does he doesn't have to borrow anything from anybody and this is sufficient the word is sufficient to build his body Matthew 1:20 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream this is Joseph he was thinking about putting away Mary and said the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take un thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done he says that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us God With Us when was he God With Us when he was born right he had to be and why would he be because he was godb built he was built by God and God inhabited him he he was Emmanuel God With Us John 1:1 in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the word word the logos and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made so he is the word is the creator who built himself a house does that make sense the word is the creator who built himself a house now he says all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made and then if you go to down to verse 14 he says the word was flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now look the word was made flesh what word was it brother B says Jesus was the word he said John was the prophet Jesus came to him in the water because the word always comes to the prophet without failing the word comes to it when did when did he become the word when he was born Behold a virgin shall shall conceive that he was the word the word was conceived in Mary right he was the word when he was born he didn't become the word later the word came to the prophet in the water and then the spirit settled down on him like a dove now look brother B says when the Virgin birth came on that was a paradox you know a paradox is something that's unexplainable right and some people don't like the unexplainable right I don't particularly like the unexplainable we started hanging these things yesterday or the day before whenever we started brother Danny and those instructions were pretty unexplainable you just kind of had to figure it out and and you think it would be simple but it's not nothing simple it's unexplainable but you know there's things we don't understand and there's things we'll never understand and God makes it that way there's things the Virgin Birth come on that was a paradox how that God in order to make himself known to man became man that God the great spirit he said God to me was before there wasn't even a light there wasn't a meteor there wasn't an atom there wasn't a molecule there wasn't anything and everything was God he said yes that's how great he is he is from eternity through eternity always was God he always will be God and how the greatest of all life listen the greatest of all life become a little small germ in the womb of a woman and we think about that and we think well you know for me to do that that's beneath me to do that to do something maybe something menial something little for God but God who was so great that he was everything he was all there was right became a germ Amen in the womb of a woman in order to take his own law to pay the penalty of his of his law death how God was manifested in the flesh how the great God Of Heaven changed his strain come from being God to be man through the Virgin birth he said nobody can figure it out he said science today can can't tell you how that virgin birth was but God did it he came amen so don't let people tell you well I can prove to you there won't be a bride I can prove to you we're going down I can prove to you nothing's going to happen but I can prove to you there won't be a Rapture don't let anybody tell you that because they can't explain to you how no got in a boat and survived a flood over the whole earth they can't explain that much as they' like to try they can't explain to you how the children of Israel walk through the Red Sea on dry ground didn't even get their shoes wet they can't explain to you how a virgin conceived if they can't explain that to you how will they explain the bride to you today how would they explain you can't explain your own life I can't explain my own life just by the grace and mercy of God that's the only reason why we're here I can't tell you whether it was because of this and a certain the way I was raised I can look back and try to figure it out and it still don't make sense I don't really know why I'm here today you don't really know why you're here today but there's something inside of you that that's created something in you a life for you something that you don't want to sin anymore you don't want to do those things that you used to do why there's a new desire there's a new creation there's God built himself a house amen God built himself a house and so if you look back and you try to explain it you'll never figure it out but just trust that God knows what he's doing he says science today can't tell you how that virgin birth was but God did it he came no one was able everyone was sexually born like he said the one man the same as the rest of them no one could help the other one we was all in trouble and then God himself came down was born amen we were all in trouble I was in trouble I had ideas for my life but they were trouble I wanted to do certain things but they were trouble you you had certain things you wanted to do but it was trouble you were in trouble but God came himself down and was born not of a Jew not of a gentile but his blood was God he said blood comes from the male sex in this case it was God God the Creator created the blood cell in the womb of Mary and built himself a tabernacle that himself come down and lived in it and we're going to try to keep God within the four walls of a church you think about it you can't keep him in walls people try to say well I'm the only one that preaches the truth you got to come and hear me or you're going to be lost God built himself a house God will have a bride without spot or wrinkle he will present it to himself a glorious church right he does that himself that that's not up to me or you he does that himself we sure we work and we put forth effort and all these things but we do that because of what he did because he building himself in us God he said was in Christ reconciling the world to himself the very very word Christ means anointed one oh he was God God and His fullness dwelt in him and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily he said that was a paradox that was a paradox what that means is you can't explain it on a chart right that's what the word paradox means now look he says it staggered people in them day he said you being a man make yourself God it still does it he said but just the same it's still the same Paradox is carried on he was God he is still God he always will be God yes sir he is the same yesterday today and forever brother Brandon says that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it and just just I'm working through this in the Paradox so we can get somewhere this morning but I think it's so important for us to understand especially at Christmas time he said that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it just like the new birth is today the new birth is a mystery to the people they can't understand it they don't know what you mean and listen to what he says he said they have belittled it bring it down saying well just because you believe something and it's important to believe believing is the first step but what you believe comes out in what you do right and what God does in you right and so every time Abraham believed it was counted him for righteousness God honored that belief right Abraham takes a his son up to the altar drags him up there puts him on there and God honored that provided the lamb right Abraham believes God and and stays faithful for 25 years God give him Isaac right and so every time Abraham believed God and was counted him for righteousness but then God saw to it that that whatever Abraham believed actually took place right now what you believe has to take place and I don't mean it takes place automatically or the way people think it does but it happens you say I believe God I believe I've been saved I believe I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and something changes in your life right it has to he said Devils believe the same thing and tremble it isn't what you believe it's what God has actually done right now we we fixed that we painted the walls we put new chairs in we put new carpet in but look I could tell you we're going to do it and I did for several months but until you actually see it you know it's one thing to believe it it's one thing for me to believe that we were going to do it but until it's actually done there's no proof of it right and so the the fruit of my belief that we were going to be able to do it is that we did it right and that's what that's what see that's what God does when you believe then the fruit of that comes out in the New Birth he said it's what God has actually done the new birth is a birth he said it it was new it was a paradox when God brought new life to the human race he said to reject it is eternal separation to receive it is eternal life to receive it but the the problem is people get in their mind well if I could understand it I would receive it you'll never understand a virgin birth and you'll never understand the new birth you have to receive the new birth it's a birth it's something you don't don't understand it you you believe it and you receive it he said you're on the same basis as Adam and Eve was he said if God put you on anything else it would be unjust to Adam and Eve He said Each Adam and Eve tonight has got right and wrong setting before them you can make your choice you can take God's word or leave God's word you can take God's word or take your denominational Creeds about it he said you can take your modernistic ideas of what it is you can be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost or you can be church ised I love the way he put that you can be church ised either one you want to be I want to be filled with the Holy Spirit don't you see the thing is people can be church ised and raised their hands people can be churched and run the aisles CU that's just what the church does right people can be Church eyes and read the books and listen to the Tes they can be churched and do that but there's something about a born- again believer they want to do that they're not doing that because somebody else does it they're doing it because there's something inside of them you can be Church IED and sit on a Pew for years but one day it'll show the fruit of what you are but you have to be born again of the spirit and if you're born again of the Holy Spirit there is nothing that can remove you from that state in Christ nothing you might fail you might have problems but there is nothing that can take you away from that you can take God's word or you can be Church eyes you can be filled with the Holy Ghost you can be Church eyes either one you want to be Lord help me to be filled with the Holy Ghost today you can come to the world of Life Tabernacle and be like the Word of Life Tabernacle and associate with Word of Life Tabernacle people and just just be like the rest of us or you can be filled with the Holy Ghost that's that's up to us we have to say you say why R it up to me if he does it well we have to say be it unto me according to your word Lord build your house in me is that what we want Lord build your house we may have an idea what the house should be like but Lord build your house in my heart build your house don't let me just take it the way I want it the way I want to see it but Lord build your house in me amen for me he said to live is Christ Hallelujah he said I believe that the same God that fell upon on the day of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divided himself with clothing tongues among his people he said it's here tonight it's the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost he said I know it's a paradox it cannot be explained he said emotions screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained you say I thought brother Brandon was against that he wasn't against that he was against those that didn't have it and did it right he said don't don't live jump any higher than you can live but he wasn't against jumping right so don't jump any higher than you can live but he said people don't explain emotion screaming crying cannot be explained but it's a paradox how God does it right and I don't know how you felt when you were born again maybe you didn't feel anything it's possible maybe you didn't have a great experience maybe it was just a moment of your life that things all of a sudden something settled in your heart maybe you were sitting in a church service I was in a room by myself myself a a at home at at night praying and and it's just at that moment that something come over me and and I felt different but then I got went out the next day and fought the same battles some people jump some people run some people speak in tongues it's a paradox how God does it and you can bring two people down to the Altar and one of them really get it one don't they both speak with tongues they both shout they both run the aisles one of them go for it how to Chang man and the other one remain a sinner and brother random talked about that how that Satan swed tears and and God seed wheat and and it all grew up in the same field and you don't know what it is until it grows up right but it's a paradox how God does it but he still does it that's the great thing Brother Sam he still does it he can still do it for you today if you've been Church ass he can still change you he can still change me whatever it is he can still do that amen amen as long as we can say be done to me according to your word now he said it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen so God creating this omnipotent think about it building himself a house look and why it had to be Shepherds brother B said he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle so where do you think he wants to live today we can make this place nice you can make your home nice he wants to live in Flesh and Bones he wants to live in Flesh and Bones he wants to be born in the manger of your heart he built himself a house to live in it he said Tabernacle he could lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel again Emmanuel God With Us Emmanuel in a Manger God With Us God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that amen he says you know what God is when you see Christ you know what God is when you see Christ amen now let's go to 1 Corinthians 12:27 and then look at 2 Corinthians 5:17 1 Corinthians 12:27 says now ye are the body of Christ now who's going to build that body right who's going to build that body now we know how what God uses to build the body uses the five-fold ministry because he said he did right Ephesians 4:11 he said for the edification that word is the building up of the body that's what God does and that's why I believe that you know when you when you begin to have a a Doctrine and you begin to get so closed off that you're the only one that preaches it right you've got a problem because there's got to be at least five of you if you're the only one left in the world and some have gone to the extreme of saying well there's no preachers left at all nobody left at all well then you're saying that God he started building and the crew you got didn't work so he had to get rid of them just do it himself that's not what God does God does the building through human beings and God knew exactly who would be false and who would be true and who would remain true and everything about it God knew he knew everything about it he didn't have to ask anything about it God knew exactly what my Ministry would look like what every other Ministry would look like from the beginning and if he's able to bring me here with the truth he's able to bring others with the truth is that right he's able to do what he wants to do now I'm going to take it back off L my voice and I thought that would help but it didn't now he says you are the body of Christ and members in particular each one of you is a member of the body of Christ and and that doesn't change if you don't go to church right if you're born again you're a member of the of the body of Christ what you are is a non-working member if you don't fellowship with other believers right if you're really born again now that that's between you and God whether you be born again not want to fellowship with Believers but if you don't fellowship with Believers I'm not talking about those that are sick and out this morning I'm talking about people who just W go to church at all now why why would people not go to church because you if you're a part of the body of Christ you're a part of the other members of the body of Christ you fit in right somewhere you fit in that doesn't mean you'll get along with everybody because the part of you that that fits in is not this flesh and this mind the part of you that fits in is the part that's ordained of God right God ordained something in your life that would fit in but he didn't necessarily ordain all your quirks he said well when I find a church that goes along with all my little things that I all my little idiosyncrasies I want the music a certain way and the people to be a certain way and them to treat me a certain way God don't do that he builds himself a house the way he wants it and you'll fit in if you'll say be it unto me according to your word right that's true it God Will Make A place there's a place for you there's a a particular place for you now he says you are the body of Christ and members in particular 2 Corinthians 5:17 he said therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature the word's creation If any man being in Christ he is a new creation Now look Jesus was a new creation that was God's creation he was the first of the new creation we'll get into that in a moment he was the first one of a new creation he was he was God's first born New Creation listen he built himself a body that was his new creation and if any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things are passed away means they're dead behold all things are become new and all things are of God and I want you to really notice this verse all things are of God thank you brother Joe I appreciate that all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation all things are of God all things are created by God he said to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them aren't you glad that that this verse is in there not imputing their trespasses unto them and ha committed unto us the word of reconciliation now we have the word of reconciliation he's given us what did he build his body with with the word a virgin shall conceive what's he building the bride with how's he going to reconcile the members of the Bride back to himself by the word right that's that's why we give the the such importance to the word of God he does it by his word he reconciles the world unto himself by the word of reconciliation the gospel of reconciliation the thing that brings to us is the word that that's what brings us back to God Amen it's the word of reconciliation he commits that to us but who did it he does it he's the architect he's the master builder then he gives it he commits that word of reconciliation to us amen 2 Corinthians 5:20 he said now then we are ambassadors for Christ we are ambassadors for Christ we represent Christ when an ambassador goes from this nation to another Nation he speaks for the US that that's that's his job that's what he says on the on the official record he may think differently but he speaks for the US right we might think differently it should be different but we speak for for God huh and Peter said let If any man speak let him speak as the Oracle of God an oracle wasn't in the in the Pagan world was an image that the that the God spoke through right it it was something that that was just given over to the to God to a god to speak through and we are the speak as the Oracles of God that God would actually speak through us oh that that you talk about a paradox he said for Heath made him him he said he let me back up we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us so when we ask you to be reconciled it's as if God is asking you to be reconciled we pray you in Christ said be reconciled to God for Heath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him you think about it when he was born you look at how innocent baby is we've had several babies born lately a baby's completely innocent right if a baby died they'd go to heaven no matter how sorry their parents were right because the baby's innocent the baby's innocent even though there's that nature in there that once he's old enough to know right and wrong it'll lead him to wrong right there's a nature there but but he's an innocent child now you think about a God created child and he's there in the manger and and Mary's taking care of him and he's he's just a baby and he's the most innocent thing most perfect thing that's ever been born in the world he was the righteousness of God and all of his life he never lost that he wasn't born of sexual desire he didn't have that that adamic curse that nature in him to to make him do wrong he never sent and we and he was made sin for us who did nothing but sin brother the Joe once we were old enough to Once We Were old to that's all we did but he the heavenlies was made sin for us he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin who was completely innocent that we might be made the righteousness of God so that before God we would come back as innocent as that baby as innocent as that man that hung on the cross that never did anything wrong that we might be made he was the righteousness of God he becom sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation that word is new creature a new creation that's in Galatians 6:15 now he's they're having the argument should we be circumcised should we not he said you don't understand it's not this flesh he's working on he's making him building himself a house and that's where legalism gets people in trouble you don't understand that that's not what he's doing he's building himself a house and it comes from the inside out not from the outside in listen the Bren says in God's power to transform he said Jesus Christ was God himself self manifested because he was the son because he was begotten it was just a tabernacle for him to live in no man has seen God at any time with the only begotten of the father has declared him God built himself a house body to live in come down so that you could touch him 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh seen of angels believed on received up into heaven he said you being flesh and him being flesh then you can have Fellowship now because he was God God's attribute of love God is love he that right and Jesus was God's attribute of love and if you have fellowship with God you'll have love for God right you have to he that's what he is that's what you are if you're a new creation then how will people know that who you are because you have love for one another right that's what the Bible says and it says when the at of love was displayed which that was God himself all the attributes that hung on to him in other words all the attributes that was his that you could ascribe to him all the attributes that hung on to him come to him everything that was like him come to him all the father has given me will come to me sure he said they had to be predestinated if it wasn't you won't be there aren't you glad that he's the one building the house amen he said you won't be there that's all he said now we can Fellowship I love this through the riches of his word brother Caleb we ought to be able to take the word in fellowship with one another because that's how we fellowship with God we can pray we talk to God and all those things and we feel the spirit of God but it's when we begin to get into his word that's how we begin to really fellowship with God why because this is him and we begin to get into the word and we begin to read we begin to see what he did for us and it just brings something to us why why does it mean so much to you when once it didn't because you're a part of that word and you can fellowship with him through the riches of his word which you are a part of that's why we like going to church that's why we like hearing the word that's why it's not enough just to go every now and then that's why it's not enough just to be a Halfway Christian we want to have fellowship with the word that's why whenever we hear something that goes against something we're doing we say Lord forgive me why we want fellowship with the word we don't want to be something different we want fellowship with the word because that's the riches of his word is how we have fellowship with him because he said he was the word at the beginning but you're the word now Revelations 3:14 it says under the angel of the Church of the Le ofans write these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation God I want us to look at something brother BR said in the church ages and we'll close for too awful long thank you for bearing with me this morning I know it's sometimes harder to listen when everything's new and and there's not very many people here and maybe you sitting at home if you know I know because I did it last week it's hard to listen at home you're sitting there and but I I got some good things out of the sermon that I listened to last weekend and and inspired me and so maybe it'll do the same thing for you today now brother BR says the church age book in the exposition of seven Church ages he said but now he is standing in the midst of the church he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author that's what that word beginning means doesn't mean the first one created it means the author of the creation of God he said this is another creation this has to do with the church so if he's the author of the creation of God he said this is a special designation designation of himself he is the creator of that church Church think about that just like he was the designer of that body that he lived in but it wasn't what anybody thought it would be right it wasn't made out of what people thought it wasn't some great intellectual some some man that could put it all together and and it was a man just like any other man brother Brandon said in one place he didn't look much like a leader you would wouldn't have picked him out to be the leader but he was God manifested In the Flesh but look but he is the beginning of the creation of God if he is creating what's he going to create he's going to create flesh and Bone he's going to create a house he's going to make himself a house he's going to cause you to have a new birth so he can have a house to live in but it's not going to be what everybody thinks you may have a little church here and a small one somewhere else and a big one over here you may have some that maybe don't have very high IQ thank god build himself a house he may wanted that now you can go to somebody else's house brother Harvey you walk in there and and start look I can't believe they use that kind of marble can't you can't believe they put that kind of countertops in they'll regret that you ever walk through a house and thought that wonder who they had installed the carpet you know he built himself a house he did it the way he want wanted it for his own purposes so he put however many we don't understand I don't know why there's so many Believers in Hardy I don't know why there's so many unbelievers in Hardy either but but you don't know why there's message people here what what sense does that make right as far as I know brother Bram never preached here you know if You' think there'd be a big church in Jonesboro or one in Memphis or one in St Louis where he begun his ministry where where would the people be why would God do that God does what he wants to do he builds himself a house that make sense and that's why we can't be pigheaded about it we can't be too stuck on what the way we've Envision of what God's going to do because he builds himself a house we can say you know I by faith I can buy so many chairs that we've got to stack them in the back but he's got to build himself a house does that make sense he builds the church he is the creator of that church amen and that's why the church can last the church may go through hell and back excuse me but that's that's what some of us have been through but if the church goes through that and back they're still his created church he does it he doesn't ask us how he wants us to do it if he wants to create the right kind of love the right kind of atmosphere the kind of spirit God does that we don't get it to ask as a minister we have no we have absolutely no control over our field of service I can't make myself a pastor an evangelist a prophet I can't do it I'm just am what I am right I can't do I can't be anything else I can just do what God called me to do and when God presents me with an opportunity I just have to do what God enables me to do I can't do anything else oh Church we could only understand it take some of the stress out out of it he is the creator of that church if he wants to use the materials maybe your children that have gone off and into the world and they're out there and you think how could he ever use them again if he wants to use them he'll find a way to do it he is the creator of that church he'll use the materials he wants to use he'll use the kind of preaching that he wants not the kind we want right he'll make it words hard sometimes to go to church maybe allow Satan to come in and do we know this virus come from Satan didn't come from God come from Satan but maybe God allows it just to see what we'll do right sometimes he allows it just to see what we'll do and how we'll react to it if we when we overcome it then it means something to us I'm praying for all of you today what what you're doing is you're not sick you're overcoming that's what you're doing today you're overcoming you're listening to the word you're overcoming amen now look he's the creator of that church he said the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride doesn't he have a right to he's not going to leave it to chance he's not going to use our dating networks to match himself up he's not going to use some denominational dating service right he's not going to let the Catholics control who who gets in who doesn't or the Methodist or the Baptist or the message people you going to do that he creates himself a body he creates himself a bride he said the bridegroom created his own bride I'm so glad he did because I have that gives me hope right I may be different from someone else but God creates his own bride you may be different from someone else but God creates his own Bride As the spirit of God he come down created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born he said I want to repeat that he created the very Sals in the womb of Mary for the body he created the very Sals for the body amen he said it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human ovam supplied by Mary that would have been sful mankind producing a body see man could not have any hand in it man could not have oh my it could not have any hand in it don't you realize he's creating a bride today that mankind will have no zero hand in it you won't be able to attribute it to a man you can't attribute the message to a man today you can't do it because the message people should have went nowhere because everything everybody fought with one another and there was so many doctrines and everything else but we're still here you can't attribute that to a man you can't even attribute that to ourselves God did it God made himself a bride and see then I'm not worried you know I know some are worried I and I see the same things they see I I see people falling into worldliness I see that I'm not worried about about it it bothers me I'll preach about it but I'm not worried that God's going to allow his bride to fall there does that make sense God builds himself a bride and if we begin to focus on all these things there'll always be a mixed multitude it may not be everybody it may be just a few but God built himself a bride and if I get an attitude where I can't help anybody because I'm I'm so concerned I'm so worried about it see I got to leave some things up to him Mary can't sit there and and constantly worry oh I don't feel it I don't feel it I don't feel it CU she didn't feel nothing for a long time but one day she began to feel she was pregnant that baby started to grow amen and she couldn't make it grow all she could do was eat you know that that's the best thing a mother can do for their baby is just eat you got licensed to eat now that don't continue after the baby is born but my wife I I didn't say a thing about what she I don't say much about what she eats anyway because that's dangerous but I didn't say a thing about what she ate while she was pregnant who am I to tell her what she needs right she she knows what she needs her own body has a craving for certain things because that's what the baby needs amen and the bride has a craving for a certain thing amen has a craving for the word and some God lay something on my heart not because I want to say it not for me but because the bride has a craving for a certain thing and that craving is fed by the word of God Amen Hallelujah maybe you didn't even know you wanted it all of a sudden you get to hear in the word he said that's exactly what I needed why is that because there was something inside of you that that is building God's creating himself a body and amen he said the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride amen he said that he said that would not have produced the last atom of him it was said l a body hast thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was the New Creation man and God met and join he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race amen not a black race or a white race a god race Colossians 118 it says and he is the head of the body the church who was the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship brother Mark made this Pulpit you know there's there's got to be a certain amount of of pride in that brother Mark not giving you Pride but you know you look at that say I made that I I've got a I'm not very good at working things up like that I've got this bookshelf that I put together myself at the house it's never made me want to look but Jo say I made that in fact Esther tried to move it and it come apart come home me with the pieces we sitting in the living room you don't know how many hours it took me to put that thing together but see we are his workmanship when he comes by he looks at it he says that's nice don't you want God to be able to say that about you he looks at and say it's been through a lot it's battered it's worn but but it's mine amen I've worked something in it that workmanship he's working what's he creating he's not creating better hands and a better looking face what's he creating love joy peace longsuffering amen gentleness kindness he's creating that creating it in us look we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them so yes we do good works but we do it because we've been created to do that this this Pulpit was created for a purpose we've been created to for a purpose by God we are his workmanship Ephesians 4:24 says put on the new man which after God is created after God or like God he's created in righteousness and true Holiness an exposition of seven Church ages that new creation brother BR says it's not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what what it says it is a new creation he said it is another creation distinct from the old one now listen to this no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh now anytime we have a problem we begin to think of ways to solve it God don't deal by ways of the flesh Abraham had a problem the baby wasn't being born he told everybody they were going to have a baby had a problem and so his wife got a little antsy she said well maybe I'm not a part of it Sarah got get a little antsy so she said why don't you go take Hagar and so Abraham agreed and he went and took Hagar what happened a wild man was born what what was it brother BR said it was the seed of a slightly doubted promise he was dealing by ways of the flesh attempting to make the promise come to pass we have to be careful with that because you can try to make you say well we need more Prophecy in the church we need more tongues we need more interpretation if you try to make it come to pass it's going to end up a seed of discrepancy right he don't deal by ways of the flesh God does what he wants to do that's how he dealt with this girl he don't deal because I go and to every one of you and and set you in order and build you up no I preach the word and God does the work uh whoever's behind the pulpit with brother Allen brother Stewart one of the other ministers they preach the word God does the work he's not dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac line he said but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he has purposed a new creation and he is the first of that creation that's what Christmas is it's not just a baby and a Manger but God was born it means I can be born again amen he was created in the fullness of the attributes of God I can be created in His image amen he said he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he's creating many sons un to himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation amen this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election amen that's why he could look right down he said to the last age when all would be over amen I love this he looked down to the end when all would be over the last messenger would come and go and everything was finished he looked down to that last stage and see himself in the midst of the church still in the midst of the church amen there could be Corona virus there could be War there could be rumors of War there could be political trouble there could be sicknesses there could be death there could be problems in the church it could be anything but he is still in the midst of his church well how could he look down and see himself still in the midst of the church because he is the author of this new creation of God he built it himself he knows the hurricane wind can't tear it down he knows that it it'll last remember when the man built the Titanic he said even God himself couldn't sink this ship they found out that wasn't true they found out God could sink that ship but when God built himself a body amen death itself couldn't hold him amen when he created himself a body when he built himself a tabernacle they hung him on a cross he was died so much the sun and the Stars everything else said he was dead but he rose again on the third day why because he was the Tabernacle of God God he said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption he would not leave his Creation in in the grave and if you are a new creation you will not remain in the grave amen hallelujah how could you remain in dead trespasses and sins and be a new creation of God you can't you can't do it he created something new something that wants to serve him amen when all is over he could look right down to the last stage and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of the new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation I might not have chose you you might not have chose me but it was him by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass I went back and found a commentary where he talks in John about how that he in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word created all things it talks about that and and the commentator looked at that and he said well he must be the father the word must be the father because you couldn't have two omnipotent beings with the power of creation amen it would have to be a part of that I said and he was a trinitarian but I thought he he's on to something he's on to something the word would have to be the father because he's omnipotent if you're on brother B talked about two omnipotence meeting but you've got to be a part of God to be omnipotent to be that omnipotent to have that seat you've got to be a part of the word are you with me this morning amen he's the only one that could do that by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure how did he know that it would last because he made sure how did he know he would be standing in the midst of the church and there would still be a church he made sure and that's why it don't bother me you say well people people fall oh preachers preach things that are wrong some of them leave the message even but God will have a church and he'll have workmen building in that church until he comes he he built it he's sure of it you may not be sure of it but God sure amen listen he said how could he be standing how would he know that he'd be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew listen and all things he worked out according to what he knew all things that's hard for us to take brother Isaac all things I've often wondered why I had to be born the way I was and come up the way I was and all things he worked out according to what he knew I wouldn't have done things the way that we've done them this this year wouldn't have done them at all the way we've done it we've done it because God works things out all things he knew he knew there would be a pandemic he knew there would we would we would be remodeling he knew things would happen the way that they did all things he worked out according to what he knew and some of you that are older can look back at your life and say all things he worked out according to what he knew and it gives you confidence you know you can you're going to make it your body might get weak and you might get you might be about one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana pill but all things he worked out amen according to what he knew don't you see he knew the devil would be here to lie steal kill and destroy he knew what age would be he wasn't surprised by what's going on he worked out according to what he knew he worked out all these things in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass Ephesians 1:11 puts it this way in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things how many things all things after the counsel of his own will he doesn't have to borrow materials he doesn't have to ask anybody he doesn't have to find out what the future holds he works all things after the counsel of his own will then what are you you're a creation of God then I can have confidence you might fail I might I might fail I might say something that wouldn't be exactly right and I'd have to come back and repent for that pray to God I wouldn't but I might do that I might do that I might fail you in some way but he'll work all things out Court after the counsel of his own will there was a a man we're getting close to Christmas time and was a man who invited Christ to dinner one time he was a cobbler in Germany he uh was real sincere and he thought Lord I don't have anything to give you don't have any family don't have anybody around me so I think this year instead of having treats and and party put up a tree I I just invite you to come and eat with me he didn't have anybody else so he made a roast of the lamb and made a real nice Feast said Lord we're eating at at six o'clock whatever it was that day he's cooking everything up come a knock on the door there's a little girl there that lost her way and she didn't know where her mama was and and she'd been lost and she'd come in he fed her a little bit and helped her find her mother still waiting on the Lord to show up it began to be very late and the time passed here come a a a lady an old lady that needed somewhere just to stop and rest for a while she said do you have anything to eat said well I have a guest coming over but guess I could spare a little bit and he gave her a little bit and pretty soon there come an old beggar D dressed in rags he' come knocking on the door and the man sitting inside said Lord where are you I invited you to come you said you'd come where you were invited and it may seem like a simplistic thing see sometimes we make it we make it too we make it too spiritual in some at times we do it's such a simple thing we invite him to come he he said Lord you said you would honor me with your presence I I felt your spirit and that you would come when I invited you and and yet you're not here this beggar knocked on the door and rags and he finally fed him the rest of the meal made sure he had a something warm and some food to take with him and a coat to hang on him and finally sent him out the door and he got down on his knees he said Lord you didn't come you promised he didn't come he said yes I did I was the little girl I was the old lady I was the beggar God built himself a house and came down and sat down and ate dinner three different times with the man who wanted to eat dinner with him we may think it's something little when we can do something for a member of the body of Christ someone and we don't know who that is always let me tell you something last night I was here about 5:30 and we put up cameras and stuff because I'm forgetful and there's always people stopping by and you can't give everybody that comes by something because it just gets to be too much and but I would stop it you know every once a while people people come in because it's a church they'll just walk in the door and so a lot of times I'll be in my office and somebody will come in but I was working in here on the sound system last night about 5:30 and I was getting a little mopy but Joe and him had just left they helped us clean up and I was getting a little bit mopy because I wasn't ready for day I didn't have everything prepared the way I wanted it and and I'm trying to prepare and finish setting up the sound we still didn't have it right this morning when we started we had to fix some things so I I was working on all that and Peter was here with me and a man just walked in the door as a young man and he might be listening this morning I gave him our card and and showed him how to watch the services but he and his wife had stopped by he said we've been driving by the church he said to go fishing every once in a while he said we see the church there we want to know what kind of church it was he said so I saw the light on and I thought I'd walk in and he said because it looked like you were open I said I guess we're open I got to talking to him and he didn't want money he wanted to know about God he wanted to know about about what we believed and and he'd been studying the scriptures and you could tell he he'd been studying and wanted to know those things and he asked me just out of the blue because I'd been get to talk to him about what we believed and just kind of tell him what kind of a church that we were and he told me he said I hadn't say anything about a prophet he said he said Do you believe God still has prophets I said let let me tell you about a prophet and I got to witness to the the message to someone for about 30 minutes standing back in the foyer last night well his wife waited in the car I thought God you work all things according to the counsel of your will see God might come by in a in a place in an image that we don't expect him and that might be an opportunity to minister to somebody I don't know you don't know how but somebody else knows that had no knowledge of the message last night somebody else knows today you see why it's important to keep the church open we can say it that way we can't be here all the time but we're the church we got to keep the church open see if you close yourself off and you won't talk to nobody and and you get to a point where you've been so hurt that you just stay to yourself but don't you see the church has to stay open so that if somebody comes by a beggar come and knock on the door you could give him some clothes so if a a person come wanting to know about a prophet you can tell him about a prophet you see you see what I'm saying this morning God built himself a house we're his house and he he's caused us to have this ministry this word of reconcil ation so that a new creation can be born in someone else God doesn't do anything by accident you're not here this morning by accident bow your heads with me if you will you're not here by accident today God builds himself a house you don't know you don't know why things are the way that they are I don't know why things are the way that they are but maybe that that person that you gave that furniture to those close to or maybe that was God reaching out to his children you don't know who they are you don't know who all the elect are I don't know God knows and if there's going to be a church here God will build himself a house I believe that you're born again this morning that you're Christians that new creation's been birthed inside of you if if that's the case this morning would you just ask God Lord help me to be Lord more like like you help me to be the kind of a house that's open that the door would be open so that if somebody come knocking on it this Christmas I'd be there it wouldn't be all about the the money and the presents and the things but there would just be something in my heart I'd want to give to you Lord it be something there that I could say Lord my house is open to the beggar to the old woman to the little girl I want to be able to see you in my neighbor I want to be able to see you in in the person I go to church with the person that may not be the best best singer the best person in the church maybe maybe in the past they've done things that aren't right but Lord help me to see you in that new creation Heavenly Father we thank you for meeting us here today sometimes Lord you get us out of our comfort zone so that you can just you could just come down and and speak to us directly I pray that that would be the case today Lord I I was so convicted myself last night Lord if you give me the opportunity to witness to somebody what a what an opportunity that is I've traveled thousands of miles to speak to people about the gospel about this message you gave me the opportunity to do it right here at the church last night God would you just help us to look for those opportunities and to be that house maybe not with words as someone has said preach everywhere when when you need to use words oh God would you just let our lives be a Shining Light and example of what you are May our doors always be opened may we not close them off with pride or jealousy or hurt or anger frustration may we be ready and always willing to give an answer for the hope that lays within us I pray you'd Grant it Lord we thank you for this house thank you for the place you provided for us to worship you it's not about these chairs this carpet it's not about this building it's about the house that you built we thank you for that Lord this Christmas May there just be a sweet presence Lord over every home may may there be a time of worship may we worship you this Christmas like never before and we not forget that you're the reason why you were born Lord and you become sin so that we could become your righteousness have that innocence bestowed back on our life we thank you for that imputed to us
