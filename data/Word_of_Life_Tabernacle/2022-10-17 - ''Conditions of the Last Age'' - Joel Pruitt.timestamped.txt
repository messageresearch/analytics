[45:37] amen the faithful and the true witness
[45:39] the beginning of the creation of God
[45:42] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[45:45] cold nor hot I would that thou were cold
[45:48] or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[45:50] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[45:53] thee out of my mouth
[45:54] and because thou sayest I am rich and
[45:57] increased with goods and have need of
[45:58] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[46:00] wretched and miserable poor blind and

[46:08] rich in white raiment that thou must be
[46:10] clothed and that the shame of thy
[46:11] nakedness do not appear

[46:40] overcame and am sit down with my father
[46:43] and his throne he that hath an ear let
[46:46] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[46:48] churches may the Lord add his Blessing
[46:50] to the word you may be seated and I
[46:53] would just like you to see there he
[46:54] tells you the condition that the church
[46:56] would be in at this time and he also
[46:59] tells you what you need to do to
[47:01] overcome that age and that Spirit of the
[47:04] age that we see and I think in this age
[47:06] you'll see that a form of godliness is
[47:08] rampant in the land and and what you'll
[47:10] see is there's a lot of church Hannity
[47:12] there's a lot of there's a lot of
[47:13] churches but what there is is a lack of
[47:16] the real moving of the spirit of God in
[47:17] the churches it is a form of godliness
[47:20] but they have denied the power thereof
[47:21] and what it is is their eyes have been
[47:23] filmed over by by a spirit of the age
[47:26] that is actually causing blindness
[47:28] throughout the whole land and you'll see
[47:30] people and they go to church and they
[47:32] just don't even understand I had a
[47:34] person tell me this week I believe she
[47:36] told me she was Methodist and and she
[47:37] was sitting there smoking a cigarette
[47:39] and telling me how you know she goes to
[47:41] Methodist because it's the closest
[47:42] church to her area but then you get to
[47:44] thinking they don't they don't go to
[47:45] church to hear the word they're going
[47:47] because they feel like they should it
[47:49] makes them a better person maybe but
[47:51] really what we're coming here for is not
[47:52] to just be a better member of society
[47:54] although that's good but we are here to
[47:57] to Really enter in and become an
[47:59] overcomer of this age because he said to
[48:02] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[48:05] on the throne
[48:06] and we see brother Branham uh excuse me
[48:09] second Timothy 3 would say it like this
[48:11] verse one he said this snow also then in
[48:13] the last days perilous times shall come
[48:15] for men shall be lovers of their own uh
[48:18] excuse me I'm on a steel brother
[48:20] Andrew's line here and say dumb devil
[48:22] when I messed up on my tablet he said
[48:24] for men shall be lovers of their own
[48:26] selves Covetous boasters proud
[48:27] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[48:29] unthankful Unholy without natural
[48:31] affection do we see that in the land
[48:33] today
[48:34] he said uh false accusers incontinent
[48:37] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[48:39] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[48:42] Pleasures more than lovers of God having
[48:43] a form of godliness but denying the
[48:46] power thereof now here's the Commandment
[48:47] part from such turn away he says that
[48:51] that would be happening but we are
[48:52] called to be a little higher than that
[48:54] today it doesn't make us a better person
[48:56] we're all Sinners saved by grace but
[48:58] what we are is an overcomer of one of
[49:00] the greatest times of of all ages this
[49:03] is the greatest age to live in because
[49:05] we have been called to overcome that age
[49:07] and brother Branham says it like this he
[49:09] said he said we've enjoyed about a
[49:11] 15-year Revival which according to
[49:12] history is longer than any Revival has
[49:14] ever lasted to my knowing he said
[49:16] usually Revival lasts about three years
[49:18] he said then it gets scattered but
[49:19] believing that this is one of the last
[49:21] great revivals that the world will
[49:23] receive he said it's come in the last
[49:25] stage the way to see an age at the end
[49:27] of the Pentecostal dispensation he said
[49:30] and I believe the church is now going
[49:31] into its lukewarmness as the Bible
[49:33] predicted and he goes on down to say he
[49:36] said I'm even surprised in a church here
[49:38] he said you've got people that's so
[49:39] cold-hearted they can't even shed a tear
[49:42] no more he said they just become so
[49:44] indifferent it's a spirit of the age now
[49:47] remember we're not we're not wrestling
[49:48] against flesh and blood but against
[49:50] spirits and principalities of the air
[49:52] and that's what has come upon us now
[49:54] it's not so much our brother that's
[49:56] fighting us through our sister that's
[49:57] fighting us but it's the spirit of the
[49:59] age that's fighting us and it's trying
[50:00] to take hold of our lives and take hold
[50:02] of our children and what it is we've got
[50:04] to overcome that age if we're ever going
[50:07] to make it any farther and I was
[50:09] thinking the song that was saying there
[50:10] sister Carla one of my favorite songs
[50:12] I'm going to make it
[50:13] because the Bible already told me I
[50:16] could make it but there's a way to be an
[50:18] overcomer and we must get ourselves in
[50:20] tune with the word of God to overcome
[50:22] the evils of this age and brother
[50:24] Branham says in the message leadership
[50:26] 1965 he says now look every three years
[50:28] after a messages went forth from God he
[50:31] said they organized and this has been 20
[50:33] years and there's no no organization he
[50:36] said and it won't see he said now the
[50:38] shuck has to pull away give the weed a
[50:40] chance to lay before the sun to ripen he
[50:42] said the message coming right back into
[50:44] the church again forming the body of
[50:46] Jesus Christ just like the original one
[50:48] that went into the ground he said now
[50:50] see the eternal life now he's likening
[50:53] that to a seed this he said Jesus was
[50:55] the first body
[50:57] and now the second one is another one
[50:59] but it's the Original Seed becoming a
[51:02] body of Christ now remember if a seed is
[51:04] planted if it has life in the seed it
[51:07] will bring forth the same life that
[51:09] Christ had here and so we go on down
[51:11] here he says he said sure he said the
[51:13] stock back here carried the life
[51:15] certainly it did he said but you see
[51:16] when it become the stalk and it was
[51:18] finished the organization the life went
[51:20] out he said right on into Wesley and
[51:22] went out he said in each one of them the
[51:24] life went out but he said don't look at
[51:26] the he said but don't look like the
[51:27] grain he said when the little pollen
[51:29] comes and and or the stock the pollen or
[51:31] the tussle he said it looks a whole lot
[51:33] like the grain but when it comes down to
[51:35] that shuck he said it's almost there he
[51:37] said and didn't Jesus say Matthew 24 24
[51:40] the two would be so close it would
[51:42] deceive the very genes predestinated
[51:44] brother Brandon calls it he said the
[51:46] very elected genes he said if it was
[51:48] possible almost like the real thing and
[51:50] you'll see a form of godliness in the
[51:52] church that looks like the real thing
[51:54] but I'm here to tell you it's false
[51:55] anointed ones at the end time they're
[51:57] preaching false doctrines and they're
[51:59] trying to get you off into some left
[52:01] field or right field but the Bible has
[52:03] tell has told us a way to overcome and
[52:05] it's by the full word of God the pure
[52:07] unadulterated word of God for the age
[52:09] and a messenger came and he said if this
[52:11] he said this is the way here's the light
[52:13] follow this and he told us what to do
[52:16] and and how to have church as the Pastor
[52:18] said this morning he told us all these
[52:20] things but it don't do any good to hear
[52:22] it if we're sitting back saying well
[52:23] that's good but I'm not going to
[52:25] overcome because there's just too much
[52:26] going on in my life but it's time we
[52:28] quit making excuses and be the Overcomer
[52:31] in this age
[52:33] he said if it was possible almost like
[52:35] the real thing see in the last days he
[52:38] said it's wheat time now it's harvest
[52:40] time he said this is not Luther's age
[52:42] this is not even the Pentecostal age
[52:44] this is the bride age remember we are
[52:47] being called out of laodicea but we are
[52:49] not meant to stay like the laodicean
[52:51] church and the laodicean church will be
[52:53] the lukewarm and the backsliders and the
[52:55] ones that are just going off he said he
[52:56] would spew them out but we were not
[52:58] called to be spewed out we were called
[53:00] to overcome this age and as Overcomers
[53:02] there's a part we must play in this
[53:04] great thing in this great drama that God
[53:06] put out he said to him that overcometh
[53:08] will I do what grant us sit with me on
[53:10] my throne
[53:12] so we're not living necessarily in the
[53:15] laodicean age although we know that's
[53:17] the last age but we are to be called out
[53:19] higher than that so when you see a
[53:21] spirit of laodicea on the church
[53:23] remember it's because you haven't been
[53:24] called higher yet
[53:26] and that's not the messenger's fault
[53:28] because he came to do just that but it's
[53:30] our own fault for allowing the things of
[53:33] the world to Cloud over our vision and
[53:35] he said we need to be Anointed with ice
[53:37] have so that we can see clearly the
[53:39] things that we need to overcome in this
[53:42] hour now remember he said as Moses
[53:44] called a nation out of a Nation Christ
[53:46] is calling a church out of a church he
[53:48] said you see the same thing in type
[53:50] taking taking them to this glorious
[53:53] Eternal Promised Land he said now to
[53:55] refuse that person that's doing the
[53:57] calling Christ no matter if your
[53:59] Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever
[54:01] you are he said nothing against them not
[54:03] at all but in this age now you've got to
[54:06] accept just like they did in that age
[54:08] the person of Christ Wishes the word
[54:12] you must accept the word of this age
[54:14] that's the only way you're going to
[54:16] overcome and the word is not just a dead
[54:18] letter but it is appointed word for you
[54:20] it is Anointed for the hour it will make
[54:23] you an overcomer if you just obey it in
[54:25] the beginning was the word and the words
[54:27] with God the Word was God the word was
[54:29] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and and it
[54:31] goes on the same yesterday today and
[54:32] forever Hebrews 13 8. He said brother
[54:34] Branham says You must accept that person
[54:36] of eternal life that's how you overcome
[54:39] it won't do you any good to try to
[54:42] overcome on your own merits but you must
[54:44] have the person of Jesus Christ he said
[54:46] now what life Luther had was
[54:48] justification Wesley had sanctification
[54:50] the Pentecost had the restoration of the
[54:52] gifts coming back in it he said but now
[54:55] it's completing the body he said you see
[54:58] the three phases of it and out of that
[55:00] then when the Resurrection comes the
[55:02] life that lived in them lutherans that
[55:04] went out the life that lived in the
[55:06] Methodist that went out the life that
[55:07] went in the Pentecostals all of it will
[55:09] be raptured out of the ground in the
[55:11] body of the Bride to be taken in before
[55:13] Jesus Christ he said oh it's exciting
[55:16] it's the truth it is exciting time to be
[55:20] called out because no other age could
[55:22] say what we say now we have seen the
[55:24] seventh angel messenger we know it's the
[55:26] end time we know what he said was to
[55:28] call out a bride and all we have to do
[55:30] is line up to it it's so simple but we
[55:33] live in an age of a deception and so
[55:35] many things are trying to distract us
[55:37] from the things of God and people are
[55:39] you know going to church now even it's
[55:41] not just a message thing where people
[55:42] are dropping out of church this is the
[55:44] thing that's happened all over the world
[55:45] there's people that would rather stay
[55:46] and and you'll see that the the the TV
[55:48] churches and online churches are getting
[55:50] bigger and bigger and you'll see that
[55:52] the the audience there at the church is
[55:53] getting smaller what is it it's the
[55:55] spirit of the age and when you fall into
[55:58] that spirit it's an illusion that has
[56:00] got you blinded and I say it's time
[56:03] tonight for the ice have to be put on
[56:05] your eyes so you can see that the word
[56:07] is still right there's still a people
[56:08] that will gather in the house of God
[56:10] they're still a people that will
[56:11] overcome the age there's still somebody
[56:13] that'll wake up in this hour and say I
[56:16] have not been called to let Luther
[56:18] Wesley message or any of these other
[56:19] messages but I have been called to a
[56:21] higher calling I have been called to
[56:23] have I settled my eyes so that I can see
[56:25] the word of God for my day
[56:28] he said we've turned a corner we're
[56:30] looking towards heaven watching for the
[56:31] coming he said the cap of the pyramid as
[56:33] we would say is coming back The Church
[56:35] Must Be resurrected soon we must get
[56:38] ready it's time that the bride has made
[56:41] herself ready but we have been given
[56:43] something to be dressed by and that
[56:45] thing that we've been given to be
[56:45] dressed by is the word we will be
[56:48] dressed in his righteousness clothed in
[56:50] his and and and that we are ready then
[56:52] but remember you have to do something
[56:54] you say well I'm just going to sit here
[56:56] I'm going to go to church and maybe
[56:57] you'll do all the right things for a
[56:59] while but then you sit there and you dry
[57:01] up as a church member and you get cold
[57:03] and formal and go into a message church
[57:05] becomes just as much as the Forum is
[57:07] going to the Baptist Church or anything
[57:08] else but what we need is an overcoming
[57:11] church that are not satisfied in the
[57:13] doldrums but they are raised to
[57:14] something new there is a quickening
[57:16] power in the bride there is something in
[57:19] the bride that will make him enjoy the
[57:20] word of God
[57:22] what's the matter today the church is
[57:23] cold he said we're not the church we've
[57:27] been called out he said now you know
[57:30] what's the matter with the church it's
[57:31] been so cold until it's got a spiritual
[57:34] cold
[57:35] he said it'll take more than grease
[57:37] to Open the Eyes he was telling the
[57:39] story about when he would get sick and
[57:41] the little draft would come in the cold
[57:42] and and and I believe his uncle or
[57:45] someone would would kill Coons and
[57:46] they'd take that grease and they'd rub
[57:47] it on their eyes you know and doesn't
[57:49] that sound good rub that grease in
[57:51] their eyes to try to get the the matter
[57:53] and stuff out of their eyes and he was
[57:54] telling that story and he said but it'll
[57:56] take the oil of the Holy Spirit and the
[57:59] power of the resurrection of Christ to
[58:01] take the coldness away from the church
[58:03] you say brother Branham wanted a nice
[58:05] quiet church I'm here to tell you he
[58:07] said we need to get rid of the coldness
[58:08] out of the church if you go to a funeral
[58:11] home brother Joe you know the thin
[58:13] bodies don't move and that's because
[58:14] they're cold and they're dead but if you
[58:16] go somewhere where there's life then
[58:18] you'll see some movement there you'll
[58:20] see something alive and we are not in a
[58:22] funeral home today but we are called out
[58:24] to be a living body of Jesus Christ in
[58:27] this hour
[58:29] it's so cold
[58:31] it's got a spiritual cold
[58:33] and he says we need the resurrection of
[58:35] Christ to take the coldness away from
[58:37] the church and open their eyes that they
[58:39] might see the presence of the Lord Jesus
[58:42] let him open your eyes he's the Holy
[58:45] Spirit he said here tonight to grease up
[58:47] your eyes with God's Sav open your eyes
[58:50] he said you know what he said American
[58:52] people he said want to be entertained
[58:56] they want some little Hollywood star
[58:57] with kinky hair and dressed up like I
[58:59] don't know what to come out and make
[59:00] entertainment because that's what you
[59:02] see on television he said I'm just one
[59:04] old-fashioned preacher that believes
[59:06] that there's no cure but the blood of
[59:07] Jesus Christ he said I'm getting so sick
[59:10] and tired of this American Hollywood
[59:11] evangelism going across the country with
[59:14] diamond rings and short-haired women and
[59:16] going across just carrying on and
[59:17] beating the drums somewhere and jumping
[59:19] up and down it's a disgrace he said we
[59:21] need the old time Saint Paul's Revival
[59:23] and the Bible holy goes back in the
[59:25] church with some real good Holy Ghost
[59:27] Salve to open the people's eyes he said
[59:30] that is the truth open our eyes and I
[59:33] would say tonight in the message if we
[59:35] need anything it's our eyes to be open
[59:37] the word has come the word is open to us
[59:40] now open my eyes so I can see it in what
[59:43] has happened Christ has been knocking on
[59:44] the door and the world has shut the door
[59:46] on him but to you that will open the
[59:49] door and hear his voice you are the
[59:51] Overcomer today
[59:53] and he said we need the old the real
[59:56] truth he said open our eyes he said when
[59:58] the real thing comes along he said
[1:00:00] people's so blind he said they can't see
[1:00:02] it he said God has been so merciful to
[1:00:04] us people that's become it's become
[1:00:06] common to us God and all of our coldness
[1:00:09] and difference and he still sends his
[1:00:11] Mercy still sends his Mercy after church
[1:00:14] after people had come to church and and
[1:00:16] they're cold and and they're indifferent
[1:00:18] and we have a good service like we did
[1:00:20] this morning and we go out and and we
[1:00:22] let things in the world just get us away
[1:00:24] from God but remember if we can take
[1:00:26] what we heard this morning and put it in
[1:00:27] our homes too don't make it just at
[1:00:30] church but make it at your home too it's
[1:00:32] time we have a spiritual home this is
[1:00:34] what was a spiritual church if we have a
[1:00:36] spiritual home I believe that'll make a
[1:00:38] spiritual church if you prayed more in
[1:00:40] home then I believe the house of God
[1:00:41] would become more alive
[1:00:44] well I tell you it it comes to a point
[1:00:47] that we just think we're okay in our
[1:00:49] cold condition we think we're okay by by
[1:00:51] doing what what our parents did and and
[1:00:53] I was raised on a on a message pew at
[1:00:56] times and and different churches and and
[1:00:58] uh and I I not really a message was it
[1:01:01] but we were all over the place at times
[1:01:02] but I was in the message long enough to
[1:01:05] know that I could act a part of a
[1:01:06] message person if I wanted to if I went
[1:01:09] to a church that shouted I could stand
[1:01:11] up if I wanted to if I went to one it
[1:01:13] was dead I felt just as good because I
[1:01:15] didn't have to move but let me tell you
[1:01:17] something there's something about a real
[1:01:19] born-again believer that when the word
[1:01:21] Goes Forth you can't help but respond in
[1:01:23] some way that brother Branham didn't
[1:01:25] teach us to have a cold formal church
[1:01:27] and I get so tired of hearing that
[1:01:29] brother branham's Church wasn't dead
[1:01:31] that was the word of God coming forth
[1:01:33] out of that church there's nothing Dead
[1:01:34] about it it was made alive and
[1:01:36] quickening power coming across that
[1:01:37] Pulpit I can't help it if the people
[1:01:39] didn't respond I can't help but I wasn't
[1:01:41] there so I could stand up and shout a
[1:01:42] little bit I can't help that I couldn't
[1:01:44] say Amen to the prophet but I'm here to
[1:01:46] tell you I've been given a chance today
[1:01:48] and today is the day when I choose to
[1:01:51] stand up and say Amen to the word of God
[1:01:53] I choose to say I will not be defeated
[1:01:56] but I'm an overcomer in laodicean age
[1:02:00] there's been plenty that's failed
[1:02:01] there's been plenty that will fail but
[1:02:04] in this age you have been called to be
[1:02:05] an overcomer
[1:02:07] he said to him that overcometh will I
[1:02:10] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:02:13] as I also overcame he was tempted just
[1:02:18] like you are
[1:02:19] remember that you're not the only one
[1:02:21] that's been tempted you're not the only
[1:02:24] one that has had problems you're not the
[1:02:26] only person who's had struggles on
[1:02:28] Sunday mornings you're not the only
[1:02:30] person who's had to deal with sickness
[1:02:32] and maybe at times you've been broken
[1:02:34] couldn't hardly afford to get to church
[1:02:36] you're not the only one there's been a
[1:02:38] whole lot of us in that condition but
[1:02:40] I'm here to tell you today there is an
[1:02:42] overcoming power here for you in this
[1:02:44] age he said I will not leave you
[1:02:46] helpless but I will come to you in the
[1:02:49] hour of need he's always there he will
[1:02:52] never give up on you he said he's always
[1:02:54] he still sends his Mercy you say well I
[1:02:58] don't know if I can overcome I don't
[1:03:01] know if I can overcome this weekend
[1:03:02] because there's a football game on and I
[1:03:04] really got to go see it and I'll go to
[1:03:06] church next weekend and maybe the kids
[1:03:07] will be feeling a little better you know
[1:03:09] if we give the devil an excuse I'm not
[1:03:10] saying if your kids are home sick that's
[1:03:12] fine but if you give the devil a few
[1:03:15] excuses
[1:03:16] he'll always give you an excuse
[1:03:19] that's just the truth of it if you if
[1:03:22] you stay home for one reason at some
[1:03:24] point you've got to overcome something
[1:03:26] at some point you've got to say you know
[1:03:28] what I'm going anyway
[1:03:30] well it might hurt but it's the truth
[1:03:31] anyway why did we give in to the devil
[1:03:34] when we're called to be Overcomers why
[1:03:37] do we give in and say well it's it's
[1:03:38] okay it's okay to do this and and we
[1:03:41] don't actually have to go to church and
[1:03:43] we don't actually have to take our
[1:03:44] children to Sunday school and we don't
[1:03:46] actually have to respond to the word of
[1:03:48] God we don't actually have to do
[1:03:49] anything but the Overcomer will
[1:03:52] oh yeah we don't hey there's no law that
[1:03:54] tells me I got to be up here tonight but
[1:03:56] the Overcomer told me as I overcome this
[1:03:58] age and he said he said to you we're
[1:04:01] called to preach and I believed it and I
[1:04:03] went to the word and I found it in there
[1:04:04] and I'm just going to tell you whether I
[1:04:06] I may not be the best but I'm just going
[1:04:08] to do what God told me to do anyway
[1:04:10] come on you know we're not trying to be
[1:04:13] anybody else my name don't have to be in
[1:04:15] the book of who's who but but at least
[1:04:17] I've got a good one-liner going around
[1:04:18] the message and people are talking about
[1:04:20] me even if it is negative but you know
[1:04:22] what
[1:04:23] we get so out there thinking we if we're
[1:04:27] not the best we don't want to be nothing
[1:04:28] at all
[1:04:29] right you are the best
[1:04:31] you're the best you've been called to
[1:04:33] something and if all it is is an
[1:04:36] overcomer
[1:04:37] maybe you're not called to preach maybe
[1:04:39] you're not called to sing but if you've
[1:04:40] been called to be an overcomer that's
[1:04:42] plenty
[1:04:43] because that's a whole lot that's a
[1:04:46] whole lot more than your neighbor
[1:04:47] probably you go down the street and look
[1:04:49] at all them all them people standing out
[1:04:51] there on Sunday afternoon in their
[1:04:52] shorts and and sitting out there smoking
[1:04:53] a cigarette and you think about
[1:04:54] something you think they've never heard
[1:04:56] what you've heard
[1:04:57] they've never heard it they know nothing
[1:04:59] about it and if they did maybe they
[1:05:01] wouldn't accept it but you did
[1:05:04] because you heard an eagle scream in
[1:05:06] your hour you heard something for you
[1:05:09] you heard something that you knew was
[1:05:12] right and what wasn't it wasn't your
[1:05:14] flesh that agreed with it because by all
[1:05:16] accounts when the preacher gets up here
[1:05:17] he's going to say something that makes
[1:05:19] you feel bad in your flesh but we are
[1:05:21] more than conquerors we are Overcomers
[1:05:24] of this hour
[1:05:25] we've been born we've been born for for
[1:05:28] this as I've said before we were born
[1:05:30] for this season born for this time he
[1:05:33] said here's some time ago a man wanted
[1:05:35] to be inspired and he went down to the
[1:05:36] sea to be inspired and on his road down
[1:05:38] you've heard the story he met an old
[1:05:40] salt coming back an old sailor that
[1:05:42] lived on the sea born on the sea he said
[1:05:44] my good man we're goeth thou he said sir
[1:05:47] I'm going down to the sea to be inspired
[1:05:49] oh I want to smell the salty air I want
[1:05:51] to see the great ocean as it whips up
[1:05:53] its big Briny waves and see the
[1:05:55] reflection of the sky and it's blue
[1:05:56] water
[1:05:57] I want to hear the scream of the
[1:05:59] seagulls he said oh I'm sure I'll Be
[1:06:01] Inspired when I get to the Sea
[1:06:04] I've longed to see it all my life I've
[1:06:06] longed to see the sea and the old salt
[1:06:09] said to him well I was born on it and
[1:06:12] I've sailed the seven seas and I don't
[1:06:15] see nothing inspired about it
[1:06:17] he said why he was used to it
[1:06:20] and I wonder if in this age we haven't
[1:06:22] just become so used to it
[1:06:24] that way it's become common to us going
[1:06:27] to church is so common well we've heard
[1:06:29] it preached all our lives but it's
[1:06:31] become calm and it's almost like you
[1:06:32] preach it and it comes back at you like
[1:06:34] it didn't even sink in and you've
[1:06:36] preached these things and you wonder why
[1:06:38] why did they just go out there and it
[1:06:39] seems like this comes back to you it's
[1:06:41] because it's become common to the people
[1:06:43] but you know it's like buzzwords around
[1:06:45] the message well we don't want to use
[1:06:46] the buzzwords but listen if I said God
[1:06:48] sent a prophet that ought to make
[1:06:49] somebody happy if I said you're an
[1:06:52] overcomer in this age that ought to make
[1:06:53] somebody happy if I said you are more
[1:06:55] than a conqueror somebody ought to be
[1:06:57] excited about that if I said Jesus died
[1:06:59] on the cross and that's all I said
[1:07:01] somebody
[1:07:02] ought to be excited about it because he
[1:07:04] did it for you he did it for you so that
[1:07:07] you could overcome this age
[1:07:09] you say well it's become common in so
[1:07:12] many phrases because you know there's
[1:07:13] only 1200 tapes you know we're not it's
[1:07:15] not like we're just making more of them
[1:07:17] so you're going to hear the same thing
[1:07:19] sometimes but don't let it become common
[1:07:21] to you
[1:07:22] don't let you know the sir the brother
[1:07:24] Ben has been on a sermon for about five
[1:07:26] Sundays now we're on a series not a
[1:07:28] sermon it seems like
[1:07:30] but it's
[1:07:31] serious for five Sundays but listen we
[1:07:34] shouldn't let that become common well
[1:07:36] he's preaching there's he's preaching on
[1:07:38] uh preaching on uh you know a home to
[1:07:40] come back to for five Sundays I've heard
[1:07:42] it the first time I don't need to hear
[1:07:43] it the other four
[1:07:44] well maybe you need to hear the same one
[1:07:46] five times
[1:07:48] wouldn't hurt nobody
[1:07:49] and we've left the message you know
[1:07:51] sometimes we'll turn on a tape and and
[1:07:53] I'm guilty of this I used to do this all
[1:07:55] the time we turn on the tape just so
[1:07:56] it's play and say hey I listen to a tape
[1:07:58] today you ever done that anybody don't
[1:07:59] have to raise your hands
[1:08:01] but but you just turn on the tape hey I
[1:08:03] want to hear a tape and you just have it
[1:08:04] playing and it's just going and you
[1:08:06] didn't hear a word that was on it
[1:08:08] yeah somebody's done it I can't be the
[1:08:10] only one
[1:08:13] but you do it
[1:08:15] and and it's probably okay I guess but
[1:08:17] you know it really isn't doing you that
[1:08:19] much good you say well the atmosphere
[1:08:20] might be better and that's fine if
[1:08:21] that's what it does you know what some
[1:08:23] children sleep with the tape that's what
[1:08:24] I'm not condemning that what I'm trying
[1:08:26] to say is sometimes you need to sit down
[1:08:28] and actually hear what it's saying
[1:08:30] that don't hurt either
[1:08:32] you say well there's some tapes I don't
[1:08:33] listen to flashing red lights is one of
[1:08:36] them
[1:08:37] it don't hurt to listen to some of those
[1:08:38] hard messages once in a while because
[1:08:40] something's going to have to help you
[1:08:41] overcome this age something's going to
[1:08:43] tell you what you need to hear not what
[1:08:45] you want to hear but something's going
[1:08:46] to tell you what you need to hear and
[1:08:48] that's the matter that's what's the
[1:08:50] matter he said with the Pentecostal
[1:08:51] church and the rest of them today he
[1:08:53] said you're so used to seeing the powers
[1:08:55] of God and the glory of God he said in
[1:08:57] the goodness of God till you just don't
[1:08:59] pay any attention to it no more that's
[1:09:02] it he said it becomes a common thing
[1:09:05] and I wonder in the message
[1:09:08] the greatest message that could be sent
[1:09:10] to the church if we sit and we hear
[1:09:13] those tapes and when he says the
[1:09:15] Christian will go to church
[1:09:17] it we we need to let that sink in a
[1:09:19] little bit
[1:09:21] you'd say Well it hurts me just a little
[1:09:22] bit
[1:09:23] but we need to try to line up to that
[1:09:25] because if you can't overcome that
[1:09:28] how are you going to overcome the other
[1:09:29] evils that are coming
[1:09:31] you got to start somewhere
[1:09:33] and if I can't even overcome the little
[1:09:36] things how am I ever going to overcome
[1:09:38] the big things When sin comes in your
[1:09:40] life how are you ever going to overcome
[1:09:42] that if you can't overcome the
[1:09:43] Simplicity you say well brother Joel
[1:09:46] I've been revelated and and I need this
[1:09:48] and I need that but listen we need more
[1:09:50] than just little things we need
[1:09:52] something that will hold us we need to
[1:09:54] hear the the revealing of the word of
[1:09:56] God and we need to actually go in there
[1:09:58] and study it and understand what it's
[1:10:00] saying it's not just a a voice that goes
[1:10:03] out and it just goes into the air and
[1:10:05] it's not just I heard the voice today
[1:10:07] and and it was a good tape and and I
[1:10:09] went and sat for two hours and I did
[1:10:11] this that's okay but let me tell you
[1:10:12] something at some point you got to live
[1:10:15] it
[1:10:16] some point you got to overcome it
[1:10:19] it's okay to read your Bible you need to
[1:10:21] read your Bible brother Branham says a
[1:10:23] Christian reads his Bible and prays
[1:10:24] every day it's what we should be doing
[1:10:26] but I just go ahead and tell you to read
[1:10:27] the letters it's not going to do you no
[1:10:28] good until the quickening power comes in
[1:10:30] and makes you live in you those letters
[1:10:32] didn't do you no good but when the words
[1:10:34] come out of the page and come into you
[1:10:37] then it'll do something for you it'll
[1:10:39] make you live the word
[1:10:41] it'll make you live the word he said
[1:10:43] that's he said that's the problem it has
[1:10:45] become a common thing but I would like
[1:10:47] to just propose to you today I think
[1:10:49] it's time we took the message off the
[1:10:51] shelf and brought it into the heart took
[1:10:53] it off the tape and put it into your
[1:10:55] heart quit reading the Bible like it's
[1:10:57] just a history book but start reading it
[1:10:59] like it applies to you today
[1:11:02] the message of the hour it doesn't come
[1:11:05] just to just to bring it to make you
[1:11:06] feel good and I I know it I I love
[1:11:09] listening to the tapes sometimes I like
[1:11:11] to go listen just the stories because
[1:11:12] you think about the stories that are on
[1:11:14] the tapes and and you think about how
[1:11:16] how good they are and how it makes you
[1:11:18] feel you know you think about you can
[1:11:19] kind of get to know brother Branham a
[1:11:20] little bit and you get to know what he
[1:11:22] was like as a man and and I love those
[1:11:24] things I love that history side of it
[1:11:25] but brother at some point quit looking
[1:11:27] to the man and start looking to the word
[1:11:29] that he brought
[1:11:31] and the word that he brought will make
[1:11:32] you an overcomer this day the word that
[1:11:34] he brought will do something for you
[1:11:36] that'll change your life maybe you won't
[1:11:38] shout all the time but your life will
[1:11:40] change
[1:11:41] something will take place and remember
[1:11:44] he said that lukewarm and he said I will
[1:11:47] spew thee out of my mouth he would
[1:11:48] rather you be cold or hot
[1:11:51] and I don't want to be cold
[1:11:53] so why not be an overcomer today I think
[1:11:56] we overthink these things sometimes I
[1:11:59] think we get to thinking that overcoming
[1:12:00] is too hard but we're not the ones
[1:12:02] actually doing the overcoming
[1:12:05] because if we were doing it on our own
[1:12:07] there's none of us here that would be
[1:12:09] able to do it but there is a person
[1:12:12] of Jesus Christ
[1:12:15] who has come in this day now I'm not
[1:12:17] talking about a flesh man but I'm
[1:12:19] talking about a man that was revealed in
[1:12:21] a flesh man and he was revealed to you
[1:12:23] and me it was a son of man revealing the
[1:12:26] son of man that could make you an
[1:12:28] overcomer he was calling a church out of
[1:12:31] a church and he would call that church
[1:12:33] to come out uh Overcomer he would call
[1:12:35] them the Bride of Jesus Christ and I
[1:12:38] think that's the way it is today we have
[1:12:40] got so so into our own little forms and
[1:12:42] our own little circles in the message we
[1:12:44] think of a service in a certain way or
[1:12:46] or a preacher Don't Preach a certain way
[1:12:48] or we don't have things just in a
[1:12:50] certain order we think something's wrong
[1:12:52] and and something's off about the
[1:12:54] service but let me tell you something
[1:12:55] we're all trying to do the same thing
[1:12:57] overcome and stay with the word
[1:12:59] there will be conditions of a lukewarm
[1:13:01] and formal church but then there will be
[1:13:03] conditions of a rapture-ready church and
[1:13:06] I want to be in the condition of a
[1:13:08] rapture-ready church I don't want to be
[1:13:11] in the condition when the bombs start
[1:13:12] falling listen I don't want to be here
[1:13:14] he said and he said Abraham's group
[1:13:16] listen Abraham's seed won't be
[1:13:19] they won't be here when the first bomb
[1:13:22] he says in one place and I love the way
[1:13:23] he put it he said when they've got that
[1:13:25] lever pulled back and just as soon as
[1:13:27] they go to release it he said well be
[1:13:29] caught up and we'll look back on the
[1:13:31] destruction and I love how he said it
[1:13:33] because I'm not going to be here to see
[1:13:35] the nominal lukewarm Christians and I'm
[1:13:37] not going to see what they have to go
[1:13:39] through to make it you say well brother
[1:13:40] as long as I'm a Christian I'm going to
[1:13:42] make it you may be a Christian but I
[1:13:44] don't want to go through the things that
[1:13:46] are coming and just be a Christian I
[1:13:47] want to be an overcomer I want to be in
[1:13:49] the bride group that is caught up before
[1:13:51] those things hit the earth and brother
[1:13:53] tonight I think it's time that the
[1:13:55] church quit staying in this cold
[1:13:56] condition and the lukewarm condition and
[1:13:59] we'd be called to an overcomer today and
[1:14:01] be called to overcome these things of
[1:14:03] the world whether it's a lust Spirit
[1:14:04] whether it's a sports Spirit that's got
[1:14:06] you out of church or whether it's to
[1:14:08] stay home and watch your favorite show
[1:14:09] on TV whatever it is get over that thing
[1:14:12] and come up a little higher and come up
[1:14:14] into the things of God because what you
[1:14:16] feed on that's what you become and what
[1:14:18] you feel on is what you're becoming
[1:14:20] every day remember if you'll feed on the
[1:14:22] word you will become the very body of
[1:14:25] the word he said that's what he's making
[1:14:27] in this hour is a body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:29] today
[1:14:31] but you've got to overcome to do that
[1:14:33] this church is an overcomer
[1:14:36] and he'll always send Mercy
[1:14:39] he will always send Mercy I think that's
[1:14:42] the thing we need to know today is is
[1:14:43] we're not here on our own
[1:14:45] we're not by ourselves
[1:14:47] there is a there is a way to overcome
[1:14:50] this age we've seen the light that is
[1:14:53] shown on the message we've seen the
[1:14:55] scriptures revealed no other age could
[1:14:58] say that we see the opening of the word
[1:15:01] but we see the opening of the word no
[1:15:03] other age could say I'm going to
[1:15:06] overcome the last day uh the distress
[1:15:09] between nations the perplexity of times
[1:15:10] no other age can say they're going to
[1:15:11] overcome that
[1:15:12] but we can
[1:15:14] and I was listening to the layout of
[1:15:16] seeing Church age the other day brother
[1:15:17] was preaching and he said he was talking
[1:15:20] about the one that would come how many
[1:15:21] he's heard him talk about it and he's
[1:15:23] talking about the uh the messenger that
[1:15:25] would come to the laodicean church agent
[1:15:27] he doesn't call it call himself that but
[1:15:29] we know who it is just by what he said
[1:15:30] it would be and he said this man would
[1:15:32] be like the Elijah spirit and and he
[1:15:34] would be called and he would be come out
[1:15:36] and he'd be against certain things and
[1:15:37] he goes into detail on all this and but
[1:15:39] remember there would be a people that
[1:15:41] would hear what he said
[1:15:43] and he said there would be something he
[1:15:45] said the man didn't come he said just to
[1:15:47] make another church or to make another
[1:15:49] organization he said it didn't come just
[1:15:51] to build up another group of people but
[1:15:52] he said he'd come to call him out of the
[1:15:54] groups that were there and I loved how
[1:15:56] he said it and he went into detail about
[1:15:58] all these little things and and how the
[1:15:59] Overcomer would be and he said but the
[1:16:01] laodicean church age he said would be
[1:16:03] total chaos and destruction and things
[1:16:05] like that but he said the Overcomer in
[1:16:07] that layout of cnh would be the very
[1:16:09] body of Jesus Christ and I wonder if
[1:16:11] today you're looking around and you see
[1:16:13] the flaws of your neighbor you see
[1:16:15] somebody in the church that ain't doing
[1:16:16] just right they're trying to overcome
[1:16:18] just like you are
[1:16:20] I I'm trying to overcome just like you
[1:16:23] are I've got things in my life every day
[1:16:25] Satan tries to fight me but I'm trying
[1:16:27] to overcome just like you are and I'm
[1:16:29] not giving up till I do
[1:16:32] Satan can't hold me back I'm not giving
[1:16:34] up I'm not giving in to the age and the
[1:16:36] spirit of laodicea but I'm going to be
[1:16:38] called out and when I come into that
[1:16:40] bright age remember when you reach that
[1:16:42] Perfection that's when the church is
[1:16:43] going to be taken home you say well I
[1:16:45] can't be perfect but remember there is
[1:16:47] going to come a bride that will be
[1:16:49] perfected by the word you won't be
[1:16:51] perfected on your own merits you won't
[1:16:52] be perfected by what church you go to by
[1:16:55] some big church or organization well I
[1:16:57] go to the biggest church in the message
[1:16:58] and that's okay but that's not what
[1:17:00] you're going to be measured by there's
[1:17:02] cold people sitting in the big churches
[1:17:03] there's cold people sitting in the
[1:17:05] little churches there's lukewarm sitting
[1:17:07] all around but I'm here to tell you it
[1:17:09] could be a little church in Hardy
[1:17:10] Arkansas where there's somebody on fire
[1:17:12] for God there's somebody who has been
[1:17:15] called out and said I am an overcomer of
[1:17:18] laodicea I am more than just a church
[1:17:21] member I am more than a Baptist I'm more
[1:17:23] than a Methodist I'm more than a
[1:17:25] Catholic I'm more than just a message
[1:17:27] believer I am a message liver
[1:17:31] I'll leave it I don't just hear it I
[1:17:34] don't just say I do it I don't just say
[1:17:36] well I press play today and I'm okay no
[1:17:39] I'm gonna do what he said do and if I do
[1:17:41] what he said do then I'm doing what the
[1:17:44] word said to do remember brother Brandon
[1:17:45] didn't come with his own words but he
[1:17:47] come to open the very word to us we were
[1:17:49] blinded we didn't see but he came with
[1:17:52] the ice have so that we could see what
[1:17:55] we needed in this hour to overcome
[1:17:58] but we get cold we get formal we get on
[1:18:01] our own we think we're good enough
[1:18:04] that's the problem with the age
[1:18:06] everything's just good enough
[1:18:08] and it happens in workplaces it happens
[1:18:10] in family lives and we think we're good
[1:18:13] enough
[1:18:14] if our kids if we look in the room and
[1:18:16] they're praying
[1:18:17] before they go to bed and
[1:18:19] and we think well that's good enough
[1:18:21] but did you ever get them together and
[1:18:23] pray around an altar together
[1:18:25] and really pray through
[1:18:27] the little things are good good night
[1:18:29] prayers are good and and those are those
[1:18:31] are wonderful things but I wonder
[1:18:34] if we've ever had something come up in
[1:18:36] us the spirit come upon us and say
[1:18:39] there's something more you need to do
[1:18:40] with your family
[1:18:41] there's something more
[1:18:43] you need to do in your church
[1:18:45] it's not just good enough
[1:18:47] to go there and act like a Christian
[1:18:51] it's it's not just good enough
[1:18:53] to say well my kids went in there and
[1:18:55] they prayed and they said you know
[1:18:57] bless the Lord my soul to keep and
[1:19:00] that's good
[1:19:03] but if they ever got down and heard what
[1:19:05] it means to really pray through
[1:19:07] it's going to be required of this age
[1:19:10] you're not going to make it on what your
[1:19:12] parents did or your grandparents did
[1:19:14] you're not going to make it
[1:19:16] on what I do or what someone else is
[1:19:18] doing
[1:19:19] if we don't set a standard now for our
[1:19:22] children
[1:19:23] the churches are going to get colder and
[1:19:25] colder
[1:19:26] and they're going to get farther and
[1:19:27] farther I'm just talking to you right
[1:19:29] now but I'm just going to tell you this
[1:19:30] if we continue on that path of saying
[1:19:33] it's just good enough
[1:19:34] we brought him to church until they were
[1:19:36] 18. we drug them to church till he's 18.
[1:19:38] the reason you're dragging them is
[1:19:39] because they don't want to go and get
[1:19:40] what you got
[1:19:41] oh come on come on come on listen I'm
[1:19:44] just going to tell you when I started
[1:19:45] seeing people in the message with
[1:19:47] something something real
[1:19:49] when I started seeing people with
[1:19:51] something on fire when I started seeing
[1:19:53] the word work oh yeah then I wanted what
[1:19:55] they had
[1:19:56] if a parent can make it so in their home
[1:19:59] that they're living such a life that
[1:20:01] they don't have to beat their kids to
[1:20:03] the family Altar and you don't have to
[1:20:04] drag them to church but they want what
[1:20:07] you got they want to live like you're
[1:20:09] living there's a time in life where you
[1:20:11] have to be able to say you don't have to
[1:20:13] look at the preacher and do what he's
[1:20:15] doing but look at me in my life I'm an
[1:20:18] overcomer if I can overcome you can too
[1:20:21] come on
[1:20:23] we just get so cold and indifferent and
[1:20:26] brother Brandon tells us that and he
[1:20:28] goes on down and this message door to
[1:20:29] the heart if you get a chance go listen
[1:20:31] to door to the heart 1958 19 yeah uh
[1:20:34] March of 1958 door to the heart brother
[1:20:36] man talks about
[1:20:38] Jesus knocking on the door
[1:20:40] many of you heard this he's knocking
[1:20:42] he's knocking
[1:20:43] and you don't ever open it oh I know
[1:20:45] who's at the door I know who's telling
[1:20:47] me to do better I know who's calling me
[1:20:49] to be an overcomer but I just don't feel
[1:20:52] like it today if not now when
[1:20:56] if not now your children will suffer for
[1:20:59] it my children children will suffer for
[1:21:02] the decisions I make today and if that's
[1:21:04] the way we raise them church that's our
[1:21:07] fault brother Branham calls it parent
[1:21:08] delinquency because he says he says it's
[1:21:12] not the children because the way they
[1:21:13] were raised up remember you'll hear the
[1:21:15] stories in the Bible about the woman
[1:21:17] that was in prostitution and things like
[1:21:19] that and brother Brandon talked about
[1:21:20] her home life and attributed that to
[1:21:22] being the reason for the way she was I
[1:21:25] say it's time for the parents to take
[1:21:27] over in the home and to come and
[1:21:28] Overcomer ourselves so that our children
[1:21:31] will have a Fighting Chance
[1:21:33] it's time we quit saying it's good
[1:21:35] enough and we sent him off to school and
[1:21:37] and we sent him off to here and and then
[1:21:39] when they get home we're too tired and
[1:21:41] we go to bed and our children to see us
[1:21:43] once in a while and then they see us go
[1:21:44] to church and and then when we're there
[1:21:46] we don't enjoy it and and we sit there
[1:21:48] and we're just cold and we go back out
[1:21:50] and and they see these things kids are
[1:21:52] not stupid you know kids are actually
[1:21:54] pretty smart kids are watching every
[1:21:56] move you make
[1:21:57] every move you make and I'm here to tell
[1:22:00] you it's time we start living what we're
[1:22:03] preaching to them that goes for me too
[1:22:06] if my kids will sit here and they'll say
[1:22:08] Dad I heard you say a certain thing and
[1:22:10] I didn't do it at home let me tell you
[1:22:11] something
[1:22:12] I'd feel pretty guilty about that
[1:22:15] and you say you say brother Joel is
[1:22:17] everything perfect in your home oh Lord
[1:22:18] no
[1:22:21] I've got kids and a wife just like y'all
[1:22:28] she's the best yesterday was our 11th
[1:22:30] anniversary she's put up with me all
[1:22:31] those years
[1:22:38] I can't believe she's still married to
[1:22:39] me after I started preaching I tell you
[1:22:41] I've made her she don't even blush but
[1:22:43] I've made her blush more than I can
[1:22:45] count since I started
[1:22:47] but we've got to live what we preach
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:51] get back on track Lord help me
[1:22:54] we've got to live what we preached to
[1:22:57] him that overcomes
[1:22:58] an overcomer what is an overcomer
[1:23:00] someone who doesn't give up
[1:23:03] if I run into an obstacle at my job
[1:23:06] and I just feel like I can't do it well
[1:23:09] there's ways to overcome the obstacle
[1:23:11] I can call somebody that knows what
[1:23:13] they're doing
[1:23:14] I can hire somebody who knows what
[1:23:15] they're doing yeah
[1:23:16] yeah or I can give up chances are you
[1:23:19] give up you ain't getting paid
[1:23:20] right
[1:23:21] it's just the truth of it
[1:23:23] you really think you're gonna inherit
[1:23:25] all things if you give up now
[1:23:28] you're not going to inherit nothing
[1:23:30] you want an inheritance we're talking
[1:23:33] about the inheritance of the children of
[1:23:34] Abraham we talk about the promises of
[1:23:36] God and we all want those promises and
[1:23:38] it makes us happy to hear about it but
[1:23:40] you're not getting them if you don't
[1:23:41] overcome something
[1:23:43] you have to go over have the children of
[1:23:45] Israel ever get to the land they had to
[1:23:47] overcome an obstacle
[1:23:49] they had to go through Giants to get
[1:23:51] there but we're more than able if we'll
[1:23:54] just take the word of God we've been
[1:23:56] given a sword and in this hour listen
[1:23:58] we've been given more than just uh what
[1:24:00] they had in the ages the the church ages
[1:24:02] they had just enough to overcome but
[1:24:04] today we've we've got more to overcome
[1:24:06] but we've got a lot more ammunition as
[1:24:08] well we've got a whole lot more than
[1:24:10] what they had you say they could preach
[1:24:11] justification and they would call out a
[1:24:13] people they'd preach sanctification and
[1:24:15] call that a people but we have been
[1:24:17] called to all things and we have been
[1:24:19] given a message of overcoming power
[1:24:23] overcoming all things overcoming every
[1:24:26] every every demon every devil that would
[1:24:29] come at you everything that you've got
[1:24:31] in your life you've been called to
[1:24:32] overcome that and remember David could
[1:24:36] have given up when he saw Goliath and I
[1:24:38] tell you I'm not of in my flesh but if
[1:24:40] there's a spirit on the inside man that
[1:24:42] says hey go ahead and fight that devil
[1:24:45] I've already seen him laying out there
[1:24:46] you know what remember we heard the
[1:24:48] other night it's a vision God had a
[1:24:49] vision of your life if you'll just keep
[1:24:51] on track if you're to stay with the word
[1:24:54] of God that's the vision for your life
[1:24:56] is the word of God but remember we've
[1:24:58] got to overcome and no doubt when David
[1:25:00] come out there and maybe he prayed
[1:25:02] before he went out but he saw that that
[1:25:04] Goliath standing out there and look at
[1:25:06] what's in his way I'll bet today you say
[1:25:08] well there there's a little something a
[1:25:09] little obstacle to overcome to get where
[1:25:11] I need to go in life but listen it may
[1:25:13] be a giant in your way it may be all
[1:25:16] kinds of things that you can't do on
[1:25:18] your own but I'm here to tell you God
[1:25:20] has given you more than just a slingshot
[1:25:23] he has given you his whole arsenal
[1:25:26] he gave you a shield and he gave you a
[1:25:28] sword and he gave you a helmet and he
[1:25:31] gave you these things so that you could
[1:25:33] be the Overcomer of the layout of CN age
[1:25:35] and you don't have to live under the
[1:25:37] spirit of that age no more because
[1:25:39] you've been called out and you've been
[1:25:41] put into a bright age
[1:25:43] you say well I'm still living in
[1:25:45] laodicea me too but I'm not living under
[1:25:47] that Spirit the spirit is all around me
[1:25:50] but it ain't taking my house
[1:25:52] me and my house I will we will serve the
[1:25:57] Lord
[1:25:58] as for me in my house ain't no Devil's
[1:26:01] gonna stop us from going to church as
[1:26:03] for me and my house there ain't nobody
[1:26:05] gonna keep me out of the order of God
[1:26:08] nobody's going to keep me from being an
[1:26:10] overcomer in this day why I I tell you I
[1:26:12] didn't come up here just to stand up
[1:26:13] here and preach to this afternoon but I
[1:26:15] come to tell you this is a time of
[1:26:17] overcoming for the church
[1:26:19] to him that overcometh who's going to
[1:26:21] overcome if you want who will it's time
[1:26:24] we're them we are the Overcomers
[1:26:27] and we think about it and you can look
[1:26:29] at any part of the Bible and people had
[1:26:32] to overcome something
[1:26:33] everybody had to overcome something you
[1:26:36] think the children of Israel had it easy
[1:26:37] go read your Bible again
[1:26:39] you think that the three Hebrew children
[1:26:41] had it easy none of us have had it that
[1:26:44] bad
[1:26:45] go read it again
[1:26:46] you think that Daniel
[1:26:48] had it easy but he tried to pray
[1:26:51] no
[1:26:53] they're not threatening to throw you
[1:26:54] into lines then if you pray and we still
[1:26:56] don't do it right but Daniel did it in
[1:26:58] spite
[1:26:59] of what was coming he knew the penalty
[1:27:02] for prayer
[1:27:04] and he did it anyway
[1:27:07] we are not penalized for praying we're
[1:27:09] blessed for praying if anything it'll
[1:27:12] bring situations under control
[1:27:14] but what do we do what we decide just to
[1:27:17] get frantic and and well let's go post
[1:27:18] on Facebook and tell everybody about our
[1:27:20] problems instead of praying about it
[1:27:22] we might as well pray first if it don't
[1:27:26] work at least you try but if you pray
[1:27:29] believe him
[1:27:30] something will take place
[1:27:33] situations will change Mountains will
[1:27:36] move
[1:27:37] you say well it took 25 years for
[1:27:39] Abraham but they still happened
[1:27:42] he held on to the promises of God but
[1:27:43] remember he had to overcome doubt
[1:27:46] you say Abraham never doubted the
[1:27:48] promise you think Satan didn't try to
[1:27:50] get him to
[1:27:52] if Satan didn't talk to him he talked to
[1:27:54] Jesus
[1:27:55] Satan's talking to everybody
[1:27:58] Satan's talking to you right now saying
[1:28:00] well I'm not good enough to be an
[1:28:01] overcomer in this day Satan's telling
[1:28:03] you well my family I just can't seem to
[1:28:05] get him into the house of the Lord or
[1:28:07] well pray for him
[1:28:09] but you've got to live it in front of
[1:28:11] them and that's what I think church if I
[1:28:14] could get this to you
[1:28:16] we've got to live
[1:28:19] the word
[1:28:21] brother Branham said live a life so loud
[1:28:24] that I can't hear your testimony
[1:28:28] I want to live so loud
[1:28:30] that the world can't even hear what I'm
[1:28:32] saying because they'll know before I
[1:28:34] speak
[1:28:35] that that's what I'm doing that's what I
[1:28:36] want you say are you there yet I'm
[1:28:37] trying I'm pressing every day to be an
[1:28:40] overcomer
[1:28:42] I'm still in this flesh I'm still
[1:28:44] fighting every day I'm still young I've
[1:28:46] still got things I I've still gotta the
[1:28:48] message you say have you heard every
[1:28:50] tape no I haven't heard every tape
[1:28:52] I I've listened to every tape but I
[1:28:55] haven't heard every tape
[1:28:57] I've listened to every tape there is but
[1:28:59] I've never heard every I hear things all
[1:29:01] the time that I've never heard before
[1:29:03] and then God sends a Ministry
[1:29:06] and he starts showing you things in the
[1:29:08] message you're like I listened to that
[1:29:09] tape yesterday and never heard anything
[1:29:10] like that on it and he's opened it up to
[1:29:13] you you say well why why is that why
[1:29:16] can't I just hear the tapes and do it
[1:29:17] because it wasn't God's provided way he
[1:29:21] sent humans and you have to be able to
[1:29:23] look past the veil of Flesh to hear what
[1:29:25] they're saying because if you're sitting
[1:29:27] there looking at the flesh man there's
[1:29:29] no way you could accept it I I've known
[1:29:31] good men in this message and I talked to
[1:29:33] people who knew him when they were kids
[1:29:35] and they said well if you knew they
[1:29:36] weren't a kid they were a rascal now and
[1:29:38] they tell you what you know tell you hey
[1:29:40] if you knew them you that you wouldn't
[1:29:42] listen to them hey I'm not looking at
[1:29:43] what they were I'm not even looking at
[1:29:45] what they will be but I'm telling you if
[1:29:47] they bring in the word of God God is
[1:29:49] Anointed the man for a season and I'm
[1:29:51] here to tell you that what we're doing
[1:29:53] is bringing you the full counsel of God
[1:29:55] we're not here pulling no punches we're
[1:29:56] not here trying to tell you well well
[1:29:58] you're an overcomer you can do this you
[1:30:00] can do that you can do whatever you want
[1:30:01] to do you're going to overcome this day
[1:30:02] you're going to do whatever you want to
[1:30:03] do but I'm here to tell you somebody's
[1:30:06] gonna raise up that is going to overcome
[1:30:08] despite the hard things that come about
[1:30:11] you say well
[1:30:12] I can't I just can't seem to do it yeah
[1:30:16] but maybe you're trying on your own
[1:30:18] quit trying on your own
[1:30:21] and really realize there's someone more
[1:30:25] powerful than you
[1:30:27] there's someone greater than you a
[1:30:30] greater than Solomon is here to change
[1:30:32] the situation in your life a greater
[1:30:34] than any of the church age Messengers is
[1:30:36] here a greater than a prophet of God is
[1:30:38] standing here you say how can you get
[1:30:40] any greater than that Christ himself is
[1:30:42] on the Earth today
[1:30:44] living through a body of Believers
[1:30:45] remember church this is not just I don't
[1:30:48] mean to yell at you and scream at you
[1:30:49] but I'm here to tell you I think we just
[1:30:51] need to start living the message of the
[1:30:52] hour and overcome this world and the
[1:30:54] spirit of laodicea because there's going
[1:30:56] to be those spirits and remember
[1:30:58] there'll be some that will grow up so
[1:30:59] close he said it'll look like the same
[1:31:01] thing it'll look so close it'll deceive
[1:31:03] the elected if it were possible but
[1:31:05] remember it's not possible to you little
[1:31:07] elect and don't think just because
[1:31:09] you're a seed of God you can sit back
[1:31:10] and die on the ground no if you have the
[1:31:13] Life of Christ in you you will blossom
[1:31:15] into the word of God you will grow into
[1:31:17] what God said you would be you say well
[1:31:19] well I I just I'm a seed of God I can do
[1:31:22] what I want to if if God planted an
[1:31:25] apple tree it will produce apples
[1:31:27] if he planted an oak tree it will come
[1:31:30] up and be a beautiful big oak tree but
[1:31:32] listen to me if you say well well I'm
[1:31:34] I'm just not I'm maybe I'm not a seed of
[1:31:36] God well that's the devil talking to you
[1:31:38] be an overcomer quit listening to the
[1:31:41] lies of the devil and overcome those
[1:31:43] devils in this age overcome the spirit
[1:31:45] of Lao to see you you say why are you
[1:31:46] saying overcome because it seems in this
[1:31:48] age it's harder than ever to get people
[1:31:51] just to get past the little things and
[1:31:53] to overcome the little obstacles brother
[1:31:54] there's coming a time when you're going
[1:31:56] to need to put your faith in action
[1:31:57] there's coming a time when you're going
[1:31:59] to have to overcome something a little
[1:32:01] bigger than what you're overcoming now
[1:32:02] so God has allowed these little trials
[1:32:04] to come he's allowed little testings in
[1:32:06] your life if you can't overcome them
[1:32:08] how's he ever going to give you
[1:32:10] something bigger to overcome you say
[1:32:12] brother I just can't do it I can't do it
[1:32:14] on my own brother you can but I'm going
[1:32:16] to tell you you can through the blood of
[1:32:18] Jesus Christ
[1:32:19] you'll never do it on your own but here
[1:32:21] you are today sitting here not because
[1:32:23] you come out of fear if you're coming
[1:32:25] out of fear to go to church well I'm
[1:32:27] going to get preached at or yelled at or
[1:32:29] whatever well you might but let me go
[1:32:30] ahead and tell you it's not that's not
[1:32:32] if you didn't want to come you won't get
[1:32:34] yelled at this don't come at all you
[1:32:35] never get yelled at the end but but
[1:32:37] there's a reason you come yeah
[1:32:39] because there is something on the inside
[1:32:41] that wants you to be there
[1:32:44] is a desire planted in your heart that
[1:32:46] wants you to be there there's a desire
[1:32:48] in me that says I don't want to just be
[1:32:51] another Christian I don't want to just
[1:32:53] be another message believer but I want
[1:32:56] to live what the message says I don't
[1:32:58] want to just be in laodicea in the
[1:33:00] daughters of the world but I want to be
[1:33:02] called out to a higher age and you say
[1:33:04] brother there's another age yes there's
[1:33:06] another age we're living it
[1:33:08] we're living it in laodicea there's a
[1:33:11] someone that's called out and we're
[1:33:12] soaring like eagles Rising above it all
[1:33:15] Rising above everything that's down here
[1:33:17] and we look down and we see the world
[1:33:19] and we see the ashes and we we see all
[1:33:21] the we see all the the gay couples and
[1:33:24] and we see all the the man that don't
[1:33:25] know he's a man and the woman don't know
[1:33:27] she's a woman we see all those things
[1:33:28] brother we're called up higher than that
[1:33:30] we can look down at that and say that
[1:33:32] could have been me but for the grace of
[1:33:34] God he put something in my life he
[1:33:37] changed me from what I was I was just a
[1:33:39] backslidden message kid but he made me
[1:33:42] out of something you say brother Joel
[1:33:43] are you boasted no I'm boasted on God
[1:33:46] who can do it for you too it's not just
[1:33:48] for me it's not just for my house but
[1:33:51] it's for you as well
[1:33:53] every one of you can be an overcomer
[1:33:56] every one of you can be an overcomer
[1:33:59] let's stand to our feet as musicians
[1:34:01] come
[1:34:03] overcoming
[1:34:05] is something you have to do
[1:34:08] but quit looking at your own merits
[1:34:11] look to the word we've been given
[1:34:14] something to hold us in this day
[1:34:17] it's not something that's grabbed our
[1:34:19] attention
[1:34:20] but they're staying power in this
[1:34:22] message of the hour do you believe that
[1:34:23] today they're staying power in it
[1:34:25] something it'll keep you through
[1:34:27] laodicea something that'll keep you and
[1:34:30] have you ready for a Rapture in this day
[1:34:33] there's something here today I believe
[1:34:35] there's a spirit on the land today that
[1:34:37] is trying to get a bride gathered
[1:34:38] together for a Rapture you said that's
[1:34:41] gathered in one place no gathered under
[1:34:42] the word of God
[1:34:44] gathered under the word of God I believe
[1:34:46] they're here today I believe there's men
[1:34:47] on the Earth today traveling trying to
[1:34:49] tell you little Eagle get out of that
[1:34:51] barnyard you say well I've already come
[1:34:53] out of the nomination yeah but you went
[1:34:54] back you went down there and you
[1:34:56] denominated your own idea around the
[1:34:58] message get out of that chicken pen too
[1:35:00] and come over here where the word of God
[1:35:02] is moving among his people
[1:35:05] we put ourselves in a cage when we don't
[1:35:07] need to be in a cage
[1:35:09] but I'm free and I thank God I am free I
[1:35:13] thank God he brought me out of this way
[1:35:14] I was I thank God he gave me new life I
[1:35:18] thank God for the message of the hour
[1:35:19] because it didn't make me sit down and
[1:35:22] become another church member but he
[1:35:24] quickened my life to the gospel and he
[1:35:26] made it so I could live it
[1:35:28] we should be the happiest people on the
[1:35:30] face of the Earth that we can live what
[1:35:33] we believe
[1:35:34] it's not just a a I have to do it but
[1:35:37] it's I want to do it I want to live the
[1:35:40] way he wants me to live I want the power
[1:35:43] that he gives not my own power
[1:35:46] where is thy strength on Samson it was a
[1:35:49] power from the Lord and it came right
[1:35:50] back on him remember the power of the
[1:35:52] Samson had was nothing until the power
[1:35:55] of the Lord came in the room you can't
[1:35:57] overcome until the power of the Lord
[1:35:59] comes in the room but if you get down on
[1:36:01] your knees and invite him in one time I
[1:36:04] challenge you to do it and see if the
[1:36:06] power of the Holy Ghost don't come and
[1:36:07] change the situations in your life
[1:36:10] it's time we do it with our heads bowed
[1:36:12] as they play something
[1:36:14] I challenge you tonight
[1:36:17] when you get home with your children
[1:36:20] if you can show them this is how we pray
[1:36:23] through
[1:36:24] this is this is what we're supposed to
[1:36:26] be doing
[1:36:28] we don't just turn on
[1:36:30] turn on a movie and say here kids just
[1:36:32] just do this you say have you ever done
[1:36:33] that yeah yeah who's who's not guilty
[1:36:37] I've done things in my life I'm not
[1:36:38] proud of it but I'm here to tell you
[1:36:40] there's an overcoming power here if
[1:36:45] we'll accept it
[1:36:47] I want to be more like Jesus I want to
[1:36:50] live the way he wants me to live I want
[1:36:51] to overcome this evil age
[1:36:56] and it's not just I want to
[1:36:58] but I know I can
[1:37:00] I know I can overcome in this day
[1:37:03] because he's given the power he's not
[1:37:06] just given a power but authority to the
[1:37:08] church
[1:37:09] to overcome all things that Satan would
[1:37:11] throw at us in this day
[1:37:13] if there's one here today that that
[1:37:15] needs a touch from the Lord just raise
[1:37:17] your hand to him and tell him Lord
[1:37:19] I've grown cold in my walk
[1:37:22] our home life is has grown a little cold
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] We're still praying but there's just
[1:37:29] there's something about the spirits not
[1:37:30] moving like it should
[1:37:33] I'll raise my hand and say I need more
[1:37:35] in my life
[1:37:37] I need more in my life I need an
[1:37:39] overcoming power to come back in the
[1:37:41] home
[1:37:42] I can't make my kids overcome but I can
[1:37:44] set the example before him and show them
[1:37:46] what it means to overcome
[1:37:49] and that overcoming power that I can
[1:37:51] witness will work for my children
[1:37:54] and to my children's children and to
[1:37:57] them that are far off why because it's
[1:37:58] the same Holy Ghost
[1:38:00] same power that they had on the day of
[1:38:02] Pentecost
[1:38:03] if it changed them it'll change you
[1:38:06] with every head bowed and every eye I
[1:38:08] closed if there's a need just raise your
[1:38:09] hand
[1:38:10] if you could pray with me just now just
[1:38:12] ask the Lord to take us out of that cold
[1:38:14] situation the lukewarmness whatever it
[1:38:17] is in your life Lord I pray you would
[1:38:19] raise this church up out of that
[1:38:20] doldrums and conditions Lord bring us up
[1:38:22] higher today Lord I pray you would just
[1:38:25] move a mighty rushing wind across the
[1:38:27] audience now Lord Lord may we not leave
[1:38:29] the same people we came but may we
[1:38:31] recognize the overcoming power is
[1:38:33] already here and Lord may we just rise
[1:38:35] up through the newness of life in this
[1:38:37] age and we see Lord we are more than
[1:38:40] able to overcome not because of what we
[1:38:42] are but because the blood that covers Us
[1:38:44] Lord and Lord God when there's something
[1:38:46] wrong in our life I pray we quickly come
[1:38:49] back and repent quickly come to you Lord
[1:38:51] and may the Holy Spirit anoint something
[1:38:53] Lord to come up in his Lord and raise us
[1:38:56] to uh to a new life and a new way of
[1:38:58] living Lord I pray Lord we would be not
[1:39:00] be looked at the same but may the world
[1:39:02] look at us and say I see a Christian May

[1:39:12] who prays through I see somebody who
[1:39:15] goes to church and takes their children
[1:39:16] and shows them this is the way this is
[1:39:19] how we do it it's not just the form it's
[1:39:21] not a form of godliness but it is a true
