[34:25] jacob
[34:26] thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy
[34:28] people
[34:29] thou hast covered all their sin thou has
[34:32] taken away all thy wrath thou has turned
[34:34] thyself from the fierceness
[34:37] of thine anger couldn't we all say amen
[34:40] to that this morning
[34:41] are you glad to be saved this morning
[34:45] you've taken away the fierceness of
[34:47] thine anger

[34:55] will thou be angry with us forever wilt
[34:58] thou draw out thine anger to all

[35:02] verse 6 is what i want to draw my text
[35:05] from with thou not revive us

[35:10] thee
[35:11] for seven show us thy mercy o lord
[35:14] grant us thy salvation i will hear what
[35:18] god the lord will speak for he will
[35:20] speak peace unto his people
[35:22] and to his saints but let them not turn
[35:24] again to folly
[35:26] surely his salvation is nigh them that
[35:28] fear him
[35:30] that glory may dwell in our land glory
[35:33] made well in our land
[35:34] that is the glory speaking of is the
[35:36] shekinah presence of god
[35:39] glory may dwell in our land that's what
[35:41] we want this morning
[35:43] mercy and truth are met together
[35:45] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[35:47] other
[35:48] truth shall spring out of the earth and
[35:50] righteousness shall look down
[35:52] from heaven yeah the lord shall give
[35:55] that which is good
[35:57] and our land shall yield her increase
[36:00] righteousness shall go before him and
[36:02] shall set us in the way
[36:05] of his steps i pray the lord would add
[36:08] his blessing to the word you may be
[36:09] seated this morning
[36:14] what is revival the word in the hebrew
[36:18] that was used
[36:20] for revive us again is to live to have
[36:24] life to remain alive
[36:26] to sustain life to live prosperously
[36:29] to be quickened to be alive and to be
[36:31] restored
[36:32] to life or health if you think about
[36:35] revival as being in a state of
[36:38] life then it should not be
[36:41] the unnatural condition of the believer
[36:45] but it should be the natural condition
[36:49] of the believer it's the condition that
[36:52] we're most comfortable
[36:54] with and yet i get the feeling that
[36:57] in some places and i don't say here but
[37:00] maybe even with myself sometimes
[37:02] we get comfortable in a place with no
[37:05] revival
[37:06] we get comfortable without any stirring
[37:09] in our hearts and in our lives
[37:11] and it shouldn't be like that but it's
[37:13] just the age of the jt that we live in
[37:15] that makes us that way we get
[37:18] comfortable with that with just a
[37:20] continuing on as though we as as we
[37:22] always have and
[37:23] we trust the grace of god and but there
[37:26] has to be a
[37:27] a quickening or a life that comes to the
[37:30] word of god
[37:32] because otherwise we can't even do the
[37:34] word that he said we can't even
[37:36] follow what we know much less what we
[37:38] don't know
[37:39] much less what what we what we don't
[37:42] understand but what we do understand we
[37:44] can't follow it
[37:45] unless there's a life inside us to do it
[37:48] and there's got to be something with
[37:50] isaac that that takes hold on the inside
[37:52] that makes you
[37:54] live and makes you want god
[37:57] that there's such a desire there that
[37:59] you're willing to
[38:00] give up everything else for god you're
[38:03] willing to give everybo
[38:04] everything else away just to have him
[38:08] and brother branham taught us that to
[38:09] have him is to have life
[38:12] right and so that should be revival it
[38:15] should be
[38:16] the condition of god's people someone
[38:18] has defined revival as the people of god
[38:21] living in the power of an ungrieved and
[38:24] unquenched
[38:25] spirit the people of god living in the
[38:29] power of an ungrieved
[38:31] and unquenched spirit
[38:34] you see our flesh because of the nature
[38:36] of it it's always flesh
[38:38] it's always going to be that it's always
[38:40] going to be weak and
[38:42] we tend to grieve the spirit and so
[38:43] that's why paul says grieve not the
[38:46] spirit of god
[38:47] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[38:49] your redemption
[38:50] so it's not that you can lose your
[38:52] salvation but we tend to grieve the
[38:55] spirit
[38:56] it's just something that as human beings
[38:59] we tend to do
[39:00] and we have to watch that we also tend
[39:02] to quench
[39:03] the spirit because sometimes the spirit
[39:06] of god wants us to do or to say
[39:08] or to move or to sing or to preach or
[39:11] certain things or to say certain things
[39:13] or
[39:13] to be active in a certain way and we
[39:15] hold back
[39:17] and paul tells us quench not the spirit
[39:20] because you know it shouldn't matter
[39:23] who's looking at us
[39:24] it shouldn't matter who sits in the pew
[39:26] beside us
[39:28] we should be able to worship god we
[39:30] should be able to seek
[39:32] god we should we should have complete
[39:35] comfort
[39:36] if we have a need of coming and seeking
[39:39] for god's
[39:40] help we shouldn't be scared of the altar
[39:44] right we shouldn't be scared of the
[39:46] house of god
[39:47] we shouldn't be uncomfortable with with
[39:50] getting down and really getting down to
[39:52] business with god
[39:56] when we are we quench the spirit of god
[39:59] brother branham defines revival he says
[40:01] when you see these crowds gathering
[40:03] he said that doesn't mean revival he
[40:05] said that's just a gathering
[40:07] but a revival is when people get really
[40:09] right with god
[40:11] and pray through and starts the revival
[40:14] throughout the city and everything
[40:16] he said you see they put away sin put
[40:19] away their iniquity
[40:21] well that's what i want to see they put
[40:23] away sin to put away their iniquity
[40:25] what's iniquity when you know something
[40:27] is wrong
[40:28] and you do it anyway it's iniquity
[40:32] he said they put it away and then turn
[40:34] to god turn around and start back again
[40:37] the road and i don't want you to take
[40:40] this this morning as though i'm
[40:41] preaching at you or trying to
[40:43] trying to make you feel bad that's not
[40:45] what i'm doing i want to stir up our
[40:47] faith
[40:48] to believe that it's possible that we
[40:50] individually could be in a state of
[40:52] revival
[40:53] that we could seek god and he would
[40:56] answer our prayers and that
[40:57] we could see him move in a supernatural
[40:59] way that we could see him
[41:01] working in our lives as i believe you've
[41:03] seen him in the past
[41:04] but right now we need god to move
[41:10] so now and to get desperate for that and
[41:13] that's so that's the purpose this
[41:14] morning now
[41:16] brother brown says the revival to my
[41:17] opinion doesn't consist of bringing in
[41:19] new
[41:20] members revival doesn't consist of a
[41:22] bunch of
[41:23] conversions although those things go
[41:25] along with the revival
[41:27] but a revival is to revive what you've
[41:29] already got
[41:30] just to get them revived again
[41:34] in in another sermon he said now notice
[41:36] now the church doesn't need a polishing
[41:39] it doesn't need a face lifting it needs
[41:41] a birth
[41:43] and i think what brother branham is
[41:45] saying there is
[41:47] is that there's something that we need
[41:50] beyond just appearances
[41:53] you know we get embarrassed we want to
[41:55] look better
[41:57] but that's not what we need we need
[42:00] revival
[42:02] it don't need a face lifting it needs a
[42:03] birth it needs a conversion something's
[42:06] got to happen
[42:07] not just to strengthen our borders not
[42:08] to bring in new members
[42:10] revival is not getting new members a
[42:12] revival is to revive what we got he said
[42:14] that's what we so badly need
[42:18] he said not long ago in chicago i was
[42:19] standing out by the great famous lake
[42:21] michigan
[42:22] and i noticed how those waves were
[42:24] leaping and jumping
[42:25] and i thought oh my the lake's got a
[42:27] revival today
[42:29] he said i stood there and someone was
[42:31] standing with me and they said pardon me
[42:32] brother branham
[42:33] i said the lake has a revival why he
[42:35] said what do you mean by revival
[42:36] i said look how it's leaping and jumping
[42:38] pounding its waves
[42:39] back and forth dashing against each
[42:41] other just frolicking he said well what
[42:43] do you mean a revival i said it's having
[42:45] a rejoicing time
[42:47] i said but remember there's not one more
[42:48] drop of water in it and it's jumping as
[42:50] it is when it's quiet
[42:52] he said now our jumping and shouting and
[42:54] praising god is wonderful
[42:56] if we can still have the same amount of
[42:57] water when we come down to earth again
[43:00] he said the church is not built upon
[43:02] rejoicing and upon bubble dancing
[43:04] but it's built upon the baptism of the
[43:06] holy spirit
[43:07] the love of god and
[43:10] he said well you say what good does the
[43:12] revival do then he said if you notice
[43:14] every time the sea has a revival or the
[43:16] lake
[43:17] it just turns back and forth is to knock
[43:20] all the trash
[43:21] out of it after you get the revival over
[43:24] the trash is laying on the bank
[43:26] it cleans itself in a revival he said
[43:29] and god knows the church or the living
[43:31] god needs a revival
[43:33] for a lot of its nonsense needs to be
[43:35] churned out of it
[43:38] you say well well brother ben who are
[43:40] you talking about i'm talking about me
[43:44] because you pick up nonsense i pick up
[43:46] nonsense as we travel through life
[43:48] that's why we
[43:48] we have communion and and peter told
[43:52] jesus told peter peter said wash all of
[43:54] me and jesus said he that is washed
[43:56] needeth not
[43:57] safe to wash his feet and the reason is
[43:59] because he walks through life
[44:02] his feet get dirty on a walk through
[44:05] life
[44:06] we need to wash ourselves in the water
[44:08] of the word
[44:09] we need to stand in the water of the
[44:10] word to be washed and so
[44:12] that that it's a revivalist when the
[44:14] lake churns the nonsense comes out he
[44:16] said what makes the revival what makes
[44:18] the lake churn
[44:19] he said it's because there's a wind
[44:21] comes he said that's right the wind
[44:23] comes down from heaven and gives it a
[44:24] revival
[44:26] that's what makes the church when a
[44:28] rushing mighty wind come down from
[44:29] heaven one day
[44:30] a pentecostal revival broke out he said
[44:34] that's what we need today is another
[44:36] rushing mighty wind on the pentecostal
[44:38] church
[44:39] to get the little isms and little
[44:41] differences out of it
[44:42] so the love of god can have the right of
[44:44] way throw all the trash out on the banks
[44:47] and clean her out
[44:48] and let's get started again but doesn't
[44:50] that sound like a good place to be in
[44:52] throw all the trash out on the banks
[44:54] let's get started again
[44:59] and and there's a question today because
[45:00] it's almost become
[45:02] message dogma that we can't have revival
[45:05] and and so the question is should we
[45:07] look for revival
[45:09] well if you define revival as being in a
[45:11] state of life
[45:13] if we don't have revival we don't have
[45:14] life
[45:17] so there has to be revival but there's
[45:18] certain things we don't look for
[45:21] and there's certain things we do now
[45:23] brother brown says now remember
[45:24] correctly he said each generation
[45:26] he said that's why each generation has
[45:28] its own revival
[45:30] its own revival and that's why you
[45:33] usually see revival break out among
[45:35] young people
[45:37] right because young people tend to their
[45:40] generation hasn't had that revival yet
[45:41] and so
[45:42] you look back through any revival in
[45:44] history it usually breaks out first
[45:45] among young people
[45:47] young people even children but but now
[45:51] look
[45:51] look at the age that we live in i i'm
[45:54] concerned that there's
[45:55] people that are elders that have not yet
[45:58] experienced revival
[46:02] i'm afraid that we've got people in
[46:03] message churches and you just bear with
[46:05] me
[46:06] that have never experienced revival
[46:08] because how could you experience revival
[46:11] and cross the word with impunity how
[46:14] could you ever do that
[46:16] you you can't just walk across the word
[46:18] and say i'm in revival doesn't matter
[46:19] how much you shout or dance or anything
[46:21] else
[46:21] you couldn't do it right and so
[46:24] no matter how well you could preach no
[46:26] matter how well you could sing no matter
[46:27] how well you could
[46:28] you could do anything else how many
[46:30] times you paid or whatever
[46:31] if you can cross the word of god with
[46:33] impunity you just walk across and say
[46:35] well it doesn't apply to my situation
[46:37] then you're not in revival so i think
[46:40] every one of us needs to look for
[46:41] revival
[46:42] every one of us needs to get in a place
[46:44] where we where we know what it's like to
[46:46] be in the presence of god
[46:48] where we know what it's like to be
[46:49] convicted by sin when the preaching goes
[46:51] forth that our heart is tender
[46:54] not hardened and not not been seared
[46:57] with a hot iron
[46:58] that our conscious can can convict us
[47:01] and the holy spirit can move in our
[47:03] lives and
[47:04] tears can flow down our cheeks every one
[47:06] of us needs to be in that place
[47:10] we don't have it we don't have life so
[47:12] brother branham says each generation has
[47:14] its own revival it gets a chance
[47:16] at the word it gets a chance at the word
[47:20] god is faithful i hope you hear me this
[47:23] morning
[47:24] god is faithful but jt to give us a
[47:26] chance at the word
[47:28] he gives us an opportunity to hear he
[47:31] gives us an opportunity to believe
[47:33] an opportunity but he won't dwell with
[47:35] us he won't deal with us
[47:36] forever i've seen people pass
[47:40] opportunity after opportunity
[47:42] you don't know when the last opportunity
[47:44] will come
[47:45] you don't know that this won't be the
[47:46] last service you'll ever be in if you're
[47:48] streaming this morning you don't know
[47:50] that it won't be the last time you'll
[47:51] ever watch a service on the internet
[47:54] and it could be because that you don't
[47:56] make it i preach to people at their last
[47:58] moments in life
[48:00] their last service young people i've
[48:04] been there i've done that i preached the
[48:05] last
[48:06] sermon i know what that's like but it
[48:08] wouldn't
[48:09] necessarily mean that you lost your life
[48:12] but it could be you never want to again
[48:17] you might walk away from the service
[48:19] today and never want to be in the house
[48:21] of god again
[48:23] he said well that wouldn't be me don't
[48:26] pass up
[48:27] your chance at the word
[48:30] every generation gets its own chance at
[48:32] the word he said then they hybrid it
[48:34] instead of taking on they go somewhere
[48:36] else
[48:36] they make a denomination out of it and a
[48:38] new generation has to rise up
[48:41] see there's a revival going on the
[48:44] bride's revival
[48:46] but you got to take your opportunity
[48:49] you've got to participate in it
[48:54] it's one thing to know the revival is
[48:55] going on it's another thing to
[48:56] participate in the revival
[49:01] and it's it's difficult because of the
[49:02] time that we live in but you've got to
[49:04] participate in it now
[49:06] brother branham talks about revivals he
[49:08] said that's the reason today in the
[49:09] third seal the revivals that we're
[49:10] supposed to have
[49:11] he said we have denominational revivals
[49:13] we haven't had a real stirring
[49:15] he said don't think we've got revivals
[49:16] we haven't oh they've got millions and
[49:18] millions and
[49:19] millions of church members but not a
[49:20] revival nowhere
[49:22] and he says the bride hasn't had a
[49:23] revival yet see there's been no revival
[49:25] there no manifestation of god to stir
[49:27] the bride
[49:28] yet he said we're looking for it now
[49:30] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[49:31] back there to wake her up again
[49:33] yeah he'll send it he promised it
[49:37] now what did we talk about a few weeks
[49:40] ago those seven unknown thunders
[49:41] what happened he told us what they were
[49:45] we have a revelation of that we claim to
[49:48] that a mighty angel came down and opened
[49:51] a book
[49:52] revelation 10. there's an open book it
[49:54] means the seals
[49:56] have been taken off the book the book is
[49:58] open the seals are off
[50:01] right so if the seals have been taken
[50:03] off the book
[50:04] then we ought to be in the bride's
[50:05] revival
[50:09] and that's where people miss it is they
[50:10] don't see what's happened so brother
[50:12] brown says
[50:12] it'll take those thunders and then in
[50:14] recognizing your day and it's message
[50:16] what an appropriate title
[50:18] he said everywhere now there's no
[50:19] revival everybody is complaining
[50:21] ministers crying
[50:23] he said i was reading one of the
[50:24] outstanding papers that comes here to
[50:25] the church a very fine paper i know the
[50:27] editor
[50:27] i know the people they're godly people
[50:29] very fine brother and sister more of the
[50:31] herald of his coming
[50:32] he said one of the finest papers on the
[50:34] field but they will hardly
[50:36] print anything unless it's about fast
[50:38] pray fast pray sound a trumpet
[50:40] he said how many reasons you know you
[50:41] see it all the time fast pray it's all
[50:43] you hear we're going to have a great
[50:44] breaking of the day
[50:45] there's a great thing going to happen
[50:47] they're still doing that today
[50:49] in charismatic circles in pentecostal
[50:51] circles still looking for that revival
[50:53] he said they're crying there he said why
[50:55] do they do that
[50:56] he said why do they do that they want a
[50:58] great awakening they're crying believing
[50:59] that there will be awakening
[51:01] they're good people why is it what have
[51:02] they done they've not recognized the
[51:04] awakening of the bride
[51:07] by being a christian now listen they
[51:09] feel the pull of the hour
[51:12] well maybe that's why people that are
[51:13] supposed to be in the bride's revival
[51:15] don't ever get awakened
[51:17] maybe they're not a christian you got to
[51:20] start somewhere
[51:22] i'm again i'm not preaching at you i
[51:24] want to stir us up
[51:26] you understand that by being a christian
[51:29] these people at least feel the pull of
[51:31] the hour but they haven't recognized
[51:32] what's been done
[51:34] he said that's what's making them feel
[51:36] that way they know something is supposed
[51:38] to happen but see they're looking for it
[51:40] way off in the future to come when it's
[51:42] already happened right by you
[51:45] and they still can't see it today still
[51:48] can't see that it's come
[51:53] but we know there will be no more great
[51:54] sweeping revivals
[51:57] but there is a revival for our day and
[51:58] we must participate in that now
[52:01] brother branham explains that well in
[52:02] the message thirst in 1965 and i'll
[52:05] i'll go into that but i'm talking today
[52:08] about
[52:08] individuals in the bride being in
[52:11] revival
[52:14] and then i think we could expand that to
[52:15] our local church
[52:17] our church can be in revival
[52:21] now as an individual that can be the
[52:22] state you live in
[52:24] as a church it comes and goes
[52:27] right because you have all kinds of
[52:29] people in a church
[52:30] and all the people are affected by the
[52:32] revival by the spirit of god
[52:34] but not all have the revival in them
[52:37] but what we're talking about is a
[52:38] revival
[52:40] and see the spirit of god is just as
[52:42] powerful as it ever was
[52:43] how many believe that today just as
[52:46] powerful as it ever was
[52:47] what's the difference it don't affect
[52:50] people like it used to
[52:54] that's what the difference is that's why
[52:55] people could continue to live in sin
[52:57] that's why people can continue to to
[52:59] preach or whatever else and continue to
[53:00] live in sin that's why they can continue
[53:02] to go on the way that they're going and
[53:03] never even think about god and we talked
[53:05] about last night and talking to some of
[53:07] the young men and we're talking about
[53:08] how that
[53:09] people even become atheists raised in
[53:11] the message and grow up and realize they
[53:12] don't even believe in god
[53:14] why they've never been in revival
[53:17] they've never
[53:17] they've never understood that they've
[53:19] never been in that place they never
[53:20] participated in the bride's revival
[53:23] and so the bible says you call for
[53:24] revivals you wait for your church to
[53:26] have a revival
[53:27] he said well that ain't the revival for
[53:29] you
[53:31] well if we could have a church revival
[53:33] if we could have a great preacher and if
[53:34] we could do something no
[53:36] that ain't the revival for you he said
[53:38] the revival ought to begin right in you
[53:41] when you begin to thirst for god
[53:45] is there something still there that's
[53:46] what i'm appealing to today
[53:48] is there something inside of you i know
[53:50] there's coronavirus going on
[53:52] i know there's sickness everywhere i
[53:54] know there's trouble everywhere i know
[53:55] it's hard to even get
[53:56] half a church full anymore i know what
[53:59] the world's like but is there something
[54:01] inside of you
[54:01] if there's a deep calling then there's a
[54:03] deep to respond
[54:05] and if there's something inside of you
[54:07] that cries out the lord i don't want to
[54:09] remain in this condition
[54:10] i don't want to stay in this dryness i
[54:12] don't want to remain without revival
[54:14] then there's got to be something to
[54:15] respond to that
[54:17] if god would put something in my heart
[54:19] and a cry in my heart to cry out for
[54:21] that then there's got to be somewhere in
[54:23] god's
[54:24] in his in his heavens there's got to be
[54:25] a storehouse somewhere that there could
[54:27] be a revival that could pour out on us
[54:32] there's got to be a place somewhere
[54:34] where there consists of revival
[54:36] that we can be a part of and it won't
[54:39] it won't consist of us traveling around
[54:41] looking for revival
[54:43] but it'll start right here
[54:47] and he says the revival ought to begin
[54:48] right in you when you begin to thirst
[54:50] for god
[54:51] he said there might not be another
[54:53] member of the church wanting that
[54:54] revival
[54:55] but if it breaks out in you it'll break
[54:57] out in other places
[54:59] he said but see you neglect that thirst
[55:02] oh listen
[55:02] here's what we were talking about last
[55:04] night and i was so
[55:06] impressed to sit and talk with a couple
[55:07] of the brothers about
[55:09] the word sit and talk about the word
[55:13] me and brother joel fellowship around
[55:14] the word often
[55:16] and that's what's in my heart it's what
[55:17] i longed to do i like to fellowship with
[55:20] you about other things but i want to
[55:21] fellowship with you about the word
[55:23] because there's something about it when
[55:24] you begin to see a desire for the word
[55:26] and you're talking about it there's
[55:28] something about it you just feel like oh
[55:30] oh we we we want to be right we want to
[55:33] make sure
[55:34] and so that you're talking about the
[55:35] word when you begin to talk about him he
[55:37] comes around
[55:39] and so brother brown says you neglect to
[55:41] milk the cow
[55:42] when the cow when the other is full of
[55:43] milk and if you let that cow stay like
[55:45] that she'll go dry
[55:47] he said that's exactly right he said if
[55:49] you neglect to take a drink of water
[55:51] say i just ain't going to drink no more
[55:53] you'll die
[55:55] you neglect to eat food you'll die now
[55:59] we have spiritual food in due season
[56:00] don't we
[56:02] we have we have the scripture we have
[56:04] the message of the hour
[56:06] we have food what a shame it would be
[56:10] for people to starve with all the food
[56:12] we have
[56:14] what an embarrassment it would be what a
[56:17] hard thing it is to see people starving
[56:19] on the pew when there's a storehouse
[56:20] when there's food
[56:21] all you have to do is reach out and grab
[56:23] a hold of it all you got to do is pray
[56:25] and ask god reveal it to me
[56:27] and it's there for you
[56:30] there's food available but you say i
[56:33] just i don't want to eat
[56:36] and remember i'm not preaching at you
[56:37] but when i say these things it's what
[56:39] people say
[56:41] but if the shoe fits we need to wear it
[56:46] if you neglect to eat food you'll die he
[56:49] said so if you neglect to give the holy
[56:51] spirit the word of god
[56:52] you'll die
[56:57] he said you christians you baptist
[56:58] methodist presbyterians pentecostals
[57:00] assemblies of god oneness tunis
[57:02] threeness
[57:02] whatever you are he said see don't care
[57:07] he said that don't matter nothing to me
[57:08] he said i don't think it does to god
[57:10] see you're an individual you're you're a
[57:12] unit you're an individual you'll never
[57:15] go to heaven as a church or a
[57:16] denomination
[57:17] you go to heaven as one single person
[57:19] between you and god
[57:21] he said that's all he said i don't care
[57:22] what church you belong to we put way too
[57:24] much emphasis on what church you go to
[57:27] but he said i don't care what church you
[57:29] belong to
[57:30] he said if you neglect to read the bible
[57:33] and to believe the bible
[57:35] and the holy spirit to feed upon that
[57:37] you will die
[57:40] now brother branham says how do you get
[57:42] closer to god
[57:44] read your bible and pray do you know
[57:46] that's the hardest thing you can do in
[57:47] your life
[57:49] just to have the time to do that and
[57:51] some of you retired people could say
[57:52] amen to that
[57:54] because you know you get retired you
[57:56] think well now i'll have time
[57:58] not working but you'll find other things
[57:59] to fill your time
[58:01] because that's just the nature of it
[58:03] it's just the way things are
[58:05] the satan will come in and try to
[58:07] distract you with everything that he can
[58:08] distract you with
[58:10] i tell you what i love my phone i like
[58:13] having it i like to be
[58:14] able to communicate but it hinders
[58:15] revival
[58:17] it absolutely does i love all the
[58:20] technology that we have but they had
[58:22] more revival back when we didn't have it
[58:25] are you with me now i'm not
[58:26] anti-technology but we got to think
[58:28] about what these things do to us
[58:30] sometimes it starts us with a storehouse
[58:32] full of food
[58:34] if you neglect to read the bible and to
[58:35] believe the bible and the holy spirit to
[58:37] feed upon that you will die
[58:38] jesus said in saint john 4 3 he said
[58:41] jesus said the man shall not live by
[58:42] bread alone but by
[58:43] every word not just part of it
[58:47] i want to talk to you this morning about
[58:50] the effects of revival
[58:52] what does the revival do well in psalms
[58:56] 85 11 in the scripture that we read it
[58:58] says truth shall spring out of the earth
[59:00] he said if you revive us this is what
[59:02] will happen
[59:04] truth will spring out of the earth and
[59:06] righteousness shall look down
[59:08] from heaven in every real revival
[59:11] there's a return to the word
[59:14] and with that is a return to holiness
[59:16] and by holiness i don't mean long
[59:18] sleeves and long dresses
[59:20] but i mean a lifestyle that's pleasing
[59:22] to god
[59:25] in every real revival there's a return
[59:28] to holiness
[59:29] when revival comes to your heart as
[59:30] brother branham says it gets rid of the
[59:32] nonsense
[59:33] it sweeps away the nonsense it makes you
[59:35] clean up
[59:37] when the wesleyan revival come to
[59:39] england
[59:40] at the beginning of the 18th century
[59:43] before john wesley was born
[59:45] england was in a moral quagmire a
[59:48] spiritual cesspool
[59:50] and they've gone back to that condition
[59:52] today
[59:54] but before that revival there was a man
[59:57] named thomas carlisle to describe the
[59:58] country's condition as stomach
[1:00:00] well alive soul extinct
[1:00:04] it's a vivid way of saying that they had
[1:00:07] a passion for everything but the word
[1:00:10] a passion for everything but the holy
[1:00:11] spirit a passion for everything but god
[1:00:14] deism was rampant deism
[1:00:18] basically which is it doesn't matter
[1:00:20] god's there but he doesn't care
[1:00:23] a bland philosophical morality was
[1:00:26] standard fare in the churches
[1:00:28] sir william blackstone visited visited
[1:00:31] the church of every major clergyman in
[1:00:32] london
[1:00:33] but he said he did not hear a single
[1:00:35] discourse not a single sermon which had
[1:00:38] more christianity in it
[1:00:39] than the writings of cicero
[1:00:43] he said in most sermons he heard it
[1:00:44] would have been impossible to tell
[1:00:46] just from listening whether the preacher
[1:00:48] was a follower of confucius
[1:00:50] muhammad or christ i wish he could see
[1:00:54] us today
[1:00:56] look at america today it's the same way
[1:01:00] morally the country was becoming
[1:01:02] increasingly decadent
[1:01:04] drunkenness was rampant look at the
[1:01:06] numbers go
[1:01:07] i challenge you go look at the numbers
[1:01:09] on drunkenness and on how much people
[1:01:11] are drinking since this epidemic started
[1:01:14] they're drowning their fears drunkenness
[1:01:17] was rampant
[1:01:18] gambling was so extensive that one
[1:01:20] historian describes england as one vast
[1:01:22] casino
[1:01:24] almost like going to oklahoma
[1:01:29] one vast casino newborns were exposed in
[1:01:33] the streets
[1:01:35] it sounds like today don't it 97
[1:01:39] of the infant poor went to work houses
[1:01:42] and died as children
[1:01:44] 97
[1:01:47] bear baiting and fighting were
[1:01:49] accepted sports tickets were sold
[1:01:52] to public executions like a theater
[1:01:55] the slave trade was rampant brought
[1:01:57] material gained to many
[1:01:58] while degrading their souls
[1:02:02] a man named bishop berkeley wrote that
[1:02:04] morality in religion in britain had
[1:02:05] collapsed to a degree that was never
[1:02:07] known
[1:02:08] in any christian country
[1:02:12] but now all of a sudden something
[1:02:14] happened
[1:02:15] a revival was coming amen
[1:02:19] revival came and when john wesley began
[1:02:22] to preach
[1:02:24] in the fields and the revival began to
[1:02:26] start
[1:02:27] it touched every class of society
[1:02:31] england was transformed by the revival
[1:02:33] i'm showing you the effects of it and we
[1:02:35] know
[1:02:35] that this country won't have a revival
[1:02:37] like that they turned down their last
[1:02:38] revival
[1:02:40] they turned down their chance at the
[1:02:41] word but listen we can have it
[1:02:46] we can have it right here we know the
[1:02:48] country won't have it but we can have it
[1:02:51] amen why we're alive we're supposed to
[1:02:54] be alive
[1:02:57] listen the revival cut across
[1:02:59] denominational lines touched every class
[1:03:01] of society
[1:03:02] england was transformed a man named
[1:03:04] davidson wrote that wesley
[1:03:06] practically changed the outlook and even
[1:03:07] the character of the english nation
[1:03:10] until right after he died they actually
[1:03:12] abolished the slave trade
[1:03:15] and he was instrumental in that it so
[1:03:18] altered the course of english history
[1:03:19] england was headed for a revolution just
[1:03:21] like france
[1:03:22] becoming a godless society like they
[1:03:24] were but the revolution
[1:03:26] changed the nation and even the politics
[1:03:29] today
[1:03:30] they recognize historians recognize that
[1:03:32] it was affected
[1:03:33] why because of the revival that took
[1:03:35] place and i've told you before
[1:03:37] that when the revival when the western
[1:03:38] revival would sweep through a town
[1:03:40] all the bars would close because the
[1:03:44] spirit of god was so rampant among the
[1:03:46] people
[1:03:47] that they didn't do what they used to do
[1:03:48] anymore people were changed
[1:03:51] that's revival revival brings joy
[1:03:55] there's a rare thing in our day at age
[1:03:59] psalms 85 and 6 which we read said will
[1:04:01] thou not revive us again
[1:04:03] that thy people may rejoice in thee
[1:04:07] when david was backslidden in his
[1:04:09] backseating condition he said restore
[1:04:11] unto me the joy
[1:04:12] of thy salvation not thy salvation you
[1:04:15] can't lose salvation but the joy of thy
[1:04:17] salvation
[1:04:19] uphold me with thy free spirit
[1:04:22] now spurgeon said it this way he said
[1:04:25] joy in the lord is the ripest fruit of
[1:04:27] all grace
[1:04:28] all revivals and renewals lead up to it
[1:04:31] by our possession of it we may estimate
[1:04:33] our spiritual condition
[1:04:35] it is a sure gauge of inward prosperity
[1:04:39] he said a genuine revival without joy in
[1:04:41] the lord
[1:04:42] is as impossible as spring without
[1:04:44] flowers
[1:04:46] or day dawn without light
[1:04:49] revival brings joy brother branham ties
[1:04:52] revival to joy and i know some of you
[1:04:54] are thinking of this quote as i'm
[1:04:55] reading this but see if you're looking
[1:04:58] for a sweeping revival
[1:05:00] to bring joy it's not going to happen
[1:05:04] if you're looking for trump to get saved
[1:05:06] he may but if you're looking for him to
[1:05:08] be born again and all the
[1:05:09] all the senate in the house and
[1:05:11] everybody to stop abortions and
[1:05:12] and stop all the nonsense and stop
[1:05:14] everything else do you realize why
[1:05:15] abortion is such an issue today
[1:05:18] because the the country is so morally
[1:05:20] bankrupt
[1:05:21] that's why abortion is the issue it is
[1:05:24] look at the number of
[1:05:25] of sexually transmitted diseases and all
[1:05:27] the things going on in the country right
[1:05:28] now
[1:05:29] the reason is because the people are
[1:05:31] immoral that's why there's so many
[1:05:33] abortions
[1:05:34] if you cut out the immorality you
[1:05:35] wouldn't you just cut out the immorality
[1:05:37] in the churches
[1:05:39] you would have a lot less abortion but
[1:05:41] abortion becomes the issue because it's
[1:05:43] the only thing left that they stand for
[1:05:46] god help us that we wouldn't be that way
[1:05:48] but if you're looking for revival to
[1:05:50] come because a
[1:05:51] million people are going to get together
[1:05:53] and we're all going to have a revival
[1:05:54] it's going to cross the land across the
[1:05:56] drama it won't do it
[1:05:58] because they turned down their revival
[1:06:00] america did in 1956
[1:06:02] they've turned it down and you know
[1:06:06] we look at the republican party someone
[1:06:09] said that
[1:06:10] someone said that the democrats republi
[1:06:14] the
[1:06:14] america is like a corpse and and
[1:06:17] democrats
[1:06:18] are fighting to do away with the corpse
[1:06:20] and republicans are fighting to keep it
[1:06:24] but it's still a corpse america
[1:06:28] is is dying on the vine i didn't say
[1:06:31] that a prophet
[1:06:32] said that big sweeping revivals it won't
[1:06:36] happen that won't bring you joy you're
[1:06:37] not going to find joy on fox news
[1:06:41] you might end up being like some of them
[1:06:43] other support supporters of the other
[1:06:44] candidate were
[1:06:45] four years ago if that's where you take
[1:06:49] your joy you might end up weeping
[1:06:52] but there's joy in the presence of the
[1:06:53] angels when a sinner repents
[1:06:57] there's joy in the hearts of the people
[1:06:58] of god but look brother brother said
[1:07:00] there can't be no organization left
[1:07:02] neither can
[1:07:02] there be any further advancement than
[1:07:04] what's going right now
[1:07:06] do people understand that do they get
[1:07:08] that but the brahmana says it very
[1:07:09] plainly
[1:07:10] but people are still looking for
[1:07:11] something he said there can't be any
[1:07:12] further advancement
[1:07:13] what does that mean no further this is
[1:07:15] our chance that the word
[1:07:17] it's the word that's already come
[1:07:18] there's not going to be some new
[1:07:18] revelation that's going to make us right
[1:07:20] with god
[1:07:22] this is it
[1:07:25] no more big sweeping revivals this
[1:07:27] nation never receive it
[1:07:30] the revival he said is over across the
[1:07:32] nation there ain't going to be no
[1:07:32] revival speak sweeping revivals this
[1:07:34] nation never receive it you might have
[1:07:36] an intellectual gathering
[1:07:37] but i mean a spiritual revival we've
[1:07:39] seen all of it
[1:07:41] he said i hope you're catching it i'm
[1:07:42] saying in such a way that i hope you get
[1:07:44] it
[1:07:44] see he said it's over a fine minister
[1:07:45] said a while ago brother branham if i
[1:07:47] could just have the joy of the lord in
[1:07:48] my heart
[1:07:50] i said son the revival is over and so
[1:07:53] brother branham ties it to that
[1:07:55] but it doesn't mean you can't have joy
[1:07:56] because we know that joy is the fruit of
[1:07:58] the spirit
[1:08:01] why couldn't he feel joy there's no
[1:08:02] sweeping revival
[1:08:05] how does revival start
[1:08:11] i believe it can start right here
[1:08:15] brother branham talks a lot you can go
[1:08:16] and read it about the welsh revival and
[1:08:18] i want to deal with that some this
[1:08:19] morning
[1:08:20] as we go along now brother branham says
[1:08:23] so in the welsh revival one of our late
[1:08:25] revivals before our pentecostal no one
[1:08:27] knew what started the revival just a
[1:08:28] bunch of people
[1:08:32] and i'll go into a little bit of that
[1:08:34] later but some of it was just young
[1:08:35] people in one
[1:08:36] in one place the revival broke out just
[1:08:38] because a young lady was 16 years old
[1:08:40] stood up and said i believe the lord
[1:08:42] jesus saved my soul or something like
[1:08:44] that
[1:08:44] that's all she said revival broke out
[1:08:47] why it was time for revival brother
[1:08:50] branham calls it a jubilee time
[1:08:52] it was their jubilee time in wales so it
[1:08:55] was time for revival and the revival
[1:08:56] broke out
[1:08:58] and so brother branham talks about he
[1:09:01] said no one knew what started the
[1:09:02] revival he said now when we get all our
[1:09:03] friend billy graham
[1:09:04] we get all the presbyterians and the
[1:09:06] lutherans and pentecostals and
[1:09:07] everything together
[1:09:08] and go into the city and there they'll
[1:09:09] have a great gathering together of
[1:09:11] thousands
[1:09:12] he said thirty thousand will come in two
[1:09:13] weeks and give their hearts to christ
[1:09:15] go back another two weeks you ain't got
[1:09:16] one he said see that's the mechanics
[1:09:20] he said but let god in his sovereign
[1:09:22] grace
[1:09:23] just speak to some little nitwit
[1:09:27] i wonder if we can say lord i'll be the
[1:09:29] nitwit that you speak through
[1:09:32] let me be the nitwit that you speak
[1:09:34] through
[1:09:35] my church needs revival my family needs
[1:09:37] revival
[1:09:38] my this this area needs revival lord let
[1:09:41] me be the knit with
[1:09:42] if there's going to be one let me be
[1:09:43] that one
[1:09:45] some little knit where he said that god
[1:09:47] can speak to a little nobody
[1:09:49] let his spirit fall into the city and
[1:09:51] men can't go to work
[1:09:53] women can't wash dishes the maid can't
[1:09:55] make the bed screaming and crying with
[1:09:56] their hands up in the air he said that's
[1:09:58] revival
[1:09:59] that's in the will of god
[1:10:03] he's oh that used to happen but not
[1:10:05] anymore what are we church of christ
[1:10:09] preaches cessation doctrine that's
[1:10:12] revival it's in the will of god
[1:10:15] i i said i wanted to stir you up i feel
[1:10:17] like i'm just
[1:10:18] i'm just hammering it today but you bear
[1:10:20] with me
[1:10:22] it was said that some noblemen from the
[1:10:24] church went over
[1:10:26] to wales to understand to figure out
[1:10:28] what all the mechanics was in the
[1:10:29] revival
[1:10:30] during the welsh revival they got off
[1:10:32] the ship with the tall hats and the
[1:10:33] round collars
[1:10:34] he said seen coming down the street a
[1:10:35] little policeman swinging his club
[1:10:37] around whistling
[1:10:39] they said my good man could you tell me
[1:10:40] where the welsh revival is
[1:10:43] brother branham calls this in different
[1:10:45] places a happy policeman
[1:10:49] where where's the welsh revival happy
[1:10:51] policeman
[1:10:52] when's the last time someone come up to
[1:10:54] you and and said hey you look like you
[1:10:56] have revival
[1:10:58] but they said where is it at because
[1:10:59] they thought he could direct them to it
[1:11:01] he said you he said he said my good man
[1:11:04] could you tell me where the
[1:11:05] welsh revival is he said yes my brother
[1:11:07] and you're standing in the middle of it
[1:11:10] he said you understand i am the welsh
[1:11:11] revival
[1:11:13] i said because the west revival's in me
[1:11:18] and notice this brother brown said
[1:11:19] that's sovereign that's what god does
[1:11:22] and he alone has a right to send a
[1:11:24] revival
[1:11:26] we can't work it up we can't make it
[1:11:28] happen but he'll send it when we need it
[1:11:32] he alone has a right to send a revival
[1:11:34] not get the mechanics together
[1:11:36] and so many times that's what we worry
[1:11:38] about if we can have all the logistics
[1:11:39] and we get worried about having the
[1:11:41] right preacher and having
[1:11:42] all the right things and getting
[1:11:43] everybody together he said but not the
[1:11:45] mechanics together it's pray
[1:11:47] pray for god to send the dynamic
[1:11:52] now during that welsh revival
[1:11:55] things changed brother branham tells a
[1:11:58] story about a minister who prayed
[1:11:59] stopped over a culvert driving across a
[1:12:02] culvert in the road
[1:12:03] he was so burdened for the sins of the
[1:12:05] city he said lord
[1:12:07] he said let every person that drives
[1:12:08] over this culvert
[1:12:10] feel your presence and repent of their
[1:12:12] sins he said he got someone from the
[1:12:14] city that was a prayer warrior struck
[1:12:16] him underneath that culvert and prayed
[1:12:18] he said every time somebody passed
[1:12:19] through that culvert men would would
[1:12:21] stop
[1:12:22] on that culvert and just unexplained
[1:12:23] didn't know why and they'd suddenly
[1:12:24] begin to repent
[1:12:26] and give their heart to god that's
[1:12:28] revival
[1:12:30] huh that's not something somebody worked
[1:12:32] up that's revival
[1:12:34] brother brown says pray for god to send
[1:12:35] the dynamic
[1:12:37] there there was something that happened
[1:12:39] in that revival it was so changed the
[1:12:41] area
[1:12:42] that all of the the pit ponies the
[1:12:44] ponies they used to pull the coal out of
[1:12:45] the mines were confused
[1:12:49] they were confused because they were
[1:12:50] used to being directed by curses
[1:12:54] and all the miners would just curse at
[1:12:55] their animals he said none of the
[1:12:57] animals knew how to do anything anymore
[1:12:59] because nobody cursed
[1:13:04] that's revival
[1:13:08] they only understood foul language and
[1:13:10] the miners didn't talk that way anymore
[1:13:14] men would go into above this is
[1:13:15] documented history man would go into a
[1:13:18] pub
[1:13:18] and order a beer and try to drink it and
[1:13:21] start weeping
[1:13:22] because the presence of god was so real
[1:13:26] in the bar that they would leave it on
[1:13:29] the bar and walk away
[1:13:32] that year the welsh rugby team had had
[1:13:34] their best year ever
[1:13:37] and usually that was a a time when those
[1:13:39] people are
[1:13:40] fanatical about their their sports
[1:13:43] usually that be a time when everybody
[1:13:45] drank and and the stadiums would be full
[1:13:48] but during that year the stadiums were
[1:13:50] empty and the churches were full
[1:13:54] in spite of having their best year
[1:13:57] that's revival
[1:14:00] you think about arkansas winning the
[1:14:02] national championship
[1:14:05] if there was revival enough i'm not
[1:14:07] saying it's wrong to to follow arkansas
[1:14:09] it's not what i'm saying
[1:14:10] but if there was such a revival in the
[1:14:12] land that the people filled the church
[1:14:14] instead of the stadium oh church
[1:14:18] you don't have to tell people you have
[1:14:19] to yell at people about doing those
[1:14:21] things
[1:14:22] if there's revival in their heart
[1:14:27] brother adam says if you and i could
[1:14:29] still or brother branham is actually
[1:14:30] jeep campbell morgan
[1:14:32] who was a great preacher back then he
[1:14:33] said if you and i could stand above
[1:14:34] whales
[1:14:35] looking at it you would see fire
[1:14:37] breaking out here and there in yonder
[1:14:39] and somewhere else without any collusion
[1:14:42] or pre-arrangement
[1:14:43] and i think that's why brother branham
[1:14:44] was so attracted to the welsh revival in
[1:14:47] particular
[1:14:47] because there have been many revivals
[1:14:49] over the over history but this
[1:14:50] this revival just broke out
[1:14:52] spontaneously he said over here there in
[1:14:55] yonder and somewhere else
[1:14:56] without any collusion or pre-arrangement
[1:14:58] it is a divine
[1:14:59] visitation he said in which god he said
[1:15:02] let me say this reverently
[1:15:04] which god is saying to us see what i can
[1:15:06] do
[1:15:07] without the things you are depending on
[1:15:10] see what i can do and answer to it
[1:15:12] praying people
[1:15:13] see what i can do through the simplest
[1:15:16] who are ready to fall in line
[1:15:18] and depend holy and absolutely upon me
[1:15:21] don't you believe god wants to do that
[1:15:23] today he said
[1:15:25] see what i can do through the simplest
[1:15:26] see what i can do through the coal
[1:15:28] miners
[1:15:28] see what i can do through the field
[1:15:30] hands who are ready to fall in line
[1:15:33] and depend holy and absolutely upon me
[1:15:36] are you still with me this morning
[1:15:39] brother branham talked about the early
[1:15:40] days of the healing revival
[1:15:43] and we'll come back to the welsh revival
[1:15:44] after a bit brother brown said now he
[1:15:46] said we have just witnessed one of the
[1:15:48] greatest revivals
[1:15:49] i believe that the world has ever seen
[1:15:51] he said in these last 10 to 15 years
[1:15:53] there's been a revival
[1:15:54] he said not just like the days of
[1:15:55] billy's sunday or the days of the welsh
[1:15:57] revival
[1:15:57] or the days of the wesleyan revival of
[1:15:59] the moody revival
[1:16:00] he said it's been a worldwide sweeping
[1:16:02] affair around the world
[1:16:04] great healing services great revival
[1:16:06] fires was burned on practically every
[1:16:08] hill there is in the world
[1:16:09] he said right tonight way over in the
[1:16:11] lands of africa down in china and japan
[1:16:13] this gospel is being preached and people
[1:16:15] are being healed right this very minute
[1:16:17] around and around the world he said it's
[1:16:18] been one of the greatest revivals
[1:16:20] he said because i believe it's one of
[1:16:22] the last revivals this world will see
[1:16:23] a world sweeping revival he said but now
[1:16:27] in the last few years it's quietened
[1:16:28] down
[1:16:30] he said you don't notice the enthusiasm
[1:16:32] in the people
[1:16:34] that used to be
[1:16:37] when the great awakening come through
[1:16:39] new england the second great awakening
[1:16:41] they were building ships the great
[1:16:43] awakening come to new england
[1:16:45] and you know how people do they steal
[1:16:47] office supplies
[1:16:49] well these ship builders had stolen
[1:16:50] tools
[1:16:52] and they said the ship companies when
[1:16:54] the great awakening come through town
[1:16:56] had to build new barns to store
[1:16:59] the stuff people were returning
[1:17:04] why because revival makes you want to be
[1:17:06] right
[1:17:07] with god and with man
[1:17:11] and that's the kind of revival but
[1:17:12] brother branham talks about this healing
[1:17:13] revival as being so great even greater
[1:17:15] than that
[1:17:16] and he says but now you don't notice the
[1:17:18] enthusiasm of the people that used to be
[1:17:20] he said i remember of having the
[1:17:21] privilege by the holy spirit to
[1:17:23] spearhead that revival that started
[1:17:25] when that angel the lord appeared on the
[1:17:27] river and said that about many years ago
[1:17:29] he said to see it happen see it set
[1:17:31] ministers hearts of fire everywhere
[1:17:33] revivals broke out he said why you could
[1:17:35] just simply walk into a building
[1:17:38] and the people just get up out of their
[1:17:39] cots and stretchers and walk away
[1:17:41] healed you didn't even have to say one
[1:17:44] word just
[1:17:45] being there it's all it taken
[1:17:48] he said i remember one night in vandalia
[1:17:50] illinois
[1:17:51] i walked into the meeting i'm saying
[1:17:53] these things for a reason i want to
[1:17:54] stimulate our faith
[1:17:56] to see what god can do he said i walked
[1:17:59] into the meeting had no more been in the
[1:18:00] meeting over five minutes he said there
[1:18:02] wasn't a feeble person
[1:18:03] around the place anywhere wheelchairs
[1:18:06] pushed out and piled up
[1:18:07] blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking
[1:18:09] and he said just simply the spirit of
[1:18:11] the lord
[1:18:12] was present and he just healed the whole
[1:18:14] group of them
[1:18:16] he said now that's when you can do
[1:18:17] something is when revival is going
[1:18:20] but let that revival fire die down he
[1:18:23] said you can hardly the people are still
[1:18:25] christians
[1:18:27] but they're not revived into that spirit
[1:18:29] that great atmosphere
[1:18:31] that does something see you've got to be
[1:18:34] revived you've got to
[1:18:35] be associated you've got to be
[1:18:37] participate in your revival
[1:18:40] you've got to be a part of it he said
[1:18:42] it's just like in a forge in a
[1:18:44] blacksmith shop
[1:18:45] he said you've got to get the iron hot
[1:18:48] before you go pounding it on the anvil
[1:18:50] if you don't you'll never straighten it
[1:18:52] out
[1:18:55] can i be honest with you i would to god
[1:18:57] that i could just preach
[1:18:58] and people would be convicted and they'd
[1:19:00] know and they'd
[1:19:01] walk away from sin but today it seems
[1:19:04] like you just have to
[1:19:05] you just have to almost force it because
[1:19:08] people just don't know what's right and
[1:19:09] wrong anymore
[1:19:11] and what is that it's no revival you've
[1:19:13] got to get the iron hot
[1:19:15] if you do when you pound on it it'll
[1:19:16] become something
[1:19:18] it'll bend oh my
[1:19:22] he said if you don't you'll never
[1:19:23] straighten it out he said
[1:19:25] that's what it takes to have a revival
[1:19:27] is everybody under the heat of the holy
[1:19:29] spirit
[1:19:29] that's been brought down the powers of
[1:19:31] god and revival moving
[1:19:33] he said then there's prayer meetings
[1:19:34] going day and night every minute
[1:19:35] everywhere
[1:19:36] why the people wouldn't even leave the
[1:19:37] grounds
[1:19:40] where are we at today church i know of a
[1:19:43] very large message
[1:19:44] church one of the largest in the world
[1:19:47] and i was told that they had prayer
[1:19:49] meetings on an off night
[1:19:51] and in that very large message church
[1:19:53] there's an average of four to six people
[1:19:55] that come to the prayer meeting and none
[1:19:56] of the preachers i'm not condemning them
[1:19:59] where are we at i feel like what brother
[1:20:01] brown said there's no revival anywhere
[1:20:04] but there can be revival right here
[1:20:08] there could be revival right here
[1:20:13] brother says i remember in jonesborough
[1:20:15] arkansas now this happened just a few
[1:20:17] miles from here
[1:20:20] he said in joseph arkansas i don't know
[1:20:21] if i'm pointing the right direction or
[1:20:22] not i think i was pointing towards west
[1:20:24] plains
[1:20:26] he said but when i first started about
[1:20:27] my third meeting he said first in st
[1:20:29] louis and then at corning
[1:20:30] and then down to jonesborough the paper
[1:20:33] stated 28
[1:20:34] 000 people in the meeting for 20 or 30
[1:20:38] miles from the city
[1:20:39] was just tents set up you couldn't get a
[1:20:42] farm house to stay in
[1:20:44] the little city of jonesboro and people
[1:20:45] coming from miles packing lanterns
[1:20:48] walking through the jungles you got to
[1:20:50] understand back then he called it
[1:20:52] jungles because there were actually
[1:20:53] trees
[1:20:55] before they cut them all down made farms
[1:20:58] but he said you
[1:20:59] and it was a logging area perigold and
[1:21:01] in that area walnut ridge was a logging
[1:21:02] area
[1:21:04] and we lived over there and i was very
[1:21:05] interested in that history how
[1:21:07] now there's not a tree hardly to be seen
[1:21:09] unless somebody planted it around their
[1:21:10] house
[1:21:11] but he said people come from miles
[1:21:14] packing lanterns
[1:21:15] walking through the jungles catch a bus
[1:21:17] and come he said i set out in the
[1:21:19] wilderness one evening evening praying
[1:21:21] before the service started i seen young
[1:21:23] ladies coming with their shoes and
[1:21:24] stockings under their arm
[1:21:26] he said then before they get down there
[1:21:27] stop and brush off the dust from their
[1:21:29] feet
[1:21:30] put on their stockings and shoes and go
[1:21:32] into the meeting
[1:21:36] i wonder how much trouble we would get
[1:21:39] we would go to to go to have a revival
[1:21:43] we want revival but how bad
[1:21:46] when evan roberts who was one of the
[1:21:48] instigators of the welsh revival
[1:21:51] was 13 years old he began to pray for
[1:21:53] revival
[1:21:54] he began to pray he prayed for for seven
[1:21:56] years
[1:21:58] he prayed for revival and and then
[1:22:01] one day he was praying and he went to
[1:22:03] church and a deacon spoke to him
[1:22:05] because he was working in the coal mines
[1:22:08] he said he missed a lot of church
[1:22:09] because of his work
[1:22:11] he was working in the coal mines and a
[1:22:12] deacon spoke to him and said what if
[1:22:14] you weren't here when the spirit fell
[1:22:17] you say you want a revival and that was
[1:22:19] on his heart
[1:22:20] but what if you weren't here when the
[1:22:21] spirit fell that's something to think
[1:22:23] about isn't it
[1:22:25] what if you weren't here and i'm not
[1:22:26] trying to condemn you but again how how
[1:22:28] much would we put ourselves out
[1:22:31] if having revival meant that we couldn't
[1:22:34] and brother was talking about finances
[1:22:35] the other night if have if
[1:22:36] if having whole finances means you can't
[1:22:38] go out and eat for a while
[1:22:40] would you be willing to do it see that
[1:22:42] that makes you think doesn't it
[1:22:45] if having a revival meant you missed
[1:22:46] dinner
[1:22:48] now and then they say that people in the
[1:22:51] west revival got
[1:22:52] so under the inspiration of that that
[1:22:54] they actually felt the spirit of god so
[1:22:56] strongly
[1:22:57] that they would cry out and say lord
[1:22:58] leave me alone or i'm going to die
[1:23:02] it's such a a sense of the presence of
[1:23:05] god
[1:23:07] and this evan roberts from that day on
[1:23:09] he dedicated himself to church but it
[1:23:11] was years later
[1:23:12] when he was in his mid-20s when the
[1:23:14] revival finally came
[1:23:18] but now brother brown talks about it how
[1:23:20] he said i've seen them lay their sick
[1:23:22] children under old cotton trucks
[1:23:24] stay there day and night hold papers and
[1:23:26] canvas over them while it was raining
[1:23:28] storm of blowing not leave their place
[1:23:30] waiting just to get inside the building
[1:23:32] he said there is where the blind was
[1:23:34] seeing the death was hearing he said
[1:23:36] listen listen to this the ministry
[1:23:38] tonight
[1:23:39] is a hundred miles beyond that
[1:23:42] now go listen to those tapes i'm not
[1:23:44] putting down on anything brother brandon
[1:23:45] preaching back then but you can go
[1:23:46] listen to some of the tapes
[1:23:48] from the four late 40s and you look at
[1:23:50] the ministry later and brother brown
[1:23:52] said it's 100 miles beyond that
[1:23:54] because you look at the difference that
[1:23:56] he was still a prophet but you look at
[1:23:57] the word that began to come forth and
[1:23:59] even the manifestation of the son of man
[1:24:02] how it becomes so real
[1:24:04] he said the ministry tonight is a
[1:24:06] hundred miles beyond that but the
[1:24:07] revival fires has died down
[1:24:11] he said see the people walk up there and
[1:24:13] say just point your finger
[1:24:15] say well do you believe brother that's
[1:24:17] all he was out and gone
[1:24:19] that's all had to be done they believed
[1:24:23] amen the revival wasn't moving
[1:24:27] he said but we're living in a different
[1:24:29] time we are
[1:24:31] we are living in a different time
[1:24:35] but you still have to strive to have a
[1:24:37] life
[1:24:39] look brother brown talked about the
[1:24:41] difference in this time and this is
[1:24:42] after the quote we read about the young
[1:24:44] minister saying i don't have any joy
[1:24:46] but lebron says now the stabilizers has
[1:24:48] been put on the ship
[1:24:50] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:24:52] us
[1:24:53] could coronavirus have been one of those
[1:24:55] waves
[1:24:56] the things that we've been going through
[1:24:58] one of those waves this church has been
[1:24:59] through great
[1:25:00] fearful ways but there's been
[1:25:02] stabilizers put on the ship
[1:25:05] he says we know just beyond that wave
[1:25:08] yonder we're nearing the shore
[1:25:10] hey bad we're nearing the shore just
[1:25:12] stay stable
[1:25:13] he said just stay in the word stay with
[1:25:15] god no matter how you feel
[1:25:18] what anything else stay right with the
[1:25:20] word
[1:25:21] let it stay stable he said when you see
[1:25:23] all these great big old clouds around us
[1:25:25] storms coming and atomic bombs
[1:25:27] everything else they're talking about
[1:25:29] but our stabilizer
[1:25:30] is right straight in the word god said
[1:25:33] it would be here
[1:25:34] we'll crest every one of them do we
[1:25:36] believe that today
[1:25:37] he said yeah we'll go right over the top
[1:25:39] of them yes indeed they can't sink us
[1:25:41] they can't drown us
[1:25:42] you put us in the grave we'll come out
[1:25:44] again that's just all there is to it
[1:25:46] there ain't no way in the world to keep
[1:25:48] it down there we'll crest every one of
[1:25:50] them because our great
[1:25:51] chief captain is calling on the other
[1:25:53] side
[1:25:58] stabilizers don't mean the waves won't
[1:26:00] come
[1:26:01] and those waves will be waves of
[1:26:03] blessing and then waves of
[1:26:05] of hardship and trial
[1:26:08] it'll come and it'll go but you're
[1:26:10] stable during those times
[1:26:12] are you with me
[1:26:15] what does the word say he said stay with
[1:26:17] the word
[1:26:19] what does the word say now
[1:26:22] a revival if we could think about it
[1:26:24] this way is a return of of hearts to the
[1:26:26] atonement
[1:26:27] that's what malachi 4 came to do turn
[1:26:29] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:26:31] fathers
[1:26:32] so we could say it's i'm touching on uh
[1:26:35] our brothers that's my brother allen's
[1:26:39] forgot your name there for a minute
[1:26:40] brother ellen
[1:26:41] don't feel bad i forget my wife's name
[1:26:43] every now and then
[1:26:45] i'm touching on his sermon series on the
[1:26:47] atonement but that's what it is it's a
[1:26:49] return to the atonement
[1:26:51] and if there was as long as there is an
[1:26:52] atonement there could be revival don't
[1:26:54] let satan
[1:26:55] defeat you on any blessing or trick you
[1:26:58] out of any blessing that's included in
[1:27:00] the atonement
[1:27:02] because the atonement is still there
[1:27:04] today if it wasn't we talked about it
[1:27:06] last night if we didn't have mercy
[1:27:08] we i couldn't have survived yesterday
[1:27:12] not because i went out and did some
[1:27:13] great sin but because i live in flesh
[1:27:17] right and if we didn't have mercy we
[1:27:18] couldn't survive day by day
[1:27:22] as long as there was an atonement there
[1:27:23] could be revival but listen what the
[1:27:25] word says ii chronicles 7 14 if my
[1:27:27] people
[1:27:28] now listen where was he at solomon was
[1:27:31] in the temple
[1:27:32] and the holy of holies was there and he
[1:27:35] said if my people
[1:27:36] the atonement there was god providing a
[1:27:38] way for the people
[1:27:40] if my people which are called by my name
[1:27:42] shall humble themselves
[1:27:44] and pray and seek my face
[1:27:48] and turn from their wicked ways then
[1:27:50] will i hear from heaven
[1:27:51] we'll forgive their sin and we'll heal
[1:27:52] their land there's a sermon right there
[1:27:55] look if my people which are called by my
[1:27:57] name shall what humble themselves number
[1:27:58] one
[1:28:00] number two pray number three seek my
[1:28:02] face
[1:28:04] number four turn from their wicked ways
[1:28:06] then will i hear from heaven because he
[1:28:08] knew
[1:28:09] they were human beings he knew they
[1:28:10] would go back and forth and be up and
[1:28:12] down
[1:28:12] he knew they would need revival so he
[1:28:14] said every time you need revival
[1:28:16] if you'll turn your face to this we take
[1:28:18] this as being national revival but
[1:28:20] that's not the land he's talking about
[1:28:22] he's talking about god's people
[1:28:24] israel was god's people america has
[1:28:27] never been
[1:28:28] all god's people are you with me now
[1:28:30] israel was god's people
[1:28:32] they were god's elect we are god select
[1:28:35] amen and if my people who is he talking
[1:28:39] to
[1:28:40] if my people which are called by my name
[1:28:43] shall humble themselves and pray
[1:28:46] then i'll heal their land i'm closing
[1:28:49] with this
[1:28:53] as i said evan roberts was instrumental
[1:28:55] in
[1:28:56] in in continuing the revival that had
[1:28:58] already started
[1:29:00] again praying for revival at the age of
[1:29:01] 13 and for years and years he prayed
[1:29:05] one day he was in church i don't know
[1:29:08] about you but this really spoke to my
[1:29:10] heart
[1:29:11] you forgive me i'm not trying to force
[1:29:13] anything
[1:29:14] i i just want to see god move
[1:29:17] i have a longing in my heart there's
[1:29:19] something in me
[1:29:20] i want to see people really change
[1:29:25] i want my family it's not just everybody
[1:29:27] else but but us
[1:29:28] my kids they they've got to be in the
[1:29:31] right atmosphere
[1:29:32] that's got to be hot the anvil's got to
[1:29:34] be hot there's got to be a way for it to
[1:29:35] be heated
[1:29:37] so that they can feel conviction so that
[1:29:40] they can be saved
[1:29:41] you've got children you've got loved
[1:29:42] ones that are out there there's people
[1:29:44] sitting here today
[1:29:45] you need something from god you know
[1:29:46] that you're not where you're supposed to
[1:29:48] be
[1:29:49] maybe you've been praying about it and
[1:29:51] seeking the lord but you just haven't
[1:29:52] gotten that
[1:29:53] answer yet but i want to encourage you
[1:29:56] if you'll humble yourselves and pray
[1:29:58] he said i will evan roberts began to
[1:30:02] pray and
[1:30:03] one day he was in church an old minister
[1:30:06] that'd been there for many years
[1:30:08] the old pastor he said he was praying
[1:30:11] and he said these words lord
[1:30:14] bend us bend us
[1:30:19] it's one thing to follow to get down on
[1:30:21] your knees and pray
[1:30:22] it's another thing when god puts you
[1:30:24] down on your knees
[1:30:26] when there's such a burden in your heart
[1:30:28] for revival that you can't do anything
[1:30:30] else but get down on your knees
[1:30:35] and this young man evan roberts had
[1:30:38] gotten into a cold period in his life
[1:30:40] he'd started out on fire and done
[1:30:41] all this praying for all these years and
[1:30:43] he'd gone cold
[1:30:45] he'd gone to bible school and just
[1:30:46] couldn't get nothing from bible school
[1:30:48] he'd gone cold
[1:30:49] and so he left bible school and he come
[1:30:50] to this church and he he was
[1:30:53] he was listening to the preacher you
[1:30:55] need to be listening for the voice of
[1:30:56] the spirit
[1:30:58] because this was a voice that that
[1:30:59] ignited a revival
[1:31:01] it was just a preacher praying lord bend
[1:31:04] us
[1:31:06] and it just struck him because he was
[1:31:08] praying for the holy ghost
[1:31:10] and he struck him and that day he went
[1:31:12] back to eat with the preacher and his
[1:31:14] family
[1:31:14] he went back to eat with them and the
[1:31:16] preacher offered him some buttered bread
[1:31:18] he said no i'm full and when he said
[1:31:21] that he said conviction struck his heart
[1:31:22] because he said
[1:31:24] maybe the reason i haven't received the
[1:31:26] holy spirit is not because it's not
[1:31:27] offered
[1:31:28] but because i'm just unwilling to take
[1:31:30] it
[1:31:33] and that voice of the ministry could
[1:31:35] hear it in his heart
[1:31:36] bend us in the next service he come back
[1:31:41] and they had a prayer meeting and he
[1:31:44] began to fall on his knees and begin to
[1:31:45] cry
[1:31:46] lord bend me
[1:31:50] put me on my knees lord
[1:31:53] bend me and that's all he could say he
[1:31:55] just prayed it over and over again
[1:31:57] lord bend me
[1:32:01] he has yet to not even preach to a crowd
[1:32:03] he was allowed
[1:32:05] after a prayer meeting to speak to 17
[1:32:07] people
[1:32:08] and the lord put something on his heart
[1:32:10] and this is what he said
[1:32:13] he had four things the lord put on his
[1:32:14] heart and i think it still applies today
[1:32:17] he said first of all he said confess any
[1:32:19] known sin to god
[1:32:21] and put away any wrong done to others
[1:32:25] you want revival there's a way to have
[1:32:27] it
[1:32:29] you want to have life there's a way to
[1:32:31] have it
[1:32:33] secondly he said put away any doubtful
[1:32:35] habit
[1:32:37] put away any doubtful habit what steals
[1:32:40] your time
[1:32:42] what makes you hard
[1:32:46] listen if you hear something preached
[1:32:47] across the pulpit and that's why it's a
[1:32:49] dangerous thing and even as a minister i
[1:32:51] have to be careful
[1:32:51] because i want to stay with the word
[1:32:54] because i can actually harden your heart
[1:32:55] by preaching things that aren't the word
[1:32:56] and you harden
[1:32:57] yourself to that and then when i say
[1:33:00] something that is right
[1:33:00] you won't listen so i have to stay with
[1:33:03] the word
[1:33:04] not just preach legalism but when you do
[1:33:07] hear the word
[1:33:08] and your heart doesn't respond to it and
[1:33:10] you know you know you should be doing
[1:33:12] something different but you don't
[1:33:13] respond
[1:33:14] put away that doubtful habit
[1:33:18] he said obey this holy spirit promptly
[1:33:22] how many times you can go back and look
[1:33:23] at brother branham would call out
[1:33:25] someone he said you're going to miss it
[1:33:27] and he would counsel the people don't
[1:33:29] wait to respond
[1:33:31] if the holy spirit's moving in your life
[1:33:33] if the holy spirit is moving in the
[1:33:34] service
[1:33:35] don't wait to respond if you feel the
[1:33:37] tug to go to an altar if you feel a tug
[1:33:39] to be prayed for if you feel a tug to
[1:33:41] raise your hand or to worship whatever
[1:33:43] that it is do it
[1:33:45] feel the tug to talk to somebody about
[1:33:46] their soul
[1:33:48] and i appreciate that i've seen some of
[1:33:50] you do that i know you do that
[1:33:51] you feel that tug whether it's on
[1:33:53] facebook or whether it's somewhere else
[1:33:55] make sure if you feel a tug to talk to
[1:33:57] somebody about their soul
[1:33:58] and the right opportunity comes do it
[1:34:01] obey the holy spirit promptly don't let
[1:34:05] satan
[1:34:06] there come a time in one of the meetings
[1:34:07] when evan roberts he couldn't understand
[1:34:09] why the meeting just seemed to be so
[1:34:10] flat
[1:34:11] and he went home and the preacher's
[1:34:13] daughter said i felt the holy spirit
[1:34:15] was in me to sing and they'd asked me to
[1:34:18] sing and she said she refused five
[1:34:20] times she'd been asked to see she said
[1:34:22] i'm just not ready
[1:34:24] and she refused five times and he said
[1:34:26] that's what hindered that meeting
[1:34:27] and when she went back the next time
[1:34:28] she's saying and the holy spirit come
[1:34:30] again
[1:34:33] he said well those things aren't true it
[1:34:34] was true for brother branham
[1:34:38] obey the holy spirit promptly confess
[1:34:41] christ openly
[1:34:45] with your manner of life with the people
[1:34:47] that you're around
[1:34:49] you don't have to hide who you are
[1:34:52] i'm a believer i'm a christian you don't
[1:34:55] have to go tell them a bunch of things
[1:34:57] about pyramids and
[1:34:58] clouds and things like that just tell
[1:35:00] them you're a christian
[1:35:01] let people know you're a child of god i
[1:35:04] think of that little girl
[1:35:05] that was down there and been taken
[1:35:07] captive by by a
[1:35:08] name in the syrian and she was down
[1:35:11] there in a foreign land all by herself
[1:35:13] down there just just no no support
[1:35:15] system at all no church to go to
[1:35:17] and she's down there by herself and here
[1:35:19] she is in those campfires at night
[1:35:21] wondering why was i dragged down
[1:35:22] here but she had such a testimony in her
[1:35:24] heart that even as a young person here
[1:35:26] she's sitting in those campfires and
[1:35:28] then she gets in the man's home
[1:35:30] she becomes his servant and and he gets
[1:35:32] sick with leprosy
[1:35:33] and she said oh that you were in my
[1:35:35] country
[1:35:36] pretty bad i may be a slave i may have
[1:35:39] been mistreated i may be down here you
[1:35:41] may feel like you're mistreated at work
[1:35:42] but maybe if somebody got sick you could
[1:35:44] say oh
[1:35:45] that you went to my church because we
[1:35:46] believe in the healing power of god
[1:35:48] we believe in the presence of god we
[1:35:50] believe god said jesus christ is the
[1:35:52] same
[1:35:53] yesterday today and forever do you
[1:35:54] believe that
[1:35:56] she said what god you were in my country
[1:35:58] and he was healed because of a little
[1:35:59] girl's testimony
[1:36:04] confess christ openly obey the
[1:36:07] holy spirit promptly put away any
[1:36:09] doubtful habit confess any known sin to
[1:36:11] god
[1:36:13] put away wrong done to others
[1:36:16] within two months after he got up to
[1:36:18] those 17 people
[1:36:20] and said those four things when the long
[1:36:23] sermon
[1:36:24] within two months sixty thousand souls
[1:36:26] have been saved in whales
[1:36:29] i don't look for sixty thousand souls
[1:36:33] there was a hundred thousand people
[1:36:34] total healed in that revival
[1:36:36] you remember a story in the bible where
[1:36:38] the king goes to the prophet
[1:36:41] and he said this is the arrow of god's
[1:36:44] deliverance
[1:36:45] he said and every time you smite the
[1:36:46] ground with it he said it's gonna
[1:36:49] there's gonna be deliverance and so he
[1:36:51] didn't tell him how many times to smite
[1:36:53] and he smoked once twice three times he
[1:36:55] stopped
[1:36:56] and the prophet got mad at him he said
[1:36:58] you should have kept smiting
[1:37:01] you should have kept smiling well before
[1:37:03] the welsh revival
[1:37:04] evan roberts wrote down on a note he
[1:37:07] wrote you talked about writing things
[1:37:09] down he wrote down on a note he said
[1:37:10] we're going to have a hundred thousand
[1:37:12] souls saved from this revival
[1:37:15] he was a practically illiterate coal
[1:37:17] miner tried to go to bible school and
[1:37:19] failed
[1:37:20] but he said we're gonna have a hundred
[1:37:21] thousand souls saved and guess what over
[1:37:24] the course of that revival there were a
[1:37:25] hundred thousand
[1:37:26] souls saved sixty thousand within two
[1:37:30] months
[1:37:32] revival broke out
[1:37:36] revival broke out listen to me
[1:37:39] musicians go ahead and come
[1:37:42] why did the revival broke out break out
[1:37:44] because evan roberts was willing to be
[1:37:46] bent
[1:37:48] within a year of the revival he had a
[1:37:52] nervous breakdown
[1:37:52] never preached in that manner again
[1:37:57] it was never used by god in that way
[1:37:59] again but for one year
[1:38:01] a hundred thousand souls were saved
[1:38:03] would you be willing to be broken
[1:38:06] would you be willing to bend brother
[1:38:08] branham talked about
[1:38:09] going into the forest he talked about
[1:38:11] how there was trees
[1:38:13] he said all the old dead trees made a
[1:38:15] mournful sound
[1:38:16] you remember the story they all made a
[1:38:18] mournful sound when the wind blew
[1:38:20] through
[1:38:20] he said it was just as the wind blew
[1:38:22] through the the trees
[1:38:24] he said but then he saw some young trees
[1:38:26] that come up there'd been a forest fire
[1:38:28] he said there were some young trees that
[1:38:29] come up he said and they just bent in
[1:38:31] the wind
[1:38:32] rejoiced in the wind what is it what is
[1:38:34] revival it's the wind of the holy spirit
[1:38:37] on the dead pentecost there come a
[1:38:39] rushing mighty wind and when the wind
[1:38:40] come what was it they bit
[1:38:44] god are we willing to bend are we
[1:38:47] willing to
[1:38:47] let the wind of the spirit the price
[1:38:49] revival that i believe we're
[1:38:51] we have today are we willing to
[1:38:52] participate in it enough
[1:38:54] that we could bend maybe our nature is
[1:38:57] not to be excitable but we can bend
[1:38:59] maybe we're not somebody who likes to
[1:39:00] talk to our neighbor about the lord but
[1:39:01] we can bend maybe we're somebody who
[1:39:04] who just never has gotten that excited
[1:39:05] in church but we can bend maybe we're
[1:39:07] somebody who's never prayed out loud but
[1:39:09] we can bend
[1:39:10] lord bend us that would be my cry today
[1:39:14] church
[1:39:15] lord bend me bring back the new again
[1:39:19] let me know what it's like to pray to be
[1:39:21] able to pray and know that it's cutting
[1:39:23] all the way through to heaven and pray
[1:39:24] through
[1:39:25] it won't be that way all the time in
[1:39:26] your life but there's got to be some
[1:39:28] times that it is
[1:39:30] there's got to be some times that we can
[1:39:31] touch heaven there's got to be sometimes
[1:39:33] when it's more than just a preacher
[1:39:34] preaching a sermon but when the holy
[1:39:36] spirit moves among us and we can feel
[1:39:38] his presence then we just linger
[1:39:39] because we know he's here there's got to
[1:39:41] be some times like that
[1:39:43] there's got to be some moments when we
[1:39:45] put aside our intellectualism and
[1:39:47] and all of our learning and and and know
[1:39:49] that god is here
[1:39:50] just because he's present among us it's
[1:39:52] got to happen
[1:39:55] i felt it happened i felt it happen in
[1:39:57] different ways but we've got to respond
[1:39:59] to it
[1:40:00] we've got to it's that or
[1:40:03] or it's it's life or death
[1:40:06] and i've told you the story before but i
[1:40:08] remember christian and pilgrim's
[1:40:10] progress as
[1:40:11] he was going towards salvation he was
[1:40:14] going towards that celestial city
[1:40:15] towards that
[1:40:16] gate of salvation in celestial city and
[1:40:18] as he was traveling
[1:40:20] towards salvation his wife and his
[1:40:22] children
[1:40:24] were crying out come back
[1:40:28] come back how many things are crying to
[1:40:31] us today
[1:40:33] it's not worth it come back but he had
[1:40:36] such a burden on his back
[1:40:38] of sin that he wanted to see it released
[1:40:40] and so he began to run
[1:40:42] and he put his he put his hands over his
[1:40:44] ears
[1:40:45] and he began to run in the story and he
[1:40:47] said life
[1:40:49] i must have life and they said come back
[1:40:52] but he said i must have life
[1:40:54] i wonder if we could stir ourselves that
[1:40:56] much so we can cry out lord
[1:40:58] i must have life
[1:41:02] the world's going to go crazy it is
[1:41:03] going crazy but i must have life
[1:41:07] whenever you do it lord whenever you
[1:41:09] stir whenever you begin to move
[1:41:10] i'll i'll raise my hands i'll begin to
[1:41:13] welcome you in
[1:41:14] i'll begin to ask you to come i begin to
[1:41:16] pray in that direction
[1:41:19] it won't be hard to get me to do it
[1:41:21] because there's something inside of me i
[1:41:23] must have a life
[1:41:25] would you bow your heads with me it
[1:41:27] wouldn't take all of us to do that
[1:41:29] and take one of us
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:36] what that puts on me how does that make
[1:41:37] me feel this morning
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:40] wouldn't take all of us pick one
[1:41:45] one person really get down to business
[1:41:47] with god
[1:41:49] could change the entire atmosphere
[1:41:52] of a service of a church of an area
[1:41:56] one person really really getting where
[1:41:59] they should be
[1:42:00] you say well so-and-so should get be
[1:42:02] where he needs to be what about you
[1:42:06] what about me
[1:42:09] when's the last time you just gave in to
[1:42:11] the spirit of god
[1:42:13] the last time you surrendered to god and
[1:42:15] said lord move through me
[1:42:18] i know it's not all about emotionalism
[1:42:20] but when's the last time
[1:42:21] that you felt the presence of god so
[1:42:23] real that you were moved to do something
[1:42:28] the holy spirit moved to the
[1:42:29] congregation he's still alive today
[1:42:32] there won't be a worldwide sweeping
[1:42:34] revival we don't obtain our joy
[1:42:35] on the outside we won't get it by
[1:42:38] looking at the news but there's
[1:42:39] something

[1:42:59] something in me

[1:43:04] [Music]
