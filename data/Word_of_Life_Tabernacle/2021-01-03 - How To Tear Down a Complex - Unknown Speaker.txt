and speak to us amen let's just start with the first verse there the first verse i have heard how christians long ago they were brought before the tyrant's throne they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of christ but one by one they chose to die the son of god they were not deny like a great angelic quieter sings i can almost hear their voices is ringed i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to under his command i pledge allegiance to now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of jesus still goes on now our time has come to count the cost to reject this world to embrace the cross so one by one let [Music] to us us life till the trumpet sounds on that final day let us proudly stand [Music]

for our sins thank you for all that you have done for us lord and we owe every bit of our allegiance and our very lives to you today and lord we don't just give it as a debt but lord we give it freely lord you've given us liberty and we give you back everything that we are everything that we have father i pray that you would come in this service this morning that you would begin to touch those that have needs today i believe you've laid this on my heart for a reason so i know there must be someone to receive it lord i pray for those that are still sick and some still aren't able to come to church and we're thankful for those that you brought back among us lord i pray for those that are still sick and in need that you would just move lord wherever they're at maybe they're watching this morning i pray god that you would just settle down your holy spirit while the service is going on settle down there in the living room wherever they're at father and that you'd heal them completely lord i know that you're still god and we we trust you lord to do what you do lord every day in our lives we thank you for it we ask it in jesus name amen amen do you love him this morning amen amen uh we're going to read from first chronicles chapter 4 verses 9 and 10. first chronicles chapter 4 verses 9 and 10. it's good to see you all this morning good to have brother jt back with us today and uh what a blessing that is and and brother david is still on the mend he's doing better he just needs to get his oxygen levels up a little more and and uh but he's he's feeling better and so we're thank the lord for that and and uh he's at home this morning and uh good to see bill and sharon back with us today it's nice to have you you all back with us and all of you that have been uh been out some for the holidays and for sickness and other things we we know that god is still god in 2021. do you believe that so this is our first service in the new year and we're thankful to be here we're glad we survived 2020 brother glenn and we're pressing on to the mark of the high calling in christ it's good to see all of you with my mom's here this morning what a blessing that is to have her back among us and and uh we weren't sure that we would have her around and and she was very sick with covid and we're so thankful that god's brought her back with us i want to add my condolences to the passing of brother kirby who passed away by james kirby from hot springs a pastor there in hot springs for many years and i want to add my condolences to the family and to the church and and i met him a few times he's always a gentleman and treated me right and treated my family right for many years down there and and so we want to you know another one goes on and and uh he had fought his fight and kept the faith and now we move on and and try to pick up our part and pick up the baton and move on and there's been many there's a lot of pastors of that generation that were with brother branham and and here during those times that have gone on now and uh we don't have very many of those left and but thank god we still have the god that he taught us about is still here and still alive and so we're thankful for that but be remembering that that church and and his family in in prayer and we're also i'm sorry to keep you standing for a moment but we're going to have an election as we said for to reelect the deacons and trustees i've also nominated with alan price uh to be served as a trustee and uh so if it's the will of the church for him to do that we've nominated him to serve and you'll vote on that and brother harvey savage to serve as a deacon and all of the current officers to stay and so we we thank god and i think all of them are and so we thank god for that now we'll do that just the way we did the pastor election so we'll start getting ballots out to you next week because it's hard to get everybody here in the same service so we'll do it the same way and and just collected an offering i think is how we did at that time and just collect the ballots that morning that weekend brother andrew glover is supposed to be with us so we'll be praying about that that he'll be able to make it this time after several times that he's tried to come and and been hindered but maybe this is the time that the lord would have for him to come and uh so it'd be saturday night and sunday morning and that's that's on the 16th and 17th uh let's read from first chronicles chapter 4 and verse 9. you still love the lord you still love me amen you still love one another amen god bless you this morning we're so glad to be in the house of the lord and jabez was more honorable than his brethren and his mother called his name jabez saying because i bear him with sorrow and jabez called on the god of israel saying oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thine hand might be with me and that thou would escape me from evil that it may not grieve me and god granted him that which he requested let's bow our heads one more time we've talked for a moment let's talk to the author lord jesus i pray god that you just come and open this book to us lord help us help me to say nothing that i shouldn't say lord and only the things that i should we ask it in jesus name amen you can be seated i want to speak to you this morning on a subject and i want us to listen this morning and try to pay attention if we can because i think it's something that all of us deal with and i know you've heard some things on this before but maybe it'll just open up to you in a little bit different way i want to speak to you on how to tear down a complex how to tear down a complex i heard a story about a salesman who was out one night on a dark rainy night and he had a flat tire he's out in the country and on a lonely road and in the distance he sees a farmhouse so he gets out of his car and he's walking through the rain as he's walking through the rain he begins to think he said well you know it's late at night and it's raining and the farmer probably went to bed already and and surely he'll have a lug wrench but he's probably going to be mad at me for being bothered and he gets himself all worked up as he goes along and he gets a little bit closer to the farmhouse and knocks on the door and and somebody from an upstairs window says who is it and the salesman says you know who it is it's me and you can have your old lug wrench i didn't want it anyway he never asked for it because he had already built the complex that he wasn't going to get it i the other night i was pondering about complexes and things that to deal with to do with the mind and i was pondering about that brother stewart mentioned it and so i'm kind of stealing his thought a little bit but he'll be preaching for us wednesday night but he had mentioned it on watch night i read a quote about complexes and then that night i went to bed and i had a dream and in my dream i asked myself the question do you have a complex do you have a complex and the answer is probably yes for almost all of us we we probably have some kind of of complex and it's something that humans do that's just what we do it's part of the human condition and yet is something that must be recognized and overcome and that's important because just because people do this doesn't mean we have to continue to do it because we are overcomers we're called to something better and and if you tear one down you might come up with another one you might build up another one not realize it but but you're called to tear those things down and to defeat those things now uh there's the bible tells us that there is no temptation taking you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it so we could put it like this that you can always live the word you can always live the word you don't ever have to live not according to the word you know there's nothing you say well brother ben you don't know my life no the word is not there for you to reach out and never be able to attain but the word is there so you can attain to it and we do that by the grace of god we do that by the mercy of god we know in the flesh we can't do that but there's something inside of us that pulls us to be more than what we are and something greater than than what we can even handle on our own we're so grateful for that today but so we deal with these complexes but we have to overcome them now the first thing that we want to look at is how the complex was built because if you know how something was built if you could get the plans to something if you were going to uh going to attack a fortress if you could get the plans to it you would know you would know how to attack it what the weak points are how to tear it down and as we begin to study the plans we realize we've got to overcome and overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks now a complex is interesting because if you look at the word complex it's something that is consisting of many different and connected parts right a complex is not just one thing a complex starts as one thing and you build it and i build it into something else right and so the complex it's a core pattern of emotions memories perceptions those are the building blocks that go into it it's wishes and it's in our subconscious realm it's not something that we think about because if you thought about it you wouldn't you wouldn't think like that but it's subconscious many times that you these thoughts these uh these attitudes these emotions these memories and they come in to make you prejudiced in a certain way so a complex is and when i begin to think about a complex i think of the pentagon complex which is a military complex what that means is a building or a group of buildings used for a purpose and it's there to what what does that do it directs all of the activity for the military so out of that complex every spy every soldier in all parts of the world out of there comes wars in the middle east right out of there comes comes raids on different parts of the world out of there comes ships going to asia and everything the plans come from the complex and if you watch your life and you find yourself with with bitterness or or with you you find yourself reaching out and lashing out in a way you say what was that i'm not that way that's not me i'm a christian you find yourself doing something taking an action that you wouldn't otherwise take it started at the complex right it was the complex that you built up something and that's what caused you to react in that way and you know maybe that it's not biblical to do that but it's just and if we're not careful we just accepted it well it's just who i am but but that was something that we have to tear down because it's very hard once a complex gets built to take it out it won't just leave on its own you've got to tear it down so a complex is the headquarters for what you do right and so it's not just a passing thing but it makes what makes you tick it's what makes you the way that you are there's people who've never been to church won't go in a message church yet they say they believe the message why that action comes from the complex right it gets sent out through there they may not even understand why but there's a complex there's something that where they've been done wrong they've had emotions and and and problems maybe with a preacher or somebody else and it causes the complex to send out a signal or an action to do a certain thing it's the headquarters for bitterness is a complex the headquarters for your war against humanity right you're wondering why people treat people the way that they do on the road in a grocery store at work it comes from the complex and a complex is built around emotional damage now when the pentagon complex was built blight eisenhower gave a speech after that when he left the presidency and that was built during the second world war and there's always a reason why we build what we build right the things that we what we are we may not realize it but we're we're becoming what we are for a reason we are maybe you are careful around in a certain situation you're careful maybe you were chased by a dog brother brown gives an example of that in discernment you were chased by a dog when you're little and it caused the fear to come on you of dogs maybe i have a fear of the water and just as far as swimming in it i i've never been able to swim and and my dad i think was the same way and it just kind of gets passed on but it builds up kind of a complex where you really believe that you can't do it there's no reason why you can't but it's just a it's a complex that's built up and and so a lot of times there's some reason for that and the second world war was the reason for the pentagon and and dwight eisenhower began to speak of that as the military industrial complex it was the idea that if we're not careful as americans that will feed this war machine because it's profitable right and so he says the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist because the truth is a lot of people died in world war ii but there were some people who were sad it was over you know who it was the guys who were on the factories they they they were they were sad they were they were unhappy that it was over the guys who were making millions and billions off of arms right and the world war ii lifted us out of a depression right and so what happened is we become addicted to that and then it went into the cold war and the vietnam war and every war since and the thing and i'm not here to talk about politics that's not what it's about but i want you to think about a complex something that's been built something that's entrenched a fortress that's there and it's something you think you need it's not something you think you don't need or you get rid of it right but it's something you think you need to survive but the truth is you'd probably survive without it in fact you definitely would survive without your complex but it's built around emotional damage hurts disappointments fears an example of a complex would be it and this is in psychology they say the example of one would be if one had a leg amputated when he was a child it would influence his life in profound ways even if they overcame the physical handicap a person would have thoughts emotions memories feelings of inferiority triumphs bitterness determinations centering on that one aspect of his or her life many people carry complexes from high school i carried a little bit of a complex because i didn't go to high school but some people carry complexes from that people carry complexes from the way that they're raised and don't even realize it and most of those have an element of truth but the structure that you built is a lie now think about this for a moment look look at elijah in the bible first kings chapter 19 and verse 9 speaks of elijah and says he came to the unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah now there's a loaded question and he said i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts he had been that was true for the children of israel have forsaken that covenant thrown down thine altars saying thy prophets with the sword well that was true partially but the truth is the last prophet said slain with the sword was baal's prophets go look it was right after that that he killed all the prophets of baal now but that's mostly true that's true of the children of israel that just in general they were that way and then he says and i even i only am left that's not right you see there's an element of truth and then he builds a complex on it right somebody did something there was somebody hated him jezebel hated his guts we could say it that way jezebel hated him and the truth is as we live in life and just being a christian there's people who just hate you for being a christian that's true but when you build that into i even i only am left that's the lie right and that's what you you have to tear that down and to do that see but we were rooted in this truth and say well i've been treated badly so i'm the only one left the children of israel are like this so i'm the only one left and he said and they seek my life to take it away all that is true except the part where he says i'm the only one left and we know it's not true because in first kings 19 18 it says yet i have left me seven thousand in israel that's quite a few more than one right he says i'm the only one right and we're glad that every the seven thousand are glad that everything that he elijah said wasn't thus saith the lord because if it was they'd be out right but he said i'm the only one left and and here the here he coming and they said god said but there's 7 000 left he said these which have not bowed unto baal every mouth which has not kissed him now that wasn't a majority he wasn't close to a majority wasn't even a very healthy minority but it was a lot more than one right and god's got a lot more than one left today but but i've seen preachers get hurt and i'll go to preachers because that's that's where i come from and maybe you can apply it to your life but you get hurt and then you begin to think well maybe i'm the only one that really believes it right i'm the only one that really teaches it right and pretty soon you build lies on top of that truth and when you get done the complex controls your ministry the way the military-industrial complex controls war right and if you're not careful the complex controls your life the way the military-industrial complex controls war that when it gets too peaceful it's not they don't like it the complex don't like that so it upsets you it makes you mad and makes you angry makes you look for perceived slights makes you look to try to make you think the pastor don't love you the church don't love you everybody's against you nobody cares about you you see what i'm saying this morning it's just based on that complex and you've got to tear all of that down and the truth is it starts with truth but it turns into a lie now it's a conscious decision based on an unconscious prejudice so you're doing things consciously but you don't really know why and it's because of this complex now maybe you were treated badly by someone in authority sadly many people are someone who you trusted betrayed you you may consciously forgive that person in your mind you may say i forgive them but in your spirit there's a continuing mistrust of people with authority and you sit in church and the preacher says something like there's people in this place that need to be born again sit back and say well i don't know what he's preaching about i was born again 45 years ago i'll have you know i was there when it happened right well maybe he wasn't preaching to you right and just as a general statement by the way you could say that in every audience over about seven or eight people because you're not going to know everybody's life maybe even in that small of an audience but you could say somebody in here needs to be born again and it would be true right in most audiences it would fit somebody that don't take much discernment to know that you could say there's three kinds of believers and somebody sit there and get offended well he called me an unbeliever well no not at all number one you're giving the preacher too much credit because he doesn't know your life right it's not that saith the lord and so he's just trying to repeat what the scripture says and what the message of the hour says so the preacher says some people in this place need to be born again and the devil begins to whisper in your ear and and tell you well he doesn't think you're born again and the next service you go to church and the same preacher doesn't shake your hand well the preacher really said that but for some reason you've got this problem with for whatever reason it is you may not know why but you you kind of you've got a spot there that you've kind of kept guarded maybe somebody was a legalist in your past life and treated you manhandled you with words and so you sit there and and you constantly guard that place now somebody says well some someone in here needs to be born again you see well he's preaching at me that's the first brick the first piece of lumber you're building the complex all right and then the next service he doesn't shake your hand right which right now that's most of you just because we're not really shaking hands much around here but but you know because of the not want to spread anything but that's you know you could say that you take that as a slight well he didn't shake my hand and then maybe you call and he doesn't answer well you don't know why right you don't know why you just but but in your mind that's another brick and then maybe you're gone for a couple weeks and nobody says anything it's another brick it's another stone and you get to feeling like well they don't care if i'm there or not i might as well not be there huh and you don't know why it might be that people don't care but it's probably not especially in a church of this size we need every one of you we need every person sitting here i'm not gonna run that would be suicide for me to just start running people off why would i do that on purpose we've got to stand for the word but i'm not going to put you out of the church or treat you bad you know on purpose right and so but but you take that and i don't know of any situation like that but i'm using that as an example what is it material for the complex you're building maybe you went christmas time and you've always felt like an outcast at the in-laws house you go to the inlaw's house and you sit down at the christmas table and somebody says something or maybe they don't say something about the dish you brought or whatever and it makes you just feel worse and you added the final brick to that complex you can't get out of it anymore and you can't enjoy dinner you can't you you can't enjoy even being around them anymore why you build a complex many times we build complexes around disappointments brother branham says this in the restoration of the bride tree he said so the people are disappointed he said i would be too and he's talking about people that wanted to be prayed for and couldn't be prayed for and that was a lot of people and go back and listen to the prayer lines they were wonderful but most of the people didn't get prayed for even most of the people lined up didn't get prayed for have you ever thought about this how would you feel there's two people i always felt sorry for in the prayer lines one was the one that brother branham says would you believe if i didn't say anything about you and just go on now you know they say yes they would believe but they feel kind of bad that he didn't discern their heart like he did everybody else's and then the other one i always felt sorry for was that next person in line right this person gets healed and and brother billy paul whoever was takes him away from the platform and the next person in line just standing there and i've heard stories of people who went over and over again and never did get prayed for and there were times brother branham tried to pray for them all but it's just physically impossible to do it so he said so the people are disappointed he said i would be too he said but he said i'd just like on this easter morning to make in my confession to say that i don't know what to do about it that's a good confession for a preacher to make sometimes he said there's just too many you know to get to thousands and thousands he said the people around the world he said i've taken my seventh trip he said around as you know and i have a personal contact he said i have in personal contact with better than 10 million people from around the world he said so you can imagine how it what a strain that is on you he said many times we hit little strains he said i know you do too and little disappointments how many people have ever been disappointed here well now there's an opportunity to build a complex right now look this one he says but think of them i have he said the disappointments i have when sick mother's on the phone listen to what he says i feel so bad for the mother and for brother branham in this situation because he said there's sick mothers on the phone they're saying oh god well wait just a minute brother branham and then they start praying lord jesus i pray that you'll send him he's on the phone you know what do you do about that maybe it's in another country in another place another state and their little baby is dying and and saying oh god wait wait just a minute brother branham lord jesus i pray that you'll send him he said i just hung up on the phone from another one and here and here and here all around the world he said you know how it is he said that's not easy when somebody in the end of the phone with a sick baby or a sick husband or a dying wife praying for you to come he said now you can imagine he said no wonder i'm a neurotic he said it's enough to make one he said but i have done this one thing now listen to this he said instead of getting a complex i've tried to hold steady by keeping my eyes on calvary and moving on because you can't pray for everybody not everybody is going to be healed that you do pray for but you keep your eyes on calvary and keep moving on and that's what we have to do church as a church we can't help everybody we want to help everybody but we can't help everybody but we keep our eyes on calvary and remember it's up to him anyway he said as many he won't lose the one so we'll help everybody that we can help but those that we can't help that we can't get to we leave those in god's hands he said i've done this one thing instead of getting a complex i've tried to hold steady by keeping my eyes on calvary and moving on just as he would have me to do he said in many of my mistakes i pray that god will forgive me of things maybe i should have went one place and didn't go he said i'm just human i'm subject to mistakes now i want you to notice that no one else but you i guess but you is unnecessary there no one else can build your complex you ever thought about that brother ben i have a complex you built it no that's not that's humans that's what we do right we all do it but you built it i didn't build your complex the deacons can't build your complex the trustees can your wife can't build your complex you build it are you with me now and so you can learn a lot about how to tear down a fortress by finding out who built it right and it's got a name on it on every brick it says you right every brick of a complex that i would have i built it i built that as a former president said you didn't build that well you did build your complex right that that's a little bit harsh i know but we've got to understand this brother random says it this way about himself because he said here he didn't build a complex about that one thing but he did build a complex about something else and he said i had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message look what he says i had built myself a complex it's true the people didn't hear the message just like it was true that the people were in a bad shape and they were trying to kill elijah but he built the complex that he was the only one that was elijah that built that it was you look at that spirit of elijah coming down through john and john built his own complex when he said behold the lamb of god takes away the sin of the world and then he sends out his disciples said are you here do we wait for another right and he was the one who saw him that spirit of god come down on him like a dove and all the things happened and if anybody should have been sure it should have been john but his eagle eye got filmed over and he built a complex in prison and he said are you really him and brother brown said i built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message notice brother brown doesn't blame the people but he does understand the reason this is why i can't change that but i can tear down the complex i can't change the fact that the people won't hear my message i hope you're listening to me today you can't change you know you get into a marriage and you realize that person maybe there's certain things about them you wish would change you wish it would have changed for 30 years but you can't change that but you can tear down your complex elijah built elijah's complex brother branham built brother branham's complex i built mine you build yours the hurt can be there the pain can be there but if i don't build on it it won't ever be a complex huh if if i if i leave it alone if i don't get mad every time somebody doesn't speak to me and and you know if if i consciously walk away from those things if i don't let other people destroy my joy and take away my happiness but the problem is we build it many times subconsciously before we even realize that it's built then we're looking back and said now what do i do with that it's hard for me to sit in church because i built such a complex that people don't like me that everything sounds bad you know what'll happen when you build a complex against somebody they can't that person won't be able to sing preach pray or say hello without you thinking about that complex all right they won't be able to do anything every everything they do is going to be wrong because because of a complex you build and that person may not be the best person in the world but as we said about job sometimes god allows people like job's wife to say curse god and die and he said you speak like a foolish woman not you are a foolish woman but you speak like one why he wasn't going to build a complex out of it how do you tear a complex down number one you don't play with it you got to get serious about it don't baby it well i can't do that and so many people give names to their complexes complexes and worship them today and call it whatever syndrome they want to call it and it's just a complex and they've given it a name and they worship it and say well this is the way i am this is what it is and i've taken 49 facebook personality tests and they all tell me i'm this way you know what they're going to tell you they're going to tell you what you put in you know how those tests know what you are they know because that's what you think you are but that doesn't mean that's what you have to be right you say well i i just i i just hold on to it because it gives us a feeling of security it's the pentagon some people build little forts other people people build a pentagon they got great big walls and they've got all kinds of security and spies going out everywhere see if people care about them or not see if people love them or not and the truth is you'd feel so much more loved if you quit sending out spies you'd feel so much more cared for if you quit looking at facebook like it was like it was the next person that said anything negative was gonna you were gonna die maybe if you quit looking at facebook at all because every time you look at it it builds it feeds into your complex they didn't say nothing about me they didn't like my picture they didn't say nothing about my children and so it just keeps building and building and building until finally you built the pentagon you don't know how to tear it down now what do i do with this huh you said pastor what do i do with it well number one you gotta quit baby in it because the complex will destroy you if you let it and you built it got to tear it down you're not hurting nobody but yourself i read a story i may have told it to you before about a farmer that was doing kind of a tow service on the side because people would cars would break down out on the country road and a car broke down out on the country road the bra the something went out in it and ran out of water or something like that and antifreeze something happened and and they found a farmer they said what do you charge us he said ten bucks on the ride after they got back to the service station the wife was just fuming husband and wife in the car she's just fuming she said i can't believe he charged us ten bucks to just go back to the service station of course that's been a lot of years ago be a lot more now i can't believe you charged us 10 bucks her husband said that's okay i kept my brakes on the whole time all he got out of that was burn up brakes you know the guy in the truck might have felt minutes are hard this is the hardest toe i've ever had but he towed it man it didn't hurt him it hurt it tore up their brakes that's what grudges are doing that's what bitterness is doing it don't hurt them you put the brakes on and and make the the minister drag you make the church drag you make your family drag you along and you got the brakes on the whole way but boy i taught them a lesson they can't do that to me no no they can't you did that to you brother brandon built such a complex you can go and you've heard about it before i'm sure you've been read the quotes where he built this complex because the people wouldn't listen to him and he had a dream about how that a bomb and different things like that and him being a bomb and in standing in the gap he confesses all of that and he says and a voice got to talking he said i was talking to him it said carry out your plans you'll be like that he was a prophet of god ordained by god but he had to tear down this complex he said carry out your plans you'll be like that i said lord i don't want to be like that said your wife will go too she won't live up there in them hills like that he said you'll become a bum just as the dream showed that you would imagine a prophet of god becoming a bum how could that ever happen well it's because he built himself a complex and if he'd have kept building on it but see he recognized it existed now this is important god had to show him this is where you're going to end up and sometimes god uses a minister to do that sometimes he uses a family member sometimes somebody else that one day we wake up and realize hey i got the pentagon i got to do something with it i've built a fortress here and it don't need to be there it's keeping me from joy it's keeping me from happiness it's keeping me from being all that i was created to be in god and so you recognize that it exists that's the first step this is something i created i need to tear it down and so brother branham in that message standing in the gap he said god bless you each one we hope to see you again real soon he said till then will you do this one favor for me both here and on tapes also you brethren he said pray that god will place into my heart that's something that i lost out there in that complex he said it's so easy to build a complex and he built one and he tore it down but then he said pray that i'll get back what i lost from those years of thinking through the prism of a complex all those awards that i started all those wars that started at the pentagon the complex that i built all those wars that i started i wish i had never started one and he said lord and he said ask the people he said would you help me would you pray for me that i'll get back what i lost in the complex amen he said i had an interview the other day with my brother way sitting here and said standing here in front of good man but built himself around a complex he said another kind of a complex he said did the same thing brother way you can so easily do it it's you just get a little something in your mind keep thinking that way now i've learned that and i like to i like to say something to somebody if i see somebody i see brother isaac sitting here and changing his hair he's probably waiting on me to say something about it his beard and i'd like to say something if i see something like that i i say something about it but you have to be careful doing that because if a person sitting over the complex they get mad i know sister fritz doesn't have a complex about this so i wouldn't have said it last week about her age but i got her age wrong i said she was 86 i think she's 87. now we've made it twice as bad haven't we but it's so easy to build a complex so brother branham calls out brother away and says by the way you had a complex too and now listen what brother branham says he said you he said you can do so easily do it if you just get a little something in your mind and keep thinking that way he said go back and check it with the scripture is this making me more like jesus is this giving me the fruits of the spirit is this attitude is this making me reach out for my brother or what's it doing to me go back and check it with the scripture see if it's right or not and then go from there on amen he said yeah he said don't lose the feeling of the people see he said you must remember they're not made out of sawdust they are flesh and blood human beings and a soul now if you don't believe that a prophet can hurt someone's feelings look at what happens next after brother branham and standing in the gap tells about his complex and said brother way you've got one too by the way fell over dead had a heart attack right in the service and of course i need to be careful not to offend someone that much because we we have to be able to raise the dead if we do but he he he was so shocked by being called out over the pulpit or whatever that it was so brother branham he said don't lose said don't lose the feeling of the people you must remember he said they're not made out of sawdust he said they are flesh and blood human beings and a soul so that night flashing red light is a sign of his coming he said this morning i had preached at length way over my time tired and warned he said there could be two things speaking of brother way he said he either got tired he said or when i spoke of having a complex not just to mess my brother up as we'd say it but he said because i was making my confession of having complex he said i guess if i'd ask tonight in this audience of people how many in here knows you have complex he said practically every hand would go up we won't do that this morning we don't want anybody fall over dead but he said that you might know brother way just let me show you whether it's discernment or not how many knows that you got a complex raise your hand he said look it there see he said but i don't know if that shock of me saying that to brother way taking it like i might be rebuking him or something then he fell into that condition and the lord jesus brought him back he said then it might have been this i love this he said that i've tried to think of it this afternoon that i had stood here with all my heart told you exactly the truth tell you of my conflicts make my open confession and i ask you to pray that my inside being would be changed towards the people that i could do as the lord did and to confirm that he will still send me to the field he let that happen to show that he still heals the sick and raise up the dead amen my sister sarah had a liver transplant and and as i remember it she had a tumor on her bile duct that goes to her liver and first she had surgery when she was just a few months old a couple months old to remove the the tumor was the size of a grapefruit and they had surgery in kansas city to remove that and when they went into surgery i remember them coming out and telling us that her liver was hard as a rock but there was nothing wrong with the liver in itself but it was this this bile duct had been stopped up so it wasn't getting what it was supposed to be getting and it just become hard that's the way a complex is that's what it does to your inner being it's what it does to your heart it makes it where it stops up the flow of the holy spirit in and out of your life it's the flow of love and joy and peace and so when you get the complex out you tear down the complex you find that there's a hard heart there but what do you do lord take it out of me what did she have she had a transplant took the old one out put a new fresh healthy one in what do you have to do take the old one out let the new one come in let his spirit come down and just make you new make and that's what brother brown was praying about he said ask you to pray my inside being would be changed towards the people that i could do as the lord didn't confirm that he will send me to the field he let that happen to show that he still heals the sick now listen you can't play with a complex or you'll end up dead naturally spiritually whatever it is if you mess with it you play with it you resent when it's called out you you hold that back and you're holding on to it that's my complex that's where i fight my wars but you wouldn't need it if you didn't have any wars and you create your own enemies and see god should be our fortress the word should be our our defense we defend ourselves by the word not behind a complex and that's why some ministries have become just a complex ministry that's all they can preach it's the complex because they've defended themselves behind the complex so long but you've got to get out from behind the complex and stand behind the word storm the castle you can't play with it you can't let it sit there say well i'll deal with it sometime no every day you're adding to it it's almost a complex is there it's building like a cancer cell it's adding it's adding it's growing it's moving it's spreading every day it's building you got to tear it down when you realize that you have it that's the time to make your confession or whatever it is that you need whatever complex that it is tear it down if it means just walking away from it forgetting about it tear it down quit taking material from people run over here and grab some material and rushing back and putting it on my complex right over here and grab some material you're going to find material the devil is going to provide you with lots of material quit taking it from people quit building it let that be a reality something that you can say lord i'm done with that storm the complex how do you do that how do you do that well you built the complex with bitterness and with strife and with with all of these things how do you do it you fight a spiritual war second corinthians 10 and three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of complexes strongholds the definition there's a castle a stronghold a fortress a fastness anything on which one relies the arguments and reasonings by which a disputant endeavors to fortify his opinion and defend it against his opponent that's what you've used to make your argument from but tear it down listen what he says so he said the pulling down of strongholds what do you do you're never going to break into a keep or a fortress by just standing there and lob and arrow at it every now and then well on sunday morning i'll repent no but monday morning man i'm back at it huh what good are you doing you just building the places you tore down if you build again what you what you tore down you're in trouble the bible says that so you've got to storm it right don't let it sit there storm it make it uncomfortable huh that's hard to do because we take comfort sometimes in our complex but listen what paul says casting down imaginations and you get the vivid picture of a soldier running up onto the walls of the fortress and he grabs hold of the garden he throws him off pretty graphic isn't it that's what you've got to do that thought comes up and says well they don't like you run up on the fortress grab hold of it it says i know that my god loves me throw it down what can man do unto me they the complex stands there and says but but but you don't know they're against you and you run up there and says but my god is for me and if god is for me who can be against me are you with me now whatever that was on that fortification here there's a guy up there and he's he's shooting poison darts into your soul run up on the complex and tear it down cast down imaginations they're the soldiers in the complex imaginations things that that word is computation figuratively reasoning conscious conceit imagination thought cast that down reasoning that that that'll get you in a lot of trouble you start thinking you start thinking you think well because i've seen preachers do this i think i've told you that before but so-and-so wasn't at church today that's evidently because of what i said and the truth is they may not have been listening to what she said but but i've done this it's also wasn't at church it must be because of what i said so i i better i better not bother them because they're probably mad at me so you don't pick up the phone you don't realize that maybe they got sick maybe something happened huh maybe they just stayed home and you don't know what's going on in other people's lives you can do that with your own spouse by the way you come home and usually you you she greets you and just so excited to see you and she's not today you sit there and say well she gonna treat me like that i think i'll just move on i think i'll just go down and and piddle in the garage so you go down there and after a while you've gone six or seven days you haven't spoken to one another nobody knows why reasoning computation imaginations she must not love me anymore that's usually not the reason usually there's something else so paul continues this military thought of rushing a defended keep tearing it down bringing the thoughts into captivity so it's running up on the on the hold or the keep running up on the castle you run up to the top you grab a soldier and imagination and you grab hold of him he's in captivity right so what's he going to do brother sam he's not going to move unless you tell him to you can't help the thoughts from coming around they're going to be there the enemy's going to be there but he's in captivity right you cast down imaginations and then you grab hold you take into captivity every thought because it's the thought that led to the imagination so the thought comes by and says i'm not going to make it grab hold of that before it becomes an imagination put it in captivity to the word of god don't leave the stronghold alone keep fighting against it what makes the complex break what makes us seemingly impregnable line of defenses break is when the enemy runs at it right now when they sit back and then fight a trench warfare and many of us have been fighting trench warfare with our complexes for years but you got to run at it you got to get serious about it you got to begin to begin to dig into it and say lord i'm ready to be done with this i'm ready to be done with it i'm not going to think like this anymore i'm not going to be like this anymore i'm not going to walk this way anymore i'm not going to let people get me down like this anymore don't leave it there if a complex can be built with hurts with love or with with hate with disappointments with fears it can be torn down by love joy and peace philippians 4 and 6 says be careful for nothing that means be anxious about nothing there there's a commandment we ought to keep we want to tell people especially our children i like to do this the bibles command you to obey me the bible says obey your parents and the lord for this is right how many of you have ever quoted that to your children i don't know what the rest of you all are doing you know i've quoted that to my kids over and over what does the bible say i like to remind them of that but here's a commandment be careful for nothing god's saying that to us be anxious for nothing but in everything now see you can't leave that spot vacant right you say well i'll just clear my mind well guess what will come in disappointments fears anxiety so what are you going to do you're going to fill that spot with prayer and supplication in everything by prayer and supplication and thanksgiving with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god so instead of being anxious you become prayerful amen and finally he says and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep that's the same word defend it'll be your fortress the peace of god will be your fortress you don't have to worry about standing behind this complex and constantly reminding your children well you probably don't love me anyway you don't have to do that constantly remind your wife or your husband or your or someone else your mom or dad oh you really don't love me anyway or you wouldn't be like that no no you know you can rest in the goodness of god if i remember one time i was asked to read the bible and i think it's in psalms and every morning we'd have a bible reading and prayer and that morning i picked the scripture out of psalms and said if if my mother and father forsake me the lord will will pick me up and my dad didn't take too kindly to that he said well what are you reading that for built himself a complex out of it but it's the truth isn't it if there's nobody else you still got him you if nobody said well nobody loves me but you've got an unlimited store of love pretty bad an unlimited amount of joy and unlimited by the david amount of peace whatever that it is i just called you david joe i'm sorry an unlimited amount of of the power of god i hadn't done that now you have a complex if i hadn't done that you wouldn't have known i hadn't said something about it but you got unlimited amounts don't you you don't have to worry about well the person at the grocery store didn't treat me right but god treats you right every day you have the almighty on your side and if god gets for you who can be against you you got to start thinking like that and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep keep that's just fortress your hearts and minds through christ jesus the next verse says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest what's over things they're just whatsoever things are pure what that what's over things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things that'll tear down your complex number one it'll it'll fall apart from neglect you quit building on it and storm it with love and joy and peace and things that are just things that are pure things that are honest things that are lovely things that are of good report brother brown says when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this and they said so should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth so they asked him that question he said take exactly the opposite he said if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that always wants to have everything your way now i know some people who aren't only children that are like that so not just only children he says if you're that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way that's a complex turn right back around give everything you got the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything start giving away what you got see he said just vice versa he said that's the way to overcome anything is an antidote amen my old southern mother used to say a hair off the dog back is good for the bite and that applies this way too the antidote make the complex uncomfortable by doing exactly the opposite of the orders that get issued from that pentagon complex does that make sense you don't have to obey it that order comes down from the complex and says you need to not go to church today because nobody loves you i'm not going to obey that i'm going to go to the house of god not because anybody there but because the lord said assemble yourselves together that's what the word said the complex comes down and says that the order comes down from the complex and says today you need to start a war with your brother-in-law your sister-in-law your mother-in-law no i'm not going to do it you know how you resist the devil you say no to the devil that's what a prophet of god taught us say no and don't do it because you don't have to do it he said well i don't have the strength to not do it what you don't understand is you do have the strength because he said i can do all things through christ who gives me strength amen make the complex uncomfortable you've got to step out of that bitterness step out of that guilt i read a story about some christians in korea and they had been told by when the japanese invaded and took over korea in the second world war they were told not to have church they padlocked the doors of the church and this one pastor he he just couldn't stand him and over and over he he knocked on the door of the japanese soldiers and and the man that was in charge there the general that was in charge and he sent him letters he called him he tried every way that he could we need to have church we need to have church let us have church and finally the japanese soldiers got tired of it and they said go have church and so they opened the doors and that morning all the christians come because they hadn't been able to have church in a long time they come and got inside the old church building and made out of wood like all the buildings there were they got out of the in the old church building and they began to sing they were known the korean christians were known for their singing and they begin to sing different songs and after a while they realize the door had been locked behind them and then some at the back begin to smell gasoline they began to realize they'd been locked in they were about to be burned alive and they stood there and didn't know what to do so the pastor just began to lead the congregation in a song there's no way out he began to lead him in the song alas and did my savior bleed and did my sovereign die at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away they sing at the top of their voices the place burnt down with everybody inside they all died i got a note here for me to check the time it's right about time to close years later 30 years later the koreans put a memorial on that place but the koreans were bitter towards the japanese indescribably bitter because this was just one thing in a whole history of things that had been done to the korean people by the japanese the japanese were very warlike people and thirty years later there was a group of japanese pastors that were traveling through korea they come across this monument where the church had stood they'd never rebuilt and just had a monument there saying what had happened they come across it they said we got to do something about this this was a wrong done not by us by our people and so they said we got to do something so they went and gathered money and japan brought it back and built them a new church and that first sunday morning the koreans come together to worship and from that area and they began to worship the lord but a little japanese delegation had come and sit in the corner wanting to see the results of what they'd done but the koreans after 30 years still held that bitterness as you would if you had family members and forefathers and such that had been burned alive and they're sitting in the corner wondering what to do and they begin to sing that same song at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away one of the korean brothers began to realize he still held that he was still holding that he he just didn't feel right towards these japanese soldiers these people that were these pastors that were japanese even though they weren't soldiers he felt so bad about that and he just didn't know what to do so all he could do he's just stood up while they were singing the song he walked over and he began to shake the hands of the japanese people that were there and the service broke open and the bitterness was gone what did he do he stormed the castle yes it was it was a it was a horrible wrong that was done but the burdens rolled away at the cross here we are gathering at the cross we can be one here at the foot of the cross someone said the ground is level at the foot of the cross what do you do to a a bitterness that's there you take an action to make it right even if you're the one that was wronged make that complex uncomfortable storm the gates brother branham says surely after all these years on the field around the world and seeing different people he said i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at he said if you want to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does could we do that church no matter what anybody does if they're wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember god loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you love the other person when he's in wrong see just pray for them and love one another above everything love god and love one another and be humble with god and around one another and god will bless us in his heart telling what he will do i read the scripture the other night and it struck me he said let each esteem other better than himself esteem assumed by the same that you're a better man than i am and then we can get along because i assume that you're better than myself and i wouldn't hold anything against myself not if i was had my sanity i don't you don't hold things against yourself you hold it against other people god help us today i read starting out the prayer of jabez and you might wonder if i would ever come back to it the bible says jabez was more honorable than his brother and his mother called his name jabez because i bear him with sorrow and we don't know what sorrow that was the jews say that he was an illegitimate child we don't know what it was he was born under that name identified his life you may not like your name but at least you weren't named sorrow he's born under that his name and the circumstances of his birth may have caused him great pain in life but the reason he was more honorable than his brethren is because of what he did with it now you're listening look look at what at first chronicles chapter four if you look at that chapter you see a sea of names just a whole bunch of names one after the other after the other news says and jabez i want god to be able to do that for me i want him to be able to say that about me jabez was more honorable why not because he had more advantages in life because he probably had less advantages than any of the others he was born under that name that sorrow he was more honorable than his brethren because instead of wallowing in that pain he called on god and the bible says jabez called on the god of israel saying oh just stop there for a minute storm the gates if you need something get serious with god if you go back in there in the original this oh it's not just him saying oh that that would bless me indeed but it's all from the depths of his heart you don't see people call out to god like that anymore but all that we would do that today if you've got something that you need you cry out to god for it say oh it come from his heart something that he needed all that that would have blessed me indeed i've got this sorrow in my life i was born under there with this problem going on but all that that would have blessed me indeed oh that that would have blessed me in need blessed me with spiritual blessings like you promised abraham enlarge my coast let me possess all the land promise to me that thy hand might be with me let me be directed and helped in all that i do and keep me from evil that is literally keep me from sorrow his name means sorrow he says keep me from becoming that are you with me maybe you've had things going wrong in your life maybe you have had things going and i'm closing in just a moment but he literally said keep me from becoming what i was born to be keep me from when i was born i was given a certain name keep me from becoming that lord help me don't let me be that way in john 17 when jesus prayed for the disciples i'm closing musicians go ahead and come he said i have given them thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou should have taken them out of the world but that thou should escape them from the evil that is literally keep them from the influence of the evil one have you ever wondered why did judas finally betray jesus when he did why did he betray him when he did born to be the son of perdition but what pushed him over the edge what caused the devil to enter into him become incarnate so something happened you find the story in john 12 john 12 chapter 4 a little woman a prostitute had come to wash jesus feet she come to watch jesus feet and she didn't care how it looked he had a need i pray that we would be that way today with our worship she he had a need and he was sitting there she come and she washed his feet with her tears wiped them with her hair and poured broke a bottle of an alabaster box of ointment and poured it on him judas is standing there and judah says in verse 5 if you go to that next verse why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence it was a lot of money and given to the poor judas begins to get upset at what he sees as a misuse of church funds this was money that was given to jesus and his disciples for the work of the ministry or could have been given to them you understand she could have just taken the money and put it in the bag and instead of doing that she bought this ointment and poured it on jesus and he got upset judas got upset and said but he said that not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein and that makes the job of a treasure a hard job brother david's done an honorable job with it but judas was the treasure you know why he was a treasure because they trusted him but the bible says he was a thief and then said jesus let her alone he said against the day of my burying hath she kept this that's all he says to him let her alone for the poor always you have with you but me how you have not always let her alone leave her alone let her do it now he called peter a devil he says he looks at peter and he says he says devil get behind me that's pretty harsh and to judas all he says is let her alone he gets up from there and goes looking for the high priest he got offended he put the last brick on the complex that would make him sell jesus and take his own life and you know it was something beyond his control or he wouldn't have killed himself he just had to do it listen church don't let the word be the last brick on your complex you better storm it tear it down let it go or the word maybe the last brick on the complex we've seen so many people leave the the message not because one thing happened all of a sudden they realize oh the bridge wasn't what it was supposed to be the vision was wrong and then they can't prove that it was wrong but they just say oh it was wrong must not be right oh that changed me now i'm not a believer anymore that's not what changed them it was the last brick on a complex the last piece of mortar the last piece of wood he said i can handle it but you couldn't handle it and you left and judas left went out found the high priest and began to look for an opportunity the bible says to turn on him oh god i don't want to ever get that way i don't believe i can because i'm not the son of perdition you understand you're not the son of perdition i don't believe you can but don't hold on to a complex because it'll kill you it'll make you kill yourself bow your heads with me if you will i know it's a very somber subject and it's hard because we all deal with complexes anytime you preach something that deals with everybody it's a problem because everybody feels a little convicted i feel a little convicted but the purpose today is not to tell you that you have a complex because most of you understand that the purpose today is if you have one storm the capes don't let you let it sit there make it right and if you have to walk away from it walk away from it quit looking for materials to build with quit looking at people like their supply depots or lowe's or home depot with material that you can build your complexes out with that's not what people are if you're not careful you'll look even at somebody maybe somebody that you want you like it maybe you want to marry you look at that person and say but but but that's just a supply depot if you're not careful everything they say just builds into your complexes and you can never really trust somebody somebody you're actually married to you look at them just as a supply depot for material for your conflicts don't do that let jesus come in today and and just give you strength and say lord i'm going to think on good things i'm going to believe i'm going to i'm going to have joy love and peace in my life i'm not going to let this complex control my life i'm not going to let it be the pentagon control everything that goes on and i want this military complex in my life i want to be free i want to be right heavenly father lord jesus i pray like jabez when he was born under that under that curse under that sorrow every one of us are born with some sorrow in our lives some pain but oh god may we cry out like he did oh that that would bless me indeed oh that you would enlarge my territory help me to be all that i can be in you lord i don't have to i'm not bound to what my parents are what my grandparents are what my what my genes that are in me i'm not bound to that i don't have to live that way i don't have to build on this complex anymore i can storm it with you with me lord i can overtake it i can throw down those imaginations i can cast down those imaginations i can take those thoughts into captivity i may not be able to stop the thoughts from coming but i can make them captive to your word i pray you'd grant it today lord lord in my life if there's a complex being built right now maybe subconsciously that i wouldn't know about let your holy spirit come down lord and just just tear it out today wash it out lord sometimes the greatest antidote for bitterness is just to be in your presence lord somehow in your presence we can't think that way about people as brother branham talked about reaching a place in prayer where the whole world it looks like looks good to you it doesn't look like that anybody's your enemy you reach that place in prayer it doesn't matter what people do to you what they say about you oh god may we reach that place today may we worship you in such a way lord that you would know that you were welcome here let me not be like judas who criticizes somebody who gets a little bit lost in worship spends a little bit too much money or or praises a little bit too much but god may we be like you lord may we have your attitude let it be so let it be so it's needful for today it's needful that someone would wash your feet i pray you'd grant it lord thank you for all that you do for us thank you for building us up as a church lord the opposite of a complex being built is the word being built in our life and you sent the ministry to do that i pray god there would ever be so help me not to build complexes in people's eyes or supply material for the complexes but lord may i supply only your word to the people so that they can build on that word into the body of christ i pray you'd grant it lord that we would be edified lord until we until you come and catch us away thank you for all that you do for us lord touch every heart this morning speak to everyone we pray in jesus name amen i surrender hallelujah thank you lord sing it now oh i surrender my life [Music] i give it all to you let's stand and sing it stand together and sing it if you need prayer the altar is open i surrender just worship him a minute it'll do wonders for you today if you can't get away
