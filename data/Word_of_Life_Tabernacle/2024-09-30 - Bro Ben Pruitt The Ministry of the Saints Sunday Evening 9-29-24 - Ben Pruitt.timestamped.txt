[45:49] uh we want to hear from them every
[45:50] chance we get 1 Corinthians 16 and 15
[45:57] I want to speak to you tonight on
[45:58] something just on my heart as a pastor
[46:00] and I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[46:03] titled this the ministry of the
[46:05] Saints I beseech you Brethren you know
[46:08] the house of stefanus that it is the
[46:11] first fruits of
[46:13] aaya and that they have addicted
[46:16] themselves to the
[46:18] ministry of the Saints it's kind of a a
[46:22] different scripture I trust it'll be a
[46:24] blessing to you pray the Lord would add
[46:26] his Blessing to the the word you may be
[46:28] seated tonight enjoyed that song very
[46:32] much sister Emily I I really did I
[46:35] just I've been thinking about that
[46:38] lately uh sister Fritz my goodness it's
[46:42] good to see you back in the house of the
[46:43] Lord today God bless you it's been a
[46:46] several weeks since she's been with us I
[46:48] think or at least that I was here so I
[46:50] sure appreciate you being here today and
[46:52] and each one of you being with us sister
[46:54] Sophie uh being with us today I I think
[46:57] you were here Wednesday but it's good to
[46:58] see you back in the house of the Lord
[47:01] and doing better doing well amen we we
[47:03] believe God's our healer don't we amen
[47:07] amen the word uh Mi uh ministry here is
[47:13] service it's di is the is the original
[47:16] word is where we get our word Deacon
[47:18] refers to a Ministry or a service either
[47:21] waiting on others or a Ministry in the
[47:24] church it describes several different
[47:27] actions in its most basic form it can
[47:30] refer to the simple servitude that a
[47:32] person would provide when someone was
[47:35] visiting his or her house so you might
[47:37] say
[47:38] Hospitality Hospitality but it's more
[47:41] than that it's it's a waiting it's a
[47:43] attendance on someone it's literally
[47:46] attending to the Saints waiting on them
[47:49] service to them the way a waiter would
[47:53] at a restaurant and so you're watching
[47:55] to see uh if there's a need if you've
[47:57] been to a restaurant a nice restaurant
[48:00] one of the worst things you can do is
[48:02] pay good money for a meal and get
[48:04] terrible service because you're s you're
[48:06] sitting there and you're waiting and uh
[48:08] and you're waiting on uh the food and
[48:11] then it takes forever and no one checks
[48:14] on you you want somebody to check on you
[48:15] and that's what this means is that
[48:17] you're literally being checked on or
[48:19] checking on others the ministry of the
[48:23] Saints and this word comes from Acts
[48:26] chapter 6 and verse one as well when the
[48:30] uh number of disciples was multiplied
[48:32] and and of course whenever you get a
[48:34] bunch of people together people start to
[48:36] Grumble and because we're human beings
[48:39] and sometimes we get out of sorts and we
[48:42] get disgruntled and and things like that
[48:45] uh and they did in the early church they
[48:47] had the Holy Ghost but they were still
[48:49] humans and and so they uh as they begin
[48:52] to grow they there begin to be problems
[48:55] in the church because the widows were
[48:57] neglected or it seemed that the Greek
[48:59] widows were neglected because the
[49:02] Hebrews took care of their own first and
[49:04] and so what happened is that the 12
[49:07] that's the the apostles called the
[49:09] multitude of disciples unto them and
[49:11] said it's not reason that we should
[49:12] leave the word of God and serve tables
[49:15] he said wherefore Brethren he said look
[49:17] you out among you uh seven men of honest
[49:21] report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom
[49:23] whom we may appoint over this business
[49:26] that was the first deacons now we know
[49:28] that deacons can actually be preachers
[49:31] as well as brother Stuart is a deacon
[49:33] and a preacher because you remember
[49:35] Stephen and how he got stoned for
[49:38] preaching the gospel he was a deacon he
[49:40] was a deacon but he was also an
[49:42] evangelist and and he preached the word
[49:44] and he got stoned for it and hopefully
[49:46] that won't happen to brother Stewart but
[49:49] but the first Deacon that was a preacher
[49:50] got
[49:51] stoned but but this was a uh this was a
[49:54] service or in their job as a deacon that
[49:56] were servants and and in act 64 it says
[50:00] but we will give ourselves continually
[50:02] to prayer and to the ministry of the
[50:05] word so there's a different Ministry the
[50:07] ministry of the word is different from
[50:10] the ministry of uh Ministry of the
[50:13] Saints now brother brandham taught us
[50:15] that if you're a preacher you're called
[50:17] to the pulpit to preach a and people
[50:20] have asked me brother Ben why do you
[50:21] preach why why bother preaching why not
[50:24] just play tapes because you read a lot
[50:26] of quotes anyway and I do read a lot of
[50:28] quotes I'm aware of that so why do you
[50:30] bother preaching well because a prophet
[50:33] of God told me a Vindicated Prophet told
[50:36] me that if I'm a preacher I'm called to
[50:39] the pulpit and this is a
[50:42] Pulpit to preach so I'm doing what God
[50:44] told me to do I'm doing what he told me
[50:47] to do through a Vindicated prophet and
[50:49] so I'm not going to listen to any minor
[50:52] Prophet any preacher any other thing
[50:55] tell me that I can't stand behind the
[50:56] pulpit and preach because that's exactly
[50:59] what a prophet called me to do so if
[51:00] you're a preacher you're called to the
[51:02] pulpit to preach a preacher also needs
[51:05] to know what he's talking about how many
[51:08] can say Amen to that tonight we need to
[51:10] know what we're talking about so so the
[51:12] apostles told the deacons they said we
[51:14] need somebody to help us because we need
[51:17] to get our spend our time studying the
[51:19] word and we need to spend our time in
[51:20] prayer and we need to have a uh we need
[51:23] to make sure that when we get up we've
[51:25] got something to say
[51:27] we're not just sitting up there stand up
[51:28] there talking but we've got something to
[51:30] say because we realize that the lives of
[51:33] the people that we preach to are held in
[51:35] the balance we realize that when people
[51:37] leave the church they're either going to
[51:38] be better or worse when they go
[51:41] out right they're either going to be
[51:43] better or worse every service and we
[51:45] realize that and so we recognize that we
[51:48] hold that in the balance and so we want
[51:50] to make sure that we've got something to
[51:52] say that's going to help somebody so we
[51:54] don't spend our time all of our time in
[51:57] entertainment we don't spend all of our
[51:59] time out in the woods we don't spend all
[52:01] our time although that'd be a good place
[52:03] sometimes to pray but we don't spend all
[52:05] our time doing other things we spend our
[52:07] time in the in studying the word and the
[52:10] reason we do that and praying is so we
[52:12] have something to say when we get behind
[52:14] the pulpit so we maximize our time
[52:18] behind the pulpit it's not how long you
[52:19] preach but it's what you got to
[52:22] say so brother Brandon said if you're a
[52:24] preacher get you a Pulpit and and you
[52:26] know the quote and I won't read it all
[52:28] tonight but if you're if you're not he
[52:30] said you need to live your sermon now
[52:32] how many non preachers do we have here
[52:34] today you're not a preacher at least not
[52:37] yet right and so what are you supposed
[52:39] to do live your sermon live your sermon
[52:43] you say well if we had better sermons
[52:45] then maybe we'd be more a church that's
[52:47] more on fire well that's probably true
[52:50] and God help me to preach better but
[52:51] I'll say this if we had better living
[52:54] we'd probably we we'd probably have a
[52:56] whole lot more better church as well and
[52:58] we we want to be the best we can be
[53:00] don't we and so we want to we want to
[53:02] live our sermons we want our life to be
[53:05] a a preaching to the people around us
[53:07] let my life preach to my family let my
[53:09] life let my my my lived life as a
[53:12] husband preached to my wife and my lived
[53:15] life as a father preached to my
[53:17] children so if you don't if you're not a
[53:20] preacher don't try to be a
[53:22] preacher just live your sermon and
[53:26] brother br tells us he said you Brethren
[53:27] do that in your churches do that do what
[53:32] preach he said remember he said
[53:35] sometimes a lady tries to explain things
[53:36] so brother brandom teaches us and I'm
[53:38] just going through some principles here
[53:40] before we get to really what we want to
[53:41] talk about brother brandom tells us that
[53:44] if a preacher uh is uh if you don't know
[53:47] what you're talking about that you need
[53:49] to let somebody that does know what
[53:50] they're talking about
[53:53] talk right so you know I like to join
[53:56] conversations I don't know about you but
[53:58] I I enjoy that I I go up to some you
[54:00] know conversation going on and sometimes
[54:02] y'all are talking about hunting bow
[54:04] hunting or something like that and I'll
[54:05] sit there and Nod let's see if I know
[54:07] what you're talking about and I really
[54:08] don't have a
[54:10] clue right because I've never hunted
[54:13] maybe I shouldn't admit that I've hunted
[54:15] squirrels but I've never been out in the
[54:17] woods looking for a for a deer you may
[54:19] disown me from the message after that
[54:21] but I've never done that I don't
[54:23] understand the passion I don't
[54:25] understand it so you know what you're
[54:26] talking about I don't know what I'm
[54:27] talking about and I can join the
[54:30] conversation but I can really mess it up
[54:32] too because it'll it won't take you long
[54:35] to figure out that I don't know what I'm
[54:36] talking about and so if there's
[54:39] something you don't understand don't try
[54:41] to teach that to somebody else right if
[54:44] you don't understand it yourself but you
[54:46] but every one of us has the option of
[54:48] saying I may not understand it but I
[54:50] believe every word that the Bible says
[54:52] so I'm going to take you to my pastor
[54:54] I'm going to take you to somebody else
[54:56] who actually understands the word and
[54:58] knows these
[54:59] things right if we don't if we can't
[55:01] explain it we don't need to try we just
[55:03] need to believe it right and study it
[55:06] ourselves now you know maybe brother B
[55:09] said you might make a bigger mess than
[55:10] you ever was in and make somebody worse
[55:12] off than ever if you do that and so he
[55:15] said let the pastor do that because
[55:17] people tie you in knots because you
[55:18] don't understand what you're talking
[55:20] about so you got to be called to the
[55:23] ministry of the word right there there
[55:26] there's a difference in the ministry of
[55:27] the Saints and the ministry of the word
[55:30] you've got to be called to the ministry
[55:32] of the word Full Gospel businessmen in
[55:34] Jamaica when brother Brandon was there
[55:36] they tried to put businessmen in the
[55:38] pulpit and as the main speakers in the
[55:40] meeting and brand said the business men
[55:42] was trying to preach the gospel he said
[55:44] he's out of his place he said we
[55:46] preachers have had enough time to keep
[55:47] it level and he said they use every
[55:49] little influence they can find and every
[55:52] little technique this way and that way
[55:54] and keep it so scrupled up you don't
[55:55] know what to do right and and we got a
[55:58] problem even even today pastors try to
[56:01] use influence and they try to use money
[56:03] and they try to use things like that why
[56:05] they're businessmen at
[56:07] heart right and they don't really care
[56:09] about the people it's not about that
[56:10] it's about how can I use this situation
[56:13] but I'm here to tell you if you get a
[56:14] god- calleded man and God called Men
[56:16] Behind the pulpit they'll care about you
[56:18] not about your money not about what you
[56:21] can do but about you God help us to be
[56:24] that way today
[56:26] so he said they keep it so scrupled up
[56:28] he said but the thing to do is protect
[56:29] the message and the way it's going stay
[56:31] right with it and knock everything away
[56:33] from it how many want to do that tonight
[56:34] I just want to I just want to block for
[56:36] the one carrying the ball I want to
[56:39] block for the message of the hour I I
[56:40] don't see myself as having a message I
[56:43] there's been a message coming my day and
[56:45] I want to block for
[56:47] it so brother brandom talked about these
[56:50] businessmen and he said Brethren there's
[56:52] something wrong you fellas are
[56:53] businessmen he said the first place you
[56:55] don't don't understand the approach
[56:59] because there's an approach to
[57:01] Ministry you don't understand the
[57:03] approach because the ministry is a
[57:06] god-called gift we don't just walk up
[57:09] here and start
[57:12] talking but it's hours of preparation
[57:15] hours of prayer are you with me now time
[57:19] spent with God time spent studying over
[57:22] what would help the church and I don't
[57:24] just walk up here and say something but
[57:25] it's time to that we spend in doing that
[57:28] and so it's a Ministry and it's a burden
[57:32] and sometimes I wish I didn't have to do
[57:33] it but I'm compelled to do it you might
[57:37] be able to talk real good but you don't
[57:40] understand the approach of the ministry
[57:42] without being gifted to that and so
[57:44] brother brandom taught us that God s in
[57:46] the church Apostles and Prophets and
[57:48] teachers evangelists and pastors where
[57:49] didd he get that Ephesians 4:11 he said
[57:52] God set them in there for the perfecting
[57:53] of the church but he told us that we
[57:56] could all
[57:57] testify right don't try to be a preacher
[58:00] live your message but if you want to if
[58:02] you want to help somebody be like the
[58:04] woman at the well and tell what God did
[58:06] for you and she may not have known
[58:08] everything but when the son of man was
[58:10] revealed to her she said I know one
[58:12] thing this is the one come see a man
[58:15] that told me the secrets of my heart
[58:17] listen if your life has ever been
[58:18] changed by the word of God you can
[58:20] testify and tell others come see a man
[58:23] every one of us ought to be able to do
[58:25] that that's not just reserved for the
[58:27] men that's not just reserved for the for
[58:29] the ones who've been in church for 50
[58:31] years but that's each and every one of
[58:33] us can say come see a message come find
[58:36] the message that I found cuz it changed
[58:38] my life it made me different it brought
[58:41] me into a new place in
[58:43] Christ every one of us ought to do
[58:48] that that's what the house of stefanus
[58:51] was addicted
[58:52] to not to
[58:54] preaching but to Ministry of the
[58:57] Saints it didn't say they were addicted
[59:00] to the ministry of the word although
[59:01] that would be a good thing to be
[59:03] addicted to study and and to put your
[59:07] life into that but this was to the
[59:10] ministry of the
[59:12] Saints or the service of the Saints the
[59:16] Bible teaches us in 1 Corinthians
[59:18] 12:4 there are diversities of gifts but
[59:22] the Same Spirit there are differences of
[59:25] administration
[59:27] but the same lord and there are
[59:29] diversities of operations but it is the
[59:32] same God which worketh all and all what
[59:35] notice what Paul recognizes differences
[59:37] in gifts the word there is
[59:40] charisma that's where we get the word
[59:42] charismatic because they believe in the
[59:43] gifts so are are you with me this
[59:46] afternoon I know Sunday afternoon is
[59:49] hard that's why I've been trying to
[59:50] preach more of them because I'm trying
[59:52] to take the load off these other
[59:54] brothers that and I just got in from
[59:56] Branson this morning from that meeting
[59:59] so gifts are
[1:00:00] Charisma administrations is De it's
[1:00:05] deacons
[1:00:07] administrations operations is enima
[1:00:09] which is activity so there's a
[1:00:12] difference in how you're are gifted how
[1:00:14] you serve and with what effort you
[1:00:18] serve right and we've all seen that
[1:00:21] right this is just common sense stuff
[1:00:23] Paul says there's a difference in gifts
[1:00:26] right because even among evangelists
[1:00:28] there's different kinds of
[1:00:30] evangelists even among pastors there's
[1:00:33] one Pastor who's real quiet and one
[1:00:35] who's real loud and one who cries all
[1:00:37] the time and one who hardly ever cries
[1:00:39] and and and that's not what we judge it
[1:00:42] by we judge it by the word right and and
[1:00:45] the results the fruit that the man bears
[1:00:47] in his life but we don't judge it by the
[1:00:49] diversity of the gift but it's all the
[1:00:52] same spirit so there's a difference in
[1:00:55] gifts there's a difference in
[1:00:56] administrations there's a difference in
[1:00:59] uh in service so we're not all called to
[1:01:01] do the same thing but we are all called
[1:01:04] to do
[1:01:06] something right we're all called to do
[1:01:09] something but we're not all called to do
[1:01:12] the same something so then operations is
[1:01:16] is effort so even if you had somebody
[1:01:19] who was now who is gifted in a certain
[1:01:22] way and maybe they're gifted in a
[1:01:25] similar way to some somebody else then
[1:01:27] you look and see that they're not only
[1:01:29] gifted in a certain way but they serve
[1:01:30] in a certain capacity so say he's a
[1:01:33] pastor or an evangelist or a deacon so
[1:01:36] they're both gifted the same way they
[1:01:37] both have the same uh same gift they
[1:01:39] both have the same
[1:01:41] Administration but then there's a
[1:01:43] difference in
[1:01:45] effort right and the effort is what's
[1:01:47] going to make the difference in how the
[1:01:48] people are
[1:01:51] helped are you with me now I say we
[1:01:53] might as well give it all to Christ
[1:01:56] we might as well give everything that
[1:01:57] we've got because some people can be
[1:02:00] gifted and have uh administrations and
[1:02:03] have gifts like that but not put in the
[1:02:05] effort that's needed in that gift I say
[1:02:08] whatever gift it is that you've been
[1:02:10] given whatever calling that you have
[1:02:12] whatever way that you can serve you
[1:02:14] ought to give everything that you have
[1:02:16] it would be a shame to to whatever gift
[1:02:19] that we have to mail it in because we
[1:02:21] thought well it doesn't matter anyhow he
[1:02:23] wouldn't have given you the gift if it
[1:02:24] didn't matter he wouldn't have made you
[1:02:27] you if you didn't matter brother Landon
[1:02:28] he's got something for you to do he
[1:02:30] wouldn't have made you Landon if you if
[1:02:32] you didn't if there wasn't something you
[1:02:33] could do he put you he made you a
[1:02:36] certain way so that you would have a
[1:02:37] certain gift and we need to put all the
[1:02:39] effort we can into that right that's
[1:02:42] most what makes the difference many
[1:02:43] times in a successful Ministry and a
[1:02:46] failed
[1:02:47] Ministry is
[1:02:49] effort it's
[1:02:51] true there's nine spiritual gifts we
[1:02:54] know that five Ministry gifts countless
[1:02:56] other
[1:02:57] Ministries that keep the church going
[1:03:00] brother brandom says each one of us
[1:03:02] someone say each
[1:03:04] one each one of us has a different
[1:03:08] Ministry you ever think about you coming
[1:03:11] to church as a
[1:03:15] minister that gonna get real quiet after
[1:03:17] a
[1:03:19] while think about it see I come to
[1:03:22] church I pray all right I get here two
[1:03:25] hours early
[1:03:26] usually and I try to pray and I'm not
[1:03:29] saying that to brag it's just because I
[1:03:30] feel it's necessary cuz I tell you what
[1:03:33] I got to do is I got to get me out of
[1:03:34] the
[1:03:35] way right if I get too much in the way
[1:03:37] there's going to be problems in the
[1:03:39] service and I got a lot more to get out
[1:03:41] of the way than some other people do
[1:03:43] there's a lot more of me so I need I I
[1:03:46] need to work to get myself out of the
[1:03:48] way but if you ever thought about what
[1:03:50] you do in the church as a Ministry to
[1:03:54] the Saints
[1:03:56] a Ministry to the Saints so it's
[1:03:59] something that you do for the Saints and
[1:04:02] you might be a young person today say
[1:04:03] well I I don't really do anything but
[1:04:05] you do have some Ministry to the Saints
[1:04:09] you say well I don't even talk much you
[1:04:11] do have some Ministry to the Saints
[1:04:14] because there's a lot more Ministries
[1:04:16] than what you realize brother Brandon
[1:04:18] says he says each one of you is a
[1:04:20] Ministry a separate Ministry all that
[1:04:22] comes into Christ how many are in Christ
[1:04:24] tonight you believe you're in Christ
[1:04:26] then you have a
[1:04:28] Ministry all that are in Christ has a
[1:04:31] Ministry he said not all will have a
[1:04:33] Ministry all has a Ministry he said not
[1:04:36] only the preacher but you have a
[1:04:38] Ministry to something you have a
[1:04:40] Ministry to something something you can
[1:04:42] do he said and I hope this don't sound
[1:04:44] sacrilegious but usually God has to
[1:04:47] drive you into your correct Ministry so
[1:04:51] it's not usually you that's looking for
[1:04:53] it it's not you that's trying to be a
[1:04:55] pastor trying to be a teacher or trying
[1:04:56] to be a deacon or something like that
[1:04:59] but he said usually God has to drive you
[1:05:02] into your correct Ministry look what he
[1:05:05] had to do to Paul Paul didn't he wasn't
[1:05:07] looking for God he thought he had God he
[1:05:10] thought he he learned everything there
[1:05:11] was to learn and he knew everything
[1:05:12] there was to know and God put him in
[1:05:14] such a place where he had to cry out to
[1:05:16] God he said Lord is it you and God said
[1:05:19] Paul it's hard for you to kick against
[1:05:21] the Pricks he said I got something a
[1:05:23] Ministry for you in your life and it's
[1:05:25] it's hard for you to just keep sitting
[1:05:27] there and acting like you're you're a
[1:05:29] bump on a log it's hard for you to keep
[1:05:32] resisting my will Paul it's time for you
[1:05:35] to step into what God has called you to
[1:05:37] do and to do that Paul you need to be
[1:05:40] filled with the Holy Ghost so go up to a
[1:05:42] street called straight and meet a man
[1:05:43] named ananas so you can be filled with
[1:05:45] the Holy Ghost so you can do your
[1:05:47] ministry I think it's about time we get
[1:05:49] some people fill with the Holy Ghost so
[1:05:51] we can do our Ministries
[1:05:57] each
[1:05:58] individual I want you to make this very
[1:06:00] personal
[1:06:01] tonight has a specific and
[1:06:04] peculiar
[1:06:06] Ministry something only you can
[1:06:12] do now brother brandom tells us that
[1:06:15] we're not like the Catholic Church where
[1:06:18] somebody just tells us what to do and we
[1:06:19] do it right that's not who we are what
[1:06:23] we are is is we're son of God and he
[1:06:27] says The Great I Am the almighty God has
[1:06:30] come as Spirit to fill his true church
[1:06:33] he said he has a right to move anywhere
[1:06:35] he wants to and upon
[1:06:38] anybody he wants to we don't make any
[1:06:42] holy men amongst
[1:06:44] us right so again I'm not the only
[1:06:47] Minister here
[1:06:48] tonight every one of us are
[1:06:50] ministers every one of us we may not be
[1:06:53] Ministers of the word but we're minister
[1:06:55] miners of something we're ministers to
[1:06:58] the body of Christ look he said we don't
[1:07:01] make any holy men but the whole true
[1:07:03] Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because
[1:07:07] of the presence of the Holy Spirit it is
[1:07:10] he the holy spirit that is Holy he said
[1:07:12] not the congregation of itself now I
[1:07:15] begin thinking about this and I begin to
[1:07:17] think what are some Ministries in the
[1:07:20] congregation whether there's a Ministry
[1:07:21] of giving right there are some people
[1:07:24] who are anointed to keep the lights
[1:07:27] on right they're anointed in business
[1:07:29] they're anointed in that way and again
[1:07:31] you can't look at somebody else who's
[1:07:32] anointed in that way and say I wish I
[1:07:34] was more that way I wish I had more
[1:07:36] money to give no you do what God's
[1:07:37] called you to do right but some people
[1:07:40] are anointed in that way and they may
[1:07:42] sit back and think well you know I never
[1:07:44] get to I never get to do this or that in
[1:07:46] the church but they're Anointed with
[1:07:47] something that help that they can help
[1:07:49] the body of Christ and they don't even
[1:07:51] realize how much they help the body of
[1:07:53] Christ but they're just anointing Ed
[1:07:55] with a Ministry of giving maybe not just
[1:07:57] giving to the church but giving to one
[1:07:59] another Anointed with the ability to see
[1:08:03] a need and go feel that need I pray
[1:08:05] there' be more of us Anointed with that
[1:08:06] Ministry today right and I've seen some
[1:08:09] of you and I don't want to start calling
[1:08:11] names because I'll I'll make you know
[1:08:13] you you tend to make people wonder well
[1:08:15] when is he going to call my name but
[1:08:17] I've seen some of you that have a
[1:08:18] Ministry of giving and you just know
[1:08:21] when it's when there's something that's
[1:08:23] needed and you give that something
[1:08:25] there's a Ministry of
[1:08:27] hospitality right some people can make
[1:08:29] people feel welcome and it's harder for
[1:08:33] others it's more difficult for others I
[1:08:35] think young men need to learn how to be
[1:08:38] hospitable you young people need to
[1:08:40] learn how to be hospitable something we
[1:08:41] learn right it's not something that
[1:08:43] comes naturally to everybody and yet
[1:08:45] there are some people gifted or that
[1:08:47] have a service a type of ministry that
[1:08:50] they do they just open up their home and
[1:08:52] they open up I believe my wife just I'll
[1:08:54] mention her uh because uh God gave me a
[1:08:57] good wife I believe she has a Ministry
[1:08:58] of hospitality that that she just wants
[1:09:01] to do and she knows how to take care of
[1:09:02] people and and take care of food and
[1:09:04] things like that and there's a Ministry
[1:09:06] of prayer how many believe that tonight
[1:09:09] A Ministry of prayer oh I pray there'd
[1:09:12] be more there'd be more Prayer Warriors
[1:09:14] come out of the church we got some but
[1:09:16] I've noticed a lot of the prayer
[1:09:17] warriors are getting older it's time for
[1:09:19] the young people to step up and be
[1:09:20] prayer
[1:09:21] warriors right be people who pray and
[1:09:24] cry out to God for the service that's
[1:09:26] coming what would we do without some of
[1:09:28] our elders who cry out to God and hold
[1:09:30] on the horns of the Altar and say Lord I
[1:09:32] want to see these young people help what
[1:09:34] would you do without that I pray God
[1:09:36] would raise up another generation of
[1:09:38] Prayer Warriors that could stand in the
[1:09:40] Gap and be and do their Ministry of
[1:09:44] prayer there's ministries of
[1:09:48] cleaning huh right we don't hand out
[1:09:51] titles because that's not what it's
[1:09:53] about
[1:09:56] but some people are just just have the
[1:09:58] neck and the ability and the time maybe
[1:10:01] to help clean the
[1:10:03] church some people have a ministry of
[1:10:06] food praise God for
[1:10:10] that and there's others who
[1:10:14] don't right and maybe that's not your
[1:10:16] ministry but you sure benefit from it
[1:10:19] right and so a person whose Ministry
[1:10:22] might be cleaning their Ministry is not
[1:10:23] cooking food but they can clean my
[1:10:26] Ministry is neither
[1:10:29] one but you know I'll do it but that's
[1:10:32] not my ministry right but but but some
[1:10:35] of y'all you know it's just there's
[1:10:36] something about it it's easy for you to
[1:10:38] clean you enjoy that but you hate to
[1:10:39] cook and some of you hate to clean but
[1:10:41] you love to cook my mother's like that
[1:10:44] she's not here so I can talk about
[1:10:46] her mom always kept a clean house but if
[1:10:49] she cooks it's a
[1:10:51] mess and and because she got a ministry
[1:10:53] of
[1:10:54] food are you with me now many of you do
[1:10:57] thank God for that we got Ministries
[1:11:00] with the youth it's a Ministry it's a
[1:11:03] burden that comes on your heart see I
[1:11:05] want to help our young people let me
[1:11:06] just talk about that for a minute we
[1:11:08] need more people to step up and realize
[1:11:10] what our young people are going through
[1:11:12] it's one thing to criticize them it's
[1:11:13] another thing to step there and say what
[1:11:15] can I do how can I open up my home say
[1:11:18] brother Ben we need to have more youth
[1:11:19] meetings while I'm waiting on somebody
[1:11:20] to call one are you with me now we can
[1:11:24] have the youth over to our house that'd
[1:11:26] be all right we we can we can help the
[1:11:28] young people we can we can give them an
[1:11:30] encouraging word there's people that
[1:11:32] have a Ministry for that they they
[1:11:34] understand young people I know there's
[1:11:35] some people don't like to be around
[1:11:37] young people make them nervous and
[1:11:38] that's okay but there's some who have a
[1:11:40] Ministry for it and thank God somebody
[1:11:43] opened up their home to you when you
[1:11:44] were young and somebody helped you if
[1:11:46] you were raised in the church when you
[1:11:47] were young thank God somebody did that
[1:11:49] that's a
[1:11:50] Ministry oh my it's a
[1:11:52] Ministry there's a Ministry of music
[1:11:56] here in the church that's a Ministry
[1:11:57] aren't you glad for our music that's a
[1:12:00] Ministry it's not something that just
[1:12:02] happens it's not something that you can
[1:12:04] just achieve if you've never practiced
[1:12:06] it's a Ministry of music and it has to
[1:12:08] be prayerful and it has to be uh
[1:12:10] somebody with a consecrated life we
[1:12:12] don't just throw anybody up here we put
[1:12:14] people up here that we believe are are
[1:12:16] just as consecrated as the minister as
[1:12:18] the pastor's consecrated as the
[1:12:20] associate as the Deacon as brother
[1:12:22] Stewart all the brothers are consecrated
[1:12:24] these Ministers of music are just as
[1:12:26] consecrated what are they doing they're
[1:12:28] ministering to the lord they're
[1:12:29] providing a service to God and to God's
[1:12:33] people
[1:12:35] hallelujah there's Ministries back there
[1:12:37] in the
[1:12:38] back right and our young people have
[1:12:40] taken the brunt of that over the
[1:12:44] last uh five years since I've been here
[1:12:48] my kids have been back there and then
[1:12:49] others have joined them the young people
[1:12:51] have joined them I say you know maybe
[1:12:53] some of us adults need to recogn ize
[1:12:55] that and sometimes we get we stay home
[1:12:57] on Wednesdays maybe because you're tired
[1:12:59] and that's sometimes you get sick and
[1:13:00] you can't come but you like to be able
[1:13:02] to stream don't
[1:13:03] you huh somebody does
[1:13:07] that these young men sitting up here do
[1:13:09] that those ladies in the back do that
[1:13:12] but Justin P's helping us uh whenever we
[1:13:15] can on on uh on sound here in the church
[1:13:17] somebody's got to do that but the Gabe
[1:13:20] when he when he's able to be here and
[1:13:21] he's here most of the time he helps us
[1:13:24] with that so there's there a Ministry of
[1:13:25] that there's Ministries in the uh in the
[1:13:28] sound booth Ministries the video he said
[1:13:30] that stuff doesn't matter we could just
[1:13:31] shut it all off well you'd appreciate it
[1:13:33] if you had to use
[1:13:35] it if you were shut in and not able to
[1:13:37] come to church you'd appreciate that
[1:13:39] Ministry being there oh that somebody
[1:13:41] had it on their heart and that's what we
[1:13:43] want it to be and that's why I want to
[1:13:44] present it this way I don't want it just
[1:13:46] to be a drudgery I don't want somebody
[1:13:48] to do it just because I asked them to do
[1:13:50] it or because they had to do it but
[1:13:51] something that's on your heart say you
[1:13:53] know what I think I'll help the Young
[1:13:55] people tonight I think I'll learn how to
[1:13:56] do something in the church so some of
[1:13:58] the young people can sit out front and
[1:14:00] say Amen
[1:14:04] loudly I think I'll just help out I
[1:14:06] think I'll I think I'll I think I'll
[1:14:08] help maybe the musicians or help do
[1:14:10] something on that and sometimes if we're
[1:14:11] not gifted to it we can't be much help
[1:14:13] but if you are gifted to it if you're
[1:14:15] gifted to singing special songs for
[1:14:17] goodness sake start
[1:14:19] singing are you with me
[1:14:23] now we need more music we need and and
[1:14:26] nobody's going to come to you and and
[1:14:27] beg you to do it right it's got to be
[1:14:30] something that you want to do in your
[1:14:32] heart there's got to be something in
[1:14:34] your heart says Lord I want this to be a
[1:14:37] good service listen you can have a good
[1:14:39] service or you can have a bad service
[1:14:40] you get to
[1:14:44] choose there's a Ministry of
[1:14:49] amens oh that God would call an
[1:14:53] army of Amen
[1:14:57] ERS I wish these young people you know
[1:15:00] some of them you know what happens is
[1:15:01] they get and that's why sometimes they
[1:15:02] come back from camp and they're all
[1:15:03] excited and then they get around us and
[1:15:05] they're like
[1:15:09] well come on Church there's a Ministry
[1:15:12] of
[1:15:14] amens there's something that that
[1:15:16] happens brother brandom says and I know
[1:15:18] people don't like it but brother random
[1:15:19] said that when he said he said that man
[1:15:21] come to him and said how can you preach
[1:15:22] with them people screaming like that he
[1:15:24] said that makes chills run up my back
[1:15:26] and brother Brandon said I can't hardly
[1:15:27] preach if they don't do it he said by
[1:15:30] the way if you make it to Heaven you'll
[1:15:31] freeze to
[1:15:32] death are you with me now he said I had
[1:15:35] an old dog named Fritz excuse me sister
[1:15:37] Fritz but he said I had an old dog named
[1:15:39] Fritz and he said I would he said I
[1:15:41] would send that dog after a skunk he
[1:15:43] said he tree just about anything go in
[1:15:45] after anything but a skunk and with a
[1:15:47] skunk he had to have a little bit of
[1:15:50] encouragement amen so so oh old Fritz
[1:15:54] would run down to the to the hole where
[1:15:57] the skunk he just stand there and
[1:15:58] brother brand said sick them boy what
[1:16:01] was he doing he's saying say
[1:16:05] Amen sick them boy it's not wrong for a
[1:16:07] preacher to do that to pull for amens
[1:16:10] why because that's what he was doing to
[1:16:12] the dog he had to give it some
[1:16:13] encouragement can anybody say Amen can
[1:16:16] can I get an amen what's he doing he's
[1:16:18] he's pulling that from the dog he's
[1:16:20] encouraging that dog and that dog go
[1:16:21] right in after him and and that's
[1:16:23] brother brandom actually tped the
[1:16:25] preacher to the dog in the way that he
[1:16:26] typed it actually the preacher is going
[1:16:28] in after it because the people are
[1:16:29] saying sick them
[1:16:32] boy oh we need a hundred more you know
[1:16:34] how much better Services would be if we'
[1:16:37] lift our voice every now and then and
[1:16:39] say go after that devil go get him I
[1:16:41] know somebody that needs that and it's
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:45] me not everybody's loud but some people
[1:16:47] have a Ministry of amens and they need
[1:16:49] to quit hiding their light under a
[1:16:51] bushel
[1:16:57] huh I can mention many more but you get
[1:17:00] the
[1:17:01] idea you might say brother Ben I'd like
[1:17:03] to do something but I don't know what to
[1:17:06] do do what you can
[1:17:08] do and do that until you find God's
[1:17:11] perfect
[1:17:13] will I I made some services I don't I
[1:17:16] don't do anything I I sit here and I
[1:17:18] watch everything just run so perfectly
[1:17:19] and I sitting there and think thank God
[1:17:21] I'm so happy to be here you know but I
[1:17:23] still try to back to preach
[1:17:25] whether I feel good or whether I don't
[1:17:27] whether I'm sick or whether I'm not
[1:17:28] still trying to back the preacher and
[1:17:30] I'll tell you what I can do I can pick
[1:17:31] up trash on the parking
[1:17:33] lot are you with me
[1:17:36] now somebody's got to do it and so when
[1:17:39] I'm not doing what I'm called to do let
[1:17:41] me do what I can
[1:17:43] do and be willing to volunteer when I
[1:17:47] see a need and I think of Simon and I've
[1:17:49] preached to you about him many times
[1:17:51] before but it's special to me Simon in
[1:17:53] the Bible had a Ministry of cross
[1:17:55] carrying but he didn't know what his
[1:17:57] ministry was going to be he had no clue
[1:18:00] he was probably a middle-aged man and he
[1:18:02] didn't have a clue what his ministry
[1:18:04] would be he had come to Jerusalem for
[1:18:06] some reason maybe he was a a prite from
[1:18:09] he was a black man from Africa maybe he
[1:18:11] was a prite to the Jewish religion and
[1:18:13] he'd come down there for the festival or
[1:18:15] maybe come down on some kind of business
[1:18:17] and he'd come down into the City and the
[1:18:19] Bible tells us that that he met Jesus at
[1:18:21] a
[1:18:22] Crossroads he met him at an intersection
[1:18:25] and when he saw him Jesus at that moment
[1:18:28] had fallen down because he was too weak
[1:18:30] to carry the cross and if he didn't
[1:18:32] carry the cross what would happen our
[1:18:34] sins wouldn't be forgiven nothing about
[1:18:36] us would be changed we'd be the same as
[1:18:38] we always were we'd still be a bunch of
[1:18:40] heathens out there the world as we know
[1:18:42] it wouldn't exist there would be no love
[1:18:44] and joy and peace flowing from the from
[1:18:46] the throne because the cross would not
[1:18:48] have paid for our sins but because Simon
[1:18:51] carried the cross he didn't know that
[1:18:53] would be his ministry but what did he do
[1:18:55] he saw a need and somebody asked him to
[1:18:58] do it and he did
[1:19:03] it why he could do
[1:19:06] it he was
[1:19:09] able he was compelled to do
[1:19:12] it a soldier doesn't fight because he
[1:19:17] wants to not often he fights because
[1:19:20] it's his
[1:19:21] duty and he fights for the person beside
[1:19:24] him
[1:19:26] listen to me young men fight for your
[1:19:28] brothers huh you young ladies fight for
[1:19:31] your
[1:19:33] sisters you said I don't feel like much
[1:19:35] going like going to church today fight
[1:19:37] for somebody sitting beside
[1:19:39] you I don't feel like getting into the
[1:19:41] service today fight for the person in
[1:19:43] the Pew beside you fight for the pastor
[1:19:46] fight for his family fight for the
[1:19:48] church are you with me now fight for
[1:19:50] somebody else cuz they say when it
[1:19:53] really gets down to it why do Marines
[1:19:55] run to the sound of gunfire it's not
[1:19:57] because they're all patriotic and
[1:19:58] running into their country what are they
[1:20:00] doing there were some of you are
[1:20:01] veterans you know what I'm talking about
[1:20:03] you're doing it for that guy beside you
[1:20:05] you don't want to let him down the
[1:20:07] Romans would actually set up their
[1:20:08] Legions in a what was called a Turtle
[1:20:10] formation and they would set him up and
[1:20:12] they each one would have a shield but he
[1:20:13] didn't hold the shield over himself he
[1:20:16] would hold it over his brother over his
[1:20:19] friend and so each one was interested in
[1:20:21] keeping his friend and his cohort there
[1:20:24] in the army he was interested in keeping
[1:20:26] him strong he was interested you know
[1:20:27] they they get together for breakfast and
[1:20:29] this one's asking the other one saying
[1:20:31] what did you eat your weed said did you
[1:20:33] get plenty to eat why because he knew
[1:20:35] that that would be the arm that held the
[1:20:37] shield that protected him oh God if we
[1:20:39] could only realize in the church many
[1:20:41] times when we help somebody else we're
[1:20:43] actually strengthening the arm that
[1:20:45] helps us we don't just go to church for
[1:20:48] ourselves where did we ever get that
[1:20:50] idea
[1:20:55] where we ever get the idea that church
[1:20:57] was just a place like a candy store
[1:20:59] where we went and bought some peace and
[1:21:01] some love and some joy and took it home
[1:21:04] and didn't share
[1:21:06] it church is a place of
[1:21:09] service service to God and service to
[1:21:12] one
[1:21:14] another see when you're when you're
[1:21:17] compelled you don't quit you don't just
[1:21:18] quit the
[1:21:20] Army and we're in the army of the Lord
[1:21:24] brother brandom you know you know how
[1:21:27] hard he fought who' he do that for read
[1:21:31] Malachi 4 behold I send
[1:21:35] you me that means a lot to
[1:21:41] me that God sent a prophet for
[1:21:45] me and he went through what he went
[1:21:47] through for me and that happened in our
[1:21:49] generation he couldn't die for you Jesus
[1:21:52] died for you but I'm glad for what he
[1:21:53] did do he did what could do he was
[1:21:56] called to be a
[1:21:59] prophet brother brandham said this at
[1:22:01] the end of his life story and I've
[1:22:03] probably read it to you before but it's
[1:22:05] just stirring in my heart today brother
[1:22:07] brand was praying and he got to where he
[1:22:09] couldn't talk no more because he was so
[1:22:11] broke up remembering his wife that had
[1:22:13] died and his daughter that had died you
[1:22:16] think God's people don't go through
[1:22:17] something just look at a prophet look
[1:22:20] what God let him go through what's he
[1:22:21] doing he's molding your
[1:22:23] character he's not God is way more
[1:22:26] interested in your character than he is
[1:22:27] your bank account he's way more
[1:22:29] interested in your character than he is
[1:22:31] something else going on and whether or
[1:22:33] not you're at ease and whether you're
[1:22:34] not you you got a new dishwasher or a
[1:22:36] new he's way more interested in your
[1:22:38] character so sometimes he allows those
[1:22:40] things to be held from us while he works
[1:22:43] on us and brother brandom remember he
[1:22:46] telling the story about how his baby had
[1:22:48] been there and and that that black sheet
[1:22:50] went down God had answered his prayers
[1:22:52] many times for babies but would not in
[1:22:55] that
[1:22:57] occasion and it touched him so much he
[1:23:00] saw his baby's eyes crossed with pain
[1:23:02] and he said that he said if ever a
[1:23:04] cross-eyed baby come in the prayer line
[1:23:05] he said they didn't even have to be
[1:23:07] prayed for they were
[1:23:10] healed because he had a little
[1:23:11] compassion in him because of what he'd
[1:23:14] been
[1:23:15] through he says oh God have mercy I just
[1:23:19] think back across the streaks of tears
[1:23:21] and heartaches and
[1:23:23] troubles oh father I'm ashamed of all my
[1:23:26] life he said why didn't I know you
[1:23:28] before other words he was so so broken
[1:23:32] by all of his life and things he and
[1:23:34] brother BR started serving God as a
[1:23:35] relatively young man but he said oh but
[1:23:38] in one place he said if I was raised in
[1:23:39] a Christian home he said I could have
[1:23:41] been a lot farther
[1:23:43] along some of you you don't know the
[1:23:45] opportunity that lays before you and
[1:23:48] brother Brandon says oh father he said
[1:23:50] I'm ashamed of all my life why didn't I
[1:23:52] know you before and I've tried with all
[1:23:54] all my heart dear Jesus to live for you
[1:23:57] I wonder how many of us can say that
[1:23:59] tonight I I hope it's me I hope it's you
[1:24:02] I've tried with all my heart dear that
[1:24:04] don't mean you've never made a mistake
[1:24:06] brother Brandon made mistakes
[1:24:07] everybody's made mistakes but
[1:24:10] Jesus but I've tried with all of my
[1:24:13] heart to live for you to do the thing
[1:24:18] what thing what needed to be done what I
[1:24:20] was called to
[1:24:22] do oh Church
[1:24:25] let me do it with all of my heart as a
[1:24:27] pastor I want to rededicate myself to
[1:24:29] doing everything that I can to preaching
[1:24:31] as hard as I can to to to to counseling
[1:24:34] as much as I can to working as much as I
[1:24:36] can for you to helping to studying as
[1:24:38] much as I can to picking up trash as
[1:24:40] much as I can what can I
[1:24:44] do what can I do let me have that kind
[1:24:47] of a
[1:24:49] heart God help us today we get caught up
[1:24:53] with friends we get caught up in with
[1:24:54] entertainment we call but Lord what can
[1:24:56] I do for
[1:25:01] you oh if you children could be raised
[1:25:03] if you young people could be raised with
[1:25:05] a harder service think what this church
[1:25:07] could
[1:25:09] be I love our church I love what it is
[1:25:12] but think how much better we could be
[1:25:13] what how much more we could be what how
[1:25:15] much we could grow I'm not talking about
[1:25:17] in numbers but I'm talking about in
[1:25:19] stature and in power as a Powerhouse of
[1:25:21] the Living God think what we could be if
[1:25:24] each one of us was addicted to the
[1:25:25] ministry of the
[1:25:31] Saints brother brandom says I don't care
[1:25:34] no matter what this cross is or how
[1:25:37] scornful it seems to be I love you dear
[1:25:41] Jesus you've broken my heart over and
[1:25:46] over here's the attitude to have
[1:25:49] church but I love you for it
[1:25:55] because without the Heartbreak I
[1:25:56] couldn't help
[1:25:57] people without being raised the way I
[1:26:00] was raised I might not be able to help
[1:26:04] people and if we ever get the attitude
[1:26:07] of receiving just to the point where
[1:26:09] we're just wait watching for people not
[1:26:12] to help us we're waiting and saying why
[1:26:14] don't anybody help me why don't anybody
[1:26:15] help me help
[1:26:18] somebody in the meantime while you're
[1:26:20] waiting on someone to help you do what
[1:26:23] you can
[1:26:24] say all I do is Tinker with engines find
[1:26:27] an engine to Tinker with that would help
[1:26:30] somebody all I can do is work well work
[1:26:32] with all of your heart I believe men
[1:26:34] ought to work with all of their
[1:26:36] heart huh not halfway it's a it's a
[1:26:40] sin to be
[1:26:42] lazy right because the Bible tells us a
[1:26:44] man won't provide for his own own is
[1:26:46] worse than an
[1:26:47] Infidel right but what do we do we do it
[1:26:49] with all our heart we may not be called
[1:26:52] to you know I don't know if anyone was
[1:26:54] ever called to work at
[1:26:56] McDonald's but I've been there and done
[1:27:01] it are you with me now that's not
[1:27:04] forever but do with all your
[1:27:08] heart why you work for the Lord the
[1:27:10] Bible says do it as unto the
[1:27:14] Lord you've broken my heart over and
[1:27:17] over but I love you for
[1:27:20] it oh Church
[1:27:26] the apostles one time come to Jesus and
[1:27:28] they they said 'lord increase our faith
[1:27:30] how many want to have more
[1:27:32] faith I think all of us do the Lord said
[1:27:36] if you had Faith as a grain of a mustard
[1:27:38] seed right that would be uncompromised
[1:27:41] faith that won't mix with anything also
[1:27:43] very small it's a very small seed he
[1:27:47] said you might say unto this pamine tree
[1:27:48] be thou plucked up by the root and be
[1:27:51] thou planted in the sea and it should
[1:27:52] obey you but he immediately goes into
[1:27:57] service because I think he recognizes
[1:27:59] that they're asking for something that
[1:28:03] would be you know where people could see
[1:28:06] that they had
[1:28:08] Faith right he said but which of you
[1:28:11] having a servant they they want to be
[1:28:13] thanked for their
[1:28:16] faith they want to be applauded for
[1:28:19] their faith he said' but which of you
[1:28:21] having a servant plowing or feeding
[1:28:23] cattle we'll say unto him by and by when
[1:28:25] he's come from the field go and sit down
[1:28:27] to meet so other words you go sit down
[1:28:30] and I'll take care of the
[1:28:32] oxen he's the
[1:28:35] servant are you with me now you don't
[1:28:38] say oh I I'll just let you off early and
[1:28:39] I'll take care of it now you might do
[1:28:41] that out of the goodness of your heart
[1:28:41] but you won't do it very
[1:28:43] often what right that's his
[1:28:46] job and we not rather saying to him make
[1:28:48] ready wherewith I may Su so he just got
[1:28:50] in from the field go clean yourself up
[1:28:52] and be a waiter
[1:28:54] guard thyself and serve me till I have
[1:28:57] eaten and drunken and afterward Thou
[1:28:58] shalt eat and drink do he think that
[1:29:00] servant because he did the things that
[1:29:02] were commanded him he said I TR not he's
[1:29:04] talking about natural people right
[1:29:06] talking about carnal people the way they
[1:29:08] work you don't think people for doing
[1:29:10] that it's just what they do they're
[1:29:11] you're paying them for it huh he said so
[1:29:16] likewise ye I'm not saying you shouldn't
[1:29:18] thank them I'm saying it's the way
[1:29:19] people are so likewise ye said when you
[1:29:22] shall have done all those things which
[1:29:26] are commanded
[1:29:28] you I don't know if I've ever done
[1:29:32] that are you hearing me I don't know if
[1:29:34] I've ever done every single thing that
[1:29:36] God ever told me to do you said that's a
[1:29:39] shocking admission brother brandham
[1:29:41] didn't
[1:29:42] either that's why he didn't kill the
[1:29:44] brown bear go read the
[1:29:46] message he said he wasn't in the right
[1:29:48] place at the right time where God told
[1:29:50] him to
[1:29:52] be that's what he said
[1:29:55] right so what what was happening what's
[1:29:58] happening I don't think I've ever I
[1:29:59] don't think I've ever done everything
[1:30:01] but he said if you did do
[1:30:03] everything if you did everything to the
[1:30:06] letter that you've been commanded to do
[1:30:08] you say we are unprofitable servants we
[1:30:11] have done that which was our duty to do
[1:30:14] listen to me I will not be rewarded
[1:30:16] simply for
[1:30:19] preaching I that's what I was born to
[1:30:22] do not very well but that's what I was
[1:30:24] born to
[1:30:25] do right it's a gift it's predestined
[1:30:28] I'm not rewarded just for that where do
[1:30:31] my rewards come from from going above
[1:30:33] and
[1:30:34] beyond right from excelling from helping
[1:30:38] from lifting up the weak from binding up
[1:30:40] the broken heart that's where my reward
[1:30:42] comes from it's from that I don't know
[1:30:44] about you did you realize that we're
[1:30:46] going to a rewards banquet how many if
[1:30:48] you've ever been to a high school awards
[1:30:50] banquet and and you've ever sat there or
[1:30:52] with or we've been to Elementary School
[1:30:54] Banquets you know and or or something
[1:30:56] like that you sit there and you wait on
[1:30:57] your name to be called I remember one
[1:30:59] year excuse me Peter I one year uh Peter
[1:31:02] was in a Awards deal ceremony and we
[1:31:05] were sitting in the stands you know and
[1:31:06] I was so proud because I thought well
[1:31:07] he's done pretty good this year I think
[1:31:09] so I thought he's gonna get his name
[1:31:11] called and so they called the you know
[1:31:14] but I kind of thought about what his
[1:31:16] grade would be because he'd had some
[1:31:17] stuff he didn't get done so I thought
[1:31:19] you know what he'd always made the honor
[1:31:21] rooll and I thought well he'll make the
[1:31:24] be on a roll and so they called the be
[1:31:27] on a roll and he wasn't on
[1:31:29] it Oh I thought my goodness there's all
[1:31:34] these kids you know half the glasses on
[1:31:35] be on a roll at least it's a good story
[1:31:39] Peter don't be
[1:31:43] worried you probably remember it you
[1:31:45] were
[1:31:47] there and and then they did something
[1:31:50] else then they called the the aonor roll
[1:31:53] and I thought well surely the aonor roll
[1:31:57] he'll be on
[1:31:59] that and they called it and he wasn't
[1:32:03] there I thought well I gave
[1:32:07] up I thought well he's just not going to
[1:32:09] win anything this year I kind of I'll be
[1:32:10] honest with you I was a little
[1:32:12] mad because I know what he can
[1:32:15] do right the boy's got a 4.0 GPA when he
[1:32:18] when he studies you know when he does
[1:32:19] his work when he just does the
[1:32:21] work and and I know that and I just
[1:32:24] irritates me you know some of you
[1:32:26] parents know what I'm talking about this
[1:32:28] was many several years ago but he you
[1:32:31] know he wasn't on that role and I just
[1:32:32] quit paying attention and I saw him get
[1:32:34] up thought what happened well they
[1:32:36] called the A+ honor
[1:32:40] roll I'll be honest with with you when I
[1:32:42] get to heaven that's the one I want to
[1:32:43] be on I may not be but that's the one I
[1:32:46] want to strive
[1:32:48] for I want to be on that one I I want to
[1:32:51] go I want to go to the eight plus on a
[1:32:52] roll even the people give up on me even
[1:32:54] if people don't believe I can do it let
[1:32:56] me serve God in such a way let me tell
[1:32:58] you there's going to be some mothers
[1:32:59] here that are on the A+ honor roll in
[1:33:01] heaven there's going to be some Elders
[1:33:03] here who prayed with all of their heart
[1:33:04] who going to be on the A+ honor roll in
[1:33:08] heaven maybe some preachers down there
[1:33:10] on the I don't know if there's a c on a
[1:33:12] roll or a d on a roll but down there at
[1:33:15] the
[1:33:17] bottom because they didn't go above and
[1:33:19] beyond to help God's people say God help
[1:33:22] us today
[1:33:25] see the house of stefanus was addicted
[1:33:27] to
[1:33:28] Ministry are you still with me I got
[1:33:30] just a few more minutes because they
[1:33:33] were the first Christians in that part
[1:33:35] of Asia they did it because there was no
[1:33:38] one else to do it which is why Peter
[1:33:40] learned sound and video and Esther
[1:33:43] learned to run video and I'm just
[1:33:45] opening it up to you but why we do the
[1:33:47] things that we
[1:33:48] do because there was just nobody else to
[1:33:50] do it right and not because people
[1:33:52] people are busy and or they're older and
[1:33:55] it's very hard for sorry but it's very
[1:33:57] hard to teach some people how to work on
[1:33:58] electronics you know some of y'all could
[1:34:00] want so badly to help in that area and
[1:34:02] you just couldn't help but young minds
[1:34:04] are adaptable to that and so they helped
[1:34:08] in that why because there was nobody
[1:34:10] else to do it doesn't mean that's the
[1:34:13] only gift in their lives it just means
[1:34:14] that's what they did these other young
[1:34:15] people who helped brother trip and
[1:34:17] brother Landon and noie and Levi and the
[1:34:19] ones that have helped us so many times
[1:34:21] what have they helped for because
[1:34:22] they're they needed to
[1:34:24] it felt the need to step in but I wonder
[1:34:27] if maybe somebody could get a
[1:34:29] burden and give them a
[1:34:34] break they were
[1:34:36] compelled listen I was compelled I
[1:34:38] didn't want to be a preacher but it's
[1:34:40] just what I could do I'm being honest
[1:34:42] with you I was preaching before I had
[1:34:44] the Holy Ghost proof you can do it
[1:34:46] without
[1:34:48] it it was a
[1:34:51] gift but Jesus is our sample in Ministry
[1:34:54] look look what he did he he said Jesus
[1:34:58] called them to him and said to them you
[1:34:59] know they which are accounted to rule
[1:35:01] over the Gentiles exercise lordship over
[1:35:03] them and their great ones exercise
[1:35:04] Authority upon them but so shall it not
[1:35:07] be among you but whosoever will be great
[1:35:09] among you shall be your
[1:35:12] minister a Ministry to the Saints and
[1:35:15] whosoever you will be the chiefest shall
[1:35:17] be servant of all for even the son of
[1:35:19] man came not to be ministered unto he
[1:35:22] didn't come here to to be ministered
[1:35:24] unto but to minister to give his life
[1:35:27] for a ransom for many he did that and
[1:35:30] now we choose we want to minister to him
[1:35:32] because he came to
[1:35:34] minister oh
[1:35:36] church that kind of service is eternal
[1:35:39] life brother brand you say well I'm just
[1:35:42] not called to Ministry at all yes you
[1:35:44] are you're called to some kind of
[1:35:46] ministry everybody is because you have
[1:35:49] eternal life and brother brand said
[1:35:51] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:35:53] was spent for others that's perfectly
[1:35:55] eternal life when you say you go to
[1:35:57] church and you do good things that's
[1:35:58] fine but when you live your life to
[1:36:00] yourself you haven't eternal life
[1:36:02] eternal life is living for others it
[1:36:04] proved it when it come in the Lamb of
[1:36:06] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:36:08] because he did not live for himself you
[1:36:09] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:36:11] life by receiving that day that day on
[1:36:14] Calvary you don't live for yourself no
[1:36:16] more you live for
[1:36:17] others someone said how can you stand
[1:36:20] let anybody call you such bad names you
[1:36:21] don't live for yourself you live for
[1:36:23] others that you might redeem that man
[1:36:25] you become
[1:36:27] Sons Hallelujah he said the trouble of
[1:36:30] it is the church has forgot they were
[1:36:32] Sons you're a son you're taking Christ's
[1:36:34] place you're a son so don't live for
[1:36:36] yourself live for
[1:36:37] others listen who did he live and die
[1:36:39] for he lived and died for me for you he
[1:36:43] lived and died for the Gentiles who spat
[1:36:45] in his
[1:36:47] face the soldiers who beat him the
[1:36:50] Pharisees who crucified him said father
[1:36:53] forgive them they don't know they don't
[1:36:55] know what they did what they're
[1:36:57] doing what was it he he gave his life as
[1:37:01] a ransome for us oh my and brother
[1:37:05] brother we've got to follow that example
[1:37:07] the Bible says we must follow his
[1:37:08] example we must reckon ourselves dead
[1:37:11] and alive to Christ he said that he made
[1:37:13] the way that we could sacrifice oursel
[1:37:15] to his service to follow him if we
[1:37:17] follow him we lead the life that he
[1:37:19] lived there's no other way he said I am
[1:37:22] the way
[1:37:24] the truth and the life in Hebrews 5'8 it
[1:37:28] says he even learned obedience by the
[1:37:29] things which he suffered I don't even
[1:37:32] fully understand that but I believe it's
[1:37:36] true you said to look at somebody who
[1:37:38] gives his life and Spins his life for
[1:37:40] God's
[1:37:41] people
[1:37:42] and again I don't want to talk about it
[1:37:45] but it's just something that you do you
[1:37:47] just give your life and your life is
[1:37:48] going to meetings and helping people
[1:37:50] helping churches and and preaching and
[1:37:52] going and preaching and helping as much
[1:37:54] as you can if there's something that you
[1:37:55] need help with that I'm not helping you
[1:37:57] it's because I don't know about it and
[1:38:00] if I know about it I'll do my
[1:38:02] best I really will I really will do my
[1:38:05] best I may not be able to fix it but I
[1:38:07] want to at least be
[1:38:09] there but what is that we're trying to
[1:38:11] spend our lives you say what that's
[1:38:13] stupid but do you realize that if you
[1:38:15] just set yourself on a shelf you're
[1:38:16] going to
[1:38:18] rot there's a story about a great
[1:38:20] violinist that he said no one else is
[1:38:22] GNA ever touch my violin that's the way
[1:38:23] the Bas is gonna be when Al whenever
[1:38:25] Allison
[1:38:26] retires because she's really good at it
[1:38:29] you know and she could be like just set
[1:38:30] it up there and put it in a glass
[1:38:34] case and we'll feel like that because
[1:38:36] there's hardly anybody that can play the
[1:38:37] bass like that aren't you glad for good
[1:38:39] musicians I'm serious about that I go to
[1:38:42] churches all the time they can't play
[1:38:44] the
[1:38:44] bass so I'm glad we got a bass player
[1:38:48] but but if you set it on the Shelf you
[1:38:49] know what happens to it it rots and when
[1:38:53] the man set the violin on the Shelf
[1:38:55] pretty soon no one could have played it
[1:38:57] anyhow because if it's not used it'll
[1:39:00] fall out of service and it'll die and
[1:39:03] it'll rot listen to me Church I'd rather
[1:39:05] be
[1:39:06] used than to be in a glass case
[1:39:08] somewhere I'd rather be abused even I'd
[1:39:12] rather have people laugh at me and mock
[1:39:13] at me and everything else that they want
[1:39:15] to do but let me be used Lord I might do
[1:39:18] something wrong might do something
[1:39:20] that's not that's not even wouldn't be
[1:39:22] necessarily be right or and God will
[1:39:23] correct me on that but let me be used
[1:39:25] let me be somebody who gets up and tries
[1:39:30] again brother BR says just a life that
[1:39:32] lives in you you don't do it for
[1:39:33] Applause I'm skipping through these
[1:39:34] things now brother Robert you don't need
[1:39:36] Applause brother Robert sat back there
[1:39:37] for years and done that and I know
[1:39:39] that's very difficult for him to do but
[1:39:41] it's just it's a service it's something
[1:39:43] he can do he told me he want to keep
[1:39:44] doing it because it's something he can
[1:39:46] do oh I pray that we get that kind of
[1:39:47] Revelation
[1:39:49] tonight he said Christ just completely
[1:39:52] surrendered his life to God gave himself
[1:39:53] as a public servant to the people he
[1:39:55] gave his life freely he didn't have to
[1:39:57] do it he didn't begrudged do it he
[1:39:59] didn't say now Brethren you all ought to
[1:40:00] think a whole lot of me because I come
[1:40:01] to die for you he never said a word
[1:40:03] about it he died anyhow because it was
[1:40:05] God in
[1:40:06] him amen I'm going to skip on down
[1:40:10] listen they were addicted to Ministry a
[1:40:12] man who was addicted to alcohol will
[1:40:14] spend all that he has for one more
[1:40:17] bottle the will to have a drink is so
[1:40:20] much greater than the will than his will
[1:40:22] that he has no self-control and he'll
[1:40:24] tell you I want to quit but I
[1:40:27] can't don't ever start that's the best
[1:40:29] way to
[1:40:30] quit same with
[1:40:33] cigarettes but Jesus so surrendered his
[1:40:36] will to the father's will what was it he
[1:40:38] was
[1:40:38] addicted to
[1:40:41] Ministry to
[1:40:43] service this household of Stefanos was
[1:40:47] addicted and look at the difference it
[1:40:49] makes in your house it wasn't just his
[1:40:51] house I've said that many times about
[1:40:52] Simon Simon's children were known to the
[1:40:55] early church by on a firstname basis
[1:40:58] because they're written about in the
[1:40:59] scriptures because Simon carried the
[1:41:01] cross he made his family
[1:41:06] servants because stefanus addicted
[1:41:08] himself to the ministry of the Saints
[1:41:09] because they were the first ones in that
[1:41:11] area and they were just doing what jobs
[1:41:13] needed to be done what happened the
[1:41:15] people of God looked at them and said
[1:41:17] hey there's somebody and they actually
[1:41:19] got written about in the scriptures
[1:41:21] sometimes you don't have to preach to
[1:41:22] get noticed all you have to do is help
[1:41:25] people but we don't do it to get notice
[1:41:28] we do it because we
[1:41:30] must we're addicted to
[1:41:36] it Hebrews 12 tells us we look to him
[1:41:39] for an example the author and the
[1:41:41] finisher of our faith listen church I
[1:41:44] want to hear him say what he said in
[1:41:46] Matthew 25:21 well done how many want to
[1:41:49] hear that tonight well done thou good
[1:41:53] and faithful
[1:41:54] servant if you if you have a Bible that
[1:41:56] you mark in highlight that word
[1:41:58] faithful faithful we will be rewarded
[1:42:02] for our faithfulness not for our
[1:42:08] talent let me be spent in your service
[1:42:12] Lord Brother Ben why do you do what you
[1:42:14] do because it has to be
[1:42:15] done that's why I'm here in this
[1:42:19] church because I I felt the need I felt
[1:42:22] like it was God's will but I felt a need
[1:42:25] listen to me Church brother brand said
[1:42:27] nothing but lost souls musicians go
[1:42:29] ahead and come nothing but lost souls is
[1:42:31] the only thing that's got any value in
[1:42:34] it money passes away homes Decay and go
[1:42:39] away everything in the Earth moves
[1:42:45] away the only lasting value I'd rather
[1:42:48] have one soul in glory that I won to
[1:42:52] Christ to know and see that light of God
[1:42:55] circles around that Soul through all
[1:42:58] eternity he said my name to be
[1:43:02] associated with
[1:43:04] that well Paul what was the man's name
[1:43:07] that that met you in
[1:43:10] Africa Kenny Maya something like that
[1:43:14] brother Kenny we'll call him I don't
[1:43:17] know brother Kenny I've never met
[1:43:18] brother Kenny but but brother Paul son
[1:43:21] told me today that there's a G that he
[1:43:24] gave him I guess and he he has that on a
[1:43:27] mantle because Brother Paul's here today
[1:43:29] got baptized today because of a
[1:43:32] testimony of brother Kenny Who come out
[1:43:35] of the jungles of Africa sometime you
[1:43:37] need to tell the whole testimony but he
[1:43:38] come out of the jungles of Africa and
[1:43:41] and and felt led of the Lord to show up
[1:43:43] at Brother Paul's Place where he was
[1:43:45] managing in an oil in an oil rig and
[1:43:48] show up there and say the Lord told me
[1:43:49] you'd give me a job and sat there till
[1:43:52] he got the job
[1:43:53] is that right brother Kenny witnessed to
[1:43:56] brother Paul and Brother Paul's in
[1:43:59] church in Hardy Arkansas because brother
[1:44:01] Kenny was a servant we don't know if he
[1:44:03] was a preacher I don't know what else
[1:44:04] he's done but I'll tell you
[1:44:07] this all of his life Brother Paul's name
[1:44:11] will be associated with brother Kenny's
[1:44:13] name when we get a million years into
[1:44:17] Glory into heaven and we're sitting
[1:44:19] there a million years from now those two
[1:44:22] names will still be Associated together
[1:44:25] why because somebody took the time to
[1:44:28] not only tell brother Paul but to live
[1:44:30] the life and say that man was a
[1:44:33] Christian brother Paul tell you he knew
[1:44:35] he was a Christian because the kind of
[1:44:37] work he
[1:44:38] did not just what he said but he was
[1:44:41] faithful to his duty at on the
[1:44:46] job oh God I made him an effective
[1:44:49] witness I want my name I want somebody I
[1:44:53] wanted to be Associated if it's just one
[1:44:55] that's all right but I wanted it to be
[1:44:57] associated with at least one
[1:44:59] person you say but all I have is my
[1:45:02] children that's all I have influence on
[1:45:03] that's a
[1:45:06] name that's a name your name will be
[1:45:08] associate with your children all through
[1:45:10] eternity because you had faith for them
[1:45:12] you believed for them you took care of
[1:45:14] them you were a Godly mother a Godly
[1:45:16] father you read the Bible to them you
[1:45:18] had prayer time with them you weren't
[1:45:20] too busy
[1:45:23] that's what I
[1:45:24] want I want to sing that song do we know
[1:45:27] all I want to see is Jesus do we know
[1:45:28] that we not to try
[1:45:38] it brother Bram tells a story about
[1:45:42] a a man who went to to heaven and or he
[1:45:47] was he was dying he was a black man he
[1:45:49] was dying and he said his friend said
[1:45:53] brother are you waiting on your robe and
[1:45:55] Crown aren't you going to be glad to

[1:46:09] don't do what I do for Rob and Crown I'm
[1:46:11] not doing what I'm doing for recognition

[1:46:14] for

[1:46:31] look at
[1:46:32] him he said just let me look at him for
[1:46:35] a million
[1:46:36] years what if we have that kind of
[1:46:38] attitude tonight what if we
[1:46:41] could that all I want to see is
[1:46:44] Jesus all I want to see is Jesus that's
[1:46:48] who I was working for that's what when
[1:46:50] I'm ministering to you see when you

[1:47:06] our tithes if it's whatever it is that
[1:47:07] we do let us do it with all of our heart
[1:47:10] not begrudgingly but God loves a
[1:47:13] cheerful Giver I'm not talking just
[1:47:15] about money but everything that we do I

[1:51:04] needs maybe you can think about some way
[1:51:06] you could help I'm not talking about
[1:51:08] helping me or even my children or
[1:51:10] somebody else but some way I can help my
[1:51:13] brother help my sister and I don't mean
[1:51:15] just financially that may be part of it
[1:51:17] but very few of us can do
[1:51:20] that sometimes we try to fix the
[1:51:23] situation we help or we hurtt more than
[1:51:24] we help but maybe you can
[1:51:28] pray maybe you can reach out send a a
[1:51:30] card or some
[1:51:33] encouragement some of our folks live all
[1:51:35] the way in Jonesboro it's hard sometimes
[1:51:37] for us to get down there and fellowship
[1:51:38] with them like we should but but maybe
[1:51:41] we can do that make that
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] effort we live a long ways from each
[1:51:47] other and life gets busy but sometimes
[1:51:50] just sitting across the table from one
[1:51:52] another means something we get so
[1:51:54] wrapped up in our own lives church
[1:51:56] that's not what it's about I don't care
[1:51:58] how much you know about this message if
[1:52:00] you can't serve others it does others no
[1:52:02] good I don't think it does you much good
[1:52:06] either said but brother man I can't
[1:52:08] serve him the way I want to well serve
[1:52:10] him how you
[1:52:12] can serve him in the capacity that you
[1:52:14] can serve him in and I believe God will
[1:52:17] bless you for that Heavenly Father Lord
[1:52:19] we want to have a Ministry to the Saints
