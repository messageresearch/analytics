amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning isn't it you believe there's no one else like Jesus there's no one greater than Jesus if that's true this morning than anything is possible in this service whatever you come in here with your troubles your anxieties your struggles of life we can leave them at the altar and leave this place trusting Christ that he'll take care of us care of it for us amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be in your house this morning so thankful for your word Lord that tells us where two or three are gathered together you said I will be in their midst we're believing that Lord we're trusting it oh God I pray that you'd help us to know that you're right here with us I pray that you'd move in this service Lord just take me out of myself and speak directly to your people whatever way that you would require Lord whatever you would need from us I pray God we would do it today thank you for each one that's together pray you'd heal the sick touch those that are in need we pray in Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord amen we're going to be reading from Luke 11 Luke 11: 21 and 22 then James chap 1 verses 2- 4 it's good to have our visitor with us today God bless you good to have you if we have any other visitors good to have you this morning uh Brother Bruce looks like you got someone there with you God bless uh you this morning good to have you each one of you that are here it's always good to see you in the house of the Lord I've got a little bit of a allergies acting up as I'm sure a lot of you are as well so just bear with me this morning if you will we'll try to get through it uh Luke 11:21 says when a strong man armed keepeth his Palace his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armor where in he trusted and divided his spoils and then James chap 1 and verse 2 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations as different kinds of Temptation patience knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work or her full work that you may be perfect or mature and entire wanting or lacking nothing is that where we want to be this morning what we want to be God bless you as you have your seats we found out a couple weeks ago that the stronger man was Christ he is the one who could cast out the devil because he is the stronger man he is the one uh who has the ability to uh overcome the enemy and we can't do it in ourselves but he is the stronger man I'm getting feedback I think on this I can hear some feedback it may be in my ear we found out that uh he is the strong man the devil uh and we know that even or or or Christ is the is the the devil is the strong man Christ is the stronger one who can cast out the devil and that means that uh he's greater than anything that you face and we know that uh the devil doesn't cast out himself even Judas though he cast out Devils but he did it by the power of God he did it in the name of Jesus and so Jesus makes this argument to the Pharisees he said if I by Beelzebub cast out devils he said by whom do your sons cast them out he said therefore shall they be your judges but if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God has come upon you so when you see a supernatural working of the Holy Ghost to cast out the evil one out of your midst then you know that God is working there that the that the kingdom of God is come unto you and so whenever uh whenever that happens whenever the strong whenever we have strength in our life to cast out those things that are wrong we know that it was God that did that but Bill it wasn't us it's God that did that what enables you to be here today what caused you to leave the life of sin and the things that you did and the things that you were and and everything that that you were in your life what caused you to be different today it's because the stronger man came in and he came in cast out the devil and all of his works I'm so grateful for that today because it's all by Grace there's no works at all in it but it's by the grace of almighty God so he says uh he he said if I cast out Devils by the word of God the Finger of God which he was the word of God who does your denominational Children cast them out by God and God Alone can cast out a devil for the strong man has to be stronger than the one in the house and we know that the strong man we saw that the strong man was in US right he that is in you in 1 John 4:4 he tells us he said ye are of God ye are of God it means you proceed from God you're a part of God right you come from his thoughts you are God's children you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you how many believe that this morning do you really believe that greater is he that is in in you and he that is in the world so greater is he than any trial or any circumstance or any uh any devil that I might face in my life you are of God you are his sons and his daughters you are the house of the stronger man The House of the one who can do all things there's nothing impossible to you do we really believe that today there is absolutely nothing no matter what it might be addiction or or or some kind of a of an evil spirit anxiety struggles of Life there is nothing that is too difficult for you because the stronger man is inside of you and he overcomes for you do we believe that today yes now the Bible says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God oh my and he said for you have not received the spirit of a a bondage again to fear so in other words you don't think like slaves but you have received the spirit of adoption you perceive yourself as a son or daughter of God you've got to move from a slave mentality to an adoption mentality uh where you know I have been saved I've been delivered I know that God is my father I know that if I ask him he'll give me what I desire so he said we have removed ourselves we've not received the spirit of bondage to fear but we received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba which is just father father so the spirit of adoption the stronger Man cast out the spirit of fear in 1 John 4:18 there is no fear someone say no fear there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear so the perfect love is the stronger man yeah right that is the stronger man that cast out fear because fear hath torment he's not talking about Godly fear which is respect but he's talking about that thing that makes you scared and makes you believe you can't live the word you can't do what God says you can't be a Christian right the fear that says I'll never make it the fear that says I'll never be good enough the fear that says I've done too much in my past and I I I've I've burnt too many bridges I'll never be able to make it back that fear that's in your mind that may maybe I won't make a Rapture maybe things won't be okay for me what is that fear that fear has torment but the perfect love casts that out because you believe God's going to take care of you when you're in love with God when you love God when that love of God is in you you believe that he'll take care of you so there is no fear in love perfect love cast out fear right perfect love is divine love which is Christ the word in his fullness I want us to think through this this morning because it's important that we understand uh what we're talking about you realize that when you're born again you're not immediately everything you're going to be in God right you're born as a baby right right and so sometimes we get frustrated with ourselves because we think well you know I'm not where I want to be but are you farther along than you used to be can you look back at where you came from and see that God's done something in your life if you can see that you know God's working in your life so don't deny what's already happened but reach out and say Lord I want more I I want more of the Holy Ghost I want more godliness I want more Holiness I want more of God in my life I want more of the word in my life I don't want to deny what's already done in my life but I want more of you so we grow up in Christ so we have this Divine love inside of us by the New Birth by being born again which he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we know that the gift of the Holy Ghost is Christ himself the literal life of Jesus Christ which is the new birth so when it looks like everything has gone wrong because you're going to face trials in life even as a Christan Christianity is not a ticket it's not a golden ticket to Wily Wonka's chocolate factory right it's not going to get you in then you get everything you want but even the Chocolate Factory didn't turn out to be everything they thought it would be but but it's not a golden ticket it's not just going to set you on a flowery bed of East but there's going to be trouble there's going to be trials there's going to be situation cuz you're human we live in a fallen world we live in a world of briers and thorns and thistles we live in that world but we come to that world to be tested and when it looks like everything has gone wrong God is giving you a trial oh Church Gabe it's so good to see you and Millie and the baby here this morning God's done so much for you all when God gave you a trial he would he had confidence in you that you'd be able to take it are you hearing me today some of y'all know what I'm talking about you went through what you went through and you were able to make it through because God had confidence in you he got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around he he's you you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real Christian so God is giving you a test to see what you'll do about it remember when he went and found job job was not the worst Christian you say well I'm going through this trial because I'm the worst Christian there is that's not why job went through the trial he went through he was actually the best Christian the best believer the one who did things the best the one who was blessed the most and he and he went to job Satan went to before God and God said have you considered job for a trial have you considered putting job through some things why had confidence that he would stand the test he does trials do not come to you because you're the worst Christian or because you've done something wrong but because you're one of God's best right he has confidence in you he don't have to baby you around Wonder Peter said these fiery trials why counted a joy it's more precious to you than gold you know I'd like to have some gold they don't know whether there's any golden Fort knock or not but there's there's gold I'd like to have some of that if there is but he said trials are more precious to you than gold so James 1:2 which is where I want to go this morning says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse or many kinds of Temptations count it that word count is a word that means regard consider lead it it actually is translated in the King James version sometimes as governor in fact in Matthew 2:6 where he says Thou Bethlehem the in the land of Judah are not art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor a governor what is that that is a a leader and so he's regarded as a leader he is a leader a governor a controller that shall rule My People Israel so the idea in the scripture that Jame the way James is using it he said my brethren govern your thoughts in this manner lead your thoughts with this count it Joy right it's like your thoughts are are or a herd of of cattle and he said you need to Corral them with this lead them with this or maybe with some of us more like a herd of cats right it's very hard to catch up with them and so you got thoughts running this way and that way and that way and one tells you this and one tells you that we had goats when I was a kid and and uh we had uh we had a difficult time catching up with our goats sometimes I remember one particular night that the goats got out and and and and we were trying to catch them but you know some of the younger kids were actually scaring them away they didn't want the goats to get caught and because it was fun to them but we're running all over the farm trying to catch the goats I remember we had Pigs and the pigs got out and and we trying to catch the pigs as well it's very difficult sometimes that's the way it feels I need to go to church but I need to get control of my thoughts I I need to I need to I want to live for the Lord I want do the right thing but my thoughts are just going like this so he says when you're going through a trial count lead your thoughts with joy count it Joy control your thoughts and say I I consider this Joy because it's not going to feel like Joy right right see because Hebrews 12:11 says now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous right it's not going to feel like Joy so the idea is you control your thought have a different thought than what your senses tell you to have right your when you woke up this morning your senses might have told you oh my I forgot that it was time to change the clock to spring forward your senses might have put you in a bad attitude or a grumpy mood right your your your feelings maybe your body hurt maybe maybe you've you've been hurt in spirit in some way are you mad at your wife or mad at your husband or God forbid you know it should be that Christians you know sometimes get get sideways with people or you got something going on and and so it doesn't seem like what you're going through is joyful at all it doesn't seem like what you're going through are you hear me this morning doesn't seem like it'll help you at all do you don't see a way out you don't see a future you don't see even the next step but remember he's got a map that you don't have he he knows every part of your life he knows exactly what's coming next time and what's coming after that he knows what tomorrow holds and we don't know right so it don't seem to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward someone say afterward afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby it doesn't seem to be joyous but count it Joy right arrange your brain now he said well I I can't do that but that's why we got to be filled with the word right that's why we got to eat the word that's why we got to yield to the greater one because then he becomes the controller of our of our thoughts and even the the things that we would think and you can't help thoughts from coming through but that thought gets arrested and controlled by the stronger one so it doesn't seem to be Joy but counted Joy listen to the way this happened there such a marvelous example of it in Acts chapter 5 and verse 40 that the disciples had joy in persecution it says to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they beat them and they didn't just take them and SP them the way we spank our children sometimes but they actually took them and beat them with a whip till they were bloody and Stripes were on their back they beat them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and they let them go and they departed from the presence of the counsel rejoicing you talk about having your having your priorities right not rejoicing that they were let go but rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name it's difficult to Rejoice right in the pain but the stronger one had come in in Acts chapter 2 and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and so they they acted in a mature way they they acted in a way that's you know what we're glad that were able to do this they remembered the words of Jesus from Luke chap 6 at verse 2 he said blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company oh I think some of us have been through some things like this blessed are you when when they separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name is evil for the son of man's sake Rejoice ye in that day and leap for Joy right we like to jump When the Music's good and we like to jump when when the presence of God's there and people will jump and Shout right but he said the time to jump and leap for Joy is actually when you go through a trial Oh my he said when you when you are persecuted when people think the wrong things about you when they don't when they misunderstand you when they put you out from their company when they reproach you and cast your name as evil and call you Holy Rollers or call you a cult or something like that in that time rejoice in that day oh I hope you're hearing me today in that day when they say that when they say you can't do nothing right in that day when they say you'll never make it leap for Joy yeah why because your thoughts are ordered by the word for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets I don't say you'll feel like rejoicing right but your thoughts will be led and governed by the word dwelling in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we count it all joy we count the difficulty joy we count the the hospital State Joy we count the persecution joy we count the trouble Joy are you with me now it don't mean you'll always be happy sometimes you won't be happy but you count it Joy right you choose to be joyful you choose to be happy you choose to enjoy the moment that you have instead of worrying about the time that you don't have right right why why spoil the present wor about a future you can't control anyway right you got no control over what tomorrow holds you might as well enjoy what God has done for you today and even though I might be in pain even though I've gone through a great trial yet I know that my God will take care of me I know he's the same yesterday today and forever I know in the in the end it'll work out for good why do I know it because his Spirit lives in me and governs my thoughts and because I have have grown into this place where I recognize right this is for my good right so the stronger man in US cast out depression anxiety worry fear right he's the word right how many believe that today Christ is the word the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the the stronger Man cast out these things and so David said order my steps in thy word he said I want to do what your word says to I want to live what your word says live and that don't just mean that the way you dress or the way you act but are not smoking or drinking or something like that but it also means when you go through a trial to have a rejoicing in your heart a joy in your heart what is it because you're living by the word I'm not minimizing the trial we're not trying to say that you'll never that you'll never hurt right or that you won't cry or that sometimes you won't have to you won't have to rest or or or or just move away from it for a while cuz you your your your your body your mind can't handle it we're not saying that what we're saying is in the end you'll recognize this was good for me this is what God is doing in my life see either the stronger man will control your thoughts or the strong man the devil will regain a foothold in your mind he can't get to your soul that's been sealed away right once you are born again there's no going back you can't be lost but he can get to your mind and try to mes mess up your mind and govern your thoughts in your mind but we have to yield to the word now a a lack of control over our thoughts if that goes to an extreme form that's Insanity right that's people that are insane they just cannot control their thought thoughts and impulses they just have no Governor over that right and so whatever they feel they do or whatever they think they say but Christians are not just to be sane the gospel will not only make you sane but it'll actually it'll make you of a sound mind but it'll actually be more than that there'll be an inexplicable something inside of you that holds you in very difficult moments are you still with me this morning so the word is a is a government of the mind if you could think about it like that and so you get to tell or decide which thoughts stay in the mind and and so you get to a place in in Christ where yet you still suffer you still hurt you still struggle yeah but your circumstances do not control you you control control your circumstances right so it's not that well you know I'm in pain but I'm still going to do everything I can do and leave the rest to God right you may be getting older but you're still going to walk as much as you can't walk why you can't walk you're going to your footsteps find their way to the house of God why because well you say well I'm in pain I would have a right to say home yes you would but why do you come and I commend you for that you come because do not let your circumstances control you and us young Christians need to learn that that we do not let our circumstances control what we do when it comes to the house of God I'll still pray even if I'm going through the trial of my life I'll still cry out to God I'll still go to church even when it's tough to go even when it's difficult even when things are going wrong I'll still do what God says do I do not let my circumstances control me I control my circumstances that's good brother BR you know had a baby that died and her name was Sharon Rose and it's a tough thing to lose he lost his wife and his baby to TB tuberclosis and I thank God for that that's not as common as it used to be I do thank God for modern medicine in that way that that's not as common as it used to be because it was a terrible disease and he lost his wife and then his baby it must it was a very dark time in his life Satan tried to tell him that God didn't love him he said he was too late to tell him that God wasn't real because he'd seen too much but he tried to tell him God didn't love him he named that baby Sharon Rose I was listening to a to a sermon the other day brother brandom said and and he had been so broken by even telling his story he says this at the end of of his life story he said I love you dear Jesus you've broken my heart over and over but I love you for it that quotes always meant a lot to me because that's I'm controlling my thoughts I can't help but feel sad but I'm counting it Joy you broken my heart over and over but I love you for it so but I was listening to a sermon where brother Brandon was doing baby dedications and as the babies come up there was a little baby come up who was the same age and looked the same as his daughter had 20 years before and so they bring the little baby up and he said what's the baby's name I don't know if I could have handled this but they told him Sharon Rose Sharon Rose I I think I'd have just turned around and walked off because it's not they were they were trying to be they weren't trying to be mean or anything like that they were trying to honor that baby giving it the same name but brother to brother brand that had to hurt and he remarked he said she looks about the same age looks has the same color eyes looks like Sharon Rose I thought it must have been a very difficult situation to be in but you don't notice it on the tape he doesn't he takes a little extra time with that baby but he prays for that baby he said Lord may this child grow up he said though you chose to take Sharon and make her a rose in your garden he said may this child live though you chose to take mine that's a mature attitude towards a trial right not that if I suffer I want everybody else to suffer with me but though I've suffered though I've been through it though I've struggled in that way I don't want anybody else to suffer not even people who are insensitive or something else but I want the good for them why because I've come to the place where the my circumstances do not control the way I treat others right my Brokenness will not make me break others my pain will not me not make me cause others pain all right because what is it the stronger one is in the house and he's greater than he that is in the world yes sir Peter says it this way he said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy so he's tying the story of your trial to the story of the death burial and resurrection of Christ he's saying if you made it through your trial right right you you'll make it through the trial as Jesus died and and and was buried and and was there in the grave he was dead he was dead he was buried he was actually dead he was actually buried but he rose again on the third day and has he overcome you'll also overcome right as he made it through his trial you'll also make it through your trial right don't think it's strange as though some strange thing happened but Rejoice your partakers in his suffering that when his glory should be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy the resurrection tells us that there is a future beyond the pain a future that we can't control but the word does Jesus went into the ground believing the scripture and said I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption and he raised again on the third day and you've got to go into your trial believing God's going to raise me up he's the one who heals all my diseases are you with me today Church he's the one who's going to bring me out right and we know that he has looked at every possible outcome I want you to think about this yeah you know how you try to do that when you go to make a major decision you you want to look at what could possibly happen right so you go over in your mind if I buy this boat right what are the things that could take place am I going to have to work more to pay for it is it within my budget you know if I have to fix it do I have time to go on the is my wife going to dislike the fact that I spend my time on the water because a lot of times things have unintended consequences right that's why every time they make a decision in Washington you know it has unintended consequences right you you fire the wrong person or you hire the wrong person or you write the wrong law and they think well this is good but in the end it turns out actually to be something that hurts the very thing they were trying to help why is that it's not necessarily because we are uh it's not necessarily because we are uh trying to do bad things it's normally because we just don't see it right we just can't see it but when God puts you through a trial he sees every possible outcome amen I hope you're hearing me and he knows which one is going to happen so it's not just that he sees it every everything that could happen he knows exactly what will happen right right because he's the omniscient God he knows all things so he looked at the trial so whatever that it was sickness or the loss of a loved one or whatever God saw that trial before you come to it and he said I'm going to put Landon through this but he said I know when he comes out the other end he's not hoping that you'll be okay he saw you okay I hope you're hear me this morning he's already knows he's not hoping said well I put him through a trial and I'll just wait and see what they do with it no he already knew that he was going to be the fourth man in the fire all right he already knew that he was going to be there with with the the Lions and the lion Den Lions he already knew that he wasn't supposing that maybe if things got too tough for them that he would come down that was already his plan it was already his plan to put joanah in the belly of a whale but then for him to come out and the ninevites believe because he come out of a whale's belly it was already his plan to type the death burial and resurrection of Christ in that it was already in God's mind so whatever trial you go through no matter how big it is no matter how small it is you see but you don't understand the things that happened in my life do we believe that God knows everything or not and do we believe that God cares about us or he don't and if if he does care about us if he does know all things then he said what what he say in Romans 8:28 we know can we say that this morning we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose why we know that he knows yeah good are you with me now and so therefore because we love him we trust him now this trial is not judgment it's for my Perfection job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him but I'll maintain my own ways before him in other words he said I'm not going to call myself a sinner right why he'd already made a sacrifice for his sins though he slay me I'll trust him but I'll maintain my own ways before him he also shall be my salvation for a hypocrite shall not come before him in other words I've not come hypocritically I've come and and trusted in the sacrifice that I've made as an antidote for my sins I know he is My Sacrifice I know my sins are under the blood therefore any thought that would be contrary to that is governed by his word and says this must be for my good so in order for our thoughts to be governed in this way the stronger man must be in the house right the the the strong man the devil has to be kicked out and the stronger man has got to live in the house in your heart and we must be mature enough to allow him to do what he sees as best so think about it like this a small child left alone will never make good choices an't that odd you just thought well I'll just leave my child in his room and he's going to clean it very seldom if he does he's probably been told to do it or look or he's trying to impress somebody right but I'm talking about a very small child one of the ways that you know maturity is when a child begins to make good choices for the sake of the for the sake of the good choices in other words begin to recognize if my room is clean things will be better for me right I won't get a whooping right mom won't be mad right if I do it so so you kids listen up now no small child ever said please let me eat my vegetables maybe some of them did I don't know most small children you know the ones that don't want sodas the ones who've never been exposed to it you know once they get a taste of sweet tea right they start wanting it and and they cry for it they'll do whatever it takes to get it yeah right because they believe that that that is the best thing that could possibly be when they get that Sugar Rush last night Joel was at my house and and his son decided he wanted coffee when did he go to sleep last night pretty early well maybe it has the opposite effect on it he he then he woke up he he decided he wanted coffee so they gave him a little bit of coffee and a whole lot of milk but but he's he's what two years old so he thinks that's the best right that's the best the sugar the caffeine I mean it is the best but beside that but it may not be healthy might not be the best thing for a 2-year-old right you put them in the house and just give them you just set a bucket of candy in the house they're going to eat eat it that's right right no child ever put themselves on a diet right you know just they're very young and and and and they usually don't need to because they run it off but children they'll never put on enough clothes when it's cold ever and they're at the bus stop and you know we used to be critical of people at the bus stop you know or the or the the line you know you get in the line at school and and you become critical of people because they're they're standing there and and uh uh you see kids with no coat on but they wore one to school they just don't still own it it's just like the fellowship hall over here it's how the lost and found gets filled up with stuff they wore one to church but there's no telling where it is now right you see that kid in shorts you know or little kid in shorts or something you think how in the world why did their parents they must have horrible parents but a lot of times just a kid decided what was best for them and and some parents just let them do whatever they think is best for them right but that's because they're children right they just don't know yet they're not mature enough to see right what is what the consequences of what they do I've told my kids if I have to tell you to clean your room you're probably not ready to be married right I'm just throwing that out there now why now the stronger man think about it like this he's the mature man yes right he's full grown now we brought up uh we brought up a couple of kids the other day we brought up trip is not really a kid but trip is full grown really and and then we've got we had Jason up here and we showed the difference between the two the stronger man the strong man Jas Jason might be strong but but trip was Stronger why is he stronger well what it might some of it might be jeans right just the way you're built but the biggest reason is he's older right and that's the biggest reason if you go pick a fight if you're 10 you go pick a fight with an 18y old you you might be in trouble right and you might be that mature someday but you're not now right the biggest difference is just maturity and so many times what we see in people's lives when they can't seem to make and just can't seem to come to church or they can't seem to do what they need to do and it's just a lack of maturity but don't give up on yourself there there's maturity for you but sometimes God has to put us through trials to to mature us to bring us up to build us up but the the way we ought to be built up is by the word yes that God would actually and the word would so become a part of our lives that we begin to be that stronger Christian so if I am the house of the stronger man and he lives in me why is it so difficult to count it all joy well it's because of maturity because he comes into us in a baby form but he grows in us as we yield ourselves to him a and that that that joy that you felt you remember what it was like to get saved you remember what that was like that was just a what what a wonderful feeling to all your sins are I see sister Fritz back the other hand up brother JT some of you Elders it was years ago but you remember what it was like the day you gave you you laid your sins on the Altar and that day when you gave it I remember what it was like yeah the day that I finally gave in and the Holy Ghost come down and baptize me I remember what it was like to be forgiven yes right for my life to change I I I know that feeling yeah but that feeling that you had that as great as it was is just in an infant form in your life do you realize that you are not born again a full born believer go listen to you must be born again but random tells us that you're not born again and immediately you're a full grown Christian but you're born of the spirit of God and then you grow into a full grown Christian yeah and you really you say well brother Ben when will I fully grow up when do I come to my full adoption at the change of the body right right but you do become mature enough that you're able to make it through things maybe used to you wouldn't have been able to make it through now again growing up is recognizing there consequences our Behavior brother Brandon says now he said to you people that wanted to renew the joy of your salvation how many would want more joy here today I think all of us could say that he said if you people want to renew the joy of your salvation he somewhere you've lost Joy think back what you did did you neglect prayer meeting neglect reading the Bible neglected praying at your home asking the blessing at the table you see that's a little thing but it's a little thing that mature people do right because they realize there's a blessing in it come on he said don't ever do that that's so Unbecoming to Christians no matter where you are bow your head and pray don't be ashamed of him pray anywhere amen he said if every where you left that Joy whatever weeded it out what little root of bitterness come in he said remember when a man is saved this much he said like a button so like the button you probably can't see that but like the button on your shirt right if you have a button on your shirt he said that's about how much that when you're saved he said that becomes eternal life in your heart that's God as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a Son of God man was made to be a god he's in the image of God he's given a a Dominion a domain over the Earth right he in in the beginning Genesis 1 126 he was given dominion over the over the Earth that he lived in he ruled over it he ruled over the an animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms he was an amateur God you could say because he was he was ruler over his Dominion what happened because he disbelieved God's word and sent him right back out to shift for himself he said but now God's trying to bring him back remember Satan's big lie to Eve what was it he told him he said he said You shall be as Gods yeah right he said you'll know good and evil but they already were yeah he was trying to sell them on a position that they already had oh he still does that today he still does that around the message trying to tell people well this is coming or that's coming or you need to wait on that he's trying to sell you something that you've already got yeah all right right he said when you when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit then you begin to be a Son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God he said the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you but if you've grieve that Spirit somewhere how many know you can grieve the spirit of God right not to where he'll leave you for good but just where his influence is not in your life in the same way that's right he said then go right back and think in your mind what did I start doing neglecting Church did I start fussing with another denomination did I start picking on this one doing this to my neighbor if you did that's what sapped it out oh my go say God I'm sorry I'll go right back and make that thing right I'll go right and do it then the joy will come back to your salvation again he said the Holy Spirit just flew up on the rafter he's ready to fly right back down again anytime you want him to come back see we're we're not supposed to remain children just where we're constantly grieving the Holy Ghost but we're supposed to grow up yes Paul says everyone that uses milk is unskillful the word of righteous as you give a a baby a steak he won't know what to do with it only thing he can do is choke on it right he's a baby he said but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil that's why God sends the ministry to us in Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostle and some prophets Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so he's saying till we come into this maturity that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the sight of men cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up someone say grow up GR I just had you say that so I can take a drink we'll be done here in just a minute but may grow up into him in All Things someone say all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint Supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so brother random again teaches us that that white button like of eternal life starts in the heart and that's God that's just a way to put it right it's not literally a button it's the way to it's just a way to to make you understand he said that part is God when he's born again with the spirit of God God's spirit dwells in him now as he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can become back this is phenomenal he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the garden yes of Eden yes see I believe you're a good church but we're not where we're supposed to be we won't be till we leave here right I believe you're good people I I try to be a good person I try to live for God I try believe I'm born again I believe I'm going to heaven but I'm not what I want to be there's room yet to grow right I got something left that God wants out of my life or I wouldn't be here so he said we can actually mature that that growth can happen in US until we come back in the same condition that man was in the garden of e of Eden so God raises the church up the same way we see how he raised them up from the Dark Ages through the Protestant Reformation and each age represented a different stage of maturity it's the the the if the corn of wheat falls into the ground and it begins to come up and it comes up a just a stalk and then it's a tossle and then it's a Shook and finally the grain but BR said now the Sun comes across and ripens the grain it cannot ripen it all it wants as it goes on maturing it constantly ripens someone say constantly constantly ripens until it comes to a full year so it is today with the church it started in its infancy back in the Dark Age where it was under the ground it's grown now into maturity the individual has to come up the same way church that's exactly where we're at we're to be restored Back to Eden man in full Authority full maturity he said that's impossible it's where he's taking us right and how how do you know because he did it when he was here and he was the man the firstborn among many Brethren and so we we are and we see that by the example of Jesus that we're not ruled by nature but we rule nature yeah right he stopped the storm peace be still so being a mature son or daughter of God is getting to the place where we're no longer tossed about we're no longer ruled by this nature but we rule this nature amen right it's growed up into maturity for the Bible says the I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed to us what's he saying I reckon I count I I I've marshaled my thoughts I've control them to believing that the sufferings are not worthy I I'm mature enough to County Joy Joy the Bible says for the earnest expectation of the creature wait is for the manifestation of the sons of God brother brandom tells us this may choke you to death did you did you know men are the sons of God that are the sons of God are amateur gods and Jesus says that in John 10:34 he said it is not written is it not written in your law you are gods and we're not making oursel God but in the sense of you have control Dominion right over your environment over nature which God said in Genesis 2 they were Gods cuz they were had domain over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things he lost his godship lost his sunship lost his domain Satan took it over but brother we're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who come back and taking it take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out will take every Power that Satan's got away from him he said yes sir it belongs to him he made man of God a God in his and his domain goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has the control of it so what am I saying everything in your life you you have the ability to speak to it and it'll actually move in God's timing right right it'll move in God's timing and then you just believe that it's for your good look he said when he when the winds blowed he said peace be still when the tree he said no man eat from thee he said verily I say unto you you that little Gods if you'll say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said that's powerful go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world in nature is groan and crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed see that's you become into adulthood you gain author Authority yeah right you back your word as as a as a parent you got to back your word right if you say something you you got to back it up your kids got to believe that you mean what you say and God does the same thing but he won't back the word of a baby right he doesn't back the word of a baby he backs the word of full born born Sons true Sons filled sons are you with me now we want to get to where the word backs us up right to be so mature that the word backs us up when we speak where we're not vulnerable to man's ideas we're not moved by dogmas and Creeds and spirits and emotions and and Sensations that come contrary to the word but we're true Sons born Sons filled Sons we're not babies anymore right right and that's what the message of the hour has brought us to that's the time that we're living in we're a mature bunch of people and I'm not just talking about your a your age I'm not calling you old but I believe all of us have a maturity because of the age that we live in beyond what people used to have because of the time so Paul is speaking to a Corinthian Church in 1 Corinthians 13 who refused to grow up and if you go and you can read the whole thing later but Paul actually if you read 1 Corinthians 13 how many knows what that is that's the love chapter right so if you read 1 Corinthians 13 Paul is describing the opposite of the behavior of somebody Jonah's age or I won't call your other children that's what he's doing read 1 Corinthians 13 charity suffereth long babies don't do that right and is kind right babies are not longsuffering toddlers are not longsuffering right but mature adults can be by the maturity of the word charity envieth not huh but you better not take that toy away from that child or have someone else have a better one you ever been in Walmart picking out Christmas presents you better you better get them something similar right or something at least that costs as much why they Envy right but a mature Christian envieth not right right charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself doesn't brag it's not puffed up right but but you find a child will say are we there yet five minutes later Are We There Yet 10 minutes later are we there yet they know they're not there they know they're not close but it's just immaturity a child will come to you and I I actually love this but they'll come to you say look what I did right you could be talking to a bunch of adults about something important and Bo but they got to show you they put that Lego set together and tell you what it is cuz you can't tell what it isless they tell you that play though that they put together they've got to do that why do they feel the need to do that they feel a need to be important it's part of growing up it's finding a child right but we want to be better than that are you with me now no are we there yet or look what I did Charity does not behave itself we know charity is agape love divine love does not behave itself unseemly the opposite of a child in church I'm not picking on your kids we we love the kids I'm so glad to hear them cry because I know we got children in the church but charity love does not behave itself unseemly if a 40-year old man acts like that you begin to think weird about him you know something going on charity seeketh not her own not selfish it's not easily provoked we can stop there for a while think no evil right all right not thin skinned I know a lot of preachers that need to grow up just leave that one there charity love rejoices not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth yes they don't relish evil things happening to others beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things love never fails right I love that prophecies fail tongue Sil will cease and there will be knowledge will pass away but love never fails we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect what does that mean when the maturity comes then that which is in part should be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things but now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity I want to show you I think I've got a a picture of that drawing I'm not sure if it's right here if it's later on yes look at the drawing that Brother brandom D Drew out about the church ages and how it typed the virtues in second Peter chapter 1 you can go and read and study that later I don't have time this morning but it's the stature of a perfect man or a sure man and and it he put it in a pyramid form with love at the top being the seventh virtue being the one at the top and that being Christ at the top and then the churches down below and so uh and and actually the the the Seven Virtues in the eighth is is love is divine love so uh Peter goes through those and tells us if these be in you and abound he said you'll you you you'll you'll never fall oh I want to be in that place where I never fall but what's at the top love why because Divine love is the most mature thing right that's why we want our children to be mature before they go into any relationships yes right because love has to be a mature thing because it won't always feel good it's a choice that you make are you with me now and the age this is what I'm trying to get to you the age has come into a mature right right to come to brotherly kindness and then what to be capped off by what by love yes to be capped off by love what is that it's Christ coming down and sealing oh my sealing the age with love yeah so so when that this is what maturity looks like brother Bron says when that which is perfect has come that which is impart shall be done away with so all these little things are jumping up and down like a kid again we're supposed to leap for Joy but when do we do it when we're going through a trial not just when the music is going right right he said Rejoice leave for Joy when you're going through when you're persecuted he said so all these little things that jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's s the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things this message does not do away oh my it does not do away with the gifts it only does away with with the immature gifts yeah it does not do away with gifts but it puts them in order by love yeah the stronger man has grown into full maturity and we have that kind of maturity with our faith we can move mountains but he said but Paul look how he ties that in the first part of that chapter he said though we have faith to move mountains and don't have love he said we have nothing right so moving mountains by itself isn't enough but the full maturity to count it all joy when your Mountain doesn't move as fast as you think it should right cloudy skies and storms of life are not signs of God's disapproval you hear me church as I close neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love we we need to mature past that yeah we need to get a maturity in US yeah where we can I don't say a maturity where we don't Rejoice but a maturity where we would we Rejoice no matter what's going on right good not to come to a a maturity where we would never worship but a maturity where we would worship no matter what we're going through God help me to be that mature today yes he said his approval is not based on the things that happened to us yeah his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved trip that's something that I've tried to show to my kids and I hope I can show to others and and and you and and and each one of you that are a part you know we go through terrible things in life and I want to show you that I love you because of you not because of what you do that's right does that make sense I love you because of who you are you're you're a child of God you're worthy of my attention not because I might disagree with something you do right but that's not what our relationship is based on yeah I love you you because you're one of gods and and even the world we love but we love the the children of God in a different way because we have kinship and a bond there right and so I love you because if you're part of this church I don't I'm not just saying this I don't love you because of what you do or don't do you say well if brother Ben knew the way I lived or what I had done or someone he wouldn't love me that no let's do away with that thinking it's immature thinking right we love Because of Who You Are and we'll get through the other stuff God don't love you because of what you've done or what you haven't done he don't love you because you go to church or because you don't he don't love you because you he don't love you because you succeed or or love you less when you fail you his love is in the election he chose you before the foundation of the world because if we believe well he loves me because he treats me well what happens when you go through a trial all right his approval of us is not subject my kids will be my kids no matter what they do my approval of my kids is not subject to to what I do what they do or what I do it's in the Beloved so you make it like this I've said this before you make it where I'm I'm so tied with them that I can't I can't afford to let them fail I just won't see it I'll pray I'll do whatever it takes to see them in the house of God because I they will they fall will they make mistakes absolutely but my approval is not based on on Works hope you see that I hope my kids understand that because as teenagers you start to make your own decisions you begin to fail and the failing is not cute anymore right it was cute when you were a kid but as you get older it's not cute no more but remember that you are not approved today because of what you do or what you haven't done but you're approved because you chosen by by God to believe what you believe God has made you what you are yes good and that's a freedom in that freedom from the bondage of servant servant where you begin to think of yourself as a son or a daughter of God his love is elective he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass musicians if You' go ahead and come out of time this morning Jesus when he was about to leave the earth begin to talk to his disciples about joy and he said this he said you're going to be sorrowful for a while he said cuz I'm leaving he said but the joy comes in the morning you know he said hither to have you ask nothing in my name he said I want you to ask and you shall receive that your joy could be complete full mature ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full and I think many times people people are afraid to ask because they're afraid they might not receive yes because many times we ask and we don't receive right away and so time becomes the enemy of faith and so we believe when we come to the Altar and have hands laid on us we believe right and then a few weeks later if maybe nobody comes to visit or we're we're in a difficult place in the Pain's still there we're still hurting it's hard to believe during that time yeah it's hard to continue you keep your faith up right and I think we should do everything we can to help people's faith in that way but maturity is coming to the place where I know it may look dark yeah but I'm going to ask anyway right because I believe he'll give it to me in his time in his way in his manner he'll give me what's best for me he'll either give it to me brother BR said he reached a place in his life where he would either go he said anything I asked for God will either give it to me or tell me why he couldn't oh I want to be in that place where I'm willing to listen to the nose where I'm willing not to be governed by sensation you know so many people do that they just governed by the the first thought that comes to their mind well I don't feel good about this or I don't feel good about that that's not what we ought to be governed by but by faith in the word he said he would keep me sir he said he would reward my labor of love he said he would give me peace that passes under understanding he said he would heal all my diseases he promised he would do it and so why do I believe it because he said so and if he's brought me this far if he changed my life if he brought me out of sin and darkness he can do more for me he can continue to work in my life would you bow your heads with me this morning if you've never been born again if you've never fully yielded yourself to the stronger man maybe you're still struggling with things in your life would you just raise your hand to him today i' like to pray pray for you God bless you God bless those hands never really yielded yourself like you should God bless that hand those hands oh I want the stronger man A lot of times we're looking for some some super strength and God said just let the stronger man order your thoughts count it Joy let him let him control your thoughts or thinking we can't control the circumstances of life that's in the Providence of God but we can control our thinking about it I believe we ought to pray earnestly several hands went up and I believe God today could be your day that you're just so Born Into the kingdom of God that you know and maybe you just need to mature maybe You' received the the spirit but you just need to grow up may today be that day when you wake up and realize I'm not a baby anymore but I'm going to stand for the word I'm going to do what God called me to do Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we've preached Lord and I've tried the best of my ability which is not much Lord I've tried to help much as I can realizing Lord that we're all on this journey somewhere Lord all of us that are here we didn't come here by accident we're somewhere on this journey I pray you'd bless each one Lord these that raise their hand I pray God you do a mighty work in their life may the stronger man come in Lord and begin to take control of everything realizing Lord we're still human and there will still be things come by but yet the word will arrest us Lord make us different I pray you grant that Lord oh arrest our thoughts Lord control govern Our Lives Lord help us to count it all joy no matter what we go through because Lord there many different trials Lord even represented in this church this morning there's some things Lord that these people have been through I couldn't even imagine going through myself yet I knew I know that you saw it before it ever happened and you Lord allowed it to come because you knew they could take it and I pray you'd help us to realize that Lord I pray you'd move in their lives I pray you'd Cast Away all doubt as perfect love cast out fear Lord and this is the age of perfect love may you cast out every doubt and every fear all anxiety everything of the world Lord may we fully Lord as a mature bride worship you in spirit and in truth I pray you grant it Lord we love you help us lord lord it's hard to leap for Joy when things are going wrong help us help us to grow Lord that place where we can do that recognize your love for us is not dependent on our failures but Lord your love is elective Lord you love us no matter what we do but Lord you want us you you
