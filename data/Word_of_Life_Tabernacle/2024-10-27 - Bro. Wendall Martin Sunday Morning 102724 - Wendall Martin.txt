Lord we're asking that you would take all of our sins and all of our unbelief away this morning and that you would Lord just wash us in your blood and let us sit here and feast upon your word it's our desire now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here this morning amen praise the Lord I'm so thankful that for the the word of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord I I'd like to speak here this morning I I I thought since we um had the uh little family get together yesterday I thought maybe I'd preach a little bit uh along the lines of family here this morning and and um uh maybe I you know we just how the Lord I'm I'm one of those uh type of preachers that gets started and he man sometimes have a hard time finding where I was at but uh uh we we um I I I I I think um for a title this morning I I want to I want to speak on be strong and of good courage don't be weary and well-doing amen for you're going to reap in due season there in Joshua 1 and7 it says only be strong and very courageous that thou May observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage won't you turn to your neighbor right now and tell him be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest can you say Amen so God's original plan amen was was was for a courageous men and women God's original purpose was for courageous men and women not detoured by by uh uh danger or pain but amen that's actually courageous not detoured by by by danger or pain but they're Brave they're Fearless they're Valiant they're larten amen well can you say amen amen the opposite of of of courageous is cowardly amen fainthearted spineless timid fearful amen God don't want you being L God wants you to be courageous God God's not wanting you to just amen blend in with Society here in Le osia but God's looking for Fearless God's looking for brave men and women amen that are that are going to stand upon the principles that God has set out for you and me I think the greatest amen the greatest thing that we could ever have the greatest call the greatest gift it's not your job amen it's it's the it's the call to serve the Lord in the capacity amen that he has given us whether it be a child or whether it be a a husband or whether it be a wife whether it be a pastor amen a song leader musician whatever capacity God has given us we want to do it with everything that we've got well can you say amen amen the world's going out there with everything they've got Amen Let Us stand for what we believe amen that that's right you know we we we I I think there's something that that we've got to stand against and that is amen be vigilant against the sin of lukewarmness Hallelujah because the the the the Bible says that this last age was going to be a lukewarm AG that's neither going to be cold or hot amen they're not going to be on fire for God but yet they're not ranked Sinners they're just they're dis satisfied with amen having their name on a book or belonging to a message church or amen what well can you say Amen but God is calling us to be on fire for it amen to be strong about it to be vigilant about it amen and I I I think there amen because the the scripture says there in first Thessalonians or second Thessalonians amen I believe it uh uh there in the uh the first chapter says because they received not a love for the truth amen God would send them strong delusion amen that they would believe a lie thinking they are right and they would be damned by what they were believing come on well can you say amen amen so this is the day amen of great deception this is the day where Satan has taken over everything he has taken over the politics he has taken over the churches he has taken over Society he has taken over everything but it's in this day that God is calling out be thou strong and of good courage can you say amen amen that's right in a day when love has become a foreign thing amen we need courageous men and women who are ordained to stand against all of the principalities and the powers of this day do you realize that brother amen that that that the scripture says that amen there's going to be 200,000,000 demons that were let loose in this generation amen and what are they fighting against yes they're fighting against Israel amen because carried the seed of Christ but they're against the Bride of Jesus Christ what you see is taking place over there in Israel right now amen is is amen it's 2020 you know millions of times more of what he's trying to do to you amen he's trying to take you out even more than he's trying to take Israel out those demons of hatred that are against the Jews it's the same spirit that is against the Bride of Jesus Christ amen but I say today God give me courage God make me strong amen God give me what it takes to overcome let me stand against the

team Chief demission uh five-time medalist in the basketball to the USA Sports it's evident where we've come from especially with women in sports I'm very proud of that not so proud that I want to make men jealous because a lot of men play uh play a role in where we are now but I'm proud to know we've come this far University of Michigan women outnumbering the men for the first time on the US West Roads another one says the researchers predict that if the trend continues it could be it could affect everything from vehicle design to traffic fatalities and fuel consumption and then when you come into the church the church often gives the same views amen so men are in double whammy they're they're outside there and the devil is out to destroy your man let Hey Hey listen I want every one of you sisters every one of you wives to know Satan is trying to take away your man right amen but sometimes when we come in the church amen the men are in a double whammy and the church can set them up for fail as well and amen we expect them to courageously leave the family and to get up and go to work every day and would like to have a nice house and car and Pony and and and Cat and ring and and then come home Happy kind gentle well-mannered and and oh yeah we want you to be dedicated man of prayer amen we we want I want to tell you that that devil is after our brothers right true I

responsibility upon that man and Satan will come in and keep that man in condemnation and push him down and kick him and try to destroy because Satan does not want leadership Satan is against leadership but God has come in this day to restore leadership yes sir yes sir come on all right come on good I heard a woman say one time she don't go to church here so I'll use it amen come on now

Children that bucked or the son that bucked the system in the Gard or uh uh there outside the garden Satan rebelled against the perfect God right Eve rebelled against the word of her husband Adam yeah to follow the slickster and Adam was perfect yeah God calls for leadership yeah that's right God's called the man to lead the family yeah that's right and the last I've checked there is no one on planet Earth there's no male on planet Earth who is the perfect man that's right true sorry guys I knew you thought you were amen is that right there's no one there there's there there's no male on
