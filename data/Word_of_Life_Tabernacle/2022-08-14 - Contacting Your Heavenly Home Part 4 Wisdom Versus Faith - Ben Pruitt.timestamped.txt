[50:33] i love the way it puts that his own
[50:36] sheep
[50:37] it goeth before them and the sheep
[50:38] follow him
[50:40] for they know his voice
[50:44] the stranger will they not follow but
[50:46] will flee from him
[50:48] for they know not the voice
[50:51] of strangers i pray the lord would add
[50:53] his blessing to the word you may be
[50:54] seated
[50:55] this morning
[50:59] we've been talking about contacting our
[51:01] heavenly home
[51:03] using the sixth sense which is faith
[51:06] and we've found that faith comes
[51:09] through the senses
[51:11] by hearing the word
[51:12] and yet
[51:14] faith is not based on the five senses
[51:17] but it's based on what god said it's
[51:19] it's based on those things that can't be
[51:22] seen yet god uses the sense especially
[51:25] of hearing
[51:26] to bring
[51:28] faith to us and we find that unbelief
[51:30] also
[51:31] comes from that same
[51:33] avenue that what you hear primarily is
[51:36] what the devil the way the devil is
[51:38] going to get through to you is by what
[51:40] you hear the same way that god gets
[51:42] through to you by what you hear and so
[51:45] that creates then an atmosphere so if
[51:47] you're listening to things that produce
[51:50] faith that creates an atmosphere of
[51:52] faith and then we know that an
[51:54] atmosphere means that things can be born
[51:56] there can a seed can come to life in the
[51:59] right atmosphere but in the wrong
[52:00] atmosphere the seed is stifled it cannot
[52:04] grow and so we know that in order for us
[52:06] to become what god wants us to be as as
[52:09] creatures of faith god don't want us to
[52:11] be some cold powerless kind of person
[52:14] that doesn't have any ability to reach
[52:16] out and grab a hold of the promises of
[52:18] god but he wants us to be somebody who
[52:21] can take advantage of the promises that
[52:23] he's given us somebody that can step out
[52:26] in faith and believe what god said how
[52:28] many want to be that kind of a christian
[52:29] today i want to step out and believe
[52:31] what god said i want to be everything
[52:33] that god wants me to be in order to do
[52:36] that you've got to have faith there's
[52:37] got to be an atmosphere of faith in your
[52:39] life and that comes to you by hearing
[52:42] what do we hear the word of god
[52:45] amen that's why the word always takes
[52:47] first place in our services the word
[52:49] takes first place in our lives
[52:51] everywhere we go the word becomes first
[52:53] yes
[52:54] but now we know this is the word of god
[52:57] and yet faith doesn't come by reading
[52:59] right
[53:00] faith comes by hearing
[53:03] not by sight but by hearing
[53:06] that is the sense that god chose to give
[53:09] us faith by
[53:10] is by hearing so there must be a living
[53:13] voice you think of
[53:15] of philip and the eunuch remember the
[53:18] eunuch was a jew he was a proselyte to
[53:20] the jewish religion he was traveling
[53:22] from jerusalem and he got down there in
[53:24] the desert he was reading the prophet
[53:26] isaiah in isaiah 53 where he said he was
[53:30] wounded for our transgressions by his
[53:31] stripes were healed he began reading and
[53:34] he couldn't decide whether he was
[53:35] talking about himself speaking of the
[53:37] prophet isaiah or someone else he didn't
[53:39] know anything about jesus and so he's
[53:42] sitting there in the in the chariot he
[53:44] doesn't know and god brings supernatural
[53:46] he brings philip down from where he's
[53:48] preaching a revival brings him down and
[53:51] and causes him to join himself to that
[53:53] chariot puts him down in the middle of
[53:55] the desert and when he comes in he said
[53:56] do you understand what you read and the
[53:58] man said how can i accept some man show
[54:01] me
[54:02] and he didn't have any faith to be
[54:04] baptized
[54:05] because he had not heard but once he
[54:08] heard from someone who was a living
[54:11] voice
[54:12] then he could believe yes i don't say
[54:15] you can't you have faith in this
[54:18] but what gives you faith is somebody
[54:20] listen you don't understand the power of
[54:22] your testimony you need somebody to walk
[54:25] out and tell say i've taken i have
[54:28] believed it and it came to pass in my
[54:30] life
[54:31] right it's one thing to read it
[54:34] it's one thing to hear the story but
[54:36] it's another thing for somebody to walk
[54:38] out and say this works yes how many kids
[54:40] say amen to that this morning
[54:43] this works this message is not an
[54:45] abstract idea it's not a theology or
[54:49] it's not a supposition it's not
[54:51] something that a scientist a theory that
[54:53] they would make and put
[54:55] a with b with c and put it all together
[54:57] and it all works no it's not a theory
[54:59] it's a reality
[55:01] god didn't doesn't save us by theory
[55:04] he never does
[55:05] but he makes he he came as a reality he
[55:08] came in flesh and blood and when the
[55:10] word became flesh it worked
[55:13] it did what it said it would do
[55:15] oh how many are glad for that today
[55:18] the word did what it said it would do
[55:20] and when the word becomes flesh in you
[55:22] the word does what it said it would do
[55:24] it it'll produce a super church it'll
[55:26] produce a bride without spot or wrinkle
[55:28] it'll produce that in this age i believe
[55:30] you we are that yes that's right we have
[55:33] to be that to be the word in our day
[55:36] so the word comes now now watch you hear
[55:39] and you don't only hear faith you hear
[55:41] unbelief right
[55:43] it's everywhere
[55:45] you hear it all the time
[55:47] the devil telling you you can't make it
[55:49] how does he tell you by living voices
[55:52] that's right
[55:53] voices on television voices on movies
[55:55] voices in your car voices on the radio
[55:58] voices in your family voices everywhere
[56:01] constantly telling you and they're
[56:03] speaking against this faith they're
[56:05] saying it can't be done
[56:07] it's a cult if there's nothing good in
[56:09] it and and so it speaks constantly
[56:11] against you
[56:12] and so that comes in it enters your
[56:14] hearing but like i said you've got to
[56:16] take that thought then and arrest it if
[56:18] it's contrary to the word of god
[56:20] but now when we hear now watch what has
[56:23] to happen next we hear then we are
[56:25] what's called a free moral agent
[56:28] a free moral agent it's like someone
[56:31] who is not on either side he gets to
[56:33] choose which side he's going to be on
[56:35] and you get to decide whether you are on
[56:38] the side of unbelief or faith yes
[56:41] how many understand that this morning
[56:43] this morning in this service
[56:46] you get to decide
[56:49] what side that you're on believe how you
[56:51] get to decide am i going to be a
[56:52] believer or am i going to be an
[56:54] unbeliever
[56:56] now watch now god put something in you a
[56:59] seed that would make you make the right
[57:01] choice
[57:02] we all understand that
[57:04] we're predestined to make that choice
[57:05] but we are free moral agents and so when
[57:07] this comes in no there's unbelief and
[57:10] there's faith
[57:11] and we're not fatalistic we don't just
[57:12] have to follow whatever comes in
[57:15] right but here comes a word of unbelief
[57:17] here comes the word of faith and we've
[57:19] got to weigh that and measure it and see
[57:21] if it's with the word of god and if it's
[57:23] not we reject it
[57:25] and if it's if it is we accept it
[57:28] and it's a more powerful thing than what
[57:30] we realized this morning
[57:32] our gospel did not come into word only
[57:34] but in power and demonstration so when a
[57:37] living voice proclaims it when it's
[57:39] demonstrated before us then we get to
[57:41] accept it or reject it by free will
[57:44] and that will determine our eternal
[57:47] destination
[57:48] right
[57:50] now think about it
[57:51] now what is heard must be
[57:54] accepted
[57:56] this is where a lot of times
[57:58] people mess up
[57:59] this is where i mess up sometimes
[58:02] it's not enough just to hear it say well
[58:04] i listen to tapes that's wonderful
[58:06] so does the devil
[58:09] think the devil doesn't know what the
[58:10] prophet said
[58:12] of course he does
[58:14] i go to church i hear you brother ben i
[58:15] listen to your sermon so does the devil
[58:18] he's the most faithful member we got
[58:21] sits in every service sits on the front
[58:23] row
[58:25] right
[58:26] probably right next to brother joel over
[58:27] there
[58:30] the devil said he's the most faithful
[58:32] member
[58:33] but what is he he he's he's always there
[58:35] he believes and trembles the bible says
[58:38] and so you can do that but there's got
[58:40] to be an accepting of that word and a
[58:42] manifesting of that word so it becomes
[58:44] it comes through the five senses it
[58:46] comes to the senses of the spirit we
[58:48] either accept it or reject it and then
[58:50] whether we accept it or reject it if we
[58:52] accept faith faith manifests
[58:56] right
[58:56] we have the manifestation of faith which
[58:58] is works yes
[59:01] right
[59:02] you can't accept it without it
[59:04] manifesting itself
[59:06] if you don't do the works of god if you
[59:09] still live in sin
[59:11] you've never accepted faith
[59:13] because once you accept faith
[59:16] then the works will manifest they will
[59:17] predominate over your body
[59:20] over the senses of your body but if you
[59:22] accept unbelief that also manifests
[59:24] itself
[59:26] now watch what are you listening to this
[59:28] morning now but the random said in in
[59:30] and knoweth it not he said now he said
[59:32] that last man to the last man which is
[59:34] the soul there's only one sense that
[59:37] controls that and that is free moral
[59:39] agency's free will to choose
[59:42] or to reject
[59:43] now watch you say well that's you know i
[59:45] i accept it sometimes i reject it some
[59:48] other times you got to watch what you
[59:50] accept and what you reject
[59:52] how many have heard of the mark of the
[59:53] beast
[59:54] right mark of the beast you see it
[59:56] everywhere and you'll see people they're
[59:57] scared they're going to put a chip in
[59:58] their hand or or a tattoo or put
[1:00:01] something on them you realize brother
[1:00:02] branham taught us the mark of the beast
[1:00:04] is already here
[1:00:06] he said now somebody said there's going
[1:00:08] to be a mark of the beast it's going to
[1:00:09] come someday he said let me tell you
[1:00:11] it's already come
[1:00:13] he said well when did it come as soon as
[1:00:15] the holy ghost began to fall
[1:00:17] the mark of the beast began to take
[1:00:19] place
[1:00:21] right because when you see the
[1:00:22] manifestation of the holy spirit i hope
[1:00:24] you hear me today that's why the
[1:00:26] unpardonable sin is to is to mock the
[1:00:29] holy spirit it's to it's to laugh at the
[1:00:31] holy spirit and it works for the holy
[1:00:33] spirit why because that's life or death
[1:00:37] to accept it or to reject it
[1:00:40] and jesus said i'll forgive you but
[1:00:41] there's coming a day it won't be
[1:00:42] forgiven
[1:00:44] that's right we don't we don't mock the
[1:00:45] things of god and that's why even if
[1:00:47] you're not sure if i'm not sure it's of
[1:00:49] god study it by the word don't mock it
[1:00:51] don't laugh at the gifts of god because
[1:00:53] to reject
[1:00:54] to reject it if it is god
[1:00:57] oh lord to reject it could be to take
[1:00:59] the mark of the beast now watch
[1:01:01] and someday he said now you see there's
[1:01:03] going to be a mark of the beast come
[1:01:04] some day let me tell you it's already
[1:01:05] come as soon as the holy ghost began to
[1:01:07] fall the mark of the beast began to take
[1:01:10] place
[1:01:11] he said you only have two things one of
[1:01:13] them is accept it takes the seal of god
[1:01:16] to reject it takes the mark of the beast
[1:01:19] oh don't you want to accept it today
[1:01:21] you realize how real and so many people
[1:01:23] have prepared themselves for that day
[1:01:25] and they're looking for it and they're
[1:01:26] saying oh when that day comes brother
[1:01:28] ben i'll never take a tattoo on my arm i
[1:01:30] tell you what i'll stand up and i i
[1:01:32] won't accept that that mark of the beast
[1:01:34] when it comes i won't accept that chip
[1:01:36] in my hand i'm not going to take that
[1:01:37] shot
[1:01:39] so many people will do that well i'm not
[1:01:41] going to do that that's wonderful but
[1:01:42] what about now
[1:01:44] what are you accepting this morning
[1:01:47] what are you rejecting this morning come
[1:01:49] on because since the holy ghost came
[1:01:51] what you accept and what you reject will
[1:01:53] tell your eternal destination see you've
[1:01:55] already been sealed away if you've
[1:01:57] accepted faith
[1:01:59] if you've accepted christ if you've
[1:02:00] accepted the word you've already been
[1:02:02] sealed away but to reject it is to take
[1:02:05] the mark of the beast he said you have
[1:02:06] two things is to accept it takes the
[1:02:08] seal of god to reject it takes the mark
[1:02:10] of the beast to reject the seal of god
[1:02:12] is to take the mark of the beast right
[1:02:14] everybody understand yes
[1:02:16] he said to reject the seal of god is to
[1:02:18] take the mark of the beast for the bible
[1:02:19] said all that was not sealed
[1:02:22] by the seal of god
[1:02:24] took the mark of the beast
[1:02:27] when the trumpet sounded and all wanted
[1:02:29] to go free could go and that didn't was
[1:02:32] marked
[1:02:33] he said now you see the mark of the
[1:02:34] beast if we talk about it in the future
[1:02:36] now watch there is a future
[1:02:37] manifestation of it it's going to be
[1:02:39] made manifest but remember it's got to
[1:02:42] be taken in accepted or rejected and
[1:02:43] then it's manifested yes
[1:02:46] right that's the mark of the beast what
[1:02:48] we're talking about in the future is
[1:02:49] when it's going to be made manifest
[1:02:52] when you realize it's what you've
[1:02:53] already done
[1:02:56] but he said so is the holy spirit
[1:02:59] oh my
[1:03:00] oh there's the positive side to it yes
[1:03:02] the mark of the beast is going to be
[1:03:04] manifested in those that believe not but
[1:03:06] so is the holy spirit
[1:03:08] going to be manifested in the bride
[1:03:11] amen he said when we see the lord jesus
[1:03:13] coming in glory oh how many are looking
[1:03:15] forward to that day
[1:03:17] feel that transforming power see the
[1:03:19] dead rising out of the grave and know
[1:03:21] that a second longer you can preach
[1:03:24] whatever you want to but this is what a
[1:03:25] prophet of god said he said a second
[1:03:27] longer will be changed and have a body
[1:03:29] like his
[1:03:30] but
[1:03:31] the bible puts it this way in a moment
[1:03:33] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:03:35] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:03:36] be changed
[1:03:38] what is that you'll be changed because
[1:03:40] you accepted the seal of god
[1:03:43] because you accepted the word of faith
[1:03:45] yes
[1:03:46] you heard god's word and you said lord
[1:03:48] be it unto me
[1:03:52] that's what mary did
[1:03:54] she accepted the seal the seed the seal
[1:03:56] of god because she said be it unto me
[1:03:59] according to your word that's what you
[1:04:01] and i are called to today are you with
[1:04:03] me this morning
[1:04:04] we are called to accept the word of god
[1:04:06] and to manifest the word of god like
[1:04:08] mary until one day we'll our bodies will
[1:04:11] change with it
[1:04:14] but you're manifesting it now but one
[1:04:15] day it'll come into full manifestation
[1:04:17] the same thing is true of the mark of
[1:04:18] the beast
[1:04:20] it's being manifested right now yes
[1:04:22] why they're doing the will of the church
[1:04:25] they're accepting the doctrines of the
[1:04:27] church
[1:04:28] right now
[1:04:30] one day it'll come into manifestation
[1:04:32] it's all around us church
[1:04:34] brother ben i'm waiting on the end times
[1:04:36] you better wake up
[1:04:40] if you're waiting on the end times you
[1:04:42] don't travel very much
[1:04:45] you say well in the big cities it's bad
[1:04:47] wake up
[1:04:50] our kids are fixing to go back to school
[1:04:52] and i

[1:04:59] look all around us i went to walmart
[1:05:01] last night get the kids a few things
[1:05:03] they needed at the last moment because
[1:05:05] i'm that kind of a dad
[1:05:09] but jeremy's with me show a saturday
[1:05:11] night before school starts that's when
[1:05:13] you do school shopping

[1:05:20] i i looked at the shirts and i'm she i
[1:05:23] guess she's in a women's shirt now so we
[1:05:25] were looking through the the women's
[1:05:27] clothing there at walmart on the
[1:05:28] clearance rack and you're looking
[1:05:30] through those things because they
[1:05:30] outgrow them pretty quick and looking
[1:05:32] through those things and i saw one had
[1:05:34] care bears on it i took a second look at
[1:05:36] it it said love is love
[1:05:39] at walmart
[1:05:41] it's it's promoting that ideology
[1:05:45] i walked into i walked to the other side
[1:05:47] of the store in the ice cream all you'd
[1:05:49] think you'd be safe in the ice cream
[1:05:50] aisle
[1:05:51] they had something there that spoke to
[1:05:53] me it said fat man

[1:06:04] thing here's the fat man ice cream i'm
[1:06:05] looking at that and they're on the other
[1:06:06] side pride ice cream

[1:06:11] through ice cream
[1:06:12] but they're pushing an agenda walmart is
[1:06:17] walmart is they can't sell much of this
[1:06:19] stuff but i will say this
[1:06:21] in even in our area among the young
[1:06:23] people
[1:06:25] we're holding on by by
[1:06:27] you say well this is a good area it is
[1:06:28] in a lot of ways but the young people
[1:06:30] are not being raised like you were
[1:06:31] raised
[1:06:34] they're being raised in a godless
[1:06:36] society
[1:06:38] oh god but that's that's the world
[1:06:40] that's the way it is
[1:06:42] but we're being raised according to the
[1:06:44] word of the gospel
[1:06:46] what are you listening to if you're
[1:06:47] waiting on the end time to be here it's
[1:06:49] here
[1:06:50] but so is the power of the holy ghost
[1:06:52] yes come on amen so is the word of god
[1:06:55] so is an open book yeah amen if you're
[1:06:58] waiting on the end time there was an
[1:06:59] angel that stood on land and sea and
[1:07:01] took an open book and said time shall be
[1:07:03] no more
[1:07:04] time is no more when he did that there
[1:07:06] was no more delay that's the hour we
[1:07:08] live in
[1:07:09] we live in the fullness of the opening
[1:07:10] of the word we live in the fullness
[1:07:12] there's never been a time when it was
[1:07:13] harder to be a christian and there's
[1:07:15] never been a time when it was easier to
[1:07:17] be a christian
[1:07:20] it's the best of times for the believer
[1:07:22] it's the worst of times for the
[1:07:23] unbeliever are you with me this morning
[1:07:27] man now
[1:07:28] he said you see about the mark of the
[1:07:29] beast but when we see jesus coming in
[1:07:31] glory and feel that transforming power
[1:07:34] will be changed and have a body like his
[1:07:35] he said it will be made manifest he said
[1:07:38] then to see those who rejected it will
[1:07:39] be left
[1:07:40] down and out he said now the outside man
[1:07:43] is a physical being which is controlled
[1:07:45] by five senses the inside man is a
[1:07:47] spirit man which is controlled by five
[1:07:49] senses conscience and love and so forth
[1:07:52] the outside men see taste feel smell and
[1:07:54] hear but the inside of that spirit is a
[1:07:56] soul and it's controlled by one thing
[1:07:59] your free will
[1:08:01] he said you can accept what the devil
[1:08:03] says or accept what god says
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:07] oh god
[1:08:08] you can't accept this morning what the
[1:08:10] devil says well the devil says i'm sick
[1:08:13] of course he does the devil says i can't
[1:08:15] be healed of course he does but you can
[1:08:17] accept what the devil says or what god
[1:08:19] says
[1:08:20] and that'll determine he said what
[1:08:23] spirit is in there
[1:08:25] if it's the spirit of god it'll feed on
[1:08:26] the things of god it won't feed on
[1:08:28] anything of the world jesus said if you
[1:08:30] love the world or the things of the
[1:08:31] world it's because the love of god has
[1:08:33] not even entered this inner part satan
[1:08:35] has deceived you and man shall not live
[1:08:37] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:08:39] proceeds out of the mouth of god or
[1:08:41] aren't you glad you got something to
[1:08:42] live on in this day when there's death
[1:08:44] all around us when the world has gone
[1:08:46] crazy and and there's death everywhere
[1:08:49] the death angel has gone through the
[1:08:50] land and spiritual death is in every
[1:08:52] denomination on every church aren't you
[1:08:54] glad to have a savior aren't you glad to
[1:08:56] have a word a redeeming word that has
[1:08:59] come down in our day to keep you from
[1:09:01] that thing to keep you alive why we've
[1:09:03] got bread we've got light yes amen we've
[1:09:06] got fire
[1:09:08] aren't you glad for that
[1:09:10] we know what seed we are
[1:09:12] because we accept it yeah right and
[1:09:15] brother branham goes on later in his
[1:09:16] ministry and it makes it really clear
[1:09:18] that you can't get blood out of a
[1:09:19] tournament
[1:09:21] right you you can't you can't make a a
[1:09:24] seat of god non-seed
[1:09:26] aren't you glad for that yes
[1:09:28] you can't make the elect non-elect right
[1:09:30] you can't make the non-elect elect right
[1:09:33] they are what they are
[1:09:34] but whether you accept or reject the
[1:09:37] word of god tells what you are yes
[1:09:40] oh my i always want to accept it don't
[1:09:42] you yes
[1:09:43] but now you have to accept it from that
[1:09:46] inner man now only a seed of god can do
[1:09:49] that
[1:09:50] he said my sheep
[1:09:53] my sheep
[1:09:55] hear my voice
[1:09:58] my sheep hear
[1:10:00] my voice they've been pre-programmed yes
[1:10:04] you ever you remember back in the day we
[1:10:06] had windows and went different versions
[1:10:08] the windows came out
[1:10:10] i don't know if y'all
[1:10:11] mess with computers very much but i can
[1:10:13] remember in an office a different
[1:10:14] version of windows would come out and
[1:10:16] eventually the stuff you had because we
[1:10:18] used to have things called cds
[1:10:20] before that it was floppy disk you have
[1:10:22] to ask your parents what that is
[1:10:24] but we had cds you know and we put had a
[1:10:26] cd-rom some of you still do and you have
[1:10:28] all your programs on that right but the
[1:10:30] problem was that eventually the
[1:10:32] technology reached a place where it
[1:10:33] wasn't it didn't recognize it anymore
[1:10:37] there's just no recognizable there was
[1:10:39] there was no representation there it
[1:10:41] wouldn't work on windows
[1:10:43] 11
[1:10:44] right it's just not going to work you're
[1:10:46] never going to get that old copy of of
[1:10:48] tetris that you've got on a cd to ever
[1:10:51] work
[1:10:52] on windows 11. it's never going to
[1:10:54] happen
[1:10:55] right because it's not compatible you
[1:10:57] realize that's the way non-seed are with
[1:10:58] the word
[1:11:00] it's just never compatible they may come
[1:11:02] to church
[1:11:03] they may sit around for a while and say
[1:11:05] well you know it seems like a pretty
[1:11:07] good theory like a good religion seems
[1:11:09] like it's wise seems good but then after
[1:11:11] a while something by and by they'll be
[1:11:12] offended because of the word but if
[1:11:14] there's a seed of god on the inside of
[1:11:16] you you've got compatibility you've got
[1:11:18] representation there's something inside
[1:11:20] of you that will always work with the
[1:11:22] word no matter how upgraded it is no
[1:11:24] matter how far we along we get you'll
[1:11:26] always work with the word amen
[1:11:29] why because you were built to do that
[1:11:31] you were pre-programmed
[1:11:33] to accept the word
[1:11:35] oh my you might as well give in to it
[1:11:37] this morning
[1:11:39] you're going to one day
[1:11:42] john 10 24
[1:11:43] i love this jesus the jews come to jesus
[1:11:46] and then came the jews round about him
[1:11:47] and said to him how long does thou make
[1:11:50] us to doubt
[1:11:51] there was the greatest preacher of faith
[1:11:53] that had ever lived
[1:11:55] who had the greatest signs and wonders
[1:11:58] proving who he was
[1:12:00] and the jews come to him and said you're
[1:12:02] making us doubt
[1:12:04] you know why because he was veiled
[1:12:07] yes it was the word veiled in flesh
[1:12:11] and they said how long does thou make us
[1:12:12] to doubt
[1:12:14] if thou be the christ tell us plainly
[1:12:17] that you're making us doubt you're
[1:12:19] hiding it
[1:12:20] jesus answered them i told you
[1:12:23] and you believe not
[1:12:25] the works that i do in my father's name
[1:12:28] they bear witness
[1:12:29] of me so jesus said i don't have to come
[1:12:32] out and say
[1:12:33] i'm the messiah
[1:12:34] because the works proof
[1:12:36] who i am listen to me you won't have to
[1:12:38] go out and and hold a sign say i'm a
[1:12:41] christian
[1:12:42] the works that you do every day and i'm
[1:12:44] not talking about having healing
[1:12:46] campaigns and running up and down the
[1:12:48] streets and things like that i'm not
[1:12:49] talking about that i'm talking about
[1:12:50] just what you do the way you live
[1:12:52] you'll be so different from the culture
[1:12:55] you'll be so different even even if you
[1:12:57] even if you looked alike to them and
[1:12:59] dressed in other things you would still
[1:13:00] be so different yes right and yet you
[1:13:03] are different in dress you are different
[1:13:05] in manners you are different in customs
[1:13:06] but when it comes to there's something
[1:13:08] inside of you people can tell there's a
[1:13:10] christian
[1:13:12] you're different you don't react like
[1:13:13] the world reacts
[1:13:15] you don't do what the world does and
[1:13:18] jesus said i told you and you believe
[1:13:20] not because the works that i do they
[1:13:22] bear witness to me if you're a christian
[1:13:24] today the works that you do will bear
[1:13:26] witness that you're a christian yes
[1:13:28] even if you're a child in school
[1:13:31] the works that you do will bear witness
[1:13:35] do you believe a child can be saved and
[1:13:36] be in school and bear witness to the
[1:13:38] word
[1:13:40] jesus did it wherever he was and jesus
[1:13:42] lives in us
[1:13:44] i tell you what though we better get
[1:13:45] them to christ yes
[1:13:48] because if we don't they'll just become
[1:13:49] what they're around right
[1:13:51] it's true oh god
[1:13:53] we better get them to christ
[1:13:56] now look
[1:13:58] he said my sheep hear my voice
[1:14:01] he said you believe not because you're
[1:14:02] not of my sheep as i said to you my
[1:14:04] sheep hear my voice and i know them and
[1:14:06] they follow me
[1:14:08] and i given to them eternal life
[1:14:10] aren't you glad for the gift of god
[1:14:12] today
[1:14:13] they shall never perish
[1:14:15] neither shall any man pluck them
[1:14:18] out of my hand
[1:14:20] now i want you as we continue on a
[1:14:22] little bit farther today and i may not
[1:14:23] get through all of this but we'll just
[1:14:25] go as far as we can
[1:14:27] now
[1:14:28] and then brother allen's going to preach
[1:14:29] to us tonight we haven't heard from
[1:14:31] brother allen in a while so it'll be
[1:14:32] good to hear him
[1:14:34] now
[1:14:35] satan's voice appears in the world now
[1:14:38] listen
[1:14:39] as the voice of reason yeah that's right
[1:14:43] satan's voice appears for the first time
[1:14:47] not as a voice of chaos
[1:14:50] not as a voice that was crazy some nut
[1:14:54] with some cult some jim jones
[1:14:57] that's not how satan's voice
[1:14:59] started
[1:15:01] it was the voice of reason yes
[1:15:04] it made sense
[1:15:06] right
[1:15:07] look genesis chapter 3 in verse 1
[1:15:10] and we find that the serpent was more
[1:15:13] subtle that word subtle is crafty shrewd
[1:15:16] sensible we'll show it in just a moment
[1:15:18] he said it's more subtle than any beast
[1:15:20] of the field which the lord god had made
[1:15:22] he said unto the woman yea hath god said
[1:15:25] ye shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:15:27] garden he starts out by quoting the word
[1:15:30] but he begins
[1:15:32] from a doubt
[1:15:34] from a doubting perspective it matters
[1:15:36] how you preach it how you say it
[1:15:40] because he said has god said
[1:15:42] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:15:43] garden now that's all true
[1:15:45] but he said he was more subtle than any
[1:15:47] beast of the field now that word
[1:15:49] acceptable subtle is crafty shrewd
[1:15:52] sensible and i hear this a lot said
[1:15:54] brother ben we want to be sane and
[1:15:56] sensible with the gospel and that's true
[1:15:58] that's the quote brother branham said
[1:15:59] that we want to be insane and sensible
[1:16:02] with the word yes right
[1:16:04] right but what appears sane and sensible
[1:16:07] is often not with the word right
[1:16:11] and when it's not we need to get rid of
[1:16:12] it right yes
[1:16:15] we need to see the word will make sense
[1:16:17] if you believe
[1:16:19] but if you don't believe
[1:16:21] it'll be a strange
[1:16:23] document yeah
[1:16:25] it doesn't make sense to the unbeliever
[1:16:28] you realize you've got to accept it
[1:16:29] before you can understand it
[1:16:33] it don't seem like it makes any sense
[1:16:35] but it's true you've got to come with an
[1:16:37] attitude of faith and accept the word or
[1:16:40] you'll never be able to understand the
[1:16:42] word
[1:16:43] you've got to accept the author of the
[1:16:44] word before he can make clear to you
[1:16:46] what the word is
[1:16:48] you've got to believe
[1:16:50] so you can't come to church and
[1:16:52] and
[1:16:53] i know that you don't do this i know
[1:16:55] that you're believers today but just in
[1:16:56] case that satan would ever you can't
[1:16:58] come to church cynical you can't come
[1:17:01] saying well you know i'm going to sit
[1:17:03] back here and i'm going to wait and if
[1:17:04] god wants me to know something he'll
[1:17:06] tell me no you've got to believe what
[1:17:08] you're listening to
[1:17:09] right you've got to believe what you're
[1:17:11] listening to brother branham the angel
[1:17:12] told brother said if you can get the
[1:17:14] people to believe you yes sir it's what
[1:17:16] we talked about last week like if satan
[1:17:19] can get the ministry uh to perform in
[1:17:21] such a way uh immoral or something else
[1:17:23] in front of the people it'll make the
[1:17:25] people disbelieve ministry
[1:17:28] and if you can get the people to
[1:17:29] disbelieve the ministry he's got them
[1:17:32] right because faith comes by hearing and
[1:17:34] the worst thing you can do is sit and
[1:17:36] listen week after week to something you
[1:17:37] don't believe right
[1:17:40] because you've been hurt or somebody did
[1:17:42] it this way somebody did it wrong this
[1:17:44] way but but you know you may have
[1:17:46] excuses but you'll never grow from that
[1:17:48] you've got to be able to believe
[1:17:51] and you've got to be able to separate
[1:17:52] the human part from from the word
[1:17:56] because the human part is always
[1:17:57] fallible brother branham was fallible
[1:18:00] brother branham made mistakes moses made
[1:18:02] mistakes
[1:18:03] joshua made mistakes but he said as i
[1:18:06] was with moses so i'll be with you
[1:18:09] preachers make mistakes
[1:18:11] somebody said amen
[1:18:13] pastors make mistakes
[1:18:15] song leaders make mistakes but we're not
[1:18:18] we are not basing our eternal
[1:18:19] destination on the works of a man but on
[1:18:22] the word of jesus christ
[1:18:25] you've got to believe what you're
[1:18:26] listening to and who you're listening to
[1:18:28] you're never going to get anything out
[1:18:29] of it right sure
[1:18:32] you got to have some confidence and
[1:18:34] that's why sometimes we'll work for
[1:18:35] years to build confidence before we'll
[1:18:38] do anything it's like being on the job
[1:18:39] if you go in first off
[1:18:41] right away you start firing people
[1:18:44] then
[1:18:45] some of you know what i'm talking about
[1:18:47] if you just go and start firing people
[1:18:49] after a while i learned that the hard
[1:18:50] way after a while you know people don't
[1:18:52] trust you and they they won't work for
[1:18:55] you because they don't know if you have
[1:18:56] their best interest at heart
[1:18:58] but if you go in and begin working and
[1:18:59] working and working and they see that
[1:19:01] you've got the best interest of the
[1:19:02] company at heart they'll work for you
[1:19:04] well the same is true in preaching the
[1:19:06] same is true of living for that matter
[1:19:08] being a husband being a wife
[1:19:10] you got things under you've got people
[1:19:12] that you want to listen to you want your
[1:19:13] kids to listen to you
[1:19:15] i watch this i've seen some message
[1:19:18] homes
[1:19:19] where there'll be
[1:19:20] y'all forgive me this morning
[1:19:22] i'm just kind of getting off my notes
[1:19:24] but i won't go over time the lord will
[1:19:26] and we'll just stop
[1:19:28] but there there's some message homes
[1:19:30] where the kids get to 18 and they're
[1:19:31] preparing to leave
[1:19:33] and they just go as soon as they hit 18.
[1:19:35] i mean just the day
[1:19:37] and i'm not exaggerating that and you
[1:19:39] watch that and you know maybe one kid
[1:19:41] would be that way but but you watch that
[1:19:42] with kid child after child after child
[1:19:44] and i'm always wondering what in the
[1:19:45] world is going on in the home yeah
[1:19:47] there may be nothing
[1:19:49] right but more than more than likely
[1:19:51] there's something going on in the home
[1:19:52] where
[1:19:53] where it's not being presented to them
[1:19:55] in a way that they can grab a hold of it
[1:19:58] and there's something there that's not
[1:19:59] being they don't trust their parents
[1:20:02] because the parent sits back there and
[1:20:04] when the preacher is preaching about
[1:20:06] anger
[1:20:07] and temper
[1:20:09] and the parent sits back there's amen
[1:20:11] pastor
[1:20:13] amen pastor we should not be angry
[1:20:16] throws a fit on the way home
[1:20:22] brother alan you got some cleaning up to
[1:20:24] do tonight
[1:20:27] you know you're teaching your children
[1:20:28] not to trust you that's right
[1:20:32] well we believe we believe the word we
[1:20:35] shouldn't do these certain things and
[1:20:36] you go do them
[1:20:38] you're teaching them known pastors who
[1:20:39] lived like that and they taught the
[1:20:40] church not to trust them yeah
[1:20:42] because they didn't live what they
[1:20:43] preach we sometimes teach our children
[1:20:46] and it's not legalism by the way but we
[1:20:48] teach them forgiveness
[1:20:50] we teach them how because we say we're
[1:20:52] sorry
[1:20:53] it teaches our children to know that
[1:20:55] there's forgiveness
[1:20:57] that teaches our children to know that
[1:20:58] there's mercy you're going to fail
[1:21:01] you're going to mess up but teach your
[1:21:03] children that when you fall down you get
[1:21:05] back up
[1:21:06] when you mess up you don't quit going to
[1:21:08] church
[1:21:11] when you when you have problems you
[1:21:12] don't lay down and lay out and go out in
[1:21:15] the bars and get drunk but you come back
[1:21:16] to the altar you come back to christ
[1:21:18] come on i think sometimes our kids need
[1:21:20] to see us at the altar
[1:21:22] we pray over the children but i like to
[1:21:24] pray over the children and the parents
[1:21:25] before they go to school because
[1:21:27] sometimes it's the parents that need it
[1:21:29] but the matter said it wasn't child
[1:21:30] delinquency he said it's parent
[1:21:32] delinquency
[1:21:33] oh god help us today we need to find our
[1:21:36] place at the altar so the children can
[1:21:38] find their place there we need to find
[1:21:40] our place in worship so the children can
[1:21:42] find their place there they're never
[1:21:44] going to be what we're not
[1:21:46] are you with me this morning
[1:21:48] i know that's hard but we got to live it
[1:21:51] or we're just teaching our children
[1:21:53] the opposite of what we intend to teach
[1:21:56] oh my
[1:21:57] when they see somebody who falls
[1:21:59] somebody who fails but somebody who gets
[1:22:01] back up
[1:22:02] somebody who finds their place back at
[1:22:04] the altar they can say i want a god like
[1:22:06] that yes
[1:22:09] because you will make mistakes some of
[1:22:10] you haven't lived long enough to make
[1:22:12] mistakes but your parents can tell you
[1:22:15] you will make mistakes
[1:22:19] you'll mess up it has nothing to do with
[1:22:21] whether you're a seed of god or not
[1:22:25] now look yeah
[1:22:27] god help us today
[1:22:29] satan said let me tell you something
[1:22:32] oh yeah we say god is true we believe
[1:22:34] that word now he always starts that way
[1:22:37] doesn't he satan said i believe that
[1:22:39] real sure but listen let me tell you he
[1:22:40] didn't exactly mean that he did mean
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:43] he meant just what he said
[1:22:46] genesis 3 2 the woman said to the
[1:22:48] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:22:49] trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[1:22:51] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:22:52] garden god has said you shall not eat of
[1:22:54] it neither shall you touch it lest you
[1:22:56] die
[1:22:57] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[1:22:59] shall not surely die or as brother
[1:23:01] branham said surely a good god
[1:23:03] wouldn't do that yeah
[1:23:05] you shall not surely die
[1:23:07] for god doth know that in the day you
[1:23:09] eat thereof your eyes shall be opened
[1:23:11] you shall be as gods
[1:23:13] knowing good
[1:23:14] and evil
[1:23:16] see there's some things
[1:23:18] god didn't want them to know
[1:23:21] i hope you hear me today
[1:23:23] i don't want my children to know what
[1:23:24] it's like to live in a broken home
[1:23:29] i don't want my children to know what
[1:23:30] it's like for their dad to be an
[1:23:31] alcoholic
[1:23:34] for their for their mother to be
[1:23:37] running around on the streets
[1:23:38] running the clubs i don't want them to
[1:23:40] know what that's like there are some
[1:23:41] things
[1:23:42] paul said i would that you were that you
[1:23:44] were wise concerning the gospel and that
[1:23:46] you were ignorant concerning the world
[1:23:48] sure
[1:23:50] some things god didn't want his children
[1:23:52] to know he didn't want them to know what
[1:23:54] it felt like
[1:23:55] to have heartache
[1:23:57] to lose a loved one
[1:23:59] to know what it's like to have murder or
[1:24:01] suicide
[1:24:02] god didn't want them to know what that
[1:24:04] felt like
[1:24:05] are you with me this morning he didn't
[1:24:07] want him to know there's some things
[1:24:09] you'd have been better off not knowing
[1:24:10] he said well i want to go out in the
[1:24:11] world so i'll know these things there's
[1:24:13] some things
[1:24:15] you'd be better off not knowing
[1:24:17] we don't want you to know what it feels
[1:24:19] like to come down and crash after a
[1:24:21] night of partying
[1:24:23] or a night of regret
[1:24:25] we don't want you to know what it feels
[1:24:26] like
[1:24:27] we want you to know what it feels like
[1:24:29] to come to the house of god
[1:24:31] and have freedom in worship we want you
[1:24:33] to know what it feels like to come and
[1:24:35] feel the presence of god moving in a
[1:24:38] mighty way through a soul that's not
[1:24:39] been scarred by all of those things that
[1:24:41] can still worship god that can still
[1:24:43] love god with all that they have
[1:24:46] we want you to know those things
[1:24:50] but if you do fall yeah
[1:24:52] if you do mess up and when you do
[1:24:55] i want you to know mercy
[1:24:58] i want you to feel what it's like to to
[1:25:00] know that there's mercy for you
[1:25:03] that's what god wanted for his children
[1:25:04] he knew they would mess up
[1:25:06] he knew that they would mess up he knew
[1:25:08] they would deny his word but he wanted
[1:25:10] them to know amen what mercy was like
[1:25:14] right
[1:25:15] hallelujah
[1:25:17] amen
[1:25:18] he said the devil said
[1:25:21] he said you don't have enough education
[1:25:24] he said but i've got wisdom
[1:25:26] i'll prove it to you he said now look
[1:25:28] you don't know what's right or wrong you
[1:25:29] know there is such a thing but you don't
[1:25:31] know what it is
[1:25:32] let me show you how it's done she said
[1:25:34] but we'll die
[1:25:35] he said surely god won't do that you
[1:25:37] know she'll be wise too
[1:25:39] he put his wisdom against god's word he
[1:25:41] said there's the wisdom i'm talking
[1:25:43] about but the brandon said wisdom as
[1:25:44] long as it agrees with the bible is
[1:25:46] right
[1:25:47] whenever wisdom doesn't agree with the
[1:25:49] word it isn't right
[1:25:52] listen to me this morning the word of
[1:25:53] god can be proven true
[1:25:58] god proves his own word
[1:26:01] it can be proven true but only if you
[1:26:04] believe it
[1:26:06] right yeah
[1:26:09] oh god
[1:26:11] it can be proven true it's proven true
[1:26:12] to abraham if you go to romans chapter 4
[1:26:15] and verse 17 or verse 18 he said who
[1:26:19] against hope believed in hope
[1:26:21] that he might become the father of many
[1:26:23] nations according to that which was
[1:26:25] spoken so shall thy seed be and being
[1:26:28] not weak in faith he considered not his
[1:26:30] own body now dead when he was about a
[1:26:32] hundred years old neither yet the
[1:26:33] deadness of sarah's womb he staggered
[1:26:35] not at the promise of god through
[1:26:37] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:26:39] glory to god and being fully persuaded
[1:26:41] that what he had promised he was able to
[1:26:43] also to perform therefore it was imputed
[1:26:45] to him for righteousness don't you see
[1:26:47] abraham believe god and it was imputed
[1:26:49] for righteousness abraham believed god
[1:26:51] and god proved it to be true you've got
[1:26:53] to believe god first
[1:26:55] right before it can be proved
[1:26:59] see that's that was the problem with
[1:27:01] with pilate that was the problem with
[1:27:02] herod they said to jesus prove to me
[1:27:04] that you're the messiah and i'll believe
[1:27:06] you
[1:27:07] that's what people say about the message
[1:27:08] today prove that the message is right
[1:27:10] prove that the cloud was a certain place
[1:27:12] at a certain time prove all these things
[1:27:14] then we'll believe no if you believe
[1:27:16] he'll prove it to you but if you don't
[1:27:18] believe you it can never be proven yes
[1:27:21] are you with me now
[1:27:23] he said no matter how there's no
[1:27:24] reasoning to it at all he just takes the
[1:27:27] word and holds on to it speaking of
[1:27:29] abraham he said now if this is the word
[1:27:31] of god if this is the word of god if you
[1:27:34] believe it then why doubt any word of it
[1:27:38] can we say amen to that this morning if
[1:27:41] this is the word of god and this is the
[1:27:43] word of god
[1:27:45] this is it folks
[1:27:46] you're going to find out what brother
[1:27:47] branham taught we believe what brother
[1:27:49] branham taught because he opened to us
[1:27:50] the scriptures
[1:27:52] how did they know who jesus was he
[1:27:54] opened the scriptures to them
[1:27:56] and showed him who he was
[1:27:58] we believe in the message of the hour
[1:28:00] that shine light on the scriptures
[1:28:02] this is the word of god
[1:28:04] this is what we hold to there's no other
[1:28:07] standard the standard is not what my
[1:28:08] family preaches what my church teaches
[1:28:11] the standard is not what other message
[1:28:13] people do
[1:28:14] this is it yes
[1:28:16] the word of god is the standard
[1:28:18] right and so he said there's no
[1:28:20] reasoning to it
[1:28:21] he just takes the word and holds on to
[1:28:23] it how many of you can hold on to the
[1:28:25] word this morning
[1:28:27] and he said why doubt any word of it any
[1:28:29] promise of it how can you say that this
[1:28:31] is part and this is no good so you take
[1:28:34] your bible and you say well i believe
[1:28:35] this part not this
[1:28:37] and this is no good and this is that
[1:28:39] pick out what you want can't do it
[1:28:42] right you can't take the the modern
[1:28:44] church today is trying to take romans 1
[1:28:46] out of the bible you can't do it right
[1:28:50] many people try to take certain passages
[1:28:52] and i've heard this let me just nail
[1:28:54] this before i before i leave this
[1:28:57] morning i've heard this well the prophet
[1:28:59] said to a certain individual
[1:29:03] so i don't have to believe this part of
[1:29:04] the word
[1:29:07] if it's the word it's the word
[1:29:11] paul said those things you heard of me
[1:29:12] among many witnesses yeah teach that as
[1:29:15] doctrine yes
[1:29:16] right this is the word not a man's
[1:29:18] opinion not my opinion
[1:29:20] whenever a pastor's opinion becomes
[1:29:22] higher than the word of the church has a
[1:29:23] problem right
[1:29:25] yes
[1:29:27] you ought to be able these school
[1:29:28] children ought to be able to come to me
[1:29:30] and if i'm not on the word they ought to
[1:29:31] be able to challenge me on it
[1:29:34] why because the word is the word
[1:29:36] right whether the preacher believes it
[1:29:38] or not
[1:29:39] the word is right whether the church
[1:29:41] teaches it or not
[1:29:42] he said if this is the word of god you
[1:29:44] believe it don't doubt any word of it he
[1:29:45] said you can't pick out part of it it's
[1:29:47] either all good or there's none of it
[1:29:49] good he said as soon as you see that
[1:29:50] it's the truth you've got to believe it
[1:29:52] first
[1:29:53] take hold of it
[1:29:55] don't turn it loose no matter what
[1:29:56] circumstances how they try to reason why
[1:29:59] you can't don't do that he said it all
[1:30:01] stay right with it god promised it
[1:30:03] he said now faith simply trusts in his
[1:30:05] word that's what he wanted them to do he
[1:30:07] said now you get the background he said
[1:30:08] that's exactly what god wanted the human
[1:30:10] race to do to trust in every word he
[1:30:13] said
[1:30:14] and eve trusted a whole lot of it but
[1:30:16] one little thing she accepted
[1:30:18] she accepted unbelief in one word
[1:30:21] oh god he said well if i become full of
[1:30:23] wisdom maybe it was that way maybe it's
[1:30:25] supposed to be this way then right there
[1:30:26] is where she lost her hold
[1:30:28] that's where she started sinking right
[1:30:30] there this message you'll never be able
[1:30:32] to teach it in such a way as to make it
[1:30:34] psychology
[1:30:36] it'll never work because psychology has
[1:30:38] error in it
[1:30:40] it may be able to identify certain
[1:30:41] things but it has error in it science
[1:30:44] has error in it but the word has no
[1:30:46] error in it we don't understand why it's
[1:30:49] right but it's right
[1:30:52] we can't even see why it's right but
[1:30:53] it's right and then god reveals it to us
[1:30:56] yes
[1:30:58] and then right there is where she lost
[1:31:00] her hold that's where she started
[1:31:01] sinking right there that's where the
[1:31:02] whole human race went right down to the
[1:31:04] grave right there because she doubted
[1:31:05] one word some of them say well i believe
[1:31:07] this is true i believe that's true i
[1:31:09] believe god can say but i don't believe
[1:31:11] he heals i believe the holy ghost sure
[1:31:13] fell on the day of pentecost but there's
[1:31:14] no place where there's anything anything
[1:31:16] says the holy ghost fell after pentecost
[1:31:18] he said oh brother that's the way they
[1:31:20] say it
[1:31:21] call themselves the churches of christ
[1:31:23] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:31:25] the power thereof you must believe
[1:31:28] don't reason believe don't try to have
[1:31:30] wisdom believe the word
[1:31:32] and wonder how much
[1:31:34] of what we've attributed to pastoral
[1:31:36] wisdom
[1:31:37] is just unbelief
[1:31:47] i know when i say when i preach about
[1:31:49] pastors it's hard to say amen because i
[1:31:51] am one
[1:31:52] brother bennett we are we amen and
[1:31:53] against you but it's truth
[1:31:58] you can take that what you want it to
[1:32:00] but look the word is right
[1:32:02] if the pastor's wisdom goes along with
[1:32:03] the word then it's right but if the
[1:32:05] pastor wisdom said pastors wisdom says
[1:32:07] oh you can't fellowship with those
[1:32:08] people it's not what the word right
[1:32:11] that's true if the pastor's wisdom says
[1:32:13] well we're going to do things a certain
[1:32:15] way well they the holy ghost don't
[1:32:16] really fall like it used to stay with
[1:32:17] the word
[1:32:20] just believe the word
[1:32:22] you see god's going to judge by some
[1:32:23] standard it won't be by any message
[1:32:25] faster that's right right it's true all
[1:32:27] right
[1:32:28] and you're not going to be able to make
[1:32:30] it in because you said oh i accepted the
[1:32:32] pastor's word hallelujah
[1:32:36] every word he said every word he ever
[1:32:38] said across the pulpit brother ben was
[1:32:40] my pastor and i accepted it i went to
[1:32:42] such and such a church in the message
[1:32:43] and i accepted every word he said you're
[1:32:45] probably not going to make it
[1:32:48] because every word i say may not be thus
[1:32:49] saith the lord
[1:32:51] what do you accept the word the word
[1:32:56] are you with me this morning yes you
[1:32:57] have to trust me to believe it but you
[1:32:59] got to accept the word
[1:33:02] you must believe don't reason believe
[1:33:04] don't try to have wisdom believe the
[1:33:05] word not your pastor not the church not
[1:33:07] anything else the word yes
[1:33:10] believe the word because that's what
[1:33:12] god's going to judge the world by right
[1:33:15] see the bible says that no script no
[1:33:16] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:33:18] private interpretation because the
[1:33:19] prophecy came not an old time by the
[1:33:21] will of men but holy men of god's fake
[1:33:23] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[1:33:26] but the branham said faith believes it
[1:33:27] is written and says the word has no
[1:33:29] flaws
[1:33:30] why don't we repeat that this morning
[1:33:32] the word
[1:33:33] has no flaws
[1:33:36] do you believe that
[1:33:38] the word
[1:33:39] has no flaws
[1:33:42] oh god he said he said well he was
[1:33:44] talking about his own word that's not
[1:33:45] what he said
[1:33:46] he said did you ever hear ministers say
[1:33:48] well i tell you the king james version
[1:33:50] or this revised version or this here
[1:33:52] it's just a little different really it
[1:33:54] don't really mean that have you heard
[1:33:55] that he said oh my the world is
[1:33:57] contaminated with it but faith don't
[1:33:59] believe that what's he talking about the
[1:34:01] bible
[1:34:02] faith believes a god that can make me
[1:34:05] you believe god made you brother wyatt
[1:34:07] god made you
[1:34:09] god made you the bible says we're
[1:34:10] fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:34:13] the god made you if god made you then he
[1:34:16] can keep the word right
[1:34:18] if god made me a god that can make me
[1:34:21] can keep that book in order for me to
[1:34:24] live by
[1:34:25] oh my if the god who made me is going to
[1:34:28] judge me can't keep his book in order
[1:34:29] then he's a very poor god he said there
[1:34:32] you are i believe every word of it is
[1:34:34] the truth yes sir what does this do to
[1:34:36] believe that it gives faith a perfect
[1:34:38] resting place in it
[1:34:40] he said see you cannot disbelieve that
[1:34:42] he said that that word is messed with in
[1:34:44] any way you've got to believe it just
[1:34:46] the way it is
[1:34:48] again you can come and try to prove it
[1:34:50] where it would make sense to people part
[1:34:52] of it's not right and part of it is
[1:34:54] there are many denominations to try to
[1:34:56] prove mark 16 is not in the original
[1:34:58] but if you take that
[1:35:00] tax you preach unbelief to the people
[1:35:02] and you end up with a lifeless morgue
[1:35:04] but if you preach faith to the people we
[1:35:06] believe what the word says
[1:35:08] what comes out of it is a church full of
[1:35:11] the holy ghost
[1:35:12] and faith
[1:35:13] because that's the power of the word
[1:35:15] he said if you try to use wisdom
[1:35:18] and say now look here it's not
[1:35:19] reasonable that god said it would do a
[1:35:20] thing like this but god did do it yeah
[1:35:23] see a preacher is not
[1:35:26] a
[1:35:26] philosopher a preacher is not
[1:35:29] a psychologist
[1:35:31] a preacher is a proclaimer
[1:35:34] what the word says that's what the
[1:35:36] preacher has to preach
[1:35:37] what he's inspired about the word
[1:35:40] you understand and so it's not we're not
[1:35:42] here to to try to reason with you and
[1:35:43] try to tell you it don't mean what it
[1:35:45] says
[1:35:45] he said now if you say well now if god
[1:35:47] did this if he took a man's life because
[1:35:48] he wasn't a levite but his hand on the
[1:35:50] ark one was about to fall no matter how
[1:35:52] much he was he said he took his life for
[1:35:54] it god said just levi shalom would touch
[1:35:56] that now i know that people have taken
[1:35:58] this and said well only a minister can
[1:35:59] handle the word and i don't see where
[1:36:01] brother branham taught that
[1:36:03] he did teach us that there were some
[1:36:04] doctrines and things that would be
[1:36:06] better if you left that to your pastor
[1:36:07] to explain
[1:36:09] right because god didn't call that god
[1:36:11] didn't call you to do that
[1:36:13] right but he didn't ever tell you not to
[1:36:15] touch the word
[1:36:18] listen what he said a levite nothing but
[1:36:19] a levite was supposed to touch the ark
[1:36:21] and here the ark was coming right back
[1:36:23] for revival one outside of that tried to
[1:36:24] handle the word he said it goes to show
[1:36:27] only the anointed of god has touched
[1:36:28] that word he doesn't say just preachers
[1:36:31] he said the anointed of god
[1:36:33] he said these creeds and denominations
[1:36:35] got no business tampering with it right
[1:36:37] so you don't put your hand on it
[1:36:40] the preacher's hand the person would lay
[1:36:41] at his hand we don't put our hands on it
[1:36:44] if you don't understand it don't try to
[1:36:46] explain it
[1:36:47] live it yes believe it yes are you with

[1:36:57] right to that word and it's death for
[1:36:58] any other to touch it yes
[1:37:00] or to disbelieve any of it or teach it
[1:37:03] amen he said the same will be taking his
[1:37:05] part out of the book of life don't put
[1:37:06] your hands on it stay away from it
[1:37:08] listen believe just what it says how
[1:37:10] many could do that this morning believe
[1:37:12] what it says take what it said stay
[1:37:14] right with the word it's death to do
[1:37:15] anything else to it
[1:37:17] what does faith do it believes it just
[1:37:19] the way it is
[1:37:20] amen that's the way god has preserved it
[1:37:22] down to the age and here it is it's the
[1:37:24] word of god for me how many believe that
[1:37:26] this morning it's the word of god for me
[1:37:29] god honors that he said it gives a
[1:37:31] perfect faith in its trueness how could
[1:37:33] you go out here and say here's a boat
[1:37:34] it's got a lot of holes in i'll put some
[1:37:36] grass sacks in it perhaps maybe it'll
[1:37:38] stem the tide to cross the river he said
[1:37:40] i wouldn't want to take a chance on it
[1:37:42] yes
[1:37:43] you remember being at the nile river in
[1:37:44] egypt and here we were waiting on a
[1:37:46] ferry and here come a bunch of taxis
[1:37:49] water taxis just a canoe
[1:37:51] looked like it had been made out of a
[1:37:52] log or something just a little a little
[1:37:54] wooden canoe and the great nile river
[1:37:56] there and here's come these guys with
[1:37:58] the canoe now they say the the river
[1:37:59] there is too polluted for crocodiles but
[1:38:01] i wasn't taking any chances
[1:38:04] plus i can't swim
[1:38:07] and i don't think joel can't either so
[1:38:09] he couldn't help me
[1:38:10] so we're standing there at the river and
[1:38:12] those guys come come on come on you know
[1:38:13] they sit there
[1:38:14] at the bank and want you to take their
[1:38:16] taxi across why would i take that taxi
[1:38:18] when there was a ferry coming made out
[1:38:20] of metal i think it was
[1:38:22] made out of better material anyway
[1:38:24] that it proved it could cross the river
[1:38:26] time and time again why would we take
[1:38:28] man's ideas
[1:38:29] why would we take some guy on youtube
[1:38:31] when there's a fairy when there's a book
[1:38:34] amen let's cross the river time and time
[1:38:36] again
[1:38:37] this word has proved itself to be true
[1:38:40] over and over and over again oh my i'm
[1:38:42] going to close now as the catholic
[1:38:44] church came along and tried to keep the
[1:38:46] word out of the people's hands by
[1:38:48] reasoning martin luther read the just
[1:38:50] shall live by faith and when he believed
[1:38:51] that word and accepted it a reformation
[1:38:53] shook europe the boat crossed the river
[1:38:56] when john wesley read without holiness
[1:38:58] no man shall see the lord and accepted
[1:39:00] it as sanctification in his life he
[1:39:02] accepted it as the word of god england
[1:39:04] and america shook under that revival
[1:39:07] the azusa street pentecostals read that
[1:39:09] god put nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:39:11] church and change the course of history
[1:39:13] god did it within less than 50 years and
[1:39:15] now pentecostalism's all over the world
[1:39:17] why because somebody believed god's word
[1:39:20] yes
[1:39:21] it took it took somebody to say it's
[1:39:23] true
[1:39:26] are you with me this morning
[1:39:28] brother branham read hebrews 13 and 8
[1:39:31] luke 17 and 30.
[1:39:33] revelation 10 1-7
[1:39:35] and stood there and said it's true
[1:39:38] and proved it to be true yes
[1:39:40] oh my we've seen the sign of the son of
[1:39:43] man the opening of the seven seals god
[1:39:45] proves his word he interprets his word
[1:39:47] by bringing it to pass but now it's our
[1:39:49] day yes or you hear me today and now
[1:39:52] that the fields have been opened we read

[1:40:13] them they believed as many as the lord
[1:40:14] our god shall call it's true
[1:40:16] the bible said there would come a
[1:40:18] prophet in the last age we've seen it
[1:40:19] it's true
[1:40:21] the bible said
[1:40:22] that the church would be a spotless
[1:40:25] bride without spot or wrinkle washed in
[1:40:27] the blood of the lamb i'm here to
[1:40:28] proclaim to you this morning it's true
[1:40:31] don't reason with it don't try to take
[1:40:33] wisdom and say well it's not what it was
[1:40:34] supposed to be it's true it has to be
[1:40:36] true
[1:40:38] or it'll never prove itself true to you
[1:40:40] yes
[1:40:41] well what do we do in this age
[1:40:42] revelation 10 and 8
[1:40:44] amen
[1:40:46] he proves himself
[1:40:48] he said the voice which i heard from
[1:40:49] heaven speaking to me again and said go
[1:40:50] and take the little book
[1:40:52] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:40:53] which standeth upon the scene upon the
[1:40:55] earth and went unto the angels and said
[1:40:56] to him give me the little book he said
[1:40:58] take it and eat it up it shall make that
[1:40:59] belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth
[1:41:01] sweet as honey i took the little book
[1:41:02] out of the angel's hand what did i do
[1:41:04] with it i didn't reason with it i didn't
[1:41:06] cut it apart but i ate it yes
[1:41:08] i ate it up and it was in my mouth
[1:41:10] sweetest honey as soon as i had eaten it
[1:41:12] my belly was bitter there were things in
[1:41:14] it hard to digest
[1:41:16] and he said unto me that must prophesy
[1:41:17] again
[1:41:18] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:41:21] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:41:23] kings somebody's got to read that word
[1:41:26] and say it's true
[1:41:28] it's true
[1:41:31] we read that today and like the eagles
[1:41:33] scream we say mama
[1:41:35] that's me i've heard that somewhere
[1:41:36] before
[1:41:37] i identify with that it proves itself to
[1:41:39] be true musicians go ahead and come
[1:41:41] the bible says
[1:41:43] you are manifestly declared to be the
[1:41:45] epistle of christ
[1:41:47] written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:41:49] of the living god
[1:41:51] not in tables of stone
[1:41:53] but in fleshy tables of the heart you
[1:41:55] say well
[1:41:56] the people at school don't believe it
[1:41:58] let him prove it to be true by your life
[1:42:03] the people at work don't believe it let
[1:42:04] him prove it to be true the people at
[1:42:06] the church don't believe it let him
[1:42:08] prove it to be true
[1:42:10] by your life
[1:42:11] he proves his own word
[1:42:14] amen but we can't take satan's wisdom
[1:42:17] we must cast down reasonings
[1:42:19] accept the word in his fullness
[1:42:21] and let the word
[1:42:23] prove itself true
[1:42:25] would you bow your heads with me just
[1:42:26] before we we're gonna have prayer in
[1:42:28] just a moment for the school children
[1:42:30] and teachers and parents
[1:42:35] maybe satan's tried to come at you in
[1:42:37] some way
[1:42:38] to get you to disbelieve the word well
[1:42:40] maybe it don't matter
[1:42:43] did god say it
[1:42:45] is it in the word i'll go as far as this
[1:42:48] don't cross the message of the hour
[1:42:50] that's the light god sent on the word
[1:42:53] if you're knowingly living outside the
[1:42:54] message doing things you know brother
[1:42:57] branham taught from the bible
[1:42:59] wasn't right
[1:43:00] you sit there and you try to reason with
[1:43:02] it just just let it go
[1:43:05] let the word be proved true in your life
[1:43:07] let him prove himself true to your
[1:43:09] family to your children to your church
[1:43:13] one day they may never accept it but one
[1:43:15] day they'll stand on that day of
[1:43:16] judgment and say god you proved yourself
[1:43:18] to be true
[1:43:20] you proved it through my life
[1:43:24] let's just pray that way heavenly father
[1:43:27] i pray lord that you would work in the
[1:43:28] lives of each one of these people
[1:43:31] or maybe there's someone here who's just
[1:43:33] not
[1:43:34] living the word like they know they
[1:43:36] should i i pray you'd help them to live
[1:43:38] it today

[1:43:41] power and demonstration of the spirit
[1:43:44] i pray it would be so
[1:43:45] lord i pray you would release us from
[1:43:47] all guilt all
[1:43:48] all shame all
[1:43:50] all of the things of the world
[1:43:52] help us to know that lord we've found
[1:43:54] mercy and grace at the foot of the cross
[1:43:57] lord if there's something of unbelief
[1:43:58] comes in and
[1:44:00] and lord it tries to take over our mind
[1:44:01] help us to arrest it
[1:44:03] to send it back to the borders where it
[1:44:05] came from
[1:44:06] another thought may come in but that one
[1:44:08] didn't ever take hold and build a house
[1:44:11] i pray and grant it today
[1:44:13] lord we ask that you come and lord bless
[1:44:16] these people lord that have heard the
[1:44:18] word today may it create an atmosphere
[1:44:20] of faith not of unbelief

[1:44:24] lord may it be an atmosphere of faith
[1:44:26] lord i believe i believe there's a
[1:44:28] reason why i've responded to the word i
[1:44:31] believe that you're my savior believe
[1:44:33] that you're my god
[1:44:34] everything's gonna be okay
[1:44:36] i pray you'd grant that today we ask you
[1:44:38] in jesus name
[1:44:40] amen let's sing this together
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:55] revelations
[1:45:06] nations
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:39] oh yes overcoming sins
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:59] amen you believe it today
[1:46:01] amen god bless you
[1:46:04] just before you come
[1:46:07] every year i struggle with whether to
[1:46:08] send my kids back to public school i'll
[1:46:10] just be open and honest with you i i do
[1:46:13] i worry about the influences i worry
[1:46:15] about the struggles that they'll have
[1:46:18] and every year we have because the lord
[1:46:21] has made a way
[1:46:22] and we're not very good teachers but
[1:46:24] i'll leave that up to you as far as what
[1:46:26] you do or some children probably
[1:46:27] shouldn't be in public school you as
[1:46:29] parents you know that better than
[1:46:31] anybody else and
[1:46:32] you know how to handle that god will
[1:46:34] give you wisdom to handle that
[1:46:36] but i know it's a scary feeling
[1:46:39] especially when there's been these these
[1:46:41] murders these mass killings
[1:46:44] that taking place in the school system
[1:46:46] and you look out and you think is there
[1:46:48] any place safe
[1:46:50] why would someone kill children
[1:46:52] what kind of a devil would motivate
[1:46:54] somebody to do that
[1:46:56] and i'm not scaring you this morning you
[1:46:58] know the possibilities of that you know
[1:47:00] if a person is determined to do
[1:47:01] something like that
[1:47:03] but we believe that the angel of god's
[1:47:05] protection comes down
[1:47:07] and protects our children
[1:47:09] takes care of them some of you the older
[1:47:11] ones going to school by the trip brother
[1:47:13] peter

[1:47:18] ones here by the levi knows what that's
[1:47:21] like sister noli they've come through
[1:47:22] the
[1:47:23] some of the public school system at
[1:47:25] least through part and they know what
[1:47:26] that's like
[1:47:28] but they made it and they're christians
[1:47:30] today some of you come through public
[1:47:31] school and you made it
[1:47:33] what you need is the holy ghost in your
[1:47:35] life you need that you need that
[1:47:37] reassurance you need to believe the word
[1:47:40] believe the word if someone asks you a
[1:47:42] question why do you do what you do i
[1:47:44] believe the bible
[1:47:45] i believe it's the word of god don't let
[1:47:47] anybody talk you out of that you can
[1:47:49] come keep coming to church you i know
[1:47:51] it's tiring when you get to that time
[1:47:53] and

[1:47:55] kids are in school that's the time to
[1:47:57] come to church
