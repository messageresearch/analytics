don't mind this but joel told me this week that they were planning on making this their church home so we're grateful for that and uh you know the lord has a way of giving us what we have need of and as a church i believe we're meant to be here if we're meant to be here god had it in his plan for us to be here and he surely has someone here for us to preach someone for me to preach to and someone for you to hear and it'll always be that way no matter who stands behind the pulpit there's always going to be somebody to hear the word of the lord as long as we're here we're going to keep preaching we're going to still having keep having church and keep glorifying god with our lives let's stand together let's sing a little chorus before we go back into the word just just we want to know that his presence is with us we know that he is but we want to know and feel his presence with us let's see in the presence of jehovah for just a moment before we go into the word isn't god good to us isn't it

in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to luke chapter 4 and verses 25 and 26 luke chapter 4 verses 25 and 26 i want to continue talking about who is worthy but just take a little maybe completely different uh approach to it and speak this morning a worthy widow [Music] luke chapter 4 and verse 25. remember we'll have brother ivy with us next sunday morning so we're looking forward to that speaking for us next sunday morning luke 4 25 but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months and great famine was throughout all the land until none of them was elias said save unto sraptor the city of sidon to a woman that was a widow we didn't send elijah to just anybody aren't you glad he was sent to you amen pray the lord his blessing to the word may be seated it must have been almost daylight when the little woman turned her weary head on pillow she's been tossing and turning all night she heard a mournful little cry across the room there's something different about the cry of a child who's really hurt in distress his child was hungry and she'd not been able to sleep because she was so worried a little boy woke up every 20-30 minutes through the night and you can hear his little voice say mama i want you to go out and look in the pantry again see if there's just one little piece of bread i'm so hungry i can't sleep she looked at those face with his cheek sinking in his eyes turning yellow his hair hanging down from failing to be cut a little ragged night shirt on tears rolling down down his face and she patted him on the cheek and said try to sleep try to understand there have been three years with no rain you know no matter how bad we have it somebody somebody always has it worse three years they've been without rain and she knelt down on the floor she began to cry out to god she said oh god i've done my best to live true and to be right here i am i see my little boy crying for something to eat i've got nothing to give him for many weeks now we've been just allowing ourselves a cup full of meal or just a spoonful of oil every three or four days trying to hold it off until daylight you will not have to die during the night we don't see that kind of devastation much anymore in our country we're so blessed caleb we're so blessed that our children can be born at the country that they are we may have difficulties but the last time i dedicated a baby was in west africa in lomi togo and i held a little baby in my arms like little baby henry only had a cleft flip and there's not any doctors to speak of in that town they have one hospital it's a city of a million people they call it the morgue because you go there to die and he had a cleft lip but i'll never forget that and it always struck me because my thought was you know if the lord doesn't heal then he'll just be his whole life like that and so it makes you pray earnestly for healing because of that but this is the kind of situation that the little woman was in it was life or death and so she began to pray that that kind of a situation will make you pray and the thing that i noticed about being in that kind of despair and among those kind of people is that they they knew how to pray they knew how to reach out to god right and a pastor john baduca told me his church several hundred people and he told me he said on wednesday nights he said sometimes they'll have prayer night and i said well how does that how does that work for you guys he said well we we pray he said i'll pray and i'll say now we're going to pray for the brothers in america and this is the way they do now we're going to pray for the brothers in america they'll pray not for five minutes or ten minutes but the congregation will pray as a congregation for now and then they'll say well we'll pray for healing for this one and they'll pray they'll pray they'll pray four five six hours at a time because they've got no answers anywhere else there's no way to get help any other way and i got to experience that and this kind of a desperation sets in and i think sometimes god allows these things to happen in our life i know that he allows these things to happen in our lives so that we get in that kind of desperation he wants to hear his children cry out too we need to cry out to god every moment of our lives but many times we don't do it until we get in a desperate situation this woman would hit the desk where they cry out she said i've lived true my husband was lost in battle for the lord and i've been a widow for many years and tried to live right keep your commandments and it's my time to go i don't mind but my little boy just tears my heart the pieces to here and begged for something to eat with nothing to give him she got finished praying she she raised up and he'd come back to sleep again for a few minutes she had her arms up and the little ragged night count she was wearing was just about gone she goes to the window and looks out and just about to break day it was so hot not only naturally but the hot winds of judgment was blowing on a nation and forgotten god and when that happens the innocents suffer with the guilty it's not just the guilty that suffer but the innocent suffer as well and so when a nation rejects god it affects everybody it affects us how did this nation of israel get in that place brother branham explains that elijah in the meal offering he said that was during the reign of ahab israel's most cruel and wicked king and he had married a sinner jezebel who was an idolater the mixed wedding like that is never successful it just can't be that the woman will come the man's way or the man will go the woman so even though the scripture says not to be unequally yoked and he said that this woman that they have married jezebel she was a very attractive little woman and ahab was kind of a lukewarm believer and he said he did give in to her ideas and said oh well religion is nothing for me i'm a king as long as they tore down the altars of god and put up the altars of baal the cry had been so much against the true religion to the ministers he said under that great strain given away i believe there's a great strain on the ministry again today great strain not only on denominational ministry but on us to try to get us to back away from the word but the word is still true god's word is it still works and the word of god is like this that if god speaks something in his word and he says something it's a law of god it's a word it's something that's true it's not just true because well i get the opportunity to follow it i'll follow but if not i want won't know it works because it's true just like the law of gravity is true if i pick this book up and drop it it's going to drop it's going to fall because there's a law that says it's going to fall and and there's a law that says certain things have to be a certain way and that's god that's just the way things work that's the way he made us so if we as a country don't follow that if we as the church will follow that we we get into the pressure of the day then what happens is we bear the ramifications of that there's results that come from not following god so brother brandon says so long had the ministers fell under the impact of the king because sin was permitted there was no limits he said it's a very good picture of today because the nation had endorsed these things that's the age that we're living in today when the nation endorses sin he said the people wanted to be popular they thought as long as the nation said so it was all right that's the way they say today as long as the nation says it's all right to sell beer but it's all right to drink it if the nation permits our women to have dressed on the street the law won't run in why it's all right to do it it might be all right to the nation but in god's great books you're responsible and we'll have to answer before god he said but they had fallen and given away under the load now and this joel is something that we've got to remember that as time goes on the separation between the world and the bible is going to get farther and farther until finally it's going to get to a place where it's going to be hard just to just to live and do your business and things because because just trying to live godly in this world is going to be so difficult but remember it was that way in that first church age when they had those the roman system had taken over everything that was ungodly and they mandated that you worship their gods but still christianity stood that early church stood why because they served a god that was able to keep them amen and we serve a god that's able to keep us until that day when we leave here so we don't have to give in to those things but there was one who was still old-fashioned he said to believe that there was a god that was old-fashioned believe that there was a god that kept his word do we believe that this morning is there somebody here that believes that god keeps his breath he believes that there's a an old-fashioned god a god who's the same yesterday today and forever believed that the god of abraham isaac and jacob was holy and required complete surrender to his holiness he said but jezebel and her modernist crew hated him he was their pastor but they didn't believe it so he had to hide for his life for schemes 17 let's look at it in the scripture for a moment now we've we've set the background here's this woman this woman this gentile woman that jesus said elijah could have went to many widows there were many widows there many people suffering the same things by the day that she was suffering but there was one that was sent a prophet amen and in first kings 1701 if you have your bibles with you or you can read on the screen it says elijah the tishbite was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word he was certain of god wasn't it he was confident that what he said was going to come to pass the word of the lord came unto him saying get the hints turn the eastward and hide thyself for the brook cherith that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according to the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the book sheriff that is before jordan the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook now i got all kinds of questions there you know how did the ravens get the flesh was it cooked it must have been he didn't die from it how did they cook it you know what kind of ovens did they set up and brother tells us that elijah didn't ask any of these questions he just believed god somehow a sandwich bread and meat showed up every day a sandwich they brought a sandwich in the morning and a sandwich in the evening and he drank the water and he was content right what was it but the relative elijah had a secret place provided by god himself don't you know god's still a proprietor of that secret place he had a secret place provided by god himself he said now the church never provided it for him the king never provided him for it he didn't provide it himself but god provided a secret place for elijah to be fed amen all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day don't you know god's big enough to provide a church where you can go and hear the gospel preach god's big enough to provide a place for you to go god's big enough to provide a place in a community we may be a secret place but god will provide it and more than that he has a place for you in christ the secret place for you in christ that you can go and you can he'll carry your burdens he said he said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden then i will give you rest aren't you glad you serve a god like that amen so he says his food was provided day by day he didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply run out we spend way too much much time worrying about the bill about what's going to happen yeah and i know those those of you who are dependent on that and maybe farming or different things you're dependent on the weather you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but elijah didn't have to worry about it because he had it he knew if the supply was would run out god would provide something better you see that's the way god is with our lives and someone told me a wise man told me a long time ago he said no he said don't ever give up what you have for something less he said but for something better god always provides something better he said but but if it's something where you have to give it up for something that seems less it'll be better because god will provide a way oh and i've seen that happen in my life and some of you can say maybe you used to have a home that was different and you moved into a home that seemed like less but it was better god had a better place provided for you you had a job there was a certain way and you thought well if i lose that job what do i do but all of a sudden you found a place where you could you could go to church you can do the things that god will provide away if we'll trust him and it'll be something better it won't be something worse and when i say worse i don't need so much although i believe god cares about our finances and things but it'll be something where we can serve him where we have the capacity to serve him in whatever way that we are now brother ram says he didn't have to wander the supply right now god said i've commanded the ravens i'd like to have heard that conversation too because we think about commanding the ravens as being god spoke to the ravens and how what language did he speak how did how did he do that where they could understand him and he commanded the ravens but see it's more than that god commands listen we'll get more into this later god commands by the details of our lives and we talked about it last week how the jacob come up a certain way and god commanded jacob's life not to make jacob a good person but to bring him to a place of repentance and so he had to go through all of these problems in his life he had to come the way that he did with the personality that he had and the character and everything else because god had commanded him to be a prince and jacob didn't even know it and god commanded the ravens how did he do it we don't know we don't know exactly how he did it they may have just somehow something in their instinct just caused them to do that at a certain time maybe it's the only time in history they ever did it but they did it then why did they do it then god commanded it god's big enough to command for you a job god speaking that to command for your place god's big enough to command for you a family and the things that you have meet up that's right so brother benefit he said what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place in christ amen [Music] but first kings 17 7 tells us that after a while the brook dried up because there had been no rain and so to elijah it must have felt like the revival was over the revival ended but there's a purpose whenever the brook dries up there's a purpose that god has he wants you to move right and i don't mean move from one place to the other though that may be part of it but he wants you to move he wants to make you unsettled like the eagle that takes their little eaglets and pulls out the little things that uh the feathers and the things she's put in there in the rabbit for to make them an unsettled enough where they'll be able to walk around and want to get out of the nest see where they'll be able to fly and so he makes them unsettled and many times god does that for us he he pulls out those things he dries up the spring so that we can be unsettled so elijah would begin praying and looking lord what do you want me to do next i've seen god do that in my life when one thing drives up and you begin to look around and say go well what's next what what should i be doing and then god shows you that open door now as i said god didn't end it without replacing it because elijah was fine there by himself but he couldn't be a help to the widow right he was fine out in the wilderness he was doing good but it wasn't no help to the widow [Music] but the winner was suffered for a while not realizing that god had commanded her life that she would become the sustainer of elijah and his message she would become the one that kept him alive amen by her word and by the word that you believe now so in first king 17 8 says the word of the lord came unto him saying this is after the brook dried up the word of the lord came unto him and said arise get thee to zero path which belongs to the sidon dwell there there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee she said she's praying all night long she'd been praying and she cried out to thought she doesn't know what's coming but while she's still praying god has already spoke to elijah and said i want you there's a widow and i commanded her and he didn't come and speak to her she didn't know but how did he command her by causing the circumstances of her life to be such right to put her in a certain place i hope you're hearing me this morning so that the circumstances of her life would cause her to be at a certain gate maybe before someone else would have gathered the sticks maybe in the good times she wouldn't have had to been out there by herself with her son at home maybe she wouldn't have had to have done that but god commanded it so that she would have to be working that day she would have to be out there gathering the sticks but maybe it wasn't the proper thing for her to be doing but she was out there anyway god commanded her life so that she would be at the right place at the right time to hear the word of god and so her life would be in the right position where she would have nothing left to lose and she would receive the word of god yes amen how many times have we been in that same situation ourselves where our life finally got in that position where we had nothing left to lose say god i'm depending on you i can't do this on my own i can remember early in my preaching ministry praying for a man who i baptized and just recently started coming to church and i was praying for him with his mother he was probably in his 40s but he was his mama's baby and i was praying for him there was planes at the hospital and i and i remember being so frustrated because i thought lord if your prophet was here then he would come off of that ventilator and the things that they had him on and he died not long after that but i've realized since then that it's not up to me it's god it was time and you look back at that and think god allowed him to come to church and be baptized and become a christian so he can take him home and you begin to realize that god commands our lives for certain seasons and certain times and it makes you so desperate that you're willing to give your life to god that this woman you can go back and listen to elijah in the meal offering or be certain of god you'll find bill random talking about how the woman had been praying and confessing her sins she was making sure she had met all of god's requirements and the bible tells us that if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins but if we're unwilling to let go of all of that i'm going to surrender all of that then there's no promise of forgiveness until we were willing to confess now she had met god's requirements and she knew it you can be right with god we live in a world where the church wants to make it where you just you know you always have to live in a place where well god forgives you god forgives you but you can live right with god and yes you will make mistakes but you'll make it right you'll be quick to repent you don't have to live in despair you don't have to live in sin you don't have to live under addiction yeah there's nothing that says we have to live there but our god is able to deliver us from those things he's able to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we confess our sins this little woman had met god's requirements that she knew it i think the old song says do you know how it feels to know when you lay your head on your pillow at night that everything's done that is you're forgiven amen i i know how that feels i don't always feel that way but i know how it feels i've been there and i can go back there are you with me now if i mess up if i do something i know what it's like to have prayed all the way through i know what it's like to know that my students are forgiven i know what it's like to know that god has come down and clears me and touched me and filled me with the holy spirit and so i can always go back there it's still there he said he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me if i mess up i know how it feels to have met god's requirements listen god during this time was silent brother brother said this little woman knew that she had met all those requirements and still god was silent seemed like he didn't even care for her he didn't care whether she lived or died all the time god was working don't take god's silence as being that god is not working god is so great that he can move silently we're going to talk about that loaded wagon that can move without making a noise we make noise and i believe we shouldn't make noise but it's because we've only got so much we can do a baby is helpless so it makes noise to try to get out of the situation that's it here let you know something's wrong many times we make noise to god because we make a situation we're in a situation we can't control and so we make noise or maybe there's such a blessing on us that we can't control we we shout whatever that it is that's wonderful but god is so great he don't he can move for you and not even have to make any noise but just a still small voice she didn't know that all the time god was working she didn't know about it but god told elijah he dried up the brook reached out his hand and stopped the brook from running elijah said lord why did he stop he said i've commanded a widow woman to feed you he had already commanded her but she didn't know it listen to this that's it [Music] just [Music] they had a rough day yesterday with the chromovirus and as i was texting back and forth with him i'd come across this while i was studying i sent it to him he said this he's because i told him i said tomorrow is going to be a better day you may not realize it but tomorrow's going to be a better day and i've been through that i know what that feels like that you feel like it's just hopeless and the next day you wake up and it's all gone and and then tomorrow is a better day and so brother brandon says this he said he might have commanded of you a testimony of your healing you might not know it but just hang on he said when you are sure that you met all the requirements when you know that you've done everything that you know to do and laid yourself before god you've been there you've done everything that you know to do you've laid yourself before god there's only one thing to do is hang on to his promise are you hearing me today church when you've done everything you know to do and it's not about knowledge it's not about how much you know but when you've done everything you do know when you come under god's requirement say lord i've done everything i never do help me lord hang on be certain of god hang on because he said stay there he said god promised to answer said he'll do it he said you don't know what he's commanded you don't know what he's commanded what angel or what to do you may find yourself in a in a hard situation in your life god commanded a church service for you [Music] and somebody to say the right thing for you to receive your healing from your situation god may have commanded somebody at your work to already give you a raise and you don't know it he may have commanded i remember one time i was needing a new job and my job wasn't paying very well and then the boss was a little prickly and i was needing a new job and i was looking kind of for a job but not not real hard and i never had to look long god always provided for me but i don't have any education i wasn't i had never graduated high school never graduated college i was able to read and kind of enjoy work for an attorney and and for a while i worked for a company that wasn't very good and i remember thinking you'll provide you said you would provide i'm not doing very well but you said you would provide it and you know how your email there's some emails that go to your email and there's some go to your spam folder and i went one day and i'm going to delete that and and i clicked over there and i just began to read it was a job offer in my spam folder that had been there for weeks that would double my pay god had already commanded someone to step up and for my need to be met and i just didn't know it yet sometimes i think we just need to start looking through for god to fulfill his word looking through our spam folders and you can put it like that begin to look to the places that are unexpected look at places where you just expect to find trash and then you see god working a miracle for you looking in the unexpected places and that's the way god promised to answer this woman he said he'll do it you don't know what he's commanded what angel or what to do he said it made me this night before the healing service first they were having a healing service the next night he said god might have seen your condition today he might have heard your prayers you don't know what god has commanded for tomorrow hold on don't give up don't give up on that person don't give up on that church don't give up on those people you don't you see everything in the woman's life up to this time was preparing her for one thing [Music] you say well i knew that i already did yes you did i did too but just think about it run that through your brain right think about it what god has done to bring you in your whole life maybe you've had trouble and you've had struggles and everything else and he brought you to a gate brought you to a certain place maybe how cause you'd be born in a certain family and here you're you're out there gathering sticks all you know is christ and him crucified but that's enough amen you realize that jesus died for your sins you're out there gathering those two sticks across he's leaning on the gate can you bring me a drink of water she didn't know why her life had been so difficult something about her life caused her friend to cry out for a supernatural god there's something about the christian i know already that i've been you know you go through things and sometimes we get and we've been working on fixing up things around the church and trying to fix up everything that we can and as we're working on all these things sometimes you get you know to a point where you feel like well we're doing all this but but really lord what we need is a supernatural god amen we're doing all these things we want to make sure that it's right we want our church to be as beautiful as it can be we want we want everybody to be in their place and the services to run just as smoothly as we can but more than anything all right we need a supernatural god amen we just got to step in and do it in the way that he does it and it don't have to be something big but it can just be in this simple way to step in with addiction to our midst and begin to take care of the situations of our lives begin to make healing where we can't make it begin to make us prosper where we can't make ourselves prosper begin to make us come to a place where we have that communion with him she didn't know why her life had been so difficult but she was about to find out you see god had already commanded elijah and she didn't realize she was commanded to i like [Music] she could have read this just right to herself couldn't she oh she had that word to [Music] you were the one that was crying out for your children you were the one praying all emphasis on the elijah but elijah put the emphasis on you he did elijah put them says go go help me a bride abraham's servant we don't even we're not even told his name in that place we know he was eliezer from another place but in that place we don't even even know his name but he said go hunt me and ride yeah what was it the impsis was on the right behold i will send you the light to the prophet yes amen before the coming of the great and gentle day of the lord he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers that's our day lest with the curse all of our life has been in preparation to hear that voice woman bring me a drink amen and that was the woman at the well you just forgive me i just feel the presence of the lord so real this morning to you here's the woman at the well and all her life it's been trouble she's had five husbands and the ones she's living with that's not her without hers she goes to the well at the off time of day because nobody wants to be around her and she gets to the wild not realizing all of her life it's been preparation to hear that voice woman bring me a drink what was it it wasn't elijah was christ and elijah speaking to a tie for the gentile bride bring me a drink amen and from that time on we become a servant to god under the message of the hour and that's our focus that's what we purpose for that is our life my life i want my children to understand that sometimes we get away from this that our our purpose of being here we are so limited he doesn't call everybody to be where we are and so our purpose of being here is to spread this message to to make sure that this message is not my message but the message that comes from god and come through elijah and comes over the pulpit here but that same message that message that we have is so dear to us that's our life that's what we're trying to do is spread it we want to get it out that's our life see what was she doing she hadn't sustained and god has called you to do that in some way and it may be just paying your tithes it may be just going to church and maybe just but being a part of the body of christ don't ever forget that you're not sustaining a preacher you're not sustaining a church you're sustaining elijah's message because you're not going to find it preached down at any other church around in most neighborhoods you're not going to find it around here maybe you'll find a little bit more but you're not going to find it in most places where it's preached all over the place for what you're going to find you're going to have to find you have to seek it out but somehow god will get it to that predestinated seed we're responsible to get elijah's message to that predestinated notice all of her life was preparation to receive a message all of his life was a preparation to give a message so you find brother brandon talking about situations like when he was a boy and he says don't ever smoke or drink or to follow your body in any way i've got to work for you to do when you get old older what was god doing protecting the message and i told you last week i wasn't so much deceived because the seed in you will bring you to a place of repentance and for some people that means going into the depths of sin god was protected so that you can realize you're a sinner but god was protecting the message god was protecting the message amen and so now all of his life was a preparation because there was a message coming and brother random says speaks to that message when he's in order once at the end time he said notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message he said see the first paul healing second paul prophesied third paul the opening of the word the mystery is revealed what was it was preparation during these years to bring him to the message what is it he said and he said there's no more there's no more high order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word he said and remember the third poll was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been spilled in the word he said well that's above my head well just hang on hold on elijah's message is coming has come to tell you what how to understand these things and it's not something that's out here that's just where all you it's always out of your reach no mysteries have been revealed all of church history has been a preparation for this hour we believe that listen brother says in the the church in this state has received the token of the baptism of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed the holy ghost is upon the church without us then they cannot race that's why the end time bright can't fall i don't mean the individuals that associate with the bride or even even are in the bride can't fall and be restored even but the bride will not fail their purpose [Music] they will not fall away from the truth of the message of the allies they may not be many in number but they will not fall because the types already been given there was brides that failed but this bride would not fall why because they're depending on us because luther didn't have all but wesley didn't have all of it but there would be a bride who cannot fall amen brother brother says this he said they're depending on us for god promised he would have it and somebody is going to be there then who should i be i should be somebody right look at somebody say i'm somebody you are you're somebody somebody that can hear somebody that's going to be there he said i don't know who it's going to be but somebody is going to receive he it the only one thing i'm responsible is to preach it it's god's business to look out for that predestined to see but he said there is going to be there though what confidence that gives us the stewardess minister said we can know there's going to be there someone's going to be there because they're going to be there he said each one of them one with the other the water heads the blood engine now the token age of the holy ghost he said remember israel come through many things but it was evening time when the token was required not in the morning not on the preparation the fourteen days of the keeping up with the lamb israel knew something was coming so did luther know it so did west you know it so did finnick knocks calvin noah this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they knew there would come a time these days would happen but they didn't leave live to see it but they looked forward to it what was it there's a time of preparation but this is token time so we've been commanded by god ordained to be the beneficiaries of elijah's message that's where he did first kings 17 and 10. so he arose and went to xeropath when he come to the gate of the city behold when a woman was staying how did she happen to be there god commanded god allowed her to run out of wood that morning you think god doesn't know what's going on in your life god allowed her to run out of firewood that morning at a certain time so that she could pick up those sticks and she was gathering his sticks and he called her and said fetch me i pray a little water in a vessel i may drink woman because jesus said bring me a drink and she was going to fetch it i love that it doesn't she doesn't turn around she doesn't stop you know how scarce water was after no rain for three years think about that think of the longest drought you've ever experienced and it's probably nothing like that and see the thing was in israel the rains were seasonal anyway and in that country that part of the world the rains are seasonal so if you miss that window of rain you're not gonna get any more for the rest of the year so you can imagine the hopelessness of that maybe the rain season had just passed because elijah had his brook and they didn't get much rain anyway because of the drought and then all of a sudden the creeks are dry elijah's at her gate she says bring me a drink there's not much water left but there's something about her character she turns to go get it see we underestimate the value of obedience in our lives you want to do something good for your family obey the word you want people to know that you're a christian obey the word and i don't mean obey me i don't mean obey what i say i mean obey this obey the word obedience to the word will entitle you even to the token mother said so here she goes to fetch it and he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in the night of hands so she's walking away this little tired weary woman she said i'll do something nice for this man he seems like a kind man she begins to walk away as she's walking away from the gate she hears that voice again and it's going to call her to make a complete surrender it's going to bring her to a place where she has to make a complete and total surrender bring me a piece of bread a bread required meal bread required oil she said that's the lord thy god living i'm not trying to hold on but i have not a cake i don't have anything all i've got is a handful a meal and a barrel and a little oil and a cruise behold i'm gathering two sticks that i may go ahead and address it for me and my son that we may eat it and die i love elijah's message see elijah's message many times come to us and first we hear it and we think oh i can i can i can do that i can surrender like that and then we go a little farther and he requires a deeper walk and then we begin to begin to wonder can i do it am i going to be able to do it and then we begin to hear the promises of god fear not you're not going to have to do it on your own well she didn't realize that she wasn't going to have to give it on her own but if she would give the last morsel of bread if she would give the last little bit of all the cruise that god would would actually provide for her and it would never fail listen he said the the thus saith the lord god well let's go back verse thirteen elijah said here fear not go and do as i said but make me there have a little cake first go make you again make me a cake first bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son here's the promise for thus said the lord god of israel the burial of meals shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and her house didn't eat many days oh if we could just understand that god says there will be enough to last until the end it'll never give out until the end every day she came in that handful of meals still there that cruciful of oil was still there we don't know how it happened but it was always there why was she willing to do this he said what does this have to do with being worthy why was she willing to do it because she was worthy to receive elijah's message she did it because she was of the same caliber as the prophet now hang with me for a moment but this woman must have been of the caliber of elijah because usually your action shows what you are saying again she had been chosen to entertain god's prophet remember she was a gentile not a jew and the land was burning up but no doubt this little moment being of that caliber notice what caliber was she being of the believer type amen the believer type is those that when they are down to their last spoonful of oil and the last handful of meal we're still going to trust god see god sent you the message because he knew that you were on the believer type and it doesn't mean that you'll never worry that you'll never question but when you do you'll you'll go to the right place because there's an answer there for you a promise there for you and so she was on that same caliber being of the believer type where we see that god would not have called to her if she hadn't been a worthy one yeah amen and we don't know we'll get in just a few minutes and i don't have very much left but in just a few minutes we'll get to where how that she was a woman who'd had sins in the past and we'll get to that but that was not what qualified her or disqualified her she was of the believer type that's what we need believers see if she hadn't been she wouldn't have been a worthy one to entertain god's prophet for he would have never listened sent his prophet to a house that was unworthy you've been blessed to hear the message they are i've been blessed to we've been blessed to be in message churches and places where where we know the things that we know how do we know because he would have never sent his prophet to a house so it's unworthy every time you get thinking well maybe i'm not sure i know there's three types of believer but listen why would you ever believe you're an unbeliever what's the point of that right if you're an unbeliever you just you probably just wouldn't believe right you wouldn't know and if you're a mate believer you don't know the difference see that's why someone's asked me always have i crossed the line if you cross the line you never know if you cross the line you harden that consciousness you don't care if you can right you're here this morning you must care if you care there must be mercy you care enough that you you're willing to just do the little things that the prophet said to do there must be mercy god would have never sent his prophet to a house that was unworthy it was not his choosing it was god's choosing it wasn't her bidding him it was god meaning him he had been placed by a brook the ravens were feeding him but it was god's command for something to take place and god surely went to a believer of the same nature of elijah we got too much of these people looking well brother branham was like this he was he was christ-like but for us you know we can't really be that way nonsense come on well he treated people right but we're different you know nonsense we have the same god he went to a believer the same nature of elijah listen the bible says the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crews of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah that's a great way to put it isn't it the word of the lord would you spank by elijah now he would continue in her house for a while i want you to catch this before he left her house she would see the sign of the resurrection so while he was with her amen she would see the sign it came to password 17 after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in he died she said it to elijah what about to do with theo that man of god you think a believer can't get disgruntled sometimes now she was worthy she was of the believer type and she began to question why she even followed the message what good does it do me my kids can die anyway what did i should do with the about man of god and to slay my son is that what you're doing here is that and see so many of us come to that place in the message where we go through the hard times and we begin to wish maybe not publicly begin to think it'd be so much easier if i was never associated with the message it would have been so much easier if i'd never heard the voice of elijah if i'd have never known what it was to be so different from the world it had been so much easier if i didn't have to do that i didn't have to go to church if i didn't pay my tithes if i didn't live for god if i didn't wear these clothes if i didn't do these things that i knew if i didn't follow the dictates of the word if i wasn't baptized in jesus name there would be it would have been so much easier my family would love me more everything would have been better she said why what have you come to do you just come to make me guilty have you just come to make me feel bad he didn't come to make her feel guilty he didn't come to bring her a book of laws what did he come for she thought well if i'm in the message i won't have these troubles no he came in her trouble in her time of trouble and if he came once that way he could come again that way but see the thing is she used to like this message she believed in it first but now she's gone through an even harder trial where son that was dead she said here you've been in the house the whole time what did you do to stop him from dying all right what good did the message do me are you just come to remind me what a center i am because i know i haven't always lived up to the world she did he did not come to remind her of her sin but to remind her that there was a sacrifice for sin you did not come to bring death you come to bring life after death listen god sent the message out what elijah was god god spoke through elijah to bring life to a dead boy listen lebron said she represents the church today after a life he stayed with her for a little while she had a little boy he got sick his sickness was so bad there was no breath left in him he died then what did she do he said the church had already seen those signs the ones where he'd come in and the the meal didn't fail the oil didn't fail he said but what as soon as a little disaster comes quickly she wants to blame the church for it she wanted to blame elijah she said that man of god now you come here to call my sins to my memory and take the life of my son see she made the message for a trial but the trial the message wasn't a problem it was her solution the trial did not come the message did not come to bring a trial but the trial came to reveal to her the sign of the resurrection he said to her first kings 17 i believe this is it says one that's actually 19. he said here give me my son he took him out of her bosom and she carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own dead he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god and so also brought evil upon the widow with whom i should journey by slaving her son the prophet don't always know what god's going to do here this boy died he said lord why did you do it he was still god's prophet he said have you come to brought bring evil upon the winner with whom i said you're my slave your son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord said oh lord my god i pray that he left this child's soul coming to him again and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and elijah took the child and brought him down the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see i should live here you realize what god's done in the message of the hour do you realize what he's done he's come down and he showed us the sign of the resurrection he said see of god is alive he didn't come and say say behold methodist her baptist face it behold the lord she the son of god is a lot yes see the son of god is walking among you she's still in it he's not here in court performing yet he's coming that way but he's not here that way yet but see he's among you see he's the same yesterday today remember it took elijah to do that just present it to the gentile woman and say see he's alive excuse me for yelling at you this morning god gave her a son [Music] don't think because you went through the hardest trial of your life that god's throwing you away that god's letting you go but you're somehow not worthy but when you've gone through the hardest trial of your life that's when he wants to show i'm still all alive then what do we do what's our job to do we just have to keep the voice from aligned to the message of elijah alive and to do that is more than just and part of it is is having the the tapes in the books or the audio whatever it is that we have but part of it more than that is to have it living in us paul says you were written epistles read of all men he said you don't need me to write a letter of accommodation he said why because the way you live shows people you've heard my message god gave her a sign brother branham says if god raised his son from the dead we have a right to look for the sign of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ he promised it to us and we got a right for it listen jesus told them the wicked an adulterous generation was to receive a sign what kind of sign the sign of the resurrection we have it today after two thousand years remember he said they saw the sign he said but no sign will be given them except the sign of the prophet jonas he was three days in the middle of the well and he was resurrected he said accept that sign he said he is still alive let me back up he said what kind of sign sign of the resurrection we have it today elijah we have it today after 2 000 years he is still alive he is among us tonight the same yesterday today and forever identifying himself by the characteristics of god manifesting the word in this day that he promised to do yes sir it was a sign we saw the sign of the messiah that that woman saw there was someone there new the woman at the well someone that knew what she had done knew her life and we saw the sign of the messiah in william branham's ministry but then in christ as the mystery god revealed brother brown and i challenge you listen to that read it it's so important for us to survive because brother brown begins comparing the bride with the groom yes and he goes to a list of how she's like him it gets down towards the end of it he said he talked about how he stood alone he said that his church stands alone she is not hooked up with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelted and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it he said that's why the devil is housing come on listen think about this in this hour and this time that we live in right now what's going on right now all around us that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up look around you if they're not trying to set up something to close up the preaching of the work but look in all different directions to set up something to closer up they'll never do it [Music] there might be times we might have to stream the service there might be time but they'll never be able to close us up why because i got the word of the prophet they'll never do he said well they'll make the law that we can't do it we just won't be able to have church they still have church in china they still have church in vietnam they still have church in in those countries where where there's a law against it why do they still have church why does the church strive in a situation like that they won't be able to do it they'll never do it and i believe that before that law whatever it is that they that they make that they come up with to close us up before they can put the lock on the doors he said they'll never do it should be taken up not closed up what confidence that ought to give us but look look said she'll be taken up not closed up or read on because we stopped too short she has now risen island [Applause] she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promised to her she is now risen she's not waiting right on another resurrection she has risen there's one coming a change of the body full of adoptions you can say it that way but the inside the soul is ready for the first time the token is on display for the first time in two thousand years that that which was lost to pentecost is back up again she has now risen and the power of the vindicated word promised to her don't sell this message short i'm not ashamed as paul says the power of the gospel of jesus christ it's the power of god a woman turned to elijah and she said now after i've heard the message after the meal and the oil didn't fail after you showed the sign the identification of the resurrection now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word that's what he wanted to get her to believe the word that's what the sign was for get her to believe he was that christ was living the word of the lord and thy mouth is truth let let us be like that today musicians come up closing let us be like that let me be like this worthy gentile widow i know this message is the truth it does not come to remind me of my past it's not come just to beat me down it's come to set me free i know that it's true and more than that i know it's more than just head knowledge it's more than just knowing the scripture inside and out but i know not only is it true but it's truth in my life it's become true in my life in my life i see the signs of the resurrection in my life i know because he lives i can face tomorrow in my life i know that it's worked for my family it's worked for my church it works every time it's true the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony works there's a problem with the word of the testimony not the blood of the lamb it works the token works the message works every time it's tried you want to see as the as the man of the welsh revival said you want to see the revival he said i'm it you want to see if the message works it's right works right here it works in this place it has to work here before it can work in my life anywhere else it's gonna work right here in the space that i occupy in these three dimensions it has to work it's got to be more than esoteric nonsense of just just jumble jumbled words and big words and things that some philosopher would understand tell me more that a philosophy is going to work it's got to be more than emotion it's got to work it has to manifest in your life we believe he's done that today thank god for the message of the hour let's power our heads together if you've not come to that place where you've just fully surrendered to god we know you've met god's requirements if you have hold on to that hold on to that if you've not come to that place this morning would you do that today you just do that while the presence of the lord is here he's all around you today you don't know that he didn't command an angel to come by today sit right by you on your seat just begin to talk to you and begin to tell you i'm here i'm alive i want to show you my resurrection i want to take the dead things in your life like that rod of aaron i want to make them live i want to raise you up don't be content with hiding sin in your life don't be content with deadness and with coldness don't be content with ungodliness for your life let it go let let go but let god begin to move in your life he's here for you this morning if you're just accepted by faith where you are today just like that with a woman heard elijah and she began to do the things that elijah said would you just do that today you've heard the message of the hour would you just come to it and just begin to believe there's healing for you there's salvation for you there's there's joy for us every one of us have to come back that's why we keep having these services we want to come in the presence of god and say god wash me by the water of your word let me be clean again let me know what it feels like for everything to be gone let me stand in the grace of god i may make mistakes i do make mistakes but i know your grace is sufficient for me amen heavenly father lord as we approach you in this way lord if there's one here that's never given their life to you know that the word works in their life for their families may they recognize the lord not just by what i've said but by the way we live by the way we love others by the way we treat people i pray it will be manifested in our lives lord we never look at someone as a stranger but lord look at them as a child of the son or daughter of god do we not grow hard and dinner lord may we get softened up under your presence pray lord i know you can bring healing in every area of our lives we've heard the voice of elijah in our day not my voice i had nothing to do with the message coming i'm just here to be a proclaimer of the message that has come i'm one of those one of those would have said i said you elijah oh god that was me i needed to hear elijah if no one else believes it i still believe god but your message works i know that it does give us courage lord to believe and to know that your word is the same yesterday today and forever granted father we pray jesus name heal every sick person we pray this morning thank you for all that you do amen let's stand together [Music] this morning you believe he's here let's worship him for a moment now we've heard
