verse amen um we're we know you're a little on the tired side this morning but I I tell you what if you just pull on the on the word of the Lord and and I'll I'll preach fast you pull fast amen well then we might be in here for a couple hours amen but uh we'll give it a try we'll give it a try praise the Lord there's psalms 27 and 4 One Thing have I desired of the Lord somebody say one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble somebody say in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock I would like to also uh read uh there in second or first Corinthians 7 and 35 just one verse amen praise the Lord it says this I speak for your own prophet not that I may cast a snare upon you but that which is coming that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction amen that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love and your blessings thank you Lord for this wonderful group of people and Lord we are thankful to you for the the anointing that has come during these meetings and Lord how you have blessed us and you've sent your servants brother Daryl and brother Andrew and how our hearts have been so uplifted Lord and God as we stand here behind this sacred desk this morning I'm asking the Lord that you would anoint me that you would give me the words that you would want me to say that you would bless this congregation Lord bless brother Ben and all of the laborers Lord who have made this meeting so wonderful father we thank you for your love now help us today in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be sick amen I'd like to uh just Minister for a little bit this morning placing value upon this Rapture now brother uh Andrew preached such a wonderful message last night on the rapture and I wanted to come in this morning and maybe Iman uh really uh emphasize the value that this Rapture is now not that I could make the value the message any more valuable not that brother Andrew or your pastor could make this message any more valuable amen the value is already within this message the value is there amen but it is US placing the value upon this message can you say man uh Philippians 3 and 12 this is not as though I'd already attained amen uh either we're already perfect but I follow after that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ amen and he's talking about pressing toward the prize for the mark of Christ Jesus can you say amen amen there in the uh it in the same verses here in the Young's literal translation it says not that I did already attain or have been able uh already been made perfect but I pursue if also I may lay hold on that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus I do not reckon myself to have laid hold one thing the things behind me indeed forgetting to the things before me stretching forth to the Mark I pursue or chase for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus can you say amen amen so in order to have amen uh in order to reach the goal there's got to be a value of the go man there's got to be a value you're not going to run for the prize unless the prize is worthy to you amen can you say Amen growing up one of the amen and most important thing that any of us to learn was the was the ability to place value on things amen now when you were a kid you were willing a man to give up your ten dollar bill for uh amen for one dollar bills amen because you didn't have the value and you couldn't see the value all you could see was one versus four but you see the one was a ten dollar bill well praise the Lord amen and so what we are doing what we have got to understand is there is a value there is a rapture oh man you and you're a kid you'll drop your you know you'll you'll Park your bike behind the you know the a vehicle and they mine and your uh uh uh things don't matter much to you because the value isn't quite there yet but once you begin to get out and work for your money and you have to buy that bicycle and then you understand the value of things amen can you say man and I I want to say the value of something is to know how to estimate the worth of something amen the relative importance of something there are specialists in certain fields that amen they're trained experts they know what they're looking at they know what they are looking for and they can quickly identify what is fake and what is real amen they can identify what is of worth and what is not of worth can you say man and it took a specialist in this last day to come in this hour to identify what was worthy and what was not worth it can you say man amen that's exactly right I I remember reading a story when I was a kid of a man that had a had an ugly Rock field and amen he he had this old field he farmed for a long time they're in Africa and a mountain but there there was a uh you know a thing going around diamonds had been discovered and he become so intrigued with these diamonds on the on the other other side of the world and a mountain and and and this is a true story he sold his farm he left his family to the uh amen the charge of his neighbors and he went out to go find his wealth amen and he he wandered all over the African continent searching looking for diamonds every every time he got there he was just constantly looking amen but this man ended up being a a very poor man amen Old Man Poor Man and in all of his search he died without finding diamonds so one day as he uh amen that the guy that that had bought his his uh old rock Farm amen he he you know he was plicking these these old rocks out of the ground and and uh uh and bringing him in and you know used him as uh you know you're stacking them in you know big old piles just trying to get rid of him so he can Farm the ground and and and he had a real pretty rock that he put on top of his mantle there and somebody had come to visit him one day and and he and he's seen the Rock and and the guy happened to know what that rock was and he looked at it and he says now uh I think this rock right here could be a diamond and the guy looks at him and says Ah no that's just an old rock I got a bunch of these rocks they man they're I I don't going to those rocks are just in the way everywhere Hallelujah he says can I take this rock with me and he takes the Rock and he has it and he has it examined amen and before you know it that old rock field ended up being the biggest diamond mine in all of the world well praise the Lord amen this guy saw his own ugly Rock Farm while go he was setting on that well glory to God there's some of you young people that's looking out in the world you can look out there what they can give you can look out there what they have to offer and you go out there looking for happiness and you've got it right here in the church I say we need to understand what with God we need to understand the value of what we've got [Applause] hallelu will praise the Lord amen yes sir you've got to know or what you've got and Jesus as a man who knows what he's got it and he finds this pearl of great price he will sell everything else he has to buy that pearl of great price praise the lord we talk about that third pull amen will use it as a cliche we begin to use it as a amen as you know just another belief but I want to tell you that is your ticket to the Rapture that is your ticket to an overcoming power is God's gift to you you need to take that thing off of the shelf and put it to work in your life amen can you say Amen reminds me of another story of a coin collector oh George Walton he's pretty famous now he man but George walking a Walton Way he loved collecting rare coins and he wasn't really a knowledgeable Professional Coin collector but but he enjoyed he prized himself in in collecting coins and and so uh a mountain he was killed in a car wreck back in 1962 and his family received his his collection of of coins and and so they're you know looking through the coins and and what he had they they they they found that that he had what they called a liberty coin it was a it was a Liberty Head nickel a man and so these Liberty Head nickels they were they were made from an 1883 to 1912. amen and so and then it was replaced by the buffalo nickel and and so they they they looked for this and amen they're uh you know they weren't supposed to be made anymore the Liberty coins but uh you know they they there was this guy that uh uh a matter of fact the the dies were supposed to be destroyed and and things but uh uh five years later amen a U.S mint employee he he found some old dice and and he may he may five of these Liberty coins amen they were double-headed it was a double-headed Liberty coin now it was shady and a mountain so now these coins were in circulation around and it had it it was it was amen it had the stamp of approval by the governor and yet the government did not approve of it and so the mint Department said no it never happened amen and and But Here There were some coins that were out there uh in circulation and so uh amount after a while amen and Walton had one of these in his collection now Walton we went and looked around and he he he took it to somebody you know and had him to you know to uh to see what it was worth and the guy said it's worthless you know there's nothing to it and so uh uh uh so Walton just put it back in his in his collection and that collection he had that little liberty headed nickel uh a double-headed nickel there for for 40 years sitting in his closet sitting in his closet Hallelujah uh you know the the the the the professional said it's not worth anything and so amen but these when the family received this they begin to check Hallelujah the hands of the right fella and he looked at this thing and he says listen there's only five of these coins made the U.S government claims it's not there but it's here Hallelujah four have been found and you've got the fifth one they said well how much is this thing worth Hallelujah they sold that coin for three million over three million dollars now now this this guy because there was some bonehead that didn't know how to value that coin he threw that thing in the closet as if well it's just a good luck charm it's just well praise the Lord but it was valuable now I want to tell you the world might not understand it the world might not want it the world might say it's not much of anything but the Bride of Jesus Christ has had a profit specialist in this day and this Prophet has said this Rapture is of value it's a value we need to put our attention upon that value can you say amen amen yes what is the value of this Rapture to you now I I'm just going to preach real simple to you here for a few moments amen because Heavenly places that was the uh was the place that God is ordained the believer Adam walked in Heavenly places Adam walked with that relationship with God Adam is imperfection Adam amen and upon this God a a call for every one of us to come back to that place can you say amen amen the scripture says therein in in Ephesians 1 and 9. it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him this is the time that God is wanting to bring the heavens and the Earth back together under their leadership and the rulership of man once again now if we don't place value on that we'll put value on our jobs we'll put value on sports we'll place value on things that really have no value but God is telling the elect listen I've come in this generation to restore you back [Applause] amen restore you back to where you once were can you say Amen Adam and Eve knew what it was like Jesus knew what it was to walk here in this flesh but also knew what it was to govern from the heavens amen Adam knew how what it was like to live in this body and to govern from the heavens and the Bride of Jesus Christ has been given a third pull the word of God to embrace into your soul and to produce that Rapture faith Hallelujah it's no wonder One Thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after there's one thing that I'm I've desired there's one there's one thing that I've desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may come back did you know that that was the that was the same scripture that brother Branham used in The Rapture message one thing have I desired of the Lord and that one thing will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple can you say Amen that word desire is a strong feeling of wanting something to long for it's a strong craving it's to aspire to it's to hunger for well can you say man I am reaching for that Mark I am pressing for that prize there's one thing in my and I must get to that goal is good amen Amen to pursue is it's like a hot burning coal placed in your soul there's a there's a passion that comes with it but praise the Lord when you you boys amen you met you met your girlfriend Hallelujah and all of a sudden family didn't mean anything to you and amen the job didn't mean too much to you and nothing else because there was something that was burning well praise the Lord something burning in your soul there was something in you you just couldn't get your mind off of that pretty thing that you meant and and then whenever amen he slips a ring on your finger that girl becomes worthless too hallelujah amen her family just they can't get her off the phone for nothing I mean she just seen the the ugly guy five minutes ago and she's already texting and she's all what is it amen what there is something that is that I desire that has been kindled there has been a passion that has been kindled are y'all understanding me amen there's one thing that I have desire of the Lord I want to be with him I want to experience him I must climb into his house can you say amen amen I'm putting value on this I mean nothing to me anymore I have my soul love I love to be in his presence when you long to be in his presence there's nothing else that matters well hallelujah amen we have some talented musicians back home Iman and and you know they they like to skip around and you know they they they'll learn to play the guitar but then they'll play the you know the bass and they'll learn to play the piano and the drums and but I always tell them if you're going to get good at something you have got to have your first love you can't divide your love between four different instruments you have got to put your desire you have got to put your affections upon the thing that you love oh come on church amen and when you put your desire and your affection upon the thing you're no longer a jack of all trades and a master of none now you are honing in you are Desiring you're putting your desires on one scene well praise the Lord I have one um that is to come into your presence can you say man amen Psalm 63 and 8 says my soul follows hard after thee and thy right hand a part of me somebody say my soul follows hard after thee a determination amen what we need today is a determination God let this word live in me Lord let your word live in me Lord let there be desire like there's never been desire amen there wouldn't be so many problems in marriages if there was a passion that was kept alive between husband and wife well glory to God someone says I've been married for 40 years and so you know the passion isn't there the way it used to be well it should be and you should be able to have I'm here to tell you her kiss can still have a bang if you'll elect come on now amen hallelujah I think passion should be a part of our lives reason why you're falling for other girls and the reason why you're looking at other women and the reason why amen you're comparing your husband with another man because you have lost your passion you have lost your desire you have lost your craving you have lost the value that he once had but you ever get that value back that your desire will be his desire your desire will be his love oh can you say man I say we got to get rid of everything else and get the desire back get the passion back get everything that he once was back to us I don't know we don't need a lot of marriage counseling what we need to do is fall in love again what we need well come on Church we need somebody to stand up and teach us some more stuff what we need is the value what we've got good praise the Lord see I tend to believe that what you and the world thinks is love is really an infatuation and there's nothing wrong with infatuation if you weren't infatuated with her well you'd have probably never got married but they say that the honeymoon well glory to God the honeymoon will last for about six to nine months maybe a year but when it hits that year and a half Hallelujah you get up and you used to seeing her she's looked she's used to looking at you she knows all about you knows all about your well praise the Lord and what she used to think was funny is no longer funny and what she used to think was cute or now stinking feet now we're looking at things a little bit differently it was not that was not the part of love that was an infatuation that that is that that is a little sense of feeling love is not an emotion love is an act of your will can you say man but you can keep the fire burning you can keep the feeling burning and the way you do that amen is is keep falling in love amen what you've got to do is is to send her some flowers amen what you've got to do is to put these things in motion and before you know it you are keeping your passion alive what we need in the church today is more passion what we need in the service this morning is my passion what we need in our homes is more passion for the things of God you see when you become passionate about the things of God that's all you think about when you're passionate about the things of God that's all you desire when your power come on church when you're passionate all you want is his presence well thank you thank you when you come into the church services yeah you're married but Mary just ain't enough you want to let him know you want to let him know that he's still got it you want well praise the Lord you want to let him know that he's still your hunk amen hallelujah I believe God's been wanting to let that and you let you know that amen God didn't just send a prophet he sent him seven times around the world Amen God didn't just come amen and just did declare but he showed himself service after service after service what was it it was God showing himself off [Music] it was God declaring himself real it was God bragging to his little girl can you see man brother Branham says now Shirley Jehovah has a man that he could put his hands upon who will not compromise with them ungodly organizations who will swing the people back to the Rock Christ Jesus back to the original Pentecost the original Holy Ghost the original signs the original wonders surely he's got someone somewhere who will not break down under any kind of persecution and run out and get canceled out fall out or anything else but they will stay with it can you say Amen surely there's somebody that is so in love with him can you say man hallelujah amen I believe it was I believe it was Caleb there there is as they were going into the will of going into the promised land and that when they got to the land the people should have been so excited about what God had had done for them to bring him into the promise And yet when they got there Hallelujah they were all they were all cowardly and they were all wanting to go back to Egypt and amen they were all wanted can you say man but it was Caleb the Bible says amen that Caleb had a different heart he had a different mind can you say man he says my servant Caleb because he had a different spirit with him amen and have followed me fully I will bring him into that land amen you see you see the desire you see when you've got to desire when you stake the word of God and you say this is mine but if you don't want it praise the Lord yeah if we don't want him no no now you're saying that brother window but no sir we've had a good meeting now here now you're saying we don't want it received the passion that desire I want this third pool in my life more than ever before can you say man Hallelujah young man comes up to a to a successful man and the success he comes up and says I want to be successful like you he said oh yeah he goes yeah he said man you've got all this money and you've run these businesses and I hey man he's the guy says all right I'll teach you how to be

waist deep and then goes on he said come on down so he finally gets out there to where amen all the way up to his shoulders and then and then the successful man grabs the guy by the head and just puts his head under the water and keeps it under the water and I mean he is he's doing everything he can to get up and finally let's see my penny he's he's about drowning he's coughing and amen and and the successful guy says what were you thinking under there is it all I wanted was a breath that's right that's right he says when you want success like you wanted that breath you will be successful when you want this Rapture like nothing else can you say Amen when you want this like God wants you to have it well come on Church you're not going to be in lunch a lot about it you're going to start pushing that amen play button because you want to you're going to start coming in prayer because you want to you're going to start calling out to God because you want to why it's down deep in your soul you have placed value can you say amen yeah brother Branham once said this he says now to achieve anything you've got to set a goal and say this I believe and tie yourself to it and then keep drawing and moving up closer to it knowing that it's there knowing that there is something there that you're coming to that it's your time to start shouting [Applause] has come to wake me up The bridegroom's Voice well the the the the the the the the cry saying the bridegroom comes now it was it was it was spoke out there for the foolish for the wise everyone heard it but only the wise make preparations and was ready well praise the Lord how many wants to place value upon this and you gotta place value on it now yeah Hallelujah I heard the preacher talking last night and and said we need to we need to start playing placing value to coming back to church again [Applause] yeah Hallelujah now now they're having problems out there in the religious world they're trying to figure out I mean they're trying to figure out how to get the people back in the church building since the coronavirus they mean they're they're having they're having a hard time but the bride has got value they ain't got and listen there ain't enough programs so they're trying to add to the more of the programs they're trying to get to be better uh uh entertainment they're trying to do their best to make it easier for them to come they're trying to make it like an amusement part-time deal anything to get the people into the church amen they ain't got what we got they ain't got the Pearl a great prize they ain't got the Nuggets to Rapture they haven't heard the voice they haven't heard that or shout can you say Amen but the bride has heard the shout their pride has taken the word the bride is in Rapture the bride knows he is coming the bride knows that she matters [Applause] you're the reason for the profit to come with a shot message can you say Amen praise the Lord well it don't matter we're not legalistic brother Wendell well you better start getting legalistic when it comes to coming to church because the Bible said for Satan not and that ain't a new Devil it was a new it was a devil back then too forsake not the sake uh The Sibling of yourselves together even as some are this is back in Paul's day the more as you see that day approaching say you're placing more value on your attitude than you are the word you're placing more value on what you think that ain't marriage material marriage material is to be in love with him not yourself thing for you young people hey man if you're in love with yourself don't think about marriage Hallelujah you gotta well praise the Lord because you're going to have to empty yourself you're going to you're just going to have to suck up your feelings sometimes well glory to God Amen all right I'm here to tell you my my wife is the most beautiful thing around and I love her a lot but sometimes I just have to I just have to shut up where is my wife amen I haven't seen I'm looking for my wife are you in the back oh my word oh she got a baby back Hallelujah she said he's preaching and I'm going to the back she's my number one amenor usually amen Hallelujah but you see you you see there you that it's not it's it's it's it's not what I think it's what he thinks he said well it's got to be reciprocated did not he leave the Throne of Glory as we heard yesterday morning yeah y'all hear that mess that missile he done this far he is woman but praise the Lord amen and because he loves me I can now love him because he chose me well praise the Lord if he didn't do the chosen choosing then you you wouldn't be the girl can you say Amen but he chose his girl and you said I do yes the desire now now I believe the Apostle Paul looked there to the galatian church and he says how is it that you've begun and now here you are you begun in the spirit and now here you are you got to come back to that passion can you say man come back to that passion come back sometimes we need a renew him and we've got a wonderful little group right here and and and how I love brother Ben brother Ben is just the finest of of of pastors the finest of of of Christians and preachers and and we appreciate wonderful men we appreciate the team but sometimes we all need a renewing what can you say man sometimes we need that renewing renew that passion again I it you know they they the the the early church was filled with the Holy Ghost in Acts 2 but by the time they got to acts 4 they were needing a refilling again and they were asking for the Lord to reveal him but praise the Lord I believe it was the shoot of my woman who had received the promise of God and she had her baby and amen but when but one day the baby died and when the baby died amen she could have just sit there amen and holding the 12 year old boy and say ah hey man my promise is dead but she didn't do that she didn't do that she said that was God's gift to me that was God's word to me can you say man what did she do she laid the baby on the prophet's back went and got her servants and said saddle up a donkey and take me to the man of God she says don't you look to the left don't you look to the right don't you look around until we get to the man of God he gave me that promise and he's going to restore that promise this is for me she had the right value are you hearing me she valued what that Prophet gave her well praise the Lord she gets up to the Prophet The Prophet says it's not well with your husband yep oh we're with you yeah oh well your boy yeah all is well Hallelujah and then all of a sudden she makes a she makes a dive for his feet and she's hanging on he says if all is well what's going on he says you are following me back we'll praise the Lord you remember the promise you gave me well let's lay him dead you remember the pro I didn't want the promise you came to me you asked me I said I am fine but you said that I amen that you were going to give me this promise oh come on Church you didn't desire this you didn't have any any hope with that but God came to you and that desire should be in your heart saying I don't care where I'm at I don't care how Fallen I feel I don't care how how you know how where I'm at my baby me that promise if we would start taking the words of God like that to our heart and say God you gave me this promise I can't do it I can't fulfill it you gave that promise and I'm looking to you to fulfill it says amen now he says well servant I want you to go down there and but her faith wasn't in the servant her faith was in the prophet in the words of God and the word brought that restoration are you hearing me because somebody placed value upon it I want you to look here I want you to really understand that this restoration that God has brought to us it's it's it's something that God has been longing to do that he's had in his plan he's had this for eons of time this stage is what God has been looking for now I think that goal is everything it's got to be everything to us I I want us to to think about how many's ever seen a you go into a maze how many has ever been in a corn maze or Maze and amen it's got all these paths and you're trying to find your way out and you're do you know the prophet of God says that religion has become a lot like one of those maze they're in the church age book he says in short Christendom has become a labyrinth or a maze he's in the faith has been split into a thousand little parts anything to get your mind our glory to God and Satan will come in and he'll bring any kind of thing he'll bring trouble into the church he'll bring trouble into the before you know you got your eyes on everything and everything and everything and everything and everything and we miss what God's doing right now oh come on yeah and when you get your mind on this and you get your mind on that and you get your mind on this and you get your mind on that you're missing the beauty of the power that God's placed within you with this third pool Ministry and so I think what we've got to do is say Lord get me out of this maze that I'm in and put me back on the straight and narrow so that I can start believing your word for exactly what it is his word is the truth yeah and he will keep his word well praise the Lord brother Branham says be simple he said just ask don't try to figure it out don't try to study it just believe it don't mentally figure it out just believe it with your soul another place he says the first conflict that ever come into the world was because that somebody was seeking after world league wisdom in the stead of a simple faith in God he says listen to this you say Dr so and so doesn't believe it that doesn't change God's word a bit remember you're not saved by wisdom you are not saved by your education you are saved by faith in Jesus Christ forget about your education and be simple in your own Doctrine so our Doctrine should always be I'm not looking to that I'm not looking to that I am looking to God's word I am in a Rapture God is calling me out of this church Bible comes we're looking upward family problems come we're looking upward amen trouble on the job we're looking upward our our our Attention our passion is not divided our passion is upon that word and upon that word alone Christianity is really basic it's very simple there's only one way and that's Jesus Christ there's only one formula to be born again and that's water blood and spirit there's only one formula for baptism and that's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's only one way to be a disciple and that is to deny yourself pick up your cross and follow him [Applause] can you say Amen amen any other way it just does not work and there's only one way for the perfecting of the church and that is for the word of God to be preached by a cyclone Ministry [Music] there that keeps us on that straight and narrow give me a passion yeah for your word again [Applause] [Music] become my passion yeah well praise the Lord there's only one requirement for anything brother Branham would say it says mister you sitting here in this wheelchair and you on the cot you hear from back you on to wherever you are if you're born of the spirit of God you've got just as much right to rise from that chair and wheelchair tonight as any other man has you're born again get a little grit about you stand up and Jesus Christ stand here in his word proving what he is signs wonders Miracles and of his resurrection what more do we want God give me some Grit is that right yeah Hallelujah now we're in National distress amen National distress everywhere it's it's just it's crazy they meant Financial stress physical stress emotional stress transgender stress all kinds of stress hey you this this world's going crazy can you say Amen but it's ordained to do so they're under the judgment amen they're under the Judgment Revelations 9 has already told us it's coming yeah but the church has one thing and we're growing by everything about us is looking upwards you know what that means we probably shouldn't spend as much time in Fox News we probably shouldn't spend as much time on these all all of these programs and what what is that what what kind of rapturing faith is that going to give you but the shout the shout becomes The Voice and the voice is a people that is living this message living what they have heard in the midst of Satan's Eden you become the word that you have heard and the only way that you are really going to do it is by

whole world despise the entire medical science defies it all what is taken place and runs Spencer's body he's become the word in flesh [Applause] can you say Amen it's living he's taking the shout

[Applause] the living voice the living voice is not amen we want to put it on William Bradham or we want to put it on Jesus Christ but Jesus was that living voice made flesh he was oh you can't you can't you can't put that Living Word in a box you can't put that Living Word even in this right here amen oh we're thankful for what this is and this testifies of that Living Word but the Living Word came along before there was ever a printed page and the Living Word is to the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you it's the greatness of God living in your body it's the glory of all the promises wrapping up in this church sure it's important this is not a Doctrine yeah this is a living reality [Applause] this is where God spoke that shout message was through that Prophet yeah oh what a powerful thing

of God he'd love to refer himself as the son of man man himself just a man he says I'm nothing the son can do nothing without him nothing in himself but it's the father that was in him the manual the

this morning there is nothing worth keeping you out of this rapture Hallelujah the Bible says that we are to walk in humility amen the Holy Spirit rests upon the lamb the lamb nature I want to have a lamb nature can I be a leader and have a lamb nature sure can I be a husband and have a lamb nature sure you be a wife and have a lamb nature sure that's right you can have that lamb nature the whole way they're they're in Ephesians 4 and 2 with all loneliness and that word loneliness is having a humble opinion of oneself and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love and endeavoring that word endeavoring means laboring hastening being diligent to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace brother Branham said if you believe me to be God's servant listen the best thing for you to do around Life Tabernacle and everywhere else is to keep an old-fashioned prayer meeting going and keep the unity of the spirit and keep looking up and watching for the coming of the Lord keep all the worldliness out of you no matter how bad it hurts circumcised by the Holy Ghost will cut away the worldly things can you say Amen so while we're living in an age where it's

the gospel bring a prophet to the world Circle the globe but then she would start speaking like the dragon before she would go into apostasy but you can't go into apostasy with the world all right and as the the further the America gets the world gets away from God the more that they demand them their rights until the Book of Revelation says that even in the tribulation period they they that they still refuse to repent and the Bible says and they refused to repent amen yes sir he says it three different times in the Book of Revelations and yet yet they used to repent yeah because they're so let us be men and women yeah yeah humility yeah come on if I get the bad end of the stick I'm just going to pray the Lord will help that have to have the last word or can I let my wife win occasionally no no she needs to let me win occasionally she usually wins you listen to me Jess amen we we've we demand our rights we want but why can't we just humble ourselves say listen the anointing is here upon me the lamb the anointing that was upon the Lamb of God is upon me as a lamb he's going to Rapture me and take me out oh come on now what the scripture say the meek shall inherit the Earth the meek the meek the meekness is the biggest the ability it's the it's the frame of heart and mind of spirit to accept his dealings with us as good he's worked together for the good to them who are the called according to his purpose knows it's coming that allows those things to come and here I am um God perfect that which concerns me sure give me a passion for this word and never allow that dove to leave me amen if the musicians would come praise the Lord brother Branham says I'm not a politician I want to be a Christian this is not a place for politics the whole thing's going anyways this that we're talking about is eternal democrat or republican oh it's just such a mess it can never be redeemed it's over so don't argue about that the thing is is to live for this Kingdom here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen can you say amen he says now she must rot of course as I have said in order to bring New Birth look look what she's rotted into notice my brethren she's totally rotten her politics her systems is just as rotten as can be there isn't a sound bone inner inner World Systems in our politics and her religious politics whatever else one says I'm a Democrat I'm a republican I'm a Methodist I'm Baptist the whole thing is rotten to the core oh yeah there's got to be something give way yeah she can't stand if you put a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in every County in this United States it still couldn't come back it's beyond Redemption there's only one thing that can help her that's the coming creator she knows she must give way she's in pain and distress one don't know what to do one is looking this way one's looking that way and everything one is scared of the other one trying to do something will destroy this one one trying to contradict the other one to destroy the other until now they got it in the hands of Simple Man who could destroy the whole thing in a five minutes amen she knows she can't stand the people know she can't stand the world knows that they're going it's going to happen God said it was the whole heavens and the Earth is going to give going to be on fire it's going to be a renovation of the whole thing so A Whole New World can be born God has prophesied it can you say man aren't you glad that you've heard of him Rapture message as our brother was preaching last night oh

morning hopefully maybe a little bit of mustard that really makes it good [Music] Lord from the front to the back lord if there's anything that's hidden in me did you know the prophet of God said that the religious spirit is five times horbler I'd say that's why you put it five times horribler and any other spirit now this is a man this is a prophet it's a truth it's a prophet who dealt with such stubborn spirits he dealt with those epilepsy spirits of stubborn spirits he dealt with Spirits all the time casting these Devils out and then he stands up and says but that religious spirit is five times horbler than any other spirit you know why the religious spirit will make you feel like you're pretty important no matter what the Bible says about the religious spirit will make you feel like you're okay the fact [Music] with Goods I am rich I have need of nothing that's a religious spirit but when Jesus talked he says but I say to you you're blind you're poor you're miserable you're wretched and you don't know it [Music] Hallelujah that's what's out there that's not what's in here that spirit is a part of the curse but you and I have been given a message to wake up can you say
