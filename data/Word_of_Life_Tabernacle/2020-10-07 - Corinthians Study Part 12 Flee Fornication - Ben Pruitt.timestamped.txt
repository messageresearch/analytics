[27:50] nice to have you here
[27:51] this evening i've got kind of a heavy
[27:54] subject this evening but i
[27:55] you know i don't want to diminish the
[27:57] seriousness of it but i've tried to cut
[27:59] back as much as i can
[28:01] and not not keep you too long i
[28:04] heard about a preacher who was wearing a
[28:07] band-aid
[28:08] when he would come to the pulpit and he
[28:10] told the people he was sorry said he
[28:11] well he said i was thinking about my
[28:13] sermon and i cut my face
[28:15] and said that they got a note in the
[28:18] offering basket said
[28:20] preacher who said next time think about
[28:22] your face and cut your sermon
[28:25] so maybe we should do that more often
[28:30] amen first corinthians chapter 6 and
[28:32] verse 12 all things are lawful unto me
[28:35] but all things are not expedient all
[28:38] things are lawful for me
[28:40] but i will not be brought under the
[28:42] power
[28:43] of any i pray the lord without his
[28:45] blessing to the word but let's bow our
[28:46] heads just for a moment
[28:48] heavenly father we thank you that you've
[28:50] allowed us to come together again
[28:52] tonight
[28:53] i pray that you would just come and you
[28:56] would speak
[28:56] to your people you know what we have
[28:58] need of tonight lord and
[29:00] i pray that there would not be one thing
[29:02] said that shouldn't be said but that
[29:04] everything that you want
[29:05] said would be said lord and i pray that
[29:09] you would just reach down in the hearts
[29:11] and begin to work
[29:12] only you can do that lord and i pray
[29:15] father that you would just touch every
[29:17] every heart lord and and somehow you
[29:20] would bring healing and peace and
[29:21] comfort in our lives
[29:23] as only you can do i pray you granted
[29:25] now in jesus name
[29:27] amen god bless you you could be seated
[29:30] this evening
[29:36] paul is responding to an argument in
[29:38] corinthians chapter
[29:40] 6 that the corinthians have evidently
[29:44] made
[29:44] that the law was done away with in
[29:46] christ
[29:47] and so it became a doctrine that all
[29:49] things are lawful
[29:51] and paul says that's true all things are
[29:55] lawful
[29:56] and brother branham illustrates that by
[29:58] saying that if you were
[30:01] given a pass to be able to drive any
[30:02] speeds you wanted to or you were the
[30:04] mayor of the city or whatever you could
[30:06] drive whatever speed you wanted to
[30:08] and the speed law would have no effect
[30:10] on you because you've already
[30:12] you're above that law that's the way we
[30:15] are we are above the law in that sense
[30:18] but he says all things are not expedient
[30:20] and that
[30:21] that word's a little bit tricky but he's
[30:24] the it's a play on words in the original
[30:26] it and it's imitated somewhat in the
[30:28] english by thing
[30:29] saying all things are in my power but i
[30:32] will not be brought under the power of
[30:34] any
[30:34] in other words i can do what i want but
[30:38] as christians and you might ask you know
[30:41] the question might come up why would you
[30:42] preach to christians about
[30:45] these things well the truth is our
[30:47] bodies are not converted
[30:49] and our spirits are not converted and
[30:50] yet those things and we'll talk about it
[30:52] later have to come
[30:53] in subjection to the soul that is
[30:56] converted
[30:58] so we need to hear these things our
[30:59] children need to hear these things and
[31:01] and
[31:02] there's things that have to be said and
[31:04] but we're not to come under the tyranny
[31:06] of supposed freedom
[31:10] boundless intemperance becomes tyranny
[31:14] and the pretense of moral freedom ends
[31:16] in moral
[31:17] bondage so not all things that are
[31:20] lawful are expedient
[31:22] anything that would offend my weak
[31:24] brother or would enslave my own
[31:26] soul is something that i shouldn't do
[31:30] because all things are lawful for me but
[31:32] i will not be brought under the power of
[31:33] any
[31:34] john wesley uh kind of defined it this
[31:36] way he said
[31:38] if there's anything that would make me
[31:40] uneasy when i abstain
[31:42] from it then i'm under the power of it
[31:46] let me repeat that because that that
[31:48] could hit a lot of areas in our life
[31:51] anything that would make me uneasy if i
[31:53] abstain from it
[31:55] i'm under the power of it and
[31:59] that could be your phone right
[32:02] and i know some of you i know how it is
[32:04] because you feel like you've got it in
[32:06] your pocket and
[32:07] if you don't have it there you reach for
[32:09] it you panic a little bit if you don't
[32:11] have it
[32:11] maybe the rest of you don't do that but
[32:13] some of us younger folk do
[32:15] because it becomes almost a part of you
[32:19] but you're under the power of it if it
[32:21] makes you uneasy to abstain from it and
[32:23] john wesley learned well from his mother
[32:25] and i love this
[32:27] susanna wesley wrote this in a letter to
[32:29] john wesley
[32:30] in 1725 she said take this rule
[32:33] whatever weakens your reason impairs the
[32:37] tenderness of your conscience
[32:39] obscures your sense of god and that's
[32:42] very important because
[32:44] sin and some things maybe that wouldn't
[32:47] be open sin but would be
[32:49] the appearance of evil actually
[32:52] takes us away from the feeling of the
[32:55] grandeur of god
[32:56] and the awesomeness if i could say it
[32:58] that way of god
[33:00] and if it does it's sin and so he said
[33:03] she said obscures your sense of god or
[33:05] takes off your relish
[33:06] of spiritual things in short whatever
[33:09] increases
[33:10] the strength and authority of your body
[33:13] over your mind let me let me reread that
[33:17] whatever increases the strength and
[33:19] authority
[33:20] of your body over your mind that thing
[33:23] is sin to you
[33:25] however innocent it may be in itself
[33:31] brother branham lists the truth of
[33:35] grace not being disgraced as one of the
[33:37] loose ends
[33:39] to be revealed by the seventh angel
[33:40] messenger he says the grace straightened
[33:43] out
[33:44] and this is that quote that next quote
[33:46] if it's on there the grace straightened
[33:48] out not disgrace
[33:50] but real true grace isn't that what you
[33:53] want to have
[33:55] not disgrace but real true grace
[33:59] and he explains that very well in the
[34:00] law having a shadow and i know i'm
[34:02] taking a long time on this one
[34:04] verse but it's very important all things
[34:07] are lawful
[34:08] but all things are not expedient and so
[34:11] brother branham says i'll
[34:12] always do what i want to do god lets me
[34:16] do what i want to do
[34:18] and i'm so glad of it if i did what the
[34:20] devil wanted me to do it's hard to tell
[34:22] what i would do
[34:24] but if i do what i wanted to do like i
[34:26] did before i was saved
[34:28] he said but now there's a new spirit in
[34:30] there and it's not the spirit of a lamb
[34:32] neither the spirit of william brandon
[34:34] it's the spirit of jesus christ
[34:36] that makes me love the unlovable makes
[34:39] me do things that i thought i never
[34:41] would do
[34:42] it's him he said why if it was me you
[34:44] know he said what i'd have said tonight
[34:46] he said i'd have called up mr boze and
[34:48] said boy look i've been up for two
[34:50] nights i ain't had a bit of sleep
[34:52] i ain't slept about two hours the last
[34:54] two nights going and coming and people
[34:56] at the door
[34:57] everything else way in the night and try
[34:58] to lay down a few minutes and
[35:00] get you up again he said then it's broke
[35:02] and then that goes away
[35:03] here's another he said sure i just
[35:05] stayed home
[35:06] but there was something in me that
[35:08] wasn't me that said you're supposed to
[35:10] be in chicago tonight
[35:12] so brother branham ties this this grace
[35:15] this
[35:16] uh this new spirit that he has how he
[35:18] does what he wants to do
[35:20] to serving god in his capacity as a
[35:22] minister he said i could have not come
[35:24] but i came
[35:25] even though i was tired why because
[35:28] there was something in me
[35:30] and that's why we live for god isn't it
[35:33] that's why we want to do the right
[35:34] things is because there's something in
[35:35] us
[35:37] and so he said it was 12 30 at home and
[35:40] about 280 miles to drive through that
[35:42] traffic i said lord
[35:44] i'm going you help me he said he did i
[35:47] got just in time i was here see
[35:48] it's something in you he said there is
[35:51] therefore now no condemnation
[35:53] can't be to those that are in christ for
[35:56] they don't walk after the lusts of the
[35:58] flesh
[35:59] they walk after the spirit and if you
[36:00] love the lord you want to do
[36:02] everything you can to please him
[36:07] if you love god that's what it's about
[36:10] i heard a story that of a king who had
[36:14] four sons and
[36:15] he was telling his sons that he was
[36:18] thinking about which one to give the
[36:20] kingdom to and pondering it and
[36:21] as he was getting older and this first
[36:24] son come to him and said i'm
[36:26] he said i'm intelligent he said i'm the
[36:28] most intelligent person in your kingdom
[36:30] if you give it to me
[36:32] we'll have the most intelligent kingdom
[36:33] there is the best run
[36:35] and the next one said well i'm wealthy
[36:38] i've made all this
[36:39] money and he said i will have the
[36:41] wealthiest kingdom that there is in the
[36:43] world
[36:44] the third son come to him and said i'm
[36:46] strong i'm able to fight he said if we
[36:49] everybody will be afraid of us if no one
[36:52] will will come against our borders if
[36:54] if i'm the one that takes over the
[36:56] kingdom
[36:57] the fourth one come up and said i'm not
[37:00] very strong
[37:01] he said i'm not very intelligent he said
[37:05] i'm not
[37:06] i don't have very much money he said but
[37:10] during this entire time all these others
[37:12] gained intelligence and strength and
[37:15] all these things he said i just learned
[37:17] how to love people
[37:20] and guess which one the king gave the
[37:22] kingdom to
[37:25] because if you love people you're going
[37:26] to do the right thing for them
[37:28] the kingdom will be where it's supposed
[37:30] to be and if we love people
[37:33] and if we love god we'll do what we're
[37:34] supposed to do
[37:36] if you love the lord you want to do
[37:37] everything you can to please him
[37:39] so brother branham said well let's take
[37:41] it this way so that the unlearned would
[37:43] understand if you love your wife right
[37:45] he said i love my wife real good my he
[37:48] said well what if there was such a thing
[37:49] if some other woman would come up and
[37:51] say
[37:52] billy i love you too and she'd be a real
[37:54] pretty girl and say i love you
[37:56] well she won't do it but if she would
[37:58] see he said you know what i'd tell her
[38:00] i'd say look sister kneel down there a
[38:02] minute i want to pray with you a little
[38:04] about it
[38:06] well you say bill you're in africa asia
[38:08] somewhere else your wife would never
[38:09] know it
[38:10] that might be true if she never did know
[38:12] it i'd know it
[38:14] see i would know it and another thing if
[38:16] i love her the right way she
[38:17] you say well if she loves you so much
[38:19] she'd forgive you that may be so too
[38:22] but i love her too much to do it see he
[38:24] said that's
[38:25] grace not nothing i'd done but it's just
[38:29] my love for her
[38:30] and that's the way our love is to christ
[38:32] when we've been born again and realize
[38:34] that we are sons and daughters of god it
[38:36] ain't me after this and have to
[38:38] paul said all things to me are lawful
[38:40] but not all expedient
[38:41] he said so it isn't some law that i have
[38:44] to preach the gospel
[38:45] it isn't some law that i have to do this
[38:47] it's because i love him
[38:49] so much i trust that's why you're here
[38:52] tonight
[38:53] it's because i love him so much that's
[38:55] why i want to come to the house of the
[38:57] lord and
[38:57] he said if you love him like that he
[39:00] said as long as i love my wife like that
[39:03] she don't have to never worry amen
[39:06] and as long as she loves me like that
[39:09] she don't have to worry
[39:11] he didn't have to worry you might say
[39:15] well brother ben if we love each other
[39:17] like that then it shouldn't matter
[39:20] if we're in compromising situations
[39:22] that's false
[39:25] love does not just keep you in
[39:27] compromising situations that keeps you
[39:29] out of
[39:30] compromising situations
[39:34] if you love somebody you won't go into
[39:36] that situation
[39:38] i heard about that boy i'm just in a
[39:40] storytelling mood tonight i guess
[39:43] but i heard about a boy who was gonna go
[39:46] or was told not to go swimming
[39:49] down in the old strip pits where they
[39:51] take the gravel out of and
[39:53] his dad told him don't go swimming he
[39:55] sees him coming back one afternoon and
[39:57] he's coming back he got a pair of
[39:58] swimming trunks in his hand
[39:59] wet he said where you been he said i've
[40:02] been swimming down in the
[40:03] in the strip pit he said well he said
[40:06] but i didn't mean to
[40:07] he said i didn't intend to he said it
[40:09] was just overtaken by temptation
[40:12] and the father said well how come you
[40:13] got to swim in trunks he said well i put
[40:15] them on just in case
[40:21] he didn't prepare him he didn't prepare
[40:22] himself very well did he
[40:27] now and that's what a lot of people do
[40:29] say well i'm in a compromising situation
[40:31] if i really love my wife i don't
[40:33] want anything happen if you really love
[40:35] her you won't put yourself in that
[40:36] situation
[40:39] so brother brown says this and taking
[40:41] sides with jesus and this is what
[40:43] brother branham ties to this
[40:44] scripture this scripture i'm not
[40:48] making that up he ties it to all things
[40:50] are lawful
[40:51] but not all expedient in taking sides
[40:53] with jesus he said many times i'd go to
[40:55] houses and there are women standing out
[40:57] there
[40:57] he says i go to the house knock on the
[40:59] door and a sister would come to the door
[41:01] come in brother branham if her husband
[41:03] is not there he said let's it's a case
[41:05] of sickness and somebody with me
[41:07] i don't go now watch it he said unless
[41:11] it's a case of sickness and there's
[41:12] someone with me
[41:15] i don't go he said and then they call me
[41:18] to a hospital or to a room and say
[41:19] brother
[41:20] branham come over here i'm sister
[41:21] so-and-so from so and so i'm here at the
[41:23] hotel i brought my mother along she's
[41:25] sick
[41:25] he said i'd take my wife if i don't i
[41:28] take some other brother
[41:30] he said i think it would be all right
[41:31] for me to go in there but what if
[41:33] somebody seen me go in there
[41:35] in other words he knew he wouldn't do
[41:36] anything he knew his heart
[41:39] right but what if somebody seen me do it
[41:41] he said see then the first thing you
[41:42] know they would say he went in there
[41:43] where that woman was he's chasing after
[41:45] women
[41:46] he said that would be a thing i
[41:47] shouldn't do see
[41:49] and he said you should never do anything
[41:51] like that
[41:52] because you put a stumbling in somebody
[41:54] else's way
[41:55] he said see i don't believe that i would
[41:57] do anything wrong in there
[41:59] he said i would and trust god to go in
[42:01] there he said no matter what the thing
[42:02] was i would trust god
[42:03] but yet see i loved the lord well enough
[42:07] till i wouldn't do it he said see it's
[42:10] the love you have
[42:11] he said you'll not do it because it's a
[42:13] duty to do it you do it because you love
[42:15] the lord
[42:16] he said you don't have to do it but you
[42:18] do it anyhow
[42:20] paul said to me all things are lawful
[42:22] but not all are expedient see paul could
[42:23] do lots of things
[42:25] maybe he knew the lord understood him
[42:27] and trusted him but it wasn't expedient
[42:29] for him to do it
[42:32] so in the next verse and i think that
[42:34] explains it better than i could explain
[42:36] and in first corinthians 6 13
[42:38] paul says meets for the belly belly for
[42:41] meets but god shall destroy both it
[42:43] and them now the body is not for
[42:45] fornication but for the lord
[42:48] and the lord for the body so
[42:51] their argument that would class this is
[42:53] something that doesn't matter
[42:55] he said people wouldn't make that
[42:56] argument today they have made it
[42:58] the world is making that argument it
[43:00] doesn't matter
[43:01] and i've had message people make it to
[43:03] me that it doesn't matter but it does
[43:06] matter
[43:08] he said now the body is not for
[43:09] fornication before the lord and lord for
[43:10] the body
[43:12] so they were saying this is the same as
[43:15] eating meat or not eating meat that
[43:17] fornication
[43:19] was the same problem it was no different
[43:22] than what kind of meat he said it
[43:24] doesn't matter what you do because it's
[43:26] a necessity
[43:27] but paul's saying it's not a necessity
[43:29] food is a necessity
[43:31] the stomach was formed for the purpose
[43:33] of digesting food
[43:36] fornication is not a necessity it's a
[43:38] deadly sin
[43:40] it's not a natural necessity but a
[43:42] consuming evil
[43:45] god did make a way in marriage
[43:48] and no other way now first corinthians 6
[43:51] 14
[43:52] let's look at that and god has both
[43:54] raised up the lord and will
[43:55] also raise up us by his own power now
[43:58] paul is
[43:58] tying us in our bodies and want us to
[44:02] get that tonight he's tying us not just
[44:04] in our soul
[44:05] but our body to christ because when
[44:08] christ when he saved you he saved you to
[44:11] redeem you completely
[44:13] not just your soul but now your soul is
[44:16] not
[44:16] completely redeemed until we take a body
[44:18] change or your body is not right
[44:21] your soul is completely redeemed but
[44:22] your body's still flesh
[44:24] so we have to talk about these things
[44:27] otherwise we wouldn't have to
[44:29] but there will be a time when it's
[44:31] completely redeemed
[44:33] there's complete redemption there's what
[44:35] we call full adoption
[44:37] right but but right now we're living in
[44:39] this condition where
[44:41] that soul has got to take authority over
[44:43] the body
[44:45] but paul says you don't just serve god
[44:47] with your soul
[44:49] you serve god with your flesh
[44:52] right so now he said god raised up the
[44:55] lord will also raise up
[44:57] us by his own power so we are identified
[45:00] in his death burial and resurrection
[45:01] so we identify ourselves body soul and
[45:04] spirit with god
[45:05] verse 15 know you not that your bodies
[45:07] are the members of christ
[45:10] he said shall i then take the members of
[45:11] christ and make them the members of an
[45:13] harlot
[45:14] god forbid so he's arguing again you
[45:18] don't serve god just with your soul
[45:20] but also with your spirit and your body
[45:22] because you are the body of christ
[45:25] now look and we've heard it said this
[45:29] way that
[45:30] you're his hands that's you're his
[45:32] physical hands
[45:34] right these are his feet if he has
[45:37] physical feet today it's
[45:39] us right if he has hands he
[45:42] physical hands it's us god brother brown
[45:44] says always uses
[45:46] man he always does not just part of the
[45:49] time
[45:50] and so we can't separate and it's a
[45:52] dangerous mentality
[45:54] when we begin to separate well i i live
[45:56] this way but i know i'm saved
[45:58] i know that i'm right but you can't
[46:00] separate that
[46:01] if you know you're saved it's got to
[46:03] take precedence over this other
[46:05] there's got to come a time when when
[46:07] your baptism and your
[46:08] and your experience with god and all
[46:10] those things does some good
[46:13] huh and there's a time to be a baby
[46:16] and there's a time to grow up there's a
[46:19] time
[46:20] you expect somebody to make mistakes and
[46:22] will always make mistakes because of the
[46:24] flesh
[46:25] right but we we got to grow in those
[46:29] right the mistakes you make you still
[46:30] make mistakes as an adult but the
[46:32] mistakes you make are different
[46:34] you make more mature mistakes
[46:37] right and the problem with the
[46:38] corinthians is they kept making the same
[46:40] mistakes over and over again
[46:42] with no maturity
[46:46] are you with me so far
[46:49] so now so we serve god with all of our
[46:52] and that's why
[46:53] when we're baptized we're buried with
[46:55] him in baptism and i guess this is good
[46:57] because
[46:57] our sister is going to be baptized but
[47:00] you're buried with him and baptized you
[47:02] don't
[47:02] bury just a part of you it's not
[47:05] spiritual
[47:07] it's an outward show that your whole
[47:08] body body's going under
[47:11] you're dying and then you're being
[47:13] resurrected
[47:14] and it's the soul that's resurrected now
[47:16] but the body will be
[47:19] right so now brother branham explains
[47:22] this and who is this melchizedek he said
[47:24] then you see
[47:25] he's speaking of christ he said he come
[47:27] right down the regular line
[47:28] from attribute before the foundation of
[47:30] the world his name
[47:32] is put on the lamb's book of life then
[47:34] from that he become the word the
[47:35] theophany
[47:36] that could appear disappear he said then
[47:39] he become flesh and return back again
[47:41] resurrected that same body in a
[47:42] glorified condition
[47:44] he said but you bypass the theophany and
[47:46] become flesh man
[47:48] to be tempted by sin and then if this
[47:51] earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have
[47:53] one already waiting
[47:55] we have not yet the bodies he said but
[47:57] look when this body receives the spirit
[47:59] of god
[48:00] this body receives the spirit of god
[48:03] the immortal life inside of you it
[48:06] throws this body
[48:08] in subjection to god
[48:11] he said he that's born of god does not
[48:13] commit sin he cannot sin romans 8 1
[48:15] and he quotes there is therefore now no
[48:17] condemnation in them there in christ
[48:18] jesus they walk not after the flesh
[48:20] but after the spirit that's actually
[48:21] romans 8 1. he said there you are he
[48:22] said see that throws your body subject
[48:25] he said you don't have to say oh if i
[48:26] could just quit drinking
[48:29] he said just get in christ he said it's
[48:32] all gone see because your body
[48:34] is subject to the spirit no more subject
[48:36] to the things of the world they're dead
[48:38] they're dead
[48:38] your sins are buried in baptism and
[48:40] you're a new creation in christ
[48:42] and your body becoming subject to the
[48:44] spirit try to live a right kind of a
[48:46] life
[48:48] he said like you women claiming you've
[48:50] got the holy ghost and going out here
[48:51] wearing shorts and things how could you
[48:52] do it
[48:53] and brother brown makes that argument
[48:55] all the time it was a very simple thing
[48:57] but he said how could you have the holy
[48:59] ghost and wear those kind of clothes
[49:01] how could the spirit of god in you ever
[49:02] let you do such a thing as like that
[49:04] it just can't be so he said certainly it
[49:07] can't be he's not a filthy
[49:09] spirit he's a holy spirit and then when
[49:12] you become
[49:13] subject to that spirit it throws your
[49:15] whole being
[49:17] subject to that spirit and that spirit
[49:20] is nothing in the world i love this
[49:22] i love this what do we say the spirit
[49:24] and the word were the same
[49:26] he said that spirit is nothing in the
[49:27] world but this seed word made manifest
[49:31] or quickened hallelujah made a life and
[49:34] when the bible said don't do this
[49:36] that body quickly turns to it
[49:39] there is no question
[49:42] and what is it it's the earnest of the
[49:44] resurrection
[49:46] amen i love this this body will be
[49:49] raised up again
[49:51] that's why we could have such assurance
[49:52] for our sister when she passed away
[49:54] because this body will be raised up
[49:56] again
[49:57] because it's already started amen
[50:01] it's already started it was once subject
[50:03] to sin admire and corruption
[50:05] but now it's got the earnest it's turned
[50:08] heavenly
[50:09] he said now that's the earnest that
[50:10] you're going in the rapture it's the
[50:11] earnest
[50:13] hey man you had to have something
[50:16] to have something later on
[50:22] oh if we could only understand there's
[50:23] got to be a change in our life and
[50:25] that's not the doctrine the world
[50:26] teaches today
[50:27] and that's why the churches are full of
[50:29] people who have not changed
[50:32] but but it should not be us we've been
[50:33] taught better than that
[50:36] we we have to change there's got to be
[50:38] because the earnest
[50:39] is here the token he said that's the
[50:41] earnest you're going in the rapture it's
[50:42] the earnest
[50:44] he said a sick person laying dying
[50:45] nothing left but death that's all can
[50:47] happen
[50:48] he said i've seen the shadows of people
[50:49] don't eat up with cancer and
[50:50] tuberculosis
[50:52] see them persons a little after that
[50:54] perfectly normal and strong
[50:56] listen this ties back to last wednesday
[50:58] night he said if there is no divine
[51:00] healing
[51:00] then there is no resurrection because
[51:03] divine healing is the earnest of the
[51:05] resurrection
[51:07] he said you know what the earnest money
[51:08] is don't you it's the down payment
[51:10] he was wounded for our transgressions
[51:12] with his tribes were healed he said
[51:14] notice how wonderful
[51:15] we love him he said now this body is
[51:18] subject to the spirit
[51:20] have not yet entered into the word form
[51:23] but we're still in the flesh form
[51:25] but subject to the word and death in the
[51:29] flesh
[51:30] will take us there aren't you looking
[51:33] forward to that day
[51:36] that's why when you get sick you get
[51:39] healed and you get sick again
[51:41] i know sister joanna don't want to hear
[51:42] that
[51:44] but you get sick again but if you're
[51:47] ever saved
[51:48] you'll never get sin sick again
[51:51] you may make mistakes but you'll never
[51:53] be a sinner again
[51:55] you ever get saved because the soul is
[51:57] what carries you through
[51:58] and death in the flesh takes us there
[52:00] now
[52:01] first corinthians 6 16 he says what
[52:06] only not that he which is joined to a
[52:08] harlot is one body
[52:10] for two saith he shall be one flesh
[52:13] he that is joined unto the lord is one
[52:16] spirit
[52:18] you can't be one flesh with a with any
[52:20] person outside of marriage
[52:22] and be one spirit with god
[52:25] you can't say that i'm one flesh with
[52:28] someone outside of marriage and
[52:30] but god blesses me god he may allow
[52:32] blessings to fall on you because he
[52:33] allows blessings to fall on the
[52:35] just and the unjust but you can't be
[52:39] that
[52:39] and and be one spirit with god
[52:43] it's an impossibility a person no matter
[52:46] you know and what happens is even if
[52:49] you're a saved born-again person and i
[52:52] people say well you couldn't fall into
[52:53] that i don't know the flesh is still
[52:55] unsafe but i know if it's subject to the
[52:58] spirit you can't fall into
[53:00] that right but but there there's
[53:03] something in the flesh that's always
[53:04] unsaved but
[53:05] so that's not for me to judge but
[53:08] but i do know this that if you do that
[53:12] the holy spirit would flee from you
[53:14] you'd grieve him from you
[53:18] right and but that's true of anything
[53:21] you know that we do he he lives in a
[53:23] holy temple
[53:24] but we can invite him back in
[53:29] aren't you glad for the grace of god
[53:32] that when you grieved him you can invite
[53:33] him back
[53:38] so paul says flee fornication verse 18
[53:42] flee fornication every sin that a man
[53:45] doeth is without
[53:47] the body but he that committed
[53:49] fornication sinneth against his own body
[53:52] flee fornication that's all unlawful
[53:55] commerce with women
[53:57] wesley said it this way it was speed
[53:59] with abhorrence
[54:00] with all your might like joseph with
[54:03] potiphar's wife
[54:04] if you have to lose something to flee it
[54:08] still run right if you've got to give up
[54:11] your dignity to flee if you've got to be
[54:13] put in prison
[54:14] like joseph was to run from it still run
[54:18] because it'll destroy your life and
[54:20] joseph knew that he'd rather have his
[54:21] character
[54:22] than his position in potiphar's house
[54:25] he'd rather have his character
[54:27] and you look today even politicians that
[54:29] what they
[54:30] just excuse me for using this language
[54:32] was sleeping their way to the top
[54:33] and and those kind of things it's it's
[54:35] abhorrent to god
[54:38] and and it should not even be mentioned
[54:40] among us as becoming saints now
[54:43] joseph fled from potiphar's wife now
[54:46] that word
[54:47] fornication is porneia in the greek it
[54:50] it's an extremely broad word we've
[54:51] talked about
[54:52] it before but it means any sexual
[54:54] activity outside of marriage
[54:57] brother branham talks about in the
[54:59] invisible union of the bride of christ
[55:01] he said look on
[55:02] these screens and see those movie stars
[55:04] kissing and hugging and slopping around
[55:05] over these women
[55:07] he said a woman does that does that is
[55:09] of a bad character
[55:11] he said she might be virtuous otherwise
[55:13] but in her heart
[55:14] he said those gland sex lamps are on the
[55:16] lips the man kisses the woman he's
[55:17] actually potentially committed adultery
[55:20] sex lands are in the woman's lips and
[55:21] the man's lips he could kiss her on the
[55:23] hand it wouldn't mix
[55:24] the sex glands but the sex glances in
[55:26] the lips and all he said all this
[55:27] nonsense in hollywood today of all this
[55:29] slopping and loving around with women
[55:31] and so forth he said a little girl's
[55:33] looking at all that
[55:35] he said no wonder our morals are rotten
[55:37] and decayed and filthy
[55:39] because it's put before the children
[55:42] i said well it's just put before worldly
[55:44] children that's not true
[55:46] sadly that's not true my kids were very
[55:50] young when they come to me and begin to
[55:51] talk
[55:51] to me about school and say why my
[55:53] teacher is goes to a certain church and
[55:56] she just lives with her boyfriend she's
[55:59] a christian she's a good person why is
[56:02] she not right
[56:04] and have to explain that to him because
[56:05] that's just the way the world is today
[56:07] it's put before the children it's put
[56:09] before them especially on movies and
[56:11] and on tv screens it's put before the
[56:13] children brother brown says it has to be
[56:16] that way for the last day we're living
[56:19] in a rough time
[56:22] i read a survey said roughly one-third
[56:24] of evangelical protestants that's the
[56:26] cream of the crop
[56:28] that's the best of the best that in this
[56:30] nation that you've got it's the group
[56:32] that called themselves evangelical
[56:33] that's what people that call themselves
[56:35] born again
[56:37] brother brown or the survey said that
[56:39] one-third of those say casual sex
[56:41] between consenting adults
[56:43] is always or sometimes acceptable
[56:46] that's one out of three over half of
[56:49] people who call themselves christians
[56:50] say it's okay
[56:53] and if you look at the younger
[56:54] generation the numbers are astronomical
[56:58] the people in their teens and 20s and
[57:00] 30s who believe it's okay
[57:02] regardless of what the bible says but
[57:05] it's not okay
[57:07] it doesn't make it right and we're going
[57:09] the farther the longer we swim upstream
[57:12] the more the stronger the current gets
[57:15] but we're going somewhere
[57:18] we're getting close to the ocean we're
[57:19] getting close to home
[57:21] but the farther you go the stronger and
[57:23] the longer you swim the more weak you
[57:25] get
[57:26] because it takes strength to swim
[57:28] upstream and so we've got to feed on the
[57:30] word
[57:31] to be able to swim because we're
[57:33] swimming against the current
[57:36] someone said that politically years ago
[57:38] someone said politically to be a
[57:40] conservative was to stand
[57:41] a thwart history yelling stop
[57:44] but i think that says something about us
[57:46] as christians more than
[57:48] political conservatives because politics
[57:50] will always go
[57:51] the way that people want it to go but it
[57:53] says something about us as christians
[57:55] you're standing in the current of
[57:56] history
[57:57] saying stop and the whole world won't
[57:59] stop
[58:00] but we still live right
[58:04] we should and i don't want you to feel
[58:07] condemned because maybe in your life
[58:08] you've had problems i don't say that you
[58:10] have but
[58:11] all of us have had problems all of us
[58:12] have struggled with these things
[58:14] as adults especially all of us have but
[58:18] remember
[58:19] god's grace is sufficient
[58:24] and what you've done your past is your
[58:26] past they call it the past for a reason
[58:29] right because it is past and there is
[58:33] grace for these things i believe the
[58:34] grace of god can cover any
[58:36] sin but you've got to stop and move on
[58:43] and i've got to touch on this and we'll
[58:45] move on but
[58:47] virtual fornication is still fornication
[58:49] it would be covered under the idea of
[58:50] porneia
[58:52] matthew 5 28 jesus said whosoever
[58:54] looketh on a woman to lust after earth
[58:56] committed adultery with her already in
[58:57] his heart
[59:00] pornography especially in this age
[59:01] destroys women and men
[59:05] and if you're struggling with that i you
[59:07] know there's an interview
[59:08] that dr dobson did years ago with ted
[59:11] bundy the serial killer
[59:13] and you can find it online and he'll
[59:15] tell you how he got started
[59:17] and that's the way he started
[59:20] and it leaves you with never enough
[59:24] never enough and you'll never be
[59:26] satisfied with your marriage never be
[59:28] satisfied and
[59:29] and so it's one of those things flee
[59:30] from it
[59:32] run from it and jesus said it this way
[59:34] and before i read this i
[59:36] not just teenagers struggle with it
[59:38] adults struggle with it too
[59:42] and the truth is that boys and girls
[59:44] struggle with it
[59:46] men and women struggle with it all you
[59:47] have to do is go to a youth meeting and
[59:50] and and be involved in counseling and
[59:51] you'll find that out
[59:53] but jesus said this is the best advice i
[59:55] can give you on that in matthew 18 9 if
[59:57] thine hand defend thee pluck it out
[59:59] cast it from me it is better or if thy
[1:00:01] eye rather offend thee pluck it out cast
[1:00:03] it from thee it is better
[1:00:04] for thee to enter into life with one eye
[1:00:07] rather than having two eyes to be cast
[1:00:09] into hell fire
[1:00:10] that's not taking your physical eye out
[1:00:12] but it's taking the opportunity away
[1:00:17] and i'll say this and man i feel like
[1:00:19] i'm preaching at the choir tonight
[1:00:22] but y'all bear with me i know others
[1:00:24] will watch this and those that aren't
[1:00:25] here are watching tonight i trust
[1:00:26] trusted they are
[1:00:29] and we're not throwing anything at them
[1:00:31] either but our kids have to know
[1:00:33] and we have to be reminded you can live
[1:00:36] without television
[1:00:38] you can live without internet you can
[1:00:40] live without facebook
[1:00:42] you can live without a cell phone but
[1:00:44] you can't live without god
[1:00:48] and if you can't be one body you can't
[1:00:51] be one flesh with the world and
[1:00:53] love the world and the things of the
[1:00:54] world and love god
[1:00:56] you can do away with all those things
[1:00:58] and you know what
[1:01:00] if you've got a problem with it do away
[1:01:01] with it the worst
[1:01:03] place that a person that has a problem
[1:01:06] with that can be is on facebook
[1:01:09] it's the absolute worst place uh
[1:01:13] back in 2012 they did a study of
[1:01:15] facebook one-third of divorces in the uk
[1:01:17] were linked back to facebook one out of
[1:01:21] three
[1:01:22] i'm not anti-facebook i'm on facebook
[1:01:24] but if you've got a problem with that
[1:01:25] and you see yourself going that way
[1:01:27] it's not worth it it's not worth it
[1:01:32] verse 19. thank you for hanging with me
[1:01:35] tonight
[1:01:37] he says what know ye not that your body
[1:01:39] is the temple of the holy ghost which is
[1:01:41] in you
[1:01:42] which you have of god you are not your
[1:01:45] own
[1:01:46] so he said the holy ghost come from god
[1:01:47] and it lives in you
[1:01:49] in this body right it lives in this body
[1:01:54] what an astounding saying that is that
[1:01:56] your body is the temple of the holy
[1:01:58] ghost
[1:01:59] because there was a day when the living
[1:02:01] god dwelt in moses
[1:02:02] tabernacle and there was a day when it
[1:02:04] dwelt in the temple of solomon you
[1:02:06] remember that coming like a cloud and
[1:02:07] even the post of the doors moved that
[1:02:10] god lives in you
[1:02:14] the god that was so holy that in
[1:02:18] in the holy of holies they could only go
[1:02:20] in once a year as we talked about
[1:02:21] recently and
[1:02:22] and then they wore bells on the bottom
[1:02:24] that if they didn't didn't to make a
[1:02:26] certain noise
[1:02:27] that they were dragged out because they
[1:02:29] would die
[1:02:31] and they could only do that once a year
[1:02:32] to make atonement for the sins of the
[1:02:34] people
[1:02:34] but now we've come to a to a mercy seat
[1:02:37] that's been
[1:02:38] open wide and holy of holies and what is
[1:02:41] it it's right here
[1:02:43] that same god lives in you and lives in
[1:02:47] me
[1:02:49] your body is the temple of the holy
[1:02:50] ghost oh i pray that i would act like it
[1:02:55] don't you want to be his temple then
[1:02:58] what happened to everything in the
[1:02:59] temple had to be purged with blood
[1:03:03] almost everything touched in the temple
[1:03:05] had to be sanctified with blood
[1:03:07] and set apart only for temple worship
[1:03:10] it couldn't be used for anything else
[1:03:12] then what about our bodies
[1:03:15] we're to be set aside and there's you
[1:03:18] know there'll come a day
[1:03:19] when that's all we'll do is worship
[1:03:22] huh that's right we're going to be
[1:03:24] completely set aside to him
[1:03:26] but now we sanctify our bodies
[1:03:29] because this is where he lives
[1:03:32] and so paul says i keep under my body
[1:03:34] and bring it under subjection
[1:03:36] let's have him preach to others i myself
[1:03:38] would be disapproved i don't do that
[1:03:40] because god's going to lose me god's
[1:03:41] going not going to lose me
[1:03:43] i can't be lost if i've been saved he
[1:03:45] can't unsave me
[1:03:48] i'm safe for good but i love him
[1:03:52] so i flee fornication because i love god
[1:03:56] i have to god help us
[1:04:00] flee fornication not because you love
[1:04:02] your spouse though you should do that
[1:04:04] but because you love
[1:04:05] god and then you love your spouse the
[1:04:08] way you should
[1:04:13] bodies of genuine christians should be
[1:04:15] holy
[1:04:17] i don't mean that you'll never make a
[1:04:19] mistake but all of your members should
[1:04:21] be employed
[1:04:23] in the service of god alone and here
[1:04:26] paul gives us the reason why
[1:04:27] he says in first corinthians 6 20 for
[1:04:29] you are bought with a price
[1:04:34] you were bought with a price
[1:04:38] i read another story
[1:04:41] that of course i did about a
[1:04:45] a slave a young slave girl that was
[1:04:48] being auctioned off she was about 20
[1:04:49] years old and
[1:04:50] a beautiful slave girl she was so scared
[1:04:53] because she didn't know what was going
[1:04:54] to happen
[1:04:55] there were two men bidding on her the
[1:04:58] one man was the worst man in the city
[1:05:01] the other man looked to be a respectable
[1:05:02] gentleman
[1:05:04] they bid and the price kept going up and
[1:05:07] going up until it reached an
[1:05:08] astronomical sum
[1:05:10] and finally the respectable man bought
[1:05:13] her
[1:05:15] and they walked over and she started
[1:05:17] crying because she didn't know what was
[1:05:18] going to happen
[1:05:20] he walked over to the place and paid the
[1:05:22] price
[1:05:23] he turned around began to sign some
[1:05:25] papers and she began to cry he said
[1:05:27] don't cry
[1:05:28] he said i didn't buy you to keep you i
[1:05:30] bought you to set you free
[1:05:34] that's what he did for us then we become
[1:05:37] a love safe to him
[1:05:39] we owe him the debt of our life he we
[1:05:41] are bought with a price
[1:05:42] he didn't just buy my soul he bought my
[1:05:45] body
[1:05:46] i'm going in a resurrection in a rapture
[1:05:48] he bought me
[1:05:50] all of me and so i should serve him with
[1:05:53] all of me not just part of me
[1:05:56] so i'll bury my whole body in baptism
[1:05:59] i'll just get sprinkled i'll bury myself
[1:06:01] with him
[1:06:02] i'll raise with him when i come up i'll
[1:06:04] sanctify my life i'll make sure i'll get
[1:06:06] rid of everything that's not right and
[1:06:08] i'll let the holy ghost come inside
[1:06:10] of me and live through me and walk
[1:06:12] through me and be
[1:06:13] the life of christ to those around me
[1:06:15] you are bought with a price
[1:06:18] don't forget the price that you were
[1:06:19] bought with
[1:06:22] when you join yourself to a harlot when
[1:06:24] you join yourself in fornication to
[1:06:26] someone
[1:06:26] outside of marriage when you even have
[1:06:29] have the appearance of evil of doing
[1:06:31] that
[1:06:31] you cheapen the price
[1:06:34] and deny that god is omniscient in your
[1:06:37] life and he knows everything
[1:06:41] reminded me of another story but i won't
[1:06:43] tell that one
[1:06:46] you belong to god you are bought with a
[1:06:49] price therefore glorify god in your body
[1:06:52] and in your spirit which are gods
[1:06:55] you belong to god i belong to god not to
[1:06:59] the devil
[1:07:01] he paid it a debt he did not owe
[1:07:05] i owe the debt i could not pay i needed
[1:07:09] someone
[1:07:10] to wash my sins away
[1:07:15] he said therefore glorify god in your
[1:07:17] body and in your spirit
[1:07:19] which are gods not just the soul but
[1:07:21] your body and your spirit are gods
[1:07:24] glorify god in them you don't have to
[1:07:27] tell somebody who
[1:07:28] really loves god to serve god not to
[1:07:31] beat them over the head
[1:07:33] just remind them every now and then
[1:07:35] they'll go right back to the word
[1:07:38] huh are you with me why because you're a
[1:07:41] love slave you're bought with a price he
[1:07:43] said oh lord i didn't mean to hurt you
[1:07:45] you know you're getting a little tiff
[1:07:47] with your wife or
[1:07:49] your spouse you know the thing there is
[1:07:51] you never know whose fault it is and it
[1:07:52] doesn't matter
[1:07:54] but when we get in an estranged
[1:07:56] relationship with god we know whose
[1:07:58] fault it is
[1:08:02] it's ours and it's not the people it's
[1:08:06] not everybody around us not anybody else
[1:08:08] but it's me o lord
[1:08:10] standing in the need of prayer
[1:08:13] i'll close with this another story
[1:08:18] i actually wrote this one down many
[1:08:20] years ago indian youth
[1:08:22] would go away in solitude to prepare for
[1:08:24] manhood
[1:08:25] an old cherokee legend that one youth
[1:08:28] hiked into a beautiful valley green with
[1:08:30] trees
[1:08:31] bright with flowers he began to fast as
[1:08:34] he prepared for his vision that would
[1:08:35] show him what his name was and
[1:08:38] who he would be as their custom was
[1:08:41] on the third day he looked up at the
[1:08:43] surrounding mountains and he noticed one
[1:08:44] tall rugged peak
[1:08:46] capped with dazzling snow he says i'll
[1:08:49] test myself against that mountain he put
[1:08:52] on his shirt
[1:08:54] and he threw his blanket over his
[1:08:56] shoulder and he set off to climb the
[1:08:57] peak
[1:08:59] he reached the top he stood on the rim
[1:09:01] of the world he could see forever
[1:09:03] his heart swelled with pride
[1:09:06] here to wrestle at his feet he looked
[1:09:08] down and
[1:09:09] he saw a snake
[1:09:13] before he could move the snake spoke he
[1:09:14] says the snake says i'm about to die
[1:09:18] it's too cold for me up here and i'm
[1:09:20] freezing there's no food and i'm
[1:09:22] starving
[1:09:23] put me under your shirt and take me down
[1:09:25] to the valley
[1:09:27] no said the youth i am forewarned i know
[1:09:30] you're kind
[1:09:31] you're a rattlesnake if i pick you up
[1:09:33] you'll bite
[1:09:35] and he says your bite will kill me
[1:09:39] not so said the snake i will treat you
[1:09:41] differently
[1:09:42] if you do this for me you'll be special
[1:09:44] i won't harm you
[1:09:47] the youth resisted for a while but it
[1:09:49] was a very persuasive snake with
[1:09:50] beautiful markings and
[1:09:52] last he tucked it under his shirt and
[1:09:54] carried it down to the valley
[1:09:55] he laid it gently on the grass and
[1:09:58] suddenly the snake coiled rattled and
[1:10:02] leapt up and bit him on the leg
[1:10:05] and the youth cried but you promised
[1:10:08] and the snake said this he said you knew
[1:10:10] what i was
[1:10:12] when you picked me up
[1:10:19] flea fornication run from it like i used
[1:10:23] to run from those water snakes
[1:10:25] to pond
[1:10:28] run from it like you saw a box full of
[1:10:32] spiders or whatever it is that you're
[1:10:33] scared of
[1:10:34] run from it or destroy your body and
[1:10:37] this body doesn't belong to you
[1:10:40] it belongs to god could we bow our heads
[1:10:48] heavenly father we thank you for your
[1:10:49] grace
[1:10:52] i thank you for the clarity of your word
[1:10:55] lord i'm
[1:10:56] always so amazed at how you directed
[1:10:59] paul to put these things
[1:11:00] and and just just lay them out for us
[1:11:03] the way that it should be without being
[1:11:06] bolder but but yet being firm and
[1:11:10] and telling us what we needed to know
[1:11:13] i pray you would help us lord we we
[1:11:16] don't want to ever fall into the current
[1:11:18] or just
[1:11:18] just drifting downstream with the
[1:11:20] culture of our age
[1:11:25] years ago some of the things we're
[1:11:26] talking about weren't so abnormal
[1:11:29] but today to be a christian is to live a
[1:11:33] strange lifestyle different from the
[1:11:36] world
[1:11:38] to be a message believer today is to
[1:11:41] is to run counter to the effects of
[1:11:44] the culture lord help us to do it with
[1:11:47] all of our heart
[1:11:49] we know we're swimming upstream and and
[1:11:51] we get weak sometimes lord but
[1:11:53] i pray you would send grace and those
[1:11:56] sufficient amounts that we need
[1:11:59] in the hour when we need it lord
[1:12:02] thank you for that oh god i
[1:12:06] i pray you would forgive me lord if i've
[1:12:08] done anything or said anything that
[1:12:10] would
[1:12:11] would grieve you from my heart i pray
[1:12:12] you would forgive me lord
[1:12:15] or these people sitting here and those
[1:12:18] watching those that will watch
[1:12:19] lord i pray that every sin would be
[1:12:22] under
[1:12:23] under the blood god that we could trust
[1:12:26] in your grace not being something that
[1:12:28] just allowed us to do
[1:12:29] what the world does but something that
[1:12:31] lets us do what we want to do
[1:12:33] but it changes our want our desire
[1:12:36] we're so thankful for that lord where
[1:12:39] would we be without your grace
[1:12:42] lord it bad enough what we were until
[1:12:45] your grace came to us and
[1:12:47] we make so many mistakes but lord we
[1:12:49] know you're still god
[1:12:51] lord i place this in your hands god in
[1:12:54] this church we've
[1:12:55] been placed in your hands that i i can't
[1:12:58] change the culture by myself but i'll
[1:13:01] stand against the current
[1:13:03] and swim upstream all the other fish may
[1:13:06] flow the other way but god i want to
[1:13:08] swim upstream
[1:13:09] maybe so with every person that hears
[1:13:11] this today
[1:13:12] i pray granted lord and move in our
[1:13:15] midst
[1:13:15] walk with us through life lord
[1:13:17] strengthen us in temptation in the hour
[1:13:20] of trouble father we pray thank you for
[1:13:23] all that you do
