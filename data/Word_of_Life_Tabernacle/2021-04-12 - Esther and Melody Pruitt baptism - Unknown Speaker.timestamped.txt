[0:00] my girls you know you girls are special
[0:03] to you anyway it's such a privilege to
[0:06] be able to baptize
[0:08] your children but i'm just glad to be
[0:11] able to use this as well
[0:13] when we put this in installed it it's
[0:15] meant for use
[0:16] as long as we're here and as a
[0:18] functioning church i think we ought to
[0:19] be baptizing people
[0:21] and that's part of what we do and i'm
[0:24] grateful for that
[0:26] just giving them a minute to come in
[0:32] i read the girls this morning or last
[0:35] night actually from romans chapter six
[0:39] he says what shall we say then shall we
[0:40] continue in sin that grace may abound
[0:43] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[0:46] sin live any longer therein
[0:48] know you not that so many of us as were
[0:50] baptized into jesus christ were baptized
[0:52] into his death
[0:54] therefore we are buried with him by
[0:56] baptism into death
[0:58] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:00] the dead by the glory of the father
[1:02] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:04] of life
[1:06] if we have been planted together in the
[1:07] likeness of his death we shall be also
[1:09] in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:12] knowing this that our old man is
[1:13] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:16] might be destroyed
[1:17] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:20] for he that is dead is free from sin
[1:24] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[1:26] we should we shall also live with him
[1:28] knowing that christ being raised from
[1:30] the dead diet no more
[1:32] death has no more dominion over him
[1:35] and so it's a great thing it's not a
[1:37] little thing to be baptized and so
[1:39] they both these girls have given their
[1:41] heart to the lord
[1:42] and we're grateful for that jason i
[1:45] didn't get to pray with you last week
[1:47] would you come
[1:48] as well and i'm going to pray with you
[1:49] and them together
[1:51] because i didn't pray with him last week
[1:53] and we're going to pray that god bless
[1:54] these young people then baptize today
[1:56] lord jesus for each one of these
[1:58] children god i pray that you would move
[2:00] in their lives
[2:01] lord not only them but also the ones
[2:03] that are lord in each family
[2:06] god you blessed our families with
[2:07] children we thank you for it and we ask
[2:09] you to just
[2:10] come and fill them all with the holy
[2:12] ghost today
[2:14] never have a question from this moment
[2:15] on lord that you've been moving and
[2:17] working in their lives
[2:18] i pray you grant we thank you for it
[2:20] lord thank you for your presence
[2:22] in jesus name amen amen
[2:46] melody faith i baptize you in the name
[2:48] of the lord jesus christ
[2:55] [Applause]
[3:01] thank the lord
[3:12] this one has taken her a while to get in
[3:16] the water
[3:17] but i'm so grateful peter was seven
[3:19] years old when he was baptized but he's
[3:20] never turned back
[3:22] and i believe that god can deal with the
[3:23] hearts of our children at a young age
[3:33] astronaut baptize you in the name of the
[3:34] lord jesus christ
