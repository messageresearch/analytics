[45:34] am. Well, I can see
[45:40] now who I
[45:45] am. I'm a part of my
[45:52] Savior, a part of his word.
[45:58] It's a
[46:03] revelation. It's
[46:06] [Music]
[46:09] predestination of who I am. I like this
[46:14] one.
[46:16] on
[46:19] Calary. He
[46:21] died to redeem his lost
[46:27] bride. The King of
[46:30] [Music]
[46:33] Kings. He became my Savior.
[46:40] This is God's great
[46:45] mystery of love expressed to
[46:51] me that Christ and
[46:55] I. Oh, think about it now. Might be made
[47:00] one. Let me hear you sing it now. Oh,

[47:25] [Applause]

[47:33] Savior, a part of his word.
[47:39] It's a
[47:41] [Music]
[47:44] revelation. It's
[47:48] predestination. Oh yes, it
[47:50] is of who. One more time with all your
[47:54] hearts. You know who you are this
[47:56] morning. Oh, who I am, Lord.
[48:04] who I
[48:09] am. Oh, I can't see
[48:15] now who I
[48:18] [Music]
[48:20] am. Well, I'm a part of my
[48:24] [Music]
[48:26] savior, a part of his word.
[48:33] It's a
[48:35] [Music]
[48:38] revelation. It's
[48:41] [Music]
[48:44] predestined of
[48:46] who I am. Can you give the Lord a hand
[48:49] clap of praise this morning? Aren't you
[48:51] thankful for the word of the Lord? Amen.
[48:54] We're going to invite the pastor to come

[49:00] little bit, but u, aren't you thankful
[49:02] to have babies to dedicate? Amen. Amen.
[49:04] So, we're going to invite the pastor at

[49:13] for the word this morning because that
[49:15] is that's what sustains us and gives us
[49:17] life. And so, we're thankful for it.
[49:19] Let's sing this with all your hearts
[49:21] now. This is your house.
[49:26] All come and
[49:29] dwell. This is your
[49:34] house. A holy house of
[49:38] prayer. Where the lost and the
[49:42] lonely bring their burdens
[49:46] and this is your
[49:50] house. This is your house.
[49:53] [Music]
[49:55] Come and

[51:08] house. Come and
[51:12] wear. Amen. You're grateful to be in his
[51:15] house and to be his house this morning.
[51:17] God bless you. If you could be seated
[51:18] just for a moment, if the musicians
[51:20] would stay for just a moment. A few
[51:23] years ago, we had a uh a uh
[51:28] uh meeting and uh I remember uh brother
[51:32] Gabe was looking for a wife and uh at
[51:36] that time and uh he was he told me
[51:39] before that he said, "I don't want a
[51:41] girlfriend." He said, "I'm looking for a
[51:43] wife." and we'd been counselled with him
[51:46] talking to him and and a young lady
[51:48] showed up at the meeting and who I knew
[51:51] who I'd had I'd seen her and seen her
[51:52] Christian testimony and things and and
[51:55] we were trying to get him to talk and
[51:57] David and I and didn't seem like they
[51:59] but Gabe was too uh you know he was a
[52:02] little shy but we kind of prodded him in
[52:04] that direction pushed him and pulled him
[52:05] and things like that and he finally went
[52:08] over there and talked to her and a year
[52:11] later they were married and uh
[52:14] and and then the devil give them a
[52:18] really hard time after they got married.
[52:20] And and uh you want to have uh children.
[52:23] That's the fruit of a marriage. And it
[52:25] was something very difficult. But I've
[52:27] asked Sister Millie this morning uh if
[52:29] she's able to to give her testimony. She
[52:32] You're already up here, aren't you? On
[52:34] this side of me. I forget that you are
[52:36] back playing again. We're so thankful to
[52:38] have her back playing the violin. So,
[52:40] she's just going to come here to the uh
[52:42] right right over here and give her
[52:43] testimony this morning and uh of how
[52:46] this went. It's a miracle that we have
[52:48] this baby to dedicate this morning.
[52:52] So, as I was writing this out to try and
[52:55] condense it all, it really just impacted
[52:58] me of how many things went into this
[53:02] testimony. Little things that if we told
[53:06] it all, it would take all day. But I
[53:08] tried to condense it as best I could.
[53:11] Um, our testimony really begins
[53:14] um when we got married in uh 2022. I had
[53:19] rheumatoid arthritis. Um, and due to the
[53:22] medications I was on, we couldn't have a
[53:24] baby because of the side effects, what
[53:27] would happen to the baby. Um, and that
[53:29] really that really grieved us and there
[53:32] was no way for me to get off the
[53:33] medication because of how severe the RA
[53:35] was. Well, Gabe started really praying
[53:38] and claiming that at the July meetings I
[53:41] would be healed of RA and we went
[53:44] through the prayer line and God
[53:46] miraculously healed me. I never had to
[53:48] take another medication, no pain after
[53:51] that.
[53:57] Then in 2023, we were told that we would
[54:00] not be able to have a baby and if we
[54:02] wanted to try, it would take extensive
[54:05] um intervention from the medical
[54:07] field. That really broke our hearts.
[54:11] Well, again, it was in the spring when
[54:13] that we were told that. So that summer,
[54:16] we went through the prayer line again.
[54:18] We claimed our healing. We claimed our
[54:20] promised baby. We picked out a name and
[54:23] we held on to faith that we would hold
[54:25] our
[54:26] child during the journey and the wait
[54:28] for that because it is a journey. We
[54:31] lost two. But we rejoiced that they even
[54:35] existed because their lives were a
[54:36] testimony. Yes. Because we did get
[54:39] pregnant. We did have babies.
[54:43] During the journey of that time, there
[54:45] was so many things that God sent us. so
[54:48] many just pastors or preachers giving
[54:51] sermons or encouragement to help us
[54:53] through that time of
[54:56] struggle. We finally were pregnant with
[54:59] our Lizzy. During the pregnancy, we had
[55:02] a really hard time, both her and I.
[55:04] Satan really fought us, but God was
[55:06] faithful.
[55:08] Then she was born and we rejoiced
[55:11] thinking that it was over. She We had
[55:13] her in our arms. She was safe. But three
[55:15] days later, we were in the
[55:19] NICU. This was the hardest three days of
[55:21] the whole
[55:23] journey. There was a point where we were
[55:25] in the Ronald McDonald home and Lizzie
[55:29] was down in her room and we were just
[55:31] praying and crying out to
[55:32] God just pleading and kind of
[55:37] upset after everything. Here we
[55:41] were. And the song came back to me and
[55:44] the story of Isaac and
[55:47] Abraham. And Isaac had to lay his child
[55:50] on the altar to give it back to the
[55:52] Lord, knowing that he could lose that
[55:56] child. He had to get to that point to
[55:58] where he was okay in a sense of I know
[56:01] you'll get me through somehow. Yeah. So
[56:04] Gabe and I prayed
[56:06] and we just told the Lord, you know, you
[56:08] gave her to us and we rejoiced that we
[56:10] held our promised baby and if you take
[56:13] her, we don't know how, but we know
[56:15] we'll be
[56:17] okay. Little did we know in the room,
[56:20] Lizzy was having one of the hardest
[56:22] episodes she had had, and there was just
[56:26] this pressure to go down to her. and we
[56:29] rushed into her room and right behind us
[56:32] a nurse and a doctor had come in but as
[56:34] soon as we stepped in the room she
[56:36] stabilized and it was over. She didn't
[56:38] have another issue
[56:40] that we went to the ENT and he was like
[56:44] she might have it, she might not. But we
[56:48] just praise the Lord know that she was
[56:50] healed that
[56:53] night.
[56:59] Again, there was just so many little
[57:01] things that happened and if I went into
[57:03] it all, it would take all day. But we
[57:06] just want to thank the Lord for
[57:08] Elizabeth Joanne and her name means
[57:11] God's promise or his oath and God's
[57:13] grace and she is a true representation
[57:16] of that.
[57:18] Thank
[57:21] you.
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:27] They're getting ready to come for the
[57:30] dedication. Make it should make us all
[57:32] believe
[57:34] anything is possible. You're going to be
[57:37] tested, but you're going to have a
[57:39] testimony in the end. Yes. Amen.
[57:47] Just put it right over here.
[57:49] [Music]
[57:54] Bring them
[57:57] in. Bring them
[58:00] in. Bring them in from the fields of
[58:07] sin. Bring them
[58:11] in. Bring them in.
[58:16] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[58:21] [Music]
[58:25] My, she is a perfect
[58:28] angel. She is in daddy's eyes and she is
[58:30] in God's eyes. What a miracle little
[58:33] Elizabeth Joanne has been. We just want
[58:35] to dedicate her to the Lord this
[58:37] morning. Even dedicating her, we had to
[58:39] change the date because I was going to
[58:40] be gone and then didn't work out. But I
[58:43] believe it was a predestined moment for
[58:45] this morning that we would do this. And
[58:48] so we're just going to offer her back to
[58:50] the Lord. Of course, your life is what
[58:52] dedicates her in her life to God.
[58:54] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I pray for
[58:57] this little precious child, Lord, that
[58:59] you brought here, Lord. All of her life
[59:02] if you Terry, Lord, she'll know that she
[59:05] was a miracle. Lord, we thank you for
[59:08] that testimony, oh God. I pray you'd
[59:10] build a hedge round about her. Lord,
[59:12] there's been so much trouble to this
[59:14] point, but at every moment, Lord, you've
[59:16] met the need, Lord. We're praying for a
[59:19] hedge of protection round about her.
[59:21] We're praying for for healing, Lord. And
[59:23] if there would be sickness or something
[59:25] come, keep it away from her, God. I pray
[59:27] that you just help in her life, Lord, as
[59:29] she grows, may she be raised in the fear
[59:32] and admonition of the Lord. May there be
[59:34] strength in this family, Lord, as they
[59:36] grow to become pillars of the church. I
[59:39] pray God you'd keep them as Satan would
[59:41] try to come around and say, "Lord, that
[59:44] they're not worthy." May they point back
[59:45] to this and say, "But God has testified
[59:48] that we are your ch his children." Lord,
[59:51] I pray you'd grant it today. Protect the
[59:53] family. Bless them financially,
[59:54] spiritually, in every way. May they be a
[59:57] blessing and their life be a testimony
[59:59] to all others. We pray in Jesus' name.
[1:00:02] Amen. Amen. God bless you guys. We love
[1:00:05] you so much.
[1:00:08] [Applause]
[1:00:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Could we sing um

[1:02:36] service wonderful? Oh my. One of the
[1:02:39] highlights of my life, brother Gabe, is
[1:02:41] going to be this service and remembering

[1:02:46] the Lord. Looking forward to having

[1:03:15] heaven, now is come salvation and
[1:03:18] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:03:20] the power of his Christ. For the accuser
[1:03:23] of our brethren is cast down. Now notice
[1:03:26] the setting. The accuser of the
[1:03:28] brethren. It's a courtroom. He's the
[1:03:31] prosecuting attorney and he is cast down
[1:03:35] which accused them before our God day
[1:03:37] and night and they overcame him or they
[1:03:40] won the case by the blood of the lamb
[1:03:45] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:03:48] they love not their lives unto the
[1:03:51] death. I want to speak to you this
[1:03:53] morning on the word of your testimony.
[1:03:55] Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly
[1:03:56] Father, Lord, we just want to ask you to
[1:03:58] be with us this morning as we know you
[1:04:00] already are. I pray that the words that
[1:04:02] I would say, Lord, would be clear in the
[1:04:05] hearts of the people. May it only be
[1:04:07] your words. We pray this morning. I pray
[1:04:09] you'd help me, Lord, to be able to say
[1:04:11] what needs to be said and nothing else.
[1:04:12] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless
[1:04:15] you this morning.

[1:04:38] Brother Brandham tells us that
[1:04:39] everything that God has made testifies
[1:04:43] of him. He said you could actually go
[1:04:45] out in nature and if you never had a
[1:04:47] Bible, he said you could watch nature
[1:04:50] and know that the Bible was true because
[1:04:54] nature testifies. Brother Bruce, I know
[1:04:56] you're a hunter and different ones are
[1:04:57] hunters and you if you go out in nature,
[1:05:00] it's more to it than just hunting. I
[1:05:02] know. But it's looking at what God has
[1:05:04] made and you're seeing that uh that it's
[1:05:07] a testimony. The trees are a testimony
[1:05:10] of the grace of God and the resurrecting
[1:05:12] power of Jesus Christ. And everything
[1:05:15] God has made is a testimony. It
[1:05:17] establishes the fact that our God is an
[1:05:20] awesome God and he is a creator of the
[1:05:23] heavens and the earth. And so uh here
[1:05:27] that John in the scripture he said the
[1:05:29] brethren they the brethren overcame
[1:05:32] Satan in this courtroom by the blood of
[1:05:35] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:05:37] testimony. Now uh in the old testament
[1:05:40] let's look at the blood of the lamb
[1:05:42] first because that's what we have to
[1:05:44] have. That's the first witness that we
[1:05:47] have to have for us. It's the blood of
[1:05:48] the lamb. In the Old Testament, the
[1:05:50] standard was set that no one would be
[1:05:53] judged by the testimony of one accuser.
[1:05:56] Whenever the devil comes to you and
[1:05:58] tries to tell you, "Well, uh, you're
[1:05:59] you're a you're not going to make it.
[1:06:02] You're not worthy. Look at what you've
[1:06:03] done. Look at what you've been."
[1:06:05] Remember, he's only one accuser, and no
[1:06:08] one can be judged by one accuser or by
[1:06:11] one witness. But there is a witness for
[1:06:14] you and that witness is the blood of
[1:06:16] Jesus Christ. So the the blood is for
[1:06:20] you. Satan is against you but the blood
[1:06:22] is for you. The Bible says one witness
[1:06:24] shall not rise up against a man for any
[1:06:26] iniquity or for any sin and any sin that
[1:06:30] he sinnth. At the mouth of two witnesses
[1:06:32] or at the mouth of three witnesses shall
[1:06:34] the matter be established. So, uh, in
[1:06:38] fact, you could take that down through
[1:06:39] scripture and you find that even to
[1:06:41] bring an accusation against an elder,
[1:06:44] you've got to have two or three
[1:06:45] witnesses. You can't you can't even hear
[1:06:47] an accusation without two or three
[1:06:49] witnesses. Is that right? Because it
[1:06:51] it's establishing something in our
[1:06:54] hearts that that only one person alone
[1:06:56] cannot take you out. Listen, I did not
[1:06:59] put you in this message. I can't take
[1:07:00] you out of it. I didn't make you a
[1:07:02] Christian. I can't uncchristianize you.
[1:07:05] I'm one man, but something speaks for
[1:07:07] you if you're a Christian today. The
[1:07:09] devil may be against you. The world may
[1:07:11] be against you, but something speaks for
[1:07:13] you. And that's the blood of Jesus
[1:07:15] Christ. Now, our our testimony is good
[1:07:18] if we would testify. But who will
[1:07:20] testify with us, right? You say, "I'm a
[1:07:23] Christian." And that's good. But who
[1:07:25] will testify with you that you're a
[1:07:27] Christian? There must be another witness
[1:07:29] who bears the same witness that you are
[1:07:32] a believer, that you are a Christian,
[1:07:34] that you have been healed, that you are
[1:07:37] saved, and all of these things. So,
[1:07:39] there must be a witness. And we find
[1:07:40] when Cain killed Abel, Abel's blood was
[1:07:43] actually a witness. Now, now stay with
[1:07:46] me this morning. I'm not going to hold
[1:07:47] you long. I I promise. I know it's it's
[1:07:50] been a little bit longer pre-ervice than
[1:07:51] normal, but it's okay. We're going to
[1:07:53] let you out before the second service.
[1:07:58] It'll all be okay. But when Cain killed
[1:08:01] Abel, Abel's blood was a witness. Yes,
[1:08:05] it was a witness against him. Right. And
[1:08:08] and the Bible says, he said, "What has
[1:08:10] thou done?" The voice of thy brother's
[1:08:13] blood crith unto me from the ground. So
[1:08:17] the life that was in the blood, once the
[1:08:19] blood had been spilled, it was evidence.
[1:08:22] It was a witness against Cain and it
[1:08:24] said, "What have you done?" Yeah. Right?
[1:08:26] What have you done? It said guilty.
[1:08:29] Right? It was evidence. Oh, come on. It
[1:08:32] was evidence that he was guilty. But
[1:08:34] this blood that was shed for us, it's
[1:08:37] not an evidence of guilt, but it's an
[1:08:39] evidence of forgiveness. It's an
[1:08:41] evidence of innocence. It's an evidence
[1:08:42] that the price has been paid. It's an
[1:08:44] evidence that things are different now
[1:08:46] than what they used to be. And it's a
[1:08:48] testimony for us in God's courtroom that
[1:08:50] says, "I agree that they are saved. I
[1:08:53] agree." We're not just saying that. We
[1:08:55] believe it because we have the blood of
[1:08:56] the lamb on our side.
[1:09:01] Hallelujah. As the blood of Abel spoke a
[1:09:03] negative testimony, so the blood of
[1:09:05] Christ speaks a positive testimony and
[1:09:07] says you're healed and you're saved. You
[1:09:09] say, "Brother Ben, you're you're too
[1:09:10] positive. You need to you need to deal
[1:09:12] with some things." And you know,
[1:09:14] sometimes we have to deal with some
[1:09:15] things. But let me say this. If you
[1:09:16] could ever recognize that the blood
[1:09:18] speaks for you, if you could ever
[1:09:20] recognize that uh that that the that the
[1:09:22] book is for you. It's not against you.
[1:09:24] The Bible is for you. Brother said, "I
[1:09:26] used to think that God was against me
[1:09:28] and Christ was for me and I found out
[1:09:30] they're the same person. All of heaven
[1:09:32] is for you. And if you could ever accept
[1:09:35] that, you'd dress right, you'd act
[1:09:36] right, you'd live right, because you
[1:09:38] know you'd want to please that one who
[1:09:40] spoke for you."
[1:09:42] Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] Hebrews 12:22 says, and then Paul's gone
[1:09:49] into a little a little statement there.
[1:09:51] He says, "You're not come to uh the law
[1:09:54] and to the to the uh mount of there,
[1:09:57] Mount Orb, where the law was given." He
[1:09:59] said, "But you're coming to Mount Zion,
[1:10:01] and unto the city of the living God, the
[1:10:03] heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable
[1:10:05] company of angels, to the general
[1:10:08] assembly and church of the firstborn,
[1:10:10] which are written in heaven, to God the
[1:10:12] judge of all, to the spirits of just
[1:10:15] men, made perfect." I love that. Made
[1:10:18] perfect. And to Jesus, the mediator of
[1:10:21] the new covenant, to the blood of
[1:10:23] sprinkling, that speaketh better things
[1:10:25] than that of Abel. Better things.
[1:10:28] Brother says, "Abel was a righteous man.
[1:10:30] He died. He died innocent because he was
[1:10:32] in the way." That's what he was called
[1:10:34] in the in the New Testament. That's what
[1:10:36] they called him before they were known
[1:10:37] as Christians. It was just the way. He
[1:10:39] said, "I want to be in the way." Amen.
[1:10:42] In the way of of Christ. He said he was
[1:10:45] in the way. He was in the way. Standing
[1:10:46] for the real revelation he had. He
[1:10:48] spoke. It cried out. The justice blood
[1:10:51] of Abel cried out against Cain. But the
[1:10:53] blood of Jesus Christ not only cried
[1:10:55] out, but it redeemed. Can we? That ought
[1:10:57] to make us excited this morning. If
[1:10:59] there's anything that ought to make us
[1:11:01] happy in the house of God, it's that the
[1:11:03] blood of Jesus spoke for us and it spoke
[1:11:05] better things than than Satan's uh
[1:11:08] Satan's lies against us. It speaks
[1:11:11] better things. It makes you sons and
[1:11:13] daughters. It hides you from the wrath
[1:11:14] of God. See, the blood of Abel could not
[1:11:17] hide Cain, but the blood of Jesus can.
[1:11:20] Listen to me this morning. And if you're
[1:11:22] if you're doubting what what you are and
[1:11:24] where you stand and you think, well,
[1:11:26] maybe you you don't know, well, I don't
[1:11:28] know if I want to be a Christian. I
[1:11:29] don't want know if I want to live like
[1:11:31] that, live according to the word. Why
[1:11:33] don't you come on over here where the
[1:11:34] table is spread and where the the blood
[1:11:37] of Abel couldn't hide Cain, but this
[1:11:39] blood can hide every sin. It can free
[1:11:41] you. Say, you say, "You don't know what
[1:11:42] I've done, but this blood is not limited
[1:11:45] by what you've done. It don't matter
[1:11:47] what you've done. He's able to cleanse
[1:11:48] you." Amen. I realize there's scars in
[1:11:51] our life we can never get past in the
[1:11:53] sense that we can do things that here
[1:11:54] are never right, but it will not be held
[1:11:56] against us there. We will Oh,
[1:11:58] hallelujah. We're going to the same
[1:12:00] heaven as everybody else. Come on. So,
[1:12:03] you might be the rottenest person. You
[1:12:04] might have given up all your chances to
[1:12:06] ever ever stand in the assembly and
[1:12:08] preach the gospel or do something like
[1:12:10] that. People may never trust you again.
[1:12:12] But I'm here to tell you, if you're
[1:12:14] going to heaven, if you've been covered
[1:12:16] by the blood, you're the same as anybody
[1:12:18] else when it comes to the grace of God
[1:12:20] and the blood of God. There's nothing
[1:12:22] against you. All the sin has been wiped
[1:12:25] away. I'm so grateful for that this
[1:12:27] morning.
[1:12:30] We need to start acting like that. We
[1:12:31] need to start treating people like that.
[1:12:33] You're my brother. You're my sister. I
[1:12:35] you know you what you did is is one
[1:12:37] thing, but if you've repented and you're
[1:12:39] living a a life worthy of the gospel,
[1:12:41] let me let me grab a hold of your hand
[1:12:43] and and make you feel welcome in the
[1:12:46] house of God.
[1:12:50] Are you with me now? Again, there's
[1:12:52] things that can affect your life and we
[1:12:54] know that and church discipline and
[1:12:56] things, but when it comes to heaven and
[1:12:58] whether we're going or not, if you're
[1:13:00] saved, you're going as much as I'm
[1:13:01] going. All right? Right? Because the
[1:13:04] same blood, brother Isaac, the same
[1:13:06] blood that speaks for me speaks for you.
[1:13:09] The same blood that come and spoke for
[1:13:12] my family and brought us changed my
[1:13:14] family history. That same blood is
[1:13:16] changing your family history. Changing
[1:13:18] everything about you. That same blood is
[1:13:19] here this morning to do the same thing.
[1:13:26] Hallelujah. Paul tells us by faith
[1:13:28] Abel's blood spoke. By faith Abel
[1:13:30] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:13:31] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[1:13:33] witness that he was righteous God
[1:13:35] testifying of his gifts. Whose gifts?
[1:13:38] Abel's gifts. Right. Abel brought the
[1:13:41] gifts and God testified that what Abel
[1:13:43] brought was right. And by it he being
[1:13:46] dead yet speaketh. Yeah. By faith. Now
[1:13:50] watch. So he testified that Abel's
[1:13:53] sacrifice was correct. Now how does God
[1:13:56] testify? Have you ever thought about
[1:13:57] that? How does God testify?
[1:14:02] And brother Brandham says it very very
[1:14:04] simply. He said the word is the
[1:14:06] testimony of God. Right? You know why we
[1:14:09] call it the Old Testament and the New
[1:14:11] Testament, right? It's the Old Test,
[1:14:16] right? Because a testament is a
[1:14:17] testimony in court, right? That this is
[1:14:20] the will,
[1:14:22] right? That gives the inheritance.
[1:14:25] Hallelujah. So the testament is simply a
[1:14:27] testimony. I've signed many of them in
[1:14:29] my time because I work for an attorney
[1:14:31] and you sign the will and and and
[1:14:33] witnesses sign it because they say this
[1:14:35] is the testimony of the person who died,
[1:14:39] right? The person who died when you go
[1:14:41] to make a will. This is the testimony.
[1:14:43] When I'm dead, I want this to go to him
[1:14:44] and this to go to her and so much to go
[1:14:46] to him and so much to go to her. Don't
[1:14:48] you? He said, "This is my testament,
[1:14:50] right? This is the Old Testament." The
[1:14:52] Old Testimony. And under the Old
[1:14:54] Testament, there was the blood of bulls
[1:14:56] and goats. Under the Old Testament, he
[1:14:58] testified that Abel's sacrifice was
[1:15:00] right. But it was just a shadow of the
[1:15:03] New Testament, which was not a blood
[1:15:06] that could cleanse for a year, not a
[1:15:08] blood that could cleanse for a short
[1:15:09] amount of time, but a blood that could
[1:15:11] cleanse for forever, for eternity. Are
[1:15:13] you with me this morning? A blood that
[1:15:15] was the same yesterday, today, and
[1:15:17] forever. Right.
[1:15:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The the the Old
[1:15:22] Testament, the law was actually called
[1:15:24] the testimony. the testimony. That's
[1:15:27] what it was called. And in Exodus 25:16,
[1:15:30] it says, "Thou shalt put into the ark
[1:15:32] the testimony." So, the testimony has
[1:15:35] got to go into the ark. I'm so glad
[1:15:38] Millie gave that testimony today because
[1:15:40] it fits just right in with what we're
[1:15:42] what we're preaching on. Lord put on my
[1:15:43] heart. So, God's testimony was his
[1:15:47] covenant with Israel. His covenant was
[1:15:50] was confirmed by the blood of animals.
[1:15:52] Hebrews 9:22 tells us there's no
[1:15:54] remission without shedding of blood.
[1:15:56] Abraham's covenant was even confirmed by
[1:15:59] blood. When he said he told God, he
[1:16:00] said, "How will I know this?" We
[1:16:02] preached on it. I won't go back over it
[1:16:04] today. But but Jehovah confirmed by
[1:16:06] blood. Brother said he was making a
[1:16:08] confirmation of the covenant by the shed
[1:16:10] blood of the clean offered to animals.
[1:16:12] It was God's testimony. It's one thing
[1:16:15] for Abraham to testify and say, "I'm a
[1:16:17] child of God. I've been called by God."
[1:16:19] But it was another thing for God to come
[1:16:21] down and testify. Abraham, you're my
[1:16:23] son. Abraham, this is my covenant. I
[1:16:26] will make of you a great nation. God
[1:16:28] testified of his gifts. Listen, he was
[1:16:31] making confirmation of the covenant.
[1:16:33] Brother Brandon again teach us the word
[1:16:35] is God's testimony. It's sealed by blood
[1:16:38] and Jesus is the word. John 1:14 said
[1:16:40] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:16:42] us. He was God's testimony. Listen, he
[1:16:45] was God's testimony of a better
[1:16:47] covenant, a blood that speaks better
[1:16:49] things, right? Why would you want to
[1:16:51] live under the old covenant, the the
[1:16:53] lesser covenant, the worst covenant,
[1:16:57] right? Why would you want to live under
[1:16:58] the law when you could live under grace?
[1:17:00] I've said it many times, but a lot of
[1:17:02] people are trying to live the law
[1:17:03] without a sacrifice. Because if you go
[1:17:06] back and make all the holy days, say,
[1:17:07] "Well, we're going to keep the feast
[1:17:08] days. We're not going to eat bacon.
[1:17:10] We're we're not going to Oh, Lord, what
[1:17:12] a doctrine. We're not going to
[1:17:14] We're we're not going to do this and
[1:17:15] we're not going to do that and we're
[1:17:16] going to we're going to bind the
[1:17:18] fractures on of our garments and and
[1:17:20] bind the law between our face and things
[1:17:22] like that. But don't you realize that
[1:17:23] just spoke of a day when God said, "I'm
[1:17:25] going to bind it to your heart.
[1:17:28] I'm going to put it in your heart. Write
[1:17:29] it in your heart." They said, "I'm going
[1:17:31] to do all of that." But when you get
[1:17:32] done doing all of that, you're living a
[1:17:34] law and you got no sacrifice because
[1:17:36] there's no animal sacrifice in Jerusalem
[1:17:38] today. They've never been able to
[1:17:40] recreate it. But they can't even get a
[1:17:42] red heer. But for you and I, come on
[1:17:44] church. There's a sacrifice made once
[1:17:46] for all. That never diminishes. We're
[1:17:49] not looking at every cow to see if it's
[1:17:51] all completely red.
[1:17:54] Come on, church. That's what they're
[1:17:55] doing. The Jews are over there looking
[1:17:56] at every Keer. They raise them and and
[1:17:58] and they've never been able to produce
[1:18:00] one that was every hair of it was red.
[1:18:02] But I'm here to tell you that the word
[1:18:04] of God produced himself a spotless lamb
[1:18:07] without spot or wrinkle. Hallelujah.
[1:18:10] Examined by Pilate. examined by those
[1:18:12] that were standing there. And yet he
[1:18:14] spoke for us. They never found a fault
[1:18:17] in him because there was no fault in
[1:18:19] him. He was God's testimony of a better
[1:18:22] covenant. When he died on the cross, his
[1:18:24] blood spoke not against us because the
[1:18:27] blood could not speak a different thing
[1:18:29] than the life. Luke 23:34, he said,
[1:18:31] "Father, forgive them. They don't know
[1:18:34] what they're doing." And we have
[1:18:36] forgiveness through the testimony of the
[1:18:38] blood. What does the blood testify
[1:18:41] today? Brother Brown said the blood is
[1:18:43] speaking. Then the blood has got a voice
[1:18:45] and the voice of the blood is the word.
[1:18:47] He said that's what makes it whether
[1:18:48] it's right or wrong. The word is
[1:18:50] identified by the voice of the blood.
[1:18:52] The voice of the blood is the Holy
[1:18:53] Ghost. He said that brings life. It is
[1:18:56] life and it brings life to the word and
[1:18:57] quickens it. Sure. The blood speaks. It
[1:19:00] it's it's not a silent blood. It's a
[1:19:02] speaking blood.
[1:19:04] If we can ever get that revelation, the
[1:19:06] blood is not silent. It's not passive in
[1:19:08] our lives. is active in our lives.
[1:19:11] That's why when you make a mistake, you
[1:19:12] don't have to go get saved again. Why
[1:19:14] you have an advocate with the father?
[1:19:16] Are you with me this morning? The blood
[1:19:18] still speaks for you.
[1:19:20] Yeah. You young people need to recognize
[1:19:22] that. Us old people need to recognize
[1:19:24] that. I don't have to start over again.
[1:19:26] When I make a mistake, the blood speaks
[1:19:28] for me. It spelt for me yesterday. It'll
[1:19:31] speak for me today. It'll speak for me
[1:19:33] tomorrow if there is a tomorrow. The
[1:19:35] blood speaks on my behalf.
[1:19:38] Yeah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm sorry.
[1:19:41] I feel like I'm screaming at you this
[1:19:42] morning, but
[1:19:45] it just stirs my heart. The blood speaks
[1:19:48] it speaks a better thing. The Old
[1:19:49] Testament, the blood spoke of guilt. In
[1:19:51] the New Testament speaks of redemption.
[1:19:53] And the Old Testament spoke of death and
[1:19:54] sorrow. In the New Testament, it speaks
[1:19:56] of resurrection and life. It speaks of
[1:19:58] healing. It speaks of joy. It speaks of
[1:20:00] power. It speaks of life. It speaks of
[1:20:02] heaven. Oh, come on. I know people tell
[1:20:04] you, "Well, we got the blood. The blood
[1:20:06] speaks for us, but there's no joy in
[1:20:08] their step and there's no power in their
[1:20:10] testimony and there's no there's no
[1:20:12] ability to change anything. It's just a
[1:20:14] dead cold form of religion. The blood
[1:20:16] doesn't speak dead things. The blood is
[1:20:18] life. It's the voice of life. The Holy
[1:20:21] Ghost is the voice of a living church, a
[1:20:23] living God. Preach.
[1:20:27] Speaks of heaven. The blood of Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ covers all. Someone say all. All
[1:20:32] of our sins. speaks peace and
[1:20:33] resurrection, power and life and healing
[1:20:36] and all the redemptive blessings that
[1:20:38] the blood was shed for. It speaks for
[1:20:41] us.
[1:20:42] Hallelujah.
[1:20:44] But the testimony of the blood did not
[1:20:47] end because there had to be a word of
[1:20:49] our testimony. Remember, it takes two
[1:20:51] witnesses.
[1:20:52] Right? So, the blood speaks for me, but
[1:20:55] who is the second witness?
[1:20:57] Now, come on, church. The blood speaks
[1:21:00] for me, but I've got to speak. Right.
[1:21:02] And agree with what the blood says.
[1:21:05] Agree with what has been spoken inspired
[1:21:07] by the spirit. Are you with me now?
[1:21:09] That's why I agree with the Bible 100%.
[1:21:11] I agree with the message of the hour
[1:21:13] 100%. Why? Because it's the voice of the
[1:21:15] blood speaking when that becomes
[1:21:17] quickened to me. Hallelujah. The Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost comes in my life. It becomes
[1:21:23] reality in my life. Yes. Amen. The
[1:21:27] testimony of the blood did not end that
[1:21:28] day on Calvary. But when the blood cell
[1:21:30] was broken, it become life.
[1:21:33] Hallelujah. The life of it was released.
[1:21:36] And that's the blood today. Brother
[1:21:37] says, "It's not the chemical of the
[1:21:38] blood, but it's the life of the blood."
[1:21:41] So, we could say it like this. How
[1:21:42] important is the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:44] Ghost?
[1:21:46] Why Why do we want our children to
[1:21:47] receive it? Why do we want our adults to
[1:21:50] receive it? We We must have the baptism
[1:21:52] of the Holy Ghost. If you're not sure,
[1:21:54] I'd be seeking it. If you're or or I
[1:21:56] would be settling that and and making
[1:21:58] sure you got your steak driven down. You
[1:22:00] say, "Well, I didn't have an experience
[1:22:01] like somebody else." But maybe God
[1:22:03] allowed you to have an experience for
[1:22:05] you and and there were many different
[1:22:07] experiences even in the New Testament.
[1:22:09] But I'll say this, it changed their life
[1:22:11] every time. A hundred times out of a
[1:22:13] hundred. It may not always speak with
[1:22:15] tongues. It may not always be in an
[1:22:17] altar. It may not always do that, but it
[1:22:19] will always change your life. That's
[1:22:21] right. And the fruit of it will be seen.
[1:22:23] Amen.
[1:22:25] And but it's the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:22:27] life of the bleeding word that speaks
[1:22:28] forgiveness for you. Brother Brandham
[1:22:31] said the New Testament means new
[1:22:32] covenant. The blood means life. The New
[1:22:34] Testament is the Holy Ghost testim. The
[1:22:35] Holy Ghost giving
[1:22:37] testimony. Oh God, do you realize that
[1:22:41] happens? Our sister gave a testimony
[1:22:43] today. And that that's that's her voice
[1:22:45] giving a testimony. But the Holy Ghost
[1:22:47] has given testimony that what she says
[1:22:49] is true. Now listen to me. I'm going to
[1:22:51] take this somewhere because a real
[1:22:53] testimony she was telling a fact that we
[1:22:55] that doctors have said is true and we
[1:22:57] can see is true because of a baby. But
[1:22:59] what about a testimony we can't see yet?
[1:23:02] Come on church. What about testifying
[1:23:04] when we can't see it yet? And when
[1:23:05] everything that's the moment you got to
[1:23:07] stand and say, "I know he's my healer. I
[1:23:10] know he's my savior. People might laugh
[1:23:12] at me, make fun of me, but I know I'm
[1:23:14] healed. I got a testimony. The blood
[1:23:16] agrees with me."
[1:23:19] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, my family's
[1:23:21] all tore up and there's all kinds of
[1:23:23] stress and strife in the home." Listen,
[1:23:25] you don't have to live like that. The
[1:23:26] blood agrees with me. I can have peace
[1:23:29] in my family. The blood speaks that.
[1:23:33] Speaks better things than the old ways.
[1:23:35] Speaks better things than the abuse of
[1:23:37] the old covenant. But it speaks of life
[1:23:39] and peace and health and love. Are you
[1:23:42] with me now? The old covenant said if a
[1:23:43] man did something to you, you had a
[1:23:44] right to do something to him. But the
[1:23:46] new covenant speaks better things. He
[1:23:48] said, "If a man does something to you,"
[1:23:49] he said, "You give him twice as much as
[1:23:51] he asked for because you're going to be
[1:23:52] recompensed in the end."
[1:23:56] What was it? It speaks better things.
[1:23:59] The life of the bleeding word that
[1:24:00] speaks forgiveness for you. I know
[1:24:02] that's a hard a hard thing. You know, a
[1:24:04] lot of people don't have really a
[1:24:06] problem accepting the message in the
[1:24:07] sense that God sent a prophet, but they
[1:24:09] have a hard time believing making the
[1:24:11] word a reality. And sometimes it's as
[1:24:14] simple as as just forgiving people.
[1:24:18] Just not being a a tattle a tail bearer,
[1:24:21] tattletail, not being a gossip, living
[1:24:24] right and acting right. Why? Because But
[1:24:26] that word will become action in your
[1:24:27] life if you'll let it. He's still alive
[1:24:30] to make the word live in your life. But
[1:24:33] sometimes you got to speak it before you
[1:24:35] see it. Yeah. Oh my. Are you with me
[1:24:38] now? You got to testify, sir. Glory to
[1:24:41] God.
[1:24:44] Oh, I'm so thankful. Look at this. The
[1:24:48] New Testament means new covenant. The
[1:24:50] blood means life. The New Testament is
[1:24:52] the Holy Ghost test. The Holy Ghost
[1:24:53] giving testimony of what Jesus Christ
[1:24:55] has raised from the dead, showing Jesus
[1:24:58] has met every requirement for us and is
[1:25:00] alive today. But the Brennham taught us
[1:25:02] that only those truly filled with the
[1:25:04] Holy Ghost can witness the resurrection.
[1:25:06] That's why Jesus told the disciples in
[1:25:08] Acts 18, he said, "You will become
[1:25:09] witnesses after you receive power to do
[1:25:13] it." Right? You got to have power to
[1:25:15] become witnesses and the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:17] the one that makes you a witness in the
[1:25:18] courts. But the prince said there's two
[1:25:20] kind of witnesses that will stand.
[1:25:21] That's eye or ear. He said now if you're
[1:25:24] sitting in a room and looking through a
[1:25:25] glass and see an accident. So if you're
[1:25:26] way off looking through binoculars, they
[1:25:29] don't accept your testimony because it
[1:25:31] might have changed. But if you were up
[1:25:32] close and saw it, you actually saw it,
[1:25:36] they'll take your testimony. Or if you
[1:25:38] actually heard it, but you had to be, he
[1:25:41] said you had to be close enough. you you
[1:25:42] have to be right there close to really
[1:25:44] know what you're talking about before
[1:25:45] you can be a witness. You have to hear
[1:25:47] it. You have to see it before you can be
[1:25:49] a witness on a severe case in the
[1:25:50] courts. You can't say, "Miss so and so
[1:25:53] told me or Mr. So and so, right? It's
[1:25:56] hearsay." They'll strike it from the
[1:25:58] record. They ain't going ain't going to
[1:25:59] listen to it. Right. Right. They don't
[1:26:01] go by hearsay. He said he's a witness,
[1:26:03] but you're not. So, brother Reverend so
[1:26:05] and so might have the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:07] Brother so and so might they're healing
[1:26:09] brother so and so. You're a witness. But
[1:26:10] you want to be a witness. I want to be a
[1:26:13] witness.
[1:26:15] Well, well, my brother's a preacher. My
[1:26:17] dad's a preacher. My my my grandpa was a
[1:26:20] preacher, and I've got a good family,
[1:26:22] and I know people who go to church, but
[1:26:23] you got to be a witness. That's right.
[1:26:25] Of the resurrection of Christ. He says,
[1:26:28] "So therefore, no man can exactly
[1:26:29] witness to the resurrection of Christ
[1:26:31] only by the Holy Spirit. You have to be
[1:26:34] a personal witness. a personal witness
[1:26:37] yourself, being there, knowing something
[1:26:39] about it, knowing what you're talking
[1:26:41] about. Again, he said, "Not when you
[1:26:42] join the church, you'll be a witness.
[1:26:44] Not when you become a deacon, you'll be
[1:26:46] a witness. Not when you're ordained a
[1:26:47] minister, you shall become a witness.
[1:26:49] But when the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:26:51] you, he said, then you'll be a witness."
[1:26:54] A witness must be someone with an
[1:26:55] experience. Must know something.
[1:26:58] Hallelujah. You realize that's why we
[1:27:00] need healing today. We need to
[1:27:01] experience the power of God today. We
[1:27:03] need to experience. You say, "Well, I
[1:27:04] know what he did through brother
[1:27:05] Brandon, but we need to experience that
[1:27:07] today." Yes. Why? Because we need living
[1:27:09] witnesses,
[1:27:11] right? As someone mentioned to me, I was
[1:27:13] telling brother Andrew Glover, he said,
[1:27:14] you know, he said the the the girl who
[1:27:16] whose eyes were blind there in
[1:27:18] Jonesboro, the story that we hear,
[1:27:20] brother Brandon, according to the
[1:27:21] testimony, Brother Billy Paul, he
[1:27:23] brother Brandon said that he said, "What
[1:27:24] color eyes do you want?" And put them
[1:27:26] eyes, I believe it was in Jonesboro, put
[1:27:28] the eyes back in. And but he told the
[1:27:30] testimony of that girl and he said but
[1:27:32] you know the living witness would be the
[1:27:33] girl. They might have wrote about it in
[1:27:35] the newspaper. They might have they
[1:27:37] might have told about it. Brother
[1:27:38] Brandham told about it but the living
[1:27:39] witness was the girl. I believe we've
[1:27:40] got some living witnesses among us of
[1:27:42] the power of God. We're not just relying
[1:27:44] on a story though. We believe the story
[1:27:46] but those witnesses come together. The
[1:27:48] story of what happened yesterday. We
[1:27:50] believe it because we know what's
[1:27:51] happened today in our lives. Amen.
[1:27:53] Right. Right. Are you with me now? Yeah.
[1:27:58] And so witnessing, I'm kind of getting
[1:28:00] ahead of myself, but witnessing is
[1:28:01] experience is is
[1:28:03] is speaking with the
[1:28:05] blood. So I want to ask you something.
[1:28:08] If you witnessed yesterday, why can't
[1:28:09] you witness today? Come on.
[1:28:12] You say, "But you don't know what I'm
[1:28:13] going through today." But is he not the
[1:28:15] same?
[1:28:16] Is the blood still speaking the same
[1:28:18] thing today as it did yesterday? Yeah.
[1:28:21] Right. But people get down and they say,
[1:28:22] "Well, I can't act in church like I, you
[1:28:24] know, today cuz, you know, I did this or
[1:28:26] that or I messed up or I whatever the
[1:28:29] situation might be, but the blood still
[1:28:31] speaks the same." Amen. Come on, church.
[1:28:35] Well, I don't feel good today, but the
[1:28:36] blood still speaks the same. Let my
[1:28:38] voice agree with the blood in the house
[1:28:40] of God. As they sang earlier, let me say
[1:28:43] amen. When the word of God is preached,
[1:28:45] I'm not agreeing with my feelings. I'm
[1:28:46] not agreeing with what I think. I'm not
[1:28:48] agreeing with my opinion. I'm agreeing
[1:28:50] with the blood of Jesus Christ, the
[1:28:52] blood of the lamb. Let my voice agree
[1:28:54] with the blood.
[1:28:56] Say, well, it doesn't matter if I agree
[1:28:58] or not. It doesn't matter if I'm if I'm
[1:29:00] in the ser if I'm in with the service or
[1:29:01] with it or not. It matters to your kids.
[1:29:05] Matters to your grandkids. It matters to
[1:29:06] your pastor.
[1:29:08] It matters. Brother Brand said ministers
[1:29:10] love to preach in a place where they
[1:29:12] know. He said that people back the word.
[1:29:14] He said because when people backed I'm
[1:29:16] thankful that you backed the word this
[1:29:17] morning. He said ministers love to
[1:29:19] preach in a place like that. He said
[1:29:20] because it's the sound of a rushing
[1:29:22] mighty wind about to fall. Right?
[1:29:25] Hallelujah. It matters to people around
[1:29:27] you. Don't matter whether I say amen or
[1:29:28] raise my hand or whatever you might do.
[1:29:30] You don't have to act crazy. But but
[1:29:32] acknowledge when you acknowledge the
[1:29:34] word is true. What is it? A testimony.
[1:29:36] You're agreeing that that's the blood
[1:29:37] speaking the word.
[1:29:40] Yeah. Brother Brandon said, "You got to
[1:29:42] be an eye or ear witness." You got to
[1:29:45] know something before you can be a
[1:29:46] witness. You got to know something
[1:29:47] before you can be a witness of God. All
[1:29:49] God- called witnesses are people with
[1:29:50] experience of knowing what they're
[1:29:51] speaking about. He said, "We have an
[1:29:54] experience of the witnesses of God in
[1:29:55] Phoenix tonight and all over the world
[1:29:57] are those who has experienced the
[1:29:59] resurrection of Jesus Christ." Oh, can
[1:30:02] you imagine what it must have been like?
[1:30:03] You know, you go to the meetings. Some
[1:30:04] of you all may have been there. I know
[1:30:06] sister brother, sister Curtis were in
[1:30:07] the meetings and I believe they were and
[1:30:09] and some of the other elders have been.
[1:30:11] And I've been my privilege to be around
[1:30:12] many. Maybe we'll talk about a testimony
[1:30:14] later. But but as I think about this,
[1:30:16] what it would have been like to have
[1:30:17] been there and and some of those people
[1:30:19] were healed in previous meetings. And so
[1:30:21] the testimony just kept growing and
[1:30:23] growing and growing. And that's how so
[1:30:25] many people showed up at Jonesboro's
[1:30:26] personal testimony. They didn't
[1:30:28] advertise all over the country, but
[1:30:29] 25,000 people showed up in Jonesboro,
[1:30:31] which was not near as big as it is now.
[1:30:34] And they showed up in Jonesboro for a
[1:30:35] meeting. Why? because people got healed
[1:30:38] and people testified of being healed.
[1:30:41] And so they come to the place where they
[1:30:42] could be healed. And so what happened is
[1:30:45] as you can you can imagine what it must
[1:30:47] have been like. He said all over the
[1:30:49] world and one place brother Brandham
[1:30:50] said that he said he'd just been to the
[1:30:52] world's fair. He said and they had
[1:30:54] exhibits of man's achievement. He said
[1:30:57] but I'm here in the meeting. He said to
[1:30:59] show an exhibit of God's achievement. He
[1:31:01] said a spiritual world's fair.
[1:31:03] Do you ever think of yourselves as an
[1:31:05] exhibit?
[1:31:08] Come on, church. You go in a museum and
[1:31:11] some of y'all agree with me too much.
[1:31:12] You know, everybody's looking at me.
[1:31:16] You ever feel clumsy? I've been that
[1:31:17] way. I just That's just who I am. You
[1:31:19] know, if I can mess something up, I
[1:31:20] will. I was in a meeting one time, a
[1:31:22] men's meeting, you know, and I'm a
[1:31:23] preacher and dignified and everything,
[1:31:24] but we got there late and and first of
[1:31:26] all, lost my keys and uh I had dropped
[1:31:29] them in the back of the van. And so it
[1:31:31] took me about 45 minutes to find my
[1:31:32] keys. And I rushed inside and got my
[1:31:34] room because they about to shut off the
[1:31:35] rooms inside the uh inside the building
[1:31:38] that people were going home and rushed
[1:31:39] inside and got my room and and and got
[1:31:41] in my room and took a shower and left.
[1:31:43] And then uh brother Matt uh he probably
[1:31:45] don't remember this. Brother Matt uh uh
[1:31:48] helped me out uh uh that preached here a
[1:31:51] while back. Watkins. Watkins. Brother
[1:31:54] Matt Watkins. Thank you. He uh he was uh
[1:31:56] he was standing up there in the pulpit
[1:31:58] and he said he said, "Whoever just took
[1:32:00] a shower in someone else's
[1:32:03] room. Please get up because they're
[1:32:05] about to leave and go." Well, there's
[1:32:07] nothing to do. Everybody else is seated.
[1:32:09] I get up and walk
[1:32:11] out. Well, I went down there and they'd
[1:32:13] given me the wrong key, but nobody else
[1:32:15] knew that. They thought I just broke
[1:32:16] into somebody's
[1:32:19] room. Felt like an exhibit. That's where
[1:32:22] I'm going with that. felt like an
[1:32:24] exhibit.
[1:32:26] You ever feel like an exhibit in life,
[1:32:28] but oh church, you are an exhibit.
[1:32:31] You're an exhibit of the love of God,
[1:32:32] Brother Justin. You're an exhibit of the
[1:32:34] mercy of God, what God has done in your
[1:32:36] life. You You're on exhibit to the
[1:32:37] world. You're a testimony at work.
[1:32:39] You're a testimony where you live.
[1:32:41] You're on exhibit. God has placed you on
[1:32:43] exhibit and said, "This is what I can do
[1:32:45] in a life. This is how a life can be
[1:32:47] changed. This is how a life can be
[1:32:49] different." Yes. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:32:52] Brandon said, "You you can only
[1:32:54] experience it by the witness of the Holy
[1:32:55] Spirit." And he said, "How long was it
[1:32:57] to last?" In Acts 2:38, Peter tells us
[1:32:59] this experience was for you and to your
[1:33:01] children to them as far off, even as
[1:33:02] many as our Lord our God shall call. He
[1:33:04] said, "That's how far the witness should
[1:33:06] be. And as long as God calls, God called
[1:33:08] witnesses must have the experience."
[1:33:13] See, the Holy Ghost in us testifies even
[1:33:15] when we don't say a word. Yeah. Right.
[1:33:19] So it's not just testify with our voice.
[1:33:21] Although we do that. I we need to do
[1:33:23] more of that. I've been convicted of
[1:33:26] that recently. We need to do more of our
[1:33:29] tell our testimony a little more. But
[1:33:31] but it's the Holy Ghost in our life that
[1:33:32] testifies.
[1:33:34] Your love for people, the action you
[1:33:36] take with your family and with people
[1:33:37] around you testifies who you are, right?
[1:33:42] Amen. Your reaction to persecution, your
[1:33:46] willingness to testify in spite of it is
[1:33:49] itself a testimony.
[1:33:52] Your reaction to the things that
[1:33:54] preceded the the miracle is in itself a
[1:33:58] testimony.
[1:34:00] Hallelujah. See, if you never went
[1:34:02] through anything, you'd never have any
[1:34:04] testimony. But when you've been through
[1:34:06] something, can somebody witness with me
[1:34:08] this morning? When you've been through
[1:34:09] some things, you got a testimony. Amen.
[1:34:12] You've been you've you've seen some
[1:34:14] things.
[1:34:15] And the Bible says this. He said, "Be
[1:34:17] before all of these," he's talking about
[1:34:19] the end time events that would come. He
[1:34:20] said, "Before all of these, they shall
[1:34:22] lay their hands on you and persecute
[1:34:24] you, delivering you up to the synagogues
[1:34:26] and into prisons and being brought
[1:34:28] before kings and rulers for my name's
[1:34:30] sake. And it shall turn to you for a
[1:34:35] testimony." In other words, it'll be
[1:34:36] favorable to you. It'll be an
[1:34:38] opportunity for you to have a testimony.
[1:34:42] The Greek word for testimony that Paul
[1:34:44] uses when he says you'll overcome by the
[1:34:46] blood of the lamb and the word of your
[1:34:48] testimony is marturion. Marturion, which
[1:34:51] is where we get the word martyr.
[1:34:54] martyr and a martyr. The word mart it
[1:34:58] became the word for someone who died uh
[1:35:00] in service of the Lord and and in and
[1:35:03] and wouldn't give up their testimony
[1:35:05] because it's actually the word
[1:35:07] testimony. A martyr is a testifier. It
[1:35:11] became synonymous with a person giving
[1:35:13] their life for the gospel because at
[1:35:15] that day it was a death sentence to to
[1:35:18] publicly identify as a Christian or to
[1:35:21] bear witness to the power of Christ.
[1:35:23] Let me ask you something this
[1:35:26] morning. If if you you know, some of you
[1:35:28] drive a good distance to to to church.
[1:35:31] If you knew that if you got stopped on
[1:35:35] your way to church and they asked you
[1:35:36] what you were
[1:35:38] doing and you told them you were on your
[1:35:40] way to worship
[1:35:43] God, that that was a death sentence. I
[1:35:47] wonder how many people
[1:35:49] would come to church.
[1:35:53] Boy, it got awful quiet, didn't it? You
[1:35:55] got to think about that, don't you?
[1:35:59] If somehow you got
[1:36:01] stopped, Brother Stewart got stopped,
[1:36:03] it'd be for speeding. But, you know,
[1:36:06] if he got stopped on the way to church,
[1:36:08] I say that because one time when him and
[1:36:10] sister Allison were dating, we're just
[1:36:12] according I I uh he he come to church
[1:36:14] here and I was preaching a youth meeting
[1:36:16] and uh I made an illustration. I said,
[1:36:18] "Like, like, brother Stewart, he
[1:36:19] probably got stopped on the way here."
[1:36:20] And he did.
[1:36:26] So, but what if you got stopped and you
[1:36:29] knew that they found out you were a
[1:36:31] Christian, it was a death sentence.
[1:36:34] Would you still go to church?
[1:36:36] What about our ladies who dress so
[1:36:38] differently from the world? They did
[1:36:39] then, too. If you knew that they figured
[1:36:42] out that you were Christians, did you
[1:36:44] know how many have seen this trend? I
[1:36:46] don't want to get real trendy on you,
[1:36:47] but how many of you seen this trend?
[1:36:48] this chat GPT where they roast a
[1:36:50] picture. Oh, nobody's seen it.
[1:36:54] Yeah. You've seen that, right? Yes. Trip
[1:36:57] and I have had some fun with
[1:36:58] that. And and and you see that and we've
[1:37:01] had some we've had some fun at my
[1:37:03] expense and at Trip's expense, too. He
[1:37:05] don't know about that,
[1:37:06] but but we had uh we roasted pictures or
[1:37:10] they it roasted picture. But you know
[1:37:11] what was funny to me? It knew we were
[1:37:14] Christians.
[1:37:16] AI recognized Yeah, that it looked like
[1:37:19] we were going to church that it looked
[1:37:21] like a Bible study. He kept throwing in
[1:37:23] Christian references.
[1:37:25] I'm sitting there thinking, how would it
[1:37:27] know? We never said the word Christ or
[1:37:29] God or anything like that, but it just
[1:37:30] it just somehow knew. Everything we put
[1:37:32] on there, it knew, you know, you ladies
[1:37:35] dress like Christians. You look like
[1:37:37] Christians. In fact, it knew they were
[1:37:39] homeschooled. So, you know,
[1:37:42] that's but you
[1:37:46] know, there there's just something about
[1:37:48] it there. People can tell what I know
[1:37:50] I'm taking my time, but I I won't be
[1:37:52] long this morning. I promise. But I
[1:37:55] was I was thinking about that. If they
[1:37:57] could tell and you knew that it was a
[1:38:00] death sentence, would you still come?
[1:38:02] They did
[1:38:05] cuz they had an anointing on them, an ox
[1:38:07] anointing that allowed them to be
[1:38:09] overcomers in their age. Listen, there's
[1:38:11] a lot of things we face today. We may
[1:38:12] not face that, but we face a lot of
[1:38:14] persecution and things. But let me
[1:38:15] testify to you this morning. You've been
[1:38:17] anointed in the same manner that they
[1:38:19] were anointed that you can come to the
[1:38:21] house of God in spite of persecution.
[1:38:23] Why? You're a martyr. You're a testimony
[1:38:26] of God's grace. Yes.
[1:38:30] Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:38:32] every week when they would gather
[1:38:33] together and take communion. The act of
[1:38:35] communion
[1:38:37] proved I know people don't want to take
[1:38:39] it every we we're going to have to move
[1:38:41] it would be this next week. We're going
[1:38:42] to have to move that to next month
[1:38:44] because I won't be here next week and
[1:38:46] brother but Joel will be gone too. We're
[1:38:47] going to have it next month. We usually
[1:38:49] do it every other month. But I know
[1:38:50] people don't want to have communion
[1:38:52] hardly at all anymore and that's up to
[1:38:53] each church sovereignly in doing that.
[1:38:55] But for me it's an identification.
[1:38:57] Brother Brand said it was a showdown and
[1:38:59] that early church they took it every
[1:39:00] Sunday. Every time they come together on
[1:39:02] the first day of the week, they took
[1:39:03] communion. And when they did, it was a
[1:39:06] testimony. If a guard had come in and
[1:39:08] saw them taking communion, they they'd
[1:39:10] be called off to death. That's right.
[1:39:12] Yeah. Why? Cuz it identified, right? You
[1:39:16] might have been able to plead if you
[1:39:18] didn't take it and say, "Well, I don't
[1:39:19] take that with them. I'm not one of
[1:39:20] them." You might have been able to plead
[1:39:22] yourself off. I was just here because it
[1:39:23] was a group of people or just here to
[1:39:25] get the food. But if you were taking the
[1:39:26] communion, it identified you as a
[1:39:28] Christian. That's right. Yeah. That's
[1:39:30] why there's no testimony in hiding in
[1:39:32] your house and taking communion by
[1:39:33] yourself and washing your own feet.
[1:39:35] Right. Communion is not just for us
[1:39:38] personally. It's a testimony to the
[1:39:39] world. It's a testimony to the church.
[1:39:42] This is who I am. This is what I belong
[1:39:44] to. Yes. If they could do it, if they
[1:39:47] could gather together, then why can't we
[1:39:49] gather together and take communion and
[1:39:51] love each other and and sing the songs
[1:39:53] of God and not be ashamed of the gospel
[1:39:55] of Jesus Christ?
[1:39:58] This was their testimony. Their
[1:40:00] marterion. That's what they overcame
[1:40:02] Satan's testimony by. Satan come up and
[1:40:05] testified and said, "This was a slave.
[1:40:07] This was a murderer. This was an
[1:40:09] evildoer. This was a liar." Paul says,
[1:40:11] "Such were some of you. This one was a
[1:40:13] was a homosexual. This one was a
[1:40:15] lesbian. This one was this, that, or the
[1:40:17] other. But but the testimony of God
[1:40:19] spoke for them. And when it did, they
[1:40:21] spoke and said, "I'm going to identify
[1:40:23] myself with his testimony." Come on.
[1:40:26] With the testimony of the blood. And
[1:40:29] they loved not their lives. Look at
[1:40:31] that. They loved not their lives.
[1:40:32] Revelation 12:11. To the death. They
[1:40:35] loved not their lives. Oh God. Luke
[1:40:38] 14:26 Jesus said, "If you don't hate
[1:40:40] your own life," he said, "you cannot be
[1:40:42] his disciple." He speaks of mother and
[1:40:44] father and sister and brother. He said,
[1:40:45] "Even your own life." He's talking about
[1:40:47] loving yourself less than the gospel.
[1:40:50] Oh, for a generation of people would
[1:40:52] love themselves less than the gospel.
[1:40:53] That's right. Listen, we testify. Why do
[1:40:56] we testify? We testify because we love
[1:40:58] him more than anything else. And his
[1:41:01] spirit in us testifies we're born again.
[1:41:03] The Bible said the spirit itself beareth
[1:41:05] witness. Amen. You might doubt my
[1:41:07] salvation, but the spirit itself beareth
[1:41:10] witness with our spirit that we're the
[1:41:12] children of God. And that spirit is the
[1:41:14] spirit of truth because it's the spirit
[1:41:16] of the word. 1 John 5:6, this is he that
[1:41:18] came by water and blood, even Jesus
[1:41:20] Christ, not by water only, but by water
[1:41:22] and blood. And it is the spirit that
[1:41:24] beareth witness. It's the spirit that
[1:41:25] testifies because the spirit is truth.
[1:41:29] Hallelujah. What have you overcome,
[1:41:31] church? I want you to understand as
[1:41:34] we're moving along towards the end of
[1:41:35] this sermon. What have you overcome?
[1:41:37] What is your testimony?
[1:41:39] What is your testimony? Your testimony
[1:41:42] is your personal experience of his work
[1:41:46] in your life. So don't tell me you don't
[1:41:49] have a testimony. You might have been
[1:41:51] raised in church, but you still got a
[1:41:53] testimony. I I I told my kids yesterday,
[1:41:56] you guys don't know how good you have
[1:41:57] it. You really don't know how good you
[1:42:00] have it. As long as I've been involved
[1:42:02] in ministry, I realize and from my own
[1:42:03] experience, I know I know things can be
[1:42:06] bad. I know what being poor is like. I
[1:42:08] know what hurting is like. I know what I
[1:42:11] know what family trouble is like. And I
[1:42:13] tell my kids, I know we don't do
[1:42:14] everything perfect, but you live in a
[1:42:16] you live in a good household and you
[1:42:18] raised in the message, but you still got
[1:42:19] a testimony, Brother Peter. You still
[1:42:21] got a testimony. All you young people
[1:42:23] have a testimony of the grace of God in
[1:42:25] your life. It's God's work in your life.
[1:42:27] Whatever that work is, it's your
[1:42:28] personal experience of that work. It's
[1:42:31] like Mary testifying to Elizabeth. When
[1:42:33] Mary, what happened? She said, "Be it
[1:42:35] unto me according to thy word." There
[1:42:36] was no sensation at that moment, right?
[1:42:39] Yeah. Remember when she received it, she
[1:42:41] received the word. She said, "Be it unto
[1:42:42] me with no sensation."
[1:42:45] But then as as the baby
[1:42:47] grew there, there come a sensation
[1:42:49] because there something changed her. Are
[1:42:52] you with me now? But but now what does
[1:42:54] she do with no sensation? She runs to
[1:42:56] Elizabeth and she goes and tells
[1:42:58] Elizabeth and she said, "Oh my," she
[1:43:00] said, "Elizabeth," she said, "this is
[1:43:02] what the word says." She began to
[1:43:03] testify to her. And when she testified,
[1:43:06] the spirit of God testified in the womb
[1:43:08] of Elizabeth. A little baby named John
[1:43:11] that was dead in the womb came to life
[1:43:13] when Jesus name was mentioned. What
[1:43:15] could your testimony do this morning? A
[1:43:17] child of God might come to life because
[1:43:19] of your testimony of what he's done in
[1:43:21] your life. Yes, sir.
[1:43:24] The trouble of Brother said people get
[1:43:26] saved today and they think, well, maybe
[1:43:27] I better keep still. My neighbor don't
[1:43:29] believe in this. You, he said, you never
[1:43:30] really got saved. I don't believe. No,
[1:43:32] sir. You can't hold it. You said, 'Th
[1:43:34] That's right. So, well, I'm afraid to
[1:43:35] testify of healing. Afraid the doctor
[1:43:37] won't like it, brother. If you got
[1:43:38] healed, you'll testify about it. Amen.
[1:43:40] Don't hold it. Tell it. Tell it out to
[1:43:42] somebody else. You overcome by the blood
[1:43:45] of the lamb and your testimony. That's
[1:43:46] how you overcome. What are you
[1:43:48] testifying? You're testifying he's alive
[1:43:50] and his word is true. He said when the
[1:43:52] inspiration of the Holy Spirit is here
[1:43:54] to inspire you. Remember, he said God
[1:43:56] will make your body come into your
[1:43:58] confession. Oh yes, sir. Hallelujah. So
[1:44:02] you say, "Well, brother Ben, I don't
[1:44:03] want to testify anything that isn't
[1:44:05] true." But we got to remember what's
[1:44:07] true.
[1:44:09] The spirit is true. The word is true.
[1:44:12] That's right. Right. Your feelings
[1:44:14] aren't true.
[1:44:16] Your thoughts about the matter aren't
[1:44:17] necessarily true unless they line up
[1:44:19] with the word. So we testify according
[1:44:22] to this standard, not according to our
[1:44:24] feelings, but according to the voice of
[1:44:26] the blood. So, Brother Brandon said,
[1:44:29] "God will make your body come into your
[1:44:32] confession." I'm confessing skinniness
[1:44:34] right now. Amen. Praise
[1:44:40] God. Gabe, your shirt tail was out this
[1:44:42] morning and I I identify with that. It's
[1:44:45] difficult. You get that middle-aged
[1:44:47] spread. Keep a shirt tail
[1:44:49] in. Now, I've called you out to
[1:44:51] everybody. Just so comfortable here
[1:44:53] preaching to y'all, I just feel like I'm
[1:44:55] talking oneon-one to all of you. I
[1:44:57] appreciate you making me feel that way.
[1:45:00] Listen, you got your body's got to come
[1:45:01] into your confession. If you say you're
[1:45:04] a drunkard and want to drink, said,
[1:45:05] "Don't worry. You'll soon be one."
[1:45:08] That's right. If you say you're a sinner
[1:45:09] and want to sin, you'll be right into
[1:45:12] it.
[1:45:14] Oh my. If you say you're a Christian and
[1:45:17] believe it all along, your testimony
[1:45:20] will bring you right into it.
[1:45:23] Listen to me, church. Some of y'all, I
[1:45:25] know you face tough decisions and
[1:45:26] things, but what you need to do is have
[1:45:28] a testimony. This is what's going to
[1:45:29] happen in my life. This is what I
[1:45:31] believe God's going to put me where he
[1:45:32] wants me. He's going to have me in the
[1:45:34] job he wants me in. He's going to have
[1:45:35] me in the place he wants me in. He's
[1:45:37] going to have me with the right person
[1:45:39] or the right husband or the right wife.
[1:45:40] And I'm going to speak my testimony. And
[1:45:42] then I'm going to walk right into my
[1:45:44] testimony. I'm going to speak that I
[1:45:47] believe there's one there for me. And
[1:45:48] I'm going to walk into that. I'm going
[1:45:50] to speak that my body's going to be
[1:45:51] healed. I'm going to walk into that.
[1:45:52] Yes.
[1:45:54] Amen. Your testimony will bring you
[1:45:57] right into it. If you believe in healing
[1:45:58] and believe that God has healed you,
[1:46:00] confess it. And God will make your body
[1:46:02] obey your confession. For he's the high
[1:46:04] priest of your confession, sitting at
[1:46:06] the right hand of the father now with
[1:46:07] his own blood to make intercession for
[1:46:09] any confession upon anything that he
[1:46:11] died for. Oh, do you believe that,
[1:46:13] church? Somebody ought to testify today
[1:46:16] that he's a healer. Because when you
[1:46:17] testify of it, your body begins to obey
[1:46:20] your testimony.
[1:46:22] Glory to
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:24] God. Brother Bill, I thought you weren't
[1:46:27] here. I see you sitting there in the
[1:46:28] back. That body's obeying your
[1:46:30] testimony. He's testifying. He felt good
[1:46:32] and his body's fixing to obey it. I was
[1:46:35] I had a dream the other night, and I
[1:46:37] don't dream spiritual dreams, but I just
[1:46:39] just dream all the time. And I I dreamed
[1:46:41] the other night. I was standing here
[1:46:42] preaching, and it was the it was the day
[1:46:45] of your procedure. I dreamed it was the
[1:46:46] day of your procedure. And I looked down
[1:46:48] there and there's Brother Bill in the
[1:46:50] front row. And I said, 'Brother Bill,
[1:46:52] what are you doing in church? And he's
[1:46:54] holding that where they that heart and
[1:46:56] he said, 'Oh, I just had to be here,
[1:46:58] brother. That's because that's kind of
[1:47:00] attitude that he has. What is that? A
[1:47:02] testimony. And your body is going to
[1:47:04] obey it. If it doesn't do it here,
[1:47:06] there's another body waiting.
[1:47:10] Glory to God. A better covenant, better
[1:47:12] things. Right.
[1:47:15] Very good. Your testimony will bring you
[1:47:17] right into it. If you believe in
[1:47:18] healing, believe that God has healed
[1:47:20] you. Confess it and God will make your
[1:47:21] body obey your confession. For he's the
[1:47:23] high priest of your confession, sitting
[1:47:24] at the right hand of the father now with
[1:47:26] his own blood to make intercession for
[1:47:28] any confession upon anything that he
[1:47:31] died for. When you confess one of the
[1:47:33] promises of God, he makes intercession
[1:47:35] on your confession. Why? You're the
[1:47:38] second testifier.
[1:47:40] Are you with me? You're the second
[1:47:41] witness.
[1:47:43] Nothing could be
[1:47:45] established. Oh, I hope you hear me,
[1:47:46] church. You're waiting on God to do
[1:47:48] something. God has already done
[1:47:50] something. But nothing can be
[1:47:52] established without your testimony.
[1:47:56] So the problem is not with the blood of
[1:47:58] the lamb. He's already testified. He's
[1:48:01] speaking for you. The problem is with
[1:48:03] our testimony if there is one. Right? I
[1:48:06] say, "Lord, let me be a testimony. Let
[1:48:08] me have a testimony. Let me speak a
[1:48:11] testimony." When you testify, what are
[1:48:12] you doing? You're yielding yourself to
[1:48:13] the word of God. You can completely
[1:48:15] submit yourself to the Holy Ghost. But
[1:48:16] the B said, "And no affliction can hold
[1:48:18] you.
[1:48:20] Hallelujah. Again, he said in the next
[1:48:22] paragraph, you that's sinful that maybe
[1:48:24] drink and smoke and gamble and do things
[1:48:25] like that. You say, "I can't give them
[1:48:26] up, Brother Brandon." Yes, you can.
[1:48:31] Yes, you can. I'm not speaking wrong.
[1:48:34] I'm saying what the Bible says. Saying
[1:48:36] what the blood said. The blood said you
[1:48:38] can. Yes. The doctor may say you can.
[1:48:41] You may say you can. You may feel like
[1:48:42] you can, but he said yes, you can. You
[1:48:45] just submit yourself to God one time.
[1:48:46] Just yield your whole self to God and
[1:48:48] watch what takes place. That's the whole
[1:48:50] thing. There's no secret in it. It's not
[1:48:52] a hocus pocus. He said the only thing is
[1:48:55] submit yourself to God. Again, he said
[1:48:58] just some people are ashamed after they
[1:48:59] accept the Lord Jesus as savior. They go
[1:49:00] out and they're ashamed to confess him.
[1:49:02] Many times they accept him as their
[1:49:03] healer and they go out and they're
[1:49:04] ashamed to confess him. You should never
[1:49:06] be ashamed of him. You should be right
[1:49:08] up no matter what takes place. You
[1:49:09] should be right up in front to stand on
[1:49:11] your testimony. Stand on what Sister
[1:49:14] Millie was doing this morning. stand on
[1:49:16] your you say, "Well, the devil will
[1:49:17] attack me if I if I stand on my
[1:49:18] testimony." I'm going to stand on it
[1:49:20] anyway because I know greater is he that
[1:49:22] is in me than he that is in the world.
[1:49:24] The verdict's already been given. I'm
[1:49:26] free. Yes, sir. I've been delivered. I'm
[1:49:29] Hallelujah. I've been to the court. I've
[1:49:31] been judged by God's by God's grace. He
[1:49:34] said he said, "There is no sin in you.
[1:49:36] You're by your stripes, you're healed."
[1:49:38] He said those things about me and I
[1:49:39] agree with what he said. Yes, sir.
[1:49:44] Mine is a concurring
[1:49:45] opinion. Hallelujah.
[1:49:48] Hallelujah. That his opinion about me is
[1:49:51] right. Yes, sir. Listen.
[1:49:54] Brother said, "God can only save you as
[1:49:56] you
[1:49:57] testify." Are you still with me? He can
[1:50:00] only heal you as you testify. He is
[1:50:03] sitting at the right hand of the father
[1:50:04] tonight to make intercession upon your
[1:50:06] profession. It isn't how loud you cry,
[1:50:08] how hard you beat the altar, how many
[1:50:10] good deeds you do. It's your faith that
[1:50:11] saves you. Amen. And if you'll confess
[1:50:13] it with your lips and coming from your
[1:50:15] heart, he goes to work as a high priest
[1:50:17] sitting at the right hand of the father
[1:50:18] to make intercession upon your
[1:50:21] confession.
[1:50:23] See, when you testify according to his
[1:50:24] word, he will make the word of your
[1:50:26] testimony true.
[1:50:29] That's good.
[1:50:32] And let me confess something to you.
[1:50:35] I've had a difficult time testifying
[1:50:38] about things because a lot of times I
[1:50:40] feel like I'm bragging and I I'm just
[1:50:42] not that kind of person. Now I'm
[1:50:43] bragging about that. I'm even
[1:50:45] self-conscious about saying that. But
[1:50:46] y'all know me. I I just I don't like to
[1:50:49] do that. I don't like putting myself up
[1:50:51] front. I don't like to do that. But our
[1:50:53] testimony is not of oursel. It's of him.
[1:50:57] The Brandon says we're not saved by
[1:50:58] works. What we do. It ain't what I done
[1:50:59] that saved me. It's what Christ done
[1:51:00] that saved me. I have no holiness. If I
[1:51:03] try to say, "Well, I quit drinking. I
[1:51:04] quit smoking. I quit stealing, lying, so
[1:51:06] forth. That's what I done. That would be
[1:51:07] my own. That's something to brag about.
[1:51:09] I didn't quit nothing. He just come to
[1:51:11] me and took it out of me. That's it.
[1:51:12] Ain't what I done. It's what he done.
[1:51:14] And then the Holy Spirit then abides in
[1:51:16] and grows daily. He said just grows
[1:51:18] making itself greater and greater.
[1:51:20] Pushes out the things. Oh, I said God
[1:51:22] push out the things, the cares, the
[1:51:24] temptation. He said as you overcome
[1:51:26] them, the Holy Spirit takes his place.
[1:51:28] Young people, look at me for a minute.
[1:51:29] Look at me for just a minute. I want you
[1:51:31] to pay attention to this because it's
[1:51:32] important. He said, 'You know what? If
[1:51:34] you got a real bad temptation of
[1:51:37] something that's not
[1:51:39] right now, I don't know how many times
[1:51:41] you get tempted, but you know, I know
[1:51:43] your parents keep you in in a place
[1:51:44] where you temptation is far from you,
[1:51:47] but there's a temptation to talk back to
[1:51:49] your parents.
[1:51:50] And right,
[1:51:54] Melody, she looked so convicted in that
[1:51:57] moment. Temptation to play that music
[1:51:59] loud when dad don't want you to.
[1:52:02] Yeah, music temptation to she listens to
[1:52:06] gospel music, but it ain't my kind of
[1:52:07] gospel
[1:52:09] music. But she uh you know there's a
[1:52:12] temptation to do things aren't right.
[1:52:13] Isn't that right? Listen to what brother
[1:52:15] Brandham says. It's very important. You
[1:52:16] young men, it's very important or older,
[1:52:18] young people. It's very important. Yeah.
[1:52:19] He said overcome that thing a few times.
[1:52:22] Yeah. See, the thing is, you've never
[1:52:24] stood up to it. But if you'd stand up to
[1:52:27] it one time, the next time be a little
[1:52:29] easier. Amen. Yeah. Right. What you're
[1:52:32] doing is every time you make a mistake,
[1:52:34] you're trying to go back and get
[1:52:34] resaved. You don't need to get resaved.
[1:52:36] The blood speaks for you.
[1:52:39] You need to overcome. You need a
[1:52:40] testimony. Yeah. So, the devil's going
[1:52:42] to tempt you. That's his job. Right. So,
[1:52:45] he's going to come try to make you do
[1:52:46] something that God don't want you to do.
[1:52:47] So, what does he do? What what happens?
[1:52:50] The blood speaks for you. So, you say,
[1:52:52] "No, devil." Right? Boo devil. Somebody
[1:52:55] say it with me this morning. Boo devil.
[1:52:58] And what happens when you do that? He he
[1:53:00] goes away from you and gets smaller and
[1:53:01] smaller. Is that right? Overcome the
[1:53:04] thing a few times and watch if your
[1:53:06] testimony doesn't bloom
[1:53:10] on account of it. That's what I want to
[1:53:12] see with our young people as they go to
[1:53:14] camp and different places and we have
[1:53:16] youth services for them. I want to see
[1:53:17] your testimonies bloom. How is that
[1:53:20] going to happen? Every time the devil
[1:53:21] tries to make you fall asleep in church,
[1:53:23] every time the devil tries to make you
[1:53:25] act wrong, every time the devil tries to
[1:53:27] say, "Well, when I turn 18, I'm going to
[1:53:28] go." You just say boo to that devil.
[1:53:30] Defeat that devil. Time the devil tries
[1:53:32] to make you depressed. Say food to that
[1:53:34] devil. And when you overcome a few
[1:53:36] times, your testimony begins to bloom.
[1:53:39] Amen. Truth. Hallelujah.
[1:53:43] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham taught us I
[1:53:46] don't have time to go through all of
[1:53:47] this, but he taught us I'm going to skip
[1:53:48] down about three paragraphs. He taught
[1:53:50] us in in a meeting, he said, "I'm not
[1:53:52] against shouting. I'm not against
[1:53:53] speaking in tongues." He said, 'But do
[1:53:54] that when when you receive when you
[1:53:56] believe that you've received something
[1:53:58] from God. He said, "Come reverently. Be
[1:54:00] reverent." And he said, "If out in the
[1:54:01] media at any time, at any
[1:54:05] time you feel that God has spoke to your
[1:54:09] heart." Amen. While this line is going
[1:54:12] through, then you raise your hands.
[1:54:15] That's right.
[1:54:18] Can't talk us out of prayer lines, can
[1:54:20] you, brother Gabe?
[1:54:23] You say, "Well, it don't do nothing."
[1:54:24] Tell that somebody you got healed. Come
[1:54:27] on. Laying hands on the sick don't
[1:54:28] matter. Tell somebody got healed.
[1:54:31] God still don't save people. Tell
[1:54:33] somebody got saved that.
[1:54:35] Hallelujah. He said when you go through
[1:54:37] the line, he said then you he said when
[1:54:40] when when it's on your heart when God
[1:54:42] spoke to your heart then you raise your
[1:54:43] hand say thank you Lord Jesus for
[1:54:45] healing me then tell somebody sitting by
[1:54:48] you on that next go then tell somebody
[1:54:51] sitting by you. Yeah yeah brother
[1:54:53] Brandham it's church order. But he said
[1:54:57] hallelujah. Well how do you do that
[1:54:58] church? By rejoicing and worshiping in
[1:55:01] the house of God. You're telling
[1:55:02] somebody sitting by you by the blood of
[1:55:04] the lamb and their testimony they
[1:55:05] overcome. You overcome by the blood of
[1:55:07] the lamb and by your testimony. Said if
[1:55:09] we can just have faith and believe in
[1:55:11] the Lord God that he will do these
[1:55:12] things for us. How many believe it this
[1:55:14] morning when you know it? You testify of
[1:55:16] it even if the symptoms are still there.
[1:55:19] Even if it hasn't happened yet, you
[1:55:21] testify of it like Abraham. We're going
[1:55:22] to have a baby and he walked into it one
[1:55:24] day. He said, "What do you do? What is
[1:55:27] your testimony? What do you do when
[1:55:28] you're giving a witness? What are you
[1:55:29] doing when you're testifying?" He said,
[1:55:31] "You're saying the same thing. You're
[1:55:33] saying like if you was in a court and
[1:55:34] said, "I seen a certain certain thing."
[1:55:36] He said, "You have to tell it the same
[1:55:38] way. When I say I'm healed, I mean I'm
[1:55:40] testifying exactly what God said. By his
[1:55:42] stripes, I was healed."
[1:55:45] God will test that testimony.
[1:55:49] You remember the woman that made Elijah
[1:55:50] a cake? Yeah. God spoke to her. Elijah
[1:55:54] spoke to her, which was to her. She had
[1:55:56] to accept that as God speaking to her
[1:55:58] through Elijah, through a man.
[1:56:02] And and when when Elijah spoke to her,
[1:56:05] he said, "Oh, I bring me a drink of
[1:56:07] water." She turned around and go get him
[1:56:10] a drink of water. And he said, "Make me
[1:56:11] a cake." She said, "I don't have enough.
[1:56:14] I've only got enough for me and my boy,
[1:56:16] and then we're going to
[1:56:17] die." He said, "Make me a cake." But
[1:56:21] when she goes to do it, see, that was
[1:56:23] the test. Yeah. Was she willing to do
[1:56:26] what God said no matter what it looked
[1:56:28] like. No matter if it looked like it
[1:56:29] hastened her own death. What was it? She
[1:56:31] loved not her own life until the death.
[1:56:34] And she heard the voice of the prophet
[1:56:36] speaking again. He said, "Thus sayaeth
[1:56:38] the Lord. The the crucal oil won't fail.
[1:56:41] The meal won't dry up. Nothing none of
[1:56:43] that will run out. You'll still have
[1:56:45] supplies to make cakes." Hallelujah.
[1:56:48] He's still that kind of provider today.
[1:56:50] If you're in need this morning,
[1:56:52] financial need or whatever it is, he's
[1:56:54] still that kind of provider.
[1:56:58] Our widows here in the church, God still
[1:56:59] cares about you. Don't forget, he's
[1:57:02] still that kind of provider.
[1:57:05] He said, and he said, when you're put
[1:57:07] under a test, when you're fixing to be
[1:57:08] used for God for a testimony, he said,
[1:57:11] like this lady here in the wheelchair,
[1:57:12] the man, the little boy, some of you
[1:57:13] people out there, maybe you're
[1:57:14] Christians and wonder why you're put
[1:57:16] under this test. He said, "God is fixing
[1:57:19] to use your testimony. Why did you go
[1:57:22] through what you went through?" Because
[1:57:23] God, hallelujah, was fixing to use your
[1:57:26] testimony. But he wants to know to see
[1:57:29] how you'll react. So, he puts the
[1:57:31] pressure on. And he says it's in those
[1:57:33] great crucial moments that the strain is
[1:57:35] put on us that God moves in. When we
[1:57:37] make a decision for him that's between
[1:57:39] life and death, that little sharp edge.
[1:57:41] Sometimes at the last moment when you
[1:57:43] think you're not going to be well and
[1:57:44] somebody's making fun of you, you still
[1:57:46] hold your testimony. It's that time that
[1:57:48] God moves in. Brother Brandham told us
[1:57:49] to be fearless in our testimony. Be
[1:57:51] fearless in your testimony. If it's
[1:57:52] revealed to you, you are fearless.
[1:57:55] I'm thankful for testimonies today.
[1:57:59] As we close, I I read Daniel chapter 4.
[1:58:01] He said, "I thought it good to show the
[1:58:03] signs and wonders that the high God has
[1:58:05] wrought toward me." Right? How great are
[1:58:07] his signs. How mighty are his wonders.
[1:58:09] His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.
[1:58:11] His dominion is from generation. Yes,
[1:58:13] sir. To generation. So this generation
[1:58:17] I I I read this quote to you many times.
[1:58:19] I'll just put it up on the board. That
[1:58:21] next quote, Sister Brown was a a
[1:58:24] testimony in my life in a future home of
[1:58:27] the heavenly earth heavenly bridegroom
[1:58:29] and the earthly bride. Brother Brown
[1:58:30] speaks to a lady who had never met him
[1:58:32] was sitting in the back. He said m he
[1:58:34] said, "Miss Brown, Mrs. Brown, believe
[1:58:36] with all your heart Jesus Christ to make
[1:58:38] you well." He said, "You're a stranger
[1:58:40] to me, but God knows you." That stuck in
[1:58:41] my heart because God knew how to read
[1:58:43] articles later on. and news said brother
[1:58:46] well brother Brandon was reading prayer
[1:58:47] cards but I knew that lady I knew she
[1:58:49] didn't have one
[1:58:51] right a testimony mattered to me so my
[1:58:53] faith wouldn't be shaken are you with me
[1:58:55] now some of y'all have similar
[1:58:57] experiences God has placed us in an area
[1:58:59] with testimonies like that I'm thankful
[1:59:01] for that testimony made a difference in
[1:59:03] my life and I'm encouraging you this
[1:59:05] morning your testimony will make a
[1:59:06] difference in somebody else's life there
[1:59:09] was I I think of the testimony of my
[1:59:11] parents and grandparents I believe if I
[1:59:13] don't get mixed up in the story. I
[1:59:15] believe it was because someone had a
[1:59:16] there was a a person who had sold honey
[1:59:18] to brother Brandham that lived in Kansas
[1:59:20] City, Missouri. I may have told you this
[1:59:22] before. And they they they lived there
[1:59:25] and uh my uh grandfather, I believe it
[1:59:28] was, went to my mom's dad went to that
[1:59:32] house and bought honey from them. And in
[1:59:35] that house, they had a picture of the
[1:59:36] pillar of fire. You say, "Well, that
[1:59:38] picture is just idolatry." Well, it
[1:59:40] wasn't in that case cuz it's the only
[1:59:42] reason that we're in the message.
[1:59:45] Somebody was bold enough to testify of
[1:59:47] it. They hung it on their wall. They
[1:59:49] weren't even message believers, but they
[1:59:51] just honored what God had done. And and
[1:59:54] my grandpa caught a hold of that. He
[1:59:55] never did fully accept it or understand
[1:59:57] it. But he told my dad about it. My dad
[2:00:00] never did fully accepted
[2:00:02] or But these things will be told from
[2:00:04] generation to generation.
[2:00:07] Hallelujah. And finally, in our
[2:00:09] generation, brother Joel, somebody
[2:00:11] grabbed a hold of it. Glory to God. My
[2:00:14] mom's grabbed a hold of it. My brother,
[2:00:16] my sister grabbed a hold of it. I think
[2:00:18] there'll be more. Grab a hold of it.
[2:00:20] Why? Because it's not a fiction story.
[2:00:22] But somebody was willing to testify, God
[2:00:25] is real in my generation. He's the same
[2:00:27] yesterday, today, and forever. He does
[2:00:29] not fail. Hallelujah.
[2:00:33] Hallelujah. Amen. I think of the
[2:00:36] testimonies in this church, and I'll
[2:00:37] close. I said that four or five times.
[2:00:38] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, brother Bill, but
[2:00:42] I just have to say these things. I think
[2:00:44] of testimonies. I got to thinking about
[2:00:45] a testimony of different ones. And
[2:00:48] Brother Bill's a testimony this morning.
[2:00:50] I believe God's healed him in healing
[2:00:51] him again. Brother Danny Ward was
[2:00:53] healed. I believe of prostate cancer. I
[2:00:55] know the doctors assisted in that. But I
[2:00:57] believe, Brother Danny, that that was
[2:00:58] God that healed you. I know your wife
[2:01:00] was healed of cancer as
[2:01:02] well. Brother Harold Bailey come and
[2:01:04] told me the other night. He said he had
[2:01:06] leukemia. He was diagnosed with leukemia
[2:01:08] and and he come and told me he said they
[2:01:09] said my do my numbers are almost exactly
[2:01:11] back to normal again. Thank God for that
[2:01:13] brother Harold. That's a
[2:01:16] testimony. I I told you the other night,
[2:01:18] brother Harvey Savage shouldn't be here.
[2:01:21] He could testify this morning he
[2:01:22] shouldn't be here because of what
[2:01:23] happened in his body. And I remember
[2:01:25] when brother Harvey was so sick and
[2:01:27] seemed like the people were praying
[2:01:28] because brother Harvey was about to
[2:01:30] leave us and Lord knows, Lord knew I
[2:01:32] needed him and this church needed him.
[2:01:33] And so he kept him here on the face of
[2:01:35] the earth. And what was it? It's a
[2:01:37] testimony today. God's still a
[2:01:43] healer. I know, sister. You're concerned
[2:01:47] about the numbers for Glorella, but
[2:01:48] she's a testimony that God's a healer
[2:01:50] because she's here this morning with a
[2:01:52] liver transplant, but she's
[2:01:55] here. Doctors can't heal. God heals.
[2:01:59] Sister Virginia pro. My sister-in-law
[2:02:01] was sitting was in a meeting and got
[2:02:02] prayed for of a food allergy. I believe
[2:02:04] that it was and and she was completely
[2:02:06] healed of that and able to eat whatever
[2:02:08] she wants now. And and and we're
[2:02:10] thankful for
[2:02:11] that. You've already heard brother Gabe
[2:02:14] and Sister Millie who the doctor said
[2:02:16] you won't have children two for two
[2:02:17] different reasons. But God was a
[2:02:20] testimony in their
[2:02:21] favor. That child is a miracle this
[2:02:24] morning.
[2:02:27] Brother Trip sat down at the table with
[2:02:28] me the other night. I'm not bragging,
[2:02:31] church. I just want to He sat down
[2:02:32] across from me at the table at my house
[2:02:34] and he said it's been three years today.
[2:02:36] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:39] It was three years since he'd been
[2:02:40] baptized. I think that day was three
[2:02:42] years since they'd come back to the
[2:02:46] Lord. I I believe I believe that was the
[2:02:49] day Sister Maddie was baptized that same
[2:02:51] day. And they weren't I don't think we
[2:02:53] had plans for them to be baptized, but
[2:02:54] that day I preached on baptism because
[2:02:56] sister Maddie was baptized. I wanted the
[2:02:58] children to be able to understand that
[2:02:59] and God convicted their hearts and and
[2:03:02] they come and were baptized and their
[2:03:03] lives have been changed. And I can
[2:03:05] testify for brother Trip that his life
[2:03:06] has been changed. And Sister Stephanie
[2:03:08] that her life has been changed. It's not
[2:03:10] the same anymore. God did that. If he
[2:03:12] can do it for them, he can do it for you
[2:03:14] this
[2:03:16] morning. Sister Pat, I always overlook
[2:03:19] you sitting there on the back, Sister
[2:03:20] Pat Grimes. But you weren't in church
[2:03:22] when I came here. You'd been out of
[2:03:23] church for a while, but God is doing
[2:03:25] something in your life and continues to
[2:03:27] and she longs to be in the house of the
[2:03:29] Lord. Sister Stephanie sitting over
[2:03:30] here, I hate to point you out and
[2:03:32] embarrass you, but Sister Stephanie, I
[2:03:33] watched her come to give her heart to
[2:03:35] the Lord and things have changed in her
[2:03:37] life. And I believe that it'll just keep
[2:03:38] blossoming and blossoming and we've seen
[2:03:41] God do that. If he can do it for them,
[2:03:42] what about all the rest of our children?
[2:03:44] What about all the rest of our our our
[2:03:46] families?
[2:03:49] I've watched our young men. I watch our
[2:03:50] our ministers and and uh I watch God
[2:03:53] work for the Price family. I'll just
[2:03:55] mention that today. God has done a
[2:03:57] miracle in their family in healing and
[2:03:59] help. And I believe that that's a
[2:04:00] miracle that God is working in in that
[2:04:02] family. I I I I've watched our ministry
[2:04:06] here and in and brother Joel, brother
[2:04:08] Joel come out of a different background
[2:04:10] and didn't believe many of the things
[2:04:11] that we believe and now he's a he's a
[2:04:13] forceful minister of the gospel. I was
[2:04:15] sitting there listening to him the other
[2:04:16] night preach the very things that a few
[2:04:18] years ago we argued about. But but but
[2:04:20] what happened? God got a hold of him. I
[2:04:22] didn't get a hold of him, but God got a
[2:04:23] hold of
[2:04:24] him. Brother Stewart has blossomed as a
[2:04:27] preacher. We've seen God get a hold of
[2:04:29] him and and just preach the gospel. And
[2:04:30] I thank God he'll be preaching next
[2:04:32] Sunday morning. I thank God for that. We
[2:04:34] ought to see a testimony in that.
[2:04:36] Listen, this church is a testimony. I
[2:04:39] know I may have left many out, but this
[2:04:40] church, come on, church, you're a
[2:04:42] testimony. Our young people are a
[2:04:44] testimony that God is still the same.
[2:04:46] Listen to me, Lanny. You're a testimony
[2:04:48] this morning that God can help and God
[2:04:50] can change. God can put a desire in your
[2:04:52] heart. Jaden, you're a testimony. God
[2:04:54] can put a desire for the message of the
[2:04:56] hour in your heart. You just let that
[2:04:57] burn in your heart. You're a testimony
[2:05:00] today of what God does. I say don't give
[2:05:02] up your testimony. You can say, "Through
[2:05:04] many dangers, come on musicians, through
[2:05:06] many dangerous toils, and snares, I have
[2:05:08] already come. This grace that brought me
[2:05:11] safe thus far, and grace will lead me
[2:05:13] home." I may want to testify this
[2:05:14] morning of the goodness of God. Let's
[2:05:16] just stand to our feet and and talk to
[2:05:18] him for a minute. Heavenly Father, we
[2:05:20] love you. Oh, we thank you this morning.
[2:05:22] We we we thank you for what you've done
[2:05:24] in our lives. We thank you for changing
[2:05:27] us, Lord. I thank you for me and for my
[2:05:29] wife and for my family. I thank you,
[2:05:31] Lord, what you how you've changed us and
[2:05:33] how you've blossomed our testimony. I
[2:05:35] thank you for that, Lord. Oh, God. We
[2:05:37] don't want to ever fail or let you down,
[2:05:39] but we know you spoke for us, Lord. If
[2:05:41] we want to speak for you, I pray you'd
[2:05:43] grant it, Lord. If there's one here,
[2:05:45] Lord, that doesn't have a testimony,
[2:05:47] Lord, to have grace in their life, I
[2:05:49] pray they would receive that grace this
[2:05:51] morning and they'd be willing to to
[2:05:53] follow and surrender themselves to it,
[2:05:55] Lord, that they too can be a testimony
[2:05:57] of the grace of God. I thank you for
[2:05:59] this church. I thank you for for making
[2:06:01] a testimony out of it when it should
[2:06:03] have been an ash sheep on the side of
[2:06:04] the road. And it could have been that,
[2:06:06] but Lord, you brought a testimony out of
[2:06:08] it. And I'm so thankful. I thank you,
[2:06:11] Lord. I thank you, Lord, for your grace.
[2:06:15] I thank you for your mercy. I thank you
[2:06:17] for goodness and love. Oh, we love you,
[2:06:20] Lord Jesus. I pray you'd continue to
[2:06:22] move. Lord, I know there's many
[2:06:24] testimonies we left out for take a time.
[2:06:26] But Lord, I know you're a healer. We've
[2:06:28] seen enough. You said by the mouth of
[2:06:29] two or three witnesses, let everything
[2:06:31] be established. We've seen enough to
[2:06:33] believe that you are real. We thank you
[2:06:35] for it in Jesus name. If you need
[2:06:37] prayer, the altar's open. Let's just
[2:06:39] worship him this morning. Hallelujah.
[2:06:42] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:06:46] Oh, sing with me. Oh, we ought to be
[2:06:49] able to sing with him this morning. Is

[2:07:41] hide and trembles at his

[2:08:34] end, beginning and the end.
