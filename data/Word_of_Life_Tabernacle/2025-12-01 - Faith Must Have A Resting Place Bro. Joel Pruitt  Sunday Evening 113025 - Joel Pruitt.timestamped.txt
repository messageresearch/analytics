[12:51] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[12:55] There have been times
[12:56] [singing and music]
[12:56] I didn't know right from wrong.
[13:04] But in every situation,
[13:08] God gave [music and singing] blessed
[13:09] consolation
[13:12] that my trials only [singing]

[15:03] and I thank him [singing] for [music]
[15:05] the valleys.
[15:07] I thank him for the storms he's
[15:10] [singing] brought me through.
[15:15] For if I've never had a problem, [music]
[15:19] I wouldn't know that [singing] God could
[15:22] solve it. I never [music] know what
[15:26] faith in God can. Just raise your hands

[20:11] I don't have any written requests
[20:13] tonight, [music] but we've got a a bunch
[20:15] of needs in the church. Got several that
[20:18] are [music] sick and battling different
[20:20] uh things.
[20:22] Sister uh Sister Alice battling cancer
[20:25] and brother Robert with heart disease
[20:28] that he's been battling. [music] I think
[20:30] he goes in tomorrow.
[20:32] Brother Wes has a court case tomorrow.
[20:34] Praying for brother Wes and his mother
[20:35] as [music] well with her needs in her
[20:38] body. I know there's many others I'm not
[20:40] thinking of, but we believe [music] in a
[20:42] prayer answering God. And he he's always
[20:45] on time. It might seem late for us, but
[20:48] he's always on time. We got so many
[20:50] missing tonight. In fact, most of the
[20:51] church appreciate some of you visitors
[20:53] showing up, but it's good to be in the
[20:56] house of the Lord anyway. [music] We're
[20:57] just going to bind together and pray and
[20:59] believe that God meet these needs. I
[21:02] spoke to Brother Robbie Jones last night
[21:04] and Sister Betty is not doing well at
[21:05] all either. And we just need to really
[21:07] be praying for her and just believing
[21:10] for all of these that are sick. Let's
[21:12] bow our heads together. Maybe you've got
[21:13] a a need you'd like to make known by way
[21:15] of uplifted hand. God sees every need.
[21:17] He knows every heart. [music] Heavenly

[21:21] presence once again and to thank you for
[21:24] your goodness, Lord, on us. Thank you
[21:26] for your grace, Lord. [music]
[21:28] Thank you, Lord, that you chose us and
[21:30] you called us, Lord. Though we may be
[21:32] few in number, but you said we're two or
[21:34] three are gathered together, I will be
[21:36] in the midst. And we believe that today,
[21:38] God. I pray that you'd meet our needs. I
[21:41] pray especially for these that are sick.
[21:43] Lord, the doctors maybe have done all
[21:46] that they can do, but we're believing
[21:47] for a miracle. Lord, I pray that you'd
[21:50] move for our elders. Father, Brother
[21:52] Bill as well going in for surgery this
[21:54] week. I I pray that you'd move, God. I
[21:57] pray that you'd strengthen their bodies.
[21:59] I pray that you'd guide the doctor's
[22:01] hand, do a miracle, Lord, in their
[22:03] lives. I pray you'd grant it tonight.
[22:05] [music] Lord, I pray that you'd bless
[22:07] the preaching of your word. As brother
[22:09] Joel preaches tonight, I pray that you'd
[22:11] just open up our hearts to receive.
[22:14] Lord, we can have an upper room
[22:16] experience [music] in this service.
[22:17] Lord, pray that you'd grant it. May your
[22:19] word be manifested in our lives. We give
[22:22] you all the praise and the glory and the
[22:24] honor in Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
[22:28] bless you.

[35:21] name I know. [singing]
[35:23] I'll tell [music] it. I'll tell it.
[35:26] Wherever I go, I [singing] came [music]
[35:29] to glorify.
[35:32] glorify
[35:35] your name.
[35:38] Is that what you came to do tonight? I
[35:40] wonder if we just bow our heads together
[35:41] and go to the Lord in a word of prayer.
[35:43] If you have a need on your heart this
[35:44] evening, I wonder if you just slip a
[35:46] hand up to him. Heavenly Father, as we
[35:48] come this evening, Lord, to approach
[35:50] [music] your word, we ask, Lord, that
[35:52] you would just meet with us this
[35:53] evening, Lord, and just speak to our
[35:55] hearts. Lord, I ask you wouldn't let me
[35:58] say [music] anything that would be out
[35:59] of order, Lord. But I pray you would
[36:00] just move me to say the things that are
[36:02] needful to this congregation here
[36:04] tonight. And Lord, [music] I ask, Lord,
[36:06] you would just, Lord, just bless the
[36:08] hearer now, Lord. May the word that goes
[36:10] forth, may [music] it just be something,
[36:11] Lord, that would be directly, Lord, to a
[36:13] need in their lives. And Lord, we ask,
[36:15] Lord, that this wouldn't be just another
[36:17] service, Lord. But [music] we ask you
[36:18] would come by in a special way now,
[36:19] Lord, and meet with each and every one
[36:21] of us. Lord, I pray you would just bind
[36:22] my lips, Lord, to [music] speak only
[36:24] what you would have me to speak. In the
[36:26] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask
[36:27] all these things. And the bride says,
[36:29] [music] "Amen." Amen. Are you happy to
[36:32] be in church tonight? If you have your
[36:34] Bibles this evening, if you would uh
[36:37] turn to cha James chapter 2, James
[36:40] chapter 2 and verse 19. James 2 and 19.
[36:46] I mean, I know it's right after
[36:47] Thanksgiving and and uh so I won't
[36:50] preach too long. Some of you are in a
[36:52] turkey coma still and uh I'm getting out
[36:56] of it myself.
[36:58] It's that uh binge eating you do on
[37:00] Thanksgiving. It ain't it ain't good few
[37:02] days afterwards, don't seems like. But
[37:05] Amen. Hope hope uh I text a brother the
[37:08] other day and he said, "Don't preach on
[37:09] gluttony this weekend." [snorts]
[37:11] And so I won't. Amen. And if I had a a
[37:14] text tonight, it would be faith must
[37:17] have a resting place. How many believes
[37:20] that tonight?
[37:21] &gt;&gt; In James 2 and chap and verse 19 says,
[37:23] "Thou believest that there is one God
[37:26] and thou doest well. The devils also
[37:29] believe and tremble." And you may be
[37:31] seated. May the Lord add his blessings
[37:33] to the word tonight. And we'll read
[37:35] while you have your Bibles there. Mark
[37:37] chapter 9 and verse 17. Mark 9 and 17.
[37:41] And one of the multitude answered and
[37:43] said un said, Master, I have brought
[37:45] unto thee my son, which hath a dumb
[37:47] spirit, and wheresoever he taketh him,
[37:50] he teareth him, and he foamth and
[37:51] nashethth with his teeth, and pineth
[37:53] away. And I spake to thy disciples that
[37:56] they should cast him out. And they could
[37:58] not. And he answerth him, and saith, Oh
[37:59] faithless generation, how long shall I
[38:01] be with you? How long shall I suffer
[38:03] you? Bring him unto me. And they brought
[38:05] him unto him. And when he saw him,
[38:08] straightway the spirit tear him, and he
[38:09] fell on the ground, and wallowed
[38:11] foaming. And he asked his father, "How
[38:13] long is it ago since this came unto
[38:15] him?" And he said, "Of a child." And of
[38:17] times it hath cast him into the fire and
[38:19] into the waters to destroy him. But if
[38:21] thou can't do anything, have compassion
[38:23] on us and help us. And Jesus said unto
[38:26] him, "If thou can't believe, all things
[38:29] are possible to him that believeth." Can
[38:32] you say amen here tonight? And he said
[38:35] straightway the father of the child
[38:37] cried out and saith with tears, Lord, I
[38:40] believe. Help thou mine unbelief. Amen.
[38:43] That's the cry of many of us here
[38:45] tonight. Amen. I believe, but Lord, help
[38:47] thou mine unbelief. And in James, we'll
[38:49] go back to James 2 and go down to verse
[38:51] 14. And it says it like this. What do it
[38:54] profit my brethren? Though a man say he
[38:56] hath faith and have not works, can faith
[38:58] save him? If a brother or sister be
[39:00] naked and destitute of daily food, and
[39:02] one of you say unto them, "Depart in
[39:03] peace, be ye warmed and filled,
[39:05] notwithstanding you give them not those
[39:07] things which are needful to the body,"
[39:09] what does it profit? And even so, faith,
[39:11] if it hath not works, is dead being
[39:14] alone. So, we find that your faith has
[39:16] got to have a resting place. Faith has
[39:18] got to have a place, amen, that it can
[39:20] come back to. Faith is not something you
[39:22] can't you can't say, "Well, I have faith
[39:23] in something that doesn't exist."
[39:25] Because you you know, as a human being,
[39:27] we we're we have senses. We have a a
[39:30] see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. And
[39:31] and all of those senses are are proof to
[39:34] us that something exists. I can look at
[39:37] something and I can believe that it's
[39:38] real. I can feel something and I believe
[39:40] it's real. I can taste it and I can say
[39:42] that turkey was good. And I can, you
[39:44] know, there's so many things. Amen.
[39:46] There there senses that we go by as a
[39:49] human. And yet none of those things are
[39:51] really what we go by as a as a Christian
[39:54] because uh feelings can lie to you. And
[39:57] you know, you can see something and it
[39:58] may not be just the way that you think
[40:00] it is. And you know, you can you can
[40:02] misjudge a situation because you think
[40:04] it's a certain way and you were seeing
[40:06] the situation, but you don't know what's
[40:08] in the heart. And so many times we have
[40:11] we have found ourselves that we don't
[40:13] have faith in the right resting place.
[40:16] Amen. But if you go back to where Jesus
[40:18] uh tells Peter, amen, upon the rock of
[40:21] revelation is where he would build his
[40:22] church and the gates of hell would not
[40:24] prevail. It was because Jesus said, "Who
[40:26] do you say that I am?" He said, he said
[40:28] uh he said, "Thou art the Christ, the
[40:30] son of the living God." And he said,
[40:32] "That is the revelation." Brother
[40:33] Brandham calls it a rock of revelation.
[40:35] It is actually faith. It is where
[40:37] everything would be built upon was the
[40:39] revelation of who he is. And so then if
[40:42] you know who he is, then you can have
[40:45] faith in who you are. Can you say amen
[40:47] here tonight? And so, Brother Brandon
[40:48] would say it like this. Faith is not
[40:50] based upon the shifting sands of man's
[40:52] ideas. So it's not built upon your
[40:54] opinion or my opinion. It is not built
[40:56] upon what you think the message said or
[40:58] what I think the message said. Amen. But
[41:00] it's got to go back to what the word
[41:01] actually says. And so, Brother Brandon
[41:03] would go on. He said, "I come here and
[41:05] told you there was an angel." He said,
[41:07] "If I told you there was an angel here
[41:09] in the building and these things
[41:10] happening, if I didn't have something to
[41:12] prove that to you, you'd have a right to
[41:14] doubt it." Sure you would. He said, "If
[41:16] I said God gave a gift to do a certain
[41:18] thing and you seen it come right back
[41:20] around and fail, you'd say that's wrong.
[41:22] But when it comes back and God proves it
[41:24] every time to be perfect, then that's
[41:25] right." He said, "God has proved it."
[41:28] Faith has to have a resting place. Amen.
[41:31] We could we could look at this message
[41:33] and if it was just the message that
[41:34] came, you could you could believe it if
[41:36] you went back to the word and checked it
[41:37] out. Amen. But something had to get your
[41:39] attention so that faith would have a
[41:41] resting place. Are you still with me
[41:43] here tonight? Amen. That's why a prophet
[41:45] would say, he said, I'm standing here
[41:46] and he said, but there's got to be
[41:48] something to prove and to vindicate the
[41:50] message that it is true.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it wasn't brother Brandham
[41:54] standing standing there saying just
[41:56] believe me. Just believe me. It'll be
[41:57] all right. Just believe what I say. No,
[41:59] what he was telling you was, look, it's
[42:00] not me. It's him coming here. He's doing
[42:03] the works. Now, you can believe me to be
[42:05] his prophet.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. But we had he
[42:08] had to have faith in something in order
[42:10] to get the people to believe. And he
[42:12] said, "If he said, if I can get the
[42:14] people to believe me, then nothing can
[42:16] stand in the way." Amen. But there has
[42:18] to be a way and there has to be a
[42:20] faithbuing thing, something to get your
[42:23] rest, your faith to rest on. And so,
[42:25] brother going like this. He said, he
[42:26] said, "If you're going to get married,
[42:27] some of you young men or women, if
[42:29] you're going to get married, you got to
[42:30] have faith in one another." Now, Brother
[42:31] Ram deals with that. Amen. Because if
[42:33] you really don't believe in that person,
[42:35] then you should never marry that person.
[42:36] Amen. If you don't believe in each
[42:38] other, if you don't believe in the
[42:39] people in the church, if you don't
[42:40] believe in your pastor, he can't help
[42:42] you. There's got to be faith. Listen,
[42:44] church, I understand we fail each other
[42:46] every day. I understand that men will
[42:48] fail you. Amen. But you do have to put a
[42:50] certain element of faith in people
[42:52] &gt;&gt; because your p you got to have a pastor.
[42:54] And to have a pastor, you have to put
[42:56] faith in a man. And if you if you have a
[42:58] wife, you you have to put faith in that
[43:00] woman. And if you you women, if you have
[43:01] a husband, you've got to put faith in
[43:03] that man. Amen. If God puts you
[43:04] together, you got to have faith in them.
[43:06] Though they may fail you, you've got TO
[43:08] PUT YOUR FAITH there because you've
[43:10] chosen them. You believe that they would
[43:12] be what God has for you. And so, Brother
[43:14] Rain would go on like this. He said,
[43:15] "Now, the only solid resting place for
[43:18] faith is on God's word." word. And so
[43:20] when I say a marriage has faith, I want
[43:23] you to notice that the faith actually
[43:24] comes by whatsoever God hath joined
[43:26] together, let no man put us under. So if
[43:29] your marriage is based on the word, you
[43:31] can have faith in it. If your marriage
[43:33] is based on, listen, if I if you if you
[43:36] don't yoke yourself with an unbeliever,
[43:38] then you can have faith in your
[43:39] marriage. If you don't yoke yourself to
[43:41] the world, then you can have faith in
[43:43] your experience. Are you with me here
[43:45] tonight? Amen. God did not want you,
[43:47] amen, to go outside of his word because
[43:49] outside of his word, there's no faith
[43:51] found. But if you come under subjection
[43:54] to the word, then you can have faith in
[43:57] the word that has been given to you.
[43:58] Brother R would say it like this. He
[44:00] said, he said, he said, the only solid
[44:02] rock of any faith that anybody wants to
[44:04] have in the supernatural, it must be
[44:06] placed first in the word of the living
[44:08] God. He said now it's been through all
[44:10] the ages how the men of old and all the
[44:12] ages when they would rally and find
[44:13] really find the word of God and when
[44:15] grasp it faith went into action right
[44:17] away. He said look at Noah way back in
[44:18] Genesis when God spoke to Noah that day
[44:20] the word of God came to Noah and he told
[44:22] him to build an ark for the saving of
[44:24] his household. He said you know the
[44:25] world stood upright before theian
[44:27] destruction
[44:28] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't leaning back like this to
[44:30] bring water. And when God told Noah he
[44:32] was going to send a flood, he said,
[44:34] "Now, you know, he had critics, but
[44:36] faith doesn't look what the
[44:37] circumstances is. Faith looks to what
[44:39] God says. Faith don't try to reason.
[44:41] Faith just takes it at its face value."
[44:44] He said, "Now, there's two different
[44:45] kinds what we call faith today." And he
[44:47] said, "I'm sorry to say this to my
[44:48] audience tonight." He said, "But I'm
[44:50] real sure of this, that there's too much
[44:52] intellectual faith instead of being
[44:54] heart faith." Come on, church. Amen.
[44:56] There's too much of I think it might be
[44:57] right or I think it could be this way.
[44:59] No, you got to get it on your heart and
[45:00] then you can rest your soul on it. Amen.
[45:02] Because if it's a heart faith, then you
[45:04] believe from the heart and none of these
[45:06] things will move you upon the rock of
[45:08] revelation and the faith that is in your
[45:10] heart. Amen. None of these things will
[45:12] move you. It is a rock of revelation
[45:14] that the word that has been given you is
[45:16] right.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; And so if the rock of revelation is
[45:19] there, it is a place that your faith can
[45:22] rest on. Are you with me now tonight? He
[45:25] said, I'm sorry to say this. Amen. But
[45:27] there's too much intellectual faith.
[45:28] Brother goes on. He said, "There's so
[45:29] many revivals going across the country
[45:31] and people are claiming to be saved and
[45:32] great evangelists saying they had so
[45:34] many thousands saved and so forth." He
[45:36] said, "Well, if you go back," he said
[45:37] that they they've got an emotion in the
[45:39] meeting and they're worked away. He
[45:40] said, "Many people in the meeting raise
[45:42] up and claim healing or walk away more
[45:44] emotion or more by psychic than they do
[45:47] by real divine revelation of the Lord
[45:49] Jesus." And the first little pain
[45:51] strikes them, they give up and say,
[45:52] "Well, I didn't get my healing." He
[45:54] said, "Now, if you really believe that
[45:56] with your heart, 10,000 pains would
[45:58] never make you give it up." He said,
[46:00] "Cuz your faith is already went into
[46:02] motion, you're in action, right?" Then,
[46:04] can you say, "Amen." Amen. If you really
[46:06] believe with your heart, it don't matter
[46:07] what the symptoms are on Monday morning.
[46:09] It don't matter, Amen. what the doctor's
[46:11] report is. Can you say, "Amen." Amen.
[46:13] You say, "Well, I I just don't feel
[46:15] saved." Well, you don't have to feel
[46:16] saved, amen, to believe that the
[46:18] experience you had WITH GOD IS REAL. YOU
[46:20] DON'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE YOU GOT HEALED
[46:21] TO KNOW THAT BY HIS STRIPES WE ARE
[46:24] HEALED. THAT'S THE RESTING place of YOUR
[46:26] FAITH. IT'S NOT ON YOUR FEELINGS. IT'S
[46:28] NOT ON YOUR EMOTION. IT'S NOT ON A
[46:29] SENSATION. BUT IT IS ALWAYS ON THE WORD
[46:31] OF GOD.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight? Amen. Brother
[46:34] Brand would say it like this. He goes on
[46:36] down. He said, "When God spoke to Noah,
[46:37] he told him the impossible. There was no
[46:40] rain. Never had rained. It never was a
[46:41] cloud in the sky or anything else. But
[46:43] Noah knew that it was going to rain
[46:45] because God said so." I wonder if we had
[46:47] some Noah in the building here tonight.
[46:49] Amen. That could say, "We don't really
[46:50] care what we feel like. We don't care
[46:52] what's going on around us, but God said
[46:54] so." And if God said so, we're going to
[46:56] stand against every critic and against
[46:58] every person that says it ain't going to
[46:59] happen. There's not going to be a
[47:00] rapture. The message ain't right. This,
[47:02] that, or the other. Amen. We can stand
[47:03] in the face of the critics and just keep
[47:05] on building the ark that God has called
[47:07] us to build.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Brother would go on like this. He said
[47:09] he was considered a fanatic. He was
[47:11] considered a little crazy. He said, "I
[47:13] suppose in this day a real fanatic and
[47:15] almost always are. When you find people
[47:16] that'll dare to take God at his word,
[47:18] they're considered neurotics or
[47:20] fanatics. That's right. The real true
[47:22] believer has never had the world to pat
[47:23] him on the back, it's always been
[47:25] against him because he takes God at his
[47:28] word. How about you here tonight? He
[47:30] said God has never been a friend of the
[47:31] world in the way of the world being a
[47:32] friend of God. He said they're against
[47:34] God because they can't understand God.
[47:36] And you'll never know God only by faith.
[47:38] Can the church say amen? Brother Random
[47:41] goes on like this. He said now he said
[47:42] there'll never be uh he said no matter
[47:44] how much science comb the globe and said
[47:47] there'll never be clouds up there's no
[47:48] rain to come down if God's word said
[47:51] that it's going to rain it's up to God
[47:53] to make a way for the rain if God said
[47:55] so that settles it now where I'm going
[47:57] here tonight amen is there is an
[47:59] authority in the word and whatever the
[48:01] word says is right no matter what your
[48:03] opinion of the word is can you say amen
[48:06] faith has got to have a resting place
[48:07] that is beyond your feelings that is
[48:09] beyond your emotion is beyond what you
[48:11] think you understand of the message.
[48:13] Faith is always resting in the word. Can
[48:16] you say amen? Brother, I'm going to go
[48:18] on like this. He said, "Now, this little
[48:20] group here ought to do tonight is take
[48:21] God for what he says. Don't make no
[48:23] difference how it looks. Don't reason
[48:25] it. You've only got intellectual faith.
[48:26] You'll reason God's word. You'll try to
[48:28] reason and say, "Now, let me see. Now,
[48:30] the doctor said I can't get well. If the
[48:32] doctor said so, that ought to settle."
[48:33] That's the reason faith don't reason. He
[48:35] said, "That's the reason. Faith don't
[48:37] reason.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Faith believes it anyhow. Faith believes
[48:41] even if the doctor says you can't make
[48:43] it another day. Faith believes when you
[48:45] said, "Amen, the doctor will say you're
[48:47] full OF CANCER AND THE DOCTOR SAID MAYBE
[48:49] YOU'VE GOT SIX MONTHS to live." AMEN.
[48:51] BUT I'M SO GLAD TO KNOW THAT MY GOD HAS
[48:53] THE FINAL SAY. AMEN. It's not up to what
[48:55] the doctor say. Listen, church, I
[48:57] believe in doctors and he's given you an
[48:59] exact medical opinion. Amen. But I WANT
[49:01] TO GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU SOMETHING. The
[49:02] word has always been greater than a
[49:04] doctor's report. The word has ALWAYS
[49:07] BEEN GREATER THAN YOUR FEELINGS. THE
[49:08] WORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN greater than church
[49:10] trouble. The word has always BEEN
[49:12] GREATER THAN WHAT YOU'RE going through
[49:13] right now. The word has brought you
[49:15] through to where you ARE TODAY. AND THE
[49:17] word is where you can rest all of your
[49:19] faith.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight? Brother
[49:22] Brandham said it like this. If you just
[49:23] got a mental conception of the Bible,
[49:25] you say, "Well, I believe it because I
[49:27] read it." God's got to reveal it to you
[49:29] by your heart.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I read the Bible every day. If you
[49:33] just read it and let it become a dead
[49:34] letter to you, then then that's all
[49:36] it'll ever be. But if the spirit ever
[49:38] quickens the word to you, amen, that it
[49:40] will actually reveal the hidden parts in
[49:42] the Bible by the prophet messenger that
[49:45] came in our day. Now, I want you to
[49:47] notice, you can't have it unless it
[49:49] comes through a prophet first.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Amen. He reveals nothing
[49:53] until he reveals it first to his
[49:55] prophets. And so we believe in our day,
[49:58] amen, that if you you could take
[49:59] somebody in the world, you could take a
[50:00] a nominal Christian as good as they
[50:02] might be that could read their Bible and
[50:04] pray every day. Amen. But if they have
[50:06] not come in contact, amen, with the
[50:07] message of the hour, they'll never see
[50:09] the opening of the word that has been
[50:12] open to our hour. They can see the
[50:14] Bible. They can read the Bible. And they
[50:16] can read the book of Revelations. It'll
[50:17] remain a book of symbols to them. I
[50:19] mean, they can read about faith. And
[50:20] it's just a it's an action that happened
[50:22] maybe 2,000 years ago. Amen. They can
[50:24] say, "Well, this is how we should have
[50:26] church." BUT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW REALLY
[50:27] HOW TO HAVE CHURCH LIKE THE APOSTLES
[50:29] DID. AND BUT WE HAD A PROPHET THAT came
[50:31] and opened the seals to us. Amen. The
[50:33] seals were loosed off the book and we
[50:35] could see where faith really is. And we
[50:38] could see where the book was open to us.
[50:40] And we could SEE WHERE THE HOLY GHOST
[50:41] WOULD come into the believer and how it
[50:43] would act and what IT WOULD DO. COME ON,
[50:44] CHURCH. We are the only ones that have a
[50:46] reason to shout and worship. WHY?
[50:48] BECAUSE GOD HAS COME AND SHOWED US what
[50:51] faith is. is resting in his revealed
[50:54] word of the hour.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not re It's not resting in a
[50:58] in a historical God. It's not resting,
[51:00] Amen, just in a in a story that
[51:02] happened, but it's resting in a living
[51:04] God because the word is God. If the word
[51:07] was God, it still is God. And so our our
[51:10] our faith is resting in God, which is
[51:13] the word that has been revealed to us.
[51:15] Now, it can't just be a a revealing in
[51:17] the head, but it's got to be a heart
[51:19] revelation. Are you with me so far?
[51:21] Brother Brandham says like this. If a
[51:23] man really believes it from his heart,
[51:24] he's not afraid to put it to a test. He
[51:27] said, "If you're just mentally, you'll
[51:29] reason it out." Say, "Well, I couldn't
[51:30] do that. I might do it this way. Might
[51:32] have done this. Might have." He said, "I
[51:34] might have got well, but I don't know
[51:36] about myself." But if you've really
[51:38] based your faith on God's eternal word,
[51:40] and it's down in your heart, all devils
[51:42] out of torment can't upset you.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; What can you say, amen, tonight? All
[51:46] devils out of torment can't even upset
[51:48] you. Are you are you seeing where I'm
[51:51] going here? Amen. The rock of revelation
[51:53] and the faith that you have is built
[51:55] upon that. Then all the devils in hell
[51:57] can never shake that revelation that is
[52:00] in your soul. Amen. You you CAN BE
[52:02] TALKED OUT OF BELIEVING SOMETHING IF YOU
[52:03] SEE IT with your mind. You can be you
[52:05] you can change your mind. Amen. But God
[52:07] does not change his word. And so if it's
[52:09] been revealed to you, then if it ever
[52:11] was true, it always will be true.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God did not give you God did
[52:16] not give you a revelation and then
[52:18] change the revelation. If God gave you a
[52:20] revelation, it is an eternal revelation.
[52:24] God does not give you an revelation of
[52:25] one day and say, "Well, here's a
[52:27] revelation of going to church and
[52:28] tomorrow he changes that." No sir. Amen.
[52:30] The Bible is the ultimate. The Bible was
[52:33] the brother Brandham's absolute. Amen.
[52:35] And he came and opened that word to us.
[52:37] And I'll say it like this. The message
[52:38] is absolutely my absolute. Amen. It is
[52:41] where my faith is tied to. It is what my
[52:44] faith is RESTING ON. AND THEN WHY?
[52:46] Because he didn't go write his own Bible
[52:48] or make a Book of Mormon, but he
[52:50] actually took the Bible and opened it to
[52:52] US AND TIED UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS. It
[52:54] wasn't a new message, BUT IT WAS THE OLD
[52:56] GOSPEL THAT WAS OPEN TO THE people of
[52:59] this day. I want you to hear me tonight,
[53:01] church, for the next few minutes. Faith
[53:03] is not built upon A HISTORICAL GOD.
[53:05] FAITH IS NOT BUILT UPON just a book, but
[53:08] faith is built upon the the the author
[53:10] of the book. Amen. And that is where our
[53:12] faith can sit. I mean, IT CAN BE PLACED
[53:14] SOLID ON THE RESTING PLACE. I MEAN, THE
[53:16] rock of revelation. Brother Brandon
[53:18] would say it like this. He said, "No,
[53:19] sir. You've got to stay there." He said,
[53:21] "Oh, in the eternal word, you've got to
[53:23] stay there. I know what I speak of
[53:25] because I've seen it and I put it to the
[53:27] test myself and I know that it's true."
[53:29] Why would I stand here on the platform
[53:31] at any night and challenge an audience
[53:32] of thousands, stood in Bombay, India,
[53:34] and 500,000 people and challenged them.
[53:36] 17 different religions come to the
[53:38] platform to show me one visible sign of
[53:40] a supernatural being and stood right in
[53:42] the midst of the atheists and
[53:43] unbelievers and witch doctors and
[53:45] everything else standing out there by
[53:47] the dozens trying to spew throw a spell
[53:49] on me and challenged a blind man. He
[53:51] said and God gave his sight right there
[53:53] and turned the whole thing around. Why?
[53:55] God said he would do it and that's all.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham did not it wasn't
[54:00] how brother Brandham felt. It wasn't how
[54:02] brother Brandham thought. Can I open
[54:03] this blind man eyes? NO. IF GOD comes on
[54:06] the scene, then God can do the
[54:08] impossible. He He He's talking about
[54:10] Noah back there and he said God could do
[54:12] the impossible by the word that he spoke
[54:15] to Noah. I want you to notice that when
[54:17] Moses heard the voice of God in the
[54:18] bush. Amen. It was it WAS IT WAS
[54:21] IMPOSSIBLE TO SOMEONE WHO HAD NOT HEARD
[54:22] THE VOICE OF GOD, BUT BECAUSE HE HEARD
[54:24] THE VOICE, then he had SOMETHING TO REST
[54:26] HIS FAITH UPON. Come on, somebody.
[54:28] Anybody else would have said, "Well, I
[54:30] was out in the wilderness and and a
[54:32] prophet told me that they heard a voice
[54:34] and he's going to and I guess I'm going
[54:36] to go down and take over." No, sir. It
[54:38] had to be someone who was so sure of the
[54:40] vindication that they actually saw it
[54:42] themselves. Amen. A prophet would come
[54:44] and he would leave this dimension and go
[54:47] into look into another dimension and
[54:49] actually see things and he could come
[54:51] back and show us and he had faith in it.
[54:53] Why? Because he was there.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Now, you could say, "Well, I wasn't
[54:57] there." BUT THEN HE SHOWED YOU WITH HIS
[54:59] BACK TO THE AUDIENCE and he said, "Now I
[55:01] in this day, this is what was fulfilled
[55:03] in the scripture." Come on, church. DO
[55:05] YOU NOT REALIZE THAT WE HAVE THINGS WE
[55:07] CAN SEE? We can actually place our faith
[55:09] in this message. It's not something we
[55:11] WERE TOLD ABOUT, BUT IT'S something we
[55:13] can see and we can HEAR AND WE CAN PLACE
[55:15] OUR FAITH IN IT. WHY? BECAUSE NOW IT IS
[55:17] NOT JUST ON TAPE, BUT THE REVELATION IS
[55:20] IN THE HEART OF THE BELIEVER.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; SEE, the revelation when it was just on
[55:25] TAPE FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM, THAT'S GOOD.
[55:27] BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH for you. You
[55:29] can listen to WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[55:30] AND SAY, "WELL, that's good. THAT'S
[55:31] GOOD. AMEN. I BELIEVE IT." AND THAT'S
[55:33] JUST THE FIRST STEP. REMEMBER THE first
[55:35] scripture we we read there. Satan also
[55:37] believes and trembles.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Satan listens to THE MESSAGE OF THE
[55:41] HOUR. SATAN KNOWS IT'S TRUE. AMEN. BUT
[55:43] HE HAS NO REVELATION of the message
[55:45] because he doesn't have Come on, church.
[55:48] But you have been saved and filled WITH
[55:50] THE HOLY GHOST AND THE WORD HAS COME
[55:52] INTO YOU AND HAS BEEN IGNITED. AND SO
[55:54] NOW YOU CAN SEE WHO YOU ARE IN THE
[55:56] MESSAGE. YOU HAVE FAITH in the revealing
[55:59] of the word.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me here tonight. This
[56:02] is on my heart burning up tonight. I
[56:04] want to tell you something. That's why
[56:05] we don't place it on any man. It don't
[56:07] matter if it was Moses or Elijah.
[56:09] Listen, I want you to notice Moses
[56:10] didn't even go to the promised land.
[56:12] Amen. But the words of Moses, Joshua
[56:14] would quote them on the other side.
[56:17] See, brother Brandon MAY NOT BE HERE
[56:19] TONIGHT, BUT I CAN STILL QUOTE A PROPHET
[56:21] BECAUSE I'M resting my faith on the word
[56:23] that he preached. He don't have to be in
[56:25] here in flesh. Amen. For faith to still
[56:27] be working. There's a group of people
[56:29] who have picked UP THE WORD OF GOD AND
[56:31] THEY HAVE NOT LEFT IT ON a tape. They
[56:33] have not left it on a book, but they
[56:34] have picked it up and they are using it.
[56:37] IT IS NIGH THEE even in thy mouth. AND
[56:40] WE ARE SPEAKING THE WORD and the faith
[56:42] is taking hold of the believer. Come on,
[56:44] church. The faith is here to ignite
[56:47] something ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. I WANT
[56:49] YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT IF YOU'RE SICK, YOU
[56:51] DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THIS BUILDING SICK.
[56:52] TONIGHT, IF YOU FEEL DEPRESSION,
[56:54] DEPRESSION HAS NO HOLD ON YOU HERE
[56:56] TONIGHT. THIS IS NOT A FEEL-GOOD
[56:58] MESSAGE, BUT IT IS A BELIEF THAT WE HAVE
[57:00] THE WORD OF GOD THAT HAS BEEN REVEALED
[57:02] TO US. AND THERE IS NOT A DEVIL IN HELL
[57:04] THAT CAN STAND AGAINST THE ROCK OF
[57:06] REVELATION.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Not a devil in hell can rise up against
[57:09] our FAITH BECAUSE THE FAITH IS NOT IN IN
[57:12] just brother Joel. The faith is not in
[57:13] brother Ben. AMEN. OR ANY OF THESE other
[57:15] ministers SITTING HERE, BUT THE FAITH IS
[57:17] IN THE WORD OF GOD.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me here tonight?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And my brother would say it like this.
[57:24] He said, "Pharaoh, if he would have
[57:26] looked into the word of God, he would
[57:28] have changed his attitude towards Moses
[57:30] and the rest of the Israelites."
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; The reason he doubted is because he
[57:36] couldn't see the word that was opened to
[57:40] his day, for his day.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me now. The reason
[57:43] people call you a fanatic and a holy
[57:45] roller and the reason they call you all
[57:47] kinds of an oddball or whatever else
[57:49] they call you, I want you to know why
[57:50] they do that, it's because they can't
[57:52] see what you see.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; THAT DON'T MEAN THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE, but
[57:56] they were not called to what you're
[57:57] called to.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[57:59] &gt;&gt; brother going like this. He said now he
[58:01] said if looked into the word of God, he
[58:03] said God promised by his word he was
[58:07] going to bring the children of Israel
[58:08] out of Egypt, he would have done it. He
[58:10] would have changed his attitude towards
[58:12] the people. But he was so busy. He went
[58:15] to church, a very religious man. He went
[58:18] to church and he was a what you call a
[58:20] mental believer, a psychic believer,
[58:22] whatever you want to call it. He had a
[58:24] knowledge of what he was going uh what
[58:26] he was doing in a middle way. But he
[58:28] said to have a real revelation that God
[58:30] was going to keep that word. If he'd
[58:33] have had that, he would have he would
[58:35] have acted toward Moses, wouldn't have
[58:37] acted toward Moses the way he did. So
[58:39] even Pharaoh could have had a revelation
[58:43] had he read the word that was promised
[58:45] in his generation, but he wasn't
[58:48] revealed to him. Now Moses's faith did
[58:51] not rest upon what he could do with the
[58:52] biggest army in the world. It didn't
[58:54] rest on what he could do sitting on
[58:56] Pharaoh's throne as a Pharaoh. His faith
[58:58] rested upon thus sayeth the Lord and
[59:00] what it said he had to do. He said he'd
[59:03] have to he cho if he chose to sit on
[59:04] Pharaoh's throne, there'd have been a
[59:06] little maidens come by and given him
[59:07] wine and everything and they'd have
[59:09] brought him food and everything. But he
[59:11] looked out into the desert would would
[59:13] take two million Jews with with not much
[59:15] more than heathens to take them out
[59:16] there in the desert where it wasn't even
[59:18] growing a thing. And he had to feed them
[59:19] in the journey for 40 years. He had uh
[59:22] uh deserts and disappointments and
[59:24] everything ahead of him. But God's word
[59:26] give the promise that he'd take them to
[59:28] the promised land. And Moses took out
[59:31] after God's word. I want you to know
[59:33] that Moses did not take out after his
[59:35] own ability. Moses did not look at the
[59:37] situation around him and say, "I think
[59:39] it's time to go get the children of
[59:41] Israel." No, he heard the voice and then
[59:43] he acted on THE VOICE OF GOD THAT HE
[59:46] HEARD. SEE, he was able to place his
[59:48] faith and rest his faith upon the voice
[59:51] THAT TOLD HIM, "GO DELIVER my children
[59:53] and I'll be with you." Come on, church.
[59:56] And when he said he would be with you,
[59:57] even in you, till the end of the world,
[59:59] don't you realize that you don't have to
[1:00:01] be no more afraid than Moses was? YOU
[1:00:03] CAN GO RIGHT into Pharaoh's house and
[1:00:05] you can take everything the devil stole
[1:00:06] from you. Come on, church. This is not a
[1:00:09] time to be scared. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO
[1:00:11] BE FEARFUL, BUT IT'S A TIME TO RAISE UP
[1:00:13] LIKE JOSHUA AND GO AHEAD AND LEAD THE
[1:00:15] ARMY OF THE LORD AND SAY WHAT A PROPHET
[1:00:17] SAID.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have we have we have a a
[1:00:21] belief. We have a faith and it can rest
[1:00:25] in the word of the hour.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it is the voice of God to
[1:00:30] you and me. Do you believe that here
[1:00:31] tonight? Do you believe that? The voice
[1:00:33] of God. Amen. I want I want to take you
[1:00:35] just a little farther. The voice of God
[1:00:37] in the bush, Moses heard it. And then
[1:00:39] when Moses spoke, Moses was then the
[1:00:42] voice of God to the people. Why? Because
[1:00:44] he WAS SAYING WHAT THE word told him to
[1:00:46] say. And when brother Brandon would
[1:00:48] stand there, he would say, "I'm waiting
[1:00:49] on him." And then when he would speak,
[1:00:51] HE COULD SPEAK WHAT GOD SAID. AND THAT
[1:00:54] WAS THE VOICE OF GOD TO YOU. AND NOW I
[1:00:56] want you to notice something. When the
[1:00:58] word comes into the bride,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; come on, somebody. The bride can then
[1:01:03] speak the word. Brothers would say it
[1:01:04] like this. He said, "THEN YOU ARE THE
[1:01:06] FINAL VOICE to the final age." I know
[1:01:07] I've quoted THAT QUITE A FEW TIMES, BUT
[1:01:09] I WANT YOU TO NOTICE SOMETHING. IT'S NOT
[1:01:11] YOUR words that are the voice of God. It
[1:01:13] is his words that you're speaking that
[1:01:15] is the voice of God. It came through a
[1:01:18] prophet AND NOW THE BRIDE WILL SAY WHAT
[1:01:21] A PROPHET SAID.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice that's how we put
[1:01:25] faith in the ministry of this hour. It
[1:01:27] is not in the man. It is not in the
[1:01:29] human being in the pulpit. It's six foot
[1:01:31] of dirt standing in the pulpit. But if
[1:01:33] THEY'RE SAYING WHAT A PROPHET SAID, THEN
[1:01:35] WE CAN PUT FAITH IN THE WORD, not in the
[1:01:37] man.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here tonight?
[1:01:40] Amen. I I want you to we PUT FAITH IN
[1:01:42] THE human as they stay with the word.
[1:01:46] When you put faith When you PUT FAITH IN
[1:01:48] YOUR WIFE, it's because you took a vow.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And sickness and health and poverty and
[1:01:54] riches and all these wonderful things.
[1:01:57] You take a vow and you have faith that
[1:02:00] they will keep their vow.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You have faith in your pastor. He's
[1:02:03] going to say what a prophet said.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; You have faith that you're listen.
[1:02:07] That's the faith. That's the only faith
[1:02:08] you can have in humanity is that they
[1:02:10] WILL FOLLOW CHRIST. BUT THEY COULD LET
[1:02:12] YOU DOWN. They could fail you.
[1:02:15] Moses could even fail the people.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; He sure did.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; But when Moses failed, listen,
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon, I love how he said he
[1:02:26] said he brother Brandham talked about he
[1:02:28] said he went up on the mountain there
[1:02:29] and he said God packed his body away
[1:02:31] with angels. You know, I I I I don't
[1:02:34] want to I don't want to emphasize
[1:02:35] Moses's mistakes because he was God's
[1:02:37] man for the hour.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; But then there was someone that would
[1:02:41] come behind him, which was a Joshua
[1:02:42] generation. You realize that Moses was
[1:02:44] only raised up to get the people to
[1:02:46] where they were. God knew exactly where
[1:02:48] Moses would start and end.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; But then he would have a people ready to
[1:02:52] go on over.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me here tonight. This
[1:02:55] is this is just kind of where I've been
[1:02:57] thinking on lately. Amen. The people had
[1:02:58] to get ready under the message of Moses,
[1:03:01] but then they had to speak when they
[1:03:02] went up against the giants.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You've got to USE
[1:03:06] YOUR VOICE. YOU'VE got to walk around.
[1:03:07] You got to march around them walls. AND
[1:03:09] YOU'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY GET INTO ACTION.
[1:03:11] COME ON, CHURCH. It's not going to be
[1:03:12] any good if you sit there on the other
[1:03:14] side OF JORDAN AND SAY, "I BELIEVE THE
[1:03:16] MESSAGE. I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE." YOU'VE
[1:03:17] GOT TO GET INTO ACTION AND PUT YOUR
[1:03:19] FAITH INTO action
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says faith without
[1:03:24] works is dead.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; So you say, "I have faith in the word. I
[1:03:27] have faith in the word." Then you've got
[1:03:28] to put the faith that you have in this
[1:03:30] word into action.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. This faith was not called just to
[1:03:35] be the faith was not called faith was
[1:03:38] not given to you just to say I've got
[1:03:40] faith. What good would it a man that's
[1:03:43] got cancer or a woman that's got cancer
[1:03:45] what good would it do if they had all
[1:03:47] the faith in the world
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; and they didn't use it
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; sit there and die with cancer. I'm not
[1:03:53] saying that a person that dies with
[1:03:54] cancer or has cancer for that matter
[1:03:56] doesn't have faith. I I believe Job had
[1:03:58] faith. Job never lost his testimony in
[1:04:00] the midst of everything he went through.
[1:04:02] Amen. Sometimes it's just it's God's
[1:04:03] timing. It's always God's timing. Amen.
[1:04:05] So I I don't say that a person that's
[1:04:07] sick doesn't have faith. But I want you
[1:04:09] to notice why would God give you faith
[1:04:11] and then sit there and say, "Well, well,
[1:04:13] I gave you I've given you faith and
[1:04:15] you've got faith. You you you've placed
[1:04:16] it in the word, but now you're not going
[1:04:19] to get healed." No. If you've got faith,
[1:04:21] then you can speak and go forward.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; If you've really got faith, then you can
[1:04:26] go ahead and say, "GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN."
[1:04:28] If you've got faith, you can rise up and
[1:04:30] say, "You know what? Greater is he that
[1:04:32] is in me than the cancer. IF YOU'VE
[1:04:34] REALLY GOT FAITH in the word, then you
[1:04:36] can go back and point to the word just
[1:04:38] like Jesus did. He defeated Satan with
[1:04:40] what? The word. And brother Random said
[1:04:43] he was showing you that the weakest of
[1:04:45] Christians could take this word and
[1:04:47] defeat Satan any place, any time, ON ANY
[1:04:50] CONDITION. I WANT YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT
[1:04:52] THAT YOU ARE A POWERFUL PEOPLE. NOT BY
[1:04:55] YOUR OWN POWER, BUT BY THE WORD THAT IS
[1:04:58] NIGH THEE, EVEN IN your mouth. Oh, thank
[1:05:00] you, Lord.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; So, the word that is in you is greater
[1:05:04] than the enemy.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Satan believes the word, but the word
[1:05:09] has not become one with Satan because he
[1:05:11] is Satan. He is the devil. He is cast
[1:05:14] out from heaven. He He can't be saved.
[1:05:17] There's there's nothing about him that
[1:05:18] he he believes it from his he can sit
[1:05:20] there and say that's right and this is
[1:05:22] right. Satan believes everything. He
[1:05:24] believes everything to be right. He
[1:05:25] knows brother Brandon was a prophet more
[1:05:27] than Listen, Satan has better revelation
[1:05:29] than most people in the world do.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Satan knows that brother Brandon was
[1:05:34] sent and was called to be a prophet of
[1:05:35] God. That's why he stood there and
[1:05:37] tormented him every night when he was on
[1:05:39] the platform. That's why he would put
[1:05:41] somebody in the congregation and and and
[1:05:42] brother Brand would be have to fight
[1:05:44] them spirits. Come on, church. You
[1:05:45] realize Satan believes and trembles. HE
[1:05:48] KNOWS IT'S RIGHT, BUT HE ALSO KNOWS HIS
[1:05:50] destination is not. Come on, church. He
[1:05:53] wants to take SOMEBODY WITH HIM. HE
[1:05:54] WANTS TO MAKE YOU DOUBT. HE WANTS TO
[1:05:56] TAKE YOU OUT OF THE WORD. AND WHAT HE
[1:05:58] WANTS YOU TO DO FIRST IS START just
[1:05:59] disbelieving one little word. And if he
[1:06:02] can do that, then he CAN GET YOUR FAITH
[1:06:04] SHAKEN. Because when you when you get
[1:06:07] off the word, your faith then is shaken
[1:06:09] because you've gotten off of the rock of
[1:06:11] revelation.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; But if you'll stay with the word that
[1:06:14] you that you've BEEN GIVEN, IT DON'T
[1:06:16] MATTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT. Believe it
[1:06:18] anyway.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; I'm sure the disciples didn't understand
[1:06:21] every parable that Jesus spoke right
[1:06:23] away. Amen. But they believed it. Why?
[1:06:25] Because they had a revelation.
[1:06:26] Especially Peter, he had a revelation of
[1:06:28] who Jesus was.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And then when he was converted, he could
[1:06:33] strengthen his brethren. I want you to
[1:06:35] know here tonight, church. I I I'm not
[1:06:37] trying to I I'm not trying to I'm not
[1:06:40] trying to uh preach at you or anything.
[1:06:42] I just I I want us to take this personal
[1:06:44] tonight that we need to apply our faith
[1:06:46] to our situations. If you're sick, you
[1:06:49] need to start using your faith. I
[1:06:51] believe most of us in the building
[1:06:52] probably have more faith than what you
[1:06:54] even know. I believe those that are
[1:06:56] homesick and listening in tonight. Amen.
[1:06:58] I I believe you've got more faith than
[1:07:00] what you think you have. Because in the
[1:07:02] midst of your trial, that faith is going
[1:07:04] to raise up on the INSIDE OF YOU. YOU
[1:07:05] MAY NOT FEEL FAITH, BUT IT'S THERE. WHY?
[1:07:08] Because you come to church week in and
[1:07:10] week out and you feed on the WORD OF
[1:07:12] GOD. AND faith cometh by hearing and
[1:07:15] hearing. Come on, church. I hope you're
[1:07:18] with me now. You say, "I don't have any
[1:07:19] faith." and start hearing THE WORD OF
[1:07:21] GOD. DON'T JUST LET IT COME OFF. DON'T
[1:07:23] JUST LEAVE IT on the page. Don't just
[1:07:25] LEAVE IT ON THE TAPE, BUT APPLY IT IN
[1:07:27] YOUR HEART AND YOU CAN HAVE HEART FAITH.
[1:07:30] AND THAT'S WHERE THAT FAITH CAN REST IS
[1:07:32] ON the revelation that you have heard.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on like this and I
[1:07:38] am almost out of time so just give me a
[1:07:39] few minutes and I'll I'll bring this to
[1:07:41] a close. He said now he said no matter
[1:07:43] how much faith you've got, [snorts] if
[1:07:46] you won't use it, it's no good to you.
[1:07:49] He said, "What good is a God of Moses if
[1:07:51] he ain't the same God today?"
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "What good?" He said, "What
[1:07:56] good is a historical God? You people go
[1:07:59] to church and your church only teaches
[1:08:01] that some historical fact about the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost coming back on the day of
[1:08:04] Pentecost. There is no such a thing
[1:08:06] today. There was healing back there." He
[1:08:08] said, "What good does that do you?" No.
[1:08:10] He said, "Just no more than reading
[1:08:11] George Washington once lived." That's
[1:08:13] right. Abraham Lincoln once lived.
[1:08:15] According to the the history, Abraham
[1:08:17] Lincoln lived. And according to history,
[1:08:18] George Washington lived, but they're
[1:08:20] dead and buried according to history.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And so our message, if it was just to
[1:08:26] tell you ABOUT A JESUS THAT WAS, would
[1:08:28] just be a dead letter.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Jesus was."
[1:08:34] Okay, good. That's good. You know your
[1:08:36] history.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Paul lived and Paul saw a light. Good.
[1:08:40] You know your history.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; But the message followed.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. Good. That's a first
[1:08:49] step. But that's not what you need to
[1:08:50] know.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You've got to know THAT THE SAME GOD
[1:08:54] THAT WAS WITH THE PROPHET IS IN THE
[1:08:56] BRIDE.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Because if YOU TAKE HIM OUT OF THE
[1:08:58] BRIDE, THEN WHAT THE PROPHET CAME TO DO,
[1:09:00] come on, church. YOU MAKE THE ENTIRE
[1:09:02] MESSAGE USELESS IF YOU DON'T PUT THE
[1:09:04] MESSAGE IN THE BRIDE. BECAUSE HE CAME TO
[1:09:06] CALL OUT A BRIDE.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; We see if you take the if you take the
[1:09:11] bride away from this whole thing, the
[1:09:13] message didn't even come to do anything.
[1:09:15] Yeah, that's right.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; There had to be a people believe it. If
[1:09:18] Moses would have come and went DOWN INTO
[1:09:20] EGYPT AND TOLD THE PEOPLE WHAT GOD TOLD
[1:09:22] HIM AND then he left without him.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that they would have been
[1:09:27] in vain? God wouldn't have even went to
[1:09:28] Moses. BUT GOD CAME TO A PROPHET TO SHOW
[1:09:31] you that you were the bride. And then
[1:09:33] when you see that you're the bride, you
[1:09:35] are called out and YOU ARE SET ASIDE AND
[1:09:37] YOU REALIZE, I'M NO longer just a church
[1:09:40] member. I'm no longer just another uh
[1:09:42] Holy GHOST FILILLED CHRISTIAN, BUT I AM
[1:09:45] A believer in the end time message and
[1:09:47] I've been adopted INTO THE KINGDOM OF
[1:09:48] GOD. I KNOW WHO I AM BY THE REVELATION
[1:09:52] OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; AND UPON THAT REVELATION, MY FAITH
[1:09:56] CANNOT BE SHAKEN. MY FAITH CANNOT BE
[1:09:58] MOVED. NOT NO DEVIL IN HELL CAN TAKE
[1:10:01] THIS REVELATION FROM ME BECAUSE I'M NOT
[1:10:03] SEEING IT THROUGH MY MIND. I'M SEEING IT
[1:10:05] BY THE VINDICATED MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here tonight? Yes.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't want you to be He
[1:10:12] doesn't want you to be scared.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to be fearful. He
[1:10:16] didn't say follow Moses. Sometimes
[1:10:18] follow Moses. But but you know when he
[1:10:20] strikes that rock instead of speaks to
[1:10:21] it, uh you just have to just edit that
[1:10:23] part out of the message. No, sir. They
[1:10:25] followed Moses anyway.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; God will deal with Moses over his
[1:10:29] mistakes. You follow the prophet anyway.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me now? Moses didn't
[1:10:34] go say, "Well, Moses Moses made so many
[1:10:36] mistakes, you know, we just can't follow
[1:10:38] THAT MESSAGE." NO. GOD TOOK A MAN FULL
[1:10:40] of mistakes and used him as the
[1:10:42] messenger to that age.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? I WANT YOU TO
[1:10:47] LOOK PAST THE MAN and his mistakes
[1:10:50] because all men make mistakes.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; But the word, there's no mistake in it.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS NOT FULL OF MISTAKES.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You can look at the man and say, "Well,
[1:11:00] you know, he had nervousness and he and
[1:11:02] he fought all these THINGS UP UNTIL THE
[1:11:04] TIME HE DIED." AMEN. BUT BUT BUT I'M NOT
[1:11:06] LOOKING AT THAT. I'M LOOKING AT A MAN
[1:11:07] THAT COULD STAND THERE AND YIELD HIS
[1:11:09] BODY SO MUCH TO THE HOLY GHOST, THEN it
[1:11:11] wasn't him speaking. IT WAS GOD SPEAKING
[1:11:14] TO THIS GENERATION.
[1:11:16] AND IF GOD IS SPEAKING TO THIS
[1:11:17] GENERATION, IT'S THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[1:11:19] people that are ready to hear the voice
[1:11:21] of God that has been spoken. Come on,
[1:11:24] church. Don't let the letter just come
[1:11:26] and BE ON THE PAGE. DON'T LET THE LETTER
[1:11:28] JUST COME. DON'T LET THE VOICE just come
[1:11:29] and just BE ON A TAPE, BUT TAKE THAT
[1:11:31] INTO YOUR HEART AND SPEAK THE WORD, AND
[1:11:34] GOD WILL BACK IT UP. Thank you all.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me here tonight? Brother
[1:11:38] Brandham says it like this. I love this
[1:11:40] quote just before I close. He said, he
[1:11:42] said, "You try to apply it." He He said,
[1:11:44] he said, "I we need real faith in men
[1:11:46] who dare to put God's word to their
[1:11:47] heart and apply it to themselves. You
[1:11:48] try to apply it to the generation gone
[1:11:50] by. But the Bible says that Jesus Christ
[1:11:52] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:11:53] forever. He's forever God. He never
[1:11:55] fails. He's the same in principle. He's
[1:11:57] the same in power. He's the same tonight
[1:11:59] that he was when he walked on the banks
[1:12:01] of Galilee. and he appears nightly on
[1:12:03] this platform and proves himself alive
[1:12:05] from the dead. He said now you don't
[1:12:07] have to take any his history about it.
[1:12:09] It's right now present time fact we see
[1:12:12] it. Come on church. That was in 1955.
[1:12:15] Brother Brandham made that bold
[1:12:16] statement that right there on the
[1:12:17] platform you could see the same Jesus
[1:12:19] Christ in action again. And brother
[1:12:21] Brandham would go on like this. He said
[1:12:23] and this was a long one so I'm going to
[1:12:24] try to get down here where I highlighted
[1:12:25] it. He said now he said he said now the
[1:12:27] same word. He said he had he had the
[1:12:30] word and he said whatsoever you ask in
[1:12:32] my name I'll do that. That's right. He
[1:12:33] said he defeated the devil on the word
[1:12:35] of God. The devil come to him and said
[1:12:37] now you do a miracle before me I hear
[1:12:39] you're going to be a miracle worker. You
[1:12:41] do something before me that and he said
[1:12:42] that devil still lives. Turn these
[1:12:44] stones into bread and eat and I'll
[1:12:45] believe you. Jesus said it is written
[1:12:47] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:12:49] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:12:50] mouth of God. He said now that's where
[1:12:53] his faith was anchored. And there's
[1:12:55] where every man and woman's faith
[1:12:57] tonight ought to be anchored tonight is
[1:12:59] upon the living word of God. You believe
[1:13:01] that? You can put it into action. Are
[1:13:03] you still with me here tonight? He said,
[1:13:05] "Now Jesus, when he was here on earth,
[1:13:07] he said, "Verily, I say unto you, I can
[1:13:09] do nothing in myself. I'm the son. I can
[1:13:12] do nothing, but what the father shows me
[1:13:14] that I do." Are you hearing me here
[1:13:17] tonight? He said, "I come to do the will
[1:13:18] of God." And when he went away, he said,
[1:13:20] "This ministry shall not cease now. For
[1:13:23] the very things that I do, you will do
[1:13:26] also."
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? For I will be with
[1:13:29] you, even in you to the end of the
[1:13:30] world. And this will be a sign. He said,
[1:13:32] "The very things that I do shall you do
[1:13:33] to the end of the world." He There'll be
[1:13:35] people that will not see me no more, but
[1:13:37] you shall see me, for I'll be with you,
[1:13:39] even in you to the end of the time.
[1:13:41] Jesus Christ is raised from the dead
[1:13:43] tonight. Can you say amen? And brother
[1:13:45] Brandon was going like this. He said,
[1:13:46] "Now the heroes of the Old Testament had
[1:13:48] faith. They put it in action. You've got
[1:13:51] them for an example. Now we've got
[1:13:53] faith, but you won't put it into action
[1:13:55] right away with the powers of the Holy
[1:13:57] Spirit." I say tonight as the musicians
[1:13:59] come, I mean, it's time we lift him up
[1:14:01] out of history and take the God that was
[1:14:03] and make him the God that it is tonight.
[1:14:06] AMEN. IT'S NOT A GOD that I was, but
[1:14:07] it's A GOD THAT I AM. AMEN. HE'S A
[1:14:09] PRESENT TENSE GOD. HE'S A GOD THAT IS
[1:14:12] HERE IN A TIME OF TROUBLE. HE'S A GOD
[1:14:13] THAT IS RAISED up and he's raised the
[1:14:15] dead before and he'll always come on
[1:14:17] church. Amen. If you're dead in sin and
[1:14:19] trespasses, he can raise YOU UP EVEN
[1:14:21] HERE TONIGHT. AMEN. GOD DID NOT LEAVE
[1:14:23] YOU COMFORTLESS. BUT HE SENT HIS SPIRIT
[1:14:25] TO RAISE you up and make you what you
[1:14:27] ought to be. I say here tonight, there
[1:14:29] ought to be men and women that say, you
[1:14:31] know, the devil's come and he's knocked
[1:14:32] at my door, but I'm going to raise up
[1:14:34] and say, God, I mean, I I'm your
[1:14:36] property. Amen. Satan has no business
[1:14:38] here. Amen. Faith has taken a hold and
[1:14:41] faith is going to finish what it
[1:14:43] started. Come on, church. I HAVE A
[1:14:45] REVELATION. I KNOW WHO I AM NOW. I AM
[1:14:48] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND I'VE BEEN
[1:14:50] CALLED AND ORDAINED FOR A MOMENT LIKE
[1:14:52] THIS TO overcome every tempter and every
[1:14:55] one of his tricks. Are you with me here
[1:14:57] tonight, church? I don't want you to
[1:14:58] think, Amen, and leave this service and
[1:15:00] think, well, Monday morning's coming and
[1:15:02] and Satan's going to be there to meet
[1:15:04] me. Yes, he will. But greater is he that
[1:15:06] is in you. PUT YOUR FAITH IN ACTION ON
[1:15:08] MONDAY MORNING. PUT YOUR FAITH IN ACTION
[1:15:10] ON TUESDAY MORNING. PUT YOUR FAITH IN
[1:15:12] ACTION ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. AMEN. WHEN
[1:15:14] YOU COME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, DON'T
[1:15:15] COME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD THINKING,
[1:15:17] "WELL, I HOPE I HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH
[1:15:18] TONIGHT." COME BACK EXPECTING A
[1:15:20] BREAKTHROUGH IN THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; What is it? IT'S FAITH THAT GOD'S GOING
[1:15:25] TO DO WHAT HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; It's not faith in history, but it's
[1:15:32] faith in a living God that is in you
[1:15:35] even now.
[1:15:37] Faith has a resting place in the
[1:15:39] believer.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; You believe it tonight?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could stand together.
[1:15:49] Spirit, pray.
[1:15:51] Rain
[1:15:53] down.
[1:15:55] Won't you just rain
[1:15:59] rain down?
[1:16:04] comforter
[1:16:06] and friend.
[1:16:08] Oh, how we need your touch once again.
[1:16:15] Holy [singing]
[1:16:16] Spirit, rain,
[1:16:20] rain down.
[1:16:22] Oh, won't you rain [singing]
[1:16:27] down?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Let [music and singing] your power fall.
[1:16:33] Let your voice be heard. Come and
[1:16:37] [singing] change [music]
[1:16:38] our hearts as we stand on your word.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Holy [singing] Spirit,
[1:16:50] rain.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; One more time with all your hearts now.
[1:16:54] Oh, sing it now. Holy Spirit, rain.
[1:16:59] Won't you rain down? [singing] Oh yes,
[1:17:03] Lord. Rain,
[1:17:06] rain [singing] down.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my comforter [singing]
[1:17:12] and friend.
[1:17:15] Oh, how we need your touch once again.
[1:17:22] Holy [music and singing] Spirit, rain
[1:17:26] now.

[1:17:33] down
[1:17:36] our [music and singing]
[1:17:37] fall. Let your voice be heard. Come and
[1:17:43] change our hearts as we stand on your
[1:17:47] word.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Holy [singing]
[1:17:49] Spirit [music]
[1:17:52] rain
[1:17:56] down. [singing]
[1:17:58] that your desire here tonight. We are
[1:18:01] the [music] generation.
[1:18:04] We're the culmination.
