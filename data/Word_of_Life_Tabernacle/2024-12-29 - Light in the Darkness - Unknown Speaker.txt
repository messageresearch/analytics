then next Sunday we'll have our regular services will be the first Sunday of the year so we'll have communion on Sunday night I'm looking forward to that it's been a couple months since we've had communion amen let's go to Matthew 5 and verse1 14 Matthew chap 5:14 I know there's several that are sick and I'm been under the weather a little bit myself so you pray for me this morning be praying for those that are home today and not able to come especially brother Gabe I know the Lord has really attacked him and and and um uh just and sister Patty as well just seemed like they got sick and couldn't get over it but uh that's just the devil We Believe God's A Healer how many believe that today so we believe that for healing for them Matthew 5:14 you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick it giveth light unto all that are in the house house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven I want to speak to you this morning on light in the darkness you may be seated pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word John winthrip said this when the Puritans first sailed to America and they were looking at establishing a new nation a new settlement he said we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon us and politicians have used that many times and said we're like America is like a city on a hill but I think the rest of this statement is true of this country he said so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken so cause him to withdraw his present help from us we shall be made a story and a byword through the world we shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil the ways of God and all professors for God's sake in other words he said we're a city on a hill everybody's looking at us and depending on what we do with this blessing that we've been given will depend on how people view that and how people view God and so we are a reflection of light but and I but I think we can all agree that this country is no longer a light but it's a Darkness there's a Darkness upon it everywhere in this country just the other day uh there was a a story that really it really bothered me to see it it was a woman a homeless woman was on the subway in New York and and uh and a guy come through and and he just just for fun just lights are on fire lights are on fire fans the flame and then what was more disturbing than that to me because this guy's obviously mentally Disturbed but more disturbing than that was that people videoed it and didn't help what kind of a world do we live in church where people would just stand by and watch that but the culture has become so uh much so intense towards getting likes getting uh a reaction on social media that they just stood by and videoed a woman burnt alive I I tell you what people answer for things like that Darkness rains in the world that we live in it's not just there in New York City but everywhere we can see that people just aren't even Humane anymore we treat our and cats better than we do our people in many cases and it's not right and and and there's darkness and yet I don't want to talk so much about the darkness today but we are not of that Darkness we we are of the light the Bible says he said you are all the children of light and the children of the day you're not we're not of the night nor of Darkness we're not a part of that we are the light of the world that's what Jesus is telling us we're the true city on a hill and we have responsibility to let that light shine to let our light so shine before men and he tells us how to do that he said let your light shine through good works good works now that word good is actually the word beautiful or desirable something that is intrinsically sound in a moral or ethical sense and works is a workmanship a duty a task something that is accomplished by someone so we can say like this beautiful workmanship in other words by your actions let people see what Christ has done for you and so he said let your light shine let it let it shine shine refers to the state of something radiating light so it's not something that is uh putting something on but it's what something is that word is used when Jesus is transfigured before them his face shown his face glowed it it had a radiating light about it brother brandham taught us there was a difference in that and the and the way that Hollywood shines Hollywood shines Hollywood uh has a a glamour about it but but he said the gospel glows or something about the gospel that that causes it to to put out a light and so we don't we don't have the glamour of self righteousness but the glow of the spirit of God isn't that what we want in our lives and our homes and everything that we are he said now so it's not the the the glamour of self-righteousness not like the leoan church which said I'm rich and increased in Goods I'm a city on a hill but they lacked the character to prove what they were and to actually be what they claimed to be and brother Bram said here at church thinks it's so clothed in it self-righteousness until you think you go to bring them the word and they said that's contrary to our Creed he said what you sold out in your birth rights instead of being glamour he said we ought to be glowing instead of being glamour we ought to be glowing and so he talks about the the Full Gospel businessmen and he said the the glamour was of that was they tried to get as many together as they could and there's nothing wrong with that he said but that's the glamour of it he said he said maybe there he said uh instead of having five or 600 or everyone is here at breakfast he said that's all right after nothing against it he said I'm just here in the name of the Lord Jesus but instead of that there ought to be a glowing Among Us of the Holy Spirit he said maybe there's only a dozen glowing in the beauty of the Lord oh that's what we want isn't it glowing in the beauty of the Lord the Lord Jesus would be so upon us until the glow of the Lord would be in us he said but we want to shine speaking of that church of that day we want to shine more members see he said the church has always counted membership God counts character not membership and so we find that with Esther and brother Brown illustrates that he said Esther had an inner glow there was something inside of her that she was willing to uh she was willing to not take all the the paint and the makeup and the and the jewelry and things she just said whatever you tell me to wear I'll wear and she went before the king in a simple way because it it was showed the beauty was on the inside not what was on the outside and as the bride we don't just take what the world offers us but we take that light that glow that's on the inside and sometimes we go through some things and and we go through trials and we have trouble in our lives and we experience difficulty but what does that do it works a character in our life it brings the glow out of us brings the glow out of us oh church that's what I want I don't want to just be a shiny place a place that's a place that's uh uh got a lot of glitter or tinsil as we talk talked about last week but I want to glow from the inside so brother Brandon was talking about the Tabernacle and I I believe this true of our church as well is what we want he said I think it's our duty to make the inside right we want the outside to be nice but it's our duty to make the inside right this is good works yeah by the grace of God to be so grateful to God that this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic oh my the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people that's why we keep order in the sanctuary it's why we do our best to make sure we're not trying to be hard on people but what are we doing we're we want it to be a consecrated place and a consecrated people a beautiful people keep the inside right but no matter how beautiful the structure is we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church he said is the character of the people the beauty of the church is how do you get character by going through some things by by going through hard trials by by being refined by those things by going through the fire he said may it be a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is the beauty of the church is the character of the people he said I trust it'll always be a house of God Beauty good works done out of love for God and man are light in the darkness if you just live your life by the Bible just do what you can to live right you're you're 100% better off I started to say 90% you're 100% better off than what this world does you'll be a better citizen a better person in your community you'll be a better person in your church right you'll be a better person in your world better husband in your family better wife better child whatever it is if you just do you say well I don't know a lot about the Bible just do what you know right just do what you know just do what and that's a choice that we have see he wants us to let our light shine let what we are get out to the world yeah so a lot of people think of Good Works they think of that as helping the widow or the orphan and that's part of it but that's not all of it Jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me to finish his work he was talking about about being in the perfect will of God and brother brandom explained to us I don't have time to get into it this morning real compassion is doing the will of God so we need to find the will of God for every one of our Lives the best thing we could do for our family is to find the will of God for where we work and where we go to church and who we're married to are you with me now we should find the will of God that's and that's our personal responsibility to find that it's the best thing the most compassionate thing you can do the best you say I want to do something for my community the best thing you can do is to be in the will of God and if you're in the will of God there will be opportunity to help people during that time now and so he said my mean is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work and now we we can't make ourselves light right he didn't say he didn't say go make yourself light yeah make yourself a city yeah on a hill he said you are a city on a hill that's right he didn't say make yourself light he said just don't put a bushel of basket over it right so he not telling us we can't make oursel light but the question is how do we take our light out from under the basket see light is only comes by Grace we we can't get there on our own but we can let our light shine that's up to us and that only comes by the new birth so how do we get it out from under the basket and if I would challenge you as we come into the new year we could look back at our old year and say well maybe I was this way and this is the way I I conducted myself but going into this new year how can I get my light out from under the basket how can I how can I put it on a candle stick because that's something he told us we could do so much of the New Testament if you look at it is dealing with our works yeah do you know that our duty to God our individual responsibility right as Christians Ephesians 2 and8 I want us to deal because you you know the book of Ephesians and I want to get into some things that Paul got into is just going to be uh teaching this morning so y'all bear with me but the Joel's going to preach this afternoon so uh he'll uh preach us back happy again but I you know as a pastor I'm responsible to you I'm I'm responsible to preach the word to our children our young people and this is what the word is I I can't just always you know we could come out here and preach something everybody liked every service and and everybody be happy but that's not my responsibility my responsibility is to is to arm you with the truth so that you can go out and fight the good fight and be able to make it in the world that you live in sir so in Ephesians if you go to the book of Ephesians you find in Ephesians chapter 1 Paul deals with tremendous Mysteries right tremendous Mysteries that he deals with he deals with uh you we preached it many times brother BR preaches it in the adoption series he deals with Grace he deals with election predestination he deals with some wonderful wonderful depth and we're called to be an Ephesian Church how many believe that brother BR taught us that we're called to another Ephesians not another Corinthians so we're not called and I believe our preaching reflects that we're not called to just be hammered all the time I don't mean that in a maybe the way that you take it we're not called to be uh to have a preacher beating us over the head all the time is what I meant to say right that's not what we're called to we're called to the searchable Riches of Christ and if you got to if you got to go to church and get beat up every Sunday to be a Christian maybe you just need to be born again yeah right and then you don't have to get beat up so much and yet Paul does teach the people how to work yeah in a literal and figurative sense he teaches them how to do good works in because just because you're a Christian doesn't mean you automatically know what to do but being a Christian means when you know what to do you'll do it yes that's what being a Christian means it means you surren you've surrendered your will to the will of God but then you got to seek the will of God and where do we find the will his word is his will so we find the will of God by looking into the word of God and seeing what is it that you want me to do Lord what kind of a husband ought I to be what kind of a man what kind of a what kind of a church ought we to be so we find how to have church and how to how to be a man how to be a woman if you're a woman how to be a mother how to be a child all of that is in the word it's part of the word I'm so glad God didn't leave that out he didn't leave that out he didn't leave that out of of the Bible he didn't leave that out of the message of the hour you'll find when brother Brandon brought the opening of the word there was so much of that there was wonderful Mysteries and then there was so much of that that is your life worthy of the Gospel right brother Brandon preached both so it's our responsibility to do the same so if you go to Ephesians you go past chapter 1 and you get into chapter 2 and chapter 2 vers verse 8 he said for by grace are you saved through faith it's an important principle he said that not of yourselves it is the gift of God so you couldn't have done nothing to call yourself to the gospel it's the gift of God not of work such any man should boast for we are his workmanship his beautiful workmanship what does Jesus say let your light so shine before men we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works now he's talking to saved people here not to unsaved not to not to people who don't care about the gospel he's not talking to the world he's talking to the church he's talking to the bride he said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God have before ordained that we should walk in in them so he he sets that and then he goes in chapter 3 and goes back into some of the deep things some of the wonderful Mysteries that he's dealing with and then in Ephesians 4 chter 4 verse 1 he said I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called so your walk is a choice yeah right your calling is not a choice right are you hear me this morning but your walk in that calling is a choice you can't make yourself light but you can take the basket off of the light put the light on a Candlestick be that City on the hill so he said I beseech you to walk worthy the vocation wherewith you're called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love in other words not not being easily offended and Dev ing to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and that one place he said as much as lies in you to Endeavor to do that and we preached on that many times he deals in in chapter four with gifts and with the five-fold ministry and then in verse 17 he said this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind so in other words they they walk or they they conduct themselves just however they feel like conducting themselves right right that's what in the vanity of their mind means they've just made up a culture right so he's telling us don't be like the culture come on now don't do what the culture does and I know sometimes when we hear preaching like this we we think well nobody else does it like this but what does the word say Church some point we got to come back to the word let the word order our thoughts let the word do that we find many this this culture breeds depression it breeds anxiety it breeds ungodliness it breeds all licentiousness all the adultery and everything else I don't want any of that in my life I don't want the culture I don't want to walk in the vanity of my own mind I want to walk according to the word yes so he said I don't want you to walk like other Gentiles in the vanity of your mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart yeah who being past feeling oh that's an interesting word being past feeling those people who watch that that woman get burnt past feeling yes sir huh are you with me now they're being past they don't even they're not even condemned by doing what's wrong anymore well I pray we would never get to that place I'm so glad to see our young people are sensitive to the when preach your young people are sensitive although we would all be sensitive to the preaching of the word when we hear something preach if it if it comes to us repent of that don't mean you're not a Christian listen it's not just it's not just Sinners that need to be at the altar many times Christians need to be at the altar we need to be surrendering ourselves to God not to get saved again if you've ever been saved you can't be unsaved right you you're sealed to the day of your Redemption but if we grieve him we need to get back in fellowship with him if we get CAU oh we need to get on fire again if we're not feeling the reain of the spirit anymore we need to feel that again it's not just a well it's wonderful when we do it no we must have it we've got to have his presence we've got to we've got to spend time around him if we don't we'll end up just like the world we don't want to be past feeling the word of God ought to prick our hearts H have given themselves over into levious such immoral living to work all unclean uncleanness with greediness but you have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus you got to be taught brother brand says it this way he said you must come under teaching you must come under teaching so you say well I just get saved and everything will be okay you need to be saved but you must come under teaching right you say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come my friends he said they just giv me just a little room to doubt whether you really got it or not I don't need to be taught people I don't need a pastor I don't need a Ministry I don't need I don't need the church well that's brother brandom taught us what that was right he said and now Ephesians 4:22 he said that you put off so he said this is what you should do this is what you've been taught that you put off concerning the former conversation the former Lifestyle the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts you put it off talk the saved people right people who are in church people who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on are you with me now but you still got an old man right that you got to put off put him off what do you mean take off it's like you're wearing clothes of the old man you take that off he's tell you what to wear what to what to do how to conduct yourself put off concerning concerning the former Lifestyle the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind he says that in Romans he said be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind transform into what the word wants you to be where you quit arguing with the word and making the word and say and many times church it's just a simple things and and yet we say well you know we know a better way or or maybe I feel like or I'm LED this direction and and what what you realize you got to do what God says first he's not going to lead you away from his word amen he's not going to influence you but the way we know that the influence that's on us is God is whether or not it lines up with the word so he said be renewed in the spirit of your mind put on that new put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness so you have a new creation you are a new creation put it on right wear your new creation wear your salvation walk in it let it shine are you with me now so this is what putting on the new man will do Ephesians 4:25 wherefore putting away lying putting away I the old man he was a liar right come in the worlds say well not my old man yeah right the former right Ben PR was a liar the former brother Harold whoever you speak of the most imminent Christian but you were a liar the Bible says you were all of us were but but we put away lying yeah speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another now again and we're taught what a neighbor is it's that the person next to us it's not just those in the in the household of faith but but the one that we have an opportunity our paths Collide and you find that teaching where Jesus taught about the Good Samaritan who who is the neighbor now we put he said speak every man truth with his neighbor we're members one of another some people say brother BR said don't condemn me to wear short hair don't condemn me to wear manicure makeup or whatever it is it don't condemn me to go to dances don't condemn me to tell a little white lie don't condemn me to play bridge in my bridge party that probably don't hit nobody today does it but don't condemn me to gamble on the internet on that's what they do now don't condemn me to play bridge in my bridge party he said you know why you ain't got nothing to condemn that don't hurt my conscience he said that's pretty hard but glad he said he said you got no more conscience than a snake has hips snake ain't got hips no more you ain't got no conscience there ain't nothing there to hurt you you're of the world said but I challenge you to let Jesus Christ come in here and try to do it one time brother you'll be so condemned you'll back off and shake your head from that thing just a certain as I'm standing here how can you tell a lie and not be condemned by it come on church that's the old man that could do that Paul says put off that old man don't be a liar right said well to my benefit to lie exactly that's the time when you got to tell the truth but you find that a person that lies will lie whether to their benefit or not I still lie you know your body doesn't believe you when you lie let me just preach our young people I know well brother are you preaching to me let me just preach our young people we all can agree that the young people need it right do you know your body doesn't believe you when you tell a lie do you know that when you lie your body says he's a liar Peter has a twitch Peter's a a truth telling young man but he does have a twitch if he tries to to hide something he twitches and uh and we figured that out me and brother jph had fun with him before we tried to get him to say something wasn't true and he just Twitches cuz you're not used to it your body your body will tell on you you get sick you're you're living in a way that you weren't meant to live in brother brandom takes this in a very I'm spending time on this for a reason brother brandom takes this in a very deep way when you're living as a sinner your body doesn't like it right right it doesn't it wasn't made to live like that right and and it doesn't like it your mind your mental capacity everything about you don't you're living a life if you were meant to be a Christian if you got a SE of God on the inside of you there's something inside of you that you know you say well I'll just stay away from church for a while no there got something inside of you that that calls out and that's why you feel so bad when you're not in the house of God when you're not in Fellowship when you're not around people there just something that you say well that's just people would condemn me no it's something inside of you it's not that people would condemn you but something inside of you it's condemned what is that your body wasn't meant to live like that because you know what the scripture says right and you profess to be a Christian right so some of you ladies you know that's true if you went out here and cut your hair and and you know how badly you would feel yeah why CU you've been born again right go and put a face full of makeup or something like that you know how bad that would how how that would haunt you yeah cuz you're born again I don't say that a Christian would never fall never do anything else wrong but it haunts you doesn't it if you even think you told a lie you just there's something about I I didn't tell that person all the truth sometimes you forget and you tell part of a story I've done that before you tell part of a story and you get done you get home and you realize they probably took that wrong probably looks better on me cuz the way we generally tell our stories is to look better for ourselves probably looks better on me than it did and don't you realize that our bodies even our our makeup is not to do that right and yet the world can do it why because it's the old man it's his way right but we're not called to be the old man we're called to put on the new man yes he said brother bar taught us he said I'm positive sure this morning if men and women he said could only get into into the position where their soul their thinking their attitude would be perfect in the sight of God would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed uh you don't you say well I can't do everything right that's not what he's asking you to do he said get your thinking right right your willingness to do the word right and if that would happen this rest would begin to come around right but but when you don't when you do things you know is wrong it shows up you kids know that I know none of you ever tell an untruth to your parents but when you do it hurts don't it bothers you don't it huh Piper's looking at me she got real quiet bothers you Don it when you huh when you tell something Melody bothers you Don it she said not me it ought to right your body don't like it you find yourself sick nervous upset just because you your body you're not living right and there's a way out of that how just live right confess it and I'll say this as a parent and I think I can speak for most of the parents here we'd much rather know what you did right than be lied to because we're going to find out my teacher told me my first grade teacher or kindergarten teacher told me and she had eyes in the back of her head and I believed her cuz she knew everything everything that went on and I still you know my mother was that way my mother knew everything she was omniscient in our house and I want to tell you kids our we our parents are omniscient they are they're going to find out they're going to they're you don't have the ability to have just just just tell the truth and you'll be much better off tell the truth don't lie about it you weren't made to lie then you'll feel so much better you might get a whooping but it won't be near as hard as once they find out the hard things to lie you know don't just don't lie to me I've tried not to I don't know why I'm getting off on this but I've tried not to discipline my kids from making mistakes I might get frustrated with them but if you you know if you you you break something you mess something up you something like that then you know I may yell at them for not paying attention but but as far as for doing that that's I try not to get mad at them over that but but if you lie about it if you try to cover it up that's the problem we want our kids to be able to talk to us you can be so legalistic you know and and come down so hard on people when they do wrong that they'll never there'll be times your kids do wrong they need to come talk to you they need to be comfortable doing that but don't don't lie it'd be so much easier you need tell the same story every time right and nobody's told a lie I'm not preaching to anybody that's just what the word says right as far as I know sir but they they have a thing called a lie detector he said you can put it on your wrist s it across their head you can get in there and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth it'll register negative every time unless you're some kind of sociopath right because the human was not made to lie lying is a deceit hard thing evil thing he said I'd rather have a drunkard with me any day than a liar he said a liar and your body wasn't made to lie no matter how sinful you are you're still a fallen Son of God the most sinful person in this city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son of daughter of his he said you're made up in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that he said no matter how much you try to impersonate try to make a lie seem right he said they got a scientific in instrument that proves that it's wrong you can tell it with all the Innocence you want to but it'll still register negative because there's a subconscious down in the human being and that subconscious knows what's truth and no matter what you're saying out here that subconscious knows that it's a lie and it'll register off the subconscious he said therefore if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with God he said until the channel of the holy spirit will be perfectly one with God what would take place do you want to see the supernatural do you want to see God move do you want blessings in your life maybe it's just simple as just telling the truth being honest with yourself being honest with God people usually lighted themselves first he said if the man and woman could ever get lined up where with the freedom from their heart with Faith from the innermost see you say well I can be saved yeah but we want to be have freedom right to be able to do the works of God you're light is your testimony right and if you don't keep your word you don't keep your testimony that's just the truth you're still saved but you told a lie now you your testimony is tarnished what do you have to do repent of that repent to the person you lied to yeah he said if I don't keep my word I'm not a man of my word if you don't keep your word you're not a man of your word he said I might promise you something I couldn't do it but I'll come tell you if I owe you something and hide from you I'm a hypocrite if I come tell you I owe you but I can't pay you but I'll do the best I can he said then you forgive me and help me he said we all owe God something we owe him our lives he said let's be honest about it brother Brown used this in altar calls he said you weren't made to lie he said Don't Lie To God Be honest with yourself if you need help look for help seek help don't lie and say you're a Christian if you're not believe the word and become a Christian and then stand on that he said I don't care what side you say you're on what you do every day proves what you are you've heard the old saying your life is so loud I can't hear your testimony see your actions are so loud he said I've always believed in shouting and jumping but I've always said don't jump no higher than you live cuz the world is going to watch that you must just jump as high as you live CU somebody's watching you he said people won't come to church many of them just won't do it and some of them he said not coming is sincere people they' seen so much corruption in the church until they don't want to have anything to do with it I say let's change that let's not be part of that story many times we're speaking on a flat thought of that you can hardly blame them said the way the people act he said they call themselves Christian the greatest stumbling block the world is God is the man and woman who professes to be a Christian and live something different from the profession he said now The Sinner The Bootlegger The Gambler the adulterous he won't be disappointed to hear his sentence read to depart to Everlasting fire he won't be disappointed but that fellow who's trying to hide himself behind some kind of church Prof that's the boy's going to be disappointed at the day of judgment he said always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform Miracles are we listening church he said always judge yourself look back and taking inventory of what kind of a fruit that you the life you presently live is now bearing yes that's what Paul's talking about brother Brandon preached what Paul preached yes Ephesians 4:26 be angry that's why you don't take scriptures out of context by the way take the first part of that you could just have a license to be angry but he says and sin not yeah let not the sun go down upon your wrath other words don't hold grudges we preached about that recently don't be difficult for the sake of being difficult right verse 27 neither give place to the devil don't give him an opportunity to get in between that relationship and cause trouble make it right verse 28 let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor I know you said brother Ben wasn't the world are you doing this is so simple I know not to lie and not to steal church if we can't if we don't preach this what are we going to preach what is our next Generation going to be yeah right at some point they got to hear it and I got to hear it we've all got to be reminded of it don't lie and don't steal still part of the Gospel huh let him the sto steal no more rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good he may have to give him that needeth and I I always I'm reluctant to preach this always because Paul deals with it so much but I'm reluctant to preach it because the wrong people always get the message people who are trying and I'm aware more than anybody of how difficult it is to make a living especially in our area I'm I'm well aware of that I I know how ult is I know how hard you got to work but I did it and and I've been there and done that I know what it's like and I know there's people that do it and and and a man's got to work just there's just no way around that that's our and so when a man's not working that's why I hesitate to preach it many times because you make people feel bad they're trying everything they can do maybe they're unemployed or they less employed than they want to be I've been there too not making the money they want and so that they feel convicted over that and and that's not or maybe a a woman has to work and she feels bad cuz well I have to work but that you know I I the way it ought to be many times it's not the way the devil set things up where it's very difficult to make it on one income I get that but we still have to preach the truth to our kids but you ladies shouldn't feel bad that are trying very hard very my my father died my mother's had to work since sin and and different ones of you're in different situations where you have to work and and you've got to do that to make ends meeting the family and I'll say this a Christian will work they asked they asked brother brand said should a Christian work he said a Christian is the one who will work right a Christian work a mom works even if she's at home she's working and I've told you many times before but if she has a job out in the public she has two jobs right Christian will work and but if a a man refuses to work he said working with his hands the thing which is good he may have to give to him that needeth see that's B basic Christianity and what we're doing if we don't do what the word says is we're putting a basket over our light now I'm preaching I want this Young Generation to understand this I think most of our generation My Generation above you know this it was ingrained in you to work but but I think our younger generation is kind of losing that a little bit I don't want to sound like an old fogy this morning but but I think we're kind of losing that idea that man was made to work because we got everything so easy anymore but it's getting where man managers won't hire people from their 20s and under they won't hire them and we've had experienced some difficulty with that even with my kids getting jobs because they won't hardly hire them because nobody wants to work because your average teenager is going to be on their phone the whole time right and going to quit on a moment's notice cuz they got offended and all of you who' had a career for any length of time you recognize you can't be like that right and again I'm not talking I know people feel bad sometimes I've known men who were on disability and had to be and they felt bad because they weren't able to work them more well that's cuz that's their Covenant that you were made to work but yet there's Grace for that God give you that ability and there's great I know some of y'all brother Bill sometimes goes out and get puts wood in that fire when he shouldn't but a man wants to do his own work right and sometimes for the elderly it's hard for even do that much but it's still work it's just part of it it's What You're Made to do and and so we don't want want to put a basket over our light we want to work the New Testament deals with this a lot Colossians 3:23 you young men listen to me you young ladies listen as well because you don't want a man that won't work he said whatever whatsoever you do do it heartily and that that would go for church too all right whatsoever you do do it heartily with all your heart if you're going to come to the house of God you might as well do it with all your heart if you're going to clap your hands you might as well clap your hands with all your heart if you're going to Rejoice you might as well Rejoice we might as well have church act like we belong here whatever you do do it heartily as to the Lord not to men and you know I'm not trying to make life harder on you say well if I work it'll be harder but no life becomes easier when you have money and the way to get money is to work then if you'll pay your tithe and fulfill your obl let me tell you something you're robbing yourself if you don't do that right that's what you're doing is just robbing yourself and you're not robbing me or the church God will provide but but we rob ourselves of a blessing but but a Christian will work and again I don't want you many you older folks that maybe you get out of a job or you get through a hard financial situation I've been there I know what it's like when the bank's about to take your house I know what that feels like I get that that's part I've never been wealthy like some of y'all you know but I just never we never had much money but I always paid my TI and I've confessed to you before sometimes I didn't like to I didn't understand when I was young the importance of it but as I got older I was thankful that I did and I still do and and there's a reason for that a Christian there there's things that you do see we live in a world where the devil's going to come at you with everything he's going to come after you and tell you you're not a Christian you don't belong you're not this you're not that he's going to come after you all the that's his job is to come after you don't give him room on don't give him space do what you know to do right do what you know to do and then you're not giving him room to come after you every moment and and attack you on what on your faults are you with me now we got plenty of faults without not just not doing what we know to do there's lots of things you have to deal you'll do things in life that memory will hold you all the rest of your life you'll remember that thing but yet the blood forgives you of those things the blood cleanses you from all sin how many believe that today yet that memory will be there you got to deal with that don't deal with this little stuff little foxes spoil the vine let get it right you can do that so if you if it don't apply to you don't sh Don't Fit Don't wear it but if it does put it on knowing that of the Lord he said you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ yes he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which you have done there is no respect to persons words yours is not a special case there's no respect to persons let's do the right thing again in 1 Thessalonians 4:9 as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another isn't that wonderful that's a wonderful scripture he said indeed you do it toward all the Brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you Brethren that you increase more and more that's what we're trying to do this morning I know you you you want to do what's right you wouldn't be here this morning if you didn't want to do it right but continue in that increase in that you study to be quiet but he's not talking kind of wish he was you know you just use that on everybody you be quiet study to be quiet but that's not what he's saying he's saying he's saying don't study to live a life without drama we can put it in modern terms to do your own business to work with your own own hands as we commanded you that you may walk honestly toward them that are without that you may have lack of nothing oh my that's what we want isn't it you say well what does this have to do brother we're in the end time we don't we shouldn't have our focus on work and these things when we're at the end time no that's the time we need to amen you realize where this is what have we been reading from first Thessalonians 4 who knows what else is in 1 Thessalonians 4 what's 1 Thessalonians 4:13 come on now well come on Church what is the rest of that chapter I would not have you be ignorant Breen of them concerning them which you're asleep Paul immediately goes into the Rapture amen it matters more than we think it does immediately goes into teaching on the Rapture right after teaching on work with your hands because he knew we'd need to occupy we need to hear it here at the end time it' be an age when men wouldn't fulfill the responsibility and women wouldn't fulfill theirs but there will be a bride that will there will be a people that will brother brand does the same thing and and knoweth it not he's speaking of the end times he said clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said now I mean he said like your house ritten and stuff and people immediately took this wrong he said I mean like your house and stuff you got to do it he said get all your things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something's fixing to happen the Bible says it this way in Romans 138 oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hasth fulfilled the law owe no man anything people Mis understood that he they asked brother the brand what about that he said now someone said should we buy a car or what should I he said no that isn't what Jesus spoke of that said oh no man nothing that's lingering death you could pay yeah so you got the money in the bank to pay it and you just don't right pay them boy got quiet right but been that's none of your business well I'm just preaching the gospel the message the Bible I don't want to be involved in your personal life I don't want to see your bank account I don't want to do that my job is to preach it that's right I'm not going to treat you any different I'm not going to look down on you this church isn't going to look down on anybody are you with me now we're all Sinners saved by grace but my I do have a responsibility to preach it so that the elect can hear it yes don't want to do it and become that he said that's ow and no man nothing he said it doesn't mean I we owe our rent our telephone bill good Lord we owe our telephone bill we owe these things and we pay them but an old lingering debt you could be paying on pay it off he said no don't go with anything hanging on you like that he talked about how he paid the bills for medicine when he got sick 25 cents at a time I found a news article about that about brother brandom and how he was struggling trying to care for all of his brothers and sisters when he was a young man God put our Prophet through that for a reason so he'd have something to tell us something he had been through himself why God calls men to speak to us not Angels caus men to speak to us brother Brandon went through a time he didn't have the money to pay his bills but he went to the man he said when I get 25 cents I'll pay you that 25 cents right he said if I didn't have it I'd go tell him I I don't have it this week yeah but what was he doing he was doing his responsibilities he said his good works he said some Christian here at church one time when I got some work done on a car and the man come down the man said I'll I get paid Saturday I'll pay you or something or another he never paid him and weeks after weeks drove by and never paid him never said a word and the man come and asked me he said it reflects against the church it reflects against Christ if you can't pay him go tell him say I owe you and I'm going to pay you I'm a Christian but I just can't do it right now I owe this remember it's on God's books too yeah he said you know that you do but look why he's dealing with it it's the same quote he said so that's he said I'm trying to for myself and for all of us together try to be ready yeah he said for we know we're getting near something very near something's going to take place so we want to be ready when the coming of the Lord is drawing so nigh now we want to be ready for that great hour how many want to be ready I just want to be I don't want to condemn nobody I don't want to look down my nose at nobody I just want to be ready every one of us can be ready I just want to be ready Paul famously worked the entire time he preached I'm so thankful that you all provide so well for your pastor Paul worked the whole time and he preached right did evangelized the world and held a job the whole time when he didn't have to they were fully willing to pay to pay him ties and he wouldn't take it and and he set the example that we should TI should be paid but he didn't take it he said this he said not because we have not power but to make our El an example unto you to follow us even when we were with you this is we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat he said for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busy bodies he said now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quiet andness they work eat their own bread but you Brethren be not weary and well-doing in other words don't don't look at it as a weariness don't look at something that's hard to do just do what's required just do the right thing you don't have to be a legalist there's times you're going to not be able to work like you want to work you're not going to have the money you want to have that's life right there were times Abraham the Bible said he was a rich man and another time brother brand said he was out there Hard Scrabble farming right that sometimes your life goes different directions many times good men job look at job job went through some things he was a rich man become a poor man become a rich man again right lost everything got everything back but what did he do he said I won't condemn God he said I won't Curse God I he said I I I bless him he said I come naked from the womb I'll go naked back to it back back to God I come naked from God I'll go naked back to God look we are all we are all we are all going home one day and I believe we're all going home in a Rapture I believe that's what we're looking for let's be ready don't be weary and wello but let's be ready to go Paul tells us what to do about it he said If any man obey not our word but this epistle note that man have no company with him that he may be ashamed and yet I love the balance Paul brings to this count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother so don't be a part of what he's doing but admonish him as a brother the darkness is pressing listen Church you said why why are you talking about lying you're talking about working and we could take so many other areas but the darkness is pressing those of the night the night is creating a generation of of good for nothing people that's right I just be not even good citizens not even good people in the community but there's somebody who will work somebody who will live somebody will let their light shine somebody will do what the word says somebody will provide for their family what do you got to do take the basket off of your life what sometimes that basket's made out of things we've been taught that are against the word right we've been coddled until we feel like well if anybody talks bad about us you know you know no take the basket off let your light shine the Bible says let no corrupt communication can we just finish this this chapter and then we'll I'll let you go boy are you ready for brother Joel tonight let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace to the hearers other words he said your language gives you away let even your words be light amen and and Peter when he was standing by the fire remember what happened he was standing there and he said I'm not a galileon I'm not one of them and they said your language gives you away your language gives you away whether you're a Christian or not his accent your accent gives you away you speak differently you can always tell which kingdom a person is from by speech the language of the kingdom of darkness and death is complaining and murmuring and fault finding and cynicism cursing and corrupt communication trying to Swindle somebody trying to make a deal that's wrong with somebody but a person living in the Kingdom of Light and life speaks graciously and kindly using words of Hope and Thanksgiving Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of Redemption how many believe if you got it you can't lose it you're sealed to the day of redemp so don't grieve him yesen Hallelujah sealed to the day of your Redemption but don't grieve him brother brandom was I I'll just fin that last verse be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you don't you want to take that to heart this morning brother Brandon saw a sign and uh he said I when I see something on the road he said I always carry a notepad with me so I can write it down he he saw a billboard it was just a blank billboard in the middle of it it said hungry with a question mark work hungry and then at the bottom in small words I said three miles ahead hungry three miles ahead and brother brandom took from that and preached a sermon you you let your light so shine before men and he said we're his Billboards we're his Billboards right he said just make them hungry amen a simple clean billboard he said it didn't have a bunch of fancy stuff on it he said it cigarette companies put some woman up there or something like that and beer companies that put some some half-dressed woman or he said some places they'll put a you've seen McDonald's signs had this great big hamburger with the with the grease glistening off of it you know your hamburger don't look nothing like that when you get it cuz they're trying to make you hungry yeah but see our job isn't to make people hungry yeah but to just comeing contact with those who are hungry right so this whoever created this billboard knew that the passer by if they were not hungry brother said if they were looking for a car they would never stop right because I'm I'm out hunting a car I don't care it say hungry I don't mean nothing to me he said but if they were hungry yes and they see a simple clean billboard with Christ root across your life he said men will see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven we don't sell the gospel I had studied this earlier in the week and then yesterday uh or day before one I had some uh some missionaries at my door some young men that are missionaries and uh they might have come down to brother Joel's too yeah they did it and they were young men I mean young men I was impressed that they were willing to speak to me I'm always kind to them guys cuz I you know as a kid just full confession Dad decided one time we were going to be missionaries you know and we went to our toown knocked on all the doors let me tell you people don't like that so we got cussed at and everything else you know I've also done cold calling and insurance if you've ever done if You' been in sales done cold calling you don't want to do that for the rest of your life I still hesitate to pick up the phone it's really a it's a it's a mind battle to pick up the phone call somebody it's why I text usually because I'm always thinking what if I disturb them because I had to do that and so many people cuss you out right but brother brand said we're not salesmen yeah he makes that point we are Billboards see the the missionaries that come by are trained salesmen come to our Sacrament service right but but see the message the beautiful thing about the message he never ask you to go sell the message come on and sometimes when we go overseas people don't understand what we do we're not walking down the street with a billboard saying message I'm a Believer sometimes you get your head cut off doing that if we' have done that in Cairo we wouldn't have lasted long right but what are we doing we're we're among them we went to the Pentecostal church over there and prayed for their sick right preached to them he said well you what are you doing we're not trying to be a Salesman what we're making contact and if we make contact in the right way and we're the right kind of billboard the hungry will see it and say there's something different about that person something different all church for 2025 let's let let let us be a billboard to the world a simple clean billboard brother B taught us we don't sell the gospel because we don't want overnight conversions right we don't want a quick sale he said he said I want real oldfashioned conversion a man or a woman that's willing to walk out and say I'm wrong I want to become come like my neighbor we talked about our neighbor I want to become like my neighbor I long to be a woman like my neighbor I want to be a man like my neighbor I want to walk so Godly before men that people think of me the same as they did of him I want to be like Jesus Christ how many can say Amen to that today I want to be like Jesus Christ we're not salesman why we don't just talk about it yeah right we're not salesman we want to be like Jesus not talk about Jesus although that's part of it that's not our primary goal we're not salesman we're Billboards brandom told about a lamp called a mogul lamp or Mogul lamp he said they told him at the power company when he worked there he had to sell so many of them and there was a contest whoever sold the most of them would get a prize and he asked them he said does this thing work and they said yeah it works it really works it's good will it smoke up quickly no will it produce a nice light where people like it yes so he become convinced that the lamp would sell itself now he says this he says I did never believed in high pressure cells he said I never did believe that he said I don't believe in these high pressured salesman stuff right you've all been in the network marketing field you know been around it but the brand said I don't believe in that where you you push somebody to buy he said that's the reason I don't believe it in religion he said if I've got a product that's good it'll sell itself so he he talked about this Mugu lamp he said I knew that the lamp would sell itself I knew it was a real product so he said he got 200 of them and he went by people's houses he said they he usually collected the bill and so they said are you here we already paid our bill he said no he said I want to he said I want to lend you something he said I got 200 of these lamps I want you to use it for two weeks he said then I'll come back by and they said well how much does it cost he said no he said I don't want you to buy it he said I want to just let you use it for two weeks he said because if it he said what if it got broke he said then it's on me he said I was willing to take that because I was convinced it was a good lamp yeah are we convinced this gospel is good are we convinced the Salvation that we've got is good so brother Brown put those lamps in people's houses he went around and he just he said use it for two weeks 200 of them he said when he got done he only picked up I think he said 10 he said I picked up 10 out of 200 he said I won the contest why the lamp sold itself you w't see it and see what it is then you want it yeah he said that's the same thing we don't have to have big organizations to sell Christ we don't have to have Highly Educated preachers and high polished people it's Mayors and different things of the city what we have to have is Christ and Christ sells himself oh do we believe that today Church musicians go ahead and come Jesus didn't send his disciples to sales training I've been through sales training I know what that's like Jesus didn't send his disciples to sales training he didn't say hide the good stuff we used to say in the title business that the the what the large print giveth the small print taketh away the gospel doesn't do that right but he told him up front if you want to be a Christian you're going to have to surrender your life yes the gospel tells of hardship it tells of struggle but it tells of Victory as well it tells the truth it is the truth he said I am the way the truth and the life he didn't send his disciples to sales training he simply said let your light shine go into the city tell your story amen you don't have to sell it it'll sell itself through you yes as we go into the new year I wonder if we could just as a church Lord let me take the basket off let me let me put the the make sure my lamp is trimmed clean the glass what was the Midnight Cry how many know what the Midnight Cry was arise and trim your lamps that was what our message was in this hour trim your lamps just before the going home time there's a moment when we got to Rise Up from our our our our doldrums Rise Up from Leo de sea and condition trim our lamps and say it's lamp trimming time let the wick be cleaned off let the glass the smoke be cleaned off the glass let our light shine make sure our life lines up with the word if it doesn't let's surrender ourselves to the word we don't have to make a big show of it just say Lord I'm surrendering to you in 2025 I want the world to know I'm a Christian he said by your work don't know by the love you have one for another lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps I believe we've heard that call let's bow our heads [Music] together Heavenly Father Lord as a pastor preaching this morning I sometimes I myself I
