watching I pray special blessing to them as well we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you can be seated for just a moment I wanted to say a couple of things before we get started um I want to thank you for for this the church bought this for me and his iPad and and keyboard and I appreciate that very much for the pastor appreciation day you may not realize that you bought it but you bought it for me and I I really do appreciate that thank you for that and Brother David for doing that heading that up um I uh had told most of you and I sent some of you pictures I didn't bring them with me this morning but um there was a super typhoon in the Philippines of course the news here uh in this country has been so crazy lately that we don't look much at what's happening in other parts of the world and they had one of the worst typhoons that they've ever had in the Philippines uh last week and so there were believers who were uh impacted by that and I got a message from a brother that I'd preached for there that they had had a a very large impact I feel like I'm echoing Peter if you turn me down just a little bit um they had had a great impact um from that and uh some of their houses blown away and things and we were able to send them $2,000 out of the mission fund um to help them with that that'll go a long ways in that country to rebuild it'll probably rebuild several homes for that for that amount of money and and I felt like we should help them and we had the ability to do it so thank you for your commitment to give to missions and to do that and we were able to help them just just over a couple days they had the money so that uh that was such a blessing to be able to do that and thank you for all of you who have given to missions to be able to do that uh everything we do here we have a part in other parts of the world we're not just isolated here we have a part over there as well and uh maybe sometime we'll get when all this coron virus passes we'll get the pastor there to come and and speak for us if he's in in the US able to do that um on November 22nd we'll have two Services two services that day with brother Aaron Oglesby on November 22nd with dinner between the services and uh I'd like for us to have a just a special day that day if we could that'll be the week before Thanksgiving we will not have service the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving so keep that in mind uh but we'll have two services that Sunday brother Aon ogles be be speaking he a great great preacher and then um we I'd like to have like I said a special dinner of some kind you may not want turkey but if we could do something you ladies will come up with something but may not want to spoil your Thanksgiving by having turkey the Sunday before um but we'll we'll plan on that uh remember tonight is communion but the Colby Martin will be with us tonight I know some of you come to hear him this morning but um he'll be here this afternoon at 3 o'cl if you can hang around to that service he'll be preaching for us and then uh um he'll be uh we'll have our communion service after that service and we'll give you a chance we're going to do foot washing but if you're not comfortable doing that I understand in the current climate uh if you're not comfortable doing that we'll give you a chance to be dismissed from the service before we do foot washing so if you're not going to be a part of the foot Washing Service go ahead and come to the service and we'll give you a chance to be dismissed from that and then we'll do foot washing after the service I want to say this in regards to the presidential election and I know that's the last thing you want to hear about this morning is the election so this is all I'm going to say about it but they uh have declared Biden the winner and he would be the first Catholic President since Kennedy of course they're still counting the votes there'll be a legal wrangling it may change but and perhaps it would and and God is in control of that but if he does get elected he'd be the first Catholic President since Kennedy you remember brother brandham thought that we wouldn't have another Protestant president after Kennedy go look it up brother brandham said that he felt like there would not be another Protestant president we've had nothing but Pro Protestant president since and you look at the time that's passed and the things that's happened he would be the first Catholic President and having a woman as a vice president there have only been 15 Catholic Supreme Court justices in the history of the Supreme Court six of them six out of nine are serving right now we're we're we're living in that time and if you look at what brother brandham the things brother brandham talked about and then you look at today those things were seeds then and it's come into maturity today and you can see it everything that he says about homosexuality on the increase about the the insanity of the people all the things brother brandom talks about now we're we're seeing it come to pass and and I I want to read you this quote brother brandom says he says this is a woman's nation and this is actually on the on the slides if you want to pull that up the first quote he said this is the woman's Nation it's the number 13 it appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes he said everything's 13 everything is a woman he said remember thus sayith the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time said she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman he said I've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her he said it'll be one before the end time thus sayith the Lord write it down find out you young people see if it happens he said if it isn't I'm a false prophet you said brother Ben what does that mean I don't know but I know this it's later than we think get your house in order like the prophet said set your house in order it's later than we think am amen it's about time to go home aren't you ready to go home amen God bless you uh stand with me and turn to 2 Kings chapter 3 and: 13 2 Kings chapter 3 and verse 13 and we'll we'll read from there good to have the Jacksons with us this morning we uh these kids um grew up with me as their youth pastor um or assist associate over there and and uh so we got a lot of a lot in common and spent a lot of time together they probably didn't want to come hear me this morning but brother Colby will be here this afternoon so if you can hang around and uh and come this afternoon that'd be good thank the Lord for good friends wherever we go and I'm glad for Fellowship too I believe we can have Fellowship without all the drama and without all the CR slighting and things like that I believe God wants us to have Fellowship one with another with the church churches we're all in we're headed the same direction and you know there's too few of us to fight there's not enough of us left to fight with one another we need to be one with one another so we thank God for brother Ivy and the church there and and all the folks there that we are so close to over the years 2 Kings chapter 3 and verse 13 and Elisha said unto the king of Israel what have I to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of Israel said unto him nay Lord Lord ha called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab and Elisha said as the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I would not look toward thee nor see thee but now bring me a minstril and it came to pass when the minstril played that the hand of the Lord came upon him and he said thus saith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus sayith the Lord You shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water and that you might may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning I want to title this getting in the spirit of Revival and brother Brandon makes this statement in making the valley full of ditches he said we can never have a Revival in shreport or anywhere else until the church gets in the spirit of Revival he says God can come and perform Miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and The Afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there will never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of Revival and so brother Brandon preached a message called getting in the spirit and and some of the things I'm going to say today are drawn from that and we find that in our text that the armies of Israel and Judah had been marching through the land for seven days and brother brandom tells us that as they marched through the land they didn't uh they went straight across country the Bible says they took a compass and just marched through the land in a in a general direction because they were so sure of their victory over the king of Moab as they go come along they realized that they had forgot to bring water with them and the land that they were going through was very dry and brother random tells us that as they went through that country as as the farther they went the drier it got so as they were going along that they would see you know the greenery and the fruits and all the trees and the beauty of that part of Israel but as they begin to get into the desert began to get very dry and brother random said that was that seventh day that they begin to see that that the farther they got the drier it got let me tell you today church that that's that's where we're living we're living in that time in that seventh day when at the end of it it seems like there's no fruit anywhere there's no um there there's no seems like no peace no joy no love all these things that should be there random said the fruits of the spirit were missing at the end time they were missing and and we can go back into the bride tree and talk about how that the the caterpillar and all these other these worm this worm ate away at the bride tree until it it it got rid of the leaves it got rid of the fruit it got rid of everything it was just a stump and now we see it coming back but he said the farther they got the drier it got there was no joy no no peace and Galatians 5:22 tells us what those fruits of the spirit are he said but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law during that seventh day you couldn't find those things during that time the love of many the Bible says grows cold have we ever lived in a time like that the love of many the love for one another grows cold the brotherly love that ought to be for among Ministry among the people among even families it's just not there why it's it's wax cold that that that's what the scripture said the King James version said wax cold it means it grew cold it slowly got cold it didn't just get there all at once but slowly the love was gone and that's the way it happens is as they went farther and further along they realized there was no love they go farther and farther along they realize there was no no joy even among Christians you ever notice today everybody's always either angry or [Music] sad huh unless there's some kind of Comedy or some kind of false humor to be able to lighten the mood right brother random called that whistling in the in the dark whistling in a graveyard because they realize that it's going through a time when uh you know when the world's going through a horrible time but now people people are either mad or or they're or they're sad all the time they wake up that way and and that affects us as well but Christ there's joy in Christ there's still joy that fruit is still valid today even though there's no Revival anywhere it seems like but that fruit is still valid that fruit of joy joy is even gone among Christians peace is gone peace has vanished as we travel along we realize that people are troubled constantly troubled by what might happen by what is happening by what tomorrow holds and we'd be so much better off if we just leave it in his hands we'd be so much better off if we just let him drive right you know how that is when you sit there I had a my older brother when we were younger he would never he he could not sleep while someone else was driving so we would travel across the country and he would he would stay up just watching and telling me how to drive the whole way well he could never drive because he was always tired because he' always stayed up while I drove and and driving out west and and places where we would go and and it always irritated me because he he's so stressful about it but that's the way we live our lives sometimes God's in the driver's seat and we're sitting there trying to keep awake make sure he does his job make sure he doesn't go off the wrong exit listen he's not going to take a wrong exit you know the the sanctity of the Bride the fact that there's going to be a bride without spot or wrinkle at the end time it's not up to me right it's not going to be up to me it's going to be up to God God did that and he'll call the ministry that it takes he'll he'll have a church he'll have the people there it won't be up to me to make sure it's all right are you with me now and if we put that on ourselves all it does is stress us out where we have no peace and heart attacks we find out on the increase and the Bible says men's hearts are failing for fear why that's the time that we live in and the people of Israel and Judah the the children of God found themselves in that condition and when they got in that condition josaphat being a Godly King he began to look for a prophet of the Lord he said surely there's a prophet of the Lord when we see the things that are going on around us we ought to look at a the message a prophet brought surely there's a word that come from God surely there's something that we can have confidence in that we can know whether or not we'll live you say well how will we know whether we'll make it the he's he taught us that the end time bride would not fall how could we fall if we belong to God how could he lose one as we talked about Wednesday night it would be a stain on his character to lose one he said I haven't lost one but the son of predition Amen now look jhat began to look for a prophet he said where's our prophet of the Lord and they said well there's one here used to used to carry El Elijah's baggage he used to be Elijah's servant so they went to Elisha's house because true Revival always takes you back to the word if you're looking for Revival go back to the word now when they got there though it's interesting because Elisha wasn't in the mood or the frame of mind to be able to receive them like he should have so Elisha's got a bad case of the Monday doldrums or whatever we might call it the Monday [Music] blues he's not happy and there's several reasons for it and the first being because he's a human being and the fact is the number one reason why and you can write this down or just keep it in your mind whatever but the number one reason why that you have to get in the spirit is because you're in the flesh we live in the flesh right that's where we operate and so we have to get in the spirit or we have a problem because the flesh is always with us right and every day you find yourself having to battle back out of that every day you find yourself having to work your way back out of that so the flesh is always there now so his Humanity caused him to be able to have to get in the spirit now brother brand says this in the church age book he said have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world he said they go to their ball games their sporting events their dances they enter into the spirit of it and brother bandom talks about about that how that if you were a person who going to a dance he said and wouldn't dance he wouldn't get in the spirit of it you wouldn't go that's why a lot of people don't go to church they don't get ever get in the spirit of it don't ever get in the spirit so they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers he said old dried up sticks right who goes to a place like that let me tell you this I I don't want to make people come to church I want you to want to be here I have to make be here it doesn't do you any good anyhow right if I had to if I had to convince you and force you to come then and the word ought to do that I shouldn't have to do that the word ought to convince us we ought to be in the house of God and I know it's not always easy especially the the link that some of you have to drive and different things that you do but there's something in your heart why do you do that because there's something inside of you you you're in the spirit of it you want to be part of it and so brother B said they enter right into the feel of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the Christians for getting into this Spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval he said but ignore that ignore that you can expect it knowing where it is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship he said our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord amen he said the Christian listen ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its Pleasures now that's saying something I remember some years ago I was at someone's house I was watching a a ball game and they had a ball game on and it was a playoff game and it was very cold very very cold and I'll never forget that because it was something like they kept showing the temperature it was it was minus it was under 0 deg and it was in Green Bay actually and and I think it was if I remember right it was Brett Favre's last game and I remember it because of this that there were people in the stands who had painted their chests and these guys had painted them Green Bay or Packers whatever that it was on their chest and they took their shirt off in that freezing weather and and the whole game the the camera kept going back to these guys that that had their shirts off in this weather and I'm thinking you guys are crazy you would have to be absolutely crazy and maybe they were just a little bit inebriated to do that but they were in the spirit of it I mean what possessed them you think about that you get up in the morning say today I'm GNA go out in the cold and I'm going to I'm going to paint take off my shirt and paint my body a certain color because I want to support my team they paint their face and their body and everything else why they're in the spirit of that they spend thousands of dollars on it they they spent all this money to buy a ticket and to go and to be there and then they sit to the cold and the rain and the wind and then that team lost and see we we are on the winning side and we haven't asked nobody to take your shirt off and paint ask you to take the paint off we haven't asked you to do anything like that all we ask you to do is come sit in the presence of the Lord receive from God you don't you come to church and God just gives and gives and gives and gives blessings to you and people say well I just don't want to go I'd rather because you're not in the spirit of it but now brother says both Christians and the world are human remember Elisha is human that's why he has to get in the spirit both Christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christians hearts and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh Elisha's Humanity got in the way it caused him to be angry I think it's important that we don't blame God for our nature I've said that before but it's something I've always I was convinced at a young age that it was important that I didn't blame God for what I did wrong right or accuse him of blessing something that was not right I'm not going to accuse him of blessing something that is sin right and most of the time now I don't say all the time because we've seen it before where you know and brother brandom talks about how Jesus Took the the Whip and you know he could do that I don't know of another person on the earth that could do that not get in the flesh he didn't never sin and there is a place for righteous indignation in one place brother brand said Elisha had that righteous indignation but even that righteous indignation took him out of the spirit of God so he had to have you know and and we get to thinking that well it's just the way I am God Made Me This Way well that's true to a point but you you know Satan sprayed that spray over you and and whatever you have if you got a temper that's out of control that's not God right if you're arrogant that's not a virtue right if you can't get along with people that's not you being a some kind of prophet or something it's just you being car cuz even when the prophets had that problem it was them being carnal right and so brother brandom tells us about Elisha and the children is a good example that Elisha when those kids come out and said oh Baldhead and and Elisha put a curse on those children in the name of the Lord and before they got home he said two she Bears killed 42 innocent children he said now that ain't the nature of the Holy Spirit he said but it was the prophet angered and even God backed it up sure cuz because he was still a prophet absolutely he was still a prophet but it was the prophet anger it wasn't the nature of the Holy Spirit you take brother brandham gave us that example of the attorneys you look at that and say why would brother brandham tell us that well I think it's wonderful that he told us that because it tells us that how honest he was and also how timid the holy spirit is that brother brandom says something that we wouldn't maybe even think about but I was always careful because brother brand told that story in business because everywhere I've ever worked in an office the manager the boss whoever it was would do that they would say tell them I'm not here everywhere I've ever worked somebody called they didn't want to talk to so every time you call in somewhere want to talk to somebody they're not here you wonder why are they never at office because they've been told to say that and I always told when I become a manager at the office I told him I said don't do that I won't do that because I was sensitive to that because of what brother brandham said about it but brother brandham talks about how that those attorneys called to tell him I'm not here and he went out the door which was strictly true he wasn't there no more but it was it was a white lie we might say brother random went to pray for a young a child to be healed and couldn't pray for them think about this for a minute a prophet of God with a gift of healing and everything else but he didn't push through that he went back and went and prayed for hours and hours until he finally broke through and then he was able to go back can pray for that child Elisha had to get quiet in his spirit before he could get in the spirit of God and this is important brother brother sister the trouble of it is today that people don't have time to get before God and get still they got so many things to do they belong to this they got to do this they got to have this they got to go there we could fill that in the blanks couldn't we we've got so many things to do we belong to this we got to do this we got to have this you got to go there he said you you don't have time you don't have time brother brandom has always struck me brother brandom said that those priests that invited Jesus and didn't wash his feet he said those priests actually got too busy doing spiritual things doing things that were supposedly good things talking to each other and about the word probably and all these things but they were too busy to notice that Jesus come in with unwashed feet well God help us today he said the devil's took up all your time you got to do this and that and the other he said you don't have time to get still before God get quiet remember he said after all you're a nature you're a nature he said and after all nature gets quiet he said then the Dew begins to fall that refreshes and bring forth life and he says you are a nature yourself and when you get quiet and what he's talking about is not just to be quiet and not talk but to be quiet in your spirit you've got to take the time to get quiet and I have to remind myself of this constantly because those of you that that know me well you know that I I'm punctual I've always got to be on time and if if there's going to be something happening I've got to be there it bothers me terribly if I'm not on time for something and and it's just my human Spirit I'm a nature I have to get quiet I have to get away from that in order to hear from God sometimes said when you get quiet still before God then the de of Heaven begins to fall begins to refresh he said be still and know that I am God get get quiet and know get your spirit quiet so God can move we have to take a little bit of time I know it's hard but sometimes if we have to take a longer song service then we should do it but whatever it is that we have to get that quietness to come over our Spirits before we can hear the word because so many times we come in and we've been wrestling with the kids and maybe one of them threw up on somebody and and trying to get them to church and you've been dragging them some of you drive two or three hours and but even those of you that don't you get up and try to get them breakfast and get them get them here and and everything's hard it's always hard and if you're having a dinner or something at the church you got to bring your food it's hard especially on the on the ladies you got to take it a few minutes at least there's no law there's nothing in the scripture says you have to be here 30 minutes early but take a take a minute and just get your spirit quiet huh get your spirit quiet let let that let that begin to soak in and let the word of God begin to come to your mind because you know you're about to hear the word and you want you want to be changed you want to be different you don't want to be so busy that you miss it what if he come by what if he come by this morning you ever think about that what if he come by and he sat in the corner of this church we were so busy we couldn't we couldn't wash his feet we were so busy we couldn't worship Him we were so busy we we we didn't we didn't even recognize he was there he come and gone you realize the Rapture will be like that one day it won't be this big event World shaken event it'll be just one here and one there one and they'll just be gone take take a minute and recognize his presence he's here with us and the other reason so he was human that's one reason but another reason why is there were three kinds of Believers there and the Bible tells us that the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom and so those three kinds of Believers were there the king of Israel was jehoram who was a make believer Jehoshaphat was a Believer and the king of Edom was not a Believer at all was an unbeliever you think about these things and you realize that Elisha had to get past that because he realized that he was going to be preaching to and thank you for praying for me this morning the Lord helping me this morning but you think about him trying to preach to them and realizing he's angry because jehoram is even there and then he's mad because Jehoshaphat showed up with him right he knows he shouldn't be ping around with him that's why he got himself in that trouble and then also because because the king of Edom was there what's he doing there and Amos 3:3 says can two walk together except they be agreed obviously they can't 2 Corinthians 6:14 be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with Darkness brother random says it this way he said you can't associate night and day together neither can you associate belief and unbelief together listen to this he said when you find unbelief it's accompanied by hatred when you find unbelief it's accompanied by hatred if you find Faith it's accompanied by love remember that that unbelief accompanied by hatred you said those people love me unbelief is accompanied by hatred if you find faith is accompanied by love love creates faith without faith he said why you can't have love now he said then this believer Jehoshaphat willing to give respects to somebody who had a great Kingdom and probably the prestige that this young king had in his day he said he before considering God or asking God whether he should do it or not he United his forces to go go make war with the Enemy not realizing he was hooking himself up with the with as bad an enemy or worse than what the moabites would be brother brandom saw that in that day as being the the World Council of churches coming against communism hooking themselves up with the Catholic church and he said that was worse it's bad or worse than what communism was right and now what is in this day the world and the church are just married merged together right and they they've hooked themselves up with an enemy that's is bad and they fight abortion and things like that but the enemy that they're hooked up with just as bad so you got to watch who you walk with where you Fellowship because we we need to have fellowship with God most of all is that right so we can't we can't just we can't join forces you have to be in the world but you can't join forces with the world now it almost got Jehoshaphat killed from lack of water now another reason that Elisha had to get in the spirit is because he was God's chosen vessel there wasn't anybody else to do it we could put it like that he couldn't just say go to a different Prophet huh he was God's prophet and they had a need and there was a True Believer Jehoshaphat that was among that make believer an unbeliever and see if we're not careful we look at the world we see all the unbelief and the things that are going on on and we just want to withdraw oursel like Elisha and we get kind of angry in our spirit and and he said he said if it wasn't for Jehoshaphat being here I wouldn't even recognize that you're here but now because Jehoshaphat was there the prophet's attitude toward these Kings would determine if they lived or died the prophet getting in the spirit I don't think we realize how important it is today whether we get in the spirit or not is going to determine whether some people live or die whether you're in the spirit when you go to the gas station might determine someone's Eternal destination whether you're in the spirit when you come to church might determine someone's Eternal destination so it's your attitude towards Fe brother bam talks about that and standing in the Gap with himself he said these Ricky and rickettes that have so sass the words he said I've called them Ricky and Retta he said God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because that's so many of them are still his children he said they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches who got them he said that Spirit upon them they're in in much in prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love Jesus Christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that but the call of God must come amen he said whoever wants to March toward the promised land let him March we're on our road to the promised land are you on your road today he said let them come March we're on our road to meet Christ at the end time he said and I wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake a man can make it being sincere Paul tells us about the five-fold ministry in Ephesians 4 11-14 and then he says in verse 15 but speaking the truth in love speaking the truth in love why is that so important because our attitude towards the people we're speaking to matters we are God's chosen vessels of Mercy to give Mercy to the age that we live in speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body un the edifying of itself in love see we must get in the spirit because we are God's mercy seat on the earth we are God's mercy seat on the earth so if we are not in the spirit we can't provide that Mercy that people need what how did he get in the spirit let's look at that first of all he had to get out of the way he had to get his own feelings out of the way to help them Paul says he kept under his body and brought bring it into subjection lest by any means I preach to others I myself should be a Cast Away brother Brandon says it this way in perfect strength by Perfect weakness he said there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability he said if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so God can use us how do you get in the spirit get yourself out of the way uh brother brandom says once more they said brother brandham what is that gift it's a gift of knowing how to get William brandom out of the way so Jesus Christ can live through a vessel just get yourself out of the way we talked about dying to your own thoughts now another thing that Elisha had to do I'm going through this and I was just writing these things down as I'm going through but the scripture another thing he had to do was he had to recognize another man's gift this is important the Bible tells us there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit even the prophet had to recognize the gift of a musician to get him in the spirit huh he had to recognize that he needed another gift and and as pastors have to realize that too we need evangelists and and apostles and Prophets and and all these other things teachers we need these things and also people have to realize that you need other people you need another gift you you may not be a prophet you may not be an evangelist you may be a minstral but there is a need for you you now again there's diversities of gifts but the same spirit and brother BR says now you might not be the prophet but you could be the ministrel or you can be part of it anyhow to bring the power of God huh again he said in El Elijah and Elisha he said if you can't be the prophet be part of the minals do something to bring the spirit of the Lord down oh how our services would change if every one of us walked into the house of go and said Lord what can I do today to help the spirit of the Lord fall in this congregation what how could I help What Can I Do Lord do you want me to pray for the pastor do you want me to do you want me to sing do you want me to clap my hands do you what do you want me to do brother brand talking about that Minal he said well I don't know how to play an instrument but I got an instrument of 10 strings if that's all I can do is clap let me clap the best of my ability Lord in such a way that it would bring the presence of God down I've seen it before I've seen it where God where the the meeting seemed like would be stalled it seemed like that maybe at the end of a service where things were just quiet and kind of stalled I've seen one person get in the spirit of God maybe one person clap their hands one person begin to begin to worship God tears coming down their face when they do all of a sudden it goes from one to the other I I've watched one person get up I've seen this happen many times one person will get up and come to the altar maybe they don't even really have a need but something just compels them they want to come and and they come to the Altar and all of a sudden it breaks breaks loose and many people begin to come why because that one person was a conduit to be a blessing to other people they become a Minstrel if you can't be the part the prophet be part of the minstrels do something to bring the spirit of the Lord down and brother Mar said the prophet couldn't do it himself he had to have the minstrel to help him amen you realize how important we are all of us are to the service the prophet couldn't do it himself listen to me the majority of the way a service is going to go depends much more on what happens out here than what happens up here it depends much more on what happens in the fuse than what happens over there I can prove that to you because I've been overseas and I've been to different places and everywhere you go there's a different spirit and there's places where you can walk out and preach with no notes there's times I can do that here right because it's just that atmosphere it's there but in America America in most places you can't do that you walk out there and and you you you have to push through that and push through it and push through it and push through that tiredness and that busyness to get to a place but you can go to different parts of the world they just don't have it it's not because they're much more spiritual than you are it's because they don't have as much it's much easier for them to get quiet much easier for them to have faith because it's all they got right but because of where we live and and we've heard it we've heard it over and over again but oh that God would help us to real realize where we are how much we mean to the service Lord I can make a difference today maybe if you feel the pastor struggling or singer is struggling or somebody and you just begin to worship and say Lord I'm going to press through for them I'm going to press through for them I'm not going to let them just sit by the side I'm going to press through I'm going to be a Minal to be a blessing to the prophet amen he was willing you know I thought about that Ministry I could preach a sermon just on him but that Minister was willing to be used he woke up that morning and he didn't know what he was going to do that day he's probably maybe just a part of the army just somebody who's called to Help the People March but he had a special gift to be able to play Maybe didn't think much of it but here he's he's sitting there in Camp that day and all of a sudden he gets a call the prophet needs you what does he need me for he needs you because he can't get in the spirit without you that's why I always looked at it differently you know people say well I I have to feel led what if that Minister that morning say well I just don't feel led to go believe I'll just stay home if I if I didn't preach every time I didn't feel led to preach we'd have a problem if you only feel preach when you feel led you would never but see there's things that you just have to be done and the thing is if you'll step into it God will anoint it if the gift is there you just operate that gift watch how brother Brandon would say that he said' no I don't know that he'll meet me he said but he's never failed me and every time he'd stand there and he said I'm waiting on him and all of a sudden he'd say he's here and he never failed to do that he never failed to see to see God coming down in that moment why because he was able right then to put him get himself out of the way and God always work through him and God will work through you too you got the ability to sing sing for god well I don't do a very good job I don't have much of a voice come talk to me about that sometime I got scars on my vocal cords you know and you talk to a preacher about that but there's still something in you you want to sing why not because you're you're not singing for people you're singing for the Lord and sometimes that means not singing sometimes it means not being offended if your name's not called right sometimes I can help the service by not singing maybe I shouldn't have said that are you with me now what Can I Do Lord wh what how can I bring the help the spirit of the Lord to come down on the service the third thing he had to have was music he had to get himself out of the way he had to recognize the gift of another person he had to have music brother Brown said there's nothing like music you know God heals by music said God heals by Music 1st Samuel 16:23 it came to pass said the evil spirit from God was upon Saul and David took a harp and played with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him where it says Saul was refreshed it literally means he was revived Saul got in Revival because David playing the harp he was revived by music brother brand said it this way he said Jess he got a son back there yeah he's a Divine healer sure he was he healed by music he said that's what he did he had a gift of casting out evil Spirits the Holy Ghost hadn't come in those days so he cast him out by music playing the words of the Lord he talked about the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and he talks about that Psalm and it Disturbed the evil spirit so much that they left Saul he said shame on you people that don't believe in string music he said no wonder evil spirits never like it they have to get away David cast out Devils by playing on his stringed instrument he said that's what the scripture says that's right and when David would begin to play the evil spirit would leave Saul I think about just the music and we think well it's the music it's the singing but it's not necessarily the words that produce the atmosphere that helps but the music itself produces an atmosphere don't let anybody ever tell you music is aoral it's not modern church is bought into that but music is not aoral music can be good or bad or it can be indifferent right there can be music that's neither good or bad there can be music that's bad there can be music that's good and there's a difference in worldly music and church music and and so but there's a difference in when you need the spirit of the Lord to come down you have to sing something that the spirit of the Lord is is pleased with and we could say it more like this there's times you have to sing or play something or hear something or listen to something that will get your spirit quiet not every type of music will do that and there's other times you need to be that feel that Revival you may need to hear a fast song right you may need to that there's something about that music that gets you in a certain atmosphere a person can change I've watched this over the years at the end of a service you can completely change the atmosphere of the service at the End by changing the music ever seen that people could be down here praying and and everything and all you have to do is start playing fast music and all of a sudden people get up and and people start rejoicing and there's a different atmosphere why because there there something that it does to our nature to our spirit so music in itself means something and brother brand talked about it casting out evil spirits so it's important what we listen to and it's important what we have here in the church that it would be Godly music and but we do believe in music and and this is what I want to get to is that you you talk about you say well what's good and what's bad What atmosphere does it bring right and that's the way I've always looked at it because you get started looking say well what what is this one what kind of person was he and what kind of person was she when they started in in their music and things like that who wrote it and that may give you a clue but when you get down to where who wrote it and all of that you may find out some of your favorite songs weren't that great so you got to be careful with that but remember what atmosphere does it brings does the Holy Spirit like it you put it like that now the Holy Spirit doesn't like rock and roll we know that what was the problem with Elvis Presley it wasn't hit the words of the songs it was the music the words didn't help if you ain't nothing but a hound dog but they're much more innocuous than anything that we would have today in the you know in the worldly music but it's the music itself and so music matters but I want to look at the positive side of it this morning he said I was talking to a man not long ago that didn't believe in music in the church he was holding a fuss with me about it oh the music belongs to the world I said the spirit of God didn't come on that stewed up Prophet until he got the minstrel out and be to play a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost song Amen he said and the spirit of God come down on the prophet that's right God doesn't change and if God Like Music in that day God likes music today and he began to play the song I don't know what they played in them days he said but I imagine a good old song like there's going to be a meeting in the air and brother Bram changes this song by the way so that he's not he just throwing a song out there is what I think he's doing because because he says only believe in one place another place he said the oldtime religion those are very different songs but he said a good old song like there's going to be a meeting in the air he said something like that some of those good oldfashioned Holy Ghost songs and the spirit of God come on the prophet he said I tell you brother when we get all the formal shackles shook down and the spirit of God and the songs again get back to an old place where we can have the spirit of God moving in the place he said then the prophet can see a vision then the powers of God comes on the church we believe that today he said you know singing gets courage he said you know that don't you he said the soldiers when they're going to battle he said you know what they do they play music and sing and things to give them courage and when we're going to battle we sing and it gives us courage to go on Amen I often think about that when brother Brown sees the preview of the bride and he sees her going marching to Onward Christian Soldiers Onward Christian Soldiers oh my what better thing could there be than to march to heaven on that song now we find an example of this in second chronic Chronicles 20 I thought I would already be done this morning but thank you for staying with me second chronicles 20 and verse 20 says they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tcoa as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe his Prophet so shall you prosper now they had come against a Time much like Jehoshaphat was in they were in a hard time it it was a it was was a problem and this is Josh had again but he knew that God would move for him but now he he's saying if you believe then you'll Prosper when he consulted the people notice what he did did he appointed singers unto the Lord now it says when he consulted with the people have often wondered what he talked to them about they probably tried to find out who would sing and who could sing he consulted with the people so there's nothing wrong with that go to the people find out who can sing and sometimes you might get asked to sing and I think that's that'd be a blessing man if I was ever asked to sing I always had to write it in and have a affertive super secret campaign to get somebody to not they brother so and so requested him and sit back there I didn't request it I never did that but he he consulted the people and he pointed singers unto the Lord and they should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth for forever when they begin to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments against the children of amm and Moab and mount seir which were come against Judah and they were smitten and a prophet Prophet had prophesied in the midst of the people that day and said this is not your battle this is God's battle you've all heard it preached on before but it's it's when they begin to sing what was it the atmosphere changed and all of a sudden God be to work why they'd gotten in the spirit they begin to sing and to praise and and God begin to set ambushes against the children of am and Moab and mount Seer listen if you get in the spirit today if you just really begin to sing and to praise and worship God and let things go a little bit say Lord I'm not going to worry about everything that's going on I'm going to really just begin to Worship You what'll happen you'll find yourself in the spirit and you'll find the problems that you had being ambushed by God Amen the Bible say when they got down to the battlefield all they found was dead bodies and stuff to pick up loot all they found was dead bodies in gold and silver and diamonds all around because that's what God does he'll turn your problem into a into a promise into a blessing why why does he do it because you got out of the way they begin to sing in praise and the Holy Spirit come down now what were the results of Elisha getting in his Spirit he had a vision he could see and the results of getting in the spirit if you get in the spirit of Revival you can see the vision of Revival as we've said the vision of a possibility and he said thus sayth the Lord make this Valley full of ditches thus sayith the Lord You shall not see wind neither shall you see rain other words you won't see it coming or how it comes yet that Valley should be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and Elisha told Jehoshaphat and them dig this place full of ditches listen to this he said the deeper you dig the the more room you're going to have for water God help us today the deeper you dig the more room you're going to have for water I think we got our shovels out but we didn't dig very deep I used to catch catfish bunch of catfish and skin them on the tree and I'd leave the I shouldn't probably tell this what I've done to my kids but I I'd leave the remains of the catfish and my kid Peter had to bury them cuz we lived in town and you couldn't just leave them out to throw them somewhere so I left him out in the backyard and Peter had to bury them and the first couple times he did that it stunk he didn't bury them deep enough right the cats go out there and the dogs and scratch up and he just put a little bit of dirt over his top and said Son you got a dick if you're going to bury catfish where you can't smell it anymore you got a dick if you're going to have a a big enough hole a big enough ditch to have some water you've got to dig and he saids the deeper that you dig the more room you're going to have for water amen he said in the more of our own selves what are you digging out by the same you're digging out yourself amen the more of our own selves of our own of the own rubbish of our own abilities that we can throw out of us you say I'm so good at doing this I'm so wonderful no throw that out dig that out dig out your own abilities the more of our own abilities of our own rubbish of our own abilities we can throw out of us the more room there will be to be filled by the spirit of God long as we can do that he says that's what we need dig dig dig it out you want Revival we want Revival we preached about it for weeks and weeks now let's dig those disches let's dig said well I dug a little bit dig them deeper the deeper you dig the more water you'll have amen what did the prophet see in the vision brother B said what did he see he saw a vision of that spiritual rock that Moses had already smitten and been speaking to he had just spoke to that rock and it was ready to pour forth the water when ditches was made for it to run in listen our job is not to bring the water that's not what we can't do that but our job is to get the atmosphere right to get in the spirit and dig the ditches get in the spirit and dig out the ditches get in the spirit and get rid of our own cells of our own rubbish of our own abilities and let the water flow amen what do they have when they got done they had Victory Second Kings 3:21 I'm closing in just a moment when all the moabites heard the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on Armor and upward and stood in the Border they rose up early in the morning and the sun Shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood they said this is blood the kings are surely slain they have smitten one another now therefore Moab to the spoil can you imagine the moabites each one of them threw their weapons down grabbed a wheelbarrow head down to the camp of Israel all they're already dead that's what the devil thinks about you today it's what the devil thinks about the bride today oh they're already dead look at them they can't have Revival they can't worship God they can't do nothing but sit like a up on a pickle look at them we're going to go down there I see blood but they didn't realize the blood was a sign that God had already blessed them the blood was a sign not not that they' been they died but they God had already shed the blood for them oh my don't you see that's a sign today the people see the weakness but we see the strength of God they went down there with their wheelbarrows and the children of Israel rose up against them and began to Smite them and they they they got rid of Moab like never before they went forward spining the moabites why because they were willing to get in the spirit and listen to God and do what God Said you want to have a Revival grab a shovel get your harp get your instrument of 10 strings bring your digging tools your instrument of 10 strings Revival will come amen you love him this morning amen we'll have another service at 3:00 let's give the Lord a hand this morning amen amen do you love him 's that instrument of 10 strings musicians come amen amen let's Stand Together bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your word and your promise Lord if we need a Revival we need to dig God is as even myself I know I've seen you do it so many times I can be feeling so terrible and walk into the pulpit and I feel that anointing on me and I can preach Lord but I need to have to get in your Spirit to do that I pray God that you would just speak to every heart may they just get themselves out of the way Lord and let you during this service now and the one this afternoon Lord we don't have to be here for a long time but God I know that you can move if we'll just take a moment get our Spirits quiet before you Lord and that you can just speak to us Lord as brother Kobe comes and ministers this afternoon May there just be a a reality of your presence Among Us God thank you for all that you
