TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but what altar calls what do we do with an altar call are they necessary i've got good friends good friends in this message that would never make an altar call because they believe brother branham was against them brother brown was against altar calls and there are quotes that and i'll read some to you that make it sound like that but you know if you go back to the scripture let's go back to acts chapter 2 and verse 36 you know the call at pentecost and think with me for a moment the call was the sermon right it was not peter saying to the people you know begging them to come to an altar but the call was the sermon itself peter magnificently and during that sermon proved who jesus was and that they were guilty now if you have more preaching like that you'd have more altar calls just spontaneously right because he proved who jesus was he said this is the messiah and you crucified him that's a hard thing to take isn't it this is the messiah this is the god i think our kids need to hear that i think us adults sometimes need to hear it this is the messiah here's the word and with your life the way that you live you crucify oh god aren't you glad for a bride who lived the word aren't you glad to be the bride that will live the word amen no we're not perfect in our own sight but we're perfect in his eyes but people need to be proved who jesus is and and or prove to them who jesus is and that they are guilty of his death and so in acts 2 36 peter says therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ now when he said that now isn't that a powerful statement my goodness and look what they did when they heard this they were pricked in their heart they felt conviction and they said to peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do now i imagine that they probably come to the front to ask that there may have been in the back i don't know but there was at least 3 000 people there because 3 000 people got saved and so you might have had somebody hollering from the back men and brethren what shall we do right it could have happened but i imagine that many of them come to the to the soapbox right peter's standing there on his soapbox and the people run up to him and they said brother peter what shall we do to be saved give us instructions what shall we do to be saved your name's joel not peter but what shall we do to be saved what can i do about my condition that's a real altar call what can i do about it it's people getting convicted enough that they know what they've been doing is wrong i tell you what sometimes we christians need to be convicted about what we've been doing and we need to find ourselves on an altar of prayers sometimes convicted are y'all with me this morning men and brethren what shall we do they came and asked for instructions and peter gave it to him he said repent and be baptized repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now many people kneel at an altar we don't we don't actually have an altar here this is a platform and but we have a place here where people can kneel and if you want to kneel you don't have to kneel but kneeling is an act of submission it isn't required but there's plenty of biblical examples in daniel chapter 6 and verse 10 when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before god as he did of four times so we know that when daniel prayed he knelt now most jews in the old testament when they prayed they prayed standing up but the altar call that we know as we know it came into being in the second great awakening around 1830 it was a man named charles finney and finney at that time was persecuted by the presbyterians and the baptist for having altar calls for calling people to the front this is what brother branham said about charles finney he said charles g finney to my way of thinking he said was one of the greatest ministers since saint paul he claimed to have won a million souls to christ again in in 1965 brother branham said so therefore we know that luther could not get to it wesley and so forth the reformers knox finney calvin on down and so forth they didn't get it all but what they had was the gospel truth all right so they did some things wrong but what they had was the gospel truth they didn't get it all now again brother branham says this in 1954 he said now we have an old-fashioned custom of altar call bringing the people up to the altar now that's a long time ago 1954 it was old-fashioned then in fact today but but it was coming back into vogue that that was what the pentecostals would do and that's what billy graham during his crusades would have an altar call and the people would all come to the front but it hadn't been done it had only been done since 1830. before that they didn't didn't have altar calls the way we do it today but people would just come voluntarily but now billy graham had altar calls and all the people had revived the altar call and most mostly as a method to count how many people were there and also to receive them into a church of some kind sign them up so and that's not why we have altar calls around the message by the way not to sign people up right but it's providing a place for people to pray now brother branham says it's an old-fashioned custom he said he said bringing the people up to the altar god be praised for that he said that's a good old-fashioned thing that the methodist church started years ago it was good it's still good today but it ain't necessary that you come to the altar to become a christian they never had it during the bible days they just counted them as believers now if you've been convicted to come to the altar and you sit there and say oh good i don't have to go you probably need to right because you felt the conviction you something was told you always listen to that always listen to that if something inside of you wants to shout listen to that something inside of you wants to cry after god listen to that obviously the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophets there's a place and a time for that that's why we say at the end of the service the altar is open it means that that's the time for you to come for prayer whether you stand or whether you kneel whatever it is that you do but it is open for you you don't have to be a sinner to come to the altar you know in fact i've found many times when i preach a really convicting sermon that is many of the elders that come it's those that maybe have walked with god for many many years that come to the altar and ask for prayer want to be closer to god because sometimes we as younger people i'll identify myself with you we don't realize how much we need amen to to feel god to know he's there to have his presence in our lives once you live long enough you begin to realize i need god i need him in the morning i need him at work i need his presence in my life and if i'm doing something that drives him away in some way grieves him then i need to be in an altar but you don't have to come to an altar to become a christian you have to believe right and now they just counted them as believers he said they never made altar calls all the time in the apostolic age there was no altar calls they said as many as believed was baptized he said that right they become believers but branham did not believe in persuading unconvicted people to come to the altar and my answer to that let's let's preach more convicting sermons right because if you never hear a convicting sermon you're not going to be convicted that's god's method and so i don't do that and and you can't make every service an altar call but sometimes we need to be shook up right i'm not just defending myself here because of last week but we need to be shook up sometimes sometimes we need somebody to grab a hold of us and i i pray it's the holy spirit today and just take us and shake us a little bit and say hey you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing i know i need that many times many times i feel the convicting power of god before i even come out here on the platform why because god wants me to do something else he wants me to do something different he wants me to put my heart into it so i feel convicted when i don't because i know it's the right thing to do now brother branham says this he said i've always been against an altar call might as well say it he said i don't believe in them no such thing in the bible how can any man come lest god calls him watch he wasn't against people coming and praying he was against persuading people to come without conviction look how he continues he said how can any man come lest god calls him you couldn't keep him away you don't have to call anything god has called him altar call he said it was a methodist idea he said they get a hold of them and say john you know your mother died a long time ago ooh oh yes brother oh he said that's not conversion now watch where he takes this he said here a few nights ago we had a display in louisville of a woman brought in a casket laid upon a platform in the armory hundreds of people that run to the altar the gospel is not a scare it's not a sympathetic feeling it's a conversion of conviction and that's what they do i know the assembly of god church some years ago they had these uh they had these shows that they would put on and it would be hell and you'd go through this and you'd learn what hell was like and then give an altar call at the end well that you scared people right you make it scary enough you go through a haunted house you might get down on your knees and pray if you're scared by that kind of a thing but that's not a real altar call that's not that's not really a conversion he said that's not a conversion he said here a few nights ago we had a display of a woman brought in a casket laid up upon a platform the armory hundreds of people said run to the altar the gospel is not a scare it's not a sympathetic feeling it's a conversion of conviction watch these meetings he said these great evangelists he said even in my humble little ministry not excluding me he said sometimes i feel like a shame going out he said that's right what are we to do stand and make alter calls and persuade them little girls coming up there chewing chewing gum you see where the problem was it wasn't in people praying it was in the p the ministry con compelling people to come because they wanted numbers and then when they convinced them to come by whatever means that they got them to come the people weren't sincere instead because everybody else does it look how brother branham because and again i've got friends good friends that would never make an altar call have never made one in their ministry and i don't condemn that brother are those brothers but i'll say this brother branham did in fact the last thing he did in a church in a regular service was make an altar call this is what he said about he said the old-fashioned altar calls are out of style today but god still moves in them it's before communion the last thing he took he took communion but before that in leadership he said can't you feel it moving on your church god still moves in them look again modern events are made clear by prophecy he said my husband brother said how can you get fish in the boat that's right but brother branham you're against altar calls you see some of us standing up and say brother bran i'm wait you're against altar calls don't do that you're making a mistake but we misunderstood in the same way that we misunderstood christmas trees and we misunderstood we misunderstood a lot of things i'll just stop there we misunderstood now look brother branham says now he says we have no place for an altar call this is in 1965 and i'm going backwards almost every sermon at the end of brother branham's life he gives an altar call or talks about it he said we have no place for an altar call but right at the table where you're sitting he said the place is packed and jammed overflow they were sitting at tables actually had a meal and then he preached to him he said i couldn't call you to an altar there's no altar here to call you to but the altar is in your heart you're not coming to an altar here you're coming to the platform you're coming up front but but there's nothing special about that but the altar is in your heart and sometimes you do need to get down and cry sometimes you need to get down here or you need to get down on your seat or you need to find a prayer closet at home you need to find a place where the altar is where your heart can get in touch with god again because you've gotten cold are you with me now i can't be the only one that ever gets cold i can't be the only one that ever feels the lukewarmness of the age begin to seep in it just begins to creep in and it creeps in among us until we get to where we don't care anymore and then every once in a while i have to shake myself and say this is not what i was born to be brother brandon said the bride would by no means be a lukewarm but they would be on fire for god this is not who i am and so i get a whiff when i realize what god is i begin to realize i need him there's a desire there now brother branham says won't you let that little conviction that jesus christ is real do you have that conviction today that's conviction you believe jesus christ is real that's conviction he said move right up close today and call the rest of his body to you think about it just that little conviction move right up and call the rest of his body to you major him in your heart if he isn't there would you raise your hand and assign to him saying lord fill me i got absolutely nothing wrong either because i've heard it preached on the other side well a person raising their hand doesn't mean anything well brother branham thought it did brother branham thought it did but what is it when you can't have an altar call when there's no room when when in a situation maybe at the end of a service where it's not called for there's a place for raising your hand but there's also a place for getting down to business with god are you with me now he says now he said if he isn't there would you raise your hand assigned to him saying lord fill me fill me with your word and with your presence that i might live by you now he said so i'm just gonna wait now this is in invisible union and i've literally just went back three or four services he said i'm just gonna wait because there's many many around the altar now he said see maybe one of them if i held just a little longer there might be another one out there might be somewhere you say brother branham you can't hold people at the end of a service for an altar call you can't hold people because you're against altar calls but he did yeah see it was the way they were doing it we did the same thing with fellowship halls one time in the message couldn't have a fellowship paul because brother branham preached about playing bunco games in the in the basement or in the annex so nobody could have a fellowship hall and it's not what he was saying at all just misunderstanding it's what you're doing with it what are you doing at the altar call is there a purpose for it is it real is it something that is a desire it's something in someone's heart that wants to come now look but brother man would hold them sometimes many times you can find examples of that but here in invisible union he holds for a long time at the end of that sermon after preaching a long time he held them for a long time he said see maybe one of them if i held just a little longer there might be another one out there it might be somewhere in new york might be somewhere because they were hooked up on the telephone line he said might be in philadelphia in california arizona somewhere there might be another one coming pastor wherever you are don't give the altar call up now i took that as a personal challenge oh god help me don't give the altar call up now again he says in jehovah jair in 1964 i believe god is going to do some great things tomorrow i'm hoping he is that's the reason i make altar calls do everything i can to find favor with him yes amen again he says i know we all come up around the altar and pray that's no methodist idea they never did do that in the bible the bible said as many as believed was baptized that's right no such thing as an altar call in the bible that's something we added which is all right anything god blesses it's all right he said like they anoint claws there never was such a thing in the bible i've got handkerchiefs under here i can give you a prayer cloth but that wasn't the way they did it in the bible they took it from his clothes so really you ought to take the one i had in my pocket if you really want to be scriptural about it i watched your brother david terrell one time i don't know if you know him he's an apostolic brother and he was preaching one time just preaching when he had a whole great big old stack of them and they would anoint them with oil then he'd take them and use that whole stack and wipe his face with it and and give them out but really i mean to be scriptural you'd take parts of my clothes right they taken from the body of paul and brother branham would explain that to the people and then he'd pray over the over the prayer claws and send them out because it was something god blessed right even maybe it wasn't exactly how they did it there but it was something god blessed the altar call was the same thing he said like the anoint clause there never was such a thing in the bible they taken from the body of paul handkerchiefs and aprons he said but anyway you want to do it it's all right in your seat at the altar wherever it is the only thing apply that token to you amen then look yourself over and look what kind of a life's going on see if it's been applied or not he said if it hasn't then lay it every what you got aside and come back till the token is applied you know what i like to see i like to see this at youth camps i like to see this in church you know what i love to see i love to see altar calls i love to see people come you know what i really love to see next sunday i love to see next sunday because next sunday they wash their face next sunday they quit wearing the clothes they used to wear next sunday they come and and you can tell there's something about them that's changed they showed up at church next sunday why because something happened at the altar they died to themselves and many might come to an altar and never do that and they'll still have that wearing the pain still still doing the things they always did next sunday right now we're gonna get into this a little bit and then we'll close he said now we all know he said to the birth he said i don't care where it is or where abouts he said if it's a mess if a baby's born on a shut pile on a hard floor or in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow birth of a calf birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy you wouldn't believe how starchy people get and how easy it is for people to get starchy you get comfortable sitting back and doing a certain thing every sunday reacting in the same way to the word it's like this and i'm not i'd rather have that than this right but you get starchy right but a new birth is nothing less than a mess you're gonna have to break out of that starch to be born again that's true now he says he says if it's a mess he said nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy we'll go over where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't bawl and cry and beat on the altar and cry out he said you want to be too human what a powerful statement you want to be too human you're two i know preachers who are too careful about how they look well i'm not joel's got me going to the gym on monday so put me on a diet see if i last you'll know next sunday you want to be too human you you're stiff and you you look good and everything the time's just right and i admire some of you look really good but sometimes you just need to be a mess sometimes you need to get in a place where you're just a mess you can't keep the tears from coming you can't keep your hand from going up you can't keep from walking around like staggering like a drunk man you can't keep from worshiping that's what i want to see not because somebody worked it up not because the preacher got loud not because we had the music real loud but because somebody is dealing with something in their life and they feel victory over it and they feel that they've died to themselves and so they're getting in a mess you want to be too human what we need is birth said brother ben i'm not that way i'm not outgoing i'm not outspoken i'm not i'm not wanting to say a man real loud you want to be too human maybe you need to say man i recognize god has a place for that i realize there's a place for that but not everybody's that way some of y'all go to a ball game you get real loud mr allison's not here today they may be watching i don't know but if if they watch this you know she i heard she gets real loud at a ball game if you get real loud at a ball game and sister allison worships in church too but if you get real loud in a ball game it can't get loud in church something's wrong reason why you're comfortable getting loud at the ballgame because everybody else does it that's true maybe we need to start a trend brother joel what we need is birth dying out that brings forth life amen brother branham never quit teaching that amen he says a man or a woman can never have new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead not just dead but rotten go look i'll see how many times brother branham says that in the message that you've got to die and rot die and rot you can never have new birth until they're intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead die out at the altar scream get all messed up to a place the starch gets out of your collar and you are born again by the spirit of god i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with its head off you're bringing forth new life but we substituted something for it we want the classical way he preached that in a sermon called a deceived church by the world you talk about being under conviction i challenge you listen to that sermon and see if you're not under conviction you get done listen the real altar is in your heart that's where the altar is and yet when jesus began to suffer with our sin he found a place of prayer he died on the altar he found a place to pray and look how would he subdue his own will to the will of the father an altar of prayer how would he wrestle with sin not his own but yours and mine at an altar of prayer luke 22 and 39 he came out and went as he was one to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him when he was at the place he said unto them pray that you enter not into temptation he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly what do we say fervently heated on fire he prayed more earnestly they began to if they were awake they could have heard him he prayed more earnestly his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest you enter into temptation prayer doesn't save you you're saved by faith but prayer is how you die that's how he died to his own will he died before they put the nails in his hands he died before oman he died before they they put the stripes on his back he died before they cut him and they bruised him and they placed him on her cross he died in the garden of gethsemane when he said father not my will but thy and in agony he cried out more earnestly amen he died carrying our sins when the blood separated from the water in his body and drops of blood fell from his face he died and brother branham told us and taught us that you've got to die like he died that's what he said the rich young ruler wanted another way in mark 10 21 and jesus looked at him and loved him and made his altar call if you could put it that way he said unto him one thing you lack let me tell you something that will convict you go your way sell whatever you have give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come make a movement take up the cross die and follow me he knew what taking up the cross meant they saw many of cross many crosses he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me take up the cross it's difficult sometimes i know some of you it's hard even to come to church i've seen some of you come maybe your father went to this church or your mother it's difficult for you maybe to even sit through a service because you have memories and things that went on but you got to take up your cross you got to be willing to be identified with believers i know there's people that watch it we've got people that watch every service some there's people that have watched faithfully for two years now every service that we've had they watch but at some point you've got to be identified with believers you've got to be willing to take up the cross of making the drive and coming to church you've got to die to yourself i'm not telling you that'll save you but you got to die you're saved by faith but you've got to die if any man will come after me do you want to follow jesus and you've got to take up the cross i titled this about water can you smell the water i know joel's been wondering this whole time where i got that from the harvey has two brother branham tells the story of a duck in the barnyard you've heard the story there's a duck in the barnyard he was raised with the chickens he's raised with the chickens and he's out there scratching around the barnyard he don't he don't know he's born to swim has no clue has no clue he's out there in the dust in the dirt but brother brandon said one day the wind changed i think we need a wind change that's what a revival is a wind change that's what the message of the hour is just the bride revival it's a change of direction everything was blowing out all the wind was blowing out denominational ministries and and and preachers preaching and everything was what man could do but all of a sudden the wind changed and there were some ducks in the barnyard and as soon as they smelled the water they came alive they thought they were chickens but they had to die to their identity as a chicken i'm not what i thought i was oh i hope you're here you hear me today you young people you've got to die to your identity as a human being when it comes to everybody says well you need to find yourself you need to be yourself you can be whatever you want to be no god wants you to be a christian he wants you to be what he wants you to be you don't know what your future holds and you've got to die to your identity as a human being and say lord nevertheless not my will but thy be done you can't do that unless you can smell the water i hope you're hearing me now brother man i'm saying if there's any of you got a duck nature we got a great big pool of back pool back here see he said if you can smell if you've got a whiff that god remains god i wonder if any of us can smell duck gets out there and he sticks his bill up in the air kind of strange he's got a bill and not a beak he don't know what it's for he's got feathers they can pour water on him it's like water off a duck's back so you get that later and he'll you know he's just different than the others he don't know why but one day he smells the water and there ain't nothing going to stop him from going to the altar i mean the the pond you understand that's an altar call it's not just well well the the people are doing it there's an altar call today it's we've scheduled one i'm gonna go and i'm gonna get right with god no it's when you smell the water you find it hard to go to church hard to do what god requires you to do as a husband or as a wife it's difficult it's hard and i know the flesh fights you but it's so hard because something in you just makes you want you take every excuse you can make can you smell the water if you ever get in the water if you can smell the water today you can get that desire changed there's got to be something in you to smell the water if you've got a whiff from heaven tonight that god keeps his word how many believe that today and he's a miracle-working god do you believe it today if you get a whiff that he's a miracle-working god and you haven't received the holy ghost yet smell the water the first thing he said do hallelujah amen the holy ghost filled duck if we could put it that way the person who or we should say it this way the duck that is a real duck he smells the water he smells baptism and then he smells repentance and then baptism and then he smells the holy ghost and he just keeps on going you can't keep him away from church you can't keep him away from the things of god you can't just it's not easy to discourage him why he's a duck he was born to be in the water and anytime anytime he finds it if you make a muddy pool if there's a rain he'll be right there in the water you may have them out in the bar in your heart brother caleb for years but if he ever smells water he's going to be in it because he's a duck let's see he's got amnesia and lost his identity like our dogs dog was meant to be outside i got a dog that's a squirrel dog but he's lost his identity another dog is a rabbit dog but he's lost his identity let him out of the house the other day and they went and sat on the porch furniture he lost his identity not good for nothing he just wanted to lay on the porch furniture because he's just so used oh god don't you see why we need to have services where we have the spirit of god moving because we don't want to get used to being on the couch he just lays there on that couch of election and predestination oh everything's fine i'm good i'm the bride people feed me come feed me pastor and he waits on you to bring down something and feed him but you ever get that let that dog be a real dog he goes out there and he begins to hunt you train him to hunt you get him out there after the squirrels he'll go after him he'll do what he was born to do oh church that's what we need to be doing we need to be doing what we're born to do not not doing what the things for the world are but what we were born to do amen we're laying on the sofa i'm in trouble now with the joel bail me out tonight we need to quit laying on the sofa i want to be a real duck can you smell the water he said repent from the bottom of your hearts continuation of that quote lay yourself as a sacrifice on the altar and you will be consumed of the world and born again of the spirit and be baptized in the name of jesus christ he'll fill you with the holy ghost go through the right process not come shake hands with the preacher put your name on the book but die so dead that you don't know the world no more amen abel died on the same altar with islam and the only way you're ever going to get right with god is die on the altar with christ until everything becomes blackened around you die there when you raise again you'll be the new creature in christ hallelujah brother brahma said this he said when god's in a heart listen when god's in a heart do you have god in your heart today you believe you do by the holy ghost you have god in your heart he said if god's in you and god's in a heart it'll call you to an old-fashioned holy ghost meeting lord of god glory he said that's right brother he said i know it's my nature hallelujah unless your nature has been changed you'll still listen to the cluck of the old hen but when you smell water if you're a duck you're a gone gosling hallelujah because you're headed for the water thank you lord amen i tell you what that's my testimony that's what that's what brought me in it wasn't any certain preacher it wasn't any certain church but i smelled the water the message of the hour i felt the winds change and the revival of the bride it began to come my way i didn't understand it all at first but i felt it and i knew even though i was raised in a message home more or less i was brought up in the way i should be but i was raised that way but i had to get a revelation for myself one day i smelled the water and everything changed hey man i was a gone gosling hey man i know what it's like to be a gone gosling if that's how you even say that i know what it's like to be a gone gossiping because i smelled the water amen you're headed for the water hallelujah paul said it this way i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live oh i'm dead to my old identity as a chicken but nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me hallelujah listen to this before we closed he said no a lot of people don't want to get the birthright because they think it's just a little unpopular they don't want to get down at the altar and cry a little bit or go without a few meals or something another listen whatever happened to people seeking the holy ghost i don't hardly even hear of it anymore you've got to seek the holy ghost and what i mean by that he could feel you the minute you can die but you got to die and i got desperate i told the lord i'm not coming out of this room it's a good thing he brought me out when he did it didn't take long but i had to get that desperate so i was getting mighty hungry what happened to seeking god hey man he said they don't want it because they might have to go without a few meals he said they don't want to do it a lot of the women he said you know makeup on they think it if they'd cry they might wash it off have to put it on again they just don't want it they don't want the new birth because the new birth is kind of messy it's just like any other birth any birth is a mess i don't care where it's at if it's in a pig pen or in the barn if it's in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess and so is the new birth of mess amen it'll make you do things you didn't think you'd do stand on the corner and be the tambourine sing glory to god hallelujah praise god glory to god while you act like a maniac he said that's what it done to the apostles that's what it done to the virgin mary she acted like she was drunk she was a mess in society but it takes a mess for life to come out of hey man you don't want that handkerchief now it takes a mess for life to come out of he said unless anything dies and rots life can't come from it do we believe that today unless a man dies and rots in his own thoughts christ can't get into his heart when you're trying to think for yourself now if i walk up to the altar and say yes lord i'm a fine fellow i'll take you i'll pay my tithes i'll do this he said you've got to die and rot right there to your thoughts let the holy ghost take over and just do whatever he wants to with you get kind of messy with him he said what was more of a mess than that dignified bunch of jews that day he said then to see those people coming out there with stammering lips you know what a stammer is he said other tongues acting like drunk people brother random demonstrated how a drunk person acted he said uh uh uh and he stumbled around he said that's exactly what they were doing they looked messy go listen to the tape i'm not making that up he said are these men full of new wines but after one kind of got to himself he said let this be known to you and hearken to my words these are not drunk like you suppose it is but he went back to the scripture this is that that was spoken about the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last day he says god i'll pour out my spirit upon old flesh that's the way the church was born first how many believes that god is infinite then he cannot change and if that was his idea of a church at the beginning that's the kind of church he'll have at the end he cannot change so how are you going to substitute shaking your hand or sprinkling or some other thing that didn't it didn't happen right there each one of the apostles went right back to that people today will tell you if you listen to tapes in church that means you have the token that's nonsense people will tell you if you listen to a certain preacher that means you have the holy ghost if you believe a certain doctrine it means you have the holy ghost it's nonsense you got to change you substituted something for it back then they substituted shaking a hand or sprinkling or adding your name on a book today we substitute going to a message church and appearing on the stream and letting everybody see that you're a part but you got to die to yourself and be born again in christ
