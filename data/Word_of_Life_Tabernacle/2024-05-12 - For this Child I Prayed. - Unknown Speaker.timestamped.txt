[48:48] so well and I thank you for doing that
[48:50] and I'd rather you I know what brother
[48:53] Brandon meant by that when he said I'd
[48:54] rather you treat my children good than
[48:56] treat me good and uh I appreciate that
[48:58] very much the way you treat my wife and
[49:00] my children and uh we thank you for that
[49:03] let's turn to 1st Samuel chapter 1 verse
[49:07] 25 good have brother Joel back with us
[49:10] today and those that have been traveling
[49:12] some others still traveling they slew a
[49:15] a bulock and brought the child to
[49:18] Eli and she said this is Hannah speaking
[49:21] Samuel's mother oh my Lord as thy soul
[49:25] liveth my Lord I am the woman that stood
[49:28] by thee here praying unto the
[49:32] Lord for this child I prayed and the
[49:36] Lord hath given me my petition which I
[49:40] ask of him oh it's one thing to ask it's
[49:42] another thing to stand there and say
[49:45] here he
[49:46] is here's the Fulfillment of the promise
[49:50] for this child I prayed and the Lord ha
[49:54] given me my petition which I ask of him
[49:57] therefore also I have lent him to the
[50:00] Lord as long as he liveth he shall be
[50:03] lent to the Lord and He worshiped the
[50:07] Lord there I pray the Lord would add his
[50:09] Blessing to the word you may be
[50:13] seated was also Allison and Stewart's
[50:15] birthday last week God bless you guys
[50:18] thank you for being such a big part of
[50:20] the church and doing what you do we gave
[50:22] the mothers uh the day off mostly a
[50:24] couple of them Sayang but we try to give
[50:26] them mothers to day off on the
[50:27] instruments today and thank you for
[50:30] doing all that you
[50:31] do ever since these words were written
[50:34] in scripture for this child I
[50:36] pray mothers who had trouble conceiving
[50:39] or carrying a
[50:41] child and were finally blessed with a
[50:43] child have repeated those words for this
[50:46] child I
[50:47] prayed today there's seems like that's
[50:51] not the goal of many women to have
[50:53] children it seems like an afterthought
[50:55] seems like people almost look down on it
[50:57] that it's just you know it's it's not as
[51:00] good as having a career or something
[51:02] else but I want to honor you today in
[51:04] this that that's the highest calling
[51:07] that a woman I think could have is to be
[51:09] a mother it's not an afterthought it's
[51:12] not an accident children are not just
[51:14] something that get in the way although
[51:16] to people today many people they do but
[51:19] children are are something that's
[51:21] essential not only to the survival of
[51:23] the species but also uh in the church to
[51:27] the survival of the church it's also
[51:29] essential uh in in the way that they're
[51:31] trained and the way that they're raised
[51:32] so it's not just having children but
[51:34] raising children but but children are a
[51:37] lot of work and I think you mothers
[51:39] could could say Amen to that this
[51:41] morning children are a lot of work they
[51:43] uh uh they require picking up after and
[51:47] and and looking after and chasing after
[51:49] and and praying for the children require
[51:54] a lot of work I've heard that or read
[51:56] that
[51:57] uh the average mother spends three and a
[51:59] half more hours a week doing housework
[52:01] than a woman without children I don't
[52:03] believe that I believe that's way more
[52:05] than
[52:06] that but that's probably three and a
[52:08] half hours per child too my mother had
[52:10] eight children
[52:12] so but you add that up and and it's 754
[52:16] hours of work every year it means a
[52:18] mother with the child works on average
[52:22] uh works on average uh the equivalent of
[52:25] 3 months of 12 hour days every year with
[52:28] one child more than what they would
[52:31] without that child and and I'll say the
[52:33] burden of that work is mostly on the
[52:35] mother and and I think a man should help
[52:38] every way that he can I I do I believe a
[52:40] man should help and I'm proud of our our
[52:42] young men for helping their wives and
[52:45] not feeling that that's beneath them to
[52:46] do that and yet we're not The Mother We
[52:50] Can't be and and and if you go into
[52:52] motherhood expecting that a man to be
[52:55] able to do all the things you can do
[52:57] it's just not possible it just doesn't
[53:00] happen and uh with I was able to work
[53:02] and my wife was able to stay home and I
[53:04] know it's not always that way sometimes
[53:06] you struggle and both have to work but
[53:09] but for us she was able to stay home but
[53:11] I never had to wake up at night and and
[53:13] and take care of the baby and mama was
[53:16] sick if if Britney got sick she just
[53:18] went ahead and took care of them anyway
[53:20] and and I I never thought about that
[53:22] when I was younger now I think about
[53:23] that brother Mark I think my goodness
[53:25] you know she took care of the children
[53:26] through all of that she never complained
[53:28] about that and I was pastoring and
[53:30] working full-time and and doing that
[53:32] when we first got married when we had
[53:34] our first child and she was a young
[53:36] mother very young a teenager and and we
[53:39] were uh we were coming together but she
[53:41] had something in her it's just an
[53:42] instinct that's in mothers to be able to
[53:45] do that you were born to do that there's
[53:47] something in you and I think that ought
[53:48] to give you confidence as mothers
[53:50] especially if you're an expecting mother
[53:52] or a young mother you can do that you
[53:54] you were made to do that you're born to
[53:56] to do that and and God will help you to
[53:58] do that if you have a desire to be a
[54:00] mother especially to to care for your
[54:02] children God will God will grant that
[54:05] desire I really believe
[54:07] that and yet the burden again is mostly
[54:10] on the mother and so mothers many women
[54:12] today don't want to be mothers and and
[54:14] we find the fertility rate has declined
[54:17] since
[54:18] 1957 that at that time there were 122
[54:22] births per thousand women now there's
[54:24] less than half of that uh as of as of
[54:27] 2022 was less than half the birth rate
[54:30] has been cut in half since that time
[54:33] it's interesting that that brother
[54:35] brandham picks that up and recognizes it
[54:38] during a time when when everybody wanted
[54:41] to be a mother and it was culturally
[54:42] significant brother Brandon makes a
[54:44] statement he says he said they want to
[54:46] Mother dogs and cats they don't want to
[54:47] be a mother to Children anymore and
[54:49] people at that time would have looked at
[54:51] that and said brother brandom you're an
[54:52] old crank you don't know what you're
[54:54] talking about people are having more
[54:55] babies than they ever had but he was a
[54:58] prophet right he's looking ahead he's
[55:01] looking at today he's looking at what we
[55:03] see
[55:04] today in an era when it's when it's
[55:06] downplayed and now they even say men can
[55:09] be a mother and have children just it's
[55:11] it's it's it's stupidity it's it's
[55:14] insanity and and yet and we live in that
[55:18] kind of an age but brother Brandon being
[55:19] a prophet could see what was
[55:22] coming but it's difficult to be a mom
[55:25] and you know depending on your children
[55:27] too right it kind of depends on how
[55:29] difficult it might
[55:30] be I heard of a mother who uh uh who had
[55:34] three or four little children they were
[55:36] a little bit unruly and they were
[55:37] running around getting into things
[55:38] breaking things and I know we don't have
[55:40] any children like that but but they were
[55:43] just doing everything they could do you
[55:44] know and somebody was watching them and
[55:46] and they said to the mother they said uh
[55:48] do you ever regret having children if
[55:50] you had to do it over again would you do
[55:52] it again she saidoh my yes she Saidi
[55:55] love children' she said I just want
[55:57] different
[56:01] children I was probably one of those
[56:04] children but brother brandom I know
[56:06] that's humorous but brother brandom
[56:07] types that to the
[56:09] church he types it to the church he
[56:11] talked about a woman that doesn't want
[56:12] to be a mother he said a true picture of
[56:14] the modern church today neither does the
[56:17] modern Church want any of these here
[56:20] screaming shouting tongue speaking acts
[56:23] 238 youngans around her so the church is
[56:27] saying oh we want children just not
[56:30] these children not these messy children
[56:33] not these Born Again children not these
[56:36] believing children we want children but
[56:38] not these children but I'm proud to be
[56:40] one of those children today I'm proud to
[56:42] be one of those children he was talking
[56:44] about he said she don't want any any of
[56:46] them whooping and crying and screaming
[56:48] amen hallelujah why such a child would
[56:51] immediately put her out of a
[56:52] denomination he said if they had one
[56:54] like that in one of the churches why
[56:56] they throw her out right quick why you
[56:57] letting such stuff as this go along he
[56:59] said so you see she's pregnant with
[57:01] something cuz she's bringing forth
[57:04] members all the time but she don't want
[57:06] none of them screaming hollering
[57:08] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[57:11] that she thinks they are I'm so happy to
[57:13] be what the world calls miserable I want
[57:15] to be one of those children that love
[57:17] God with all of my heart and willing to
[57:19] show it willing to express it because I
[57:22] was born I was saved from a life of sin
[57:24] and I was brought to the house of God
[57:26] and it put joy in my heart and a smile
[57:28] on my face and a shouting of the king in
[57:31] the camp I want to be one of those
[57:33] children don't
[57:35] you hey man she thinks we're miserable
[57:38] but go ahead and think that because I
[57:40] know who my redeemer is I know he lives
[57:44] I know that he saved me I know he
[57:45] brought me
[57:46] out it would certainly embarrass her
[57:49] they would be embarrassed by these kind
[57:51] of children it would ruin her in her
[57:53] educated ethical scientific Society
[57:56] church that she belonged to here they
[57:57] would throw her out at the next Council
[57:59] she can't have it she don't want to be
[58:01] pregnant with the word because that's
[58:02] the only kind that the word can bring
[58:05] forth I'm glad the word is still
[58:06] bringing forth children I want to have a
[58:08] church where the word can still bring
[58:10] forth that kind of a child that can
[58:12] still love God with all of their
[58:15] heart
[58:16] amen so churches want members but they
[58:20] don't want that kind of
[58:23] member mothers want children but not
[58:26] that kind of
[58:27] child but to be a mother is to love
[58:30] unconditionally
[58:32] right amen churches want members but
[58:35] they don't want life all right they
[58:38] don't want life yeah and you know I was
[58:42] reading about chickens one time and you
[58:43] know they've actually bred the mothering
[58:45] ability out of chickens it's called
[58:48] Broody when a CH when a chicken is
[58:50] Broody it means that she will she will
[58:52] quit laying eggs and and just care for
[58:54] those eggs she's already laid
[58:56] but they don't want that they want
[58:58] production they don't want life because
[59:01] they're going to take the eggs and sell
[59:01] them at the supermarket they want
[59:04] production so they actually find the
[59:06] worst Mama chicken they can find it's
[59:09] counterintuitive but they want bad
[59:12] chickens they want chickens that don't
[59:15] want to raise their their their own
[59:17] children and the church today is the
[59:20] same way the ability to be a mother has
[59:22] been bred out of the modern chicken
[59:25] farms
[59:27] right but I believe there's a place I
[59:30] believe not just this place but wherever
[59:32] the word of God is preached today I
[59:34] believe it's a place where people can be
[59:36] born again where the Holy Spirit still
[59:38] Broods over the
[59:40] church it's not been denominated out of
[59:42] the church I want to say this morning
[59:45] thank God for Godly mothers who choose
[59:46] to raise their children and care for
[59:49] their
[59:51] children you
[59:53] know the Bible tells us that God
[59:57] I want us to think deeply about this
[59:58] this morning I appreciate the atmosphere
[1:00:00] this morning I feel free to preach I you
[1:00:02] know brother Joel went into Oklahoma and
[1:00:04] preached for an hour and a half on a
[1:00:05] Sunday night so I just feel freedom
[1:00:07] today
[1:00:09] to preach as long as I want
[1:00:12] to we won't do that I know you got plans
[1:00:16] today but the Bible tells us that God
[1:00:19] prevented
[1:00:20] Hannah from having children and she was
[1:00:24] a real godly woman
[1:00:26] she wanted to be a mother and God
[1:00:30] prevented
[1:00:32] it now that it seems strange to us but
[1:00:35] there was a purpose let's look at the
[1:00:37] story of Hannah 1st Samuel 1:1 was a
[1:00:40] certain man of rth named Zim of Mount
[1:00:42] Ephraim his name was Elena the son of
[1:00:45] jeroham the son of elu the son of toou
[1:00:47] the son of ZF and ephrathite he had two
[1:00:50] wives the name of the one was Hannah the
[1:00:52] name of the other was panina panina had
[1:00:55] children but Hannah had no children
[1:00:59] polygamy was legal in those days but it
[1:01:01] never
[1:01:02] worked every time you have polygamy in
[1:01:04] the Bible you see jealousy in the
[1:01:06] home every time verse three and this man
[1:01:10] went up out of his City yearly to
[1:01:11] worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord
[1:01:14] of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of
[1:01:17] Eli Hof and Finos the priests of the
[1:01:20] Lord were there can we stop and say
[1:01:21] something about this man for a minute he
[1:01:23] knew everybody knew that Hof and Fin
[1:01:26] were
[1:01:27] backslid everybody knew that they were
[1:01:29] they were doing things they shouldn't
[1:01:30] have been doing at the temple and
[1:01:32] everybody knew that Eli didn't do
[1:01:34] nothing about it when he should have but
[1:01:36] it didn't stop him from going to
[1:01:39] church he still went even though the
[1:01:41] ministry and I trust that we've got
[1:01:43] better Ministry than that I I I hope
[1:01:45] that you see your ministry is better
[1:01:47] than that it's not a bunch of backs
[1:01:48] sitting preachers but if it was I wonder
[1:01:50] if we'd have the the courage that he did
[1:01:53] he wasn't going there to worship the
[1:01:54] preacher he was going there to worship
[1:01:56] God and he was taking his family to
[1:01:59] worship
[1:02:00] God so he went he went up to the house
[1:02:03] of the Lord and when the time was that
[1:02:05] Elena offered he gave to panina his wife
[1:02:08] and all her sons and her daughters
[1:02:11] portions but unto Hannah he gave a
[1:02:13] worthy portion for he loved Hannah but
[1:02:16] the Lord had shut up her womb the Lord
[1:02:20] shut her
[1:02:22] womb the Lord did
[1:02:24] it and no doctor could fix that no home
[1:02:28] remedy and I believe that you should do
[1:02:30] all that you can do to whatever medical
[1:02:32] problem that you might have but
[1:02:35] sometimes God allows something in your
[1:02:37] life and if he does there will be
[1:02:39] nothing that can fix that but maybe he
[1:02:41] just waiting until you get to a place
[1:02:43] where only he can fix it so he can do a
[1:02:46] miracle in your
[1:02:48] life now we know that every child comes
[1:02:51] from
[1:02:54] God um am I be hard for my mother to
[1:02:56] believe but every child comes from God
[1:03:02] it's these other children not
[1:03:07] me all of them even the youngest sister
[1:03:11] Tabitha every child comes from God we
[1:03:13] know that because when Eve had
[1:03:17] came she said I have gotten a man from
[1:03:19] the
[1:03:20] Lord right God allowed that child to be
[1:03:23] born brother Brandon said you could take
[1:03:25] the honorious woman in town and the
[1:03:28] worst
[1:03:29] man if they had a baby it would have to
[1:03:31] come from the Lord because God has laws
[1:03:34] set together so in other words God to
[1:03:37] God belongs the issues of life and death
[1:03:39] he has he is the one if there's life
[1:03:41] there he allowed it and it came from him
[1:03:44] right right so every child comes from
[1:03:47] God the ugliest child the the the
[1:03:50] honorous child the worst child all come
[1:03:54] even the middle child they come from God
[1:03:57] right because God has laws set together
[1:04:01] when it happens God allows it when it
[1:04:03] doesn't happen God prevents it because
[1:04:07] he controls
[1:04:09] life now I want us to think when we're
[1:04:12] thinking about this about more than
[1:04:14] having children because some of us are
[1:04:16] past that stage thank the
[1:04:19] Lord but I I want us to think of it as a
[1:04:22] promise that you're holding on to right
[1:04:25] there's something that you need in your
[1:04:27] life something you want in your life
[1:04:28] something that has been
[1:04:31] delayed right and so it may be your
[1:04:33] healing it might be a job it might be
[1:04:35] your ministry it might be something else
[1:04:38] and so many people try to rush and and
[1:04:40] get impatient in those things but we
[1:04:42] realize that he holds those things in
[1:04:44] his
[1:04:45] hands and he knows the time and what we
[1:04:49] have to do is just believe and and move
[1:04:51] forward because he holds those things in
[1:04:54] his hands he knows knows why he doesn't
[1:04:57] do it he doesn't always tell us why but
[1:04:59] he knows why and to him are the issues
[1:05:02] of Life listen how David puts it he said
[1:05:04] you have possessed my reign and I use
[1:05:06] this scripture a lot but it really it
[1:05:08] really strikes me because that range
[1:05:10] that's your DNA that's what you're made
[1:05:12] out of he actually possesses that he
[1:05:14] actually made you the way you are you
[1:05:17] have possessed my rign you have covered
[1:05:19] me in my mother's womb the reason I'm
[1:05:22] here come on is because God allow me to
[1:05:26] be here the reason you're here is
[1:05:28] because God there are no accidents with
[1:05:32] God that's why we don't believe in
[1:05:34] abortion we don't believe in killing
[1:05:35] babies because every life comes from
[1:05:38] God sir there's zero accidents right God
[1:05:42] allows the the baby to be born right and
[1:05:46] I'm so glad for that brother brand in
[1:05:48] one place he says that every child is
[1:05:50] born he said it's like Hannah's child
[1:05:52] I'm paraphrasing but every child is like
[1:05:54] Hannah's child he said if it's here you
[1:05:56] prayed for it and God allowed for it to
[1:05:59] be
[1:06:00] here so it's a miracle even child birth
[1:06:03] is a miracle brother B said more
[1:06:04] miraculous than than the than the second
[1:06:07] birth than the supernatural birth is the
[1:06:08] natural birth because of all that has to
[1:06:11] happen for that to take place in Psalms
[1:06:14] 31:15 David said my times are in thy
[1:06:18] hand my times you could drive out of
[1:06:21] here and have an accident today God
[1:06:22] forbid and that would be the end of your
[1:06:25] time but only God knows that you could
[1:06:28] get a disease you could you could live
[1:06:30] to be 150 and and you be you say well no
[1:06:32] one else has ever done it only God
[1:06:35] knows right when your time is so it
[1:06:38] doesn't do us a whole lot of good to sit
[1:06:40] there thinking about it right and
[1:06:41] dwelling on it because my times are in
[1:06:44] thy hand the B said my time belongs to
[1:06:47] him I'm his I'm in his hand because he
[1:06:49] holds the time I don't know what the
[1:06:51] future holds but I know he holds the
[1:06:53] future so he who holds the future holds
[1:06:56] me oh if we could just remember that
[1:06:59] today we'd worry a lot less if we'd
[1:07:01] remember he who holds the future holds
[1:07:04] me he said patience patience some of us
[1:07:08] gets so some of us gets in such a hurry
[1:07:10] he said I think a many a good man has
[1:07:12] done that you get in too much of a hurry
[1:07:14] you want to see you want to do it
[1:07:15] yourself he said Minister Brethren you
[1:07:17] know from when I'm talking you just
[1:07:18] listening to this tape he said I'm
[1:07:20] talking to you not only to the little
[1:07:21] congregation here but men around the
[1:07:23] world many men go out impatient but
[1:07:25] believing that the time is near you try
[1:07:27] to do something within yourself wait
[1:07:29] upon the Lord patience is virtue if you
[1:07:32] can have patience it's virtue they that
[1:07:34] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:07:36] strength not they that try to get ahead
[1:07:37] of the Lord they that try to tell the
[1:07:39] Lord Lord I know you want me to do this
[1:07:41] and glory to God he said don't do that
[1:07:43] wait upon the Lord the Bible said they
[1:07:46] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:07:48] their strength aren't you glad for that
[1:07:50] today Abraham and Sarah waited 25 years
[1:07:54] yes
[1:07:56] After the Promise was
[1:07:58] given and she was already too old to
[1:08:00] have a child right when the promise was
[1:08:04] given so they really waited many many
[1:08:08] decades for their
[1:08:10] baby during that 25 years ishmail was
[1:08:14] born ishmail is brother bam calls him
[1:08:16] the seed of a slightly doubted
[1:08:18] promise the seed I love that the seed of
[1:08:21] a slightly doubted promise I love it
[1:08:23] because so descriptive of an ishmail uh
[1:08:26] every time we doubt the promise of God
[1:08:28] it produces something in our life it
[1:08:30] produces an ishmail listen it doesn't
[1:08:32] matter what word it is the word of God
[1:08:34] is true 100% of it's true that's why I I
[1:08:37] can't take any man's word over the
[1:08:39] scripture I can't take any man's word
[1:08:40] over the message of the hour why because
[1:08:42] if it's true it's God's word and if it's
[1:08:45] God's word it's always going to be true
[1:08:47] and if I even slightly doubt it it'll
[1:08:49] produce something I don't want in my
[1:08:50] life come
[1:08:52] on right so let me just believe it
[1:08:55] how many can say Amen to that today let
[1:08:57] me just believe the message of the hour
[1:08:59] let me just believe what the Bible
[1:09:03] says
[1:09:05] so and you find that during that time
[1:09:08] that ishmail was born during that 25
[1:09:10] years that then the birth of Ishmael
[1:09:13] made Sarah and Hagar
[1:09:16] adversaries right and Hannah had an
[1:09:20] adversary the Bible says in 1st Samuel
[1:09:22] 1:6 her adversary also provoked her sore
[1:09:27] to make her fret because the Lord had
[1:09:29] shut up her womb that word fret is to
[1:09:32] Tumble to be violently agitated to to
[1:09:35] crash of Thunder to irritate with anger
[1:09:38] to make to fret Roar Thunder trouble
[1:09:41] every time she was feeling good the
[1:09:43] skies were clear and she might be
[1:09:45] thinking well today is the day my
[1:09:47] promise is going to be fulfilled here
[1:09:49] come the
[1:09:51] adversary walking by with all of her
[1:09:53] children right right getting kind of old
[1:09:59] Hannah looks like looks like it's just
[1:10:02] not going to happen for you
[1:10:04] yeah she got older she got weaker she
[1:10:08] she got she got she tried harder but
[1:10:11] nothing seemed to work and and here here
[1:10:14] her adversary come by yes and and it it
[1:10:17] just like a a a beautiful day and here
[1:10:19] she just walking along in the adversary
[1:10:21] a clap of Thunder comes by and trouble
[1:10:24] come by yeah and it made her dark it
[1:10:27] made her fret made her her attitude
[1:10:31] different and it made her worry that's
[1:10:33] the purpose of the adversary and I want
[1:10:36] to say this today there's always been an
[1:10:39] adversary between you and the promise
[1:10:41] and there always will be as long as
[1:10:43] we're here on the earth the devil is
[1:10:45] your adversary the Bible says be sober
[1:10:48] be vigilant because your adversary the
[1:10:50] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:10:52] seeking whom he may
[1:10:56] devour see he's an adversary I heard
[1:10:58] about a sister who would who wouldn't
[1:11:00] speak evil of anyone she was just so so
[1:11:03] kind and and finally they said well what
[1:11:05] about the devil and she said well he's a
[1:11:07] good
[1:11:08] adversary and he is that's his job the
[1:11:12] adversary he is our adver we always have
[1:11:15] one as long as we're here but I'm
[1:11:16] thankful it won't be forever because we
[1:11:18] won't be here forever but the adversary
[1:11:21] will be cast down in Revelation 12:10 I
[1:11:23] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:11:25] has come salvation and strength and the
[1:11:27] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:11:29] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:11:31] is cast down which accused him before
[1:11:33] our God day and night oh he there's
[1:11:35] coming a day when he won't darken the
[1:11:37] skies anymore there's coming a day won't
[1:11:39] make a spread anymore he won't make us
[1:11:41] worry anymore he won't be there to make
[1:11:44] us worry that's good won't be there to
[1:11:47] accuse
[1:11:48] us we'll be delivered and and but even
[1:11:51] here the Bible says that he'll be an
[1:11:54] adversary to our
[1:11:56] adversaries oh I just love the promise
[1:11:59] of God today said but if thou sh indeed
[1:12:01] obey his voice and do all that I speak
[1:12:04] then will I be an enemy unto your
[1:12:05] enemies and an adversary to your
[1:12:07] adversaries you realize you not only you
[1:12:09] have an adversary but your adversary has
[1:12:11] an adversary oh you might be struggling
[1:12:14] with cancer but your cancer has an
[1:12:16] adversary you might be struggling with
[1:12:18] depression but that depression has an
[1:12:20] adversary you might be struggling with
[1:12:22] with with the life just in general but
[1:12:24] your ad adversary has an
[1:12:26] adversary and the truth is greater is he
[1:12:29] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:12:31] world your adversary will overcome that
[1:12:35] adversary when you have an adversary in
[1:12:38] front of you he said I'll be an
[1:12:40] adversary to your adversary I'll fight
[1:12:41] for you oh what a promise today when
[1:12:44] we're too weak in our own when we're too
[1:12:46] troubled on our own our adversary fights
[1:12:49] against that adversary that comes
[1:12:51] against us that's
[1:12:54] Hallelujah and we know sometimes the
[1:12:57] Lord actually stir up our
[1:13:01] adversaries do you know that I've
[1:13:03] preached this before but it just fit
[1:13:05] here you think of Solomon when Solomon
[1:13:08] come on the throne he said now there's
[1:13:10] peace on every side David had fought all
[1:13:12] of his life and and it was a a period of
[1:13:15] peace that was necessary for building
[1:13:17] the Temple so God allowed there to be
[1:13:19] peace when Solomon took the throne he
[1:13:21] settled all the questions and it was
[1:13:24] peace he said now the Lord my God has
[1:13:26] given me rest on every side there is
[1:13:28] neither adversary nor evil
[1:13:32] occurrent and it was
[1:13:34] necessary but without an adversary
[1:13:37] people become
[1:13:38] complacent it's just the nature of man
[1:13:42] you might say Lord why do I have to deal
[1:13:43] with this why do I have to deal with him
[1:13:45] why do I have to deal with her without
[1:13:47] an adversary people become complacent
[1:13:50] right and Solomon the great King Solomon
[1:13:52] became complacent without an adversary
[1:13:55] the Bible says the Lord was angry with
[1:13:57] Solomon because his heart was turned
[1:14:00] from the Lord God of Israel which had
[1:14:01] appeared to him twice and commanded him
[1:14:03] concerning this thing he should not go
[1:14:05] after other gods but he kept not that
[1:14:07] which the Lord commanded and the Lord
[1:14:09] stirred up an
[1:14:11] adversary unto Solomon hey Dad the
[1:14:13] Edomite he was of the king seed in Edom
[1:14:15] and God stirred him up again in verse 23
[1:14:18] he he he defeated that adversary here
[1:14:20] comes another one God stir him up
[1:14:22] another adversary Reon the son of Eli
[1:14:24] which fled from his Lord haded deser
[1:14:26] king of zoba and he gathered men unto
[1:14:28] him and become a Captain over a band
[1:14:29] when David slew them of zoba and they
[1:14:31] went to Damascus and dwelt therein
[1:14:33] reigned in Damascus and he was an
[1:14:34] adversary to Israel all the days of
[1:14:36] Solomon why God stirred him
[1:14:39] up right so there's this
[1:14:42] guy right he just sitting there minding
[1:14:45] his own
[1:14:46] business and and God is upset with
[1:14:52] Solomon and so he goes down begins to
[1:14:54] allows the devil to start whispering
[1:14:56] this guy's ear see God allows it right
[1:14:59] that's why the the the lying Spirit had
[1:15:01] to come the Lord said who who will go
[1:15:05] make these prophets lie and a lying
[1:15:06] Spirit come up
[1:15:07] right and and so they have to come their
[1:15:11] creature of
[1:15:12] permission but you think that guy
[1:15:14] sitting there by himself just minding
[1:15:15] his own business and he's sitting there
[1:15:17] all a sudden he starts thinking boy I
[1:15:18] hate that
[1:15:22] Solomon that's that's man he just get
[1:15:25] under my
[1:15:26] skin starts thinking like you know when
[1:15:28] you get thinking like that's the devil
[1:15:30] but the Lord allowed it for Solomon's
[1:15:32] good yeah right man that that's Solomon
[1:15:35] man tell you what the
[1:15:37] Lord stirred him up that's right and
[1:15:42] maybe even give him a reason let Solomon
[1:15:44] allow Solomon to do something make a
[1:15:47] mistake that would cause him to have an
[1:15:50] adversary right maybe and and we find
[1:15:54] David had a re of that because when he
[1:15:56] left and doe the Edomite come out there
[1:15:58] you remember started cursing him
[1:15:59] throwing rocks at him we preached on it
[1:16:01] recently he said maybe the Lord told him
[1:16:02] to do that maybe the Lord you know and
[1:16:06] even in the scripture and I know this is
[1:16:08] hard to to listen to but sometimes God
[1:16:11] himself becomes our
[1:16:13] adversary did you know that job chap
[1:16:17] 31:35 job's crying out he said all that
[1:16:19] one would hear me you ever felt like
[1:16:21] that yeah behold my desire is that the
[1:16:24] alight Mighty would answer me that my
[1:16:26] adversary had written a book remember
[1:16:28] this is before the Bible was written
[1:16:30] aren't you glad a book's been written
[1:16:33] all he had was the Stars remember that's
[1:16:35] all he had to go by just the stars and
[1:16:38] so that was the first Bible that God
[1:16:40] wrote but he said all that he had
[1:16:41] written a book surely I would take it
[1:16:43] upon my shoulder bind it as a crown to
[1:16:46] me I would declare unto him the number
[1:16:48] of my steps as a prince would I go near
[1:16:50] unto him and Jehovah would not given him
[1:16:52] give him an answer notice what he calls
[1:16:54] him back in verse
[1:16:55] that my adversary had written a book
[1:16:58] he's talking about
[1:16:59] God
[1:17:01] yeah but Jehovah never did give him an
[1:17:04] answer he just said I'm G to show you
[1:17:07] your
[1:17:09] Redeemer that's enough
[1:17:12] church I think of the SAR phenician
[1:17:14] woman you think about her the only you
[1:17:17] know she had a hard time getting to
[1:17:19] Jesus anyway right all the difficulties
[1:17:21] that she had to get into Jesus must have
[1:17:23] been difficult for her to come when she
[1:17:25] came she finally got to the feet of
[1:17:27] Jesus the Lord become her adversary
[1:17:29] right and she said Lord I my daughter
[1:17:31] needs healing and he said it's not meat
[1:17:33] for me to take the children's bread and
[1:17:35] give it to
[1:17:36] dogs but she didn't let the Lord stop
[1:17:39] her right come on right he become an
[1:17:42] adversary to test her faith but she was
[1:17:46] had that Faith was so great within her
[1:17:48] that she persevered even though the Lord
[1:17:50] said no yeah she still persevered yeah
[1:17:54] and and and what do we do when we have
[1:17:55] an adversary what did Hannah have to do
[1:17:57] we've got to persevere right we've got
[1:18:00] to just keep stepping forward keep
[1:18:02] walking forward he said but that
[1:18:03] adversary is against me but he said I'll
[1:18:05] be an adversary to your adversaries walk
[1:18:08] forward keep pressing on keep pressing
[1:18:11] forward keep pressing the battle now's
[1:18:13] not the time to quit now's not the time

[1:18:44] you that's good Hallelujah she oh my

[1:18:53] then press till you get to him how many
[1:18:54] can do that this morning press till you
[1:18:56] get to him like the little woman with
[1:18:58] the bloody shoe all the different things
[1:18:59] that taking place all the adversaries in
[1:19:01] her way she just pressed right on
[1:19:03] through she'll till she touched him he
[1:19:05] said if this church tonight would do the
[1:19:06] same thing would press through every
[1:19:08] scale of unbelief would lock swords with
[1:19:10] the devil in his unbelief and press
[1:19:12] through to know that you're a child of
[1:19:13] God and an air to these things and Jesus

[1:19:32] God press
[1:19:34] forward oh that's good I wish I had more
[1:19:37] voice and more strength to preach it
[1:19:39] press forward don't let nothing stand in
[1:19:42] your
[1:19:45] way verse seven first Samuel chapter
[1:19:53] 1 as he did so and I speaking of Elena
[1:19:55] taking her to the house of
[1:19:59] God
[1:20:00] year by
[1:20:03] year when she went up to the house of
[1:20:05] the Lord so she provoked her therefore
[1:20:09] she
[1:20:10] wept did not
[1:20:13] eat
[1:20:15] year by year brother brandham said she
[1:20:18] may have been 60 to 70 years
[1:20:21] old Jewish tradition says she waited 19
[1:20:24] years
[1:20:25] 19
[1:20:26] years for a
[1:20:29] baby that's not uncommon in the
[1:20:31] scripture ra Rachel waited 20 years
[1:20:34] Sarah waited 25 after she received the
[1:20:38] promise but see the Bible tells us and
[1:20:41] actually the rabbis take this in the
[1:20:43] Jewish thought they look at
[1:20:45] Hannah and they say that she was tested
[1:20:47] for 19 years because she was made of the
[1:20:49] type of material that wouldn't give up
[1:20:53] because material the time time that a
[1:20:55] material is tested depends on what it
[1:20:59] is this ought to encourage
[1:21:01] somebody the time the length of time the
[1:21:04] material is tested depends on what that
[1:21:06] material is so if it's silver if it's
[1:21:08] gold Proverbs 27:21 tells us as the
[1:21:12] fining pot for silver and the furnace
[1:21:14] for gold so is a man to his praise so in
[1:21:19] English Standard Version it reads like
[1:21:20] this The Crucible is for silver and the
[1:21:23] furnace is for gold and a man is tested
[1:21:26] by his praise in other words what he is
[1:21:30] is tested by the praise that he does or
[1:21:34] she does right by the praise that they
[1:21:37] do oh my by the worship that they have
[1:21:41] while they're being
[1:21:44] tested Hallelujah proves what material
[1:21:48] they
[1:21:49] are you said but brother man I don't
[1:21:51] understand why did I have to wait longer
[1:21:53] than other women to be a mother maybe he
[1:21:55] was proving what you were yeah why did I
[1:21:58] have to wait longer than others for my
[1:22:00] healing maybe he was proving what you
[1:22:02] were maybe he was bringing out of you
[1:22:05] the kind of Praise that he wanted to see
[1:22:07] maybe he was doing something in your
[1:22:09] life he was testing you for 19 years for
[1:22:12] 20 years for 50 years he was testing you
[1:22:14] to bring something out of your life come
[1:22:16] on you say well I wanted to be healed I
[1:22:18] wanted a miracle right away sometimes he
[1:22:20] does that many times he does that but
[1:22:22] sometimes he makes us wait right
[1:22:25] right to test what kind of
[1:22:29] material
[1:22:30] hallelujah oh I want to be found to be
[1:22:32] pure gold don't you amen
[1:22:36] amen know her husband tried to help but
[1:22:40] it wasn't very
[1:22:42] helpful you know how we do Ela and her
[1:22:45] husband said to her Hannah why weep a am
[1:22:48] I why is that heart grieved am I am not
[1:22:50] I better to thee than 10
[1:22:52] Sons it did not
[1:22:57] help I already gave you your Mother's
[1:22:59] Day gift what else do you want you
[1:23:03] know gave you double what I gave the
[1:23:05] other woman you
[1:23:07] know bamy was tough man anybody want to
[1:23:10] go back to that's
[1:23:17] nuts look not very
[1:23:20] helpful but why did she keep
[1:23:22] going she kept going in spite of all of
[1:23:25] these things she kept going to the
[1:23:26] temple every year every year she went
[1:23:28] with her
[1:23:29] husband brother Brandon said it was
[1:23:31] because faith comes by hearing right he
[1:23:34] said she went up there because Faith
[1:23:36] cometh by hearing Hallelujah and she was
[1:23:39] Barren and had no children she seen the
[1:23:42] word of God where Sarah received a baby
[1:23:45] after she was pasted bearing so Sarah
[1:23:48] received it so could
[1:23:50] Hannah hallelujah oh she went year after
[1:23:54] year after year she never gave up
[1:23:56] because she had an example of somebody
[1:23:57] who waited 25 years and was too old she
[1:24:00] said I've waited 19 years and I'm too
[1:24:02] old but I still
[1:24:04] believe that God's promise is true
[1:24:07] yes amen look so she went in the 19th
[1:24:12] year or whatever that it was she she
[1:24:15] walks into the temple year by year it
[1:24:19] got worse the adversary got harder had
[1:24:21] more material to work with
[1:24:24] but Hannah rose up after they had eaten
[1:24:26] in shallow and after they had
[1:24:27] drunk Eli the priest set upon a seat by
[1:24:30] a post to the Temple of the Lord and she
[1:24:32] was in bitterness of soul and prayed
[1:24:35] unto the Lord and wept sore she vowed a
[1:24:38] vow said oh lord of host if thou Wilt
[1:24:42] indeed look on the Affliction of thine
[1:24:44] handmade and remember me and not forget
[1:24:47] thine handmade she's praying this after
[1:24:49] 19 years she hasn't given up she hasn't
[1:24:53] accepted the status quo she she just
[1:24:56] believes year by year the Bible say they
[1:24:58] went up but this year she's still
[1:25:01] praying but she got so desperate she
[1:25:04] said if you'll remember me well give
[1:25:07] unto thine handmade a Manchild then I
[1:25:08] will give him unto the Lord all the days
[1:25:11] of his life there shall no razor come
[1:25:13] upon his head she got so desperate she
[1:25:15] promised the Lord she said if you give
[1:25:17] me a child I'll give the child back to
[1:25:19] you and he'll be a Nazarite for the Lord
[1:25:21] oh I wonder if there's any mothers that
[1:25:23] get that desperate in their prayer today
[1:25:25] they say Lord you've given me children
[1:25:27] or are you I want children or you've
[1:25:28] given me children Lord I believe these
[1:25:31] children I want to give them back to you
[1:25:33] I believe you gave me these children I
[1:25:34] want to give them back to you they're
[1:25:36] going to be they're going to be
[1:25:37] dedicated to the service of the
[1:25:39] Lord listen she may not have prayed that
[1:25:43] prayer the first
[1:25:44] year right now think about there's a
[1:25:47] reason why he makes us wait yeah she may
[1:25:51] not have prayed that prayer the first
[1:25:52] year or the second year or the 10th year
[1:25:55] right yeah but by the time oh my by the
[1:25:59] time the time was right she was
[1:26:01] desperate enough to meet the challenge
[1:26:03] of the hour because there wasn't just
[1:26:06] going to be any baby born to Hannah but
[1:26:09] a major prophet had to come on the
[1:26:12] scene sometimes the reason why God
[1:26:14] doesn't answer your prayer immediately
[1:26:16] is he's about to do something great in
[1:26:18] your life some sometimes oh church
[1:26:21] sometimes if if You' begin to expect
[1:26:23] that way Lord I know I've not gotten
[1:26:25] what I need right away but I know there
[1:26:27] must be something good at the end of
[1:26:30] this long wait at the end of this long
[1:26:32] struggle at the end of this long trial
[1:26:34] there must be something
[1:26:38] good
[1:26:40] Hallelujah she was so desperate in 1st
[1:26:43] Samuel 1:12 it says it came to pass she
[1:26:45] continued praying before the Lord Eli
[1:26:46] marked her mouth Hannah she spake in her
[1:26:48] heart only her lips moved but her voice
[1:26:50] was not heard so she she's so overcome
[1:26:53] in prayer she can't even speak anymore
[1:26:56] and she's just mouthing
[1:26:59] words and Eli thought she was
[1:27:04] drunk Eli said unto her how long will
[1:27:06] thou be drunk and put away thy wine from
[1:27:08] thee imagine the Deacon coming up to you
[1:27:10] because you've been at the altar so long
[1:27:12] they thought you were
[1:27:13] drunk or the pastor coming to you hey
[1:27:17] time to get
[1:27:19] up what you have to drink where you come
[1:27:22] to church
[1:27:24] and answered no my Lord I am a woman of
[1:27:27] a sorrowful Spirit I've drunk neither
[1:27:30] wine nor strong drink but have poured
[1:27:32] out my soul before the Lord amen count
[1:27:36] not thine handmade for a daughter of
[1:27:38] bile for out of the abundance of my
[1:27:40] complaint and grief have I spoken
[1:27:43] hitherto and Eli answered and saying go
[1:27:45] in peace and the god of Israel Grant
[1:27:47] thee thy petition that thou has ask of
[1:27:49] him and she said let thine handmade find
[1:27:53] Grace in thy sight
[1:27:54] now look all he all it was was a pastor
[1:27:59] say or a priest trying to be
[1:28:01] comforting right but she accepted it as
[1:28:05] the word of the
[1:28:07] Lord Eli wasn't a prophet he wasn't even
[1:28:10] a a very good pastor or priest he was
[1:28:14] just a man but he had the position of
[1:28:16] priest and she believed amen that if a
[1:28:20] man of God told her something she could
[1:28:22] go and hang her hat on it it she could
[1:28:24] go believe it oh if we could have that
[1:28:26] kind of faith today right she believed
[1:28:29] that if a man of God told her that that
[1:28:31] she could go away and she so the woman
[1:28:32] went her away and did eat and her
[1:28:35] countenance was no more sad now what she
[1:28:38] did is she took the adopted baby route
[1:28:41] now brother Harvey was talking about
[1:28:42] that back there I had this in my notes
[1:28:44] but we won't get into the quotes but
[1:28:46] brother Bram talks about the adopted
[1:28:48] baby he said what happens is he said if
[1:28:51] a woman can't have a baby that she'll
[1:28:53] actually be so FL Ed and upset he said
[1:28:55] but you let that woman adopt a baby and
[1:28:57] he said she'll actually end up having a
[1:29:00] baby and some of y'all know that to be
[1:29:02] true I have know stories that that are
[1:29:03] that that actually happened because the
[1:29:05] woman will quit fretting she'll begin to
[1:29:07] care for that baby and then her body
[1:29:09] will react to that she'll become a
[1:29:10] mother so they actually that that works
[1:29:13] even physically and mentally but brother
[1:29:15] B said that works in faith so when you
[1:29:17] get a promise of God you get you when
[1:29:19] someone you come up to be prayed for and
[1:29:21] I lay hands on you and I say go and go
[1:29:23] and be well or go and be healed I'm just
[1:29:25] saying that by faith I I don't have any
[1:29:27] Vision or anything to tell you that but
[1:29:29] if you can it's how you take it yeah
[1:29:31] right it's not what I say it's how you
[1:29:33] take it it's not what I even say across
[1:29:36] the pulpit it's how you take it you can
[1:29:38] be healed by the word of the Lord as
[1:29:39] long as it's the word but it's not so
[1:29:41] much the eloquence of it but it's how
[1:29:43] you take it Lord that's for me and
[1:29:46] Hannah said that service was just for me
[1:29:49] I believe Eli was preaching just for me
[1:29:51] I believe that Sunday was just for me
[1:29:53] and when she did she went away and acted
[1:29:56] like she was already healed like she
[1:29:58] already had a
[1:29:59] baby glory to God and when she acted
[1:30:01] that way brother said if you'll act like
[1:30:03] you've already got it you'll go away
[1:30:06] healed sir that's good oh my that's why
[1:30:10] brother brand would always tell people
[1:30:11] go be happy can I have a few more
[1:30:13] minutes now
[1:30:15] look I haven't preached nearly as long
[1:30:18] as brother Joel yet so I haven't even
[1:30:20] out preached Stuart yet
[1:30:27] so I am aware of my time I'm a very time
[1:30:30] aware person so if I preach long I know
[1:30:33] you don't have to tell
[1:30:37] me she listen she she took that route
[1:30:41] brother brand would tell people he said
[1:30:42] go be happy and so brother Brandon one
[1:30:45] time was Discerning a man with
[1:30:46] nervousness heart trouble and a rupture
[1:30:48] what he said was wrong nervousness heart
[1:30:49] trouble and a rupture and he told him
[1:30:52] it's it's amazing the detail that was in
[1:30:54] told him he said it happened when the
[1:30:55] weather was hot and he begins to count
[1:30:58] months back to when the weather was hot
[1:31:00] said it was 6 7 8 nine months ago in
[1:31:03] August that's a prophet why he's seeing
[1:31:06] it right he's not just saying something
[1:31:08] because he's inspired or or just feels
[1:31:11] to say it he sees it he's seeing it and
[1:31:14] he said you had a heart attack about
[1:31:15] nine months ago something like that and
[1:31:17] you're scared to death now that it's
[1:31:19] going to come back again he said cuz you
[1:31:22] got a nervous heart brother he he said
[1:31:24] don't you believe that that'll bring it
[1:31:25] on you refuse to believe that lie of the
[1:31:29] devil he said when a man has a heart
[1:31:32] attack now you take this brother Brandon
[1:31:34] said it he said he's stronger than he
[1:31:36] was at the first
[1:31:38] place as you say that don't make any
[1:31:40] sense but if you believe it I wonder how
[1:31:41] your life would change come
[1:31:44] on when a man has a heart attack he's
[1:31:47] stronger than he was at the first place
[1:31:48] he said you believe with all your heart
[1:31:49] then go rejoicing praising God be over
[1:31:52] your trouble amen go and be happy and
[1:31:54] rejoice in other words he's saying it's
[1:31:56] not your heart that's your problem it's
[1:31:57] you what you think about your heart
[1:31:59] that's the
[1:32:01] problem that's good that's good you see
[1:32:04] and our motives have to be right you
[1:32:05] know even for healing or whatever our
[1:32:07] motives need to be right now brother
[1:32:09] Brandon talks about Mo the motive of
[1:32:11] having a baby I want to dwell on that
[1:32:13] for a moment but you can apply it to
[1:32:14] other areas of your life the motive has
[1:32:16] to be right a mother a woman wanted to
[1:32:18] have a baby that's a right
[1:32:20] motive right we don't see that today
[1:32:22] that's a right motive
[1:32:24] brother brandom says this he said you've
[1:32:25] come for a very good reason he Saidi
[1:32:27] respect and honor you he's talking to a
[1:32:29] woman in a pray line cuz you're Barren
[1:32:31] you want children isn't that right
[1:32:33] you've heard somebody told you about
[1:32:35] what happened and so forth he said I've
[1:32:36] never asked that in my life but what God
[1:32:39] granted
[1:32:40] it now that's a right motive he said I
[1:32:44] never asked it in my life but what God
[1:32:46] granted
[1:32:47] it wow he said I see you kneeling
[1:32:50] praying he said it's it's in a room
[1:32:51] there's another woman he said I hear you
[1:32:53] you what you're saying you're asking a
[1:32:56] worthy thing you're asking God to give
[1:32:58] you a child a baby you're baren and
[1:33:01] asking God to give you a baby he said
[1:33:02] that's right God bless you I've never
[1:33:04] seen him fail on one yet all right
[1:33:07] Hallelujah a woman in Chicago 50
[1:33:09] something years old come and ask for a
[1:33:11] baby she got a fine boy he said may God
[1:33:14] grant it to you he was praying for
[1:33:17] another woman wanting a child he said
[1:33:18] heavenly father in the day that's so
[1:33:20] evil now and here's a woman wanting a
[1:33:21] little one God bless her as you have the
[1:33:23] many hundreds across the country he said
[1:33:26] and make her well of this may she
[1:33:28] embrace the loved one that she wishes in
[1:33:30] Jesus Christ's name amen said God bless
[1:33:32] you Sister go receive in the name of the
[1:33:33] Lord Jesus Christ now watch I want you
[1:33:36] to understand brother Brandon prayed for
[1:33:38] a woman to have a baby it didn't always
[1:33:40] happen in nine
[1:33:42] months
[1:33:43] true in fact most of the time I'd say
[1:33:46] probably it didn't but sometimes it
[1:33:49] did but sometimes the wait is much
[1:33:51] longer than 9 months brother tells a
[1:33:54] story about Richard Reid who was the
[1:33:55] pastor the Bible Hour Tabernacle in
[1:33:57] Jonesboro Arkansas about an hour and a
[1:33:59] half from here where some of y'all live
[1:34:01] the church was right downtown in
[1:34:03] Jonesboro a little old uh uh United
[1:34:06] Pentecost or Wess church and that's
[1:34:08] where brother brandom kind of began his
[1:34:09] ministry at that point in that great
[1:34:11] Jonesboro
[1:34:12] Revival and it was Richard Reed's wife
[1:34:16] and brother BR said one morning I walked
[1:34:18] out of the room brother Brandon was
[1:34:19] staying with them and he said she was
[1:34:22] taking doctors or shots from from the
[1:34:23] doctrine everything almost caused her to
[1:34:26] lose her mind didn't do any good I'm
[1:34:28] glad for modern medicine it they call it
[1:34:31] practicing medicine for a reason because
[1:34:33] back in the day there was a lot that
[1:34:35] went wrong and they they've come a long
[1:34:37] ways but you still trust God more than
[1:34:40] you trust the doctor right because the
[1:34:42] doctor could be wrong but God's never
[1:34:45] wrong and and one morning I walking out
[1:34:47] of the room I said sister Reed I see you
[1:34:49] holding a little boy baby in your arms
[1:34:51] you shall have it God has rewarded you
[1:34:55] now it's interesting what she was
[1:34:56] rewarded for brother Brandon Walks out
[1:34:58] she's playing the piano and she was
[1:35:00] playing an old favorite song of mine all
[1:35:02] you legalists going to have to close
[1:35:03] your
[1:35:04] ears because it wasn't a christian
[1:35:10] song He said a whole favorite song of
[1:35:12] mine it's not a Christian song it's Home
[1:35:13] on the
[1:35:16] Range he said I think it sounds so
[1:35:19] peaceful and I said God is going to
[1:35:21] bring peace to your family right and
[1:35:23] he's going to bring the little boy
[1:35:25] baby and 5
[1:35:29] Years From that year she embraced a
[1:35:32] little boy baby I was holding him two or
[1:35:35] three weeks ago in my hands trotting him
[1:35:37] up and down the aisles of the place
[1:35:38] right where it was said the Lord granted
[1:35:40] he said that's one of
[1:35:42] hundreds five
[1:35:48] years this was special to my heart
[1:35:50] because brother brandom was talking
[1:35:51] about a lady who was complimenting
[1:35:52] brother brandom on his sermon
[1:35:55] and no matter what preachers tell you
[1:35:56] they all like it they may not need it
[1:35:59] but they all like
[1:36:01] it right so she was compliment brother
[1:36:04] Bram on the sermon brother BR remarked
[1:36:05] how nice she was and while she was
[1:36:08] standing there I saw a vision said now
[1:36:11] she was way in her middle age he said
[1:36:13] this has been eight years ago I said
[1:36:16] sister thus sayith the Lord I see you
[1:36:18] standing holding a baby in your arms in
[1:36:20] a little blanket she said me I said Yes
[1:36:23] Man you it's thus sayith the Lord she
[1:36:25] said I hope you're right I said it isn't
[1:36:27] me speaking it's thus sayith the lord
[1:36:30] well two or three four years passed and
[1:36:32] she began to doubt it her husband's name
[1:36:35] was Mr doble she was Mrs doble a very
[1:36:38] generous man brother man talked about
[1:36:40] how he wanted to give brother Rand his
[1:36:41] coat and some guy had come by some
[1:36:43] so-called Prophet we still have
[1:36:45] so-called prophets today but they aren't
[1:36:48] that
[1:36:49] Prophet right there was a prophet to the
[1:36:51] age right and some Prophet come by and
[1:36:54] told him to quit his job because the
[1:36:55] Russians were going to invade Canada and
[1:36:58] so they were going to overtake the place
[1:36:59] where he lived and said quit your job so
[1:37:01] prophecies like that have real world
[1:37:03] implications right the man quit his
[1:37:06] job and brother brand said he used to
[1:37:08] send Christmas gifts and everything to
[1:37:10] the family and he couldn't do it no more
[1:37:11] because he quit his
[1:37:12] job and and now so brother brandom
[1:37:16] talked to him he said he didn't want to
[1:37:17] say nothing about the brother that said
[1:37:19] that he said I slipped off went out
[1:37:20] knelt down started praying when I did
[1:37:23] the angel of the Lord came now remember
[1:37:24] this is the the woman's husband a woman
[1:37:26] that had waited three or four years she
[1:37:27] began to doubt said when I did the angel
[1:37:30] of the Lord come said go tell him thus
[1:37:31] sayth the Lord go on up there because
[1:37:34] the man's
[1:37:35] wrong other words go take your job back
[1:37:38] the man's wrong and said also speak to
[1:37:40] him to tell his wife to watch that
[1:37:42] doubting she's doing about that
[1:37:45] baby
[1:37:46] amen three or four years he said so I
[1:37:50] went back I said brother doble not to
[1:37:51] discredit your brother your friend
[1:37:52] whoever it is the man might have been
[1:37:54] impressed to say that I don't want to
[1:37:56] have anything light of that brother no
[1:37:57] sir see Impressions aren't thus sayith
[1:38:00] the Lord right but I said I have as a
[1:38:02] servant of the Lord thus sayth the lord
[1:38:05] well I'm glad there was one in our age
[1:38:08] I'm glad there was one in our age I have
[1:38:10] thus sayi the Lord you'll be safe and be
[1:38:12] blessed go do the work he said if you
[1:38:14] say that brother brandom I believe
[1:38:16] it I said tell your wife to quit
[1:38:18] doubting about that baby he said that's
[1:38:21] been about three years ago
[1:38:24] four years three years brother BR said
[1:38:26] total of about eight years he said last
[1:38:29] week the baby was
[1:38:30] born after eight years and something
[1:38:33] God's word is eternally true and the
[1:38:36] same God that lives the same God that
[1:38:38] lived in the Old Testament is the same
[1:38:40] God that lived today how many believe
[1:38:42] that lives today hundreds of those cases
[1:38:45] he
[1:38:46] said now again I want you to apply this
[1:38:48] to anything you need in your life

[1:39:19] Vision I love this she was holding a
[1:39:22] great big flumpy baby boy and it shall
[1:39:25] come to pass regardless of what she says
[1:39:28] or what she thinks sir are you talk
[1:39:30] about the grace of God because God
[1:39:32] already said so a vision cannot be
[1:39:35] hindered oh church he said it'll come to
[1:39:37] pass regardless what she says or what
[1:39:39] she thinks that he he was caught up
[1:39:41] beyond the curtain of time and he said
[1:39:43] he said I saw you there and I put my
[1:39:45] name there I believe my face is one that
[1:39:47] he saw there he saw the vision the
[1:39:49] vision cannot be hindered I'm going to
[1:39:51] be there oh you ought to take that stti
[1:39:54] that claim yourself I'm going to be
[1:39:56] there why because thus sayith the Lord
[1:39:58] come in our
[1:39:59] hour I'm going to be one of those
[1:40:01] millions that said we're resting on
[1:40:04] that I don't care who says anything else
[1:40:06] I don't care who doubts let the internet
[1:40:08] say what it wants to let the world say
[1:40:11] what they want to let people say what
[1:40:13] they want to and say well you're doing
[1:40:14] it wrong you're doing this wrong let me
[1:40:16] stay with the word of the Prophet
[1:40:18] because he already told us I don't care
[1:40:20] how much you doubts it's going to be
[1:40:21] there
[1:40:25] you say the bride's going downhill
[1:40:27] nothing's going right we're just going
[1:40:28] to get in by the skin of our teeth I
[1:40:29] refuse to believe it on why because the
[1:40:32] vision said there'll be a bride without
[1:40:34] spot or wrinkle washing the blood of the
[1:40:36] Lamb let me be somebody who holds on
[1:40:38] like Hanah it says I
[1:40:40] believe I believe help thou my
[1:40:43] unbelief
[1:40:45] Hallelujah three days before she was due
[1:40:48] the same woman visited brother brandom
[1:40:50] she said one thing brother brandom I
[1:40:52] confess my sin of UN
[1:40:54] believe now she's having a baby said but
[1:40:57] one thing I want to ask you for a
[1:40:58] confirmation you said it would be a boy
[1:41:00] I said it will be a boy just as soon as
[1:41:03] they could return her home she had A8
[1:41:05] pound baby boy that's running around in
[1:41:06] Canada tonight of a mother over 50 years
[1:41:09] old because God keeps his
[1:41:12] word he never
[1:41:16] fails see God was doing something bigger
[1:41:18] than Hannah realized brother Brandon
[1:41:20] said she got on her knees she never
[1:41:21] noticed the Dignity of the temple she
[1:41:23] never notice a dignified priest as he
[1:41:24] walked out she was in such distress till
[1:41:26] her tears were rolling down her cheeks
[1:41:28] she was crying in desperation oh Lord
[1:41:30] God give me a son give me a son and
[1:41:33] notice he said she wasn't selfish when
[1:41:35] God heard her and answered to prayer and
[1:41:36] gave her a son she gave him back to God
[1:41:39] and because she was willing not to be
[1:41:40] selfish after God answered her prayer he
[1:41:42] gave her a prophet and she prayed with
[1:41:45] desperation she must have this child
[1:41:46] what was it he said God had spoke to her
[1:41:48] no doubt remember Faith come by hearing
[1:41:50] how did God speak to her through Eli
[1:41:53] Hallelujah you can't be desperate till
[1:41:55] God speaks to you oh Church Rise Up and
[1:41:57] Shake Yourself pinch your conscience
[1:41:59] wake yourself up in this hour he said we
[1:42:01] must be desperate or perish there's

[1:42:07] there's coming forth something we better
[1:42:09] get desperate it's between life and
[1:42:10] death it'll pass through us and we won't
[1:42:12] see it right oh my oh I believe he's
[1:42:15] doing it in our hour God shut up her
[1:42:18] womb to make her desperate because she
[1:42:21] was so desperate all the selfishness
[1:42:22] went away the child that she had was a
[1:42:27] prophet not just any child but a prophet
