you've got a need you'd like to make known but we have uplifted hand i'm sure god sees those needs tonight he knows all of our lives and what we need and he's able to even meet those needs as the word comes forth tonight heavenly father lord jesus you see every hand that was raised every need lord lord the things even that we're thinking about tonight and i'm sure lord there's things that maybe others don't know that each one of these people lord would it's a desperate situation lord and they they want you to move and i pray god that you would do that tonight i pray heavenly father that you would help us to have faith to believe that you're a god who still answers our prayer we thank you for that tonight i pray that you'd move me out of the way lord and speak to us in this service lord we we take every every spirit everything that would be against your word lord under the control of the word lord in this service that lord that we could only speak the things that you would have us to say thank you for what you've done and what you're going to do ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to romans chapter 8. we'll look at verses 18 through 23 and then read verse 29 so good to see you tonight good to be back in the house of the lord with you and i've been anticipating this for several days i'll admit there for a little while i put it out of my mind but for the last several days for the curtis i've been looking forward to seeing brother bill sitting right there in his chair and every one of you sitting there but jt's back there and each one of you that come i mean so much to me uh and and to the lord as well just think how wonderful it is if we've been separated for just a couple weeks to come back together what a wonderful can you imagine the ones that have already went on what a wonderful time it's going to be we get to meet maybe we haven't seen them in years and years and all once you begin to see the ones with the sam that you saw went on before you my what a gathering time that's going to be man it feels good to be back in the house of the lord i believe that time is coming we don't have very long here we serve a risen savior amen and he's coming back because he lives we'll live also amen we live also romans chapter 8 and verse 18. i want to pick up on our study on the breach and i'm happy to be back i want to thank brother allen for going above and beyond to take several of the services and joe adams as well i understand they did a marvelous job and i was able to completely check out for a couple of weeks and it was just did wonders for me mentally i i love you all but i'm i'm ready to go back at it now but we just needed that and i appreciate you allowing me to do that brother robert wilson tonight is in a country he sent me a text today that he had arrived that is 99 muslim less than 200 believers there in that country would you be just remembering him in prayer i know some of you haven't met him some of you did at the meetings over at gibson but he'll hopefully be able to give us a report of this trip we're supporting him on this trip and it's completely preaching to muslim people and people of other faiths and there's a few christians in that country preaching to them about christ and about the message of the hour and to completely new people and that's what i want to support i want to be behind that and i've been with brother robert overseas i know what he does and what he preaches so you'd be praying for him and it's dangerous but he don't have any fear because he's a real missionary and so i'm glad he's doing it not me so be praying for him especially that's been on my heart on that trip romans 8 18 he says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen for the earnest expectation of the creature eateth for the manifestation of the sons of god i remember brother andrew was here what he said that sons plural plural the sons of god but the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same and hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail have been pained together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body and then i want to jump to verse 29 he says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate for what purpose why did he predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen we believe that tonight pray lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated i want to talk to you about the dominion of the sons of god this is what brother branham is dealing with in the breach where we left off he was laying a background for why redemption was necessary he talks about the earth groaning to be restored and he says we know the earth is not in the condition it ought to be in or as he says there ought to be condition he said and when nature and peoples as the bible said are groaning it shows there's something they're not and they're ought to be conditioned they've fallen from somewhere he said now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us for of course we know he said it was eternal life they had fallen from they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of adam and eve who fell from eternal life to death in the garden of eden and brought all nature under them to death and you say well is that true well that's what the bible says first corinthians 15 22 for as in adam all die oh all die and i read i was reading just happen to be reading and questions and answers tonight where brother random said that sometimes the devil will start he said in a mild way in a person to make them feel like they're a good person the devil actually leave them in that condition all of their life because they will never be saved because they think they're too good and and so he said the devil as he said that's a demon in a mild form he said but in adam all die but in christ all will be made alive amen and so brother madam said a tree never died before adam an animal wouldn't die before adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's god because he's eternal he said and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be the sons and daughters of god he said but when we died as i said in the message this morning to sin we sold out our birthrights and crossed this chasm now he's talking about the reason why revelation 4 and 5 had to take place why did it have to happen why did there have to be a lamb why was there a breach between god and man well it's because we sold out our birthrights and crossed this chasm he said now we're beyond the reach of god on the other this other side of the chasm he said now of course when adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation this isn't new doctrine in fact spurgeon taught this i believe i got that quote and put it on here to show you i don't know if you can see it but he said the law shows the distance that exists between god and man and the gospel bridges that awful chasm and brings the sinner across it that's the breach right the gospel brings the center across the chatham chasm now in ezekiel 22 30 the the prophets understood that it was difficult to find a man to stand in that breach where are you going to find one and he said i sought for a man among them and that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it he said but i found none i didn't find anybody that could stand in there so i would not destroy the land that's the condition we're in today but there was a lamb that was worthy to stand in the breach and make up the hedge aren't you glad for that tonight i said 28 8 isaiah put it this way he said for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness what a graphic description of the condition of man the condition that mankind is in without god without without the breach without the one who filled the gap and and there's only one man who's worthy to fill that gap and and that's found in first timothy 2 5 for there is one god one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus no one else can fill that gap when people tell you and i believe that in this hour a prophet lived as close to christ as we've ever seen a man live but he couldn't fill that role he couldn't be the one who stood in the breach he was born in sin shaping and iniquity one man that did that a mediator between god and man and that will never change and he's the one that we're going to worship he's the one we're going to fall down before now but random tells us in the breach he said now he was given free moral agency it was given to them just as we so to make a choice he said no adam and eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sets before each and every one of us he said see god isn't doing for adam or for eve you say well it's their fault he said no not now it isn't it's your fault why because the man came the mediator came you can't put it back on adam anymore because the second adam came and now every one of us has an opportunity to partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil with the tree of life you say well what about predestination predestination just gives you the ability to to do that right it makes you have a desire to want that right but you have to make that choice but now he says and he said it's set before you he said it's your fault you can't place it on adam now you've got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you he said we're on the same basis as adam and eve and i want to touch on this sometime about rebecca's choice and we won't get into it tonight but i told somebody i was going to have a hard time because i've gotten several thoughts over the last couple weeks and and i'm a hard time staying away from them tonight but but rebecca had a choice rebecca had a choice and it was in her to make the right choice but it was her choice right and and it wasn't that you know she would sit back and say well let me reason this out let me think about it let me get all the material and try to make an informed decision no she just said here why don't you sit down i'll give the camels water and he gave her the gifts and and told her about isaac and and said you've got to make a decision today if you're going to go meet a man you've never seen a man you can't even prove exists you realize that he can only prove the only way he could even prove that isaac existed was by the gifts he gave her very man and but but she couldn't even prove that he existed but what did she do for the harvey sheep she said i'll go and that's what the real predestinated seed does makes that choice says i'll go there's something on the inside of brother sam and say i'll go if nobody else goes i'll go with family don't go i'll go if the church don't go i'll go if everybody else turns him aside i'll go with him amen i might have to slow down tonight i was in her to make the right choice he said but you see when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice but we want his choice amen we have a choice but once we've made that choice once we are redeemed we we don't want our own choice anymore we're not looking to prove whether he's right or wrong whether he's good or bad i believe it was bill gates that wrote a song he said don't ask me whether he's good or bad he's talking about the the man that was healed the leper or the the crippled man that was healed and the pharisee says what kind of man is he he said don't ask me if he's good or bad but the guilt i have is gone i was i was a crippled but now i can walk i don't want a choice anymore we want his choice now adam and eve wanted their own choice they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom so they probed into it and caused death be careful what you probe into in man's wisdom because there's no life in it oh it does watch what it does watch what your wisdom does oh you say i'm smart but what does it do to your family what does it do to everybody around you when you gain it what what is the production of your life when you gain this wisdom but see we don't want that choice we want christ amen and brother branham says now when a man has been redeemed he don't care anymore for scholarship you don't care anymore for things of the world the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all christ has been his choice and that's all of it in other words he's not looking for information to base a choice on he's made a choice right and so he goes about he's not looking to prove it right or wrong he just knows what god did and he's going he's redeemed but brown said he just no one wants to lead himself you don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do and you know i had a hard time being convinced of this but i've learned it i used to not believe this but people actually want to be talked into doing something and that's why churches that preach false doctrine can be full of people and sometimes even churches that are cults can be filled with people because people want to be talked into doing something have you ever looked at mormonism not just pick on them because many of them are good people but if you're looked at the doctrines and things they come up with it's crazy it's not with the word at all why do so many people believe it they want somebody to tell him what to where to go and what to do right people want that they want they make their choice based on intellectualism based on this man sounds good the wisdom of the world but he said he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker then he goes in the name of his maker when the maker tells him to go now watch this he said but man seeking wisdom wants to find now brother brown was talking to us preachers now so i guess just me and me and brother allen tonight i don't think i see any other preachers here but look he said man seeking wisdom wants to find well this parish is pretty good but they pay me more over yonder i'll go over there he said that's wisdom wisdom now look see if you're a son and we're going to get into this what it means to be a son of god or a daughter of god if you're a child of god you're led by the spirit of god look at romans 8 12. he said therefore brethren we are dead or it's not to the flesh to live after the flesh free if you live after the flesh you shall die if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and so brother branham brings that down into preaching but whatever it is that you do you know that you're led when you're led by the spirit of god you know you are the sons of god you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear now watch what he's saying he said you've not received the spirit of the law which was the spirit of bondage the spirit of i have to do this but i don't want to i have to do this because it's my family my culture my nation moses said do it so i'll do it that's the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've not received that you've not received a spirit that says well brother branham said it so i have to do it well that's that's good but that's not the spirit of adoption right it's good that you want to believe what a messenger says but that's not the spirit of adoption the spirit of adoption is when the spirit itself comes in and lives in you whereby we cry abba father he said the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ and so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now so that what makes the sons of god now roman or back to the breach brother brown said now when adam sinned he eating his wife's reasoning instead of holding to god's word he said that's what made adam sin he said his wife reasoned with satan and then produced the product to adam and adam turned loose of the word and sold out look what he lost he lost his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and i want you to bear down because i'm i'm not going to hold you very long tonight contrary to what my brother said i did not watch the services while i was gone try to set ourselves apart but someone told me that my brother said i'd preach two hours tonight and i'm gonna prove him wrong listen he said he lost his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life he said remember the day you eat there of that day you die when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had now watched completely supreme control of the earth oh my he was the god of the earth the earth was adam's domain right the earth belonged to adam the other planets and the stars everything god kept that for himself but the earth belonged to adam but the brown says god is the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this earth think about it everything in the earth his son had this earth now look what what this breach what the opening of the seals is going to take us back to right it brings us back into this condition to where listen we're not we're not talking now to to children this isn't skim milk this is to those who believe right you got to believe this is some this is not just well we're going to heaven someday but he come to bring you back under authority to be able to have dominion over the earth he said well it's hard for me to believe that when i can't get my car to start but look he wants you to have dominion over this brother man put it this way in just simple terms he said become so full of the holy ghost till the devil don't know what to do with you he said in this way he said you've come so far the holy ghost that you can't sin think about it no no he's not talking there about about the little things you do every day but there's something inside of you you can live so close to god so the devil don't know what to do with you you can have the earth under supreme control you say brother ben does anybody have that i believe we do at times and then at times we don't right like i'll say this it's been restored back to the earth right that's the goal that's where we're going but but see there's we still have a flesh body right and we got to remember that but so the fullness of adoption doesn't take place until the change of the body right and that's why i've told you before you don't look for anything great to happen before that but what are we looking for we're looking for things to continue to go on as they are until the coming of the lord right there's not going to be a great revival or something he said oh something great's going to happen no it's just going to be you becoming more and more like the word but you may not even recognize it right and and so and so we we want to be in revival we want to have all these things but but that's not what we're looking for we're looking for the coming of the lord we're looking for that fullness of the rapture that change of the body but now look so i don't want us to become unbalanced here but look what the word promises us he said god is the god of univ the universe but his son had this earth under his own control he could speak he could name all right now if i on this chair i can name it whatever i want to right my kids they spent half the time coming back on our trip writing down names for their future dog and it not gonna come to the old one dies but they don't believe that they're they're holding on to something different but but we already have a dog but they writing down dogs names why would they why would they name a dog it's theirs right you don't name somebody else's stuff at least i hope you don't if you do they can just change it or ignore it right you name your own stuff i name my own kids me and my wife we come up with the name why they're ours amen he could speak he could name in other words and we're going to go into this in a minute but he could actually identify what use that animal was going to have for him right he's gonna he's gonna look at that animal he said this is the part you're gonna play so maybe he looks takes a peacock or a beautiful bird and he looks at it and he says now you're by identifying by naming it it's giving you this name he's telling it this is what you're gonna do you're going to look so pretty you're going to be you're going to feel this part in the creation now watch he's naming it it's more than just god said well i'll let adam name him since he don't have nothing to do right but his naming showed his control over it right he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to oh my but see when he did that what did he do he sold out for wisdom he lost his inheritance he thought it would be so good to know these things and when he found out what he was looking for he had lost everything he was now he could now adam could say let this mountain here be moved over there and it would do it and he didn't have to worry about it not happening it always worked the first time he did it it worked the second time the hundredth time he just spoke and it happened he didn't have nothing sitting there telling him well you you can't do this you're not good enough you you know that that's after the fall adam could do these things adam could say let this mountain here be moved over there and do it adam could say let this tree here be plucked up and planted over here it would do it listen he said for he had complete supreme control as a minor god under god our father because he was a son of god amen now i want you to know tonight that sons are not slaves they're not servants even ishmael and i go to this a lot but it struck me years ago he told ishmael he said told abraham he said because he is thy seed i'll make a great nation out of him because even the seed of a bondwoman who was a son of a slightly doubted promise would become a nation would become a leader would become have dominion not be a safe not the natural condition of abraham's seed to be slaves and if so if ishmael the son of a slightly doubted promise would have dominion how much more would the royal seed of abraham have dominion and i want us to really grasp this so maybe you're watching tonight or you'll be watching this some working and different things i know many can't come on wednesday night but this is so important to us i think as a church because when the word tells us to do something it's not setting a carrot on a stick out there just far enough ahead of you like a these greyhound races where they have a rabbit running in front where you can't reach it but you have the ability under the opening of the word to do to live the word right if god said i can have a family that's at peace if god said i can have a church where the gifts are in operation and the people love god and the presence of god is there if god said are you with me now if the word said i can have peace in spite of my trials if the word says i can have joy in my life if the word says i can have a godly marriage if the word said whatever it is if the word said it i have the right to step up and claim that i wasn't born to be a safe i was born to have dominion but so many times the devil throw up a little difficulty in our face we said oh see there i knew i couldn't do it well i must be the lord telling me someone told me years ago when i was moving to a certain place they said well if it's the lord it'll be easy where does that come from every time the people of god ever did anything it was met with difficulty moses marched down there under the anointing going down to egypt to take over got his wife and kids on a mule he marches into pharaoh's hall and he says let us go we want to go worship god and pharaoh says start making bricks without straw he just made it harder on him and many times we're met with difficulty to see what we'll do but you're a son of god we may get into this some more on sunday morning but in just a little bit different way but sons of god don't have to be scared of the devil you don't have to give in every time the devil keeps doing the same thing over and over and over again to keep you out of church the same thing over and over and over again to destroy your peace the same thing over and over and over again to destroy your health and you sit there say well he did it nothing i can do you're a son of god you're born to be a minor god on the earth right y'all going to wish i'd stayed in south carolina you see at times the seed of abraham ended up in slavery but they never stayed there look at joseph they sold him as a slave put him down in the slave pit everywhere he went he'd become the boss of the place i put him in potiphar's house he'd become the boss of the potiphar's house put him in the prison and become the boss of the prison amen brought him up to pharaoh's house to become the boss of pharaoh's house why he was the seed of abraham let's look at that a minute genesis 41 39 and pharaoh said to joseph for as much as god has showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shall be over my house and according unto listen according unto thy word so all my people be ruled i'm in the second chariot a man there's got the pharaoh's ring on his hand that man there that that's made it didn't we have the same difficulties didn't we face the same obstacles weren't we did we come in the same way but you don't have the same father you're not of the same seed i don't know about you i'm tired of the devil pushing me around the devil sit back there and say well you can't do it you can't do it church will never be nothing but i'm a seed of abraham your seed of abraham you can't have your health you'll you'll never you'll always be that way your parents were that way your dad did this and your mama did this and they they had this going for them and they had this run and just runs in the family but i'm a seed of abraham i'm not condemned to do what my dad did i'm not condemned to have the things in my body even naturally that my parents said i can break the cycle i'm a seed of abraham i don't have to wallow in depression i don't have to stay in the despair all the time but you don't understand my circumstances no you're a seed of abraham amen he says and pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt oh what about the royal seed here tonight hey man what we ought to be able to do i'm going back to the breach here and we'll just for a couple more paragraphs brother brown says now he says couldn't we stop here just a minute and get a real sermon he said oh then if the blood has cleansed it back what about now he said adam was the supreme god on the earth he said then if the blood has cleansed it back what about now he said see look what the son of god the second adam did see and said the works that i do show you also you see well i'm not going to get into that we'll talk about that sunday morning adam lost his inheritance the earth but the brahmana said not pass from his hand to the one he sold out to satan he sold his faith in god to satan's reasonings therefore his eternal life is right to the tree of life his rights to the earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of satan he passed it from his hand to satan he said therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted and the seed of abraham now listen to this the seed of abraham has destroyed the inheritance that adam should have had he said that's the earth the seed of a the seed of adam rather the seed of adam has destroyed the inheritance that adam should have had now watch brother madam goes on and we'll talk about that in the future he goes on to talk about geronimo goes on to talk about the indians and what a terrible thing it was when the white man come down in tucson i kind of experienced something like that the other day when we were in chattanooga we looked out over lookout mountain you can see so far but you see the factories and things and the railroad and you think hundreds of men died in that place thousands of men died there in that place fighting for a little city of chattanooga because there was rail yards there and it scarred the natural beauty of the place you sit there and wonder what it must have been like when the cherokee was there because also running through there was a trail of tears running right through chattanooga and what it must have been like when the cherokee was here brother brandon stood in arizona he said what it must have been when the old squad would walk across with her papoose and he said there was no crime no no adultery nothing like that going on he said then all of a sudden here come here come the man with all of his knowledge he knows everything he's going to fix it he's going to make it good he just ends up killing himself now watch i want to dwell on this in genesis 2 19 this is where adam named the creatures the animals said out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them into adam to see what he would call them whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof again this is more than just you know my kids naming their dolls in the room in the in their room right this is authority this is function this is assigning them their purpose claiming them for his work asserting his dominion over them i'm going to ask you this because it's what come to me as i was praying about these things when the things that you have dominion over come before you what do you name them now think about that for a moment what do you call it what do you call it i thought it was interesting that nobody knew what the chronovirus was till we gave it a name and now you just have to say it people are afraid of it right you go into a place you walk into a restaurant say covet but like yelling leprosy maybe hundreds of years ago everybody's gonna be scared be afraid it's got a name and and i showed you months ago brother branham talked about diseases he said they've always been in the earth he said but then we'll give it a name he said and when it just makes it that much stronger it's what it does it makes it that much more powerful because of the fear of it right and so but what do you name the things look we should have dominion over what we do over the way we live right and when i say we i mean the seed should have dominion the holy ghost the influence of the holy ghost in our life should have dominion we shouldn't be out here smoking drinking running around with women the seed should have dominion over that what do we call what we have dominion over you call it an overcomer or do you call it overcome right you're going to name it something what are you going to name it what what what do you call yourself what do you think what's your mindset about your family about your church well it's just a bunch of bunch of people don't know what they're doing well if i was in charge i'd show them what what to do you know i know all of you that think that are sitting at home tonight so i can say that god bless you those of you that are watching boy if i could just be the one in charge if i could be the deacon or the trustee or the but maybe that's so i don't know what did you name it what did you call it what did you say well it's always going to be this way well my family never did go to church on wednesday night well you named it my family does right what if your dad didn't that don't matter my family does what do you think about yourself what what what are you because we get in these patterns of thinking well i've always got to be depressed this is the way my family is this is the way i live this is my circumstances we subject and we look at the world by naming things right we we identify what something is that's a chair that's an organ that's a piano that tells me something about it right it identifies it names it what what do we name ourselves how are we identifying ourselves are we somebody are we a nobody church we got to quit letting the devil push us around adam got everything in his dominion gave it a name amen and nothing there could hurt him nothing there could tear him up nothing there see god gave you a dominion he gave you something a place to overcome in do you call it an overcoming family do you see it as something that's overcoming or have you let the devil push you back and what will always be this way we will never be any better than this i refuse to believe that because i tell you what one of these days i'm not going to be in this body i'm not only going to overcome my fears my anxieties my sicknesses my flesh that i live in one of these days i'm going to be in a different body altogether i'm not just going to overcome here on the earth one of these days i'm going to overcome completely how am i ever going to do that if i can't name it what it is i'm a seed of god i'm a child of the king i belong to the master amen whatever was in his dominion he named it mark 11 23 says for verily i send you whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart and shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith and we could go into how god showed that in this age in the spoken word when he spoke to hattie wright with a woman he said whatever you want you say it whatever you want you say it she claimed her dominion amen she claimed her sons he said well she was a widow woman how could she do that because you remember adam and eve in the beginning were the same they had the same potentials they were equal amen they weren't fighting over what to name what they were together on it you and christ are together in this you have a right to take a dominion no matter if you're a man woman boy or girl no matter what it is i have dominion over this but you don't know the boss at my job you're a son of god take dominion over it i don't mean to go act like a heathen that means you claim it and move on you don't worry about it a new young man excuse me for digressing but i'm at my conclusion actually which esther says doesn't mean anything anyway but a new young man that every time he go to work he went to church where we did he'd go to work for a while and he come to the pastor's office defeated after about two weeks he said there's just so many sinners at the workplace well do they pay you good oh they pay me good can you do the work yeah i can do the work but they just so many sinners i just can't listen to them all day well take dominion over that you're a son of god maybe you didn't get put in the school you wanted to get put in huh and some of you teaching maybe that i wasn't thinking about that i was thinking about when you'll go to school but maybe when you're teaching maybe when you're doing a job whatever it is you don't get the place you wanted take dominion over the place you're in because god allowed you to be there for a reason i'm a son of god if i find myself on the on the line making electric engines or whatever it is that you do electric motors if i find myself on the line in the quality control department wherever i find myself i'm going to take dominion over that amen they say well you don't understand my i got to work this job because nobody else will hire me no you take dominion over that trust god somebody will you do what you let me tell you my life is a testimony and i think every one of you that have lived very long could testify tonight you put god first god will bless you take dominion over it say well i'm waiting on something to change take dominion over it step out in faith see what god will do i'm telling you to be stupid but if you have the confidence you pray until you have the confidence that is that it's what god wants you to do and then you just step out on that and then you won't have to do something stupid to do it it'll happen i wanted to show you some pictures we went to a plantation in south carolina i drug my kids away from all their happiness on a 90 degree day so we're going to take one day and go look at history so here brother gabe's amen back there we went to a plantation house in south carolina and beautiful home beautiful show that next picture this is a picture of a tree that george washington you know george washington was a man under authority what he said went 230 years ago george washington stood in that spot and this woman who owned the house was going to cut down that tree and he said she said my view would be better without the tree don't you think so he said no ma'am he said you should leave it up so she left it up and so they call it the george washington tree and that tree was there but you'll notice there's a bell in the tree if you can see it there's a bell right in the middle of that tree it was a slave bell that's what they used to call the slaves and it astonished me because there were 300 slaves on a plantation that times brother joe had one person one white person living on it in the middle of nowhere in fact when they started you had to take a boat go in the ocean come down two rivers to get there you couldn't even get there by road and so but whenever they rang that bell all the slaves would come and it just astounded me but alex i thought why they were used to it so that next picture they had inside and they showed us the all the the rooms and the architecture and things and they had this great big ballroom probably as big as this church and had a great big ceiling and it was a ballroom where they threw a party for george washington when he come to visit and they showed all the history of it and all those things and and it had a plaque on the wall it showed the names of the enslaved i know you can't read those names but i've got some of the names that i i went and did some research and pulled off of there but what that is is generations of enslaved people who labored at those properties for the different owners that were there at hampton plantation and where they get this is from letters that they would write and but mostly from wheels they would leave the slaves to the next generation so they had to when when they left the slaves they had to identify them give them a name and give them a value now go to that next slide there's some just a few of the names and they're put together by by family some of them belfast five that's five dollars that's what he was worth in the wheel old guy won i won't single him out at all he's worth a dollar and the guy told us she said that that's because he couldn't do any work a baby was actually worth a lot because it had a potential of a lifetime of slavery i'll tell you what we don't have anything to be proud of robin 90. where do you think they got these names they didn't bring these names from africa they named them master named them grace 30 lucy 80 diana 50 primus 100 sam 60 60 bucks for the sam solomon's 70 it shows the price for the family myra and saul and patty go let next slide mary and bob and nick and phyllis old bess you imagine old guy didn't bother to give him much of a name old guy it's only worth a dollar he comes up there and walks because i'm not worth much just kind of hangs out around the plantation tries to look busy oh best maybe she can't hardly move they only keep her around like they would an old dog big sharper 20 prince 30 baker 80 bounce 70. i'd like to meet him mark's worth fifty fifty bucks effie 40 send to five susanna one it goes on sharp jonathan bella 500 peter 570 bucks there's peter back there must've been a pretty good slave 300 of them on the plantation at once just a few of them could have come in and taken over they say that the slave owners back then were lived in mortal fear of a slave revolt because they knew they couldn't win it so they controlled information they made a slave bible that took out all the parts about freedom oh church don't you realize what the devil wants to do he wants to stick you out on the porch somewhere label you as old guy put you out there for a dollar put you out there a worthless preacher a worthless woman put you out there a dollar 50 cents you're not worth nothing he assigns you a name and a value and you sit back and take it but the opening of the word came to show us you're worth something i wasn't found in the will of a slave owner but my name was found in the will amen the one who owned the cattle on a thousand deals oh church i saw this all i could do to keep from crying right there i thought oh god how could people keep themselves under that slavery how could they allow it but that's just all they knew you know what happened during the civil war that man left the plantation one man left the plantation there was no one there for the entirety of the civil war no one to rule this plantation no one to run the things no one to make the slaves do anything he came back at the end of the civil war he lived through it you know what happened all the slaves were still there they didn't know what to do we drove past some of the houses of the descendants of those same slaves still there 150 years later why you forgive me for taking my time tonight and going through this but it just meant so much to me why are they still there there's just something about it they're still under the dominion of that plantation still under the mindset of that plantation even after all these years still trying to make a living for somebody else oh god what about you you weren't made to be a slave none of god's sons and daughters were made to be slaves you weren't born to be slaves yet you see people living year after year generation after generation living in generational sin living in a generational mindset we have to do this because mom and dad did it we have to do this because just the way the church always did it this way everybody else always did it we don't have to be that way anymore you're not made to be that way you don't have to live on the plantation you don't have to be just you say well you didn't know my mom you didn't know my dad you don't have to do it i wish i could tell you i wish i could tell you you're free but you've got to recognize it or you'll never go free quit giving in every time the devil throws something your way i i know i'm preaching to myself too the devil throws something by you just oh man i can't do that he'll say well that worked that was easy you got a purpose of god to fulfill in your life and you know those things that are resurrected it's those things which fulfill the purpose of god amen amen don't you want to be a part of that resurrection we talked about when i first come up don't you want to be there you want to fulfill the purpose of god don't let the devil just throw something at you some little idea some little thing that's off and you just grab a hold of it and say well that's all i'm ever going to be no you can be different you don't have to give in to that your chains can be let loose i i'm not a fiery enough preacher somebody could take this and really preach it but i tell you what i want you to think about it what do you do that you wouldn't have to do don't tell me you have to do something that's not in the word right if the word says not to do he said well i have to i can't help it don't tell me that god's able you're able to take dominion over that thing you're a son and daughter of god would you bow your heads with me maybe the devil's giving you a price maybe you heard gossip something told you you were worth a dollar you were 50 500 but the opening of the word came to put a different price on your head you're worth what god says you're worth what is the value of the bride the value of the bride it's the price paid for it and the price paid for it is the life of the son of god are you willing to let go and just you know just walk away from it that's all you have to do brother andrew come through and we we did that and he was trying to show us just let it go put it out the door put it in the trash can let it go and and here tonight we're hearing that you know there's things that we could just hold on to and hold on to and hold on to well it's just the way it's got to be i'm just so busy i don't have time to pray you're a son of god i'm so um i don't have time to go to church you don't understand but i've been my family my life this is the way we've always been you're a son or daughter of god break that thing let go of that thing let the word be first in your life you don't need no preacher to tell you what to do and stand over you can tell you all the time some some church just stand over here and give you a book of rules no the sons of god are led by the spirit of god be a son and daughter of god tonight amen heavenly father lord as i can see the people thinking about these things we have nothing to be proud about even as a nation lord in our history some of the things that happen but lord we know that we don't we're not just americans though i'm proud to be an american but lord how much more proud i am to be a christian you never had any slaves lord just sons and daughters i'm so grateful for that lord so grateful not only to be touched by your mercy not only to be brought into your economy lord not only to be saved from starvation of the world but lord also not only to be cared for in natural things but also to be given dominion lord i recognize you're not waiting for some future day for your children to become sons but now we are the sons of god i pray god you'd help us to recognize that help us to take dominion quit giving in so easily to the devil he just throws something at us and we just take it god i pray that we would walk forward or not take this as a rebuke tonight but as a as a warning lord we we want to be everything we can be we want to serve your purpose lord we weren't put here just to say well i'm predestinated i'll make it no we want to serve your purpose whatever that is lord to live a life of holiness and godliness lord to be an influence on those around us to be happy and free we were born to be like children before the father i pray you'd help us to recognize that tonight and i pray you would touch every heart lord as
