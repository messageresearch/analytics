[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to our Bible study again tonight such a privilege to be able to do this for you I want to say while some of you are joining we've had quite a day here and storms last night knocked out the internet so we've had to deal with that and then had some other things going on and just kind of a rush today to try to get everything put together but I am happy to announce as we've told most of you but if you don't know that we are going to have church here on Sunday morning of course we'll still be subject to our social distancing requirements we'll still have to deal with some of the things that you know not shaking hands and not giving each other hugs as much as we'd like to do that and but I'd rather deal with that and at least be able to be together so there's signs on the door posted on the door of the church explaining what to do and the Deacons will help with that as well and and we'll do everything we can to make sure that everybody is able to come in and and sit with us and and be a part of the service I don't think it'll be too crowded so we won't probably have to worry about that but we do appreciate if you're able to come some of you haven't seen in almost a month and a half two months and so thank you for bearing with us during this time thank you for being patient with us I'm sure that we've made some mistakes and doing the streaming of some of the things that we've done and in trying to work it all out and getting as many people in here as we could some of you have been here every week and helped and thank you for your faithfulness and others have not been able to be here and so we thank you for understanding and allowing us to do this but it looks like things are loosening up to where we can slowly just get back to normal but for now at least we're going to be able to have Church so god bless you let's have a word of Prayer before we get started tonight Heavenly Father I'm so grateful to Lord to be able to enter in to the study again tonight and thankful for all that you do for us she was so good to us every day and and allow us to do this tonight as it was on my heart and I pray father that you would help us to continue to do what we need to do and help those that are in the church and those that are in need father I thank you for them I pray that each one would be whole would be well physically Lord we think of all the requests that have been given us during the week and I pray that you'd meet every one of those needs sorted father I know that you can and then that you will that you want to this is your desire to meet the needs of your children you wouldn't give your children a serpent or or something like that but you would give us what we have need of and we're so grateful for that today father we ask you for all the things that we have need of Lord and then we ask father that we could be of service to you in some way in our lives but you bless this study tonight and everything that we say and everything that we do would be for your glory we pray in Jesus name Amen amen we're gonna be going from the book of Corinthians again this is part four of our study on the book of Corinthians I want to review verses 17 through 25 briefly that's what we went over last time in part 3 we found out that we are not saved by baptism alone we also found out that how we preach matters in other words the inspired preaching of the word still has a place in the church and but it's not to be done by wisdom or to promote a man but it's to be done to promote the word the word is what matters Paul says I preach Christ crucified and we found out that philosophers lawyers and mystics did not discover Christ or did not they searched for the truth but they never found the truth but the truth come to the world by Christ by Jesus Christ and so though they are smart and intelligent yet they don't understand God but God comes and tells us what's in his word and we believe it and then we found that the world has entertainment they're able to do that and Paul deals with that and in the entertainment of that day of great eloquent speakers and we could deal with that today in the entertainment of that the world has the worldly Church has the world has entertainment so brother Branham tells us give them Jesus that's what we have need of is Jesus tonight I've got Peter and Esther here helping me once again so thankful to them for doing that I was reminded as we get into this tonight as well that next Wednesday night we won't be doing this the Lord willing we'll be able to have live service next Wednesday night at seven o'clock it'll be at the regular time next Wednesday night at seven o'clock so if you're just joining us we're going to begin going live having live services again in-person services on Sunday morning and then Wednesday night at 7 o'clock let's go back to the study the Corinthians 1:26 let's begin there tonight Corinthians 1st Corinthians 1:26 he says for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called I'm glad he said not many the there was a lady who was a noble person and she said that she was saved by M because he didn't say not in he said not many but he said not many not many wise men not many mighty not many noble are called there are basically three claims to aristocracy and and that is to be cultured to be powerful or to be born noble and those are the things that we still deal with today and pull dealt with those and in the New Testament I believe it was James who dealt with those or John who said don't have the faith with respective persons and so we need to we still have to deal with this today so if Paul says there were not many of you that were cultured many of you that were powerful many of you that had a noble birth and if you look at the same is true today who comes to the gospel who heard the message of Jesus the common people heard him gladly and we find today that the common people believe the message gladly but many times the cultured the powerful and the widows of noble birth have a hard time accepting the message of the hour and so brother Branham talks about that and especially as it as it deals with the culture those that are wise those that are smart if we can put it that way he says he said this gospel shall be preached he said who's gonna preach it God is able to take the ignorance God is able to rise up stones for children to Abraham God can do whatever he wants to do He is God and that's the way he does it aren't you glad he's God and we're not he said when he come he never called Caiaphas he never called one priest he never called one theologian he took fishermen herdsmen and the ignorant and unlearned the Bible said that Peter and John were both ignorant and unlearned but he could give them and work through them the kingdom of God and confound the eyes and the minds of the wise and the mighty in acts 4:13 is where brother Branham takes this from where they were they called them unlearned and ignorant men it says they marveled they took knowledge of them that they'd been with Jesus because they spoke with boldness even though they were unlearned and ignorant and they didn't understand how that could be that word is literally illiterate idiots illiterate idiots and that sounds like strong language but it's actually the language of the original Greek unlearned is unlettered or illiterate and the word for it for its we'll go back it's it's it unlearned and ignorant so I'm learned actually means unlettered or what we would call ignorant and ignorant is an ignoramus or an idiot that's actually where that word comes from the Greek word idiota so it literally could be translated the illiterate idiots that's what the world thought of them they thought that they didn't have another education they didn't have enough power they didn't have enough noble birth to be able to be the ones would have this message of truth and yet they were and I want to deal especially tonight with the the third thing that Paul talks about he talks about culture he talks about power he talks about the wise the mighty but he also talks about the noble and that is would be those who are born into a certain status and we have that in the message today where people are born into a certain status and we need to be careful with that I am myself I'm a third generation message believer my children are fourth generation message believers so this is dear to my heart we need to make sure that we don't have what brother Adam calls Pentecostal grandchildren so brother Branham deals with the the Pentecostal people of his day and he says a few years ago he said they had real Pentecost men and women who got down with the altar and paid the price and come through brother and lived the life yes sir well what did they do they brought their children in set them on the roads and dedicated them in the church and they were Pentecostal that's grandchildren and he goes on in in the church choosing law for grace he says and what do we do we bring in our children put them on the role and the sinner out there so he deals not only with those who are born in the church but even in a sinner that would come in he joins the Pentecostal church and we say oh isn't that wonderful he come to be Pentecostal he's a grandchild so it's not just those that are born in the church but those that come in he said the trouble with our Pentecostal movements another message perseverance so the trouble with our Pentecostal movement were getting Pentecostal grandchildren they come in because our fathers and mothers were Pentecostal we taken them in on the cradle roll and they come up without the experience and there they say they're Pentecostal too he said no sir God don't have grandchildren he ain't grandpa he's father he's not as he said in many places an old Dodie grandpa but he's father right he said if you ever get to heaven you'll pay the price like your mother did like your daddy did you and and brother branham deals with this and you can go read this maybe for yourself and the smyrnaean church age in the church age book but the Branham deals with this in a little more depth he says no age ever comes back no revival ever comes back he said it can't have the life of God in it by natural generation and so all the things that we could do by going through the forms of worship of making people message people of all the teaching that we could give our children is wonderful and I believe our children ought to be taught and if we teach them correctly then they'll be saved but yet it takes a regeneration from above they have to be saved now we believe that they will be saved but they have to be saved they have to have an experience with God he said it takes a regeneration from above he said this last stage started with the fires of a Pentecostal revival and they organized it right back now notice what they did and you know the reason there were Pentecostal grandchildren is because there were Pentecostal adults who organized we need to make sure that we don't organize put a period on what we believe to make sure that our children are not Pentecostal grandchildren he deals with this he said this last stage started that way instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done listen to this substituted the manual for the word substituted the manual for the word so the manual would be you just this way you do this you do this you do that you come to church you're dedicated you're baptized I want all of those things for my children but I want them to have an experience with God where they met God on the backside of the desert to where they know that God met them and then no one could talk them out of that so so but the reason why these Pentecostal grandchildren existed is because the parents substituted the manual for the word he said just you step outside that manual and see what happens you're out brother in other words you get out of their orthodoxy whatever that is their Creed he said they will persecute you and blame it on God they'll say they're doing God a service he goes on he says how they love their organization he said no wonder there are second generation Pentecostals and since God doesn't have grandchildren they are just children of their fathers known by their creeds and form of worship why the father's organized to protect what they had which was something real and the children just become grandchildren not children of God so he said they're known by their Creed's and form of worship as so many today are whether that's known by fanaticism or known by legalism they're known by their Creed's and form of worship but we want to be known by being like Christ's like they were they were illiterate idiots but they were still known that they were they had been with Jesus because they spoke the word boldly and but these were known by their Creed's in form of worship he said they can talk about what used to be but they can't produce it all that how that makes my heart stirred he said once they had the lightning but about all that is left is the thunder let them talk to you about the glories of their movement they will say yes sir I want you to know that this is a move that no man started it came spontaneously the spirit fell all over the world yes sir we got what they had at Pentecost this was not of men but of God brother Branham says Dan why didn't they keep it that way why didn't they keep it that way because they injected Creed's they denominated they organized and when they did they died and so the children just become Pentecostal grandchildren in the efficient church age brother Branham continues dealing with this and excuse me for kind of bearing down on this and getting away from Corinthians just for a moment but it has to do with what Paul is talking about not many why it's not many cultured not many noble are not many mighty not many noble not many that are born with the with you or you can trace back their lineage all the way back and the Pharisees maybe could trace their lineage back as Paul could he said I'm of the tribe of Benjamin a Pharisee of the Pharisees they could trace their lineage back but he needed to be born again we may be able to trace our lineage back to the very first message believers but we still need to be born again brother Branham says salvation has not passed on by natural birth any more than is there any truth to apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and they're now Baptist Methodist etc and he said that is exactly what they are - they're not Christians what did the people at Corinth do they took a denominational name they called themselves a Paul a Paulus of Christ of Peter but they were it was a denominational name he said that is exactly what they are - they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God excuse me not the will of man to be saved first Corinthians 1:27 we'll leave that there but oh I want my children to be saved don't you want your children to be saved and other children of the message but we've got to get them to Christ and the way that we do that is by keeping the fire ourselves by our generation not becoming an organization by us not and there will be you say well every generation does but there's got to be somebody who breaks that cycle of revival and death there's got to be somebody who keeps the fire because we're not called to another organization and then another message but this is the end of the end there so this is a bride that will not fall and so I trust that we are a people who can keep our testimony and then our children will have their revival now first Corinthians 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise good honest chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty so grateful for that the base things of the world I'm reading these two together because they kind of go together and we'll take them together our study base things of the world things which are despised if God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are the God's Word version of the the Bible I I like the way it renders this these verses in 27 and 28 he says but God shows what the world considers nonsense to put wise people to shame God shows what the world considers weak to put what is strong to shame God shows what the world considers ordinary and what it despises what it considers to be nothing in order to destroy what it considers to be something God chose and and Paul uses that powerful phrase three times God chose God chose God chose because it is God's choosing that we are what we are he chose the foolish next slide the foolish it's the Greek word morose where we get our word for more on the dole the stupid as I said Paul uses strong language and the Greek he chose the weak the feeble and the impotent he chose the base the agendas the without Ken unknown descent and this is a direct contrast to the wise and the powerful and the the wise and the mighty and those of noble birth and here is the foolish in the weak and those of no birth but he confounds them he confounds the wise and and the mighty and those of noble birth because he chose those who would believe as Jesus said he said I think the father because you've hid these things from the wise of the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes aren't you glad to be a baby when it comes to those things to be able to learn from God to not have so much education that you can't learn from God education is wonderful but not if you have so much you can't learn from God not have so much of this world's goods that you can't learn from God here's a people he's called not many mighty not many noble not many powerful not many wise but here's a people that he's called to do his will and here's the reason why it does it verse 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence it's a powerful scripture but the Branham tells us that he won't share his glory with nobody this is in an absolute in 1963 he says I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass by you I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you paying the attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you he will share his glory with nobody that's right don't you watch the messenger watch the message we could take this two different directions there are those who watch the messenger to make him a god but there are those who watch the messenger to catch every mistake that he made and that's who he's talking to if you look at the context of it is those who would look at the it's mannerisms and look at how he used his words inappropriately sometimes and just didn't use the right English or something like that said pulpit instead of pulpit or whatever that it would be but he said don't you watch that because if you get to watching the messenger God will take it away from you he won't share his glory that's why he calls people like William Branham that's why he calls people like men prove it that's why he calls us as word of life Tabernacle he calls us because God won't share his glory with nobody he calls people with faults and failures to preach the Word of God he calls people that are that are empty so he can fill them up and give them something to say don't watch the messenger God will take it away from me he will share his glory with nobody that's right don't you watch the messenger watch the message verse 30 he said but of him are ye in Christ Jesus I have this underline in my Bible or I've read it in the past and I underlined this verse because it means so much to me he says but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption not our wisdom his wisdom is made to us wisdom not our righteousness his righteousness he is made unto us righteousness not our sanctification but his sanctification he made unto us sanctification we can be sanctified we can be justified which is what righteousness means we can be redeemed because we are of him he has made him unto us these things but he says but of him are ye that's interesting brother Branham says remember all a breed that ever come to God comes the same way so and that's gonna continue to the end of the Gentile dispensation my friends it's it doesn't stop you have to be born again you must be born again remember all Abraham a seed that ever come to God comes the same way not nothing you could do you could not save yourselves no more than you could take your bootstraps and jump over the moon you cannot save yourself no man ever sought God it's God seeking man you never chose me said Jesus I choose you verse 31 he said that according as it is written here's why that he put all of this in Christ he said according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord that's why Paul later says that my strain his strength is made perfect in my weakness so my glory if I'm gonna glory he said let me glory in my faults because those are the places is the places where he became strong in my life he took the opportunity he didn't necessarily use the weakness but he took the opportunity the weakness presented to make it a strength and brother branham understood this that if we're gonna make it we're gonna make it by grace I think every one of us ought to be able to honestly say that tonight if we're gonna make it it's gonna be because of him if we have anything to be proud of because we're in Christ if we have anything to be proud of it's not because we're of the party of Paul or the party of Apollo's or the party of Peter or the party of Christ it's because we are in Christ so because we're a part the body of Christ brother Brendan says so when you all get over home a lot of you maybe said if you happen to go before me and you're living in your great big fine palace over there he said you hear an echo coming across the hill somewhere look over on the other side of the hill and he said you see my little Hut down there somewhere among the evergreens and I'm standing out on the front porch singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound you say well praise God oh brother branham finally made it so I'll be over on the other side he said over there with Amazing Grace if I ever get there it'll be amazing grace His grace bought it for me and I'm going by His grace alone alone I'm not going because of a good preacher I'm not going because I did jump through all the hoops and I was baptized in a message church and grew up on a message Pew I'm not going because my daddy was a preacher or I'm a preacher or or I have children in the church whatever that it is I'm not going because of my natural birth I'm going because of Amazing Grace the same amazing grace that can save the worst sinner on the street let's remember who we are remember where we come from remember that God can save to the uttermost who can god safe God can save anyone who has a desire to be saved because it's by Amazing Grace how sweet the sound brother Branham said that's the way I trust it tonight then I know that you do the same I trust that we know that as well let's bow our heads together evenly father's were out of time for this study I thank you for all that you've revealed to me during this time and I pray father there would be a help in some way I know that it's simple and maybe not what people expect but I trusted it will be a help we've had trouble during the during the day but we know when we would do good evil is present but we know that you're with us and we thank you for that father we're going to take the opportunity here this weekend of the Lord willing if you are willing Lord to have Church together once again Oh what that means to us father we thank you for allowing us to do that if it be your will and I pray God that you would just move pray you would protect us for you to help us to be sensible and wise and to follow the directions that we've been given and to do our best to make sure that we have the kind of service that you would want us to have father I pray you'd help us to reach out in some way Lord to help may we realize that we needed grace to be where we're at today we didn't get it just by being born in the message but we needed the grace of God and I pray Heavenly Father that we would extend that grace to others when we meet someone Lord that we could offer them that grace they could see by our boldness Lord that we've been with Jesus we may be illiterate we may be unlearned but we've been with Jesus thank you for all that you do for us I pray you'd bless each one now until Sunday morning in Jesus name Amen god bless you
