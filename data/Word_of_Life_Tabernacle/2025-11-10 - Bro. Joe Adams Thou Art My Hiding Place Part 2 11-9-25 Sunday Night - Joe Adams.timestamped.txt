[38:38] refuge?
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; You have a rock. You have a shelter. You
[38:43] have a strong tower. [music]
[38:44] &gt;&gt; You have an absolute. You have a
[38:46] tiepost.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; What a blessed people we are.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; We are very blessed to have a hiding
[38:55] place in this hour. Let's just go to him
[38:58] in prayer. Father, we rejoice in
[39:00] knowing, Lord, no matter what befalls us
[39:02] on this side of eternity,
[39:06] Lord, we're sheltered in the wings of
[39:09] the Almighty,
[39:11] we have peace in our storms, Lord. We
[39:14] have the assurance in the gable end of
[39:15] our souls
[39:17] that God, we may not see the end, but we
[39:20] know the one who does.
[39:22] We're here today, fathers, your
[39:24] children,
[39:27] asking, Lord, for wisdom, direction,
[39:29] leadership, guidance.
[39:32] God, open up our hearts that we may
[39:34] receive your word. [music] Lord, anoint
[39:37] our ears to hear what this spirit would
[39:39] say to the church.
[39:41] Father, anoint these lips to speak only
[39:43] those things that would edify you and
[39:46] build up your bride. So, Lord God, we
[39:49] just come before you tonight.
[39:51] thankful for another service, another
[39:53] opportunity to serve you and to worship
[39:56] you. Lord,
[39:59] we just pray God you'd move tonight.
[40:02] Maybe not in a way of an altar call,
[40:04] Lord, or
[40:06] or however you would move, but Lord, we
[40:08] just pray that you would move in their
[40:10] hearts and their lives to see the
[40:12] reality of this word
[40:14] and that through this word, God, they
[40:16] can find their place.
[40:19] they can find that shelter, they can
[40:22] find that peace.
[40:24] So we commit this service to you, Lord.
[40:27] We ask for your hand of mercy to be upon
[40:29] us now in Jesus name. If you have your
[40:31] Bibles tonight, [clears throat]
[40:35] we're going to have you look in Psalms
[40:36] 27. Very, very, very familiar scripture
[40:40] to us who are believers.
[40:42] Psalms 27 and verse one.
[40:45] And I want to pick back up on the same
[40:47] title that we preached this morning.
[40:50] Thou art my hiding place. And
[40:54] try to kind of bring this to a
[40:58] a conclusion. Here's David is speaking.
[41:00] He said, "The Lord is the light of my
[41:03] salvation. Otherwise, he's the
[41:05] illumination. He's my joy. Whom shall I
[41:09] fear?"
[41:10] You think about what God is to you
[41:12] tonight.
[41:14] What have we to fear?
[41:16] &gt;&gt; That he's the light of my salvation.
[41:19] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[41:21] strength. And that word there means
[41:22] safety, protection, refuge, and
[41:25] stronghold.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; So he is the strength. He is the refuge.
[41:28] He is the stronghold. He's the
[41:30] protection of my life. In whom shall I
[41:34] be afraid?
[41:36] When the wicked, even my enemies and my
[41:38] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh,
[41:41] they stumbled and they fell. Though a
[41:42] host should encamp against me, my heart
[41:45] shall not fear. Though war shall rise
[41:47] against me, in this will I be confident.
[41:50] One thing have I desired of the Lord,
[41:52] and that will I seek after, that I may
[41:54] dwell. That word dwell means to sit, to
[41:57] inhabit, to marry, to abide in the house
[42:00] of the Lord all the days of my life, to
[42:03] behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
[42:05] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[42:08] of trouble, he shall hide me in his
[42:10] pavilion. In the secret of his
[42:12] tabernacle shall he hide me, and he
[42:14] shall set me upon a rock. God bless you.
[42:17] You can have your seats tonight.
[42:21] Not [clears throat] going to hold you
[42:22] too long. Like uh brother David said, we
[42:24] have a long drive back tonight. So if I
[42:26] don't shake any of your hands, just know
[42:28] that we were blessed to see you again.
[42:30] Uh it's always a pleasure to be here.
[42:33] Lifelong friends. And uh I was telling
[42:35] the brothers in the back, this is where
[42:37] I learned to preach.
[42:39] preached in many of services right here
[42:41] at Word of Life Tabernacle. And uh you
[42:44] guys, many of you that know me and go
[42:45] way back, you were very longsuffering
[42:47] for a young man just learning how to cut
[42:49] his teeth and preach. But I I pray by
[42:52] God's grace that we have matured along
[42:53] the way and we'll be able to speak
[42:55] something to you this evening that'll
[42:57] feed you. But we find here in the
[42:59] scriptures, the Bible would tell us in
[43:01] Psalms 27 and verse4, in the time or
[43:05] this word here actually means a period
[43:07] or a season of trouble. And it seems
[43:10] like we go through seasons of calamity
[43:13] and seasons of difficulties. But we have
[43:16] a promise that in that time of trouble,
[43:19] he is going to hide us. That word there
[43:21] means to cover us. Cover us in his
[43:24] pavilion. And that word pavilion there
[43:26] is his chamber. And it's given reference
[43:28] to a a wedding chamber, a bridal
[43:31] chamber, you know, it's a not just any
[43:33] room of the house, but it's that special
[43:35] room, that designated room that not just
[43:38] anybody can enter into. It's it's a
[43:40] privileged person that can enter into
[43:43] that place. And here we find to hide in
[43:46] his pavilion in the secret of his
[43:48] tabernacle of his his protection. And
[43:51] he's going to set me upon a rock. Notice
[43:54] here that word rock there as we are well
[43:56] assure of and well know it's a
[43:58] revelation. So and brother Brandon would
[44:00] take this Psalms here and he would take
[44:02] Psalms 27 and he WOULD BEGIN TO PREACH
[44:05] THE RAPTURE MESSAGE BECAUSE HE
[44:07] UNDERSTANDS THAT IF THE BELIEVER CAN
[44:08] EVER CATCH THAT REVELATION THAT IF
[44:11] THEY'RE IN CHRIST AND CHRIST IS IN THEM
[44:14] THEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT COMES THEIR
[44:15] WAY THAT'S GOING TO SHAKE THEM. THERE'S
[44:17] NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO MOVE THEM FROM
[44:19] WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE WHY? BECAUSE THEY
[44:22] ARE HIDDEN IN CHRIST AND CHRIST IS
[44:24] HIDDEN HIS LIFE IN THEM.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; But we must understand now I think a lot
[44:31] of times I was sharing in the back just
[44:33] recently and you know for many years as
[44:35] I matured into the message it seems like
[44:38] for the most part the message as we CALL
[44:40] IT IS ALL BEEN ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM
[44:42] AND I don't say that lightly. I say that
[44:44] with all due respect, BUT WE MADE THE
[44:47] MESSAGE ABOUT ONE MAN AND WE'VE FOREGONE
[44:49] AND WE'VE GOT AWAY FROM THE NEW BIRTH
[44:52] EXPERIENCE BECAUSE A NEW BIRTH
[44:54] EXPERIENCE IS WHAT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU
[44:56] AND TAKE YOU INTO A RAPTURE. NOT JUST
[44:58] HAVING AN IDEA OF A MAN, NOT HAVING THE
[45:01] KNOWLEDGE OF A MAN, NOT HAVING JUST AN
[45:03] ACQUAINTANCE WITH A MAN, BUT TO HAVE
[45:05] THAT NEW BIRTH IS WHERE IT LIES TODAY.
[45:08] AND WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH? THEY ASKED
[45:10] BROTHER BRANDON, "WHAT IS THE NEW
[45:11] BIRTH?" IT'S THE PERSONAL REVELATION OF
[45:14] JESUS CHRIST to you.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; A PERSONAL REVELATION,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; NOT A SECONDHANDED REVELATION.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S CHRIST IN YOU. THAT'S THE
[45:26] REVELATION that the church was built on.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; And that's why he's preached. He would
[45:32] preach the rapture message. If you ever
[45:35] get that personal revelation,
[45:39] then nothing's going to keep you from a
[45:40] rapture.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Young person, you may go to camp meeting
[45:44] after camp meeting after camp meeting
[45:45] after camp meeting. But until you have
[45:48] that new birth experience,
[45:51] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
[45:52] PEOPLE THAT WALKED AMONG US. THERE'S
[45:54] BEEN A LOT OF MEN WHO USED TO PREACH
[45:56] THIS MESSAGE, BUT THEY NEVER GOT THE NEW
[45:59] BIRTH EXPERIENCE. AND TODAY, THEY DON'T
[46:01] WALK WITH US. TODAY. THEY ARE AGAINST
[46:04] US. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, GOD HAS CALLED
[46:06] A PEOPLE TO HAVE A NEW BIRTH. AND HE'S
[46:09] GOING TO HIDE THEIR HIS LIFE INSIDE OF
[46:11] THEM. AND NOTICE, NOT ONLY THAT, BUT
[46:14] THEY ARE HIDDEN IN CHRIST JESUS. SO NO
[46:16] MATTER WHAT COMES THEIR WAY, THEY HAVE
[46:19] THE REVELATION THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE A
[46:21] RAPTURE.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; I LIKE HOW BROTHER WOULD TELL US. HE
[46:25] SAID, "THE MESSAGE CALLS THE BRIDE
[46:27] TOGETHER."
[46:29] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE
[46:32] SEE WHAT A HIDING PLACE WE HAVE. MARRIED
[46:35] TO THE VIRTUOUS SON OF GOD. NOW NOTICE,
[46:37] AND I like how he says it, we never sin
[46:39] in the first place.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; WHERE WERE YOU AT IN THE FIRST PLACE? IN
[46:43] THE THOUGHTS OF GOD, IN THE MIND OF GOD.
[46:45] AND THINK ABOUT IT, NO OTHER AGE, NO
[46:47] OTHER GIFT, NO OTHER MAN BUT IN THIS
[46:50] HOUR, IN THIS AGE, GOD SENT A MAN HERE
[46:52] THAT WENT INTO THE VERY BACK PARTS OF
[46:55] GOD'S THINKING, TO THE BACK PART OF
[46:57] GOD'S MIND AND BEGIN TO PULL OUT THE
[46:59] VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD AND PREACH IT TO A
[47:01] PEOPLE.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; In the back part of God's mind, he had a
[47:06] bride. He had a people.
[47:11] as I begin to preach and study on this
[47:14] hiding place and WE FIND DAVID SAYING,
[47:16] "THOU ART MY HIDING PLACE." And we know
[47:19] that the SCRIPTURES CAN BE TWOFOLD. I
[47:21] BELIEVE IT WAS GOD SPEAKING TO DAVID,
[47:23] TELLING DAVID, DAVID, THAT THOU ART my
[47:26] hiding place because God is hidden in
[47:29] simplicity.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; He's hidden in a PEOPLE
[47:33] &gt;&gt; HERE IN HARDY, ARKANSAS. OH, YOU MAY NOT
[47:35] LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT TO GOD, YOU'RE
[47:37] EVERYTHING. AND GOD HAS HIDDEN HIS LIFE
[47:40] IN YOU THROUGH A PERSONAL REVELATION,
[47:42] THROUGH A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND
[47:44] THAT'S WHERE WE GOT TO GET TO. DON'T GET
[47:46] THEM TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PROPHET. GET
[47:48] THEM TO THE NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PROPHET IS GREAT. YOU
[47:54] HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE and if you
[47:56] get to THE NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE, you
[47:58] will see the prophet's position,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; but you'll also see your position, sir.
[48:05] Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at another thought that I'll
[48:07] preach at some point. Looking at the
[48:10] unnamed servant in Genesis 24. You
[48:13] believe HERE ABRAHAM, HIS HIGHEST
[48:15] SERVANT.
[48:17] When you GO LOOK IN GENESIS 24, THIS IS
[48:19] SENDING FORTH OF ELEAZAR.
[48:23] But in Genesis 24, the longest chapter
[48:25] in Genesis,
[48:27] he never gives him a name.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because it's not ABOUT THE
[48:32] MAN.
[48:33] IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE MAN. IT'S
[48:35] ALWAYS GO GET ME A BRIDE FOR MY SON.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE ENTIRE GENESIS 24 WAS
[48:41] ABOUT. IT WASN'T ABOUT ELIJAH. IT WAS
[48:44] NEVER ABOUT A MAN. AND LET ME TELL YOU,
[48:46] THIS MESSAGE HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT A MAN.
[48:48] IT'S BEEN ABOUT GET A BRIDE. CALL
[48:50] [screaming] HER OUT OF SIN. CALL HER OUT
[48:52] OF DENOMINATIONS. CALL HER OUT OF THOSE
[48:53] DARK DENOMINATIONS. CALL ME A
[48:55] [screaming] BRIDE. BRING HER TO ME.
[48:57] DON'T GO TO THE THE THINGS OF THE WORLD.
[48:58] CALL HER OUT
[49:00] &gt;&gt; OF MY PEOPLE.
[49:03] BUT WE'VE MADE IT
[49:05] &gt;&gt; TO THE SHAME OF THE MESSAGE. WE MADE IT
[49:08] ABOUT A MAN AND PEOPLE ARE SHIPWRECKED
[49:10] down the way
[49:14] &gt;&gt; and we made it about oh if you see a
[49:17] prophet if you believe the message then
[49:20] you got the Holy Ghost.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; And then when the hard times come we
[49:24] spoke about this morning brother Danny
[49:25] they get shook
[49:27] &gt;&gt; because they don't have an experience.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; They only have a head knowledge.
[49:32] This is what we do. THIS IS CHURCH. THIS
[49:35] IS WHAT WE LEARN. IT SOUNDS GOOD. IT ALL
[49:37] FITS TOGETHER. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
[49:39] RAPTURE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
[49:41] PREDESTINATED PEOPLE. WE TALKING ABOUT
[49:43] THE ELECTED OF GOD THAT WERE IN THE BACK
[49:45] PART OF GOD'S MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[49:48] OF THE WORLD. AND IN THIS HOUR, GOD SENT
[49:50] YOU A PROPHET TO DO WHAT? TO MANIFEST.
[49:54] TO REVEAL THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; WHAT A people we are.
[50:00] Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Listen how your prophet says this and I
[50:05] want to be very respectful because I
[50:06] don't want you to I don't want to come
[50:07] across as I don't believe the message or
[50:09] I don't believe God sent a prophet
[50:10] because I will do I want to be very
[50:13] respectful but we got to place these
[50:15] things in the right order.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Now let me go back to Genesis. This is
[50:19] not even in my notes. When you look in
[50:20] Genesis 24 this track that Eleazar had
[50:25] to make was 900 mile journey.
[50:28] Now if you go and you study the
[50:30] scriptures, you look before at the time
[50:33] before Ishmael was born,
[50:37] there was no heir to Abraham. But my
[50:40] servant, this Eleazar of Damascus.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; So he was the ONLY ONE. AND SO LET'S
[50:46] JUST PER SAY HE WAS WITH Abraham 10
[50:48] years or five years prior to Ishmael's
[50:51] birth. At the time of Genesis 24, Isaac
[50:54] was 20. He was 40 years old. So that put
[50:57] Ishmael at 55, 54. That put the the
[51:02] servant at 65.
[51:05] So he's not a young man. And we don't
[51:08] know how old he was when he came. Let's
[51:10] say he was 20. So now, NOT ONLY IS HE
[51:12] 65, HE'S AN 85 YEAR OLD MAN ABOUT TO
[51:15] MAKE A 900MILE JOURNEY FOR ONE PURPOSE.
[51:19] HE NEVER TOLD UH REBECCA ABOUT HIMSELF.
[51:22] HE NEVER TOLD HER ABOUT WHAT HE LIKES.
[51:24] HE NEVER TOLD HER ABOUT WHAT HE HAS BACK
[51:26] HOME. BUT EVERYTHING THAT HE EXPRESSED
[51:28] TO REBECCA WAS ABOUT MY MY MASTER, MY
[51:31] MASTER, MY MASTER, MY MASTER. HE SAID
[51:34] THE WORD MASTER 22 TIMES IN THE BOOK OF
[51:37] GENESIS 24 CUZ IT WAS NEVER ABOUT
[51:39] ELEAZAR. BUT IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT MY
[51:42] MASTER. MY MASTER'S GOT A SON. MY
[51:44] MASTER'S GOT A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND
[51:46] HEELS. MY MASTER'S GOT WEALTH UNTOLD. MY
[51:49] MASTER'S GOT HEALING. MY MASTER'S GOT
[51:51] DELIVERANCE. MY MASTER'S GOT THE HOLY
[51:53] GHOST. MY MASTER HAS A HIDING PLACE. MY
[51:55] MASTER [screaming] HAS IT ALL.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO EXPRESS THE LOVE FOR HIS
[52:00] MASTER SO [screaming] MUCH THAT REBECCA
[52:02] WOULD LEAVE EVERYTHING SHE'S EVER KNOWN.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE, WALK AWAY FROM HER
[52:07] FAMILY, WALK AWAY FROM HER LIFESTYLE,
[52:08] [screaming] WALK AWAY FROM THE BAR, WALK
[52:10] AWAY FROM THE DRUGS, WALK AWAY FROM THE
[52:12] SIN, WALK AWAY FROM THE ONLY CHURCH
[52:14] SHE'S EVER KNOWN TO FOLLOW THIS ONE.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the way the message has got
[52:21] to be preached.
[52:23] Don't take me to Ezer. Take me to
[52:26] Christ.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Take me to him.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I left everything
[52:31] &gt;&gt; for him.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the message he sent the
[52:35] servant who had no name because they're
[52:38] never about the servant,
[52:40] &gt;&gt; but it was about the bride. Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Brother B would tell us
[52:46] they marched out, referring back to
[52:47] Israel, THEY MARCHED OUT of Egypt on the
[52:52] strength of the testimony of this
[52:54] prophet with their pillar of fire over
[52:56] him because he was sent. God had proved
[52:59] that he was WITH THEM.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; THEY MARCHED OUT UNDER THE testimony
[53:04] of what he declared.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And you would have thought they would
[53:08] have been complete believers after the
[53:11] Red Sea.
[53:13] See, he called a nation
[53:14] &gt;&gt; out of a nation. The Holy Spirit,
[53:16] BROTHER B SAYS, IS CALLING A BRIDE OUT
[53:18] OF A CHURCH. A CHURCH OUT OF A CHURCH
[53:21] MEMBERS FROM EVERY DENOMINATION, MAKING
[53:24] UP THE BRIDE. YOU SEE, THE BRIDE NOW IS
[53:26] THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE
[53:28] RAPTURE. THAT ALONE, NOTHING BUT THE
[53:30] BRIDE, THE ELECTED ONES FORNOWN BY GOD
[53:33] FROM THE BEGINNING, THE FATHER'S
[53:34] spiritual genes.
[53:37] And that's what we're here for today.
[53:39] Why did God send a message to call a
[53:41] church out of a church? To call a bride
[53:46] out of dark denominationalism.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; What did HE DO? HE IF HE CALLED you out,
[53:50] church, he's taking you somewhere.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T CALL YOU out to leave you.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; He doesn't call you out so you f excuse
[53:59] me, you f for yourself, but he's called
[54:02] you out of Egypt to take you into
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Canaan.
[54:07] Yes, sir.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; See, he calls the bride out of these
[54:11] things. And what's he do? He takes us to
[54:13] the opening of the word.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Think about that. The opening of the
[54:20] word. Now, we've had seven church ages.
[54:23] We're in the final church age. But never
[54:26] before until this end time have we've
[54:29] had the fullness, the opening of the
[54:31] word.
[54:34] And so we're speaking about a hiding
[54:36] place. So it can only come into
[54:38] manifestation at the end. The true
[54:42] hiding place as your prophet would
[54:44] preach a token message after the opening
[54:46] of the seals. He said outside of the
[54:48] opening of the seals, the most ordained
[54:50] message that I've ever preached was the
[54:52] token message.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW IT WASN'T JUST A GOOSEBUMP.
[54:57] NOW IT WASN'T JUST A SHOUT. NOW, IT
[54:59] WASN'T JUST A A YOU KNOW, JUST A AN UH
[55:01] THE HOLY GHOST ON THE FLESH, BUT NOW
[55:04] IT'S THE PERSON OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S
[55:06] THE TOKEN LIFE IN THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT'S
[55:09] OUR TRUE HIDING PLACE.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR TRUE SAFETY. OUTSIDE OF THAT
[55:14] TOKEN LIFE, YOUNG PERSON, YOU'RE NOT
[55:16] SAVED.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF THAT TOKEN,
[55:22] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SAFE. BUT NOTICE THEY CAME OUT
[55:25] ON THE testimony of a prophet.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; We're going somewhere.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S THREE STAGES FOR THE STEWARD
[55:35] OF THE JOURNEY. SO THEY LEFT EGYPT UNDER
[55:37] JUSTIFICATION believing a word. They
[55:39] separated themselves FROM THE EGYPTIANS
[55:41] AND COME OUT. THEY CROSSED THE RED SEA,
[55:44] KILLED THE THINGS THAT WERE BEHIND THEM,
[55:46] WHICH WAS THE SANCTIFICATION THROUGH THE
[55:47] BLOOD THAT KILLS HUMAN DESIRES OF EVIL.
[55:51] THE SECOND STAGE OF THE JOURNEY. BUT THE
[55:53] THIRD STAGE WAS WHEN THEY CROSSED INTO
[55:55] JORDAN. SO WHAT DOES JORDAN REPRESENT?
[55:57] DEATH. Death to self.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Well, you die out to your OWN IDEAS. YOU
[56:02] DIE OUT TO YOUR OWN HABITS. YOU DIE TO
[56:04] YOURSELF. AND BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE MOVING
[56:07] INTO CANAAN LAND, THE PROMISED LAND OF
[56:10] THE HOLY GHOST,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; THE TRUE HIDING PLACE FOR THE BELIEVER
[56:15] WAS NOT IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE
[56:16] JOURNEY. IT WASN'T IN THE SECOND STAGE
[56:18] OF THE JOURNEY, BUT IT'S IN THE THIRD
[56:20] STAGE OF THE JOURNEY WHERE ALL THE
[56:22] PROMISES LAY. THEY LAY ON THE OTHER SIDE
[56:25] OF JORDAN IN CANAAN'S LAND. AND THAT'S
[56:28] WHY GOD SENT [screaming] US A PROPHET
[56:30] WAS TO TAKE US NOT ONLY OUT OF THROUGH
[56:32] THE FIRST POOL MINISTRY THROUGH THE THE
[56:34] GIFT OF THE SIGN IN THE HAND AND THE
[56:36] DISCERNING THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE SECOND
[56:37] POOL, BUT [screaming] IN THE THIRD POOL.
[56:39] AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE THIRD POOL IS
[56:40] MORE THAN SPEAKING SQUIRRELS INTO
[56:42] EXISTENCE. THE THIRD POOL MINISTRY IS
[56:45] THE OPENING OF THE WORD. IS PLACING THE
[56:47] PEOPLE IN THE HIDING PLACE OF THE HOLY
[56:50] GHOST.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; All the promises
[56:58] lay in that Canaan land.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Brother had a vision, had a dream.
[57:04] This is about 3:00 in the morning, I
[57:05] suppose. And I had gotten up and I
[57:06] looked in front of me. [clears throat]
[57:09] THERE WAS COMING DOWN THE JORDAN.
[57:12] And because I was coming down to the
[57:14] Jordan, looked like I was standing on
[57:16] the map of Palestine. And I was coming
[57:18] down to Jordan. IT SEEMED LIKE I COULD
[57:20] HEAR the song, I'm going down to the
[57:22] Jordan. Someone was singing it. And as I
[57:26] drew near the river, I looked back and I
[57:28] seen which way had come. And I was 23 of
[57:32] the way there to the Jordan.
[57:36] And I looked across JORDAN AND I SAID,
[57:38] "OH, PRAISE GOD." Just on the other side
[57:41] is where all the promises lay. SEE,
[57:45] EVERY PROMISE lays in the promised land.
[57:51] So, we've seen the first pool. We've
[57:53] seen the second pool. We've had we've
[57:56] seen the the the the third pool, which I
[57:58] believe firmly is the hiding place of
[58:00] the believer, where we're hidden into
[58:02] the word and the word hidden for the
[58:04] word, by the word, in the word. And what
[58:06] a refuge that we have. So no matter what
[58:09] shakes, how hard the storms sail, no
[58:13] matter what life travails against us and
[58:16] tries to throw upon us, and as I just
[58:18] listened to the testimony of Gabe and
[58:20] his wife and with their baby and the
[58:22] situation there, you know, WE GO THROUGH
[58:24] A LOT OF HARDSHIPS ALONG THE JOURNEY AS
[58:26] WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS MORNING. BUT AS LONG
[58:29] AS WE HAVE AN ANCHOR, AS LONG AS WE HAVE
[58:31] A HIDING PLACE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
[58:33] WE GO THROUGH AS LONG AS WE KNOW THE ONE
[58:35] THAT'S HOLDING OUR HAND. AND HE SAID THE
[58:37] THIRD PULL. NOTICE NOW
[58:39] &gt;&gt; THE THIRD PULL IS THE OPENING OF THE
[58:41] WORD. THE MYSTERIES REVEALED. AND
[58:43] THERE'S NO HIGHER ORDER TO REVEAL THE
[58:45] WORD THAN PROPHETS. BUT THE ONLY WAY A
[58:48] PROPHET CAN BE VINDICATED IS BY THE
[58:50] WORD. AND I CAN SAFELY SAY THIS MORNING,
[58:52] WE ARE SITTING UNDER THE MESSAGE OF A
[58:54] VINDICATED PROPHET SENT BY ALMIGHTY GOD.
[58:57] NOT TO JUST CALL YOU OUT, BUT TO TAKE
[59:00] YOU SOMEWHERE. AND HE'S TAKING US IN TO
[59:02] THE PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST AND
[59:04] TO A BODY CHANGE, CHURCH. YOU'RE NOT
[59:07] JUST GOING TO STAY HERE. GOD IS GOING TO
[59:09] COMPLETELY CHANGE HIS BODY. ONE MINUTE
[59:11] WE'RE GOING TO BE MORTAL. AND THE NEXT
[59:13] MOMENT WE'RE GOING TO STEP [laughter]
[59:14] OUT INTO A NEW BODY, A WELL BODY, A
[59:17] SUPERNATURAL BODY, [screaming] NEVER TO
[59:18] GET OLD, NEVER TO GET SICK, NEVER TO HAD
[59:20] A BAD DAY, NEVER TO GO THROUGH A TRIAL,
[59:22] A NEW BODY.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED. THAT'S WHY
[59:27] GOD SENT A MESSAGE.
[59:29] THIS THIS IS LIFE AIN'T an all it's not
[59:32] everything that we WANT IT TO BE.
[59:34] ABSOLUTELY NOT.
[59:36] Thank God there's more in store for the
[59:38] believer.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; He said the third pull was the opening
[59:43] of them seven seals to reveal the hidden
[59:46] truths that's been sealed in the word.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; So it's more than speaking squirrels,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; but the revealing of the third pool was
[59:58] Listen to people in their hiding place.
[1:00:03] All the promises
[1:00:06] lay right there.
[1:00:08] See, that's why even a prophet would
[1:00:10] take Joshua and he take the book of
[1:00:13] Ephesians and he say they paralleled
[1:00:16] together because he's trying to place a
[1:00:18] people into that land, into their
[1:00:21] possession, into their homeland.
[1:00:25] But when we find Israel, they came out.
[1:00:28] [clears throat]
[1:00:28] They came out on the testimony of a
[1:00:31] prophet.
[1:00:33] They left Egypt.
[1:00:35] And we look here in the scriptures when
[1:00:36] they left Egypt, they wandered in the
[1:00:38] wilderness and they came to Mount Si
[1:00:42] after two months. And they stayed around
[1:00:44] Mount Si for maybe a year or so, just a
[1:00:47] little over a year. And they DWELT
[1:00:48] THERE. SO ALONG THE JOURNEY THERE'S
[1:00:50] STOPPING AND GOING AND STOPPING AND
[1:00:52] GOING AND STOPPING and going. How many's
[1:00:55] ever stopped and went? Stopped and went,
[1:00:57] stopped and went. Hey, keep going. Keep
[1:01:00] going. KEEP GOING. DON'T STOP AND SET
[1:01:02] DOWN ROOTS OUT THERE IN THE IN THE LAND
[1:01:04] OF UH OF the wilderness out there.
[1:01:08] BUT WE FIND MANY OF US US as and I say
[1:01:12] that not to say the church here locally
[1:01:14] but MANY OF US AS MESSAGE BELIEVERS WE
[1:01:18] HAVE left out on THE SAME PROMISE THE
[1:01:20] SAME TESTIMONY OF A PROPHET. WE LEFT THE
[1:01:22] DENOMINATIONAL LIFE. WE LEFT THE SINFUL
[1:01:24] LIFE AND ALL WE'VE DONE IS WANDERED IN
[1:01:26] THE WILDERNESS. WONDER IF IT'S FOR ME.
[1:01:29] WONDER IF MY KIDS CAN HAVE THE HOLY
[1:01:30] GHOST. WONDER IF I'LL EVER BE SAVED.
[1:01:32] WONDER IF THIS HABIT'S EVER GOING TO
[1:01:33] BREAK. WONDER, WONDER, WONDER, WONDER.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR US TO STOP WONDERING,
[1:01:40] CHURCH. AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO CROSS
[1:01:42] INTO THE PROMISE OF THE WORD.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR US TO QUIT PLAYING CHURCH.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And move into our inheritance.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Well, we don't like that kind of
[1:01:57] preaching. Well, you got the wrong
[1:01:58] preacher.
[1:02:01] I rather preach you a promise
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; and preach you into the promised land
[1:02:06] than keep you from it.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz church, that's the only thing we got
[1:02:12] looking for. They came out on the
[1:02:14] testimony of a vindicated voice
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; and we find them in Deuteronomy.
[1:02:23] They come to Mount Horeb
[1:02:26] and here God speaks to Moses. And he
[1:02:28] tells them, "You had dwelt long enough
[1:02:30] in this mountain." They just went around
[1:02:32] the mountain, stayed there for a year,
[1:02:35] year and a half, camped down, got their
[1:02:36] feelings hurt in church.
[1:02:39] Oh my. Ain't nobody ever had that
[1:02:42] happen.
[1:02:43] Got the feelings hurt. We just going to
[1:02:45] stay right here. I ain't going back.
[1:02:50] What did he tell him? You have dwelt
[1:02:52] here long enough.
[1:02:55] This is not I'm going to bless you.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to bless you around the
[1:03:00] mountains. I'm not going to bless you in
[1:03:02] the wilderness. I'm going to bless you
[1:03:04] in Canaan.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Church, put your eyes on Canaan. And
[1:03:08] don't stop short. I don't care what you
[1:03:10] go through in this life. I don't care
[1:03:12] what kind of hardships you face. You put
[1:03:14] your focus on Canaan land. You put your
[1:03:16] focus on a rapture. You put your focus
[1:03:18] on the new birth. You put your focus on
[1:03:20] that life. Young person, you go to camp.
[1:03:23] Hey, I hope you jump. I HOPE YOU SHOUT,
[1:03:26] BUT YOU DON'T JUMP AND SHOUT TO GET IT.
[1:03:27] BUT AFTER YOU get it, you probably jump
[1:03:28] and shout.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; But do me a FAVOR AND DO THIS ONE THING.
[1:03:33] ONE thing have I desired of the Lord,
[1:03:35] and that will I seek, that I may dwell
[1:03:37] in the house of the Lord.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I will abide in the hiding place of the
[1:03:42] most high, and he shall hide me.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 2 and verse one. THEN WE
[1:03:48] TURNED AND WE TOOK OUR JOURNEY. NOTICE
[1:03:50] NOW HERE THEY'RE leaving Horeb. WE TOOK
[1:03:52] OUR JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS by the
[1:03:54] way of the Red Sea. AND THE LORD SPAKE
[1:03:56] UNTO ME, AND WE COMPASSED MOUNT Zir many
[1:03:59] days. And the Lord spake unto me,
[1:04:01] saying, You have compass this mountain
[1:04:03] long enough. Turn ye northward. So they
[1:04:07] left Mount Si and they wandered in the
[1:04:09] wilderness for 40 years.
[1:04:14] My my my.
[1:04:17] How long have we been wandering?
[1:04:22] 60 plus years wondering,
[1:04:26] still preaching, still preaching the
[1:04:28] same message. God sent a prophet.
[1:04:31] Push, play, and obey. Oh, I'm sorry I
[1:04:33] said that.
[1:04:37] See, we make it about a man. Push, play,
[1:04:39] and obey.
[1:04:41] It's about go get a bribe.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And we just Oh, just Hey, believe God
[1:04:46] sent a prophet and you'll be upright.
[1:04:48] Believe the message.
[1:04:50] And that's all we've made this message
[1:04:53] about.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; While the entire message is about you.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; The entire message. If you want to bring
[1:05:02] it all down in just one little phrase,
[1:05:05] the message is about a bride.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; What good would it be for him to come
[1:05:11] for just one man?
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Why did he even send Christ?
[1:05:19] just to prove that he can be the lamb of
[1:05:21] God. He sent him for one purpose
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; and it's to pay a debt that you and I
[1:05:26] couldn't pay.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; It was to get himself a bride.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Because see, a part of his plan was
[1:05:33] redemption.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And in part to fulfill the kinsman and
[1:05:37] redeemer, there had to be a man. There
[1:05:38] had to be one like us that could that
[1:05:41] can be a kinsman to us. that therefore
[1:05:43] that the sins of man will be rolled off
[1:05:45] of us and THE REPROACH BE ROLLED OFF OF
[1:05:47] US. So he had to BECOME A MAN IN ORDER
[1:05:50] TO TAKE SINS OFF OF US SO THAT WE CAN BE
[1:05:53] PLACED BACK IN THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD
[1:05:55] AGAIN. SO EVEN GOD COMING DOWN LEAVING
[1:05:58] ALL OF GLORY TAKEN ON THE FORM OF SINFUL
[1:06:01] MAN IN THE FORM OF HIS SON JESUS CHRIST
[1:06:04] WAS ALL FOR THE PURPOSE AND THE POINT OF
[1:06:06] TAKING himself a bride.
[1:06:10] And if he sent Christ for that, what
[1:06:12] about a prophet?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; What's the need of a prophet? The very
[1:06:17] same thing.
[1:06:19] BUT WE FIND THEM. THEY'VE COME OUT
[1:06:22] TWOTHIRDS OF THE journey on the
[1:06:24] testimony of a prophet. Just a wonder.
[1:06:28] Well, we God don't do those things
[1:06:30] anymore.
[1:06:32] God doesn't he doesn't do the
[1:06:34] supernatural signs and wonders of that
[1:06:36] was back in the 40s and 50s and 60s. God
[1:06:39] doesn't do that anymore. He doesn't open
[1:06:40] up blind eyes.
[1:06:43] Tell Gab's wife that he doesn't heal
[1:06:45] from rheumato arthritis. Tell sister
[1:06:48] Lana bus back home that God doesn't heal
[1:06:50] stage four lymphoma cancer.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Tell these PEOPLE THESE THINGS THAT GOD
[1:06:55] DOESN'T DO THAT YOU'RE TOO LATE.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY? BECAUSE HE IS THE SAME
[1:06:58] YESTERDAY, [cheering]
[1:06:59] [applause] TODAY, AND FOREVER. LOOK, LET
[1:07:02] THAT BE MORE THAN JUST A CLICHE.
[1:07:04] [cheering] LET [applause] THAT BE THE
[1:07:05] ABSOLUTE. GOD IS THE SAME. AND IF HE'S
[1:07:08] SAME GOD TODAY AND HE TOOK THEM OUT OF
[1:07:10] EGYPT AND PLACED THEM INTO THEIR LAND OF
[1:07:12] PROMISE, INTO THEIR HIDING PLACE, THEN
[1:07:14] THAT SAME GOD WITH THE SAME ANOINTING
[1:07:17] UNDER [screaming] THE SAME MINISTRY OF
[1:07:18] THE SAME WORD WILL TAKE A BRIDE OUT OF
[1:07:22] THEIR EGYPT AND PLACE HIM INTO THE
[1:07:24] PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; HE WILL DO IT. HE HAS TO DO IT IN ORDER
[1:07:29] TO BE GOD.
[1:07:32] DEUTERONOMY 2:13 SAYS, "NOW RISE UP,
[1:07:34] SAID I, AND GET YOU OVER THE BROOK OF
[1:07:36] ZARED, AND WE WENT OVER TO THE BROOK
[1:07:38] ZARED, AND THE SPACE IN WHICH WE CAME
[1:07:40] FROM KADESH BARNEA until we come over
[1:07:43] the brook there was 38 years."
[1:07:47] So 38 years.
[1:07:54] I'm 50. Don't look at me like that,
[1:07:56] David. I'm getting old. I can't even see
[1:07:57] it. But 38 years they wandered
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; and complained
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; and wondered and complained.
[1:08:09] Well, it's too cold. It's too hot. It's
[1:08:11] too this. It's too that. And they
[1:08:14] wondered.
[1:08:15] Did you see so and so? They wasn't here.
[1:08:19] Did you see their kids little snotty
[1:08:21] nose things?
[1:08:24] That's how we act sometimes.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; If that was my AND I'D HAVE SNATCHED HIM
[1:08:29] UP. THANK GOD IT ain't your kid. You can
[1:08:33] just sit there and run a mouth with it.
[1:08:35] BUT WE FIND THEY COME TO KADESH BARNEA
[1:08:38] 38 years on the testimony of a prophet.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. This is how
[1:08:45] important it is for the new birth.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Three days journey from the promised
[1:08:52] land.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Just how close are we?
[1:08:58] THREE DAYS JOURNEY, THE BELIEVER CAN
[1:09:00] LOOK OVER into the land, but they
[1:09:03] couldn't enjoy it. Brother Stewart,
[1:09:05] they've heard the testimonies of how it
[1:09:07] took two men to carry back those grapes.
[1:09:10] They heard the testimonies, oh, how it
[1:09:12] was a wonderful land. It flowed with
[1:09:14] milk and honey, but they could they
[1:09:16] couldn't set down any claims because
[1:09:19] they failed to enter into the land. 38
[1:09:22] years they sat on the outskirts of the
[1:09:25] promised land, their place of safety,
[1:09:28] and they wandered in the wilderness.
[1:09:31] 38 years.
[1:09:34] Moses covered 38 years of Israel's
[1:09:37] wandering in the wilderness.
[1:09:40] And this what did it do? Took up time
[1:09:42] waiting on a generation of unbelief to
[1:09:45] die out so a generation of faith can
[1:09:47] enter into the promised land. They kept
[1:09:50] preaching the same doctrines of
[1:09:51] repentance. God sent a prophet. All you
[1:09:54] got to do is believe the message.
[1:09:56] But they never dug into Moses's message.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; If they would have dug into Moses's
[1:10:02] message, they would have known that God
[1:10:04] had a purpose to take them to a certain
[1:10:06] place
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; and they stopped short.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; What am I telling you, church? Don't
[1:10:11] stop short.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; I know this life can be unbearable. I
[1:10:16] know it can be difficult, but don't
[1:10:18] short in the journey
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; and it is a journey
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; and it can be intense at times but he's
[1:10:25] leading us to the promised land. 38
[1:10:28] years they lacked the desire to possess
[1:10:32] what God had given him because the old
[1:10:35] fighters said God don't do that no more.
[1:10:38] We had the reveal word today. We don't
[1:10:40] need the signs and the wonders. We don't
[1:10:43] need to speaking in tongues. We don't
[1:10:45] need to shout. We don't need to shout
[1:10:47] the king in the camp. That was something
[1:10:49] of yesterday.
[1:10:52] Why?
[1:10:54] But these old generation of fighters had
[1:10:58] to die off.
[1:11:01] Can I tell you the promise still
[1:11:03] remained?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; The promise still remains.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He gave them a promised land. They can
[1:11:15] look sister James and see it.
[1:11:20] No doubt Caleb every morning got up.
[1:11:23] There's a mountain over there. It's got
[1:11:26] my name on it. There's a mountain over
[1:11:29] there. I've already been there. I know
[1:11:32] exactly where I'm going to build my
[1:11:34] house.
[1:11:36] There's giants on that mountain. Caleb
[1:11:38] didn't care about what was on the
[1:11:39] mountain. He just knew God gave him the
[1:11:41] promise.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And that promise wasn't in the
[1:11:44] wilderness. That promise was in the
[1:11:45] promised land of the word.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; And God has given you each and everyone
[1:11:49] precious promises. Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Moms and dads, he has given you your
[1:11:53] children that they and their offspring
[1:11:55] shall be there WITH THEM.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVEN YOU THE PRECIOUS promise of
[1:12:00] the word.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; It may be a giant on your mountain, but
[1:12:06] your mountain needs to hear your voice.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; See, the promised land is just as in
[1:12:12] sight today as it was then.
[1:12:16] See, God called them out of Egypt
[1:12:19] and God has called us out of Egypt and
[1:12:22] he sent us a prophet. And when brother
[1:12:24] Brandham was here,
[1:12:27] I believe today that the same promise
[1:12:29] that he preached that that same promise
[1:12:32] still is still in effect today because
[1:12:35] we've not changed bodies.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; We've not changed unless you're changed.
[1:12:41] If this is the millennium, I'm sorely
[1:12:43] disappointed.
[1:12:46] SEE, THERE'S A PROMISE OF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:12:48] TODAY for every believer who will
[1:12:51] complete all three stages of the
[1:12:53] journey.
[1:12:54] You hear me, young person?
[1:12:57] So, what am I telling you? Don't be
[1:12:59] content with just a justified life.
[1:13:03] Don't remain satisfied with crossing
[1:13:05] your red seas and bitter waters to live
[1:13:07] a sanctified life and just wander around
[1:13:11] thinking, "Well, I'm moral. I got long
[1:13:13] hair and I don't wear those kind of
[1:13:14] clothes. But yet in your heart, you
[1:13:16] know, you've not completed the journey.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And that doesn't only go for the young
[1:13:21] person. It go for us as old people as
[1:13:23] well. Make sure that you complete THE
[1:13:26] JOURNEY BECAUSE ALL the promises of God
[1:13:29] lay in that third pool.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; They lay in the promised land, the third
[1:13:34] stage of the journey.
[1:13:39] May we not make church the same fatal
[1:13:43] error that they
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; come out under the testimony because
[1:13:50] only a handful of you maybe a handful
[1:13:52] ever seen the prophet. How many of you
[1:13:55] seen the prophet? Come on raise your
[1:13:57] hand high.
[1:13:59] Some two or three out of 50 60 we got
[1:14:03] here. So the rest of us have come out
[1:14:07] under the testimony
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; and what we heard on tape.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, we heard this one saying that one
[1:14:13] saying how he revealed this to me and he
[1:14:15] did this to me and he did this and he
[1:14:17] spoke this.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; See, we've come out on that same
[1:14:20] testimony.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; But we're not going to be of the type
[1:14:23] that only stay twothirds of the way.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; No, WE WE'VE COME AND BROTHER SAID EVERY
[1:14:28] CHURCH SERVICE IS A CADISH BARIA. YOU
[1:14:31] HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. ARE WE GOING TO
[1:14:34] STAY HERE AND WONDER AND WONDER AND
[1:14:35] WONDER AND LET THIS OLD LIES AND GOD
[1:14:38] DOESN'T DO THIS ANYMORE? WE DON'T NEED A
[1:14:40] SUPERNATURAL ANYMORE. KEEP US FROM OUR
[1:14:42] LAND OF PROMISE. NO. BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE
[1:14:44] A DECISION. I'M LEAVING HERE. I'M
[1:14:46] LEAVING HERE IN THIS SERVICE. I'M
[1:14:48] LEAVING HERE IN THIS DAY. I'M NOT GOING
[1:14:50] TO GO AROUND THE MOUNTAIN OF UNBELIEF
[1:14:52] ANYMORE. I'M NOT GOING TO WANDER AROUND
[1:14:53] THE WILDERNESS OF WONDER AND WORRY AND
[1:14:56] GR REGRET AND DIFFICULTY AND MALICE AND
[1:14:58] STRIFE. I'M GOING INTO [screaming] THE
[1:15:00] PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST OF MY H
[1:15:03] MY HIDDEN LIFE IN CHRIST. I'M GOING TO
[1:15:05] MY HIDING PLACE. [applause and cheering]
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE GOD HAS INTENDED TO TAKE A
[1:15:10] PEOPLE.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; NOT TO SOME DENOMINATION. NOT TO THE
[1:15:13] FOUR WALLS OF THIS CHURCH. NOT TO JUST
[1:15:15] SAY, "I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER." IT'S MORE
[1:15:18] THAN [screaming] JUST BELIEVING THE
[1:15:19] MESSAGE.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; He's trying to take you somewhere
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; to a hiding place.
[1:15:29] And when they got to Canaan,
[1:15:31] oh, brother Brown would tell us, you
[1:15:33] know, there were still battles in
[1:15:34] Canaan, but that's where all the
[1:15:36] promises lie.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love this word.
[1:15:42] So, we got to make sure that we enter
[1:15:44] into that land, enter into the Holy
[1:15:47] Ghost. And he said, God's promised the
[1:15:49] Holy Ghost to every believer, and he
[1:15:52] wants to give it to you more than you
[1:15:53] want to receive it.
[1:15:56] Not just a baptism
[1:15:58] on your flesh
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; where you get a goosebump or you shout
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; or maybe during your special meetings
[1:16:07] and you [snorts] get all caught up in
[1:16:09] the forio of of the service and maybe
[1:16:11] you you begin to run under the
[1:16:14] excitement. It's more than just the
[1:16:16] emotional aspect of it.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; I'm all about emotion, but we don't get
[1:16:21] worked up and EMOTIONAL TO GET THE HOLY
[1:16:23] GHOST. WE GET THE HOLY GHOST FIRST AND
[1:16:25] THEN IT WORKS US UP UNTO EMOTION.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, NOT JUST IT ON YOUR FLESH, BUT WE
[1:16:34] WANT the literal life of Christ,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; the token life on display. See, that's
[1:16:40] the rest.
[1:16:42] That's the place of safety.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; That's our hiding place.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Kadis Barne, we told it means make a
[1:16:51] decision. You got to make a decision.
[1:16:53] And I and you may tell me today, "Well,
[1:16:54] Brother Joe, I believe God sent a
[1:16:56] prophet." I say, "Great, Brother Joe,
[1:16:59] I've been a believer of this message for
[1:17:00] 50 years." Great. We'll give you a
[1:17:03] plaque when the service is over,
[1:17:06] Brother Joe. I live a clean and moral
[1:17:09] life. I'm happy. But do you have the
[1:17:12] Holy Ghost?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Do you have the token life?
[1:17:21] Because that's where it meets the rubber
[1:17:23] meets the road.
[1:17:26] Not how much you know or how much you
[1:17:28] confess you know, how much you say that
[1:17:29] you know. Do you know him? And more
[1:17:34] importantly, does him know you?
[1:17:42] See, have you received the life or we
[1:17:46] just circling?
[1:17:48] Circling. I see the land, all the
[1:17:50] blessings in the land. Oh my, I heard
[1:17:52] about the miracles in the land. I don't
[1:17:55] want to be an observer
[1:17:57] of the land.
[1:17:59] God didn't call us to be observers just
[1:18:02] to sit back from three days journey and
[1:18:04] look what's going on at so and so
[1:18:06] church. Wish we could have that here.
[1:18:09] Oh, I looked over, man. Wish we could
[1:18:12] have that type of service here. Wow,
[1:18:15] they got that brother. I wish we could
[1:18:17] get that brother here. No,
[1:18:21] we're not observers.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The promised land belongs to us.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to go alone. Well,
[1:18:30] you better be dead set on going at it
[1:18:32] alone. Sometimes
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; this Christian journey ain't about you
[1:18:35] and your buddy,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Danny. It's not about us and our
[1:18:40] wives. It's about us and our
[1:18:42] relationship with God.
[1:18:45] And if you don't go, but you're not
[1:18:46] going to hinder me.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; My wife decides she's had enough of it.
[1:18:50] Praise God. I don't believe that's going
[1:18:52] to happen. But I'm going on anyway
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; because it's about me and God.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Sister Danny,
[1:18:59] you've been at it a long time by
[1:19:00] yourself.
[1:19:02] Brother passed over many years ago, but
[1:19:04] you're still faithful. If it was about
[1:19:07] you and him, you'd have stopped a long
[1:19:08] time ago. It was about you and him.
[1:19:12] So we find today the land still belongs
[1:19:16] to us. What needs to happen is we need
[1:19:19] to turn northward.
[1:19:22] It's time some of you make a decision.
[1:19:25] I'm not just going to come to Word of
[1:19:26] Life tabernacle just to come to Word of
[1:19:29] Life Tabernacle.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not just going to fulfill my
[1:19:34] religious Christian responsibilities and
[1:19:36] duties, but I'm coming because I want to
[1:19:39] possess something. We are possessors of
[1:19:43] the promise.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Moms and dads, you can pray for your
[1:19:48] children because you're a possessor of
[1:19:51] the promise. You can believe when nobody
[1:19:54] else can believe with you for
[1:19:55] [clears throat] their salvation and for
[1:19:57] their Holy Ghost. I look over here and I
[1:19:59] see brother Joe and sister Joanne
[1:20:01] praying for one of their children. And
[1:20:03] now I see the manifestation of a
[1:20:05] faithful prayer coming to manifestation.
[1:20:07] Why? because they refuse to let go of a
[1:20:10] promise.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And what God's done here, God can do all
[1:20:13] throughout the churches.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; We have a hiding place, church.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; A place of refuge. And God has called us
[1:20:22] not just to come out, but to go in and
[1:20:25] possess the land, possess the new birth,
[1:20:27] possess the baptism of Holy Ghost, to
[1:20:29] possess that token LIFE. AND THERE'S
[1:20:31] HEALING in that land. There's
[1:20:32] deliverance in that land. There's peace
[1:20:35] IN THAT LAND. AND THERE'S REVELATION in
[1:20:37] that land.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus tell us? He said, "If
[1:20:44] I go to prepare a place for you, I'm
[1:20:46] going to come again and I'm going to
[1:20:48] receive you unto myself that where I am,
[1:20:51] you may be also." So, he's gone to
[1:20:54] prepare the place.
[1:20:56] Church, he's coming back. Are you going
[1:20:58] to be ready?
[1:21:01] I like how brother Ram says this in the
[1:21:03] token message.
[1:21:05] He says we are not we're not to come and
[1:21:09] talk about the message.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna let that sink for a minute
[1:21:18] because we do a good job of talking.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; God's in a prophet. God's in a prophet.
[1:21:23] God's in a prophet. We can make a song
[1:21:25] about God's in a prophet.
[1:21:28] And I'm not making light of that. But he
[1:21:30] says in THE TOKEN MESSAGE AFTER the
[1:21:32] revealing of the seals,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; he says, "WE HAVE NOT COME TOGETHER TO
[1:21:37] TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. WE HAVE COME
[1:21:38] TOGETHER to get in the message."
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; AND THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST. HE IS THE
[1:21:44] WORD. WE'RE TO GET INTO IT. GET BENEATH
[1:21:46] IT. YES, SIR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
[1:21:49] TO DO. NOWHERE DID HE SAY YOU GOT TO
[1:21:51] LISTEN TO ME. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE WHAT
[1:21:52] I'M PREACHING. BUT HE SAYS YOU GOT TO
[1:21:54] GET INTO CHRIST. YOU GOT TO [screaming]
[1:21:56] GET INTO THE TOKEN LIFE. YOU GOT TO GET
[1:21:59] INTO THE MESSAGE. AND CHRIST IS THE
[1:22:02] MESSAGE.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; He says we're to get in beneath it. Yes,
[1:22:08] SIR. HE SAYS ALL HE GOES HE GOES ALL HAD
[1:22:11] TO TAKE NOT ONLY HIMSELF BUT his whole
[1:22:13] family, the whole He SAID THEY'RE ONLY
[1:22:15] SAFE. Now listen, they're only safe when
[1:22:18] the token was displayed. Now we're
[1:22:20] talking about a hiding place, a place of
[1:22:22] refuge, a place of safety. And they were
[1:22:24] only safe when the token was displayed.
[1:22:29] Young person, hear this next phrase of
[1:22:31] this quote. And we cannot feel safe
[1:22:35] until this token is displayed.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; But I thought you said all we got to do
[1:22:42] is believe God sent a prophet. I never
[1:22:44] said that.
[1:22:46] They made it that, but that's not what I
[1:22:48] said.
[1:22:49] See, we cannot feel safe until this
[1:22:53] token is displayed. That's right. YOU
[1:22:55] MUST COME UNDER THIS TOKEN, GOD'S HOLY
[1:22:58] SPIRIT, AND IT displays
[1:23:00] to you, Jesus Christ, because it comes
[1:23:03] and lives in you.
[1:23:05] There's your hiding place.
[1:23:09] That's what he wanted from the very
[1:23:12] beginning. All that God was, he emptied
[1:23:15] himself. He keynoted himself in the
[1:23:18] Christ. And all that Christ was when you
[1:23:22] go and you listen to Christ, the mystery
[1:23:23] of God, all that Christ was, he poured
[1:23:26] or emptied himself into the body, the
[1:23:29] bride. So it's always been about you,
[1:23:32] little bride.
[1:23:34] But see, we made that the theme or the
[1:23:36] anthem of the message.
[1:23:40] We made that and we shipwrecked people
[1:23:43] because we pointed him to
[1:23:44] Jeffersonville.
[1:23:47] We pointed them to a tape player. We
[1:23:51] pointed them to slanted ideas. We
[1:23:54] pointed him to false teachings
[1:23:57] that circulate around a voice.
[1:24:00] Instead of pointing him
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; to Christ,
[1:24:06] we pointed him. Well, you as long as you
[1:24:08] believe this, you're secure. As long as
[1:24:09] you had an eagle belt buckle. I remember
[1:24:12] that was a thing when I first came to
[1:24:13] the message. I'm not a cowboy, so I
[1:24:15] never wore one.
[1:24:17] Belt buckles. And you got to have the
[1:24:19] pictures all over your house. My wife
[1:24:21] don't decorate that way.
[1:24:24] Hey, if you do, that's great. But we
[1:24:27] decianize people because we don't have
[1:24:29] all the messes paraphernalia,
[1:24:32] all the relics hanging around our who
[1:24:34] are we here worshiping.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand how I'm
[1:24:38] presenting this. I'm not presenting this
[1:24:39] to be disrespectful of our message
[1:24:42] because I'm not I don't have anything to
[1:24:44] preach but this.
[1:24:46] But I want to rightly place it. It's
[1:24:50] always been about him.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. The message is
[1:24:54] not William Brandom.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. Get in the
[1:24:58] Christ. Get in the Christ. Get in the
[1:25:01] Christ. Get in the Christ. What did he
[1:25:03] say this morning? I'm not him. I'm just
[1:25:04] his servant. But there'll be a spirit in
[1:25:07] the land to seduce people to believe
[1:25:11] and they'll baptize in his name and do
[1:25:12] all this other stuff in his name. But he
[1:25:14] says, "Now in the time of trouble, he's
[1:25:18] going to hide me, shelter me, protect
[1:25:22] me." Why? because he's going to fill you
[1:25:23] with the Holy Ghost. And what greater
[1:25:26] time of trouble are we living in than
[1:25:27] right now?
[1:25:30] I personally don't see how we can go
[1:25:32] much further.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; But he promised
[1:25:36] he promised. Brother B says he promised
[1:25:38] to be God in the time of trouble as a
[1:25:41] present help. He promised to do the
[1:25:43] things that he seen him through. And he
[1:25:45] says, "And now he was," he said, "the
[1:25:48] same spirit of God that led Israel leads
[1:25:50] the church today, bringing us through as
[1:25:53] it was the wilderness into the promised
[1:25:54] land." HE GOES, "WE HAVE WE HAVE A
[1:25:56] PROMISED LAND. YOU BELIEVE THAT IN MY
[1:25:58] father's house are many mansions, and I
[1:26:00] go to prepare a place for you. And I'll
[1:26:02] come again to receive you unto myself
[1:26:04] that see where I am, you may be also."
[1:26:06] He goes, "We're going to a glorious
[1:26:08] promised land that God has promised us."
[1:26:13] And what does God want to do? He wants
[1:26:14] to reveal the word to the people. He
[1:26:17] wants to reveal himself to the people.
[1:26:20] And in Isaiah 32, it says, "Behold, a
[1:26:22] king shall reign in righteousness, and
[1:26:25] princes shall rule in judgment, and a
[1:26:27] man shall be as a hiding place from the
[1:26:30] wind, and a covert from the tempest as
[1:26:32] rivers of water in a dry place, and the
[1:26:34] shadows of a great rock in a WEARY
[1:26:36] LAND." SO ISAIAH HERE IS PROPHESYING OF
[1:26:39] THE ONCOMING MESSIAH THAT NOT ONLY IS HE
[1:26:42] GOING TO BE KING, BUT HE'S GOING TO BE
[1:26:44] JESUS CHRIST MADE MANIFEST AND HE IS
[1:26:47] GOING TO BE IN THE HIDING PLACE FROM THE
[1:26:49] WINDS AND A COVERT FROM THE STORMS AND
[1:26:51] THE TEMPEST OF LIFE. HE IS GOING TO
[1:26:53] SHELTER YOU AND PROTECT YOU. BUT YOU GOT
[1:26:55] TO MAKE SURE IT'S MORE THAN JUST AN
[1:26:57] IDEOLOGY. YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
[1:26:59] LIFE IS SO HIDDEN WITH GOD THAT ALL THAT
[1:27:02] OLD NATURE, THE THINGS THAT YOU USED TO
[1:27:04] DO AND THE things that YOU USED TO LOVE,
[1:27:06] YOU DON'T LOVE THEM ANYMORE. NOW YOU
[1:27:08] LOVE HIM AND HIM ALONE.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; HE'S TAKEN ALL THAT OUT, ALL THAT
[1:27:14] SINFULNESS, ALL THOSE WORLDLY DESIRES,
[1:27:16] AND HE SHELTERED YOU IN HIMSELF.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; We have a rest
[1:27:23] when we've been troubled by men.
[1:27:26] We had peace
[1:27:29] last night. Many of you, you seen this,
[1:27:32] the winds blowing last night, man. The
[1:27:34] winds were whipping. Leaves were just
[1:27:36] whipping around.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; But you didn't feel none of that because
[1:27:40] you was inside.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you saw the effects.
[1:27:46] When the storms come in the darkest of
[1:27:48] nights and the lightning's popping and
[1:27:50] the thunders are rolling, you don't feel
[1:27:53] the thunder. Maybe you feel a little
[1:27:54] bit, you know, a little concussion from
[1:27:58] it.
[1:27:59] You see the lightning, but it's all on
[1:28:01] the outside. You're safe. You have a
[1:28:04] hiding place, a refuge. And I was
[1:28:07] thinking this morning when somebody, you
[1:28:09] know, in the dark, maybe 10 o'clock at
[1:28:11] night, you're at the house with your
[1:28:13] people, your family, not your people,
[1:28:16] and somebody comes
[1:28:18] knocking on the door, beating on the
[1:28:20] door. It startles you, right?
[1:28:24] But guess what? You may be scared for a
[1:28:26] minute, but they can't come in
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; because the door's locked.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm telling you. He's a
[1:28:34] hiding place. A man shall be a hiding
[1:28:36] place. So when the enemy and the
[1:28:39] persecutors and the pursuers come
[1:28:41] pounding on your door, reminding you of
[1:28:43] your past,
[1:28:46] they can't get in
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; because we have a hiding place. We're
[1:28:50] hidden
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; in Christ. Let me go on. Brother talks
[1:28:53] about a bomb shelter. And I'm going to
[1:28:55] start wrapping this up because I got 13
[1:28:57] minutes and 23 seconds. I got to speak
[1:28:59] fast.
[1:29:01] I figured y'all would have clapped and
[1:29:02] said amen on that one. Here we go. But
[1:29:06] the BIBLE SAYS IN PROVERBS 18:10, THE
[1:29:08] NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER THAT
[1:29:10] THE RIGHTEOUS runest into and are safe.
[1:29:14] And that word name means reputation,
[1:29:17] fame and glory. So the name of the Lord,
[1:29:19] the reputation of the Lord is a strong
[1:29:22] tower.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S WITHTOOD A LOT OF ATTACKS.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S SEEN MEN THROUGH SOME VERY TRYING
[1:29:29] TIMES. IT BEEN THERE WITH THE HEBREW
[1:29:31] BOYS. IT'S BEEN THERE WITH DANIEL AND
[1:29:33] THE LIONS. IT BEEN THERE WITH ABRAHAM ON
[1:29:35] THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. THE NAME OF
[1:29:37] THE LORD,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, THE NAME OF THE LORD'S
[1:29:39] MADE IT THROUGH SIX CHURCH AGES. IN THE
[1:29:42] NAME OF THE LORD IS GOING TO PERMEATE IN
[1:29:44] THIS LAST FINAL LEISIAN CHURCH AGE
[1:29:46] BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO TAKE A PRIDE JUST
[1:29:48] LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD FROM THE BEGINNING
[1:29:50] BUT THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG
[1:29:53] TOWER LET ME TELL YOU I'M NOT RUNNING TO
[1:29:54] THE BAPTIST CHURCH I'M NOT RUNNING TO
[1:29:56] THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH I HAVE RUN
[1:29:58] [screaming] TO THE HIDING PLACE OF THE
[1:30:00] ANOINTED WORD OF GOD FOR THIS HOUR AND
[1:30:02] THAT'S MY SECRET PLACE THAT'S MY PLACE
[1:30:05] OF PROTECTION [applause]
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; SIR
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; TO NAME THE REPUTATION
[1:30:11] OF THE LORD. I'VE SEEN WHAT HE DONE.
[1:30:14] I'VE SEEN CANCER DELIVERED.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I see couples that couldn't get
[1:30:19] pregnant, barren, prayed for them, and
[1:30:24] God give them a child.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Had a couple there in Kentucky last year
[1:30:30] came up for prayer. I told the the wife,
[1:30:33] I said, "Give him a name.
[1:30:36] Speak a name over him right now."
[1:30:39] just got a testimony the other day.
[1:30:40] They're pregnant with their first child.
[1:30:43] CAN I TELL YOU, HE'S STILL GOD TODAY?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU ARE, WHEREVER YOU FIND
[1:30:49] YOURSELF, HE'S STILL AS MUCH GOD TODAY
[1:30:51] IN LEIA, IN HARDY, ARKANSAS, OR WHEREVER
[1:30:55] YOU FIND YOUR PLACE, HE'S NOT DEPLETED
[1:30:57] OF [screaming] ONE OUNCE OF POWER.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; HE IS STILL GOD AND HE'S STILL
[1:31:01] SUFFICIENT FOR YOU IN YOUR NEEDS TODAY.
[1:31:04] AMEN.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord
[1:31:09] is a mighty tower. Righteous run to and
[1:31:11] safe. SO NO MATTER HOW MANY bombs or how
[1:31:14] many anything, we're safe there. And you
[1:31:18] got people today, you know, we got these
[1:31:21] preppers,
[1:31:23] man. They got food stored up to last a
[1:31:26] thousand years.
[1:31:27] Good Lord, I don't want to taste that
[1:31:29] food in a thousand years.
[1:31:32] Hey, it may be canned perfect, but it
[1:31:33] ain't going to last that long. BUT THEY
[1:31:36] DONE DUG THEM A CELLAR. They done got it
[1:31:39] so many feet deep.
[1:31:42] I don't know who did the test to see if
[1:31:44] it's going to withstand a nuclear
[1:31:46] explosion.
[1:31:47] Somehow they got it all figured out.
[1:31:50] They building bomb shelters. They're
[1:31:52] preparing to stay. I don't want to stay.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Look, look around.
[1:31:58] I
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; mean, hardy ain't that bad. But look
[1:32:00] around.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE. OUR
[1:32:03] POLITICAL SYSTEMS ARE FALLING APART.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; MEN AND WOMEN DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE
[1:32:08] A MAN OR A WOMAN, CAT OR A DOG.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I MEAN, YOU GOT KIDS IN SCHOOL PEEING IN
[1:32:13] A LITTER BOX,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; because they're taking on the NAME OF A
[1:32:18] CAT or the identity. Well, meow me
[1:32:21] crazy, BUT I'M NOT GOING DOWN THAT ROAD.
[1:32:26] Come on.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; AND WE WANT TO STAY HERE.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; NO, I want to leave.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And brother B talked about this bomb
[1:32:34] shelter.
[1:32:36] He says, "No, if I had a bomb shelter
[1:32:39] under all the places and everything,
[1:32:40] we're still not secure. THE ONLY ONE
[1:32:43] SAFE PLACE that's in Christ, the son of
[1:32:46] THE LIVING GOD. HE IS THE BOMB SHELTER.
[1:32:48] Under his wings,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; we will abide."
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "THE REAL BOMB SHELTER."
[1:32:54] NOW FLEE TONIGHT FROM THE THE WRATH THAT
[1:32:57] IS TO COME. HE SAYS, "BUT NOTICE THERE
[1:32:59] IS A SAFE PLACE THAT'S IN JESUS CHRIST.
[1:33:01] UPON THIS ROCK I'LL BUILD MY CHURCH AND
[1:33:03] THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL
[1:33:05] AGAINST IT." THAT'S THE BELIEVER'S
[1:33:07] PROTECTION JUST UNDER the wings safely
[1:33:10] abide. A hiding place. Ah, it doesn't
[1:33:14] look safe. Wings,
[1:33:16] feathers
[1:33:18] safe. Try it one time.
[1:33:22] Try it one time.
[1:33:25] I've seen God move, church,
[1:33:28] time and time and time and time and time
[1:33:31] and time again.
[1:33:34] Not with steel, not with ammunition, not
[1:33:37] with political powers, not with great
[1:33:38] powers. Because he said, "Not by might,
[1:33:41] not by strength, but by my power." It's
[1:33:46] all about God. God moves how he desires
[1:33:48] to move. Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Seen God heal, seeing God deliver,
[1:33:52] seeing God set free, seeing God filled
[1:33:54] with the Holy Ghost. Seeing God move in
[1:33:57] situations, but I never figured out how
[1:34:00] he was going to move through it. Four or
[1:34:03] five years ago, I took a leap of faith
[1:34:04] and left a great job.
[1:34:08] I thought it was great. Took a leap of
[1:34:11] faith to go full-time into the ministry.
[1:34:13] My kids, all with the exception of
[1:34:15] Caroline, Rebecca Manley, she thought we
[1:34:18] was going to go poor as church Bryce.
[1:34:21] Ain't no way we're going to make it.
[1:34:22] Ain't no way we're going to make it. She
[1:34:24] was scared to death. We're going to be
[1:34:27] poppers. We're going to be P. We ain't
[1:34:30] going to have nothing. Cara, I mean,
[1:34:32] she's like, LAUREN HAD THE BEST LIFE.
[1:34:34] SHE GOT TO GET ALL THIS STUFF. I'M NEVER
[1:34:35] GOING TO GET A CAR. I'M NEVER GOING TO
[1:34:37] GET THIS. I'M NEVER GOING TO GET THAT.
[1:34:38] I'M LIKE, GIRL, you underestimate God.
[1:34:43] You underestimate God.
[1:34:47] We took a leap of faith. And I could go
[1:34:50] on and on and on. Just a couple years
[1:34:51] ago, God blessed me with that black
[1:34:54] truck out there. Somebody bought it for
[1:34:56] me. Yeah, you heard me right.
[1:35:00] Did y'all look at it? It's a platinum.
[1:35:04] Yeah. Nice red seats. Fine truck,
[1:35:08] man. Oh, poor preacher.
[1:35:12] It ain't a poor preacher. It's a big
[1:35:14] God.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I TELLING YOU? DON'T SHORT
[1:35:18] CHANGE GOD JUST FROM WHAT YOU SEE.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; God can do what he chooses, HOW HE
[1:35:23] WISHES TO.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT BUILDING BOMB SHELTERS, but
[1:35:27] we're under a shelter of his wings, of
[1:35:29] his protection.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Andrew Spencer at a youth
[1:35:33] camp many years ago, he spoke a word.
[1:35:36] And I, you know, and it it's not just
[1:35:40] in the aspect of this word being just
[1:35:42] for me and I make him anything special,
[1:35:45] but I believe God uses gifts and uses
[1:35:47] men. But at the end of a youth service,
[1:35:49] he looked at the back and he said,
[1:35:50] "Brother Joe," he says, "Satan [snorts]
[1:35:53] can't stop you."
[1:35:57] He goes, "Don't worry about your future.
[1:36:02] Your future is clear." What he didn't
[1:36:05] know was Monday morning. And I was going
[1:36:06] in with a resignation letter.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; So God was telling me, "Don't worry
[1:36:12] about your future.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I got you."
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And can I tell you, Word of Life
[1:36:16] tabernacle, don't you worry about your
[1:36:18] future.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; He's got you.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; He's got your children. He's got your
[1:36:25] families. He's got your husbands, your
[1:36:26] wife, your jobs, your careers, your
[1:36:28] grandchildren. He's got you.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Sister Carla, he's got you. He's got
[1:36:35] your children. Don't worry. God's got
[1:36:37] them.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; We got nothing to worry about. We're
[1:36:42] safe.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; We're in a safe place.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God. And they're
[1:36:48] building bomb shelters. He said you they
[1:36:51] can build it 150 ft deep, but it'll blow
[1:36:55] thousands of miles wide. He said you can
[1:36:57] get it all the way to the lava. It'll
[1:36:58] crush every bone in your body. I'm not
[1:37:03] preparing to stay. I'm preparing to
[1:37:05] leave.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And so what do we got to do, brother
[1:37:08] Stewart? We got to get everybody in.
[1:37:11] Everybody in.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Get them under the token.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Because see, he's not responsible for
[1:37:17] those that are outside the token.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Got to get into that city of refuge so
[1:37:22] the pursuers can't get to him.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Let me bring this on to a close.
[1:37:27] Musicians, if you would make your way
[1:37:28] back, please.
[1:37:38] the token life, the believer's refuge,
[1:37:42] the believer's hiding place.
[1:37:49] Brother taught us
[1:37:52] that God's mouthpiece is a prophet. He's
[1:37:55] God's channel.
[1:37:58] He's God's eye. When we go back and we
[1:38:00] look here,
[1:38:02] And Psalms 32 and verse 7, thou art my
[1:38:05] hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me
[1:38:08] from trouble. Thou shalt compass me
[1:38:10] about with songs of deliverance. But in
[1:38:13] verse 38, he says, I will instruct thee
[1:38:15] and teach thee in thy way, and thou are
[1:38:18] in the way that thou shalt go, and I
[1:38:20] will guide thee with my eye. And your
[1:38:23] prophet taught us that a seer, a
[1:38:25] prophet, is God's eye. And God has been
[1:38:28] leading us with his eye.
[1:38:32] Some of you, he's led from other lands.
[1:38:37] You drive two, three hours maybe to be
[1:38:39] here. God's leading. God's guiding.
[1:38:41] God's put you together. God's placed you
[1:38:43] here. It's God. It's been God the whole
[1:38:45] time.
[1:38:47] But his eyes been watching over his
[1:38:49] elect. He put this one with that one
[1:38:52] because he saw a seed 100 years later
[1:38:55] that's going to come up in this hour.
[1:38:56] And God's watched it. It's been God's
[1:38:58] eagle eye the whole time. See, we have a
[1:39:01] hiding place. If we didn't belong to
[1:39:03] God, he wouldn't watch over us. But he
[1:39:05] has a responsibility.
[1:39:07] He had he's obligated to his word.
[1:39:11] And I'm his word.
[1:39:14] Brother Brandham expressed that a
[1:39:15] prophet functions as God's eye on earth
[1:39:17] to reveal his will
[1:39:20] and to guide his people. We go on just a
[1:39:23] little bit further.
[1:39:26] And he would tell us that Christ, the
[1:39:28] word is our refuge.
[1:39:32] It's our only safe place for the
[1:39:34] believer in the last days is to be in
[1:39:36] Christ.
[1:39:39] Which the revealed word for this hour is
[1:39:42] Christ. And he would tell us that the
[1:39:44] token is our protection. It's it
[1:39:47] connected, brother B would connect the
[1:39:48] hiding place with the token, the Holy
[1:39:50] Spirit. And just as Israel had the blood
[1:39:53] on the DOORSTEPS OF EGYPT, BELIEVERS
[1:39:55] TODAY must have the same spirit applied
[1:39:57] to their lives. That's the protection
[1:39:59] against judgment. Then it would tell us
[1:40:02] that the name of the Lord, notice, is a
[1:40:04] strong tower. And brother taught that
[1:40:06] Christ's name understood spiritually
[1:40:08] through REVELATION WAS A STRONG TOWER
[1:40:10] WHERE THE BRIDE HIDES.
[1:40:13] She's not hidden in the denominational
[1:40:15] name, but she's hidden in his name.
[1:40:19] And he warned us in the chaos of
[1:40:22] denominations and politics and end time
[1:40:24] judgments, only those that take refuge
[1:40:28] in the revealed word, the message have a
[1:40:30] true hiding place.
[1:40:33] Aren't you thankful today, church, that
[1:40:36] we have a refuge? And I'm going to say
[1:40:40] something here, and please understand it
[1:40:42] in the way that I mean to say it, but
[1:40:44] the message movement is not our hiding
[1:40:47] place.
[1:40:49] The message movement
[1:40:52] is not our hiding place. The name
[1:40:57] William Brandom has never saved one
[1:41:00] person.
[1:41:02] The name William Brandom is not our
[1:41:05] hiding place. But the message
[1:41:08] and the message is Christ and he is the
[1:41:11] word and he is our hiding place.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And God sent a prophet
[1:41:18] God sent a prophet. God's eye leading
[1:41:21] you,
[1:41:23] guiding you, speaking expressly to you
[1:41:28] and to your needs.
[1:41:31] God's eagle eye. And we're in a time of
[1:41:34] trouble. The death angel is going
[1:41:36] through the land
[1:41:38] and he's looking.
[1:41:40] Well, B tells the story about that
[1:41:42] little Hebrew boy.
[1:41:46] Dad, are we going to be okay? ARE YOU
[1:41:47] SURE WE'RE OKAY? HE SAYS, "YES, SON.
[1:41:50] We're okay. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I NEED THE
[1:41:52] ASSURANCE."
[1:41:54] He said, "Come here, son." He said,
[1:41:57] "Come here." He said, "You see this?"
[1:42:00] Moses the prophet told us to apply the
[1:42:03] blood.
[1:42:05] Told us not just come and talk about it,
[1:42:08] but get in it. And we applied this token
[1:42:11] to the door. And when the death angel
[1:42:14] comes, he's going to pass over. Why? How
[1:42:17] can that happen? Because he sees the
[1:42:19] sacrifice.
[1:42:21] He sees that blood was applied.
[1:42:24] And in this hour, in the time of
[1:42:26] trouble,
[1:42:28] that that angel is going to pass over.
[1:42:32] If the token has been applied, if the
[1:42:35] life has been applied, if you're truly
[1:42:38] in your hiding place,
[1:42:42] God bless you. Let's just stand and
[1:42:43] worship the Lord. You are my refuge.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; When I feel afraid,
[1:42:57] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:43:02] refuge.
[1:43:04] And when the storm
[1:43:07] is raging
[1:43:10] underneath his waves,
[1:43:13] I will rejoice and sing. You are singing
[1:43:17] it to him again. Now be thankful for
[1:43:19] that refuge tonight. You are my refuge.
[1:43:24] You are my sanctuary.
[1:43:29] When I feel afraid,
[1:43:33] you're my hiding place. You're my
[1:43:37] refuge.
[1:43:40] And when the storm
[1:43:42] is raging
[1:43:45] underneath your wings,
[1:43:48] I rejoice and sing. Sing it to him again
[1:43:52] now.
[1:43:55] Oh, you are my refuge.
[1:43:59] You are my sanuary
[1:44:04] when I feel afraid.
[1:44:08] You're my hiding place. You're my
[1:44:12] refuge.
[1:44:15] And when the storm
[1:44:17] is raging
[1:44:20] underneath your wings,
[1:44:24] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:44:30] Amen. Sing. He's got it all in control.
[1:44:33] He's got it all in control.
[1:44:38] He's got it all
[1:44:41] in control.
[1:44:44] You believe it tonight?
[1:44:47] He's got it all in control.
[1:44:53] He has put that reassurance
[1:44:58] way down in my soul.
[1:45:05] He's got it all.
[1:45:08] Amen. I put my life
[1:45:12] I put my life in his [music and singing]
[1:45:15] hand.
[1:45:20] I put my life in his hand.
[1:45:26] Now [singing] every road I'm walking
[1:45:29] down,
[1:45:31] sure it's in his.
[1:45:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:37] Oh, I put my life. Sing that [music]
[1:45:40] chorus again. I put my life. Amen. Have
[1:45:43] you done it tonight?
[1:45:45] Oh, I put my life in his hand.
[1:45:53] I put my life
[1:45:56] in his hand.
[1:46:00] Now every road [music] I walk [singing]
[1:46:03] down,
[1:46:04] sure it's in his plan.
[1:46:11] I put my life. Amen. He's got it all
[1:46:14] now. Amen. We believe it tonight.
[1:46:19] He's got it all in control. [music]
[1:46:27] He's got it all in control.
[1:46:33] He's put that [singing] reassur
[1:46:37] way down [music] in my soul.
[1:46:44] He's got it all in control.
[1:46:50] Amen. Let's try to sing that song. So
[1:46:52] much to thank him for. Key of F, I
[1:46:54] think. So much to thank him for, brother
[1:46:55] Robert.
[1:46:58] When I look
[1:47:00] all around and see all the good things
[1:47:05] God has done for me, I know I'm unworthy
[1:47:11] of them all.
[1:47:15] But his blessings [music]
[1:47:18] he freely gives, I owe my whole life to
[1:47:23] him. I've [music] got so much more to
[1:47:26] thank him for.
[1:47:31] Now I've got so much [music] to thank
[1:47:35] him for.
[1:47:37] So much to praise him for. [music] Well,
[1:47:40] you see, you know, he's been so good to
[1:47:44] me.
[1:47:47] Now [music and singing] when I think
[1:47:50] of all he's done and where Amen. he has
[1:47:54] brought me from I've got
[1:47:56] [singing and music] so much.
[1:47:58] Amen. Amen. Second verse down.
[1:48:03] Yeah. Now sometimes
[1:48:06] while on my way I kneel, I just stop
[1:48:11] [music and singing] and say thank you
[1:48:12] Lord. Oh, for all you've done for me.
[1:48:17] [music]
[1:48:19] For someday
[1:48:22] I'll reach heaven shore. Oh, please just
[1:48:26] let me kneel once more. I've got so much
[1:48:30] to thank
[1:48:32] him for. [music]
[1:48:35] Now I've got so much to thank him for,
[1:48:41] so much [music] to praise him for. You
[1:48:44] see, you know, he's been so good to me.
[1:48:51] Now, when [music] I think
[1:48:54] of [singing] all he's done and where
[1:48:58] he has brought [music] me from, I've got
[1:49:00] so much. Amen. Sing that second [music]
[1:49:03] verse again now.
[1:49:06] Well, now sometimes
[1:49:10] while on my [music] way I need I just
[1:49:14] stop and say thank you Lord. Oh for all
[1:49:19] you've done for me.
[1:49:23] For someday [singing]
[1:49:25] I'll reach heaven [music] sure. Oh
[1:49:28] please just let me kneel once more. I've
[1:49:32] got so much just to thank him for
[1:49:38] now. I've got so much to thank him for.
