in Jesus name amen amen amen you love the Lord this morning isn't it good to be back in the house of the Lord on a Sunday morning I know U we've had some sick and good to see some you back this morning brother Jeff good to see you back this morning and and each one of you that's been sick or been out and and then we've got others that are still out and some that are traveling it's kind of a busy time of year let's just take a moment and set aside for the word of God today can we do that and just really feed on the word I I uh little under the weather myself so you have to bear with me and uh and just uh you know but sometimes it seems like when we're weak in body that's when the Holy Spirit becomes most real to us so I trust that'll be the case today Ruth 1 and verse 6 I want to go back as we preached last time that I preached on a Sunday morning I I preached come home to Bethlehem this morning this morning I want to speak on faithful messengers of the bride's Revival faithful messengers of the bride's Revival amen do you love the Lord amen are you happy to be in church amen amen ruth6 says then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard somehow she found out she heard somebody told her in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread pray the Lord would add his Blessing L to the word you may be seated this morning Naomi had been in Moab for 10 years her husband IMC had let his family there perhaps thinking they would go briefly and come home that's usually the way it starts isn't it it seems like well uh you know it's not working what we're doing and so we'll just do something different for a while and and you stray away from the word of God and you find out that when you do that it's much harder to come home than what you realized and it takes much longer and the road is much more difficult than what you realize to come home but I'm here to encourage you this morning that it's still worth it to come home the road though it may be difficult though you may face difficulties of all kinds and struggles of all kinds yet you need to come home it's worth it to come back to Bethlehem because there's been there's there been a return of bread to Bethlehem there's been a return of the spirit of God of the water of God of of The Well of Bethlehem has got water in it again and and the and the fields of Bethlehem have wheat in them again and so it's worth it to come back to Bethlehem in fact we must go back to Bethlehem as I heard someone say the other day that there are some people who God will allow to go uh uh Beyond his word and he doesn't stop them he just lets go but if you're the elect of God today you can only go so far he would only let Jonas go so far and then he turned him around aren't you glad for that today he would only let you go so far and then he turns you all the way around so the reason that they left initially was famine and it's always better to stay in the land than to leave and I want encourage you young people stay with the word of God keep doing what you're doing keep doing what the Bible says keep keep walking with God don't don't let anything discourage you from being what God called you to be stay in the land it's much better to stay there are many scars that you won't have many things that you won't have to deal with in your life amen and yet if you do stray there's a home to come back to and so there will be famines there there have been famines in the land and there were nine famines in in the Bible in Israel during the Old Testament nine different famines and the Jews say that the 10th would be Amos 811 where he said behold the days come sayith the Lord God I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and I believe we're living in that kind of a time today in that kind of a a famine as far as the world is concerned not for us I believe we have heard the word of the Lord yes so there was a famine in the land and Moses brought the people out of Israel he promised them a land flowing with milk and honey a productive land aren't you glad that God didn't just give us a land uh that that wasn't productive but he give us a a word he give us a place to be he give us a manner of life that we could live it we could be happy we we could have our healing we could we could have salvation for our children he didn't just leave us in a place where we didn't have what we needed aren't you glad you've got what you need today whatever you have need of it's there for you and so we have what we needed and the land was a land that had what they needed and yet it was a land that was uh dependent excuse me on rain it was dependent on rain and and we know that was different from Egypt and I've been over this before but just to kind of drop it in here so we we can get a picture of where I want to go today Egypt was very different Egypt had famines but it was only when the Nile did not flood in the spring because of snow melt in the mountains which was a very rare thing and so most years the Nile flooded I'm gonna get all that out of there in a minute most years the Nile flooded and I just don't get too close to me uh most most years the Nile flooded and and when it did it it it was caus the land to be fertile and the land become uh it become a uh a place where they could grow crops and a place where they could uh uh they could uh uh they could control the amount of water that the crops get and I've been there but the Joel's been there we've actually seen that they have the canals and things that go away from the Nile River you're going to have to fight with me today I'm fighting this cold and you're just going to have to fight with me so uh so if I stop talking you just going to have to start talking so now we know that the snow would melt and and they could control that and so uh so but Israel was not that kind of a land in Deuteronomy 11:10 it says for the land whether thou goest to possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence you come out where thou sest thy seed and wat to it with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the land whether you go to possess it is a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh water of the rain of Heaven a lamb which the Lord thy God carth for yes yes good land the Lord thy God carth for do you believe that you're that kind of land today something the Lord thy God cares for He said the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even until the end of the year so he says God actually controls he actually controls the the rain the amount of moisture that they would get and the ability of the land to begin to produce what was on it and so it would not be a denominational land right come on I'm gonna get this out it would not be a denominational land so in other words denominations control Revival yeah all right I may just have to talk to you this morning denominations control Revival yes and and they control it in the way that uh they they bring in the best speakers and they bring in the best uh they bring in the best of all the uh singers and they bring in the they have the uh choirs and they have uh light shows and and everything like that but that's not how we produce Revival that's right we don't produce Revival with light shows we don't produce Revival with choirs we we have the uh the the Revival is on the inside do you believe that today aren't you glad for a Revival on the inside aren't you glad for a Revival that's not dependent on the weather a Revival that's only dependent on the word of God and the word of God says you can have Revival no matter if there's music or not right you believe that today yeah but Joel you may have take over in a minute it's a land of pro Providence a land that you can a land that you can you you can depend on God for and that's the way our lives are it's something you can depend on God for not a denomination amen and he says in Deuteronomy 11:13 and it shall come to pass if you shall hearken d dently into my Commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God to serve him with all your heart with all your soul that I will give you the rain of your land isn't that a great promise today yes the first rain and the latter rain yes I will send grass in the fields for that cattle th mayest eat and be full he said take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and you turn aside serve other gods and worship them right then the Lord's wrath be against you and he shut up the heaven that there' be no rain so there's a reason why that there was a famine in the land right and the reason is because they left God come on there's always a reason why yeah that there's a famine in the land and the reason is because we leave God yes all right right come on he never left us right you know it's like the old story of the the husband and wife that had set when they were first dating and engaged and and first got married they used to sit right close together on the front seat of the car you know the old cars didn't have nothing in the middle you can sit right close and uh and uh but Dan he says amen he remembers those days and he they sat right close on the front seat and then and then over time you find that she's sitting against this door and he's sitting against that door and the wife began to complain she said you know I I I feel like we're just not as close as we used to be and the husband looked over he said well I'm still driving who Moved he said I didn't move oh my that's the way God is God didn't move we moved or aren't you glad he he's always there if you want to get up close to him again you can get up close to him again so he tells them stay close to the word so they will not stray into idolatry and be unable to possess the land yes stay close to the word so you will not stray into idolatry and be unable to possess the land he said take the words and in your heart and in your soul bind them for a sign on your hand frontlets between your eyes teach them to your children speak of them when you sit in the house and when th walkest by the way when thou liest down when thou risest up yes and thou shalt write them upon the doorpost of that house upon the gates that that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the [Music] lamb which the Lord your swearing your fathers to give them as the days of Heaven on the earth aren't you glad that's a promise today good he said if you'll diligently keep all these Commandments to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways to cleave un to him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you you shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves oh what a promise that is today yes I can do more than I think I can do yeah do you believe that today do you really believe that you can press forward you can do more all right than what you think you can do from the time they came into the Land There was a cycle of Revival and death just Revival and death constantly and it was not because God didn't keep his promise it was because he did keep his promise he's promised he said if that you serve other gods he said I'll withhold the reign he said because I want you to love me yeah I want you to serve me you believe he still wants you to do that today he said I want you to be there right there with me yeah I want I he wants to be close to you somehow after spending a Whole Decade in Moab Naomi found out that the Lord had visited his people somehow she found out that he was a merciful god God yeah there there's a concept in the scripture and I want to get this to you this morning and I won't keep you long because I can't but there's a concept that David introduces in the scripture of forever Mercy or enduring Mercy right and it matters who you are yeah I believe every one of us are is someone that God has called if God didn't call you you wouldn't be here and if God has called you there's enduring Mercy for you there's forever Mercy for you and if you go in the Psalms David over and over says praise the Lord for his Mercy endure forever well come on his mercy endureth forever oh I'm so glad that when I mess up his mercy endureth forever when I can't do what I want to do his mercy endureth for he says in Psalm 1387 he said though I walk in the midst of trouble thou will revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies thy right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy oh Lord endureth forever do you believe that today thy mercy oh Lord aren't you glad for a merciful god he said forsake not the works of thine own hands yes so there was always a promise of Revival he said If my people what you're called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from Heaven I will forgive their sin will heal their land oh aren't you glad for that promise today amen and I know some people say well it's been too long since I've been in church it it's been too long since I've served God but he has enduring Mercy yes it's been too long since I've really prayed and felt his presence I but been I've been just mailing it in I've been going through the motions but he has enduring Mercy yes you know it been 2,000 years since the Jews rejected Christ 2,000 years since they said let his blood be on us and on our children but yet they will have their day of atonement why that's God's chosen people right right they will have their days of atonement and there will be an elect group of those Jews that will actually believe on Christ at the end time they will have they will receive the Holy Ghost they will have their day of atonement even 2,000 years later why because of the enduring mercy of God and so the Bible tells us that there would be there would be H there would be cities in Judah again there would be there would be uh the voice of joy in Jeremiah 33:11 the voice of of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever oh my what do they realize that God God's mercy went further than their Disobedience do you really believe today that God's mercy goes beyond your Disobedience can we really grab a hold of that concept that even if I miss it even if I miss the will of the Lord even if I mess up even if I don't do maybe haven't done everything I should do God's mercy went beyond my Disobedience and he called me out anyway and he loved me anyway and he trusted me anyway aren't you glad for that yes sir wonderful yes and when they come this time you realize they'll never backside again yeah yeah but JT all those years Jehovah had trouble because Israel just constantly kept backslide right they constantly kept going back to other gods he said I'm going to bring them to a place yes where they'll never backside again right he's I'm GNA put the son of David back on the throne right Christ is coming back on the throne the son of David why is he doing that because there will become a Time Israel won't back slide again you realize that's the that's the time he's called us to as well he's called a bride that would not fall he called a people oh my though we may backslide in our in our flesh and our spirit yet they sealed Us in to the day of our Redemption that we will not fall again we'll be home as they will be home because his mercy endureth yes forever yes and and we found for the entire church age that the cycle of Revival and death continues yeah it just keeps going right over Revival and death Revival and death Disobedience followed by famine followed by desperation followed by visitation followed by Disobedience and the cycle continues for Seven Ages but there had to come a time when the cycle would be broken we're living in that time and and and what I want to the concept that I want to get to this morning is that there must be somebody to tell Naomi somebody's got to be got to be a witness yes of what's going on in Bethlehem all right that can tell Naomi who strayed that there's there's wheat in Bethlehem again there's bread in Bethlehem again there's water there's been rain in Bethlehem all right so there's got to be somebody faithful who stayed true to God and I trust that's us this morning got to be somebody who's been faithful and trustworthy to actually bring the message that they that that they will believe when you tell them that there's something going on in Bethlehem and so the one came and and told Naomi about this visitation and in order for her to believe it I think first of all it would have to be a trustworthy person that would have to come and and Jesus said it this way you know you've got to trust in Christ and and he had to get the people the hardest thing to do is to get a human being to believe another human being yeah do you know that right and Jesus had to get human beings to believe in him yeah who was a human being and yet he was God in flesh yes but he said let not your heart be troubled he said you believe in God believe also in me and the hardest thing that we do as Christians is to get human beings to believe us right yeah yeah right because we are not perfect right we made our mistakes right we've done our things that are wrong yeah and the hardest thing to do is to get human beings to say to say I believe what you're telling me all right I can see that you're a witness of it now brother brandom the angel told Brother brandom what did he said what did the angel say if you get the people to believe you yes and then be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before the prayer so there were two parts to it he said if you can get the people to believe you then be sincere and we find that playing out and brother brandom types his ministry to eleazer Abraham's servant Abraham's trustworthy servant Genesis 24:2 that the Bible tells us that Abraham spoke to his eldest servant who ruled over all that he had and so he's telling us that that there's there's a a trusted servant there he didn't just come to the uh to one that just started Ed he didn't come to one that that that wasn't uh wasn't responsible but he come to one who was responsible his eldest servant ruled over all that he had and he said he said promise me this that you'll go get a wife for Isaac yes he needed a trustworthy servant brother bandam said it's a beautiful lesson of Abraham a type of God the Father hunting for a servant to go find a bride for his son he said that's what the father is doing today he looking over his group to see someone that he can put trust in that'll take the message that he sends to the bride someone he can put a try say God let that be me today let that be me because we know it's not just preachers but it's all of us God wants a trustworthy servant he said he said he decided that elzer was the selected one because he'd found elzer a trustworthy servant he' been loyal and true and upright and just and honest he said that's the kind of a Serv that God can pick to take a message from him to the church as one that's been proven to be just he said do you remember my sermon last time here on selecting for the placing of a son how he was proven first and then adopted in the family or placed positionally and elzar met the requirement that Abraham was requiring and Abraham represents the model servant he said you've read the story in Genesis 24 how he did not go out until he was sent that's important we go out when he sends us and we go where he sends us he said there's many goes out just for what money they can get out of it there others I tell you what if you're in it for the money you're in the wrong ball game a lot of other things I could do to make money these others he said goes to make a great name for themselves I say Amen to that as well if you if you're if you are going out to make a great name for yourself this is not the place to be right and the preaching the message of the hour others goes out to be popular others goes because some man-made regime sends them but there's some that'll wait until God sends them he said the model servant will do that amen he said notice when he went he only went where he was sent to not just come over here because there's more money or down here because there's bigger crowds he went exactly where he was sent to he said God's looking for men today that will move when the holy spirit moves anywhere that he may send he said that's a model servant yeah he said not only that but when he got to his place where his messages was to be given he never boasted on himself he never spoke about how great he was he said or how great his meetings was or how great anything about himself he wasn't a boaster or proud but he only spoke of his master of his master's wealth and that his master had a son that was going to fall air to everything the master had he said what a beautiful picture of a real servant of God his whole attention is on the master telling the people not about himself but about about the master all right about the son and he's going to fall heir to All Things yes oh don't you believe we had a messenger in this age like that aren't you glad when you were in Moab when you were in denomination that God sent a prophet in our day that would tell you about somebody else that that wanted to marry you he didn't tell you about himself he told you about the one who was coming and he pointed us to Christ the word he wasn't a boaster or proud but he told about one had a son who was going to fall air to everything the master had yeah he said what a beautiful picture of a real servant of God his whole attention is on the master telling the people not about himself but about The Master about the son he's going to fall air to all things he said he has so much time talking about the master and the son until he has no time to boast on himself or his great regime or his denomination or some affiliation that he has it's all on the master oh aren't you glad for aren't you glad that God still has servants today that it's all about the master it's all about him it's not about us it's about Christ and so I want to ask this morning are we faithful Messengers all right you say well I'm not a Preacher Brother Ben well I didn't say you had to be but the bandom said everybody can't be a preacher right but you got a voice yes he said if you can't preach to people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach let me read that again if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach yeah if you're not you're still a preacher all right but live the people of sermon yes that's good let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that'll bring reproach to them who reject it yes they say now no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living if there ever was a man of God it's that man or that woman he said see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher he said you get all mixed up anyhow now there's a problem problem tooo many people not trying to preach not called to be a preacher all right but he said if you're not called to be a preacher live your sermon yeah don't try to preach it he said he said you get people tangled up you won't know well you'll ruin them and yourself too he said just live your sermon said the preacher's called to preach his and to live it too he said if you can't live it then you stop preaching it he said but you're supposed to live your sermons he talked about those voices he said all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness isn't that what we want this morning we may not have the best delivery the best voice or the best ability to tell something but we need thousands of lived voices I may not have the voice to speak to you this morning but let my life be a voice let my life be a voice that's what we want thousands of lived voices Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and and Holiness Purity undefiled lies walking around in the Earth today without a blemish he said that's real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything come on Church call him have we reached that place call him anything say anything to him just as sweet as it can be and move right on he said oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil remember he said you had to get the people to believe you and be sincere yeah get the people to believe you and be sincere it's why brother Brandon when he goes to uh he goes to and you think about some of these tele evangelists that were out there that day the tent evangelist back then now they're T evangelist they could do just about anything go pray for the sick yeah yeah sure they could be drinking smoking carrying on with women go pray for the sick brother brandom tells a white lie you remember the story he told he he tells a sto a little bit of a fib he said I'm not in the house he he he wasn't in the house but he had been to an attorney now I don't even know if it's wrong to lie to an attorney I'm not sure it is but you know everything he's outside the house if you're going to lie to somebody that's but he's outside the house and he says tell them I'm gone well you know what happened he went to pray for a sick baby he couldn't do it he couldn't get through yeah now why not brother brandom had to be sincere when he prayed he was that model servant he had to be trustworthy he had to be sincere oh God help us to be like that live so close to God that we wouldn't we wouldn't allow anything to come between ourselves and being able to help somebody yeah the disciples found the same thing with the case of epilepsy yeah when they went down to deliver it and and they couldn't do it but brother brand said here come Jesus he said and the devil saw that life he said he wasn't scared of their shouting and and screaming and hollering and all that he said but he was scared of that life yeah the devil was scared of that life oh let me live that kind of Life today let me have that Life of Christ he told the disciples he said you need to be more sincere this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting you can't be in it for the money Paul told Timothy the love of money is the root of all evil he said which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows but thou oh man of God flee these things follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of Faith yeah it's going to be a fight yes I had to fight to get up this morning fight to come to church fight to stand here and preach but it's worth the fight huh I hope you're with me this morning it's it's worth the fight to be in the house of God it's worth the fight to reach one last Soul it's worth the fight if we got to fight every day of our life I think of others who fought much more than I fought and they fought and they continued to fight until the day that they died why because it was worth the fight yes yes wonderful amen I believe that today fight the good fight of Faith they hold on eternal life where to Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses he said that's the kind of servant that I want that's the one I want going to Moab to tell Naomi that there's a Revival there's a bride's Revival in Bethlehem messenger must have personal experience with that Revival in other words he been to Bethlehem he drank the water he ate the bread oh I've told ministers before I said I want you to study I want you to study I like to see a man that's study before he gets in the Pulpit don't you you want to see somebody who's got something to say but most of all I want you to pray because if you're not if if you're not prayed through if you don't have personal experience then you're never going to you're never going to have anything that the people will believe there there's nothing that that that that will connect you to your message there's got to be something there that's connected to the message you got to drink the water yes if you're going to tell about Bethlehem you got to drink Pentecostal water sometimes all right right if you're going to tell people about Bethlehem you got to eat the bread of life you got to spend your time in the word so you got to have that experience with God it it was elaser that Abraham promised him he said when you go he said my angel he shall send his Angel before thee in Genesis 247 he said he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then but the B said El eer had the assurance that the angel was going before him then he could decide to go because he had something to back him up he said I think that ought to be the Assurance of every man of God that preaches the gospel that he's got something positive from God that'll back up what he preaches I trust that we have something positive today he said if you haven't got it Brethren it's for you he said God still sends his men with an angel before him when he goes to take the message to the church yes now Mary knew when she it's Christmas time and Mary knew that the baby that she carried was of the Holy Ghost why because she said he overshadowed me he has overshadowed her she knew whose it was and brother BR said so is every believer that accepts God's word into their heart he said I don't care what the systems say you know what it is it's a promise of God it was revealed to you by the Holy Ghost when you were overshadowed with his power you know where it's at he he said no man has a right to preach the gospel until he's met God back on the backside of the desert in that burning bush where there's no ecclesiastical system in the world can explain it away from you you got to have a backbone about you you got to have something when everything else fails that you're willing to do what God says you got to have something that you're willing to preach through difficulty you got to have something you're willing to testify through difficulty if you're going to be a Christian in this day and age you got to have something that you're willing to fight through and something that you're willing to grab a hold of the Bible says the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force what it means is that you got to be willing to grab a hold of the promises of God you got to be willing to to say make it yay and amen in my life I can't just sit here like the like the three men did the three lepers at the Gate of Samaria they said why sit we here till we die Let's cross on over to the enemy camp let's go over and we're not going to the enemy camp we're going into the full Promises of God you got to have something that no man can explain away from you you're a witness to it in Luke 24 49 Jesus told the disciples he said ter in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you need to taste the bread you need to drink the water before you go out and start telling people about it all right not only that but you got to be faithful to tell the story yes you believe that today yes the messenger has to be faithful to tell the story how shall they hear without a preacher I've told you it's my responsibility to stand here on Sunday morning yeah it's my responsibility to stand here and preach to you the word of God I got to be faithful to tell the story there's bread in Bethlehem yes there's a life you can live there's an overcoming power of God there's healing in the in the in the message of the hour there there's there's faith in them in the word of God there's a power in the word of God today that'll keep your family in the the right place that'll keep your church in the right place that'll bring the power the supernatural power of God back again there's a there's a power in the word we got to be faithful to tell that story today you got to be faithful to tell it not only in the Pulpit but in the Pew and at the work say well how do I tell that story you go to church when the doors are open all right you're telling a story yeah years ago I realized that my phone knows I go to church cuz it tells me how far it is to church church every time at church if we're ever on vacation or something it'll tell me how far it is to get back to church I I thank God that our phones even learn we have a habit of going to the house of God oh my there ought to be something in our lives so we know oh it's not just another Sunday morning but I'm going to take my place with the Lord's despise few I'm going to do what God says all right amen you you've got to be certain and and and to be a faithful messenger of the bride's Revival you got to know there is a Revival yeah and you've got to be willing to preach the promise of that Revival yeah are you with me so far he said not only that but when elzar left the father of Isaac which represented the father of Christ he loaded the whole train of camels with good gifts for the bride so he did not just tell her about it but he showed her about it he showed her what the father had for her all right he said oh I feel religious right now he said oh how I love Jesus he loaded the camels full of good gifts to give to the bride and he never told her they were for another generation or another day but they were for the bride do you believe that today he never told her they were for another generation or for another day but they were for the bride and every truth servant of God that's sent out here has got a whole book full of divine promises that he can offer to the bride he said I'm so glad of that he's got gifts in there for her and he will not hold any of them back he will give every one of them freely do you believe that today a true servant a model servant a servant that God can put trust in he won't try to hide it back from her because he knows she is the oncoming Queen Oh my he knows who he's preaching to yeah wonderful he said oh there's no good thing withheld from them That'll Walk UPR right before him do you believe that today whatever you have need of this morning there's no good thing withheld from them who walk upright before him whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will it shall be given unto you he said the book's full of it and every promise in the book is yours you the bride do you believe that today that ought to encourage us this morning to preach the bride's Revival a faithful messenger must have recognized The Awakening of the Bride brother the Bram said it would take those seven unknown Thunders to wake her up again but he said he'll send it he promised it he talks about how she was dead if the churches would forget their Creeds and forget their dogmas just take the Bible plead the promise it would come effective to them he said but you see Jesus said you with your Traditions make the word of God not effective to you he said well that's the same thing today with spiritual Eve the spiritual bride of today he said the church she takes the word of God and she won't accept it she accepts dogmas instead therefore the word is not effective to her because she tries to inject her Creed with the word and it won't work so he said she's dead we could say she's in a famine but there's a reason why she's in a famine there's a reason why she's dead she accepts dogmas instead of the word so if she would accept the word instead of Dogma what's going to happen Revival's on again yeah are you with me now he said I just keep reading this here heral of his coming across the headlines we need a prophet to return we need a prophet to return He said I guess when he does return they'll know nothing about it all right one year later he said this in 1964 he said everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining ministers crying he said I was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes to the church a very fine paper I know the editor I know the people brother and sister Moore The Herald of his coming he said one of the finest papers on the field he said but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pre fast prey sound a trumpet he said how many reads that you know he said you see it all the time fast pray it's all you hear we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all if you pray we're not too late yet why did they do that he said they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an awaken in they're good people what why is it what have they done he said they've not recognized The Awakening of the bride all right they missed it so a faithful messenger has to have not missed the return of bread to Bethlehem yeah they have to be able to recognize you can't preach this message unless you've recognized there's bread back in Bethlehem that the Revival's on that the word has been revealed yeah he said they're believing they're crying there will be an Awakening they're good people by being a Christian they fill the pull of the hour but they have haven't recognized what's been done yes and so many people today that's what the problem is that's why they're trying to go back and say well we just go back and not have preachers anymore we just sit and and and do our thing and go through the form of it don't you realize what they're doing they did not recognize the Awakening of the Bride they can't recognize a bride Revival right in front of them yes because brother BR said be so simple why because it's in human beings yes that's right but a faithful messenger's got to be able to stay stand and I am the bride's Revival that's what the man said when they were looking for the Welch Revival those men rode across the sea and and they get off the boat and and in Wales and and there's a little policeman standing there swinging his billy club and they come over to him and said could you direct us to the bride or to the Welsh Revival and he said I am the Welsh Revival yeah you found it amen oh I believe every one of us ought to be able to say that today but if Naomi was hungry if Naomi was thirsty If she' lost everything that she had and she found herself down in Moab in a denomination somewhere that she could say I I understand that there's something going on cuz I see it in your life I see that you're a faithful messenger of the bride's Revival brother brandom tells us I'm closing in just a moment brother brandham tells us about two Cals in the springtime he said one of them had a great big fancy Barn all right he said that they had gold handles on the doors that that's a fancy Barn right there ours didn't have no doors just rolled something in front of it they had a fancy Barn gold handles on the doors and and uh everything was just perfect all laid out but they didn't feed the poor thing just just fed him scraps and so this this one was raised all winter he was kept up in the barn he just eaten yesterday Mana you know just just kind of just kind of didn't care what they fed him but there was another Old Barn said had holes in it and and and had all kinds of problem didn't look very good he said but on the inside it was full of hay yeah and on the inside he was eating this alphaalpha Hay all winter long he'd been eating he said come springtime the air begin to warm up and and and the birds begin to chirp again and he said they let these two calvs out here come the one calf out of the fancy Barn he can just barely move all right said he just got he I don't hardly have any ability at all so well I'm a little bit a little bit tired today I don't think I'll be able to make it to the house of God I just just you've been like that right all right come on come on we all have at some point or another depends on what we're feeding on yeah all right well I I just don't know if I can believe the promise or not said just kind of stumbling around the light blinds him you know he said but here come the other calf out of the old barn oh I like the good old way don't you he come out of the old barn he said but he'd been fed all winter said he was just as fat as could be and he'd come running out there jumping you ever seen a calf in the spring how they'll jump and rejoice why did they do that because they've been well fed they've been taken care of amen and so when he got out there in the green grass he could just enjoy the presence of God I believe that's the way we ought to be today that's the way we ought to be in the house of God we ought to be able to kick up our heels and jump and and be excited about the things of God why we've been well fed on the inside we found a seven course meal of God's word we've been fed the word of God we ought to be able to Rejoice like nobody else we ought to be able to worship like nobody else we ought to be faithful Messengers The wellfed Calf was a faithful messenger of the bride's Revival and the well-fed Christian is a faithful messenger of the bride's Revival today Lord let me feed on the bread of Bethlehem musicians go ahead and come Lord let me feed on the bread of Bethlehem drink from The Well of Bethlehem till I become a faithful messenger of the bride's Revival Rebecca become a faithful messenger did you know that do you know it wasn't just elaser that was a messenger it was actually Rebecca Rebecca became a messenger of the Revival why she wore the gifts that he gave her you know the Bible says that and her brother came to see and when he came to see the Bible says he saw that she had on what the prophet or what elzer gave her if the prophet was the model servant and he gives certain things to the bride if we just leave them there we can appreciate them we can listen to them and say oh I I just love it but if you'll put them on if you'll wear them if you'll start doing what he said then the then the Brethren can see that you've been with there's something real about what he's saying and the Bible said he invited the messenger back to the house because he saw what Rebecca was wearing oh I say let let us be a faithful messenger of the bride's Revival let's wear the gifts that he give us can you do that today I apologize this morning I I I can't don't hardly have the and it's not anything serious I'm just I I I just had a cold and trying to kick it and get over just that time a year but I'll say this God's word is still true whether I'm able or not he's still able he's still the same yesterday today and forever let me declare every day of my life every hour of the day he's still God he's still just the same oh I pray that I'll be able to do that until the moment he takes me home amen do you love him today oh oh God could you bow your heads together with me and how many would say Lord let me wear the promises of God in my life let me let me take the gifts that that have been given me let let me wear it don't let me just talk about it or argue about it let me wear it let me be a faithful messenger of the Bride Revival let me
