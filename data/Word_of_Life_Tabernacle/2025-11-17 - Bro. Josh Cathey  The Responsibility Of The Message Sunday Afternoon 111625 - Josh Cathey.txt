Amen. Aren't you thankful that we have someone who came? Wonder if we could stand together and let's just try to keep it fast for a minute. trying to stay awake. I'm so glad he found me. Thank you, G. Well, I'm so glad he found me. He loved [music] me, found me. He put his arms all around [singing] me and then he led me to the shelter. And [music and singing] now I'm one of his own. [music] And know the joy of knowing [singing and music] with heart knowing someday [singing] I'm going to [music] my home. [singing] My home in glory. I'm going to walk on streets paid with [singing] gold. [music] Well, I [music] was on the mountain. I was wandering [singing] from the fountain [music] when I heard my Savior speak to me. [music and singing] Well, he said, "Come to me, riding of your [music and singing] sins, repenting, and I will lead you out where you [music and singing] can see, singing, I'm so glad, [music] so glad he [singing] found me. Love he found me. He put his arms all around [singing and music] me. Oh, then he led me. Yes, he [music and singing] did. To the shelter. And now [music and singing] I'm one. Oh, his own. And know [singing] the [music] joy, the joy of knowing with the hearts of glowing. [music] Someday I'm [singing] going to [music] my home, my home in glory. [music] I'm going to walk on streets paid with gold. I [music] like this one. Well, I will love him ever. I will stray [music and singing] from him. No, never. For he's the dearest friend I ever knew. [singing] Oh, and when I [music] see him launder, my love will still [music] grow [singing] fonder in that happy land beyond [singing] the blue. Let me hear you sing it now. Well, I'm so glad, so glad [music] you found me. He put his arms all around [music and singing] me and he led me [music] to [singing] the shelter. And now I one [music] of his own will [singing] the joy of knowing with hearts [music] are glowing. Someday I'm going to my home. [music] My home in glory. We're going to walk on [music and singing] streets paid. We go. [music and singing] Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight. [applause] Amen. It won't be long. This song has more than one meeting. It doesn't mean we're going to be out of here quick necessarily, although we need to be not. Amen. But we're looking forward to what the Lord has for [music] us tonight. Amen. Brother Josh Kathy, they're from Arizona. He's got family here, his mom, his dad. Good to have you all with us tonight. Amen. We [music] sure love Brother Josh. He's a he's a good friend. And of course, you know, we got a lot to follow up after preaching behind Brother [music] Josh Martin this morning. But uh but but I I know that the Lord will use him. He's he's just a young minister. Hadn't been preaching that long, but he every time we've had him, we've enjoyed him, and he's always [music] said something that would help the church. So, uh we're we're glad to have him back. and uh just pull on the gift of God. Like I told you this morning, it ain't going to hurt nobody to say amen. Nobody at all. You know, we [music] we we put a lot on the preacher. Amen. But let's just open our hearts and receive. You know, we can we can uh we can we can come to criticize or we can come to pull on the gift of God. And I say it's a lot easier, you know, when you're having fun in church. And there's no reason not to. So, as brother Josh comes, it [music] won't be long then we'll be leaving here. Amen. I believe that we're getting to the time where we can sing this song and know what we're talking about. You can see all around us things are happening and uh you know, you can look at the signs of the time and and [music] the world is is going insane. And I'll say this, it's a fearful time for the world. But this is a good time for the bride because when you see promises being fulfilled, lift up your lift up your heads because redemption drawth nigh. Amen. If you're ready to go, I think it's a it's a time that ought to be exciting for us. Amen. to know that what we know we have the greatest [music] message that ever hit the face of the earth and it's getting us ready for a rapture. Amen. By whatever methods you know God could God used God used a donkey one time and he uses men and he uses every every kind of you know there's there's there's fast preachers, slow [music] preachers, teachers, all kinds. But you know God wanted all of them. He said all of them in the church. And so you know we can sit here and say this one preaches better and this one preaches less. [music] You know, we can we can sit here and do all that human thinking all we want to, but I'm telling you here tonight, God can use anybody. And I believe he's going to use our brother here tonight. Amen. Do you believe it? Are you going to pull on the gift of God? Amen. As he comes, let's sing this with all of our hearts. Oh, it won't be. No, it won't [singing] be long. Then we'll be leaving. Oh, yes, we will. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] it won't it won't be long. Oh, [singing] we'll be going. Sing. It won't be long again. Oh, [singing] it won't. No, it won't [singing] be long. Then we'll be leaving. [music] Leaving here. Oh, it won't [music] be long. We'll be going home. Aren't you looking forward to it? We'll be going. [music and singing] Yes, we will. With all your hearts now. Oh, [singing] so count the years [music] as much. Oh, [music and singing] and count the months as weeks [music] and count the weeks [singing] as days any [music] day now. Oh, [singing] we'll be going. Count the years again with all your hearts. Oh, so [music] count the years as much. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and count the months as sweet. [music] Oh, and [singing] count the weeks as days. Any day now. Oh, [singing] we'll [music] be going one more time. It won't be long. Oh, it won't [music and singing] be long. Heat. Heat. [music] Oh, and count the winds and stay. Any day [music] now, we'll be [singing] going. God bless you this evening. Amen. God bless you this evening. It's good to be here with you. And the only thing I could uh catch from what brother Joel was saying when I was in the back was that he compared me to a donkey. So [laughter] So good. Good. Perfect. That's just what a preacher wants to hear when he's about to come to the come to the pull pit. Amen. Well, we're happy to be here. It's always always has a very home feel to it. Um you you guys receive me and my family when we come every time and I just really appreciate it and it it means a lot and I just thank you for it. And I'm this evening I just have a short simple thought on my heart. I'm I'm not near the preacher that that Josh M is, but we'll see what the Lord will do. see if he can work through a different vessel as well. And if we could, while we're standing, turn over to Matthew 27:24, Matthew 27:24. And as brother Josh, he was he was speaking this morning, he was speaking about a quote where brother Brandham says, very familiar quote. He says, "God doesn't send judgment without warning. &gt;&gt; God will not send judgment upon the people without warning." And I'm so thankful for that that we serve a a fair God, a God that'll ju just imagine starting at a job, starting a new job somewhere, working something different. And you have a boss and he just says, "Well, just just start going to work. Start going to work." Then you start working and you don't exactly know what you're supposed to be doing. You don't know how to do it. You don't know in what fashion to do it. And that wouldn't be very fair of that boss. But I'm so thankful that we have one that's given us a code of conduct. He's given us instruction. He's he's he's told us what our benefits package is. &gt;&gt; He's told us what we have access to as workers for the gospel. In Matthew 27:24, if we could just bow our heads before we read it. Heavenly Father, Lord, we count this a privilege. And Father, we thank you for this this opportunity to come before you and worship your name and speak on your word, Lord. If we just if we read a verse and we closed it, Lord, that would be enough reading your your everlasting word, Father. And we just ask that you would continue with us. And Lord, that you would get me out of the way, Father. That you would speak through this vessel, Lord. that if I were to say anything that you wouldn't have me to say, Father, that you would stop me. And Lord, just anoint each one. Anoint ears to hear, eyes to see. And Father, we just ask that you would continue with us this evening in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. In Matthew 27:24, it says, "When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but rather atonement was made, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person." He said, "See ye to it." Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. You may be seated. And so Pilate here, Pilate, he he the the message of Pilate's hour had just presented itself to him. It was standing right in front of him. Christ in every age, when when you break it down, when when you take out all the extra stuff that people want to put onto the message, Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ, that is the message of every hour there's ever been, of any age there's ever been. When you go Old Testament, when you take it back there, angel of the covenant, and there was a messenger of the covenant in Moses, you bring it to the new, you have John, a messenger of the covenant. And I believe that we've received another messenger of the covenant in this day as John introduced Christ the first time. &gt;&gt; The church now, the the bride of Jesus Christ needed a reintroduction to Jesus Christ. It needed all the loose ends. Everything that had been scrupled up, tied back up and reintroduced to the bride of Jesus Christ. And I believe that's came in this hour today. &gt;&gt; I believe that's what we have. &gt;&gt; And so Pilate here, he he's faced with the message of his hour. And the truth is right in front of him. And Pilate is responsible. &gt;&gt; He has a responsibility. And that's the title of the message tonight. The responsibility of the message. what what you're holding in your hand. We are responsible for so much because so much has been revealed. Where there's revelation, there's responsibility. &gt;&gt; When when the Lord shows somebody something, shows a people something and reveals a message. When Christ is he, brother Brandham talks about Pilate could not wash it off his hands. He he could have washed and washed and washed and he could not wash Jesus off his hands. And we are in that same place. the revelation of Jesus Christ. We've had it. We've had the fullness, the full revelation &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; And we cannot wash it off. &gt;&gt; We cannot get it off of our hands. He is on our hands. And what will we do with him? &gt;&gt; When you think about it, you know, many times we say the Jews, they crucified and the the Roman government, they did it. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham tells us it was us that pierced him. &gt;&gt; It was our sins that pierced him. It was nobody but our sins. That's what he died for on that cross. And we cannot forget that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could turn over to Joshua 8:es 33 and 35. &gt;&gt; And the question this evening is, what are we going to do with him? &gt;&gt; Are we going to leave him hanging on that cross? &gt;&gt; Are we going to leave him right there? Leave him a god of history. Leave him a god of the past. Or are we going to bring him here? Are we going to bring him on a scene with our worship, with our praise, with an offering to him? &gt;&gt; We're responsible of these things. Joshua 8:es 33 and 35. I didn't start my timer up here. Joel's going to be mad at me. He gave me about 20 27 and a half minutes. So, we'll see if we can finish in that time. It says, ' And all Israel and their elders and the officers, and this is Israel, they are in the promised land here. And all Israel and their elders and the officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests, the Levites, which bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as well the stranger, and he that was born among them. Half of them over against Mount Gerism, and half of them over against Mount Ebal, as Moses, a servant of the Lord, had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. And afterward, he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings. He didn't leave nothing out. &gt;&gt; He didn't pick and choose what he wanted to read. He he didn't sift through it and only read what he understood and what he didn't understand. But he read all the blessings, all the cursings. He you could say he took the fullness of the word that he had right then and he lived by it. He read that word. &gt;&gt; Says according to all that is written in the book of the law. He said, "There was not there was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them." What was it? What was Joshua doing here? He had a responsibility because of the message that he had heard. He knew that it was his responsibility to get that message out. It's our responsibility today to get that message out. And I I I recently I was at a at a ministers meeting and one of the topics was as a young preacher, how do you know if you're called to preach? And and the brother got up and he was speaking on it and he was uh he was talking about the question and he got into, you know, we should be backing young preachers. And I guess that's good for me to say standing up here, but but he got on that topic and that we should be pushing them and because brother Brandham said, if you have a call in your life to preach, then preach. Get in a pullpit somewhere and start preaching the word. He said, "We need good preachers." &gt;&gt; It's what the prophet told us. And so, as the brother was going on and saying, "We we need to back preachers. We need to we need to help them out as much as we can. Not be so critical, not sit sit in a seat of the scornful, get give him an opportunity, give him a chance." And another brother got up with a different mindset. He said, "I believe that all that is predestinated." He said, "I believe that the Lord will take care of it. It's predestinated. It it's it it's all fine. But we are his hands and his feet. That's such a lazy way of thinking about things. We can't just point back to it's it's predestinated. But God needs some boots on the ground. He needs people that will go spread his word. He needs people that'll take it no matter if if you're scared to. I guarantee you that Joshua and Caleb were not ashamed to say that they believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you when somebody said, "Where do you go to church? What do you believe?" They didn't say, "Oh, some kind of knockoff Pentecostal church, something like that." No, they said, "I believe Moses's message. I believe a message has came to free us out of bondage. &gt;&gt; He needs boots on the ground." He needs people that are willing to go and tell. That's a commission. Go ye and tell. &gt;&gt; Tell somebody about it. &gt;&gt; We can't be ashamed of it. It's our life. It's our absolute. It's everything to us. We wouldn't know how to do anything without it. We wouldn't know the the right Jesus without it. &gt;&gt; Many churches out there, they don't even know the Jesus that they're talking about. They don't know how to baptize. &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about the serpent seed. They don't know the true message of grace. &gt;&gt; They don't have this know there where where that knowledge is, there's responsibility that comes with it. We're we're we were not we were not put here to sit in a tall tower and look out at everybody else that's lower than us &gt;&gt; and point and say what they're doing wrong &gt;&gt; and what they don't know. &gt;&gt; But we were called to go out and bring them into that very same tower. &gt;&gt; Go out and tell them about what we know. &gt;&gt; Tell them the good news. That's what the gospel means. The gospel is the good news. and we have a responsibility to one another as well. &gt;&gt; You know, many times when things come up in life, I've noticed this about myself in the past. I'll tell on myself when when life gets hard, when things come up in my life, what some of the first responsibilities that I sherk away from are my church responsibilities. Attendance drops. I think, well, I'm tired today. It'll be easier to stay at home. What's one service? What's it matter if I miss one service? But that one service turn turns into two services. When you set that standard with yourself, &gt;&gt; when that becomes your your precedent right there, one service turns into two and then you miss three or four that month and then and then pretty soon you're out of church. We've seen it. &gt;&gt; We've seen it happen. &gt;&gt; But I just pray don't let me be a heady high-minded believer. &gt;&gt; Don't don't let me be a believer that's that's so far above everybody that I think that nobody can tell me anything. I can't take any correction, you know. Let's turn over to Psalm 23 real quick. Just came to my mind. You know, there's actually by by the Bible standard, there's comfort in correction. &gt;&gt; And Psalm 23, when you read it, it's the it's the relationship between the the shepherd and the sheep. That's what it's telling you about. That's what it's describing here. It says, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me." Now, if you if if you know anything about her sheep, that rod and that staff, that rod can be used to fend off any predators that are after the sheep. But that same rod that will fend off a predator is the same rod that'll hit that sheep over the head when it starts getting out of line. &gt;&gt; It's the very same rod and that same staff that can be used to poke things away from the sheep, that can shield it, that can guide it. It's the same staff that'll jerk that sheep back if it gets out of line. We have to be comfortable in correction. &gt;&gt; We have to be comfortable with the word correcting things in our life. If we if if we get to a point where we're uncomfortable with that, we how can we take headship? &gt;&gt; If we want to talk about a I'm not big on talking about problems in the message or problems in churches or anything like that, but if there is a spirit out in the land today, it's a spirit against headship. &gt;&gt; People don't want headship. PE people don't they they don't want it from the prophet. &gt;&gt; They don't and if if you don't take it from the Lord and it passes down through your home and the man of the house if Jesus Christ is not his head then what kind of head is he going to be in the home? &gt;&gt; What kind of house home life are we talking about there? &gt;&gt; It's dangerous stuff. &gt;&gt; But here in this scripture Joshua he had some leadership responsibilities. You see in the scripture who it was talking about that was all around him. It says with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them. Now this just wasn't a bunch of born again believers. It wasn't a bunch of just just clean people that were among them. It says twice there that the stranger was among them. &gt;&gt; P people that probably didn't look that great. People that probably didn't have a buttonup on. &gt;&gt; People that wasn't wearing a tie that day. &gt;&gt; Maybe they were a little bit dirty. Those people were among him, too. And he still preached the message to them. &gt;&gt; He still pushed the message to them. He didn't hold back. He didn't say, "Well, I'm going to try and pick and choose and see what they can understand and what they can't." People have heard the tape marriage and divorce and came in and people have heard a simple tape like expectations and they've came in. It is not our place to pick and that's God's job to pick and choose how he brings his sheep into the fold. It is not our job to pick and choose what they can handle and what they cannot handle. &gt;&gt; But Joshua is talking to to many different classes of people here. Sometimes I think we want them to walk in fully trained. &gt;&gt; Because a ra a birth we know is a mess. &gt;&gt; And if they're not trained, it's going to be a mess. &gt;&gt; It's going to be you're going to have somebody sitting there. They might stink a little bit. Their clothes might be dirty a little bit. They might not have the fanciest shoes on. They might be a mess. But were we not a mess &gt;&gt; when he reached down his hand for us? &gt;&gt; Where were you at when he reached down for you? &gt;&gt; What were you into when he when his grace shone in your life? &gt;&gt; What were you doing? &gt;&gt; Would you have reached out to you? If you passed you on the street before before the Lord grabbed a hold of you, would you have talked to you? &gt;&gt; Would you have invited you to church? What would you have done? Or would you would you have kept walking past you? &gt;&gt; Because you think about whoever many of us have people that have been mentors in our life, the the person that introduced the message to us, whatever it may be that that led us to Christ and you think about what they meant. I don't want to sherk away from that responsibility. &gt;&gt; If it's my responsibility to pass somebody on the street and say, "Would you like to come to church on Sunday?" If the Lord put that in my heart, my only prayer is that I'm obedient enough to to to adhere to it. That's my prayer. Lord, let me be willing. Let me have an obedient heart so when that time does come, &gt;&gt; I can hear you talking to me and I can stop and speak to somebody. Church, it's our responsibility to do that. &gt;&gt; Who else is going to do it? &gt;&gt; Who else has the truth? Yeah, &gt;&gt; me and brother George were talking recently and he I don't know if brother Billy Paul told him this or told somebody else and he had heard it, but brother Billy Paul, he he said he never caught a cleaned fish. &gt;&gt; He said when he went fishing that he had never caught a fish that was already cleaned. &gt;&gt; You had to catch it. You had to get it, maybe put it in the net, take it off the off the hook, and you had to clean that thing thoroughly. &gt;&gt; And it'd be flopping around. It'd be you you might you might run a we used to my grandparents have a a pond on their land and me and my grandpa we'd go down there and fish and we'd bring the fish back and he we'd always take spoons and descale them that way get the scales off of them and when you're doing that it can be pretty uncomfortable and so that fish is probably going to react in a certain way. It's probably going to kick around. It's going to try and flop away from you. It's going to try and get away in whatever way it can because it's uncomfortable for it. The prophet said, he said, "How do you know that old bootleggger down here is not predestinated to life? How do you know that old street walker that you won't even speak to? How do you know that a little handshake and invite her to church wouldn't make a saint of God out of her yonder in the glory?" He said, "How do you know she's not?" He said, "That's what we don't know, but that's our duty." &gt;&gt; Another word for duty, you know what it could be? Is responsibility. It is our duty to do these things. He said like a fisherman throwed a net into the sea and pulled out. He brought frogs, fish, lizards, water spiders, and everything else, but some of them was fish. &gt;&gt; He said he didn't know he was he he just c cast a net. That's what we do. &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch Paul." And but this is it's such a day and time where people avoid responsibility in general. I'm not I'm not even talking in the Christian ranks. I'm talking about responsibility in general. If you look at statistics, how many homes are without a father because he doesn't want to have the responsibility of raising the children, &gt;&gt; don't want to do anything. We on the job, nobody pretty much my generation and younger and a little bit older than me, they don't they don't want responsibility. &gt;&gt; They don't want anything like that. They want a carefree entitled life &gt;&gt; is what they want. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's just not you're not you're not going to get anywhere in the world that way. And in church, you're not going to get anywhere that way either. &gt;&gt; Being entitled, not not adhering to God's responsibility in our lives. &gt;&gt; The definition of responsible is liable to be called on to answer. And so, I studied the psychology a little bit. I'm not a I'm not a psychology preacher or anything, but I studied the psychology of what it is, why people are so irresponsible nowadays, why people have such a problem with taking responsibility in any form or any fashion. And the number one thing was a fear of failure. It it was a fear of failing in some way or another. They don't want to put their self out there to take any responsibility for anything because they're scared that it won't work out. Sometimes we don't want to we don't want to reach out to somebody. We don't want to say a kind word of encouragement because we're scared it won't work out. &gt;&gt; The prophet said people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; They're afraid. &gt;&gt; He said we find that everywhere. And I think it's because we get it backwards sometimes. You know, we don't we don't have to answer for the message of the hour. It answers for us. We don't have to shield back the message of the hour and protect it, but it protects us. Christ protects us. He doesn't need our protection. Now, I'm all for standing on the ground, standing for what I believe, but he doesn't need me to protect him. &gt;&gt; I don't have to protect him. &gt;&gt; I don't have to fuss and quarrel and and do all these things. He will stand on his own. &gt;&gt; I just want to be standing with him. He said, "It's our duty to stand. It's God's duty to back us up. He said, "You do your part and find out if God will not do his." But sometimes we can find ourselves running from responsibility. That's exactly what Jonah did. Jonah had a message to preach. God, he was sin of God to do something. He had a purpose in his life to go, but he sherked from that responsibility to do so. And you might say, "Well, brother Josh, that was a prophet. That was a man of the scripture. That was a man in the Bible. I'm not Jonah. I don't have that responsibility. Since when? Since when do we not? You know what brother Brandham said? Let me get down to a quote. That's a that's a I'm not a Jonah type attitude or I'm not brother Brandham attitude. I I don't have to do the same things he did. I don't have to preach the same message he preached. &gt;&gt; But look at what he said right here. If I can find it. He said, "See, it'll be." He said, "But this message that I'm preaching is the true message of this day, and it's the last message." He said, "You see what I'm doing, brethren. I'm putting you all the same place that I am." Now, what does that mean? I'm putting you all the same place that I am. Now, I'm not preaching that I'm a prophet. I'm not preaching that you're a prophet. But he's putting us in the same place with the same responsibility to get this message to the people &gt;&gt; to tell to go and tell to get this message to somebody. &gt;&gt; He said because you're just as much into it as I am. &gt;&gt; He said you are messengers of this same message. &gt;&gt; We have to take possession of a statement like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You think about Joshua in chapter 18 of Joshua and he's standing there and I I believe there's seven tribes that have not yet taken possession of the promised land. And you know what Joshua does? He rebukes them directly. &gt;&gt; He says, "Why why are you slack to go over here? This is you. It's freely given to you. This is yours. You can have it." &gt;&gt; But they won't take it. They won't go across. You know, we have we have to become one with the word. We have to unite with the word. How are we ever going to unite with other brothers and sisters if we haven't even united ourselves with the word of God? &gt;&gt; How are we going to get to that point? He says, 'Now, when we find these things though, when we're confronted and come into a meeting and see the power of God moving and doing things and doing supernatural works and see it performed and look in the Bible and see that it's promised for this hour, then when we see those things and we are confronted with the responsibility to either accept it, I mean as for ourselves, he says now many people sympathize, he said many people say it's right, &gt;&gt; excuse me, but that don't make it what he said that ain't the thing you're responsible for. He said, "If I was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and there stood a girl that met every qualification that I thought it took to make a woman," he said, "why, morally, she was a queen and lovely and a fine personality, a real Christian. Everything that I could think of to make me a good wife, no matter how much I say she's perfect, she's exactly right. She isn't mine till I accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife." This message is not yours until you accept the responsibility of this message. Until you accept this message into your heart and you are willing to do what the message says. The scripture calls us not to be just hearers of the word but doers of the word to go out and do what these men of God have done in the scripture, these women of God, what they've done to take a stand how they've stood. &gt;&gt; That's the call today. &gt;&gt; That's what the message is today. He said that's the same thing the message is. You might say it's all right or this that or the other and say I sympathize with it. I believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's got to become a part of you and you a part of it. Said then it's yours. &gt;&gt; We've got to be more than just sympathizers with the word. a sympathizer when when there's a movement, when there's a political movement or whatever it may be, sympathizers, they're not one with that movement. They're not they're not really in the trenches with people that are that are in that movement, but they're kind of on the outside. &gt;&gt; And then if some if something happens or or it goes away, they're fine with leaving it. &gt;&gt; We've got to be more than just a sympathizer with this message. &gt;&gt; More than just saying, "Oh, I believe it. Oh, it's right. Oh, it sounds good." More than just sitting on a pew, &gt;&gt; but it's living a life. It's walking out there amongst everybody and letting a light shine to the world. It's being selfless. It's living for one another. He said that's what Christianity is. It's living for one another. It's not living for yourself. It's not living for selfish motive. It's not living to get rich. It's not living to have a big mansion here. We have a mansion over there. &gt;&gt; I don't need a mansion here. &gt;&gt; I'll live in it there. But while we're here, we're to sojourn. We're to pull in souls. &gt;&gt; We're to work for the Lord. And we have a responsibility as well to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a responsibility. A lot of the times we don't think of it that way. But it's a responsibility. If you've accepted this word, if you've accepted this message, that comes handinhand with it just as much as anything else does. &gt;&gt; Amen. is a responsibility to be a manifested son or daughter of God. The prophet tells us that's he he says what's everything waiting on. What's the whole creation waiting for? The manifestations of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; It's waiting for the church to become in its position. &gt;&gt; And now living with those the the attitudes of of that was for a past day. That was for brother Brandham's meetings. Jonah had that to do. That was for Jonah. That wasn't for me. Living with that attitude will never will never result in a manifested son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're short changing yourself &gt;&gt; is what you're doing &gt;&gt; because we don't have to that you know that days of miracles is past spirit. It's still very alive. &gt;&gt; It hasn't left. And I'm not just talking about the signs and the wonders and the miracles. But what that spirit did is it it said either you had to either you were past something. It said that all that was just for the apostles that were just for the ones that Jesus was talking to or it puts something off way in the future. &gt;&gt; That's what that spirit does. What that spirit does that that's an antichrist spirit meant to hold the people down so they don't come to the full revelation of who they are &gt;&gt; of who they are in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of time I' I've had people tell me that they wish they could have been in brother Brandham's meetings, and I I wish the same thing. I I'm not going to sit here and pretend like if if there was a time machine here and I could travel back and sit in a few that I wouldn't do that. But it it doesn't take that for you to be a beneficiary of God's power. &gt;&gt; You don't have to travel back to a specific spot in time. But Hebrews 13:8 tells us &gt;&gt; that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. That that power is just as much alive today as it was in those meetings. I'm not saying we're we're brother Brandham. I'm not saying we we can do exactly what he did. I'm not saying we're going to see visions. You may, but what I'm saying is that same power that was in those meetings can be the same power today. The prophet said, "This comfort is not for the seven church age messengers only." He said, "Every true believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and from his power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer." He said, "What God gives the messenger and how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of the body. 1 John 3 says, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not because it knew him not." Beloved, now we are the sons of God. Now we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in doors end doors have a purpose in life. &gt;&gt; He said something you're going to do. &gt;&gt; He said God placed you here. Do something about it. Every member of every church. &gt;&gt; Every single one of us has we have a message that'll reach somebody. The same person that would hear me out there might not be the same person that would hear you. &gt;&gt; And you might be able to reach somebody that I could never speak to my whole life. They would never hear me out. We each have a message from the preacher to the janitor to the deacon to everybody in the church. We have a message. We have a responsibility to that message. He said each one has something to say. Each one has a work. Each has a ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about that? Every person sitting in this church here this evening has a ministry of their own. &gt;&gt; They have something to do of their own. It's not just up to me to stand up here. &gt;&gt; It's not just up to Brother Joel, Brother Ben. It's not just up to preachers. It's not just up to deacons. You don't have to have a title to have a ministry. &gt;&gt; You can have a ministry at your job. &gt;&gt; You can have a ministry, young people, at your school. &gt;&gt; What a testimony that would be &gt;&gt; that you have a ministry out there and you pull people into here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we those are very simple things to think about, &gt;&gt; but I think sometimes we don't grab a hold of it as much as we should. &gt;&gt; We there God puts opportunities in our life to speak to people and we pass them by. &gt;&gt; We pass a soul by something worth 10,000 worlds. We pass by. &gt;&gt; He says God was revealed in Christ. Jehovah revealed in Christ. He said, "Now, where's God to be revealed? In his church, with his people, in us." He said, "The same spirit, the same works, the same manifestation, the same love, the same forgiveness, the same longsuffering, gentleness, patience, peace, mercy, all that was in Christ is in the church." He said, "Remember, keep this in mind. All that God was, he poured into Christ. He was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that Christ was he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; God above us, God with us, God in us. The triunity of God, God manifested in three different manners. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; but I don't want to I don't want to be one shortch changing God in my own life. &gt;&gt; If I'm to be a manifested son or daughter of God, I don't I don't want to to stop myself. I don't want to let the devil stop me. &gt;&gt; Joshua when he was standing there and the Gibeonites needed his help and he was standing in Gibian and he said he he was what went I couldn't imagine this going through my my mind to tell the son to stand still &gt;&gt; to think that I could do something like that. But what if Joshua's attitude and his mindset would have been been more along the lines of that was something for Moses actually. That was I don't know if I had the abil not not ability but I don't know if I had the uh the backing of the Lord to do that. &gt;&gt; If Moses was here, he would do it. &gt;&gt; He could do it. The Lord would hear his voice. &gt;&gt; But I'm not sure if the Lord will hear my cry. &gt;&gt; What if that was Joshua's mindset? &gt;&gt; But it wasn't. and he stood there and he said, "Son, stand still." And now he didn't say that. Uh sometimes the the preaching nowadays it sounds like we're talking about a superpower that we have that we have a that we have to use. But if you notice anytime the prophet when he spoke squirrels into existence when he did was sister Hadty, right? These things were sovereignly given. &gt;&gt; It was not a superpower. It was not something to be flashy. But he wants our character to get to a place to where he can use us in a fashion like that where he can do something. Do you think if if the Lord knew that Sister Haddie would have asked for anything else but what she did, would she have been given that opportunity or was her character in a in in such a place that he could use her in that fashion &gt;&gt; that she could be given that sovereignly in that moment? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's where we should be getting to as manifested sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; If we want to have power in the church, we have to get the character in the church right first. &gt;&gt; Because if he can't trust you with his power, he won't give it to you. &gt;&gt; And that's just the truth of it. &gt;&gt; Let me get on down here. But we have to have the revelation that we are messengers of the very same message. Not that we're not that we're a knockoff of that message. Not that we have less power than when it was initially preached. &gt;&gt; But that we are messengers of that same message. That we've been put in the exact same place. He said it. I didn't say that. But he said, "I'm putting you in the same place that I am to be a manifested son or daughter of God to reveal this thing to bring the fullness of the word to the people so that they may live how they're supposed to live. So that they don't live below their means. So that we don't we don't have to accept these things that the enemy puts in our lives." But this revelation, it brings us to a certain responsibility in the word. The prophet said, and as I'm closing here, it was short, but I'm Joel's got to preach and we got to get them somewhere. But I'll just read a few more quotes. Musicians can go ahead and come. But in a man running from the presence of the Lord, the prophet says, "And the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message." Now, he didn't just say me. He didn't say it was up to me alone, but he said the responsibility that he's given us in this day to bring this message. He said, "And as I get older and I know my days are shortening up, this should be each one of us. I feel the responsibility greater than I ever felt. He said, "Pressing on, we must do it. We must get down to it. And everywhere we go and tell the message." He said, "Everywhere we go, tell the message." And you say, "Isn't that a Isn't that a little bit too far, Brother Josh? Isn't that when I'm at when I'm at Walmart, when I'm at the gas station, you want me to be telling the message to somebody? Is any place the wrong place? Do we just got to talk about it when we're in between these four walls? &gt;&gt; Do we just feel bold with the message when we're talking to somebody else that believes it like we do or has already seen it? &gt;&gt; Or our hearts open and willing to do work for the Lord &gt;&gt; to do what he needs us to do to go and speak to who he needs us to speak to. We are his hands and his feet. If he doesn't have us, who does he have? How are [music] how are souls going to be saved? Who's going to preach this message? Who's going to tell the good news? He said, "And tell the people that Jesus Christ is coming, that he's God and he's coming soon." He said, "There's not a hope left in the world, but the coming of the Lord." He says here, "Now God kept raising up not only the messengers to each age, but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those messengers." And that's my prayer this evening. I want to be one of those wonderful helpers. Just because the prophet's off the scene, that doesn't mean that we don't have power, that we don't that we don't have responsibility in the word. And I just pray that he would make me a better helper. That he would open my heart up. That he would make me willing to speak to whoever he would have me to speak to. Whatever he would have me to do. I don't want to be reserved. I don't I don't want to hold back because we don't know if somebody would understand what we're saying. That's not our place to call. That's not our call to make. But our call is to go and tell. Our call is to pull in. It's not all about the deep things and the and the [music] mysteries and and all this and that. Those things are wonderful. Those things have a purpose, but it's about saving souls. And that may be oldfashioned. That may be back to the basics. But that's what we're supposed to go back to anyways is that blueprint that day of Pentecost experience. [music] &gt;&gt; Go back to the pattern that was originally set. And when they went out in the book of Acts, we're supposed to be a continuation of the book of Acts. And when they went out, they do you think they were scared to declare the message that they had heard? You think they were scared to talk to anybody? Because it was a lot harder then than it is now. [music] They were out for their life then. They wanted to take them off the scene then. But while while it's easy to spread the message, let's spread it. Let's talk to somebody about it. Purpose in oursel to tell somebody about the good news. Tell somebody about what pulled you up out of that myy clay. I just ask that the Lord would help me to be more selfless, to not be so worried about what people would would think or what they would say. If I had the uncction to stop and tell somebody about the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. Word that was spoken [singing] by the prophet [singing] of Malachi 4. Oh, can't you [music] see why I [music] Lord, all the revealed [singing] word that was spoken [singing] by the prophet of Malachi. Amen. Does the word make you [music] happy tonight? Let me hear you sing it. Oh, can't you sing? [music] Why I'm so happy? [singing] Have you accepted it? Well, I've accepted [music] the word [singing] of the Lord. All the revealed [music] word that was spoken [singing] by the prophet of Malachi 4. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight. Amen. That ought to make us happy. [applause] Amen. And with the message came with the message came a lot of responsibility. But aren't you glad that he had a people prepared to take on [music] that responsibility. Amen. He didn't leave his he didn't leave his church uh without a people. He never he doesn't leave his uh he doesn't leave he doesn't leave the world without a witness. And he doesn't leave a mean the [music] church without a body. Amen. Because in his absence we have a body and we have a voice. [music] And we're thankful that we don't preach our own thoughts. We don't preach our own message, [music] but we preach just what a prophet said. We believe everything he said. How about you? Aren't you thankful for it? That's why we have a responsibility to say only what he said. We don't come up with new doctrines and ideas. Many men have tried it. Amen. But aren't you glad that we have a vindicated prophet. So thoroughly vindicated, we don't have to wonder, was he a prophet? Was he not a prophet? Was he right? No, we just believe what he said. Not because of who he was or the miracles he did, but he's a word prophet. [music] We can find him in the scriptures. And then after you find him in the scriptures, his word will place you [music] in the scriptures. And then when you can see yourself, you can see the same power. I wish somebody I tell you what, I wish I could preach now. Amen. I That was good. I enjoyed that. I enjoyed that. Amen. We have a responsibility to carry this message. But we're not going to let nobody take it from us or try to come in and and interpret in a different ways. No, it's already been interpreted. It's already been thoroughly vindicated. All we got to do is believe it and then act on it. Amen. It's more that like the preacher said tonight and we don't just hear it. Although we do have to be hearing it. [music] Somebody ought to say amen on that. I mean, it ain't good enough to just say, "Well, I'll let the preacher break it down." No, you need to be hearing this. And your brother said, "I'm storing up food so that you'll have something to eat." And he also [music] told us, he said, "You can sit in the cool of your home and hear these tapes." He had a reason for it. It was long sometimes, but you can sit there with your Bible and in your study and get along with God. Amen. He can reveal things to you. And then when you got a man in the pulpit saying the same things, you'll go hear it the same thing in church. And you know, that's when you know, hey, I'm not just following another preacher, but we're hearing the word in our home. And I tell you what, I think it's important to be hearing the tapes. It's [music] important to be reading your Bibles and praying every day. I believe all these things are so important to us. Amen. We have a responsibility. Amen. I I say let's just take a hold of the responsibility as men and women. Don't sherk our responsibilities, but let's just hold on to [music] this message. Amen. With everything that's in us and and I'll tell you what, uh if you heard what he said tonight, Amen. Don't just go out of here and say, "Well, it was just another good sermon." No, let's do better. Let's do better on Monday morning. If you hadn't read your Bible in a while, get up on Monday morning and make it a start. If you haven't if you haven't [music] listened to a tape in your home in a while, I say it's a good day to do it. Amen. It won't hurt nobody to hear some more tapes. [music] Amen. We sure love Amen. If you love the message of the hour, I mean, it'll do something for you. When you [music] hear this message, it'll just do something for you. You don't fall in love with the messenger. Although we love the messenger, but when you hear that message, you start seeing yourself. Remember, Eleazar was to just [music] present a bride to Isaac. You didn't Rebecca didn't fall in love with Eleaser. She fell in love with Isaac. Brother Brandon was to present you to Christ and he was to present. Amen. He wanted you to fall in love with him. And I tell you what, I think we can do that tonight with what you heard. Amen. It was simple. It was short. And I tell you what, a donkey couldn't have done no better. Amen. You did a good job, buddy. Amen. Did you enjoy the word of the Lord tonight? Go ahead and give the Lord praise. [applause] The word of [singing] the Lord.
