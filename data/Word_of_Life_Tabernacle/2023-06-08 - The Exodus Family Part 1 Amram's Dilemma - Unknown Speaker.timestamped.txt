[40:46] to Exodus a little bit uh this this
[40:49] evening and I may continue this if the
[40:53] Lord leaves that way maybe in the future
[40:55] on a Wednesday night but let's take this
[40:57] just tonight and like to call this
[40:59] amram's dilemma amram's dilemma Exodus 6
[41:03] 20 and amram took him djokabed his
[41:07] father's sister to life and she bear him
[41:09] Aaron and Moses and the years of the
[41:12] life of amram were
[41:14] 137 years I pray the Lord without his
[41:17] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[41:22] a dilemma
[41:23] is a choice that must be made between
[41:26] two equally difficult things I heard a
[41:30] story about two Hunters that were
[41:32] hunting and they run across a bear that
[41:34] was so big that they just dropped their
[41:36] rifles and ran and so they ran out to
[41:39] the uh to a place where there was a tree
[41:42] in a cave and one of the hunters ran up
[41:44] the tree climbed the tree the other one
[41:46] ran in the cave and the bear just sat
[41:48] down between them because he couldn't
[41:50] believe his good luck he wasn't that
[41:52] hungry yet so he's sitting there in the
[41:54] middle and and the hunter ones up the
[41:57] tree another was in the cave pretty soon
[41:59] here comes the one out of the cave
[42:00] running as hard as he can and he runs
[42:03] almost runs into the bear and the guy up
[42:05] the trees yelling at him go back in the
[42:06] cave go back in the cave and he goes
[42:08] back in the cave pretty soon here he
[42:10] comes out again just hard as he can go
[42:12] and the man said what are you doing how
[42:14] foolish can you be go back in the cave
[42:16] he the Bear's going to eat you he said
[42:18] well there's one in there too
[42:22] well and that's just about the way the
[42:24] world is today
[42:26] it's a dilemma it seems like every time
[42:28] you won't go to make a choice for God
[42:30] there's a it seems like it causes
[42:32] something in some other area there's
[42:34] trouble that begins and every time you
[42:36] try to do follow the word there's
[42:38] trouble that happens and yet we know to
[42:41] follow the word is the right thing to do
[42:43] but yet it's hard because it seems like
[42:45] no matter what you do you either you're
[42:48] either going to live under condemnation
[42:49] or you make the devil mad at you well I
[42:51] tell you what I'd rather have the devil
[42:53] mad at me tonight than live under
[42:54] condemnation
[42:56] but but we're living in a in a hard time
[42:59] it's a time of dilemma and there's
[43:01] always dilemma before Deliverance
[43:03] there's always it's always a choice to
[43:05] be made before Deliverance we're living
[43:07] in the time of the Third Exodus how many
[43:10] know that tonight the Third Exodus the
[43:12] first Exodus was a people that were
[43:15] coming out of a pagan Land by a
[43:17] Vindicated Prophet with a pillar of fire
[43:19] it was complete Redemption going out of
[43:22] Egypt coming into Canaan going out and
[43:24] coming in the second Exodus was in Jesus
[43:27] time where people were brought out of
[43:29] traditions of the fathers by Vindicated
[43:31] God Prophet who was the pillar of fire
[43:34] he was the pillar of fire going out of
[43:37] Law and into Grace under Paul's Ministry
[43:40] and now we have a Third Exodus a Third
[43:43] Exodus which brought a people out of the
[43:45] bondage of denominations and Creeds by a
[43:48] Vindicated profit with the pillar of
[43:49] fire back in the church again coming out
[43:52] of the world order coming out of
[43:54] denominationalism coming out of of
[43:56] Creeds and going into the rapture
[44:00] so this is the Third Exodus and so it is
[44:03] a time of dilemma it's a time of trouble
[44:06] but it's in that time of trouble that he
[44:09] hides Us in the secret of the Rapture
[44:11] amen that's what we've been taught now
[44:13] the the Third Exodus is this time of
[44:16] trouble and brother Branham taught us
[44:18] that and I've got many quotes to back
[44:20] this up but I'm trying to get through it
[44:21] in an order tonight where I don't hold
[44:23] you all night so I'm just kind of
[44:25] paraphrasing but he taught us that the
[44:27] very same things that he did in the
[44:29] natural he's anti-typing that today in a
[44:32] spiritual Exodus so so today is the
[44:35] anti-type in other words today it's the
[44:37] real thing the Exodus was a type of
[44:39] today and so the conditions present at
[44:42] Exodus both at The Exodus in the Old
[44:45] Testament The Exodus in the New
[44:46] Testament the same today
[44:49] and so you look at that society and you
[44:51] look at what it was and and the kind of
[44:54] people that they were that was a pagan
[44:56] society and I think we understand today
[44:59] that this is a pagan Society
[45:01] and it's a time of of trouble it's a
[45:05] time of uh when when Society is turned
[45:07] against God and they'd rejected God the
[45:10] people who once knew God
[45:12] and there was once a pharaoh who knew
[45:14] Joseph but now there was coming one who
[45:16] didn't and so we live in that kind of of
[45:19] a society America rejected God in 1956
[45:23] they rejected their visitation the
[45:26] nominal Church put him outside and you
[45:28] find him in Revelation chapter 3
[45:30] knocking on the door trying to get back
[45:33] in
[45:34] and so to the nominal church he he's
[45:36] seen knocking at the door but they
[45:38] refused to open and a prophet of God
[45:40] stood under the indictment and he said I
[45:42] indict this generation in the name of
[45:44] Jesus Christ under the authority of
[45:46] God's word for he said you're crucifying
[45:49] him again
[45:51] and so it's the very same time as it was
[45:53] in the first Exodus it was like this in
[45:55] Exodus 1 8 it said now there arose up a
[45:57] new king over Egypt which knew not
[46:00] Joseph
[46:02] so so this is the time that we're living
[46:05] in so we're living under an economy
[46:08] under a political situation that doesn't
[46:11] know God
[46:12] I had become an antichrist system an
[46:16] anti-god system look at the world today
[46:18] you you just have to look around a
[46:20] little bit and you realize that's where
[46:22] we're living
[46:24] and brother Branham said when they there
[46:26] come time for the promise to be
[46:27] fulfilled they raised up a pharaoh who
[46:30] knew not Joseph so if there's a system
[46:32] today that doesn't know God there must
[46:35] be a promise to be fulfilled in our day
[46:38] amen so now he said they they didn't
[46:42] know Joseph and they said they begin a
[46:44] persecution and it caused in the
[46:46] persecution that caused the people to go
[46:48] to crowding together and praying
[46:51] oh I love that it caused the people to
[46:53] go crowding together not not going off
[46:55] all by themselves and sitting in their
[46:58] own homes and and just trying to hide
[47:00] but they caused them to crowd together
[47:01] and pray he said an always persecution
[47:05] strengthens the cause
[47:08] oh my that's hard for us to understand
[47:10] but it's true persecution strengthens
[47:13] the cause many of our troubles is not
[47:16] because of persecution but it's because
[47:18] of soft living he said well my life's
[47:19] not soft but listen there is a pressure
[47:21] on this age but the pressure is there
[47:23] for a reason it's there for a reason
[47:26] it's what we do with it that's what
[47:28] matters
[47:28] right it's what what choice we make in
[47:31] the Dilemma
[47:33] and every one of us has to face up to
[47:36] that today we can't be like Jonah and
[47:38] run from the presence of the Lord we've
[47:39] got to stand there and face our dilemma
[47:42] what am I going to believe how am I
[47:43] going to leave my family how am I going
[47:45] to work for God
[47:46] am I going to go to church or not am I
[47:49] going to live for God or not am I going
[47:51] to be a real believer or not am I really
[47:54] going to follow the message of the hour
[47:55] or am I going to just hang on
[47:58] and kind of sit on the outside
[48:00] wait on the edges I want to challenge
[48:03] you tonight to surrender it all give it
[48:05] all to him
[48:06] in your time of dilemma this is the hour
[48:09] to be more uh more uh faithful than
[48:12] you've ever been this is the hour to
[48:14] come down to a place where you you make
[48:16] the right decisions
[48:18] by the help of the Lord
[48:20] so he said brother Ben we're not under
[48:22] persecution or we are
[48:25] a prophet taught
[48:27] that the greatest persecution that was
[48:31] the Roman spirit and he said it was it
[48:34] was an in a natural way that that's
[48:36] Roman Spirit those 200 million demons in
[48:39] the Euphrates River were released into
[48:42] the Earth you remember the in Revelation
[48:44] and he said in a natural way they were
[48:47] released on Hitler and Eichmann but in a
[48:50] spiritual way they were released on the
[48:51] bride
[48:53] no they weren't after the nominal church
[48:55] after the bride
[48:56] but he said they won't they won't have a
[48:59] persecution in the way of closing up
[49:00] churches that's what he taught us he
[49:03] said before they can close us up he'll
[49:04] take us up
[49:06] but he said it won't be that way because
[49:08] he said God doesn't put his bride
[49:10] through those things
[49:11] but he said there would be a persecution
[49:14] in this way and this is the way he
[49:16] phrases it and feast of trumpet so many
[49:18] people miss this
[49:19] he said notice there she is
[49:22] now she's loosed that Spirit those those
[49:25] demons the same spirits that were loosed
[49:28] on Hitler and Iman to kill the Jews
[49:30] she's loose to call all these little
[49:32] Loose Ends
[49:34] oh well don't make any difference anyhow
[49:38] in Satan's Eden he does the same thing
[49:41] he did in Eden to begin with and he
[49:44] comes to the bride and he says things it
[49:46] don't matter the little things don't
[49:48] matter it don't matter whether you live
[49:50] as a Christian or not but listen there's
[49:52] a bride on the Earth today that's
[49:54] already been sealed away God already got
[49:56] to her before Satan could
[49:58] that's why we've been married to Christ
[50:00] the word aren't you glad for that today
[50:03] oh my now so she's loose so don't think
[50:06] you say well the the political party's
[50:09] gonna uh going to persecute us and they
[50:11] may but I'll say our greatest
[50:13] persecution is these little Loose Ends
[50:16] he comes and Whispers in your ears said
[50:17] it doesn't matter
[50:19] now hang with me for a moment
[50:23] in the first Exodus the political and
[50:26] economic system was specifically
[50:29] manipulated to hinder Israel from
[50:33] fulfilling the word for their hour
[50:36] you want to talk about conspiracy
[50:38] theories
[50:40] they were sitting there saying what are
[50:42] we going to do to keep Israel from
[50:45] getting stronger
[50:47] in the quarters of power of that day
[50:49] they were actually sitting there
[50:52] thinking like that
[50:54] don't tell me they're not today
[50:57] how can we keep these people from
[51:00] becoming stronger now now watch they uh
[51:04] he he talked about it and and how that
[51:07] in in Genesis 15 13 The Promise was made
[51:09] that he said unto Abram Novus surgery
[51:12] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[51:14] land that's not theirs and Shall Serve
[51:15] them they shall afflict them 400 years
[51:18] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[51:20] Serve will I judge and afterwards shall
[51:22] they come out with great substance that
[51:24] was a promise to them
[51:26] it was a promise they had and the time
[51:28] the Clock Was ticking and Satan knew
[51:31] that
[51:32] and so he inspired the political system
[51:34] to go against the people of God
[51:37] and in Exodus 1 9 he said hey this is
[51:40] Pharaoh speaking now he said unto his
[51:41] people behold the people of the children
[51:43] of Israel are more and mightier than we
[51:47] now brother Brown said they would have
[51:48] 14 kids every every one of the Egyptians
[51:52] he said God was doing something I don't
[51:54] say we're multiplying like that although
[51:56] some of us are trying but
[51:58] I don't say we're multiplying like that
[52:00] but Jeremy but we are multiplying when
[52:03] it comes to the power of God and the
[52:04] grace of God and the peace of God and
[52:07] there's been things multiplied in our
[52:09] lives we're becoming stronger
[52:12] and in verse 10 it says come on he said
[52:14] let us deal wisely with them
[52:17] lest they multiply and it come to pass
[52:19] it when they falleth out any War they
[52:21] join also unto our enemies and fight
[52:23] against us and so get them up out of the
[52:26] land
[52:27] so it was a conspiracy to weaken the
[52:30] church
[52:32] by weakening the home
[52:36] now I want to tell you that same
[52:37] conspiracy is alive and well tonight
[52:40] it's a conspiracy to weaken the church
[52:43] by weakening the home because the church
[52:46] can't be any stronger than the home is
[52:50] you realize our meetings that we have
[52:52] when the spirit of God moves and the
[52:54] power of God it starts at home
[52:58] yeah
[52:59] our services that we have on Sundays and
[53:02] Wednesdays that we love to feel the
[53:04] presence of God it starts at home it
[53:06] starts at my home and your home
[53:09] and so he cannot weaken the church
[53:12] without weakening the home
[53:14] so what he does is he goes to the home
[53:16] and he begins to put pressure on the
[53:19] home life of the people and don't tell
[53:21] me you don't deal with pressure I know
[53:23] you do because I've been in the
[53:24] workforce I know what it's like
[53:26] I've been right there with you I know
[53:27] how hard it is sometimes to get yourself
[53:29] together on a Wednesday night
[53:31] and come to the house of God I know how
[53:33] difficult that is
[53:35] I've been there I know what it's like to
[53:37] not want to go to church
[53:40] sometimes I don't want to go to church
[53:42] my wife has to remind me I'm the pastor
[53:47] but but that's it's just the age we live
[53:49] in there's a pressure on this age
[53:51] and you don't feel that pressure doing
[53:53] anything else
[53:54] you can go on vacation you can go you
[53:57] can go do whatever else and yeah there's
[53:59] pressure there but it's not like it is
[54:00] when it comes to doing something for God
[54:02] when you go to doing something for God
[54:04] whether that's playing the piano or
[54:05] playing the organ or playing an
[54:07] instrument or preaching or or sitting in
[54:09] the service on a Wednesday night when
[54:11] you go to do something for God the
[54:13] pressure is going to go up don't you
[54:15] realize it is a conspiracy against youth
[54:19] but you have been specifically picked in
[54:22] this hour to overcome that you have
[54:25] you have you young people have been
[54:28] specifically picked in this hour to
[54:30] overcome in laodicea you and you Elders
[54:33] have been specifically picked you you
[54:35] married couples you've been specifically
[54:37] picked you moms and dads have been
[54:39] specifically picked
[54:41] for this hour
[54:44] even though the pressure's on you've
[54:46] been pitched
[54:48] and you're in a title dilemma but you
[54:50] were made for that dilemma
[54:53] amen
[54:55] now he says let's let's
[54:59] see what we can do to get them put them
[55:00] to work
[55:03] Exodus 111.
[55:05] therefore they did set over them task
[55:07] Masters to afflict them with their
[55:09] burdens
[55:10] that's where middle management started
[55:14] y'all
[55:19] HR started back in Egypt
[55:23] and some of y'all know what I'm talking
[55:24] about
[55:25] to afflict them with their burdens
[55:29] they had guys out there whose sole
[55:30] purpose was to afflict
[55:33] the children of Israel to make their job
[55:36] hard
[55:39] and they built for Pharaoh treasure
[55:41] cities ptham and Ramses
[55:44] I love this but the more they Afflicted
[55:47] them
[55:48] the more they emulsified and grew
[55:52] and they were grieved because of the
[55:54] children of Israel
[55:56] why they were a threat to their system
[56:00] the same thing was happening in Israel
[56:02] when Jesus was born it says that it came
[56:05] to pass in those days that there went
[56:06] out a decree from Caesar Augustus that
[56:09] all the world should be taxed
[56:11] it was a conspiracy to try to drive the
[56:15] people of God but I love how God works
[56:17] because he actually knowing that this
[56:20] would happen use the conspiracy to how
[56:23] have Jesus to cause Jesus to be born in
[56:26] Bethlehem fulfilling his own word oh my
[56:29] don't you realize it's all in the hands
[56:31] of God today you'll actually use the
[56:34] pressure of the eighth he'll actually
[56:36] use the things that you're going through
[56:37] in life he'll use that to actually bring
[56:40] life to you bring bring put power in
[56:43] your life he'll use that to build a
[56:45] character in you
[56:47] he'll arrange things so that it's for
[56:49] your good
[56:55] my goodness
[57:00] the Egyptian and Roman systems
[57:03] made it nearly impossible
[57:05] for the people to fulfill their
[57:07] obligations to God and to the state
[57:12] I'm going to be very plain tonight
[57:13] that's the hour we're living in
[57:16] they made it hard
[57:19] for the people to fulfill their
[57:20] obligations to God and to the state
[57:24] and yet God used that system
[57:27] to fulfill his word
[57:31] so he's not going to necessarily pull
[57:33] you out of it but he causes Deliverance
[57:35] to take place within that system in
[57:39] spite of the conspiracy
[57:41] Hallelujah in spite of a conspiracy of
[57:44] kings and Emperors and demons and
[57:47] everything else in spite of a conspiracy
[57:49] of the Roman system the word was still
[57:51] born in Judea a deliverer was still born
[57:55] in Goshen and there's a people of God
[57:57] that are still alive today still working
[57:59] still doing what God called them to do
[58:01] in spite of the pressure of the age
[58:03] we're still here why are we still here
[58:06] because we God is actually using it for
[58:09] his own purpose
[58:11] Satan knows oh I hope I wish some of us
[58:16] would get a revelation as good a
[58:18] revelation about ourselves as Satan has
[58:20] about us
[58:22] because Satan knew that God's people
[58:25] just living
[58:27] just going about their daily work
[58:30] were a threat
[58:32] to their system
[58:36] oh my Satan knows that you going to
[58:40] school you going to church you living
[58:42] for God you being a Christian in your
[58:44] neighborhood you being who you are
[58:46] brother Paul Satan knows you're a threat
[58:49] he knows you're a threat and so they try
[58:51] to do everything they can to work it out
[58:53] where you can't make it he'll make it as
[58:56] hard as he can be but if you could get
[58:57] that same Revelation about yourself he
[59:00] knows you're a threat do you realize
[59:02] you're a threat do you realize because
[59:04] what that means is you have an
[59:06] overcoming ability you have an ability
[59:08] to work for God you have an ability to
[59:10] do things you never dreamed you could do
[59:11] you can show up for church when you
[59:13] think you can't
[59:18] oh my
[59:19] you can live for God
[59:22] when you think you can
[59:25] when the birds pile on top of you
[59:28] and the Taskmaster standing over you
[59:30] telling you you can't make it you're not
[59:33] going to make it it's not good enough
[59:34] when the bills start piling up but
[59:36] you're trying to live for God do things
[59:38] in a Biblical way but the bills are
[59:39] piling up and you don't see any end out
[59:41] any end in sight yeah you know there's
[59:43] always light at the end of the tunnel
[59:45] why because he put you here he did not
[59:47] put you here to fail he did not put you
[59:49] here to back up he put you here to be a
[59:51] Christian
[59:52] so there must be a reason
[59:54] for what you're going through
[1:00:00] so in that light
[1:00:04] that you just being what you are
[1:00:07] being a Christian being a mother being a
[1:00:09] father being a husband being a dad
[1:00:13] being a spouse a wife
[1:00:16] just you being that in a Biblical way
[1:00:19] is a threat to Satan and his system
[1:00:22] and so knowing that
[1:00:24] knowing that then we as we begin to look
[1:00:27] into this I want to look tonight and
[1:00:28] we'll look later at different parts of
[1:00:30] the family I want to look tonight at the
[1:00:32] man specifically amram because we know
[1:00:36] that imram had to work under this system
[1:00:39] to be able to make it in that hour
[1:00:42] and we know that after the fall men and
[1:00:44] women were given separate covenants and
[1:00:47] this was a Works Covenant now this
[1:00:48] doesn't have to do with Grace we were
[1:00:50] given another Covenant which is Grace
[1:00:52] which means that we don't work our way
[1:00:54] to Salvation
[1:00:56] in other words you could be a bum and
[1:00:58] still be saved
[1:01:00] but because you are saved
[1:01:02] you aren't a bum
[1:01:04] that makes sense
[1:01:08] so so now I'm not preaching at you
[1:01:10] Jeremy I'm
[1:01:15] that's the problem with a small Church
[1:01:16] isn't it
[1:01:19] but but you could be a bum right that
[1:01:22] had nothing to do with your salvation
[1:01:23] but the holy spirit inside of you makes
[1:01:26] you makes you work
[1:01:27] because that's a man's calling
[1:01:30] right
[1:01:33] I hate it as much as you do but it's
[1:01:34] just the way it is
[1:01:36] Genesis 3 17 unto Adam he said because
[1:01:38] you've hearkened the voice of thy wife
[1:01:40] that's eaten of the tree which a
[1:01:41] commanded he's saying thou shall not eat
[1:01:42] them it cursed into the ground for that
[1:01:43] I say in sorrow thou should either but
[1:01:45] all the days of thy life the horns also
[1:01:47] in this one shall it bring forth to thee
[1:01:48] Thou shalt eat the herb of the field in
[1:01:50] the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:01:52] bread oh no
[1:01:55] I think that's why he makes preaching so
[1:01:57] hard on us brother Joel
[1:02:00] you stand up here and I I we talk about
[1:02:02] being hard and I feel bad about that
[1:02:04] even because some of you come in on a
[1:02:05] Wednesday night you've been Beat to
[1:02:06] Death all day either mentally or
[1:02:09] physically and we come up here and say
[1:02:10] preaching is hard and you're like speak
[1:02:12] for yourself
[1:02:16] I realized that
[1:02:20] I try to get up in the mornings at an
[1:02:22] early time even when I wouldn't have to
[1:02:23] some days because I try to get up
[1:02:25] because I I recognize that y'all are
[1:02:27] getting up and I'll pray for you while
[1:02:29] you go out and work but but I'll say
[1:02:32] this that that it's in the sweat of your
[1:02:34] face no matter what you do lazy preacher
[1:02:36] is no more successful than a lazy
[1:02:37] businessman
[1:02:39] right because you still got to work
[1:02:42] he said you're going to do that
[1:02:45] say till you retire well no
[1:02:48] till thou return unto the ground
[1:02:51] but the Harvey's keeping that that
[1:02:53] scripture alive
[1:02:54] for out of it was thou taken for dust
[1:02:57] Thou Art and unto dust shout thou return
[1:03:00] now so this was we've talked about this
[1:03:03] before it's it's work and what made it
[1:03:05] bad was after the fall they had worked
[1:03:07] before the fall but the random taught us
[1:03:08] that but after the fall it became
[1:03:10] anxious work
[1:03:12] work with worry
[1:03:14] work because you had to work to make a
[1:03:16] living to survive
[1:03:19] right so again it's not it doesn't save
[1:03:22] a man but it's required of him
[1:03:24] the Bible says he talks about a man who
[1:03:27] refuses to work and even when we were
[1:03:29] with you this we commanded of you that
[1:03:30] if any would not work neither should he
[1:03:32] eat
[1:03:33] well that I'm gonna work
[1:03:36] for we hear that there are some which
[1:03:38] walk among you disorderly working not at
[1:03:40] all but are busy Buddies
[1:03:41] now them that are such we command and
[1:03:43] exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:03:45] with quietness they work and eat their
[1:03:47] own bread with quietness they work and
[1:03:50] eat their own bread so he teaches us to
[1:03:53] work now he teaches us also in in
[1:03:55] Ephesians 4 28 work so that we're able
[1:03:58] to give
[1:03:59] how many want to be a giver
[1:04:02] not just to to the church or something
[1:04:04] like that but to people in general just
[1:04:06] where you can be a giver so he teaches
[1:04:08] us to work to be a giver Ephesians 4 28
[1:04:10] let him to stole still no more but
[1:04:12] rather let him labor working with his
[1:04:14] hands the thing which is good that he
[1:04:16] may have to give to him that needeth
[1:04:19] he taught us to work for our bosses much
[1:04:21] as we hate that middle management but
[1:04:23] but he taught us to do that servants he
[1:04:25] said obeying all things your Masters
[1:04:27] according to the flesh not with ice
[1:04:29] service that's men's Pleasers but in
[1:04:31] singleness of heart fearing God
[1:04:35] and and he said whatever you do whatever
[1:04:37] you do whether you're a ditch digging or
[1:04:40] or moving dirt as Peter's been doing or
[1:04:43] did yesterday and I seem like the
[1:04:45] hardest job in the world but if you're
[1:04:46] moving dirt or you're digging ditches or
[1:04:48] you're weed eating or or you're working
[1:04:50] in a car on a car lot or whether you're
[1:04:52] painting houses or whatever it is that
[1:04:54] you're doing whether you're alignment
[1:04:55] whether you're whether whether whatever
[1:04:57] it is that you're doing whatever you do
[1:04:59] if you're on vacation this week
[1:05:01] do it heartily
[1:05:04] as unto the Lord and not to men
[1:05:08] right knowing that of the Lord you shall
[1:05:10] receive the reward I love this of the
[1:05:13] inheritance
[1:05:14] because I don't get rewarded much at
[1:05:16] work and I never did thought they paid
[1:05:17] me what I was worth you know no matter
[1:05:19] where I work but but I'll tell you this
[1:05:20] there's somebody who's going to pay you
[1:05:22] what's your worth
[1:05:24] there's coming an inheritance that's
[1:05:26] going to give you what you're worth and
[1:05:27] that our inheritance on the other side
[1:05:29] of course he said for you serve the Lord
[1:05:32] Christ's work he taught us as a form of
[1:05:34] Brotherly Love
[1:05:36] you never thought about that did you
[1:05:37] it's a form of Brotherly Love because we
[1:05:39] don't have if we don't work we don't
[1:05:41] have to give and then giving is a form
[1:05:43] of Brotherly Love in first Thessalonians
[1:05:45] 4 9 that's touching brotherly love you
[1:05:46] need nothing to write unto you for ye
[1:05:48] yourselves are taught of God to love one
[1:05:50] another and indeed you do it toward all
[1:05:52] the Brethren which are in all Macedonia
[1:05:54] but we beseech you Brethren that you
[1:05:56] increase more and more and that you
[1:05:58] study to be quiet and to do your own
[1:06:00] business and to work with your own hands
[1:06:02] as we commanded you that you make walk
[1:06:05] honestly toward them with that or
[1:06:06] without so he's saying your your work
[1:06:08] will cause you to be able to live in an
[1:06:09] honest manner
[1:06:11] so you're not have to steal from people
[1:06:13] to make it
[1:06:15] right and that gives a testimony to them
[1:06:17] that are without you're actually loving
[1:06:19] your brother
[1:06:20] by just making a living for yourself
[1:06:24] you ever thought about it like that I'm
[1:06:27] going to work I'm loving my brother
[1:06:30] and I realize again a woman whether she
[1:06:33] works or not if she works in the public
[1:06:35] a woman has two jobs because she's
[1:06:37] working at home and she's working in the
[1:06:39] public and maybe we'll get to that next
[1:06:41] time but I I'll say if you do that and
[1:06:43] hold yourself right I I honor you in
[1:06:46] that because because in this age that's
[1:06:48] difficult to do
[1:06:50] and I think all of us would want our
[1:06:52] wives to be able to be at home if
[1:06:54] possible if everything was just the way
[1:06:55] that it ought to be and we'd go out and
[1:06:58] and be the He-Man and take care of that
[1:07:00] that's because we're built that way it's
[1:07:01] the way it's supposed to be but yet uh
[1:07:04] yet there's situations that come up
[1:07:06] where they can't do that but whatever it
[1:07:08] is that you do you're working you're
[1:07:10] working to to have an honest living so
[1:07:13] that you're not begging from everybody
[1:07:16] are you with me now
[1:07:18] that you may have lack of nothing
[1:07:22] so you're supposed to work
[1:07:24] for money
[1:07:25] it's okay we're not communist right well
[1:07:28] you didn't think you'd come to church
[1:07:29] tonight and hear this did you but we're
[1:07:31] getting to something
[1:07:32] First Timothy 5 and 8 but if any provide
[1:07:34] not for his own especially for those of
[1:07:37] his own house he has denied the faith
[1:07:38] and is worse than an infidel
[1:07:41] God didn't invent this this modern idea
[1:07:44] of a man sitting at home and changing a
[1:07:47] diaper now and then and sitting at home
[1:07:49] while his wife has a career and goes out
[1:07:50] to work God did not invent that that's
[1:07:53] man's invention
[1:07:55] and I recognize when I say that
[1:07:57] sometimes a man can't work a physically
[1:07:59] unable to work but there's a lot of them
[1:08:00] out there today not working when they
[1:08:02] could be
[1:08:04] it's hard to find one today that wants
[1:08:06] to work why because that people don't
[1:08:08] realize it but it's actually perversion
[1:08:10] has slipped into our age until a man
[1:08:13] don't want to pick up a hammer anymore
[1:08:14] man don't want to pick up a shovel
[1:08:16] anymore I hope you're with me tonight
[1:08:18] again I hate it just like you do but
[1:08:20] it's part of our job it's part of what
[1:08:22] we do
[1:08:25] and it's my job to take care of my
[1:08:27] family
[1:08:29] and always will be no matter what no
[1:08:31] matter how much money she makes
[1:08:33] still my job take care of my family
[1:08:38] but see you see what Satan does
[1:08:40] you're going to be a people
[1:08:43] I hope you I'm I'm Amazed by the people
[1:08:45] I preach to all the time
[1:08:47] because you are a people who are going
[1:08:50] to manifest all of the word
[1:08:52] not just part of it all of the word
[1:08:55] you're going to manifest all of the word
[1:08:57] first Timothy 5 8 you're going to
[1:08:59] manifest you're going to be a perfect
[1:09:00] word Brian you're a people of God who
[1:09:03] are called to manifest all of the word
[1:09:05] and so see Satan many times we think
[1:09:08] well Satan battles Us in in Supernatural
[1:09:10] Realms and meetings and things like that
[1:09:12] but don't you realize he's already
[1:09:13] fighting at home he's fighting trying to
[1:09:16] keep you tired he's fighting trying to
[1:09:18] keep you wore out he's fighting trying
[1:09:20] to keep you buying things you don't need
[1:09:24] you don't you think he's fighting
[1:09:26] constantly fighting
[1:09:28] to keep you in a place where you don't
[1:09:30] have time to care for your family you
[1:09:32] don't have time to care for their
[1:09:34] spiritual needs you don't have time to
[1:09:35] care for their natural needs
[1:09:38] fighting constantly to keep us busy
[1:09:41] oh my
[1:09:43] God it's the God of this evil age doing
[1:09:45] that
[1:09:46] and as The Exodus came more into Focus
[1:09:49] as it came nearer the work became more
[1:09:51] difficult
[1:09:52] in Exodus 5 and 4 the king of Egypt said
[1:09:55] unto them wherefore do you Moses and
[1:09:57] Aaron let the people from their Works
[1:09:58] get you unto your burdens
[1:10:01] get you into your burdens
[1:10:03] what are you doing we're having a
[1:10:04] meeting get to your burdens
[1:10:06] and then how the boss acts sometimes
[1:10:09] what do you mean you want to be in
[1:10:10] church on Wednesdays get to your burdens
[1:10:14] boy got quiet
[1:10:17] huh but I believe I'll say this I
[1:10:19] believe every person that here in this
[1:10:21] church I I know all of you and some
[1:10:23] better than others but I know you want
[1:10:25] to be in the house of God
[1:10:26] I know you want to be in the house of
[1:10:28] God those who aren't here tonight I know
[1:10:29] you want to be in the house of God and
[1:10:30] you strive and you struggle to be in the
[1:10:32] house of God
[1:10:33] and yet many times Pharaoh's standing
[1:10:35] there said get back to your burden get
[1:10:38] back to your burden and you've got to
[1:10:40] live in that land you face a dilemma
[1:10:42] what are you gonna do
[1:10:44] verse five Pharaoh said behold the
[1:10:46] people the land now are many you make
[1:10:47] them rest from their burdens
[1:10:49] and Pharaoh commanded the same day the
[1:10:51] task masters of the people and their
[1:10:53] officers saying you shall no more give
[1:10:54] the people straw to make brick as
[1:10:56] heretofore let them go and gather straw
[1:10:59] for themselves let's separate the money
[1:11:01] from the gold standard and let's offer
[1:11:03] them credit cards
[1:11:07] I'm not preaching against credit cards
[1:11:08] I'm just telling you what the devil's
[1:11:10] done in our day
[1:11:12] let's let them go and gather straw for
[1:11:14] themselves
[1:11:15] and the tale of the bricks which they
[1:11:17] didn't make here too far you shall lay
[1:11:19] upon them so they dealt with inflation
[1:11:21] said You shall not diminish ought
[1:11:23] thereof for they be idle therefore they
[1:11:25] cry saying let us go and sacrifice to
[1:11:27] our God
[1:11:29] can you imagine how this made a Godly
[1:11:31] Man like Abraham feel
[1:11:34] as the pressure to work begin to
[1:11:36] increase
[1:11:37] and the entire political system was
[1:11:40] against his family operating the way it
[1:11:42] was supposed to
[1:11:44] oh my
[1:11:45] as I said a dilemma is a choice that
[1:11:47] must be made between two equally
[1:11:49] difficult things would he work or pray
[1:11:51] it was a real dilemma
[1:11:54] did both
[1:11:58] brother Brown tells the story how
[1:11:59] Abraham come home he told the little
[1:12:01] drama of it Abraham come home and told
[1:12:03] the boy he told his wife he said I'm
[1:12:05] just so tired today I just feel like
[1:12:07] dying I'm not able to go another day he
[1:12:10] goes up and sleeps for a few you've come
[1:12:11] home like that before I'm sure you've
[1:12:13] come home from work I've come home some
[1:12:15] days wishing I could get fired
[1:12:19] not for me well yeah
[1:12:22] back when I was in the workforce
[1:12:25] come on wishing I could get fired you
[1:12:28] had a hard day
[1:12:30] and yeah
[1:12:32] yeah come home in that situation he felt
[1:12:34] like I'm not worried it's not worth
[1:12:35] living anymore all I do is work
[1:12:38] and he'd come and he went and slept for
[1:12:40] a few hours to come back down and said
[1:12:41] you're not gonna believe what I saw I
[1:12:43] saw little children hooked up to an ox
[1:12:45] cart and instead of making making the
[1:12:47] auction pull it they were making the
[1:12:48] children pull it they're putting the
[1:12:50] children to work
[1:12:52] and it seemed like that that my job's
[1:12:54] just getting harder and harder and I got
[1:12:56] a maniac boss
[1:12:58] so brother Branham called him a maniac
[1:13:00] for a boss a Taskmaster out there Maniac
[1:13:03] screaming at me all day
[1:13:05] screaming at me trying to make me work
[1:13:07] trying to make me trying to make the
[1:13:09] people work harder we can't work no
[1:13:10] harder we don't have the ability to do
[1:13:13] it and he said we're supposed to be the
[1:13:15] people of God
[1:13:16] but it seems like he doesn't care
[1:13:19] now I'm gonna be real with you tonight
[1:13:20] there's many times in your life when it
[1:13:22] seems like that God just doesn't seem to
[1:13:24] care like he ought to or you wouldn't be
[1:13:26] going through what you're going through
[1:13:27] but he does care he does care but he
[1:13:30] knows so much about you that he knows so
[1:13:32] much more than we know and he knows what
[1:13:34] we need to go through he knows what
[1:13:37] it'll take to shape us and make us ready
[1:13:39] for another land he knows what it's
[1:13:41] going to take to make us Kings and
[1:13:43] Priests and to break his people that can
[1:13:45] judge others
[1:13:46] Paul said we'll even judge Angels how we
[1:13:49] ever going to do that unless we get to
[1:13:50] the place where God wants us to be and
[1:13:52] so he lets the pressure of the age mold
[1:13:55] us into who he wants us to be
[1:13:57] but Abraham comes home and he says we're
[1:13:59] supposed to be the people of God we're
[1:14:01] supposed to be God's people it seems
[1:14:03] like he doesn't care
[1:14:04] he said he told his wife oh but dear
[1:14:06] when I pray so much and still God don't
[1:14:08] hear me and it seems like it just gets
[1:14:10] worse all the time the more I pray the
[1:14:12] worse it gets
[1:14:13] and sometimes you feel that way the more
[1:14:15] I pray the worse it gets when I when I
[1:14:17] go to church it seems like I go to
[1:14:19] church and I'm faithful and when I'm
[1:14:20] faithful it gets harder
[1:14:23] and I've watched it so many times with a
[1:14:24] young couple just starts out it seems
[1:14:26] like it'll go good for a while and then
[1:14:27] work will hit him really hard
[1:14:30] hit him really hard in some way if it's
[1:14:33] not work it'll be it'll be their health
[1:14:35] or it'll be their family or it'll be
[1:14:37] something else it'll hit them real hard
[1:14:39] why because he's trying to get him to
[1:14:41] give up
[1:14:42] because he realizes the damage that a
[1:14:44] couple surrendered to God can do
[1:14:47] he remembers Abraham and talk about he
[1:14:50] remembers Mary and Joseph
[1:14:53] amen and he realizes what how hard it is
[1:14:56] yeah how hard it's going to be he knows
[1:14:59] how hard you're going to make his life
[1:15:03] huh you're gonna shake the enemy one day
[1:15:06] so he's trying to shake you first
[1:15:10] Moses would stand before pharaoh and say
[1:15:13] let my people go
[1:15:16] but first his mom and dad had to be
[1:15:18] challenged
[1:15:19] with a dilemma
[1:15:24] seems like a man would just quit
[1:15:26] but amram couldn't quit
[1:15:28] just something in him
[1:15:30] something kept holding him I'm so glad
[1:15:32] for that something today
[1:15:35] he had a little room where he prayed all
[1:15:36] night
[1:15:37] and his job at the room said was to make
[1:15:39] bricks to house Idols all day he'd go
[1:15:41] out and make bricks
[1:15:43] so that they'd have a place to put their
[1:15:45] idolatrous images
[1:15:47] and then he'd come back and pray to the
[1:15:49] real God
[1:15:50] and he wondered sometimes why the real
[1:15:52] God didn't answer
[1:15:55] but he got desperate brother Brown said
[1:15:57] this real Christian man down there
[1:15:59] working like that for the enemy but he
[1:16:00] was a slave he was in bondage he had to
[1:16:02] do it every night when he would come
[1:16:04] home he would pray and go up the steps
[1:16:06] again and pray and pray and pray and
[1:16:08] come back down got no better kept
[1:16:10] getting worse little old frail body he
[1:16:12] said he lost a lot of weight up the
[1:16:14] creaky steps he goes over there kneels
[1:16:15] down and he said oh Jehovah oh he said
[1:16:18] he finally got so bad things got so bad
[1:16:20] and they were talking about aborting the
[1:16:22] children throwing them in the river and
[1:16:24] all the things they were talking about
[1:16:25] just like today
[1:16:27] just like today and he got so desperate
[1:16:31] oh my god oh I believe it's time for
[1:16:34] people to get desperate today
[1:16:36] he got so desperate he prayed like he
[1:16:38] never had before and he said Jehovah
[1:16:40] looky here you're a real God we believe
[1:16:42] you got ears we believe he got eyes you
[1:16:45] know all things we believe you're the
[1:16:46] god of the Hebrews we're the people of
[1:16:48] the promise how many people believe that
[1:16:50] tonight
[1:16:51] we believe you keep your word
[1:16:54] should look at these heathens out there
[1:16:56] how they're taking our chief labor
[1:16:58] building great big roads and idols and
[1:17:00] everything you Jehovah would you sit in
[1:17:02] heaven and let the heathens rule over
[1:17:04] you he said I don't believe you'll do it
[1:17:06] he said I still don't believe he'll do
[1:17:08] it when the Devil comes in God is still
[1:17:11] God
[1:17:12] he's not going to let that situation
[1:17:14] stay like it is you you just spare up
[1:17:16] you stay where you are remember he's not
[1:17:19] going to let that situation remain like
[1:17:21] it is
[1:17:22] he's still God he'll either take you out
[1:17:25] of the situation or he'll take the
[1:17:26] situation away from you
[1:17:28] he's still God God is still God but
[1:17:31] he'll do it when it's time
[1:17:32] he said he'll not permit those Devils to
[1:17:34] do that I believe that today when the
[1:17:36] fashion and nonsense and all just tell
[1:17:38] me about going on still God still Reigns
[1:17:41] and he is still God you won't learn that
[1:17:44] on Facebook you won't learn that down at
[1:17:46] the Dollar General you're not going to
[1:17:47] learn that down at the coffee shop
[1:17:49] brother Danny but he's still God
[1:17:51] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:17:53] forever he never changes he steals
[1:17:56] Jehovah Jireh he's still a provider he's
[1:17:59] still able to break every enemy
[1:18:01] Break Every Chain he's still God
[1:18:05] amen you see what we need today is
[1:18:07] somebody like amram
[1:18:09] the burden on their heart who will stay
[1:18:11] there and pray it through until the
[1:18:13] heavens is split open Yonder and God
[1:18:15] comes down and answers prayer
[1:18:17] he said one day hammerham got desperate
[1:18:20] and he got to praying
[1:18:22] he said the light come in the room
[1:18:24] and he said there's good an angel
[1:18:26] with a sword and he pointed it towards
[1:18:29] the North
[1:18:30] oh my and he said that you're about to
[1:18:33] be delivered
[1:18:35] hallelujah oh we've had an angel in our
[1:18:38] day a mighty Angel put his feet on the
[1:18:39] land in the sea and he stood with an
[1:18:41] open book
[1:18:43] and a sword of the word was in his hand
[1:18:45] he said you're about to be delivered the
[1:18:47] Rapture is on
[1:18:50] stood there and he said he said it's on
[1:18:52] I want to encourage you tonight if
[1:18:54] you're going through these kinds of
[1:18:55] things and you're struggling I believe
[1:18:57] the lord gave me this and I know I know
[1:18:59] many times it's hard as a pastor because
[1:19:00] I know what some of you are going
[1:19:01] through but I'm not preaching at that
[1:19:03] tonight I'm preaching something God put
[1:19:04] on my heart
[1:19:05] and we see the angel of God standing in
[1:19:08] this age and saying you're going to make
[1:19:10] it
[1:19:11] there's coming it's Deliverance there's
[1:19:13] something coming your prayers been
[1:19:15] answered
[1:19:16] but you know what he did
[1:19:18] the next day he goes out to work
[1:19:22] nothing changed but he had a promise
[1:19:26] oh God
[1:19:28] oh one of these days church is not going
[1:19:30] to be like it is now
[1:19:32] one of these days we're going to leave
[1:19:33] this world one of these days is don't
[1:19:36] give up hope don't go looking for
[1:19:37] something else something better this
[1:19:39] isn't the time to do that
[1:19:41] this is the time to believe the word
[1:19:43] because an angel stood in our age and
[1:19:45] said he's coming
[1:19:48] oh my all the fellows up there he said
[1:19:51] the next day he goes out to work all the
[1:19:52] fellows up there they notice amram
[1:19:54] instead of coming being all stooped down
[1:19:56] and weary he had his shoulders up amen
[1:20:00] isn't that how you feel sometimes after
[1:20:01] you come out of the presence of God I
[1:20:03] think we need to pray through more often
[1:20:05] I think we need to have a church service
[1:20:07] sometimes where we just really get drunk
[1:20:09] on the spirit of God because you come
[1:20:10] out of there like the mouse that fell
[1:20:12] into a brewery and he come out and said
[1:20:13] where's that cat
[1:20:15] that's the way we feel when we come out
[1:20:17] of the presence of God
[1:20:21] oh my Hammer I'm standing there got his
[1:20:24] shoulders flown back instead of coming
[1:20:26] stoop down he said pass some more bricks
[1:20:30] Hallelujah come on let's go what's the
[1:20:33] matter glory to God God is going to
[1:20:35] answer prayer he said you know what
[1:20:36] makes you feel good when you get an
[1:20:38] answer he said don't we know that pop
[1:20:39] and Mom when God gives an answer you
[1:20:42] don't have to see a vision just know the
[1:20:44] answer is there
[1:20:46] Hallelujah so that's all you just know
[1:20:48] the answer is there
[1:20:50] right he said now listen close now I
[1:20:51] want you to listen what happened he said
[1:20:53] now you know after a while all right
[1:20:54] amram what's the matter with you God is
[1:20:56] going to answer prayer God is going to
[1:20:58] answer prayer well how is he going to
[1:21:00] answer prayer that don't make any
[1:21:02] difference
[1:21:04] I don't feel well I still got the old
[1:21:07] boss over me hollering at me I'm still
[1:21:09] in trouble at work I still got the
[1:21:11] problem but I know that God is able
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:14] how many believe that tonight he's able
[1:21:17] he's appeared to me through the word
[1:21:18] he's spoken to me said you don't have to
[1:21:20] have a vision
[1:21:23] just pray through and know the answer is
[1:21:25] already here
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:28] how's it going to answer prayer that
[1:21:30] don't make any difference when a guy
[1:21:31] walked up and said now when do you think
[1:21:32] he'll answer he said well I ain't going
[1:21:34] to tell you because you're an unbeliever
[1:21:36] anyhow pass me some more bricks
[1:21:40] don't make any difference no sir
[1:21:42] certainly not pass some more bricks
[1:21:44] Hallelujah he said he's going to answer
[1:21:45] prayer he said that's the way you feel
[1:21:47] when you know it's going to happen hey
[1:21:52] sometimes we have to make a choice
[1:21:53] whether we're going to serve God or
[1:21:55] money
[1:21:56] whether we're going to serve God or the
[1:21:58] system
[1:21:59] and again what did amram do he just kept
[1:22:01] doing what he was doing but he believed
[1:22:03] the promise
[1:22:05] are you with me now
[1:22:07] he believed the promise
[1:22:09] see we don't bargain with the Devil
[1:22:12] there has to be some things in your life
[1:22:13] that are non-negotiable
[1:22:15] just they're just not negotiable
[1:22:18] I know for many of you women that's
[1:22:19] cutting your hair right that's one of
[1:22:21] those things you're not going to cut
[1:22:23] your hair
[1:22:24] why because you believe what God Said
[1:22:27] for my wife that that's all her life
[1:22:30] she's never cut her hair she that as far
[1:22:33] as I can remember anyway and I've been
[1:22:35] married to her most of her life
[1:22:39] she never cut her hair but there's a
[1:22:41] reason for that it's not because I stand
[1:22:43] over all the time so you better not go
[1:22:44] to the beauty shop
[1:22:45] because she believes God's word
[1:22:48] that's non-negotiable
[1:22:51] not even going to start
[1:22:54] if I come to eat something you told you
[1:22:56] I think the Lord would be all right with
[1:22:58] us we just started cutting her hair and
[1:22:59] wearing makeup you know what well you
[1:23:01] women anyway if I come to you and told
[1:23:03] you that you know what you would say
[1:23:05] hahaha
[1:23:07] yeah you'd say we're going to find a
[1:23:09] different pastor
[1:23:10] and you should
[1:23:13] you should why it's non-negotiable
[1:23:17] some things have to be going to church
[1:23:19] has to be one of those things
[1:23:21] right if it's negotiable Satan will
[1:23:23] negotiate and you'll end up making
[1:23:25] bricks without straw
[1:23:28] right every time you bargain with the
[1:23:31] devil you lose but Moses come up finally
[1:23:33] he said we won't leave one hoof behind
[1:23:35] we're not going to negotiate no more
[1:23:37] we're going to wait and see what God
[1:23:39] does Amen oh it's time we quit negotiate
[1:23:41] with the Enemy and say I'm gonna I'm
[1:23:43] gonna believe what God Said I believe
[1:23:44] he'll take care of me I believe he's
[1:23:46] Jehovah Jireh I believe he'll improvide
[1:23:48] in some way some way he's going to do it
[1:23:51] he's done it before I've seen him do it
[1:23:53] before many of you Elders can say Amen
[1:23:56] to that because years ago you you quit
[1:23:58] negotiating with the devil and you said
[1:24:00] I'm gonna go to church I'm gonna raise
[1:24:01] my family in church and your kids and
[1:24:03] your grandkids some of your great
[1:24:05] grandkids are in church because of that
[1:24:06] today
[1:24:08] because of that it works
[1:24:14] every one of the disciples had to change
[1:24:16] occupations when they met Jesus have you
[1:24:18] ever thought about that
[1:24:21] I'm not saying you do it's not what I'm
[1:24:23] saying but did you ever think about that
[1:24:26] why because he became first in their
[1:24:28] lives
[1:24:31] Matthew 16 24 said Gee Jesus told his
[1:24:34] disciples If any man will come after me
[1:24:36] let him deny himself
[1:24:37] take up his cross and follow me
[1:24:40] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:24:42] lose it brother Branham has the children
[1:24:44] in in teaching on Moses he has the
[1:24:46] children to repeat this first at the the
[1:24:49] correlating verse in in Mark where he
[1:24:51] says the same thing whosoever will save
[1:24:52] his life shall lose it whosoever will
[1:24:54] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[1:24:57] for what is a man profited if he shall
[1:24:59] gain the whole world and lose his own
[1:25:01] soul
[1:25:02] what shall a man give in exchange for
[1:25:05] his soul
[1:25:06] and then you find the Rich Young Ruler
[1:25:08] in Matthew 19 that actually here the
[1:25:11] disciples had followed Jesus and the
[1:25:13] rich and ruler wanted to follow Jesus
[1:25:15] but he wanted to follow in his own way
[1:25:18] and so Jesus looked at him and said to
[1:25:20] follow me you're going to have to endure
[1:25:22] hardness
[1:25:23] yeah there's going to be trouble because
[1:25:25] you're going to have to sell what you
[1:25:26] have and follow me that's what it took
[1:25:28] in that hour to be a disciple you had to
[1:25:30] become homeless
[1:25:33] yeah yeah
[1:25:34] you become an itinerant homeless a bunch
[1:25:37] of homeless people wandering around
[1:25:38] following the Messiah because they
[1:25:40] didn't have live streaming
[1:25:43] right they weren't live streaming the
[1:25:45] feeding the five thousand
[1:25:47] if you want to see what Jesus was doing
[1:25:48] you had to be there
[1:25:50] if you want to be his disciple hear what
[1:25:52] he taught you had to be there
[1:25:54] so they had to be there and so they gave
[1:25:56] up everything oh my I think there's a
[1:25:59] special place for those men and those
[1:26:01] women too that gave up everything
[1:26:02] because it wasn't just the men there
[1:26:03] were 12 disciples but then there were
[1:26:05] women that gave up everything too and
[1:26:07] followed Jesus
[1:26:09] Mary Magdalene was one there there was
[1:26:11] women that gave up everything to go
[1:26:13] follow Jesus Matthew 19 27 and answered
[1:26:17] Peter this is after the Rich Young Ruler
[1:26:19] comes to him and he went away sorrowful
[1:26:20] and he wasn't willing to give it all up
[1:26:23] and Peter said to Jesus Peter being a
[1:26:26] businessman since it's an opportunity
[1:26:28] he says hey wait a minute if if him he
[1:26:31] refused to forsake all and he was lost
[1:26:33] what about us and for Sook all yeah what
[1:26:36] are we gonna have
[1:26:39] amen and Jesus said verily I say unto
[1:26:42] you that ye which have followed me in
[1:26:44] the Regeneration when the son of man
[1:26:45] shall sit in the Throne of his glory you
[1:26:47] should also shall sit upon 12 Thrones
[1:26:49] judging the 12 tribes of Israel and
[1:26:51] everyone that hath forsaken houses or
[1:26:53] Brethren or sisters or father or mother
[1:26:55] or wife or children or lands for my
[1:26:58] namesake shall receive a hundredfold and
[1:27:00] shall inherit eternity everlasting life
[1:27:02] listen he doesn't receive a hundredfold
[1:27:04] over there he receives a hundredfold
[1:27:06] here
[1:27:08] and inherits everlasting life
[1:27:11] many that are first shall be last
[1:27:13] and the last
[1:27:15] shall be first with the scriptural
[1:27:17] principle you'd be better off if you put
[1:27:19] God first
[1:27:20] financially you'd be better off
[1:27:23] if you put God first
[1:27:26] Matthew 6 31. you say how can you say
[1:27:28] that because the Bible says that
[1:27:30] yeah Matthew 6 31 therefore take no
[1:27:32] thought I know this doesn't mean you
[1:27:34] can't plan for retirement but if you go
[1:27:35] back in the original it's anxious
[1:27:36] thought don't worry about it
[1:27:39] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[1:27:40] or what should we drink or where with
[1:27:42] all should we be clothed after all these
[1:27:44] things to the Gentiles seek for your
[1:27:47] heavenly father knoweth that you have
[1:27:48] need of all these things he says not
[1:27:50] that you don't need them you need them
[1:27:52] he wants you to wear clothes
[1:27:54] he wants you to have something to eat
[1:27:57] he knows you have neither those things
[1:27:59] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:28:03] his righteousness and all these things
[1:28:05] shall be added unto you
[1:28:07] Abraham I think of him as we're getting
[1:28:09] close to time to close now if you just
[1:28:11] hang with me for another moment Abraham
[1:28:13] was up there with with uh with lot you
[1:28:16] remember and he had a dilemma he faced
[1:28:19] The Dilemma what's he going to do he has
[1:28:21] to separate from law because he told him
[1:28:23] when you've when you separated from your
[1:28:24] brethren he said then you can follow me
[1:28:27] and he's and lot was always a hair in
[1:28:29] the biscuit because he's always halfway
[1:28:30] between the church and the world
[1:28:32] so their herdsmen got to strive God
[1:28:35] created Strife between the herdsmen and
[1:28:37] allowed that to happen and and so when
[1:28:39] they got to Flushing fighting with one
[1:28:40] another he said well let's just go
[1:28:41] different ways he said if you choose
[1:28:43] this way I'll go this way
[1:28:45] and knowing which way lot would choose
[1:28:47] because a lot wasn't a man to turn down
[1:28:49] a well-watered plane
[1:28:52] he wasn't a man to turn down a good job
[1:28:56] I hope you hear me tonight
[1:28:59] and Abraham knew he said I just got to
[1:29:00] go the opposite direction he does well
[1:29:02] the opposite direction was a plane but
[1:29:04] it wasn't well watered it was a desert
[1:29:07] and so he takes his wife and Abraham was
[1:29:10] a rich man but he was going to become
[1:29:11] less rich
[1:29:13] by making this decision
[1:29:16] right and so now brother Brown says this
[1:29:18] he said notice Abraham up there with
[1:29:20] Sarah his wife he said no doubt but many
[1:29:22] times the millbarrow got way down to the
[1:29:24] bottom but they still serve the Lord
[1:29:27] they were in the perfect will of God
[1:29:30] though they had to suffer just a little
[1:29:32] bit to make ends meet
[1:29:35] I told somebody I think brother Isaac I
[1:29:37] told you and Catherine the other day
[1:29:39] every couple needs to go through that
[1:29:40] you know at the beginning of their
[1:29:41] marriage and and he is about a week out
[1:29:43] and he said I'm done with it it's okay
[1:29:45] that's enough
[1:29:48] scraped the bottle from the barrel
[1:29:49] enough
[1:29:51] beating them oats brother talked about
[1:29:53] something I've eaten him enough you know
[1:29:54] give me that long face so I I'm ready to
[1:29:57] have some money
[1:29:58] but you know that's the way we feel
[1:29:59] sometimes Abraham and Sarah were in the
[1:30:01] perfect will of God and everybody
[1:30:03] probably telling her off you'd move here
[1:30:04] you'd have more money if you do this
[1:30:06] you'd have more money if you go here and
[1:30:07] do this whatever you probably would
[1:30:10] but you don't and it may be right for
[1:30:12] you to do that but make sure it's in the
[1:30:13] will of God
[1:30:15] make sure you pray about it I can't tell
[1:30:17] you whether or not to go
[1:30:19] it would be a misuse and abuse of my
[1:30:22] authority
[1:30:23] to tell you to take a job or not to take
[1:30:25] a job but I can tell you what the word
[1:30:27] says
[1:30:30] right
[1:30:31] so they were in the perfect will of God
[1:30:33] they said to suffer a little bit to make
[1:30:35] ends meet
[1:30:36] amen
[1:30:38] he said nearly everyone that really
[1:30:40] truly serves God meets them kind of
[1:30:41] times
[1:30:42] sure we do sometimes you wonder how
[1:30:44] you're going to get the kitties some
[1:30:45] shoes for school how are you going to
[1:30:47] make this bill and that bill you say
[1:30:49] well my parents don't have to worry
[1:30:50] about that well they did 30 years ago
[1:30:53] he was just too little to remember
[1:30:57] how are you going to make this bill and
[1:30:59] that bill he said don't worry he said
[1:31:01] there's only one thing to do is rest on
[1:31:04] his promise he said I've never seen the
[1:31:06] righteous forsaken I've never seen a
[1:31:09] seat back in breath I can say that as
[1:31:10] David said it thousands of years ago
[1:31:12] Brother David but I can say it again I
[1:31:15] can say it again today he said I have
[1:31:17] never seen his seed forsaken I've been
[1:31:19] down but I've not been out Paul said
[1:31:21] I've been persecuted but not forsaken
[1:31:23] I've been beaten with stripes but he
[1:31:25] never left me he never left me alone and
[1:31:27] when my time come to die it was to live
[1:31:29] with Christ and to die was gain listen
[1:31:31] to me every one of us are in that same
[1:31:33] place today God doesn't care for us less
[1:31:35] than he does his prophets he doesn't
[1:31:37] care for us less than he did his
[1:31:38] impossible he cares for us that much
[1:31:41] more here at the end time where his
[1:31:43] bride he loves us
[1:31:46] he cares about you and he we have never
[1:31:50] seen a case where the righteous was
[1:31:52] forsaken
[1:31:54] never that's the word of God
[1:31:57] Satan telling you that you're going to
[1:31:58] be forsaken it's him speaking in your
[1:32:00] mind telling you well I can't do it or
[1:32:02] I'll lose everything no I've never seen
[1:32:05] the righteous forsaken
[1:32:07] it doesn't matter he said
[1:32:09] you just served God
[1:32:12] the pressure's on
[1:32:14] it's a dilemma
[1:32:16] but as the musicians come I
[1:32:20] I like what brother Branham was told
[1:32:23] when the tongues you remember we talked
[1:32:25] about tongues here not long ago
[1:32:27] there was a man by the name of Danny
[1:32:28] Henry that spoke in tongues he didn't
[1:32:30] speak French but he spoke in French
[1:32:32] and there were four people I think he
[1:32:34] said there that were interpreters
[1:32:35] friends that understood French all of
[1:32:38] them wrote it down it was the same all
[1:32:40] of them
[1:32:41] he spoke in French and this is part of
[1:32:43] what he said
[1:32:45] I love this the brother Brandon could
[1:32:46] have had all the money he wanted
[1:32:48] all he had to do was take the check
[1:32:51] all he had to do was go where they
[1:32:53] wanted him to go
[1:32:54] you could have all the money he wanted
[1:32:56] but I'm so glad he didn't
[1:34:30] foreign
[1:36:03] foreign
[1:36:49] foreign
[1:39:45] foreign
[1:40:34] foreign
[1:42:46] foreign
[1:44:56] foreign
[1:45:19] because he knew you would
[1:45:22] they told him he said because I was
[1:45:24] chosen
[1:45:27] a narrow path the harder way
[1:45:30] now let's walk of your own choosing
[1:45:33] thou has picked the correct and precise
[1:45:36] decision and it is my way
[1:45:39] because of this momentous decision a
[1:45:42] huge portion of Heaven awaits Thee I
[1:45:44] love that listen there's a God who sees
[1:45:47] there's a God who knows that's what
[1:45:48] Imran was sitting there in his house as
[1:45:50] he spreading the crowned up to God he
[1:45:52] said God your God with ears
[1:45:54] your God with eyes
[1:45:57] you see you hear
[1:45:59] I wonder how many of us realize that
[1:46:00] tonight
[1:46:01] you're a God that knows what I'm going
[1:46:03] through and because he knows what you're
[1:46:05] going through he told those who are
[1:46:06] suffering during the church ages either
[1:46:09] under under all kinds of persecution
[1:46:10] physical persecution he told him he said
[1:46:12] I know and that's all he said he didn't
[1:46:15] say I'll take it away from you I'll
[1:46:16] deliver you from it he said I know but a
[1:46:19] prophet of God stood in this age and
[1:46:20] said it was enough for him to know
[1:46:22] because his love was elected they could
[1:46:24] not die they may have been slaughtered
[1:46:27] by the enemy but they could not die
[1:46:29] because they were goddess children they
[1:46:32] were the seed of God
[1:46:33] because you picked this harder way
[1:46:36] because of this moment this decision a
[1:46:38] huge
[1:46:39] version of Heaven
[1:46:40] I'll wait you would you bow your heads
[1:46:42] with me
[1:46:43] I don't know what the harder way means
[1:46:45] for you it might mean more hours at work
[1:46:48] might mean less
[1:46:50] begging bread
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:53] he said well I had to ask at one time
[1:46:55] for help but
[1:46:56] you didn't have to beg
[1:46:58] that God had somebody that would help
[1:47:00] you
[1:47:02] well I brother Ben I I'm in trouble
[1:47:04] today I don't know what the future holds
[1:47:07] let him take over let it let him take
[1:47:10] your bank account let the word be in
[1:47:12] charge
[1:47:14] of your bank account let him be in
[1:47:16] charge of your job let him be in charge
[1:47:18] of your marriage let him be in charge
[1:47:20] the word that created the world
[1:47:23] poke a world and Earth into existence
[1:47:28] and all that you see were created out of
[1:47:30] things which were not by faith
[1:47:33] let that word dwell in you and let it
[1:47:36] let it rule your life let it let it be
[1:47:38] number one and God will make things come
[1:47:40] out all right
[1:47:41] it'll be okay
[1:47:44] don't let Satan don't let Satan pile you
[1:47:47] up with so many burdens
[1:47:48] I think of the children of Israel when
[1:47:50] their deliverer came and after he came
[1:47:52] it didn't go like they thought it should
[1:47:54] they wanted to Stone Moses
[1:47:57] and Aaron because things weren't going
[1:47:59] like they thought they should sometimes
[1:48:01] that's the position we get in but just
[1:48:03] hold on
