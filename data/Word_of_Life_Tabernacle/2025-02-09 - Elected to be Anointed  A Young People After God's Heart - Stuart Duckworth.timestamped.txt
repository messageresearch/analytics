[45:34] to have his presence be in you now I
[45:38] pray that there's some young people here
[45:40] that know him in that way here this
[45:44] evening we look here in the scripture
[45:47] that we
[45:48] read we see here the prophet Samuel
[45:51] mourning for Saul because he had been
[45:53] rejected by God as king and SA was the
[45:57] people's king and the people that day
[46:00] they had seen the Philistines that they
[46:03] had a king to lead and to rule over them
[46:06] and so they wanted the same thing and
[46:08] that the the the the name Saul means
[46:12] desired and the children of Israel had
[46:14] chosen Saul out of desire to be like the
[46:18] world but he was chosen from the wrong
[46:21] desire they had chosen him over God's
[46:24] provided way that he had made for them
[46:25] to walk in they had rejected the prophet
[46:28] Samuel the prophet who had the word of
[46:31] the Lord for them and Samuel was a type
[46:35] and represented the Holy Spirit to God's
[46:38] children and this Prophet only spoke as
[46:41] God led him to
[46:43] speak and and when the people called for
[46:45] Saul to be King Samuel said when have I
[46:48] ever told you anything in the name of
[46:50] the Lord but what come to pass have I
[46:54] ever walked misbehaving
[46:56] before you have I ever begged you for
[46:59] money or or took anything from you but
[47:02] all that I've said has been for your
[47:04] good all that I've said has been from
[47:07] the Lord uhuh but they rejected they
[47:11] rejected God's provided way they wanted
[47:14] a king out of the wrong
[47:16] desire but even in this Samuel prayed
[47:19] and told the Lord to hearken under the
[47:21] voice of the people for they have not
[47:23] rejected you but they have rejected me
[47:27] we look at Saul just this character just
[47:30] for a few moments if we can Saul being
[47:34] uh the desire of the people but the
[47:36] wrong kind of King Saul was chosen by
[47:40] the people to be king he was a great and
[47:42] a mighty man in so much that the Bible
[47:45] said that the spirit of the Lord came
[47:47] upon him and he
[47:49] prophesied and they said among
[47:51] themselves what is this that has come
[47:54] under the sons of Kish the Bible says is
[47:56] s Paul also among the prophets but why
[48:00] did God reject
[48:02] him Saul disobeyed in his heart listen
[48:06] now Saul disobeyed in his heart and was
[48:08] turned from following the Commandments
[48:11] of the
[48:12] Lord come on and the Bible says when
[48:14] they had fought and destroyed the
[48:17] amalekites he and the people spared AAG
[48:20] the king and the Bible says and they
[48:23] kept the best of the sheep and the
[48:25] axling the o and the fatlings and the
[48:28] Lambs and that that what was good and
[48:31] did not destroy it as God commanded them
[48:34] but they used it to sacrifice and so
[48:37] there Saul became backslid in Israel the
[48:41] Bible says brother said the that Israel
[48:43] fell into a backslidden
[48:46] condition and we'll read here in 1st
[48:48] Samuel 15 I hope this is all right this
[48:54] evening 1st Samuel 15 and22
[48:59] and Samuel said hath the
[49:01] Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings
[49:05] and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of
[49:08] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[49:11] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[49:14] rams verse 23 for Rebellion is as the
[49:18] sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[49:20] iniquity and idolater because thou has
[49:23] rejected the word of the Lord amen and
[49:26] he has has also rejected thee from being
[49:31] King and we look here at Saul we look at
[49:33] this character he was so full of
[49:36] rebellion and stubbornness to the
[49:39] word yeah and and and this evil spirit
[49:43] this evil spirit that would come upon
[49:45] him and and if you uh have a problem
[49:47] with the word if you have a problem with
[49:49] with this verse and this verse this
[49:51] verse and this verse you're just
[49:53] allowing the Devil to come in if you've
[49:55] got a problem with the word that is a
[49:57] wrong spirit and so Saul had a problem
[50:00] with the word he had a problem with
[50:01] obeying what the prophet told him to do
[50:05] and and Disobedience uh to the word will
[50:08] only make way for
[50:11] sin and and these evil spirits no doubt
[50:15] no doubt Saul was a good man and and and
[50:19] and the prophet Samuel mourned the Bible
[50:21] says because that God reject him but an
[50:24] evil spirit will take you from further
[50:27] than you want to go it'll take you
[50:29] places that you never thought you would
[50:33] go and we look at this he says for
[50:35] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft
[50:38] and we look at it even years later uh
[50:41] Saul had an evil spirit on him and he
[50:44] got to a place where he couldn't hear
[50:46] from God he would he would inquire of
[50:49] God and God turned his ear to Saul and
[50:53] the Bible says that he turned to the
[50:55] witch of Endor to call the spirit of
[50:58] Samuel and Samuel when when Samuel came
[51:00] forth Samuel asked him why have you
[51:03] disturbed me why have you disturbed me
[51:06] oh that seeing that you've been rejected
[51:09] why have you disturbed me but but but
[51:11] Saul wanted to know a question he wanted
[51:13] to know what would happen in a battle
[51:16] and Samuel told him him and his sons
[51:18] would die in battle and that they would
[51:21] be with him
[51:23] soon listen see Saul had made himself so
[51:27] great that he got above the prophet amen
[51:30] he made himself so great that he got
[51:33] above the Commandments of God and but
[51:36] God but God wanted him to they wanted
[51:38] him to listen God wants us to listen to
[51:40] him God wanted him to not spare the king
[51:43] AAG he he didn't want him to spare the
[51:45] the best of the best and the The Oxen
[51:47] but he wanted them to go in and destroy
[51:49] the enemy because if you don't destroy
[51:52] your enemy your enemy is going to
[51:54] destroy you and that was go that's what
[51:55] was God he couldn't let that go on Amen
[51:58] it was s it was such an Abomination
[52:00] before him because because God's got a
[52:02] People amen and we've got to go after
[52:04] the enemy and not let the enemy hang
[52:06] around
[52:08] preach come on Lord help me to
[52:11] preach
[52:16] amen again if you if you don't destroy
[52:19] your enemy if I don't destroy my enemy
[52:22] my enemy will destroy me and God has
[52:25] given us the power Power by the blood of
[52:28] Jesus Christ to destroy every enemy to
[52:30] destroy every bit of sin young people
[52:32] anything that would try to hold you
[52:34] bondage God has given us the power to
[52:36] overcome
[52:38] that we look here he got so full of
[52:42] himself and I I was sitting last night
[52:45] um rocking my baby boy to sleep and I
[52:47] was thinking Lord what am I going to
[52:49] preach
[52:50] tomorrow but this came to me that Saul
[52:54] got so full of himself W that's right
[52:57] but but he had a king he had somebody on
[53:00] the back side of the desert that wasn't
[53:01] full of themselves but somebody that was
[53:03] longing to have the anointing poured
[53:06] upon them amen Saul got so full of
[53:09] himself that he leaned to his own
[53:11] understanding he was above the prophet
[53:13] he was above listening to tapes he was
[53:15] above listening to the message amen if
[53:18] we can just say something here this
[53:19] evening amen amen have a desire for the
[53:22] Holy Ghost have a desire for the word of
[53:24] God have a desire to get into the
[53:26] message of the hour because that's
[53:28] what's going to bring the anointing upon
[53:29] your life amen to come under the
[53:31] anointing of the message of the hour not
[53:33] the anointing of a man but what God sent
[53:35] in this hour amen God sent to you young
[53:38] people to fight with to overcome with
[53:41] amen have an interest in what God has
[53:43] spoke to us in this hour
[53:48] absolutely but he got so full of himself
[53:51] and that's why God rejected him come on
[53:54] and we've we can all identify with Saul
[53:56] we've all all been there we've all
[53:57] thought we were bigger than the word
[53:59] amen but let's have a different Spirit
[54:01] here among us this evening let's reject
[54:03] that that old life that old man that
[54:05] what we were that disobey God we were
[54:07] all like that but thank God for grace in

[54:16] somebody else in thank I'm thankful for
[54:18] the grace of Jesus Christ for my
[54:21] life amen
[54:27] so that's why God rejected him but there

[54:35] side of the desert amen whose heart was

[56:08] Lord well David he knew the power of
[56:11] God and David depended on the spirit of
[56:14] the Lord to fight his battles oh yeah

[56:20] to serve God someone who had a heart to
[56:23] obey the voice of the Lord to follow the
[56:26] Commandments of the Lord and that was
[56:28] the type of leader that God had for
[56:30] Israel that's the type of leader that
[56:32] Israel needed someone that hated sin
[56:35] amen someone that their heart was not
[56:36] defiled amen they weren't full of
[56:38] themselves full of the world's desires

[57:45] one have I been preaching for 30 minutes
[57:48] no somebody tell me
[57:51] no I messed up last time I preached that
[57:55] was my fault I read the time
[57:58] wrong but I got a pretty good idea where
[58:00] we're at
[58:02] now amen that's right Psalms
[58:06] 241 I love this Psalm of David the Earth
[58:10] is the Lords and the fullness there of
[58:13] the world and they that dwell therein
[58:15] verse two for he hath founded it upon
[58:18] the Seas and established it upon the
[58:20] floods and who shall Ascend into the
[58:23] hill of the Lord or who shall stand in
[58:25] his holy place Place verse four he that
[58:28] hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who
[58:30] hath not lifted his soul up unto vanity
[58:34] nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive
[58:37] the blessing from the Lord and the
[58:40] righteousness from the god of his
[58:42] salvation and that word pure there means
[58:44] to be pure clear and sincere and mean it
[58:48] means to be clean and to be empty and I
[58:50] want to emphasize that here this this
[58:53] evening Amen to be empty to be pure is
[58:55] to be empty not to be filled with the
[58:57] things of this world not to be full of
[58:59] yourself but to be emptied out to be
[59:01] able to receive the blessing of God to
[59:04] be able to receive from God every
[59:06] service amen that we come to amen and we
[59:09] as a church that's that's the way we've

[59:17] empty heart say God fill me AR fresh God
[59:20] fill me a new with your
[59:24] spirit he that hath clean hand hands and
[59:27] a pure heart an empty heart not full of
[59:31] himself not full of how great they think
[59:34] they are but an empty heart to be able
[59:36] to receive God gred Lord this Pure Heart
[59:41] Bible says who have not lifted up his
[59:43] soul unto vanity and that word vanity
[59:46] means means emptiness it means it means
[59:49] falsehood it means nothingness it means
[59:52] emptiness of speech or or ly I say this
[59:56] this evening blessed is the man who
[59:58] doesn't open himself up because because
[1:00:00] Satan Satan knows what kind of vessel

[1:07:47] from the world denominations barriers
[1:07:50] and so forth and education will never do
[1:07:52] it it'll take the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:54] Ghost in our heart to pour itself out

[1:08:01] God has filled up that person then they
[1:08:02] are led by the Holy Ghost he says amen I

[1:08:39] a place where you can come and die out
[1:08:41] amen and the powerful effect of Calvary
[1:08:44] what it's had upon the believer God
[1:08:46] didn't just do that to be doing it but

[1:10:08] ourselves for God to manifest himself

[1:10:31] before
[1:10:33] him God wants hearts that will stay true
[1:10:35] to his

[1:10:46] elected king of my choosing that needs
[1:10:48] to be anointed amen God is looking for
[1:10:51] somebody that he can anoint in this hour

[1:10:56] can move upon he's looking for hearts
[1:10:57] that have a desire to be filled with the
[1:10:59] Holy Ghost he's looking amen for hearts
[1:11:02] that have a desire to be refilled with
[1:11:04] the Holy Ghost amen and we should always
[1:11:07] Place amen emphasis on that experience
[1:11:10] amen before you build a life before you

[1:11:20] Christian is not a material minded amen
[1:11:23] person they are christm minded and Jesus

[1:11:49] provide what you have need of thank you
[1:11:52] Lord but seek first his kingdom
[1:11:56] that word seek means to seek seek in
[1:11:59] order to find amen it's something that's
[1:12:01] obtainable it's not something that's Out
[1:12:04] Of Reach amen but it's something that's
[1:12:06] obtainable if Jesus gave us a promise
[1:12:08] Amen in the Bible said if if he said be
[1:12:10] ye perfect even as your father in Heaven
[1:12:12] is perfect Jesus has got to make a way
[1:12:15] for me to be perfect and I can never be
[1:12:17] perfect Within Myself I can never be in
[1:12:20] perfect within this flesh amen but

[1:12:44] Lord Jesus said blessed are the poor in
[1:12:47] spirit for THS is the Kingdom of
[1:12:51] Heaven he said blessed are the meek for
[1:12:54] they shall inherit the earth it's not
[1:12:57] how great you can make yourself how full
[1:12:58] of yourself you can be but how you can
[1:13:01] empty yourself that's he goes on blessed
[1:13:05] are those that hunger and thirst after
[1:13:07] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:13:10] do you want to be filled tonight you
[1:13:12] want to be filled every day filled in so
[1:13:15] much that the devil don't know what to
[1:13:17] do with
[1:13:18] you that's how I want to live
[1:13:21] amen we look at Jesse's Sons here in
[1:13:24] first Samuel 16 we'll try to
[1:13:27] hurry Jesse's sons look here from from
[1:13:31] the oldest to the youngest the prophet
[1:13:33] Samuel called Jesse's sons and called I
[1:13:36] called them to a
[1:13:38] sacrifice in 1st Samuel 16:6 and it came
[1:13:41] to pass when they were come that he
[1:13:43] looked on alive and said surely the
[1:13:46] Lord's anointed is before him but the
[1:13:49] Lord said unto Samuel look not on his
[1:13:52] countenance or on the height of his
[1:13:54] stature because I have refused him for
[1:13:56] the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for
[1:13:59] the man lookth on the outward appearance
[1:14:01] but the Lord lookth on the heart this
[1:14:05] here was the oldest of Jesse's sons and
[1:14:07] maybe the prophet was sitting there
[1:14:09] looking at him as he as he passed by and
[1:14:12] maybe he was similar in stature to to
[1:14:14] Saul and maybe had bring brought back
[1:14:16] memories of of how Saul carried himself
[1:14:19] and he said surely this is the the
[1:14:21] anointed that that I am to anoint him
[1:14:23] there he had great big shoulders brother
[1:14:25] B said tall and handsome amen maybe it
[1:14:27] was the best looking he had seen the way
[1:14:29] he carried himself maybe he was the best
[1:14:32] dressed and even the prophet thought
[1:14:34] surely this is him the Lord said look
[1:14:39] not on those things for I have refused
[1:14:42] him that's right and brother Bram says
[1:14:45] here questions and answers listen young
[1:14:47] people and today everything is based
[1:14:49] upon Hollywood Beauty and things like
[1:14:51] that when beauty is the secret thing of
[1:14:53] the heart not in outward appearance he
[1:14:56] said let them Adorn themselves not with
[1:14:58] an outward appearance but inward of a
[1:15:00] Meek A Gentle Spirit he said that's the
[1:15:03] Christian amen and and he says on here
[1:15:05] in 1962 he said we can never compare
[1:15:08] with the world we're we're doing wrong
[1:15:10] by trying to act like the world we can
[1:15:12] never compare with them and we've got no
[1:15:14] business on their grounds bring them
[1:15:16] over onto their grounds he said we've
[1:15:18] got something that they haven't got but
[1:15:21] he said you go to acting like them he
[1:15:23] said then they know we're saying
[1:15:24] something we have in God he said let the
[1:15:26] world come to us not us go out to the
[1:15:28] world he said you know Hollywood shines
[1:15:31] but the gospel glows he said there's a
[1:15:33] lot of difference between shining and
[1:15:35] glowing amen glow not shine with the
[1:15:38] outward appearance but glow on the
[1:15:40] inside by the Holy Ghost listen young

[1:15:56] pyramid amen and brotherly love that
[1:15:58] love that meekness that gentleness amen

[1:18:06] remaineth Yet the
[1:18:08] youngest I thought of y'all when I when
[1:18:10] I Was preparing for this there remain of
[1:18:13] the young behold he keepeth the sheep
[1:18:16] and Samuel said unto Jesse send and
[1:18:17] fetch him for we will not sit down till
[1:18:20] he come hither Prophet said I'm going to
[1:18:22] stand here till he comes all right
[1:18:25] because he the last
[1:18:27] one he is the anointed yes sir oh yeah
[1:18:32] and he sent and brought him in the Bible
[1:18:35] says now he was
[1:18:36] Ruddy that means red like Esau I guess
[1:18:40] maybe he was redheaded or
[1:18:42] something I guess he was Ruddy and with
[1:18:47] all B says a beautiful countenance and
[1:18:50] godly to look to and the Lord said arise
[1:18:53] anoint him for this is he then Samuel
[1:18:57] took the Horn of the O listen to this
[1:18:58] for Sam then Samuel took the Horn of the
[1:19:00] oil and anointed him in the midst of his
[1:19:03] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[1:19:06] Upon David from that day forward and so
[1:19:08] Samuel Rose and went
[1:19:11] upama there in the midst of his Brethren
[1:19:14] was he anointed and I thought of Jesus
[1:19:17] there at the at the river that day when
[1:19:19] he was
[1:19:20] baptized there anointing and the the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost fell the anointing came down
[1:19:26] down upon him for his three and 1/2
[1:19:29] years of service the anointing came down
[1:19:33] amongst his brethren in so much that
[1:19:35] John said behold this is the Lamb of God
[1:19:38] that takes away the sin of the
[1:19:41] world but that word anoint there that
[1:19:44] word anoint means to to smear and to
[1:19:47] anoint to spread liquid to smear so
[1:19:51] there in the midst of his Brethren the
[1:19:53] prophet takes the oil
[1:19:56] and he smears it upon him like this went
[1:20:00] all over
[1:20:03] [Laughter]
[1:20:06] him your hair looks good I won't do it
[1:20:08] to you your hair don't look that good he
[1:20:11] took the oil he smeared it upon him and
[1:20:14] anointed him in the midst of his
[1:20:20] Brethren amen am man poured the entire

[1:20:41] we understand that the anointing can
[1:20:43] fall upon
[1:20:44] anybody but the seed of God is what the
[1:20:47] anointing was for to manifest that seed
[1:20:49] that was within you now I can't say this
[1:20:53] one's got it and this one don't or this
[1:20:54] one don't and this one does because I'm
