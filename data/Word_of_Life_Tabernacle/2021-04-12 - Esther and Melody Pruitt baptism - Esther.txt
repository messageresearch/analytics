TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my girls you know you girls are special to you anyway it's such a privilege to be able to baptize your children but i'm just glad to be able to use this as well when we put this in installed it it's meant for use as long as we're here and as a functioning church i think we ought to be baptizing people and that's part of what we do and i'm grateful for that just giving them a minute to come in i read the girls this morning or last night actually from romans chapter six he says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe we should we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead diet no more death has no more dominion over him and so it's a great thing it's not a little thing to be baptized and so they both these girls have given their heart to the lord and we're grateful for that jason i didn't get to pray with you last week would you come as well and i'm going to pray with you and them together because i didn't pray with him last week and we're going to pray that god bless these young people then baptize today lord jesus for each one of these children god i pray that you would move in their lives lord not only them but also the ones that are lord in each family god you blessed our families with children we thank you for it and we ask you to just come and fill them all with the holy ghost today never have a question from this moment on lord that you've been moving and working in their lives i pray you grant we thank you for it lord thank you for your presence in jesus name amen amen melody faith i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] thank the lord this one has taken her a while to get in the water but i'm so grateful peter was seven years old when he was baptized but he's never turned back and i believe that god can deal with the hearts of our children at a young age astronaut baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ
