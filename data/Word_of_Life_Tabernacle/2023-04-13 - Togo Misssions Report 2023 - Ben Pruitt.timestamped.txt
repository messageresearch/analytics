[15:28] Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of
[15:31] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[15:34] like Precious faith with us I love the
[15:38] way he addresses that through the
[15:41] righteousness of God and our Savior
[15:43] Jesus Christ I pray the Lord that is
[15:46] blessing to the word you may be seated
[15:51] I've got several announcements before we
[15:53] get into this tonight
[15:56] this Sunday we'll have two Services back
[15:58] to our regular schedule but whether
[16:00] Georgia Moore is going to be here as you
[16:01] can tell I don't have much left to give
[16:03] brother George just happened to be
[16:05] flying in the area flying into the area
[16:07] so he's going to be here Sunday and I
[16:10] know you'll enjoy that but I'll be here
[16:12] just trying to recover a little bit and
[16:15] then this week we're gonna have
[16:17] something special for you and and I've
[16:20] been to a lot of church so we're fixing
[16:23] to have a little bit of church make up
[16:25] for some that we've missed here but
[16:28] Tuesday and Wednesday of this coming
[16:30] week we're going to have church now if
[16:33] you can't be here on Tuesday night be
[16:35] here on Wednesday night just like normal
[16:37] if we are going to have our regular
[16:39] Wednesday night service but Tuesday
[16:41] night brother Andrew Glover is going to
[16:42] be here and so I'm sure if you can be
[16:45] here that would be a blessing and I'm
[16:47] sure there'll be some visitors as well I
[16:48] let brother Jackson know and and brother
[16:51] Morris
[16:53] as well so well but the man so I'm sure
[16:57] some of the folks will will come and and
[16:59] so if you brother Andrew will be here
[17:01] Tuesday night and they're coming to pick
[17:03] up some chairs or that's what they're
[17:04] that was the excuse anyway and I told
[17:08] them while they were here that they
[17:09] needed to preach so so he's going to
[17:11] preach Tuesday night and then Wednesday
[17:13] night for our regular service and again
[17:15] if you can't be here on Tuesday night be
[17:17] here on Wednesday night and brother Josh
[17:19] Martin will be preaching for us so them
[17:21] two young men are just powerful
[17:23] preachers and so we'll have just a
[17:25] little bit of a Revival during the
[17:27] middle of the week and
[17:28] and I don't feel any pressure about that
[17:30] again if you're I know it's last minute
[17:33] and throwing it together if you're not
[17:35] able to be here that's that's I
[17:37] understand that but if you can be I'm
[17:39] sure it'll be a blessing to you uh then
[17:42] uh Saturday I believe it's for the
[17:43] Isaac's wedding on Saturday so uh let's
[17:46] try to go to that if you can I'm sure
[17:49] brother Isaac would appreciate some
[17:51] support from his home church and uh
[17:53] they're they're they're expecting to
[17:55] make this their church as a young
[17:57] married couple so we want to support
[17:58] them and that'll be it by the David
[18:00] Morris's on Saturday I think at one
[18:03] o'clock is it one o'clock or yeah one
[18:05] o'clock so uh try to support them in
[18:07] that and and I'm sure we want to do that
[18:10] for all our our young couples and then
[18:13] on the 29th we're going to have a work
[18:16] day here at the church so everybody say
[18:18] praise the Lord
[18:20] praise the Lord for the work day to on
[18:22] the 29th we'll have our spring work day
[18:25] try to get there's a bunch of stuff that
[18:26] needs to be done so if you can help us
[18:28] or or anytime if you want to come early
[18:31] or late that's fine but we're going to
[18:33] try to get together on the 29th to do
[18:34] some of the landscaping and things that
[18:37] need to be done amen let's get into this
[18:39] tonight I it was a miracle that I got to
[18:42] go to Togo
[18:44] a miracle and some of you know and some
[18:47] of you don't I had covid the week before
[18:50] I didn't know it I preached twice with
[18:53] it and I was sick and then I I didn't
[18:58] test until I was supposed to test on
[19:01] Thursday
[19:02] to go and I they canceled my test the
[19:07] testing location I had another test set
[19:09] up on Friday they canceled the test and
[19:12] uh so I took a self-test at home tested
[19:14] positive
[19:16] and I said well there's just no way I'm
[19:18] going to be able to go but then I took
[19:21] another self-test the next day because I
[19:23] preached here on Sunday took another
[19:25] self-testine it was negative the next
[19:27] day and so I said well we just don't
[19:29] know but I knew the other tests were
[19:30] more sensitive we went uh and that guy
[19:34] gave me a test on Monday and I got the
[19:37] results back and I was cleared to go so
[19:39] I didn't know for sure I would be able
[19:41] to go until Monday afternoon we didn't
[19:44] even pack all my stuff because I was
[19:47] that certain that I wasn't going to be
[19:49] able to go but God works in mysterious
[19:52] ways and and uh and I want to tell you
[19:55] some several things tonight and and just
[19:57] to let you know that we were meant to be
[20:00] there at the time we're there it was of
[20:02] the Lord that we were there and I know
[20:05] sometimes it's hard but but just bear
[20:06] with me tonight and you don't want your
[20:08] pastor to be gone I don't want to be
[20:10] gone but I think that it would be a
[20:13] blessing it was a blessing to them and
[20:15] and
[20:16] and that's what we wanted to do so we
[20:18] want to try to help somebody else we
[20:20] don't want to ever become too
[20:22] self-centered and looking at our own
[20:24] selves and just taking care of our own
[20:26] because we do want to do that that
[20:28] should be first but then we also want to
[20:30] reach out and help somebody we have been
[20:33] blessed and those of you who have
[20:35] traveled to Mission work and done things
[20:37] but Alan's been some places and
[20:39] different ones but Joel's been with me
[20:40] to Egypt if you've been overseas you
[20:42] know it's a different world especially
[20:44] in some of them third world countries
[20:46] and Togo is the second poorest country
[20:49] in the world right next to Haiti it's
[20:51] very very poor I can't even describe how
[20:54] poor that Togo is and yet the people of
[20:57] God are there and and the people are
[20:59] happy and and uh and they serve the Lord
[21:02] with all of their heart
[21:04] so Togo if you give me that slide that's
[21:07] where it's located in uh on the African
[21:11] Coast so you can see where we went we
[21:13] flew into loamy and we stayed there in
[21:16] the city lome is the city that's very
[21:18] close to the uh to the ocean and it's a
[21:21] city of about two million people there
[21:23] on the border of Ghana and and Togo
[21:27] uh we had eight Services over five days
[21:30] on Wednesday they had me scheduled in
[21:33] two different places at once and Brother
[21:36] David Shamel went with us uh at the last
[21:39] minute it was another thing another
[21:40] reason why I wasn't going to go is I
[21:42] didn't have anybody to go with me but
[21:43] the Joel needed to stay here and and uh
[21:46] some of the other brothers couldn't go
[21:48] and uh I didn't I don't like to do
[21:51] Mission work by myself it's not safe
[21:53] especially in some of those countries
[21:55] and Brother David Shamel offered to go
[21:57] with me and I am so happy that he did
[21:59] because they would have killed me
[22:02] without him being there and he preached
[22:04] two Services one at the beginning so I
[22:07] could be in one church Wednesday and he
[22:08] could be in another so we both got off
[22:10] the plane and preached on on Wednesday
[22:13] and then uh they uh but he was in one
[22:17] church and I was in another and uh in in
[22:19] the same city so I really appreciated
[22:21] him doing that that was his third sermon
[22:23] he had ever preached
[22:25] was in Africa so that was a real treat
[22:28] for him he'd only preached twice at his
[22:31] home church so he got to do that and and
[22:35] uh so we went to I was at brother
[22:37] Bernice church and if you heard me talk
[22:39] about brother benite before he doesn't
[22:41] speak English so it's hard for me to
[22:43] converse with him when I'm not there and
[22:45] don't have an interpreter but brother
[22:46] Benny is a wonderful wonderful man of
[22:50] God he's got a beautiful little church
[22:51] there and I'll talk to you more about
[22:53] that in just a minute on Thursday we
[22:55] went and I preached at the church in the
[22:58] village about 45 kilometers from uh from
[23:01] lome in ahato and I don't know if I'm
[23:05] pronouncing that right I I can't
[23:06] pronounce their names at all but uh and
[23:09] then that was a really neat little
[23:11] church up there brother John started
[23:14] that church I don't know if you if you
[23:15] know but John Paducah you've seen him
[23:17] here in the Pulpit but the John has
[23:19] started many churches maybe dozens of
[23:22] churches over the years and he it starts
[23:26] them gets a group of Believers going and
[23:28] and finds a young man that can pasture
[23:30] it and puts him over it and then he
[23:32] moves on and he still pastors his own
[23:34] church and that's what he's done for
[23:36] years he's been a missionary he's been
[23:38] all over Africa in almost every country
[23:40] in Africa with brother Robert Wilson he
[23:43] doesn't travel with brother Robert
[23:44] anymore he's just gotten too old and and
[23:46] he got to come into uh to America some
[23:49] and it softened him up it's amazing how
[23:51] soft we are
[23:53] I'm not I'm soft I I am I actually
[23:57] brother John I preached brother John
[23:58] under uh the the second night on
[24:01] Thursday night or no Friday night at his
[24:03] church first night at his church uh he
[24:05] had we had to trade interpreters because
[24:07] he was about to fall down
[24:09] so but it was so hot and you sweat so
[24:12] much but John's a big band but he told
[24:14] me later he said I've gotten used to it
[24:16] being in America or something he said
[24:18] it's made me soft
[24:20] so we had to trade out for a younger man
[24:22] but I kept going
[24:24] I'm real proud of that if you can't tell
[24:31] um we had our Easter convention Friday
[24:33] through Sunday so I preached Friday
[24:35] night Saturday morning uh Saturday night
[24:38] Sunday morning at brother John paducah's
[24:41] Church there in Loma he had about three
[24:43] or four hundred people that were there
[24:45] uh in in that in those services and it
[24:49] was a real blessing and then uh Sunday
[24:51] evening we went to Pastor Antoine's
[24:53] Church which I've been to before or five
[24:55] years ago but they've changed buildings
[24:57] and that night I was about dead and we
[25:00] had to sit there the way it worked they
[25:02] they said let's have church at five
[25:03] o'clock well nobody in Togo seems to
[25:06] have a watch that's something they seem
[25:09] to need his watches or maybe they don't
[25:11] need them because they're happy without
[25:12] them but they don't show up at five
[25:15] o'clock for a church service they show
[25:17] up at dark for a church service so we
[25:20] waited and five o'clock came and went
[25:21] and I couldn't have preached that
[25:23] service but David did that but I did get
[25:25] up and greet the people afterwards so
[25:27] we're so again I'm so grateful for him
[25:29] being there well the next slide uh
[25:32] brother
[25:33] that's Brother David and myself on the
[25:35] first day that we were there waiting at
[25:37] the hotel uh we get a very nice hotel
[25:39] there in Togo it's one that I've been to
[25:41] before it's where the uh the government
[25:43] officials and stuff stay you have to do
[25:45] that because it's secure they got
[25:47] security and guards and stuff outside
[25:49] it's very important on the rights Pastor
[25:51] John and Pastor Beni at uh pastor
[25:54] benin's church there in lo mein go to
[25:56] the next slide
[25:58] uh this is uh some of what we were
[26:01] eating while we were there
[26:03] um my favorite food in Togo is whole
[26:06] fish well this is not the time of year I
[26:09] guess to get that because over the
[26:10] Easter holidays they they served a lot
[26:12] of fish I was only able to eat this meal
[26:14] once while I was there and it wasn't
[26:16] honestly the best that I've ever had but
[26:18] the fish was really good I put a picture
[26:20] of of uh David's Pizza on there because
[26:23] he ordered pizza but he couldn't he
[26:25] don't speak real good french David's
[26:27] trying to learn French and he was trying
[26:29] to he was ordering pizza and I don't
[26:30] know what you like on your pizza but he
[26:32] just pointed to one and they went and
[26:34] got it and it had Tuna on it
[26:38] he don't eat fish
[26:40] but he ate that pizza because he was
[26:42] hungry
[26:44] it has two things he don't eat tuna and
[26:46] egg yolks and they had tuna and eggs
[26:49] and onions and olives on that pizza
[26:54] it was great
[26:56] so I enjoyed his pizza too I ate about
[26:58] half of it
[27:02] I can eat just about anywhere travel to
[27:03] the next slide this is how the people
[27:05] eat mostly there that's a Street
[27:07] restaurant that's fast food
[27:10] you can see that on the left of the man
[27:13] he just sets up a little stand and he
[27:15] cooks
[27:23] I'm tired of it
[27:25] just be honest with you and I'm I told
[27:27] myself I wouldn't get emotional tonight
[27:29] because I am tired and I'm a little bit
[27:31] vulnerable but
[27:33] I
[27:35] you can't unsee some things
[27:41] you know what you do you end up just you
[27:43] quit looking
[27:45] you just get to the point you can't look
[27:46] out the window anymore brother you know
[27:49] what I'm talking about you've been there
[27:50] and um you you can't look out the window
[27:53] and and see the way that they live you
[27:56] just have to ignore it in order to be
[27:58] able to function because it's so
[28:01] depressing and and I don't think
[28:03] anything about it it's just the way that
[28:05] they live but there's no sewer system no
[28:08] no water ventral water system uh you
[28:12] can't drink the water at all you can't
[28:14] eat anything washed in the water you
[28:17] can't eat and it's just very dirty very
[28:20] dirty
[28:21] public restrooms no private rooms to
[28:24] speak up and accept it but the churches
[28:27] churches and there's trash everywhere
[28:29] just trash everywhere and they actually
[28:33] fill the potholes with trash and I will
[28:36] never complain about a pothole again in
[28:38] my life
[28:39] because but they they've got potholes
[28:42] that swallow cars over there every
[28:45] Street's got them it's just they just
[28:46] keep getting bigger and you drive down
[28:48] you drive into the potholes and drive
[28:50] back up the other side and that's how
[28:53] big they are and uh and eventually if a
[28:55] pothole just gets so bad that they can't
[28:58] drive it anymore they just close the
[28:59] street off you know you just go a
[29:01] different route and uh so the streets
[29:04] are are mud or sand most of the streets
[29:06] that are there so it's a real problem
[29:08] when it rains and um
[29:10] but they're uh but there are people that
[29:13] in the churches I noticed this and it
[29:16] gave me brother Harvey a little bit of
[29:18] uh uh a little bit of encouragement for
[29:20] what we do here that they keep the
[29:22] churches up very nice and the grounds
[29:24] and everything there's no trash there's
[29:26] no uh everything's you know pristine
[29:29] it's dirt most of the floors brother
[29:31] John's got concrete floor most of the
[29:42] and uh I really appreciated that I
[29:45] noticed that this time they really keep
[29:47] up the churches and I think we ought to
[29:49] do that and do the very best we can do
[29:51] to keep up our church and it just made
[29:53] me uh it made me want to mention that to
[29:55] the trustees because I I think if if
[29:58] they can do that and we do you all do a
[30:00] wonderful job but it just gives me a
[30:01] little bit extra uh thought about that
[30:04] keep up and do the best we can do they
[30:07] dress their best to come to church
[30:11] is
[30:18] a few years ago it's the same building
[30:20] they've added some some different things
[30:22] this is just his regular Wednesday night
[30:24] crowd that was there I noticed the first
[30:27] night that I was there that the people
[30:29] were different
[30:31] covet affected Us in ways that we don't
[30:34] know but it didn't affect us
[30:36] in any way like it did them they have an
[30:39] authoritarian government they don't have
[30:41] any rights it's a dictatorship
[30:45] and so they didn't have the ability to
[30:48] to protest over what they do if they
[30:52] protest is they they put snipers on the
[30:56] rooftops and kill them until they leave
[30:58] and uh so they don't they don't protest
[31:02] anymore uh and so what
[31:05] they can do and they would
[31:08] churches
[31:25] afraid
[31:27] and so us go and give them the courage
[31:29] to come and uh and have meetings again
[31:32] and this was the first meeting that I
[31:35] know of there uh in that country since
[31:37] that happened and I I know it was among
[31:39] these people at least and that's pastor
[31:41] benin's church there on Wednesday night
[31:43] but that's what I noticed was the
[31:44] reservation at first and then the Lord
[31:46] really blessed us in that service but it
[31:49] was hard because they hadn't been
[31:50] together and you've got to go to church
[31:53] to be in Revival
[31:55] that's just a fact of life
[31:58] brother random said you can't be as good
[32:00] a Christian and and not go to church and
[32:04] and he's not saying anything prophetic
[32:06] there that's just the truth
[32:08] right right
[32:13] [Laughter]
[32:22] some of you remember this picture this
[32:24] is a picture that I took five years ago
[32:26] as you can tell I was much skinnier
[32:30] uh
[32:32] a baby and I've already given this
[32:35] Facebook but I thought I'd give it to
[32:37] those of you who don't have it tonight
[32:40] um I can't it's the first thing I ever
[32:42] did in Togo was dedicate this baby first
[32:45] thing first service before the service
[32:48] at the beginning when I started to
[32:49] preach held this baby and one other baby
[32:52] and dedicated maybe have a cleft lip
[32:55] it's clip it's lip we just went up and
[32:56] it just disappeared
[32:59] really bad shape
[33:01] and it it bothered me and my wife will
[33:04] tell you it's bothered me for five years
[33:06] I didn't know what happened to that
[33:09] I didn't know what if it could get any
[33:11] medical care I didn't know anything
[33:13] about it
[33:15] after the service
[33:18] Wednesday
[33:49] [Applause]
[34:01] thank you
[34:19] let's talk about it
[34:29] and um it's a by their standards it
[34:33] takes two hours to get there so it's a
[34:35] two-hour drive to go even in a nice
[34:37] vehicle
[34:40] it's a mining town they have a a mining
[34:44] operation that they run there the
[34:45] government does and and mine are the
[34:47] Earth so it's kind of odd they got red
[34:50] clay a red dirt man there and even the
[34:53] floors made out of that you go to the
[34:55] next side this is a congregation there's
[34:56] again the church
[35:00] in that church and the congregation
[35:03] there was they don't ever get to see
[35:05] anybody from America so they were very
[35:07] pleased to get to see that and they
[35:10] gathered together those are all just
[35:11] their local people uh if you go to the
[35:14] next slide
[35:16] and that night
[35:19] [Laughter]
[35:23] and I always enjoyed preaching that in
[35:26] Africa because of those are Simon's
[35:28] children and that's how I prayed for
[35:30] that baby by the way the way brother
[35:31] Branham prayed for the blind girl when
[35:34] he said that he said this
[35:36] assignments
[35:58] there
[36:01] actually
[36:08] uh anyway it may not be but maybe
[36:11] related but anyway he was sharp look at
[36:14] those clothes they dress up to go to
[36:16] church and dress their kids up and it's
[36:18] really neat to see how they love those
[36:21] clothes and by the way I didn't bring it
[36:22] tonight I have a full suit of that
[36:26] it's brighter colors it's purple
[36:29] but it's I have an African suit now and
[36:33] one of these days I'll work up the
[36:34] courage to wear
[36:37] before one of the differences and they
[36:41] come in into the office and there's a
[36:43] tailor there in the church
[36:48] David and they gave us a suit of clothes
[36:51] and then he gave me an extra shirt as
[36:53] well so I have two uh two shirts and a
[36:55] suit so I I can I can look just like an
[36:59] African it'll look just like them with
[37:01] that
[37:09] this is uh
[37:20] [Laughter]
[37:30] we did it
[37:46] some people are eating
[37:50] pay your ties and offerings and things
[37:53] sometimes I heard of what I use in the
[37:56] mission part of what I used to go on so
[37:58] I want to thank you for that
[38:01] foreign
[38:35] I just freaking
[38:39] uh that's a picture
[38:49] and when it rains in Togo it pours you
[38:52] know that's the old saying but it does
[38:54] it's tropical country and it was very
[38:57] hot temperatures compared to 106 degrees
[39:00] when I was there 106 humidity you're
[39:04] preaching in that
[39:06] so that's what we had to do uh probably
[39:09] good for me
[39:10] everything
[39:16] is
[39:29] true
[39:49] it's like a monster truck bed it's
[39:51] probably four foot four foot but it's
[39:59] well
[40:01] I'm serious about 10 or 12. they're
[40:04] getting on this bike they're they're
[40:06] stacking on
[40:09] Church
[40:10] they're gonna drive back in the rain I'm
[40:14] not I'm not saying this tonight to make
[40:15] you feel bad you guys do good and come
[40:18] to church
[40:24] in the pouring rain and on on Friday
[40:28] night and we were going to have church
[40:30] at 10 o'clock in the morning and uh at
[40:33] actually nine o'clock
[40:55] go to church
[40:59] than we do
[41:02] it
[41:04] don't go just because there's nothing
[41:06] else to do I could find something to do
[41:09] to go to church because they're hungry
[41:11] they want to hear the word of the Lord
[41:14] these people were going on Saturday
[41:16] morning on our way to church and I
[41:18] noticed
[41:27] pictures
[41:45] inside the church
[41:51] online
[41:58] so I thank you
[42:00] the next side you see a picture of the
[42:02] congregation on Saturday or Sunday
[42:04] at the church you can see of the inside
[42:08] and there's one of us preaching as well
[42:10] the next one
[42:12] catch up with me there
[42:14] there's a preaching and then pretty much
[42:16] brother Antoine's Church
[42:22] thank you sitting there preparing the
[42:26] young man Was preparing to preach and
[42:28] while we were there we got attacked by
[42:30] flies there was some kind of little
[42:31] black
[42:32] and of course it's in the open and it
[42:35] had rained and so all the bugs woke up
[42:38] and the stink the smell you don't
[42:40] realize the smell until it rains
[42:47] this
[42:50] is
[42:53] going outside of that church go to the
[42:55] next slide
[42:57] that's inside of the Antoine's Church
[42:59] very nice church for there but you can
[43:01] see the dirt floor and uh
[43:04] they love their drums
[43:08] and some of these people even drums you
[43:11] can take them I got some videos for them
[43:13] because they really won't believe in
[43:14] drones when I get done showing them what
[43:16] they do in Africa
[43:17] but it comes from their heart
[43:20] and
[43:26] five years ago
[43:28] he uh he don't drive he can't see uh
[43:32] very well but he he and so five years
[43:35] ago he drove me uh at night we ran into
[43:39] a building he drove me from his church
[43:42] back to
[43:43] more
[43:49] um this uh against on the next slide
[43:52] this is a Brothers I want to show you
[43:53] this because the little brother on the
[43:56] investor Bruno from Benin uh
[43:59] they drove six hours or came by bus six
[44:01] hours on Monday to see us because they
[44:05] want us to come to Benin at some point
[44:07] I've been there
[44:09] for them with brother Ivy and they drove
[44:12] all the way just to eat lunch with us
[44:13] and see us on Monday and so that's what
[44:16] we did on Monday and while we were
[44:18] resting getting ready to come back on
[44:19] Tuesday and uh so the Lord be with those
[44:22] Brothers those are wonderful brothers
[44:23] Brother Bruno is a taxi driver for a
[44:25] living he drives a motorbike taxi is
[44:28] what he does and so I wanted to include
[44:30] that as well
[44:32] why did we go
[44:35] we had a prayer line as well on Saturday
[44:38] night prayed for almost all of those
[44:39] people
[44:41] I believe there'd be miracles from that
[44:46] we went I already explained to you what
[44:48] had happened with covet the people were
[44:49] so afraid brother John told me he said
[44:52] you don't know what this means he said
[44:53] to be the first time in all in three
[44:55] years we've been able to meet because
[44:56] that's their life that's what they love
[44:58] to do it's a crucial time for Africa
[45:03] this was called to my attention
[45:06] I hope I'm not boring you tonight
[45:08] this was called to my attention
[45:10] on the flight back
[45:13] I
[45:14] we came in to pass security because you
[45:17] gotta go through security 15 times in
[45:19] Africa and none of it's any good but
[45:22] anyway you go through the security and
[45:24] finally get to the final security and
[45:26] you're at your gate we got through
[45:28] security and I looked over and there was
[45:30] a a preacher there that I knew who used
[45:35] to be a message preacher and he had
[45:38] preached a convention and gone on the
[45:39] same weekend that I preached in Togo
[45:42] and after 50 more than 50 trips to
[45:46] Africa to preach the message of those
[45:48] people he was now going back to Africa
[45:51] to persuade them to leave the message
[45:54] and that may not be his stated purpose
[45:56] but that's what he was doing there is
[45:58] what he does with his life now
[46:01] leave the message
[46:03] and after all of those times and I was
[46:06] we were on the flight with him coming
[46:09] back I shook his hand and uh and Brother
[46:13] David talked to him a little bit
[46:15] but it really hit me really hit me
[46:19] because this is a crucial time for them
[46:22] those people are going
[46:24] and they're letting it be known that uh
[46:28] you know their Gospel of what they're
[46:30] preaching and they're going into message
[46:31] churches because that's the context that
[46:33] they have and slowly
[46:47] [Laughter]
[46:54] messages
[46:59] [Laughter]
[47:05] across
[47:08] the Border I didn't know it it's a
[47:11] crucial Time Forever
[47:13] somebody knows what they're talking I
[47:15] don't say that I do but I'll say this
[47:18] I'll stand for this message
[47:20] and somebody needed to stand for this
[47:22] message in Africa
[47:26] they just really drove home to me
[47:28] because they're going we need to be
[47:30] going
[47:31] what do we believe in
[47:33] what do we believe in what do we spend
[47:35] our time on and again we we need to be
[47:38] we need to be making sure that we spend
[47:41] our time on the correct things so false
[47:43] teachers will go Paul says this can I
[47:45] have five more minutes
[47:49] thank you for bearing with me tonight
[47:52] Paul says for I know this that after my
[47:54] departing shall Grievous was
[48:02] awesome
[48:07] always
[48:10] after them
[48:12] men who should know better men with
[48:14] great Ministries
[48:26] we have a message
[48:30] there's a reason why we're here
[48:38] I need to stand for it I need to believe
[48:41] it you need to take sides with Jesus
[48:45] can I just tell you that tonight before
[48:46] we go we need to take signs with Jesus I
[48:49] listen to that tape on the way back
[48:51] and I want to report
[49:02] to try to belittle him in the side of
[49:05] the people that's what these men are
[49:07] doing today
[49:08] that's what the Devils tries to do to
[49:10] you he tries to find every little Shadow
[49:12] he can find to belittle the word and he
[49:16] is the word in this house
[49:18] brother Branham and I explained this to
[49:20] the African people the brother Brandon
[49:21] was not crying but the word is Christ
[49:31] sometimes
[49:43] that is because
[49:51] a man
[50:01] [Laughter]
[50:19] Real Men of God
[50:21] talk like men of God
[50:24] excuse me act like men of God live like
[50:27] men of God
[50:29] dude it's not just
[50:32] because
[50:38] to devour what he can
[50:42] why
[50:48] that's the reason they tried little him
[50:49] yes they were jealous of his ministry
[50:52] right
[51:00] belittle him make everything
[51:03] like
[51:06] they
[51:07] wanted the people to denounce it
[51:12] internet today
[51:15] it's not just
[51:18] yeah they're sending missionaries
[51:21] they wanted to say now this guy is
[51:23] nothing looky here now there
[51:26] you know that's not right
[51:28] we've been out all our life that we
[51:29] should Builders and here he is
[51:39] foreign
[51:54] I wish I had a voice I'd preached
[51:56] tonight
[51:57] the ones that believed him how many
[51:59] believe him tonight
[52:01] the ones that believed him and loved him
[52:05] and had seen his scriptural Miracle
[52:09] signs would not be hindered by them
[52:13] no sir them who believed him believed
[52:17] him
[52:18] those who loved him how many loved him
