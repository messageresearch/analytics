Lord believe your word and I believe that's what we're called to do here Lord and we just we're standing here Lord just have your way and everything that's said and done in Jesus name amen amen you love him amen let's turn the scriptures to Hebrews 11. 4 hey man I just want to speak on worship under Redemption and amen the price of redemption has been paid amen amen Hebrews 11 4. if by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous and God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh amen you can be seated this morning amen this as I said um just wanna it's our title worship under Redemption the the price of redemption has been paid I mean these thoughts were just kind of coming to to me as we drove here this morning amen and there are Redemption claims that have been made the price has been paid I mean they're also Redemption claims that have been made amen upon you and I amen and we are we are nearing amen the the fullness of redemption amen the price has already been paid 2 000 years ago it was paid um it's taken care of Amen but there comes a fullness a time of fullness of the fullness of redemption and we're living and worshiping under the fullness of the word amen under the fullness of the atonement and man nothing amen we're not shorted anything in in this age I mean everything has been provided amen and we're coming we're coming and we're living under that fullness of the word the fullness of redemption amen and true revelation will bring bring a true worship amen and where where we live we amen where we live believe and worship Amen in faith as the redeemed as the blood-bought Sons and Daughters of God amen I'm going to try to keep my voice this morning try to hang on to it as best I can just take my time here I'd love to love to get sideways here this morning and shout and preach hard but I'm not going to do that okay I'll try try not to amen so we're living in faith as a redeemed amen amen in it you know this true Revelation amen it brings a true worship and it brings brings you into a the word brings us into a true spiritual relationship with God and that's what we want in this hour amen where we are a made new creatures in Christ amen and that's that's the goal a man of of preaching the word and trying to help people and you know and to be filled with the spirit amen live according to you that's why we're here amen hey man that's what we want to see that's what a man we want to as a church as a as a people of God as as caretakers of the word as as as mothers and fathers we want to see those that we love those that we care about to come to that because that's the goal Amen to to be new creatures to be filled with the Holy Ghost and live according to his word amen as he shows us and so Abel as we read and Abel amen offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice amen he sacrificed and worshiped by faith he worshiped amen under or from the Revelation that he received from God and that's all we can do that's all anybody can do amen what what God would show you amen that's what you believed that that's all you can believe right what he shows you and what he allows you to see amen and and I just think of all that he's allowed us to see all that he showed us amen and what we're living under amen and what he has showed us in this hour amen we ought to be a grateful people amen he hasn't just given us a little portion or just a a certain amen but he's open the fullness of the thing to us every bit amen every uh no loose sin has been left undone everything has been shown to us in this hour feminine is here for us to partake of and so so Abel from his heart amen from the Revelation and from his heart he he sacrificed and he did these things and his life was an expression of what God revealed to him I mean he lived he lived what he believed he identified himself with the Revelation he identified himself with that sacrifice that he brought forth amen he was committed he was all in on it amen he he identified himself with that and there amen he identified himself and God himself gave witness and testified that his sacrifice was accepted amen he accepted his faith right and that's that's what God that you know you can believe God and you know you can you can you know that'll that'll take you so far but God has to accept your faith he has to testify amen amen and that's what the Holy Ghost is amen where God comes down and then he seals you off he accepts your faith I mean he accepts amen amen that you believe in him and he comes down by the Holy Ghost and testifies of your life amen so God testified amen that he was accepted that he was righteous amen and to be righteous is to be to be upright to be to be one who keeps God's Commandments keeps his word amen amen to be right to be right with God that's what righteous means I mean is that what you want in this hour amen I want to be accepted of God Amen I want to be accepted I Want My Worship to be accepted to him amen I don't want to just live haphazardly amen just bring whatever amen but I want I want I want to keep his word I want to keep his Commandments I want to be pleasing to him I want to be accepted amen with my creator with my Lord and brother Brown says here in the results of a decision he said Cain and Abel both of them worshiped in the beginning Cain built an altar and so did Abel Cain worshiped and so did Abel Cain wasn't in Infidel but built an altar and they brought a sacrifice they done everything they they could do do both of them why was Abel accepted because Abel was spiritual minded it was revealed to Abel that it wasn't fruits and apples that brought us out of the Garden of Eden it was blood and he offered the blood of a lamb by spiritual Revelation and then he says and Jesus said that he would build his church on the spiritual Revelation and so here these two brothers in the beginning not too far removed amen from Eden not too far removed from from that eaten condition Amen in there back in Eden before the fall we look and we see where where Adam was called of the Earth God had made him a secondary God and and there he's described brother he described as the as the god of the earth and then they're in that condition it was a perfection amen there was only life there was perfect peace perfect Joy amen God's creation was in Perfect Harmony I mean everything was was as it should be and then and that's that's that's a true Eden amen and and I believe we can have that here this morning I believe we can have that here within our lives and that's what we want to want to try to preach if we can that God is has has brought us back to that and and you may not fully see exactly what what Adam and Eve what they lived in but but we're going back to that that's what we're trying to get back to hey man we we we don't have to live in confusion we don't have to live in in disruption of constant disruption amen but there's a peace here this morning there's a peace amen for the believer amen if we'll come amen come God's provided way so everything was as it should be I mean it was so perfect and so pleasing to God that he rested in his Works he was so satisfied with it and what he had created and man it was it was beautiful it was beautiful it was perfect it was unblemished right and that's what we're coming back to I mean everything was as it should be amen and brother Brown describes he said God would come down in that sacred that sacred light he would come down there in the cool of the evening and there under the Cathedral of the heavens and in the canopy of of the palm trees and and the woods there and the forest he would come and he would have Fellowship he would have he would have Fellowship he he would commune and and talk with Adam and Eve amen and that that's what we were designed to be that's what we were made for that's what man was made for in the beginning that for for God to have somebody to fellowship with and then even Adam Adam walked the Earth alone and God saw that man was lonely brother Isaac he saw that he was lonely amen and and there he he provided him a mate amen he provided him a maiden God himself that that was expressed in God Amen God was lonely he dwelt with his thoughts and then he had the Angels there to worship Him amen but he wanted someone in his own end but someone in his own likeness I mean that he could come down and live in amen Adam there God of the Earth but that's what man was made for Amen to worship and commune and have fellowship with God Amen that's why we're here amen this morning is to commune with him Amen to talk with him Amen to to tell him all about it amen to tell him our needs amen and then then him in return he can come and tell us what he wants us to be tell us what he wants us to do give us Direction amen amen be the bring a calm in our lives Amen in the disruption and the and the confusion of the sage and the evil spirits that are that are that we have to walk amongst or walk amongst and live in amen he said calm amen he'll come in that he'll come in Satan's Eden amen he'll come in the time that you and I live in amen there will be an eating condition amen amen a calm amen a peace amen a fellowship with him amen it was so perfect so God he would come down there in the cool of the evening but and then so because here of the Fall amen where Eve listened to the LIE of Satan amen he had only Twisted one word and Eve he fell for his lie and the Bible says that Adam being not deceived in the transgression but he stepped out and he took Eve's sin upon himself is that right and then he went against what God had commanded them not to do and there the condemnation fell upon them and they hid themselves from God In His holy presence and brother Brown says here in the message of Grace he said there come Jehovah down like a roar of Thunder walking through the garden crying Adam Where Art Thou and that's when Adam realized he was naked and had sinned before God he hid himself tried to make himself a religion but it didn't work amen so he says here but God killed some Sheep amen I wish I could preach here this morning amen God killed some sheep took the skins and showed that something had to die to cover sin and he goes on to say he says there's joining church will never cover sin no dried confession will ever cover sin it takes us sorrow and repentance and the grace of God Amen to cover sin for the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed at Calvary to cover sin and there how how the prophet described it them walking out with with tears in their eyes covered in in sheepskins amen mixed with her tears amen God had come down himself God had come down himself and provided a sacrifice for his children I mean they tried to do it on their own but God it wasn't pleasing to him it wasn't what God required so God himself come down and he and he killed the Sheep amen and amen they didn't just kill the Sheep amen but they they clothed themselves in the very skins of that sacrifice they were they were covered from head to toe and there brother Brown describes it he says that they're they're tears dripping down them them walking out of the garden and he said I can hear I can hear those sheepskin slapping their skins and it describes it so real to us amen that blood dripping from their bodies because of what they had done they had to be covered amen God required a sacrifice he required a blood a man of an innocent one and so God Amen God 's seen this those sheepskins them walking out in this condition and as they walked out there amen here brother Ramses Cobbs it says he who had no beginning amen the god of the heavens there he's seen them walking out in that condition and there he he come down he come down and amen in the amen and the the atmosphere and the things and amen and God come down there he he dwelts alone he had no form amen but he would come down there amen and he funneled down to them amen no doubt in the form of that light amen there amen everything just came together and there he's seen his children as they walked through the garden amen where once there was Perfect Harmony and fellowship amen God himself couldn't stand it he couldn't stand to see it but it was expressing God Amen God allowed it to happen that he could be expressed amen amen God will allow things to happen he'll allow things happen in your life amen just so he can come and express himself to you amen but there he couldn't see he couldn't stand it and he called back to them as they were walking out and then they had to leave this perfect this perfect place and there there he called to them as they walked out and he said I will put enmity between you your seed and the Serpent's Seed amen and he made a promise a man of a coming Messiah of one that would come Amen in the head of that serpent would be bruised amen and he will bruise your heel amen he would be able to bring Affliction upon you amen he would be allowed to do that but also that his Works amen would be destroyed amen that that word there bruising means to destroy man amen amen the head of the serpent amen will be crushed but man because he had partaken of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he had to be cut off from from accessing the tree of life and you just be patient with me this morning that's trying to take my time I'm not a big storyteller this is just what I had on my heart amen so because they had partaken amen of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil they had to be cut off from from the Tree of Life from accessing him Genesis 3 and 23 and says therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from once it was taken they had to leave but so and then verse 24 so he drove out the man any place at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life and brother Brown said what is that tree of life he said he said that was Christ amen that was that was that eternal life that that Adam and Eve amen if they wouldn't have partaken of the other tree man they would have lived they would have lived eternally but they stepped out of that right they stepped out of that amen he said if they wouldn't if the fall wouldn't have happened we would have all just came forth we would have been spoken to exist and we would have come into existence just the names amen just the Sons and Daughters of God the thoughts of God amen but they stepped out of that that tree was crossed that tree was life to them it was it was it was what made Eden Eden right but also what what made Eden was them being there also it wasn't the same and then questions and answers brother Branham says here he says the Garden of Eden was east east in Eden the east side of Eden and the cherubims was placed in the tree of life was at the East Gate of the garden he said and that's where I think Cain and Abel made their sacrifice and that's where the cherubim with the Flaming sword wouldn't let them come in anymore east of the gate so he said he describes he believed that this is where they came and made their sacrifice could you imagine could you imagine standing there perhaps and and they weren't too far from removed from from all these events time Tom had only transpired just so long but maybe you know if you lived seven eight nine hundred years you know it seemed like an eternity I'm kind of glad we don't have to live that that long especially as bad as things are right now but I don't know what at at what point in their life that they realize that they needed to come bring a sacrifice they needed to come worship but because you imagine they're perhaps being what they had been taught by Adam and Eve that just a just a little further past this gate there was the Tree of Life but they could only they could only come so far to it they were cut off they're the the cherubims the Angels there with the Flaming sword guarding the way back to the Tree of Life they had been cut off man had been cut off they're just beyond that gate was life Amen in just a short span of time that man man didn't face death he didn't face sickness he didn't face sorrow he didn't feel condemnation but they both they both came back as far back and as close as they could to the Garden where the tree of life was but they were only they were only allowed to come so far amen but there was something in them that that wanted to worship amen and God God's created man to worship something God created God created a man to worship him but man man amen sometimes don't rightly know what to worship so he'll he'll almost worship anything Amen in different cultures they have different gods and and different things and I don't understand a lot about that amen but you even come in the religious world of this day and there's so many different versions of what God is there's so many different versions of who Jesus Is Right and then you come down even in what we believe there's so many there's so many different ideas amen amen but there's one God that can come and change a person's life and when there's one God Amen and we've seen him so revealed in this age amen there's one God that could come down and an imperfection and then reveal the secrets of the heart amen amen the son of man amen being revealed to you and I man we were able to identify it wasn't a Baptist Jesus it wasn't a Pentecostal Jesus amen but it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen I don't just want to worship amen my own concept of what he is amen but I want to worship that Living God Amen the one amen that'll come down and change a person's life amen amen you can't fake that Satan cannot impersonate that he can impersonate all kinds of emotions all kinds of all kinds of gifts amen but he cannot impersonate that life amen in my Jesus amen this gospel this word amen that we have received that we've been pointed back to amen this gospel that we have been restored to amen is a life-changing gospel amen from what I've experienced amen amen that's that's the God that I want to I want to point people to amen not a not some church not some idea I mean because God didn't displace his name anywhere amen God placed his name in his son amen what is the name of the father it is the Lord Jesus Christ their God Amen identified his beloved Son amen and here's ye him this morning hear ye him amen not not some man not some Creed not some idea not what some church says amen but here's ye him amen everything will pass away amen everything will will go away everything will fall amen but the son of man amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen so ma'am here they come to worship as we said man's going to worship something amen because it's in us to worship it's it's in us to do that and so here in Genesis 4 3 and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord so there came built his altar his church amen it was beautiful brother Brown describes him amen he Brethren said he was so sincere amen said he even said that he wanted to be saved I think of that and he said that'll choke some of you he said but even even Cain wanted to be saved he wanted to be right he knew that he was lost and he wanted to find favor with God and I I try not to talk about television programs but the chosen and how Judas came and I I think it's so so good how they depict him that he he starts out we know what his end is but he starts out wanting to be right wanting to follow God wanting to do something for God and no doubt this is how this is how Cain Cain was he had within within him every good intention Amen to do what was right to worship and find favor with God to do everything he could to bring everything he could offer and then he worshiped he prayed he went to church he he paid his tithes he did everything and then a regular uh good church member would do it but he tried to cover himself just as Adam and Eve did with their own covering amen and in trying to figure it out and then he became confused he became amen he became rejected and then he thought he thought he thought they ate an apple or it could have been something like that he wasn't real sure just in my own words here he wasn't real sure so he just you know he just piled on Amen one of everything they tried to offer his own idea and his own wisdom he tried to bring his own own works well I well I I think this is what God wants all right I think he'd be okay with this so he so he added some flowers you know he was a tiller of the ground he he grew all these fruits and these flowers and and everything that you could think of all these all these beautiful things so we added some flowers and he dressed it up he tried to make it as beautiful as he could and that was in his nature to to want beautiful things like that and even added his own special doctrine that he could only see there so he he added some some pumpkins and gourds you know just add a little bit here and there and try to make it pretty much try to make it acceptable as acceptable as I know how to do and so he he added some pumpkins and some gourds me just describing here this I didn't find this in the message anywhere so y'all this is just me you take it for what it is so maybe he had taken a quote or two from Adam amen and maybe some personal testimonies for me pieced it all together he really felt like he had it all figured out I mean and he tried to present it he tried to present his own theology his own idea of the thing his own his own Doctrine and no doubt Amen to the regular eye was so beautiful but being the son of the devil that was his nature for Satan wanted a more beautiful kingdom a more greater Kingdom than that of Michael he wanted his own kingdom he wanted to bring his own thing and that's the difference in in The Believer that's the difference in the seed of God I believe and the serpent seat is is we don't have anything to bring amen when we when you come to God there's nothing that you can bring there's nothing that you can do amen any there's nothing that you can even understand you just have to surrender yourself to it you can't even explain it yourself amen but because we are his seed he won't lose a one amen and I can tell you that when I was first Saved I I can't remember what was preached but I knew that I came and I came in and I knew that I needed God I knew that I needed something and all I could do was Just Surrender amen my whole life to him there was nothing I could bring to him in my condition and as a seed of God that's there's nothing that we can do we just have to come to him amen amen there's nothing that we can do we were designed him into worship God we were designed to depend upon God fully and completely amen he wanted his own kingdom he wanted his own way so Genesis 4 4 and Abel he also brought of the of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering and here Here Comes Sable to the to the East Gate of Eden the cherubims the angels are there with a flaming sword guarding the Tree of Life there he comes I mean he he he himself can only go so far he himself can only can only come just he could only Come Just As far as Cain did and there brother Brown describes as there the Angels the the presence of God is there and there he comes as far as he could and and there he builds his altar amen he too has been cut off from from that perfect condition amen and and in him is a desire to be right in him is a desire to worship God and then because that's what he was created to be but amen there's a hunger there was a hunger and a thirst in him amen that only Jehovah could satisfy only that presence could satisfy amen he didn't have any Works to bring of of his self amen amen God Amen he didn't create that lamb God provided that lamb that he would bring amen he didn't he didn't bring it from the ground amen but God provided that lamb God provided that revelation amen God hasn't provided a place of worship amen this morning for his people he's provided everything that we have need of God has a provided sacrifice this morning amen he has everything that we have need of he has provided and brother Brown says here he says but here comes Abel dragging a little old lamb behind him I mean he said I don't see nothing pretty about that and he said I can see he gets he had a Vine maybe wrapped it around his neck he said because it was cross that's who it was for they led him like a lamb to the slaughter him and they put a rope around his neck and here he come leading this little lamb bleeding pulling back and then he laid him there on a rock he said perhaps they didn't have any sharp knives in them days probably took an old sharp Rock and held his little head back there and began to to beat his little throat amen able to see he said in the blood amen this is kind of graphic but he said the blood began to spurt out of his little arteries in his neck imminence he said did you ever hear a lamb dying it's the most pathetic thing you ever heard of sahir lamb die how it bleeds and it beats hey remember this this is what God was wanting this is what God was wanting amen God looking down he said God looking down from heaven said that's what it takes he said the blood speaking amen what did it speak of preach with me this morning what did the blood speak of because the blood has a voice the blood has a voice of the very blood of Abel the Bible says when when Cain slew him that very blood cried out from the ground and he said in this Blood this blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things than that of Abel so what does it speak of this morning hey man what does it speak of it spoke of a lamb of God that would come and be led away to Calvary amen it was a shadow of what was to come amen it wasn't exactly what God wanted fully but God would accept that that that gold That Dying lamb that Abel brought but God had something in his mind greater something that would be amen of the full effect amen that would abolish everything that Satan had done it spoke of one that would come and defeat the Devil and Conquer every sin for you and I that away we wouldn't have to do it ourselves but he would come amen that's what that sacrifice testified of that's what the voice of the blood spoke through that amen the blood and we are the blood of our mother and father we are the blood of every generation of every one that's come before us and and brother Brandon describes how the plan he brought this one together and that one together amen and and how predestinated it was and and forethought out by God he brought this one and this one because he had to get us here somehow but through this one and that one amen through that blood and and through the things they had done and the things they had developed over over these thousands of years amen that it took to bring you and I hear every bit of that every bit of the bad every bit of the bat has been passed down to you and I amen but the blood speaks amen of of taking that away it speaks of overcoming power and grace and mercy amen for the believer amen he had to get you here somehow amen so every bad trait every every potential habit that you have laying down within you every weakness that you have hidden down within you it was passed down and it was passed down and it was passed down remember that's the blood of your mother and father that's the blood of your ancestors amen that's the blood of the ones that were brought together to bring you here amen but the blood of the Lamb speaks of something different Eminem being born again you become the blood of God Amen the blood of Christ will annihilate your sin it would uh it will destroy your weaknesses it will destroy those complexes of things amen that you were that you're here to overcome and when the blood speaks of that this morning he testifies and it speaks amen of our Lord Jesus a man who defeated death hell on the grave preach with me this morning help me help me I don't know how much more voice I've got but help me this morning amen Jesus didn't die amen so you could be bound he didn't die so you could remain sick amen he didn't die so you could remain unhappy and defeated and and weak and and feeble amen but he died he defeated death Hell In The Grave he defeated overcome every sin for you and I that's what the blood speaks of this morning that's what it has provided for you and I that's what the that's what the sacrifice of Abel it was prophesying that it would come it would take many years but it come they come in the fullness of Jesus Christ that you could be healed this morning that you could go away from here healed this morning that you don't have to put up with that devil you don't have to deal with that sickness you don't have to deal amen with that thing amen just your whole life amen but you can have victory over here this morning and manifest God's will for you to be healed amen amen it testifies that blood testifies that we can be clean that we can be pure that we can be washed amen it testifies that you this morning amen you that need it you can be filled with the Holy Ghost amen it provided that amen and sealed into his kingdom and speaks it speaks of a return it speaks of a return to Edom amen where we're going back to what Adam lost you believe that this morning amen I don't know what else to believe I don't know I don't know what else what else to believe amen we we needed the blood we needed a sacrifice amen and Jesus came he offered himself amen that you could believe in him I love preaching about Jesus as simple we just hope sometimes we just don't hardly do it enough we don't do it like we should but the sacrifices available this morning it's available for you and I amen amen your faith can touch him this morning your faith can Touch the Hem of His Garment amen amen your faith can move amen amen the one that's interceding there on the throne for you and I this morning they're that sacrifice ladies and brother Branham he says here I thought this was this was good the only way Abel was accepted and only way he was any different was that something was revealed to him and that's that's what sets God's seed and his sons and daughters apart because God can reveal to them his will and his provided way now I believe this morning amen we're worshiping amen under the fullness of his word do you believe that and in the fullness of the word has come amen and we're worshiping under that I realized it this morning realize what's been provided for you this morning realize what God's trying to bring us to and amen what God's trying to do in your life amen the completion amen we're worshiping under that that Redemption the completion of what God had in his mind Amen in the work amen in the work of redemption is finished up in this age amen we're going all the way back and then the Malachi 4 the word restored us back to that our original Pentecostal church amen that original Apostolic Faith amen by Brothers we're going back further than that we're going all the way back to Eden amen we're going all the way back to that Perfection amen of what God had in his mind for you and I amen and that's what God that's how God sees you this morning he sees you through the blood the blood's speaking this morning it's their interceding on your behalf on your ignorance this morning on my ignorance is it's interceding on my mistakes and my failures amen God sees you through the blood he sees you that Perfection and that it speaks of and we're going we're going all the way back amen amen Redemption was paid for it calvary amen but we live in the age of the fullness of redemption amen where we're going to be changed hey man we're going to go back to what was in God's mind so the Revelation is what sets us apart we're not any better amen everybody a lot of people that want to be right but God Amen be thankful this morning that you can receive his word amen we didn't receive a man in the sorrow but we received the word amen for this age we didn't receive just a man we received that message and brother Brown says here I'm sorry Matthew 11 25. and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee your father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent has revealed them to babes amen even soul fathers so it seemed good in thy side and all things are delivered verse 27 all things are delivered unto me of my father no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him amen so it's not what you can learn it's not what you can it's not what anybody can even tell you it's not what flesh and blood can tell you but it's to whom the son will reveal himself First Corinthians 1 19 for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent amen what God calls foolish the world world calls great and what the world calls crazy and foolish God calls great amen Jesus Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail and so if the Revelation is in you this morning it can never fail amen if you just relying on your head knowledge or or what you've been able to bring that's going to pass away in your own wisdom amen and what you can what you can muster up and what you can figure out amen but if the Revelation is there if you've brought in amen it will never pass away amen amen because it is the word amen the word of God in you amen everything will else will perish everything will be destroyed but that will remain Amen in the revelations what sets us apart this morning it makes the elect and the chosen people of God different and brother Brown says here it was a revelation that Abel had that made him just he had a revelation of the requirement of almighty God he brought a lamb and that's the only way you'll ever see Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by Revelation amen we don't know these things you don't know Jesus amen by the flesh amen we can't even come close to that we're two thousand years apart from him from him being in the flesh and knowing him that way amen but it takes a revelation it takes a revelation from God Amen to reveal to you who he is amen it takes it takes a revelation from God to make the thing real to you we can understand and we we can look and we can see and we can read amen before to be real to you amen for it to be Faith to you for it to be bread and to be life it's got to be revealed to you amen if God's revealed to you this morning that you can be healed claim your healing this morning claim whatever you have need of this morning amen everything's yours this morning everything is ours this morning amen the word has been revealed this morning let it become bread to you let it become life to you let it let it come from from head knowledge down to the heart and then when you can believe from the heart that is what becomes manifested that's when it becomes life when it comes down into that inner man into that conscience amen we can read we can understand we can hear what the intellect and that's what that's what Cain tried to bring amen but it wasn't good enough it wouldn't hold up amen but when something anchors down once something's revealed to you you'll stand on it you'll believe it nobody can talk you out of an amen God's my healer God's my savior God's My Redeemer amen and then God in your life will testify that amen you'll be identified with it and then you'll you'll come with your sacrifice you'll come with what God has has told you the God will come down and witness that amen and he says here in 1965 the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there's no other way to know God only by Revelation to whom the son will reveal him Revelation is everything is revelation Amen brother Rome said Revelation is is more important to us than we realize right Christ is the mystery of God revealing he said look Christ and you makes him the center of the Revelation The Sinner of life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible amen the complete revelation of Christ and Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do he said what is the new birth then he said well brother bran what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and then it's made life to you it's made real to you the whole complete thing amen that's what the new birth is and he said and then brother Roman says that go on to say in that message he says we've got the devil's answer we've got the devil's answer chose this question he said what is it he said it's Christ and you the hope of glory it's the resurrected Jesus Christ hey Minister resurrected one that overcame death hell on the grave amen you've been quickened amen by the Revelation to that life you've been quickened Amen in the New Birth has changed you it's made you a different person amen you're you're completely different than what you were amen because it's Jesus Christ it's a revelation of him of everything he is of everything that he does for you it's in you and then that Revelation the new birth amen when you're born again and when you're born again you're just a babe in Christ when you start out but that which is inside you that Revelation everything you have need of is within you every bit of healing everything you have need of rapturing faith is within you and it only takes time it only takes the course of your life and what God allows and that revelation of that new bird will Express healing in your life it will express everything you have need of for every part of the journey we won't make it without the new birth we won't make it without him coming in and changing us completely and so then you may not see it you may not understand it and as we said as time goes on as your life goes on it will be expressed whatever you have need of will be there because he is our everything he's he's our all in all amen so we got he said we got the answer to the devil's question it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen it's Christ in you the hope of glory the resurrected Lord Jesus living in the church amen gaining preeminence is backing up people amen amen the Satan Devils that he defeated he's going to come in you again amen and walk and live in you amen and he's going to give you strength he's going to give you courage he's going to give you ability he's going to give you everything that you have need of amen so we can walk unconscious this morning of fear we can walk unconscious amen a failure this morning if we really just let loose and he says in the New Birth brings you back to what Adam lost right in the fundamental foundation for Faith and I'll try to try to wind it down here the fundamental foundation for Faith he said now when God made man in the beginning he made him Superior to anything on the earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on Earth to control everything so he he had dominion over over all life over everything every animal every plant every tree every every element He had control and jurisdiction over that but the New Birth the new births he says brings you back to that and that's what we we want to try to understand here today and we've been brought back and then we're going we're going back even even further than where we are now amen amen we're going back to Perfection we don't see it just quite clearly we don't just see it quite fully amen but but it's happened it's began and there's nothing that can stop it right we're going back to that so he was made amen amen he was made the god of the Earth the second the secondary god of the Earth he controlled everything around he controlled everything brother Ram said I mean he controlled the atmospheres around him and he walked in perfect love and perfect faith in a perfect fellowship with his creator there was nothing in between him and God Amen and that was that was man's original condition and that's why you were designed to be that's what you were designed to be it wasn't just for Adam it wasn't just for Eve and then we can't never go back to that and we got to live in constant sorrow and and disruption and and confusion no we were meant to we were meant to be that and that's what God's trying to that's what God's trying to show in this age amen and Satan's eating amen there will be a people amen with a need and condition in their life amen amen everything may be going wrong but they've got to calm in the storm they've got a piece amen God of Faith amen because of the one amen that came in their life and brought a perfect love brought a perfect peace amen he brought us from from the old monk amen and it was love that done that and it created I mean it created a confidence in us and we can believe our God we can believe Amen in this word amen and we can begin to create an atmosphere around us say man no matter what's happening no matter what's going on no matter how how stupid things get how ignorant and and just evil things get and what what goes on Amen there's a people on this Earth amen amen to have an atmosphere about them amen an atmosphere of Faith amen they're they're creating and they're changing things around them amen because we've been called Amen to be little Messiahs little creators it was in us that's what we were designed to be that's why you can say something negative and watch it happen watch it take place every time watch it manifest itself down the road somewhere but then also you can say something something positive something that you want and it may take years and then one day you'll be walking in that and you'll remember what you said you'll remember that you you claimed that and that you're you're an heir with Christ you didn't do it out of want but you did it out of need it was something that you desired within you right we're creators and how much more the word has been given how much more Vindicated you know our words aren't so Vindicated though if God speaks it through you they believe it but how much more when we can speak and we can believe and we can amen that which has been Vindicated that which we have no shadow of a doubt that God come down and spoke to us in this age spoke to us what abroad would be spoke to us amen the blessings and and the things that that have been provided for you and I how much more can we take those things and and man and put it on our lips and let it go forth amen amen is the anointed word don't count yourself out either if your heart's right your motives are right amen and amen and you're you're in the will of God speak the word and go forward speak to the storm amen David didn't have to go pray up hey man he he went forth into battle and he prophesied that he would defeat that Goliath he prophesied that he would cut his head off he couldn't go back and read that nowhere else amen but he went forth he didn't he was already prayed up but he spoke the word amen and it went out forth and defeated the enemy and brother Rome says now is the beginning of man that what God gave him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father and become unconscious of him and that that's where we are we're we're many times unconscious of it we've been so far removed from Eden right we've been so far removed amen we were we were in the mind of God we were there his thoughts and and that Perfection amen but the word is coming this hour Amen to bring us back to that and when the Holy Ghost is here Amen to change our lives to make us different and to bring us from glory to glory to bring us back to that amen don't be unconscious this morning amen amen amen don't be unconscious of who you are this morning amen have faith but it was because of the loss of Fellowship in the communion that's that's what made him unconscious of it amen keep keep the flame keep the flame burning in this hour keep the Flame Hard amen and he says here then he lost that all of his great channels become clogged up he couldn't get he couldn't get through now what Adam was in Christ's Christ redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original again oh what a redeemer we have oh what a Redemption that's taken place oh what a blood that was spilled oh oh what power is in the blood oh what power is in this word amen amen in the Revelation Amen to bring us back amen amen for one Amen to go and die on the cross amen and provide everything that we have need of to redeem us back to that original condition amen just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of fear in this hour amen amen amen amen walking perfect love perfect faith amen amen perfect faith is the master of all circumstances it's the master of every sickness every demon is subject to us here today you believe that he says here Adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he never had a heartache he never had a fear he just clowned in the arms of father just like a child now I can't say that that I've never been sick because I have you can't say that well we're going back to that we're going back to a perfection amen and we don't have to wait amen on on a body change or to die to be healed well we can be healed today we can be here we we may still get sick we may not be in that Perfect Adam condition of what he fell from but the fullness of redemption is bringing us back to that amen but I'll say today you don't have to live with sin you don't have to live with your problems Amen in your failures and your mistakes amen remember there's one here today that can bring a change amen there's a blood amen that speaks this morning and Redemption is speaking fullness of redemption is speaking this morning of a Rapture it's speaking of a body change I believe that's where we're going amen he said now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to that place the man and the fall lost his conscious of what the father put him on Earth here to do in other words all the plumbing it was all as it was in our brain he says and the outlets and the faith had been clogged up with business affair with home life domestic things it all becomes so clogged up with that until God can't operate through these channels that he made for man amen I want to be I want to be unclogged don't you he's staying this morning I want I want to be open to the channel of God to his love and his faith we had quite a little bit more here but we'll just man how'd y'all stand up too soon sorry about that sit back down now I'm just kidding do you love the Lord Amanda the revelation will come over let's finish with this a revelation that God gives will will unclog what you don't know or what you don't understand or what you can't see the revelation will come and and the Revelation that is Faith to you and and Revelation is a rock right Amen in that Revelation reveals who Jesus Christ is and then you can become sure of who he is and when you when you can see who he is then we can see Who We Are and we can see who we are that brings the Dominion that brings an authority back in your life that you can you can bind on Earth you can bind in heaven and you can loose on Earth and you can loosen Heaven that's the authority amen under Revelation and been founded and built upon Revelation that's what it brings back to the believer amen that brings a faith that you can stand on it brings us back amen Amen on speaking terms and and communion and that that channel and that Revelation it clears things up it clears the things up what's clogged up what we're unconscious of Amen that revelation will come let Amen Let the spirit of Revelation be in
