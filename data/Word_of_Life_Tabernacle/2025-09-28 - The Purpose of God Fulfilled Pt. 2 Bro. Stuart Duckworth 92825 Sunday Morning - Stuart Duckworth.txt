Just for a moment, I I'd like to u say thank you for bearing with me on not preaching much lately. I've uh had that dental surgery and then we've been gone and out of meetings. This month is really busy. I was in the meeting last night at Galina. I want to say that um they had a prayer line there last night and we were part of that and and uh I don't think they'd probably had one in 15 or 20 years there at the church and it was such a blessing to see those people and they become a sister church to us and I'm very proud of brother Ben and the church there and and we're thankful for that and able to do that. And I wanted to come back this morning to do these baptisms. We've got a couple of uh of uh kids that want to be baptized this morning, young people, and they've given their heart to the Lord. And so, we're looking forward to that. It's an important step. The Bible says, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." So, that's a promise to us. And so, we're going to do that right after the service this morning. And it's good to have each and every one of you with us. I think Andrew played every instrument up here this morning. So good to have you, buddy. I I know when you're at your home church, you work all the time. So, we hate to make you work here, but we sure do appreciate it. Something special about Brother Andrew on the organ. We love Brother Joe, but when Brother Joe's on call and things and Andrew's here, we're sure glad that he can play. And uh we've got uh Brandon and Charity Wood with us this morning. God bless you. We met last night actually briefly, but they were at the meetings last night. That's was a powerful service. We really enjoyed being part of that. And their little daughter, is it Graceland? Your daughter's name is Graceland. It's good to have you today. And they uh from West Plains and just recently uh found out about the message and things and been uh had come once before. And again, I apologize every time I come. Every time y'all come, I don't preach. But brother Stewart is a wonderful preacher and we just believe the Lord's going to use him this morning to speak to each and every heart. How many come expecting something from God today? Amen. So, we're glad to have you this morning and each one of you, if I have any other visitors here that I've missed, God bless you. We've got three or four families gone. Some of them are at the meetings, so let's be praying for them. But the Joel's up there and I'm actually going to be headed back this evening for some fellowship. And so we'll just pray for those on the roads. I wanted also, not to keep you standing, but we've been uh kind of quiet on the missions front lately. Uh we've got some work that we've been doing behind the scenes in Nepal and helping a church over there. It was my intention to go in November. If you've watched the news lately, Nepal's recently had a change in government and they've got a lot of stuff going on. on. So, would you pray with me that the will of the Lord would be done there if I'm able to go? I don't want to go in the middle of a situation. So, you be praying with me on that. And then, uh, in the spring, we're going to be going to Romania, the Lord willing. I don't know if you remember brother Cosman Stefen from Dallas. He was from Dallas, Texas, and he he's a Romanian uh by birth, and he came and spoke for us a couple of years ago. The Cosman has since moved to Romania and he called me the other day, wants us to come and hold a meeting for him there in Romania. So, we'll be looking forward to that. God's doing things and just want to let you know that because that's your uh finances and things that enable us to go and we're still doing all we can to see the message spread to every corner of the earth. And we believe when the last one comes in, we get to go home. I'm looking forward to going home. This world's getting worse and worse, but I'm looking forward to going home. Thank you for your patience with me this morning. As brother Stewart comes, I just want to worship the Lord for a moment. Let's sing that gratitude if you would. Amen. Are you grateful this morning? Let's just worship him a moment as brother Stewart would come. All my words fall short. [Music] I got nothing new. Singing now. How could I express? Oh my gratitude. Oh my. I could sing these songs as I often do. But every song must end. But you never do. And you never do. Hallelujah. Oh, so I'll throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else fit for a king. Oh, except for a heart single. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, sing it now. I've got one response. I've got one response. Oh, I've got just one move. Oh, with my arms stretch wide. Oh, I will worship you. So, I'll throw up my hands. So, I'll throw up my hands. Glory. praise you again and again. [Music] So all that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Oh hallelujah. [Music] And I know it's not much. Nothing else fit for a king. Oh, except for a heart singing. Oh, hallelujah. [Music] Sing it now. Oh, soul come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your song. Oh, you've got a lion inside of those thumbs. Just get up and pray. He's the Lord. Can you do that this morning? Praise him now. Oh, will come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shout me. Lift up your song. Yes, Lord. Got a lion inside of those soul. Oh, so I'll throw up my hands and praise you again and again. All that I have is a few. Oh [Music] yeah. And I know it's not much. Nothing else fit for a king. Except for singing hallelujah, [Music] hallelujah. [Music] Give him a hand clap this morning. Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts before him. Oh precious Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for your your mighty presence. Lord, we believe this morning that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. We we believe that you're a present help, Lord, in a time of need. And Lord, we've just come to this service now, Lord, to give our all, to give our all for Jesus this morning, Lord, to enter into your presence, Lord, to be able to draw, Lord, that which we would have need of, Lord. But not just that, Lord, but to worship you, Lord, to give you praise, to give you what's your due, Lord. And Lord, your prophet said if you'll worship him just a little bit, just see what he'll do. See how he'll come by. And so we we believe we've done that this morning, Lord. And may we just continue, Lord, to just to draw benefit from this service, Lord. We pray that you bless your people, Lord. You see every heart, every life. Lord, won't you come and minister, Lord? May the angels of God just come and minister to every heart, every life uh today, Lord. And just come and make me a a minister uh set my heart a flame this morning, Lord, with the power of God, with the spirit of God, Lord. Set your people a flame, Lord, with the word of the hour, Lord. And may it just burn in their hearts, Lord. Lord, we just love you today. We've come to this service, Lord. Have your way. Have your way in your word and in your people now. Have the preeminence. We give you this service in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. If we could, we'll just turn the scriptures to Matthew 3 and 1. Matthew 3:1. Just kind of the thought that we had the last time that we ministered, the fulfilled purpose of God. Just want to kind of pick that back up. and by God's grace this morning. Amen. Just good to see everyone and and just happy to be in the house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 3:1. In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight." Amen. You can be seated this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. We just appreciate his presence here today. Amen. And I'm sorry that you got to hear me this morning. And I just certainly wish brother Ben would have stepped in, but here we are. Amen. And &gt;&gt; and uh it's our turn. And so don't you appreciate our brother Ben and all he does. And I give him a hand clap, man. Preaches a lot. And if we can give him any kind of relief, then that's that's why we're here. Amen. Amen. We just want to look this morning at at the fulfilled purpose of God. Just as we said, a a thought that we' ministered on before. And and we look here at John the Baptist. We look at John's purpose and and his ministry. Such an interesting character in the Bible. Jesus said that there was no one greater, no prophet greater. John was the greatest. And John's, you know, purpose wasn't just to to prophesy of of of a coming Messiah, but he was to introduce the Messiah. Everything that the prophets had had had prophesied and and talked about here. Here here John was going to introduce that one that they had preached about, the one they had talked about. But here, just we want to just kind of talk about John just for a little bit. Amen. We can just relax this morning. I'm going to take my time and and just try to try to get our thought out here. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in Luke 1:15 about John that he would be great in the sight of the Lord and that neither uh drink or wine or strong drink. He would he would drink neither wine nor strong drink, but that from his mother's womb he would be full of the Holy Ghost. Amen. There, brother Random talks about there as a baby dead in the womb of his mother heard the name of Jesus and he came to life there and the Bible says they're leaping for joy in his mother's womb. And I want to say this morning, amen, that there was power in that name then &gt;&gt; and there's power in that name today. There's still power in that name here this morning. If it can cause a dead baby there lifeless in in a mother's womb, then just to hear the name of Jesus, what can it do this morning? Amen. Under under the understanding and the revelation that we have and the power of that name and what we've seen it done through the years and and the effects that it's had upon the people's lives and the and the enemy that it's drove back and the devils that it's defeated. Amen. I I still believe this morning that there's power in that name. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. If there ever was power in that name, there's power in that name this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Power to raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Power to heal the sick. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Power to change lives. And that that's really what we want this morning. That's what we want. That's what we want to preach about. That's what we want to talk about. That's what we want to project. And that's what we want to believe. Something that will come, something that can be preached, something that can be expressed to the people that can change their lives. Amen. Amen. A dead letter never did anybody no good. Amen. Just a just a little sermon at here and there never did nobody no good. But we want the anointed word, amen, that God has given in the in this hour to proceed forth. Amen. From the sacred desk, amen. That it can touch the hearts of the people. Amen. Amen. It's more than simply speaking the name of Jesus. Amen. But it's the word of God. Amen. That he himself has sent in this hour. Amen. By his voice. Amen. Not the voice of just a man. Amen. but his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "My sheep hear my voice, they know my voice, and a stranger they will not follow." Jesus said, "In my words," Amen. "And it's life." Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, that's what we want to project. Something that will change, something that will bring life. Amen. Amen. Is that not what we've received in this hour? Amen. We who were dead in sinned and trespasses. Amen. We were quickened, Amen. by the word of God. Amen. It wasn't just a It wasn't just man's idea. And we'll get into this a little bit later. It wasn't just a man's idea, but it was an anointed word for this day that God sent that would have would have a specific effect on a specific people. &gt;&gt; And that was John's purpose. That was he he was sent with a message from the scriptures to have a specific effect &gt;&gt; upon the people of that day. &gt;&gt; And that's what the message of the hour has done for you and I. It's not for everybody. It's not It's not for everybody, but it's sent to a a specific people. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning? I've drank about four or five bottles of water. You think I wouldn't be thirsty? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord this morning. We need something that's got power in it. &gt;&gt; Come on. And from the scripture, from the anointed word lays that power this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just in my thoughts or my ideas, but it's from the anointed word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We'll go on and talk about John. Bible says that he would be responsible for turning many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. That was his ministry to turn their hearts. Amen. And and he would Amen. He would before him would he would go in the power and the spirit of Elijah. Does the Bible say that he would go in the power and the spirit of Elijah? Amen. God uses that spirit. We know five times in the Bible. Amen. There in Elijah and then and then that spirit came back upon Elisha. And then several hundred years later there there hadn't been a prophet in in several hundred years. But here God had a specific Amen. portion of his word that he was going to fulfill. And he would use the spirit of Elijah. He would use the spirit of Elijah on a man named John. Amen. Amen. The very spirit of Christ for a for a purpose, for a specific purpose. And he would send forth this spirit. Amen. To turn the hearts of the people. Amen. It would go in power and demonstration. Amen. Amen. It would be something, Amen. that would had life in it. It would be something that wouldn't just tickle the ears, but it would be something that would grab the attention of the believer of that day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we needed. We needed something to grab our attention. Amen. Amen. Pentecost wouldn't work no more. The Baptist ideology wouldn't work no more. God had to give us something, amen, to to catch our attentions, &gt;&gt; to change us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the purpose of the word. That's the purpose of the of the preaching of the gospel to change uh men and women. Amen. &gt;&gt; To change our lives. &gt;&gt; And then he would he would use that spirit upon Malachi 4. A prophet would come in this day, amen, to turn the hearts of the people. And then he'll use that spirit again. Amen. In an Elijah ministry to turn the hearts of Israel back to the Holy Ghost faith. &gt;&gt; So God uses that that that spirit. &gt;&gt; He He It comes in a time and a season. &gt;&gt; And when it comes, it does what it's intended to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does not fail. &gt;&gt; But it it catches the attention of the people. God presents it in such a way to catch our attention. Amen. That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, there he would go on that power in the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. The disobedient, the Bible says, unto wisdom. And his ministry wasn't to to bring people to follow him, but to point them to one who was coming. &gt;&gt; It wasn't about John. It wasn't about what he could do. Come on. &gt;&gt; But his ministry was to point to to someone that was coming &gt;&gt; on &gt;&gt; that could help the people. &gt;&gt; Someone that was coming that could have a greater effect even than his ministry. Even a greater effect than the spirit of Elijah. Oh, what a revelation we could draw from that this morning. What faith we could draw from that this morning. Amen. Let it go beyond the ministry of a prophet. Let it go beyond the ministry of Elijah to the one he pointed to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I try not to get ahead of myself this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. He came, Amen. to bring the disobedient unto wisdom. To not to not follow him, but to point them to one who was coming. To make ready, the Bible says to make the people ready. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And prepared not for himself, but for the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was his ministry to prepare the hearts of the people. for the Lord &gt;&gt; to make them ready for the great one. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I'm not much of a preacher, but I'm just I'll try my best today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 1 and six. Look at this. And there was a man sent from God whose name was John. And the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; It goes on and says, "He was not that light, &gt;&gt; but he was sent to bear witness of that light." Oh, what a great responsibility to bear witness of the light. To be a man that's sent from God to Amen. to go to to what? To a place. Amen. There to be sent to go to a place appointed. Amen. So, he was appointed for a certain purpose. Amen. To be a messenger. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To be an angel. To be a messenger. To be a witness. And you know, God, you know, God can speak to us through the supernatural. Hey, God, I believe God could come down and and speak through angels. He could he could he could speak from heaven, but you know, God has earthly angels. God has earthly messengers. You know, I I could hear something, you know, something random and and you may not think much about it, but if God anoints a man, there's just something about it. that God brings somebody, amen, and anoints them and they have a ministry from the scripture. Amen. It has a greater effect than maybe maybe just a voice, a random voice from somewhere. Amen. Somebody, amen, that you can touch, somebody that you can see. Amen. Sometime somebody that you can interact with on a day-to-day basis. Amen. And that's what John was there for. Amen. Amen. He came out of the wilderness. Amen. Amen. He was he was back there. Amen. He wasn't filled with man's ideas. He wasn't filled with theology. Amen. But he had been back there. Amen. Amen. Under the anointing, amen, of the spirit &gt;&gt; to come out of the wilderness and have an effect upon the people. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's what we as Christians, that's what we as Christians, we've got to have an effect upon those around us rather than they have a greater effect upon us. Amen. Amen. We've got to stay shut in with God. You don't have to be a hermit and live on a mountain somewhere. Amen. But but live a life that's shut in with God. Amen. that you can go out and have an effect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be the only Bible that many people ever read. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; So, he was sent to be a messenger. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; A true witness, a witness to bear witness of the light. He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe John held true to that witness? &gt;&gt; You believe John held through true to that witness? I I believe that. I believe he was a true witness that that didn't point the people to himself, but he pointed them to the coming light, &gt;&gt; to the coming one, but think of that that through him all men would believe. John's ministry has an effect upon you and I &gt;&gt; even even as as as believers now. Amen. He was the one that would identify the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; He was the one that would identify that. So John had his part to play. Amen. And and through him all men would believe. &gt;&gt; What a ministry that was. What a great ministry that was that through him all men would believe. &gt;&gt; He was born He was born for a purpose. He was born to identify the Messiah, to be a witness of the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was born to identify the lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world. That's a pretty important job, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That's a pretty important job. And I I think that, you know, if you got a pretty important job like that, I I believe in if if if God called you to be that, you're you're a man sent from God. I believe that God will will help you fulfill what your purpose is. Whatever your job is, I believe he'll help you fulfill that. And I believe with all my heart that John fulfilled his ministry, don't you? I believe that he done his part to to point to people, amen, to to the lamb of God. And we could say the thing, same thing about the Elijah prophet that came in this day. Amen. I believe with all my heart that he fulfilled his ministry, that he done his part. Amen. That there's nothing left undone. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't leave something halfway undone, but when God does something, he does it. Amen. And I believe in in this hour, we've got what we need. Amen. We've got to we've got what we need. We We've been We've been exposed, Amen. We've been exposed to a man sent from God. We've been exposed, Amen, to the light. One that bore witness of the light. And I believe the prophet in this hour, Amen, had a true representation, &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; of that light. And I believe he done everything &gt;&gt; that he was called to do. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; What an important job that he had. What an important job that you have this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be bearers of the light. To be witnesses of the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He is the light. &gt;&gt; He is the light. &gt;&gt; And don't let your don't let your light that he's given you be hid. Don't hide it under a bushel. &gt;&gt; But let it shine. Let it shine. Amen. For the glory of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's the purpose. That's your purpose in this hour of every Holy Ghost filled Christian is to be a light that someone might believe. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I've got a friend that talked through to through the years and he's going to be baptized this morning. He's always just, you know, I you don't feel like much, but he's always regarded me as a man of God. I I'm nothing. But he tells me that and I tell him I appreciate that, but he's going to be baptized this morning &gt;&gt; at a Baptist church. &gt;&gt; And I've been talking to him about baptism and the correct way. I said, "How are they going to baptize you?" and you know how they do. &gt;&gt; And we begin to talk and when I begin to show him scriptures and show him things in the Bible said, "Oh yeah, I see that. Acts 2:38." He said, "It's right there." &gt;&gt; And and and I said, "Don't let him." He said, "I I believe that. I believe that that's the way you should be baptized." I explained to him, "What is the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost? What is that name?" Amen. What did Jesus tell? He didn't tell us to baptize in titles, but he said, "What is the baptize in the name?" And I asked him, "What is the name?" He, you know, and I said, "The Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's salvation alone. Amen. Is that name? Amen. There's not another name given under heaven whereby men must be saved. And he said, "That's how I'm going to tell them that I want to be baptized. And if they won't do it, then then I won't be baptized." And so, he told me this morning, that's how they're going to baptize him. And I've seen video after video of them baptizing in the father, son, and holy ghost. But Amen. Amen. The little understanding that you feel like you have about the word, the word, Amen. can have such a positive effect. And that's why we're here is to have a positive effect. Will he ever come to believe the message? I don't know that. I I have I have no control over that. All you have control over is the influence that you have and the positivity. Amen. and the the light that we shed forth. Amen. The understanding that we have that that many people would would give their lives. They would give all their fortune. They would get everything they had to know what you know and to understand what you understand. Amen. But God sent you the light. &gt;&gt; God sent you the light. Amen. Be a be a witness of that light. &gt;&gt; Shed forth a light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If it's just talking about something simple as being baptized, many people don't understand. They don't know. They only know what people talk them in into. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good preaching. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram talks about John here. I love this. He said, "Brother, he didn't have on the tuxedo clothes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't have his collar turned around, &gt;&gt; but he had an old sheep skin draped around him. But he preached repentance. He preached Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And though his simplicity had stirred all the regions around about, he said, "What we Baptist churches and all the rest of you need today is another John the Baptist." &gt;&gt; He preached repentance. He preached Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He preached Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he preached Amen. And he said, "Though in its simplicity had draws in." And he goes on, he says, "The power of God has been the greatest drawing card the world has ever had." He said, "There he come preaching how marvelous and how wonderful, what a real man of man of God and a manifestation he was." And he preached and then Christ came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when John preached, he didn't preach himself. &gt;&gt; He didn't preach about himself. Amen. When John preached, he preached the kingdom of God of heaven is at hand. The the kingdom of God is at hand. He preached that something is coming. Amen. He preached that someone is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone is coming that will change the world forever. Someone is coming. Amen. Greater than me. I can baptize you. I I can talk to you about it. But there's somebody coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't preach himself. He preached get ready. He preached confess your sins. He preached someone is coming. Amen. He preached Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's the what the world needs. That's what the world needs in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. It needs something. It needs someone that will bring a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just another set of rules and ordinances to live by or laws or or or some creeds or doctrines, but something that will change the heart of a man. Amen. something that will change him, that will change a person's lives to where they can never be the same ever when they come in contact with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to project. Amen. I want to I want to project a religion like that. Amen. Amen. Not a dead religion, but something that's got life in it. Amen. Something that'll change a person. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Change them. He preached something's coming that will change them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That will change you &gt;&gt; from what you are to what God ordained you to be. &gt;&gt; What God ordained you to be, &gt;&gt; not what the world says you are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not what so and so big time preacher got it all figured out. What he says, &gt;&gt; come on, preach. what this religion says, but what God in his mind ordained you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone with power. We can try to turn over a new leaf. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We We even ourselves, we can try ourselves. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But you'll fail and you'll fail and you'll fail until you come in contact just like Moses did. Moses was the biggest failure. Moses was the biggest failure. had all the learning, had all the education to know how to go and defeat armies, defeat nations and to bring back the spoils, but he couldn't deliver his own people. He couldn't do what God actually God called him to do. But when he come in contact, when he come in contact with that light, when he come in contact with the pillar of fire, Amen, he could never be the same. He could never be the same again. And and it deposited in him, Amen. Amen. something that could that could help him something that would help him carry out the task &gt;&gt; that God called him to do. What what he would what his purpose was. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come in contact five minutes &gt;&gt; in that presence &gt;&gt; will give you the courage &gt;&gt; to overcome every devil &gt;&gt; that is attacking you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Just a moment even &gt;&gt; in that presence can change you from what you were &gt;&gt; to what God has called you to be. &gt;&gt; Just a moment. &gt;&gt; Just a moment in that holy presence. Amen. Can give you the faith, give you the courage. There Moses stick &gt;&gt; stick in his hand. Where you going, Moses? I'm going to take over. &gt;&gt; Come on. Something happened. Something changed. They come in the presence. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a power the gospel has. What a power to change somebody's life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem the world has isn't a political problem. It isn't educational. &gt;&gt; It isn't whether you're black or white. It isn't race or ethnicity. The world has a sin problem. &gt;&gt; You and I had a sin problem. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The world has a heart problem. &gt;&gt; And until the heart is changed, men are capable of the worst things that you can imagine. They're capable of anything, of any horrible act. And we and when you take God out of the home, &gt;&gt; when you take God out of the school, &gt;&gt; when you take God's word and you put it on the shelf, when when you when the blood isn't applied, what happened in Israel or in Goan rather, the children of Israel, when the blood was applied, the death angel passed. When you take away a blood gospel, it invites the death angel. It invites the death of Leodysia. It invites complacency. It invites lukewarmness. Watch and destroy your life. Amen. Amen. But we've got to discern and withstand that antichrist spirit brother talked about. Amen. Amen. And the only thing Amen. The only thing that's going to drive away the enemy is a blood religion. Is a blood faith. Amen. Amen. Something that's got life in him. I believe that with all my heart this morning that it's a Holy Ghost bloodfilled gospel. Amen. That will change our young people. That will change, Amen, the world. Amen. That's the only thing that will change a corrupted heart. You can't educate nobody into it. Amen. But it's a blood gospel. Amen. That's got to be preached. It's got to be heard. It's got to be accepted. What the problem of it is, Amen. It's too oldfashioned anymore. Amen. John the Baptist preaching is just too old-fashioned anymore. Nobody wants to hear it. Nobody wants to come under it. Amen. But that's what'll change you. Amen. That's what that it'll burn that out of you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It'll change your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. That ministry was to turn the hearts of the people &gt;&gt; back to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; They come under no doubt. John wasn't going around talking in a in a low voice. &gt;&gt; I can imagine he's yelling louder and screaming louder than I am. He had been on the earth for 30 or so years. 30 years, but he only had 6 months to work. You think he's going to go around haphazard? He went with a purpose. He preached with a purpose. Amen. Let Let us live with a purpose. We've we've we've not gotten much longer down here. Let's live with a purpose. Amen. Amen. Let's Let's shine forth the light of Jesus Christ. Amen. While we're here, let's work. Amen. While it's day, for the night is coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The world's got a heart problem. The Leodysian age, this Leoian age shuts him out completely to where he's on the outside of the door knocking trying to get back in. Amen. He's shut out, but he still knocks at the door. &gt;&gt; You imagine kicking somebody out of your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody that could help you, &gt;&gt; somebody that could change your life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They could give you whatever you needed. Not wanted. They could give you whatever you needed. And you shut that person out. You kick them out. But yet that person is still on the door knocking, trying to get back in. That's our Lord Jesus in this age. That's the description of this age. Though they shut him out, he's still on the door knocking, trying to get back in, asking, Amen, to come in and make them what they were ordained to be as men and as women. Amen. To to to raise them up, to redeem them up, amen, from what Satan has has has brought them down to to redeem them, to bring them back, Amen. Amen. to their original estate. Amen. He's able to do that this morning. Do you believe that? He's able to take us from the filth. He's able to take us from the low of the low. Amen. You thought you couldn't get any lower. You thought you couldn't be any worse of a human being. But even in that condition, Amen. There's a redeeming power. There's a redeeming love. Amen. Amen. And it was brought to you by the blood, the Holy Ghost gospel, the Holy Ghost blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. That power, Amen. was brought to you and I &gt;&gt; to redeem us up, to bring us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning? I'm just preaching. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. He still knocks at the at the heart this morning to take the callous the callous over heart &gt;&gt; of stone and make it soft and open to the effects of the gospel. Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; John John preached repent. &gt;&gt; He did. He preached the kingdom of heaven is at hand. He preached prepare yourselves and there you know there he come clothed and camel's hair. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Had a leather belt. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It was It wasn't no fake leather. A genuine He had genuine leather. It was genuine leather. out in the wilderness there come draped in this this camel hair with a leather belt with a leather girdle holding holding everything on there wasn't much to look at. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said brother Brandham says here he said oh what we need is a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost stirring among the people to get men and women back to living to the living God again. He said what's the matter? The world's dead. &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "I can see this man John was born when he come out of the wilderness Judea. Didn't have a tuxedo on his collar turned around in the back eating fried chicken and ice cream three times a day, but he come he had locust and wild honey. And he had a big old piece of sheepkin draped around him with a camel skin belt lapped on him. Oh my." John obviously didn't care for the finer things in life. &gt;&gt; He imagined eating eating locust and and wild honey. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let me go kill a deer. Let me go kill something. God, I'm a prophet. Provi provide me something better than this. &gt;&gt; But John didn't care about that. &gt;&gt; John had a purpose. &gt;&gt; John had a reason. &gt;&gt; Covered in goat hair. Le le leather leather belt genuine leather belt eating locust at least cover them in chocolate or do something. Lord bless these locust. Change it into something. You know God can change anybody. Change this locust. I guess that that's what the honey was for to make it a little sweet. &gt;&gt; Nothing artificial about that. God God did provide him the honey, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about that. God will give you what you have need of you. He He'll take the bitter things and make it sweet. Amen. He He just God will see you through this morning. He'll see you through in this hour. If you've got a purpose, amen. Amen. Nothing can destroy that purpose. God will give you something to eat. God will provide for you. He's still Jehovah Gyra. After several hundred years, Amen. There hadn't been a prophet on the scene. But Jehovah Gyra, God provided a prophet from the scripture. Amen. Come out. Amen. He wasn't much to look at. Maybe he didn't enjoy the finer things of life. Maybe it didn't didn't mean that much to him. &gt;&gt; But what he had to say was true. What he had to say was anointed. Amen. Amen. And while he had breath in his lungs, Amen. He He did it. He He did what God called him to do. While he had while he had breath in his lungs, he expressed that. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this morning, we know that John the Baptist had his head cut off. We understand what happened to him. But I want to tell you this that that Satan can't do nothing to you until God allows it. Amen. Until your purpose is fulfilled. Amen. Amen. You will walk this earth with the breath in in your lungs that God provided. And he will provide for you meat. And he will provide for you clothing. He will provide for you housing. He will give you what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord. All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. He was true to the word and that was to preach Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Stay true to the word and God will see you through this morning. Amen. Telling the people to get right for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Something's coming to manifest itself. I'm just telling you about it. I'm telling you, prepare yourselves. Get ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Make yourselves ready. Put away your own ideas. Put away Put away your ideas. Uh put away your old orthodox thinking. Something different is coming. Something's something's going to take place. There's going to be one that's mighty. There's going to be one that's great. And he's coming. I'm telling you, get ready. &gt;&gt; Get ready. He's coming. &gt;&gt; I doubt that was John's ma message. &gt;&gt; Make yourself ready. Amen. Let's never get beyond the purpose. Amen. This morning of God. Let us never get beyond the purpose of the Holy Ghost fil church. And that is that that life would flow through the church. That the voice of God would would continue to echo out in the church. Let us never forget. Amen. Why God gave us the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. to do something about it. Let's say something about it to put you in service. Let us never lose sight of the purpose of why we're here, while we have breath in these lungs. Amen. In life, in these bodies, let us preach and be a a a witness. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That the message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Someone that can change you. There's somebody coming. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And what we preach now, we don't preach that something's coming. We preach that something is here. Amen. And we point to people, Amen. We point to people back to the Bible. We point to people, amen, not to something new. Amen. Not to some new fang dangle idea. Amen. Amen. But we point them back to something that can change them. Amen. Something that will change their lives or someone greater. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us never lose sight of the one that's been revealed in this day. Amen. May we allow the stirring of the Holy Ghost among men and women, among young people. Amen. Amen. And we may we allow ourselves Amen. May we be prepared amen for a move of God in our midst. Amen. May we come with the right attitude to the house of God. Amen. May we come to the house of God with faith in our hearts. Amen. Amen. Getting rid of every old unbelieving spirit. Amen. Amen. I don't want to be a hindrance in the house of God. I don't want to be a hindrance. Amen. I don't want something in my life to affect this brother or this sister. Amen. From getting what she has need of. Let's come to the house of God. Amen. In faith. Let's come to the house, Amen. of God prayed up. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's come with the right attitude. Amen. Let's let the Holy Ghost stir among us this morning. Let's let it stir. Let us let it not go in one ear and out the other. Amen. But let something Amen. stir inside of us that we can leave here better Christians than what we were when we came. That ought to be the desire of every person in this place. &gt;&gt; I want to leave better &gt;&gt; than what I came. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. &gt;&gt; Try to quit screaming at you here. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord &gt;&gt; there. John, a preacher, brother Bam said his hair all bulged out around his face. Brother, he didn't know any theology. He didn't know any of these these seminary experiences. He stayed in the wilderness under the power of God until God sent him out. He said, "God, give us some more God- sent men like that." When he walked out there, brother, he wasn't so eloquent to look at. His speech wasn't so eloquent. But I'll tell you what he did. He preached sermons that stirred all the regions. He preached sermons that stirred all the regions around in Judea and Jerusalem and everything came out to hear him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He didn't care for the finer things in life. And it's all right if you do. I like to have nice things. I like to eat fried chicken and ice cream. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with fried chicken or ice cream. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; but let it let us not be so comfortable that we lose the sight of the purpose of God. Let us not be so so comfortable &gt;&gt; in these old bodies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said why? He preached not theology but Christ. What's the matter with the world today? We've substituted our creeds and things to take the place of the Holy Ghost. Creeds will never shove the church on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Creeds will never shove the church on. your own ideas about the message and your twist upon the message will never rapture the church. It will never shove the church on. It takes the Holy Ghost to lead the church and the Holy Ghost stays with the word. &gt;&gt; You believe that the Holy Ghost will stay right there with the word for the Holy Ghost wrote the word. &gt;&gt; So if we're off the word, then the Holy Ghost isn't leading that. We're leading ourselves and you're going &gt;&gt; off the path. But to get back on the path, you've got to come under the word because that's what the Holy Ghost is pulling. It's pulling the anointed word for this hour to the rapture. It's bringing the church through. Amen. Our ideas will do nothing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It will do nothing. Brother Ram says that old sassifrass gospel, oldfashioned gospel, he said, but it saved me and it'll do the same thing for you. It's truth. It's hard. John's preaching was hard. I can't imagine it would be easy preaching. &gt;&gt; I can't imagine it would be easy to sit under. And that's what the truth is. It's hard. He said, "I know it's hard, but brother, sometimes you have to get broke up before you can get made up again." He said, "It's the truth." Amen. I'll say it again. Preaching our ideas will never help anyone. Preaching our special doctrine or our special revelation will never help anyone. Especially if that doctrine and you could have a a special revelation, special doctrine. No, nothing against that. But especially it won't help anybody if it's off the word. It will not help anybody. Those things are dead. They are lifeless. Amen. But I say let our doctrine, let our teaching, let let what we project be from cover to cover in the Bible. Let it be found consistently. Amen. Not something isolated, not something that you formulated, but let it be found consistently with the teachings of the prophet of God for this day and the message of this hour. Amen. Preaching our our ideas will only drive the Holy Ghost. It will only drive the the the Holy Ghost out presence &gt;&gt; from our midst. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. &gt;&gt; And if there's no Holy Ghost, there's nothing to hold. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hold anybody. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, it will not hold anybody. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; But with the Holy Ghost, there's a holding power. There's a staying power. There's an effect until the predestinated moment, the predestinated time of your purpose is manifested. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost present will illuminate that in a person's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may go years hearing the word. You may go years. Amen. No doubt hearing the voice and the tug of the Holy Ghost. But at a predestinated moment, amen. When your purpose of why you are here, when it when it comes time and there's a time and a season, Amen. If the presence is here, if you can get in that presence, it will illuminate your life and set you forth &gt;&gt; and pull your life by the Holy Ghost. Pull your life and bring you to where you need to be. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; God will not honor the confusion of man to interpret the Bible or what a prophet spoke in this day. &gt;&gt; God will not honor that. &gt;&gt; He won't honor if it comes from my lips &gt;&gt; or anybody else's lips. God will not honor that. But he will honor his true, pure, unadulterated word. Brother said, "We have we have with divine divindication the perfect interpretation of the word." Why would I want to change anything of that &gt;&gt; with my own special idea? &gt;&gt; Never helped anybody. &gt;&gt; But the true word will that's been revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't don't substitute anything for the real. Brother Brown said, "We don't need nothing fake. The skies are full of the real blessing." Amen. God God wants us to have the real thing this morning. He He don't want He don't want to give us a substitute. He don't want to give you something and take it back either. Amen. But God wants you to have the real thing this morning. Amen. If you need more faith this morning, there's more faith to be had. Amen. There's real genuine revelation this morning. Amen. From the spirit of God. Amen. Amen. from the from the ministering spirits. Amen. From the Holy Ghost from heaven this morning. There's revelation of the word. Amen. That will give you victory in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times have I said amen, sisters? &gt;&gt; Hopefully, nobody's keeping count. &gt;&gt; Don't substitute anything for the real. &gt;&gt; There's a real lifechanging gospel. Amen. And there's a voice even this morning that goes beyond the sound of the voice of a man. Amen. But Jesus said, "My sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow." Amen. There's a tug and there's a pull of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Even even beyond John's own voice. Amen. There was a voice speaking through John. Amen. He could preach as loud as he wanted. Amen. But if there wasn't something back in him, Amen. If there wasn't a a spirit of God in there ministering, Amen. It would have never draw the hearts. Amen. But God was in it. Amen. And amen. And if if there's a tug this morning, if there's a little bit of tug of the Holy Ghost, Amen. Amen. Respond to that voice. Amen. Amen. Amen. Listen to that voice. Amen. If there's a deep calling to the deep, help me preach this morning. If there's a deep calling to the deep, then there's got to be a deep to respond. Amen. If there's a longing for the God of history, for the God of the Bible, Amen. Amen. There's got to be a God of history, amen, to come on the scene, there's got to be a God of the Bible. come on the scene. If there's a longing, if there's a little bit of longing to say, "Oh Jehovah God, manifest yourself to me." Amen. Like you did, Amen. of the children of Israel, of the prophets of old. Amen. Like you did to Paul and Silas. Amen. When they were in the prison, Amen. Manifest yourself to me like you did to the prophet. Amen. Amen. There when Had said, "That's nothing but the truth." Amen. If you'll do your part, God will do his this morning. Amen. There's a real Amen. There's a blessing for the people of God. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a longing in your heart for reality. Amen. He's here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Matthew 3 and5. Try to hurry here. then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins. And when they saw when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, "Oh generation of vipers, &gt;&gt; who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" &gt;&gt; Come on. Bring forth therefore fruits meat for repentance. And think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our father. For I say unto you that God is able these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. &gt;&gt; You believe he can still raise up stones this morning? &gt;&gt; Here he's dealing with the religious ones of that day, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the ones that were supposed to know the word. Hear the ministry, the voice of God speaking to them. And they were supposed to know, but yet they were there to criticize. There he's speaking to the ones that knew what Moses said. They knew what the prophet said. They could tell you everything. &gt;&gt; Every line, every phrase, they could repeat it. &gt;&gt; They under they they had somewhat of an understanding, but it wasn't the understanding for that day. They they knew what was said. And there he's he's he's talking to them and they knew all the quotes. Amen. And they were supposed to be the ones that had it all figured out. But John calls them a generation of vipers. I don't think there's much thing something worse that you call somebody than a snake. I think that's about as bad as it gets. If &gt;&gt; you've ever called somebody a snake, then they they done you wrong. They done something to you for you to call them a snake. Nobody likes a snake, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; He That's right. Nobody likes a snake. And there he's calling them vipers. They're calling them snakes. Bring forth fruits, meat for repentance. Humble yourselves. Throw away your ideas. There's someone coming. He could be here right now. Throw away your ideas. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The &gt;&gt; scriptures being fulfilled. The words being fulfilled. Amen. It's coming. Amen. Into plain view. Throw away your ideas. Make repent. make ready. Humble yourselves. Throw away your preconceived ideas of what God is supposed to be. Repent. Make ready. But it wasn't in them to have their hearts changed. &gt;&gt; The preaching was just too hard. They couldn't bear it. &gt;&gt; What God was doing at that present time didn't fit their idea. And that that's what the message is in this hour. It doesn't fit the idea &gt;&gt; though. is scripturally sound. They look past it &gt;&gt; because it doesn't fit their idea. And I heard brother Donnie Reagan preaching, heard a little clip when he first come in contact with the message. He he went to Jeffersonville and got all the tapes. Maybe somebody heard this. Went and got all the tapes and had his own little church there and he did. He'd come back and he just shut himself in and listen and listen to the message and listen and listen to the message. He said he didn't go out and preach. He didn't go here and there. He had his own little church, but he said he didn't want to carry over his own ideas, his own Pentecostal ideas in to the message. Amen. An anointed man anointed to preach, but he said he needed a birth of the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I thought that was so powerful &gt;&gt; there. not to mix his own ideas, but to preach the pure word. And I I I thank God for men like that. I think about different ministers I I've heard preach and brother Ben and and different ones. And you know, when you hear them preach, it's the same as the the sound that I hear coming off the message when I listen to it. I always thought that about Brother Tim, not to put nobody up, but I just always I always it was always the same thing that I heard. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate men of God like that will that will try to stay true to the word. Yeah. We'll we'll get off. We'll have little differences of opinion of this and that. Amen. But let us stay true to the word. Let us not mix our own ideas. Amen. But let's come under the pure word. Amen. We're not in a Pentecostal age. Amen. We're in a different time now. Amen. John, Amen, when he was preaching, he was in a certain dispensation. But later on in the book of Acts, amen, there was those that was baptized unto repentance. Amen. It did come into a different dispensation. Amen. And they said, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" And they said, "We don't know anything about the Holy Ghost." They were baptized under John. He said, "Oh no, something's different now. See, something had changed. It was a different time. In just a few years, it changed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, the word is progressive. &gt;&gt; God doesn't change his mind, but the word unfolds itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what the message of the hour is. We we can we can come to a certain spot, but it's a progression. It's a continual progression. Even brother Brandham himself had a progressive revelation of things. Was brother Brandham wrong when he preached certain things? He preached it in the light that he understood it in that he had. But when a greater light came, he walked in that progression. And that's the sign of a of a minister, of a true believer. When I'm wrong, when I say something wrong, uh, and something else is revealed to me, let me walk in that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay where you're at this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can be changed. We don't have to be stubborn old mules, stubborn old whatever. We can We can be changed. We We can be different, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; As long as it's progressing with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'll try to hurry here. &gt;&gt; John being anointed with the the spirit of Elijah as was promised was to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children. &gt;&gt; His ministry was to turn the fathers back to the children. Elijah this day was to turn the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal father. Here John's turning these old Orthodox, brother said those old Orthodox Jew with callous hearts, stony hearts, and raise up children to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not get stuck on the vipers now. Let's not get stuck on the snakes. What' he say? God is able, if you won't do it, God is able to raise these stones. Amen. Children unto Abraham. And that's what God wants in this hour. &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants to have. Children with the faith of Abraham. Someone who will believe his word. Someone who will take the promised word of the day. No matter how impossible it seems. I I was going to say strange or crazy. What we believe isn't strange or crazy. It's just impossible to some. Amen. But but God wants children of Abraham that will take that which is impossible. Amen. That nobody could. Amen. We you can't do that. But God is able. Amen. To do what we aren't able to do. And God will reveal his word to his people in progression. Amen. Amen. for the age that they live in. Amen. And we will walk in that. The children of Abraham will walk in that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Through the difficulties, through the trials. And he told Abraham, Amen. After that trial, he said, "Thy seed shall possess the gate of its enemy." Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the children of Abraham in this hour. That's the stones that he's raised up. That's the hearts and lives that he's changed. Amen. People, Amen. Amen. a people that he will see through every difficulty. He will see through every trial. Amen. And at the end of that, amen, they will overcome death, hell, and the grave. Amen. And they will take a rapture in this age and in this hour. They will overcome the gates of hell. They will overcome every enemy. &gt;&gt; Stones. &gt;&gt; God is able to raise up stones. Bring the callous hearts. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. even even with her own ideas and shake them loose from those ideas and to bring them into lively stones. Children of Abraham to believe the word &gt;&gt; to believe the word. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Power and transformation. He says the same thing it is about having a church here in the last days. He is going to have a bride. He is able these stones to raise children. Abraham, if we don't follow him, he'll get somebody else that will follow him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, if we don't want to do it, God will raise up somebody. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to do it this morning, God will raise up somebody to worship him, to have faith in his word. God will raise somebody up. He will have a bride in this day. It looks impossible. Looks impossible, &gt;&gt; but God will have a bride in this day. &gt;&gt; You believe that? He will get somebody else. He'll bring in some drug addict. Somebody that'll serve God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Why do they worship? Why do you worship? Because of what God delivered me from. Why do you Why do you love him so much? Cuz he done so much for me. &gt;&gt; You think about John. He neither drunk wine or strong drink. But there's many of us that have parttook in in things that are wrong. But God raised up stones. Amen. He raised up stones as children unto Abraham. He raised up from our lives. Amen. From what we were, from our callous condition. Amen. Amen. We were we were going to hell as quick as we could go. But God raised us up to believe his word in this hour. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In an age of callous hearts and full of religion and hate for the word, Amen. There's stones that can be changed. Amen. There's a people that can hear the voice of the Lord their God calling to them. Amen. That will open up every door of their heart. Amen. That God could come and fill every every fiber of their being. Amen. I I love that quote and we we read it last time and I'll just kind of go over here and said, God, you know, you got to get yourself killed out. Brother said, I'm persuaded that that we've done just enough. We got just enough Holy Ghost and been received just enough Holy Ghost to where we don't want to lie or cheat or steal. But God wants to fill every fiber of the church. Amen. He wants to take every callous corner of your heart and fill every fiber of your life. Amen. And surround you with the love of the Holy Ghost, the love for the word and fill every every fiber. Amen. And make you just completely totally dead to yourself and to your thinking. &gt;&gt; Just surrendered in God &gt;&gt; till his word is living right through you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll try to hurry here. Matthew 3 and 11. John said, "I indeed baptize you with water and to repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I." &gt;&gt; Whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. &gt;&gt; Whose fan is in his hand, he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. John &gt;&gt; John was so positive that someone was coming. John was so positive of what he believed in. John was so positive that the one he was preaching about was so near. He was so positive that what he was preaching about, who he was preaching about was in the midst. That he was so close to where he could identify and fulfill what he was called to do. That he could identify that this is the Messiah. John was so positive of where he was standing. He was so positive of the things that he said. He was so positive of the things that he believed. He was so positive of what God told him. And I want to say this morning, are you positive? Are you positive where you're sitting? Are you positive where you're standing? Are you positive in the one, Amen, in the voice of the Lord God that has spoke to it to us in this hour? Amen. The one that's give us purpose. The one that's give us vision. The one that's give us a sight of a rapture. Amen. To bring us out, amen. And that the church wouldn't go through tribulation. Amen. in this earth is coming to a place now, amen, where something's got to give. Amen. Don't lose sight of that vision. Are you positive this morning that what you believe is thus sayeth the Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; John was so positive where he was standing. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He was positive. &gt;&gt; No negativity. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; It was positive. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that how you feel about it this morning? Are you positive this morning that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world? &gt;&gt; Are you positive this morning that there's power in the mighty name of Jesus? &gt;&gt; Are you positive this morning that there's a Holy Ghost that can change a person's life? Amen. Are you positive this morning that the word is bringing us to our final destination? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Are you positive this morning? Amen. John was positive there was one coming. He's mightier than I. Amen. He I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire &gt;&gt; and his fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor. Amen. There's a purging power. Come. He's telling the people, "Repent. Make ready." Amen. There's a purging power. Amen. Amen. That will that will will come into a man's life that will you'll never be the same. There's a purging power, amen, that will burn away sin. There's a purging power, amen, that will cause a separation, amen, from your friends and from your associates, amen, it will cause a separation from the world. &gt;&gt; Separate you so he remember John wants to prepare them not for himself but for the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. come. There's a purging power. There's a cleansing power coming. It's right here. And when that comes, he will take you up into his garner and the chaff will be burnt. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It causes separation from the dead and it consolidates the life and it brings it to it brings us to its purpose. Help me Lord this morning. the fire of God will burn out that old life. &gt;&gt; He was so positive that it was there. &gt;&gt; He was so positive there was a cleansing power. He was so positive there was someone there that could change a person's life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. To where there's nothing left but the seed. Amen. Are you positive this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Many believed. Many believed because of John. Many believed. And I say, "Why do you believe this morning?" Why do you believe this morning? Amen. Jesus said, "Believe on him whom God has sent." And God sent a man in this hour. Amen. Amen. A man sent from God. A man anointed with the spirit of Elijah, a man called for a purpose. John had a strange birth. No doubt. He was dead in his his mother's womb. And there the name of Jesus was spoken. Life came. But here come a man sent from God that had a peculiar birth himself. There born in the cabin in a cabin in the mountains of Kentucky where a light appeared at the window of his birth. And that light came in as a testimony is. And that light came in and whirled around. Brother just they described it. They said it was about the size of a pillow and it settled over where he was. And he says here at 7 years old when I was packing little molasses bucket there was a voice that spoke out of a bush in a whirlwind told me to never drink or smoke or defile my body in any way that there be a work for me to do when I get older. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; God's keeping power for his profit. &gt;&gt; Come on. Brother Brand would go on until later on got older and it's crazy. He's carrying water to a steel and his father is running the steel and here this voice tells him don't ever smoke, don't ever drink or defile your body. And here he's in this situation. He's carrying water to a steel. And there they begin to make fun of him that why he wouldn't drink or wouldn't take a sip. A brown that never drank. I'm not I'm not trying to make this about brother Brandham. We'll try to finish up here. But there's a keeping power that God has. &gt;&gt; If you got a purpose in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; There he tried to take a drink. Tried and some wouldn't let him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Voice spoke again. Don't never drink. And he threw it down. They made fun of him. years later they were smoking. They were making fun of him because he wasn't smoking. He tried so hard to smoke that. He tried so hard. &gt;&gt; Said, "Give me that." &gt;&gt; But it blew out. The voice spoke again. Amen. God had a purpose for this &gt;&gt; this man. Amen. He would cause many to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every one of you. But I'm here because a prophet came in this hour. Because God sent a prophet. Amen. And that that ministry has had an influence on all of us. Because God had an influence on his life and kept him for a purpose. And that's why we're here. Not just because of brother Brown, because of that God sent ministry to turn our hearts back to the faith of the Bible. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you positive this morning? &gt;&gt; Glory. Later in life, he would be baptizing in the Ohio River after revival, baptizing about 500. And there as the 17th person, how would you like to be standing there? &gt;&gt; While the while he was baptizing the 17th person, a light came down and a voice was heard saying, "As John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming of Christ, so will your message forun the second coming." See, God had a purpose. Amen. He was born to be a witness of the light to point people back to the word. Amen. That all men might believe. That we might believe. Amen. That was the purpose of that ministry. Amen. Not to point him us to himself. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But to point us to Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We believe what we believe this morning because our hearts have been turned. &gt;&gt; Thank you &gt;&gt; by that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And I'll read just a few quotes here and we'll finish up. He says in anointed ones at the end time, he says, "I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are. I'm only one I'm only one that's near when he does it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I was only a voice that he used to say it. I wasn't It wasn't what I knew. Forgive my my speech. It wasn't what I knew. It it's it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. No, it's the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. &gt;&gt; It's not a man. It's God. It's the an angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. And he is the one you're feeding on. You're not feeding on a man and his word. His words will fail, but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown never put it on himself. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He was just standing there &gt;&gt; when God came. &gt;&gt; Amen. He pointed the people to Christ. &gt;&gt; He says, "I was just standing there." He said, "It wasn't my voice. It was the manifestation." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not that I'm the son of man. It was the manifestation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; I wish I I got a little bit more to go here. &gt;&gt; Matthew 3 again 13. Then Jesus cometh, I'll finish up on this, from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh to us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he suffered him. Have you ever, and brother Brandham goes over this, and I've thought this myself, have you ever ever wondered why Jesus had to be baptized? So when we we we become when we come baptized, we repent of our sins, but he didn't have any sins to repent of. Why? Why did he have to be baptized? The brother said, "Why would this person be baptized in as an act of repentance and confession when he was holy, spotless, unadulterated son of the living God? Why would this person have to be baptized like a man coming?" He said he had no confession to make because he was God. Why would he have to be baptized under repentance? Amen. If he was the infallible God, he said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. Why would he have to be baptized? But Jesus said, "Suffer to be so." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Suffer it to be so, for it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness." And Jesus was a type of the high priest. Amen. And the priest would be anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and before he could be anointed, he had to be washed. And brother Rams and he says in in Exodus there, he says, "And Aaron and his son shall bring unto the door the tabernacle of the congregation and shall wash them with water." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he goes on there and he said, "And thou shalt take the anointing oil and pour it upon the head and anoint him." He says, "See, the high priest, before he could ever be anointed, he had to be washed with water." And therefore, when Jesus, before he could be anointed, here's the truth of it. Before he could be anointed, before the dove, the Holy Ghost could descend upon him, our high priest, he had to be washed with water. Oh my. He had to fulfill, Amen. what the scripture said of him. Oh my. And there, amen, the word came to the word in the water. And John said, "I have need to be baptized of thee." And Jesus said, "Suff it to be so." Amen. The word's got to be fulfilled. Amen. What a testament that is this this morning. Amen. Every word of God has got to be fulfilled. Everything's got to come to pass. Amen. We We've all got our part to play &gt;&gt; in the fulfilling of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Meet the prophet in the water &gt;&gt; and be washed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves to a prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That he he told us didn't come from him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Wasn't the seventh angel was the manifestation of the son of man. You're not feeding on the words of a man, but it's the unfailing body word of the son of man. Is that what you're feeding upon? &gt;&gt; S. Are you positive of that? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, man. is stand this morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; If Jesus had to be washed, if the lamb of God had to be washed, he subjected himself to John the messenger anointed with the spirit of Elijah so that the word could be fulfilled. What about you and I? &gt;&gt; It's not just with water. &gt;&gt; Amen. But with the blood, the bleeding word to be washed. Amen. We've got some that's going to meet him in the water this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not we're not pointing to something that's going to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're telling them that something is here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a Holy Ghost here that can fill every fiber of their hearts, of their lives. You say, "They're too young. John the Baptist was a baby." &gt;&gt; Nobody's too young. &gt;&gt; That's just an idea that we have. Well, they've got to wait till a certain age. That's just an idea that we have. Amen. I believe he can do it this morning. The promise is unto you and to your children. Amen. The promise of the Holy Ghost. Amen. I believe he's present to fulfill his promise. He's present to fulfill his word this morning. Amen. If we'll do our part, &gt;&gt; if we'll come to the water and be washed, if we'll come to every church service and come with a heart open to the word of God, God will come and do his part. You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning? Amen. God bless you. Amen. If you if you need prayer this morning, if you need anything, the altar's open. This is just a a physical place, but find yourself at Calvary. &gt;&gt; That's where the change takes place. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's where you die out to yourself. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Gra grasp that by faith. Have a vision of that. find yourselves at the feet of Jesus. I don't like to pull on nobody, but there's a tug at your heart. If you need prayer, if you need anything this morning, we'll be happy to pray with you. God bless you. Amen. Give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away so you can use me. Here I am. Here I stand. Lord, my life is in your hands. Lord, I longing to see [Music] reveal me. I give myself away. [Applause] I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. [Applause] I give myself away. So you can use me. Take my heart. Take my life as a livinging sacrifice. [Music] All my dreams, all my plans, Lord, I praise them in your hands with my hearts. I give myself away. Oh, I give myself away. You can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away so you can hear. [Music] Amen. Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? And we're going to worship just for a few moments while those that are being baptized are going to head to the baptismal. Let's sing that song. In the presence of Jehovah, a key of seed.
