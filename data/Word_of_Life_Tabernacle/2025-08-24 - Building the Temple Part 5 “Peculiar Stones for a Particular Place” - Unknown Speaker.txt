Oh yes, for the grace that you have given us. So thankful, Lord. Oh, I can't repay from my heart. I'd like to say that I thank you. Let's bow our heads for just a moment. Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for the grace that you've given us. Lord, for the mercy that we find in your word and the the the power and the strength that it gives us to go on, knowing that though we were sinners, yet you we've been washed by your blood.

I pray that you'd help us to walk worthy of the vocation that we've been called to, Lord, to do, Lord, the thing that you've called for us to do. I pray you'd grant it today. Help us as we hear your word, Lord. May we may we not just hear it, but may we be doers of the word, Lord. May we become the word that you've given us in this hour. We pray for you to heal every sick person. Touch everybody, Lord. Every soul, every spirit, we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. And God bless you this morning. Uh you can be seated for just a moment. I uh Sister Lori, did you want to give that testimony this morning? Could you do that? Uh we're going to have Sister Lori come up and uh she's going to testify about some things the Lord has done. Uh and uh we just we just love the Lord. Aren't you Aren't you always happy to hear testimonies of the goodness of God? Amen. That's good. going to give you something to talk with, don't I? &gt;&gt; Well, I text Brother Ben this morning because God has done so much for our church and for people in our church. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I felt like I wanted to give God all the glory if I can get through this without crying. Uh it started a few weeks away when we had the meeting. Uh you all know Sister Fritz wears oxygen, had to wear oxygen, was weak and and so uh after the meetings, it was the dinner we had and we walked over there. She was pretty weak, couldn't hardly walk. And I pulled up over there and we got her in there and we sitting there at the table and and she uh she seen brother Daryl walk by and she said, "Would you mind going over there and telling him to come over? I'd like to shake his hand before he leaves. I may not get to shake his hand again." So I said, "I don't mind." So I went over there and got him. And I said, "Brother Daryl," I said, "You see that little lady over there sitting at the table?" And he said, "That little lady with an oxygen on." I said, "Yeah." I said, "That's sister Fritz. she want to wants to uh talk to you and shake your hand. So he went over there and didn't even get his food. He just left and went right over there and and she said, "I'd like to shake your hand and tell you how I appreciate your ministry." And and might not never get to shake your hand again. And there was some words said and he kneels down there right there in the middle of the dinner and I was sitting on the other side and I knew it was a moment in time. He started praying for her. And although she may be 91 years old, God is no respector person. &gt;&gt; And I know she's got her mind that she's she's older than us and and it's maybe time for her to go on, but God knows all of that. Well, he he knelt down there and I heard his words. He said, "Lord," he said, "I pray you'll renew her strength." And he said, "Get her off this oxygen." And I thought that was kind of odd why he said that. So all the way home we we talked about that and I thought that was something, you know, I thought, why would he say that? She never even asked him for prayer, nothing. And I we got to talking about I thought, you know, she didn't even have the strength enough to come through the prayer line, but God knew he knew what she needed. &gt;&gt; So anyway, she got home and that week, uh, we talked every evening. We kind of talked to each other before we go to bed and we got to talking about it. She said one night she said, "Lori, I'm not on my oxygen no more." And I said, "Well, praise the Lord." During the day she's been leaving it off, just having it at night. Then a couple days later, she said, "Guess what? I'm not using it at night anymore." &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I said, "Thank the Lord." And so, anyway, uh, she said, "You know, Lori, I've had a battle. The devil you, of course, the Lord don't do anything but the devil tries to come and put fear in your mind." And so she'd lay down and she'd say thoughts would come to my mind and the devil would try to say, "You're not going to wake up cuz you ain't got your oxygen on." And she said, "I got to thinking. I thought, well, if I don't, I'll be in a better place, you know." So anyway, that going on to that, uh, she'd been on oxygen for over two years. She's not on oxygen no more. So anyway, I got one more thing to say. So, uh, since the meetings, it really been on my burden on my heart that she'd have to go to the hospital. I don't know if y'all know anything about Sister Fritz, but she's got a condition where her bone marrow doesn't make blood anymore. And she has to go every month, every two months for blood transfusions. And she don't have very little blood for when she goes in to get her blood drawn, they have to stick her and stick her and stick her. and she'd stay all day long after they told her she'd have to go get blood transfusions. It would take sometimes all day long. So, uh, she had to go to the doctor this week and every time this has been going on for months, she had to go to the doctor this week. She's been going for transfusions every month, every uh, she'd stay all day and come home and the last few times she's done it, she's told me, she said, "Lori, I don't feel no stronger." Well, about a about uh a week before the meeting, she told me. She said, "Lori, I'm so weak." I remember coming into her house one Sunday and she said, "I'm so weak." After a blood transfusion, she said, she said, "I I just don't know what I'm going to do this tomorrow. I don't know if I can make it." And I said, "Well, are you going to go to church?" And and she looked at me, she said, "Yes, I am." So, we come on and that was the day brother Harvey brought her in and she'd been so weak. So anyway, brother Bruce had to take her, he took her to her doctor's appointment this week. He made a statement to her and he said, "You know, Sister Fritz, he said, uh, you know, God took care of your oxygen." And he said, "He's going next is going to be your blood." So she goes in there and, uh, she called me that night. She said, "You know, Lori," she said, "Uh, they usually have to stick me so many times to even get blood." She said, "They got it on the first stick. And I said, "You know what?" I said, "God is God is making blood for you." &gt;&gt; So anyway, she went to the doctor and she got home and the next day I was at my job and my phone rings and it was sister Fritz and I didn't get it. So I called her back and she said, "I just got to tell you something." She said, "The doctor said I don't have to have a blood transfusion. First time in three years." So, I just want to give God the praise. And we talk every night and I tell her, I'd say, "Sister Fritz, there's nothing too hard for God." And I told her, I said, "Whose report are we going to believe?" &gt;&gt; And I said, "I don't care how old or how young you are." I said, "God is still the healer." &gt;&gt; So, I just want to give God praise for that. Amen. If you can do it for Sister Fritz, he can do it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many love our sister Fritz back there? Don't you love Sister Fritz? She meant so much to us and our family. It's just hard to put into words. But the Lord can do that. And he's done so much for us just lately. And you know the devil just keep trying to attack and come and and attack. But you just remember it's just another opportunity for God to show himself faithful. He's still the rock. How many believe that today? He's our rock. He's our salvation. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Amen. My we could just rejoice right now and go home and say it was good to be in the house of the Lord, but we'll get into the word this morning and I'll try not to hold you real long. Amen. We just love the Lord so much for doing that for our sister. And just believing this morning is going to be another time when when chains are broken off and people are healed and and our minds are restored and renewed and things are different for us. Brother Brandham said we never leave here the same way that we came in. &gt;&gt; So let's just leave better than when we came in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's leave change from this building. We don't we don't waste opportunities in the presence of the Lord. Tonight we're going to have a youth service for the youth by the youth. And so you old folks, older folks don't have to come, but if you do want to come, you're welcome to to sit in in the back of the building and encourage them. And and uh but we're going to do that at 3:00 this afternoon. First Kings chapter 5 and verse 15 says, "And Solomon had three score and 10,000 that bear burdens and four score thousand hewers in the mountains. beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work 3,300 which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hued stones to lay the foundation of the house. And Solomon's builders and Hyram's builders did hue them, and the stone squarers. So they prepared timber and stones to build the house. Amen. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning to build a temple, a building of the size of the temple and and with that kind of splendor that it had. Uh they had to obtain raw materials. In fact, there was so much gold in the temple that if you valued it at today's prices, it would be worth $360 billion. And and they overlaid the entire interior of the temple with gold. And on the exterior, it was stone. And the building, the structure was made of stone. And then on the inside, they overlaid that and and a ways coating of of wood on the inside. And so it had to be obtained. It had to be sourced. It had to be carefully prepared uh just for that temple. And I believe that God prepares his people in the same way that he's brought them from different places, different backgrounds, different earth, if you will. And he's dug them out and shaped them to be a part of the house of God. We are the house of God today. We are the temple of God. And so he has shaped us to be what we are and to fit in a certain place. And it was such that in 1 kings 6:7 it says, "And the house when it was in building was built of stone, made ready before it was brought thither, so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building." So by the time it was put into the house, it was actually uh fit so well together that it actually they didn't have to make any adjustments. Now, think about that for a minute. If you've ever been part of a building project and you bought pre-cut lumber or pre-cut or you had some kind of thing like that, there's always some adjustment that you've got to make. Maybe the lot's not perfectly level. Maybe things just aren't perfect. If you've remodeled a house, Allan, if you've been remodeling, you know this. It nothing works out the way that you envision it just exactly. It's it's going to be a little bit different. and you're going to have to make some adjustments. But these things worked out just exactly right because it was in not only was it a natural skill that the builders had, but it was a supernatural element to it that they were inspired to cut it in such a way that it would fit exactly in the temple when it was finished. So each stone and the wood that overlaid it had to be perfectly cut before it got to the construction site. And so they brought down cedars from Lebanon and they floated them in from Japa and hauled them by oxcart and so forth. Brother Brandham says they then they cut all their stones all around the world. But when they come together they were such perfect masonry. Perfect masonry. In 40 years in the building of the temple there wasn't a buzz of a saw or a sound of a hammer. every stone went, he said, "One was cut this way, one was cut that way, one was cut back this way, but every one of them went together." And I think as we begin to look at the differences in the stones and even the differences in how they were cut, it would have been impossible for you to envision just by looking at one single pile of stones what the end result was going to be. But there had to be an overwhelming uh uh there had to be a vision and a pattern that would show us what the total what the what it would look like. But it's very difficult to see the full temple in any particular piece of stone. And yet that particular stone was cut for that particular place. If we could say it this way, it was a peculiar stone cut for a particular place. A peculiar stone cut for a particular place. I believe that's what each one of us are this morning. We may be a peculiar stone, but God cut us, brother JT, for a particular place in the house of God. We belong somewhere in the building of God. And so, and brother Brandham said, the Bible is the structure. He said, "But the Holy Spirit's building the building." Now, he said, "Certainly, it's got to frame together and look like this and like that and like that, but the Holy Spirit's putting it together." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said just as Solomon's temple was cut out all over the world, one block was cut this way, one cut that way. When they come together, he said every block went right to its place without a buzz of a saw or a sound of a hammer. He said, "The great church of the living God is born again stones cut out." &gt;&gt; Right? Born again stones cut out. So when you when you're born again, when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God isn't done with you yet. Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that because I wasn't what I am today a year ago, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, and I'm not today what I will be tomorrow. But I know if God's still working on me, then there's a product to finish. I'm not happy with what I am. I believe I believe I have the Holy Ghost. I believe God has given me very great things in in my life, blessings in my life, and given me people that that love me. And I I appreciate that. But yet, I know that there's more that God wants out of my life. We should never be completely satisfied with where we are at any particular place in time. Because we know we're headed for something. We're meant to be somewhere. We're meant to fit in a right particular place. A peculiar stone for a very particular place. Brother Brandham said, I he said, I want you to notice one stone was cut this way, another stone cut another way. Perhaps when the masons were cutting them, he said, now listen, he said they might have argued and fussed and everything else, &gt;&gt; the masons might have argued and fussed. Why? Because they were cutting different stones &gt;&gt; for different purposes, &gt;&gt; right? So the masons get, you know, to talking to one another and and and they get to fussing with one another and you can imagine what it must have been like as one maybe he's got a very small instrument and a tool and he's he's doing his uh his cutting in a very fine way, a precise way, cutting small stones. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And another one he's got great big stones. Some of the stones in the temple were I think 600 tons. They were huge stones, foundation stones, and he's just got an axe and he's cutting them with a with a great big stone axe or stone hammer, a sledgehammer, and and he's cutting his great big piece of stone. And here's this other one cutting a very small piece of stone. And and he's looking over at him and saying, "What is what what good is that? It's so big. Where's that going to go? What use is that going to be?" And someone else with his small piece, he's saying, "What good could that big old stone be?" or or the big piece say what good is that little bit of stone but it was all going into the temple. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham said the masons begin to fuss and I think that's where we get caught up a lot of times as preachers is we begin to fuss with one another maybe because another church isn't exactly like ours or maybe because our church isn't exactly like what we want it to be. We say well I wish that brother Ben would do it this way or brother Joel would do it this way or brother so and so would do it this way. when actually it may be that God's using the way the man is made and the way his his particular skill in the gospel his particular gift to cut the stone a certain way to fit in a certain place to meet the challenge of a certain hour that gives me hope if there's something bigger than us I don't know how to prepare these young people to meet the challenge of the next 20 years if there is another 20 years I don't know how to I don't know how to to guide the people in that way but I know God does and I know he'll use me to do that. He'll use other ministers to do that. &gt;&gt; So they said, they may have argued and fussed and everything else like a bunch of preachers does today. &gt;&gt; I'm the Methodist. I'm the church of God. Glory to God. I belong to the assemblies. I this. He said, "You keep fussing." But remember, it's God is the one that's doing the cutting. &gt;&gt; Oh, he can use a man. He will use men. That's what he uses. He don't use mechanical devices. He uses men, but God's the one doing the cutting. He said, "You fuss if you want to. You argue if you want to, but God does the cutting." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is doing the cutting. And we don't always understand. We want to hurry things along and we want to make something happen, but it's God's stone, &gt;&gt; right? It's his rock, &gt;&gt; his peculiar rock that he made and pre-ordained before the foundation of the world to be a part of this house of God. &gt;&gt; Right? Not all the rock in the world was chosen to be a part of the temple, but the rock that was chosen to be a part of the temple was pre-ordained by God. I &gt;&gt; I hope we can catch this this morning. It was pre-ordained by God to fit a particular time and a particular place and a particular need in the house of God. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says there a bunch of preachers said, "I belong to the assemblies." He said, "You keep fussing. Remember, it's God is the one doing the cutting." And when this cuts this way and one that way, they couldn't understand. And I think it's a it's a mistake &gt;&gt; to try to make all of our churches the same. &gt;&gt; Come on. to try to do everything just like somebody else does them. &gt;&gt; And I think we could go a little bit further and make that even in our own individual lives. It's a mistake to try to be somebody else. &gt;&gt; I could never be brother Jeremy. Brother Jeremy could never be me. But we belong in the house of God, &gt;&gt; right? We got a particular place and and many times we discount somebody else because they don't fit our place. Or maybe our idea, maybe this we have an idea what a pastor should be or what a what an evangelist should be or what a song leader ought to be, what a what a piano player ought to be and we we got this particular idea and if they don't fit our cutting the way we've been cut, we think, well, you know, they must not fit at all. No, they just fit a different place than you fit. And that don't even mean they fit a different church. They just fit a different place in the church, &gt;&gt; right? There's things that they can do maybe that you can't do. things that they can do maybe that I can't do. That don't mean they're not they're not children of God. It's just they've been cut a certain way. They've been prepared for a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And God may he may prepare someone for years. One stone may be ready early and not take much cutting &gt;&gt; and another stone might take years. Very good. &gt;&gt; And the more unique the stone, &gt;&gt; the more important the place that where it fits, &gt;&gt; right? Because it fits a spot where there's a change &gt;&gt; in the architecture. So he said the whole thing was laying on the ground. When they went to put it together, the whole thing was laying on the ground and they put it block on block on block and didn't have to cut no more. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, 'I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of Church goes together. Now, you all going to start recognizing this quote now. This is the same quote. He said, "And the new pope is brought out of the United States." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And put over there according to prophecy. I believe we've seen that. People get mixed up in that because they see a new pope from the US and they think, "Well, that means that the the tribulation's coming and now we're in the tribulation." No, that's not what that means. It just means prophecy was fulfilled, &gt;&gt; right? What was the prophecy? Revelation 13, &gt;&gt; right? That America, there would be a uniting of that power. There would be an image to the beast, &gt;&gt; right? And so, Brother Brandham takes that and says there has to be an American pope. And so, he said when the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy, then they'll then they'll form an image like into the beast. So, I believe we're living in those times, &gt;&gt; right? We're living in those times, but that doesn't mean that that doesn't mean it happened tomorrow. Are you with me now? We don't even know if this pope will be the one that becomes the incarnate. We don't know that. &gt;&gt; Right. But what we do know is that prophecy has been fulfilled in our day. &gt;&gt; Right? And if that prophecy has been fulfilled, then what's brother Brandham talking about? He said when that happens, he said I tell you the true church of God will be drove together. The real true believers out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Nazarene, pilgrim holiness, whatever they'll be will cemented by the love of God. He said, "That'll make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, all the believers and agnostics and shallow minded will be cast to one side, they'll go right on into the confederation of churches." I want to be a part of what God's doing in our day. So, if the Pope from America has come in our time, then it must be time for the temple to be put together. It must be Hallelujah. must be time for the for the Masons to stop fussing with one another and begin to realize just because your church is different don't mean that they're not part of the program of God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; So they they were cutting different stones &gt;&gt; different ways, &gt;&gt; right? And part of maturity is recognizing our uniqueness and not being uh you know when when you're little and have you ever seen young people get mad? I say young people little kids get mad because they all want to play a different game, &gt;&gt; right? And and so they some of you kids have done that. I know. I've been out here and you see one of them crying, you know, and fussing and what is it that Well, nobody else will play the game she wanted to play or he wanted to play, right? And so they they won't they'll just pull off by themselves and and and they'll cry about it for a while and then pretty soon they're back playing a game they forgot all about it. But they've actually what they're doing is is they're trying to make all the other kids enjoy what they enjoy. And that's just not the way that we're made. And as you get older, you realize that there are things we can enjoy together, but we're different and that's okay. There's families that are different from one another. There's families that are are enjoy board games and they play those. There's other families that would be bored by board games, right? There's family in our family, we always enjoyed getting together. It was real loud. We'd play rook. I don't know if I should admit to that, but but we play rook. We didn't gamble on rook. We just played rook, you know, and didn't use the real cards, so we thought we was okay, you know, and so we played with Rook and Rook and we we loved that game. That was that was it was so But there's people who don't do that, right? And and there's people who who sit together. I've seen families that would get together and they'd all just sit there, &gt;&gt; right? And they just be happy in each other's company. And that makes me nervous, right? If we're not all talking at the same time, something's wrong, right? And so, but it don't it's just a difference in the way a family is cut out, &gt;&gt; right? It don't mean, you know, me and and uh me and and brother Harold can get together and I do almost all the talking and and then maybe get together with somebody else and they do almost all the talking, &gt;&gt; right? Because there's different levels of that, &gt;&gt; right? And and and there's nothing wrong with that. But many times what'll happen is we'll only want to hang out around people like us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Who have the interest we do. And and some of that's natural and that you would hang out around people that have the same interest in things that you do. But but but some of that is just uh you know, you got to reach a place where you where you say, "Lord, what do you want out of my life? What do you want me who do you want me to hang out with? Where do you want me to be? &gt;&gt; What do you want me to be a part of? what what kind of a a place or position do what what do you want out of my life? Because we know sometimes it helps us to be around people who are different from us. And some people who do things completely different from us might actually be a way for us to to change and be cut in a way that God would want us so we could fit in not into the church so much as fit in to the to the family of God, to the house of God, &gt;&gt; to the people of God. So because the stones looked different, the masons fussed one with another. But now look, but when the stones came together, they made exactly the building that God wanted. &gt;&gt; Now we know the masons are preachers, right? The stonemasons, I mean, not the Freemasons, but the stonemasons were preachers. They they were stone cutters, stone squarers, as the Bible puts it. So they're preachers. Now in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 9, you say, "Why are they preachers?" Because that's the way God chose to do it. &gt;&gt; Right? I didn't do that. God did that. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:9, we are laborers together with God. You are God's husbandry. You are God's building. &gt;&gt; Right? We should never forget that. &gt;&gt; You are God's building. You're not my building, you're God's building. &gt;&gt; So, everybody's not going to fit into my idea. Everybody's not going to fit into even what I can help them with. &gt;&gt; Right? But some there there's something there's some ministry somewhere that can help you. There there's some something that God has for you. Many times we look at that and say, "Well, I'm not getting I'm not getting fed." And maybe we look at somebody else and say, "Well, they must not be getting fed either." But that may not necessarily be the case because there's some people who could never sit under a ministry like mine. I realize that I wasn't called to preach to everybody. But if you were if I was called to preach to you even for a season of your life, then there'll be something inside that'll respond to the word, &gt;&gt; right? Even if you're not a loud person, you may not say amen or raise your hand, but there'll be something inside that is convicted by the word and changed by the word and things are made different in your life. But so Paul says, "According to the grace of God, which is given unto me as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon." He goes on to say, "Some men build with hay, and some men build with combustible materials, but others build with the jewels of God and with the right kind of stones." So, brother Brandham taught us that actually he said confessions are stones or we could say it like this maybe people who have made confessions, right? So, when you confess Christ, when you believe on Christ, you're you're a stone that God can work with. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe, then there's nothing there to work with. But if you believe, if you confess that Jesus is God, then God can begin to work on you. Yes, &gt;&gt; we find that in Peter's confession that he made. But what what good is a stone if there isn't a stonemason? Brother says to there to shape him into a son of God. He said, "You're just piling up a bunch of rocks." Is that right? It isn't doing a bit of good. You see, he said, "The water we wear away the stone." See, that's right. That's the people. He said, "What good is stones if you haven't got a true stonemason with a good sharp tool to shape him into the fitting place in the house of God?" And so I I want to, you know, kind of introduce to this what we're talking about to this idea of just because we don't like what's being preached doesn't mean we don't need it. &gt;&gt; Right? Do you ever think of that? &gt;&gt; I know there are people and I I've met people who are none of you are this way. I don't I don't believe. But I have met people who will only their ears only perk up when they hear a certain kind of preaching, right? And so they'll maybe it's real evangelistic preaching or some like teaching like really really educated intellectual teaching. And so when they hear that kind of preaching, their ears prick up and they begin to listen and they kind of shut everything else out and they sit there and say, "Well, you know, it's another service and another time and I really wish I could hear brother so and so preach because then he would explain this to me then it would make sense what the brother's saying." But many times what we need to hear isn't what we want to hear. Right? And it may not even fit in our natural uh ability of hearing, but there's something that we need. And God knows what we need. &gt;&gt; And so, he's able to take me or take brother Joel or brother Stewart or able to take one of the brothers we have in Brother Nathan last week. He's able, Brother Nathan had a way of saying things that I just can't put it like that, right? There's nothing in me to preach like that. And yet, Brother Nathan's completely different from Brother Andrew Glover or somebody like that. So, you look at that and think or Brother Window Martin. You look at the differences in the ministry. You say, "Well, uh, here's a brother that can really, really lay it in. That's what I like." But maybe what we need to hear is what we're hearing. I believe God cares enough about us that he'll send the right people at the right time. He'll put us in the right pile, so to speak, so we can hear what God wants us to hear. He's allowed you to be in this pile of rocks this morning. Not just so we could come together, but so we could be cut into what God wants us to be. I say, God, let me be cut. Let me be shaped. Let me be changed. &gt;&gt; He said, I just want to ask you, what good's decisions? What good are you putting your name on the book? What good is come join the church if the stonemason isn't there that'll shape that? And it's kind of interesting here. He said, "Make them quit this and that. &gt;&gt; Cut them. Make them over this way. square them up and make them like Christians that sits in the house of God with signs following the believers. &gt;&gt; He said that's end time evangelism taking the stones and shaping them. &gt;&gt; But now every stonemason didn't get to just cut how he wanted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he's cutting according to the pattern, &gt;&gt; right? He's cutting according to the word. So I don't get to just come out here and chop things, you know, and and just use a broad sword and just cut. I see this is a problem, so I just cut it off, kill it, whatever that I don't get to do that, right? What I get to do is I have to be inspired to preach, right? There's got to be something. So, I get along with God and pray and these other brothers do the same thing. What can I bring to the young people? What can I bring to the elders? What can I bring to the church that would be a help to the church? I don't want to just preach. I I want to follow the blueprint. I want to make sure it's in the word. It's got to be in the word, &gt;&gt; right? Because if I go to cutting things that aren't in the word, I get in trouble. Right? Because I may only cut a part of it and someone else may cut another part. But if I get to cutting outside the word, you're never going to fit in his building because his building is 100% the word. &gt;&gt; It come from his thoughts, from his mind. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So end time evangelism is is me being inspired to a portion of the word and preaching that to the people. And remember Noah Noah had to cut a certain part. He had a certain thing to preach. And they said, "Why are you preaching the same thing over and over, but it was Noah's job to cut that way. That was his job to preach. Every one of us have got a job to do. We got something to cut on. We got something we can we can be a part of and something that that that we need." &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope we're hearing it this morning. Good. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham actually makes a statement, excuse me, makes a statement that the stones would actually be better off left where they were &gt;&gt; than gathered together if they were not shaped. &gt;&gt; Look it up. He said they'd be better off if they weren't going to be shaped to be left. He said, "Because they might be useful &gt;&gt; somewhere else, but if you're going to if we're going to come together, we got to let the word shape us." &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham said, "They've got to be cut &gt;&gt; and fit into the program of God by gifts and callings and placed into the church as they should be must be." So God didn't limit that just to a prophet, right? Even a prophet has to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Brother said the way you know he's a prophet is by saying what a previous prophet said, &gt;&gt; right? So you don't just get to make it up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the prophet what he he's a he's a stone cutter for the age. But God also called pastors. &gt;&gt; Huh? God called evangelists. God called apostles. God called teachers. He called him what for? To cut in a particular way out of this group that's been cut out by the message. There are ministry. There's ministries that's meant to cut in a particular way within the the the framework of that message. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So within the framework, it has to stay within the message. It's got we got to say what he said. But but yet we have a unique way and and a local church is sovereign in that. a local pastor who's sovereign in that in the way that the stones are cut in that particular place. Now, brother Ram said they got to be cut by gifts and callings. Again, he said, "What good is a stone without a stonemason with the sharp word of God to cut him into a son of God or daughter of God and place him in the church where he belongs?" Rolling up stones won't make the building. You got to cut them and shape them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; He said, "We need men today, anointed men like Amos was that would cut the world away from that woman." He said, "Make her a daughter of God. Cut that world away from the man regardless of how many trustees throw him out." I thank God for good trustees. Today's Brother Bill's birthday and I'm preaching on trustees, but thank God for good trustees. But he said regardless how many trustees throw him out or anything else, he would stand on thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he preached the gospel because that's his business. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; See, we're not in the business of piling up rocks. &gt;&gt; Though I love to see them. I'd like to see a great big pile of rocks, &gt;&gt; right? Empty pews didn't ever inspire anybody, &gt;&gt; right? But I'd like to see a great big pile of rocks, but that's not our business. &gt;&gt; Our business is not seeing how many rocks we can pile up, &gt;&gt; but the ones that God give us. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there's some that I can't do anything for. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; There's some that Brother Joel could never touch or I could never touch. We could never do anything for. But God's called us to do something for the ones we're preaching to. &gt;&gt; Right? And it's important that we realize that there's a particular stone cutter that is cutting a particular stone, a peculiar stone for a particular place. And it's important that we don't use our influence to bring other stones into our pile more than what we can cut. &gt;&gt; Right? That's why I don't believe in prociding. I know some of y'all come from different churches and I appreciate you choosing to come here. We have an open door policy. You come where you feel led to come &gt;&gt; and go where you feel led to go. Listen, this isn't a cult. If you decide to go somewhere else, I I'll pray for you just as much as I ever did. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's that's just what we are. I don't believe in that nonsense of trying to hold people. We I preach if there's five people here, I preach to five people. Or if there's 500. I believe God has given us a great responsibility, but we're not in the business of holding people. If God called them to be in our particular pile, then let's shape what we've got. &gt;&gt; Let's work with what we've got. &gt;&gt; There's so many men by influence. And I see that even in the message, but especially in denominational circles by influencer trying to pull one away cuz he's a big tithe payer. Pull this one because he's got this uh gift or that gift and and I would love to have all the gifts, you know, just pile. But you can't use them all, &gt;&gt; there's a place, &gt;&gt; right? There's somewhere you can be a help. &gt;&gt; There's somewhere you can make a difference. And if you're here, I believe that place is here. If you're here listening to me this morning, I mean, there's a difference you can make for our young people. There's a difference you can make. I'm not trying to take over your life or make you work, but if if there's an opportunity here, there's opportunity to help out with the young people. There's opportunity to be a part of the worship. There's opportunity to be a part if you young men, maybe you feel a call of God in your heart to preach you. There's opportunity for that, but you need to grow up in the fear and admonition of the Lord and and wait on your ministry and things, but there's opportunity for that one day. You see our young men and becoming something in their life. I I I'm proud of some of them. I really am. And but you see the differences even in them. &gt;&gt; Some are reluctant and some are shy and &gt;&gt; some at certain stages in their life, they're only interested in certain things, you know. Others are just interested in people, good with people. &gt;&gt; I uh man, he's looking at me, so I'm going to call him out. But uh Maddie, I've watched Mattie in our uh in our uh banquet and anytime we get the kids together, Matt's a star and and and he is in a good way. &gt;&gt; He he he leads people. And I you'll see that I don't know what God's going to do in Matney's life, but I'll say this. Let God shape you. &gt;&gt; Let God shape you. Don't don't just don't don't don't discount what God might do in your life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Look, I didn't I wouldn't have put myself where I'm at. &gt;&gt; I was a peculiar stone &gt;&gt; for a particular place. &gt;&gt; And it works because God put it together. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We can't put it together ourselves. It works because God puts it together. We can't make these young men preachers or these young ladies preachers wives or or deacons or deacons wife. We can't do that. But if God put that in your heart, there's something there that you can do it. Something in your heart that you you know there's something there. You want to help people. And I say don't limit God. Let God You may be different from the other deacons. That don't mean you're not called. &gt;&gt; You may be different from the other preachers. That don't mean you're not called, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You may lead songs differently than somebody else. That don't mean you're not supposed to do it. Just do what God called you to do. Be what God called you to be. I want to encourage our young people with that. Just because you can't sing like somebody else don't mean you shouldn't sing. Just because you can't clap like somebody else don't mean you shouldn't clap. Just because you you you don't Maybe that's a bad analogy. Just because you don't uh play like somebody else don't mean you shouldn't play. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You should do what God wants you to do. And there's something you can do that'll be a benefit to the house of God. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want just listen, just because a man's a man of God doesn't mean he knows the will of God for your life. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon taught us to be wary of men that had all the answers, &gt;&gt; right? Somebody come up and say, "I know what you should do." I had a young man tell me one time, he may be listening, I don't know, but listen to this, but he told me, he said, "Brother Ben, if you tell me to move to go to your church," he said, "I will." I said, "Brother, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. &gt;&gt; Because if I tell you to move, then I'm responsible for you. &gt;&gt; This might not be the place for you. &gt;&gt; But if you if you if you want to move, let it let God do the moving." &gt;&gt; Huh? And he's being used in another place, in another way. Man, I'm glad for that. I'm happy for that. It's important that we don't we don't press on people into something that even brother Brandham dealt with that that the people he said that a bunch of preachers got around him and said, "You can do it, brother Brandham. You can do it, brother Brandham." &gt;&gt; Remember and he overexlained the second pole &gt;&gt; and he said it brought a bunch of carnal impersonations &gt;&gt; because he tried to explain it. This is how you do it. He said he got the line all tangled around him. He said the angel said, "You don't want your line tangled in these kind of times." &gt;&gt; So, we're not trying to force somebody into something. We We just want to preach and let God do what God does. And we just want to be what God We just want to be happy in the house of God. I don't want to see people miserable in God's house. Let's be happy in the house of God. Even if we're hearing something, maybe we think, Lord, why why would he the preacher preach that, but it must be for me, Lord. There must be something there I can attain to, something I can grab a hold of. Lord, I thank you for your word. Amen. A man, you know, he might be a good salesman. That don't mean he has the will of God. You remember the prophet that went out one time, and I'm running out of time, and I'm not nearly done, but I'll quit. I promise at some point. But there was a prophet who'd come by and and he was had a job to do, a young prophet. He had a certain job to do. And the Lord told him, "Don't stop." Right? And and the Lord and an old prophet, the Lord told him what to do, too. And it would be a test to the young prophet. &gt;&gt; And the old prophet was doing the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Telling the young prophet to stop. But the Bible said he respected him so much &gt;&gt; that he stopped. He went to eat at his house. And the old prophet rose up and said, "Cuz you didn't do what the Lord told you to do." &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll be eaten by a lion." That's pretty gruesome, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Huh? But it's important to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; Just because it's an old prophet or just because it's a a good man or just because he's he's a man of God don't mean he knows the will of God for your life. &gt;&gt; You do what God called you to do. See, the Bible said the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ordered by the Lord. And he delightth his in his way. Listen. Oh, I love this. He delightth. Listen. The Lord delights in the way of a of a good man. a born again man. Listen, you young people that are starting out and maybe you don't know what job to do or you don't know exactly what the future's going to hold for you. Remember that that God the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. &gt;&gt; I look at my kids and Peter, you know, he's working in a grocery store right now. I think he's in the back. I can't see him behind that screen, but Peter's working at a grocery store right now. Brother Robert, I never intended that for Peter. And I don't know if that's what his future holds. Who knows? But you know what? God has a way of ordering steps &gt;&gt; to meet the right people at the right time. &gt;&gt; I'm just comfortable this morning. Y'all forgive me. But I got when we got married, you know, when I met my wife, I had nothing. And and I'm not I had less than nothing. I I was a poor man in fellowship with poor people. You know, whether JT remembers or some of y'all, Brother Bill remembers, and I I was poor. I remember I ran out of gas one time in West Plains and JT had to come give me gas and and because I the reason I run out of gas cuz my gas gauge didn't work. And the car cost $700. You'd think they'd put a working gas gauge in it, but you know, I didn't know what I was going to do. I just living life, you know, and not worrying too much about it. Maybe I should have been more concerned looking back at it, but I didn't know. I worked part-time at Burger King and preached. That's what I did. And some of y'all laughing because you know that ain't much money. And so I didn't have nothing. I didn't at the time I when I first, you know, met my wife, I didn't have a car. I had was driving somebody else's car. I was living in a little shack like a trailer that somebody had made for preachers. And I was living in that and I was just happy to do what I was doing, preaching on the weekends and working three or four days a week. And boy, I was just so happy, you know, and I met my wife and said, "Lord, what am I going to do now?" God put her great aunt told uh told me one day said, she said, "You need a better job." And she said, "I I know a company's looking for somebody to do something and it's title works working for an attorney." Well, I I always wanted to be an attorney, but I knew I didn't have the education to work for one. And I thought, well, I can't do that. And I went I remember going to the job interview and I went and sat in the job interview with Harvey Allen who's a judge up here now in the job interview did not go well and he looked at me and basically told me I wouldn't get the job. Two weeks later, they called me and wanted me to come in and I got that job and I stayed in that job for in in in not the same office but in that particular job for 15 years doing land title examinations and made a career out of it and and and I couldn't have picked that. Listen, the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord &gt;&gt; and he delights in his way. &gt;&gt; See, by by worry, you can't put yourself in a certain position. You may not be cut out even to do what you're wanting to do. Don't worry about it. Let God do what God does. You just work when the opportunity presents itself to work. It won't matter. You know, some people are waiting so much on a good job that they failed to take the job that God gave them. &gt;&gt; Right? Let's just do what God allows us to do. There's a reason why he put us in the spot that we're in right now. There's a reason. It may not be the best thing in the world, but there's a reason for it. &gt;&gt; The steps are Do we believe that or don't we? The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. Many of you got testimonies like that. You didn't end up doing what you started doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. And he delightth in his way. We worry about it. And I remember one time, I've told you this before, but I was worried so worried about my job because I had gotten into a bad office and and my boss was a a cruel man really. and he trouble and I was so stressed out. I thought, Lord, you hear I've been praying about getting another job. I got to work and I can't got to provide for my family and I was stressed out and praying about it and one day I went to delete my spam email and I just something stopped. I never I never read it and something stopped me and I went and looked again. And I began to look through it and for the last 3 months since I had been praying, there had been a job offer in my email. Went to my spam folder and it was already waiting on me. And I went and took that job and was there for years and and been they they still wanted me to come even after that amount of time had elapsed. But sometimes we just limit God. We don't realize he's working for our good. And if he's kind of if we find ourselves stuck somewhere, it's probably because he needed us stuck, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But see, a a good stone cutter's got to have a vision, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, there's a mystery that lays within the rock, right? So, every rock has a mystery. &gt;&gt; Like Michelangelo did with the marble. There was a mystery. &gt;&gt; And the mystery was in the mind, excuse me, of the of the creator o of the of the sculptor, but he had to he had to take it and put it into action. He had to cut it and even injure it to really get it to speak to say what he wanted it to say. &gt;&gt; See, that's what we've got to do. Brother Brandham could have had the largest church in the world &gt;&gt; if he was interested in building churches. But he wasn't interested in just building a church. He wanted to see people built into the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization." I've never done that. Will not do that now. I have no interest in those things. But I do have an interest in the things of God and people. I believe it do us good to get back to the basics. Let's have an interest in the things of God and people. And if I can accomplish just one thing, I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between God and men wherein men become new creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to the word. How many want to do that today? I want to be a new creation. I I don't want to just be a stone, a rock. &gt;&gt; I want to be what God has built. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of the building. Brother Brandon makes this statement. He said, "If I seen every person come to this tabernacle, walk out and go to Don Ruddle or JT Parnell or these brother that's our brothers here and fellow citizens of the kingdom." He said, "I'd be so happy. I wouldn't know what to do." I'd say, "Lord, fill this one back up again. Let's pour it out and fill up another one." I know some of you sitting there saying, "Who's leaving?" Nobody's leaving. But he said, "I'd love to see those boys. They're my children. He wasn't building a cult, &gt;&gt; some cult. If you can just leave whenever you want to leave, you know, he wasn't building a cult or a kingdom. &gt;&gt; What was he? I believe he was a master builder like Paul &gt;&gt; finishing the work that Paul began. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And somehow we got it into our heads that everybody needs our particular ministry. &gt;&gt; They don't. Huh? They just don't. &gt;&gt; But we're pre-ordained. And I believe God leads us in that manner to be taught by certain people at certain moments in our lives. &gt;&gt; And maybe even later, it wouldn't work. I've had pastors that helped me, but later on maybe I couldn't even sit under their ministry, but it was God bringing me through a time in my life and things that that would help me. And so, different men use different tools to do the job. I want to get to this before we close. Look at this next slide. I believe those are stone cutting tools. Look at the difference in size. Those are ancient stone cutting tools similar to what would have been used in the temple. There's a there's a sledgehammer of sorts there. There's a knife. I I don't know what they use the horn there for. Not sure. They that there's a uh what must be like a level. It looks like there are little bitty picks, little bitty chisels, &gt;&gt; all used for the purpose of cutting stones, but different gifts. See, sometimes God calls a sledgehammer gift to an area because that's what God needs at that time, &gt;&gt; right? And he just goes in and and raise that thing way back and slams it and the pieces fly everywhere. Other times they need a very small chisel or even sandpaper, maybe just a cloth. So you can imagine, if you can imagine, why did the builders fuss, right? Why did the builders fuss? Well, because one of them is using that big old hammer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And another one's using that little bitty pick and he's sitting over there saying, "Boy, if he was more like me, he'd get more done." &gt;&gt; Right. Oh my. But see, the way it works in ministry is you don't get to make yourself into what whatever you want to be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God made you what you are, &gt;&gt; right? And mold you into what he wants you to be. So you may never be a small little pick or little chisel, but yet you're a part of the economy of God. You may belong in the finishing work, or you may belong right there. I've seen ministries that were so good at getting people to the message or getting young people saved. But if you put them in a church as a pastor, they'd never be able to do it. &gt;&gt; But it's it's no it's no shame on them. It's what God called them to do. &gt;&gt; See what in explaining that from the art ofmaking.com. They explained what that was back then. Exactly what tool a carver will use for a particular process will depend on the stone being worked. the final effect sought and the carver's own training. &gt;&gt; So even two carvers with the same tool wouldn't cut the stone in the same way. &gt;&gt; Right? Because they had different training. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon puts it like this and it's pretty. He said, "Let a man go where God leads him to go." &gt;&gt; Right? Because God knows how to mold us. He's talking about ministers there and and how they try to put a pet in a church and try to orchestrate those things. He said, "Let a man go where God leads him to go." God knows how to mold us using the gifts or tools he's placed on the earth. Ephesians 4:11. I'm not going to read that, brother Robert, but you find that he talks about the five-fold ministry. But the Brand said in the church, there's the pastor. The pastor is a special person. He's built where he can put up with the fusses of the people. He's a burden bearer. He's the ox of the team, &gt;&gt; right? But not everybody can be an ox. &gt;&gt; And why would you want to be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said he's a man that can sit down when somebody's got something against somebody else, sit down with them two families, take either side, reason it out, bring it right back into sweetness. See, he's a pastor. He knows how to take care of things. He said the evangelist is a special man. He's a man that's burning like a fireball. He runs into a city and preaches his message and gets out there somewhere else. He He's a special man. We need evangelists in our day, &gt;&gt; right? We need men that are burning like a fireball. Pastors, by definition, can't do that very often, right? If you did that all the time, it wouldn't work. But an evangelist can do it. The teacher is a special man. He sits back under the anointing of the spirit, is able to take the words, put them together by the Holy Spirit that the pastor or evangelist, either one, could not compare with him, he said. Then we find out the apostle is a special man. He's a setter in order. He's a man that sent from God to set things in order. I've worked with men like that overseas. I could never do what brother Robert Wilson does. I could never do what some of these other brothers do that go overseas and start churches. I couldn't do that. I can be a help, but I can't do what they do. Not a missionary. The prophet is a special man. Prophet is a man whom the word of the Lord comes to. Because a prophet is so designed in his life that his subconscious and his first conscious is so close together that he doesn't go to sleep to dream his dream. He sees it when he's wide awake. He said, "Now that's something God has to do, right? You can't make yourself a prophet. Neither can you make yourself a pastor or an evangelist. &gt;&gt; He said, see, he sees what's going and and you find in the Bible, you know, illustrations of that. You'll find Paul Paul was a certain way and he was a writer of scripture, but he had a certain mentality when it come to work and the gospel. And remember, Barnabas was there to bring Paul into the into the church. If it hadn't been for Barnabas, nobody would have ever accepted Paul. God put Barnabas in Paul's life. &gt;&gt; But when they got to a certain point, they got to arguing and fussing. And the reason was because Mark Mark was Barnabas's nephew. &gt;&gt; And he got homesick for mama decided to leave the mission field. And Paul just wasn't built like that, &gt;&gt; right? Paul's just straight ahead 100 miles an hour. He's just not built like that. And so he they feuded over it and they went their separate ways. &gt;&gt; Years later, Paul writes, and I'm glad he did because otherwise you'd wonder what ever happened. &gt;&gt; Paul writes, he said, he said, "Bring Mark with you." He said, "He's profitable to me &gt;&gt; for the ministry." He realized that Mark did have a place. &gt;&gt; But God used Paul to write the scripture and he used Mark to write the scripture. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have the Gospel of Mark unless Paul probably had sent Mark home &gt;&gt; and and parted ways with him. But we got the Gospel of Mark out of that. I say thank God that there could be different men with different ideas and and working in different areas, but we can all come together as long as we can realize that God's in charge of it all. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "What a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of God placing in the church himself. Every member." So it's not just preachers. Every member, every stone, every place, every Christian to itself, each one of us in our peculiar way. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Has a place in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said when they brought them all the rocks in there, he said all these odd rocks had their place when the temple went together. And I think that God down through this time has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood, but they have their place exactly in the temple in the building of God. Right? &gt;&gt; I want you to watch something as we're turning a corner now. The closer you get to the completion of the temple, &gt;&gt; the odder the rocks get. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Right? because you're I'm not a stone layer or work with stone or brick or anything like that, but but if you're building a building, but you put in them odd pieces last, it's like a puzzle, right? You put together a puzzle, that odd, misunderstood piece, you you can't see where it goes. Maybe it's got several different colors on it and you just can't see it. &gt;&gt; And and then the last the last one comes in. &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it fits that hole &gt;&gt; what was needed. But you'd have never put it there. Right? So the Bible tells us that the stone which the builders refused. In other words, it was so odd that they could not see a place &gt;&gt; where it would fit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's become the headstone of the corner." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's doing. It's marvelous in our eyes. And this stone would not make sense because remember if they're building maybe this stone cutter, he's only got a part of the blueprint, &gt;&gt; right, that's revealed to him and he's working off of that part, right? And and maybe in with a partial blueprint, he can't see what's going to happen. That's why you you you you realize that the builders didn't see that the stone that they rejected was actually the most important stone. Look, Isaiah 28:16, "Therefore, thus sayith the Lord God, behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. He that believeth shall not make haste." Isaiah 8:14 says, "He shall be for a sanctuary." In other words, he is the temple of God. But for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a jin or trap, and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared and be taken. Why? Because they didn't have the stone in its proper place. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. If if you don't put the stone in its proper place, you'll stumble over it. &gt;&gt; If if Christ doesn't have first place in your life, the message is going to bother you, &gt;&gt; you're going it going to feel like a a burden, &gt;&gt; right? to hear it preached, to go to church. &gt;&gt; It's going to get hard. &gt;&gt; You're going to stumble over it because it don't belong on the ground. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; His place is the chief cornerstone. &gt;&gt; He doesn't belong on the ground. Us tripping over it. &gt;&gt; And many times what we do in our life is we we get to thinking, well, you know, I I just wish I could be normal and be like everybody else. But don't you realize that stone, that stone was not meant to be stumbled over. The stone that brought holiness to your life and and brought godliness. And though it wasn't meant to be stumbled over, it was oh God, it was meant to be put in its proper place. &gt;&gt; And the reason people stumble over it is because they haven't lifted him up. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I want to lift him up in my life. If you're stumbling over the things in the message, if you're stumbling over what's preached in the house of God, maybe it's because you haven't put him in his proper place. &gt;&gt; Lord, you be the leader of my life. You be the headstone of the corner. You be the chief capstone of it all. &gt;&gt; See, Jesus testified he was that stone. Jesus said, "Did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected? The same has become the head of the corner. This is the Lord's doing. It's marvelous in our eyes. Peter testified the same thing when the lame man was healed. Acts 4:11, "This is the stone." He said, "The what's doing this is not some man." He said, "I didn't do it. John didn't do it. But this is the stone." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which was said not of you builders, which has become the head of the corner, a peculiar stone for a particular place. As brother Nathan told the young people during the banquet, he said, "There's a hole in your heart that only God can fill." &gt;&gt; A peculiar stone for a particular place. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon said a stone was cut this way and cut this way and cut this way, but they found that every stone slipped right to its place. And that's what I think about believers in God. Every one of us has a place in this building. We may not be just like the other one, but we got a place to place here. every born again Christians. He said, "Here's what's the matter with you builders, you minister sitting out there. Here's what's the matter. When they built the temple of Solomon, they started putting the temple up and they found a freak stone. &gt;&gt; They said, "We can't use that thing." Kicked it over in a weed pile. &gt;&gt; They went on building the building. They come to go, they got to end at the end of the road. They couldn't go any further. They had a hole in the wall that they couldn't make the rest of the building fit with. &gt;&gt; Oh, is that the way you feel in your life? Then you need that stone. Good. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come to find out the very stone they rejected was the chief cornerstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't need that. That's old time. That that's I don't need that that worship. I don't need that. I don't need that praise. I don't need that that atmosphere. I don't need the Holy Ghost no more. I don't need the message of the I don't need to listen to them tapes. But the stone that you've rejected is actually the head of the corner. &gt;&gt; They said it's too odd to be used. There's no such a place. But come to find out, they had built the building so high until they missed the stone. And they didn't know where the stone was. They might have searched all the ships. They might have run through every ox cart. They might have said, "Messengers up into Jopets. They has another load come in. Did you lose one on the road? There's something wrong. We just can't find that stone for this place. And when they could not find it nowhere else, come to find out it was right on the ground. It was the chief cornerstone the builders rejected." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said, "I think that's been a great big failure today among the builders." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said the denominational foundations were laid in sincerity, but as the building began to materialize, they realized that the hole that was left, the odd stone fitted to the dot. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said that's where the spiritual builders today. That's why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom. It's because the builders has rejected the chief cornerstone that was laid on the day of Pentecost, which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It's been odd. People act funny and they don't come in the order of our psychology or educational or learning or creeds. It don't fit in there and they kicked it out because it was too odd, too peculiar, too disagreeable with the plans that we as men had. &gt;&gt; Ideas of what the church ought to be. &gt;&gt; Oh God. So they rejected the Holy Ghost because it didn't fit the idea. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Can we look at our own lives and see? I'm I'm trying to not just preach, but but minister what's on my heart this morning? Have we rejected the stone, the Holy Ghost that we needed? &gt;&gt; Just left it there on the ground. &gt;&gt; It don't fit into our lives. They kicked it out because it's too odd, too peculiar, too disagreeable with the plans that they had, ideas of what the church ought to be, what our life ought to be. He said, "No, we already have the stones. The stones God for ordained. See, we've got them all the way from Ephesus to Leoa." He said, "We're only waiting for the headstone that the builders rejected. Waiting for his coming, the capping stone." &gt;&gt; Oh my. He is the stone that makes up the building. &gt;&gt; Brother talked about the pyramid. I stood there at the pyramid two two three years ago. Brother Joel and I stood there. Great big giant all them great stones that fit together with no mortar in between them. They just fit exactly together. Even after thousands of years, &gt;&gt; but it's missing the capstone. &gt;&gt; The top's missing off of it. Brother Brand said that capstone is Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember he told Zerubbabel, we read it last week that Zerubbabel laid the foundation. His hand shall also finish it. Thou shalt know the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you. Listen, even the ministry of this age is a capstone ministry. Now listen, don't get it confused. Brother Brandham's not the capstone, but he preached the capstone message. &gt;&gt; He preached Christ. &gt;&gt; This ministry will end soon. He said the expected son will appear himself. The church has come from justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and now winding up to the headstone ministry, typing all the time right into that perfect negative shadow, becoming positive. Then Jesus will come to catch his church someday. those who believe. Do you believe it's about time for the headstone to sit fully down on the body? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When Jesus returns, he'll find a church that's washed without spot or wrinkle. It'll be the same ministry he had. It'll bring back the headstone. Brother Brandham told the Pentecostal people, he said, and it's down a paragraph. He said, "Oh, don't be the rough part on it. Pentecostal brothers, shine up at the word. Believe every bit of it. Don't get out of these isms and things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, God's building a house. &gt;&gt; Musicians, go ahead and come. Be done in just a second. God's building a house. He He's building his house. He's making something out of us, something he can put his image on. Brother Brandon tells the story when he talks about the stones, then he switches. He begins to talk about rags. And he tells the story of Queen Elizabeth, she went to visit a paper factory. And many of you know that in the old days, paper was made out of rags. In fact, they still do that today. You can do it at home. You can actually make paper out of rags as a science experiment. So, they took the oldest, dirtiest, filthiest rags. I like I got to looking at the process of it. You know, the filthiest rags have to be cleaned by bleach. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. Brother said the bleach is what took the sin back to the beginning. Send it back on the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] But he he said Queen Elizabeth was touring this rag or this paper factory and they opened up the door of this room and it was full of rags. And she said, "Oh my." She said, "How could anything how could anything be made out of dirty, filthy rags like these?" They said, "Well, it has to go through the process." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the rags get taken. Hallelujah. Out of the room that they're in &gt;&gt; and taken and put in the process, run through the bleach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Till all the colors of sin are bleached out of them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And it comes out on the other side clean. And he said, "Watch this." And they let the rags dry at a certain time and and spread them so thin. Let them dry. Make them into pulp first and let them dry. And then spread them thin. And when they do, all of a sudden, they're paper. He said, "Watch this." He had a great seal with Queen Elizabeth's face on it. And he took the seal and he put it down in the paper and said, "Look, it bears your image." What was a filthy rag now bore the image of the queen. Brother Brandham says, "We were filthy rags. We come out of denomination. We come out of a of an old life. We come out, come on, some of you come out of drugs and alcohol and everything else." But thank God for the cleansing process that we come through justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And we got we got put in the bleach. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you this morning, if you not been fully cleansed, let the bleach of the word of God clean you this morning. Make you something different. They were put in the bleach and then when they come out, the image of the queen was stamped on them. Oh, I believe the image of the king has been stamped on you, &gt;&gt; been stamped on me. Oh, I thank God for it today. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said, "Do you see it? It's Christ now taking the rags of yesterday. Hallelujah. Putting it through a process, a process of the Holy Spirit. He said what they had plus justification plus sanctification plus the baptism of the Holy Ghost plus the gifts of the spirit plus the word of the hour making it till he is pressing his own image. When the church in Christ becomes one in union, you said what can do that? See, a rag cannot pick up itself. A stone can't choose itself. What a stone is, it's it is because of the maker. Are you with me? It has nothing to do with it. Oh my. What it is, if you see a stone carved, the stone itself never carved itself. It can't do that. What can it do? Submit to the carving. Oh God, listen. When Zerubabel got done, when when when they he was trying to encourage Zechariah was trying to encourage Zerubbabel because he's building the temple after it had been destroyed. Solomon's temple had been destroyed. This is the second temple. And and Zachariah cried out, "Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. He wasn't the headstone, but he brought forth the headstone crying grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe that's where I'm living today. That's where you're living. A headstone crying with shoutings, crying grace, grace unto it. A peculiar stone rejected by the builders for a particular place in our lives. Hallelujah. Would you bow your heads with me now? [Music] And now my life or your life will not fit the headstone without this message. But by the message of the hour, it's not just words, but it's a process. With the message of the hour, I can be honed down until I fit the headstone exactly. until my life is his life. But I had nothing to do with that message coming. It was all grace. Would you accept that grace today? Could you be one crying out like Zachariah? Grace. Grace. Do it. I've been washed by grace. I've been chopped and cut by grace. Made me what I am by grace. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe with every head bowed, every eye closed, you'd like to raise your hand and say, "Lord, Lord, make me what you want me to be." That's my desire this morning. Make me what you want me to be. Oh, oh, that we could cry grace to my life. Grace, I don't want to just be what what what I wanted to be, but Lord, I'd fit somewhere. Help me, Lord. Make me what you want me to be. I say as a pastor, Lord, make me. I'm a pastor. I'm a stone cutter, but I'm also a stone. Lord, make me what I ought to be. Oh, granny. Lord, heavenly father, with hands up all over the building, I pray God that you'd take each one of these, Lord. I pray you'd make them into what you want them to be. Lord, not our will, but thine be done. Lord, change our lives. Change everything about us, oh God. Make us more like you, oh God. I pray you'd grant it, Lord.
