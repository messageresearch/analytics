And we're going to have him come right out and preach what's on his heart. We won't get in a hurry tonight. We'll just enjoy the presence of the Lord. And thank you all for being here. I know for some of you it was a little extra long journey to get here. So, thank you for being here on a Wednesday night. We got a bunch of folks uh that aren't here tonight, but I pray they'll be watching. And I just trust that'll be a blessing. The service will be a blessing to them as well. And good to have brother Timothy and Sister Ruth with us. We spent the day with them today. And what a blessing old friends are. Uh not friends that are old, but we friends we've had for a long time. So, so good to have them with us and just believe the Lord will use Brother Timothy tonight. How many have a need tonight? You need something from the Lord. I believe he'll meet that need. Not brother Timothy, but God can meet that need. And speak through our brother as he comes. Pass me not. Oh gentle savior. Let's sing that as he comes. Gentle Savior. [singing] Oh [music] my humble cry. [music] Oh, [singing] and while all others out are called are called calling. [singing] Aren't you glad he's still calling? Oh, do not pass [singing] revile. [music] Let's lift our hands and sing the chorus now. Savior, Savior. Oh, precious Savior. [singing] [music] Oh my savior. [singing] [music] Won't you hear my humble [music] [singing] cry? And while all others [singing] [music] thou are called, thou are calling [singing] to not pass. [music] [singing] Amen. How many would have a need this evening? Just want to make it known to the Lord and ask him to come by and touch your heart. Father, we just come to you tonight, Lord, with our hearts open to hear, Lord, just a needy people, Father. And just ask, Lord, you'd come in your own special way and touch our hearts and lives by your word and speak to us, Lord, as only you can and minister to our needs, Lord, the situations in our lives. Father, we want to just say how much we love you and appreciate you. We thank you for this opportunity to be here with our brothers and sisters of like precious faith. May you bless each one we pray that's gathered here tonight. Those that couldn't come Lord touch each one we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Turn your Bibles to First Thessalonians [music] 5 and verse 16. It's good to be here with you tonight and Amen. I want to thank brother Ben for the opportunity to come and and speak to you and [clears throat] just ask the Lord to come by our way and touch our hearts and lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if he comes, that's all that matters. Amen. So just ask that he would do that. First Thessalonians 5 and verse 16 says, "Rejoice always." I'm going to read from the amplified if that's okay. Rejoice always and delight in your faith. Be unceasing and persistent in prayer. In every situation, no matter what the circumstances, be thankful and continually give thanks to God, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. Amen. We'll let you be seated. [clears throat] Like to speak to you tonight on thankful faith. Kind of been on faith for a while at home and it's a subject I really enjoy. I I actually was just asking the Lord the other day, you know, you know, you always looking for something, you know, been on something a while, maybe I can find something different and just put it on my heart, you know, he said, I did say when I return, will I find faith? You know, he didn't say, will I find holiness or will I find big groups of people? He said, will I find faith? And and I believe that's something he's looking for is somebody that has faith because without faith, you can't even please God. But, you know, I had got this thought as we come through our Thanksgiving time as a as a holiday or a time that I really enjoy and and I I love it because it's just a time to pause for a moment and to thank God for all the things that he's done for us and and it's kind of how it was set up as a Thanksgiving holiday to to pause and thanks God thank God for all the things he had done for this country. But you know anymore it's almost a looked over day and and too many people are no longer even taking the day to pause and to remember what all they have to be thankful for. You know being thankful is a expression of gratitude. But you know many people have become unthankful and ungrateful for all the bountiful blessings that God has even given this country. Amen. the freedom of religion, the freedom to worship God and things. They just not even thankful for it anymore or even stop to really think about where all the blessings really come from. Why why is this country even blessed the way it's been blessed? And you know, it's like brother Brandham talked about he said it's like a hog under apple tree. He'll eat apples all day long and they'll fall off the tree and beat him on the head and he'll never even look up to see which way they're coming. He said that's the way we are sometimes. We absolutely will. God will pour his blessings upon us and we'll never look up to say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm so glad to be here. Thank you that you gave me something to eat. Thank me. Thank you for all that you've done." But we just go ahead like he just owes it to us. He said he owes us nothing. We owe everything to him. Amen. I I believe that's the truth. Amen. But we we're living in a time that people are very unthankful. And this is where Paul would even describe the age or the time the last days. He said, "For men will be lovers of their own pleasure, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedience to parents, and unthankful." That's a word that he would use just right in the middle of all that, unthankful. And you know, and there's reasons that people become unthankful. And one, you know, is maybe taking things for granted. You know, when something becomes common, people stop noticing its true value. You know, church becomes a common thing. You know, it's a common thing to come together and have a nice place of worship. And it becomes so common that we we fail to be thankful for how valuable it is to have a place of worship, to have a place where we can come together with our licks of fire and create an atmosphere that God can be pleased in. And you know, comfort and stability can make blessings feel normal rather than special. And it becomes a normal thing instead of something that's special, you know. And you know, I think about it, Brother Ben, as I was a young boy, 17 years old, would go for the first time overseas and and and I would I would show up there, you know, at a meeting of 500 people. It'd be one car in the parking lot and I came in it and they'd be, you know, and people would would would ride bicycles or walk and you'd hear pregnant women that would walk 70 miles to be in those meetings and not sit in a nice pew like you have or nice comfortable building. Whether you need heat or AC, you got it. But they they wasn't even concerned about those things. They were worried. They was wanting to be around the word of God. And I I'm afraid sometimes we're going to have a lot to answer for because we got so much that God has blessed us with and we're not careful. It becomes a common thing to where we're not not appreciative of what God has really done for us. Amen. You know, and another thing is sometimes people compare themselves to others. And when you compare yourself to other people who seem, you know, more successful, more wealthy or more happy and this creates a sense of lack and it overshadows what you already have, you know, and then there's, you know, many others there's entitlement mentality that, you know, believes one deserves certain benefits or treatments. Well, we're living in that age, right? where people think they deserve it because of who they are, what they are, expecting others to meet their needs and automatically reduces appreciation. You know, it's like my my dad told me years ago, he said, he said, "If you'll earn that car that you get, you appreciate it a lot more if I than if I give it to you." You know, you won't squeal the tires so much. You'll make sure the scratches don't get on there. Why? Because you work for it. You you put something into it. And and you know that's that's why people be we come to the place that they they they just they they look out and you know this world that we live in with social media and things you can see others being blessed and having this and that and but all the time not even realizing what God has even done for you in your life you know and it's also stress and things that add to this and negative past experiences and and even somebody that you know has where they have to have everything just perfect and they focus on what's not good enough rather than what is good and and they have high expectations which makes gratitude difficult. So there's all kind of reasons for being unthankful. But I I really don't want to spend a whole lot on that. I want to speak about somebody that's thankful and that you know a thankful faith is a mindset where gratitude and trust works together. It's the kind of faith that recognizes blessings even in a difficult moment. Amen. And it trusts that good can come even when the outcomes aren't clear. It responds with gratitude rather than fear or worry. Amen. It takes the scripture that all things work together for the good. Amen. No matter what the situation, no matter what the problems are. Amen. It it this thankful faith that sees the gift of the moment. It sees that there's a purpose in every moment. It sees a hope beyond what a natural eye can even see. Amen. This is why he would say in Philippians 4 and verse4 he says rejoice in the Lord always or delight or take pleasure in him again I will say rejoice let your gentle spirit your graciousness your unselfishness your mercy and your tolerance and your patience be known to all people the Lord is near anxious or worried about anything but in everything in every circumstance and situation by prayer and petition with thanksgiving with thanksgiving continually make your request known unto God. So thanksgiving is not just after the request. Thanksgiving is part of the request. Come on now. You get that? Amen. It's not just after you get something, then you're thankful. No, you're thankful when you're asking for it. You're thankful because you know you have a God who can meet your need, who can touch your heart, who can come down and answer the request of your life. And everything may be going wrong for you today. Everything may have been going wrong this weekend or this week, but you can still you still know that there's a God who hears your prayer. There's a God who knows what you're going through. THERE'S A GOD who can answer you. And he says when you do this and then the peace of God, that peace that reassures the heart, which transcends all understanding, THAT PEACE WILL STAND GUARD over your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus. Amen. He also says in Colossians 2 and verse 6, he says, "After you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in rooted and built up in him, established in the faith as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving." Now, you'll find out I I didn't I didn't even realize this until I started studying on it, that thanksgiving and faith are tied together. Thanksgiving and faith are tied together. O in other words, overflowing with thanksgiving. So faith and thanksgiving are inseparable. True faith produces gratitude. &gt;&gt; It produces gratitude and gratitude strengthens faith. So they work together. It's not a gratitude or thanksgiving after a blessing or after an answered prayer. It's thankful while I'm praying. It's thankful while I'm waiting. &gt;&gt; It's thankful while I'm waiting on God to answer my prayer. It's being thankful before there's a sign of a blessing. So, not only rooted, built it up, built up and established, but also abounding or overflowing with thanksgiving. So, a thanksgiving is a trait of a mature believer. &gt;&gt; It's a trait of a sign of a mature believer. The more rooted and built up, the more established. And the more established you are, the more the thankful you are. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, the more ability you will have to turn your eyes from your disappointments and from your problems and turn your s eyes to your thanksgiving and praise regardless of the circumstances. Now, it's easy to praise God when you're on a mountain. It's easy to praise him when all the bills are paid and everybody's doing good, the children are not sick, and everything's going good in the home. But what about when you're having trials? What about when you're having temptations? What about when things ain't going all peachy and everything's in the dump, so to speak? What about then? That's when you need to lift your hands and still praise God. That down in the valley is where real growth takes place. DOWN IN THE VALLEY IS WHEN THINGS BEGIN to happen. Amen. That'll change your life forever. Colossians says it in verse chapter 3 and verse 15. It said, "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which you're called in one body, and be ye thankful." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Period. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It didn't, you know, it didn't do that little fast talk they do, you know, when they a commercial goes on and tells you all good thing, then it reads a fine print real fast and you can't hear it. That ain't how God want. He says, "Be you thankful." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not when everything's fine, everything's good, everything's great. It's as you know, well, the bills are paid. I can be thankful. Everybody loves me. Nobody said nothing about I can be. No. This is not a suggestion. &gt;&gt; This is a command. In everything give thanks. We don't give thanks for the evil, but we do give thanks in the midst of evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith looks and says, "All things work together for my good." All things. A thankful faith says, "No circumstance is exempt from my God's ability to use this circumstance for my good. &gt;&gt; No circumstance IS EXEMPT." AMEN. GOD CAN USE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR MY GOOD. AMEN. Even when blessings seem absent, even when all seems to be against us, faith remains thankful. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on now. We'll read about it in Habacook 3 in verse 17. It read this here. He says, "Although the fig tree shall not bl blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, the labor of olives shall fail. The field shall yield no meat. The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. Yet I will rejoice in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I love this scripture. Hey, I sometimes it's hard to bear, but I love this scripture because there ain't always things ain't always the fig tree ain't always blooming. &gt;&gt; There ain't always fruit on the vines. There ain't always a lot of oil to go around. They ain't a whole lot of flock sometime to pay THE BILLS. YET, I WILL REJOICE in the Lord. I will joy in the God of my salvation. For the Lord God is my strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fields ain't MY STRENGTH. THE FLOCKS IS NOT MY STRENGTH. AND THE OIL IS NOT MY STRENGTH. MY GOD IS MY STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; SO whether I have money or not, he's my strength. WHETHER I HAVE JOY OR NOT, HE'S MY STRENGTH. WHETHER I HAVE PEACE or not, HE IS MY STRENGTH. WHETHER I'M GOING THROUGH TRIALS, HE IS MY STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; He will make my feet like Hines's feet. He will make me to walk upon my high places. Amen. Psalm 69 and:e30 says, I will praise the name of God of of God with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving. So thanksgiving magnifies God's greatness. &gt;&gt; Amen. When in when in which in turn minimizes your problems. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to thank God, it makes your God bigger than your problems. Amen. And it begins to put him up and it puts your problems down. Your problems get smaller and your God gets bigger. &gt;&gt; Cuz if we start praising our problems and we start praising our sickness and we start worshiping that, it gets bigger than our God. Amen. But if we'll turn around and start worshiping our God and not our problem or not our circumstances. This is what David did when he come to Ziglag and it was burned and they said he had no strength. They they wept till they had no more strength to give. David had a choice. Would he go on in his depression? Would he go on into his in his tears? Would he go on in the situation? Or would he turn to his God? And the scripture said David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. HE TURNED AWAY FROM HIS SITUATION and turned to his God. This is why you got to do it. This is why you got to praise GOD IN SPITE OF WHAT'S going on AROUND YOU. THAT'S WHY it's important to come on a Wednesday night when the devil's been against you and all hell has tried to stop you. You still got a hand lifted UP THANKING GOD AND PRAISING HIM THAT HE'S STILL A GOD OF THE STORM. HE'S STILL A GOD OF EVERY SITUATION. HE'S STILL A GOD OF EVERY NEED. HE'S HE CAN PROVIDE WHEN THERE'S NOTHING TO SEEM LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FROM. HE CAN CREATE WHEN THERE'S NOTHING THERE to be created. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; He's a God of all situations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 100 verse1 says, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness." &gt;&gt; I like that, brother. You know, brother uh brother Juel, we was talking about brother Juel the other a while ago missing being out on the field, but he used to have this saying. He'd say, you know, you and your wy wowy boos. You remember that? &gt;&gt; Guess I'll go eat me some worms. Nobody loves me. &gt;&gt; We're to serve the Lord with gladness. with a smile on our face. Come before his presence with singing and know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is he that has made us and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with what? Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. Into his courts with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name. For the Lord is good. His mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth all generation. So thanksgiving opens the door into his presence. Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It opens the door into his presence. It's lift. It literally lifts you out of your problems and into his presence. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Think about that. David did not say, "Enter in with perfection or enter in with rituals or enter in with grace." It says, "Enter in with thanksgiving." Thanksgiving is the key that opens the gate. THANKSGIVING IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT GOD IS THE GIVER OF EVERY good thing. It shifts your FOCUS FROM I LACK. I DON'T HAVE TO. MY GOD IS FAITHFUL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; A thankful heart declares confidence in your God before you even see a result. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It'll praise him before you see the first symptom leave. It'll thank him before you ever see the mountain move. Thanksgiving is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's a choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Thanksgiving Thanksgiving actually comes from the Hebrew word tuda. How I guess is how you say it. Tuda. That's the Louisiana way of saying it. If that ain't the way you say it, it means a confession. It's a praise. It's a thanksgiving. It's give praise to God. It's thanksgiving in songs of worship and hymns of praise. It's thanksgiving choir or possess pro possession or or line or company. It's a thank offering. It's a sacrifice of thanksgiving. It's a it's a word is it's word. It's actually a word that is drawn as a hand. The symbol is a hand. So, it's an action. It's a lifting of the hands. Amen. Thanksgiving. The word describes an offering of thanks or a sacrifice of thanksgiving. The word depicts worship by the presentation of songs and thanksgiving and praise that extol the mighty wonders of the Lord. It refers to a shout of jubilation and thanksgiving. It's a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Being thankful even when the feeling ain't there. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's hard to do sometimes because we want to feel it then we'll do it. No, it's even being thankful when the feelings ain't there. It means you enter in even when you don't feel like it. It means you enter in even when you feel burdened down. You enter in WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. YOU enter in THANKFUL IN SPITE OF ALL THE DEVIL HAS DONE TO BEAT YOU down and to keep you bound. I'm still going to praise him. I'M STILL GOING TO THANK HIM CUZ HE'S DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. &gt;&gt; That's what a priest does. That's what we're called to be. Kings and priests, right? Brother Brandham says to make a sacrifice. It's a spiritual sacrifice. That's what these sons and daughters do, which are kings and priests, yet not in full possession, but they're making sacrifices, offering to God spiritual sacrifices. The fruit of our lips, giving praise to him, the fruit of our lips, &gt;&gt; the fruit of our lips. You say, "Well, brother Brandham, I don't feel like praising." He said, "That is the time to make the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That is the time. That is the time to make the sacrifice. Praise him anyhow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise him anyhow. Amen. When a little He said when a little confusion comes in the church, you don't run over to one side and pout out and do you? He said if you are, you sure ain't a priest. You pray through spiritual sacrifices and fruit of our lips giving praise to his name. See what I mean? Well, I just don't feel like going to church. You're a priest. It's your duty. You've got to be there. Well, I just don't feel like taking part of a service. You're a priest. YOU'RE MAKING A SPIRITUAL SACRIFICE UNTO YOUR GOD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SHOWING THAT YOUR GOD MEANS more than your feelings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, that would that would help a lot of people in church if they'd make their God more than their feelings. &gt;&gt; Somehow their feelings get hurt a whole lot. But you know why? Cuz their feelings are too big. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, I'm just staying here tonight. I'll be gone in the morning. It's all right. &gt;&gt; So, was for every He said, notice it's for everyone that was a priest in the Old Testament. Everyone in the New Testament has become a Christian, born again, become a priest to God. We're kings and priests, right? A priest is to make a sacrifice. And we give to God the sacrifice of our lips. So, you know what that tells me? That tells me if you can't make a sacrifice, you're not a priest. Which means if you're not a priest, you're not born again. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. He said to become a Christian born again you become a priest a priest of God. He said you said well I I I I don't know brother. He said we give God the sacrifices our live giving praise to his name. Says well I don't feel like it. DO IT ANYHOW. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SACRIFICE. I FEEL TOO TIRED. HE SAID THE DEVIL will tell you that till he takes you to hell. &gt;&gt; Some people wouldn't like brother Brandham their pastor either would it? THE DEVIL WILL TELL YOU THAT till he takes you to hell. YOU'RE TO MAKE A SPIRITUAL SACRIFICE, the fruits of our lips, giving praise to him, thanksgiving unto him. LISTEN, WE HAVE SO MANY reasons to be thankful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE POOREST PERSON IN THIS CHURCH, you still got a whole lot of reasons to be thankful. &gt;&gt; I don't care if YOU'RE THE MOST UNLIKED PERSON IN THIS CHURCH. YOU STILL GOT A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS TO BE THANKFUL FOR. COME ON. &gt;&gt; OH, let me give you some of them. Well, number one, you got salvation through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You were rescued from sin. &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE AN ETERNAL DESTINATION. &gt;&gt; You have forgiveness of sin. YOUR RECORD IS CLEAR FULLY AND COMPLETELY. YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU HAVE GOD'S [screaming] UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, NOT EARNED, BUT FREELY GIVEN. HALLELUJAH. You have eternal life. AMEN. YOU HAVE ADOPTION INTO GOD'S FAMILY. YOU'RE A CHILD OF GOD. YOU HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT DWELLING on the inside. He's your helper. He's your comforter. HE'S YOUR GUIDE. WE HAVE THE WORD OF GOD. WE HAVE TRUTH. WE HAVE DIRECTION. We have correction. WE HAVE HOPE &gt;&gt; IN A WORLD THAT HAS NO HOPE. WE HAVE HOPE &gt;&gt; IN A WORLD [screaming] THAT'S GOING DOWN INTO DEATH, INTO DESTRUCTION. WE HAVE A BLESSED HOPE THAT GOES BEYOND THIS WHOLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. We have redemption. We've been bought back. We've been restored. We have God's mercies that are new every morning. &gt;&gt; We have God's grace. It's an unmarited favor that sustains you. A peace that passes all understanding. We have the joy of the Lord, which is your strength. We have strength for trials. We have hope in Christ. WE HAVE PURPOSE. WE HAVE CALLING. We have spiritual gifts. We have Christ's intercession for us. WE HAVE THE ARMOR OF GOD. WE have the fruit OF THE SPIRIT. WE HAVE GOD'S FAITHFULNESS. HE never fails. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We have clothing. We have shelter. We have protection. We have healing. We have health. We have work. We have income. We We have rest. We have God's guidance. We We have his presence wherever we go. He said, "It never leave us or forsake us. We have angel's protection. We have God's sovereignty. Every detail of your life is under his control." &gt;&gt; We have the body of Christ. You ought to just turn to your neighbor and say, "I'm sure thankful for you." Amen. We have the body of Christ. We have fellow believers for encouragement. We have spiritual leaders. Amen. You got a good pastor here. You You ought to be thankful. They They're not They're not just out there come falling off every tree. &gt;&gt; There's churches that have looked for years for a good pastor, but people become it becomes a very common thing. Now, brother Ben didn't give me extra offering for this, but you know, my dad, he's he's a funny guy sometimes. He says, you know, he said, "People get this carnality about him. They think I pay," he said, "I think I tell the preacher what to preach and you know, here's the issues in my church. Preach on this." He said, "Well, I tell you what, if you're going to believe that," he said, "I want you to just believe I paid him an extra $500 to do it. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; But you know, we have spiritual leaders. I have a family. &gt;&gt; God, godly friendships, true freedom. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for the freedoms we have in this United States of America. But I have a greater freedom than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a freedom that'll never be taken away from me. Amen. We have victory over the enemy. We have sanctification. We have justification. We have a a new identity in Christ. We have a clean conscious. WE HAVE BREATH in our lungs. We we we have the create creator has created this beauty of the earth, the [screaming] mountains, the oceans, the stars to look at, laughter. We have laughter and joy and relationships. We have good music and worship and praise. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, I'm one guy that ain't ashamed of good worship. &gt;&gt; I ain't ashamed of good musicians. I I AIN'T ASHAMED OF GODLY MEN AND women that'll give of their talents and give of their time. AMEN. WE HAVE REST. WE HAVE SLEEP. WE HAVE GOD'S PROVISION IN THE SMALLEST OF THINGS. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW MANY TIMES GOD HAS SPARED OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean, just that wreck a while ago, two guys, I guess walked away from it. Should have died, no doubt, &gt;&gt; but somewhere something was happening and moving. How many times does that happen for us and we didn't even know it? &gt;&gt; You know, I know I know how it works. Sometimes we get aggravated because we had to wait a little longer here and wait a little longer there and get down the road and there's this bad accident and if we'd have been in our hurt on our time, we probably been in the middle of it, &gt;&gt; right? God's watching over us. We got a lot to be thankful for. Have opportunities to serve. We Yeah. Listen. Yeah. That's a good thing. It's it's brother as the Bible says it's greater to greater thing a greater blessing to give than receive. You know what that means? It's a it's better to be in a position to be able to give somebody than to be have be in the place where you have to be one to have to receive. That's what it's saying. &gt;&gt; So it also works with servitude. It's greater to be able to serve than have to be served. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be thankful to be able to do that. Trials. Well, we James 1 says we ought to be thankful for trials. Why? because it strengthens our faith. &gt;&gt; It's as a resistance, you know, resist the devil in a free that resistance. What is it? It's like working out. It's pushing against the weight. It's building muscles. &gt;&gt; This is what happens when the devil is resisting the devil. And every time you resist, you get stronger and he gets weaker. YOU GET STRONGER AND HE GETS WEAKER. IT'S THE PROMISE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US and all things work together for our good. It's a blessing. We have this blessed hope. JESUS IS COMING AGAIN. HE IS GOING TO RETURN. THE DEAD IN CHRIST IS GOING TO RISE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A sand castle or pipe dream or or a FAIRY TALE. THAT'S THUS SAYETH THE LORD. LORD, &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Psalms 107 and verse 20 says, "He sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destructions. So that man would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing. &gt;&gt; With rejoicing. Psalms 116 and verse 16 said, "Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant. I am thy servant, the son of thy hands made. Thou has loosed my bonds and I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord. Jonah when he was in the belly of well he said I cried by reason of my infl affliction unto the Lord and he heard me and out of the belly of hell cried and thou heardest my voice. And he went he said he went down to the bottoms of the mountains and the earth with their bars about me and yet hast thou brought upon my life from corruption. Oh Lord my God. And when my soul fainted within me, I remember the Lord and my prayer came into thee under thy holy temple that they that they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. BUT I WILL SACRIFICE UNTO THEE WITH THE VOICE OF THANKSGIVING and I will pay THAT THAT I VOWED. SALVATION IS OF THE LORD. HE WAS GIVEN THE SACRIFICE OF THANKSGIVING WHILE A while while swimming in whale vomit or fish vomit. &gt;&gt; Anybody come to church like that tonight? &gt;&gt; Seaweed wrapped around your neck, whales vomit all over you. No. No. &gt;&gt; But in the middle of that, he said, "I'm going to offer up a voice of thanksgiving." And when he began to open up that voice of thanksgiving, the Lord spake to the fish and it put him out on dry land. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13 and verse1 15. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. Continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name coni continually. In other words, it's not seasonal. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It don't come AND GO. IT'S NOT A seasonal thing where when you're in a good season then you offer or when you're in a bad season you don't have. No, IT'S NOT SEASONAL. IT'S NOT OPTIONAL. IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR YOU don't feel like it. IT'S IN SPITE OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S IN SPITE OF ALL THE DEVIL HAS TRIED TO DO ME. IT'S IN SPITE OF ALL MY PROBLEMS. I'M GOING TO CONTINUALLY THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE. THANK GOD FOR HIS LOVE. THANK GOD THAT HAVE HIS FAVOR AND GRACE UPON my life. This is where Daniel was and when he was thankful in a trial said Daniel 6 and verse 10 said he kneelled upon his knees three times a day and prayed giving thanks before his God. He gave thanks while he was under political attack while his life was in danger when obedience was going to carry a cost. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; He gave thanks before deliverance came. Daniel trusted God enough to thank him before the miracle happened. Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus gave thanks. He took the loaves and when he had given thanks, &gt;&gt; he gave thanks before the multiplication happened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Faith thanks God ahead of time. When you give thanks for what you have, even what you have seems so little sometimes. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SERVE A GOD WHO MULTIPLIES. &gt;&gt; OH, come on. YOU SERVE A GOD WHO CAN TURN FIVE FISH AND two loaves of bread in enough to feed 5,000 plus. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then HAVE BASKETS [screaming] FULLS LEFT OVER. &gt;&gt; COME ON. THIS GOD IS not a You're talking about some impossible math. &gt;&gt; That's impossibilities made possible. When a God can take two two LITTLE FISH AND FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD, DON'T YOU KNOW HE'S STILL THE same yesterday, today, and forever. If he multiplied before, he can multiply again. I'VE SEEN HIM PROVIDE FOR MY NEED AND FOR MY SITUATION. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I was actually may have told this before here, I don't know, but was in a very a couple years ago was in a very tight spot and had a lot of medical bills. Sister Ruth was going through a lot and facing a lot of things and didn't had a lot of questions about her own health and all kind of stuff was just piling on at the same time. and learned a lot about thanksgiving during this time &gt;&gt; and I learned that I wasn't doing it the right way cuz I I actually would lead songs and I would go back from there and you know you put on a good face and you go back to the back and just just lay out laid out crying out to the Lord Lord I can't do this no more I don't know help me stay faithful because you know I I'd tried a lot of things before and tried to do things on my own and God showing me where my calling was and when I but I still try to do my own thing and try to make my own way and get myself in a lot of binds and a lot of situations. And here I am like, "Lord, just keep me faithful. I I don't I don't want to I don't want to venture out where I'm not supposed to be or do something I'm not supposed to do to try to make my own way. I know you can provide." And I'm crying out to him. It's on Sunday and we'd been gone and been away from home and just got home just in time there on Saturday or so to come get ready to go to the house of God, whatever. Didn't have didn't didn't check the mailbox. Didn't check nothing at home. Just just got his clothes and left. and and it here we go to church and we go back home and next morning she goes out to take a walk with one of the daughter-in-laws and maybe the daughter and they come back and she brings me a card and uh she said this is I said what's that she said oh no she got your name on it here she hands it to me and I opened this card and I opened it up and said thank you for being faithful or something like that for your giving and I turned it over and it was from a family said the Lord just put it on my heart said to give you this money for for your needs, &gt;&gt; brother Ben. It was not just enough. It was more than enough. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I got to realizing that while I was crying, it was already out there in the mailbox. mail hadn't been checked for days and it hadn't run that morning when she picked it up out of the mailbox and she come by and just happened to check it and the mail hadn't even run yet cuz we get it pretty late in the day and it was early morning and she comes by and she gives me that and that and I got to thinking here God is like looking at me &gt;&gt; in a silly way no doubt laying on that floor crying out to him like hey bud it's in the mailbox &gt;&gt; just going to the mailbox and I got to think about that brother Ben how many times times we cry out to God and God's got a mailbox slam full of all kind of good things. He's already provided. He's already given us and he's just telling us go to the mailbox. I'm Jehovah Gyra. I'm more than enough. I I can provide not just enough. I CAN PROVIDE MORE THAN ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; HE'S THAT [screaming] KIND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; so even sometimes what you have seems no so little, you serve a God who can multiply. You serve a God who can move things when there seems to be no way and no no no no no no no no no no way to to to to help you. No no no no way you could do it on your own. You're not on your own. We're not on our own. I AM NOT ALONE. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. &gt;&gt; He promised he'd never leave us or forsake us. You know Paul and Silas when they were in jail, one of my favorite scriptures, they they begin to they begin to sing at midnight. Said Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God. Can you imagine that? Could you imagine them? They got beat. They got locked up and they put in the innermost prison in the very center of the whole thing. And there's cursings and there's all kinds of things taking place. And Paul looks over at Silas and said, "You know what, Silas? You know what I feel? I feel like praising. Praising him. &gt;&gt; Well, I feel like praising. Praising chains rattling, blood flowing down. Listen, it wasn't it wasn't an easy thing in that time. It wasn't no plus prison in three square meals a day. Amen. It was locked up in the very innermost prison. IT WAS LOCKED UP and beaten and and they were they wasn't worry about humans and and and how to treat a certain way. You know, they they done everything they could to them men. &gt;&gt; And here they are in this situation and they lift up their hands. You know what the first words out of their mouth? If you look at it, it's actually the Passover Psalms. You ever done a study on that? That's amazing. Psalms 113.14, 115, 16, 17, 18, and 136. Seven Psalms, which is incredible to me because there's seven church ages. God doesn't leave anything out. But the first words out of their mouth was, "Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise ye servants OF THE LORD. PRAISE the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOREVER MORE. FROM THE RISING [screaming] OF THE SUN UNTO THE GOING DOWN OF THE SEA, THE LORD'S name is to be praised. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, you know, if you get up in the morning, the birds are singing. As long as they sing all day and everything goes good, when you go to bed that night, then you can still praise it. IT SAID FROM THE RISING TO THE GOING DOWN. IT DOES not describe anything in between. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. He didn't when he took the children of Israel out of Egypt, you know what God did? He didn't tell them about the Red Sea. He didn't tell them about the wilderness. He didn't tell them about none of that. He said, "I'm going to take you out, but I'm going to take YOU IN." &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD KNEW that when they got to the Red Sea, he was the answer. When they got to the said the waters of bitter waters, he was the answer. WHEN THEY GOT TO NO FOOD, he was the answer. WHEN THEY GOT TO no drink, he was the answer. NO MATTER WHEN THEY GOT TO AN ENEMY, he was the answer. And he knows that no matter what you do in your day and your time and WHAT SITUATION YOU'RE IN, HE [screaming] IS THE ANSWER. AND HE'S NOT JUST ENOUGH, he's more than enough. &gt;&gt; And if you read that, there's some incredible things in there that they actually begin to confess their deliverance. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I just read one of them just right before that. Thou has loosed my bonds. [laughter] &gt;&gt; They actually begin to sing the psalms and begin to confess what God was going to do for them. They didn't know. They didn't know what they didn't know. They didn't have a, you know, a play card that was going to tell long after you sing the fifth song, earthquake is going to take place and you're going to get out of jail. Wouldn't that be nice? Sometimes you're going to go through about three weeks of maybe three months, whatever, three months of hard times, but after that you're going to flourish and things are going to be Boy, that'd be nice, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; That ain't the way God does. &gt;&gt; He just says, "I'll be with you, even in you, to the end of the world." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I'll never leave you or forsake you. &gt;&gt; He doesn't tell us about all the grimy details in the middle. &gt;&gt; They actually begin to sing in them psalms. You can read it. You go read it. It tremble thou earth. &gt;&gt; All these sayings they begin to sing and begin to praise God in pain, in chains, in darkness without knowing what God was going to do. Come on. &gt;&gt; They praise and advers praise in adversity is the purest form of faith. Thankfulness in the dungeon invites the God of deliverance. Amen. And God responded with a sudden earthquake. He opened the doors. He broke the chain. He saved a household. &gt;&gt; Thankful faith shakes spiritual prisons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thankful faith is praising before there's an answer. IT'S TRUSTING GOD WHEN EVERYTHING IS UNCERTAIN. &gt;&gt; I'M CERTAIN HE'S GOD. &gt;&gt; It's expressing gratitude continually. It's seeing trials through the lens of God's goodness. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It'd be a lot easier if we could see our trials through God's eyes, what he's working, how, what he's what he's doing. But and also believing that every situation I go through is under God's care. Thankful faith is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's a declaration of trust. &gt;&gt; I trust you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, one of the greatest thanksgiving messages, and it's a wonderful listen, is the invisible union of the bride of Christ &gt;&gt; there in Shreport, Louisiana. Brother Brandon would say, "It doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving message." He said, "But we're thankful for it." He said, 'I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of this world's history. If I would have had us saved before the foundation of the world and God would have laid the whole program out to me and said to me, I want you to preach now, what age do you decide to do you desire to go to earth to preach? I would have chose this age &gt;&gt; for I think it's the golden age. [laughter] Yeah. Trump thinks he's something because he said that we he going to produce the golden age. No, the golden age has already been here. &gt;&gt; It's the bride age. &gt;&gt; It's the invisible union of the bride. &gt;&gt; He said, "I certainly would have loved to been down there during this time of visit on earth. But I still think that right now is a greater time because it's a time that he's coming to take those people he redeemed. Oh my, [laughter] we are nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth. What a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people. He said, "What a great time. We are enthused about it. We know the history's closing out. The world's history will soon be over. We're going to step into a new day to a great millennium. That is one as one believer. I believe in the millennium, a millennium reign with Christ. A thousand years upon the earth, a physical return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood. He the bridegroom, he's took away our shame. He's put it in the sea of his forgetfulness by the washing of the word of the and the blood of life. That's what the Bible says. And he goes on into it and he says, "Now you're standing completely." I'm just giving you a quick rundown. You're standing completely justified like you've never done it in the first place. He said, "You talk about a thanksgiving." He said, "I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and been washed in the blood believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU ARE PERFECT. &gt;&gt; That's a lot to be thankful for right there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, what a thanksgiving message. You're standing complete. You never sinned in the first place. It's in the sea of God for forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it from the beginning. and you're but you're were predestinated to be a son or daughter of God and now you're standing here washed and your old book of divorcement's put away. It's dead. It's out of existence in the mind of God. You hear anything to be thankful for in that? Amen. You are the virtuous bride of Christ. Washed in the blood of Christ, precious, virtuous, sinless son of God standing with a pure, unadulterated bride. were that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which was predestinated in the bosom of his father before the beginning the same as he was. &gt;&gt; The same as he was. OH, WHAT A THANKSGIVING. WHAT A thanksgiving moment. He says, not only that, you're going to do the wedding in the sky. You're wearing the wedding band of the predestinated unmmerited grace. A wedding band of grace unmmerited OF YOUR OWN. GOD DID IT HIMSELF. HE KNEW YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. So he slipped that wedding band on you and put your NAME ON THE BOOK. WHAT A THANKSGIVING. &gt;&gt; What a thanksgiving. Oh, praise the Lord. How many can say, "Father, help me to have some thankful faith &gt;&gt; to be thankful for that we're his people. We're not under bondage. We're free. Who the son has made free is free indeed. We serve him and we're giving him praise. He said, "You talk about a Thanksgiving day for freedom. Every day is a thanksgiving day. Every hour is a thanksgiving day. I who once was blind can now see. I was a sinner now saved. Oh God, how free we are. How we can give you thanksgiving from our heart that Jesus Christ is son of God. He's not dead, but he's alive among us tonight. He's proven himself by signs and wonders and miracles. He's pouring out the Holy Ghost upon his churches just like in the la as in the last days just before his appearing. The signs and wonders appearing everywhere. And the God of heaven, hallelujah, giving praise and glory to God. How we thank you for these things. It's a real thanksgiving in our heart. Receive the praises of your people. Lord, we love you. We know that you are the rewarder of those who diligently seek you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thanksgiving faith. Thankful for all that God has done. Let's stand together. Hallelujah. So many things, so many wonderful things. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe as they just place something for a moment, you just want to slip a hand up and just start thanking him for a moment. Just say, "Lord, I thank you, Father. I thank you for your love and your mercy and your grace. Thank you for all that you've done for me in my life. Lord, you've been so good to me. Lord, even when we wasn't good, you were still good to us. Even when we wasn't worthy, you were still there for us. You [music] saw us in our faults. You saw us in our failures. You looked all over the billions of people on this earth and you said, "I choose you, oh Jesus. We thank you for that call in our lives. We thank you that we can have an ear to hear what the spirit saith. We thank you Lord that we have the ability Lord to tune out this old world and all this confusion and all the things around us. Turn our eyes on you and look into your dear face. Lord to see all the good things you got for us. The blessings of God and how wonderful you are to us. Father Jesus, we just want to say how much we love you and appreciate you. Thank you for everything you've done, Lord, for me.

Lord, I thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that there's a desire in hearts, Father, to want more of you in this world, Lord, that's going out into oblivion, into chaos and destruction. Lord, I want to thank you, Lord, that I'm not one of those that's bound for destruction and atomic fodder. Lord, I'm one of those that's bound for a promised land, Lord, to leave this old world and be lifted up into another place. I thank you, Lord. Thank you for this church.
