[29:24] so good to be in the house of the lord
[29:27] and to feel his presence here with us
[29:30] i want you to turn with me to
[29:33] uh the book of deuteronomy chapter 32
[29:35] and verse 11 very familiar scripture to
[29:38] message people i'm so glad to be
[29:40] messaged people this afternoon
[29:42] message 32 and 11.
[29:46] deuteronomy 32 and 11 i should say
[29:49] it is the message
[29:51] amen i enjoy reading from brother
[29:54] branham's quote book as some would say
[29:56] that's where he read from was the was
[29:58] the scriptures
[30:01] amen
[30:02] deuteronomy 32
[30:04] verse 11 as an eagle stirreth up her
[30:06] nest fluttereth over her young
[30:10] spreadeth abroad her wings
[30:13] taketh them
[30:14] beareth them
[30:16] on her wings i pray the lord would add
[30:18] his blessing to the word you may be
[30:19] seated this evening
[30:25] the nest
[30:27] must be a comfortable place
[30:30] for the chicks
[30:32] as they're born there
[30:34] they're familiar with it
[30:37] it's soft
[30:39] it feels good
[30:41] everything's just prepared for them
[30:44] mama comes down and provides shade when
[30:47] they need it and
[30:49] and gives them food when they need it
[30:52] they don't have to go hunt
[30:53] they don't have to kill anything they
[30:55] just sit there and the food comes down
[30:58] and
[30:59] everything is provided there for them
[31:01] their safety in the nest every once in a
[31:04] while the mama eagles spread her wings
[31:07] and they get to take a ride down into
[31:09] the green pastures and run around for a
[31:11] little bit have a little pentecostal
[31:12] revival and
[31:14] then she gathers them back up whenever
[31:16] there's any danger she takes care of
[31:18] them
[31:19] it's good to be in the nest isn't it
[31:21] it's so good because she just takes care
[31:23] of them and
[31:24] and they i'm sure they appreciate that
[31:26] so much
[31:28] and then as they begin to get bigger
[31:30] you know it's something about a little
[31:32] chick that's just hatched out of an egg
[31:34] it belongs in the nest you look at it
[31:36] and it fits in its surroundings
[31:40] but it's a different thing to see an
[31:41] almost full-grown eagle
[31:44] sitting in a nest
[31:45] it's not where it belongs
[31:47] it needs to be building its own nest and
[31:50] and going out from
[31:52] from mama's home and going out to a
[31:54] place and and begin to be a
[31:56] what it was meant to be
[31:59] and so one morning the little the chick
[32:01] wakes up and begins to
[32:04] begins to think well there's something
[32:05] different about the nest it it's become
[32:08] uncomfortable
[32:09] it's become
[32:11] embarrassing it's become a strange place
[32:14] it i i feel things i didn't feel before
[32:18] in the nest and the reason
[32:20] for that
[32:21] is mama's decided it's time to move
[32:27] and so she stirs
[32:29] the nest
[32:31] by making it uncomfortable enough now i
[32:33] want you to to hear me today because
[32:36] that's what god does in our lives many
[32:38] times it stirs the nest
[32:41] by making it uncomfortable enough that
[32:44] maybe we
[32:45] we're just not happy exactly where we
[32:47] are because he wants us we've reached a
[32:50] maturity level that he wants us to go
[32:53] beyond what we've ever been and to do
[32:55] things that we've never done and so he's
[32:58] moving us on now that is a move of god
[33:02] it's a move of mama eagle
[33:05] to stir the nest
[33:07] but it's not necessarily a great revival
[33:09] although he may use it for that as well
[33:11] but it's actually god will allow things
[33:14] to happen in our lives so that it'll
[33:16] make us uncomfortable enough he said
[33:18] brother ben why did i have to go through
[33:20] what i went through maybe god wanted you
[33:23] to be uncomfortable with where you were
[33:27] are you hearing me tonight maybe god
[33:29] wanted us wants us to be uncomfortable
[33:32] with where we are i tell you what i
[33:34] don't want to gain any comfort from
[33:35] laodicea i don't want to get to a place
[33:38] where i'm so comfortable that i can look
[33:40] around and i just fit in and there's a
[33:42] time when you fit in the nest but now is
[33:44] not the time we're beginning to grow up
[33:46] to a point where we just don't fit in
[33:48] anymore with our surroundings
[33:51] it's time to move and so there's a stir
[33:53] a moving stir means to wake up
[33:56] that's a good thing on a sunday
[33:58] afternoon isn't it
[33:59] wake up start moving
[34:02] it's to agitate
[34:04] a stir that's like that thing they put
[34:06] in a in a washing machine it's called an
[34:08] agitator
[34:09] they tell me the washing machine don't
[34:11] work as good if they don't have one in
[34:13] it at least that's what my wife says
[34:16] it's an agitator that's what god does he
[34:19] agitates us
[34:21] he wakes us up
[34:23] and so it's a move of god but not always
[34:26] in the way that we think it ought to be
[34:28] we find in the wilderness in the old
[34:29] testament that the people were stirred
[34:32] to build the tabernacle in the
[34:34] wilderness and this is the meaning that
[34:36] paul gives in into timothy when he says
[34:38] stir up the gift within you by the
[34:40] laying on of my hands
[34:41] stir it up there's a gift that you have
[34:43] there's something that you have that
[34:45] benefits the body of christ and god
[34:47] wants you to stir it up he doesn't want
[34:49] it to lay there dormant a halfway
[34:52] christian a halfway preacher a halfway
[34:54] singer a halfway church member he wants
[34:56] you to benefit the body of christ you
[34:58] don't want you to always be on the
[35:00] receiving end of everything but he wants
[35:03] you to be on the giving end
[35:05] don't you want to be on that end is so
[35:06] much more blessed to give than to
[35:08] receive
[35:09] so he wants to stir the nest so that you
[35:11] can be uncomfortable enough with your
[35:13] surroundings that you actually begin to
[35:16] use the gift that he gave you
[35:18] sometimes god stirs you up and so we
[35:21] find when the tabernacle when it was
[35:22] time for the tabernacle to be built in
[35:24] the wilderness that god began to stir up
[35:27] the spirit of the people and so it says
[35:29] they came
[35:30] oh i'm so glad we come to the house of
[35:32] the lord today
[35:33] they came everyone whose heart stirred
[35:36] him up
[35:37] that's the people that are here on
[35:38] wednesday sunday afternoon or wednesday
[35:41] night or even a sunday morning in this
[35:42] day and hour it's the people whose
[35:44] hearts stirred them up
[35:46] everyone whom his spirit made willing
[35:48] and they brought the lord's offering now
[35:50] notice what they were stirred up for
[35:52] they were stirred up to bring an
[35:53] offering
[35:57] that god has all different ways of
[35:59] stirring us up
[36:00] sometimes to bring an offering stir up
[36:02] our spirit to bring an offering and so
[36:04] they brought an offering to the work of
[36:06] the tabernacle of the congregation for
[36:07] all his service and for the holy
[36:09] garments verse 26 it says all the women
[36:12] whose heart stirred them up in wisdom
[36:15] spun goat's hair
[36:17] now you would have thought that if god
[36:18] stirred the hearts of the women that he
[36:20] would have stirred them to be like
[36:21] miriam and run around and dance with it
[36:23] with a timbrel
[36:25] that's not what he did
[36:28] i think about half of us are asleep this
[36:30] afternoon
[36:31] he didn't stir him up to all dance like
[36:33] miriam there's a time for that but he
[36:36] stirred him up to spin goat's hair
[36:39] because that's the job that needed to be
[36:41] done
[36:43] all that god today would stir up some
[36:45] men and women some boys and girls stir
[36:47] up the spirits of people so that they
[36:49] could do the job that needed to be done
[36:52] see if you'll allow the holy spirit
[36:54] he'll stir you up to be to mature in
[36:56] your work to mature in who you are to
[36:58] become a mature christian to be a better
[37:00] pastor better songwriter better whatever
[37:02] it is that you are if you're just a lay
[37:04] member in the church he'll stir you up
[37:06] to do your part
[37:08] in the house of god so the women were
[37:10] stir up stirred up in wisdom to spun
[37:13] goat's hair
[37:15] exodus thirty six two it says moses
[37:17] called bezalil in ohio lab every
[37:20] wise-hearted man in whose heart the lord
[37:23] had put wisdom
[37:24] even everyone now notice there's two
[37:26] parts to it so god put the wisdom in
[37:28] them what was this wisdom for this
[37:31] wisdom was to do certain things for the
[37:33] tabernacle some of them it was to make
[37:35] the gold pieces some of them it was to
[37:37] make the uh the brass some of them was
[37:39] to to to weave the goat's hair together
[37:42] there was different things that they had
[37:44] to do and he and he stirred them up to
[37:46] be able to do this this is what makes a
[37:48] church work is when god stirs up the
[37:51] spirit of the piano player stirs up the
[37:54] spear of the organ player stirs up the
[37:55] spirit of the drummer stirs up although
[37:57] you don't want him stirred up too much
[37:58] but stir up the spirit
[38:01] of the people in the congregation he
[38:03] stirs them up to work
[38:06] stirs them up to work
[38:08] oh my
[38:10] and so we find the same thing when they
[38:12] rebuilt the temple
[38:14] after they had
[38:16] solomon's temple had been destroyed you
[38:18] remember the story
[38:20] how that they heard that the temple had
[38:22] been torn down and the walls of
[38:23] jerusalem were torn down and god stirred
[38:25] up the spirit of men
[38:27] because god always uses a man but the
[38:29] bible said he doesn't use the agency of
[38:31] a mechanical device
[38:33] he uses men he uses men and god stirs up
[38:36] their spirit and i'm glad today that god
[38:39] has stirred up the spirit of some
[38:40] preachers to preach this message
[38:43] god has stirred up the spirit of some
[38:45] people to listen to this message
[38:47] to be a part of the house of god even on
[38:50] a sunday afternoon god stirs up their
[38:52] spirit to be able to do it
[38:54] and so the lord the bible says in haggai
[38:56] 114 the lord stirred up the spirit of
[38:59] zerubbabel the son of shield till
[39:01] governor of judah and the spirit of
[39:03] joshua the son of jose the high priest
[39:05] and the spirit of all the remnant of the
[39:07] people so notice what he did he
[39:10] he
[39:11] stirred up the spirit of the natural
[39:13] governor he stirred up the spirit of the
[39:16] priesthood
[39:17] and he stirred up the spirit of the
[39:18] remnant of the people so he works on
[39:20] both ends of the line he works from the
[39:22] pulpit to the pew he works on the
[39:24] deacons he works on the trustees he
[39:26] works on the pastor and he works on the
[39:28] people in the pew god stirring up the
[39:30] spirit
[39:31] that's what we need to get things done
[39:34] somebody's spirit's got to be stirred
[39:37] you realize though but see we take that
[39:39] wrong we think well if god stirred up my
[39:41] spirit i danced in the aisles if god
[39:43] stirred up me in my spirit i'd start
[39:44] preaching no maybe god would stir up
[39:46] your spirit to clean the restrooms
[39:50] maybe god would stir up your spirit to
[39:52] vacuum the floor i know sometimes he
[39:53] stirs mine
[39:56] maybe god stir up your spirit you
[39:58] realize it's the same holy ghost the
[40:00] same holy ghost that moves in me to
[40:02] preach moves in my wife to clean the
[40:03] house
[40:07] it's the same holy ghost that moves on
[40:09] on the song leader to sing or the or the
[40:12] specials or the or the musicians the
[40:14] same holy ghost that moves on them moves
[40:16] on you to raise your hand moves on you
[40:17] to lift your voice moves on you to clap
[40:19] your hands it's the same god
[40:23] it just stirs up the gift that's already
[40:25] in you gifts and callings are without
[40:26] repentance
[40:27] but he actually stirs the nest and puts
[40:29] you sometimes in uncomfortable places
[40:32] because he wants you to manifest what
[40:34] you were born to be
[40:36] amen now
[40:39] sometimes
[40:40] god will stir up the spirit of your
[40:42] enemies
[40:47] now we don't like that as well do we
[40:51] we want to we want we want to see the
[40:53] people stirred up and the people in
[40:54] revival sometimes
[40:56] in order to get us where we need to be
[40:59] god will stir up the spirit of our
[41:02] enemies
[41:04] that's what he did in the bible listen
[41:06] first kings 11 and 9 the lord was angry
[41:08] with solomon because his heart was
[41:10] turned from the lord god of israel which
[41:11] had appeared on him twice and commanded
[41:13] him concerning this thing that he should
[41:15] not go after other gods but he kept not
[41:17] that which the lord commanded wherefore
[41:19] the lord said unto solomon for as much
[41:21] as this has done of thee and thou hast
[41:23] not kept my covenant in my statutes
[41:25] which i have commanded thee i will
[41:26] surely rend the kingdom from thee i will
[41:28] give it to thy servant and verse 14 he
[41:31] said the lord stirred up an adversary
[41:35] unto solomon
[41:36] hadad the edomite he was of the king's
[41:39] seed in edom
[41:41] you remember some sometimes god will
[41:43] bring an adversary into your life just
[41:44] to stir you up to make you do what you
[41:47] were supposed to do
[41:49] you remember samuel's mom
[41:52] when she was there
[41:53] hannah i believe her name was she was
[41:55] there in the temple she was crying why
[41:57] was she weeping why was she so
[42:00] so
[42:00] wanting a child so badly well it's
[42:03] because she had an adversary in her life
[42:06] and the other wife of her husband was
[42:07] her adversary
[42:09] right it was an adversary in the home
[42:12] that caused her to be stirred up to want
[42:14] to produce a child and that child become
[42:17] a prophet of the lord
[42:18] but the reason why she was crying she
[42:20] was stirred up is because of the
[42:22] adversary and so god sometimes will stir
[42:24] up your enemies and that's why you can't
[42:26] get too upset at them
[42:29] you can't get too mad at people who do
[42:31] you wrong because sometimes god will
[42:33] stir up business people against you he
[42:36] will stir up people at work against you
[42:39] sometimes god will do it
[42:43] and you say why would they be against me
[42:45] i haven't done anything wrong
[42:48] well maybe in some cases we have
[42:50] and god does it for that reason but
[42:51] there's times when there's nothing wrong
[42:53] god just wants to make you uncomfortable
[42:55] he needs you to be uncomfortable so you
[42:57] can become something better he said god
[42:59] wouldn't do that to me god would never
[43:00] make me uncomfortable god would never
[43:02] make me uncomfortable by a sermon he
[43:04] said well i won't go if i'm
[43:05] uncomfortable listen sometimes god wants
[43:08] you to be uncomfortable
[43:09] have you never done that to your
[43:10] children there's times you want them to
[43:12] be uncomfortable
[43:14] listen if my son's not i see he's not
[43:16] working he's not doing what he's
[43:17] supposed to be doing i need to make him
[43:19] uncomfortable enough that he learns how
[43:21] to work
[43:23] right i need to make him uncomfortable
[43:25] enough i'm sure that some of you could
[43:27] say amen to that
[43:28] we got to make our children
[43:29] uncomfortable enough just we don't want
[43:31] to hurt them that's not the purpose but
[43:33] you've got to make them uncomfortable
[43:34] enough so that they don't want to live
[43:36] we don't want to stay in that condition
[43:39] you've got to make them uncomfortable
[43:41] sometimes god has to make you
[43:42] uncomfortable sometimes he's got to make
[43:44] me uncomfortable sometimes bring an
[43:46] adversary into our life just so that we
[43:49] stay where we're supposed to be and do
[43:52] and become what we're supposed to become
[43:55] again in in first kings 11 or first
[43:58] chronicles rather 5 25
[44:00] it says they transgressed against the
[44:02] god of their fathers when a whoring
[44:03] after the gods of the people of the land
[44:05] whom god destroyed before them and the
[44:07] god of israel stirred up the spirit
[44:10] of poor king of assyria
[44:13] and
[44:14] till the till gasps feel he's their king
[44:16] of assyria
[44:17] and he carried them away
[44:20] do you realize god might stir up the
[44:22] spirit of the democrat party
[44:26] or the republican party
[44:29] i'm gonna quit doing that whatever it is
[44:31] they they stir up this he'll stir up the
[44:33] spirit of the political party
[44:35] just to make you uncomfortable enough
[44:40] to want to go home
[44:41] he'll stir up the spirit of the people
[44:43] he'll strive have you ever wondered
[44:45] about why in this age suddenly
[44:48] everybody's against the message
[44:49] everybody's got a website everybody
[44:51] these things were always out there
[44:53] people were always saying stuff but all
[44:54] of a sudden it come on so intensely
[44:56] maybe god stirred up the spirit of some
[44:58] people to try to make them disprove the
[45:00] message just so it could become more
[45:02] settled in our heart
[45:07] god of israel the god of israel stirred
[45:09] up the spirit of the king of assyria
[45:12] he carried them away even the reubenites
[45:13] and the ghanaians and the half tribe of
[45:15] manasseh and brought them into hala and
[45:16] haybor inherit to the river goes into
[45:18] this day he stirred them up
[45:20] to move them
[45:23] ii chronicles 21 16
[45:26] he said moreover the lord stirred up
[45:27] against jehoram another king of israel
[45:30] the spirit of the philistines
[45:33] of the arabians
[45:34] that were near the ethiopians
[45:36] philistines that might be the democrats
[45:38] right there
[45:41] might stir up people in your church
[45:46] god would never do that and sometimes
[45:47] they might be good people and that's why
[45:48] we got to react like david did we said
[45:50] maybe the lord told him to do that
[45:53] it's not that it's right to do you
[45:54] understand but you can't come too hard
[45:56] against it because you need to recognize
[45:58] what god's doing in your life
[46:01] verse 17 it says
[46:03] they came up into judah and break into
[46:04] it and carried away all the substance
[46:06] that was found in the king's house and
[46:07] his sons and his wives so that there was
[46:09] never a son left him i love this save
[46:12] jehovah has the youngest of his sons
[46:13] there had to be a seedline
[46:15] there had to be a king
[46:18] so one was spared
[46:20] so god sometimes stirs up your enemy
[46:22] sometimes
[46:23] god stirs up
[46:24] kings or people with power in your life
[46:28] to fulfill prophecy
[46:31] ezra chapter one we're all familiar with
[46:33] this
[46:34] so that's sometimes he stirs up your
[46:36] enemies sometimes he'll stir up friends
[46:40] aren't you glad to have friends
[46:43] and sometimes your friends are not
[46:45] always
[46:46] how can i put this because you do have
[46:47] to be careful who you hang out around
[46:49] but sometimes god will stir up the
[46:51] spirit of someone outside the message
[46:54] the spirit of someone outside of maybe
[46:56] of your family outside of what we would
[46:59] call even a believer and it will stir up
[47:01] their spirit to help you
[47:04] and you don't even know why
[47:06] but it's god getting something done
[47:09] right he's stirring the spirit now ezra
[47:11] chapter one verse one now in the first
[47:13] year of cyrus king of persia that the
[47:15] word of the lord whether it's the
[47:16] purpose of god stirring up the spirit of
[47:18] osiris is to fulfill the word of the
[47:20] lord by the mouth of jeremiah
[47:23] might be fulfilled the lord stirred up
[47:24] the spirit of cyrus king of persia that
[47:27] he made a proclamation throughout all
[47:28] his kingdom and put it also in writing
[47:30] saying thus says say osiris king of
[47:32] persia the lord god of heaven has given
[47:34] me all the kingdoms of the earth he had
[47:36] charged me to build him a house at
[47:38] jerusalem which is in judah who is there
[47:41] among you all of all his people listen a
[47:44] heathen king
[47:46] making a proclamation
[47:48] god stirred up his spirit
[47:50] to make a proclamation and say where is
[47:52] god's people at he said his god be with
[47:54] him let him go up to jerusalem which is
[47:56] in judah and build the house of the lord
[47:58] god of israel he said he is the god
[48:00] which is in jerusalem
[48:04] god can stir them up
[48:07] a times memory
[48:09] needs to be stirred and i'm just kind of
[48:10] laying a background for where i want to
[48:12] go today
[48:14] and then we'll close quickly but
[48:16] sometimes memory must be stirred
[48:20] god will allow you to remember certain
[48:22] things on purpose but he's got to stir
[48:23] you up to do that
[48:26] and sometimes by repeating it to you
[48:27] over and over
[48:29] ii peter 1 13 peter says yeah i think it
[48:32] me as long as i'm in this tabernacle to
[48:34] stir you up
[48:36] by putting you in remembrance peter says
[48:38] as long as i'm alive i'm going to be
[48:39] telling the story
[48:41] as long as i'm alive i'm going to be
[48:43] repeating it i'll repeat it on sunday
[48:44] morning on sunday afternoon i'll repeat
[48:47] it i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go see we
[48:49] can
[48:50] in smaller services and afternoon times
[48:52] in times we tend to back up and that's
[48:55] the tale right there because what god
[48:57] wants us to do is take a step forward
[48:59] sometimes when there's not a hundred
[49:01] people in the building god wants you to
[49:02] step forward and be a worshiper god
[49:04] wants you to step forward and put more
[49:07] into it
[49:09] right than what you would
[49:11] most of the time
[49:12] and sometimes he's got to stir up your
[49:14] memory to do that he said
[49:16] as long as i'm in this tabernacle to
[49:18] stir you up by putting you in
[49:19] remembrance knowing that shortly i must
[49:21] put off this tabernacle even as our lord
[49:24] jesus christ has shown me so he said i'm
[49:26] not going to be here forever i've been
[49:27] shown what kind of death i'm going to
[49:29] die i'm going to die like he did so he
[49:31] said i want to stir up your pure minds
[49:34] way of remembrance that's what he says
[49:35] in second peter 3 1 the second epistle i
[49:38] write unto you and both which i stir up
[49:39] your pure minds by way of remembrance
[49:42] that you may be mindful of the words
[49:44] which were spoken before by the holy
[49:45] prophets and of the commandment of us
[49:47] the apostles of the lord and savior
[49:49] there's a difference in knowing
[49:50] something and being mindful of it
[49:54] all right
[49:56] i hate to use peter as an example but
[49:58] peter i'll tell him go take out the
[49:59] trash
[50:00] he'll get up put his shoes on go outside
[50:04] come back in a few minutes and say
[50:06] i don't know what i was doing out there
[50:09] so well you forgot to take the trash
[50:10] with you there's a difference in knowing
[50:13] something being told something and being
[50:15] mindful of it
[50:16] right when you're mindful of it you keep
[50:18] it on your mind
[50:20] if you're not mindful of it the first
[50:22] little distraction you'll go a different
[50:23] direction
[50:25] right
[50:26] and so you've got to be mindful of the
[50:28] words of the prophets you've got to be
[50:30] mindful of the commandment of the
[50:32] apostles he wants you to be awake to be
[50:34] alive as we said this morning to be in a
[50:37] place where you're awakened and stirring
[50:39] where you're stirred enough to be able
[50:41] to know what's going on
[50:43] where you're not caught up in a comatose
[50:45] kind of feeling where you're not charged
[50:47] overcharged as the scripture said with
[50:49] surfeiting which is just an
[50:50] overabundance of of sights and sounds
[50:53] and overabundance of food and
[50:55] overabundance of things until you get to
[50:57] the point where you can't operate in a
[50:59] spiritual realm anymore he wants you to
[51:01] be awake
[51:02] so he makes the nest uncomfortable
[51:07] and
[51:08] that allows the little eagles that the
[51:11] eagle mother eagle has raised to fly for
[51:13] themselves
[51:16] brother brown said this mother there
[51:17] comes a time she's got to stir up this
[51:19] nest and she throws it all out throws
[51:22] all the soft part out and puts some
[51:24] trials on you
[51:29] you realize that means you're at a place
[51:31] of maturity
[51:34] god would not allow you that to be done
[51:37] unless you're at a place of maturity
[51:39] you're ready to fly
[51:41] but the fact that you're going through
[51:42] it means you're at a place of maturity
[51:44] to take it
[51:46] now that's just the truth
[51:50] now
[51:51] it says because he will not put more on
[51:53] you than you can bear
[51:54] he said now what would a little buzzard
[51:56] do sitting in that nest he'd never get
[51:58] out of there that's all
[52:01] but an eagle
[52:02] he stirs his nest and he's ready
[52:05] he said now one day she says now i think
[52:08] it's time to take my little children on
[52:11] a flight
[52:12] and she comes screaming out of the air
[52:16] and they say yeah there comes mama
[52:20] now see you've got to be able to be
[52:21] stirred enough to recognize
[52:24] when mom is coming
[52:26] does that make sense
[52:27] he said they know it
[52:29] just like a church filled with the holy
[52:32] ghost
[52:32] when the holy ghost begins to fall
[52:35] hands will go up
[52:40] it's like hallelujah he's here
[52:44] amen
[52:45] he said oh i'm so glad
[52:47] why here sit your neighbor there he said
[52:49] you don't care who's sitting there
[52:51] mother jehovah
[52:54] oh i like the way he put that mother
[52:56] jehovah he's both father and mother to
[52:58] us
[52:58] he's el shaddai
[53:00] uh the the mother that we can go to and
[53:02] nurse from as we said this morning
[53:04] listen
[53:05] he said hallelujah he's here he said
[53:07] when your neighbor sits there you don't
[53:08] care who's sitting there mother jehovah
[53:10] is coming into the nest
[53:12] let him fall tonight let him scatter his
[53:14] big wings across this place here pack
[53:16] every person from a wheelchair every
[53:18] center to the altar he will come riding
[53:20] in on the wings of an eagle
[53:21] he said yes sir he will come in if he'll
[53:23] if you'll let him
[53:24] if you'll invite him you hear that
[53:26] scream come my sheep know my voice they
[53:29] can tell that
[53:31] brother brown said he was talking to a
[53:32] doctor he said billy i was having this
[53:34] meeting in a high school auditorium at
[53:37] jeffersonville and the people got
[53:38] shouting and praising the lord evidently
[53:40] the doctor had come to the meeting
[53:42] and he said he got shouting and praising
[53:44] the lord down there because some things
[53:45] happen and the doctor said to me i said
[53:47] what do you think about that doc
[53:49] he said billy you know what i think then
[53:51] people are just excited
[53:54] i said you're a doctor and you know you
[53:57] can't be excited unless there's
[53:58] something there to excite you
[54:02] i'm not concerned so much about that
[54:04] you know all the people are going to be
[54:06] excited the tears and the wheat
[54:08] right when the rain falls the tears and
[54:10] the wheat rejoice
[54:13] if there's no nothing we're to rejoice
[54:15] then then you got you're not you can't
[54:17] be a wheat right
[54:19] you know they say well there's false out
[54:21] there yes there's false out there
[54:22] there's false money out there don't make
[54:24] you quit using money
[54:28] right what does it do it makes you check
[54:29] more carefully
[54:31] to see if it's a real dollar bill
[54:34] or maybe a 20 maybe you wouldn't check a
[54:35] dollar bill anymore
[54:38] but
[54:38] he said these people are just excited he
[54:41] said but you know you can't be excited
[54:43] unless there's something there to excite
[54:44] you he said oh glory to god it sure does
[54:46] it's the holy ghost comes in and excites
[54:48] us
[54:49] we're ready to take a flight one of
[54:50] these days to glory he said sure it's
[54:53] excitable if that wasn't excitable i'd
[54:55] change it for something that was
[54:56] excitable
[55:00] if i got the holy ghost and it produced
[55:03] a sour
[55:04] dour that's a word we still use today
[55:09] a person who was always down in the moly
[55:11] grubs
[55:14] i'd go find something that was excitable
[55:17] i'm sorry if the message of the hour
[55:19] produced a negative attitude
[55:21] from the pulpit to the pew then i go
[55:23] find something that can produce a
[55:25] positive faith
[55:26] to get me in the rapture
[55:28] if all it produces is a is a negativity
[55:31] in our lives then what do we have
[55:35] and so we ought to be able to thank god
[55:37] if we're the only ones i know you know
[55:38] today's like today when there's people
[55:40] missing you think well just a few of us
[55:41] will just settle down but there's an
[55:43] excitability because there's something
[55:45] there that excites us and we're not
[55:47] excited as i said this morning by music
[55:49] or by something else we're excited by
[55:51] the word
[55:52] the word has an excitability to it
[55:55] because we know it's talking to us
[55:58] hey man i can get happy on a sunday
[56:00] afternoon even hearing about what jesus
[56:03] did for me
[56:04] even hearing about the blood of jesus
[56:07] even hearing about the things that god
[56:08] did even 2000 years ago he said well
[56:10] that's an old story it's not to me
[56:14] it's not 2 000 years old to me it's a
[56:16] present reality i know that the blood of
[56:18] jesus christ cleanses me from all sin
[56:22] i know that's working today i know he's
[56:24] doing that on a daily basis he didn't
[56:25] just do that once on calvary he's doing
[56:27] that today brother branham saw that
[56:29] vision of jesus as he was standing there
[56:31] he said it was like a bumper his blood
[56:33] was like a bumper and he said the sin
[56:35] would hit him and he would wince
[56:37] and he said that must be the sins of the
[56:38] world he said no that's your sins
[56:42] that's just your sense
[56:45] oh my aren't you glad he's still doing
[56:47] that today he's still an advocate today
[56:49] that ought to be enough to make us
[56:50] excited if it doesn't we should get
[56:52] something that we can be excited about
[56:57] i mean in whatever way you get excited
[56:59] maybe excited to some of you is just
[57:00] getting a hand up
[57:04] but it means something to you
[57:09] he said i can prove to you by science
[57:12] anything doesn't move is dead
[57:15] now we don't have to move in any certain
[57:17] way
[57:18] but it better move
[57:21] right he said you know if a baby's born
[57:23] and it don't cry it don't squall it
[57:25] don't do nothing he said that baby's
[57:27] dead
[57:28] that's what's the matter with the church
[57:29] today we've got too many stillborn
[57:31] babies
[57:33] they come in and assimilate with the
[57:34] church as part of the church and and
[57:36] they enjoy the worship and they enjoy
[57:38] the songs they come in and they're there
[57:39] for a while maybe they're there for
[57:40] years and they have children
[57:42] grandchildren and they're part of the
[57:43] church they they assimilate they believe
[57:44] oh brother branham was the prophet all
[57:46] these things but they were stillborn
[57:49] and and the problem is that if it's
[57:51] stillborn it doesn't have any life in it
[57:54] to produce a manifestation of the word
[57:56] and so he says he said uh that's right
[57:59] he said if a baby's born if you don't
[58:00] cry don't squall it don't do nothing
[58:02] that baby's dead that's what's the
[58:03] matter with the church today we've got
[58:04] too many stillborn babies he said you
[58:06] know what the doctor usually does pick
[58:08] him up by the heels what's he got to do
[58:10] make the baby uncomfortable
[58:13] always bothered me
[58:16] doctor
[58:17] hitting around on the baby you know they
[58:18] rough him up
[58:20] i remember when peter was born he wasn't
[58:21] breathing
[58:23] like he should be and they roughed him
[58:24] up he wasn't making noise
[58:27] and then he started screaming
[58:29] and it's like oh we want to stop him
[58:30] stop him screaming they said no that's
[58:32] what he's supposed to be doing
[58:33] that's what we want him to do
[58:37] sometimes god's got to rough us up a
[58:38] little bit
[58:39] he's got to get us moving a little bit
[58:41] because he wants
[58:42] right he wants us to be able to live and
[58:45] so in order to do that he's got to make
[58:47] it a little bit uncomfortable for us
[58:50] you bring something to your mind you'll
[58:52] bring conviction on you and you think
[58:53] lord i'm a good christian why do i have
[58:55] to deal with this he's making you just a
[58:57] little bit uncomfortable he's allowing
[58:59] you to be a little uncomfortable so that
[59:00] maybe you could go to an altar maybe you
[59:02] could you could cry out to god at home
[59:04] in your closet maybe you could talk to
[59:05] somebody about it making you
[59:07] uncomfortable enough getting out of your
[59:08] comfort zone so that you could become
[59:10] what god wants you to be
[59:13] he wants you to live he don't want you
[59:14] to be dead
[59:16] is that right and a dead church is not
[59:17] just a church with no emotion although
[59:19] that's part of it but it's a church that
[59:21] doesn't have any manifestation of the
[59:23] spirit in it
[59:25] right a manifestation of the spirit is a
[59:27] manifestation of the word because the
[59:28] spirit of the word are the same
[59:30] that's right now look and so we need
[59:34] that we need something to stir us up
[59:35] that's what the doctor does gives him a
[59:36] little posterior protoplasm stimulation
[59:40] he said that fixes him up just right
[59:42] and what the church needs today is a
[59:43] good old-time stimulation of the power
[59:46] of the holy ghost to come into the
[59:48] church so he's talking about no wonder
[59:50] caleb could stand there and say give me
[59:52] my mountain because he'd been drinking
[59:54] on the wine that was made from the
[59:56] grapes amen that they got there and been
[59:58] drinking on it for 45 years he was
[1:00:00] stimulated hallelujah what the church
[1:00:02] needs today it's a good old time of
[1:00:04] stimulation the power don't you want
[1:00:06] that in your life don't you want that in
[1:00:08] the church a good old-time stimulation
[1:00:10] of the power of the holy ghost to come
[1:00:11] into the church tear us up and shake us
[1:00:13] stir up the nest and blow out the loose
[1:00:15] feathers
[1:00:16] pentecost needs a stirring he said blow
[1:00:19] out the loose feathers we've got too
[1:00:20] much doubt among his superstitions could
[1:00:22] it be so would it be so certainly it's
[1:00:24] so
[1:00:26] do we believe that tonight certainly if
[1:00:28] so
[1:00:28] god's word said it so not because i feel
[1:00:31] like it not because
[1:00:33] we can get excited about the word even
[1:00:35] when we don't feel like it even when it
[1:00:36] feels like everything's against us even
[1:00:38] when it feels like things get weaker and
[1:00:40] weaker every day why do we get excited
[1:00:42] because we know god said so
[1:00:44] god's word said it's so eagle's food
[1:00:47] proves it's so you say everybody's doing
[1:00:49] what they shouldn't be doing but he said
[1:00:50] this end time bride will not fall
[1:00:56] thank you for giving me my freedom this
[1:00:57] afternoon
[1:01:00] i appreciate you being here but this is
[1:01:02] we ought to be able to be excited about
[1:01:04] the word
[1:01:05] amen he says god's word says it so
[1:01:08] eagles food proves it so
[1:01:10] sure it is eagle jehovah comes in and
[1:01:12] stirs up the nest
[1:01:13] and the church he said is getting too
[1:01:15] stagnated he said better come in and
[1:01:17] stir it up
[1:01:19] will you say brother branham i've
[1:01:20] already got the holy ghost
[1:01:22] he said yeah but it's got some loose
[1:01:24] feathers in there
[1:01:27] see he don't work on those that are not
[1:01:29] his sons
[1:01:31] he he reproves his sons he corrects his
[1:01:34] children he stirs up his children he
[1:01:36] blows those winds across the children's
[1:01:39] nest
[1:01:40] hallelujah because the nest listen to me
[1:01:43] it's only a temporary place
[1:01:46] it's not meant to be for eternity but he
[1:01:48] wants you to be soaring in the skies he
[1:01:50] don't want you to be in the nest all the
[1:01:51] rest of your life he don't want you to
[1:01:53] just be and sit back in comfort at ease
[1:01:55] in zion he wants you to fly
[1:01:58] hallelujah into the heavenlies
[1:02:01] look
[1:02:01] he says i've already got the holy ghost
[1:02:03] yeah but it gets some loose feathers in
[1:02:05] there amen
[1:02:07] now what is the result of that what
[1:02:09] happens when you stir the nest well the
[1:02:11] eagles learn how to fly
[1:02:13] brother brown said the old mother eagles
[1:02:15] determined that they won't get adjusted
[1:02:17] to that nest too much
[1:02:20] and you sit there and i know how we do
[1:02:22] i've done it lord i was just getting
[1:02:24] comfortable
[1:02:29] i've done that i didn't long ago i was
[1:02:31] pretty comfortable
[1:02:33] i'm an associate pastor you know the
[1:02:35] associate pastor is the most popular
[1:02:36] person in the church
[1:02:39] like the backup quarterback
[1:02:41] you rarely have to go in and and the
[1:02:43] pastor takes all the flack
[1:02:45] i was doing pretty good for myself
[1:02:48] i had a decent job i thought i'm doing
[1:02:50] pretty good
[1:02:52] god started stirring the nest
[1:02:54] god's determined that we won't get too
[1:02:56] adjusted
[1:03:00] he's determined that a newborn babe
[1:03:01] isn't going to get too adjusted to this
[1:03:03] world he said that's right he don't want
[1:03:05] us to get adjusted here he's going to
[1:03:08] take us get going to get ready to take
[1:03:10] us on a flight
[1:03:12] oh do you believe he's getting you ready
[1:03:13] today
[1:03:14] i believe god is stirring the nest
[1:03:17] today
[1:03:19] we've seen him stir the nest of this
[1:03:20] message what has he done
[1:03:22] we've been stirred we see spiritual
[1:03:24] death all around us in the land
[1:03:28] we see every denominational system
[1:03:30] falling
[1:03:31] we see
[1:03:32] we see church become just a rock concert
[1:03:35] or some kind of a some kind of a show
[1:03:37] we see a hollywood showmanship we see
[1:03:40] the failure of denominational systems
[1:03:43] we see a great falling away
[1:03:46] even among the message we see a great
[1:03:48] falling away we see people that fall
[1:03:50] away from truth they once held and they
[1:03:51] don't just fall away from a prophet but
[1:03:53] they fall away from the bible
[1:03:55] they fall away from the standards of the
[1:03:57] word why do they fall that far because
[1:04:00] it's a great falling away spiritual
[1:04:01] death
[1:04:03] and it stirs the nest
[1:04:05] we've been stirred we're stirred by
[1:04:07] false brethren
[1:04:10] let me just
[1:04:11] talk to you for a moment before we close
[1:04:14] we're stirred by false brethren in the
[1:04:15] message anointed false ones
[1:04:18] if you'd like to put it a different way
[1:04:19] but the brown said false anointed ones
[1:04:21] but they they're not the anointing is
[1:04:23] not false
[1:04:26] so they can preach under the anointing
[1:04:27] but we've been stirred by false brethren
[1:04:29] we've been stirred by men who make
[1:04:30] themselves the message
[1:04:33] you look at it shakes you up when you
[1:04:35] see the results of it it becomes cold
[1:04:38] dead formal
[1:04:40] because a man only preaches himself
[1:04:43] instead of the message
[1:04:45] we get stirred sometimes by egregiously
[1:04:47] false doctrine and you sit there and you
[1:04:49] wonder how in the world could somebody
[1:04:51] believe that and say they're a believer
[1:04:54] if you're going to believe that why
[1:04:56] claim to believe in a prophet
[1:04:58] because brother browner said the
[1:04:59] opposite of that
[1:05:01] but it stirs us
[1:05:03] when we see it stirs us to read the
[1:05:05] bible and get and hear the message
[1:05:08] we've been stirred
[1:05:10] by a pandemic
[1:05:12] church is closed
[1:05:14] we'd never dealt with that before
[1:05:16] we'd never have to we never had to deal
[1:05:18] with not being able to work
[1:05:20] not being able to have church not being
[1:05:22] able to go anywhere
[1:05:24] huh
[1:05:25] what what a stirring that that caused
[1:05:27] how it caused us in our spirits to to
[1:05:29] try to find out lord what are you doing
[1:05:32] what what time do we live in
[1:05:34] we see churches that were closed some
[1:05:36] still closed today
[1:05:38] people immobilized by fear
[1:05:41] unable to move some of them still today
[1:05:44] somebody put a picture of a church
[1:05:45] dinner that we had the other day just a
[1:05:47] few people there and somebody from
[1:05:48] outside from another place
[1:05:50] not a message believer nobody like that
[1:05:52] but somebody from another place saw the
[1:05:54] picture and commented and said how
[1:05:56] terrible it was that people could be
[1:05:57] having church dinners it's been almost
[1:05:59] two years
[1:06:03] people are still immobilized by fear
[1:06:06] and i'm not saying we shouldn't be
[1:06:08] careful but look but it stirs us
[1:06:11] we've been stirred by the loss of loved
[1:06:13] ones
[1:06:16] yet we know that there's a certain
[1:06:18] amount of them that have to go that way
[1:06:21] just lost by the bobby bivens there's
[1:06:23] been others that have gone on we see
[1:06:25] that older generation leaving us
[1:06:27] i i'm scared sometimes when i see look
[1:06:30] around the message i see an older
[1:06:31] generation of pastors many of them
[1:06:33] getting older beginning to get sickness
[1:06:35] in their bodies and things and then
[1:06:37] getting older and some of them even
[1:06:38] passing away
[1:06:40] we've been stirred by that
[1:06:41] it stirs our hearts because we see a
[1:06:44] generational change
[1:06:45] we wonder is the new generation up to
[1:06:47] the challenge
[1:06:49] but in that time we've also been stirred
[1:06:51] positively
[1:06:53] we've been stirred by revelation
[1:06:57] i can't tell you a time when the
[1:06:59] revelation of the word was more clear in
[1:07:01] my heart in my life than it is right now
[1:07:03] and i hope it's more tomorrow you
[1:07:05] understand i hope you can say the same
[1:07:07] thing it's more clear today than it's
[1:07:09] ever been but it'll be clearer tomorrow
[1:07:14] i i we've been stirred by revelation
[1:07:16] maybe we didn't understand like we
[1:07:17] should have before but now we see what
[1:07:20] where we're at
[1:07:21] and the time that we live in that we're
[1:07:23] living in that time of the rapture we
[1:07:24] see it
[1:07:26] we've been stirred when is the word been
[1:07:27] this clear it's never been this clear to
[1:07:29] us before even though it was already
[1:07:31] there
[1:07:32] we've been stirred
[1:07:34] by a move of the spirit
[1:07:36] and we've seen it among the young people
[1:07:37] and some of you young people have
[1:07:38] participated in that and you see it at
[1:07:40] the youth camps and things you see a
[1:07:42] stir among the people is it all is it
[1:07:44] all true probably not there's probably
[1:07:45] some of it is just fake but you realize
[1:07:47] that some of the people sitting on the
[1:07:49] like a bump on a log that's fake
[1:07:50] sometimes too
[1:07:55] right so it goes both ways
[1:07:57] but we've been stirred by it
[1:08:00] and i think of
[1:08:02] what brother branham taught us and what
[1:08:04] we see in the scripture about the pool
[1:08:05] of bethesda
[1:08:08] and how that the angel of a certain
[1:08:10] season would come down and he would stir
[1:08:12] the waters
[1:08:15] and brother adam talked about that a lot
[1:08:16] because it was a healing revival it was
[1:08:18] a healing
[1:08:19] a ministry that took place there that
[1:08:22] angel that came down
[1:08:24] and brother branham's praying he says
[1:08:26] god how happy we would be
[1:08:28] he said if just now he said i know
[1:08:30] you've already done the healing he said
[1:08:31] if you could just give them a little
[1:08:33] extra push tonight sometimes that's what
[1:08:35] we need just a little extra push
[1:08:39] we believe but we need a little extra
[1:08:41] push
[1:08:42] he says as it was just push them into
[1:08:44] the pool while it's troubled lord
[1:08:47] and so these things that we talked about
[1:08:49] all these things work god allows him to
[1:08:52] happen so that we could be stirred
[1:08:54] to be pushed into that troubled water
[1:08:57] pushed him into the pool while it's
[1:08:59] troubled lord
[1:09:00] he said granted and maybe that same
[1:09:02] angel that whirled down from the skies
[1:09:04] and troubled that water maybe that's the
[1:09:06] same one that comes night after night
[1:09:10] he said i do not know thou knowest but
[1:09:11] the bible said it was an angel i believe
[1:09:13] it and i pray father the while the
[1:09:14] waters will be stored stirred tonight
[1:09:17] troubled choppy
[1:09:19] people raising up here looking at that
[1:09:20] screaming out he said may everyone the
[1:09:23] angel of god just spread his great wings
[1:09:25] as it were around this building tonight
[1:09:27] and push everyone right into the pool
[1:09:30] hallelujah
[1:09:32] don't you want to be pushed into the
[1:09:33] pool today
[1:09:35] lord push me into the pool that's where
[1:09:37] the water's troubled don't let me be
[1:09:39] complacent don't let me get to a point
[1:09:41] where i can't be stirred anymore but let
[1:09:43] me be pushed into the pool
[1:09:45] he said may that angel of god spread his
[1:09:47] great wings and push everyone right into
[1:09:49] the pool and may there come a perfect
[1:09:50] healing tonight healing of soul and body
[1:09:52] through this building may there not be a
[1:09:54] people one left
[1:09:56] we've been stirred
[1:09:58] but what stirs the bride today
[1:10:00] what stirs the bride
[1:10:02] said well all these things stir us
[1:10:04] that's true but what really stirs us
[1:10:07] that's right
[1:10:08] the word stirs us
[1:10:10] look at isaac and rebecca
[1:10:14] isaac and rebecca rebecca is down there
[1:10:16] and eliezer goes to find her
[1:10:19] and she's
[1:10:20] she comes at the right moment in the
[1:10:22] evening time
[1:10:23] and eliezer is sitting there by the well
[1:10:26] and she comes and something strangely
[1:10:29] stirs her
[1:10:31] to do something
[1:10:33] now watch she brother brown said she
[1:10:35] made her decisions quick
[1:10:37] he said watch her real quick then in the
[1:10:39] meeting he said quickly if they're
[1:10:41] ordained to eternal life they'll know it
[1:10:43] how many times did brother branham he
[1:10:45] would say she missed it or he missed it
[1:10:47] because they didn't respond quickly
[1:10:48] enough
[1:10:49] that's the way it is in church too
[1:10:53] listen
[1:10:54] if you sit back on your heels
[1:10:57] forgive me for men in baseball
[1:10:59] there's an idea that if the pitcher
[1:11:02] works slowly
[1:11:03] that the defense will sit on their heels
[1:11:06] right they're taken back and so they're
[1:11:07] more likely to commit errors
[1:11:10] because the pitcher is working slowly
[1:11:11] he's just kind of moping around
[1:11:14] out there he wants to be taken out he's
[1:11:16] ready to go he's tired it's a hot day
[1:11:18] whatever the game doesn't matter he's
[1:11:20] ready to go and so the defense gets back
[1:11:21] on his heels that's the way we get in
[1:11:22] church sometimes
[1:11:24] and sometimes when the ball does get hit
[1:11:26] to us
[1:11:27] the word comes right straight down our
[1:11:29] alley right there right straight down we
[1:11:31] don't know what to do with it
[1:11:33] we dropped the ball
[1:11:35] because it's kind of like you know you
[1:11:37] get somebody that catches one balls all
[1:11:39] the time
[1:11:40] in football they'll catch it but if you
[1:11:42] get somebody that never catches the ball
[1:11:43] he's not used to it the first time he
[1:11:45] catches it the first time he gets
[1:11:46] targeted he always drops the ball
[1:11:49] why does he drop the ball because he's
[1:11:50] not prepared for it said coach they
[1:11:52] never used me before
[1:11:54] but we got to be ready because god wants
[1:11:56] to give gifts to us he wants to help us
[1:11:58] he wants to provide for us he wants to
[1:12:00] speak to our hearts
[1:12:02] and we got to be ready to hear it
[1:12:05] we sit back on our heels we'll com we'll
[1:12:08] end up not taking advantage of the
[1:12:09] blessing
[1:12:10] that it would be
[1:12:12] listen he said
[1:12:14] she meant quickly if they're ordained to
[1:12:15] eternal life they'll know it there's
[1:12:16] something in the message that stirs them
[1:12:19] he said that's what stirred
[1:12:20] rebecca oh my the message stirred her
[1:12:27] hallelujah
[1:12:28] if we're going to be excited let's be
[1:12:30] excited about the message of the hour
[1:12:32] that's my message
[1:12:34] the message stirred her
[1:12:37] the angel was leading her he said oh
[1:12:38] can't you see the picture the angel the
[1:12:40] lord leading her then she was stirred
[1:12:44] hallelujah he said and immediately when
[1:12:46] she watered the camel the gift went on
[1:12:48] her notice what she was stirred to do to
[1:12:50] water camels
[1:12:54] somehow eliezer's message stirred her
[1:12:58] to water camels
[1:13:00] now look he said he began to take out
[1:13:03] the earrings which means faith cometh by
[1:13:04] hearing he put the bracelets on the
[1:13:07] works of your hands
[1:13:08] he got her
[1:13:10] ready
[1:13:11] and as soon as she begin to water give
[1:13:13] the waters of life
[1:13:15] testify
[1:13:16] tell others get the message out
[1:13:20] tell them what has happened to you
[1:13:24] say brother amen but i want to preach in
[1:13:25] church i want to be a preacher will you
[1:13:27] be a preacher in your home
[1:13:30] even a woman can be a preacher to her
[1:13:32] children
[1:13:34] you won't stop a preacher from preaching
[1:13:36] a preacher will preach
[1:13:38] and then if a man is called to preach
[1:13:39] behind the pulpit he'll find a pulpit to
[1:13:41] preach behind if you've got to stand on
[1:13:42] a soapbox
[1:13:43] i tried to quit one time as a teenager i
[1:13:46] tried to quit preaching i said i'm not
[1:13:47] gonna preach because everything wasn't
[1:13:48] perfect in the church i was in i said
[1:13:50] i'm done i'm not gonna preach anymore
[1:13:51] and i felt like jeremiah he said it was
[1:13:53] a fire in my bones
[1:13:55] i couldn't stop
[1:13:56] and i actually backslid on god
[1:13:59] and i had to promise god i would preach
[1:14:01] i've never done that again because i'm
[1:14:03] afraid to
[1:14:05] because i couldn't feel the the presence
[1:14:06] of god like i used to i had to promise
[1:14:08] god i would preach
[1:14:10] but you got to preach wherever wherever
[1:14:11] there's an opportunity to preach you got
[1:14:14] to preach you got to water amen give out
[1:14:17] the waters of life testify tell others
[1:14:20] get the message out
[1:14:22] tell them what has happened to you
[1:14:24] he said and then there was another great
[1:14:25] decision had to be made after she was
[1:14:27] given and the parents said well i would
[1:14:29] just let her stay around about 10 days
[1:14:31] he said let her hang around the revival
[1:14:32] to really feel whether she's decided to
[1:14:34] do it or not he said i haven't got much
[1:14:36] confidence in a person making a decision
[1:14:38] to wait even until tomorrow
[1:14:40] but the message that stirred rebecca
[1:14:42] she was satisfied the message was from
[1:14:44] god when you know it's god go do it
[1:14:49] go tell it go testify of it
[1:14:52] and if you don't know don't go
[1:14:55] i'll get on the back side of the desert
[1:14:57] until you know
[1:15:01] look she said so the parent said
[1:15:03] let her stick around for a while she'll
[1:15:04] get over it it's just a little
[1:15:05] excitement
[1:15:07] she was over to that revival you know
[1:15:09] but oh then the true servant said don't
[1:15:12] worry us don't hinder me
[1:15:14] he said a lot of the servants of god has
[1:15:16] been hindered by put off decisions
[1:15:20] right people hear the word but they
[1:15:21] don't do it so the servants of god are
[1:15:24] hindered by put off decisions
[1:15:26] oh i'm preaching to somebody right now
[1:15:29] maybe it's somebody away from here you
[1:15:31] never know but i'm preaching to somebody
[1:15:33] you take it personally if it fits
[1:15:36] he said don't don't he said a lot of
[1:15:37] servants of god has been hindered by put
[1:15:39] off decisions don't hinder me seeing
[1:15:41] that the lord has sent me seeing that
[1:15:42] he's been good to me don't hinder me he
[1:15:44] said let her make her own decision
[1:15:46] that's where you stand tonight make your
[1:15:47] own decision then they called rebecca
[1:15:49] and said will you go with this man or do
[1:15:51] you want to stay around a little while
[1:15:52] to see whether you really want to do it
[1:15:55] she said i'll go
[1:15:56] she was ready her decision was quickly
[1:15:58] made she knew there was something been
[1:16:00] leading her she knew that something had
[1:16:02] happened to her and she knew that it was
[1:16:04] god and she was satisfied she wanted to
[1:16:06] go quickly she put on her garment she
[1:16:08] got all the gifts that was sent to her
[1:16:09] by the father to meet the son he said oh
[1:16:11] god if the church could only make that
[1:16:13] decision right quick put on all of her
[1:16:15] gifts and she climbed up on the camel
[1:16:17] and took out and it was in the evening
[1:16:19] time when isaac had wandered from the
[1:16:21] tent out in the into the fields to
[1:16:22] meditate when he seen the camels coming
[1:16:24] rebecca looked at him and then it was
[1:16:26] love at the first sight she had to
[1:16:28] believe it before she went faith cometh
[1:16:30] by hearing she didn't know what the man
[1:16:31] looked like it didn't make no difference
[1:16:33] it was god making the decisions he said
[1:16:36] i don't care whether he's bigger little
[1:16:37] what color he is that makes me no
[1:16:38] difference he's my lord i love him when
[1:16:40] i see him because he's god's gift to me
[1:16:42] and you
[1:16:44] what was she stirred by the message
[1:16:47] she was stirred by eliezer's message to
[1:16:49] water the very power
[1:16:51] that would carry her back home
[1:16:53] you and i have been disturbed by the
[1:16:55] message of the hour are you hearing me
[1:16:57] i'm closing tonight church but are you
[1:16:58] hearing me we've been stirred by the
[1:17:00] message of the hour that's why we have
[1:17:02] these sunday afternoon services that's
[1:17:03] why we're trying to do everything we can
[1:17:05] try to be in revival as much as we can
[1:17:07] why because we've been stirred
[1:17:10] by the message of the hour

[1:17:17] that make a difference in your life is
