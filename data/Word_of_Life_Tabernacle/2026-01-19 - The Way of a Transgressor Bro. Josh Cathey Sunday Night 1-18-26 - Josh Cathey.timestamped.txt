[3:39] me.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate the presence of the
[3:45] Lord tonight.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a testimony that was.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; You know, uh, Sunday Eden, a lot of time
[3:52] you're struggling to to stay awake, but
[3:55] you know that I didn't see anybody
[3:57] struggling at all. What a powerful
[3:59] testimony that was.
[4:03] [applause]
[4:07] [applause]
[4:08] You know, we all we all have a little
[4:10] bit different background. We all came
[4:12] from, you know, different places. We all
[4:14] have a different testimony. But the main
[4:16] thing is is being changed from what you
[4:20] were to what God can make you. And and
[4:23] that's the thing, you got a testimony.
[4:26] You've got to have a testimony. But
[4:28] there's an experience. And when when God
[4:30] comes on the scene, the presence of God
[4:33] when you first felt him, that's what
[4:35] changes a person's life. Thank you.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; That's what begins to soften a person's
[4:41] heart to where you can receive what
[4:43] God's trying to do in your life.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; And what do you have to do to that? You
[4:49] have to surrender to that.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost. It's the
[4:53] grace of God that comes upon a person's
[4:55] life, not just to make them a religious
[4:58] person, but to change their life.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I we just so appreciate the
[5:04] presence of the Lord here tonight. I
[5:05] appreciate what our brother had to say.
[5:08] You know, if tonight if you you you have
[5:10] that on your heart to surrender to him,
[5:13] now's the time.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; The presence of the Lord is here.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a predestinated moment. It
[5:20] was a predestinated moment for this
[5:21] brother to meet the people that he did.
[5:24] He hadn't heard the things that most of
[5:26] you young people have heard your entire
[5:28] lives.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; But there was a predestinated moment.
[5:33] And when that happens, that's God.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he comes on the scene,
[5:38] when he begins to move, surrender to
[5:40] that. Amen. Let's sing that song
[5:44] tonight. I surrender. I'll try to sing
[5:46] it.
[5:48] I surrender.
