Lord with you and always count it to honor to come and diminish the gospel to you and may the Lord just richly bless you and the pastor here and we would sure bring our greetings for our home Church there in BlackRock as well if you got your Bibles tonight can we turn to Hebrews chapter 12 and I could preach this evening on the believer's focus something I've been preaching back home for a little bit so I've been just burning our hearts tonight Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and 2 familiar scripture it says wherefore sin we also are compassed about with such great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin was just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us look at what he says here looking in other words look away from present conditions and focus in on the prize that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith can you say amen amen God bless you can have your seats this evening we realize this evening as we even the time of the signs that we're in and it just seemed like they're here their brother being there's no continuing City and there's nothing that is really sure in this life outside the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in this life and Satan has placed so many traps and he's watched us since we was just little fellows and brother Allen he knows how to fog up our our Focus the best that he can and it becomes a distraction I pray tonight that we don't allow the distractions uh to become our Focus this evening I believe he's standing here at Paul is just simply saying look unto him not that we're going to be exempt from troubles or trials or persecution or famine but looking unto Jesus the author the beginner and the finisher of our faith also Philippians chapter 3 verse 10. says that I in the third chapter 10th verse says that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his serpent being made comfortable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I have already obtained either we're already perfect but I follow after if thou May apprehend that for which also I have apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count on myself to apprehend it but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth until those things that are before I press it's going to be a battle I press um brother Brandon told us that you receive the Holy Ghost every gun in hell is pointing at you he said I press to the mark and forgetting those things went behind Reaching Forward to things that are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so keep our focus on the mark and not circumstances right I'm moving past my fears I'm moving past my doubts you know focus is the art of knowing really what to ignore yes amen not that we ain't going to have distractions but the focus is the art of knowing what to to to ignore and and don't give the devil you know any of our our attention and just press through every battle every trial and and knowing one thing as Paul said maybe none of these things move me because I'm going home amen this world is not my home I'm just the passing through hey Ben and no doubt you know in this age that we're living in it's hard to take a right attitude it's hard to you know keep a right attitude it's hey man any other Prophet told us you know the right mental attitude to the vain promises God will bring it to pass and and many times yeah in this journey we we go through uh questions we go through Temptations we go through trying times we go through persecution brother heart we go through family we go through sicknesses hey badmouth at the end of the day amen as a Christian we jump right back up and amen We Begin our our focus never wavered amen because we go through trials and purchase persecution this life doesn't mean we're not Christians it doesn't mean we ain't got the Holy Ghost Amen brother Robert what it does mean amen that we're going to be greater we're going to be better we're going to be an overcomer hey because greater is he that is in me than the he that's in the world that's right in other words the right mental attitude I'm not quitting yeah hey man I'm coming to church whether I feel like it or not and hey but not for those that sick tonight I'm just saying whether I feel like emotionally or not come on come on hey Ben I I can I can uh say Amen from all of us if you're really sick we'd rather stay home anyhow and don't pass that thing around but hey remember the right mental attitude whenever things going wrong you know and hey man Wednesday it seems to hit Sunday morning as it seems to hit hey but it just seems like everything is going to go wrong it's going to go wrong on those days and hey man my one of my son-in-laws I I was helping him today cut up one of his deer you know and and brother Dave and they started popping up deer you know on my on my camera he said you know those deer no less Wednesday and Sunday don't they in there you know I thought that's kind of Comedy but you know it's the truth and it's like and then man I could have I could have went out there hunting the same besides going to church but you know what as a Christian hey better it's never a question around our house even when Wednesday and Sunday comes around hey man I I think we should come that much more as we see ain't been the time of this time that we're living in hey man and we we can't type for granted how much strength we get when we come to the house of God and join our licks of fire together and amen this is a battle listen friends amen we need each other and amen and US preaching back home in the inspiration brother being dropped down and amen we was preaching on unity and how that amen the prayers of the Saints and the love we have for one another and amen when we get down that energy begins to lift our hands back up amen and that's what we need tonight is we we fight this Warfare ain't been every day at work and everywhere we go we're we're constantly fighting a spiritual warfare and no doubt as a spiritual realm as this sicknesses our brother was telling me my bodies wore out and amen that's what it does to the the sickness to the Natural Body and and how that the spiritual realm able to be tormented and beaten and torn and how that it beats us down and thank God that the silver baptism of the Holy Ghost a ain't here today and gone tomorrow hey baby that's there to stand and when we're getting ready to give up it's there to push us when we're ready to give in amen it says take another step of Faith amen that's the that's the great comforter that lives inside of our bodies they'll never leave us I'll never forsake us but be with us even in us to the end of the world do you love him tonight yes sir now brother Brown's speaking about the uh the focus here he's talking about that swim bicycle I know that's a familiar quote but listen to a few things others quote that's just stood out to me he said he said boys this is after they all fell off and he said boys I'm going to tell you where you made your mistake he said you all were trying to like this to keep the bicycle on the board looking right down like this at your bicycle it made you nervous you got a wiggle it you fell off he better and I seen where you made your mistakes and he said I never looked what was down here I just watched the end and I kept standing hallelujah amen in other words Brother David is saying amen I didn't get my eyes on the distractions what the hell the devil likes to do is fog up our focus with so many distractions and he says simply said boys well you made your mistake you got your eyes off the goal come on and you got your eyes on the the troubles and the frustrations of life and he said it made you nervous yeah and he started wiggling and he started falling sword and you you start laying out of church and you still fail you stopped fellowshipping with the brother hey man it's not that you're the Son of God Amen but your focus has got all up by this life oh I was listening to the prophet of God this morning and he would begin to scream out in the token and my wife said man she he's really getting on the people and I think praise God Amen we need to Cleansing amen we need a deep fogging of Our Lives oh man right Hallelujah he just simply says I didn't let them things bother me yeah I kept my focus on one thing and I stayed steady I didn't quit I didn't give up I stayed steady yeah he said

some good faithful soldiers in the house tonight they just keep steady hey man you don't have to beg them to come to church you don't have to call them every every Church day and encourage them to come they just steady they're always here they're always to help they're always on time amen he said just keep moving on I'd be discouraging of it wasn't for that come on I'm watching the end oh wouldn't we be discouraged at night seeing what's up all the things that's going on in this life amen look at this world it's totally insane it's falling apart amen whatever you want to watch or listen to Hey bettas is nothing but filled with discouragement and lies yeah but thank God when there's this uncertainty out here there is something that is sure that seem to this and the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away Hallelujah and he said I just kept standing I'd be discouraged if it wasn't for that I'm watching the end just keep standing move on no matter what takes place don't quit just keep on moving all things work to the good of them that love God are called according to his purpose he said just keep looking to the end that's where you'll meet God down there at the end there's where your rewards will give out don't drop it up here let's go to the end he that endure to the end the same shall be saved scripture says Watch and Pray watch your stay focused and steady he must stay on the firing line I say tonight let's starve our distractions to death come on Amen let's feed our Focus tonight yeah yeah let's feed our Focus read our Bible let us pray let's stay in tune with the master amen he goes on he said but when God give him Faith Focus you with the word of God you're directly in line and zeroed in then when Faith that's in you focus you to the word you'll Focus away from all denominations and Creeds and everything are you hearing me somebody hey Ben that when that Faith that's in you who has faith in their hearts tonight amen when that Faith that's in you it Focus you to the word and you're focused away from the denomination distractions and the Creeds the distractions and everything brother Brown just throws everything in there amen you're not looking at what somebody else says this can happen and that can't happen you're looking to what you know did happen hallelujah amen he died for me he rose for me oh I'm not fighting for victory I'm fighting from Victory right in the midst of the battle we can sing the victory song it's already over the battle is already over the victory has been won right in the midst of a battle amen get our eyes off of Creeds and dogmas and everything amen my just anything that's so easily besets us tonight whether it's family job or just life it's General oh I say the night let's starve our distractions of death in our lives don't we want a Revival tonight Church if you want to read Bible that's when we can start just watch and pray stay focused amen drowned out your doubts and fears tonight amen and say one thing for sure this one things is for sure I'm going to forget those things are behind and things are around me I'm going to press to the mark of the prize of the high calling in God sure we're going to go through tribulation amen but we're going to make it even sure we're going to have fears in that but we're going to make it ain't but nothing in this life is going to keep you from making it if you're sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you've got what it takes to get out of this world hey but no doubt that's the reason why brother random would say amen I like that I would be discouraged if it wasn't for that tonight yes what is it stay steady yeah just keep on moving don't never stop for the Devil Keep On Moving for the cause hey man you want to be victorious tonight keep standing yeah keep focused keep moving yes brother Brown says here you're looking to what you know did happen he's talking about Joshua and Caleb here he said I don't care how much opposition they had how big the giants look how big the fences look they were looking to God's promise amen every man and woman tonight that wants to go on with God don't pay any attention at what the world says whether we can or whether we can't God promised it and that settles it God said so he says I like that when God says so that settles it forever I tell you tonight we've had a lot of false pretense we had a lot of makeup believe we had a lot of stuff that went out for a show certainly devil always throws his forerunners out yet as a counterfeit to scare the people yeah there's many distractions there's 10 that came back and got their eyes on a distraction amen and the scripture says they be they begin to look at themselves as grasshoppers in the sight of their enemy but just when Caleb kept standing he kept focused and when he came back I don't know what they gonna do but I come to praise my God we are more than able to take the land yes here's the evidence God's not dead he's very much alive hallelujah amen he said but the devil always throws impersonators he sends out his forerunners false pretense we had false Pentecost we've had false rings yes they said but in the midst of every bit of it yeah there is a genuine yeah the baptism of the Holy Spirit and a genuine Pentecostal blessing there's a genuine Divine Healing there's a genuine wine stir there's a genuine people he said and it's time for March hey man it's time to put God's word to action not just from the list hey but our actions punctuate the word of God with an amen God before us who can be against us keep on the fire line it's time for the March hey Ben there's a lot of bogus dollars out here there's a boat a lot of bogus Christians there's a lot of bogus churches but there is a genuine there is an Holy Ghost Field Soldier hey baby brother Brown said he'll never leave a swallow and without a witness can I have I'm one of them tonight how many water deals do we have in the house tonight hold that Dynamo with that Dynamo amen all of us begin to move tonight and change our Focus from who's preaching or what's happening tomorrow and say our Focus right here in line with the gospel amen with a Word of Life That's flowing out over heavens and height amen not just for me amen but let this fear come hey better exaggerate your life tonight and you watch amen those problems that you came in this house with they better begin to drop off those chains will begin to break yes I'm about to say first you got to get in the spirit of it yeah going to Revelation first you got to get in the spirit of it that's good Focus your glasses on the word of God and he speak the word and then just walk forward that's all there is to it amen somebody marching forward amen speak the word so we get to the time we say God I don't know what to do I'm up against it he says speak the word Lord I believe and just start walking forward God does the opening of the sea you just got to keep walking Focus out all the unbelief and focus in the promises I can I will I do believe that all things are possible tonight amen God does the opening of the sea he just needs somebody to take him at his word and stay steady tonight it ain't our business that opened the Red Sea our business let's shut the mouth of lions come on somebody it ain't our business to drop a giant oh he's asking somebody to be a David and take that sling of Faith amen begin to sling that word around ain't gonna let go and let God do the rest I say it can Break Down The Walls of tradition in your life he can Break Down The Walls of jealousy tonight he can Break Down The Walls of bitterness [Music] hey man taking men broken hearts tonight don't let the distraction keep him where you meant to be tonight you meant to be an overcomer if this body's sick tonight it's not it's out of cater yeah God's got it God's got a real genuine Reign a real genuine Holy Ghost and a real Divine Healing yes my God's real tonight there's only one thing sure it's him tonight yes God made a path God does the open of a seed God's made a path and when the children of Israel come out on the land of Egypt they follow God's path it led them up to a Red Sea strange that God would lead his path up that way but his path went right through the sea don't stop because there's an obstacle there look he said there is no way around that there's no way I can cross it just keep on walking when the odds are against you I say walk on when it looks like there's no hope walk on so when it comes time in The Showdown Israel stood there before the Sea of God's path LED across the sea so God looked down through the pillar of Fire yeah come on and the Sea got scared and moved back and Israel went across on dry ground amen God's path LED through it walking in the predestinated path that God has provided for you Satan stands powerless your Red Sea will move if God's path LED through there just keep steady yes just stay focused stay steady keep walking keep marching comb through the message everybody said don't give up there's no retreat in her keep marching keep walking keep moving God's Gonna open up your Red Seas God's Gonna shut the mouth of lions in your life do you believe in this evening amen your Red Sea will move don't stop because there's an obstacle if God's papilla LED you to this place remember you're going to make it walls of Jericho was so thick they ran chariot races around them do you know why they conquered Jericho color being because God's path LED through there and he told them how he could overcome Jericho and they stay steady they stayed focused they did according to the the plan of almighty God oh hallelujah amen we have a blueprint tonight how are we going to overcome because greater is he that is in me and if there's a greater that only means there is a lesser and I say the Lester is darkness and Lester is the devil lesser is the hell greater is my God and the greater than your sickness greater than your problem yes right because God's path LED them through there I say walk on this evening that's what the church ought to do today look to one thing the voice which is the word of God that speaks to us churches and people can speak anyway but look to the voice our focus should be settled a voice which is his word that'll defeat Satan any time any place any condition under any circumstances he had to focus his mind to the will of God by the word of God and believe it if we can focus ourselves to the plan of God to what God wants for us and what God promised us and let everything else alone no matter how long it is just keep believing yes Romans 4 said 14 see hey brother Brown said it said a stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief yes for the job but he said he said he didn't let unbelief contaminating at all help me tonight Lord he staggered not at the promise of God through I believe he did let unbelief contaminate him at all it wasn't that Abraham wasn't surrounded by the unbelief but he didn't allow the unbelief that surrounding to contaminate him he stayed steady I've been the voice that's Pokey he looked the one thing that was the voice that spoke to him hallelujah look to the voice it might be out of focus to the world but to a Believer it's life Abraham focused out all unbelief consider not zeroed in with God well the first month passed yeah yeah everybody said well Sarah how are you feeling that's familiar huh he said not a bit of difference honey well glory to God yeah well I don't know what you gonna do Sarah I come to have some church tonight surrounded by unbelief yeah but he didn't allow it to contaminate him he took the right mental attitude well it's only going to be a greater blessing tomorrow and he just States steady

darling but glory to God after 25 years we're going to have it anyhow he didn't allow it to contaminate him at all it depends on what you're looking at yeah come on somebody it depends on what you're looking at if you're looking at the problem that's all you can see tonight amen it depends on what you're looking at no matter how ridiculous it looks to the carnal mind or anyone else he uh it looked all right to Abraham because Abraham never looked at so much of what what the promise was or how ridiculous it sounded or why how ridiculous it was he looked at who gave the promise criticizing couldn't stop him symptoms couldn't stop it I believe couldn't stop him old age couldn't stop him all the Devils Out of Hell couldn't stop him yes sir Abraham he put his focus on thus saith the Lord and he walked right in the strait with that brother listen at this quote day after day yes he walked and he kept steady yes he never year after year day after day he walked confessing we're going to have a baby Abraham your old we're gonna have a baby and Sarah's past the time of life praise God we're going to have a baby extra extra read all about it we're going to have it why because he made a promise and in a one time has he ever failed me oh can we have an amen this evening not one time has he ever felt me I've felt him many times but not one time has he ever found us free yes sir and he said there's one thing God's word can't come back void it will accomplish yeah yeah we're gonna have this baby this miracle is mine tonight yes how you feel no different day after day year after year month after month s his body kept feeling worse yeah and worse but he kept standing and it kept moving the promise was there yeah yeah he just needed Abraham to keep walking his path LED through all that persecution all those funny feelings although Jericho's all those mountaintops and valleys are you hearing me somebody it's those pamphlet through there as long as Abraham was walking in God's provided way there was nothing was going to stop Abraham if he just stayed steady oh Hallelujah this evening that makes me a little excited to know amen ain't no father I have Abraham if he couldn't stop him he's not going to be able to stop us either all he needs is somebody to stay steady and the age that we're living in because God's predestinated path LED you through lady osia led you through code times LED you through Greece and pains and heartaches yeah but look around you're here tonight ain't been lifting your hands backing with an amen praising your lord and savior Satan has tried everything he can to keep you from coming keep you from living keep you from serving but you're here tonight how many serves the Lord tonight how many loves the Lord tonight how many gives God praise the Lord Satan shot everything he can to hold you back but here you are denied and over cover yes Hallelujah yes how'd you get here staying steady yeah keep marching on keep walking don't stop for nothing tonight just keep going allow anything to contaminate your spirit and he goes always at Abraham he put his focus on thus said the Lord and he walked right straight with that you must be positive and you stay there until you're positive then when you're positive there's nothing can turn you quit focusing on how big your problem is and turn like Abraham look how big your God is it wasn't what he promises who made the promise God is big God is greater than that oh you believe it tonight that's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me away from my promises I'm here to tell you it's impossible yeah it's impossible yes yeah come on oh can I get there tonight without running out of time quit focus on how big your problem is my God Is Bigger Philippians tells us what then not withstanding every way whether it's pretense or truth or crisis preached that their due rejoice and Will Rejoice for I know that they shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and supply
