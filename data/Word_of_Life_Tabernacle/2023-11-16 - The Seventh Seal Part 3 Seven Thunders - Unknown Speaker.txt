your hands may you work within it Lord and do your good pleasure we pray and we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you Revelation chapter 10 verse one Revel velation 101 read down through verse three got our Thanksgiving potluck this Sunday I'm looking forward to that brother Matt McGary will be here with us and preaching the word in both services and uh so we'll just have a good time in the Lord and um I'm always look forward to this time of year but I wish it would stay cold or hide one or the other it really messes with my voice when we have to deal with the weather change but that's what I blame it on anyway but uh we're just in bodies of corruption isn't that right and one of these days we're going to be clothed on with immortality and looking forward to that Revelation 101 as I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices the Lord that his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated we continue talking about the seventh seal tonight and deal uh specifically with the seven Thunders that's the seven thunders of Revelation 10:3 when brother brandham preached the seventh seal he knew that the seven Thunders contained The Mystery of the seventh seal and so he he says that it was the end of all things we got that last week he said it was the uh seven Thunders he said it was the third pole and he said it was the coming of the Lord so those are the things that we know about what the seventh seal is and so we're moving through those tonight as the seven Thunders and maybe this is uh uh maybe to you might seem complicated but it's less complicated maybe than what you're thinking what people have made it because different ones over the years have said what the seven Thunders were but brother brandom actually tells us what they are and sometimes we just have to listen to what a prophet has to say and uh and just say what he said now uh he he he knew that that seven Thunders he said this one I have will speak and I spoke speaking of the seventh seal he said that it is the mystery of the seven Thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery so we've got that so far he said now what this great secret is that lays beneath the seal I do not know I don't know it I couldn't make it out I couldn't tell it just what it said but I know it was them seven Thunders uttering themselves right close together just banging seven different times and unfolded into something else that I seen that he said when I seen that I looked for the interpretation it flew across there I couldn't make it out he said the hour isn't quite yet for it this is in the seventh seal he said but it's moving into that cycle it's coming up close he said so the thing for you to do is remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord be prepared for you don't know what time something can happen and then when something happened a lot of people missed it what had happened now it was the seventh Angel's job to to to preach to finish the mystery to reveal uh the seven thunders of revelation 10:3 we know that because he says in in verse four he tells John to seal it up he said don't write the things that the seven Thunders uttered but brandom said when it says the seven thund uttered he said there was something said he said it just wasn't a noise something was said he was about to write and and in the church age book brother Brandon presenting this as if to a an audience of people that didn't know anything about a a prophet or anything like that he says it this way he says what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know we need to know right so brother brother Ben why are you preaching this tonight because we need to know he said and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet now there's a a clue right there it has to be a prophet brother Adam's talking about here is a Vindicated Prophet not a person who prophet prophesized we went through that a while back but a Vindicated scriptural prophet in the end time he said the word always came by a prophet and always will so in verse 5 the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven we got this last week verse six he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things that there in are and and the earth and the Sea and the things which are therein there should be time no longer or no more delay he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh Ang Angel when he shall begin to sound yes right you see the continuation of it you got to read it together a lot of times we read Revelation 10:7 by itself but brother brandham reads Revelation 10 1-7 he always he always does it that way Revelation 10 1-7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants of prophets I want to put this in a simple terms as as I can tonight so we can understand it not because you're simple people I believe you're a people that understand but even our little ones need to understand there were some things in the Bible that we didn't know there were some Mysteries that were not unfolded they were not revealed to us we didn't know what the correct interpretation of it was we didn't know exactly what God was going to do we didn't know exactly what the whole mystery of redemption was we didn't know the secret in the back part of his mind so there were some things that we did not know and so God would send a prophet at the end of Gentile dispensation to reveal those things that's what the seventh angel was to do you say well that's not controversial but that's what the seven Thunders are it's just God revealing what was unknown becoming known what was what John couldn't write now being spoken right so it's not some mysterious Deep thing it's just God doing what he said he would do God keeping his word and this gives me Courage by Logan that God keeps his word in this way he'll keep his word to me he'll forgive me he'll love me he he'll he'll take care of me he'll heal me why because he promised he would do it that's right when he when the seventh angel sounded he the mystery of God would be finished and we've seen God do that in our day and if we've seen him do that he'll keep every word of the Bible If he if you fulfill Revelation 10:7 he'll fulfill Hebrews uh 13 at Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever sir so the mystery of God being finished is the revelation of the seven Thunders which is a part of the breaking of the seventh seal so once again if the seventh seal is not open we don't know the voice of the Thunders the mystery of God is not finished and it's really easy to put those things in the future and say well one day uh people will know because then we're not accountable to those things but I think tonight we need to make ourselves accountable to the fact that the word the fullness of the word has comeing our day and what that does to us is it makes us uh have to face up to it and say I can live that there's no more excuses there's no more looking back at another age and saying or looking forward at something else and saying well if I had what they had or if I had what they will have but no we have it today we can live it today we can become it today we can become the word in flesh manifested word of God for our day we can be that as brother Keith spoke so eloquently Sunday night we can be the word as he read what brother brandham said he said you become the Revelation you become the manifestation of everything God said amen I love that so now a thunder is simply a voice of God that's not understood right a thunder now you find in 2 Samuel 22:14 other places in scripture as well just to give a couple here 2 Samuel 22:14 the Lord thundered From Heaven the most high uttered his voice it's a voice of God Psalm 18:13 the Lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hailstones and coals of fire in John 12:28 uh God spoke from heaven and and Jesus first spoke he said father glorify thy name and then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again and the people that stood by heard it and said that it thundered right why they didn't understand what was said but Jesus didn't say it thundered because Jesus understood what was said other said an angel spake to him BR said remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is a voice of God he said that's what the Bible says a clap of thunder they thought it was Thunder but it was God he understood it it was revealed to him it was a thunder so we find and I'm trying to move through this quickly tonight to keep your interest I know I know there's people are not interested at all in these things and and but I believe that you are I believe that's why you came out on a Wednesday night and and and I know that I know that the bride will be interested in these things some sometimes our our flesh gets dull and and weary and we get in caught up in lay with a sea we need to we need to strive for something higher and to understand something more and to be a part of something bigger than just our everyday uh everyday life and our everyday existence so there was a thunder at the opening of the first seal we know Revelation 61 I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and now brother BR said notice the first seal opened the first seal when it opened in symbol form it thundered he said now what about when it's opened in its reality form yes he said it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back to seal what did it reveal he said I love this he said not all of itself so when it thundered what happened it revealed he said the lamb broke the seal when did that happen when did the lamb take the book when did he break the seal I might shock you but that had already taken place right it had already taken place but it was only revealed in symbol form you say when did that happen with the the Bible was written many many years ago and it contained that that the lamb took the book and opened the seals but when he opened the seals he never revealed all of it what did he do he revealed he said it didn't reveal all of itself for because that was left to the seventh angel messenger he said first it's with God next it's an ass symol then it's revealed first it's with God then it's in a symbol and then it's revealed three things he said it's coming forth from the throne I'm so glad this message didn't come from Jeffersonville it didn't come from Tucson but it came from the throne Amen brother brandham is uh now he he was about to explain in the seventh seal what what it was what the Thunder what what the seventh seal was in it fullness or as far as he understood it but even what he understood the angel told him he said don't go any further you remember we read it said stop go no further he had it written written on his notes then he goes a little bit further than he wants to go and he goes back and cuts off the end of the tape right and and does it cuz he's so serious about stopping right there now and and because there were some things that had to be just had to happen it couldn't be brother bandam couldn't come out and say it and if you'll read that brother Bram says that he said if I say it the devil run the wheels off of his car to stop it so there were some things that had to happen and then he could look back and say it was done right it couldn't be him promoting and say this is what's going to happen it had to happen and then he had to look back and say that's what happened are you with me so far so we we know some things about the Thunders we know that the Seven Seals are revealed at the time of the seven Thunders so when the seven Thunders are revealed the Seven Seals are revealed and vice versa we know that he says that in the breach he said the seven seal book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelation 10 we also know that the seven Thunders will bring the bride together for rapturing Faith the seven Thunders will bring the bride together for rapturing Faith he says I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith you say well it's going to be a meeting it's going to be a certain preacher it's going to be a great emotional Revival and I'm for all of those things by the way but that's not what brings the bride together for rapturing Fai what brings the bride together for rapturing faith is this message it was the revelation of those seven Thunders those Mysteries revealed that's what we that's what we feed on that's what we gather around so the Thunders are for the bride the Thunders are for us to bring us together for rapturing Faith together with what together with the word which brings us together with one another because we're one with the word our Unity is not so much with one another as it is with the word and because we are united with the word we're United with one another now the Thunders are for us in John 12:3 when Jesus when that voice thundered Jesus said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes the Thunders are for us sir brother Brandon says this he says they are Mysteries again he says we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away this is in the first seal he said and when it does it'll give faith for that rapturing Grace for that church to move out oh I I believe we have it today you said brother Ben you believe we have rapturing faith I absolutely believe we have rapturing faith I I believe the same faith in this hour that causes you to believe the message is the same Faith to give you faith for a Rapture the same Faith that's kept you all of these years the same Faith amen that makes you go forward and move forward even though you've failed so many times yet you're here that same faith will take going to Rapture one day amen so brother BR says it'll give rapturing faith for the rapturing Grace I love that that church to move out he was talking about the Jews being blinded he said no more we could understand these things until the time comes for it to be understood right brother Keith talked about that on Sunday night there had to become a time for it to be understood he said oh my seven thunders of Revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation Faith oh my that's what we have in this hour that's what we've been a partaker of that's what we've been feeding on all of these years so we also know the seven Thunders must be scriptural the seven Thunders must be scriptural it cannot be something outside the Bible brother brandom tells us that because at first he said well it's on the back side of the book it's not even written then he comes around and begins to tell us he said when anybody thinks that he has those seven Thunders if it don't compare with with the rest of the word there's something wrong it's got to come thus sayith the Lord for this is the book this is the revelation of Jesus Christ in its entirety there so many false doctrines but Joel and I were talking about the other night so much false Doctrine comes from the fact people are trying to dovetail things together make things work when it don't fit with scripture and they're not making this the only scripture that we have and then the message being uh you say it's the message the word of God absolutely it's it's God's it's God's word which which is exactly what he said here it has to be the same right it's got to have be it's got to be the light shed on the word that's already been spoken it's got to be that it can't be something different because if it wrote another Bible it would be against the word itself and brother Bram says that everyone has always come to me said brother Bram them seven Thunders the voice thundered and he said write it not but close it up so that'll be seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days seven Thunders that'll tell us he said no don't that sound real good but watch what you're talking about when you say that he said see that you R it not see these seven Thunders utter their voices see he said don't write that but it's to be sealed up in the book until the last days he said now someone has many has been saying to me in theologians said brother Brandon with the Lord God said with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people he said you'd be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested I said that might be true brother Brandon was a major prophet just like Paul and Moses right but it wasn't time for the Bible to be written it was time for the Bible for the mystery to be finished right brother BR was doing a different thing than what Paul did a different thing than what Moses did he was finishing the mystery he wasn't wri in the scripture he said it might be true see he was trying to catch me I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away one word I I read a great story in history the other day but the gay there's a there's a Bible called The Wicked Bible and it was the next the printing after the 1611 version of the King James version there was another printing of of the King James version the the uh frankly the publisher made so much money he decided he was going to print it again and when he went to print it again they they missed a word and it was it was in The Ten Commandments where it says Thou shalt not commit adultery they forgot to put the word not and the and in the wicked Bible it says Thou shalt commit adultery and and see changing one word makes a difference doesn't it the man ended up in debtor's prison died in debtor's prison because they finded him so much for for missing that and he was the royal printer in England but it was an important thing right that's an important thing that's kind of a big deal but we're taught that every word of scripture is like that not just that but every word of it every he said not a jot or turt will will pass away not not one thing can be changed aren't you glad we have a a a Bible That's accurate tonight and a word we can rely on so he said not one word can can be added or taken away he said well then them seven Thunders you see with them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it be added something to it or taken something from it he said it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was Sir right that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word God's spirit will never leave that word it will stay right with the word blinding some and opening the eyes of others it'll always do that oh I want to be one who has my eyes open I want to have my eyes open so I can see where I'm walking what I'm doing amen now the Thunders were revealed under the opening of the seals they were revealed these are things we know about the Thunders cuz things about the brandom said they revealed under the opening of the seals the brandom said something happened the other day something happened the other day and he he refers to the tape he said you read or heard the tape the seven Thunders the seven Thunders brother Brandon refers to the tape is it is it this the sign of the end sir what time is it sir as his seven Thunders tape because it's the only time he ever took Revelation 10 as his text and preach from it he said see he said it happened the other day that's pretty clear isn't it he said you heard the tape it happened the other day what happened what was prophesied in his seven Thunder tape well go back and listen to that what time is it sir if you go back and listen to it brother BR saying that's so seven Thunders that's at the end is this something that's going to give the bride rapturing faith and it's exactly what it was so the thing he said would happen happened even though when he preached what time is it sir he doesn't even he he he doesn't even know for sure if that's what's going going to happen but he preaches it under inspiration and he said it happened the other day he said you know these things he said the time is at hand Church the time is at hand he said don't don't wait any longer he said how do you know the Rapture is not going on all the time there's a thought-provoking quote so just at this moment how do you know the Rapture hasn't started right going on right now in one sense it is cu the message is the shout right but how you know the Rapture is not going on all the time people started seeing their loved ones right he said first thing you know it'll be past one disappearing here and there it'll be gone the first thing you know he said and judgment will strike the world you say well I thought this he said it's too late now you realize what time we're living in no more delay no more things to happen before no more dominoes to fall if you ever did that you ever set dominoes up and and and when you you get them all in a long chain and you tip the first one and it kind of goes around the circle and goes around and around and finally the last one Falls that's where we're at the last one's already falling no more dominoes to fall we're here this is it right you say well how long's it going to be I don't know but this is it it might be it's already been 60 years I don't know how long it'll be but I know this I know when it happened it'll happen when Jesus prophesied capernium would go into the ocean it was two or three 100 years before that happened but it happened and there's come a prophet in our day said Los Angeles going to the ocean it's going to happen we don't know when brother BR told us he said you don't know and we don't know he said when it'll happen but it will happen at some point it will happen how do you how how can you say that because he's already done everything else except the coming of the Lord except the actual the literal body change if we could say it that way he's everything else is already over he said well what does that make us what makes us the most privileged people on ever to live on planet Earth to know the things that we know and see the things that we see though we Face trials and troubles I'll say this we should never get to down we should never get too caught up in what the world's doing what we even do this one Falls this one Falls that one messes up I'm not going to get too down cuz I know my redeemer lives and I know in a little while I'm going to see him face to face I know where I'm living I'm not just looking at something that might continue on and continue on continue on I'm looking at the end right so I know it won't be long now brother brand said he said we don't know he said now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming he said and so was all the mysteries of God waiting for this last day he said after it's already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done now it's just as plain as the nose on your face I think after it's already been completed he reveals and shows what he's done Oh my he said he never gave his mystery in full remember he said he give it he it come first it was in God's hands then it come in symbol form he said and then it was known right he said it's just like this comparing the Seven Seals he said when God used Martin Luther for the coming out for that first church or that church age and when he used John Wesley gradually brought them out was revealing in them that church age he said revealing in them that church age he said when it goes back through the Bible now and find out but in the last days the reason that was such a tremendous thing that he spoke of it here he showed those seven Thunders he said Life Magazine packed that Circle of cloud and a light there they could not understand and don't know it yet he said but here telling go there and wait for those Mysteries to be be revealed and here months before it happened and then it happened exactly the way he said it would do he said even in the picture of the angel on the right when he was being materialized coming down with his wings back and his head setting sideways he said there it is right there in the picture just exactly months before it happened he said told here that he's going to bring the body of Believers together to reveal to take up them lost ends remember what was the seven Thunders to do to gather the bride to give them rapturing Faith the brand said we were told that they was going to bring the body of Believers together to reveal take up them lost ends he talks about Luther and Wesley and all of that he said and then comes the revelation of the mystery to reveal what it's all been about he what is this this this is Christ the mystery that's what brother br's preaching here now Christ the mystery and brother Kei said that Sunday night and I've said it to you before Christ of mysteries brother brandom's he's preaching the second part of the seventh seal just go and listen to it he reveals part of it he waits for it to come to pass and then he shows us what happened right now look now he talks about about Lutheran Wesley and how they still Trinity baptism and such he said then come back in the last days pick up all those Mysteries and clearly explain it reveal it he said why it's all the last days when this great mystery God had in his heart is being revealed he said do you get it and remember this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said if you fail come back to this tape again he said I don't know how much longer I'll be with you you talking about a prophet why would he say that at 50 55 56 years old 54 years old I think at the time he said I don't know how much longer I'll be with you remember this is the truth thus sayith the lord it's the truth it's the scripture he said like the seven Mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals had done been broken every age had come down and there they had left a lot of scattering and God not willing that it should be scattered I'm so glad he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines they started Luther and Wesley and all the other reformers were uted on out and revealed the whole thing he said same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of Christ how he was God's three-fold purpose for the church he said oh my letting him out reveal so what is the message of the hour what is the seven Thunders what is the seventh seal it's Christ he's revealing to us Christ he's letting him out amen he said reveal Webster says is to make known make known especially Webster says in Divine truth that Revelation means he said the Revelation is Christ's way listen I got to say this so you'll understand it's Christ's way of making himself known to his church every time we reveal something to his church it's Christ's way of making himself known to his church so what was he going to do at the end time make himself completely known to his church now now how how's that helpful now how's that helpful in our day let's just put it where these little girls on the front these boys on the front can understand it how is it helpful to know the Mysteries have been finished in our day how is it helpful to know who Christ is because if I need healing if I don't know that Christ Is A Healer or if I'm not sure that he's a Healer maybe he don't heal today that's what the many denominations say but if I need healing and I know Christ Is A Healer because he's revealed himself as that in this day then I can be sure I can have my healing right if I know he's a savior no matter what happens in my life and what you know how how low that Satan might I might get into a bad place but I know he's a savior I know he's a forgiver I know these attributes of God have been revealed to me in this day and it's not that we didn't know some of those things like we we knew it by head knowledge and and in the denominations they teach those things some of them teach part of it and some of them teach the rest of it but we teach all of it we believe he is a savior we believe he is a Healer we believe he is a peacegiver we believe he is a uh we believe he is a God who heals all of our disease we believe these things and so he's he shows all of it he shows the gifts he shows uh the ministry he shows our church and how it should operate he shows everything about himself and how he wants to operate here at the end time you understand now you we had to know these things because we're going to live in the worst time that there ever was and so he needed to reveal himself to us so we would be able to know what his character is so we'd be able to make it to overcome in the hour in the worst hour that's ever been yet there' be a bride that would overcome why because the Mysteries have been revealed say well the Mysteries don't matter the Thunders don't matter seals don't matter yes they do if you're not even sure God's A Healer unless it's been revealed to you that he is are you with me so far and a lot of this was God was setting his stamp on he was bringing in a in an authoritative manner so we could know this this is one that's what the scribes said when Jesus come they said this guy isn't like the scribes they said because he they always say well it could be this way it could be that way but he speaks with a voice of authority that's what the message is in this day is a voice of authority to speak to us the truth and we know that it is true are you with me so far amen what did Brother brandom say what brother brother Keith quoted it Christ in you is the center of the Revelation a powerful statement Christ in the center of the Bible he said makes makes makes the whole Bible the manifestation of Christ and Christ in you makes makes you the manifestation of the fullness of Christ that's powerful amen then brother sent me a quote today I didn't bring it with me but he he sent me a quote brother random said if you pray in Jesus name he said it's the same as Jesus pray Christ in you amen hallelujah oh that ought to give us confidence church that ought to give us confidence strength to be able to overcome anything that comes our way right now you say but why didn't they understand it when brother Brandon preached it well the disciples didn't understand I've read this to you before but that's what the Bible says these things understood not his disciples at the first but when Jesus was glorified when he became preeminent in the church amen when they received the Holy Ghost then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him they didn't even know it when it happened they couldn't even see what was going on but later they looked at it by the Jo and said hey that's what happened that's what we've done in our hour now so brother brand says I've got 15 minutes left and we'll we'll close now he said he said he was asked the question directly have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed they revealed in the Seven Seals were yet not known to us as the Thunders yet he said no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunder thers was about it was to reveal the seven Thunders had Ed their voices no one could make out what it was he said John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church you see how how perfect it is it happened now I know brother brandom in in a couple of places people will throw this at you and if you ever find somebody that doesn't preach this that believes that the Thunders are something brother brandom is coming to preach one day there's a couple of quotes that they'll use and I want to read you those quotes and they're from 1965 and about August of 1965 brother brandom starts dealing with this in a message called the God of this evil age he said now in doing this he said I've come here for the purpose of teaching last vials the last seven vials the last seven Trumpets the last seven thunders of the Book of Revelation tying them together in this hour that we're now living to fulfill the opening of The Seven Seals the seven or to follow the opening of The Seven Seals seven Church ages he said so we couldn't get room to do it so I hope as soon as I can he Saidi hope as soon as I can we'll get a place sufficient either here or in Louisville New Albany or either put up a tent so we can just stay as long as the Lord leads us to do so many people took that and said Wella praise God brother br's going to come back put up a tent well if he does decide to come back we got some buildings we can get in I I don't know if we'll necessarily need a tent but AC brother said you don't mean to you know you don't want to some of the stuff they just don't it through and depending on what time of year and all of that as well but uh you know and and it would be it would be an interesting thing if he did we won't go into that tonight but you know he one one of the things he says he's come back to preach was the trumpets did you catch that he said the seven trumpets he already preached Feast of the trumpets he said the trumpets were to the Jews right the seven trumpets he's going to preach those why would he preach those now in another place he talks about the plagues and uh this this is in and no it not this is the next week August 15th of 1965 he said just wait till we get into opening them plagues and seals them seven Thunders watch what takes place now what he's already preached the seals he says wait till we get to opening the seals and the Thunders watch what takes place said oh brother you better get to Goan while there's time to get to Goan because they don't pay attention to this outside I say Amen to that he already preached the seals and I think what brother brandom is wanting to do is he want to take his time and and expound on these things he wants to talk about the seals and the vials and the trumpets and the Thunders God don't let him do it and in one place he actually says that he's already preached even the the vials and and and those things the plagues do you know that in Christ's revealed his own word which is the next week August 22nd 1965 he said said and last week's tapes I think will reveal to you the great hideous things that we're going to speak on one of these days when we can get a place sufficient that's pretty good isn't it I didn't know that till this week he did preach it last week's taste what is last week's tape he said the opening of the last plagues he said the vials rather pouring all the violence seven Thunders those hideous sights that come upon the Earth last week's stes he said we reveal to you the great hideous things last week's tapes now he's talking about he comes to preaches and knoweth it not and knowth it not was just after a service like a Sunday night he slips in what he's talking about is the week before God of this evil age and events made clear by prophecy go listen to those tapes and you'll begin to see the plagues and the vials and some of those things coming on the earth the part of it that we need to know anyway think about it for a minute church we we we wanted it to be all laid out for us but he doesn't deal with us that way he wasn't a theologian he was a prophet and so he wanted to lay it all out he wanted to take his time and preach the trail of the serpent but he preached the trail of the serpent to us we we get it through the through these sermons he preached the vials and the plagues and all these things through these sermons he showed us what they would be and if you go back you can find them last week's tapes he said so you say well somebody tell you well he's got to come preach those files what about last week's tapes right now he said well brother Ben if if the seven Thunders have been revealed what are they well brother brandom says they are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals I would say it this way the Thunders it's simply everything that we didn't know that we needed to know yes and now it's been revealed amen everything that we didn't know that we needed to know and now it's been revealed brother BR said it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so again if you if they've not been revealed then our hearts haven't been turned back but I'm so glad that we know they have been revealed what Revelations are containing in the seals everything we need to know everything that was unknown all the Loose Ends that needed to be tied up I want to go into something before we close I've got 9 minutes left a prophet's desire is not thus sayith the Lord how many knows that tonight brother Brandon wanted to come back and preach in a tent he wanted to come back to Jeffersonville and preach in a tent I don't think he ever contemplated coming back in flesh after dying but he wanted to come back and preach in a tent in Jeffersonville I have no problem with that I want I want I wanted brother bradam to come back if I had have been there I would have wanted him to come back back and preach again because a lot of things we didn't understand and the people didn't understand I I'll say this a again a prophet's desire is not thus sayith the Lord but the prophet has to surrender his will to the will of the Lord Jonah desired to go to tares if a prophet's desire is thus sayith the Lord I'm sure Jonah walked around telling people where he was going I'm going to tares no he wasn't I'm not I'm not the Brandon was Jonah but you understand what I'm saying he was a prophet a god- calleded major prophet who was going to go to tarish and flee from the presence of God but the Lord prepared a storm and a fish and brother BR said that's why God's prophets don't make no mistakes because it ended up being better than it would have been otherwise God don't let them right they they oh my when he says God's prophets make no mistakes he's not talking about the fact they wouldn't want to make a mistake he's saying God don't let him make a mistake like that cuz it's a major prophet I'm so glad that that many times there's been things in your life you a predestined child of God just like brother Brandon was a predestined ordained Prophet there's many times you wanted to do something and God kept you from doing that and you can look back and see I'm so glad I didn't marry that person I'm so glad I didn't go to that church I'm so glad I didn't take that route when I would have if I would have went that way I would have been caught up in a car accident don't you realize we to say not my will but thine be done Elijah wanted to die he asked God he said God just take me home it's my desire to die God said get up Elisha elah he fed him a little bit let the angel with soft hands come down comfort him and took him back in the cave and spoke to him in a still Small Voice said you got things left to do got more work for you to do you ever felt like that but even Jesus had said even Jesus said not my will sir but thine be done even the son of God's will desire was not thus sayith the Lord that's a that's a hard pill to swallow but it's true he had his own human desire he wanted to stay there with his disciples he wanted to live with them he wanted to spend time with them he wanted to he wanted to comfort them but he could not do it he had to fulfill the will of the father and God did exactly what he wanted to do with our prophet he preached exactly what he wanted him to preach then he called him home brother brandom said this he said you might have thought today I was trying to say this about myself this is in in Ed ones at end time he said being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment I'm so glad we had a prophet who was willing to say not my will but thine be done he said I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declared to do and determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are he said I'm only one that's near when he does it it was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through or that ought to be a that ought to be a sermon in itself to us preacher shouldn't it it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God so you see how the man could have wanted to come in intent and explain it all in detail and God wouldn't let at him because it was being held back for a special people that's us today so we would have it amen look he said it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ musicians go ahead and come the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing aren't you glad for that tonight the unfailing body work word of the son of man I like to take that with where he says there will be a bride who will have thus sayith the Lord or will keep still think about the implications of that for a minute when even a prophet has his own desire yet he has to surrender himself to the will of the Lord there will be a bride who will have their own desire but they will be so surrendered to the will of the Lord he said they'll have thus sayith the Lord or they won't do anything they'll have thus sayith the Lord or they'll keep still How would how would a bride have that because thus sayith the Lord has been revealed in our day amen because a prophet surrendered himself to the word of the Lord so a bride can surrender thems to the word of the lord we can surrender ourselves to every portion of it even the parts we don't like or that's hard on the flesh we surrender ourselves to it because we're going home one day not my will but thine be done I want to ask you as you bow your heads they play something softly I'm asking myself this question too especially myself tonight I thought a lot about this as I was in I many times I want to do my own thing I I have my own will Lord help me to surrender I want to preach certain things I want to go certain places I want to I want to do this that or the other oh God let me do your will if even a prophet had to surrender his will to the will of God what about me tonight what about you are you feeding on the word have you been gathered so you can have rapturing faith have you surrendered yourself to the word we can say it this way if you had your Gethsemane if not you need to come to that place you say Lord heart not my will but thine be done it's bright it's not all just it's not all just glory and wonderful things that's the part of it is there's many times we can shout and R the aisles but tonight Lord help me to surrender myself help me Lord to surrender myself to your will even if people don't applaud it even if the world thinks I'm crazy even if everybody else says you should have done that you should have done this or that or the other oh God let me surrender myself to your will let me have my Gethsemane let me be the one who surrenders myself totally to the unveiling of the word in my hour that I can see only you and the world can see Only You Through Me Heavenly Father Lord that's my desire tonight I've got my hands raised Lord Lord I I want you oh God I want to be completely totally surrendered Lord I I want you to move Lord in my life and in my family oh God I'm sorry where where I've I've done my own will or I've done things Lord that that were willful Lord in some way Lord to
