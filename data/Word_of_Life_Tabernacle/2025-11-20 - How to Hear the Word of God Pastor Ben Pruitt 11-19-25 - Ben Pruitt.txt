We're going to go ahead and go to the word to Romans uh chapter 10 verse1 [music] 14. That's all the music we'll do right now. We're going to have prayer in just a moment. Romans chapter 10 and verse 14. Um we'll read down through verses verse 17. It's good to be back with you. We uh had a good time and and uh got some rest and and ended up preaching several times as well. We were out there and and speaking to some young people and doing a ministers meeting and did some different stuff that we don't normally get to do. So, I was grateful to be able to do that and and me and Britney got did get some rest and got to see a part of the country we don't normally get to see. So, we were just real privileged to do that. And but it's so good to be back home. You know, there's no place that I come and preach at that has as good a atmosphere when I come to the pulpit as right here at home and the expectation of the people. So, we sure appreciate all of you coming and and being here. I did speak with uh someone who would know and brother Marty did pass away at about 5:45 this evening. But let's just be praying for that family and that church. I I think brother Marty Mccomomas was the first person that I ever met from this area. Uh I was probably seven or eight years old when I first met Brother Marty. So he was an old-timer here in the area. So let's just be praying for them and the Lord would would bless them and help them through the time of grief. and it'd be really hard on a church. So, if there's anything we could do to help them, we'd sure be glad to do that. And and uh we want to do that. Uh Sunday will be our Thanksgiving dinner. And uh so we have uh uh Sunday morning we'll have church, then we'll have our Thanksgiving dinner. So, bring something Thanksgivingy if you would. And uh it's always a good time. Um, we're going to do something maybe a little bit different at 3:00. Instead of having a regular service, we might do a a little bit of a worship service at 3:00. So, and if that works out, we'll do that. Otherwise, we just uh won't do anything at all. But I think we'll I think we can have a worship service and just enjoy the presence of the Lord. Sometimes it's hard to hear preaching after eating turkey. So, but uh I'm kind of looking forward to that. Brother Kobe Martin is supposed to be in town. So, if he'll stay for that, I'm going to be preaching Sunday morning, but if he'll stay and help us with that worship, it'd be a good time. I'm sure. Romans chapter 10 and verse 14. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. Verse 16, but they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah said, Lord, who who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, I just want to take this time and and pray for our brothers and sisters. Lord, the Mccomomas family. I pray that you'd help them tonight. And Lord, comfort sister Brenda, Lord, and the and the family. I pray you'd comfort I know Brother Freddy Hatfield and his wife and different ones, parts of the family, Lord, friends of ours. I pray that you'd just bless them tonight and help them in their time of loss. Comfort them. I pray God that you'd help those that are sick tonight. I think of sister Alice and and different ones that our brothers in West Plains, Brother JT and Sister Fritz and different ones that have not been feeling well. I pray you'd help them, Lord. And Lord, we know that you're a a prayer answering God. We pray for Brother Robert Smith, Lord. I know he's been sick while we were away. I pray, God, that you'd help them, Lord. And we know that you're still a healer to tonight. So, we claim that healing. We we claim that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. pray that you'd move in this service, move me out of the way and speak directly to your people. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You could be seated. I want to speak to you tonight on how to hear the word of God. How to hear word of God is a little bit different subject, but it's something that come to my heart. Uh because we've heard different preachers, I know, here at the church lately, not just me. And that's a good thing uh to hear different preachers. But sometimes you get used to hearing the word a certain way and uh you hear it a different way and maybe it it kind of crosses you a little bit or or you don't understand it. And yet we need all of God's men, don't we? We need all all of God's uh the five-fold ministry. We're going to talk about that tonight. We know that faith comes by hearing. And I know most of us who are here on a Wednesday night are faithful to church. We're faithful to read our Bibles. We're faithful to listen to the message. And yet our our faith sometimes it seems like it doesn't increase in proportion to our listening. Have you ever experienced that? Seem like you're listening but your faith is not increasing in proportion to your listening. And sometimes I wonder if we're hearing the sound but not the voice. &gt;&gt; The sound of it but not the voice of it. because the voice would be the particular words that are being spoken, the particular uh uh the the idea that's being conveyed. So, we're hearing the sound. And I know I do that many times. We'll listen to a tape and maybe not really hearing what God wants to speak to us through the tape or through the minister, however he might want to get that to us. And so we we know that the Israelites listened uh they they listened to Moses. They listened to the prophets. They listened even in Jesus' time, but they did not hear many times what they were listening to because they were in an atmosphere of disobedience. So when when you're listening to the word of God, it matters what atmosphere that you're listening in. Because if you're in an atmosphere to hear the voice of God, an atmosphere of faith, an atmosphere that says, "Lord, won't you speak to me? Won't you Did you come that way tonight? Lord, I want to hear from you." If you're in that kind of an atmosphere, then you can really hear from God. But if you're not in that kind of an atmosphere, then there's an atmosphere of disobedience many times or an atmosphere of unbelief and you can't really hear from God like you ought to. &gt;&gt; Right. True. So, uh, the the the Bible tells us that the eyes of the Jews were blinded because false teachers created an atmosphere of unbelief by tradition. In Romans 10:18, to continue on with where we read our text, he said, but I say, have they not heard? Yes, verily their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. But I say, did not Israel know? First, Moses said, "I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by foolish nation, I will anger you." But Isaiah is very bold and saith, I was found to them that sought me not. I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. But to Israel, he said, "All day long, I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and cainsaying people." So, he's saying that they heard it. They heard the sound of it, but they didn't hear the purpose of it. and and it is because of their disobedience and the hardness of their heart. In Matthew 13 and 10, we're going to read a lot of scripture tonight, so just bear with me. In Matthew 13:10, Jesus gives the parable of the swer and his disciples have a question because they hear the parable. How how many times do we hear what the word says and we think, is this for me? Right? Is this for us? Does this apply to us? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, Peter actually asked him, he said, he said, "Does this apply?" The disciples came and said, "Why speakest, uh, thou unto them in parables?" And, and he answered and said unto them, "Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given." I'm so glad to be one of those to whom that is given. He said, "For whoever has, to him it'll be given, and he shall have more abundance. Whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even what he has." He said, "Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand, and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand. Seeing you shall see and shall not perceive." He said, "Their heart is waxed gross. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they've closed lest at any time they should see." So they didn't have a will to hear. Their will was to not hear or or to not listen or to not believe. He said, "Lest they should understand with their heart should be converted and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see and your ears for they hear." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "For verily I say unto you, many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them. To hear those things which you hear and have not heard them." And he said, "Hear ye therefore the parable of the swer. Hear it." He said, "I want you to hear it in a different way. I want you to hear it with your heart. I want to hear want you to hear what I'm really trying to tell you." &gt;&gt; So, we know the Pharisees heard that. They listened. They they heard the sound of Jesus as he gave these parables. The Sadducees heard, but to them, he was just another teacher with a story to tell. But the Bible says, "Unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them, but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." So if we want to if we want to receive something from the word, because the object of hearing the word is not just to hear the word, but it's to build our faith. &gt;&gt; Is to produce faith. It's to produce a life of faith, something that can believe the word of God. And so if we want to believe the word of God, we've got to be profited by the word and and we've got to have faith in our listening. So if the word preached is heard in faith, it increases faith. But unbelief does not receive it. So it's got to be mixed with faith. An atmosphere of faith must be created for us to hear what is being said. I love this quote. I've read it to you before, but it's a very important one. Brother Brandham said, "Where faith is taught in a church, you'll find a church in that atmosphere." &gt;&gt; Right? Where faith is taught in a church, you'll find a church in that atmosphere. That's why I said I love to preach to you because I know that you're wanting to hear the word of God. And so, you're not you're not coming with suspicion. You're not coming with an idea, well, I I'll watch him real close and see if he crosses the word, but you're expecting to hear the word of God. And so when you come expecting that's what you'll get. And so he said faith is taught in a church and you'll find a church in that atmosphere. He said that's the reason people come among the saints where they're praying believers. He said Paul said he didn't find any in the city only Timothy that was like precious faith that he had. He said the rest of them was all denominational. But when he got into that atmosphere, see he you find things going on that the atmosphere has created. &gt;&gt; Now think about that for a minute. So you get into among a group of people where faith is being preached. He said then he said that that creates an atmosphere among the people in that group and he said you find things going on that that atmosphere is created. You find people living by faith when you get into a place where it says my why the Bible is true. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. That's a very simple thing isn't it? But it's just an atmosphere of faith that you can get into that you can say why the Bible is true. God heals. How many believe that tonight? Oh, if we could just get into an atmosphere of faith, whether we're here in the service or maybe you're watching in a in a hospital room or wherever that you're at, to get into that atmosphere of faith and say, "God is a healer. The Bible is the truth." &gt;&gt; He said, "You walk around their congregation, you find, well, I I was dying with cancer. I was healed." &gt;&gt; We've got some testimonies of that. &gt;&gt; I was once blind, I see. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the stranger will say, "Woo, my what you mean? What was the matter with you?" And he said, "I'll show you on my record. Come home with me." Now, now you can't do this unless you meet together. &gt;&gt; Right? If you stay home, you can't do this. &gt;&gt; But if you come to the house of God, you can come in an atmosphere of faith. Now, you can have an atmosphere of faith in your home, but but it you can't you can't have the benefit of somebody else's testimony. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Unless you actually meet that person. That's why it's important to go to meetings, to have meetings, to fellowship, not just in our church, but with other churches, &gt;&gt; right? Because it creates an atmosphere of faith. So, he said, he said, "Invite them over. Come eat dinner with me. I'll show you something. I got a record up there. My neighbors know I was in this kind of condition. and I was paralyzed for years and I was prayed for. See, what is it that word in that church, that group of believers has created that atmosphere? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, how is the word in its simplicity but yet in its completeness ever going to grow into a place where knowledge overshadows that and says it can't be so?" So as long as the atmosphere of faith is there, as long as the people are getting together and talking about the things of God and testifying of the things of God, he said, "How is it ever?" Oh, church, that's what we want to be. We don't want to be in a church where that atmosphere of unbelief can never overshadow the atmosphere of faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where knowledge overshadows it. Since it can't be so, so it can't. So where knowledge is preached from a seminary, the children die. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But where faith is preached from the word, &gt;&gt; the children live. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the difference. Life and death." Oh, if you find somebody that's alive, if you find a church that's alive, a family that's alive, it's because they're hearing the word of God and it's producing faith in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we know we we can only really receive what's being preached in the atmosphere of faith if it's the pure word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Cuz we're eagles. We don't eat We don't eat uh half dead or dead Karen from another age. We eat the fresh kill of the word. &gt;&gt; So, we know a preacher is telling us the truth when he preaches the word. That's simple enough, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and I know the next question maybe that at least the question that I had and you forgive me for kind of taking this a little bit easy tonight, but it's a it's a good night I think to kind of dig into these things. You say, "Well, why don't you just read the Bible?" &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because you realize that there's some humanity in what I'm going to say, but if I just stood up here and read the scripture, there wouldn't be any. &gt;&gt; Right. It would be the it would be the literal word of God that would be being read to you and and and that would be good. It would be nothing wrong with standing up here and reading the Bible, but it's not what we are called to do in church or as preachers, &gt;&gt; though it's a part of what we do. In fact, it's a big part of what we do. I think we ought to use the scriptures and preach the scriptures and preach from the scripture. &gt;&gt; But every word in the Bible is inspired. How many believe that? Yes, &gt;&gt; every word. But the Bible is is a word is the word. But what preaching is is the word in due season. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So the Bible says a word fitly spoken. It's like apples of gold and pictures of silver. That that term fitly is timely. &gt;&gt; Right? So there's a time for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know that's true. even among your friends or your family, there's a time to say certain things, &gt;&gt; right? And a time to not say certain things, &gt;&gt; right? A word spoken at the right time is like apples of gold and pictures of silver. So all of the all of the scripture is inspired, &gt;&gt; but it's not all timely. &gt;&gt; And we aren't good judges of what we need. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Right. We're human beings. Yeah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So God puts gifts in the church &gt;&gt; to speak to us, to take the word and and pulls something out of it that's timely. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. And you might say, "Well, you know, we talked about that on the way to church or or maybe it's something you've been dealing with in your life, something that you've been struggling with understanding, and God just brings it out." And and you say, "What did that?" It wasn't because of some great preacher, but it's because you come in an atmosphere of faith and God brought a word in due season to you, &gt;&gt; right? So, it's the right word at the right time. &gt;&gt; So, the Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:15, if you want to go there and then we'll get second Peter chapter 1. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, "Study to show thyself approved unto God, workmen that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." Rightly dividing the word of truth. Spurgeon said that that rightly dividing he said was like the priest. It was an illusion to the priest would actually take a sword and make straight cuts in the sacrifice because each portion was going to a different part of the Levites and they actually ate the sacrifices. You realize that the Levites ate of the temple and and they ate the sacrifice and they had a right to do that but he had to aortion it to each one and that's what he's saying. So it's rightly dividing the word of truth. Second Peter chapter 1 and verse 12, Peter says, "Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in what? The present truth." Someone say that with me. Present truth. &gt;&gt; So there's there's a truth and then there's a present truth. &gt;&gt; There's a word and a word rightly divided, &gt;&gt; right? There there's food and then there's food that you need to help you right now at this moment in your journey. Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham talks about that when he preaches Satan's Eden. He said, I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten you to the promise of God for this age. He said, "But I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written that would enlighten you to know that make you a better soldier in the field." How many want to be a better soldier? You fight the devil every day. You fight him at work. You fight him sometimes fight him even in our own families and even in [laughter] our own our own communities. We fight him all the time. The devil's always out to get you. So if you're going to be a a soldier, he said, "I wanted to give you something would make you a better soldier in this day." So he preached something to us that the a we wouldn't have heard in a Baptist church. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have heard in a Methodist church or a Pentecostal church. We heard Satan's Eden from a prophet because it was a word that was spoken in the right time &gt;&gt; in the right place to the right people that we could receive it and take it home with us. &gt;&gt; So he said, "I I want to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now." Right? So you're fighting a certain battle. He said, 'Well, I love the word. I can read the word for myself. I can do all that for myself, but he said, 'I want to make you a better soldier in the field you're fighting in now. And God has a way of giving us what we need. Aren't you glad for that? So, he said, "So you can learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you." So the Bible means just what it says, &gt;&gt; right? That's what it means. So what does the Bible mean? Well, it means just what it says. But it's got to be rightly divided, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. Portioned into its proper place. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this. He said, 'You must not misinterpret the word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I believe it means this." He said, "It means just what it says. It means no interpreter." He said, "And you must not misplace the word." Right? So, that's the things if you're writing it down. Some of you uh kids that are taking notes. Some of you adult you adults may be taking notes. It's don't [snorts] he said don't misinterpret the word. He said you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word. He said if we would do either of these it throws the whole Bible in confusion and chaos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And how many you know we've been around a while. How many cults have we seen raise up around the message &gt;&gt; because some man misinterpreted, misplaced or dislocated the word? God help us uh to not do that. And and that was uh what happened, you know, uh that's what happened with Ahab and and Micaiah. You remember the story. Ahab is going down to Ramoth Gilead to take over. It was written in the word that Ramoth Gilead was their property, right? That was their property. It belonged to them. &gt;&gt; And and the prophets of that day thought it would be advantageous to preach what the king wanted to hear, right? So they come out and said, "You can you're going to take it." And they had word to back it up. They preached from the scriptures that they were supposed to go take it. But they went down and found Micaiah. And Micaiah said, "I see all Israel scattered like a sheep without a shepherd." Right. &gt;&gt; Right. and and Ahab said you well you always prophesy bad to me. Every time I come to church I get rebuked. You know &gt;&gt; I I always disagree with what you're saying. Well, he didn't have an atmosphere of faith to receive it in. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But but now what's happening with Ahab and Micaiah is Micaiah is not not just looking at the word but he's a prophet. So he's taking the word and making it present tense. Right? That's what a prophet does. He's the divine interpreter of the word. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham deals with Ahab and Micaiah. And he said a prophet means not only to speak the word but to foretell. &gt;&gt; He said a divine interpreter of the word. The divine word written the word come to the prophet. He said and when the prophet came on the scene then and could foretell things and it happened exactly like that. God said remember he said I'm with him. He said then when he revealed the word what the other prophet had said before him come to pass he said then they knew that was true. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So he was able to go back and see what Elijah said and Micaiah took what Elijah said he but but he put it in its right season and he recognized that Ahab was the one who was going to die. &gt;&gt; Right? What was it that brother Brandham did for us as believers? The Bible's still the Bible. He didn't change the Bible, but what did he do? He made it current. He He showed us who the Antichrist was and what that system was. He showed us who the believer would be and who the bride would be. And he he he portioned it all out in such a way that we could understand it. So, &gt;&gt; are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So, Micaiah applied the word of Elijah to the present situation. Brother Brandham didn't change what Paul preached. Somebody know that &gt;&gt; he said, "I preached what Paul preached." &gt;&gt; But he took what Paul preached and brought it current. &gt;&gt; You let me give you an example. Paul said there would be a shout, a voice, and a trumpet. Right? The Lord himself shall descend with a shout. Right? That's the word. That's the truth. That's the That's the written word. It's the Bible. It's absolutely true. But a prophet of God stood up there and said, he said the shout was a message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, what's a prophet doing? He's looking. Brother Peter, what's going on right now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. He's looking at what was happening in his own ministry. &gt;&gt; And realizing that God was fulfilling his word right then. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So he stood there and said and said, "This day this scripture is fulfilled." Right? &gt;&gt; He stood there and said and said the shout is is a message. &gt;&gt; And that Paul didn't say that, but he's still preaching what Paul preached. He's just bringing it down to present tense, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, he divided it to the current age. That was brother Brandham's job. Nobody else gets that job. &gt;&gt; Nobody else has that authority. &gt;&gt; Right. That's brother Brandham's job. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for a prophet? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. No one else has that authority to divide the word in that way and show us what age in the overarching view. God didn't call me to the whole age. &gt;&gt; Right. I have a message to the age and then I take that a and I preach that as faithfully as I can to my current congregation, &gt;&gt; right, with their current needs. &gt;&gt; And God inspires that to a particular congregation, a particular person in a particular situation. And a person if they receive that in faith can say, "I'm healed. I've been saved. I've been delivered by the word of God." What was it? It wasn't me. It wasn't even brother Brandon. But it was the word of God working the way it's supposed to work. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; So again, as we said, you you know, if the Bible's all inspired, why don't we just read the Bible? Well, if the message is all inspired, why not just play the tapes? And I've got absolutely nothing against playing the tapes, right? I feel like Paul Paul said, "I speak in tongues more than you all." And uh I feel like I listen to tapes more than you all. Maybe Peter does. I'm not sure. Uh Peter plays tapes all night and I hear them coming through my vent, but uh that's his uh his the good part of Peter, you know, right there. He's done that for years. So I've heard a lot of tapes thanks to Peter. But I' I've listened to the tapes all my life and I still do. I do it all the time and and I believe in playing tapes. But why don't we just play the tapes in church? Well, let me ask you this question. Why did Peter not just read what the prophet Joel said &gt;&gt; when he come out on the day of Pentecost? &gt;&gt; Now, he did read it. He quoted Joel, right? Look at Acts 2:14. Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them, you men of Judea and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken. Now this is astounding statement. Hearken to my words. Now why would Peter say that? He said hear me, &gt;&gt; right? Because what's he what's he going to say? He said, "These are not drunken as you suppose, seeing it's but the third hour of the day. But this is that this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." And what was He was making the word of God applied to the situation that was there. He didn't misquote Joel. He didn't make it something that wasn't right. But what did he do? He applied it to the present situation. And we know that God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. That's what he was doing. God was bringing Joel to pass literally right there among them. &gt;&gt; Right? I will restore. Say all the things that Joel said. This is that outpouring of the spirit that Joel prophesied. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. The things that Joel prophesied were being manifested right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Peter says, "Hear me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is that. &gt;&gt; See, someone has to stand in the hour of fulfillment &gt;&gt; and declare that this is that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So God called a prophet to the age and he caused men with gifts not to supersede a prophet. They should never do that. Not to say something a prophet didn't say. They we should never do that. &gt;&gt; But he caused gifted men to rightly divide the word to a specific congregation, &gt;&gt; right? I give you an example. There's there's I could preach on just about anything, right? Because the message is full of stuff, &gt;&gt; right? We've got a lot of material. &gt;&gt; So, I could preach anywhere from A to Z. We could preach faith. We could preach uh we could preach judgment. We could preach about the great white throne. We could preach about right. You could just pick a topic. And if I if I took my what I'm preaching on from a poll of the congregation, right, from something what the congregation's like, well, you know, uh we'll just decide what brother Ben's going to preach and and we'll tell him on Sunday morning. If we did that, you all couldn't agree on it &gt;&gt; because you got different needs. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So the young people would say, "Speak to the young people. Preach to the young people." And the elders would say, "Preach something we can some meat that we can grab a hold of." Right? And the and some of the other folks, the married couples say, "Preach about marriage, you know, and preach at my husband." You know, [laughter] preach my wife, right? So we we've got things that we think somebody needs and and we would say that. We would want somebody to preach on that. And yet what happens is what we really need is what we actually get. &gt;&gt; And we don't realize it sometimes. &gt;&gt; What we really need. Oh, come on. You say, "Well, I'm not getting preached to like I need to be preached to." Do you not believe God is sovereign? &gt;&gt; You not believe he controls all things? &gt;&gt; Listen, he can take a a donkey, [laughter] as some have said, and speak through a donkey and give a word that would be fitly spoken in due season. &gt;&gt; Right? If he could do that for a donkey, if a donkey could correct Balum, then how much more could God correct me through a preacher? How much more could he correct me through the word, through the church, whatever that is? Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Someone has to say this is that this is what we're talking about. So our job is to be inspired, not to just come and and preach something, but it's an inspiration. I don't preach by by knowledge. I don't preach by just coming out and say, "Well, this is what the church needs." I preach by inspiration. I'll be on vacation or somewhere. I I've got a notes app on my phone. I just jot something down. I've got hundreds of notes in there. And God inspires that to me. And then I come and preach that. And sometimes it takes a service, sometimes it takes 10, sometimes it takes 20, but it's because of inspiration. And even during that, God can even move a preacher off his notes to preach directly to the situation that you're dealing with right now. &gt;&gt; And it's hard for us sometimes because sometimes we don't even know what we need and what we're hearing is exactly what we need, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it's just not what we want to hear. Now, God called again a prophet to the age, but he's called men with predestined gifts to rightly divide the word to a specific congregation. Ephesians 4:11. Go ahead and turn there with me if you got your Bibles and then we'll be going to Luke 12. Ephesians 4:11. He gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. It doesn't mean he gave some people apostles and some people prophets and some people evangelists. No, he gave some of the gifted men. Some of the gifts were apostles. Some of them were prophets. Some of them were evangelists. And some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints. Word perfecting is not sinless perfection. Brother Brandon said the blood of Jesus Christ does that. But the perfecting of the saints is the maturing of the body to make the body grow. for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Verse 13, till we all come in the unity of the faith, of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. In other words, till we're all grown up. You say, "Brother Ben, when will that be?" When we're when our bodies change &gt;&gt; at the fullness of adoption. That's what we've been preaching at, right? What we've been preaching on. So there come there's coming a time when we reach that point of the fullness of adoption, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Now we these ministry gifts are stewards of the word. So they're not they don't give they shouldn't give of themselves, but they should give of what they've been given. Does that make sense? So a minister is gifted with an ability maybe to study and to read or do something like that. They're not to give just of their own experience or what they are, but they're to give of what they've been given. &gt;&gt; So, a steward does not own anything. &gt;&gt; Right? Preachers don't own you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. A pastor doesn't own you. &gt;&gt; Right. Come on, church. A pastor is not literally your husband. I know that's been taught, but that's not the case. &gt;&gt; Preachers don't own you. Uh, nobody does. God does. Amen. We're his sheep, &gt;&gt; right? But we are stewards of the word, &gt;&gt; right? We've been given the word &gt;&gt; to give to the people, &gt;&gt; are you with me now? And we're responsible to that &gt;&gt; to give each particular audience me in due season. &gt;&gt; Right? Something that you can go with on Wednesday night, as brother Brandon said about Satan's eating. He said, "I want to give you something that you can fight the devil with." Right? And &gt;&gt; so I want to give you something tonight that you can take home and fight the devil because the devil's going to be fighting you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So Luke 12 and verse 41, this is where Peter asked that question. I got a little ahead of myself earlier, but Peter asked Jesus the question, Lord, speak thou this parable unto us or even to all. He said, who are you talking about? Right? It just didn't make a whole lot of sense to him. And the Lord said, "Who then?" Now, he said, "This is who I'm speaking to." He says, "The one who's going to be a steward, right? Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing." So, if he's given me the ability to read the word and to look into the word and to study the word to give it to you, he said, "I'll be blessed if when he comes, I'm still doing that." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Right. And and he said, "Of a truth I say to you, he'll make him ruler over all that he hath." He said, "But if that servant say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming," &gt;&gt; right, and shall begin to beat the men's servants and maidens, we've seen this, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So if that servant who's been given made a steward over over the things of God, if he if he begins to mistreat the church, &gt;&gt; are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Then my Lord delays his coming. So it doesn't matter the way I treat the church. It doesn't matter how I preach. It doesn't matter what I say. Doesn't matter how I treat people. Watch what happens. He said, "And to eat and drink and be drunk. And the lord of that servant will come in a day when he lookth not for him and an hour when he's not aware will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. &gt;&gt; This is why Paul said he said he said I I keep under my body. You remember the scripture, &gt;&gt; bring it under subjection, lest having preached to others, &gt;&gt; I myself would be a cast away, &gt;&gt; right? And what he means by that is not that he could not be in the economy of God, but he would be disapproved by God. &gt;&gt; Right? His portion would be with the unbelievers. &gt;&gt; I don't want that to be my reward. &gt;&gt; And so I do my best not to beat the sheep. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And that's as steward is to do that. So, when we're hearing the word of God, we've got to we need to hear from a faithful steward that is willing to just feed the sheep, &gt;&gt; right? Feed the sheep on Wednesday, &gt;&gt; feed the sheep on Sunday, &gt;&gt; feed the sheep on Sunday night if we have church. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Somebody who's willing to feed the sheep, not beat the sheep. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, the this kind of of a steward must be faithful. &gt;&gt; Faithful. 1 Corinthians 4:1, let a man sow account of us. So this is how people should view us as of the ministers of Christ, stewards of the mysteries of God. A steward is maybe in the old English household it'd be a butler be somebody who's in charge of the household. &gt;&gt; Right? He he he takes care of the servants. He takes care of all that goes on in the household so the master can leave him in charge and go away and it's not a mess when he gets back. But he don't answer to himself. He answers to the master. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So he said it's required in stewards that a man be found faithful. So and in that sense all of us are stewards of whatever we've been given. So you've been given the mysteries of God, some revelation of the mystery of God. Whatever that revelation is, it might be small, it might be large, but you're a steward of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You're responsible for that. And brother Brandon said, "Now, while we're here together and all of us longing the same thing, &gt;&gt; make us true stewards." Somebody could say amen to that tonight. Make us true stewards. I whatever revelation I've been given, I want to be a true steward of the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; May we shape our lives by self-control. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. That's the same thing Paul's saying. He said, "I keep under my body. I'm going to bring myself under self-control. I'm not going to give in to the excesses of the flesh or give in to being a a fighter or or a debater. I'm not going to do that because I want to be a good steward. I'm responsible for the people that I preach to. &gt;&gt; So he said he said while we're here together all of us along the same thing. May we shape our lives by self-control that we'll know by the help of the Holy Spirit to have a full confidence that Jesus will say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant at that day." Isn't that the kind of confidence that we want? Like Paul said, he said, "I fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I finished my course. &gt;&gt; There's a crown waiting for me." &gt;&gt; He said, "May we be upright, honest, and true. &gt;&gt; May we be the kind of Christian, oh, grant this to me, Lord. I don't want this just to be other people. I think preachers ought to ought to pray this as well. May we be the kind of Christian &gt;&gt; that would be a credit to any community. &gt;&gt; May we be men and women such as you could lay your hands on and say, "My servant." So it's not just the men, not just the preachers, but men and women that he could lay his hands on and say, "My servant, behold, this is my servant in whom I'm delighted. I can send them. they'll go. They know how to speak and when to speak, &gt;&gt; which is just as important as how to speak, &gt;&gt; right? And I can be with them. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was praying for preachers one time. He mentioned several specific preachers and he says this, "God bless them men and anoint them with the Holy Ghost. Grant it, Lord. May they be good stewards having great success of calling the people out of darkness &gt;&gt; into the marvelous light. Now what are stewards to be faithful in? To preach the word, &gt;&gt; right? To preach the word. Second Timothy 4:2, preach the word. &gt;&gt; Be instant in season, out of season. Rebuke, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering &gt;&gt; and doctrine. Right? If all that we do and I I read a lot, I know that I read a lot of quotes. I read a lot of scriptures because I want to be faithful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And not everybody does it like I do it. Brother Joel does it differently. Brother Stewart does it differently. But I want to be faithful, &gt;&gt; right? And whatever God's given me and the ability that God's given me, if there is any, I want to be faithful to that. &gt;&gt; And and so if I'm faithful to that, I believe God will bless it. But he told me preach the word, &gt;&gt; right? Just like he told you to go to church. Just like he told me to go to church. Just like he told us, "Ladies, don't cut your hair. Men act like men. Women act like women." Those are instructions from God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. He instructed us to do that. He told me as a preacher, preach the word, &gt;&gt; right? Be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. &gt;&gt; Listen, he said it. The Bram said it's becoming to us as ministers today. So now we see the word, what what the Bible says about it. Now, we're going to see what a prophet said about it. It's becoming to us as ministers today to see that this word is preached, to see that it's done. And I believe that's not just preaching the Bible, but it's preaching the present truth of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right? The revelation of the message of the hour. So, he said, "It's becoming to us to see that it's done. It's becoming to us a man of these hour that we're living in. We're not men of another hour. We're a man of this hour, &gt;&gt; right? We're people of this hour. We got specific challenges for our church and our congregation and and our people that we're living around your family and my family. Specific challenge. Aren't you glad that God foresaw that before the foundation of the world and he gifted men in our age to speak directly to us? &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. That's why you get to the point where you think, my goodness, I might not have made it in any other place, but I found See, God ordained that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right? Someone that could speak to your specific situation, but maybe there are others that he couldn't speak to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's okay, right? You can't preach to everybody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the Brandon was called to the age we were not as ministers. We're called to specific groups of people, &gt;&gt; right? So, an evangelist would be called to the people that he preaches to. But you don't have to preach to everybody. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. A missionary would be called to the whole world, but in a different way to call to bring them in, &gt;&gt; right? An apostle to bring them in, to establish them &gt;&gt; in present truth. A a prophet would be called to to reveal the word of God. A pastor's called to take care of the sheep &gt;&gt; by feeding them the word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, &gt;&gt; it's a different gift, but we're we're preaching to specific audiences in particular places. Good. &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought to thank God &gt;&gt; for the word that we've been given. &gt;&gt; And what I'm saying is that then we should receive that in an atmosphere of faith, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I believe that this is a man of God preaching the word of God. And now, Lord, help me to receive it and help me to go. Now, that don't mean you don't check it out, but it means you receive it as the atmosphere of faith. And then you check it out to make sure that it is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And then if it is the word of God, you're responsible to it. right &gt;&gt; to go and live it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon says, "Becoming to us, man of these hour that we're living in," he said, "great men in the earth today." Oh, God, they're out there. Let them see it and grab the sword. No matter what the opposition, if God be for you, who can be against you? We don't care jeopardizing our social living. We don't care jeopardizing this, that, or the other. We want to get the water of life back. He was talking about David's mighty men that went down to the well of Bethlehem to get a drink for David. And he said he still longs for a drink of Pentecostal water. &gt;&gt; The same water they had at the beginning. &gt;&gt; So what's he saying? It's time. It's time to preach. &gt;&gt; This is the time. If there ever was a time to preach, sir, &gt;&gt; this is the time to preach. Why, brother Ben? Because this is the hour when the most when Satan's preaching. He hasn't called his ministry off the field. &gt;&gt; That his ministry of television, his ministry of of Hollywood, his ministry of evil spirits all over the place. He's got messengers everywhere that let us go forth as ministers of the gospel. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us ministers be a flame of fire." &gt;&gt; Preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is the time to preach. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm not just saying that. Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham said that. And he said, "Now in this New Testament age, &gt;&gt; remember his job is to make it present &gt;&gt; to show us this is that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. In this New Testament age, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses his church and sanctifies it that his Holy Spirit might continue to carry the work of God on through all ages. &gt;&gt; And he's just the same today. &gt;&gt; He said, "If it isn't, then we're false witnesses of this Bible." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "If that isn't true, then the Bible isn't true. &gt;&gt; It's time." &gt;&gt; Look, what time is it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, preach that sermon, sir. What time is it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "It's time that men preach the gospel, sir." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's a different time now. If you can show me where Brother Brandham said that, &gt;&gt; then I'll believe it." &gt;&gt; Yes. See, but he said, he did say, "It's time that men preach the gospel." &gt;&gt; It's time that the power of God was made known. How many believe that today when he that is trying to step on the word, don't you see what they're doing? They they they brought up just in the last 10 or 15 years. Look how far Come on, church. You You if you ever needed to go to church, now's the time to go to church. If you ever needed to hear a preacher, now's the time to hear a preacher. &gt;&gt; Satan's after your kids. Satan's after your wife. Satan's after your husband. He's He's going coming as hard as he can come &gt;&gt; against the people of God. &gt;&gt; I hope we can see that tonight. We We see anxiety and depression and suicide and and perverted sexual sins and all these different things coming in. Now's not the time to quit church. &gt;&gt; I know I'm preaching to the choir on a Wednesday night, but now's not the time to quit church. Now's the time to get in church. He said, "It's time for men to preach the gospel." &gt;&gt; When he trying to step on the word, we need men like the Hebrew children. Our God is able to deliver us from this. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. It's time, sir. &gt;&gt; God remains the same." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Preached that in a sermon called the unchangeable God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did Paul say? How will they hear without a preacher? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's God's provided way. Brother Brandon said, "He uses not the agency of any mechanical device, but the agency of man, a man that's surrendered and consecrated to God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, how should we hear that word which is preached? If it's time to preach, it's time to hear. &gt;&gt; We should receive in an atmosphere of faith drawing through the filter of the Bible, &gt;&gt; the word, right? &gt;&gt; So, we want to know the word. We want to read the word &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham was a word prophet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So what brother Brandham preached come out of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Right. So we want to know the Bible &gt;&gt; so we'll know the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Remember when brother Brandham talked about he would talk about Moses or rather he would talk about Joseph and Mary. You remember you talk about how that they were sitting there reading the scripture right that that day &gt;&gt; and it was reading Isaiah where it says a virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; Right. And they begin to talk about it. He said, "When you talk about it, he comes around." &gt;&gt; And that day, the angel met her &gt;&gt; and said, "You're the one. Blessed art thou Mary, highly favored among women." And she said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Why could she have that kind of atmosphere of faith to receive it? Because she'd been reading it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon even talked about the disciples. He said when they were little, their daddies got them around, read them the word of God, read them the scrolls, and showed them where there was a Messiah coming. Somebody read the woman at the well. Don't think you're Listen, if you're reading your kids the scripture, you keep on doing that &gt;&gt; because somebody read the the woman at the well that there would be a Messiah coming. She knew it. &gt;&gt; Somehow she had heard &gt;&gt; and when she saw the manifestation of God, he said, he said, "I am he that speaketh to thee." She immediately ran into the city, &gt;&gt; said, "Come see a man." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Her life completely changed. Why? Because she had she had heard the word. Kids, read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Teenagers, read the Bible, &gt;&gt; right? And when you get the Bible, when you get it down, you really read the Bible, listen to the message, and the Bible become a new book to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Read the Bible and pray. And then when you hear a prophet, it'll become fresh to you. &gt;&gt; You'll know what he's talking about. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced a lot of people have quit believing that brother Brandham had the spirit of Elijah because they don't know who Elijah was. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; They just got brought into a message and just kind of fit in and did what everybody else did, &gt;&gt; but they didn't see it in the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God, help us to see it in the word so we can convey that to our children, to our children's children if the Lord carries. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we're to we're to be in an atmosphere of faith. Can I have five more minutes? All right. I didn't even look to see if anybody gave it to me. Are are you okay tonight? Y'all wanted the pastor back. Then when the pastor comes back, then everybody's like, "Man, we want some of them evangelists." But I'm glad I'm glad God's got some evangelists. 1 John chapter 4 and verse one. Beloved, believe not every spirit, &gt;&gt; right? but try the spirit. So that we have a responsibility beyond just listening, beyond just even comparing scripture with scripture and those things, but he said, "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they're of God." &gt;&gt; So I know sometimes we reject the preaching of the word just out of hand because it challenges some idea that we have. Make sure we check our idea with the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Right. And try the spirit of the man. &gt;&gt; Right? Because a man could say something wrong, but try the spirit of the man. What's his motive? What's his his objective? &gt;&gt; Right? And we're not supposed to use a filter of our ideas, but a filter of the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, and brother Brandon taught us to discern spirits. I don't have time to get through all this tonight, but we'll we'll skip on through it. But we're not supposed to discern spirits by whether or not a person agrees with us. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Or goes to the same meetings we go to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. We're taught to discern spirits. Brother Brandon preached a sermon. It would be good for you to listen to it. He's called the discernment of spirits. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And it's how to discern spirits. He taught us that. He said, and he taught talked about it with ministry. We don't discern whether a person agrees with us. We don't discern if they have signs and wonders or how gifted their ministry is. &gt;&gt; He said, "Discern their motive and their objective." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Well, I wish more people would do that. &gt;&gt; Because we're all human beings, &gt;&gt; right? But if we could find a person that had the right motive in bringing the word, was a good steward of the word, then we'd be okay. &gt;&gt; Now look, brother Brand said, I think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world we see today. He said we have an order from God is for the discerning of spirits trying the spirit. He said, I believe that's a very great lesson. So it's not just for ministers. He said for the church today is to try the spirit of anything. have discernment of the spirit so we don't judge by denomination. He said we should never judge by denomination. We should judge a man by the spirit he has. He said we are to discern spirits. Watch what the man has in mind. What he's trying to achieve. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So he may get his his what is that? His uh words up. I don't even know if I said that right. He may get things backwards. Brother Brandham did sometimes. Right. But try the spirit &gt;&gt; and see what his motive is. What is his objective? &gt;&gt; Look what he's trying to achieve. Listen to this. He's got odd ideas to ours. Let's go to that next slide. He's got odd ideas to ours. That's perfectly all right. We can preach there for an hour, but we won't. He's got odd ideas. That's okay. Oh, surely not because my ideas are right. How do you know? &gt;&gt; The truth is some people have made themselves God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And that's why they can't ever be crossed &gt;&gt; or corrected &gt;&gt; because they've literally made themselves a deity. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; God help us tonight not to do that. &gt;&gt; But the only way we can become deity speaking, listen to me, church, is by completely surrendering ourselves to that that voice in the inside to the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he said if you got odd ideas to ours and he said that's perfectly all right if he's trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God. Discern that in him. If he's wrong and true in heart God will bring him around to the truth of the thing. &gt;&gt; After a while &gt;&gt; let him alone. He said let him alone. See what he's trying to do. &gt;&gt; See what he's trying to do. Again, he said, "I'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart." &gt;&gt; He said, "God will respect it more." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, to hear the word of God, then we we don't hear with suspicion, but we humble ourselves to the word. &gt;&gt; Look at the difference in Acts 13. How the Jews and Gentiles receive the word. Acts 13:48. You can go ahead and turn there if you want. I I promise I'm not going to hold you all night. It's only 8:23. You already knew that. Acts 13:48. When the Gentiles heard this, would they hear the preaching of the word? They heard how God had turned to the Gentiles and they said, "Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We love that." They were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And verse 49, "And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region." &gt;&gt; Yes. But the Jews, now we have a different response, &gt;&gt; right? So the Gentiles heard gladly. &gt;&gt; But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their coast. What was it? Now the Jews said they believed the written word. The Gentiles didn't even know what the written word was. &gt;&gt; But the Gentiles received the word gladly, the present truth, and the Jews turned it down. Right. &gt;&gt; How should we hear the word? We should hear it like this. Acts 17:10. &gt;&gt; The brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea who coming there went into the synagogue of the Jews. These were more noble than those in Thessalonica. In that they received the word with all readiness. That word means forwardness or predisposition. It's a willing mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They receive the word with a readiness of mind and search the scriptures daily. So don't just don't just take what a man says for gospel, but receive it in an atmosphere of faith and then search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And if you find something that's wrong, you just lay that aside, toss that out. Don't toss the man out because he might have the right motive and God will bring him around. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yes. So, Acts 17:12, therefore, many of them believed because they received the word with a ready mind and searched the scriptures also of honorable women which were Greeks and of men, not a few. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm closing his musicians come. If you want deity in your midst, this is brother Brandon speaking in the church age book. He said, then welcome and receive the word. Do you realize why they rejected Christ when he came was because it was the word. It was God's wrapped gift in a package they didn't expect and didn't want. &gt;&gt; It was different from the way they imagined it. How many people come through a church or come through the the message, they come to it for a while and it's different from what they imagined and because of that they leave and say, "Well, they're off the word. [music] It's a cult. something else because it's different, right? But it was exactly what God said it would be. He was the word when he came. He came exactly the way the word said he would come. But they had just missed the manifestation of it. They were okay with the written word. Every one of the scribes and Pharisees can quote to you, "A virgin shall conceive." But they couldn't believe it when it came because it was wrapped differently than the way they would have wrapped it. It came differently than what they had preconceived. But God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. So how should we receive the word the way that the shepherds receive the word? When they stood there on the hill and the angels came down and told them that he's born, what did they do? They ran to see if what the angels told them was correct. Oh, I think we ought to do that. That's what the Brians did. When they heard the word, they took what the messenger said and they said, "Let's run and see if he is the word made flesh. Let's run and see if he is a healer. Let's search the scriptures and see if he is what they say he is." And then they received it and believed it and were baptized in the Acts two story. They were baptized [music] because they received Peter's words. The brother said, "Don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word." What a challenge [music] to us. Again, he said, 'I wonder a church. I I can I say this this way? This has always stuck out to me. Brother Aaron McGary read this years ago at a men's meeting I was at and this quote just stuck with me because I know that there's many times I'm not sufficiently [music] impressed with the word. Say, "God, help me to be tonight." When we try in our own effort try to make something happen, he said, "Preach the word. Preach the word. It won't go out void. It'll come back to you." He said, "I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst." Brother Brandham told us, he said, "If you don't like what's being preached," he said, "don't reject it." He said if it's he said when I eat a cherry pie he said I don't I don't spit the pie out refuse to eat the pie if I come across a seed. He said [music] I spit out the seed. If there's a seed spit it out. But we want to be like Mary said be it unto me according to your word. Whatever the truth is that's what I want. And I'll be willing to search the scriptures and receive it in an atmosphere of faith. [music] That's how to hear the word. Do you love him tonight? Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful, Lord, for your blessings. Seems like I'm so excited every time to come back when the people are I haven't seen them in a while. And Lord, it just means so much to us. And I pray that it wasn't too much, Lord, but that be something here we could grab a hold of. Lord, I thank you for all that you've [music] done for us. Lord, as I travel all over the country, I see different churches and the struggles [music] and things that people go through and and I'm thankful, Lord. Lord, I thank you for people that [music] hear the word with a ready mind, a willing heart. Thank you for that. [music] I pray that would continue among us, Lord, that we'd have an atmosphere of faith to believe whatever the prophet said, whatever the word said, whatever the Bible says, whatever whatever is preached, as long as it's with what the Bible says. as long as it's something that the prophet preached. I pray you'd help us to receive it, Lord. And thank you for that. I I pray that you'd you keep us in your word. The enem is on every hand trying to defeat the [music] people, trying to defeat me. But Lord, I know, oh God, that we can come by your word. We've been given a a sword to fight with, Lord, a shield of faith, Lord. Something we can defend ourselves with. I thank you for it, Lord. I pray that you'd move in a mighty way. Heal the sick tonight, Lord. I pray again for those that have lost loved ones, Lord. That you'd bless them immensely. We pray. We thank you for it tonight in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you [music] tonight. My voice is bad, but I just felt like bringing those things. I hope it was a blessing. &gt;&gt; Your life [singing] will never [music] be the same. Can we [singing] stand together? &gt;&gt; And there's only one way to touch him. [singing] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, just believe when you call on [singing] his name. &gt;&gt; I wanted to I wanted to say something before you sing it again. time. I uh mom had a little bit of a blood pressure emergency last night and had called the the ambulance. She probably don't want you all to know that, [music] but I wanted you all to be praying. And it's just an imbalance or something in her ear that's causing her to her blood pressure to go up. And we believe he's a healer. Do we believe that? Let's just all pray together. Mom has been such a precious part of the church. And I'm so glad to have my mother with me. There was a time when ministry kept us apart and I was unable to be with her and her with me, but we're able to be together now. And I thank God for that every day. And if your mother's living, it means a lot. And to have her close to you. And so, mom's a big help to us. And we just want to pray the Lord will heal her, whatever this is, and take care of it. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we love you tonight. We thank you, God. I pray that you'd reach down right now, Lord, and heal my the body, Lord, of my mother. Lord, you're you're no respector of persons, but Lord, she's Lord, she's served you all of her life. And I pray, God, that you would help her and bless her [music] right now. Lord, we claim her healing. We believe that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. We thank you, Lord, for doing it. And we ask you to come right now, Lord, in this presence. May maybe there be someone else here, Lord, in need of healing tonight. May your anointing go over them right where they're at, oh God. May they receive their healing. We pray. I thank you, Lord, for my mother. I pray you'd bless her. Take away every spirit of fear, Lord, every every anxiety, Lord, that would come. And I pray you'd heal her completely. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Life will never be the same. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, you believe you can touch him tonight. And there's only [music] one way &gt;&gt; to touch him. &gt;&gt; Oh, just [singing] believe when you call on his name. Sing it one more time with all your hearts now. Oh, &gt;&gt; touching Jesus.
