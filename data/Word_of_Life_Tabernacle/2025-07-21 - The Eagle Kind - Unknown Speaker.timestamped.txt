[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] Well, I'm singing about the different
[0:03] breed. Amen.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; We sprang up from the original seed.
[0:09] Chosen and elected from the beginning of
[0:14] time.
[0:17] We'll never be a chicken. We won't take
[0:22] the devil's licking.
[0:26] We're born winners. Were the eagle kind.
[0:33] We're an army of believers. That makes
[0:37] us naturalborn receivers.
[0:42] Hopeless thoughts and doubts and fears
[0:46] we've left behind.
[0:49] While others think of dying. All I've
[0:54] got on my mind is flying.
[0:57] I repeat, that's the nature of the eagle
[1:03] kind.
[1:05] No barnyard bruise can hold us. No
[1:10] chicken coop can mold us. We'll just
[1:15] keep on going. We'll never lie behind.
[1:22] We're going to keep on growing. And this
[1:25] bunch will do more than growing. I
[1:29] repeat, not the chicken worth, the eagle
[1:34] kind.
[1:36] Well, we're an army of believers. That
[1:41] makes us naturalborn receivers.
[1:45] Our hopeless thoughts, our doubts and
[1:48] fears.
[1:53] While others think of dying, all I've
[1:57] got on my mind is flying.
[2:00] I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[2:06] kind. What shall we try now? We're an
[2:09] army of believers that makes us naturalb
[2:14] born receivers.
[2:16] Our hopeless thoughts and doubts and
[2:20] fears we've left behind
[2:23] [Music]
[2:24] while others fing
[2:28] all I've got on my mind is flying.
[2:32] I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[2:37] kind.
[2:39] Yeah. While others think of dying,
[2:44] all I've got on my mind is right. I
[2:48] repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[2:53] kind.
[2:54] Yeah. I repeat, that's the nature of the
[3:00] evil kind. mind.
[3:02] [Music]
[3:04] Hallelujah.
