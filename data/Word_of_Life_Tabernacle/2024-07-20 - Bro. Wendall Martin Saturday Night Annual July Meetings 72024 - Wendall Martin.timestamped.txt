[0:01] 15 of them last night I think that is
[0:03] right isn't it Brethren the five first
[0:05] 15 of those cards that was given
[0:07] out now we'll call some more of them and
[0:11] maybe tonight if faith is coming hot
[0:14] maybe we can get two or three groups of
[0:15] them and if not I asked every person
[0:18] here how many people in here that
[0:20] doesn't have a prayer card and would
[0:21] want to be healed by God tonight just
[0:23] raise your hand doesn't have a prayer
[0:26] card well it's just you can hardly tell
[0:28] it's just solid everything where I'm
[0:30] going to ask you something this may be
[0:32] my first time of Ever meeting it it's
[0:34] too bad that we can't stay a little
[0:36] longer in meeting and you know how to
[0:38] accept Divine Healing Divine many times
[0:41] when people are healed a growth is a is
[0:43] a demon every sickness is of the devil
[0:47] God would don't put sickness on his
[0:48] children the devil does that and if
[0:51] Satan cast out Satan you say well the
[0:53] devil heals too well Jesus said he
[0:56] couldn't he said if Satan cast out
[0:58] Satan's kingdom is divided so he can't
[1:00] only God can heal medicine doctors do
[1:03] not claim to heal male Brothers is one
[1:06] of our best authorities they said we
[1:08] don't want claim to heal so we only
[1:09] claim to assist nature there's only one
[1:11] Healer that's God they can sew a place
[1:13] up in your hand but they can't heal it
[1:15] they can only SE it up a dentist can
[1:17] pull a tooth but who's going to heal the
[1:18] place a doctor can take a pendic out but
[1:22] who's going to heal the place he C God
[1:24] does medicine doesn't bu tissue medicine
[1:27] is only an aid to God is the Healer
[1:29] right doctor can set your arm but when
[1:31] he comes and set your arm and you don't
[1:32] go out and you're not well the doctor
[1:34] does his part what he's taught to do and
[1:37] knowledge to do he set your arm but he
[1:40] leaves it for God to heal that's right
[1:42] all healing is of God so now you just
[1:45] believing and sometimes when those gr
[1:47] the life go out of them as the demon
[1:49] well then those gr die if the life went
[1:51] out of you of course you would die your
[1:54] life will go from you but the body's
[1:56] still there it shrinks if there's an
[1:58] Undertaker here no as a human body
[2:00] anybody any uh flesh strengths when the
[2:03] life is got watch a little animal when
[2:05] it's when it's uh killed on the road
[2:08] it'll weigh or some of you Hunters here
[2:10] if you kill an animal beef or Butcher
[2:13] and you lay it on the scale and weigh it
[2:14] now just kill it wa and in the morning
[2:16] weigh it again see how many times
[2:17] lighter it is then let it lay there for
[2:20] 2 or 3 days then see how many times
[2:21] heavier It is Well a growth when it dies
[2:24] the demon goes out of the growth like
[2:26] tumor cancer cataract so forth when the
[2:29] demon goes out of it which is aive every
[2:32] person here come from one little
[2:35] germ and and you begin to develop cells
[2:38] and those cells uh come into after the
[2:41] nature of the life that was in it which
[2:43] made man the cell from the dog makes the
[2:46] dog the bird the bird ever after its
[2:49] nature every kind but now a demon which
[2:52] is a growth or it doesn't have to come
[2:55] and grow it's um starts developing cells
[2:58] say for instance cancer it's starts to
[3:00] developing cells and becomes larger
[3:02] larger well now it's got a
[3:04] life and it's a living just the same as
[3:07] you was living and developing in the
[3:09] womb of your mother the same thing
[3:10] you're developing but now that life
[3:12] isn't your life it's a different life
[3:14] you've got life to live and that's a
[3:16] life of death or a spirit of death
[3:19] rather pardon me and it's death now it
[3:21] doesn't belong in you it wasn't in there
[3:23] before but it's there now well then who
[3:25] put that in there it only has to come
[3:28] from one thing that's the
[3:30] and it's a germ cancer tumor any of
[3:33] those things come from a germ and you
[3:34] come from a germ too see so when that
[3:39] die for instance like cataracts the
[3:42] person's got cataracts when the spirit
[3:44] leads the people say oh I can see I can
[3:46] see and the next day they can see much
[3:48] better well then about after about 72
[3:50] hours corruption sets in like the
[3:52] resurrection of Jesus that's the cells
[3:54] didn't corrupt you raised before the
[3:56] three days and nights of course you see
[3:57] died on Friday afternoon rais Sunday
[3:59] morning called David said I'll not leave
[4:00] his soul in Hell neither I suffer my
[4:02] Holy One see corruption those cells
[4:04] begin to break in 72 hours and uh but
[4:06] and then when the patient when that
[4:07] begins to swell that growth getting
[4:09] bigger they'll of course your heart has
[4:12] to purify the bloodstream a lady came to
[4:14] me last night a very saintly Godly
[4:16] looking woman with a big cancer that she
[4:18] said she come in the line and said it
[4:20] was all covered over her hair and said I
[4:21] stood looked at her and told her under
[4:23] the spirit she had cancer in her head
[4:25] but said it was going to come off and it
[4:27] come off and she's got it here I guess
[4:28] tonight here in a bottle of alcohol
[4:29] right here now youve had thousands of
[4:31] them is a woman in the building would
[4:33] you stand up if a woman's anywhere in
[4:34] the building with that cancer in the
[4:36] alcohol if she's anywhere in a building
[4:38] is she standing up wave your hand or
[4:40] something so someone would see you yeah
[4:42] there's the lady standing there okay and
[4:45] um I've seen him stand right on the
[4:47] platform just turn white and drop right
[4:49] off on the platform see now that's a
[4:51] miracle usually when the growth is dead
[4:55] the life goes out of it but the growth
[4:57] if you can't drop off it's on the inside
[5:00] and if it does of course it'll lay there
[5:02] for a few days and begin to swell up
[5:04] like any other flesh the cells will
[5:05] begin to break then you get real sick
[5:07] with a fever of course it's an infection
[5:09] like the heart pumps the blood and
[5:12] purifies the body there's a big lump of
[5:13] Flesh laying loose in your body the
[5:15] patient gets violently sick then they
[5:17] say
[5:18] oh I felt so good when on the platform
[5:21] and for a day or two but I guess I've
[5:22] lost my healing why brother sister
[5:24] that's the best sign in the world you've
[5:26] got your healing see and then you start
[5:29] dis beling and just as sure as your
[5:31] faith taking the life away your unbelief
[5:33] will bring it back again it will it'll
[5:35] resurrect it remember Jesus said when
[5:37] the unclean spirits gone out of a man he
[5:39] walks in dry places then he returns with
[5:41] seven other Spirits is that right and
[5:43] the so let the good man of the house
[5:45] Faith there no matter how you feel it
[5:47] ain't what you feel it's what you
[5:48] believe Jesus never did say did you feel
[5:51] it he said did you believe it that was

[9:29] [Music]
[9:31] now many times is there someone on those
[9:35] lights someone at the light that could
[9:37] move them now sometimes this Holy Spirit
[9:43] it comes and many of you seen the
[9:45] picture if I ever come again I'll bring
[9:46] you some of them as the Brother Moore
[9:48] was telling tonight it's been taken
[9:50] several times and in the books I guess
[9:52] you all got them we I only had two boxes
[9:54] so I uh hope you enjoy them real well
[9:59] and now they you look in there you'll
[10:01] see another picture of it where it
[10:02] settled down in a newspaper photographer
[10:04] caught that when it C in Arkansas but it
[10:06] wasn't authentic like this American
[10:08] Association and they they got it and it
[10:11] was then it became authentic so we and
[10:14] many thousands of people I was standing
[10:16] on the river here some time ago
[10:18] baptizing 500 after a Revival and it
[10:21] come right down where I was standing and
[10:23] people fainted and just there where was
[10:26] and it was just like a roar noise
[10:28] whipping fire I I pray that God will
[10:30] come visible before the audience tonight
[10:32] in that manner here it's a capital once
[10:34] more if I can find favor with God now
[10:38] you realize it could come to some eyes
[10:40] and wouldn't to others we don't want to
[10:42] think that but it does John was the one
[10:44] who bear record seeing the spirit of God
[10:46] over Jesus is that right never said the
[10:48] A and the the wise man followed a star
[10:51] do you believe that and it passed over
[10:53] every observatory in the land always in
[10:55] the orient weeks and months are coming
[10:58] and they kept time by the Stars they
[11:00] watched all night long they kept time
[11:02] and no one ever saw it but the wise man
[11:05] did for they were looking for it You' be
[11:08] looking for Christ tonight you'll see
[11:10] him the Lord Jesus bless you all right
[11:13] then Billy Paul Brother Moore some of
[11:16] you is every is
[11:19] ready is they got the whole line lined
[11:21] up Billy the whole 15 all 15 lined
[11:25] up now to the rest of you try the ones
[11:29] that hasn't got a prayer card and know
[11:31] you won't be in the line I want you to
[11:33] look this way and just believe and you
[11:35] believe with the same kind of faith that
[11:36] that woman had touched His Garment and
[11:39] he turned and said thy faith has saved
[11:42] thee do you believe he's the same
[11:43] tonight do you believe in all that
[11:45] howling mob that poor little old blind
[11:48] man sitting down by the walls of Jericho
[11:49] probably twice the distance of this
[11:50] building a scream and a holler and have
[11:52] mercy on me Jesus perhaps never heard
[11:55] his
[11:56] call but he felt his fi that move
[12:00] and all that bunch of critics and he
[12:02] turned and said thy faith has saved the
[12:04] he turned into the audience and said
[12:05] differently why reason you in your heart
[12:08] said to the woman at the well go get
[12:10] your husband and he said I can do
[12:13] nothing except the father shows
[12:17] me I to ask you
[12:20] something if what I have said is the
[12:23] truth if it is the truth then God's
[12:27] obligated to his word not to me but to
[12:30] his word is that right he's obligated to
[12:33] his
[12:34] word and then he will bring that to pass
[12:37] just exactly the way he said he would do
[12:39] it and if he does do it will all of you
[12:43] then in here if you haven't receive
[12:46] Jesus Christ would you be willing to do
[12:48] it and you that you're that can see his
[12:50] Mercy to others yeah he will have mercy
[12:53] to you if you'll just have faith and
[12:56] believe just pray and say Lord I I'm a
[12:59] Believer and I want you to heal me
[13:02] tonight and God will do it we have just
[13:06] left Africa recently where I'm to return
[13:09] again in the next few weeks Africa India
[13:13] Palestine Germany and a
[13:16] Ministry and at Durban South Africa
[13:20] after about three or four people have
[13:22] passed through the prayer line and
[13:23] they've seen the power of the Holy
[13:26] Spirit moving in the people and and seen
[13:29] what God was doing 30,000 accepted Jesus
[13:32] as personal Savior and one all Rec call
[13:35] 30,000 at one
[13:37] time so I believe if we'll take God's
[13:41] word as the
[13:43] rule and go into all the world and
[13:45] preach the gospel the gospel came not in
[13:47] word only but through Power and
[13:49] demonstration of the holy spirit so the
[13:52] the gospel is demonstrating the power of
[13:55] the Holy Spirit I've went into Nations
[13:58] that say now we we don't want
[13:59] missionaries we know more about it than
[14:01] you do but the thing we want to see is
[14:04] somebody that's got faith enough to make
[14:06] God's word manifest that's what they
[14:08] want to see and that's how they get
[14:11] converted that's how they find Christ is
[14:15] because they they believe in that
[14:18] man and I trust to God with all my heart
[14:21] that there will be many many here
[14:23] tonight who will find Christ the same to
[14:26] their heart may the Lord Jesus Jesus of
[14:30] Nazareth bless each and every one of you
[14:32] is my
[14:34] prayer now
[14:37] okay no man seeks God at any time God
[14:41] seeks
[14:42] man never did a man seek God in all the
[14:45] world God seeking man when man first
[14:48] fell in the Garden of Eden it showed the
[14:50] strain of man man hid God was hunting
[14:53] man Jesus said no man can come to me
[14:56] except my father draw him it has to be
[14:59] drawn of the father first and then I
[15:02] would like to explain something to
[15:05] you uh seeing a vision how many people
[15:08] in here ever dreamed a dream let's see
[15:10] your hands I guess 2/3 of you there is
[15:14] true that many people doesn't dream
[15:16] that's your subconscious we're taught
[15:18] here's your first conscience here's your
[15:20] subconscious now this subconscious is
[15:22] what I'm trying about with the Holy
[15:25] Spirit to work on this first conscience
[15:27] I might ask this man here any man along
[15:29] here someone do you believe oh yes sir
[15:32] you believe it here but what about this
[15:34] man down here he's the one that runs the
[15:36] ship not the man up in the Pilot House
[15:38] it's the man in the engine
[15:40] room sometimes when you go to sleep you
[15:43] go into this subconscious and you
[15:45] dream and you dream of things you did
[15:47] when you were here then when you wake up
[15:51] you remember things that you dream you
[15:53] people that dreamed dreams many years
[15:55] ago you dream them you still remember
[15:58] well there was some part of you
[16:00] somewhere isn't that right or you
[16:03] wouldn't remember something that you
[16:05] dreamed many years ago now the man who
[16:07] sleeps sound his subconscious is way
[16:09] back he never gets to him but a
[16:12] sear his subconscious is not back there
[16:15] neither is it here it's right here he
[16:18] doesn't go to sleep he got his eyes open
[16:21] and he just seen now
[16:24] that God gave that man a place where he
[16:27] could sleep sound and not dream
[16:29] God gave man the way to dream dreams I'd
[16:31] say dream me a dream you couldn't do
[16:34] it then God puts in the church stum
[16:38] Apostles prophets Gifts of healing is
[16:41] that right they're all for the
[16:43] perfecting of the
[16:45] church Paul said if there come if you
[16:47] all speak with tongues and the unlearned
[16:50] comes in won't he say you're all mad but
[16:53] if one prophesies and reveals the
[16:55] secrets of the heart won't they fall
[16:57] down and say truly God is with you you
[16:59] is that right is that the gospel well
[17:02] wasn't that Jesus Christ yesterday isn't
[17:05] he today you can believe him by speaking
[17:07] with tongu you can believe him by the
[17:09] Holy Spirit and I believe him in the
[17:11] full measure that he is the same Lord
[17:14] Jesus he's not dead he rose from the
[17:17] dead and here
[17:18] tonight here at the platforms
[17:22] now and may He bless and help I've never
[17:26] been in this country before and as far
[17:28] as I I know there's not a living soul
[17:30] that I can see before me that I know
[17:32] very few here on the platform brother
[17:34] Bose I remember him I've seen the man
[17:37] there next to him I don't remember his
[17:39] name but and I brother Lindsay just a
[17:42] maybe three or four ministers studing
[17:44] here that I know in the building but God
[17:47] knows all of you is that true he knows
[17:49] all of you now this lady standing here
[17:52] God in heaven knows I never seen her in
[17:54] my life as I know of Are We strangers
[17:56] lady we are perfect strangers
[18:00] but God knows her now if Jesus is the
[18:04] same yesterday today and forever let's
[18:06] change a picture now what he was
[18:07] yesterday when he was going to find out
[18:10] something about a woman he said bring me
[18:12] a drink she
[18:14] said why it's not customary for this to
[18:17] happen in Jews and so forth with the
[18:19] Samaritans but Jesus speaking to her a
[18:21] little while he found just where her
[18:23] trouble was is that right now if Jesus
[18:26] has risen from the dead now and is
[18:28] living in us tonight a little while the
[18:32] world sees me no more yet you shall see
[18:34] me for I eyes a personal pronoun I will
[18:38] be with you even in you to the end of
[18:41] the world that's the gospel truth you
[18:43] might not have read it that way or
[18:44] thought of it that way but that's the
[18:46] way it's written in the Bible that's
[18:48] your theology might have bypassed it
[18:50] somewhere but that's the way it's
[18:52] written in the Bible I will be with you
[18:54] even in you to the end of the world now
[18:59] uh you know I'm waiting for something
[19:01] that is true it's the angel of the Lord
[19:04] that's true I'm just as helpless as it
[19:05] could be just like any rest of you and

[1:51:20] the faith of the people back to the
[1:51:22] original grain and what went into the
[1:51:25] ground here is the same the grain has
[1:51:27] come up through here it has come up as
[1:51:30] the Son of God now it reveals itself as
[1:51:34] the son of man and then it reveals
[1:51:36] itself as the son of David on the throne
[1:51:38] see them three sons just exactly oh my
[1:51:41] again like the original now to the

[1:52:22] in our generation can you say amen amen
[1:52:26] this is the Glorious season amen for the

[1:53:25] that creation has been waiting on this
[1:53:28] is the day all of Earth has been long

[1:54:13] somebody is going to receive it and he
[1:54:15] said that is right amen the Apostle Paul
[1:54:18] would say there in the book of Romans in
[1:54:21] the eth chapter and he he would he you
[1:54:23] this is something that we all amen we we
[1:54:25] know pretty well there in the 20th verse
[1:54:28] it says the creature was was made
[1:54:30] subject to vanity he says not willingly
[1:54:34] but by reason of him who have subjected
[1:54:36] the same in Hope but because the
[1:54:38] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:54:41] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:54:44] Glorious Liberty of the children of God

[2:12:23] else can compare with that and I can
[2:12:25] just see them their heads kind of turn
[2:12:27] sideways and the wings tip back talking

[2:13:17] promise theologians can make up all
[2:13:19] kinds of things you can make up all all
[2:13:21] kind you can make yourself something
[2:13:23] when you're nothing but when God comes

[2:16:22] are I'm only the one that's near when he

[2:17:02] second pull and the visions and amen the
[2:17:06] manifestations and the Glorious things
[2:17:08] that took place it was a wonderful thing
[2:17:11] people drove from all over the world
[2:17:14] they would come across the seas and
[2:17:16] bring their babies they they Kings would
[2:17:19] call and say would you come come and
[2:17:21] pray amen they would they would call

[2:17:33] pounds with is there a way that you can
[2:17:35] come amen prophet of God would you come
[2:17:39] oh the prophet he was on the he was on
[2:17:41] the platform night after night giving
[2:17:43] himself year after year until he was
[2:17:46] wore out until he had to come off the
[2:17:49] field for a while he was so weary in his
[2:17:52] mind and his body the people were
[2:17:54] pulling on that Son of God with that
[2:17:56] first pull and that second pull can you
[2:17:59] say Amen but it's not God's design it's
[2:18:02] not God's desire to put all of his power
[2:18:05] in a
[2:18:06] prophet the prophet was there to call
[2:18:10] some sons of
[2:18:12] [Applause]
[2:18:17] God can you say amen amen
[2:18:21] those visitation of angels amen amen
[2:18:24] bringing the pro Divine Revelations and
[2:18:26] all the Visions but when God took him to
[2:18:29] mount
[2:18:30] Sunset you were
[2:18:39] included when God took him to mount
[2:18:43] Sunset he represented
[2:18:49] you you see I don't believe
[2:18:51] it I don't believe that was that all
[2:18:54] that was just for brother
[2:18:56] Bram 1965 he said a prophet's a
[2:19:00] reflector how many knows that the
[2:19:03] reflector doesn't reflect itself the
[2:19:05] reflector is not the
[2:19:07] reflection there has to be something to
[2:19:10] strike the reflector to make it reflect
[2:19:13] so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God
[2:19:17] that cannot reflect nothing at all but
[2:19:21] he is in direct line with that
[2:19:24] reflection God to reflect the image of
[2:19:28] Christ the
[2:19:30] word nothing else can do
[2:19:34] it I said nothing else can do it it took
[2:19:38] a prophet to reflect what God was doing
[2:19:44] here on the
[2:19:46] earth amen he says now that's the reason
[2:19:50] the Prophet had to eat the book that's
[2:19:52] the reason he had to eat the scroll he
[2:19:54] had to reflect the word for that age and
[2:19:57] then he asked you got
[2:19:59] it well praise the Lord but then he
[2:20:03] doesn't stop there he doesn't stop there
[2:20:06] amen he says the Bride is a reflector
[2:20:08] too once the reflection of the word from
[2:20:13] the prophet to that age then that church
[2:20:17] becomes a reflection
[2:20:22] am well somebody ought to be shouting
[2:20:25] [Applause]
[2:20:26] yes amen he says the word was made flesh
[2:20:30] and dwelt Among Us it's the word
[2:20:32] reflecting sparking off the age that
[2:20:34] you're living in that's what he was
[2:20:36] that's what Moses was that's what Jacob
[2:20:38] was that's what the rest of them was
[2:20:40] amen sparking off that word of God the
[2:20:42] reflector of God that was reflecting
[2:20:44] himself and come to that perfect image
[2:20:46] of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece
[2:20:50] was struck that he might take the rest
[2:20:52] of them for a bride that he's been
[2:20:54] reflecting him Moses was in him Joshua
[2:20:57] was in him and if you are in him you was
[2:21:00] in him before the foundation of the
[2:21:03] world and the family of God you suffered
[2:21:06] with him you died with him you went to
[2:21:09] the cross with him and you were raised
[2:21:12] with him and now you are still with
[2:21:16] [Applause]
[2:21:19] him sitting in Heavenly places
[2:21:21] reflecting the message of the age to the
[2:21:23] world the light of the
[2:21:24] world what is it it's the redeemed body
[2:21:28] of
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:33] God
[2:21:35] reflecting the
[2:21:38] headship of the
[2:21:42] word we're fixing to have a prayer
[2:21:45] line we don't want no one coming up
[2:21:47] through this prayer line amen ing some
[2:21:51] kind of a magic from these
[2:21:54] preachers we're going to be here in
[2:21:56] agreement with you but you are

[2:22:43] experience that that body had in Mount
[2:22:48] Transfiguration praise the Lord
[2:22:53] now the prophecy was as it
[2:22:56] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[2:23:01] in the
[2:23:02] revealing of the son of
[2:23:04] man the son of man must
[2:23:09] come in a
[2:23:11] body once
[2:23:13] again it's
[2:23:15] easy to say the son of man was revealed
[2:23:18] through the first and second pull
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:23] we're thankful for the Messiah
[2:23:24] signs but it was the third pool that the
[2:23:28] word came in effect to the
[2:23:32] sons now brother Brandon would ask the
[2:23:36] question he say where is the government
[2:23:38] going to be

[2:23:43] government upon his shoulders that's

[2:29:07] brother brandham taught adoption folks
[2:29:09] and he taught adoption for a
[2:29:11] reason to separate you from those
[2:29:14] Pentecostal shocks to show you who you
[2:29:19] are
[2:29:26] in a shame 1965 brother Ram says I went
[2:29:28] up there the first on the church the
[2:29:30] first church age and there the Holy
[2:29:32] Spirit revealed it you got it right here
[2:29:34] in your church ages I guess the books
[2:29:36] will be out pretty soon now full detail
[2:29:38] of it it showed that Jesus was judge
[2:29:42] there's a white wig that they use to
[2:29:44] wear put a wig on and and and and wear
[2:29:47] as a judge England still does it when
[2:29:49] you got the supreme authority and then
[2:29:51] turn the picture in this uh in this turn
[2:29:54] sideways in this picture and and he has
[2:29:56] black hair and you can see it in his in
[2:29:58] the side of his beard and his white wig
[2:30:01] on I mean he's looking at a black and
[2:30:02] white picture and and is is the last of
[2:30:05] the authority he's the supreme authority
[2:30:08] even God said so himself this is my
[2:30:13] beloved Son hear ye him there he is with
[2:30:18] them Angels the
[2:30:23] passage which was the seven the breaking
[2:30:25] of the Seven Seals that revealed the
[2:30:26] serpent seed and all these other things
[2:30:28] and it shows that it is his very
[2:30:32] covering his supreme authority he is
[2:30:35] supreme he is wigged or covered well can
[2:30:39] I hear a great big amen he was wigged
[2:30:42] crowned by the Angels
[2:30:52] did you know that the angel of the Lord
[2:30:53] follows this
[2:31:00] message did you know that when a little
[2:31:04] a young man amen kneels down in prayer
[2:31:08] under this anointing of this day that
[2:31:11] the
[2:31:12] angels are right there for you well
[2:31:15] praise the
[2:31:18] Lord I I I feel feel good about right
[2:31:20] now amen Hebrews 1:13 it says but to
[2:31:23] which of the Angels said he at any time
[2:31:26] sit on my right hand until I make thine
[2:31:28] enemies thy footstool are they not all
[2:31:32] ministering Spirits sent forth to
[2:31:36] minister for not to for them who shall
[2:31:41] be hirs of
[2:31:47] Salvation you mean I ain't going to get
[2:31:49] a standing ovation for
[2:31:52] that the
[2:31:54] angels are sent to
[2:31:57] minister for somebody say
[2:32:00] for there's one thing to minister
[2:32:04] to there's one thing to give to there's
[2:32:08] another thing for you to be in command
[2:32:10] and tell me to go do something for
[2:32:14] [Applause]
[2:32:17] you one thing to say Amen I I need your
[2:32:20] help and I minister to you it's another
[2:32:24] thing to stand with the message of the
[2:32:26] hour under the token of the
[2:32:32] [Applause]
[2:32:33] [Music]
[2:32:35] word I I just don't believe that kind of
[2:32:37] authority well that's the reason why

[2:32:42] at you've got your old Pentecostal
[2:32:45] ideology and you're sitting in a message
[2:32:48] Church and that's the reason why you're
[2:32:51] trying to look for something else to get
[2:32:53] your faith to
[2:32:55] going the seventh Angels message was to
[2:33:00] restore the perfect word with the
[2:33:03] perfect

[3:01:39] Nye even in thine
[3:01:42] mouth and in thine
[3:01:45] heart the word of faith
[3:01:48] Faith which we
[3:01:52] preach Mark
[3:01:54] 1123 for verily I say unto you that
[3:01:57] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[3:02:00] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[3:02:02] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[3:02:04] but shall believe that those things
[3:02:06] which Heath said shall come to pass he
[3:02:09] shall have
[3:02:13] whatsoever he said
