[2:14] try not to hold you so long this this
[2:16] sunday
[2:17] amen the lord's good to us so isn't
[2:20] he let's read first samuel 14 24 and the
[2:24] men of israel were distressed that day
[2:27] for saul had endured the people saying
[2:29] cursed be the man
[2:31] that eateth any food until evening
[2:35] i may be avenged on mine enemies
[2:40] so none of the people tasted
[2:43] any food let's bow our heads together
[2:45] for a word of prayer heavenly father
[2:47] we're so grateful to be in your house
[2:48] again
[2:49] so thankful to be one of your chosen few
[2:52] lord that are standing here not by our
[2:55] own efforts today but because you chose
[2:57] us before the foundation of the world
[2:59] we're thankful for that lord and we pray
[3:01] that you would just move in our midst or
[3:04] move me out of the way speak those
[3:05] things that you would have spoken
[3:07] lord and whatever i would say myself and
[3:11] my own human ability or to help me to
[3:13] keep that quiet lord and may you speak
[3:15] tonight because i know that only you can
[3:18] make a difference in the lives of the
[3:19] people i pray bless each and every one
[3:21] that came out tonight each one that's
[3:23] watching at home i pray that you just
[3:25] bless them abundantly we pray in jesus
[3:28] name
[3:29] amen god bless you you can be seated
[3:31] this evening
[3:36] i appreciate that song the king is
[3:39] coming because
[3:41] the problem with saul
[3:44] and the children of israel doing what
[3:45] they did and rejecting
[3:48] the holy spirit and rejecting samuel the
[3:50] leadership of samuel
[3:52] they were rejecting god and his plan
[3:55] there was a king coming yes
[3:58] and they actually uh they actually were
[4:01] trying to set up a kingdom ahead of time
[4:05] when there was one coming and that's the
[4:07] true uh what's true of every
[4:09] denomination of every time there's a
[4:12] a movement that moves what it does is
[4:15] like sarah it sees that maybe things
[4:17] aren't what they're supposed to be or
[4:19] maybe what they think they shouldn't be
[4:21] and so they get in a hurry and anytime
[4:23] you get in a hurry you get in god's way
[4:26] and so the people got in a hurry and
[4:28] said we need a king they did need a king
[4:30] but they didn't need saul
[4:32] they needed david yes we do need a king
[4:35] today
[4:36] but we don't need assault we don't need
[4:38] a denomination we don't need a man we
[4:41] don't need somebody up in up in some
[4:43] city somewhere telling us what to do
[4:45] that's not what we need we need the king
[4:47] yes and the king is coming yes
[4:50] the bible says he's coming and and we
[4:53] find there's a parallel to that if you
[4:55] look in in daniel chapter 7 that there's
[4:57] a parallel to this that before the
[5:00] ancient of days could sit in judgment on
[5:02] the throne that the four beasts had to
[5:04] have their time
[5:05] there had to be a time the gentile
[5:08] kingdoms had to have their time the
[5:10] church ages had to have its time before
[5:12] the king the son of david could reign in
[5:15] the millennium and and so the gentile
[5:17] times had to come and so daniel 7 17
[5:20] says these great beasts which are four
[5:22] are four kings which shall arise out of
[5:24] the earth but the saints of the most
[5:26] high shall take the kingdom this is
[5:28] going to happen
[5:30] there's a king coming yes there's a
[5:32] kingdom coming
[5:34] you're going to reign one of these days
[5:35] as kings and priests but right now don't
[5:38] get ahead of god
[5:40] and try to do it by human effort because
[5:42] you'll mess up god's plan right
[5:44] the saints of the most high shall take
[5:46] the kingdom and possess the kingdom
[5:49] forever even forever and ever and he
[5:51] goes on to describe those beasts and
[5:53] that fourth beast and how that it would
[5:55] come and
[5:56] and that roman system and he and then in
[5:58] verse 26 he said but the judgment shall
[6:00] fit and they shall take away his
[6:02] dominion
[6:03] oh i love this
[6:05] oh i'm looking forward to this i believe
[6:07] it's happening right now and we're
[6:09] seeing the beginning of it but there's a
[6:11] kingdom coming and the judgment shall
[6:13] say they shall take away his dominion to
[6:16] consume and to destroy it unto the end
[6:18] they shall take it away
[6:20] who's going to take it away not a single
[6:22] person
[6:23] not but but the king the people of the
[6:25] kingdom
[6:26] and the kingdom and dominion and the
[6:28] greatness of the kingdom under the whole
[6:30] heaven shall be given to the people of
[6:33] the saints of the most high whose
[6:35] kingdom is an everlasting kingdom
[6:38] and who and all dominion shall serve and
[6:41] obey him
[6:43] now who's to him that we're talking
[6:44] about here go to the new testament
[6:46] philippians chapter 2 and verse 10 that
[6:48] at the name of jesus
[6:51] every knee should bow
[6:53] there's a king coming church we don't
[6:55] need to lose sight of that and begin to
[6:57] get in a hurry by the allen and begin to
[6:59] begin to try to change the message or
[7:02] change the scriptures to fit our own
[7:04] ideology there's a king coming don't
[7:06] lose heart
[7:07] don't give up don't give up hope because
[7:09] there's a king coming down the road and
[7:12] that king at that name of that king of
[7:15] jesus every knee shall bow of things in
[7:17] heaven and things in earth and things
[7:19] under the earth and every tongue should
[7:21] confess that jesus christ is lord to the
[7:24] glory of god the father aren't you glad
[7:26] you know the king today
[7:28] you see saul attempted to bring that by
[7:31] force the people of of israel attempted
[7:33] to bring that by force when they should
[7:35] have been watching and saw under his
[7:37] birth path you remember was to be a
[7:39] protector of that king and even down in
[7:42] the millennium you find that the tribe
[7:44] of benjamin is a protector of the king
[7:46] but now
[7:48] saul should have been a protector of
[7:49] david's rights yes
[7:53] are you hearing me now he should have
[7:55] been fighting to protect david's rights
[7:57] but he actually ended up fighting
[7:59] against david yes
[8:02] and we see the benjaminite coming out in
[8:04] him that he began to raven like
[8:06] a wolf now
[8:08] again denominations whether in or out of
[8:10] the message try to bring about a
[8:11] millennial reign by force
[8:13] through some important man
[8:15] somewhere or some sometimes even through
[8:18] a local pastor to try to set the kingdom
[8:21] into into motion but i'll tell you this
[8:23] there will always be a mixed multitude
[8:25] as long as we're here
[8:26] there will always be tares and wheat as
[8:28] long as we're here there will always be
[8:31] three kinds of believers as long as
[8:32] we're here and we don't like to hear
[8:34] that but there will always be good and
[8:36] bad in the church as long as we're here
[8:38] we'll be dealing with this old flesh as
[8:39] long as we're here and so as long as we
[8:42] do that we don't set a kingdom by force
[8:46] are you with me now
[8:47] so now and but this is what happens is
[8:50] and i just want to this is kind of
[8:52] building up to what i want to say
[8:54] tonight but but what saul had done is
[8:56] he'd gotten a messiah complex
[8:59] that he thought he was the only one that
[9:01] could help the people
[9:03] listen if i'm the only one that can help
[9:05] the people god's not doing very good
[9:09] probably his last hope he's not doing
[9:11] very good
[9:12] but there's got to be somebody else out
[9:14] there that can help him as well
[9:16] i believe there's people that are i'm
[9:18] called to and people that are called to
[9:20] listen
[9:20] to my preaching or god wouldn't have
[9:22] called me to preach but at the same time
[9:24] i'm not the only one that can help you
[9:26] there's a five-fold ministry not just
[9:27] one
[9:28] right there's a five-fold ministry and
[9:31] and so you don't just listen to your
[9:32] pastor although i'd appreciate it if you
[9:34] did listen to your pastor when your
[9:36] pastor is preaching but but there's
[9:38] other men that can help you there's men
[9:40] sitting right here in the church that
[9:41] can help you we don't want to get a
[9:43] messiah complex where we feel like we're
[9:45] the only one that can do that god's got
[9:48] people everywhere
[9:49] that they can help one another and if
[9:51] god forbids i would die in a car wreck
[9:53] tonight god would raise up another man
[9:55] to stand in this pulpit and preach the
[9:57] word he already knew it would happen
[9:58] before it ever takes place
[10:01] right so
[10:02] saul began to feel like the people
[10:03] didn't matter
[10:05] like it didn't matter what the deacon
[10:07] said or the trustee said or what the
[10:09] warriors did talk he would just take
[10:11] credit for it
[10:13] right brother branham said that on the
[10:14] rejected king saul would take credit for
[10:16] what jonathan did but notice how
[10:18] different different david was david
[10:20] inspired other mighty men to act
[10:23] and that's the kind of leaders that we
[10:24] want to be don't you want to be that
[10:26] kind of a leader in your home that kind
[10:28] of a leader in your community not that
[10:30] you would be it somebody who would lord
[10:32] be a lord over god's heritage but you'd
[10:34] be someone who who inspires other people
[10:37] to act by your own life and by the way
[10:39] that you live and so david by taking
[10:41] down goliath inspires mighty men to go
[10:44] down and take other giants down
[10:47] right but saul's always taking credit
[10:48] for what other men did
[10:53] so you see the difference
[10:55] those spirits don't die they still live
[10:57] on today
[10:59] so mighty men under saul had to sneak
[11:01] around to do anything for god
[11:03] and then if they did do something saul
[11:05] would take credit for it
[11:07] you'll find that
[11:08] men of god sometimes get this messiah
[11:10] complex elijah had it
[11:12] at the cave when he said lord i'm the
[11:14] only one left
[11:16] and the still small voice spoke to him
[11:18] and he walked out there and he said lord
[11:20] you don't know what's happened but i'm
[11:22] going to tell you god already knew what
[11:23] happened
[11:24] and it's interesting that god never he
[11:27] never responded to elijah's complaint
[11:31] right
[11:32] he just goes and he says now i want you
[11:33] to do this i want you to do that your
[11:35] ministry is not over
[11:36] he said and then i want to tell you this
[11:38] he said there are 7
[11:41] amen not about their need of baal
[11:45] you're not the only one
[11:46] i've got others you don't even know
[11:48] about
[11:50] so
[11:51] but to saul everything in israel become
[11:54] about saul and what he could do and it
[11:56] gives him gave him a warped view of his
[11:58] own importance remember samuel told him
[12:00] when you were little in your own sight
[12:02] god could work through you but now
[12:04] you're important but really he was only
[12:06] a placeholder until the real king came
[12:10] and so now
[12:12] that's one of the great things brother
[12:13] branham said that man does when he tries
[12:15] to look he said because he looks like
[12:17] cain looked through the glasses he
[12:19] looked at personal achievement
[12:22] cain thought now if i can get abel out
[12:24] of the way then i'm the only one
[12:26] he said see there the other fellow's out
[12:28] of the way he said that's what man has
[12:29] tried to do down through the years is
[12:31] try to get the other fellow out of the
[12:33] way god forbid that that spirit would be
[12:35] around us we don't want to get the other
[12:37] man out of the way we want to promote
[12:38] the other man because the better the
[12:41] other man does the better i do
[12:43] right he said that's what man was trying
[12:45] to do down through the years trying to
[12:46] get the other fellow out of the way when
[12:48] he ought to be trying to bring the other
[12:49] fellow in the way with him and be a
[12:52] brother you see instead of trying to say
[12:54] oh that little group just raked them out
[12:56] and this over here oh well they're this
[12:58] or that we shouldn't do that he said we
[13:01] should be trying to bring the whole
[13:02] thing to one solid picture and that is
[13:05] jesus christ can you say amen to that
[13:07] tonight
[13:08] i'm trying to hurry through this so i
[13:09] don't hold you real long tonight so you
[13:11] just bear with me if i move a little
[13:12] fast go back and listen to it later
[13:15] let's look at saul and his methods
[13:17] and as we begin to look at this in first
[13:19] samuel chapter 13
[13:21] and 14 we find the philistines had
[13:24] control such control that they actually
[13:26] had sword control
[13:28] or sword if you live in oklahoma they
[13:30] had sword control over the people they
[13:33] like gun control would be today they
[13:35] didn't let them make swords
[13:37] because they tried to keep the weapons
[13:39] out of the hands of the people
[13:40] and so in first daniel 13 21 it tells us
[13:44] though that the children of israel had
[13:46] filed for the maddox and for the
[13:47] cultures and for the forks and for the
[13:49] axes and to sharpen the goats i've
[13:51] always loved that scripture because who
[13:53] would have thought the philistines would
[13:55] have never thought that an ox goat would
[13:57] be used by shamgar to defeat so they
[14:00] left a file there to sharpen the goats
[14:02] and god would use that amen what's in
[14:05] your hand use that yes
[14:07] hallelujah i don't have much use what
[14:10] you've got yes sir
[14:12] and so they left the file to sharpen the
[14:13] ghost but the point is there was no
[14:15] there was no sword nor spear in first
[14:17] samuel 13 22 in the day of battle there
[14:20] was neither sword nor spear found in the
[14:21] hand of any of the people that was with
[14:23] saul and jonathan but with saul and with
[14:25] jonathan his son
[14:27] was there found i want to look at
[14:29] jonathan for a moment because he appears
[14:31] suddenly in the narrative
[14:33] and he has saw a son but he's actually a
[14:35] greater warrior than saul
[14:37] and jonathan never loses his place
[14:42] i want you to watch jonathan's life
[14:43] you'll look at he never loses his place
[14:46] he knows that he's not going to be king
[14:50] jonathan knows it saul refuses to
[14:52] believe it but jonathan knows it
[14:54] and yet he's a much better man in many
[14:57] ways than saul was
[14:59] and yet it's a tragic story because he
[15:02] remains with his father
[15:04] and and really nothing else he could do
[15:06] but he remains with him and he's slain
[15:09] with saul
[15:10] because he has identified with his
[15:12] kingdom and every threat to david had to
[15:14] be taken out of the way because david
[15:16] was god's choice now look david didn't
[15:18] do it now remember david does not set
[15:20] himself up to be king by natural means
[15:24] but god does it yes
[15:26] right and that ought to be the way any
[15:28] uh any man of god when you take a
[15:30] position or or in the church for that
[15:33] matter whether it's a song leader or
[15:35] trustee or whatever you you don't go
[15:37] cutting other people down right or
[15:40] deacon i don't know that that's ever
[15:41] happened here god forbid that it would
[15:43] i'm not preaching at you i'm just saying
[15:45] this as a principle you don't cut other
[15:47] people down to elevate yourself
[15:50] that's saul's method but not david's
[15:54] so now
[15:55] he but jonathan has identified with this
[15:57] kingdom so he ends up dying with saul
[16:00] we'll talk a little bit more about that
[16:02] at the end but when you identify
[16:04] yourself with a backslidden ministry if
[16:06] we can say it that way or denominational
[16:08] ministry
[16:09] it's not your job to remove it
[16:12] or to cut it down simply to leave it
[16:16] brown said don't put your confidence in
[16:18] a man
[16:19] when that man leaves the word of god you
[16:21] leave the man
[16:23] he said brother ben if you preach that
[16:24] people will leave well if i leave the
[16:26] word they'll leave
[16:29] and if they leave for some other reason
[16:30] then that's between them and god
[16:33] right but but if i don't want to leave
[16:35] the word i want to stay with god god is
[16:37] the word and so but if i do leave the
[16:39] word and i'm human if i left the word
[16:42] and and stubbornly stubbornly state off
[16:45] of the path of the word then the people
[16:47] ought to leave me
[16:49] because when i leave the word i leave
[16:50] god and that's what
[16:51] the conundrum that jonathan was in being
[16:54] identified with that system he actually
[16:57] he actually died with it first samuel 14
[16:59] and 1
[17:00] let's look at this now it came to pass
[17:02] upon a day that jonathan the son of saul
[17:04] said unto the young man that bear his
[17:05] armor come let us go over to the
[17:07] philistines garrison that is on the
[17:09] other side but he told not his father
[17:13] now remember last time we preached about
[17:14] ruling by fear
[17:16] ruling by fear always results in
[17:19] deception yeah
[17:21] so jonathan says
[17:23] you know what i i've been in a meeting
[17:25] in a while
[17:26] i haven't seen any devils die in a while
[17:29] so i think it's about time we killed
[17:31] some devils
[17:33] and in first samuel 14 2 saul terried in
[17:35] the uttermost parts of gabia under a
[17:38] pomegranate tree which is in migrant and
[17:40] the people that were with him were about
[17:41] 600 men
[17:43] so notice here was saul
[17:45] here was saul tearing under a tree and
[17:48] jonathan gets to looking at his sword
[17:49] because remember only jonathan and saul
[17:51] had a sword and jonathan begins to look
[17:54] at his sword and said there's got to be
[17:56] something else i can do with this
[17:59] all right
[18:00] other than sit under a tree
[18:02] and gripe about what's coming if i have
[18:04] a sword there must be a reason
[18:07] there must be something listen to me
[18:08] every man ought to get his sword every
[18:10] woman ought to get her sword every one
[18:12] of you every man woman boy and girl
[18:14] ought to get their sword and do
[18:15] something with it
[18:17] and that's what jonathan did he said i
[18:18] got a sword might as well use it
[18:20] the other fellows don't have swords but
[18:22] they don't keep me back
[18:24] right so but he had to sneak out to do
[18:26] it because the pastor wouldn't have let
[18:28] him that's a shame isn't it
[18:31] yes
[18:33] i don't say that i don't say that again
[18:36] you stay jonathan stayed in his
[18:39] in his calling in doing that
[18:41] jonathan was a warrior so he stayed in
[18:44] his calling his warrior didn't try to be
[18:45] king
[18:46] he didn't try to take his sword and cut
[18:48] saul's head off with it
[18:50] right or david's for that matter he
[18:52] didn't try to play politics he went out
[18:55] to fight
[18:56] oh and that's what we ought to do is go
[18:58] out to fight right
[19:00] amen now
[19:01] he he told not his father and and saw
[19:04] terry then under the tree in a higher
[19:05] the son of a tub ichabod's brother the
[19:08] son of phinehas the son of eli
[19:10] the lord's priest and shiloh wearing an
[19:12] ephod
[19:13] and the people knew not that jonathan
[19:14] was gone now
[19:15] notice where saul is
[19:18] and he's in gibeah saul never takes
[19:20] jerusalem david does that
[19:22] later but now god's not speaking to saul
[19:25] i believe one of the reasons god's not
[19:27] speaking to saul is he's remaining in
[19:30] the mentality that this priest is
[19:31] somehow going to help him
[19:33] this priest come from a backslidden
[19:35] family a priest if you go back and run
[19:37] his lineage back he was uh the bible
[19:40] tells us he's the brother of ichabod
[19:41] ichabod means the lord is the glory is
[19:43] departed it was the time when the when
[19:45] the ark of the covenant was taken down
[19:47] into the philistine lands and because of
[19:49] the way that hoffney infinite house
[19:51] eli's sons were acting
[19:53] right and so this is the grandson and
[19:55] he's there in the uh there with them in
[19:57] in shiloh and saul thinks well surely
[20:00] the lord will speak because he's a
[20:01] priest but he doesn't recognize that god
[20:03] that god has changed over he's not
[20:06] working in that old denomination anymore
[20:08] but he's actually working through the
[20:10] prophet samuel yes
[20:13] right and but instead of waiting on the
[20:14] prophet samuel we're trying to find out
[20:16] what samuel had to say about it he
[20:18] actually goes and consults this
[20:20] backslidden priest now verse 6 jonathan
[20:23] said to the young man that bear his
[20:25] armor come let us go over into the
[20:27] garrison of these uncircumcised
[20:30] it may be that the lord will work for us
[20:33] oh my for there is no restraint to the
[20:36] lord
[20:37] to save by many
[20:39] or by few
[20:41] sure
[20:42] amen
[20:44] god don't need big numbers to save
[20:46] people he don't need big numbers to have
[20:49] church
[20:51] you don't need big numbers to feel the
[20:52] presence of god you don't need big
[20:54] numbers to do the things that we need to
[20:56] do and and and have a the the power of
[20:59] god among us you don't need that you
[21:01] don't need big numbers to heal but what
[21:03] is it
[21:04] he actually
[21:05] he whatever number you are he with him
[21:08] is a majority
[21:10] is that right so he said there's no
[21:12] restraint to the lord god's not
[21:13] restrained because there's less there's
[21:15] only two of us
[21:17] amen why not
[21:19] that's what i would say tonight why not
[21:20] go out and fight yes why not stand for
[21:23] the gospel why not believe the message
[21:25] of the hour why not believe that god
[21:27] still does miracles why not believe god
[21:30] will save your children why not come to
[21:32] church happy yeah
[21:34] why not come with a smile on your face
[21:36] why not live for god why not give it
[21:38] everything you've got instead of coming
[21:39] in backslidden and cold sitting under a
[21:41] tree somewhere pick up your sword yes i
[21:44] might as well use it you've got one you
[21:46] might as well use it
[21:48] why not say well there's only a few of
[21:50] us i'll just sit back tonight why not
[21:52] believe god
[21:54] are you with me tonight yeah why not
[21:57] believe god
[21:58] and jonathan said to the young man he
[22:01] said there's no restraint it's no
[22:02] restraint that there's only two of us
[22:04] but god is able with god we have a
[22:07] majority so now jesus brother randall
[22:09] said counts character not members she
[22:11] said you know that he counts characters
[22:14] he got a few here doesn't he he counts
[22:16] characters god has always tried to get
[22:18] one man in his hand
[22:20] or can you say tonight i'll be that one
[22:22] man there may not be a bunch of people
[22:24] sitting around me tonight it may not be
[22:26] a huge crowd on a wednesday night but
[22:28] lord i know you don't count men you
[22:30] count characters yes he always tried to
[22:33] get one man in his hand he said that's
[22:34] all he needs is one man and he'll do his
[22:37] work through the years
[22:39] amen
[22:41] well i believe his work is continuing
[22:42] today
[22:44] verse 7 and his armor bearer said unto
[22:46] him i love the attitude of the armor
[22:47] bearer
[22:49] he said do all that is in
[22:52] thine heart
[22:54] turn thee behold i am with thee
[22:57] according to thy heart it wasn't his
[22:59] idea to have the meeting or to go to the
[23:01] meeting but he said i'm with you
[23:04] i hope you're hearing me now
[23:06] i'm with you i thought of brother
[23:07] neville when i thought of this because
[23:09] brother neville was brother brandon's
[23:10] right-hand man behind in the shadows at
[23:13] jeffersonville and he would always
[23:15] always step aside for brother branham to
[23:17] come in and always support him even
[23:18] though he didn't have the gift of a
[23:20] prophet and i can imagine it must have
[23:22] hurt his feelings sometimes when the
[23:24] crowds would come in when brother
[23:25] branham was there
[23:26] and you can imagine what it would be
[23:27] like as a pastor when everybody calls
[23:29] and and
[23:31] you know we've got churches today like
[23:32] that you know his brother so and so
[23:33] preaching and sometimes they want to
[23:35] know what night so and so preaching so
[23:37] that they can come
[23:38] because if they're not preaching they
[23:39] might as well just stay at home it
[23:41] doesn't matter nothing nothing you'd be
[23:42] surprised what god can do
[23:44] yes
[23:46] you'd be surprised what god can do if
[23:47] you give him half a chance
[23:49] but brother neville just had a you know
[23:51] just a regular ministry just like mine
[23:53] or any other pastors would be and i
[23:56] thought about him and brother brown said
[23:57] this about him and christ is the mystery
[23:58] of god revealed he said you people here
[24:01] he said hold him up
[24:02] like joshua and caleb held up the hands
[24:04] of moses as he's bringing the word he
[24:07] said but not tonight's not my night to
[24:09] preach tonight's not my night to sing
[24:10] tonight's not my night to i'll just sit
[24:12] back and wait let somebody make me happy
[24:14] no hold up the hands of the minister
[24:17] hold up the hands of the pastor you may
[24:19] not be the one but you can be like the
[24:21] armored bearer and says i'm with you
[24:23] do what's in your heart
[24:25] yes hey man hold up his hands as he's
[24:27] bringing the word how do you do that you
[24:29] know how you keep my hands up you know
[24:31] how you keep my spirits up you know how
[24:32] you keep me from faltering you know how
[24:34] you keep these other brothers from
[24:35] faltering by saying amen
[24:37] so be it sick and boy that's how you
[24:39] keep my hands up
[24:42] right hold his hands there you say i
[24:43] don't feel like it but you're not doing
[24:45] it for yourself
[24:47] you're doing it for the others you're
[24:49] holding their hands up
[24:50] as long as moses hands were up
[24:53] the people had victory
[24:55] amen
[24:56] brother branham said this he said we can
[24:57] make ourselves nothing
[24:59] you can't make bishops and prophets and
[25:01] so forth you can't manufacture it it's
[25:03] got to be born in you
[25:06] got to be the spirit of god
[25:07] predestinated from the foundation of the
[25:09] world god said in the church
[25:12] god did what he did and when we try to
[25:14] impersonate we lose our influence how
[25:17] many times have i seen that when you try
[25:19] to be some other preacher you lose your
[25:20] influence he said it's like a ball game
[25:23] somebody at a football game somebody
[25:24] gets the ball and every one of his own
[25:26] players trying to take the ball right
[25:27] away from him he said you can't win the
[25:29] game
[25:30] be a guard
[25:32] oh can we could we grab ahold of this
[25:34] tonight the guard
[25:36] guard the ball i'll try to take it away
[25:38] from the next man glory to god if he can
[25:40] do it over here on this corner god bless
[25:42] him yes
[25:43] amen you say bye brother ben there will
[25:45] be a church on every corner my hell
[25:47] wouldn't that be wonderful
[25:50] wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a
[25:51] church or this message on every corner
[25:53] and there would be enough people for
[25:54] form to go to go to them amen
[25:57] i don't i don't have any interest in
[25:58] swapping people out but if there's
[26:00] enough people to keep a church going on
[26:02] every corner so be it
[26:05] amen he said i'm a oneness i can do it
[26:07] i'm a trinitarian i can do it or you say
[26:09] he ain't got no business doing that
[26:11] you're knocking the ball out of your own
[26:12] player's hands
[26:14] let's guard the ball this is the ball
[26:17] the holy spirit is trying to pack it
[26:20] it'll condemn communism it'll condemn
[26:22] sin it'll condem unrighteousness it will
[26:24] manifest and glorify jesus christ and
[26:26] bring his person into the midst of the
[26:29] people don't you know that's what we
[26:30] need tonight
[26:31] we need his person his presence in the
[26:34] midst of the people we need him to have
[26:35] the preeminence how are we going to get
[26:37] there he said it it'll it's the ball
[26:39] this is the ball and the holy spirit is
[26:41] packing the ball let's get behind it
[26:46] amen
[26:48] excuse me tonight i'm preaching about
[26:50] eating i get stirred up
[26:52] i haven't even got to my sermon yet
[26:57] for samuel 14 13 jonathan climbed up on
[27:00] his hands and upon his feet and his
[27:01] armor bearer
[27:02] after him they fell before jonathan as
[27:04] armor bearers slew after him i like it
[27:06] he wasn't the first one to go but he
[27:07] went
[27:08] he got some devils too
[27:10] and that first slaughter which jonathan
[27:12] and his armor bear made was about 20 men
[27:14] within as it were a half acre of land
[27:17] which a yoke of oxen might plow
[27:19] and there was a trembling in the host
[27:22] watch he only killed 20. but look at the
[27:24] effect that it had on the other devils
[27:26] or philistines
[27:28] right
[27:29] there was a trembling in the host
[27:31] in the field among all the people the
[27:34] garrison and the spoilers they also
[27:36] trembled and the earthquake
[27:38] so it was a very great
[27:40] trembling
[27:42] now
[27:43] right now would have been a good time
[27:45] for saul to join in
[27:49] but instead he was trying to figure out
[27:51] who went to the meeting without being
[27:52] authorized by the pastor
[27:56] are you with me tonight
[28:01] my god what are they doing up there
[28:04] at the meeting the whole place is
[28:06] shaking they're making noise man
[28:09] that ain't right
[28:10] sitting here under my tree taking a nap
[28:12] and they're making noise
[28:16] and the earth's trembling and so the
[28:19] watchmen of saul and gabia benjamin
[28:21] looked
[28:21] they got on the internet and they looked
[28:23] at some of the services they said man
[28:25] the multitude's melting away
[28:28] the enemies are beating down on one
[28:29] another
[28:33] you always tell devils because they beat
[28:34] on one another
[28:36] god's people don't do that
[28:40] somebody's beating on somebody i don't
[28:42] care if it's a husband or wife i don't
[28:44] care if it's a pastor in the church
[28:46] i don't care whatever it is somebody's
[28:47] beating on somebody it's inspired by the
[28:49] devil
[28:51] that's right we don't beat down on
[28:52] people
[28:54] huh they now look they were they were
[28:57] beating down on one another and saul
[28:58] said unto the people that were with him
[28:59] number now and see who was gone from us
[29:02] who went up there
[29:04] come on
[29:05] until they begin to look down through
[29:07] the
[29:07] things and say who is it
[29:09] when the camera scanned the crowd this
[29:11] hasn't happened i'm just dramatizing it
[29:13] for you
[29:14] maybe it has i don't know
[29:17] look through the crowd and see who was
[29:18] there
[29:19] who went down to the meeting
[29:22] when they numbered behold jonathan and
[29:23] his armor bearer were not there oh my
[29:27] and miss church go to the meeting and
[29:29] saul said today hi i'll tell you what
[29:31] you could miss church for worse things
[29:33] i want you to beat your post of duty but
[29:35] you can miss church for worse things
[29:36] than to go kill some devils i mean if
[29:38] you're doubt killing some devils god
[29:39] bless you you keep killing them
[29:41] we need less of them
[29:43] and saul said unto
[29:44] bring hither the ark of god for the ark
[29:46] of god was at that time with the
[29:48] children of israel and it came to pass
[29:51] now listen he had the word yes
[29:54] but no dynamics to make it work yeah
[29:56] that's right but jonathan had the
[29:58] dynamics he might as well go do it
[30:03] and the ark of god was with him and it
[30:05] came to pass while saul talked to the
[30:07] priest the old backslidden priest that
[30:09] the noise that was in the host of the
[30:10] philistines went on and increased
[30:14] oh i love it
[30:15] and so why is there noise
[30:18] because jonathan caused some destruction
[30:21] he gotten through to god
[30:23] and saul said to the priest withdraw thy
[30:25] hand
[30:26] he said he finally realized i better go
[30:28] help this boy
[30:30] it's all loves again to gain credit or
[30:33] to get the credit and so saul and all
[30:35] the people that with him assembled
[30:36] themselves they came to the battle
[30:38] behold every man's sword was against his
[30:40] fellow and there was a very great
[30:42] discomfiture moreover the hebrews that
[30:44] were with the philistines before that
[30:46] time now watch this was such a great
[30:48] meeting
[30:49] think about this meeting that they had
[30:51] it was such a great man i want to have
[30:52] one of those kind of meetings in july
[30:54] that even the hebrews even the people
[30:56] that were in the world
[30:58] could look at it and say hey we better
[31:00] go to church
[31:02] we're killing some devils up there yeah
[31:05] the hebrews that were with the
[31:06] philistines before that time which went
[31:08] with up went up with them into the camp
[31:10] from the country round about even they
[31:12] also turned to be with the israelites
[31:14] all the old backs in hebrews that were
[31:16] running around with the philistines
[31:17] turned around why because jonathan took
[31:20] his sword out
[31:22] amen
[31:24] hallelujah when he began to preach they
[31:26] began to realize something was different
[31:27] about this
[31:28] even they also turned to be with the
[31:30] israelites that were with saul and
[31:31] jonathan likewise all the men of israel
[31:33] which had hid themselves and played
[31:35] tapes at home
[31:36] in mount ephraim when they heard that
[31:38] the philistines fled i feel good tonight
[31:42] they hid themselves when they heard that
[31:44] the philistines fled even they followed
[31:46] hard after them in the battle
[31:48] so the lord saved israel that day and
[31:50] the battle passed over unto beth haven
[31:52] what was it something peculiar had
[31:53] happened yes sir
[31:55] amen something different had happened
[31:58] god was moving
[32:00] all right
[32:01] but now we come to a very peculiar part
[32:02] of the story this is where my title
[32:04] comes from
[32:05] let my people eat
[32:07] because as the people were fighting that
[32:09] day
[32:10] they began to grow weary
[32:12] in the battle
[32:14] the men of israel were distressed that
[32:16] day for saul had endured the people
[32:19] saying cursed be the man that's while
[32:21] he's sitting under his tree
[32:23] cursed be the man that eateth any food
[32:26] until evening
[32:28] that i may be avenged
[32:30] on mine enemies
[32:32] so none of the people tasted any food he
[32:35] says that i may be avenged
[32:37] on my enemies that tells you all you
[32:40] need to know about saul
[32:44] how many pastors i would say today
[32:47] and people and i won't just limit to
[32:49] pastors but but in different places
[32:52] that would starve god's people
[32:56] for the sake of their own complexes yes
[33:00] that i may be events on my enemies
[33:07] oh you can't eat nothing
[33:10] now notice
[33:11] you remember
[33:13] when they come over into the land there
[33:14] was something that was promised to them
[33:16] anybody remember what it was
[33:18] said it'd be a land flowing
[33:20] with milk and honey yes
[33:23] right that's a promise
[33:25] the promises of god
[33:27] were that the land would be flowing with
[33:28] milk and honey
[33:30] so that if you went out one day without
[33:32] eating
[33:33] and
[33:34] you got weary
[33:36] that there might be honey on the ground
[33:39] because the land was flown with it it
[33:41] was a promise of god
[33:43] and you might be able to eat some
[33:46] and get your strength back
[33:49] but the people couldn't
[33:50] eat because saul said nobody's going to
[33:53] eat
[33:54] until my bitterness
[33:57] my the cup of my bitterness is full
[34:02] until until i'm avenged on my enemies
[34:07] you said nothing about god's enemies
[34:08] yeah he said my enemies
[34:12] oh my
[34:13] there was honey on the ground they all
[34:15] they the land come to a wood and there
[34:16] was honey upon the ground and when they
[34:18] should have remembered oh it's a land
[34:20] flowing with milk and honey
[34:22] and when the people were coming to the
[34:23] wood behold the honey dropped it was
[34:25] dripping off everywhere
[34:26] but no man put his hand to his mouth
[34:30] for the people feared
[34:32] the oath
[34:34] he's got him so controlled by fear
[34:37] god help us today yes
[34:40] that the people were afraid to enter in
[34:42] yes to the promises of god
[34:46] they were afraid of it because they were
[34:48] they had been walking on ground
[34:50] and it was sticky
[34:52] everywhere they went there was honey
[34:54] imagine what it must have been like
[34:55] their shoes were sticking to the ground
[34:58] but they couldn't eat it
[35:00] and they were starving to death
[35:04] they were starving to death but they
[35:07] couldn't they wouldn't do it because
[35:08] pastor saul said don't you shout
[35:11] yeah
[35:14] don't you go get hands late on you don't
[35:16] go in that prayer line that's
[35:17] pentecostal
[35:20] i'm being just as clear about it as i
[35:22] can be tonight
[35:23] pastor saul said you better not go they
[35:25] don't agree with us
[35:31] the people feared the oath
[35:34] but no god always provides food in due
[35:36] season do you believe that
[35:37] yes
[35:39] elijah was down there one time and
[35:41] it was a famine going to go on and god
[35:43] told him he said go up to the brook
[35:44] cherith he said i'm going to let crows
[35:46] bring you sandwiches
[35:48] bread and meat
[35:50] bring you a ham sandwich or a chicken
[35:52] sandwich or whatever that it was i
[35:54] prefer to think it was chicken
[35:56] myself it would be kind of funny though
[35:58] birds bringing a chicken sandwich but
[36:02] hopefully it wasn't crow
[36:04] but whatever it was it was good
[36:06] it kept him alive
[36:09] and so elijah's up there eating of it
[36:11] and so brother branham was talking about
[36:14] this one time and he said
[36:15] and he said i said he's talking to a
[36:17] person who who had told him he was crazy
[36:20] i said you told me i was crazy because i
[36:22] was shouting
[36:24] oh my i said you said i was excited and
[36:27] it was mental telepathy
[36:29] i said the only thing i know because he
[36:32] asked him he said how did god bring
[36:33] sandwiches to those people
[36:35] how did he bring sandwich to elijah the
[36:37] only thing i know the holy ghost brings
[36:39] it we eat it and get fat and round
[36:43] oh praise god i got message for it
[36:49] he said that's all that makes any
[36:51] difference to me
[36:53] now i may be fattening around in the
[36:54] natural but let me tell you what you you
[36:56] want to be fat and round when it comes
[36:58] to the spiritual

[37:10] it's laying there on the ground let me
[37:12] pick it up and eat it
[37:14] let me eat it he said the only thing i
[37:16] know i don't know where it comes from i
[37:17] don't know how the crows carried the
[37:19] sandwiches i don't know if they use
[37:20] miracle whipper mayonnaise or peanut
[37:22] butter or what they used on the sandwich

[40:01] some people can't shout and i know
[40:02] there's people who shout without having
[40:03] nothing to eat i realize that but the
[40:05] reason we're shouting is because we've
[40:06] been eating yes sir
[40:08] yeah
[40:10] oh my brother said that's the way they
[40:12] say that the holy ghost was for another
[40:14] age he said that's what they think yes
[40:16] it's here
[40:17] he said we've been fine in the air for
[40:19] the last 40 50 years with it seeing
[40:21] things the intellectual people knows
[40:22] nothing about only thing they can do is
[40:24] sit down and just make fun of it he said
[40:26] like a little calf one time come out of
[40:28] a stall they said it was just fatten
[40:29] around i love that he was kicking up his
[40:32] heels and he had a very nice farmer that
[40:35] fed him good and he was all around and
[40:37] full of vitamins
[40:39] and another old lazy farmer
[40:42] over there that had a little cap of the
[40:43] brown calls him a pastor in a couple
[40:45] places
[40:46] a lazy pastor had a little calf also
[40:48] born in the barn that winter when the
[40:50] little fellow hadn't eaten nothing but
[40:51] weeds and when he come out he was so
[40:53] poor he couldn't hardly move
[40:56] and every time the wind would blow and
[40:57] shove him sideways
[41:00] what happened the winds are going to
[41:01] blow church
[41:02] you need to be fat and rounded up
[41:04] spiritually you don't blow over yes
[41:08] this little cat's wandering he's
[41:10] staggering out and he's he's so skinny
[41:12] that when the wind blew he just
[41:13] staggered like that
[41:17] he couldn't take it
[41:19] that's why people get worried
[41:21] they get scared oh russia's coming
[41:23] communism all these other things look at
[41:24] the democrats look at the republicans
[41:26] they get scared
[41:28] what's going to happen look at the riots
[41:29] going on around us people get scared you
[41:31] need to eat some more yes
[41:33] because there it says amen i got a seven
[41:35] course meal that says i am the god that
[41:37] heals all thy diseases i've never seen a
[41:40] seed forsaken or a seed
[41:42] begging bread amen he's still god he's
[41:44] still the same yesterday today and
[41:46] forever
[41:47] and when a man he said it's a little fat
[41:49] calf just kicking up his heels he's
[41:51] seeing this little fat calf kicking up
[41:53] his heels having a great time
[41:55] he said you know he looked at the crack
[41:56] in the fence
[41:57] got to looking on the internet
[41:59] and said such fanaticism
[42:02] he can't really stand up
[42:05] he's criticizing somebody else yes
[42:08] oh god help us today yes sir
[42:12] i don't say we have the most fanatic
[42:14] we don't have any fanaticism as far as i
[42:16] know i don't say we have the most
[42:17] spiritual church
[42:18] but if i can get a little fatter and a
[42:20] little rounder
[42:22] let me do it
[42:24] leave me alone
[42:26] quit peeking through the fence and
[42:28] saying it's fanaticism yeah i just got
[42:30] vitamins
[42:32] he said no wonder he could pick up his
[42:33] heels
[42:35] i wonder sometimes why people can't kick
[42:36] up their heels you know i just i wonder
[42:38] but is it there's no law against being
[42:40] happy in church
[42:46] there is no log is kicking up your heels
[42:48] in church
[42:49] there's nothing that says you have to
[42:50] sit there and look depressed
[42:53] in church it is not a virtue
[42:55] depression is not one of the nine
[42:57] spiritual gifts
[42:59] it's not a virtue and i don't mean to
[43:00] make light of it if you're going through
[43:02] something that i understand that but we
[43:03] have a burden bearer
[43:05] we have a load lifter
[43:07] we got something that can take your
[43:08] pressure take you take it off of you let
[43:10] off the pressure we've got something
[43:12] that can do that tonight
[43:13] we got vitamins so if you just eat amen
[43:17] if you'll just use what we say about
[43:18] horses they were off their feet when
[43:20] they wouldn't eat and they'd get skinny
[43:21] why something was wrong with them but if
[43:23] you could ever get an inoculation of the
[43:24] holy ghost if you could ever get god
[43:26] down on the inside of you you begin to
[43:28] eat again
[43:29] amen he said when a man is filled with
[43:31] the holy ghost there's something in him
[43:33] that's full of god's spiritual vitamin
[43:35] makes him praise god shout and act
[43:36] different because why he's no longer
[43:38] earthbound he's in the heavens sailing
[43:40] around in heavenly places in christ
[43:42] jesus
[43:44] brother branham goes on in that sermon
[43:45] that's countdown in 1964 he goes on to
[43:48] say that we have even more power now
[43:51] yes
[43:52] remember he said because they were
[43:54] shouting 50 years ago 100 years ago now
[43:56] at pentecost but he said we've even got
[43:57] more power now because the bible said
[43:59] matthew 24 28 wheresoever the carcass is
[44:02] there will the eagles be gathered
[44:03] together
[44:04] and then brother branham gets to talking
[44:06] about it in the sea does not air with
[44:07] the shut he said the higher you go the
[44:09] more you can see he said so it's time
[44:11] for eagles of this day to get to flying
[44:12] higher dig into god's promises not live
[44:15] on vulture food that's been killed years
[44:17] ago get out of it
[44:18] politics voting in and voting out saying
[44:20] this side or the other and the holy
[44:22] spirit has no more right of way in the
[44:23] church than nothing no more prayer
[44:25] meetings no more agonizing with god to
[44:27] fulfill his word no more believing that
[44:29] the word is still the same yesterday
[44:30] today and forever relies on half-rotten
[44:32] man-made theology where does he get it
[44:35] out of some man-made sunday school
[44:36] program sheet
[44:37] some educator people in the message want
[44:39] to go back to that i say god forbid yeah
[44:42] we don't need a man-made sunday school
[44:44] program see we need the holy ghost
[44:48] some educator killed for him back in
[44:50] some seminary tell him that the days of
[44:52] miracles has passed there's no such
[44:54] thing as the baptism of the holy ghost
[44:55] all this is nonsense he said you mean to
[44:57] tell me an eagle would eat that he
[44:58] couldn't do it no sir neither will a
[45:00] christian eat on that dead karen from
[45:02] old denominational doctrines and things
[45:04] they want the word of god fresh the
[45:06] promise of the hour god promised rabbits
[45:09] in the days of luther he promised other
[45:10] things in the days of others but now he
[45:12] promised us
[45:14] yes can we say that tonight he promised
[45:16] us
[45:17] he promised us
[45:19] a full square meal
[45:22] you ever went into a place and the food
[45:24] looks so good on the menu and it's a
[45:25] promise yeah right i take that as a
[45:28] promise if you're gonna put that big
[45:30] beautiful hamburger up there on the menu
[45:32] or on the side you know the ones that
[45:33] burger king and and and hearties they
[45:36] look so good and the grease is just
[45:38] dripping off of them you know and it
[45:39] looks so good when you get it it don't
[45:41] look like that does it
[45:43] it don't look like what it does on the
[45:44] picture it's a false promise it's false
[45:46] advertising but when god promised you a
[45:48] full square meal you're going to get all
[45:50] of it
[45:51] amen he said he promised us a full
[45:53] square meal the full seven course menu
[45:55] for all
[45:57] someone say all
[45:59] all the seven seals are open
[46:02] yes argue with brother branham if you
[46:04] want to argue about that yeah and
[46:06] everything is ready amen for everything
[46:09] is ready for the word of god to those
[46:11] who can receive
[46:13] oh do we believe it tonight
[46:16] amen
[46:17] maybe i shouldn't have drank that
[46:18] gatorade before church
[46:23] oh don't you love to eat yes i'm not
[46:25] talking about the natural now i'm
[46:27] talking about the spiritual don't you
[46:28] love to eat he said it's all there
[46:31] a full seven course meal we can pick up
[46:33] any we could have chosen any we didn't
[46:35] have to choose daniel chapter two for
[46:36] the men's bible study we could choose
[46:38] any scripture in the bible and you find
[46:40] something in the message of the hour
[46:41] about it why because this is the opening
[46:44] of the book
[46:46] the book is open the word is open amen
[46:49] and we see christ in every word of it
[46:52] hallelujah
[46:53] amen now
[46:55] but jonathan heard not
[46:57] i hope there's some people that haven't
[46:58] heard the denominational decree not to
[47:00] eat
[47:02] jonathan heard not when his father
[47:04] charged the people the oath
[47:06] amen wherefore he put forth the end of
[47:08] the rod that was in his hand
[47:10] and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his
[47:12] hand to his mouth and his eyes were
[47:15] enlightened yes
[47:17] amen
[47:18] amen he could see
[47:20] hallelujah and then after one of the
[47:22] people and said thy father strictly
[47:23] charged the people they looked at him
[47:25] said hey
[47:27] you can't have that
[47:29] pastor saul said no yeah
[47:34] he said cursed be the man that eateth
[47:36] any food this day and the people we're
[47:38] faint
[47:40] if the people are fainting our hour it's
[47:41] not the fault of this bible it's not the
[47:43] fault of the message it's our fault yes
[47:46] it's preachers
[47:48] we're not feeding the people
[47:51] i said no you can't feed them you're
[47:53] out of order
[47:55] he said but
[47:56] he said my father has troubled the land
[47:58] yes he says see i pray you have my eyes
[48:01] enlightened yes
[48:03] hallelujah because i tasted a little of
[48:05] this honey oh what a seven course me a
[48:08] lot to do to the people of god today
[48:11] that we could say look how my eyes have
[48:13] been enlightened look how my life has
[48:15] changed look how i've moved from one
[48:17] dimension and moving into another look
[48:20] at how i've changed look at my joy look
[48:22] at the piece that i have look at look
[48:24] how i've reacted to it
[48:27] hey man just like daniel and his friends
[48:29] they said let us see like we like to
[48:30] like the law says and then you come back
[48:32] and look and see if we're not fatter
[48:33] than everybody else
[48:35] that's right yes sir
[48:38] amen
[48:39] he said listen how much more
[48:41] it happened that people had eaten freely
[48:44] that's what we ought to
[48:46] we ought to put a sign on the door it
[48:47] says eat freely
[48:50] eat freely
[48:52] not on the fellowship paul in this
[48:53] building
[48:54] eat freely
[48:56] because the people had eaten freely of
[48:57] the spoil of their enemies which they
[48:59] found had there not been that been now a
[49:01] much greater slaughter among the
[49:03] philistines
[49:04] and they smote the philistines that day
[49:06] from mcmaster angelon and the people
[49:08] were very
[49:10] faint
[49:11] if you read on you find the people ate
[49:13] raw meat because they were so hungry
[49:16] they couldn't eat the honey that was
[49:18] provided for them because of pastor
[49:20] saul's decree
[49:22] so they went out
[49:24] to the animals that got killed in the
[49:25] battle
[49:26] and ate it with the blood
[49:28] which was against god's word to do
[49:31] but the brandon said a hungry child will
[49:33] eat from a garbage can
[49:35] the only reason he does
[49:37] is because he's not invited
[49:39] to a clean table yes
[49:43] how many young people have left messaged
[49:45] churches
[49:47] hear me tonight how many young people
[49:49] have left message churches
[49:51] because they were not invited
[49:53] to a clean table
[49:55] and so they go out to the world and they
[49:57] go out to romantic relationships that
[49:59] are against the word of god they go out
[50:01] to worldly pleasures yes
[50:04] because they were not invited to a clean
[50:06] table but i'm here to tell you church
[50:08] and into these young people that are
[50:10] here let's and to us as adults i
[50:13] challenge you let's set a clean table
[50:15] for them
[50:18] amen
[50:19] people that live the word and believe
[50:21] the full seven course meal and preach it
[50:23] yes they're not afraid to keep preaching
[50:26] it no matter what the culture does
[50:29] he said but listen
[50:31] you true believers in christ
[50:33] you true christians that believe in god
[50:35] in the supernatural
[50:37] all the times saul was training this big
[50:39] army
[50:40] all these intellectuals coming up
[50:42] god had a little david out there
[50:44] somewhere
[50:45] feeding his father's sheep
[50:47] on sheep food
[50:49] the word
[50:50] not on theological weeds
[50:54] i'm closing with this
[50:57] saul goes to ask the lord again
[50:59] he gets so frustrated because god won't
[51:01] speak to him yeah
[51:02] and so he begins to think it's because
[51:04] the people didn't obey him isn't it
[51:07] strange how preachers should get off the
[51:08] word always blame the people yes
[51:13] they always blame the people other
[51:15] people the people made me do it
[51:17] the people the people didn't care about
[51:19] me and so i had to go off into the world
[51:21] the people didn't do right it's not the
[51:23] people's fault
[51:24] people weren't being fed
[51:29] and saul he he said somebody went to a
[51:31] meeting they weren't authorized to
[51:33] so he runs it down through law by lot
[51:35] and they chose him and jonathan and then
[51:37] it come down to jonathan and saul said
[51:39] to jonathan tell me what thou has done
[51:42] and jonathan told him he said i did but
[51:43] taste a little honey
[51:45] with the end of the rod that was in my
[51:47] hand
[51:48] go ahead and kill me
[51:51] and saul answered god do so and more
[51:53] also for thou shalt surely
[51:56] die jonathan
[51:59] he didn't know he was speaking prophecy
[52:00] the people saved jonathan
[52:02] then but jonathan would die on the same
[52:05] day his father did
[52:08] and saul probably thought that the whole
[52:11] reason he'd built his denomination
[52:13] and built up his church was to pass it
[52:15] on to jonathan
[52:17] and jonathan would end up dying with him
[52:19] because he stayed with him was under
[52:21] that same administration
[52:23] you'll surely die jonathan it was a
[52:25] prophecy and he didn't know it
[52:28] see the ravening wolf eats his own
[52:30] family
[52:32] he's mad
[52:33] yeah all he can think about is his
[52:35] bitterness yeah i want to bring it home
[52:37] tonight because i know the lasting
[52:39] services i preach about a lot of
[52:40] preachers and things like that think
[52:41] about yourself and your own life
[52:46] are you consumed with the passions of
[52:47] bitterness
[52:49] anger of lust of of something that
[52:52] controls your life
[52:56] or your ravening wolf you does that old
[52:58] nature cause you to eat your own family
[53:01] where you would you would cut off your
[53:02] own friends
[53:05] i've known pastors who would
[53:07] who would cut off friendships that
[53:08] they've known for years
[53:10] people who would do anything for them
[53:12] people who loved them and they cut them
[53:15] off
[53:16] because they didn't want
[53:18] they want they were protecting their own
[53:19] bitterness
[53:22] jonathan will eventually die an early
[53:23] death with his father in fact the
[53:26] entire the entire family of saul except
[53:30] for one mesh
[53:32] mephibosheth
[53:33] you can hardly say his name
[53:35] he was saved it was grace
[53:39] maybe we'll have time to get to that
[53:41] story i don't know
[53:42] it was grace
[53:44] david saved one out of that whole family
[53:46] but most of the family died
[53:49] because saul's bitterness
[53:51] and failure to break the cycle out of
[53:54] this civil war mentality out of this
[53:56] denominational mentality caused the
[53:58] death of his own son
[54:00] a man anointed with a benjaminite
[54:02] ravening wolf spirit will destroy his
[54:04] closest friends will destroy his family
[54:06] will destroy his marriage for the sake
[54:08] of his complexes yes
[54:12] and blame it on the word
[54:15] blame it on god
[54:17] i'll tell you tonight deal with your
[54:18] complexes
[54:20] deal with the problem
[54:23] deal with what's making you
[54:25] rage
[54:27] don't blame it on your family
[54:29] break that curse yes
[54:32] are you with me now
[54:33] i'm serious now you deal with it
[54:37] don't let it go on and on because
[54:38] eventually it'll destroy everybody
[54:39] around you
[54:40] if you let it
[54:43] bow your heads with me musicians come
[54:48] imagine a father
[54:50] speaking to his own son said jonathan
[54:52] you've got to die
[54:53] because i've got to be eventually my
[54:55] enemies
[55:00] my bitterness must prevail
[55:05] i i'm weak and i know i'm weak so i've
[55:07] got to act strong
[55:09] oh god it'd be better to acknowledge
[55:10] your weakness
[55:12] it'd be better to stand there and say i
[55:14] know i'm the man
[55:16] i know i'm the man like david did
[55:18] the lord i know i'm the one who did it
[55:22] be better when the word is preached to
[55:24] acknowledge it
[55:25] and say oh lord wash me with hyssop
[55:28] that i may be clean you see the
[55:30] difference in david david wasn't a
[55:31] better man than saul
[55:33] but david could repent
[55:36] david could repent david could lead
[55:38] could completely throw himself on the
[55:40] mercies of god
[55:43] and saul
[55:44] maintained
[55:46] that he was not the reason everything
[55:48] went wrong
[55:50] and so he blamed his wife and his
[55:52] children and david and everybody else
[55:58] maybe the lord is dealing with your
[55:59] heart tonight you just want to talk to
[56:01] him for a minute i
[56:02] you know
[56:03] i firmly believe that we don't give
[56:05] christians enough time sometimes to
[56:07] repent
[56:08] we want sinners to repent but we need to
[56:10] repent sometimes
[56:12] don't have that ravening wolf nature if
[56:14] that's coming out in you and you find
[56:16] yourself striking out in bitterness let
[56:18] go of that
[56:19] let god speak to you don't don't let
[56:21] that rule your life don't let those
[56:23] family complexes those stories
[56:26] that that ungodliness run your life
[56:29] don't let that bitterness run your
[56:31] church
[56:32] run your your office that you hold in
[56:34] the church
[56:35] deal with it
[56:37] let go of it break the family curse you
[56:39] can do it
[56:41] you and god are a majority
[56:43] take care of it
[56:44] don't don't justify it well we're just
[56:47] that way let it go
[56:50] i'm not supposed to be that way let me
[56:52] be different
[56:56] let my people eat
[56:59] gotta get a hold of the word of god and
[57:00] start eating from it instead of
[57:02] feeding on your prejudice and your
[57:04] the cancer of your bitterness
[57:07] let the word heal you let the honey they
[57:09] say honey has healing properties
[57:12] you can actually heal a number of
[57:14] diseases
[57:15] if you'd eat local honey we got some
[57:17] local honey
[57:19] if you just eat the honey in the wrong
[57:21] you can have healing tonight heavenly
