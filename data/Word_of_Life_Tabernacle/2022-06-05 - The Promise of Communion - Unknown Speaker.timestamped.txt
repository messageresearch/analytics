[44:56] different ones sick and
[44:58] some still on vacation
[45:00] but it's good to have you good to have
[45:01] brother john with us today and god bless
[45:03] you brother john we enjoyed that so much
[45:05] this morning but i'm not going to take
[45:07] much time tonight
[45:09] and then we're going to go into the
[45:10] communion service matthew chapter 26 and
[45:12] verse 29.
[45:14] brother robert good to see you back
[45:15] there today and
[45:17] robert's an old friend he was my
[45:18] neighbor
[45:19] and he come to witness to me about the
[45:21] message of the hour one day and and so
[45:23] we got to know one another because i've
[45:26] come to find out i had already heard
[45:28] about the message and but we we become
[45:30] good friends and he's living in perigold
[45:32] now but it's good to have you
[45:35] and pray the service will be a blessing
[45:37] to you
[45:38] matthew chapter 26 and verse 29
[45:41] but i say unto you
[45:43] i will not drink henceforth of this
[45:45] fruit of the vine
[45:46] until that day
[45:48] when i drink it new with you
[45:51] in my father's kingdom
[45:53] amen what a promise i pray the lord
[45:55] would add his blessing to the word you
[45:57] may be seated this evening
[46:02] see we think of communion as a time of
[46:04] remembrance
[46:06] and it is
[46:07] we remember his body and his blood
[46:10] but it also speaks of the future
[46:13] there's a promise in communion that i
[46:15] think we skip over sometimes
[46:17] where he says i'm going to drink this
[46:19] again
[46:21] amen i'm going to take communion with
[46:23] you
[46:24] again
[46:26] in my father's
[46:27] kingdom and he says i won't i won't be
[46:29] drinking the fruit of the vine until
[46:32] that day
[46:33] and so there he's absent in body
[46:36] here now we know if he was talking about
[46:38] a spiritual event he's here in spirit
[46:41] he's here with us so he's not talking
[46:43] about a spiritual event but he's talking
[46:46] about a literal event and i want to turn
[46:49] our minds to that for just a moment
[46:51] tonight that we would look at the
[46:53] promise in communion and we begin to see
[46:55] that he he's prepared a place for us
[46:58] you see it was in a communion service
[47:00] that he he began to tell them that he
[47:02] says don't be afraid don't let your
[47:05] hearts be troubled don't be worried by
[47:07] what's about to happen around you don't
[47:09] be afraid by what the people do don't
[47:12] even be dismayed by what you do he said
[47:15] i've already prepared a place for you
[47:18] notice how personal he is with the
[47:20] disciples he didn't say i prepared it
[47:22] for somebody else but brother john he
[47:23] said i prepared it for you
[47:26] and he said i want to sit down with you
[47:28] i i won't be drinking of the fruit of
[47:31] the vine until that day
[47:33] when i sit down with you and i drink it
[47:36] new with you in my father's kingdom
[47:40] so it's a promise that he made he said
[47:42] don't don't be without a comforter i
[47:44] won't leave you comfort let's go and
[47:46] read in the book of john and he taught
[47:48] as he talks to them it begins to tell
[47:50] them i've got to leave you it's
[47:51] expedient for me that
[47:53] for you that i go away but i'm sending
[47:56] another comforter i'm sending the holy
[47:57] ghost and and there will be a communion
[48:00] that you'll take on down through time
[48:01] remembering me taking and drinking and
[48:04] thinking about the sacrifice that i did
[48:06] for you but there will come a time when
[48:08] you'll sit with me again in the flesh
[48:12] how many believe that tonight
[48:14] brother brown said that's what believers
[48:15] believe
[48:17] there is a
[48:18] heaven amen and there is a literal jesus
[48:22] christ
[48:23] he said he'll come in a body form
[48:27] hallelujah he said that's what believers
[48:29] believe
[48:31] who am i what a thing to look forward to
[48:33] there's several places in scripture that
[48:35] promised this event in isaiah 25 and 6
[48:37] it says in this mountain shall the lord
[48:39] of the host make unto all people a feast
[48:42] of fat thanks a feast of wines on the
[48:44] leaves of fat things full of morrow of
[48:47] wines on the leaves well refined he said
[48:49] and he will destroy in this mountain the
[48:52] face of the covering cast over all
[48:54] people and the veil that has spread over
[48:56] all nations he said i'm going to take
[48:58] away the veil
[49:00] you're going to see me for who i am
[49:03] oh my verse eight he will swallow up
[49:05] death
[49:06] in victory
[49:08] and the lord god
[49:10] oh we'll take this as a promise church
[49:12] you may be going through a hard time
[49:13] right now but look at this promise the
[49:15] lord god will wipe away tears
[49:18] from off all faces
[49:21] amen and the rebuke
[49:23] oh my of his people shall he take away
[49:27] from off all the earth
[49:29] for the lord has spoken
[49:31] there's going to come a day it'll be a
[49:32] reality it won't be just something that
[49:35] we do in remembrance but it'll be a
[49:37] reality and if this moment brother joe
[49:39] could be such a precious time to us as
[49:41] believers if this moment could be such a
[49:43] wonderful in his presence as we gather
[49:46] together and we we take the communion
[49:48] together if this could be such a
[49:49] wonderful time what do you think it's
[49:51] going to be like
[49:54] very bad
[49:55] he'll swallow up death in victory wipe
[49:57] all the tears away
[49:59] the rebuke of the people will be gone
[50:01] oh the accuser will be no more
[50:04] aren't you glad for them
[50:06] verse 9 and it shall be said in that day
[50:08] lo
[50:09] this is our
[50:10] god
[50:12] amen
[50:13] why brother jt because we'll be sitting
[50:15] across the table from him
[50:19] he said well i don't see how that could
[50:21] happen i don't know how it's going to
[50:22] happen but i do know this he said he
[50:24] promised you'd come and i would know him
[50:26] because he'd come in a form like he was
[50:28] then he'll be in a body i'll be able to
[50:31] fellowship with him
[50:32] he'll come in a literal body and i'll be
[50:34] able to sit down with him at the
[50:36] marriage supper of the lamb because
[50:37] that's what he's talking about i'm going
[50:39] to sit down with you in my father's
[50:40] kingdom and drink of this cup
[50:44] amen
[50:46] we'll sit down in communion together and
[50:48] we'll say this is our god
[50:52] and when we do that we're not going to
[50:53] be pointing to a man
[50:54] we're not going to be pointing to a
[50:56] prophet we're not going to be pointing
[50:58] to a pastor
[50:59] are you hearing me today we're not going
[51:01] to be pointing to someone else but we're
[51:04] going to say this is our god
[51:07] who is it the lord jesus christ
[51:11] amen this is our god
[51:13] oh my this is the lord
[51:16] you don't have a right to take communion
[51:18] if you don't believe in christ
[51:20] because that's the very element of it
[51:22] we're remembering the fact that god came
[51:24] in flesh and dwelt among us and and he
[51:26] come down as the son of god and died for
[51:29] our sins and rose again on the third day
[51:31] amen and he made a promise he said i
[51:33] want to eat i'm going to take communion
[51:35] with you
[51:37] amen
[51:38] we're gonna have dinner together
[51:43] some of you all i've been trying to have
[51:45] dinner with for two years
[51:47] and many of you have been to my house
[51:49] but some of y'all you know how it works
[51:51] if you get thinking about there's only
[51:52] 52 weeks in a year
[51:54] you take out time when you're gone for
[51:55] vacation and different things and you
[51:57] kind of have to prioritize then it seems
[51:59] like as a pastor sometimes all you're
[52:01] doing is putting out fires and you don't
[52:03] get to you don't get talked to the
[52:04] normal people very i'm sorry
[52:09] if people don't have any troubles you
[52:10] know you don't you tend to dwell more
[52:12] that's the way you are with your kids
[52:13] isn't it
[52:14] you spend more time with the people that
[52:16] have trouble and
[52:17] that's not always true but but you know
[52:20] i want to there's a desire there
[52:22] i want to
[52:24] i can't always make what i want to
[52:26] happen
[52:27] but he can
[52:30] god never had an unfulfilled desire
[52:33] think about that for a minute
[52:36] run that through your brain
[52:38] he never had an unfulfilled desire
[52:43] if he ever wanted to fellowship with you
[52:45] he will
[52:48] if he ever wanted to take communion with
[52:50] you he will
[52:53] if he ever wanted to sit down across the
[52:55] table if he said i'm going to sit down
[52:57] across the table from you i'm going to
[52:59] drink of this cup with you then he will
[53:02] why because he's more than a man he's
[53:04] god in flesh
[53:07] amen
[53:08] this is the lord we have waited for him
[53:11] he will save us this is the lord we have
[53:13] waited for him we will be glad and
[53:15] rejoice in his salvation jesus talked
[53:18] about it in luke chapter 13 verse 23
[53:20] then said one unto him lord are there
[53:22] few that be saved he said unto them
[53:25] strive to enter in at the straight gate
[53:27] for many i say unto you will seek to
[53:29] enter in and shall not be able
[53:30] he said when once the master of the
[53:32] house is risen up and has shut the door
[53:34] you begin to stand without and to knock
[53:36] at the door he's preaching to them jews
[53:37] that we're about to reject his ministry
[53:40] he said he's going gonna stand up you're
[53:41] gonna shut the door oh you better while
[53:43] he's still knocking while he's still
[53:44] dealing with you you have to respond
[53:46] then
[53:47] but he said once when when he shut the
[53:49] door and you stand without and knock on
[53:51] the door and say lord lord open unto us
[53:54] and he shall answer and say unto you i
[53:56] know you not whence you are
[53:59] and so you begin to say we have eaten
[54:01] and drunk in thy presence we were with
[54:02] you when you were here
[54:04] and thou is taught in our streaks yes
[54:07] and he shall say i tell you i know
[54:09] you're not which you are depart from me
[54:10] all ye workers of iniquity there shall
[54:13] be weeping and gnashing of teeth when
[54:14] you shall see abraham
[54:16] oh my now here's the promise
[54:18] you'll see abraham and isaac and jacob
[54:22] and all the prophets in the kingdom of
[54:24] god
[54:25] and you yourselves stressed out
[54:28] verse 29 and they shall come
[54:31] now watch
[54:32] who's going to come because the prophets
[54:34] were buried there in palestine
[54:35] but here comes another group they shall
[54:37] come from the east from the west from
[54:40] the north from the south and shall sit
[54:42] down in the kingdom of god
[54:44] well that's you and me
[54:48] john spoke of it in revelation chapter
[54:50] 19 he said let us be glad and rejoice
[54:52] and give honor to him for the marriage
[54:53] of the lamb has come and his wife hath
[54:55] made herself
[54:57] ready
[54:58] amen and to her was granted that she
[55:01] should be arrayed and final in and clean
[55:02] and white for the fine linen is the
[55:04] righteousness of saints
[55:07] you know if you ask me say brother ben
[55:08] do you get yourself ready for church
[55:10] absolutely
[55:12] but the clothes are supplied
[55:15] maybe i shouldn't let you know this but
[55:17] i don't wash my clothes
[55:19] i don't iron my clothes
[55:21] i don't lay them out
[55:23] my wife does all of that i just put on
[55:25] what she gives me that's what we do as
[55:27] the bride
[55:28] the garments are supplied
[55:31] and the fine linen is the righteousness
[55:32] of saints he sayeth unto me right
[55:34] blessed are they which are called unto
[55:37] the marriage supper of
[55:40] the lamb
[55:42] blessed are they and he saith unto me
[55:44] these are the true sayings of god now we
[55:47] know that last supper was a sad occasion
[55:51] communion is a solemn occasion
[55:54] it's not where we get all happy and
[55:56] usually and jumping around it's a solemn
[55:58] occasion
[56:00] but that will be a joyful place
[56:02] [Music]
[56:04] i've never
[56:05] seen
[56:06] joy like i saw when i was in africa and
[56:08] the way that they worship i love joyful
[56:11] worship
[56:12] i believe when we get over there
[56:14] that will our worship would be more like
[56:16] that
[56:17] here many times our worship is solemn
[56:20] because of the things that we go through
[56:21] and we feel the presence of god and
[56:23] and we sense that we're not worthy to be
[56:25] in his presence but over there
[56:27] when we have a new body we've been
[56:29] redeemed by the blood of the lamb i feel
[56:31] like that our worship will be more
[56:33] joyful and and we'll there'll be more of
[56:35] a shout to it there'll be more of a of
[56:38] an excitement to it why because we made
[56:40] it
[56:42] amen
[56:43] brother brad who said many of them old
[56:44] saints has gone to the grave
[56:47] but one of these days yonder in a new
[56:49] world when they come forth into the
[56:51] promised land the banner of the cross

[1:00:28] overcome the greatest affliction the

[1:01:19] one of these days will all be big enough
[1:01:21] to shout

[1:01:25] place but the random says thank you of
[1:01:26] the great time
[1:01:28] are you with me tonight i'm not going to

[1:01:30] he said when we'll have the lord's
[1:01:31] supper together
[1:01:33] drink the fruit of the vine eat anew of
[1:01:35] the food and the kingdom of god see that
[1:01:38] great table spread out for thousands of
[1:01:41] miles
[1:01:43] oh
[1:01:44] i'm going to sit right next to sister
[1:01:46] fritz because i want to see what she
[1:01:47] looks like in a 21 year old body
[1:01:51] a great table spread out for thousands
[1:01:53] of months and she she ain't gonna miss
[1:01:54] it she could we can't hardly get her to
[1:01:56] miss church
[1:01:58] she's gonna miss it she would she'll be
[1:01:59] there i believe that i believe many of
[1:02:00] you will be there i trust all of you
[1:02:02] will be there
[1:02:04] amen
[1:02:05] and he said that great table how the
[1:02:06] lord suffered together drink of the
[1:02:08] fruit of the vine eat anew of the tate
[1:02:10] of the food and the kingdom of god see
[1:02:12] that great table spread out for
[1:02:13] thousands of miles all the redeemed of
[1:02:15] all ages gathered around the table as we
[1:02:18] look across at each other and shake each
[1:02:20] other's hands a little teardrop run down
[1:02:22] our cheek
[1:02:24] then the king in his beauty
[1:02:26] she'll come out in his white robe
[1:02:28] walk down along the table
[1:02:33] that can't happen
[1:02:34] you just watch
[1:02:39] i believe it
[1:02:41] some things we have to maintain a belief
[1:02:43] in
[1:02:45] you can't just subject everything to the
[1:02:46] reasoning of your mind you won't have
[1:02:47] anything worth saving after a while
[1:02:50] won't have anything worth believing
[1:02:53] i believe he'll walk down there
[1:02:56] i'm a crier
[1:02:59] you might have to stay at my table for a
[1:03:00] while it'd be all right wipe the tears
[1:03:03] from my face
[1:03:05] but it will take a while won't it for us
[1:03:08] just take his hand
[1:03:10] and i think his presence
[1:03:12] will just settle us down to the point
[1:03:13] where we won't have to cry no more i cry
[1:03:16] a lot in communion services but i've
[1:03:18] cried in a bunch of communion services
[1:03:20] over the years normally about my own sin
[1:03:24] my own unworthiness
[1:03:26] he'll come by and says say i've made you
[1:03:28] worthy you're my bride don't cry
[1:03:31] children
[1:03:32] it's all over
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:36] enter into the joys of the lord which is
[1:03:38] prepared for you since the foundation of
[1:03:40] the world don't it make you want to be
[1:03:42] there isn't there something in your
[1:03:45] heart that calls you to that land
[1:03:50] you see he's not only made reservations
[1:03:52] but he's made a down payment
[1:03:55] ephesians tells us that
[1:03:57] the holy ghost the holy spirit of
[1:03:59] promise is the earnest of our
[1:04:00] inheritance
[1:04:01] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:04:03] possession he's made a down payment he's
[1:04:05] deposited the down payment in you
[1:04:09] on the reservation for the dinner he's
[1:04:10] going to have with you
[1:04:12] and not only that but you're going to
[1:04:14] drink the new wine he said i will drink
[1:04:16] the new wine
[1:04:17] with you in acts chapter 2 and i'm not
[1:04:19] going to read these scriptures to save
[1:04:21] time but i'll just kind of go through it
[1:04:23] it talks about how peter stood up and he
[1:04:25] said these are not drunk men
[1:04:27] as you suppose seeing it is but the
[1:04:28] third hour of the day but this is that
[1:04:31] which was spoken by the prophet joel and
[1:04:33] we find that that new wine was to remain
[1:04:35] with the church in revelation 6 6 he
[1:04:37] said i heard a voice in the midst of the
[1:04:38] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[1:04:40] penny three measures of barley for a
[1:04:42] penny and don't hurt the oil and the
[1:04:44] wine
[1:04:45] it was to remain even during the hard
[1:04:46] times even in the darkness of time
[1:04:48] because brother madam said we find out
[1:04:50] that it stimulates and it gives joy
[1:04:52] because it's god's word
[1:04:54] the new wine stimulates when it reveals
[1:04:56] the word he said then it brings joy
[1:04:57] beyond measure sometimes he said we went
[1:04:59] through that it brings such joy till you
[1:05:02] get over flooded have you ever been that
[1:05:04] joyful
[1:05:05] that you just got over flooded with joy
[1:05:07] that's why you shall that's why you
[1:05:09] that's why you worship god because
[1:05:10] you're over flooded
[1:05:13] think how full you're going to be
[1:05:16] when he the person of jesus christ
[1:05:20] walks by your table
[1:05:24] some of y'all aren't shouters but i'm
[1:05:25] going to shout
[1:05:28] i want to shout just thinking about it
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:35] do we really believe what i think people
[1:05:37] say well
[1:05:38] these people shout it's just all
[1:05:39] emotionalism and stuff and i know some
[1:05:41] of it is but what are you shouting about
[1:05:44] what are you joyful about
[1:05:46] i found when people don't have nothing
[1:05:49] they tend to be joyful because they're
[1:05:50] looking forward to something
[1:05:53] amen if you got to a place maybe where
[1:05:54] you didn't have nothing in this world
[1:05:56] and the world had lost all its appeal to
[1:05:58] you you'd begin to look at another land
[1:06:00] and say there's joy over there there's
[1:06:03] peace over there there's healing over
[1:06:05] there there's strength over there
[1:06:07] there's power over there
[1:06:09] hallelujah
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] i'm almost big enough to shout
[1:06:17] he said the new wine stimulates brings
[1:06:18] joy beyond measure you get over flooded
[1:06:20] i know there's a lot of fanaticism
[1:06:22] people carrying on he said i know
[1:06:23] sometimes they do it when the music is
[1:06:25] jumping up and down and everything i
[1:06:26] know that ghost he said and i believe
[1:06:28] that too yeah
[1:06:30] brother brown had no problem with being
[1:06:32] happy with the music
[1:06:34] right that's what he said no that's not
[1:06:35] the holy ghost that's just the joy that
[1:06:38] you feel
[1:06:39] you have to leave time for the word
[1:06:42] right the word's the most important part
[1:06:45] but what are you shouting about well you
[1:06:47] get excited because of the word he said
[1:06:48] but i've seen people in the day he said
[1:06:50] as long as the music is playing
[1:06:51] everybody was jumping and screaming but
[1:06:53] when the music stopped it stopped he
[1:06:55] said well he said that that's still all
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:58] as far as i'm concerned he said as long
[1:07:00] as people live right
[1:07:03] he said but now he said you start
[1:07:05] bringing the word
[1:07:07] he said now that's the thing
[1:07:10] that actually brings life
[1:07:12] is the word and that brings the joy of
[1:07:15] stimulation of new wine
[1:07:17] glory he said yes and that's what it was
[1:07:19] on pentecost when the word was
[1:07:22] vindicated what was it they walked out
[1:07:24] and said this is that why were they
[1:07:26] drunk they were drunk on the real
[1:07:27] realization on the revelation of a
[1:07:29] promise fulfilled
[1:07:31] what are we drunk on today you could be
[1:07:33] drunk on the world you could be drunk on
[1:07:35] the things of the world but i'm drunk
[1:07:36] today on the realization of the
[1:07:38] revelation of a prophecy fulfilled what
[1:07:40] was history is now prophecy the bride
[1:07:43] revival is going on right now we're not
[1:07:44] looking forward to it he said well
[1:07:46] brother ben but you know if he had a
[1:07:48] bigger church i'd feel more like
[1:07:49] shouting that's not what it's about i'm
[1:07:51] drunk on a new wine
[1:07:53] the new wine oh my it's the revelation
[1:07:56] becoming reality listen to me we can be
[1:07:59] drunk on the new wine of this age when
[1:08:00] we see the opening of the word the
[1:08:02] revealing of the thunder it's the
[1:08:03] revealing of the seals
[1:08:05] right we can see that not coming but
[1:08:07] already happened
[1:08:09] we can be drunk on that
[1:08:11] but one day i'm going to be drunk
[1:08:13] on the fact that he's standing in front
[1:08:15] of me
[1:08:18] oh
[1:08:20] you talk about revelation
[1:08:22] i won't have any need
[1:08:24] of faith
[1:08:25] you realize faith is for down here
[1:08:29] well i'm in need of faith
[1:08:31] you'd just be standing right in front of
[1:08:33] me
[1:08:35] see god could stand right in front of
[1:08:36] you here and you would never believe it
[1:08:39] most of us wouldn't thomas didn't
[1:08:42] he'd come in they told him about it said
[1:08:44] well
[1:08:44] he finally did come in and then he
[1:08:46] believed but he said more blessed are
[1:08:47] they who not seen yet believed
[1:08:50] he might come and stand in front of you
[1:08:51] and not know it
[1:08:53] but yet one day he'll come and stand in
[1:08:54] front of you if you make it
[1:08:56] you'll know who he is
[1:08:58] there'll be a perfect revelation of the
[1:09:01] person of jesus christ who is god made
[1:09:05] flesh
[1:09:07] who is an exact copy as the brother said
[1:09:10] the other knight of god
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:16] that's who we're worshiping tonight
[1:09:19] the branham said that's what was on
[1:09:21] pentecost see we don't need a big band
[1:09:22] to be joyful
[1:09:23] when we drink the new wine with him
[1:09:26] over here sometimes we have to use music
[1:09:28] to overcome
[1:09:29] our inabilities or our
[1:09:32] our the atmosphere of our daily life we
[1:09:34] sometimes use music to break down that
[1:09:36] atmosphere we won't even need it over
[1:09:38] there
[1:09:39] and i know there'll be music over there
[1:09:40] but but you'll be in the atmosphere
[1:09:43] walking with him
[1:09:45] don't you want to walk so close to him
[1:09:47] here that you get a little taste of that
[1:09:50] you see you can't put the stimulation of
[1:09:52] the word doesn't work in old bottles and
[1:09:53] you've heard brother branham talk about
[1:09:54] it i won't hold you much longer but you
[1:09:56] you've heard of the new wine put in old
[1:09:58] bottles in luke 5 37 and 38 he said the
[1:10:01] new wine got to be put into new bottles
[1:10:03] and both are preserved and he's brother
[1:10:05] brandon said no that's the way it is
[1:10:06] today you can't take this brand-new
[1:10:08] heaven-born pentecostal wine mix it up
[1:10:10] with some old-time creed some old set in
[1:10:12] the way died in the wall he said if you
[1:10:14] do you go preaching about the baptism of
[1:10:15] the holy spirit divine healing signs and
[1:10:17] wonders that old skin will try to
[1:10:19] stretch and it'll blow
[1:10:20] he said the days of miracles have passed
[1:10:22] i can't stand it no more i can't even
[1:10:23] stand through this sermon
[1:10:26] blow you out the door it goes
[1:10:29] he said but to put new pentecostal wine
[1:10:31] you have to have new bottles
[1:10:33] amen new bottles it's new skin
[1:10:36] oh my listen when i when i was saved i
[1:10:39] was born again he put a new heart and a
[1:10:41] new spirit and he put his spirit down in
[1:10:43] the middle of it because he said you
[1:10:45] couldn't even get along with yourself
[1:10:46] but there's coming today brother john
[1:10:48] one will be all new body
[1:10:49] i won't have to contend with the flesh
[1:10:51] anymore aren't you glad for that brother
[1:10:53] joel there will come a day when the old
[1:10:54] flesh had held us down we won't have to
[1:10:56] contend with it anymore you talk about
[1:10:58] new wine here he can pour it in us in
[1:11:00] measure because we couldn't handle it
[1:11:03] if he poured it all out we couldn't
[1:11:04] handle it but there
[1:11:06] there will be a perfect realization
[1:11:08] there we shall know him as we have been
[1:11:10] known there will seem as as he sees us
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:19] brother madam said it'll stretch out i'm
[1:11:21] going to skip past
[1:11:22] some of this
[1:11:24] he said think about what it'll be when
[1:11:25] the full wine
[1:11:27] is in new bodies ephesians 2 1. you have
[1:11:29] to quickened
[1:11:30] we're dead in trespasses and stands do

[1:11:39] payment on a future dinner
[1:11:42] what will it be when you really get all
[1:11:44] the dividends paid on
[1:11:48] he said oh no wonder paul caught up in
[1:11:50] the third heaven said eyes not seen here
[1:11:52] has not heard neither has it entered
[1:11:54] into the heart of man what god has for
[1:11:56] them in store for that love him
[1:11:59] what will that be
[1:12:01] you talk about joy unspeakable and full
[1:12:03] of glory
[1:12:04] he said you who were once dead in sin
[1:12:06] and trespasses as he quickened together
[1:12:09] aren't you glad to be quickened tonight
[1:12:11] maybe this could be a joyful communion
[1:12:13] service because we know we've passed
[1:12:15] from death into life
[1:12:17] amen we've been quickened by the power
[1:12:19] of god
[1:12:21] you as he quickened what's it going to
[1:12:23] be when you come to he said when it
[1:12:24] comes to the shadow of the shadows into
[1:12:26] the shadow the shadow then into the
[1:12:28] creek the creek into the river the river
[1:12:30] into the ocean and what is it when

[1:12:45] body i know some of you are suffering
[1:12:47] right now you're hurting in your body
[1:12:48] but won't it be a day
[1:12:51] amen when you get over there and you
[1:12:52] don't have to worry what's it going to
[1:12:54] be like when you get in a new body a
[1:12:56] brand new body you turn back to a young
[1:12:58] man all together again a young woman
[1:13:00] you're never going to die no more and
[1:13:02] you look down on earth and think i could
[1:13:04] enjoy some grapes
[1:13:06] now watch
[1:13:07] i see some of us go by way of the grave
[1:13:10] he says we'll look down on the earth and
[1:13:11] think i could enjoy some grapes
[1:13:13] some good cold water i don't need it
[1:13:15] here but someday jesus is coming and
[1:13:17] this angelic this theophany i'm living
[1:13:19] in you'll speak someday and the dead in
[1:13:21] christ shall rise
[1:13:22] and that body that i once lived in will
[1:13:24] resurrect into a glorified body
[1:13:27] and i'll walk and i'll talk and i'll
[1:13:29] live
[1:13:30] and i'll enjoy

[1:13:51] you want comfort food your comfort food
[1:13:53] is usually what you grew up eating
[1:13:55] and when you get over in a theophany
[1:13:56] body you won't have any need of that
[1:14:00] but when you get into that glorified
[1:14:01] body
[1:14:05] there will be joloff for brother john
[1:14:08] that right
[1:14:10] he said you'll be able to enjoy

[1:14:29] eternal ages that is to come through
[1:14:31] jesus christ our lord there you are
[1:14:33] brother that's the gospel
[1:14:36] jesus is telling his disciples don't get
[1:14:38] too discouraged
[1:14:39] there's a joy set before you
[1:14:41] see job got discouraged and jehovah god
[1:14:43] reminded him about that place he said
[1:14:45] where were you
[1:14:47] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[1:14:49] declare if thou hast understanding
[1:14:52] when the morning starts saying together
[1:14:54] and the sons of god
[1:14:56] oh i skipped part of that
[1:14:58] all the sons of god
[1:15:05] [Laughter]
[1:15:08] sorry
[1:15:10] i need to act like a gentleman
[1:15:13] all the sons of god
[1:15:18] all the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:15:22] see if you were there
[1:15:25] your place was reserved by jesus christ
[1:15:27] himself at the marriage supper of the
[1:15:29] lamb
[1:15:31] that's why i don't i don't need no new
[1:15:33] doctrine
[1:15:34] i don't need no new messenger
[1:15:36] i don't need nothing but what already
[1:15:38] has come to me because that was what got
[1:15:40] me ready
[1:15:43] that was the shout
[1:15:44] out
[1:15:45] amen the shout the voice and the trumpet
[1:15:48] that calls me to the wedding supper in
[1:15:50] the sky that was it
[1:15:52] together the bride together to go home
[1:15:54] that was it i don't need nothing new
[1:15:58] because i'm going home
[1:16:00] i was there
[1:16:02] where were you
[1:16:04] when the morning starts staying together
[1:16:06] and this is all the sons of god
[1:16:09] shouted for joy
[1:16:12] see we look unto jesus
[1:16:14] paul says the author and finisher of our
[1:16:15] faith and see he had a joy set before
[1:16:18] him what was it the promise
[1:16:20] being able to commune with you
[1:16:24] the cross wasn't joyful
[1:16:26] that we're about to remember in
[1:16:27] communion the cross wasn't joyful
[1:16:30] but there is a joy coming
[1:16:32] the shedding of his blood was not joyful
[1:16:36] but now we can remember it with joy
[1:16:38] because where there's a joy set before
[1:16:40] us
[1:16:41] he sat down at the right hand of the
[1:16:43] throne of god second corinthians 4 16
[1:16:45] for which cause we faint not
[1:16:47] but though our outward men perish
[1:16:49] yet the inward is renewed day
[1:16:52] by day
[1:16:53] i love this
[1:16:55] for our light affliction
[1:17:00] i love the way paul he's in prison by
[1:17:01] the way
[1:17:03] he's been beat he's been shipwrecked
[1:17:06] he's been left with he'd been left for
[1:17:07] dead
[1:17:09] he's at our light affliction
[1:17:12] which is but for a moment
[1:17:15] work is for us a far more exceeding and
[1:17:18] eternal weight of glory he's given the
[1:17:20] imagery of a scale on this side is our
[1:17:22] affliction and it barely moves the scale
[1:17:25] and on this side
[1:17:26] how do you weigh eternity
[1:17:31] while we look not at the things which
[1:17:33] are seen
[1:17:34] but the things which are not seen for
[1:17:35] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:17:37] the things which are not seen
[1:17:39] are eternal how are we going to get
[1:17:40] there we have to be united with the word
[1:17:42] by the son of man ministry luke 17 30
[1:17:44] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:17:46] the son of man is revealed but the
[1:17:47] brahmana said in that day the son of man
[1:17:49] will be revealed what to join the church
[1:17:50] to the head unite the marriage of the
[1:17:52] bride the bridegroom call will come
[1:17:54] right through this when the son of man
[1:17:55] will come down come in human flesh to
[1:17:57] unite the two together he said the
[1:17:59] church has to be the word
[1:18:00] he is the word and the two unites
[1:18:02] together and to do that it will take the
[1:18:04] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:18:05] son of man he said see it son of man
[1:18:07] jesus christ will come down and human
[1:18:09] flesh among us will make his words so
[1:18:11] real did it happen church
[1:18:14] that it will unite the church and him
[1:18:16] swan the bride and then she'll go home
[1:18:18] to the wedding supper
[1:18:20] hey man she's already united see we go
[1:18:23] to the wedding supper not the marriage
[1:18:25] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:18:27] supper when the word here unites with
[1:18:29] the person and they too become one
[1:18:33] and then what does it do then it
[1:18:34] manifests the son of man again
[1:18:36] what does it do then church i'm closing
[1:18:38] with this musicians go ahead and come
[1:18:40] what does it do it manifests the son of
[1:18:42] man again
[1:18:44] again he didn't say it would only be
[1:18:45] manifested once
[1:18:47] he said it manifests the son of man
[1:18:49] again not the church theologians the son
[1:18:51] of man the word and
[1:18:53] the church
[1:18:55] becomes one
[1:18:57] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:18:59] word the church
[1:19:01] does the same thing
[1:19:03] oh god
[1:19:07] you may be in a solemn season now but
[1:19:09] joy is coming
[1:19:12] psalm 30 and 5 said his anger endureth
[1:19:15] but a moment
[1:19:17] in his favor his life
[1:19:19] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[1:19:23] cometh
[1:19:24] in the morning
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:28] his anger was displayed on calvary but
[1:19:30] he loved his own to the end so we
[1:19:33] prepared a place for them but their name
[1:19:35] on a seed at the table
[1:19:37] made a reservation
[1:19:39] gave the down payment yes sir
[1:19:45] every head bound and every eye closed
[1:19:46] before we go to the communion
[1:19:50] if that reservation has not been made
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:56] or you don't know that it's been made
[1:19:57] for you if your son of god has been made
[1:20:00] but perhaps you've never come to that
[1:20:02] recognition
[1:20:04] that's been made for you
[1:20:06] i know we're having trouble with the
[1:20:07] streaming tonight but
[1:20:09] maybe somebody will watch this once we
[1:20:10] upload it and if that reservation
[1:20:13] has not been made you don't know that
[1:20:15] it's been made
[1:20:17] don't you believe him
[1:20:20] why don't you do like the disciples and
[1:20:22] believe him
[1:20:24] lord i believe helped out my unbelief
[1:20:28] believe him
[1:20:29] that he will prepare a place at the
[1:20:31] table for you
[1:20:33] he already has prepared a new body
[1:20:36] and then do whatever it takes
[1:20:39] what is it brother ben well you dress
[1:20:41] yourself with the word
[1:20:43] become united with the word
[1:20:45] become one with the word what that means
[1:20:48] is whenever the word comes i will not
[1:20:49] reject the word if the word tells me to
[1:20:51] go to church i will go to church
[1:20:53] otherwise i cannot be married to him
[1:20:57] you understand the word tells me to live
[1:21:00] a godly life i i'll live a god i may
[1:21:02] make mistakes sure every time i'll fail
[1:21:05] going to church don't save me living a
[1:21:06] godly life doesn't save me but i'll do
[1:21:09] it because i want to be one with him
[1:21:11] i want to be this i will do it
[1:21:13] did you say that this evening i will
[1:21:15] lord
[1:21:16] i believe you lord
[1:21:18] i believe you lord i i wanna go
[1:21:21] let the son of god come down and
[1:21:24] just drive out all the darkness
[1:21:26] all the things of the world all the
[1:21:28] all the little things we get caught up
[1:21:30] and as we take the communion tonight
[1:21:32] just just let him take all that away i
[1:21:34] know there's just a few of us tonight
[1:21:35] but why don't you just let him take all
[1:21:37] that away and say lord
[1:21:39] i want to be ready for my place at the
